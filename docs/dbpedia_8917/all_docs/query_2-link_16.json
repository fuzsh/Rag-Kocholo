        "text": "Welcome to the 21th Media Mailbag for The Athletic. Writing a mailbag — as egocentric as it is — is always a fun exercise. Thanks for sending in your questions via The Athletic website and app.\n\nI know there are a lot of serious matters going on right now, so I figured I’d give you a fun question. Your task: Build your dream broadcast team, one that you could drop into basically any sporting event and have them do a good job. Here are your positions to fill:\n\nPlay-by-play:\n\nAnalyst\n\nSideline:\n\nStudio host:\n\nStudio analyst 1:\n\nStudio analyst 2:\n\nStudio analyst 3:\n\nIf you have any other positions you’d like to add, feel free. Oh, and one other thing: No people who currently work together (i.e. if Tony Romo is your analyst, Jim Nantz can’t be play-by-play). – Doug G.\n\nI love these kinds of questions, Doug. I’m going to read your scenario as wanting a broadcast team that has versatility as opposed to specialization. For example: While I love Mike Emrick on the NHL, I would not opt for him in this scenario. It also eliminates some great NFL people such as Romo. I found the analyst position the hardest one to fill so I am blowing up convention and using Bob Costas as a hybrid analyst who can also do play-by-play. I wanted interesting and curious voices for my studio analysts and studio host. The Dryden pick will surprise many but he gave the best answer I’ve ever heard on how an all-time upset happens.\n\nPlay-by-play: Al Michaels\n\nAnalyst: Bob Costas\n\nSideline: Doris Burke\n\nSideline: Holly Rowe\n\nStudio host: Rebecca Lowe\n\nStudio analyst 1: Charles Barkley\n\nStudio analyst 2: Jay Bilas\n\nStudio analyst 3: Ken Dryden\n\nRules analyst: Gene Steratore\n\nWhat are the latest developments on the ESPN/SEC front? Will CBS opt out early at some point or is that out the window? –Tom F.\n\nIn talking to my frequent podcast partner John Ourand of Sports Business Daily, I don’t think CBS is going to opt out anytime soon. The ratings for SEC football are too good for CBS to walk away from the series, even as a lame-duck owner of the package.\n\nBeat writers/reporters obviously won’t be able to go into locker rooms for postgame access in the near future due to this pandemic. How concerned are you that this may happen on a permanent basis even after the pandemic? – Josh A.\n\nI’d be a fool not to be concerned as a reader. It’s important for all sports journalism organizations to push back if access restrictions become permanent in a post-COVID universe.\n\nWill MLB ever get rid of its very outdated blackout rules for telecasts? Where I live blackouts include both New York teams which are more than 200 miles from where I live. I have read MLB fans in Iowa face blackouts involving six teams. As Al Michaels called it in the epic Game 5 of the 1986 ALCS, UNBELIEVEABLE! Thanks for reading. – Wayne B.\n\nFor this question I asked Lee Berke, a longtime sports TV consultant who has clients across NFL, MLB, NBA, NCAA, NHL and NASCAR, to weigh in:\n\nOnce upon a time, when sports could only be watched on broadcast television, blackouts occurred naturally and fans didn’t care. A limited number of hometown MLB games were aired on local TV stations and could only be seen as far as the television signal carried – about 75 miles or so from the stadium. Other than a national network game of the week, that was about all the baseball (or basketball or hockey) that fans could watch, other than the playoffs and World Series. Then, in the early 1970’s, media technology lurched forward with the rollout of cable television, and suddenly, a regional sports network or a superstation could be distributed nationally. In fact, MSG Network, the first RSN, was able to offer up NY Knicks and NY Rangers games nationally through HBO and USA Network. Trivia buffs: first night of HBO programming on November 8, 1972 was a Rangers game and the movie, “Sometimes A Great Notion.”\n\nWith the growth of pay TV, teams now had growing numbers of regional sports networks and superstations eager to offer up thousands of games annually that had never been televised before. However, team owners wanted to keep control over their regional media rights, so that superstation-powered teams like the Chicago Cubs on WGN and the Atlanta Braves on WTBS couldn’t poach local fans. So MLB along with the NBA and NHL established territories for each team’s locally aired games that applied to all media technologies – broadcast, cable, satellite and just recently, OTT streaming. Between these territories and technologies, fans today have far more games to watch, but if they want to access out-of-market locally-televised games, they have to essentially buy their way out of their territories by purchasing MLB, NBA and NHL out-of-market pay TV and streaming packages along with NFL Sunday Ticket. All good, but a pricey solution and not a total one, since, as Wayne B. noted, there are certain markets claimed as territories by multiple teams, which means you have to subscribe to multiple RSNs to watch those games as well.\n\nFortunately, pro leagues are now offering up easier, less-expensive streaming access to team games in some of these overlapping markets. It’s not perfect, but then again, given the deluge of games available across multiple networks and platforms, it’s better than it used to be, and my guess is that ongoing advances in media technology will soon make it at once easier, and more lucrative for all the leagues to offer up all their games regardless of territory. Plus, you won’t have to watch “Sometimes A Great Notion.”\n\nSeveral questions: How are beat reporters covering the NHL bubble? Will they go to Canada to start mandatory quarantine or will they try to cover from afar? Will American teams look at hiring local Canadian reporters to cover the team? How will radio/TV cover this remotely as well? Thank you. –Larry T.\n\nWhat I’ve heard so far is that there will be no reporters inside the NHL bubble on a daily basis and very limited attendance to games per outlet. The access will be much less than the NBA. The post-game and pre-game access is expected to be Zoom. I have not heard anything on TV and radio but will forward it when I do. It will be a costly enterprise for U.S. outlets to cover, even using Canadian freelancers. Any U.S. reporter who is a foreign national and admitted into Canada, must quarantine for 14 days.\n\nWho will ultimately be the better NFL analyst: Drew Brees or Greg Olsen? – Doug T.\n\nI think both will be very good but Olsen (with more reps) will be better at the start.\n\nFrom the Toronto Sun, July 13: “NBC will fly upwards of 50 broadcast people to Toronto – producers, directors, camera people, technicians and more – to serve as the world feed for all National Hockey League games played in this hub city while many Canadian broadcast freelancers, out of work since March, are not at all happy about the snub.” I understand the NHL needing to satisfy their U.S. broadcast partner, but in the interest of public health, how could this not have been achieved with a local crew with American on-air talent? Your thoughts on this? – Danu M.\n\nIt’s not an easy Q to answer. I wish there was a scenario where both entities can find work, especially given how many freelance broadcast production people have been out of work since March. I appreciate the loyalty NBC is showing its people. On the other hand, the majority of the Canadian public understandably want to limit the number of people in the country right now. I hope the Canadian freelancers can pick up some work elsewhere.\n\nAny idea how CBS is going to air the Masters, college football and the NFL the same weekend provided football will be played this fall? – Bruce W\n\nThe Masters will air on CBS that weekend (Nov 14-15). That’s a lock. CBS is scheduled for just three NFL games that weekend, all with starting times at 4:05 p.m. None of those games feature mega-ratings teams so even if the Masters runs long that Sunday, CBS is fine. As for college football, CBS can place them on CBS Sports Network or its streaming service.\n\nWith college football most likely not taking place this fall, how will networks pivot their programming on Saturdays? Will ESPN/ABC/CBS/FOX bring in more pro games? Will they offer up classic games on their secondary channels (ESPN2/ESPNU/CBS Sports, etc.)? – Justin C.\n\nFor purposes of this question, let’s assume that college football does occur in some form. If so, it seems unlikely that it’ll be the nice and orderly seasons that networks are used to. Instead, I would expect all sorts of “adjust on the fly” chaos adjustments, a wave of positive tests on Friday cancels a game 24 hours later, and certain schools go into full quarantine and postpone games. Maybe an entire conference decides to shut down for a few weeks before starting back up, etc. How are broadcast networks going to handle this uncertainty? How flexible is the behind the scenes camera crew/production team apparatus required to put on a decent show? – Joseph, Atlanta\n\nExcellent questions. It’s going to be a scramble job if college football is not played this fall. The good news for the networks in what would be a bad situation is that programming departments would be responsible for filling inventory for a single day for the most part (I know CFB is played on days other than Saturday) as opposed to multiple days. At a place like ESPN, college football is spread across so many of its networks and ESPN + that it would be significant inventory lost. I think you would definitely see some classic college football games, 30 for 30 airings and whatever replays they can put on of games in other sports that are currently being played. Regarding Joseph’s question, I think these networks can adjust on the fly, especially given much of the remote production will occur away from the field. But expect a lower-quality broadcast such as number of cameras, broadcasters calling games from home, etc.\n\nI am not a fan of the fake crowd noise Fox is using in the MLS tournament. However, I am curious as to how they do it. Do you have any details on how it is done? Is it from actual games or is it completely artificial? If they are going to continue using it, they could at least use actual crowd noise from the home team. Then you would get to hear the songs and chants. Though I prefer to hear the players talk. – Ryan P.\n\nOn digital devices, including the Fox Sports app, you can choose from dedicated streams with or without added crowd noise. Fox is putting the audio together from their L.A. studios but I don’t know the specifics. Here’s what Pierre Moossa, the coordinating producer for NBC Sports Group’s Premier League coverage, said in a conference call on the Premier League’s atmospheric enhanced audio.\n\n“It’s being produced and done via EA SPORTS which has sampled 92 different ways of cheering,” Moossa said. “All the audio they are providing, the crowd effects, visitor effects, the jeers, have all been samples from specific matches. So if you are watching a Liverpool match at Anfield, it’s crowds and samples from Anfield from a Liverpool match. Ultimately it’s the most authentic way of enhancing the audio. We truly believe this is probably the best viewer experience during these conditions but ultimately there are a lot of peers who feel strongly that they would prefer to hear it with the stadium sound. So for the majority of the matches, we will be providing an alternate for them via our streaming platform. If you want to just hear the stadium sound via our streaming services, you can watch that broadcast and be able to watch those matches, and on our linear channels and broadcast, we will be providing enhanced audio.”\n\nThe Radio Hall of Fame recently announced 2020 nominees include the pioneering Suzyn Waldman. How about a podcast or interview with Suzyn? – Kaitlyn M.\n\nExcellent suggestion. I’ll see what I can do. This week’s podcast is with ESPN’s Marly Rivera, who is another baseball reporting pioneer.\n\nWith the major changes announced this week at ESPN, Mike Golic Sr. got most of the attention. But ESPN trimmed an hour off of Dan Le Batard’s morning show to make room for Mike Greenberg’s new radio program. Is it a hint to Le Batard to “start looking” since his contract is up in two years? I know they had discussed moving Le Batard’s radio program to “satellite only” or some such and getting it out of the “terrestrial radio lineup” and I also see that his podcast network continues to top the charts of downloads. Was ESPN’s plan to just let Le Batard say what he wanted, only not really on their airwaves? Le Batard provides the most interesting sports show on the ESPN lineup (especially with no sports). – Mark H\n\nCan you explain ESPN’s handling of Dan Le Batard? His show is its top radio property and they decide to cut his show down an hour to placate Mike Greenberg. Then they move HQ to a dead time slot. Are they expecting him to leave after his contract runs out? – Matthew N.\n\nAs I wrote last week, ESPN’s decision to reduce the Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz show by an hour nationally was perplexing given the show’s popularity in the podcast/on-demand audio space. The network literally put out a press release last week that trumpeted the show as one of the most-listened-to sports podcasts based on Podtrac and Rawvoice. Personalization is going to be a trend in the sports media over the next decade. That’s sort of the entire thesis of on-demand — you control when you want to listen. So a show like Le Batard’s should be perceived by any legacy company as valuable given the loyal audience, even if the show veers into topics that make a corporation uncomfortable. The easiest advice would be for ESPN management to leave the show (and the shows that run as part of its content universe) alone and focus its attention elsewhere.\n\nWhat’s next for Josina Anderson after leaving ESPN? I thought she was talented enough to carry her own show(ESPN 2 or +) and never got the opportunity. Also, is Wendi Nix done with ESPN? She was only associated with NFL Live. – Victor E.\n\nNix said she’ll be working on other projects at ESPN that she’ll announce soon. I’m not sure what’s next for Anderson but given her NFL contacts, I’d be surprised if she is not covering that league for some outlet.\n\nDo you think this could create a permanent precedent in terms of sports coverage? If announcers are not on sight, the only part of the game they cannot speak of is the atmosphere. –Nick G.\n\nI think the immediate future and beyond will see a reduction of announcers on-site, specific to mid-level and lower-level matchups. This will be a result of the lost revenue due to COVID-19 as well as a reset of the industry as a way to cost-cut. It will hurt broadcasts but I think outlets are willing to live with any criticism in exchange for savings. This isn’t going to impact week to week NFL or home games for MLB but I can definitely see the majority of non-Power 5 college conference getting called from a studio.\n\nHi, Richard. You are Daryl Johnston. You’ve been with Fox seemingly forever. You used to call Fox’s top game with Troy Aikman in a three-man booth, then slid to the No. 2 team for many years with Kenny Albert and Tony Siragusa. Fox keeps bringing you back but sliding you further down the line, to the point where you spent 2019 with Chris Myers on around the No. 5 team, destined to be in Arizona, Washington, or up until this year, Tampa Bay. Now, Fox tells you that you’re going to keep Greg Olsen’s seat warm, working with Kevin Burkhardt on the No. 2 team until Olsen is ready to take your place in the booth. Are you: a) grateful for the high profile opportunity and continued employment; b) seething over Fox’s treatment of you; or c) utterly confused about all of this? – Adam V\n\nGreat question. If I am Daryl Johnston, I let my bosses know that I am willing to do anything they need and where I am in the pecking order does not bother me? Why? Because I have a lottery ticket job and I am trying to keep that lottery ticket job as someone who last played in the league 21 years ago and wants to hold off any fresh face taking my spot. So a) all the way.\n\nThanks for providing this forum for your readers. Any details/stories from the broadcast technicians who have had to endure the loss of work due to sports going away?\n\nAlso, any thoughts on ranking the best production duos (producers/directors) or the four major leagues, college football and college basketball at the regional and national levels? – Andre H.\n\nA.J. Perez of Front Office Sports wrote a very good piece on the impact of COVID-19 on production people in broadcast sports. As for the best production duos, from my experience being in trucks and interviewing hundreds of people over the years, most of the people who reach any network or top cable level are terrific at what they do. The “A” crews in particular are very good. For example, the top NFL teams of NBC (producer Fred Gaudelli and Drew Esocoff), CBS (producer Jim Rikhoff and Mike Arnold) and Fox (Richie Zyontz and Rich Russo) are exceptional.\n\nTop Rank boxing has severely underperformed as one of the few live sports back. Their ratings have dropped off a cliff. Have you heard rumblings of ESPN’s concerns given these are fights airing in prime time multiple times a week and what could ESPN do if they find themselves with a property that’s seen a yearly decrease in ratings for the past three years now? – Dusty R\n\nHere’s The Athletic’s boxing writer, Mike Coppinger, for some insight:\n\nI’m told ESPN executives are underwhelmed with the ratings performance of Top Rank Boxing. The shows, airing each Tuesday and Thursday since last month, have no live sport competition yet have failed to pull in average ratings exceeding 400,000 viewers (excluding a Saturday title fight featuring Miguel Berchelt). UFC President Dana White has joked that Top Rank is being out-rated by Cornhole.\n\nOne issue is the length of the program – it’s often a four-hour block. With so many fights that are not meant for television, there are lots of mismatches and plenty of dead air. The main issue, in my view, are main events that are not compelling. Top Rank had a golden opportunity as the only boxing outfit back and it’s largely been squandered with fights that fail to move the needle. Top Rank has often blamed the pandemic and it’s quite a challenge staging events in this climate, so the company deserves plenty of credit for figuring out a way to hold fights safely (especially when no other major American promoter has yet returned). But its last scheduled title fight pre-pandemic was a mismatch between Shakur Stevenson and Miguel Marriaga.\n\nTop Rank’s original four-year rights deal with ESPN – signed in 2017 – was extended in 2018 into a seven-year pact that runs through 2025. When Top Rank delivers big fights, viewers tune in. The first fight of the deal – Manny Pacquiao versus Jeff Horn – pulled in an average of 3.8 million viewers. The network will need more fights like that if the deal is going to be extended again.\n\nMichelle Beadle was at one point one of the hottest young media people around. Now she can’t be found anywhere. Will she resurface at some point, if so, where is a place that might be a good fit for her? – Steve B.\n\nIf Beadle never worked in the sports media again she’s already won the lottery. She had high-profile jobs, great assignments and made millions of dollars including a nice buyout from ESPN. She’s just 44, with decades in front of her. If she stays in sports, I hope she goes into the audio space in some form. I always thought she was great on audio/radio — sharp and smart.\n\nWho do you think is behind the @NBABubbleLife account on Twitter? – Deven P\n\nSomeone incredibly dedicated to the craft.\n\nHow is podcast success measured? What kind of numbers are considered a success? Why such an emphasis on ‘five-star reviews’ that so many podcasters consistently plead for? Don’t the providers have better technology (downloads?) than that? I love your podcast, and have listened to it for years. Robert Klemko, Katie Strang, Kurt Streeter, John Ourand, I read them all now and I listen to James Andrew Miller, too, and I buy and read his books and so on thanks to you. Can’t someone somewhere see the value in a podcast without listeners having to consistently write reviews? Not that I begrudge you (and others) a review. I just wonder why numbers aren’t enough. What am I missing here? please and thanks. – David W.\n\nFirst, thanks for listening. It means a lot, especially given that my podcast will always be niche compared to a sport-specific or broader sports podcast. The metrics question is always tricky because success is going to be different for everyone. You can make a nice bit of change if you average 50,000 downloads per episode but most podcasts in the podcast universe do not draw that. If you draw high six-figure or seven-figure downloads per episode, you can sell ads against that and make millions. The reason why the reviews and star rankings are important are because advertisers and/or media buyers look at them, as do the podcast companies that produce podcasts (such as mine). They are also very valuable in terms of drawing new listeners. And new listeners/subscribers is a major part of Apple’s algorithm when it comes to ranking podcasts weekly.\n\nHey Richard! I’ve read it takes about three months to break a habit. If sports don’t return until 2021, what percentage of people do you think will not go back to watching them? – Matt W\n\nWe love sports. Nearly everyone who watched previously will watch again, and the demand will likely be greater because of the absence.\n\nDo you think the dissolution of the Golic & Wingo show essentially was to dump another high salary from ESPN. I read elsewhere that Golic made several million dollars a year. Who will ESPN use to fill Zubin Mehenti’s spot on SportsCenter? He was a really valuable “utility player” who would fill any shift, any time. And will the Los Angeles SportsCenter people be returning? They haven’t been seen for over four months. – Judith V.\n\nTwo questions – 1) What are your thoughts on Jason Whitlock moving to Outkick? 2) Do you see Mike Golic leaving ESPN? — Matthew S.\n\nI did a long piece last week on Golic, including discussing his immediate future. He’s going to serve as a college football analyst for ESPN as well as make occasional stops on his son’s new 4-7 PM ET show with Chiney Ogwumike. I don’t see Golic leaving ESPN in the near-term. I think he and his reps will find a way to make a deal work, which is good for both parties. Whitlock will certainly add audience and attention for his new site. I think you will see more national voices in sports this decade go direct to the consumer outside of legacy media. Per ESPN: There is no firm date yet for the return of the SportsCenter edition from Los Angeles. The last one was March 15. There will be no singular person replacing Mehenti on SportsCenter. His spot will be filled from the SportsCenter anchor pool and there’s a possibility Mehenti will still do SportsCenter occasionally after his radio show starts.\n\nRealizing the world can still change in a major way, what’s your sense about where the NHL will land on American television when the current negotiations end? Might it be the first major pro sports league to put part of its rights on a streaming service? – Michael P.\n\nAlways bet on major pro sports rights deal going up. The NHL is in a great position and I think they will get a mega-increase from NBC and bring in a second media rights partner that will include streaming. The big package remains on cable and NBC.\n\nWhat was your opinion on the Washington Post’s story on the culture inside the Washington NFL team? Also, did you find it strange that other media were hinting or theorizing at the Post’s report for a few days on social media before it dropped? Seems like they were giving the Post plenty of free publicity. I would think they would have been other there trying to figure out what the report was themselves. – Michael P.\n\nRhiannon Walker’s piece on the Alex Santos harassment will surely be one of your suggested “reads” this week. She did a really good job conveying the hurtfulness of the incident(s) while not sounding bitter. She may be worried about being hurt by the incident, but her courage is right there for the world to see and I feel she is greatly enhanced by the way she told her story. – Bruce B.\n\nI thought the reporting by Liz Clarke and Will Hobson was phenomenal and I have so much respect for the bravery and strength of my colleague Rhiannon Walker. This piece by Paul Fahri of The Washington Post on sports media people talking around the piece prior to publication is worth reading.\n\nI stopped the renewal in early March of my MLB.TV when it became obvious that the season was in jeopardy. MLB.TV is now charging $60 for the reduced 60 game season. No mention of their refund policy for what happens if the 60 game season is stopped. I have sent inquiries to MLB.TV several times with no response. Having been burnt on some travel refunds not coming back to me, I will not subscribe without a reasonable policy being published. Perhaps someone from the media can force this. It may be a good topic for one of your regular posts. – Andrew M.\n\nHere’s a piece from Yahoo Sports’s Chris Cwik on MLB TV this year.\n\nDo you have any inside info on how the NHL and NBA will broadcast there upcoming playoff games – Phil S.\n\nLook for both leagues to announce a mess of plans on the television coverage very soon. The NBA will have multiple announce teams in the bubble from ESPN and TNT so the sound will be familiar.\n\nRichard, what exactly is CBS’s plan with regard to CBS Sports Network? What purpose does it serve? While I get they want to use Champions League and Europa League soccer to drive sales of the All-Access service why wouldn’t CBS Sports Network play a bigger role than it seems it’s going to in that coverage? – David V.\n\nCBS has inventory with some scale (college basketball, college football, WNBA, PBR) and there is value in having a cable outlet to place some of that inventory on air as well as a place to experiment with content. The network is in roughly 60 million homes and isn’t rated by Nielsen so it’s not viewership-driven. It’s not big money play for Viacom/CBS.\n\nFirst, thanks for the great columns. Always enjoy your content, especially the articles you link in Media Circus. I am wondering what the general trend for salaries of on-air talent for ESPN has been over the past year given the continuing decline in subs and whether some of the deals like the Mike Greenberg deal would look dramatically different if they came up today. Thanks for the insight. – Jeff N.\n\nTalent salaries are coming down at ESPN, especially for on-air talent not fronting a property on a daily basis. COVID-19 has a lot to do with that, in addition to the larger business trends. Just a guess: If Greenberg was attempting to sign for “Get Up!” today, his annual salary would be significantly less but still in the millions given it’s a daily show on main ESPN. Read this on the show from 2018. It feels like another century.\n\nThe Ink Report\n\n1. The quality of sports podcasts has never been higher and I wanted to note two thoughtful audio projects that have debuted over the past month:\n\nFirst, longtime sports journalist Nancy Armour, who currently works as a sports columnist for USA Today, is hosting “Changing The Game with Nancy Armour,” a podcast featuring interviews with women who have revolutionized sports. Among those featured so far: Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez, former Notre Dame women’s basketball coach Muffet McGraw, and ESPN broadcaster Doris Burke.\n\n“It’s no secret there’s a lack of women’s voices in our society, sports in particular, and I saw ‘Changing the Game’ as a chance to amplify them,” Armour said. “We decided the focus would be on women using their roles in sports to effect change and move us closer to equality. Because this is a new podcast, we obviously wanted some big names who could generate interest. But we wanted women who aren’t sports fans to see themselves in the guests, to have what they heard in the interviews resonate in their own lives, and each guest was selected with that goal in mind. So we not only were intentional about the diversity of our guests — age, race, sport — but also mindful that each of the women provides a unique voice on the issues that are challenges for all women.\n\n“(Podcast subject) Nneka Ogwumike, the president of the WNBA’s players association, describing the importance of players believing in themselves and their worth can be instructive for women asking for raises or bonuses in their own jobs. Any woman who’s tried to make a name for herself independent of her spouse or her family, or even her co-workers, can identify with Cheyenne Woods talking about the need to establish her own identity as a golfer outside her very famous uncle. McGraw’s outrage at the very slow climb women are making up the ladder in sports, politics, business, you name it, is what every woman lives every day. The protests that followed George Floyd’s death have made the entire country reckon with systemic racism, but it’s also forced us to confront other forms of discrimination. Chelsea Wolfe shared the challenges and abuse she’s encountered as a trans athlete. Simone Manuel explained why it’s so important that all athletes, not just those of color, speak out against bigotry and hate. Tierna Davidson described the greater good that comes from athletes using their platforms on behalf of marginalized groups. There are so many places in life where women are shouted down or tuned out. Changing the Game provides a place for them to be heard.”\n\nThe newest ESPN 30 for 30 Podcast is a deep dive into the lives and influence of Bela and Martha Karolyi, the famous gymnastic coaches who fostered a culture of silence within their orbit.\n\nThe seven-episode series – “Heavy Medals: Inside the Karolyi Gymnastics Empire” – was reported by ESPN senior writers Bonnie Ford and Alyssa Roenigk, produced by Andrew Mambo and Meradith Hoddinott. and overseen by 30 for 30 Podcasts’ Senior Editorial Producer Julia Lowrie Henderson.\n\n“The scope of the story was way too big for one reporter,” said Ford. “I knew there was one other journalist at ESPN who could and would tackle this in the deep way it deserved. Alyssa Roenigk has granular knowledge of gymnastics and she’d covered the U.S. team since 2008. I knew she was methodical, tireless, compassionate, and ethical – and would be the best partner to create the kind of trust we would need from interviewees. The scale of Larry Nassar’s horrific crimes became evident in 2016 and 2017, thanks to excellent journalism from the IndyStar and others, and the courage of the survivors. National and international coverage understandably focused on Nassar himself and the various institutions that bore responsibility, including Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics.\n\n“The Karolyis’ system and the conditions at their Ranch were called into question – not for the first time – while they remained mostly silent, other than in court filings and one television interview. Alyssa and I wanted to step back and focus on the entire 40-year sweep of the Karolyis’ career. We wanted to understand why and how they got results, what motivated them, how they gained and consolidated power, and what part they specifically played in shaping coaching culture. We mapped out a game plan with producers Andrew Mambo and Meradith Hoddinott and really dug into the project in the fall of 2019. We cast a giant net out to gymnasts and coaches from the 1970s on, along with parents, administrators and journalists. Bela and Martha are still very polarizing figures. Athletes had varying experiences with them and different perceptions of whether their own paths as gymnasts were worth it or not. Some had distinct relationships with each of the Karolyis. That was a revelation. Before we started reporting, we tended to think of them as joined at the hip.”\n\nFord said the pandemic restricted travel for interviews but all told they were able to complete about 100 interviews on and off the record for this project. What does the reporter hope the listener takes away from the series?\n\n“This story is about power, institutional dysfunction, coaching culture, the definition of “winning,’’ and societal priorities,” Ford said. “One of my passions in the field has been reporting on athlete mental health, athletes’ rights and international sport governance, which overall to this day excludes athletes. Those issues have pervaded the last few decades of elite gymnastics, which are synonymous with the Karolyi era. This should be obvious, but it’s especially crucial to examine elite sports that enlist children as workers. Everything about that picture needs to be challenged, and we in the media also need to look ourselves in the mirror in the process. I hope the takeaway questions for “Heavy Medals” listeners during this pause in Olympic sport are: Are we finally ready to face the toll elite gymnastics has taken on so many for so long? What needs to happen in that sport and all of youth sport to make it safer and healthier? I admire the strength and grace and mental discipline of these athletes, but they’ve been asked to be too strong, to tolerate and absorb way too much. And this isn’t a uniquely American issue. I know there are progressive coaches out there trying to do the right thing at the grassroots, college, and elite levels. It’s going to take a critical mass of those coaches, plus parents and former athletes, to demand and bring about change.”\n\n2. Episode 107 of the Sports Media Podcast with Richard Deitsch features three guests. First up is ESPN national MLB writer Marly Rivera. Next is James Andrew Miller, the best-selling author of books on CAA, ESPN and Saturday Night Live the host of the “Origins” podcast. His latest project is a deep dive into the Cameron Crowe classic coming-of-age-film, “Almost Famous.” He is followed by agent Steve Herz, the president of The Montag Group and the author of a new book, “Don’t Take Yes for an Answer: Using Authority, Warmth, and Energy to Get Exceptional Results.”\n\nRivera discusses her piece on Black MLB players past and present on what needs to change; how a piece like that gets put together at ESPN; covering MLB amid COVID-19, the recent New York Times piece featuring ESPN employees criticizing the career pipeline and diversity of top leadership, and more. Miller discusses Wojnarowski’s suspension by ESPN for tweeting “f— you” to a U.S. Senator; leaks at ESPN; whether this was selective discipline by ESPN; what this means for president Jimmy Pitaro heading forward in terms of discipline and much more. Herz discusses his new book and why he wrote it; the importance of Authority, Warmth and Energy; how COVID-19 has impacted the talent market right now and how it might 18 months down the road; how he advises clients on the intersection of politics and race and social media; what he would say to a young person who wants to enter the business and much more.\n\nYou can subscribe to this podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Stitcher and more.\n\n3.
