        "text": "Welcome to my cooking measurements rant. I really admire people who can bake. I am not one of them (or rarely am successful).\n\nUnderstanding Cooking Measurements in Portugal\n\nHave you ever found a recipe for a cake or some muffins that looked exciting, so you get everything ready, start to measure everything according to the recipe and realize some things need to be converted from ounces to grams, and you say to yourself it’s not a problem and do a quick online search for a conversion guide or online converter and follow the measurements there. No bother right?\n\nFirst, you notice the batter is looking weird or doesn’t rise properly, then it tastes burnt or bland or the whole thing goes wrong.\n\nThen you look back and try to figure out what went wrong and you realise… the recipe was American but you converted English units into metric. Following that you converted ml to g. Anyone?\n\nThis post was meant to be a simple guide to Portuguese measuring sizes in cooking. But it’s turned into a complicated rant instead! If you would rather skip the drama and head straight to the vocabulary, either scroll down towards the end of this post or please click here.\n\nHaving lived most of my life in Portugal and being raised with mostly the metric system, understanding measurements in recipes can sometimes be difficult to get right, given all the different volume sizes for cups alone. But I’m starting to think that the confusion isn’t just the different measurement systems or the language barriers.. but it is over-simplistic or incomplete and /or unreviewed conversion guides that are the problem. Especially when going from millilitres to grams and vice versa. And don’t get me started and halving and doubling measurements!\n\nThe Cup Confusion\n\nTake butter for instance… in some recipes, they mention ounces, some mention grams, and others talk about sticks of butter. In Portugal, cooking butter or margarine is measured in sticks of 50g and comes marked as such on the packaging. But 1 stick butter = ½ cup = 4 ounces = 113 grams. (but which size cup?) If we have no scales to confirm we end up having to “eyeball” 113 g of butter. But that’s not too difficult if you have a package that is marked in 50g sections. The problem begins if I have unmarked margarine and only a cup in millilitres…\n\nMoreover, as I’m trying to look these guides up online, I’m confronted with the first problem – if not stated – what cup size is the recipe talking about? Are they UK cups? American? Australian? Metric?\n\nOvercoming the Cup Conundrum\n\nThe official sizes are:\n\nUK 284ml, American technically 236.6ml but officially has been rounded up to 240ml;\n\nAustralia favours the metric cup which is 250ml. And ignore the nationality of the author because that, whilst a good starting place, is not always a sure-fire way of know what sizes they in fact chose.\n\nNow throw in Portuguese “soup spoons” and “xícaras” or “chávenas” and it becomes next to impossible. I’m sure some of you can relate.\n\nUnveiling the Complexity\n\nSimple solution? Not likely…\n\nI have read in some of these guides (both Portuguese and English) that one can apply the simple conversion which is to assume a cup is a standard cup (250ml) and generally speaking, 1ml = 1g Right?\n\nOMG…I have found out the hard way this is NOT the f@%*ing same. This never works for me. I’ve applied this in the past and failed. Miserably.\n\nFrom what I can understand, this only applies to water. Common sense fails me – one “cup” (250ml) of sugar does NOT weigh the same as a “cup” (250ml) of flour… how could it? Granulated sugar does not have the same density as flour and therefore can’t weigh the same. In Portuguese, I’m confronted with the same issue too as it seems no cooking page, blog or book can agree on whether the “chávena” equals to 250 ml, 240 ml or 200 ml.\n\nEven within the same guides, I’ve come across contradictions. They will say one chávena is 250 ml But right under it will say one chávena equals 16 tablespoons and that each table soup is 15ml, BUT:\n\n16 x 15 is 240 ml!!!! what is going on?? It shouldn’t be this difficult.\n\nOf course, a potential explanation for this is if the recipe is written in Brazilian or in European Portuguese. Regardless if the dish is in fact traditionally from Portugal! Or even if it’s being translated from European English or American English…but even that doesn’t work because I’ve found Brazilian and Portuguese guides with the same problem. I’ve seen xícaras at 200ml, 240ml and 250ml.. this is so frustrating.\n\nDry vs. Wet Measuring Cups\n\nAdding to all this mega confusion – all the other measurements don’t work either..it doesn’t help that in general American pints and ounces are not the same as European ones…and then we have the metric system trying to make sense of it all but sometimes just makes it even more complicated.\n\nConfused yet? I’m not sure if I understand it all myself hahaha I’m probably overthinking this WAY too much.\n\nFinding Clarity\n\nOne thing seems to be certain… no one in these guides, seemingly, has actually measured the ingredients to check if they actually measure what they are saying they do and they don’t seem to read over the guide themselves having just copied it from somewhere else. I say this because I did a small experiment of my own and ended up with different results from all these guides.\n\nFor example, according to the majority of the measurement conversion guides I found, 1 cup (250 ml) of sugar weighs 160 g, one cup (250 ml) of wheat flour weighs 120g And one cup (250 ml) of raw rice weighs 210 g.\n\nHowever when I tested this my sugar weighed 232gr, my flour 161g and my rice weighed 237 g (all measured with the same cup and I used the same digital precision scales) Maybe you can get away with this in general cooking, but for baking, I don’t think these are small negligible differences. What am I missing here?\n\nA Helpful List\n\nWell, my friends I dug a little deeper and reached some conclusions. The main one is that the measuring conversion guides are incomplete. They lack important information on specific ingredients such as, if the sugar is white, brown, granulated, powdered etc. They all just say “sugar”. How compact is the flour? What type are they talking about (all purpose, T45, T65 etc). You get the idea.\n\nThe other big conclusion was that many times there is an unspoken or unmentioned detail in some of these recipes: there is a difference between DRY measuring cups and WET measuring cups…. People like me are confused about the use of DRY vs WET measuring cups. After spending loads of hours looking up all these sizes and guides, I think I can say that most dry measuring cups are 250 ml and most wet measuring cups are 240 ml.\n\nConclusion\n\nBut of course people, including myself, won’t think about that and just use the same measuring cup they have (whatever size it is, usually 250 ml).\n\nHowever, it’s advisable to figure out in what language the recipe is in and what version (American, English, other) of it first. And try to keep everything in the system from that language. But of course that is easier said than done. If you only have measuring utensils in the “wrong” system. Or you’re following a recipe from another country IN another country that doesn’t use the same system. I often find myself in this situation. Thankfully, for the most part that I’ve observed, most recipes nowadays have included ready made conversions or are in the metric system.\n\nAdditional Cooking Vocabulary\n\nWhen you see “xícaras”, it’s safe to assume this is Brazilian Portuguese. Although it’s a word also used in Portugal, it is much more common in Brazil. Therefore one tea cup is typically 240 ml unless otherwise stated. If in European Portuguese then the recipe will usually talk in “chávenas” (also tea cup) and that typically means 250 ml, again, unless otherwise stated. All mention of “soup spoons” (tablespoons) and teaspoons follow the same sizes as Ireland and the U.K. (sizes below)\n\nSo does this mean we all have to dump all our measuring cups and scales, of course not, but finding a precise measuring guide will not be easy unless you test it out yourself first. Let me know in the comments below how you use conversion guides if any!\n\nBut in the meantime to spare you some of the misery regarding Portuguese cooking terms and vocabulary, I’ve compiled a list below with relevant information:\n\nMeasurements guide:\n\nChávena = tea cup in Portugal, in other words, = 250 ml Unless otherwise stated.\n\nXícara = tea cup in Brazil, in other words, = 240 ml Unless otherwise stated.\n\n1 colher de sopa = “1 soup spoon” = 1 tablespoon = 15 ml\n\n1 colher de chá = 1 tea spoon = 5 ml\n\n1 colher de sobremesa = 1 “dessert spoon” = 10 ml\n\n1 colher de café = 1 coffee spoon = 2 ml\n\n1 dl = one decilitre = 100 ml\n\nrasa = “flat” meaning level or to level\n\nprato fundo nivelado = deep plate to level = 200 g\n\nq.b. = quanto baste = literally “as much is enough” = meaning = “to taste”\n\n1 pitada de = a pinch of\n\nOther relevant cooking vocabulary\n\ndentes de alho = “teeth” of garlic (garlic cloves)\n\nralado = shredded / crumbs (queijo ralado = shredded cheese / pão ralado = bread crumbs)\n\nmoído = ground or minced\n\nlamidados = laminated\n\ncongelados = frozen\n\nfrescos = depends on context. It can refer to fresh produce, like fresh herbs for example, but if it’s regarding a liquid, then it means cold (água fresca = cold water).\n\nRodelas = round slices (e.g. pineapple slices = rodelas de ananás / sliced olives = azeitonas em rodelas)\n\nfatias = sliced\n\nfatiado = sliced\n\npicado = finely chopped or diced\n\ncasca = shell or peel\n\nposta = a cut piece or slice of meat or fish\n\nlombos = loins\n\ncostoletas = chops\n\nlume = fire / heat source in this case\n\nVerbs:\n\ncozinhar = to cook\n\ncozer = to bake\n\nferver = to boil and/or bringing to a boil\n\nassar = to roast in the oven or on the grill\n\ngrelhar = to grill\n\nfritar = to fry\n\nescalfar = to poach\n\nestufar = to stew\n\nmexer = to stir\n\nmisturar = to mix\n\nbater = to beat or to whisk\n\namassar = to knead\n\nestender a massa = to roll out pastry\n\ndescascar = to peel\n\ndissolver = to dissolve\n\ndeitar = to pour (in this context)\n\njuntar / adicionar = to add\n\nretirar = remove\n\npôr / colocar = to put or to place\n\nescorrer = to drain or to strain\n\nmacerar = to macerate\n\nesmagar = to squash or to crush\n\nreduzir a puré = to puree or to mash\n\npicar = to chop or to dice\n\nfatiar = to slice\n\ncortar = to cut\n\nlavar = to wash\n\npreparar = to prepare\n\ntorrar = to toast\n\nespalhar = to spread\n\nFor a print out please click here and for audio please watch the video below.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nAdelina"
