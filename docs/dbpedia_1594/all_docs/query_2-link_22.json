The shape of the pumpkin is variable, but it is usually ovoid or oblong. The rind is usually orange, but it can have other colors depending on the species. The bright orange color of the pumpkin contains a high content of carotenes, particularly beta-carotene, with antioxidant action. Beta carotene is then converted into vitamin A in the body.\n\nAlmonds - Trás-os-Montes Region, Portugal.\n\nThe blackberry is a fruit of Asian origin that was later imported to Europe in the 17th century before being cultivated in other continents. Perhaps because it is a very fragile fruit, its production was largely reduced to domestic production. The blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) is the fruit (pseudoberry) of shrubs commonly known as brambles, of the Rosaceae family. Their shape gives them a very delicate texture that almost melts in the mouth. They have a sweet fragrance with a subtly acidic touch.\n\nNutmeg is one of the most appreciated and valued spices since antiquity for its aromatic, aphrodisiac and healing properties. The nutmeg fruit is a drupe, the size of an apricot. When it ripens, it divides and presents a seed surrounded by Nutmeg and Mace, and a lacy red layer known as “mace”. Mace is also marketed as a spice. Both nutmeg seed and mace are spices that contain many antioxidant chemical compounds known to act in disease prevention and health promotion.\n\nThe brandy produced from the best Portuguese grapes, has a unique aroma and flavor that results from the distillation of grapes from the Arinto, Periquita, Trincadeira and Fernão Pires varieties.\n\nBlueberries grow in clusters and range in size from the equivalent of a small pea to that of a marble. They have an intense color that ranges from blue, brown and black-purple and include soft gray-white flowers that cover the surface of the berries and serve as a protective layer. The skin surrounds a semi-transparent integument that surrounds small seeds."
