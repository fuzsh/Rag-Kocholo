        "text": "Most visitors to Portugal will try at least one pastel de nata, the creamy custard tart that originated in Belé.\n\nTip: If you’d like to try your hand at making these iconic tarts, book your place on a Pastel de Nata workshop in an authentic Lisbon bakery.\n\nWhile we fond of these custardy treats, we prefer a queijada, a light tart made with cheese, or the wickedly indulgent três delicias from the Algarve with its layers of carob, fig and almond.\n\nWe discovered the joys of octopus. Polvo à lagareiro has remained our Portuguese dish of choice all these years. It’s steamed octopus baked in the oven with tiny baked potatoes and garlic, all drowned in olive oil.\n\nAlso rather partial to sapateira recheada, which is a sauce of pureed crab meat served in its shell.\n\nThe most popular food in Portugal is probably bacalhau (dried salted cod). Don’t worry. By the time it reaches your plate, it will have been soaked and rinsed and should not taste salty, although sometimes it hasn’t been rinsed quite enough to remove all the salt flavour.\n\nWe like bacalhau à casa, which, around Goís and Arganil at least, means battered and fried and served surrounded by thin discs of fried potatoes and covered in an onion sauce. Bacalhau com broa is another firm favourite – baked cod fillet served on a bed of turnip top greens (grelos), topped with broa breadcrumbs and served with tiny baked potatoes drizzled with olive oil (batatas à murro).\n\nOne of the best meat experiences we had in Portugal has got to be naco na pedra. This is a thick chunk of quality beef steak served on a sizzling hot stone.\n\nWhen it reaches your table, the outside will usually have been seared but it will continue to cook for as long as it stays on the stone. If you prefer your steak well done, you’ll need to slice it so it cooks through before the stone cools. Otherwise, tuck in.\n\nSoup is an integral part of the Portuguese diet and when you eat in restaurants, this is often where you’ll get your vegetables. Although caldo verde (kale soup) is hugely popular, not overly fond of the texture and it’s not our favourite Portuguese soup.\n\nGive us Alentejan tomato soup any day. It could easily be a meal in itself, thanks to the bread and poached egg it contains. This tasty recipe is a great way of using up stale bread.\n\nThe closest translation for enchido is sausage but Portuguese enchidos are a world apart from British sausages. The traditional way of making sure none of a family’s slaughtered pig goes to waste is to cure the resulting meat products by hanging and smoking.\n\nThe most well-known enchido is probably chouriço, a paprika sausage that’s often flambéed at the table or added to other dishes for flavour and colour.\n\nIt came as a surprise to find that we are partial to a good quality morcela, a blood sausage which is similar to black pudding. When served on a bed of cooked apples, it’s quite a treat."
