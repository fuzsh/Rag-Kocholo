        "text": "Salted truffles with ricotta and pistachio are delicious fast-finger food, ideal for an appetizer with friends. These little balls do not need to be cooked, are covered with pistachio flour and chopped pistachios, and are perfect for a tasty and fast snack! Are also ideal for a super simple last-minute appetizer for a Christmas party.\n\nThe recipe is so easy and fast that you can also prepare it together with your kids.\n\nIn a bowl, just put the ingredients, mix and form the cheese balls. You can enrich the salted truffles with the ingredients you prefer, such as chopped hazelnuts, sesame seeds, almonds, spices, herbs, cold cuts, and your favorite cheeses.\n\nIn this recipe, I also used some bread to make them even richer, then I added ricotta, but if you want, you can also use mascarpone or robiola, all flavored with parmesan and pistachio.\n\nThey are delicious, and one leads to another.\n\nWhat is ricotta?\n\nRicotta is a dairy product obtained by heating, with or without acidifiers, the whey residual from the cheese processing (re-cooked).\n\nSince it is not produced from curd but from its by-product (whey), ricotta cannot be considered a real cheese.\n\nIn various languages, ricotta is known as:\n\nwhey cheese or whey protein cheese in English-speaking countries\n\nserac or recuit or brousse in the French-speaking ones\n\nrequeson in Spain\n\nrequeijao in Portugal\n\nThe term ricotta usually means the fresh one.\n\nFresh ricotta has the typical truncated cone shape of the perforated containers in which it is left to drain. Of a more or less candid white color, depending on the type of milk used, it has a fairly soft and grainy consistency, not elastic nor hard.\n\nThe smell of fresh ricotta is of warm milk and hay (the latter is more intense in products made from sheep’s milk and even more so in buffalo milk).\n\nThe weight is variable and can vary, depending on the type, from 100 g to several kilograms.\n\nIn general, despite its humble origins, cow’s milk ricotta is perhaps the noblest of all dairy products today. It has an average energy intake (comparable to that of medium-fat meat or a lean salami), supplied mainly by fats, followed by proteins, and finally by carbohydrates.\n\nWhat are pistachios?\n\nThe scientific name of the pistachio is “Pistacia vera”, a fruit tree that belongs to the Anacardiaceae family. This tree reaches a height of about ten meters and produces the seed, enclosed in a typical woody shell that ripens at the end of summer. Pistachio originates from the East, although today, it is also grown in California, Spain, Italy, and many other areas of the Mediterranean.\n\nPistachios are rich in fiber, they counteract anemia and constipation, lower cholesterol, and promote a good mood. Pistachios are an extraordinary natural cure-all for our health.\n\nNever miss a recipe\n\nNow let’s see how to make these salted truffles with ricotta and pistachio!\n\nIngredients for 10 truffles:\n\n1 slice soft sandwich bread\n\n120 g ricotta\n\n30 g Parmigiano Reggiano\n\n50 g pistachio flour\n\nsalt\n\nFor the coating:\n\npistachio flour\n\nchopped pistachios\n\nHow to do these Salted Truffles with Ricotta and Pistachio recipe step-by-step\n\nTo prepare the Salted Truffles with Ricotta and Pistachio, break the slice of bread with your hands and place it in a bowl.\n\nAdd the ricotta, parmesan, and salt.\n\nMix everything with your fingertips until you get a compact dough.\n\nAdd the pistachio flour to the bread and ricotta mixture and mix well.\n\nForm the cheese balls with your hands, pass them in the pistachio flour and the chopped pistachios.\n\nPut the truffles in the refrigerator for 1 hour before serving.\n\nEnjoy them!\n\nSubstitutions\n\nYou can replace the ricotta with mascarpone, robiola, or Philadelphia.\n\nYou can add chopped mortadella that goes great with pistachios.\n\nYou can enrich them with the spices you prefer.\n\nStorage\n\nSalted Truffles with Ricotta and Pistachio can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.\n\nDid you make this recipe? I want to see it! Tag @popsiclesociety on Instagram.\n\nHappy cooking! Happy eating!"
