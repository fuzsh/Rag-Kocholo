        "text": "5. Microbiological Aspects\n\nAlthough the microbiological quality of artisanal cheeses does not depend exclusively on the pasteurization of milk, this is undoubtedly the main controversy surrounding the safety of these products. Pasteurization guarantees the safety of cheeses because it eliminates (or significantly reduces) all potential pathogenic bacteria which could be present in the raw milk. On the other hand, it significantly reduces the presence of natural microorganisms found in milk (beneficial microbiota), which are associated with the typical characteristics and flavor of artisanal cheeses made with raw milk. Raw milk can be considered as a source of beneficial microbes as well. The sanitary control of the herd, the standardization of the manufacturing process, and the Food Safety Management System (FSMS) implementation are possibly the support of the quality and safety of cheeses made with raw milk. The reduction of pH, removal of water, and addition of salt during cheese manufacturing, whether made from raw or pasteurized milk, are conditions that favor the safety of cheeses.\n\nIn spite of this, cheeses produced with raw milk may constitute a suitable medium for the growth of pathogens often associated with food-borne diseases. Additionally, the lack of standardization in manufacturing, especially regarding the time of coagulation, natural starter used, curd treatment, pressing, and salting, affect the composition of the final product and, consequently, its safety. Thus, in the market, it is possible to find artisanal cheeses from the same variety with different sensory, physicochemical, and microbiological characteristics [55,56].\n\nIn relation to the microbiological aspects of Brazilian artisanal cheese, most of the studies are concentrated on artisanal Minas cheese, probably because of its economic significance. In contrast, studies about the microbiological quality of milk and other artisanal cheese produced in Brazil are scarce. Moreover, most of the studies related to artisanal Minas cheese focus on some specific producers and it is frequently very difficult to draw conclusions about the microbiological composition of beneficial and spoilage microorganisms, including some pathogens.\n\nDifferent LAB strains isolated from Brazilian cheeses were evaluated and proposed/classified as beneficial organisms as well as confirmed to be able to provide health benefits to consumers by producing antimicrobial metabolites and contributing to the safety of the dairy products [20,57,58,59], expressing some probiotic properties [6,40,60,61], or contributing to the reduction of the allergenicity in some milk proteins [62].\n\nIn the last few years, interest in the artisanal cheese microbiota has been increasing worldwide. The milk quality, the various stages of the cheese-making process, the washing water, and cheese processing facilities harbor distinct and complex bacterial communities. The presence and growth of a variety of microorganisms are responsible for the production of many bio-compounds with sensory and antimicrobial characteristics in these cheeses, or can cause spoilage and raise safety concerns.\n\nPerin et al. [63] reported that Lactobacillus spp. were the most prevalent ones in the Minas artisanal cheese varieties, such as Serro, Canastra, Serra do Salitre, Araxá, and Campo das Vertentes. In these cheeses, Lb. garviae, Lb. acidipiscis, Lb. paracasei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. curvatus, Lb. rhamnosus, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. buchneri, Lb. parabuchneri, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, Str. thermophilus, Pediococcus acidilactici; Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Weisella paramesenteroides, Enterococcus faecalis, Kocuria kristinae, E. coli, and Staphylococcus spp. were identified.\n\nIn another study, Resende et al. [64] recorded the presence of Lb. rhamnosus, Lb. casei, and Lb. plantarum as the main species isolated from milk and Canastra cheese; while Borelli et al. [55] found Lb. brevis, E. faecalis, P. acidilactici, and W. paramesenteroides. These differences could be associated with the milk quality and conditions of cheese production. In the artisanal cheese produced in Serra do Salitre, the most frequently identified LAB were Lc. lactis, Enterococcus spp., and S. agalactiae [51]. The presence of E. faecalis is associated with poor hygiene conditions during cheese production and S. agalactiae is an important pathogen associated with mammary glandule inflammation. These findings raise alerts about the safety of the cheese produced with raw milk and especially those ripened over a short time.\n\nRecently, Kamimura et al. [38] carried out a large-scale mapping of the microbial diversity of 11 different types of artisanal Brazilian cheeses (Marajó, Manteiga, Coalho, Caipira, Araxá, Campos das Vertentes, Canastra, Serro, Colonial, and Serrano). The results revealed clear geography-based and technology-based differences in the cheese microbiota. There was a dominance of LAB and the core microbiota of artisanal Brazilian cheeses included at least six different genera: Streptococcus spp. was dominant in Marajó, Cerrado and Serro cheeses. In Manteiga and Coalho cheeses, Leuconostoc spp. prevailed, and in Araxá, Campo das Vertentes, Canastra, Lactococcus spp. was the most abundant. In addition, the presence of Erwinia spp., Psychrobacter spp., and Staphylococcus spp., which is potentially harmful, was mainly observed in Coalho, Manteiga, and Caipira cheeses produced in the Northern, Northeastern, and Central regions. In contrast, a low incidence of Staphylococcus spp. was found in the core microbiota of Araxá, Canastra, and Serrano cheeses produced in the Southeastern region.\n\nThe microbiota of the Serro Minas artisanal cheese is mainly composed by LAB, and Lactococcus is the most frequently identified genus, followed by Streptococcus and Lactobacillus [65]. However, the presence of Streptococcus spp. needs to be discussed with high attention, since only a few representatives of these genera are considered as safe.\n\nThe molecular identification of isolated LAB from the Campo das Vertentes cheese, water, raw milk, and endogenous starter culture showed that E. faecalis was the most frequently (42.86%) isolated LAB in cheese samples, followed by Lc. lactis (28.57%) and Lb. plantarum (14.29%). Additionally, Lb. brevis (5.88%), E. pseudoavium (5.88%), E. durans (5.88%), and Aerococcus viridans (5.88%) were isolated from endogenous starter cultures and are described for the first time in the literature [13].\n\nThe presence of different LAB can be related with the specificity of this bacterial species metabolism. The most important ability is to metabolize lactose; however, the capacity to grow at low pH, with high salt concentrations, and the temperatures required in cheese preparation and maturation, along with the ability to compete with some fungal species and/or some bacterial starter cultures, are factors that can influence the presence of LAB in the final products.\n\nSome specific metabolic characteristics of LAB can play a crucial role in the consequent presence of LAB in the final products. Enterococcus spp. has been isolated from Canastra and other types of cheese very frequently, given the high salt tolerance of these species and their ability to grow even at temperatures around 15 °C [66].\n\nMicrobiological analyses of artisanal Minas cheeses were carried out by aiming to show if there was a health hazard of consuming artisanal cheeses, as well as to find out if these kinds of food products could be considered as a source of beneficial microbes. When artisanal cheeses from Cerrado, Araxá, Serro, and Canastra were analyzed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis—Polymerase chain reaction (DGGE-PCR), the species Str. thermophilus, Str. salivarius, Lc. lactis, and Lb. plantarum were identified. According to the DGGE-PCR, Streptococcus spp. can be considered as predominant in the studied cheeses [11]. However, such a result could lead to different discussions. On the one hand, if we acknowledge the fact that only Str. thermophilus has a well-accepted Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status among all the different members of the Streptococcus family, then future studies could be performed in order to show if this species really is the predominant Streptococcus spp. species found in the Minas cheese. It would be an excellent recommendation to consider this kind of cheese as a beneficial food product, since several studies have shown the role of different Str. thermophilus strains as LAB with beneficial properties, including probiotics, bacteriocin production, proteolytic activity, etc. [67]. On the other hand, in the case that other Streptococcus species were present and predominant, this can raise an alert as of a potential hazard, since some different species from Str. thermophilus of the Streptococcus genera are considered to be potentially pathogenic [68].\n\nAs an example, Andrade et al. [48] reported Lb. plantarum D27 and Lb. rhamnosus B25 strains isolated from Canastra cheese with potential probiotic properties. The presence of these two species was not a surprise, since it was reported to be part of the Canastra cheese microbiota [63]. The authors have explored different aspects of the behavior of these two strains in order to evaluate their probiotic potential, as well as to show their survival and presence in the final product. Costa et al. [60] studied eleven Lactobacillus spp. and one W. paramesenteroides strains isolated from Canastra cheeses in relation to their potential application as probiotics. Isolated strains showed different levels of covering criteria to be accepted as potentially probiotic; moreover, most of them can be considered as potential candidates for future investigations using in vivo tests. However, concerns of these strains (reported by Andrade et al. [1] and Costa et al. [60]) can be really applied as adjunct cultures in the Canastra cheese production such as, if they will have the appropriate technological properties, then what influence will they have on the safety of the food product? Additionally, will they promote health modulating properties for the consumers?\n\nThe presence of LAB and yeasts in artisanal Minas cheeses can be related to several factors, among them the fact that the manufacturing practice involves the addition of fermented whey drained from the previous cheese production to be used as natural whey cultures to produce cheese (pingo). This practice is similar to that used to produce several other cheeses made of raw milk, such as Parmesan cheese. For Parmesan, this natural whey starter culture contains a high amount of LAB strains even from different species and can vary widely among farms as well as within each cheese facility throughout the year [69,70].\n\nKluyveromyces lactis, Torulaspora delbrueckii, and Candida intermedia were detected in the Canastra cheese. K. lactis and T. delbrueckii are known to be involved in the fermentation of lactose and can be responsible for the production of ethanol and numerous aromatic volatile compounds, including 3-methyl-1-butanol, octanoic acid, and ethyl decanoate, important for cheese aroma and flavor [1]. Additionally, yeasts are a significant part of the cheese microbiota, due to their lipolytic and proteolytic activities, fermentation of lactose, production of flavors, tolerance to high salt concentrations, low pH, low water activity, and low temperatures [55,71].\n\nDebaryomyces hansenii, K. lactis, Kodamaea ohmeri, T. delbrueckii, K. marxianus, Yarrowia lipolytica, as well as several Candida species, were reported as the most frequent yeasts in whey, curd, and cheese from Canastra facilities [1,55]. Samples of natural starter, cheese curd before salting, and cheese had general yeast counts between 1.7 and 7.9 log CFU/g and varied a lot among different producers. Most of these yeasts are able to produce proteases, lipases, and β-galactosidase and, this way, they have an essential role in the ripening processes of the Canastra cheese. The production of enzymes by yeasts during cheese ripening is directly related to the development of the characteristic flavor and aroma [55].\n\nCardoso et al. [45] reported that the predominant species in the Serro cheese were D. hansenii, K. ohmeri, and K. marxianus. In the same study, it was shown the beneficial technological properties of some isolated yeasts: D. hansenii 28.12 showed low lipolytic and high proteolytic activity; K. marxianus 83F and 60P demonstrated lipolytic and β-galactosidase activity, respectively, and K. ohmeri 88A had low lipolytic and β-galactosidase activity. The Serro cheese has a complex microbiota associated with raw milk and cattle management, and includes LAB from the genera of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus, which contributes to the unique cheese properties and sensory characteristics. This microbiota also includes a large diversity of yeasts which are important for the development of cheese flavor. D. hansenii is one of the most common species isolated in artisanal cheeses [29,45].\n\nRegarding contaminations, the presence of total coliforms in raw-milk cheese has been reported in several studies [19,21]. Their presence can be considered an alert for potential fecal contaminations, most probably related to poor manufacturing practices. These contaminations can be related to non-adequate practices in milking, storage, and/or transportation of raw milk, but can also be related to poor conditions during the cheese-making process and inadequate manipulation of the cheese.\n\nCarvalho et al. [21] evaluated the quality of the Colonial cheese produced in 12 rural properties of Serra, a city in the state of Santa Catarina. Many of the samples did not comply with the microbiological standards and did not conform to the current Brazilian regulatory parameters. Additionally, cheese makers did not meet the requirements for producing artisanal cheese made of raw milk. Risk analysis studies should be performed to better understand the real sanitary risks; corrective actions leading to tangible health improvements for the herd and the quality of water, milk, and cheese were recommended.\n\nThe presence of coliforms, pathogens, and sanitary indicators in artisanal Minas cheeses (Serro, Canastra, Serra do Salitre, Araxá, and Campo das Vertentes) has been evaluated in many studies. Perin et al. [63] characterized the microbial diversity composition and geographical distribution of artisanal Minas cheese focusing on the characterization of its autochthonous LAB microbiota. The microbial counts varied among cheese samples. Based on the culture, depending on the approach, 93.3% cheese samples were positive for coagulase-positive S. aureus and most of the cheese samples presented 4.00–5.00 log CFU/g. Additionally, total coliforms were reported in 53.3% of cheeses, 33.3% of samples were positive for E. coli and 60% of samples had E. coli > 2.00 log CFU/g, which can be considered as a potential health risk and an indicator for potential fecal contamination. These results for contaminants, high number of coagulase-positive bacteria and coliforms, indicated hygienic problems during production and/or storage.\n\nThe safety of the Canastra cheese is a serious issue, given the fact that it is produced with raw milk and very frequently by small-scale producers, sometimes even under home kitchen production conditions. Borelli et al. [31] assessed the population dynamics of Staphylococcus spp. during the ripening of the Canastra cheese in three different farms. The authors focused on the presence of the coagulase (coa), thermonuclease (nuc), and enterotoxin (sea, seb, sec, and sed) genes investigated in Staphylococcus strains isolated from the Canastra cheese during the 60 days of ripening. Staphylococcus spp. were found in samples ripened from 0 to 45 days, ranging from 103 to 108 CFU/g. All isolated Staphylococcus spp. were considered coagulase-positive based on the physiological tests that generated evidence for carrying the coa gene. The coagulase and thermonuclease genes occurred simultaneously in 41.3% of the tested Staphylococcus spp. The enterotoxins were not detected in any of the cheese samples and none of the investigated Staphylococcus strains expressed the staphylococcal enterotoxins.\n\nS. aureus strains were isolated as well by Das Dores et al. [5], from the Canastra cheese produced in dry and rainy seasons, in different farms. Their ability to produce enterotoxins was explored through biochemical and bio-molecular approaches, targeting the classical enterotoxin genes. The staphylococcal enterotoxin A (sea) was detected in 75% of cheese samples, but no toxin was detected through the ELFA-VIDAS (BioMerieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France) method. Moreover, 12.5% of isolated strains produced sea and staphylococcal enterotoxin C (sec). When using the PCR assay to target these genes, only one isolate was found to harbor an enterotoxin gene, contrary to expectations based on biochemical results. However, most probably, the studied S. aureus can carry different genes related to the protein expression, known as non-classical enterotoxins. High S. aureus counts in the cheese samples are a cause of concern since there is a risk of the presence of these non-classical enterotoxins and potential of health hazards.\n\nThe detection of S. aureus at levels above those permitted by law have frequently been reported for many types of Minas artisanal cheese, such as Canastra [5] and Serro [46]. The control of Staphylococcus spp. levels in cheese is considered as a marker for assessing the safety of dairy products. Outbreaks of food poisoning related to toxins (staphylococcal enterotoxins) produced by different Staphylococcus spp. were previously reported and were associated with the consumption of traditional artisanal cheeses in Brazil [72]. It is well known that some Staphylococcus strains can be responsible for food poisoning related to the production of enterotoxins.\n\nStaphylococci contaminations are probably the most frequent problem regarding artisanal cheeses [32,47,73,74,75,76,77]. It is usually associated with the contaminations from the animals’ skin or employees directly involved in the milking process, or even the manipulation during cheese-making. Generally, authors associate microbial contamination in dairy products with the use of non-pasteurized milk; however, streptococci contaminations are responsible for the production of toxins, most of them heat-stable, so they are not affected by the pasteurization processes [5].\n\nAragão et al. [32] reported 54 S. aureus isolates found in artisanal Coalho cheese from 11 municipalities in the state of Pernambuco, which were characterized as positive for blaZ gene and methicillin-resistant, raising a concern for the health of the consumers of this type of cheese. Counts for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus were above the legal limits in many samples of Canastra artisanal cheese from the Serra da Canastra area [47]. Among the artisanal cheeses from the Northwestern region of Paraná analyzed by Castilho et al. [76], 85% presented counts above 103 CFU/g for coagulase-positive staphylococci, most probably related to milk obtained from cows suffering from mastitis and due to the fact that most of the artisanal cheeses are made of raw milk; when it happens with pasteurized milk cheese, it is possibly as a consequence of an inadequate thermal process or post-processing recontamination [73]. Castro et al. [75] reported 76 staphylococcal isolates from Minas artisanal cheese from the area of Campo das Vertentes. A low expression of the staphylococcal toxin genes was detected according to the performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and only 2 staphylococcal isolates produced toxic shock syndrome toxins. More than half of the evaluated staphylococcal isolates (56.58%) were identified with hemolytic activity, 67.11% of isolates were penicillin G, and 27.63% were tetracycline resistant [75]. Grecelle et al. [74] isolated 72 Staphylococcus sp. isolates from a Colonial cheese in the state of Rio Grande do Sul during different stages of the production process; among the Staphylococcus isolates, 43% were identified as coagulase-positive with predominance of S. warneri and S. sciuri. Moreover, S. aureus was identified as the predominant species in the raw milk and production tanks. Grecelle et al. [74] identified eleven different species of Staphylococcus present in the colonial cheese, with the predominant presence of S. aureus, recovered from different stages of the milk handling and cheese production process; this indicates serious hygienic issues to be addressed in that facility. Melo et al. [77] reported 58 coagulase-positive Staphylococcus and 46 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, of which 33 were retrieved from raw milk and 71 from artisanal cheese produced in the Serrana area in the state of Santa Catarina. Among the 58 coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, the predominant ones were S. aureus (64%), S. scheiferi subsp. coagulans (22%), S. hyicus (12%), and S. intermedius (2%); the majority was positive for enterotoxins genes.\n\nThe presence of different pathogens in cheese is important to be evaluated during the entire process, starting from the raw material, to manufacturing and, especially, during the ripening period. Dalmina et al. [78] evaluated the artisanal Serrano cheese from Santa Catarina and throughout the 35 days of ripening. Samples from 14 farms still had counts above the limit defined in the legislation for E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., L. monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp. It is alarming that in one of the cheese facilities, the presence of L. monocytogenes was detected in all the evaluated periods, showing that ripening was not efficient to eliminate the pathogen [78]. Moreover, the presence of L. monocytogenes in cheeses from that same region had been previously reported, as shown by Melo et al. [79], when L. monocytogenes was found in three samples of artisanal Serrano cheese, isolated at 30 and 45 days of ripening. In a similar study, Pontarolo [80] identified L. monocytogenes in artisanal Serrano cheese at 14 days, and in two samples at 28 days of ripening. Campos et al. [47] reported one positive sample for L. monocytogenes in Canastra artisanal cheese from the Serra da Canastra area. It is well accepted that during the cheese ripening period, when there is a reduction of water activity and other changes take place, there is expected to be a reduction of food-borne pathogens. This is why the Brazilian legislation recommends that artisanal cheese made according to traditional procedures needs to be maturated and commercialized only after a specific period, a process directly related to food safety. However, L. monocytogenes is tolerant to high salt and acid concentrations and is able to survive at refrigeration temperatures, which represents a series of obstacles for its easy control in fermented food products [81].\n\nApart from the previously reported contaminations, some reports are pointing to other relevant microbiological problems during the cheese production and presence of contaminants, which can have health consequences for consumers. Albuquerque et al. [43] reported an occurrence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in the Coalho cheese produced in the state of Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil. Normally, this pathogen is involved in the paratuberculosis of ruminants or other domestic animals; however, it may also be associated with some humans’ clinical conditions, such as Crohn’s disease, type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, sarcoidosis [82,83,84,85,86]. Forty samples of Coalho cheese produced with non-pasteurized cow’s milk were analyzed; 27.5% (11 cheeses) were found to be positive for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, based on qPCR.\n\nMedeiros et al. [18] reported an analysis of 50 different samples of Coalho cheese from the Northeastern regions of Brazil in which they were screened for the presence of different representatives of mycobacteria based on conventional and RT nested PCR. Even though all studied cheese samples were negative for M. tuberculosis, two cheeses (both artisanally produced with raw milk) showed positive evidence for the presence of Mycobacterium lehmanii and Mycobacterium rutilum, most probably as a result of environmental contamination [18].\n\nMoreover, Albuquerque et al. [43] and Medeiros et al. [18] detected the DNA of mycobacteria (M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, M. lehmanii, and M. rutilum), and not the bacterial cells of the pathogen itself; also, they did not provide evidence that showed if the DNA was from dead or living cells. However, even if only dead DNA cells were detected and not living pathogens were present in the food product, it is enough evidence of a serious problem in the production of this specific cheese, resulting in contamination of the production line or sick animals in the supply chain for that cheese production facility. It is a serious problem that requires greater attention on hygiene during the cheese production, not only related to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), but also to Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).\n\nAdditionally, reports on Q fever/coxiellosis are alarming, since they can be related to cheese as well [87]. From a global perspective, increase in Q fever research was recorded after the 2007 epidemic in the Netherlands, whereas in Brazil, the epidemiology of coxiellosis is still poorly understood and not very well mapped. Rozental et al. [87] researched, using the PCR approach, the prevalence of C. burnetii in Minas artisanal cheeses from the Serro area by extracting the DNA from 53 cheese samples. An analysis was performed by means of nested species-specific PCR for C. burnetii and the obtained amplicons were sequenced. Only 9.43% of the analyzed cheeses had DNA-positive C. burnetii [87].\n\nCheese contaminations can be related to poor hygiene procedures during milk production (milking, animals’ and workers’ health conditions, ineffective equipment cleaning, both inadequate handling and storage), as well as lack of GMP during cheese production. In this context, the artisanal Minas cheese, such as the Canastra cheese, can be considered as a well studied cheese from the microbiological point of view, followed by the Serro cheese. Additionally, if we considered the presence of pathogenic bacteria, hygienic indicators, starter culture, beneficial bacteria, and the knowledge about the presence of yeast, it has even more to be explored. Furthermore, the microbiological quality and safety of other artisanal Brazilian cheeses are almost rare.\n\nIn general, artisanal cheese producers need to be conscious and trained on basic knowledge of food hygiene, food contamination, food safety, as well as cheese technology, in order to reduce the levels of food-borne illnesses associated with cheese and to improve the product quality. Furthermore, complementary studies are also necessary to deeply understand the relationship between technological processes and microbiological properties, which result in higher culinary quality and safety of the artisanal Brazilian cheese."
