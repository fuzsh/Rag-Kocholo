        "text": "Coming up: beachside lazing, sipping and munching, dog-friendly parks, a snake-like fish, excellent schools and universities, lots of bureaucracy, and everything you need to know about moving to Portugal.\n\nHello you!\n\nYou’ve clicked on this guide.\n\n… you’re reading these words.\n\nSo: we reckon you’re considering moving to Portugal.\n\nGood choice!\n\n(by the way: if our instincts were wrong here, feel free to close this tab and move on)\n\nRight now, around 1.2 million foreigners live in the nation (which is over 11% of the total population). And because there are many visa options (including a new digital nomad visa!), relocating to Portugal is becoming easier.\n\nIn short, Portugal is a popular place to find a new home.\n\nPerks of making the move include good weather, low prices, friendly people, and lots of beaches—but we’ll come to all that later.\n\nToday, your relocation-lovin’ friends at Homelike are taking you on a tour around Portugal. Bring your passport and come join the fun!\n\nThat depends on where you’re moving to Portugal from.\n\nIf you’re moving to Portugal from another part of the EU/EEA area, you DON’T need a visa. And if you’ll be staying fewer than three months, you don’t need to do anything at all! If you’ll be staying longer than three months, you need to apply for a registration certificate at your nearest city council office (within 30 days of arriving)—and that’s the only major bureaucratic thing you need to do.\n\nIf you’re not from the EU/EEA area, things are more difficult. Though many nationalities can enter Portugal for up to 90 days with no visa, you’ll need some type of visa if you’ll be hanging around for any longer.\n\nMost people reading this will want to apply for some type of residency visa (the most popular categories are for working and studying)…\n\n… but other options include The Golden Visa (which is basically an investment visa—the most popular option is to qualify by spending €500,000 on a local property), the Retirement Visa, and the temporary stay visa (which allows you to stay in Portugal for between 3 and 12 months).\n\nDigital nomads relocating to Portugal will be interested in the digital nomad visa (or, as it’s also known, the ‘D8 visa’). It’s for digital nomads, remote workers, and freelancers. It allows you to stay in Portugal for between 1 and 5 years—but you need to earn FOUR TIMES the Portuguese minimum wage (so, at present, you need to be earning around €3,040 or more per month)\n\nIf you’re moving to Portugal from the UK, you need to follow the exact same rules as any other person from any other non-EU/EEA part of the world.\n\nFor moving to Portugal, it’s (of course) a good idea to learn Portuguese:\n\n… daily life will be easier, local people will appreciate your attempts to get involved, you’ll be better at bargaining and bureaucracy, and you’ll be able to communicate with everyone (because, understandably, many older people in Portugal don’t speak English).\n\nTo get started, use Duolingo… which, as you probably know, is essentially a fun colorful easy-to-use game.\n\nFor taking your learning to the next level, try Babbel, Rosetta Stone, LingoClip (where you learn by listening to Portuguese music!), and Pimsleur (which places a big focus on speaking and listening).\n\nFor one-on-one online classes, use Preply. Or, if you want to learn in-person (and make friends!), find a language school in whichever Portuguese city you’ll be living in. Here’s more.\n\nTo buy a home after moving to Portugal, look at ReMax and Idealista (the nation’s two most popular real estate websites). But, ideally, we recommend working with an agent—unless you speak fluent Portuguese, and understand the culture and bureaucracy of the nation, buying a home can be tough.\n\nThe best websites for finding rentals are Homelike, ReMax, and Idealista. Other people use AirBnB, while many also like to use Facebook. To use Facebook, go to the search function, and type phrases such as ‘rentals in [city name]’ and ‘apartments in [city name]’.\n\n… but as you’ll soon come to learn (as most other people do after moving to Portugal!), finding a place to live is one of the hardest parts of relocating to the nation:\n\nMany landlords don’t speak English, locals have an advantage over you, some apartments are unfurnished, it’s hard to know what price is a fair price, and you often spend weeks viewing apartments and negotiating with landlords.\n\nBecause of these problems, many Portuguese newcomers decide to move into serviced apartments. These places are all fully-furnished, and they’re all ready to move into right away. So you don’t need to do any viewing or negotiating, you don’t need to deal with landlords or language barriers, and you know you’re getting a fair price.\n\nAfter relocating to Portugal, EVERYONE is legally required to register their residence.\n\nAs mentioned, this is simpler for people from another part of the EU/EEA area: you only need to apply for residence if you’ll be in the nation for longer than three months. The process is quick and easy, but you need to prove you’re studying, or working, or have enough money to sustain your stay. Here’s everything you need to know.\n\nIf you’re moving to Portugal from outside the EU/EEA area, you first need to get the correct visa. After this visa has been approved, you’ll arrive in Portugal. After you arrive in Portugal, you then need to visit your nearest immigration office (SEF) to apply for your temporary residence permit. Here’s much more detail.\n\nUsually, for non-EU/EEA citizens, your residency is valid for one year. You can then renew it for a further two years, twice. After that entire five-year-period is over, you are able to apply for permanent residency.\n\nPortugal’s healthcare is some of the best in the world—the nation’s care and facilities ranked #22 in the FREOPP 2022 World Healthcare Index.\n\nIf you have legal residency, you can use the nation’s public healthcare system (the ‘Serviço Nacional de Saúde,’ or ‘SNS’). After you get your residency, you’ll receive a social security number (NISS). You then use this NISS to register at your local health center, and you get the same public healthcare rights as a longlife resident.\n\nPublic healthcare is paid for by social security, but is free to access. That said, you need to pay for medication, and for some specialist treatments.\n\nAfter relocating to Portugal, many people prefer to use the private healthcare system. Although public healthcare is great, private healthcare is even better (with shorter waiting times, better specialist care, and higher standards). To get a private policy, the best insurers are the big names (like Cigna, AXA, and Allianz).\n\nNote: if you’ll be in Portugal for three months or fewer, you of course can’t use the public healthcare system. That said, you can access some public healthcare if you have an EHIC (European Health Insurance Card).\n\nIf you’re relocating to Portugal with kids, we’ve got good news:\n\nIn the 2021 ‘Best Countries Report,’ Portugal ranked 25th in the world for education. You get good schools, good teachers, and very high standards.\n\nIn Portugal, education is mandatory between the ages of 6 and 18 (primary school from 6 to 15; secondary school from 15 to 18).\n\nYou’ll find many international schools (British, American, French, and German)—but most are located in big cities. Typically, these international schools cost around €5,000 a year. Of course, if you’re a resident, you’re also entitled to free-of-charge public education; but all public education is in Portuguese.\n\nPortugal is also in the top 20 countries in the world for 18+ education. Higher education is popular and widespread here—you’ll find many universities across the nation (including over 30 in Lisbon alone!).\n\nOf course, if you’re coming to Portugal for university, it’s best to move to a big city (you get more choice, more English-speaking courses, more expats to make friends with, better nightlife, and more things to do).\n\nTo open an account at a traditional branch-style bank after relocating to Portugal, head to Millennium BCP, Caixa Geral de Depositos, or Santander.\n\nYou’ll usually need photo ID (e.g., a passport), your NIF number (more on that next), and proof of address (even if that address is temporary).\n\nThat said, we recommend getting an online account—they’re quicker to get, easier to manage, and you won’t have any language barriers. All you need to do is download an app, fill in some details, and (usually) provide the documents listed above. The best online options are N26, Openbank, and Revolut.\n\nAfter relocating to Portugal, you’ll find big-city public transport is excellent:\n\nIn places like Porto, Lisbon, Braga and Faro, it’s easy to get around with no car. Most cities have numerous forms of transport… including trains, metros, buses, trams, and more.\n\nIt’s also easy to get between major places (by both train and long-distance bus). There are a huge number of railway stations in Portugal (timetables and prices here). And coach companies like EVA Transportes and Rede Expressos cover huge portions of the country.\n\nBut if you want to reach more remote and rural areas, it’s best to have a car.\n\nCycling is possible, but not as easy as it is in other parts of western Europe. Though Portugal’s long-distance cycling is great, cities aren’t really set up for two wheels: Porto and Lisbon are hilly, infrastructure isn’t great, many streets are cobbled, and drivers aren’t particularly courteous to cyclists.\n\nThough there are 7 international airports in Portugal, only three of them are well-connected: Lisbon, Porto and Faro.\n\nPortugal is one of the hottest countries in Europe… and the further south you go, the warmer it gets. The annual average temperature across the nation sits at a massive 21°C (70°F).\n\nThe nation is a little rainier than most people expect (especially in the north). Although rain typically peaks in spring, you get rainy days year-round.\n\nBecause Portugal sits further south than most of Europe, it also offers more annual daylight. June serves up 14 hours of daylight per day, while even January has up to 10 hours per day.\n\nIn terms of broad differences, Lisbon is the rainiest city in Portugal, while the south coast (including Faro) is particularly hot.\n\nIf you like making friends, staying out late, and finding things to do, moving to Portugal is a good choice:\n\nYou’ll find lots of bars, clubs, and cafes—and Lisbon specifically is one of Europe’s best cities for nightlife. Across the nation, socializing can be pretty affordable—as we’ve covered, food is pretty low-cost, while coffee and alcohol are cheap. Even in Lisbon, an average domestic half-liter beer costs only €3.\n\nThe nation is home to more than 300 museums and galleries, while other noteworthy perks include the nationwide love of fado (a traditional type of dance), good football, many outdoor food venues, and great weather (so you’ll always find people hanging out and picnicking in parks).\n\nNote: overall, Portuguese people are very friendly, warm and welcoming. That said, it can take a while to make ‘real’ friends here. But if you make an effort to learn the language and pursue your hobbies, you’ll be fine.\n\nAfter relocating to Portugal, you’ll find old-school indoor-style markets (‘mercado municipal’) are still very popular. In these indoor markets, independent sellers all come together under one roof: and you’ll find grocers, bakers, butchers, fishmongers, and more.\n\nBut you’ll of course still find plenty of supermarkets throughout the nation. The biggest and most popular names are Continente, Pingo Doce, Aldi, Lidl, and Auchan.\n\nOther things to know:\n\nMany larger supermarkets have pharmacies inside them\n\nSupermarkets are usually open 7 days a week—but they might have shorter opening hours on Sundays\n\nBroadly, the biggest supermarkets usually lie outside of city centers (though you’ll find medium-sized supermarkets in the centers of bigger cities)\n\nAgain, because of Brexit, moving to Portugal from the UK is now harder than it was. As outlined earlier, you’ll need to follow the same rules any other non-EU/EEA people have to follow (just like Americans do).\n\nCompared to the UK, life in Portugal is warmer, more affordable, and has a more relaxed pace. People typically go to bed a little later, and wake a little later.\n\nSome cultural differences you might find:\n\nPeople from Portugal are more touchy than people from the UK—kissing and hugging are more common\n\nPortuguese people aren’t as punctual as UK people\n\nPortuguese people are more direct than UK people\n\nBureaucracy is a little slower and less organized\n\nPortuguese people are more family-oriented\n\nSupermarkets don’t have as much variety\n\nYou get fewer international food options\n\nPrivate healthcare is more affordable\n\nOkay—that’s everything you need to know about moving to Portugal!\n\nAs we’ve (hopefully!) made clear by now, it’s a great place to live. And we definitely recommend the move.\n\n… but we also recommend moving into a serviced apartment.\n\nOne of the hardest parts of moving to Portugal is finding a good apartment in Portugal. But if you move into a ready-right-now fully-furnished place, you don’t need to spend endless hours searching and negotiating, you don’t need to struggle with language barriers, you don’t need to attend any viewings, and you won’t get ripped off.\n\nBut, no matter which type of apartment you move into, we reckon you’ll love living in Portugal.\n\nThanks for reading, and thanks for choosing Homelike. See ya!"
