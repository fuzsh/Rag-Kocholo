        "text": "Grove Koger\n\nToday’s post is a revised version of an article I wrote for the August 17-23, 2000 issue of Boise Weekly.\n\n□□□\n\nVisitors to Venice in the late 1960s frequently reported seeing a ghostly figure striding through the city’s narrow streets and crowded squares.\n\nThey described the figure as white-haired and white-bearded, dressed in the elegant Edwardian style of the early 1900s and carrying a Malacca cane. He appeared preoccupied and he seldom spoke, but when he did—and he occasionally submitted to interviews—he might say such things as, “the error is all in the not done.”\n\nThe figure was Idaho-born poet Ezra Pound, and a visitor who followed him on a walk one day realized that the poet, mentally situated in an older era, “was taking me on a tour of his Venice [in] 1908.”\n\n“Under the Crocodile”\n\nThe launch that carried Maggie and me in late June from the Italian mainland via the islands of Murano and Lido revealed an increasingly busy and vibrant scene. At first a mere smudge on the horizon, Venice proper disappeared from time to time, only to reappear nearer and brighter. The city’s ornate, orientalized façades suggested one story—the familiar one of countless brochures—while shadowy side canals and half-glimpsed roof gardens suggested another.\n\nWe disembarked at the foot of the Piazetta, the open area that adjoins the Piazza San Marco and near which, our plans suggested, our hotel should lie. Two great columns stood at the foot of the Piazatta, one sporting the winged lion of St. Mark and the other St. Theodore—subduing a crocodile. It was the latter column, I realized, that Pound was referring to when he dramatized his own search for lodging: “And / I came here in my young youth / and lay there under the crocodile / By the column, looking East on the Friday, / And I said: Tomorrow I will lie on the South side / And the day after, south west.”\n\nWe had a plan—to see something of Pound’s Venice ourselves by hunting down the houses that he had occupied in 1908 and to visit his grave. Although the plan was sketchy, it was of course left-brained, as all plans are. But Venice, we were to discover, is right-brained, a magical city open all night to poets but closed to planners.\n\n“With tapers quenched”\n\nEzra Pound was born in Hailey, Idaho, in 1885, and although his family left the territory for the East when Pound was 18 months old, the man routinely adopted the mask of the cracker-barrel philosopher—a role familiar, if no longer endearing, to the rest of us Westerners.\n\nPound visited Venice as early as 1898, and was so drawn to its Renaissance spectacle that he was to return repeatedly. He made an extended stay in 1908, putting up at two different locations. The first was above a bakery at 861 Ponte San Vio, near the Grand Canal yet beyond the crush and glitter of San Marco—or, as Pound himself put it in his enormous work, The Cantos, “by the soap-smooth stone posts where San Vio / meets with il Canal Grande.” We made this site, in the Dorsoduro district, our first goal.\n\nThe Dorsoduro was deceptively easy to reach, and there was indeed a ponte—a bridge—over the Vio not far from the Grand Canal, yet the narrow street running alongside the canal was posted as Piscina del Forner. The numbers reached 863 on one side and 862 on the other, but where 861 by all rights ought to have been, there was nothing. I approached a clerk in a tiny gallery with my photocopied pages from Humphrey Carpenter’s biography of Pound, A Serious Character, pointing at the address. As luck had it, the charming young woman spoke English but admitted that she was not from Venice herself and was unfamiliar with the district or with Pound. “Now this poet, he is 14th century, no?”\n\nAt that moment an aged man emerged from across the street, locking his door with a great care. Approaching him with my broadest American smile, I asked whether he spoke English. He shook his head slowly and sadly. Holding my copies up to him, I pointed at the address and raised my eyebrows. He shook his head slowly and sadly again. But believing that he would recognize the famous name, I explained that I was tracking Ezra Pound, the poet Ezra Pound. The old man shook his head more slowly and even more sadly. Hell, by then I was feeling a little down myself.\n\nIt took two more visits to various points in the Dorsoduro to realize that its street numbers—perhaps all of Venice’s—don’t seem to run in sequential order. We had probably passed 861 a dozen times, but hadn’t noticed the faded number painted above the nondescript door.\n\nIt must have been here, then, that Pound assembled the poems that would appear in his first book, A Lume Spento, printed at his own expense. The title is taken from Dante’s Purgatory, the second volume of his Divine Comedy, and means, as Pound translated it, “with tapers quenched.” Despite the title, which suggests a drearily twilit fin de siècle mood, many of the poems show great character. “Bah! I have sung women in three cities,” begins one vigorous example, “But it is all the same, / And I will sing of the sun.”\n\nBuoyed by our success, we proceeded to site number two with fewer false steps. Here, in a working-class neighborhood at 942 Calle dei Frati, his window overlooking the old gondola repair yard known as Squero di San Trovaso, Pound lived from June to August 1908. It was during this period that A Lume Spento finally appeared. The enterprising poet sent out a number of review copies, eventually garnering two tepid reviews. A third review, however, spoke of “wild and haunting stuff, absolutely poetic, original, imaginative, passionate, and spiritual.” Several of these adjectives are on target, perhaps because the review was written by Pound himself!\n\n“Eye-deep in hell”\n\nFor many readers, Pound’s most important achievement came in 1920, long after he had left Italy for the literary lights of London but shortly before he would return. The occasion was the publication of the sequence Hugh Selwyn Mauberly, among other things a lament for the casualties of World War I and an excoriation of the forces that (said Pound) had brought about the debacle. One section speaks of those who “walked eye-deep in hell / believing in old men’s lies, then unbelieving.” The next poem concludes with the famous lines, “There died a myriad, / and of the best, among them, / For an old bitch gone in the teeth, / For a botched civilization.”\n\nWhen I think of Pound, it’s those searing lines that I hear, that I heard growing up in Idaho in the 1960s, mourning another generation dying for that same botched civilization.\n\nAnd yet Pound’s subsequent life presents a series of paradoxes that can be explained but not explained away. Praised by his fellow poets as having one of the finest ears in the history of English literature, he fulminated—endlessly but none too coherently—against the evils of the economic status quo; usury became a particularly tedious bugaboo. The man who worked tirelessly on his friends’ behalf, routinely neglecting his own work, grew increasingly impatient, often with those same friends. The anger that had lain beneath the surface of his work came to the fore. The antisemitism that he would later excuse as a “stupid, suburban prejudice” grew vile. His old friend Ernest Hemingway—another lover of Venice who would, oddly enough, end his life within miles of Pound’s birthplace—declared, “He is obviously crazy.”\n\nBeginning in 1941, Pound broadcast regularly on Italian radio to an American and British audience, acts that eventually led to his trial for treason in the United States and this incarceration in an insane asylum for twelve years. Freed in 1958, Pound returned to Italy, where he greeted waiting journalists with the Fascist salute.\n\nNo wonder the Venetians might not want to recognize Pound’s name. No wonder they hadn’t affixed plaques to the houses he had occupied.\n\n“What I have made”\n\nEzra Pound’s grave lies in the unkempt Protestant section of Venice’s cemetery isle, San Michele. The spot is marked with a simple stone slab. Beside him lies his mistress, concert violist Olga Rudge. The afternoon that Maggie and I visited San Michele, the cemetery was silent except for the manic rasping of a single cicada. There was no wind. Lizards sunned themselves on the tombs and brick walls. Red chrysanthemums and an incongruously blue plastic rose lay at Pound’s grave. A laurel bush grew between the markers, but then laurels were a common sight among the cypresses and dusty palms.\n\nToward the end of his life, Pound spent part of every year in Venice in Rudge’s house. By now, he had sunk into the nearly unbroken silence that marked his final years. In one of his last cantos, he wrote, “Let the Gods forgive what I have made / Let those I love try to forgive what I have made.” The Cantos as a whole, the immense and confoundingly difficult series on which he had worked since 1915, he judged a “botch.” There were reports that he wanted to revisit his birthplace, but the issue became moot November 1, 1972.\n\nOn the long, long vaporetto trip back from the cimitero, we took on a crushing load of eager young travelers carrying backpacks and sleeping rolls. They surely had never heard of Pound, and probably never would.\n\nThat day the canal was busy with motor boats and gondolas and the waves danced in the sun as they slapped against the vaporetto. The Venice of so many dire stories—sinking, stinking, its canals afloat with dead rats—was nowhere to be seen. The city was emphatically alive.\n\n“What thou lovest well remains,” the man had written in one of the later cantos, snatching a bright coin from the dross.\n\nWhat thou lovest well remains. Could be.\n\n□□□\n\nMaggie’s color photographs show (top) me on one of my first, fruitless searches; a typical canal-side scene in Venice proper; a view of the Squero di San Trovaso; and Pound’s grave. The first black-and-white image shows the aging poet in front of the Squero, while the second is his passport photograph from 1919; both are reproduced courtesy of Wikimedia.\n\n□□□"
