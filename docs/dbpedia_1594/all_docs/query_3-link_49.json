        "text": "In my “5 Countries Teach Us How to Level Up the Baked Potato” series, I was lucky enough to receive a submission called quatro queijos, or four-cheese topping. Now, I am a bread and cheese lover. A potato and cheese combination is right up there with heavenly unions for which I am so grateful! And this cheesy filling was a song for my tastebuds.\n\nThis quatro queijos recipe comes from Vicky, who is from St. Paulo in Brazil. Made from low-moisture mozzarella, provolone, catupiry, gorgonzola, heavy cream, and butter, this dish is certainly for cheese lovers. In Brazil, baked potatoes are called batata recheadas, or filled potatoes, and quatro queijos is a commonly used filling.\n\nAmong the cheeses used in this recipe, it is important to note that catupiry is a Brazilian soft cheese with a similar texture to cream cheese with salty, rich, creamy flavors. It is an excellent spreadable cheese, and I love using it on pizza and in potatoes! Mixing all the aforementioned cheeses together yields a heavy, deliciously decadent topping, and I stuffed my potato full of it. The cheese pulls were ridiculously long and impressive, so don’t take my word for it—just look at the cheese pulls!\n\nAgain, if you are a fellow cheese lover, you’ll love quatro queijos. However, if you have any sensitivity to dairy, be warned! There are plenty of other baked potato filling options in this episode, so I recommend you check those out instead.\n\nQuatro queijos is the kind of dish I could keep eating mindlessly forever. I love how Brazilians truly embraced a universal love of everything creamy, cheesy, and indulgent when creating this recipe. It is a delightfully savory dish, and I hope you give it a try, and let me know what you think! Hats off to Brazil!"
