        "text": "Background: In Southern European countries, whey cheeses are normally produced with ovine or caprine whey. Cow's cheese whey can also be used, although the whey cheese yield is low (2-3%, w/v) which discourages its use. In the present study, bovine cheese whey was concentrated by ultrafiltration for the production of four types of whey cheeses (Requeijão): conventional, without any addition (WC); with 10% (w/w) addition of cream (WCC); with cream fermented with Kefir culture (WCCK); and with cream fermented with Bifidobacterium sp. culture (WCCBB12).\n\nResults: Whey cheeses with cream presented lower protein content (330-360 g kg-1 , dry basis) and higher levels of total solids (220-250 g kg-1 ) and fat (300-330 g kg-1 , dry basis) than WC. C16:0 and C18:1 were the most abundant fatty acids present, with 31% and 38%, respectively. The small differences found concerning instrumental determination of colour and texture were not perceived by panelists. However, the presence of Kefir and probiotics decreased the elastic modulus (G') of the samples, as well as their viscosity. Fermentation with Kefir presented the highest counts of lactic acid bacteria (7 logUFC g-1 ). However, after 14 days of refrigerated storage, the counts of yeasts and moulds reached 6 logUFC g-1 in all products, indicating the need for appropriate packaging solutions."
