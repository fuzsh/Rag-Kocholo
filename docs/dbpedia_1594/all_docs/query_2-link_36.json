It has an oblong-conical shape, white pulp and its whitish epidermis sometimes has pink spots. This regional variety, known since the 19th century XVIII, is originally from the village of Esmolfe (Penalva do Castelo, Portugal) and would have come from a tree first cultivated from a seed. As its fruits are very popular, grafts were obtained that spread this variety to several fruit production areas, especially in the Beira Alta Region and in part of Cova da Beira.\n\nDepending on the season of production, figs are called lampos (May and June) and vintage (July/September). It is a fruit with well-marked organoleptic characteristics, with great nutritional qualities, being rich in vitamins B and C and mineral salts (especially calcium, phosphorus and potassium). Thin, colorful and shiny skin, high juice content, sweetness and unique organoleptic characteristics are some of the characteristics of orange from the Algarve.\n\nRosemary and eucalyptus honey, more aromatic than other honeys, has a light brown tone and a more open aroma and palate.\n\nOriginating in North and Central America, where it is still one of the mainstays of food, the pumpkin belongs to the same family as the melon and watermelon (cucurbits). The shape of the pumpkin is variable, but it is usually ovoid or oblong. The rind is usually orange, but it can have other colors depending on the species. The bright orange color of the pumpkin contains a high content of carotenes, particularly beta-carotene, with antioxidant action. Beta carotene is then converted into vitamin A in the body.\n\nAlmonds - Trás-os-Montes Region, Portugal."
