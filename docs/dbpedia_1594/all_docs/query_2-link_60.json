        "text": "Grove Koger\n\nI’ve recently completed two essays involving sirens, and, as I compiled what little information I could find about the creatures, I noticed a surprising point. Their earliest appearance in the literature that has come down to us is in Book 12 of the Odyssey, where they attempt to lure Odysseus and his men onto their island. The means of their appeal is said to be their song, which is so beguiling that none who hear it can resist it. As you probably remember, Odysseus takes Circe’s advice and gets around this problem by filling his sailors’ ears with wax and ordering them to tie him to the mast before they row past the sirens’ dangerous lair.\n\nAside from the sirens’ physical appearance—they evolved over time from women with avian aspects to women with piscine aspects—there was the question of number. How many were there? If you’re like me, you picture a dozen or so, but the translation I was working from, the 1996 version from Robert Fagles, doesn’t specify. My real problem arose, however, when I consulted other sources, only to be assured, again and again, that Homer refers to two. No, I thought, checking Fagles again; in his version, Homer doesn’t say. Fagles provides notes on the text, but none addresses the question of sirens.\n\nNext, I turned to another noted translation, this one by Robert Fitzgerald from 1961, and was more than a little surprised to read, “Soon, / as we came smartly within hailing distance, / the two Seirênês, noting our fast ship / off their point, made ready,” and so on. Hmmm. The issue was scarcely a major one, but I didn’t want to make an error, so I sidestepped the issue and finished my essays.\n\nThe question continued to bother me, however, and I did my best to consult an online version of the Odyssey in ancient Greek in the Perseus Digital Library, which is maintained by Tufts University. But although I thought I knew the word for sirens in Greek, I couldn’t spot it. So I turned to someone who might have knowledge of the ancient version of the language, my good friend Dr. Pamela Francis, who’s a fellow-member of the International Lawrence Durrell Society and an Associate Lecturer of English at the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts. She couldn’t help me, but she knew someone who could: her colleague Dr. Morris Tichenor, who graciously checked the Perseus text and came up with an answer almost immediately. As he explained, “In ancient Greek, a noun can be one of three ‘numbers’: singular, plural, and the supercool and ultrarare dual, used mostly in epic and only when there are specifically two of something.” Putting the site’s online glossing function to work, he identified the key word—σειρήνοιιν—as feminine, genitive, and dual!\n\nWe’ve all heard that Homer nods, but apparently Fagles nods too, which I find reassuring.\n\nIn any case, the number of sirens grew over time to eight, and ancient mythographers even created genealogies for them. Nearer our own day, poet and classicist Robert Graves identified eleven in his Greek Myths (1955). However, we’ve long since lost track of whatever dangerous reef or psychologically charged folktale gave rise to the stories of the strange creatures in the first place.\n\nI’ve had good luck writing about sirens. My short story involving them, “The Happiest Man Alive,“ was published in the September 2018 issue of the Bosphorus Review of Books. And my essay “In Search of the Sirens,” in which I discuss the possible location of the creatures’ island(s), is scheduled to appear in the first issue of Seaborne in March.\n\n□□□"
