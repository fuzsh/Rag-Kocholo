        "text": "Studio album by High on Fire Released February 23 2010 Recorded September - December 2009 at The Pass Studio in Los Angeles, California Genre Doom Metal, Heavy Metal, Thrash Metal Length 45:55 Label E1 Music Producer Greg Fidelman High on Fire chronology Death Is This Communion\n\n(2007) Snakes For The Divine\n\n(2010) Speak In Tongues\n\n(2010)\n\nSnakes for the Divine is the fifth studio album by the American heavy metal band High on Fire. Recorded throughout 2009 with producer Greg Fidelman (Metallica, Slayer, Red Hot Chili Peppers, etc.), it would be the band's first album on E1 Music, formerly Koch Records. Noted for a cleaner production and a further emphasis on a heavy metal sound, Snakes For The Divine would be praised by critics, currently holding an 80/100 score on Metacritic.[1]\n\nBackground[]\n\nFollowing extensive touring behind Death Is This Communion, High on Fire would begin work on a fifth studio album, initially beginning work on the album in December 2008 and originally slated for a 2009 release.[2] Notably the band would sign with Koch Records as announced on 13 December 2008.[3] On 30 January 2009 Koch would re-brand as E1 Music.[4] Recording on the new album would officially begin in September[5] and would be finished by December.[6] The album's first single, \"Frost Hammer\", would premiere via Stereogum on 13 January 2010.[7] The title track would be premiered right before the album's release.[8]\n\nSnakes For The Divine would be a loose concept inspired by the story of Adam and Eve. In an interview, frontman Matt Pike stated: \"The title 'Snakes for the Divine' is based on the premise that Adam and Eve weren't the first people on Earth, and Adam having a wife that was a Reptilian named Lilith. They were the first two people to take the reptilian DNA, and make shape-shifting human beings that go between the fourth-dimensional, the Anunnaki, and human beings. Eventually, from ancient Mesopotamia, this spawned a thing called the Illuminati - the enlightened ones - coming up through the centuries, and choosing the kings, controlling your media, controlling your banking, blah blah blah. It's just theory at most points. I thought it'd make a great metal song, so I just went ahead and started writing about that. That's how the record came about, as far as the theme.\".[9] In an interview with Decibel Magazine in 2010, the band would state that the song \"Ghost Neck\" was a reference to drummer Des Kensel and having surgery where part of his neck and spine would be replaced with a cadaver's bone.\n\nSnakes For The Divine would be released was released on 23 February 2010 through E1 Music, a special Best Buy edition containing a b-side and two live tracks as bonuses. The album would debut at #62 on the Billboard 200 in it's first week, selling roughly 8,600 copies.[10] Snakes For The Divine would attain praise from several publications, notably Blabbermouth (8/10),[11] Pitchfork (8/10)[12] and No Rip Cord (8/10).[13] Snakes For The Divine would place #17 on Decibel Magazine's Top 40 Albums of 2010[14] and #9 on Exclaim's Top Metal Albums of 2010.[15]\n\nTracklist[]\n\nAll songs written by High on Fire.\n\nTracks 9 - 11 are exclusive to the Best Buy CD edition.\n\n1.
