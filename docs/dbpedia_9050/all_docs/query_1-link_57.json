        "text": "Social Media Program Titles Released This Week:\n\nElliott Smith – Elliot Smith [Expanded 25th Anniversary Edition] 2xCD/2xLP (Kill Rock Stars)\n\nWhen Elliott Smith’s self-titled second album came out in 1995, it was ignored by the press but championed by artists from the Beastie Boys to Fugazi. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of Elliott Smith, the Kill Rock Stars label is releasing a special deluxe package, which includes a new remastering of the original record; a 52-page hardcover book of previously unseen photographs by JJ Gonson with handwritten lyrics, and reminiscences from Smith’s friends and colleagues; and a bonus disc documenting the earliest-known recording of Smith performing as a solo act.\n\nWidowspeak – Plum CD/LP (Captured Tracks)\n\nWith Plum, the songwriting partnership rooted in the creative rapport between singer Molly Hamilton and guitarist Robert Earl Thomas continues to expand on shared visions, delving deeper into what was always there: dusty guitars, ear-worm melodies, warm expansive arrangements. Each entry to their catalog has marked a subtle reimagining of Widowspeak’s sound, though perennial points of reference remain the same: ‘90s dream pop, ‘60s psych rock, a certain unshakeable Pacific-Northwestness. [Limited edition white colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nSeptember Listening Station/Marketing Program Titles Released This Week:\n\nThe Allman Betts Band – Bless Your Heart CD (BMG)\n\nIf Down To The River was the sound of The Allman Betts Band’s combustible sparks igniting, then Bless Your Heart is their bonfire, built for the summer of 2020 and beyond; a double-album follow-up fueled by road-forged camaraderie and telepathic musical intensity, vibrantly reflecting the individual and collective experiences of these seven, all drawing inspiration from the band’s symbolic hometown – a place Devon Allman calls “the United States of Americana.” A conflagration of influences and invention, confidence and ambition, Bless Your Heart captures a vast, panoramic scope throughout a baker’s dozen of modern rock. Ragged and stomping. Heady and frayed. Soaring and scorching. Generational and genteel. West Coast scenes and Gulf Coast shores. Gateways of the Midwest and swamplands of Florida. Wyoming’s Big Sky. New York’s Big Apple. Chicago’s Broad Shoulders. [Vinyl edition due October 9.]\n\nArca – KiCk i CD/LP (XL Recordings)\n\nRecently released on vinyl – now available on CD. Produced and recorded by Arca, KiCk i defines a new era of multiplex harmony for the Venezuelan artist, singer, DJ, performer and experimental music composer. Featuring guest appearances by Björk, Rosalía, Shygirl and Sophie, KiCk i is a celebration not only of the joy Arca’s been able to find in her life, but the sometimes arduous journey it took for her to find it. Her struggles to reconcile her Venezuelan heritage and her trans Latinx identity emerge as reggaetón and pop en Español. “I don’t want to be tied to one genre,” Arca says. “I don’t want to be labeled as one thing.”\n\nThe Avett Brothers – The Third Gleam CD/LP (Loma Vista)\n\nGrammy Award-nominees The Avett Brothers release the highly-anticipated third installment in their ongoing Gleam series. The Third Gleam marks a return to The Avett Brothers’ roots, both sonically and in form with Seth and Scott Avett playing as a trio with longtime bassist Bob Crawford, and follows in the band’s tradition of sharing what’s on their minds and in their hearts as their lives, and the world around them, continue to evolve. Seth and Scott express that while The Third Gleam was recorded ahead of the pandemic and social reform movements that have swept the nation, the new music captures their personal experiences and perspectives on themes that are undeniably universal and timely. Throughout the eight-song collection, the band delves into isolation, incarceration, and injustice, as well as resilience, redemption, and love, offering a gleam of hope in a dark and uncertain time.\n\nDisclosure – Energy CD/2xLP (Capitol)\n\nGrammy and Mercury Music Prize-nominated U.K. duo Disclosure (brothers Guy & Howard Lawrence) release their third album, Energy, featuring a global spectrum of talented artists including, for the first time, rappers. Appearances from Mick Jenkins, ChannelTres, Aminé and slowthai sit comfortably alongside the legend that is Common. Other features include the inimitable Kelis, who opens the album, and Fatoumata Diawara, who the boys have also linked up with previously. Cameroon’s Blick Bassy brings his own flow to the table while a powerhouse team of Kehlani and Syd ease the pace with their contribution. Through an epic process of creation and distillation the path to producing their shortest, most direct album – 11 songs, 39 minutes – ran through around 200 tracks: everything from drum loops to fully realized songs.\n\nRuston Kelly – Shape & Destroy CD/LP (Rounder)\n\nWith his sophomore album, Shape & Destroy, Nashville-based artist Ruston Kelly documents his experience in maintaining sobriety, and finally facing the demons that led him to drug abuse in the first place. But while Kelly recounts that journey with an unvarnished honesty, his grace and conviction as an artist ultimately turn Shape & Destroy into a work of unlikely transcendence. Kelly says, “Making this record definitely taught me that I don’t want to be selfish: I want to channel something larger than myself and give myself to the process as fully as possible, because these songs also become the story of whoever hears them. Whatever someone might get out of listening to this record and hearing me express myself in this way, it’s completely theirs.” Features guest contributions from Kacey Musgraves, Gena Johnson and Abby Kelly.\n\nBettye LaVette – Blackbirds CD/LP (Verve)\n\nBlackbirds, whose release will coincide with Bettye LaVette’s induction into the Blues Music Hall of Fame, represents another step in the 5x Grammy-nominated vocalist’s artistic evolution. Working again with Things Have Changed producer Steve Jordan, who also plays drums, and a group of celebrated musicians (Smokey Hormel on guitar, Monty Croft on vibes, bassist Tom Barney and veteran keyboardist Leon Pendarvis), LaVette delivers impassioned readings of songs associated with African American female vocalists of the 1950s. In curating the songs for Blackbirds, LaVette has established a dialogue with the great women who preceded her while reaffirming herself as a vital, living presence.\n\nMetallica & San Francisco Symphony – S&M2 2xCD/4xLP/2xCD+DVD/2xCD+Blu-ray/4xLP+2xCD+Blu-ray (Blackened Recordings)\n\nS&M2 is a landmark release in the Metallica catalogue, both sonically and visually. Produced by Greg Fidelman with James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, the S&M2 live album captures more than two and a half hours of James, Lars, Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo joining forces with the nearly 80-strong San Francisco Symphony, legendary Musical Director of the orchestra Michael Tilson Thomas, and conductor Edwin Outwater. The concert film is a brand-new edit done by Joe Hutching (Through The Never) and both the audio (newly remixed and remastered) and visuals have been taken to the next level from the October 2019 theatrical version that played in over 3,700 cinemas worldwide. [The colored vinyl four-LP + double-CD + Blu-ray deluxe box set comes complete with an exclusive 28-page book featuring photos by Anton Corbijn, sheet music, five guitar picks, a 24″ x 36″ poster, and more. Stand-alone DVD and Blu-ray editions are also available.]\n\nMy Morning Jacket – The Waterfall II CD/LP (ATO\n\nThe Waterfall II completes The Waterfall, My Morning Jacket’s acclaimed 2015 record. Originally intended to be a sprawling triple album, the band were advised to hold back and keep some of it on the shelf. Frontman Jim James says, “this is simply the second half of a long snapshot of life for me as a writer in the years leading up to 2014, and the life of us as a band as we lived and worked in and around Stinson Beach, CA during these recording sessions.” [Limited clear vinyl pressing and limited 180gm orange and green colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nNecrot – Mortal CD/LP (Tankcrimes)\n\nBay Area death metal/punk trio Necrot deliver their long-anticipated second full-length, Mortal. Recorded by Grammy award winning engineer Greg Wilkinson (High On Fire, Autopsy) and mastered by Alan Douches (Cannibal Corpse, Cattle Decapitation, Mastodon) at West West Side, the follow-up to the band’s critically adored Blood Offerings is at once earth rupturing and memorable, spewing forth seven tracks of meticulously executed vile and maniacal death metal supremacy. Easily their most precise performance to date, Mortal foams at its mouth with Chad Gailey’s destructive rhythms, Sonny Reinhardt’s intricate guitar leads, and the guttural domination of vocalist/bassist Luca Indrio.\n\nOndara – Folk N’ Roll Vol. 1: Tales Of Isolation CD (Verve Forecast)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer-songwriter J.S. Ondara, now mononymously known as Ondara, releases Folk N’ Roll Vol 1: Tales Of Isolation, a new collection of songs written in direct response to the current global pandemic. The album was composed and produced by Ondara while in lockdown in Minneapolis over the course of a week, and came out of Ondara’s deep need to create as a form of therapy during this incredibly uncertain time. “As I’m sure it has for all of us, I found the period of isolation to be wearing down the equilibrium of my sanity,” Ondara says. “After being stuck in a mental rut for four weeks, I woke up one morning and spent three days writing these songs and three more days recording them in a friend’s living room in Minneapolis. It was a kind of vomit of words and melodies, compulsive and without any control or forethought. I wasn’t trying to make a record, I wasn’t trying to do anything really; I was only trying to provide myself with some kind of therapy, a desperate attempt at preserving my sanity. They are stories about the ramifications of a whole population isolating; about the personal, political and economic scars that will linger for the rest of our lives long after we have found our way past this.” [Vinyl edition due September 18.]\n\nKaty Perry – Smile CD/LP (Capitol)\n\nColorful pop princess Katy Perry follows-up 2017’s Witness with the new studio album, Smile which she describes as “finding the light at the end of the tunnel” and her “journey towards the light, with stories of resilience, hope, and love.” The playful cover art perfectly aligns with Perry’s flair for costumes and eye-catching covers and features the pop singer as a dispirited clown, sporting a red nose. Perry has released a number of singles to roll out Smile including the Gold-certified “Never Really Over”, the earworm “Harleys In Hawaii”, atmospheric ballad “Daises” and the infectious title track which all but affirm Billboard’s assertion that “the Katy Perry Renaissance is here, undeniably and spectacularly. Perry is making her most exciting music in years, and within the span of a few months, she has completely shifted expectations for her next project among pop junkies.” [Limited white colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nGregory Porter – All Rise CD/2xLP/3xLP (Blue Note)\n\nGregory Porter, the world’s best-selling contemporary jazz/soul artist, releases his sixth studio album, All Rise. The record marks a return to Porter’s beloved original songwriting – heart-on-sleeve lyrics imbued with everyday philosophy and real-life detail, set to a stirring mix of jazz, soul, blues and gospel. Produced by Troy Miller (Laura Mvula, Jamie Cullum, Emili Sande), the set also represents the evolution of Porter’s art to something even more emphatic, emotive, intimate, and universal too. After 2017’s Nat King Cole & Me, Porter knew two things: one, he’d bring in an orchestra for his next LP, and two, the music is medicine. In the spirit of that latter revelation, All Rise brims with songs about irrepressible love, plus a little protest, because the road to healing is bumpy. [The deluxe colored vinyl triple-LP and deluxe CD editions include the two bonus tracks, “Real Truth” and “You Can Join My Band”, plus alternate cover art.]\n\nPVRIS – Use Me CD/LP (WB)\n\nPVRIS deliver their highly-anticipated third studio album Use Me. On the new record, frontwoman, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer Lynn Gunn steps into a new chapter, as she owns her role as PVRIS’ leader and sole architect. The result is 11 pop conjurations of glitchy beat-craft, airy guitars, and spell-binding vocals. Lynn explains that lead single “Dead Weight” is “about being a people pleaser, holding others up and never asking for anything back. Quite often that can being taken advantage of and can be hard to say/set boundaries, this feels amplified especially as a woman. This song is about stepping into my power as a woman, shedding old skin and taking nurturing/caretaker feminine nature and turning it into a super power.” That newfound sense of freedom lies at the core of Use Me. [Limited indie store exclusive vinyl pressing.]\n\nBobby Rush – Rawer Than Raw CD/LP (Deep Rush)\n\nBobby Rush pays homage to the great bluesmen from Mississippi on his 27th studio album, Rawer Than Raw. This is Rush, stripped down – just his guitar, harmonica, singing, and foot tapping. There’s a song from Skip James, Robert Johnson, Sonny Boy Williamson, Willie Dixon, and Howlin’ Wolf. One song is Public Domain originally recorded for the Library of Congress by Alan Lomax, but later made famous by Muddy Waters (“Honey Bee, Sail On”). Rawer Than Raw is the follow up to 2019’s Grammy nominated Sitting On Top Of The Blues and showcases Bobby Rush in his truest form without a backing band.\n\nSeether – Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum CD/2xLP (Fantasy)\n\nProduced by Shaun Morgan and engineered and mixed by Matt Hyde (Deftones, AFI), Seether’s new album Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum, (which translates to “If you want peace, prepare for war”) was recorded in Nashville, TN over two months in December 2019 and January 2020. The follow-up to 2017’s Poison The Parish, Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum is the eighth album of the band’s illustrious career and features Shaun Morgan’s, aggressive, highly melodic songwriting, some of the most expressive, politically charged music he’s ever made. Seether is joined on the record by their newest member, Cory Lowery (former guitarist/vocalist for Saint Asonia and Stuck Mojo) who adds a broad new sonic dimension to the band’s studio and live work.\n\nToots and The Maytals – Got To Be Tough CD/LP (BMG)\n\nReggae pioneers Toots and The Maytals release their first original studio album in more than 10 years following 2010’s Flip And Twist. With Toots taking on horn and production duties himself, Got To Be Tough features Sly Dunbar on drums, Zak Starkey on guitar, and Cyril Neville on percussion. The album also includes a cover of Bob Marley’s “Three Little Bird” with Ziggy Marley. “This album is speaking out about injustices while pointing to a better time,” Hibbert tells Rolling Stone. “This album is teaching a path to recovery and a step to better days on the journey ahead. Got To Be Tough is a bind builder of positive objectives.”\n\nWalter Trout – Ordinary Madness CD/2xLP (Provogue)\n\nFor Walter Trout, there is no ‘us’ and ‘them’. Across his five-decade career, the great bluesman’s music has always been a lifeline and call-to-arms, reminding listeners they are not alone. Now, as the world seeks solace from a tragedy that has touched us all, he comes armed with a boundary-exploring new studio album and eleven searing, honest songs that bring his fans even closer. “There’s a lot of extraordinary madness going on right now,” considers Trout, of the COVID-19 crisis. “This album started because I was dealing with the flaws and weakness inside me. But it ended up being about everyone.” Ordinary Madness was completed mere days before the US shutdown, its cathartic songcraft and themes of shared troubles couldn’t chime better with a period in which our souls and spirits are under fire from tumultuous global events. [Limited edition colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nMolly Tuttle – but I’d rather be with you CD/LP (Compass)\n\nIn March 2020, Nashville-based artist Molly Tuttle experienced the devastating tornado that tore through much of East Nashville, followed by the global pandemic. Tuttle, who grew up in California and has toured as a solo artist for years, suddenly found herself – along with the rest of the musician community – sheltering at home. She found solace in revisiting favorite songs in an attempt to “remind myself why I love music.” She conceptualized an idea for a record with renowned L.A. producer Tony Berg (Phoebe Bridgers, Andrew Bird) to be recorded over 2,000 miles apart. Tuttle taught herself how to use Pro Tools, recorded and engineered all of her parts alone at home before sending them to Berg in Los Angeles, who enlisted legendary session musicians to add instrumentation in their respective home studios. The result is 10 tracks that cross the musical spectrum and the decades, from FKA Twigs to Cat Stevens, from Rancid to Karen Dalton. [Limited indie store exclusive vinyl pressing.]\n\nVarious Artists – AngelHeaded Hipster: The Songs Of Marc Bolan & T. Rex 2xLP (BMG)\n\nIndie store exclusive vinyl pressing. CD due September 4. The genius and pioneering influence of Marc Bolan’s T. Rex – 2020 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee and one of the great rock musicians of all time – is celebrated with AngelHeaded Hipster: The Songs Of Marc Bolan & T. Rex. The collection features 26 songs culled from Bolan’s vast body of work released as T. Rex and Tyrannosaurus Rex from 1968-77. A wide-ranging cast of wizards and cosmic dancers have joined together to re-imagine Bolan’s work including Nick Cave, U2 featuring Elton John, Joan Jett, and Peaches among others – sometimes in radical fashion – resulting in a collection that is less tribute than bold new work.\n\nVenomous Concept – Politics Versus The Erection CD/LP (Season Of Mist)\n\nIf the state of today’s society is reflected in music, hardcore punk/grindcore veterans Venomous Concept return to the stage with a fitting soundtrack. On Politics Versus The Erection, Kevin Sharp (Brutal Truth), Shane Embury (Napalm Death), Danny Herrera (Napalm Death) and John Cooke (Corrupt Moral Altar) voice criticism and opinions with satirical animations, venomous lyrics, and 30 minutes of short, sharp musical blasts, creating a true hardcore punk spirit. This band’s fourth full-length frontal assault manifests a no-nonsense, outspoken and angry tone, resonating with the chaos that reigns over the world today.\n\nColter Wall – Western Swing & Waltzes And Other Punchy Songs CD (La Honda)\n\nThe music industry is no stranger to cowboys – but it’s been a long while since any with an authentic affinity for the North American West came along and carried around a love for heroes like Ramblin’ Jack Elliot and Ian Tyson. Enter 24-year-old Colter Wall, whose dusty baritone voice and deep well of stories are almost single-handedly carrying traditional western music into the future. Wall’s approach is that of a preservationist, pure as the prairie wind, and is on full display on his new self-produced album Western Swing & WaltzesA Other Punchy Songs. Wall’s 10-track ode to the themes and labors of western life picks up where his last album left off, with a reverence for his “working cowboy kin” and a whole mess of cowboy songs.\n\nCDs + Vinyl:\n\nIdris Ackamoor and The Pyramids – Shaman! CD/2xLP (Strut)\n\nReleased last week on vinyl – now available on CD. Influential jazz collective Idris Ackamoor and The Pyramids return with an epic new opus, Shaman!, featuring a fresh line-up including original 1970s Pyramids member Dr. Margaux Simmons on flute, Bobby Cobb on guitar, long-term associate Sandra Poindexter on violin, Ruben Ramos on bass, Gioele Pagliaccia on drums and Jack Yglesias on percussion.\n\nThe Allman Betts Band – Bless Your Heart CD (BMG)\n\nIf Down To The River was the sound of The Allman Betts Band’s combustible sparks igniting, then Bless Your Heart is their bonfire, built for the summer of 2020 and beyond; a double-album follow-up fueled by road-forged camaraderie and telepathic musical intensity, vibrantly reflecting the individual and collective experiences of these seven, all drawing inspiration from the band’s symbolic hometown – a place Devon Allman calls “the United States of Americana.” A conflagration of influences and invention, confidence and ambition, Bless Your Heart captures a vast, panoramic scope throughout a baker’s dozen of modern rock. Ragged and stomping. Heady and frayed. Soaring and scorching. Generational and genteel. West Coast scenes and Gulf Coast shores. Gateways of the Midwest and swamplands of Florida. Wyoming’s Big Sky. New York’s Big Apple. Chicago’s Broad Shoulders. [Vinyl edition due October 9.]\n\nArca – KiCk i CD/LP (XL Recordings)\n\nRecently released on vinyl – now available on CD. Produced and recorded by Arca, KiCk i defines a new era of multiplex harmony for the Venezuelan artist, singer, DJ, performer and experimental music composer. Featuring guest appearances by Björk, Rosalía, Shygirl and Sophie, KiCk i is a celebration not only of the joy Arca’s been able to find in her life, but the sometimes arduous journey it took for her to find it. Her struggles to reconcile her Venezuelan heritage and her trans Latinx identity emerge as reggaetón and pop en Español. “I don’t want to be tied to one genre,” Arca says. “I don’t want to be labeled as one thing.”\n\nCraig Armstrong/Calum Martin – The Edge Of The Sea CD (Modern)\n\nNew release from composers Craig Armstrong and Calum Martin. The collaboration began as a meeting of ideas with a mutual, long-held belief that there was a special project to be written, looking at the unique spiritual tradition of Gaelic Psalm singing. The Edge Of The Sea features two new works: “The Martyrdom Variations”, and “Ballantyne”; with the concept being realized by bringing together a curated congregation by Calum’s from the Isles of Lewis and Harris in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, along with the outstanding talent and enthusiasm of the Scottish Ensemble.\n\nThe Avett Brothers – The Third Gleam CD/LP (Loma Vista)\n\nGrammy Award-nominees The Avett Brothers release the highly-anticipated third installment in their ongoing Gleam series. The Third Gleam marks a return to The Avett Brothers’ roots, both sonically and in form with Seth and Scott Avett playing as a trio with longtime bassist Bob Crawford, and follows in the band’s tradition of sharing what’s on their minds and in their hearts as their lives, and the world around them, continue to evolve. Seth and Scott express that while The Third Gleam was recorded ahead of the pandemic and social reform movements that have swept the nation, the new music captures their personal experiences and perspectives on themes that are undeniably universal and timely. Throughout the eight-song collection, the band delves into isolation, incarceration, and injustice, as well as resilience, redemption, and love, offering a gleam of hope in a dark and uncertain time.\n\nThe Awakening – Hear, Sense And Feel [Reissue/1972] CD/LP (Real Gone Music)\n\nRemastered. The Awakening fit somewhere between the free jazz and Afrocentric explorations of the Art Ensemble and the rhythm-heavy soul jazz.\n\nWalter Bishop Jr. ‎– Coral Keys [Reissue/1971] CD/LP (Real Gone Music)\n\nThink Herbie Hancock’s ’60s Blue Note recordings gently polished with a soul jazz sheen; this is some tasty stuff that’s been hard to find for way too long.\n\nBlack Creatures – Wild Echoes CD (Center Cut)\n\nRepresenting the strange land of Kansas City, Missouri, The Black Creatures blur the lines of genre, blending their cohesive stylings of contemporary music-pop, hip-hop, dance, R&B, EDM, and soul sounds-with cinematic and storytelling sci-fi fantasy elements and themes. [Vinyl edition due October 30.]\n\nDaniel Blumberg – On&On CD/LP (Mute)\n\nNew 9-track song cycle, On&On, confirms London musician/visual artist Daniel Blumberg as a unique creative force, and pushes the art of song into expansive new territories. It is a consolidation of the deconstructed song aesthetic he has developed, operating at the intersection between conventional song structures and free improvisation. Now he takes this further, incorporating recurring, shape-shifting motifs and at times dissolving the boundaries between songs altogether. [Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nAlan Braufman – The Fire Still Burns CD/LP (Valley Of Search)\n\n45 years after his debut album Valley Of Search (1975), jazz saxophonist Alan Braufman returns. The Fire Still Burns has that gritty, forthright sensibility we hope to hear in sonic collaborations borne out of beauty and struggle, but there’s a populist ease that comes with age and reflection. Put simply, it is natural music – complementary, individual, and full of the sweet, hot taste of celebration.\n\nToni Braxton – Spell My Name CD (Island)\n\nMulti-Platinum, Grammy-winning megastar Toni Braxton releases her new album, Spell My Name, which includes the hit single, “Do It” as well as a new version with Missy Elliot, and fan-favorite “Dance”.\n\nDoug Carn featuring The Voice Of Jean Carn ‎– Spirit Of The New Land [Reissue/1972] CD/LP (Real Gone Music)\n\nOf all the artists who recorded for the Black Jazz label, keyboardist and composer Doug Carn was the most prolific, releasing four albums for the imprint. 1972’s Spirit Of The New Land was his second Black Jazz release, but the first one (of two) to co-feature his wife, vocalist Jean Carn, in the album title.\n\nDon Cherry ‎– Om Shanti Om CD/LP (Black Sweat)\n\nArchive release. An amazing document of the life experiment that was the Organic Music Society. This super quality audio, recorded by RAI (the Italian public broadcasting company) in 1976 for television, documents a quartet concert focused on vocals compositions and improvisations. Here, Don Cherry and his family community’s musical belief emerges in its simplicity, with the desire to merge the knowledge and stimuli gained during numerous travels across the World in a single sound experience. Don’s pocket-trumpet is melted with the beats of the great Brazilian percussionist Nana Vasconcelos, the Italian guitar of Gian Piero Pramaggiore, and the tanpura drone of Moki. A pure hippie aesthetic, like in an intimate ceremony, filters a magical encounter between Eastern and Western civilizations, offering different suggestions of sound mysticism: natural acoustics in which individual instruments and voices are part of a wider pan-tribal consciousness.\n\nBilly Childs – Acceptance CD (Mack Avenue)\n\nNew release from the critically acclaimed jazz pianist.\n\nThe Devil’s Trade – The Call Of The Iron Peak CD/LP (Season Of Mist)\n\nBe it the folk of the Appalachians, the tales of Hungarian and Transylvanian traditions, singer-songwriter Dávid Makó, who redefined himself as The Devil’s Trade a few years ago, fuses his past of metal and his roots laying deep in the folk songs of his immediate surroundings.\n\nDiamond Rexx – Psych Ward CD (Pavement Ent.)\n\nNew release from the veteran Chicago-based metal band.\n\nDianthus – Worth Living For CD (Deko Music)\n\nFor fans of Rush, Black Veil Brides and progressive metal.\n\nDisclosure – Energy CD/2xLP (Capitol)\n\nGrammy and Mercury Music Prize-nominated U.K. duo Disclosure (brothers Guy & Howard Lawrence) release their third album, Energy, featuring a global spectrum of talented artists including, for the first time, rappers. Appearances from Mick Jenkins, ChannelTres, Aminé and slowthai sit comfortably alongside the legend that is Common. Other features include the inimitable Kelis, who opens the album, and Fatoumata Diawara, who the boys have also linked up with previously. Cameroon’s Blick Bassy brings his own flow to the table while a powerhouse team of Kehlani and Syd ease the pace with their contribution. Through an epic process of creation and distillation the path to producing their shortest, most direct album – 11 songs, 39 minutes – ran through around 200 tracks: everything from drum loops to fully realized songs.\n\nDokken – Lost Songs: 1978-1981 CD/LP (Silver Lining Music)\n\n11 cracking gems from the vaults of Don Dokken. The Lost Songs: 1978-1981 shows Dokken in the unfettered early days of balls-out attitude, as well as showcasing the song-writing skills which would see them sell over 10 million albums and him become an international rock ‘n’ roll star.\n\nDreams Of Avalon – Beyond The Dream CD/LP (Metalville)\n\n‘80s-influenced solo album by multi-instrumentalist Joachim Nordlund, guitarist of Swedish metal legends Astral Doors.\n\nThe Jeremy Edge Project – The Jeremy Edge Project CD (Deko Music)\n\nFormer Candlelight Red guitarist Jeremy Edge launches a new band, The Jeremy Edge Project, which features guest performances by Brandon Yeagley (Crobot) and Brett Hestla (Dark New Day). [Vinyl edition September 18.]\n\nThe Empty Hearts – The Second Album CD/LP (Wicked Cool)\n\nEven though The Empty Hearts band features members of Blondie, The Cars, Chesterfield Kings and The Romantics – as well as being christened by Little Steven Van Zandt from his super-secret list of unused band names – this is no cynically constructed super group. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame drummer Clem Burke, two-time Grammy nominated guitarist Elliot Easton, bassist Andy Babiuk and lead singer/rhythm guitarist Wally Palmar have parlayed a combined lifetime of rock ‘n’ roll into The Second Album, a sterling collection of influences that include ‘50s American roots rock ‘n’ roll, ‘60s British Invasion and ‘70s garage-punk that is anything but retro, rather a refreshing return to core musical values. Single “Remember Days Like These” features Ringo Starr on drums.\n\nExist – Egoiista CD/2xLP (Prosthetic)\n\nNew album from the Maryland-based progressive death metal outfit. Featuring Max Phelps (Death To All, Cynic) on vocals and guitars, Egoiista is comprised of nine forward-thinking tracks clocking in at just over 60 minutes. The album is more of an exploration of the power of restraint and clever song writing then exceeding the excess that can sometimes plague the genre.

But while Kelly recounts that journey with an unvarnished honesty, his grace and conviction as an artist ultimately turn Shape & Destroy into a work of unlikely transcendence. Kelly says, “Making this record definitely taught me that I don’t want to be selfish: I want to channel something larger than myself and give myself to the process as fully as possible, because these songs also become the story of whoever hears them. Whatever someone might get out of listening to this record and hearing me express myself in this way, it’s completely theirs.” Features guest contributions from Kacey Musgraves, Gena Johnson and Abby Kelly.\n\nKem – Love Always Wins CD (Motown)\n\nSeventh album from the internationally renowned, three-time Grammy-nominated R&B singer/songwriter.\n\nKhemmis – Doomed Heavy Metal CD/LP (20 Buck Spin)\n\nA treasure trove of rare material from the doom metal band.

In curating the songs for Blackbirds, LaVette has established a dialogue with the great women who preceded her while reaffirming herself as a vital, living presence.\n\nLedisi – The Wild Card CD (BMG)\n\nNew album from the R&B singer/songwriter.\n\nHarold López-Nussa – Te Lo Dije CD (Mack Avenue)\n\nImagine yourself walking down the streets of Havana hearing music from people’s homes, parties being thrown and paladares or night clubs filled with patrons dancing: this is the soul of Cuba.

Produced by Greg Fidelman with James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, the S&M2 live album captures more than two and a half hours of James, Lars, Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo joining forces with the nearly 80-strong San Francisco Symphony, legendary Musical Director of the orchestra Michael Tilson Thomas, and conductor Edwin Outwater. The concert film is a brand-new edit done by Joe Hutching (Through The Never) and both the audio (newly remixed and remastered) and visuals have been taken to the next level from the October 2019 theatrical version that played in over 3,700 cinemas worldwide. [The colored vinyl four-LP + double-CD + Blu-ray deluxe box set comes complete with an exclusive 28-page book featuring photos by Anton Corbijn, sheet music, five guitar picks, a 24″ x 36″ poster, and more.

[Vinyl edition due September 25.]\n\nJason Mraz – Looking For The Good CD/2xLP (BMG)\n\nJason Mraz’s new album begins and ends with the same phrase: “look for the good.” Those four words are not just a lyric or the title of his seventh studio album, but also an all-encompassing world philosophy for the musician, who believes that in dark and challenging times we should search for something positive. While the songs on Look For The Good harken back to Mraz’s formative releases, including his 2002 debut Waiting For My Rocket To Come and 2005’s Mr. A-Z, the album looks forward, hinting at a musician who isn’t bound by genre or expectation.\n\nMy Morning Jacket – The Waterfall II CD/LP (ATO\n\nThe Waterfall II completes The Waterfall, My Morning Jacket’s acclaimed 2015 record. Originally intended to be a sprawling triple album, the band were advised to hold back and keep some of it on the shelf. Frontman Jim James says, “this is simply the second half of a long snapshot of life for me as a writer in the years leading up to 2014, and the life of us as a band as we lived and worked in and around Stinson Beach, CA during these recording sessions.” [Limited clear vinyl pressing and limited 180gm orange and green colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nNarrow Head – 12th House Rock CD/LP (Run For Cover)\n\nThe Houston-based band’s latest entry is the distillation of the greatest moments in ‘90s alternative and hard rock with a fresh set of ears, thirteen tracks of their signature brand of bludgeoning lullabies bursting at the seams with creative ideas, new directions and yes, massive, monolithic riffs.\n\nNecrot – Mortal CD/LP (Tankcrimes)\n\nBay Area death metal/punk trio Necrot deliver their long-anticipated second full-length, Mortal. Recorded by Grammy award winning engineer Greg Wilkinson (High On Fire, Autopsy) and mastered by Alan Douches (Cannibal Corpse, Cattle Decapitation, Mastodon) at West West Side, the follow-up to the band’s critically adored Blood Offerings is at once earth rupturing and memorable, spewing forth seven tracks of meticulously executed vile and maniacal death metal supremacy. Easily their most precise performance to date, Mortal foams at its mouth with Chad Gailey’s destructive rhythms, Sonny Reinhardt’s intricate guitar leads, and the guttural domination of vocalist/bassist Luca Indrio.\n\nNeedtobreathe – Out Of Body CD/LP (Elektra)\n\nSeventh album from the Christian rock band.\n\nNonexist – Like The Fearless Hunter CD/LP (Target)\n\nFor fans of Arch Enemy, Dark Tranquility and Morbid Angel.\n\nZephaniah OHora – Listening To The Music CD/LP (Last Roundup)\n\nZephaniah OHora is a New York City-based singer-songwriter and a pillar of the burgeoning NYC Country-Western music community. Zephaniah has received praise from publications such as Wide Open Country and American Songwriter who wrote, “Channeling the country icons of decades past is something of a trend these days, but only a handful of artists are able to pull off such homage without devolving into mimicry. Brooklyn’s OHora is one of those artists.”\n\nAngel Olsen – Whole New Mess CD/LP+MP3 (Jagjaguwar)\n\nAn intimate and vulnerable emotional portrait that shows her grappling with a period of personal tumult, Whole New Mess presents Angel Olsen working through her open wounds and raw nerves with just a few guitars and some microphones, isolated in a century-old church in the Pacific Northwest. It follows All Mirrors, Olsen’s grand 2019 masterpiece (and a top 10 critically acclaimed record). At least 9 of the 11 songs should sound familiar to anyone who has heard All Mirrors. “Lark,” “Summer,” “Chance” – they’re all here, at least in some skeletal form and with slightly different titles. But these are not the demos for All Mirrors. Instead, Whole New Mess is its own record with its own immovable mood. [Limited clear smoke tranluscent vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nOndara – Folk N’ Roll Vol. 1: Tales Of Isolation CD (Verve Forecast)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer-songwriter J.S. Ondara, now mononymously known as Ondara, releases Folk N’ Roll Vol 1: Tales Of Isolation, a new collection of songs written in direct response to the current global pandemic. The album was composed and produced by Ondara while in lockdown in Minneapolis over the course of a week, and came out of Ondara’s deep need to create as a form of therapy during this incredibly uncertain time. “As I’m sure it has for all of us, I found the period of isolation to be wearing down the equilibrium of my sanity,” Ondara says. “After being stuck in a mental rut for four weeks, I woke up one morning and spent three days writing these songs and three more days recording them in a friend’s living room in Minneapolis. It was a kind of vomit of words and melodies, compulsive and without any control or forethought. I wasn’t trying to make a record, I wasn’t trying to do anything really; I was only trying to provide myself with some kind of therapy, a desperate attempt at preserving my sanity. They are stories about the ramifications of a whole population isolating; about the personal, political and economic scars that will linger for the rest of our lives long after we have found our way past this.” [Vinyl edition due September 18.]\n\nKelly Lee Owens – Inner Sound CD/LP (Smalltown Supersound)\n\nKelly Lee Owens’ masterful second album Inner Song finds the convention-blurring techno producer and singer/songwriter diving deep into her own psyche-excoriating the struggles she’s faced since the release of her breakout 2017 self-titled debut and exploring personal pain while embracing the beauty of the natural world.\n\nPain Of Salvation – Panther CD (Century Media)\n\nNew release from the progressive metal band. [Vinyl edition due September 4.]\n\nKaty Perry – Smile CD/LP (Capitol)\n\nColorful pop princess Katy Perry follows-up 2017’s Witness with the new studio album, Smile which she describes as “finding the light at the end of the tunnel” and her “journey towards the light, with stories of resilience, hope, and love.” The playful cover art perfectly aligns with Perry’s flair for costumes and eye-catching covers and features the pop singer as a dispirited clown, sporting a red nose. Perry has released a number of singles to roll out Smile including the Gold-certified “Never Really Over”, the earworm “Harleys In Hawaii”, atmospheric ballad “Daises” and the infectious title track which all but affirm Billboard’s assertion that “the Katy Perry Renaissance is here, undeniably and spectacularly. Perry is making her most exciting music in years, and within the span of a few months, she has completely shifted expectations for her next project among pop junkies.” [Limited white colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nPig Destroyer – The Octagonal Stairway CDEP/12” (Relapse)\n\nPig Destroyer return with a new EP.

[Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nGregory Porter – All Rise CD/2xLP/3xLP (Blue Note)\n\nGregory Porter, the world’s best-selling contemporary jazz/soul artist, releases his sixth studio album, All Rise. The record marks a return to Porter’s beloved original songwriting – heart-on-sleeve lyrics imbued with everyday philosophy and real-life detail, set to a stirring mix of jazz, soul, blues and gospel. Produced by Troy Miller (Laura Mvula, Jamie Cullum, Emili Sande), the set also represents the evolution of Porter’s art to something even more emphatic, emotive, intimate, and universal too. After 2017’s Nat King Cole & Me, Porter knew two things: one, he’d bring in an orchestra for his next LP, and two, the music is medicine. In the spirit of that latter revelation, All Rise brims with songs about irrepressible love, plus a little protest, because the road to healing is bumpy. [The deluxe colored vinyl triple-LP and deluxe CD editions include the two bonus tracks, “Real Truth” and “You Can Join My Band”, plus alternate cover art.]\n\nPrivate World – Aleph CD/LP (Dais)\n\nIn a sense, the songs that comprise Aleph are soothing vehicles that dart about pop history, stopping at touchpoints throughout the ’80s to borrow from jazz-tinged synth, ambient music, and even cinéma vérité. Yes, the album’s sounds work back to the masters of synth-pop but the actual journey bounds forward with vivid personality and contemporary control. [Limited transparent purple colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nPVRIS – Use Me CD/LP (WB)\n\nPVRIS deliver their highly-anticipated third studio album Use Me. On the new record, frontwoman, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer Lynn Gunn steps into a new chapter, as she owns her role as PVRIS’ leader and sole architect. The result is 11 pop conjurations of glitchy beat-craft, airy guitars, and spell-binding vocals. Lynn explains that lead single “Dead Weight” is “about being a people pleaser, holding others up and never asking for anything back. Quite often that can being taken advantage of and can be hard to say/set boundaries, this feels amplified especially as a woman. This song is about stepping into my power as a woman, shedding old skin and taking nurturing/caretaker feminine nature and turning it into a super power.” That newfound sense of freedom lies at the core of Use Me. [Limited indie store exclusive violet colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nDaniel Rodriguez – Sojourn Of A Burning Sun CD (BMG)\n\nDaniel Rodriguez recorded Sojourn Of A Burning Sun with his longtime friend and Elephant Revival bandmate Darren Garvey, and the pair tap into an earthy, organic palette here that’s as raw and direct as the lyrics, mixing timeless folk and bluegrass traditions with ‘70s AM radio warmth and lush, intimate production. The result is a magical bit of musical alchemy, a riveting, emotionally resonant record that transforms pain into growth, sorrow into gratitude, and despair into new beginnings. [Vinyl edition due October 2.]\n\nBobby Rush – Rawer Than Raw CD/LP (Deep Rush)\n\nBobby Rush pays homage to the great bluesmen from Mississippi on his 27th studio album, Rawer Than Raw. This is Rush, stripped down – just his guitar, harmonica, singing, and foot tapping. There’s a song from Skip James, Robert Johnson, Sonny Boy Williamson, Willie Dixon, and Howlin’ Wolf. One song is Public Domain originally recorded for the Library of Congress by Alan Lomax, but later made famous by Muddy Waters (“Honey Bee, Sail On”). Rawer Than Raw is the follow up to 2019’s Grammy nominated Sitting On Top Of The Blues and showcases Bobby Rush in his truest form without a backing band.\n\nSamia – The Baby CD/LP (Grand Jury)\n\nNew York-based singer/songwriter Samia Finnerty’s debut album, The Baby, is about learning how to be yourself, by yourself. Embarking on her first tours – far away from friends and alone in green rooms across the country – she began to untangle just how much of her own identity had been created by those she held close. Each of the album’s twelve songs find Samia holding up her relationships as a mirror, reflecting her own truths and learning how to show up for herself when there’s no one else around. The result of this introspection is an album that is bold and authentic, philosophizing while surgically examining the mundane.\n\nSavoy Brown – Ain’t Done Yet CD/LP (Quartro Valley Recs)\n\nNew release from the legendary British blues rock band still led by founding member Kim Simmonds. Ain’t Done Yet follows Savoy Brown’s critically acclaimed 2019 album, City Night.\n\nSeether – Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum CD/2xLP (Fantasy)\n\nProduced by Shaun Morgan and engineered and mixed by Matt Hyde (Deftones, AFI), Seether’s new album Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum, (which translates to “If you want peace, prepare for war”) was recorded in Nashville, TN over two months in December 2019 and January 2020. The follow-up to 2017’s Poison The Parish, Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum is the eighth album of the band’s illustrious career and features Shaun Morgan’s, aggressive, highly melodic songwriting, some of the most expressive, politically charged music he’s ever made. Seether is joined on the record by their newest member, Cory Lowery (former guitarist/vocalist for Saint Asonia and Stuck Mojo) who adds a broad new sonic dimension to the band’s studio and live work.\n\nElliott Smith – Elliot Smith [Expanded 25th Anniversary Edition] 2xCD/2xLP (Kill Rock Stars)\n\nWhen Elliott Smith’s self-titled second album came out in 1995, it was ignored by the press but championed by artists from the Beastie Boys to Fugazi. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of Elliott Smith, the Kill Rock Stars label is releasing a special deluxe package, which includes a new remastering of the original record; a 52-page hardcover book of previously unseen photographs by JJ Gonson with handwritten lyrics, and reminiscences from Smith’s friends and colleagues; and a bonus disc documenting the earliest-known recording of Smith performing as a solo act.\n\nG.E. Smith & Leroy Bell – Stony Hill CD (BMG)\n\nDebut collaboration album from guitar rock hero G.E. Smith and soul/R&B vocalist/guitarist LeRoy Bell.\n\nStand High Patrol – Our Own Way CD/LP (Stand High)\n\nConnoisseurs have long recognised Stand High’s credentials both as a dub group and a leading sound system, but they stand out from the crowd because of their ability to deliver the unexpected, whether live or on record.\n\nSilvia Tarozzi – Mi Specchio E Rifletto CD/LP (Unseen Worlds)\n\nInspired by the poetry of Alda Merini and her studies with composer Garret List, Italian violinist-composer Silvia Tarozzi turned to the song form after being involved for many years in contemporary music and free improvisation. Over the course of nearly a decade, Tarozzi practiced setting the poetry of Alda Merini to music and then replacing it with her own to reflect her own life experiences. As a result, Mi Specchio E Rifletto is a wondrous combination of baroque folk, avant-garde, and progressive music art-song that feels both poetic and earnestly autobiographical.\n\nToots and The Maytals – Got To Be Tough CD/LP (BMG)\n\nReggae pioneers Toots and The Maytals release their first original studio album in more than 10 years following 2010’s Flip And Twist. With Toots taking on horn and production duties himself, Got To Be Tough features Sly Dunbar on drums, Zak Starkey on guitar, and Cyril Neville on percussion. The album also includes a cover of Bob Marley’s “Three Little Bird” with Ziggy Marley. “This album is speaking out about injustices while pointing to a better time,” Hibbert tells Rolling Stone. “This album is teaching a path to recovery and a step to better days on the journey ahead. Got To Be Tough is a bind builder of positive objectives.”\n\nWalter Trout – Ordinary Madness CD/2xLP (Provogue)\n\nFor Walter Trout, there is no ‘us’ and ‘them’. Across his five-decade career, the great bluesman’s music has always been a lifeline and call-to-arms, reminding listeners they are not alone. Now, as the world seeks solace from a tragedy that has touched us all, he comes armed with a boundary-exploring new studio album and eleven searing, honest songs that bring his fans even closer. “There’s a lot of extraordinary madness going on right now,” considers Trout, of the COVID-19 crisis. “This album started because I was dealing with the flaws and weakness inside me. But it ended up being about everyone.” Ordinary Madness was completed mere days before the US shutdown, its cathartic songcraft and themes of shared troubles couldn’t chime better with a period in which our souls and spirits are under fire from tumultuous global events. [Limited edition colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nMolly Tuttle – but I’d rather be with you CD/LP (Compass)\n\nIn March 2020, Nashville-based artist Molly Tuttle experienced the devastating tornado that tore through much of East Nashville, followed by the global pandemic. Tuttle, who grew up in California and has toured as a solo artist for years, suddenly found herself – along with the rest of the musician community – sheltering at home. She found solace in revisiting favorite songs in an attempt to “remind myself why I love music.” She conceptualized an idea for a record with renowned L.A. producer Tony Berg (Phoebe Bridgers, Andrew Bird) to be recorded over 2,000 miles apart. Tuttle taught herself how to use Pro Tools, recorded and engineered all of her parts alone at home before sending them to Berg in Los Angeles, who enlisted legendary session musicians to add instrumentation in their respective home studios. The result is 10 tracks that cross the musical spectrum and the decades, from FKA Twigs to Cat Stevens, from Rancid to Karen Dalton. [Limited indie store exclusive vinyl pressing.]\n\nManuel Valera New Cuban Express Big Band – José Martí En Nueva York CD (Green Leaf Music)\n\nGrammy-nominated pianist and composer Manuel Valera (Paquito D’Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, Steve Smith) presents the dynamic debut of his New Cuban Express Big Band.

Addressing a range of political and societal issues that are relevant even today, the texts are set for two unique vocalists, Sofia Rei and Camila Meza. Valera uses the broad palette of the big band to express a wide breadth of moods and emotions, touching on traditional Cuban music styles as well as modern Latin jazz to give José Martí’s poetry new life.\n\nVarious Artists – Land Of Sensations & Delights: Psych Pop Sounds Of White Whale Records [1965-1970] CD (Craft Recordings)\n\n26-song compilation featuring hits and rarities from the White Whale catalog, featuring artists like Warren Zevon’s first band lyme & cybelle, Jim Ford, JK & Co, Nino Tempo & April Stevens, and more. The album chronicles five years of psych-pop sounds that came out of Los Angeles’ White Whale Records, most known for being the label of The Turtles. While The Turtles topped the charts, many White Whale gems slipped through the cracks, each getting their much deserved time under the spotlight in this release.\n\nVenom – Sons Of Satan CD/2xLP (Sanctuary)\n\nOften cited by bands such as Metallica, Behemoth, Celtic Frost and Mayhem as major influences, Venom is one of the most revered bands of their generation. Sons Of Satan is collection of the band’s early demo material from the period 1979 to 1983; 15 previously unreleased tracks from Venom’s formative years. Includes sleeve notes featuring new interviews with Cronos, Mantas and Abaddon plus rare and unseen photos from the bands early years.\n\nVenomous Concept – Politics Versus The Erection CD/LP (Season Of Mist)\n\nIf the state of today’s society is reflected in music, hardcore punk/grindcore veterans Venomous Concept return to the stage with a fitting soundtrack. On Politics Versus The Erection, Kevin Sharp (Brutal Truth), Shane Embury (Napalm Death), Danny Herrera (Napalm Death) and John Cooke (Corrupt Moral Altar) voice criticism and opinions with satirical animations, venomous lyrics, and 30 minutes of short, sharp musical blasts, creating a true hardcore punk spirit. This band’s fourth full-length frontal assault manifests a no-nonsense, outspoken and angry tone, resonating with the chaos that reigns over the world today.\n\nVladislav Delay/Sly Dunbar/Robbie Shakespeare – 500 Push Up CD/LP (Sub Rosa)\n\nSomewhere between the old school electronica culture, the soundscaping, the experimental paths of Lee Perry and Adrian Sherwood, ghostly clubbing anthems, minimalism, pop, jazz, without being influenced, Vladislav Delay is building a drifting and coherent sound enigma. Personnel: Vladislav Delay – electronics, sampling, percussion; Sly Dunbar – drums; Robbie Shakespeare – bass. [CD version includes two additional tracks.]\n\nColter Wall – Western Swing & Waltzes And Other Punchy Songs CD (La Honda)\n\nThe music industry is no stranger to cowboys – but it’s been a long while since any with an authentic affinity for the North American West came along and carried around a love for heroes like Ramblin’ Jack Elliot and Ian Tyson. Enter 24-year-old Colter Wall, whose dusty baritone voice and deep well of stories are almost single-handedly carrying traditional western music into the future. Wall’s approach is that of a preservationist, pure as the prairie wind, and is on full display on his new self-produced album Western Swing & WaltzesA Other Punchy Songs. Wall’s 10-track ode to the themes and labors of western life picks up where his last album left off, with a reverence for his “working cowboy kin” and a whole mess of cowboy songs.\n\nWidowspeak – Plum CD/LP (Captured Tracks)\n\nWith Plum, the songwriting partnership rooted in the creative rapport between singer Molly Hamilton and guitarist Robert Earl Thomas continues to expand on shared visions, delving deeper into what was always there: dusty guitars, ear-worm melodies, warm expansive arrangements. Each entry to their catalog has marked a subtle reimagining of Widowspeak’s sound, though perennial points of reference remain the same: ‘90s dream pop, ‘60s psych rock, a certain unshakeable Pacific-Northwestness. [Limited edition white colored vinyl pressing also available.]\n\nDVDs + Blu-ray:\n\nMetallica & San Francisco Symphony – DVD/Blu-ray (Blackened Recordings)\n\nS&M2 is a landmark release in the Metallica catalogue, both sonically and visually.

Featuring the current lineup of Kosnik, drummer Bob Pantella and guitarist Garrett Sweeny (all also members of Monster Magnet), the band returns with their latest 10-song opus Scorpio.\n\nBuju Banton – Upside Down 2020 2xLP (Roc Nation)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl.

After the collapse of the USSR, the ensemble began to experience serious difficulties with funding and booking concerts, and finally disintegrated, after which the participants lost contact with each other. Fortunately, thanks to efforts from the fans, some old contacts were reestablished, key records and sound sources were dug up, and now this historical record is released again. File under funk, jazz-rock, prog rock, or psychedelic rock.\n\nAdam Beyer – No Defeat No Retreat 12” (Drumcode)\n\nAn EP that gives a nod to uncertain times, while remaining resolutely positive, No Defeat No Retreat was written during Beyer’s fruitful production sessions during lock down. The opening track, “Park People” sets the pace with an energetic, ‘80s nu wave creating the track’s spine. Its hypnotic energy stems from a powerful synth riff and vocal sample culminating in a skillfully balanced track that neatly combines the old with the new. The title track is a study in contrasts, deftly crafting a muted, nagging vocal hook and infectious bass line into a slice of forward-facing, edgy techno. With its subtle, undulating layers of melody building in the background, it ushers in an understated sense of euphoria, making it a perfect end-offset mood-maker.\n\nBolt Thrower – Spearhead/Cenotaph LP (Earache)\n\nThe metal band’s 1991 Cenotaph and 1993 Spearhead have been reissued as a single-disc vinyl LP.\n\nSteve Maxwell von Braund – Return To Monster Planet LP (Roundtable)\n\nA compendium of lost tracks collected from 1974 to 1981, ranging from ARP synthesizer experiments to heady space rock to sophisticated electro-sounds of classic Cybotron, Return To Monster Planet offers a glimpse into the fascinating musical world of Steve Braund, one of the most marginalized yet singular artists to emerge from the golden (space) age of Australian music.\n\nBrother Theotis Taylor – Brother Theotis Taylor LP (Mississippi)\n\nBrother Theotis Taylor is a 92-year-old spiritual singer and piano player known throughout South Georgia and beyond for his powerful voice and heavenly falsetto. His music took him from his home in Fitzgerald, Georgia, to the stage with Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers, to Harlem’s Apollo, and even to Carnegie Hall. Though his releases are limited to six stunning and rare singles on the Pitch label and a single small-press LP, his recorded archive is vast. For much of his life, Brother Taylor kept a reel-to-reel recorder atop his piano at home. Brother Taylor recorded himself on this DIY home setup only when he was inspired by a higher power, often fasting and praying for days before recording. These intimate home recordings were recently digitized and can be heard for the first time on this release.\n\nRobert Calvert – Hype [Reissue/1981] LP (Purple Pyramid)\n\nColored vinyl (two pressings: blue and pink) reissue of the 1981 solo album from former Hawkwind frontman Robert Calvert.

Recorded on a two-track Revox machine, the album is an eclectic series of brief pieces-only two of the twenty tracks exceed four minutes-showcasing his poetic imagination and impressive range. While much of Comelade’s early work hints at many of the major electronic movements to come, Sentimientos remains earthbound and organic. Melodic fragments performed on piano, organ, plastic saxophone, vibes, guitar, toy piano, ukulele and synthesizer place Comelade’s boundless creative spirit on display.\n\nCurrents – The Place I Feel Safest 2xLP (Sharptone)\n\nCurrents is the new standard for death-infused metalcore. This is emotionally fraught and impossibly angry music soaked in cold, depressive atmosphere. Currents explore the forbidden realms of a tortured psyche, searching for meaning amidst uncertain chaos and venom. Heartache, physical abuse, abandonment, trauma; no dark emotion is spared examination. Limited clear with black and red splatter vinyl pressing.\n\nDashboard Confessional – The Swiss Army Romance [Reissue/2000] LP (Hidden Note)\n\nVinyl reissue of the emo band’s debut album. [Limited red colored pressing also available.]\n\nDMX – Greatest LP (Cleopatra)\n\nLimited picture disc vinyl featuring newly recorded versions of DMX’s hit singles “Where The Hood At”, “Party Up (Up In Here)”, “What’s My Name?”, “X Gon’ Give It To Ya”, “Ruff Ryders’ Anthem”, and more.\n\nEvergrey ‎– Glorious Collision [Reissue/2011] 2xLP (AFM)\n\nTwo limited colored vinyl represses: clear and blue.

Powered, as ever, by brothers and co-front men Peter and David Brewis Field Music (Measure) is a gloriously rich collection that entwines the brother’s renewed love of the rock music cannon with a rediscovery of some of pop’s overlooked adventurers.\n\nFluence ‎– Fluence [Reissue/1975] LP (Etats-Unis)\n\nFluence is the brainchild and first release of sound artist / provocateur Pascal Comelade. Recorded in Montpellier, France in 1974-1975, the project consists of exploratory electronic pieces in the Fripp & Eno vernacular with a Kosmische tinge.\n\nJosephine Foster – This Coming Gladness [Reissue/2008] LP+MP3 (Fire America)\n\nAn essential reissue of Josephine Foster’s crucially revered classic, This Coming Gladness, released for the first time on vinyl since 2008. The vinyl comes with brand new artwork and is housed in a reverse board sleeve with a download card. “Josephine’s best effort to date, deserves top grades in every aspect: songwriting, production, and that voice.” — AllMusic\n\nPeter Gabriel ‎– Plays Live [Reissue/1983] 2xLP+MP3 (Real World)\n\nDouble 180gm vinyl pressing, half-speed remastered.

It is effectively a sign-off to the first phase of Peter Gabriel the solo artist.\n\nStan Getz & Joao Gilberto – Getz/Gilberto [Reissue/1964] LP (Verve)\n\nLimited 180gm vinyl pressing in deluxe gatefold jacket. The marvelous album, Getz/Gilberto, had a profound influence upon the face of jazz and American popular music.

Along with producer Jason Suecof, vocalist Jonny Davy, guitarists Al Glassman and Tony Sannicandro, bassist Nick Schendzielos, and session drummer Danny Walker crafted a cerebral and accomplished piece of technical death metal. Limited colored vinyl pressing also available.\n\nKennélmus ‎– Folkstone Prism [Reissue/1971] LP (Modern Harmonic)\n\nMaybe it’s their proximity to all that funny-tasting cactus, but Arizona has produced more than its share of mind-bending rock combos and Kennélmus might just be the wildest of the bunch. The Chantays sand wrestling with the Electric Prunes, refereed by Captain Beefheart almost certainly describes the mind-bending sound of Kennélmus.\n\nKikagaku Moyo ‎– Forest Of Lost Children [Reissue/2014] LP (Beyond Beyond Is Beyond)\n\nLimited colored vinyl reissue. Kikagaku Moyo here sound anything but lost, their child-like wonder manifested in a confident, courageous exploration of sound. Labels like “psychedelic”, “folk”, “prog-rock”, “psychedelic-folk-mixed-with-prog-rock” do little to accurately reflect the spectrum of influences on display, let alone the more impactful realization of completeness in Kikagaku Moyo’s songs.\n\nLos Shakers ‎– Los Shakers/Break It All [Reissue/1965/1966] LP (Guerssen)\n\nLos Shakers ‎– Shakers For You [Reissue/1966] LP (Guerssen)\n\nLos Shakers ‎– La Conferencia Secreta Del Toto’s Bar [Reissue/1968] LP (Guerssen)\n\nShakers – In The Studio Again [Reissue/1971] LP (Guerssen)\n\nVinyl reissues of the Uruguayan rock/pop band’s first three albums as Los Shakers and their fourth album as Shakers.\n\nCory Marks – Who I Am LP (Better Noise Music)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl.

Marlowe is a collaborative alt-rap project from North Carolina-based hip-hop producer L’Orange and rapper Solemn Brigham. Their unique blend of quick-fire vocals and dusty breakbeats is most well-known on tracks such as “Lost Arts” and “Tales From The East”.\n\nJackie McLean ‎– It’s Time! [Reissue/1965] LP (Blue Note)\n\nThis impassioned 1964 quintet session weaves post-bop and free jazz into spirited original compositions by Jackie McLean and young trumpet sensation Charles Tolliver. They were joined by Herbie Hancock (piano), Cecil McBee (bass) and Roy Haynes (drums). While the style was considered new at the time, the searing cry of the blues is ever-present in McLean’s brilliant alto saxophone playing. Reissued as part of The Blue Note Tone Poet Series: all-analog, remastered 180gm vinyl in deluxe gatefold packaging.\n\nDonna Missal – Lighter LP (Harvest)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. “True to its title, Lighter is full of high-intensity moments primed for a stadium crowd to whip out phones. It’s a raw break-up record, from the sparse desperation of rock ballads like ‘Carefully’, to the vulnerable vibrato of folk song ‘Bloom’. Missal’s deep husk of a voice is an immense instrument, and while she does a lot of belting, it’s at its most impactful when she shows a spectrum of restraint and power within one song, as she does on the smoldering ‘Just Like You’, and the acoustic guitar-peppered opener ‘How Does It Feel?’ (the latter feels made for summer movie credits).” – The Guardian\n\nMoon Duo – Escape: Expanded Edition LP (Sacred Bone)\n\nTo celebrate the tenth anniversary of Moon Duo’s long-out-of-print 2010 debut Escape, Sacred Bones is proud to present a new deluxe version of the album.

My Morning Jacket has built a reputation as a group who consistently challenges the paradigms in which they are placed. From psychedelic to soul to classic rock & roll, MMJ’s range has remained steadfast throughout the band’s 20 plus years. While much of the John Leckie (XTC, Radiohead) produced Z (2005) came as a shock, even the surprises should seem perfectly natural in hindsight. The combination of the hushed, indie balladry of their early records with the spacious guitar rock of 2003 breakout It Still Moves was to be expected, but here they deliver newer, more exotic rhythms and textures, which made it clear that this was a great band, doing great things, who were maybe playing it safe previously.\n\nOpeth ‎– Orchid [Reissue/1995] 2xLP (Spinefarm)\n\nLimited double pink with white & red marble swirl colored vinyl pressing of the debut studio album by the Swedish progressive metal band.\n\nDan Penn And Spooner Oldham ‎– Moments From This Theatre [Reissue/1999] LP (The Last Music Company)\n\nDan Penn and Spooner Oldham have now been friends and cohorts for many years, and this long overdue vinyl edition of their timeless classics celebrates, with characteristic understatement, this partnership for the ages, providing captivating evidence of their chemical deal together which adds up to quiet brilliance.\n\nPole – Pole 1 [Reissue/1998] 2xLP (Mute)\n\nPole – Pole 2 [Reissue/1999] 2xLP (Mute)\n\nPole – Pole 3 [Reissue/2000] 2xLP (Mute)\n\nStefan Betke aka Pole’s holy trilogy of frayed dub experiments resurfaces for a 20th anniversary reissue, taking us back to smoky nights at the turn of the century and some of the finest post basic-channel dub echoes ever released. Essential listening if you’re into anything from Rhythm & Sound to Vainqueuer, Jon Hassell to Jackie Mittoo. The Pole aesthetic is patently laid out in 1, where his organic clicks ‘n’ pops come out to play accompanied by lilting organ and jazzy bass channeling Jackie Mittoo via Jon Hassell and Rhythm & Sound into a uniquely, gauzy, gaseous state.\n\nThe Ridiculous Trio ‎– Plays The Stooges [Reissue/2004] LP (Modern Harmonic)\n\nRecently reissued on CD – now available on vinyl. A crazed tuba and trombone reinterpretation of the piercing punkadelic music created by The Stooges. Thrashing cymbals and bashing drums locked in step with unrelenting tuba riffs, reinforced by otherworldly trombone writhing and sliding and bending (just like Iggy onstage), sounding somewhere between a disheveled wah-wah guitar or a kazoo. Available for the first time as a complete album.\n\nSelf Defense Family – Make Me A Pallet Fire On Your Floor b/w Local Clerics 7” (Run For Cover)\n\nOver the years Self Defense Family’s revolving lineup and improvisational writing process has led to the band often recording new music while on tour, putting the focus on capturing a specific moment between the current collaborators. The Island singles have been snapshots of the band in studios all over the world, from Jamaica, to Iceland, to Scotland, and now Australia. The songs on “Make Me A Pallet Fire On Your Floor” b/w “Local Clerics” are marked by a raw, spacious recording, winding guitar lines mixed with swirling organ, and of course Kindlon’s one-of-a-kind vocals and unflinching lyricism. Limited blue colored vinyl pressing.\n\nSlugdge ‎– Born Of Slime [Reissue/2013] 2xLP (Willowtip)\n\nThe debut album by Slugdge is finally available on vinyl. A mix of random colored pressings are available.\n\nSomeone – ORBIT II LP (PIAS America)\n\nFeaturing 12 psychedelic pop songs, ORBIT II is both art and music. The package contains five interactive artwork cards. Each matches up to a song from the album, and when viewed through the Someone presents: ORBIT app on a smart-device, they spring to life in augmented reality. All the artwork is designed by Someone herself, and portrays a surrealist, dreamy universe filled with abstract shapes, cosmic constellations and glowing sunsets. The lyrics appear in midair, and listeners can interact through touch and swipe, drawing them further into the narrative.\n\nNeville Staple ‎– Rude Boy Returns [Reissue/2004] LP (Cleopatra)\n\nA special limited edition picture disc vinyl reissue of the 2004 album from Specials toaster and 2-tone ska superstar. A must-have for ska lovers and Specials devotees.\n\nStanley Turrentine ‎– That’s Where It’s At [Reissue/1962] LP (Blue Note)\n\nWhat happens when you combine Stanley Turrentine’s blues-drenched tenor saxophone with Les McCann’s soulful, funky piano? You end up with one of their best albums, considered to be a foundational session of soul jazz. They are joined by bassist Herbie Lewis and drummer Otis Candy Finch. Reissued as part of The Blue Note Tone Poet Series: all-analog, remastered 180gm vinyl in deluxe gatefold packaging.\n\nUlver – Flowers Of Evil CD/LP (House Of Mythology)\n\nNew album from the Norwegian cult band. The band stated: “Flowers Of Evil finds the wolf pack exploring the fear and wonder of mankind’s fall from redemption. Visions similar to those of Orsini come to mind, as untamed life abounds…”\n\nUnleash The Archers – Abyss 2xLP (Napalm)\n\nReleased last week on CD – now available on vinyl. Abyss succeeds in showcasing the mind-blowing technical craftsmanship of the young Canadian melodic power metal quartet with the perfect mix of highly complex, catchy bangers and moody, synth-infused power ballads. Pairing traditional heavy sounds in the vein of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest with fast-paced power metal, the album is once again accented by frontwoman Brittney Slayes’ raw four octave mezzo-soprano.\n\nVarious Artists – AngelHeaded Hipster: The Songs Of Marc Bolan & T. Rex 2xLP (BMG)\n\nIndie store exclusive vinyl pressing. CD due September 4. The genius and pioneering influence of Marc Bolan’s T. Rex – 2020 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee and one of the great rock musicians of all time – is celebrated with AngelHeaded Hipster: The Songs Of Marc Bolan & T. Rex. The collection features 26 songs culled from Bolan’s vast body of work released as T. Rex and Tyrannosaurus Rex from 1968-77. A wide-ranging cast of wizards and cosmic dancers have joined together to re-imagine Bolan’s work including Nick Cave, U2 featuring Elton John, Joan Jett, and Peaches among others – sometimes in radical fashion – resulting in a collection that is less tribute than bold new work.\n\nVarious Artists – Dennis Hopper’s The Last Movie [OST] LP (Earth)\n\nAfter the incredible success of the film Easy Rider, Dennis Hopper was given complete freedom to direct and star in the bizarre, The Last Movie (1971). Filmed in a drug fueled haze in Peru with Hopper, Peter Fonda, Kris Kristofferson, Dean Stockwell, Michelle Phillips, Russ Tamblyn, and Samuel Fuller, there has never been a soundtrack to this film until now. Featuring the first ever performances of Kristofferson’s legendary “Me And Bobby McGee” plus sublime country-folk songs from John Buck Wilkin, Peruvian folk & dance music – all recorded live on set in Peru without overdubs.\n\nSibusile Xaba ‎– Ngiwu Shwabada LP (Komos)\n\nWith a vocal style that is part dreamscaping and part ancestral invocation, Xaba divines as opposed to plainly singing. Combined with a guitar style that is rooted in expressive picking, Xaba’s music shatters the confines of genre, taking only the fundamentals from mentors such as Madala Kunene and Dr. Philip Tabane and imbuing these with a mythology and improvisational intensity all of his own. Maskandi, malombo, the desert blues and jazz all figure in Sibusile Xaba’s expansive vocabulary, albeit through a magnetic individual filter."
