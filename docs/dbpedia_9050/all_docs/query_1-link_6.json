        "text": "METALLICA Issue ‘No Leaf Clover’ Live Video From ‘Metallica And San Francisco Symphony: S&M²’ DVD / Blu-ray\n\nAugust 28th, 2020\n\nSan Francisco, California-based heavy metal band Metallica have released a live performance video for the track ‘For Whom The Bell Tolls’. Taken from their recently released DVD / Blu-ray Metallica And San Francisco Symphony: S&M², the clip can be viewed below.\n\nMetallica issued live album and video set Metallica And San Francisco Symphony: S&M² on August 28th, 2020 through Blackened Recordings.\n\nAn official video trailer for the outing can also be seen below.\n\nThe band commented: “In September of 2019, we were on stage for two incredible nights with the San Francisco Symphony commemorating the opening of the new Chase Center here in our backyard as well as the 20th anniversary of the first S&M. Celebrating with fans from all around the world (almost 70 countries represented!) and sharing the stage with our hometown symphony, its legendary Music Director Michael Tilson Thomas, and conductor Edwin Outwater, was beyond inspiring and a major highlight in our crazy, cool time as a band.\n\n“S&M² is coming your way in a number of formats, ranging from standard 4LP vinyl, collectible coloured vinyl, 2CD, DVD, Blu-ray, and Deluxe Box set, all the way up to the Fifth Member™ exclusive Super Deluxe Box, limited to 500 copies (which members can enter to reserve), each featuring original sheet music used in the show and signed by all four band members. Including the first-ever symphonic renditions of songs written and released since those first S&M shows, the album was produced by Greg Fidelman with Hetfield and Ulrich.\n\n“So why did this take almost 12 months to release? The concert film is a brand-new edit done by Joe Hutshing and both the audio and visuals have been taken to the next level from the October 2019 theatrical version that played in over 3,700 cinemas worldwide. Originally planned for a mid-June release, unfortunately pressing plants and printers closed due to COVID-19 just as we were getting ready to manufacture the various configurations. We’re excited that we’re back on track, everything’s in motion, and we can finally get the music to you.”\n\nThe track listing is as follows:\n\n01. ‘The Ecstasy Of Gold’ (Ennio Morricone cover)\n\n02. ‘The Call Of Ktulu’\n\n03. ‘For Whom The Bell Tolls’\n\n04. ‘The Day That Never Comes’\n\n05. ‘The Memory Remains’\n\n06. ‘Confusion’\n\n07. ‘Moth Into Flame’\n\n08. ‘The Outlaw Torn’\n\n09. ‘No Leaf Clover’\n\n10. ‘Halo On Fire’\n\n11. ‘Scythian Suite, Opus 20 II: The Enemy God And The Dance Of The Dark Spirits’ (Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev cover)\n\n12. ‘The Iron Foundry, Opus 19’ (Alexander Mosolov cover)\n\n13. ‘The Unforgiven III’\n\n14. ‘All Within My Hands’\n\n15. ‘(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth’\n\n16. ‘Wherever I May Roam’\n\n17. ‘One’\n\n18. ‘Master Of Puppets’\n\n19. ‘Nothing Else Matters’\n\n20. ‘Enter Sandman’\n\nMetallica’s line-up is as follows:\n\nJames Hetfield (vocals and guitar)\n\nKirk Hammett (guitar)\n\nRobert Trujillo (bass)\n\nLars Ulrich (drums)\n\nLive performance videos for ‘All Within My Hands’, ‘Nothing Else Matters’, ‘Moth Into Flame’ and ‘For Whom The Bell Tolls’ can also be viewed below.\n\nTenth studio album Hardwired…To Self-Destruct was released in November 2016 via Metallica’s own Blackened Recordings label.\n\nPromotional photograph by Ross Halfin."
