        "text": "Metallica aren’t just heavy, they’re durable. A muscular band that simply won’t rust with the passing of time — more than 40 years of it.\n\nWith the release of 72 Seasons, the Bay Area rockers unleash their 12th studio album. Six of them have gone to No. 1 on Billboard 200, led by 1991’s The Black Album, which checked in for a full month at the chart penthouse and is recognized as one of the best-selling heavy albums in recorded music history.\n\nProduced by Greg Fidelman with frontman James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, 72 Seasons spans 12 tracks, including the previously released “If Darkness Had a Son” and “Lux Æterna,” which the band performed on late-night TV earlier in the week, the first of a week-long residency on Jimmy Kimmel Live.\n\nFor their final act on Kimmel, the rockers turned it up for a storming rendition of “If Darkness Had A Son,” which can be seen in full below. That’s two new tunes, two classics in four nights — something for every headbanger.\n\nThe new collection clocks in 77 minutes, all of them meaty, and it’s the followup to 2016’s Hardwired…To Self-Destruct, which led the Billboard 200 for a single week.\n\nSpeaking on the meaning behind the album and its title, Hetfield remarked, “72 seasons. The first 18 years of our lives that form our true or false selves. The concept that we were told ‘who we are’ by our parents. A possible pigeonholing around what kind of personality we are.”\n\nMuch of our adult experience is “reenactment or reaction to these childhood experiences. Prisoners of childhood or breaking free of those bondages we carry,” he continues.\n\nIt’s fair to say, these Rock And Roll Hall of Famers have figured out who and what they are.\n\nLive action is coming soon, with Metallica kicking off their M72 World Tour on April 27 at Amsterdam’s Johan Cruijff Arena.\n\nThe fresh set dropped at the stroke of midnight, via Metallica’s own Blackened Recordings.\n\nStream 72 Seasons below."
