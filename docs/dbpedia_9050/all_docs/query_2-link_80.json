        "text": "Metallica today (16th March 2017) announced the European leg of their ‘WorldWired’ Tour in support of their new album “Hardwired… To Self-Destruct”, including six UK shows in London, Manchester, Glasgow and Birmingham in October. The tour kicks off with two shows in Amsterdam at the Ziggo Dome on September 4th and 6th. Norway’s Kvelertak will be support for the tour run.\n\nPresale tickets will be available to Legacy Met Club members beginning on Tuesday, March 21st at 10:00 AM CET, with presale tickets available to all Fifth Members beginning on Tuesday, March 21st at 11:00 AM CET. Tickets go on sale to the general public beginning Friday, March 24th.\n\nEvery ticket purchased through official outlets includes the choice of a standard digital or standard physical copy of “Hardwired…To Self-Destruct”. Redemption information will be included in ticket purchase confirmation emails.\n\nMetallica has partnered with CID Entertainment to offer three options of special enhanced experiences on this tour, including premium tickets and amenities, early access to the venue, a visit to the ‘Memory Remains’ exhibit of memorabilia, and meet and greets. “Hardwired…To Self-Destruct”, was released on November 18th last year (2016) on Metallica’s own Blackened Recordings record label and debuted at No. 1 around the world, selling over 800,000 copies worldwide in its first week. The album was produced by Greg Fidelman with James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.\n\nPraise for “Hardwired…To Self-Destruct”, includes: The New York Times: “Metallica has embraced its adulthood, reclaiming the attack of its music while jettisoning the image of a hard-rock band as young, fast and out of control;” Rolling Stone: “Metallica’s “Hardwired” shreds back to vintage eighties terror”. Kerrang!: “This is Metallica galvanized, refreshed, refocused and rediscovering themselves. Best thing they’ve done since The Black album? Yep.” The Guardian: “Metallica have just made their finest record in 25 years;” NME: “Metallica remain both vital and innovative”.\n\nMetallica formed in 1981 by drummer Lars Ulrich and guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield and has become one of the most influential and commercially successful rock bands in history, having sold 110 million albums worldwide while playing to millions of fans on literally all seven continents. They have scored several multi-platinum albums, including 1991’s Metallica (commonly referred to as The Black Album), with sales of nearly 17 million copies in the United States alone. Metallica has also garnered numerous awards and accolades, including nine Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, and multiple MTV Video Music Awards, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in 2009. In December 2013, Metallica made history when they performed a rare concert in Antarctica, becoming the first act to ever play all seven continents all within a year, and earning themselves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nThe band opening for them on this tour, formed in Stavanger, Norway, Kvelertak are a chart-topping, award-winning band who have celebrated critical acclaim around the globe along with four Spellemann Awards (Norway’s Grammy equivalent). They have released three albums. Their latest LP, Nattesferd, garnered “Most Anticipated” accolades from Rolling Stone, Stereogum and Consequence of Sound leading up to its release in May of 2016, and quickly established itself as one of the most celebrated releases of the year. Rolling Stone hailed the collection in their “Best Metal Records of 2016 So Far” asserting, “…Kvelertak have become heavy metal’s most compelling crossover linchpin and lightning rod.”\n\nSept. 4, 2017 – Amsterdam, Netherlands – Ziggo Dome Sept. 6, 2017 – Amsterdam, Netherlands – Ziggo Dome Sept. 8, 2017 – Paris, France – AccorHotels Arena Sept. 10, 2017 – Paris, France – AccorHotels Arena Sept. 12, 2017 – Lyon, France – Halle Tony Garnier Sept. 14, 2017 – Cologne, Germany – Lanxess Arena Sept. 16, 2017 – Cologne, Germany – Lanxess Arena Oct. 22, 2017 – London, England, UK – The O2 Arena Oct. 24, 2017 – London, England, UK – The O2 Arena Oct. 26, 2017 – Glasgow, Scotland, UK – The SSE Hydro Oct. 28, 2017 – Manchester, England, UK – Manchester Arena Oct. 30, 2017 – Birmingham, England, UK – Genting Arena Nov. 1, 2017 – Antwerp, Belgium – Sportpaleis Nov. 3, 2017 – Antwerp, Belgium – Sportpaleis Feb. 1, 2018 – Lisbon, Portugal – MEO Arena Feb. 3, 2018 – Madrid, Spain – Wizink Center Feb. 5, 2018 – Madrid, Spain – Wizink Center Feb. 7, 2018 – Barcelona, Spain – Palau Sant Jordi Feb. 10, 2018 – Turin, Italy – Pala Alpitour Feb. 12, 2018 – Bologna, Italy – Unipol Arena Feb. 14, 2018 – Bologna, Italy – Unipol Arena Feb. 16, 2018 – Mannheim, Germany – SAP Arena Mar. 27, 2018 – Herning, Denmark – Jyske Bank Boxen Mar. 29, 2018 – Hamburg, Germany – Barclaycard Arena Mar. 31, 2018 – Vienna, Austria – Wiener Stadthalle April 2, 2018 – Prague, Czech Republic – O2 Arena April 5, 2018 – Budapest, Hungary – Sports Arena April 7, 2018 – Stuttgart, Germany – Schleyerhalle April 9, 2018 – Stuttgart, Germany – Schleyerhalle April 11, 2018 – Geneva, Switzerland – Palexpo April 26, 208 – Munich, Germany – Olympiahalle April 28, 2018 – Krakow, Poland – Tauron Arena April 30, 2018 – Leipzig, Germany – Leipzig Arena May 2, 2018 – Oslo, Norway – Telenor Arena May 5, 2018 – Stockholm, Sweden – Ericsson Globe May 7, 2018 – Stockholm, Sweden – Ericsson Globe May 9, 2018 – Helsinki, Finland – Hartwall Arena May 11, 2018 – Helsinki, Finland – Hartwall Arena."
