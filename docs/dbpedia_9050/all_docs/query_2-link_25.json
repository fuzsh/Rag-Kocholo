        "text": "VIA PRESS RELEASE | Today Metallica commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of their breakthrough fourth album …And Justice For All with the announcement of its definitive reissue, out November 2nd on the band’s own Blackened Recordings.\n\nThe re-release of …And Justice For All has been remastered for the most advanced sound quality, as overseen by Greg Fidelman, and will be available in multiple digital and physical configurations. Pre-orders begin today at www.metallica.com where fans can see the full package details and track listing. Pre-orders of all configurations will receive an instant download of “Dyers Eve (Remastered),” while pre-orders of the expanded and deluxe editions will receive an additional instant download of “Eye of the Beholder (Live at Hammersmith Odeon, London, England—October 10th, 1988).”\n\nThe …And Justice For All reissue will be available physically as a Standard Double 180 gram LP, Standard CD, 3 CD Expanded Edition, Cassette, Limited Edition Deluxe Box Set, and digitally as a Standard album (available to stream and download), an Expanded Edition (available for download only), and a Digital Deluxe Box Set (available for streaming and download).\n\nThe Expanded Edition will include previously unreleased demos, rough mixes, previously unreleased live tracks, and an expanded booklet of never-before-seen Ross Halfin photos. The one-pressing-only Limited Edition Deluxe Box Set will include the remastered double 180g LP, a “One” picture disc, 3 LPs featuring their iconic performance from Seattle in 1989 remixed by Greg Fidelman, 11 CDs, 4 DVDs, a set of four patches, a Pushead print, a tour laminate, lyric sheets, a download card for all material in the set, and a deluxe 120-page book with never-before-seen photos and never-before told stories from the people who were there.\n\n…And Justice For All was originally released—despite what the internet might tell you— September 7th, 1988, on Elektra Records. Certified 8x Platinum in the United States, …And Justice For All marked a series of firsts for Metallica: The first full length Metallica recording to feature bassist Jason Newsted, the first Metallica album to crack the U.S. Top 10 where it peaked at #6, the band’s first video and top 40 single (“One”), their debut performance on the Grammy Awards, as well as their first Grammy loss (Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental for …And Justice for All), and first Grammy win (Best Metal Performance for “One”). It also received more widespread critical acclaim than any of its predecessors, with Rolling Stone hailing the album as “a marvel of precisely channeled aggression,” Spin calling it “a gem of a double record,” and ultimately placing in the Village Voice annual Pazz & Jop critics poll of the year’s best reviewed albums."
