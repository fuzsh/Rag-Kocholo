        "text": "METALLICA RELEASE “72 SEASONS” TITLE TRACK AND NEW VIDEO OUT NOW\n\nNEW ALBUM OUT APRIL 14, 2023\n\nM72 WORLD TOUR 2023-2024\n\nTICKETS ON SALE AT METALLICA.COM\n\n30 MARCH 2023 (TORONTO, ON) - Metallica has unveiled the title track of its forthcoming 12th studio album, 72 Seasons. A seven-and-a-half-minute opus that opens the new record, “72 Seasons” is the fourth advance offering from its namesake—following the recent release of the “epic” (Rolling Stone) “If Darkness Had A Son,” hailed by Consequence as “a sonic retrospective of (Metallica’s) career,” as well as the “scorching” (Guitar World) “Screaming Suicide” and “thundering, breakneck” (Billboard) first single “Lux Æterna.\"\n\n“72 Seasons” sets the tone for the expansive and unrelenting 12-song, 77-minute album. The Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett-penned epic is nothing short of an embodiment of the concept behind the new record’s title, as previously detailed in James Hetfield’s own words: “72 seasons. The first 18 years of our lives that form our true or false selves. The concept that we were told ‘who we are’ by our parents. A possible pigeonholing around what kind of personality we are. I think the most interesting part of this is the continued study of those core beliefs and how it affects our perception of the world today. Much of our adult experience is reenactment or reaction to these childhood experiences. Prisoners of childhood or breaking free of those bondages we carry.”\n\n“72 Seasons,” the song, is available now to stream and download, and as an instant grat track with all pre-orders. 72 Seasons, the album, will be released April 14, 2023 via Metallica’s own Blackened Recordings. Produced by Greg Fidelman with Hetfield & Ulrich, 72 Seasons is the first new Metallica studio album since 2016’s Hardwired…To Self-Destruct. It will be released on 2LP 140g black vinyl and limited-edition variants, CD, digital, and in Dolby Atmos (streaming where available). For a full listing of configurations, pre-orders and further information, go to https://www.metallica.com/store/72-seasons/\n\nTickets are on sale now for all shows on Metallica’s M72 world tour. Presented worldwide by Liquid Death and Blackened American Whiskey (in North America only) and promoted by Live Nation, M72 will see the band playing two nights in every city it visits—with each No Repeat Weekend featuring two completely different setlists and support lineups. The M72 tour will feature a bold new in-the-round stage design that relocates the famed Metallica Snake Pit to center stage, as well as the I Disappear full-tour pass and more. For further information on single day and two day tickets, enhanced experiences and more, go to https://www.metallica.com/tour/\n\nA portion of proceeds from every ticket sold will go to Metallica's All Within My Hands foundation. Founded in 2017, AWMH’s efforts to assist and enrich the lives of members of the communities who have supported the band have raised nearly $13 million – providing $5.9 million in grants to career and technical education programs in the US, over $2.5 million to combat food insecurity, and more than $3.2 million to disaster relief efforts worldwide.\n\nMETALLICA\n\nM72 WORLD TOUR 2023-2024\n\nThursday, April 27 2023 - Amsterdam NL - Johan Cruijff Arena\n\nSaturday, April 29 2023 - Amsterdam NL - Johan Cruijff Arena\n\nWednesday, May 17 2023 - Paris FR - Stade de France*\n\nFriday, May 19 2023 - Paris FR - Stade de France\n\nFriday, May 26 2023 - Hamburg DE - Volksparkstadion\n\nSunday, May 28 2023 - Hamburg DE - Volksparkstadion\n\nFriday, June 16 2023 - Gothenburg SE - Ullevi Stadium**\n\nSunday, June 18 2023 - Gothenburg SE - Ullevi Stadium\n\nFriday, August 4 2023 - East Rutherford, NJ - MetLife Stadium\n\nSunday, August 6 2023 - East Rutherford, NJ - MetLife Stadium\n\nFriday, August 11 2023 - Montreal, QC - Stade Olympique\n\nSunday, August 13 2023 - Montreal, QC - Stade Olympique\n\nFriday, August 18 2023 - Arlington, TX - AT&T Stadium\n\nSunday, August 20 2023 - Arlington, TX - AT&T Stadium\n\nFriday, August 25 2023 - Inglewood, CA - SoFi Stadium\n\nSunday, August 27 2023 - Inglewood, CA - SoFi Stadium\n\nFriday, September 1 2023 - Glendale, AZ - State Farm Stadium\n\nSunday, September 3, 2023 - Glendale, AZ - State Farm Stadium\n\nFriday, November 3, 2023 - St. Louis, MO - The Dome at America’s Center\n\nSunday, November 5, 2023 - St. Louis, MO - The Dome at America’s Center\n\nFriday, November 10, 2023 - Detroit, MI - Ford Field\n\nSunday, November 12, 2023 - Detroit, MI - Ford Field\n\nFriday, May 24 2024 - Munich DE - Olympiastadion\n\nSunday, May 26 2024 - Munich DE - Olympiastadion\n\nFriday, June 7 2024 - Helsinki FI - Olympic Stadium\n\nSunday, June 9 2024 - Helsinki FI - Olympic Stadium\n\nFriday, June 14 2024 - Copenhagen DK - Parken Stadium\n\nSunday, June 16 2024 - Copenhagen DK - Parken Stadium\n\nFriday, July 5 2024 - Warsaw PL - PGE Narodowy\n\nSunday, July 7 2024 - Warsaw PL - PGE Narodowy\n\nFriday, July 12 2024 - Madrid ES - Estadio Cívitas Metropolitano\n\nSunday, July 14 2024 - Madrid ES - Estadio Cívitas Metropolitano\n\nFriday, August 2 2024 - Foxborough, MA - Gillette Stadium\n\nSunday, August 4 2024 - Foxborough, MA - Gillette Stadium\n\nFriday, August 9 2024 - Chicago, IL - Soldier Field\n\nSunday, August 11 2024 - Chicago, IL - Soldier Field\n\nFriday, August 16 2024 - Minneapolis, MN - US Bank Stadium\n\nSunday, August 18 2024 - Minneapolis, MN - US Bank Stadium\n\nFriday, August 23 2024 - Edmonton, AB - Commonwealth Stadium\n\nSunday, August 25 2024 - Edmonton, AB - Commonwealth Stadium\n\nFriday, August 30 2024 - Seattle, WA - Lumen Field\n\nSunday, September 1 2024 - Seattle, WA - Lumen Field\n\nFriday, September 20 2024 - Mexico City MX - Foro Sol***\n\nSunday, September 22 2024 - Mexico City MX - Foro Sol\n\nFriday, September 27 2024 - Mexico City MX - Foro Sol***\n\nSunday, September 29 2024 - Mexico City MX - Foro Sol"
