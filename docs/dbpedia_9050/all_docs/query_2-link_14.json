        "text": "Metallica has released a behind the scenes video from the making of their forthcoming album, Hardwired… To Self-Destruct, due on November 18th from Blackened Records. You can watch the nine-minute video from the writing and recording sessions for the new album, at this link or below:\n\nHardwired… To Self-Destruct is the long-awaited follow-up to 2008’s Death Magnetic, and is a double album containing a dozen songs and nearly 80 minutes of music.\n\nDrummer Lars Ulrich told Fox 9 that the band played Hardwired.. “all in the same room” for the first time ob Monday, August 15 in preparation for the Minneapolis concert on 8/20. “This is as fresh off the assembly line as rock and roll gets.” he remarked.\n\nReferring to the track ‘Hardwired’ he continued: “That’s actually the last song we wrote for the record. We started this album by throwing different ideas around. The shape of it, as a collection of songs, didn’t come into focus until we were deep into it. At that point, the songs were getting tighter, shorter and leaner.”\n\nHe continued: “A couple of months ago, we were sitting there taking stock of the record and thought maybe we should write one more fast, little crazy song, and that became ‘Hardwired’. It just kind of happened. I think James (Hetfield) and I wrote and recorded it in less than a week, which, for us, is basically a nanosecond.”\n\nHardwired…To Self-Destruct was produced by Greg Fidelman with Hetfield and Ulrich. The band recorded the disc at its own studio and is still putting the finishing touches on the LP.\n\nBuy thr album here: https://amzn.to/3qpkpkg\n\nMetallica online\n\nMetallica on Twitter\n\nMetallica on Facebook\n\nMetallica on Instagram\n\nMetallica on YouTube\n\nOn the heels of dropping their new video for their single ‘Hardwired’ earlier today, Metallica has now released the full information and track listing for their new album. The album was produced by Greg Fidelman, (Slayer) who engineered 2009’s Death Magnetic album.\n\nLars Ulrich commented about the album:\n\n“Has it really been eight years? Doesn’t feel like it! Nudge, nudge, wink, wink. We’re obviously beyond psyched to share new tunes with all our friends out there. We’ve been rockin’ along in the studio with Greg on and off for the last 18 months firing up the creative engines again. Putting new music out there, getting in your faces once again and all that comes with it is what we love to do more than anything else, so strap yourselves in … INCOMING!”\n\n‘Hardwired’ was played for the first time earlier today during a live remote broadcast from Metallica’s HQ in the Bay Area. During an interview with Minneapolis rock station 93X discussing the band’s performance at U.S. Bank Stadium on August 20th, Lars Ulrich stunned 93X’s Pablo by premiering the track. ‘Hardwired’ will be delivered as an instant download to fans who pre-order the album.\n\nMetallica also premiered the official video for “Hardwired” today.\n\nMetallica will perform this Saturday, August 20th, at U.S. Bank Stadium – the new home of the Minnesota Vikings.

The bands hasn’t released a new studio album since 2009’s Death Magnetic.\n\n“We’re now coming towards the end of the musical creative process and we’re starting to look ahead and the process of how we’re gonna share this record with the universe.”\n\nLars talked about the timeline of finally finishing and releasing the new album, the band’s 10th studio release:\n\n“The month of June is basically when we’re gonna sit down and figure what we’re gonna do with it all; what we’re gonna call it and what’s gonna be on it.”\n\nPreviously frontman James Hetfiled promised fans a new album by late 2016 or early 2017. This spring guitarist Kirk Hammett stated Metallica had tapped producer Greg Fidelman(Death Magnetic) for the new album.\n\nLars also discussed Fidelman: “Greg Fidelman is 24/7 on this record and has been since last summer. He’s doing an insanely great job and has been putting his heart and soul in it pretty much every waking moment of his life in helping us engineer and produce this record”.\n\nRegarding an actual release date:\n\n“If the record doesn’t come out this year then it won’t be because it’s not done. It will be because there’s some sort of cosmic reason that it would be smarter to hold onto it until next year. But the record will be done this summer.”\n\nMetallica online\n\nMetallica on Twitter\n\nMetallica on Facebook\n\nMetallica on Instagram\n\nMetallica on YouTube\n\n[amazon asin=B00LYHXIE8&template=iframe image1]\n\nIn an interview with Alternative Press, Metallica lead guitarist Kirk Hammett revealed that Greg Fidelman is the de facto producer of the bands new album, which is said to be currently in the final phases of recording. Recently performing their first show of 2016 at CBS Radio’s The Night Before concert event at Super Bowl 50, both James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich claimed on stage that there would be a new Metallica album released during 2016.\n\nKirk commented on Fidelman’s level of involvement:\n\n“We have not brought in any [other] producer and it looks extremely [unlikely] we’d bring one in this late into the project.”\n\n“The title ‘producer’ itself is a bit ambiguous. It differs from person to person. You can call Rick Rubin a producer, but he’s not the [same] type of producer as Bob Rock, who is there for every note. At the same time, Rick Rubin gets stuff done. Greg Fidelman is a different type of producer in that he’s with the engineer always looking to try and move the project forward. And that’s different from, say, Dr. Dre, who is the type of producer who is actually making backing tracks, producing music, writing music. In the hip-hop world, Dre is a producer. It’s so ambiguous. If you go by the traditional term, we’re doing it with Greg, pretty much.”\n\n“Greg is a real pleasure to work with. Even though he can be a bit of a taskmaster, he listens to you. He’s super-flexible. He knows how to crack the whip without fucking pissing people off.”\n\nHammett also commented on the difficulties of making an album for Metallica at this point in their career:\n\n“The hardest part” about recording Metallica is coordinating the bandmembers’ schedules so that the production process can move forward at a comfortable pace. “Hey, for us, life has its demands,” he said. “We’re trying to make an album and go on tour, trying to be a band, but we all recognize that if someone has a family situation, that takes priority over everything. That’s another reason why [the new album] is taking so long. That’s another obstacle for Greg Fidelman He’s always joking about it, but it really takes a lot of, like, you know, tap dancing and juggling.”\n\nThe new Metallica album will be their 10th album of original music, not including live albums, compilations and covers. It will be the first new full length album from the band since 2009’s Death Magnetic. Fidelman may be seen by fans as a controversial, but safe choice for the band in the producer’s chair. Known for his work with Slipknot and Slayer, Fidelman came under fire from fans for the sound quality (clipping) associated with the Death Magnetic finished product.\n\n[amazon asin=B00LYHXIE8&template=iframe image21]"
