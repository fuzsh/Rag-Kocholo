        "text": "I want to express my gratitude to Pete Howard and UC Centre for Entrepreneurship for all the mahi with the incredible Summer Startup cohort, and a special thank you to all the mentors for their invaluable insights. The speed mentoring session experience was incredibly enriching. I am truly inspired by our cohort's diverse perspectives and expertise, particularly the emphasis on addressing problems through cultural and sustainability lenses. During the session, I had the privilege of sharing three key takeaways with our fellow cohort: 1. Love the Problem! - It's crucial to refine and focus on solving the problem rather than building a solution you love 2. Involve Your Customers - Let your customers guide you. Listen to their needs, and let them be the champions of your solution. 3. Beyond Immediate Stakeholders - Consider the broader societal and environmental impact of your problem or solution. Understand the interdependency and strive for positive contributions to the people and the planet. Thank you to each member of the cohort for your active participation, enthusiasm, and the wealth of inspiration shared. Let's harness this collective momentum, support one another, embrace the exciting journey that lies ahead, and above all, remember to have FUN along the way. #socialinnovation #startup #UCE\n\ntl;dr... offering 200 complimentary 1:1 fundraising planning or reboot sessions to any founders trying to raise from VCs. I'll review your fundraising materials, give you honest feedback, and spend an hour with you on zoom. DM me if you're interested and I'll send you my calendar booking link. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Since launching I've had 53 conversations with founders trying to raise from VCs. The pain I hear is loud & clear: fundraising processes are messy, they take time away from running your business, and it's often not clear what VCs (really) think. From these conversations I see two key inflection points for founders trying to raise: 1) the \"planning\" inflection point - a founder is planning on raising in the coming quarters and is looking to get their ducks in a row. This initial planning - such as gameplanning for investor warm intros, wireframing the deck, and creating a file structure for the dataroom - can increase the odds of a successful fundraise. 2) the \"reboot\" inflection point - a founder has talked with several VCs but is not gaining traction. Rather than continue what's not working, a reboot can allow a founder to approach new VCs from a position of strength. Often a few key tweaks - to the story, q&a, and financial strategy - can take a pitch from good to great. I don't promise to know everything, but I believe I can offer value to early-stage founders at these two inflection points. I'll draw from experience helping a half-dozen startups raise from VCs, and also having spent time on the VC side of the house. And because I'm talking with so many founders and VCs, I have a sense for which deals are getting traction in today's market and which ones aren't. As part of launching my solo business, I'm offering 200 complimentary 1:1 fundraising planning or reboot sessions to any founders trying to raise from VCs. I'll review your fundraising materials, give you honest feedback (that you often can't get from a VC), and spend an hour with you on zoom. If you're interested (or have a friend/colleague who might be), shoot me a DM and I'll send you my calendar booking link. Thank you and let me know if I can be helpful.\n\nðŸš€ Igniting Ambition, Redefining Success ðŸš€ Frank Sinatra's timeless mantra, \"The best revenge is a massive success,\" serves not just as a motivational quote but as a guiding principle. It encapsulates the essence of transformation â€” from aspiration to tangible achievement, from being underestimated to becoming undeniable. At Somras Ventures, we stand by the visionaries who not only dream of reaching the stars but also put in the work to launch themselves into the cosmos of success. Our ethos is grounded in the belief that true success is the most eloquent response to skepticism. As we embark on this week, let's reflect on the milestones that mark our journey to massive success. What concrete actions are we committing to? How are we strategically moving closer to our goals, proving not just to the world, but to ourselves, that our ambitions are valid, achievable, and within reach? This week, let's channel our energies into turning our goals into our reality, and let our successes speak volumes. Here's to a week of action, achievement, and proving the power of our dreams. #PathToSuccess #FrankSinatraInspired #SomrasVCEmpowerment #ActionIntoAchievement #morningquote #QOTD #SomrasVc #entrepreneur ðŸš€ðŸ’¥âœ¨"
