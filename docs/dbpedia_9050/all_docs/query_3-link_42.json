        "text": "This is part two of four. If you haven’t read part one yet, check it out here.\n\nIn 2023, we’re getting several great albums some several great bands and artists, but out of all the albums that are coming out this year, these are the ones you need to keep your eyes on. Here are the most anticipated albums of 2023, in no particular order.\n\nAndrew McMahon In The Wilderness\n\nAlbum: Tilt At The Wind No More (Nettwerk)\n\nRelease Date: 3/31\n\nAndrew McMahon In The Wilderness’s fourth album Tilt At The Wind No More spent years in the making. Releasing March 31 via Nettwerk Music Group (BANNERS, John Butler Trio, San Cisco,) and produced by McMahon, Tommy English (Carly Rae Jepsen, Poppy, Set It Off,) and Jeremy Hatchet (Florence + The Machine, Lizzo, Ricky Montgomery,) it will be McMahon’s first release under the Nettwerk label. His last record, 2018’s Upside Down Flowers came out on Fantasy Records (BAILEN, L.S. Dunes, Tedeschi Trucks Band). The album may be about “pure nostalgia,” as stated by McMahon when talking about the album’s debut single “Lying On The Hood Of Your Car.” He said in a statement, “I made a conscious decision when I was writing it to imagine a whole world of important figures in my life lying next to me on the hood of that imagined vehicle. In one breath it’s a song about young love and in another it’s about those nights out with friends. Nights that ended in parking lot conversations about lives you might lead one day and places you might escape to if you could. I rarely build imagined worlds when I write songs but something about this one feels very much like a memory to me.”\n\nBlink-182\n\nAlbum: TBA (Columbia)\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nReunited and it feels so good. After spending seven years absent from the band, original guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge has returned. 2023 is going to be a big year for Blink-182. A massive world tour alongside Turnstile, Rise Against, The Story So Far, and Wallows, is about to take place, they’re headlining When We Were Young with Green Day, and a new album is on the way. DeLonge promised us back in December that Blink’s ninth album is coming out “in a few months.” Specifically when is still up in the air. But a new Blink record with Tom back in the group is gonna be promising.\n\nMetallica\n\nAlbum: 72 Seasons (Blackened)\n\nRelease Date: 4/14\n\nWhen Metallica announces a new record, everyone listens. The metal band are about to unleash their eleventh album 72 Seasons in two months. Produced by Greg Fidelman (Adele, High On Fire, Sick Of It All,) 72 Seasons is a concept album dwelling about the first 18 years of someone’s life. From what we’ve got from the album so far, it’s gonna kick ass.\n\nStory Of The Year\n\nAlbum: Tear Me To Pieces (SharpTone)\n\nRelease Date: 3/10\n\nMaking their debut with new label SharpTone Records (Broadside, Miss May I, We Came As Romans,) post-hardcore vets Story Of The Year are ready to give you an album packed with “heartache, desperation, motivation, toxic relationships, pain, loss, anger — all of the essential ingredients of the classic Story Of The Year sound…”Guitarist Ryan Phillips told Blabbermouth, “I think this album will be a defining moment in our career. When our fans hear it, they’ll be, like, ‘Oh, shit, these dudes are ready to go!’ This is the sound of a band putting everything into it. If a new band came out with this album, I’d be texting everyone in my band about it.”\n\nNow More Than Ever\n\nAlbum: Creatrix (Creatrix/Thirty Tigers)\n\nRelease Date: 3/17\n\nLet’s get this out of the way before people panic. No, The All-American Rejects aren’t dead just because frontman Tyson Ritter is focusing on this new project: Now More Than Ever. In the 2023 edition of Prenatt’s Picks I’ll go into more detail about Now More Than Ever, but just know this for now; Now More Than Ever just wanna make you dance your ass off. That’s the goal of their upcoming debut record Creatrix. Consisting of nine tracks, Broadway World puts it best. “Now More Than Ever shimmers with a spirit of freedom, its nine tracks gracefully surfing the peaks of the past four decades of pop and rock. These are the kinds of songs that used to be on the radio and certainly still should be today – the ones that make you dance, shake your ass and forget about everything else for a while.”\n\nThe Bouncing Souls\n\nAlbum: Ten Stories High (Pure Noise)\n\nRelease Date: 3/24\n\nThe last time The Bouncing Souls dropped an album was seven years ago, back when the legendary NJ punks were on Rise Records (Flogging Molly, Polyphia, You Me At Six.) Now on Pure Noise Records (Galactic Empire, Samiam, Year Of The Knife,) TBS’s 11th record Ten Stories High is as classic of a Bouncing Souls album as you can get. Produced by Will Yip (Balance And Composure, La Dispute, Quicksand,) TBS wanted to craft an album inspired by their fans’ very own stories. They used Patreon and Zoom calls to chat with their fans, using their conversations to shape Ten Stories High. “The technical side of doing the songwriting was pretty strict,” vocalist Greg Attonito said on the subject. “We’d do these 30-to-40-minute Zoom calls with the person and just try to get to know them. They were all massive Souls fans, but they were all so different. We’d just try to have a conversation and I would take notes…something would usually pop out and I could see it as something to focus on in a song, whether it was more literally or even just a kernel that would spin off into something totally different.”\n\nMy Chemical Romance\n\nAlbum: TBA (Reprise)\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nNothing has been stated on whether or not a new MCR album in on the way, but no way they aren’t making a new album. The beloved rock band reunited back in 2019 and shocked the world with their first new song in over a decade last year called “The Foundations Of Decay.” All we can do is wait, and pray.\n\nAugust Burns Red\n\nAlbum: Death Below (SharpTone)\n\nRelease Date: 3/24\n\n“It’s no secret that the past few years have been extremely dark and challenging,” guitarist JB Brubaker told Blabbermouth when discussing August Burns Red’s upcoming tenth album. “Death Below is here as a result of that time in each our lives and the emotions that came with it. We were motivated by uncertainty, fear, outrage, and triumph. I feel this is the darkest, most personal album we’ve ever written, and I couldn’t be more proud of what the five of us made together.” The album is the first ABR record to feature numerous guests, starring Jesse Leach of Killswitch Engage, J.T. Casey of ERRA, and Spencer Chamberlain of Underoath.\n\nSee You Next Tuesday\n\nAlbum: Distractions (Good Fight)\n\nRelease Date: 2/17\n\n15 years ago, Midwestern death core/mathcore troupe See You Next Tuesday released their second album Intervals. That album ended with the sounds of a ticking clock, which originally was put there to push the record’s length past the 30-minute mark, as well as to have it lead into their third album. But that never happened as CUNT went on an indefinite hiatus in 2009. As of 2023, we can officially state that the clock has stopped ticking. Coming February 17 is CUNT’s long-awaited third album Distractions, being released by their new label Good Fight Music (’68, Boys Night Out, Eighteen Visions.) Will it be worth the wait? You’ll have to wait until the 17th to find out.\n\nJohn-Allison Weiss\n\nAlbum: The Long Way (Get Better)\n\nRelease Date: 2/17\n\nSinger-songwriter John-Allison Weiss was doing pretty well for themselves a decade ago. They were on SideOneDummy Records (Big D And The Kids Table, CLIFFDIVER, Plasma Canvas,) played the Vans Warped Tour in 2013 alongside Citizen, William Beckett of The Academy Is…, and Kevin Seconds of 7 Seconds, and was living in LA. But things changed in 2018 for the Georgian musician when SideOneDummy folded. Then they came out as non-binary and began exploring themselves, going through a “second puberty.” Weiss told Alternative Press, “Living in this scene and staying authentic is a battle, and over the last decade, a lot of my needs got clouded by this industry. You get caught up in it, and it colors the standards you hold yourself to. That’s when I made some of my favorite art. I wanted to work out how to get back to that shameless teenage feeling with the brain of an adult.” All these changes helped shape their long-awaited fourth album The Long Way, their first album since 2015’s New Love. It’s also their first album with new label Get Better Records (Alice Bag, Full On Mone’t, Noods.) With all these changes in Weiss’s life, The Long Way is going to be a very interesting follow-up.\n\nPart three will come out next week!\n\nIt’s here, the final one of 2020. After lack of motivation and Animal Crossing caused numerous delays, I can wrap up this series properly.\n\nHere at Punk Goes Prenatt, for the past 10 weeks, I gave you 100 artists that you needed to tune your attention to throughout 2020. This list featured numerous acts from numerous genres.\n\nThis is part ten of ten. If you didn’t read the previous list, click here.\n\nDoja Cat\n\nHometown: Los Angeles, CA\n\nOut Now: Hot Pink (Kemosabe/RCA)\n\nFor Fans Of: Cardi B, Nicki Minaj, Santigold\n\nMeet the new Nicki Minaj. Doja Cat, real name Amalaratna Zandile Dlamini, first rose to popularity with her joke song “Mooo!” went viral in 2018. In the span of two years, she dropped her debut Amala in 2018 and her latest record Hot Pink back in November. The record is a major change in her style, trading in her dancehall vibes for pop and funk. She even appeared on the Birds Of Prey soundtrack with the killer track “Boss Bitch.” Oh, and to give her some scene cred, “Bottom Bitch” samples Blink-182’s “What’s My Age Again?”, so that’s something. She’s collaborated with acts like Tyga, Gucci Mane, and even Nicki Minaj herself on the remix of her big hit “Say So.” Her Hot Pink tour was postponed due to COVID-19 and hopefully it’ll start later this year.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Say So”\n\nOff Road Minivan\n\nHometown: Red Hook, NY\n\nOut Now: Swan Dive (Tooth & Nail)\n\nFor Fans Of: Dashboard Confessional, Jimmy Eat World, Thrice\n\nWhen he’s not busy kicking ass in the metalcore band Fit For A King, bassist Ryan Tuck O’Leary is throwing it old school with his other project Off Road Minivan. The alt rock quintet bounce between 90’s grunge and heartfelt emo vibes. Think Dashboard Confessional meets Thrice; that’s a good description of their sound. ORM formed in 2018 and have released one EP and one full-length album called Swan Dive which dropped earlier this month on Tooth & Nail Records (Alexander Fairchild, Hearts Like Lions, Mae.) The band have done shows with Chase Huglin, Blis., and Davey Muise & The Sons Of Zero. So if you’re a fan of FFAK, why not check out the glorious tunes of ORM.\n\nSong to Listen to: “YOU”\n\nNOT A TOY\n\nHometown: Denver, CO\n\nOut Now: J Cash – Single (Fearless)\n\nFor Fans Of: AJR, grandson, twenty one pilots\n\nThe Denver-based collective NOT A TOY are quite mysterious. Formed from the ashes of the rock band Shatterproof, NOT A TOY are here to wow you with their charm. They don’t consider themselves a band, but as a collective of four creatives. They don’t just make music, they make their clothes, their videos, and even their artwork. Simply put, NOT A TOY are one of the most fascinating groups to appear in the scene in a very long time. You might’ve heard of them when they were announced as the newest act to join Fearless Records (Chunk! No, Captain Chunk!, The Pretty Reckless, Underoath) during their Fearless At Home livestream earlier this month. As their label puts it, “If Kanye West and Pharrell joined forces to produce a rock group co-fronted by Jesse Rutherford and Lana Del Rey, it might sound something like Not a Toy.” NOT A TOY are not to be toyed with.\n\nSong to Listen to: “J Cash”\n\nBlack Pumas\n\nHometown: Austin, TX\n\nOut Now: Black Pumas (ATO)\n\nFor Fans Of: Durand Jones & The Indications, Leon Bridges, St. Paul & The Broken Bones\n\nTears For Fears. The Black Keys. City Morgue. What do all of those bands have in common? They’re all duos, and so is this band: Black Pumas. The soulful R&B duo have only been around for three years and have already done so much. One of those accomplishments was being nominated for Best New Artist at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards back in January. While they didn’t win, one of them does have one under his belt. Guitarist/producer Adrian Quesada won a Grammy with his previous band Grupo Fantasma in 2010 for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album. In 2019, the duo signed with Dave Matthews’s record label ATO Records (The Bronx, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Primus.) So far, they’ve done shows with Norah Jones, Toadies, and Anderson East. With COVID-19 hitting the country, the duo are using their spare time to help out various venues and record shops in their city with some fundraisers.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Colors”\n\nAlex Lahey\n\nHometown: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n\nOut Now: Sucker For Punishment – Single (Nicky Boy/Dead Oceans)\n\nFor Fans Of: A.W., Courtney Barnett, Paramore\n\nIf Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance loves your stuff, that means you’re doing something right. He got chills when he heard her rendition of their classic hit “Welcome To The Black Parade” for Triple J’s recurring Like A Version series. That’s one of the many growing highlights in the musical career of 27-year-old singer-songwriter Alex Lahey. Influenced by The Killers and Dolly Parton, Lahey’s career skyrocketed with the success of the 2017 track “Every Day’s The Weekend,” which went gold in her native Australia. She’s even making some small waves in the pop-punk community when she appeared on a previous Prenatt’s Picks band Stand Atlantic’s reimagined song “Skinny Dipping.” She’s done shows with Liam Gallagher, The National, and Cyndi Lauper, and if COVID-19 lets up later this year, she’ll be touring with City And Colour in October. But for real, check out her MCR cover, it’s amazing.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Don’t Be So Hard On Yourself”\n\nDRAIN\n\nHometown: Santa Cruz, CA\n\nOut Now: California Cursed (Revelation)\n\nFor Fans Of: Absence Of Mine, No Option, Vamachara\n\n“[DRAIN] could prove to be one of hardcore’s biggest names in the immediate future.” That’s what British music magazine Discovered said about the Cali hardcore punks when reviewing their new album California Cursed. Formed in 2014 and barely consisting of any original members (drummer Tim Flegal is the last one,) the quartet have hit several incredible milestones. For example, they achieved international press, did a photo shoot with Santa Cruz skateboards, and signed with the legendary hardcore label Revelation Records, the label behind Sick Of It All, Gorilla Biscuits, and Texas Is The Reason. They’ve done shows with Slapshot, Vein, Cruel Hand, Power Trip, and Gulch. Simply put, DRAIN is your friend.\n\nSong to Listen to: “California Cursed”\n\nVaines\n\nHometown: Los Angeles, CA\n\nOut Now: Summer’s Over – Single (Hopeless)\n\nFor Fans Of: gnash, Lauv, Troye Sivan\n\nMeet the most overlooked artist on Hopeless Records (The Dangerous Summer, Lil Xtra, ROAM.) Jared Gaines, the man behind Vaines, had a horrible childhood and developed an over-the-top personality to cope, thus allowing his creativity to blossom into songwriting. That’s where Vaines was born. And while his music sounds poppy, he isn’t attached to labels. “I used to make metal music, then I made rock songs, then I made pop songs, and now I make whatever I want,” he told All Access Music. “I rapped as a kid so now if I feel like it, I’ll rap on a song. I’ve grown into the artist I’ve wanted to be for years and I fully expect my sound to continue to evolve as the years go by. If you hear too much of the same thing from me, I’ve failed myself as an artist and you should burn me at the stake.” He signed with Hopeless last year. Definitely check out Vaines when you can.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Summer’s Over”\n\nBob Vylan\n\nHometown: London, UK\n\nOut Now: We Live Here – Single (Venn)\n\nFor Fans Of: Bad Brains, Ho99o9, Scarlxrd\n\nMeet Bobby and Bobb13, the incredible minds behind London’s heavy-hitting hardcore-rock-rap-grime act Bob Vylan (yes they’re named after Bob Dylan.) NME described them with, “Melding the attack of grime with the bite of punk, Bob Vylan couldn’t be further from their folksy namesake; instead, they take on gentrifying yuppies, gap-yah enthusiasts and amateur film photographers with paralysing lyrical venom.” They’ve done shows with Slaves (UK) and Gallows, and if COVID-19 wasn’t fucking up everyones’ plans, they were scheduled to play 2000trees this July with The World Is A Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid To Die, Creeper, and Lizzy Farrall. Bob Vylan might be playing next year for the makeup dates.\n\nSong to Listen to: “We Live Here”\n\nDealer\n\nHometown: Springbrook, Queensland, Australia\n\nOut Now: Saint – EP (Stay Sick)\n\nFor Fans Of: Bury Your Dead, Misery Signals, Vein\n\nWhat happens when you combine the former and current members of Alpha Wolf, Capture The Crown, Northlane, Iconoclast and Codeine King? You get one of Australia’s greatest supergroup. Vocalist Aidan Holmes (ex-Alpha Wolf) and his merry group of men go hard every single time, and they’re not giving you a second to catch your breath. To be quite blunt, their shit hits hard. Dealer have played with Varials and Spite, and they just had to cut their US tour with Spite and UnityTX short due to…you know. New dates will be unveiled soon. Because one thing’s for sure: nothing fucks with Dealer.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Tourniquet”\n\nAsh Bricky\n\nHometown: San Joaquin, CA\n\nOut Now: Rats, Mice, And More… (Self-Released)\n\nFor Fans Of: Jeff Rosenstock, Laura Stevenson, Neutral Milk Hotel\n\nSometimes you find an artist you like in the most peculiar way. I discovered singer-songwriter Ash Bricky from YouTuber Movieunleashers, well known for his Starters series, who animated his video for “Chowchilla Song.” Sounding like a crust punk version of Car Seat Headrest and Neutral Milk Hotel, Bricky might be young, but his songs sound like they were crafted from the soul of an old punk. He mixes in several genres with his style, adding in ambient, folk punk, indie, avant-garde, and emo. Give him some time before you see him at The Fest, he’ll fit in just fine.\n\nSong to Listen to: “Chowchilla Song”\n\nWell that’s it, 100 bands across the span of (nearly) 10 weeks. I hope you enjoyed this list as much as I did making it. If you want to read last year’s list, featuring Capstan, Year Of The Knife, Beach Bunny, shortly, and Spanish Love Songs, click the links provided underneath each band. Hope to see you all soon!"
