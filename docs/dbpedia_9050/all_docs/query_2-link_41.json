        "text": "There’s no question that absence made Metallica fans’ hearts grown fonder.\n\n‘‘Hardwired ... to Self-Destruct,’’ the veteran group’s first new album in eight years, shot straight to the top of the Billboard 200 after its November release, making it the group’s seventh straight No. 1 debut.\n\nMetallica — which has sold more than 60 million albums in the United States — also had four other albums among the top-10-selling hard-rock and heavy-metal albums of 2016.\n\nThe members of Metallica appreciate that they’re loved, and were missed, and it's something guitarist Kirk Hammett said the band doesn't take for granted.\n\n‘‘We’re certainly aware of things like anticipation and the fans’ desire for Metallica material,’’ the 54-year-old Hammett said by telephone from his home in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Metallica is based.\n\n‘‘Just because we’re one of the biggest bands in the world doesn’t mean that we’re going to sell biggest-band-in-the-world record numbers. At the end of the day, you just have to live with your participation and knowing you’ve done the best you possibly could.\"\n\n‘‘Hardwired ... to Self-Destruct’’ introduced a new collaborator in co-producer Greg Fidelman. Its 12 songs are spread over a pair of CDs, even though the nearly-78-minute running length could have fit on a single CD.\n\n‘‘We’ve been around long enough that we definitely have experience with album sides,’’ Hammett said, ‘‘and we wanted to give that experience to people who maybe weren’t familiar with it.\"\n\nMost of the album’s songs are long — six minutes or more — and feature dramatic, suitelike arrangements and intricate dynamics.\n\nHammett, however, is particularly proud of the title track, which opens the album with a three-minute blast of thrashy energy that would have fit as well on Metallica’s debut album, ‘‘Kill ‘Em All’’ (1982), as it does on ‘‘Hardwired ... to Self-Destruct.’’\n\n‘‘What gets me is that it got picked up on something like 200 radio stations the first week we put it out in the U.S.,’’ Hammett said. ‘‘That just totally blew me away. The instrumentation on the guitar parts and the riff are very similar to ‘Whiplash’ from (‘Kill ‘Em All’). We actually released `Whiplash’ as a single in 1983, and I think it got played on maybe one-and-a-half radio stations back then.\n\n‘‘And then you flash forward 33, 35-odd years later, and it gets picked up by over 200 radio stations,’’ he said. ‘‘And then I think to myself, ‘My, how times have changed, and thank God they have changed.’\"\n\nWhat hasn’t changed is Metallica’s ‘‘crazy relationship’’ with the Grammy Awards. This is, after all, the group that famously lost the first Grammy to be awarded for hard rock/heavy metal to Jethro Tull. This year, the song ‘‘Hardwired’’ is nominated, but as best rock song rather than as best metal performance. The awards show will take place Feb. 12.\n\n‘‘When the Grammys do something like this,’’ Hammett said with a laugh, ‘‘we kind of like throw our arms in the air: ‘Whatever. Whatever!’ But it’s still an honor. It’s still great to be recognized by the academy, and it’s still fun to play the Grammys when we’re asked. I think it’s cool. I think it’s funny we’re in a different category, but we take it all in stride.’’\n\nMetallica is ready to spend more time on the road. The group expects to be supporting ‘‘Hardwired ... to Self-Destruct’’ well into 2018 around the world. The group is among the headliners at the Rock on the Range event May 19-21 at Mapfre Stadium.\n\nAt the end of the tour, however, Hammett hopes that Metallica will head back into the studio in short order.\n\n‘‘What I would like to see in the future is, after we finish the touring cycle for this album, we should take a little bit of time off and just think about getting right back into the studio and creating some more music,’’ the guitarist said.\n\n‘‘I don’t think anyone, including the band, wants to wait another eight years again, or even six years or five years. It’s too long.\""
