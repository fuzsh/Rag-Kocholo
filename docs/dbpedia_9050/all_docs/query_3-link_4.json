        "text": "https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/listen-to-new-scorpions-single-peacemaker/\n\nSCORPIONS have released their new single, \"Peacemaker\". The track is taken from the band's 19th studio album, \"Rock Believer\", which will be issued on February 25, 2022 (postponed from the previously announced February 11). The accompanying music video will follow tomorrow.\n\nSinger Klaus Meine commented: \"The first thing that came to my mind was the hook line 'Peacemaker, peacemaker / Bury the undertaker.' I was just playing around with those words. At a time when so many people have died and are still dying of COVID, from devastating wars and other senseless crimes, it makes you feel that the undertaker must be working overtime. In a peaceful world after the pandemic, it will be time for the peacemaker to rule... that's an image that really appeals to me.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, the band retreated to the studio in their German hometown in Hanover and started working on new songs.\n\n\"The album was written and recorded in the SCORPIONS DNA with core [Rudolf] Schenker/Meine compositions,\" said Klaus. \"We recorded the album as a band live in one room, like we did in the '80s.\"\n\n\"Rock Believer\" was recorded primarily at Peppermint Park Studios in Hannover, Germany and was mixed at the legendary Hansa Studios in Berlin, Germany with engineer Michael Ilbert, who has earned multiple Grammy nominations for his mix work with producer Max Martin on albums by Taylor Swift and Katy Perry.\n\nSCORPIONS' new album will mark their first release since 2017's \"Born To Touch Your Feelings - Best Of Rock Ballads\", which was an anthology of new and classic material.\n\nSCORPIONS originally intended to record the new album in Los Angeles with producer Greg Fidelman, whose previous credits include SLIPKNOT and METALLICA. However, because of the pandemic, some of the initial work was done with Greg remotely, after which SCORPIONS opted to helm the recordings themselves with the help of their engineer Hans-Martin Buff.\n\nMeine previously told Talking Metal that the goal with using Fidelman to produce \"Rock Believer\" was to bring \"the old vibe from albums like 'Blackout', 'Love At First Sting' or even 'Lovedrive'. We try to focus on those albums and this attitude,\" he said. \"If we get there, who knows â€” it's so many years later. But it's the spirit and it's the whole vibe around this album. This time, the focus is on the harder songs.\"\n\nAccording to Meine, SCORPIONS' new LP features \"no outside writers at all,\" unlike 2015's \"Return To Forever\", which was largely co-written by the album's producers, Mikael Nord Andersson and Martin Hansen.\n\nSCORPIONS will kick off their \"Rock Believer\" world tour in March 2022 in Las Vegas where the band will play nine shows as part of their residency at Planet Hollywood Hotel. Afterwards they will cross the Atlantic to Europe where they will play six concerts in France and six shows In Germany supported by Wolfgang Van Halen's new band MAMMOTH WVH."
