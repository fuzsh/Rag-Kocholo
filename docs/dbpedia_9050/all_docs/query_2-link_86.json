        "text": "Metal legends Metallica have just announced their new studio album, 72 Seasons, and have debuted the old school sounding new song, \"Lux Aeterna.\"\n\nThe 12-track, 77-minute album, produced by Greg Fidelman, James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, is set to arrive on April 14, 2023, and serves as the successor to 2016's Hardwired... To Self-Destruct.\n\n“72 seasons. The first 18 years of our lives that form our true or false selves. The concept that we were told ‘who we are’ by our parents. A possible pigeonholing around what kind of personality we are. I think the most interesting part of this is the continued study of those core beliefs and how it affects our perception of the world today. Much of our adult experience is reenactment or reaction to these childhood experiences. Prisoners of childhood or breaking free of those bondages we carry,\" comments Hetfield.\n\nPre-order the album here.\n\nWatch the music video for \"Lux Aeterna\" further down the page, where you will also find the 72 Seasons album artwork and 2023 and 2024 tour dates.\n\nMetallica, \"Lux Aeterna\" Lyrics\n\nAnticipation\n\nIn domination\n\nA sea of hearts beat as one, unified\n\nMagnification\n\nAll generations\n\nApproaching thunder awaiting the light\n\nFull speed or nothing\n\nFull speed or nothing\n\nLux Æterna\n\nLux Æterna\n\nExhilaration\n\nFrenzied sensation\n\nKindred alliance connected inside\n\nCommiseration\n\nSonic salvation\n\nCast out the demons that strangle your life\n\nFull speed or nothing\n\nFull speed or nothing\n\nLux Æterna\n\nLux Æterna\n\nLux Æterna\n\nEmancipation\n\nKill isolation\n\nNever alone for the feelings alike\n\nAmplification\n\nLightning the nation\n\nNever alive more\n\nThan right here tonight\n\nFull speed or nothing\n\nFull speed or nothing\n\nLux Æterna\n\nLux Æterna\n\nLight it\n\nMetallica, \"Lux Aeterna\" Music Video\n\nMetallica, 72 Seasons Album Art\n\nMetallica 2023 / 2024 Tour Dates"
