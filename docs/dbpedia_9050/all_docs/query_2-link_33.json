        "text": "Metallica has shared the music video for the title track of its upcoming 12th studio album, “72 Seasons.” The video, directed by Tim Saccenti, can be seen below.\n\n“72 Seasons,” Metallica’s first new album since 2016’s “Hardwired … to Self-Destruct,” will be released on April 14, 2023. Produced by Greg Fidelman, along with guitarist/vocalist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, “72 Seasons” is available for pre-order now on CD, 2LP 140g black vinyl, two different colored vinyl variations and digitally in the Met Store. The album features 12 songs totaling over 77 minutes.\n\nThe title track follows previously released singles “Lux Æterna,” “Screaming Suicide” and “If Darkness Had a Son.”\n\nMetallica and Trafalgar Releasing will hold a worldwide “72 Seasons” listening party on Thursday, April 13. Hear the new album the day before its release, on the big screen with pummeling surround sound in this event exclusively in cinemas for one night only. The event will feature exclusive interviews with Metallica, with the full band delving into the origins and stories behind the songs and accompanying music videos for every track on the album. The band also has promised a few surprises. Get tickets here.\n\nDiscussing the album title, Hetfield said: “72 seasons. The first 18 years of our lives that form our true or false selves. The concept that we were told ‘who we are’ by our parents. A possible pigeonholing around what kind of personality we are. I think the most interesting part of this is the continued study of those core beliefs and how it affects our perception of the world today. Much of our adult experience is reenactment or reaction to these childhood experiences. Prisoners of childhood or breaking free of those bondages we carry.”\n\n“72 Seasons” track listing:\n\n72 Seasons\n\nShadows Follow\n\nScreaming Suicide\n\nSleepwalk My Life Away\n\nYou Must Burn!\n\nLux Æterna\n\nCrown of Barbed Wire\n\nChasing Light\n\nIf Darkness Had a Son\n\nToo Far Gone?\n\nRoom of Mirrors\n\nInamorata\n\nMetallica also has announced the “M72 Tour.” Starting in April 2023, the band will visit 22 cities around the world and playg two nights in each city, with each “No Repeat Weekend” show a unique experience: two totally different set lists with two different bands opening the show each night. Purchase a two-day ticket, and you won’t see the same song twice for a total of over 30 songs Most of the shows will be on Fridays and Sundays, and there will be extracurricular events for you to hang with fellow Metallica fans at before the shows kick off and on the Saturday night in between.\n\nPresented worldwide by Liquid Death and Blackened American Whiskey (in North America only), and brought to you Live Nation, the M72 tour also launches a completely different look for Metallica in stadiums: The band will be in the round in the middle of the field. On top of that, the Snake Pit has been relocated to the center of the stage so that fans there will have a complete 360-degree view of the show. Each weekend offers a variety of Enhanced Experiences, ranging from access to a meet-and-greet, production and stage tour, food and beverage in the “Black Box” lounge to early entry into the venue and the aforementioned Snake Pit. The popular “Black Laminate” is back, now known as the “I Disappear Ticket,” and is the ultimate pass for the fan who wants to run away with Metallica for multiple weekends. Grab one of these and attend every show on your continent or in the world. For more information about Enhanced Experiences and I Disappear Tickets, visit wearesuper.co/metallica.\n\nIn keeping with the theme of two completely unique shows each weekend, Metallica share the stage with different bands each night. Signing up for the entire adventure are Five Finger Death Punch, Ice Nine Kills and MammothWVH, and some shows will feature Pantera, Architects, Greta Van Fleet or Volbeat.\n\nTwo-day discounted tickets will be on sale Friday, Dec. 2, for all shows. Fan Club presales start on Wednesday, Nov. 30, with various other presales beginning later that day and throughout the week. To request your Fan Club presale code, visit metallica.com/presale-code. If you cannot join us for the entire weekend, single-day tickets will be available starting Jan. 20, 2023.\n\nA portion of proceeds from every ticket sold will go to the band’s All Within My Hands foundation. Founded in 2017, AWMH’s efforts to assist and enrich the lives of members of the communities who have supported the band have raised nearly $13 million, providing $5.9 million in grants to career and technical education programs in the U.S., over $2.5 million to combat food insecurity, and more than $3.2 million to disaster relief efforts worldwide.\n\nM72 Tour:\n\nShow 1 Support Europe: Architects & Mammoth WVH**\n\nShow 2 Support Europe: Five Finger Death Punch & Ice Nine Kills\n\n* Five Finger Death Punch & Ice Nine Kills play Show 1 in Paris, Architects & Mammoth WVH play Show 2 in Paris\n\n** Volbeat replaces Architects on Show 1 in Gothenburg"
