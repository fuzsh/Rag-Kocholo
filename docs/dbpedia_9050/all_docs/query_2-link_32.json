In December 2013, Metallica made history when they performed a rare concert in Antarctica, becoming the first act to ever play all seven continents all within a year, and earning themselves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. Hardwired, the first track to be released from the forthcoming album was played for the first time during a live remote broadcast from Metallicas HQ in the Bay Area. During an interview with Minneapolis rock station 93X discussing the bands performance at U.S. Bank Stadium on August 20th, Lars Ulrich stunned 93Xs Pablo by unleashing the incendiary song for the first time, much to the surprise (and delight) of the station, as well as fans around the world.\n\nHardwired represents the next phase of Metallica's journey. Produced by Greg Fidelman, along with James and Lars, this is the group's 11th studio album\n\nTracks:\n\nSide A:\n\nHardwired\n\nAtlas, Rise!\n\nNow That We're Dead\n\nSide B:\n\nMoth Into Flame\n\nDream No More\n\nHalo On Fire\n\nSide C:\n\nConfusion\n\nManUnkind\n\nHere Comes Revenge\n\nSide D:\n\nAm I Savage?\n\nMurder One\n\nSpit Out The Bone"
