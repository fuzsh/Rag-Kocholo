Background[]

Following extensive touring behind Death Is This Communion, High on Fire would begin work on a fifth studio album, initially beginning work on the album in December 2008 and originally slated for a 2009 release.[2] Notably the band would sign with Koch Records as announced on 13 December 2008.[3] On 30 January 2009 Koch would re-brand as E1 Music.[4] Recording on the new album would officially begin in September[5] and would be finished by December.[6] The album's first single, "Frost Hammer", would premiere via Stereogum on 13 January 2010.[7] The title track would be premiered right before the album's release.[8]

Snakes For The Divine would be a loose concept inspired by the story of Adam and Eve. In an interview, frontman Matt Pike stated: "The title 'Snakes for the Divine' is based on the premise that Adam and Eve weren't the first people on Earth, and Adam having a wife that was a Reptilian named Lilith. They were the first two people to take the reptilian DNA, and make shape-shifting human beings that go between the fourth-dimensional, the Anunnaki, and human beings. Eventually, from ancient Mesopotamia, this spawned a thing called the Illuminati - the enlightened ones - coming up through the centuries, and choosing the kings, controlling your media, controlling your banking, blah blah blah. It's just theory at most points. I thought it'd make a great metal song, so I just went ahead and started writing about that. That's how the record came about, as far as the theme.".[9] In an interview with Decibel Magazine in 2010, the band would state that the song "Ghost Neck" was a reference to drummer Des Kensel and having surgery where part of his neck and spine would be replaced with a cadaver's bone.

Snakes For The Divine would be released was released on 23 February 2010 through E1 Music, a special Best Buy edition containing a b-side and two live tracks as bonuses. The album would debut at #62 on the Billboard 200 in it's first week, selling roughly 8,600 copies.[10] Snakes For The Divine would attain praise from several publications, notably Blabbermouth (8/10),[11] Pitchfork (8/10)[12] and No Rip Cord (8/10).[13] Snakes For The Divine would place #17 on Decibel Magazine's Top 40 Albums of 2010[14] and #9 on Exclaim's Top Metal Albums of 2010.[15]
