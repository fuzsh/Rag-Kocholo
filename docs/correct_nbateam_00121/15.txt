The Houston Rockets have reportedly sent center Samuel Dalembert and the No. 14 pick in Thursday's NBA Draft to the Milwaukee Bucks for the No. 12 pick, according to a tweet from Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports.

The Rockets will also receive guard Shaun Livingston and forwards Jon Leuer and Jon Brockman from the Bucks.

Dalembert, who had a player-option worth $6.7 million for next season, averaged 7.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in 65 games for the Rockets last season.

The Rockets are rumored to be one of the many teams in the running for Dwight Howard. Dalembert's departure could be further proof that the team is planning to go after Orlando's franchise center.
