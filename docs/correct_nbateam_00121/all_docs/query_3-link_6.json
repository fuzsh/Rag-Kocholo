        "text": "Rocky Widner/Getty Images\n\nVeteran center Samuel Dalembert has signed a one-year deal with the Dallas Mavericks, per Tim MacMahon of ESPN.com.\n\nOn July 13, ESPN's Marc Stein reported Dalembert was drawing interest from the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nSince being left at the altar by DeAndre Jordan, the Mavericks had been trying to figure out what to do at center.\n\nMavs owner Mark Cuban acquired Zaza Pachulia from Milwaukee in exchange for a future second-round pick. Dalembert can be used as a backup option in Dallas, or even used in a platoon-style situation with Pachulia.\n\nThe Mavericks know Dalembert well, as he played 80 games with the team in 2013-14 and averaged 6.6 points and 6.8 rebounds before being traded to New York last summer."
