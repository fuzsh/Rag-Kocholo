        "text": "Harry How/Getty Images\n\nAccording to Yahoo's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Milwaukee Bucks have pulled the trigger on a deal that brings them Samuel Dalembert and the 14th pick in this year's draft from Houston for Jon Brockman, Jon Leuer, Shaun Livingston and the 12th pick overall.\n\nOn face value, this accomplishes two things.\n\nFor Milwaukee, it helps them gain another inside presence.\n\nThey obviously weren't sold that Ekpe Udoh alone could man the middle, so they brought in Dalembert to help shore up the loss created by last year's trade of Andrew Bogut.\n\nDalembert has never been anything but a semi-competent scorer, and that isn't soon to change.\n\nWhat he does is rebound and block shots, and maybe he will contribute a garbage bucket here or there.\n\nThis helps quite a bit when you look at the Bucks backcourt and realize that Brandon Jennings and Monta Ellis will be allowing quite a bit of penetration, so Milwaukee needs someone to at least challenge those drives.\n\nDalembert accomplishes this.\n\nFor Houston, it sweetens the pot.\n\nMost people believe that the Rockets are going to try to package their picks for a big man, most likely Dwight Howard, and bring back the post presence they have been missing since Yao Ming called it a career.\n\nEven if they can't get Howard, they surely will take a run at someone else, with Pau Gasol or one of the Utah bigs as options.\n\nThe rest of the players involved are consolations at best.\n\nLeuer is a promising young big man but only managed five points per game as a rookie. Brockman is undersized, but he loves to mix it upâ€”think Ed Nealy. And Livingston continues to inch his way back in the game after a horrific leg injury a few years ago.\n\nNone of these players offer any significant value, and only Brockman has a guaranteed contract for next year; the other two have team options that Houston will probably decline.\n\nThis really just comes down to Houston dumping salary and moving up.\n\nThe interesting thing about this deal is that it signals that Houston is just getting started on the trade front.\n\nIt is not likely that a package of the 12th, 16th and 18th picks and a few veteran players would be enough to pry Howard away from Orlando.\n\nTherefore, it seems pretty obvious that this is a chess-game type of move.\n\nThe Rockets made this move in order to make another one. Trust me, folks: The Houston Rockets are just getting started.\n\nFor Milwaukee, this is actually a pretty good move.\n\nThe only caveat is that they might miss out on a talented big like Meyers Leonard, Tyler Zeller or maybe even John Henson if he slips.\n\nThose guys could be there at 12 but likely won't be around at 14."
