        "text": "Samuel Dalembert remembered when he arrived at St. Patrick High School in Elizabeth 14 years ago with rumors surrounding about the school’s impending closure. But the school, a basketball powerhouse that has churned out NBA players over the course of its deep history, persevered despite its financial struggles.\n\nThat no longer will be the case as it was announced in late February that the school is set to close at the end of this school year.\n\n\"Things were working, but now I heard about this and I'm surprised,\" the Houston Rockets center said before his team faced the Nets tonight. \"I'm very surprised. I've talked to (fellow St. Patrick graduate) Al (Harrington) and we're trying to figure out what exactly the problem is to see if it can be solved. We need to figure out what's going on first to see there's something we can do to help. That's something where it's way beyond our capacity.\n\n“To me, I don’t understand the business standpoint behind it. I think they didn’t have enough kids so somebody’s not doing their job to make sure the school has enough kids coming in. It’s very sad to hear that.”\n\nDalembert went on to play at Seton Hall, which also calls the Prudential Center home, and advanced to the Sweet 16 as a freshman in 2000.\n\nThe Pirates are currently on the bubble for the NCAA Tournament, having lost to Louisville in the second round of the Big East Tournament. They will be on the pins and needles Sunday as they await their fate.\n\nHe may be biased, but Dalembert believes Seton Hall deserves their first NCAA invitation since 2006.\n\n“They should definitely be in,” he said. “Why not?”\n\n• Financial constraints force closure of St. Patrick High School in Elizabeth\n\n• Nets lose, 112-106, to Houston Rockets without Deron Williams\n\n• Nets stories and columns\n\n• Nets photos\n\n• Nets videos\n\nThe program’s swift turnaround under Kevin Willard has left Dalembert impressed after a few seasons of doubt.\n\n“I used to talk to my friends back at Seton Hall about the program and asked what was going on,” Dalembert said. “When they fired Coach (Louis) Orr (in 2006), we were kind of skeptical of what was going on, and now there’s a little life back and there’s some excitement.”\n\nTerrence Williams' brief tenure as a Net ended last season when he was traded to the Houston Rockets as part of a three-team swap that brought Sasha Vujacic and two first-round picks to New Jersey. As a Net, he showed flashes of potential but wasn't consistent. Before last night's contest against the Nets, Williams said returning to Newark wasn't a big deal for him because he didn't spend much time as a Net, but he did have one fond memory.\n\n“One thing that I will say about New Jersey that I loved is towards the end of my rookie year, I got to play basketball and I think everybody that was a New Jersey fan or a basketball fan was able to see that I know how to play basketball with time on the court,” Williams said.\n\nDeron Williams' injured calf will be re-evaluated Monday. He's listed as day-to-day."
