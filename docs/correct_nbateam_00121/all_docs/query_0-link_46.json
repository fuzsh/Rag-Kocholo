        "text": "Hey everyone, it has been a little while since I blogged about what’s on my mind, but this story I just had to share.\n\nLast night I had the great honor of having dinner with Chandler Parsons and some close friends. All this was made possible by Reliant Energy, the Houston Rockets, and IMG Worldwide, so a BIG time thanks goes out to them.\n\nAs you all know, I am a huge Rockets fan. I follow all the games, I live tweet (@htown747) the games on a nightly basis, and at the end of the day I just want to see the team succeed and win a championship. I was given the opportunity to be a Rockets ambassador via Reliant Energy earlier this season. It has been a wonderful experience, and the “exclamation point” happened last night over dinner.\n\nWe had the opportunity to eat at “Brenner’s on the Bayou” which many of you Houstonians are familiar with. After talking Rockets basketball, and enjoying some snacks; the Rockets starting small-forward Chandler Parsons walked through the door! Parsons has become a huge fan favorite here in Houston, and his story is truly fascinating. A second-round pick by the Rockets back in 2011; Parsons has proven to be wise beyond his years!\n\nParsons walked in and immediately shook our hands, thanked us for being such loyal supporters and fans. It didn’t take long to realize that this guy loves what hes doing, loves where he is in his life, and is a down to earth 25 year old living a dream. He sat down, ordered some food, and the rest of the night felt like catching up with an old friend, even though it was the first time we met Parsons in a formal setting.\n\nChandler didn’t hold back on any questions, and was open and honest when he answered. The main thing he emphasized was the chemistry between his teammates. He really made it clear that this team was special, and nothing felt forced. The team goes out after games and hangs out, nobody does it as an obligation, they do it because they genuinely enjoy each others company. Clearly that is translating on the court right in front of our eyes, as the Rockets have won 48 games this season, and have a bright future ahead. Parsons said this team really reminds him of a college team, the bond and unity is that strong.\n\nOf course the question that everyone wants to ask is if Chandler will be here next year. We all know he’s a free-agent and the offers will be flowing in. The question was asked, and Chandler raised his eyebrows a bit. No worries the answer was pleasing. He said he really wants to come back. He has a great relationship with coach McHale, and he likes his situation here. When it comes to free agency it’s a waiting game. Any player will weigh his options before making a commitment. Parsons will test the market, but hopefully that test ends soon and he remains a Houston Rocket.\n\nChandler also talked about some of his most hated teams and players. I won’t go into major detail on that, but trust me, it’s cool to see him think the same way we do. The one team he can’t stand is the Oklahoma City Thunder, and well neither can we! He said they beat us in the playoffs, they’ve beaten us all year…. it’s self-explanatory why he can’t stand that team. He also mentioned the Westbrook and Beverley match-up certainly fuels that fire even more.\n\nParsons shared a bit about his personal life with us as well. How his parents are awesome, and they support him all season. They attend many of his games, and he even said sometimes his dad is a bigger star than he is. He shared a story about when the Rockets went to Taiwan and how the whole team was back on the bus, and when they looked outside his dad was being swarmed by thousands of fans! Those were the types of stories that really made the night special and unique.\n\nChandler also talked about the night he got drafted. He was so happy that at one point he turned to his mom and said “where am I going?” It could have been any destination at that point, but the shock and excitement took over.\n\nOne thing you quickly learn when sitting with Chandler is he’s a regular guy. He had us laughing all night, and really interacted with each of us in a respectable way.\n\nI want to once again thank Chandler Parsons for his time, Reliant Energy, the Houston Rockets, and IMG Worldwide for coordinating such a special event for us.\n\nAs Denzel Washington puts it: (on making movies)\n\n“It’s simple: You get a part. You play a part. You play it well. You do your work and you go home. And what is wonderful about movies is that once they’re done, they belong to the people. Once you make it, it’s what they see. That’s where my head is at.”\n\nActing in front of a camera takes talent. It takes confidence, maturity, and imagination.\n\nKasey James, an actor and local Houstonian sat down with me for an exclusive Q&A on what life is like in the film industry, and how motivating his experience has been thus far.\n\nQ: Are you a Houstonian born and raised?\n\nA: Actually no. I was born in Wharton, Texas and raised in Victoria. Victoria is about two hours south of here, but being so close in proximity to Houston I grew up a Houston sports fan. My family and I would come shopping here, and it really feels like I am a native Houstonian.\n\nQ: What did you want to be growing up?\n\nA: Believe it or not man I was really big into sports when I was younger. I was just kind of a class clown, I never really wanted to do entertainment until I got into college. I did some theatre in elementary, but it was the little things that most people do at that age. When I got to high school it was strictly sports, I even got offered some scholarships to play football and baseball, but I passed those up to do entertainment. I thought it was really fascinating, I wanted to be a story teller and entertain people. I went to college, majored in Media Production at the University of Houston, and here I am making movies!\n\nQ: How was your experience at U of H? I am a U of H graduate as well, are you excited about how the university is growing?\n\nA: I’m extremely happy about U of H and the program. It’s exciting seeing us get on the map, especially with our football program when coach Sumlin was here, and Case Keenum…. I guess that even started before with coach Briles and Kevin Kolb. We’re going to the Big East I am happy about that, a new football stadium as well, it’s just a bunch of great things, it’s going to be huge for the community of Houston.\n\nQ: After your first movie related job how did you feel? Were you comfortable with the process, did you feel like this could be a good career path for you?\n\nA: Actually believe it or not my first movie experience I had planned to be just an extra on set, and as I was sitting and waiting I was getting nervous, so many people and so many lights all around, I was like man I am so nervous! The director was walking around cursing a lot, which was extremely intimidating, but next thing I know he walks up to me, pulls me to the side, pulls out a script and is like “can you do these two lines?” and I was like yeah sure. So my first experience on a set I got bumped up to a speaking role, so I expected every experience to be like that…..and of course it wasn’t like that! It’s a lot of hard work, you have to keep grinding, that’s what I am doing and hopefully one day I will be at the top.\n\nQ: Who are some of the actors that have inspired you? Any that you watch and study in particular?\n\nA: I gotta go with Denzel Washington, he’s amazing. Some people say he “Denzel-ifies” his role but he’s such a strong and powerful actor so he can do that. I really tend to study method actors, for example Christian Bale’s role in “The Fighter,” was just amazing. He lost all that weight; I like actors who do that because it helps you get into the character. I saw an interview with Sally Field once and she said that every character she’s ever played she’s taken a piece of that character with her. Robert DeNiro in “Taxi” was great, when he really became a taxi driver and drove people around… that’s what it’s about.\n\nQ: Speaking of method actors, my next question revolves around a method director. You have an upcoming role in the highly anticipated “Django Unchained” directed by Quentin Tarantino. Tell us what it was like working with him.\n\nA: Quentin Tarantino is a character, he’s definitely the most out there director that I have ever worked with in my life. When he’s directing he can spend literally all day setting up one scene, and then while were shooting it “CUT CUT CUT!” he changes it. It’s so brilliant how he puts things together, he’s just a genius. You can just see the wheels turning in his head when he’s directing, and I am so blessed to work with Tarantino. My role in “Django Unchained” is a slave mule wrangler. They flew in the same horse trainers who were the trainers on “True Grit.” I worked with a mule for two and a half weeks, so if you ever need a mule trainer I swear I can do that. I had to use an old school plow, it was nuts getting into the slave character. We were filming on a plantation where our ancestors actually got beaten, you could see the authenticity. It was something I will never forget for the rest of my life, I think the film will be really successful when it comes out Christmas day.\n\nQ: What are some movies that we can look forward to that you’re starring in?\n\nA: After I got “Django Unchained” I have been getting a lot of calls, I am high in demand (no I’m just kidding) but my next film is called “Cold Justice” a true story about a guy who gets locked up for a crime he didn’t commit. I play his best friend, and I am a musical prodigy in the film, we will start filming next year. Another movie I am working on is “The Prodigal.” That’s going to have some legit A-list talent, they haven’t announced those yet but the names I have heard blew my mind. We start filming that in January, look out for that one!\n\nQ: What would be a dream role you would want to play in a movie?\n\nA: I always wanted to portray Jimi Hendrix in a movie. I want to do a true story of an icon, and study them. If not that then a role like Christian Bale had in “The Fighter” where I would have to lose a significant amount of weight and really get into character.\n\nQ: How long have you followed the Houston Rockets? I am a huge fan as well, who is your favorite all time Rocket?\n\nA: Just like you, I am a huge Rockets fan. My dad is a huge fan as well; ever since I was little I remember sporting the mustard and ketchup jerseys. Social media helps me keep up with them; I even gave in and got the CSN-Houston channel so I can keep up with the team. My favorite all time Rockets player is the “Dream.” My dad is a huge Hakeem Olajuwon fan. I remember when I was little we had a code to get into stuff, and it was always Olajuwon’s number 34. Right now my favorite player is Kobe Bryant, his mentality to win is something I respect. I’m also huge on the Texans, they are 10-1, and I hope they can bring some hardware back to Houston, that would be huge for our community and the Houston film community.\n\nQ: What do you think about the landscape for film in Houston? Is it a viable city to film in?\n\nA: I really do think Houston is a great spot to shoot films. They have so many big venues, a couple years ago they were talking about making the “Astrodome” into a movie studio, but that idea is gone. It’s a huge city; Houston is a friendly place to shoot scenes. We have a beautiful campus at U of H, we have parks, I think one day it will happen. Houston is close to my family, and it’s my home.\n\nQ: What advice do you have for anyone interested in entering the film industry?\n\nA: I think the number one thing is you have to have tough skin. A lot of people are going to criticize you, always remember keep your eye on the prize. This industry is really tough, you have to be confident. Having a coach or mentor can help your career a lot. You just gotta keep fighting, and keep clawing.\n\nKasey James continues to fight and claw his way to the top. You can follow his film career on his IMDB page Kasey James and follow him on Twitter @iamKCtheGreat\n\n“4-0 that’s the way it goes.”\n\nThe Houston Rockets have now officially completed an early April road trip with a 4-0 record.\n\nThe Rockets who find themselves fighting for position in the competitive Western Conference, have peaked at the right time. With only nine games remaining this season, the Rockets have put together a fantastic playoff push for Red Nation viewers.\n\nThe road trip has defined what most Rockets fans already knew; the Rockets deserve to be in the playoffs. The team continues to fight hard every single night, and have proven they can beat teams who are considered to be top tier foes.\n\nWhat Rockets fans have seen on this road trip has been undoubtedly special. The team work, the chemistry, and the heart to win, has led this Rockets team to success. The players are clearly on the same page, the coaching staff couldn’t be happier, and via tweets from @johnhollinger Daryl Morey can’t stay in his seat! (Ya I was jumping around as well Mr. Morey.)\n\nThe thing about this Rockets team is they give you something to appreciate. It’s not the superstar+role players mold. It’s a cohesive team effort, where each player accepts a certain amount of responsibility. The great thing about it is, Rockets first year head coach Kevin McHale seems to embrace the concept. While at times its been a rocky road, the chemistry on this team in undeniably impressive. It seems like players appreciate the opportunity, and return the favor in strides. It’s a unique twist, on the norm in the NBA. As much as having a superstar is essential, you have to appreciate what the Rockets are doing right now as a group.\n\nThe Rockets opened up the road trip against the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls are currently 22-6 at home, ya they are pretty good. That didn’t stop this pesky bunch from stealing a victory at the United Center. The Rockets ran into a major skid in the second quarter that saw the Bulls outscore the Rockets 29-14. The Rockets wasted no time in flipping the script in the 3rd, by having a 31-19 quarter, and eventually winning the game 99-93 in front of 21,000 Bulls fans. Luis Scola had a fantastic night, scoring 18 points, and pulling down 12 rebounds. Marcus “The Camby Man Can” pulled down 11 rebounds with the one working hand he currently has.\n\nBut of course the common theme on this road trip was Goran Dragic. Dragic who was recently honored with the well deserved Western Conference Player of the Week award, had 21 points, 5 assists, and 4 steals in that epic Bulls victory.\n\nThe next stop was in LA, against the dreaded Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers also boast an impressive 23-6 record at home. Once again this didn’t intimidate the Rockets. Just as the Bulls game played out, the Rockets were miserably outscored in the second 35-21, and flipped the script yet again in the third, outscoring the Lakers 34-22. A stellar performance once again from “Gogi” who scored 26 points, and dished out 11 assists, led the Rockets to a 112-107 win in La La Land. Another consistent I would like to point out is Marcus Camby, who once again pulled down 11 huge rebounds. The two headed monster of Camby, and Samuel Dalembert combined for 24 points, and 17 rebounds. The Rockets threw surprise rookie sensation Chandler Parsons, and Courtney Lee at Kobe Bryant all night, making his task a difficult one. The best part of the night was when the cameras panned over at the Rockets bench, as Andrew Bynum was ejected from the game. Priceless faces, and a priceless win.\n\nThe Rockets didn’t have to travel far for their next opponent. The Sacramento Kings, who on paper had no business beating the Rockets, lived up to the assumption. The Rockets hit a bumpy stretch in the third, but wasted no time getting back on track. This time Courtney Lee took matters into his own hands, and ended the game with 25 points, and 4 steals. Goran Dragic who was in a giving mood, dished out 9 assists along with 15 points. Patrick Patterson joined the fun by pulling down 10 rebounds, and scoring 10 points for a solid double double, while Chase Budinger hit three timely three pointers. Six Rockets players were in double figures, leading to an easy 104-87 win. This was also extra special for Rockets fans, as Kyle Lowry who had been out with a scary bacterial infection made his way back. Lowry played 18 minutes, and dished out a productive 7 assists. After the game he told Matt Bullard, “I have a lot left in the tank.”\n\n3-0 was nice, but the Rockets wanted to add the cherry on top. So why not finish the road trip with a win, at a place the Rockets really enjoyed winning at? The Portland Trail Blazers who are clearly rebuilding, once again had no business beating the Rockets. While they gave a valiant effort, the Rockets took care of business with a 94-89 win. Wondering who had a good game? Do you even have to ask? Goran “Gogi” Dragic ended the night with 22pts, 7 assists, and 2 steals, proving why he deserved Western Conference Player of the Week honors. Oh by the way, guess who pulled down 11 rebounds again? “The Camby Man Can,” can’t you just hear Red Nation humming that? Courtney Lee, and Chase Budinger were battling a flu bug, but they combined for 27 points, and some very timely three point baskets. As Lowry promised, he did have a lot left in the tank. In 23 minutes of play, Lowry went 5-6 from the court, scoring 13 points, along with 4 rebounds, 3 assists, and 2 steals, a very Lowry like stat line.\n\nJust to put Goran Dragic’s spectacular numbers in perspective, here’s how it all adds up. During this four game road trip, Dragic scored 84 points, had 32 assists, made 8 three pointers, and ended it all with a measly 9 turnovers. I don’t know how to put Goran Dragic’s play into words. Stellar? Fantastic? Gogiriffic? Call it what you please, but appreciate it in all its glory.\n\nAfter the game against the Blazers, Dragic told Matt Bullard, “I was working all my life to get this opportunity, I’m really happy right now, and I’m gonna fight to the end!”\n\nIt won’t be easy keeping Dragic in a Rockets uniform. He is a unrestricted free agent next year, meaning the dollar bills are headed his way. The Rockets have made it no secret they will do what it takes to retain him, but as we have seen in the past, it’s never as easy as it sounds. Until that time comes, Rockets fans have a lot to look forward too.\n\nThe Rockets have gone above and beyond during this road trip, and for that I thank them. Like many of you, I am a die hard Rockets fan, and the playoff push they have put together has been some of the best basketball I have seen in a long time. They are 7-3 in their last 10 games, and show no signs of slowing down.\n\nRed Nation you have a team that’s playing hard, and playing with pride, keep supporting these guys all the way through!\n\n(Logo Courtesy of rockets.com)\n\nThe Houston Rockets want you to vote, as they have asked all season! This time it’s for the all-decade team of the 2000’s and the nominees are….\n\nRafer Alston\n\nShane Battier\n\nAaron Brooks\n\nSteve Francis\n\nChuck Hayes\n\nTracy McGrady\n\nYao Ming\n\nCuttino Mobley\n\nDikembe Mutombo\n\nLuis Scola\n\nAll nominees are highly worthy of being on the list, and have given Rockets fans countless memories over the past few years. The Rockets have done a great job honoring players of the past this season, and if you do get a chance to visit the Toyota Center, make sure and walk the concourse. The feeling is nostalgic, and massive murals have been created, as each decade has been voted upon. A really fantastic idea by the Rockets this season as they celebrate 45 years of Rockets basketball.\n\nIt’s always a challenge to vote because every player on each list has given us a memory, and while some are more obvious than others, it’s still a challenge. After looking at the choices I am confident I have my five players picked, and I will explain why.\n\nThe first selection was simple for me. He stands tall, and is filled with international pride. Yao Ming who landed in Houston with immense pressure on his shoulders, transcended the way the Rockets were viewed across the world. Yao not only had to adapt to the way basketball was played in the United States, but also had to adapt to the culture. A colossal up-taking, that clearly was well worth the time and effort. As a city we got to know how humble, and smart Yao Ming was. It was a media blitz, and I don’t think Yao ever let that get the best of him. Yao is an eight time NBA All Star, and though injuries plagued his short NBA career, the Rockets drafted a basketball player who brought international appeal. Many are quick to forget that behind all the business advantages of having an international icon, Yao was a very skilled and talented basketball player, at a position that is virtually extinct in the NBA. After all, here in Houston we know our centers. Yao ranks second in Rockets history in career blocked shots (912), sixth in total points (9,196) and sixth in total rebounds (4,467).\n\nMy second selection; another easy choice. Tracy McGrady who played for the Rockets from 2004-2010 may have had the most unique entrance and exit this city has ever seen from an NBA player. “T Mac,” arrived to the Toyota center in lavish fashion. Trust me it was impressive, I was there! A few thousand fans showed up, and T Mac was greeted by a highlight reel on the big screen. I can honestly say the city was buzzing, and the Rockets were back on the map. You know how so many of us these days say “the Rockets are a superstar away from being contenders.” Well, Tracy McGrady defined the word superstar. As an individual talent, he was right at the top, and having him in Houston had fans eyes light up like it was Christmas. Throw in the fact that you were pairing him up with a 7’6 giant…. what could go wrong? I remember T Mac saying all the right things in that press conference. Things like “we need this place rockin like it is now, every single night!” He used words like “promise,” and “end my career here in Houston.” Things that all fans wanted to hear at the time…. boy did that change fast. Like Yao Ming, McGrady became an injury liability, and though he handled things questionably at the end of his tenure, the fact still remains that he had a fantastic career as a Rocket. T Mac averaged a stellar 30.7ppg, 6.7apg, and 7.4rpg during the 2005 NBA Playoffs. McGrady became the first player in Rockets history to reach 2,000 points, 400 rebounds and 400 assists in a season, joining Olajuwon, Malone and Hayes with the only 2,000-point seasons in franchise history. If those three names don’t open your eyes, I don’t know what will. McGrady finished his Rockets career 5th in apg (5.6), 12th in total points (6,888) and 11th in total assists (1,699). I think despite the postseason failures that McGrady is always scrutinized for, he deserves a spot on this all decade team.\n\nMy third selection comes via a time where the Rockets hit the abyss. We all remember Clutch City, and then the attempt to continue success after that, but when Steve Francis hit the scene, things weren’t pretty. The Rockets were bad, and Francis was stuck in Vancouver, where he had no interest in playing. It became a love relationship for both, as Steve landed on the scene, and brought relevance back to a team that was struggling. It took three teams and 11 players for Francis to wear a Rockets jersey, but it was well worth the complication. Francis quickly earned the moniker “Franchise” and dazzled fans with his incredible crossover, and athleticism. Though the Rockets were still struggling, Francis shared Rookie of the Year honors with Elton Brand. Francis gained even more popularity in 2000, as he participated in an epic Slam Dunk Contest, in which he put on a show. Vince Carter was obviously the winner, dunking with perfection, but Steve Francis was not far behind. Unfortunately the trend of injuries on this all decade list does not stop with Francis. Steve battled various migraine issues, and then in 2003, battled Jeff Van Gundy. Francis clearly didn’t fit Van Gundy’s style of coaching. The Rockets parted ways with him and good friend Cuttino Mobely. Francis, ranks seventh in career scoring average, second in career assists average, third in career steals average, fourth in triple-doubles (6), fifth in 3-pointers made (466) and fifth in steals (610) in Rockets franchise history. At a time when the Rockets needed a boost, Francis delivered memorable ones.\n\nMy fourth selection defines professionalism. Shane Battier, a two time all-defensive second team member, was the defensive stopper for the Rockets for so many years. Battier defined the word “leadership,” and always will for the Rockets. A real glue guy, Battier did what was necessary to keep the Rockets in games. It may have not been the most appealing thing to do, but as they say “someone’s gotta do it.” Battier took the challenge upon himself to guard the opponents best scorer on the court. A challenge that Battier broke down to a science. He always seemed like the most prepared Rocket on the court, and silly mistakes was never an option. At one point Battier even told former Rockets head coach Rick Adelman to only put him in the game when needed. In this particular instance it was against Manu Ginobili of the San Antonio Spurs. This prompted Adelman to take Battier out of the starting lineup, and only use him when Ginobili stepped on the court. That’s the kind of dedication Shane Battier possessed. I think if Shane came back to Houston as an all decade team member, he would be proud to know the future looks a bit like the past. The Rockets have themselves a good one right now, and he goes by the name of Chandler Parsons. I am willing to bet Battier has heard about him.\n\nThe final selection on this nostalgic journey, is none other than the “Chuck Wagon.” Chuck Hayes who has the most unique story out of anyone on this list, has a lot to be thankful for. The Rockets took a chance on an undrafted player, then gradually increased his minutes, and then started him at center. Oh did I mention he’s 6’6! I just had to have Chuck on my all decade team. I’ll admit it was tough between him and Luis Scola, but I am such a huge fan of Chuck Hayes’ story, and his time with the Houston Rockets. It was January 18, 2006 when the Rockets signed Hayes to a 10 day contract. Why you ask? Well take a wild guess… injuries. He quickly made an impact, and even had Rockets broadcaster Bill Worrell question whether he was related to Elvin Hayes! Chuck was a rebounding machine, and though he had lots of odds working against him, he had quite the basketball IQ. He had those intangibles on defense that you just couldn’t teach. His offensive game was atrocious, and his free throw shooting demanded a warning sign for players boxing out, but as Hayes proved, with work anything could be fixed. Hayes become a motivational force for the Rockets, and who could forget those huge charges he would take right in the heart of the paint. Who could forget Hayes dominating hall of fame players like Kevin Garnett, and Carmelo Anthony on defense. The greatest part about Chuck Hayes was his fearless attitude. He looked at superstars in the eye and sent them a message on defense. He’s a great player who I wish nothing but success for in Sacramento. Hopefully he will be back in Houston before it’s all said and done.\n\nSo that’s how my list pans out. I hope you enjoyed the path through the decade, and don’t forget to vote for your All-Decade Team of the 2000s.\n\nhttp://www.nba.com/rockets/fans/rockets_team__the_00s_2012_04_03.html\n\nThe Rockets had a fantastic win tonight over the Lakers 107-104. The Rockets are making a strong push for the playoffs, and continue to prove that playing at home means winning basketball games. The Rockets are now 17-6 at home, and if you haven’t seen them play live, you really need to get out and support this team.\n\nThe win was fantastic, and it’s always fun beating the Lakers, but what I really wanted to write about is the superstar effect. I was lucky enough to attend this game live and in the flesh. It was incredibly entertaining, and my favorite team came out the winners. But the striking focal point on tonight’s game for me was the Kobe Bryant effect.\n\nI have been to numerous Rockets games in my lifetime, and I have even been to playoff games. When you attend a playoff game, the vibe is different. It feels like home court advantage for the most part. The fans are hyped, and free red shirts are given away, giving real meaning to “Red Nation.” Even if the opponent does have a bona fide superstar, you don’t tend to feel it in a big way. Pride and excitement takes over the arena.\n\nThe circumstances tonight were vastly different. Because of the shortened season the Lakers only come to Houston ONCE. Let me tell you fans are very aware of this, and the first thing that caught my eye today, were all the Lakers jerseys in the crowd. Wait…. scratch that, all the Kobe Bryant jerseys to be more specific. One human being, at the age of 33 still captivates the basketball loving country. I knew Kobe was loved, but seeing it in person is completely different than hearing about it, or seeing it on television.\n\nI started referring to them as “Kobe’s disciples.” It’s like they were lost in another world. Every time he touched the ball, the disciples would go crazy. He would make a simple jump shot, and arms would go flying in the air.\n\nI have never seen a regular season game like I saw today. Early on it felt like a road game, and I made sure I was in the right venue. I even saw an elderly lady sitting three rows ahead of me who thought Kobe was her “son.” She said she spent some of her savings to get as close to the man as she possibly could. One guy, causing this much ruckus wherever he goes.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I may sound naive right now but the superstar effect in person is unreal. The first thing that ran through my mind was, wow…. I underrate Kobe’s career, and all the pressure that comes with it. Then I came back to reality, and started hating him again. Hey I was at a Rockets game….\n\nIt was just a surreal moment, to see how one player can change the schematics for one franchise. Sure the Lakers are historic, and they have national attention with all the stars that go and support them in LaLa land… but in Houston? At one point fans wanted Kobe back on the court so bad, chants of “Kobe, Kobe, Kobe” broke out at the Toyota Center. Keep in mind the Lakers were holding a double digit lead at the time.\n\nThe Rockets and Lakers always do battle in epic style. The Rockets have never stacked up to the talent level the Lakers have, but they play at such a high team level, that they always give the fans something to smile about. As Rockets fans, could you guys imagine how loud the Toyota Center would be on a nightly basis, if the Rockets acquired a superstar? No offense to the guys on this roster. They all work hard, play with respect, and give it all they got. But as fans that want a championship, we know this roster will most likely not get it done. You can never count out a Cinderella story, but far too many times this season we have seen the Rockets lose games down the stretch, due to the opponent having a closer.\n\nChris Paul has done it twice already, and whether you love him or hate him…. he’s a superstar. The impact of a superstar is undeniable, and now having two is no big deal.\n\nThe days of Clutch City were amazing, and it all revolved around a superstar. That superstar needed solid teammates, but when you needed a game defining play, Hakeem Olajuwon was the man.\n\nKobe Bryant shows no end in sight, and fans still gush over this guy, and his talents. It was truly an interesting vibe in Toyota Center tonight, and while I give major props to Rockets fans, Kobe nation was alive and well.\n\nThe NBA trade deadline is now in the books, and while last minute deals did emerge, the days leading up to the deadline was a slow and boring process. Every year it seems like one player holds the key to the domino effect, and this year was no different.\n\nDwight Howard went back and forth, as the Orlando Magic scrambled to figure out what the end-game to the madness would be. As one tweet put it: @Lakerholicz “Dwight Howard has confirmed he can’t deny or confirm that he didn’t confirm a report that denied he confirmed he was denying confirmation.”\n\nYa it really was that crazy. Finally around 11:30AM central time, Chris Broussard tweeted “Dwight Howard just texted me that he has signed the waiver of his Early Termination Option.” So Dwight at least guaranteed the Magic one more year, and somewhere in New Jersey, Deron Williams and Mikhail Prokhorov began to weep.\n\nFinally the Dwight saga had come to a close, and other teams could start wheeling and dealing. Obviously the one team I had my eye on was the Houston Rockets. Would Darly Morey finally make a big splash? Would he move the dazed and confused Kevin Martin? Would Pau Gasol finally be a Houston Rocket?\n\nNo splash, Kevin Martin is still here, and Pau Gasol continues to aide Kobe Bryant in Los Angeles.\n\nInstead the Rockets acquired Marcus Camby, and Derek Fisher in two separate deals. It doesn’t sound like much does it? Let it sink in first…..alright now let’s break it down.\n\nIt didn’t take much to acquire Marcus Camby. The Rockets shipped sparsely used guard Jonny Flynn, center Hasheem Thabeet, and the second-round pick acquired from Minnesota. Camby who brings much needed length to the Houston Rockets front-court, will form a nice duo with Samuel Dalembert. The acquisition of Camby will also ease the pressure on forward Luis Scola, who can now focus on scoring during this stretch run into the playoffs. At the age of 37 Camby is a veteran defensive presence, and spends his time in the Houston area during off-seasons. The Rockets essentially traded a second round pick for the veteran center, who has an expiring contract at the end of the year. Low risk, low commitment, veteran presence.\n\nThe Rockets were not done after acquiring Camby. As all of us sat and waited for the “big one,” the most unexpected acquisition of all was made. The Rockets had traded backup Jordan Hill, for another 37 year old point guard that you may be familiar with. Anyone remember that guy who threw a mean elbow at Scola during the playoffs? Yes Red Nation, the enemy we all know as Derek Fisher, is now an allie. The crust of this trade is not the acquisition of Fisher, but rather the 2012 first round pick owned by Dallas that the Rockets received. Another safe but effective move to acquire a draft pick, with no interest in long term services from the player. It is also rumored that the Rockets will buy-out Fishers contract as soon as starting guard Kyle Lowry returns from his bacterial infection woes. At 37 Fisher serves no purpose for the Rockets.\n\nSo what does this all mean? The Rockets have sent a clear message, they want that 8th seed in the Western Conference. If the playoffs were to start today, the Rockets would be facing the number one seeded Oklahoma City Thunder. Sounds scary right? Believe it or not the Rockets have dodged the Thunder two times already, winning both games. The Thunder can’t stand the Rockets, and by adding Marcus Camby into the fold, the Rockets keep the core base that has brought them success intact, while adding more size in the front-court. With Kendrick Perkins, and Serge Ibaka manning the paint, the Rockets have more leverage than before.\n\nThe premise here is that the Rockets do lock up the 8th seed, and throw everything they have at the Thunder. With this current roster, that’s really all you can ask for.\n\nThe trade-deadline simply became a risk free zone for the Rockets. They swung deals that combined the future, and the present. The Rockets are so deep into this Western Conference race, that only a large blockbuster trade would have been worth compromising the battle. Clearly that blockbuster deal did not pan out, and the Rockets are going with what they got. It’s a talented group, and while many would love to see the team start fresh, that direction has never seemed to be an option for this franchise.\n\nSo we roll with what we got Red Nation. We support the roster as it stands, and hope Kevin Martin has an epiphany. We get healthy for a battle with the Thunder in the playoffs.\n\nIt wasn’t the big deadline that we hoped for, but the Rockets made small improvements without breaking the structure, or the bank.\n\nMarissa: [after seeing Frank running naked along the streets, she slows down her car] Frank, what are you doing?\n\nFrank: [out of breath] We’re… We’re going streaking! We’re going up the quad and to the gymnasium.\n\nMarissa: Who is?\n\nFrank: Th… W… There’s more coming.\n\nMarissa: Frank, get in the car.\n\nFrank: But… everybody’s doing it.\n\nMarissa: Frank! Now!\n\nFrank: [still out of breath] Ok\n\nThe Houston Rockets have now won 7 games in a row! It’s official people, the Rockets are streaking! The Rockets have reeled wins against the Kings, Blazers, Wizards, Pistons, Hornets, Spurs, and most recently the Timber Wolves.\n\nIt’s been an interesting mix of players that have got it done for the Rockets, and various rotations have been the most fascinating part of this streak. Rockets new head coach Kevin McHale, has certainly played the role of the mad scientist, experimenting with all the different players he has. The Rockets have always been criticized as that team without the superstar. That criticism is logically fair, but they are a team with depth and talent. Coach McHale has ample options to work with, and has certainly played it by ear during this win streak.\n\nA multitude of players have stepped up for the Rockets this season. Some the obvious ones, and others not so much.\n\nLet’s start with the anchor in the paint. The man that has proven why a center is so vital to the game of basketball. Samuel Dalembert who has been averaging 9 points and 8 rebounds this season has gone above and beyond what anyone could have expected. I think it’s safe to say the Rockets would have a handful of losses without Sammy D, The Haitian Sensation, The X Factor, The BERT…. look call him what you want, just know that his defensive presence has been a huge reason why the Rockets have won close games. During the 7 game win streak Dalembert has piled up 92 points, 83 rebounds, and 18 blocks!\n\nWanna talk about steals? Chandler Parsons the second round pick, has now found himself in the starting lineup and playing extremely important minutes in the NBA. Chandler “BANG” as they now call him, has turned into an incredible spark plug for the Rockets. What separates Chandler from Budinger, is his all around ability to be effective. Offensively he knows where to be, and he gets high percentage shots, while on the defensive end he anticipates plays instead of assuming what they will be. Budinger has found his way towards the bench, but that’s alright. The Rockets have options and they are using them.\n\nKevin Martin, and Luis Scola fall in the same bracket for me. Both are vets, and no matter how much criticism these two guys get on the defensive end, they are consistent every year on the offensive end. K Mart started the season slow, but as of late he’s had the hot hand. Both players really kick start each game for the Rockets, and the rest of the bunch chimes in. Starting the game on a positive pace is extremely important, and easily under appreciated when it comes to late game situations. It’s easy to forget without the hot start, the cold streak would be even harder to sustain. Martin and Scola may not fall under that superstar category, but both hold tons of responsibility on the offensive end for the Rockets. I mean seriously, without that tango it just wouldn’t be as fun.\n\nYou gotta save the best for last right? Kyle Lowry has been nothing short of fantastic for this Rockets team. He’s played like an All Star, he’s led like an All Star, and he’s shown incredible dedication to the sport of basketball. You have to remember this league was threatened by a significant lockout, and it’s more transparent now who came ready to play; Kyle Lowry is right on top of that list. After flirting with multiple triple doubles this season, Kyle finally got the big one tonight! 16 points 10 assists and 10 rebounds on a resounding defensive effort to end the game against the T Wolves. Kyle Lowry deserves to be an All Star, so please Rockets fans show him all the support you can by voting for him.\n\nThe Rockets bench has been stellar. Though Terrence Williams, Chase Budinger, and Jonny Flynn have been ousted for the time being, guys like Courtney Lee, Patrick Patterson, Jordan Hill, and Goran Dragic have all stepped up in a timely fashion during this 7 game winning streak. Lee is looking solid after his injury woes, Patrick Patterson is slowly but surely getting his confidence back, and Goran Dragic has created match up nightmares for opponents when he and Lowry are on the court together. Jordan Hill is still a work in progress, but the potential still remains.\n\nThis bunch is streaking, and it’s been a fun ride so far. Kevin McHale’s unorthodox style of rotations have worked over the past few games. Sure at times they seem crazy, and unreliable, but what it has led to at this point is a 10-7 record. A record that competes with the Grizzlies, Spurs, and Mavericks.\n\nAt this very moment, Rockets fans have good reason to be proud of this groups competitiveness.\n\n“The foot injury will not allow me to play so many games anymore. Like I said before, I will quit the national team and the sport one day. It’s what happens to every athlete.” – Yao Ming\n\nYao Ming has finally decided to stop battling his injuries and call it quits after 9 grueling seasons of uncertainty. As a diehard Houston Rockets fan this is a very sad day for me. Yao was one of my favorite players to ever put on a Rockets jersey and he will be missed in a big way in the city of Houston.\n\nYao’s story is a fascinating one. A genuine giant walking this earth with an unbelievable skill set to play basketball. When the Rockets acquired that first pick in the 2002 NBA draft I couldn’t have been more excited. The Rockets needed a new identity and how much more unique does it get than a 7’6 center from China joining your favorite team. I was skeptical at the time no doubt, and not having seen much footage of an international player had me wondering whether or not this mammoth sized man would be coordinated enough to handle the best athletes in the world on the hardwood. I was not alone, remember Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal and others spreading words of doubt into the media world? It was like that feeling you get when you’re in high-school and your too short to make the basketball team, but some big klutz who really can’t play the sport is tall and finds an automatic spot on the roster…. ya you know that cliche story. Well it is true most of the time, height is a blessing when basketball is being played and Yao Ming had a lot of that.\n\nWhen Yao Ming arrived in Houston, the city went nuts! It was the year of the Yao and a cultural fusion of fans were far more present than in the past. It was like the clash of American and Chinese media doubling and tripling in size of what we normally are used to seeing. They say everything is bigger in Texas, and when you think about it for a man like Yao that really just fit well. The poster you see was a great biopic on the journey Yao Ming had from China to Houston, and what type of expectations were demanded of him not just from Houston, but a nation with over a billion people. Just try putting into perspective what Yao Ming must have been feeling when he was drafted, to the moment he played his first NBA game. Ya it took time to adapt, but his talent was undeniable. This was a big man that was ripe for the picking. A big man that could be cultivated into the next great center to play the game. Rockets fans know what a great center looks like, Hakeem Olajuwon transformed this franchise into champions, and the scale of Yao Mings existence showed the potential to do the same. The entire country was enthralled by Yao’s height, his story, and how he would handle himself in front of the bright lights, and aggressive media. Now that we have the luxury of sitting back and looking at all the things Yao went through I think most of us can agree that Yao served as a brilliant role model and ambassador to his home back in China, and was unanimously liked by his peers in the NBA.\n\nLike the movie Hancock I think Rockets fans were hoping they had drafted a superhero. He was a polarizing figure so that was taken care off, but could the man play? His fame grew instantly with unforgettable commercials with Apple, and Visa. A very marketable guy, that obviously stood out. The unique part about Yao was that he was genuinely a humble person, with a fantastic sense of humor. When Yao first came to Houston he could hardly speak English, a challenge to say the least. He quickly adapted to the culture, learned the language, and was in front of the mic cracking jokes like it was just another day at the office. This guy could absorb so much information, and yet stay humble enough to work on whatever was asked from him. Some would say that sense of being humble may have significantly shortened his career along with devastating injuries. The only drawback of drafting Yao Ming was that he still had to be committed to his Chinese national team. It doesn’t take rocket science to know that a guy of Yao Ming’s size should not be running 90 feet back and forth year round, but that is what he attempted to do. Maybe with some superpowers it would have been possible, but it was an unrealistic goal.\n\nThe Tracy McGrady Yao Ming saga looked good on paper, but probably is one of the most unforgettable moments for many Rockets fans. Though Yao’s retirement is a somber one, many fans are happy to see this injury plagued duo dismantled, and how can you blame them? At a time when Rockets fans expected a resurrection to occur, the Rockets fell into an abyss of injuries that never displayed what could have been a dynamic duo in this league. It’s a sad pairing for such significant superstars, but at the same time one that could not have been passed up by this franchise. Ever since that pairing split up the Rockets have had a tough time finding an identity. One thing’s for sure the most distraught person over this retirement is owner Leslie Alexander who certainly capitalized on the global market revenue that Yao Ming brought with him. The jackpot winners of Yao Ming mania were the Houston Rockets. Yao’s teammates were able to sign deals from Chinese shoe companies, something that would have never happened without the “Yao effect” and the Rockets were able to sell massive amounts of merchandise to there international fans via the Yao Ming connection. Les Alexander made it no secret that if Yao could play again he was willing to sign him to a new contract, and why not it’s a smart business move.\n\nThe hype surrounding Yao Ming was real and in my opinion he delivered. Yao could not control the injuries he sustained, and yes looking back on things now I am sure he and the Rockets would have made better decisions on how to control Yao Ming’s minutes, but at the end of the day Yao connected an international bridge for the NBA. A bona fide star, that was the perfect poster boy for international success. Yao’s way of representation was always classy, dignified, and respectful. Being that he controlled such a large platform, the way he handled it all cound not have gone better for the NBA and China. Through all the success and frustration Yao Ming remained humble and studious.\n\nAs a die hard Houston Rockets fan I wish Yao Ming nothing but the best in life. I hope he stays connected with the NBA as an ambassador who is able to help his homeland and his new home continue to grow through the sport, as he has been doing for the last nine years. Yao defines what a role model in sports should be, and is a perfect example for young stars entering the highly scrutinized world of sports.\n\nI will leave you with this Rockets fans:"
