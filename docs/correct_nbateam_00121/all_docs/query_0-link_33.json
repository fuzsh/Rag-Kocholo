        "text": "The Houston Rockets continue wheeling and dealing in the rup-up to the 2012 NBA Draft:\n\nDalembert, who signed with Houston as a free agent last year, averaged 7.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks last year. An athletic 6'11 250 center, he gives Milwaukee the defensive anchor they have needed since they dealt Andrew Bogut at the deadline last season.\n\nBrockman, Leuer and Livingston are all usable NBA players who could contribute off the bench, but their inclusion is mostly due to the NBA's trade rules, which require matching salaries for teams who aren't under the salary cap.\n\nRight now, it's unclear why the Rockets moved up only two spots. One possibility is they have been targeting Washington SG Terrence Ross, who has been linked with the Phoenix Suns at No. 13.\n\nRoss is one of the most underrated players in this draft and, at 6'6 200, he has the potential to be an All-Star caliber SG and the type of foundational piece Houston GM Darryl Morey has been searching for since Yao Ming's retirement."
