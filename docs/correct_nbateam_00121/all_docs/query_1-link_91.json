        "text": "It's no secret, the Rockets need a big man in the middle. Sure they signed Samuel Dalembert and traded for Marcus Camby (free-agent), but they're both on the wrong side of 30; the Rockets need younger legs. Even though Camby and Dalembert played well at times on defense, they haven't had a post man who could score and defend at his position since Yao Ming. They've tried defensive minded players like Chuck Hayes, they've tried better offensive players like Patrick Patterson, but have struggled to find a young center who could do both. With that in mind, I'd like to see the Rockets target center Tyler Zeller from North Carolina with their first round pick.\n\nZeller is a legit 7-footer with a good wing-span, and is a pretty good athlete. On the offensive end he runs the floor well, has range out to 18 feet, and has a go-to move in the post with a short right-handed baby hook. On the defensive end, he's a good shot blocker, but will need to bulk up and put on weight to keep from being pushed around at the NBA level. As a senior at North Carolina, Zeller averaged 16.3 points, 9.6 rebounds, 1.5 blocks, while shooting 55% from the field, and 80% from the free throw line. Some critics would say that Zeller has hit his ceiling, but I disagree. Zeller's points, rebounds, blocks, assists, and steals per game went up all 4 years at North Carolina, along with his field goal percentage improving every season."
