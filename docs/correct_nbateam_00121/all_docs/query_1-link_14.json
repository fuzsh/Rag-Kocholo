        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nHOUSTON â€” A person with knowledge of the deal says free-agent centre Samuel Dalembert has agreed to terms with the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because no announcement has been made.\n\nESPN.com first reported that Dalembert had reached terms with Houston, a two-year deal worth US$13.7 million that included a team option for the second year.\n\nThe six-foot-11 Dalembert, a Canadian citizen, averaged 8.1 points and 8.2 rebounds for Sacramento last season. He played his first eight seasons in Philadelphia after the 76ers made him a first-round pick in 2001.\n\nThe Rockets were desperate to land a big man after NBA commissioner David Stern killed a three-team deal that would have brought Pau Gasol to town."
