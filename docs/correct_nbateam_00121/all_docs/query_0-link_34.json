(Bill Baptist/NBA/Getty Images)\n\nThe Houston Rockets are again trying to make some noise leading up to the draft. According to Hoopsworld.com, the Rockets are looking to trade center Samuel Dalembert. The Rockets are currently selecting 14th and 16th in the first round of the June 28 draft.\n\nDalembert will be paid $6.7 million for next year, but has a $1.5 million buyout if exercised by July 8. If that happens, he will automatically become a free agent.\n\nDalembert said the Rockets haven't told him what they intend to do. “They have so much to figure out this summer for themselves. I’m just going out there and making sure I get myself ready whether they keep me or not. I just have to stay ready,\" he said.\n\n[tweet https://twitter.com/AlexKennedyNBA/status/215868924863057920]"
