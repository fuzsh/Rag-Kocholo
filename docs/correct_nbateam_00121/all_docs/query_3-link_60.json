        "text": "By of the\n\nSt. Francis - Samuel Dalembert was at such a low point he didn't know how to react.\n\nIn his basketball life, it was an unexpected drop into the depths of despair.\n\nBut the 31-year-old veteran tried not to show it while still being a positive example for his younger Milwaukee Bucks teammates.\n\nHe wasn't playing and felt he had no meaningful role with the Bucks, who acquired him in a June trade with Houston.\n\nBut slowly he has begun to gain playing time under interim coach Jim Boylan.\n\nAnd Tuesday night in Denver, a strange set of forces collided. He scored 21 points in 9-plus minutes in the first half and finished with 35 points, his career high and the most by a bench player in the NBA this season.\n\nHe made 17 field goals, tying LeBron James for the most in the league this season.\n\nHe notched 35 points and 12 rebounds in just 27 minutes, the first NBA player to do that, according to Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nAnd he shot 81% by hitting 17 of 21 shots, the highest percentage in the league this season by any player attempting at least 20 shots.\n\nWhat a sudden transformation it was for the 6-foot-11 Haitian center. And his teammates loved it.\n\n\"I feel like everything is a matrix, slow-motion,\" Dalembert said of his sensational night at the Pepsi Center. \"You can see the action happen before it happens; you can see where the ball is falling before it happens.\n\n\"It was effortless for me, to tell the truth. It was a beauty. I was just striving. My teammates kept cheering on the bench and I didn't understand it.\"\n\nHis teammates were happy because they knew he had been on the sideline for so long.\n\n\"He's a warrior, man,\" said center Larry Sanders. \"He's seen a lot of things. To survive this long in the NBA you've got to play through some tough situations.\n\n\"Being a veteran, not taking any frustration out on us. It feels good to have teammates like that.\"\n\nDalembert admitted it wasn't easy to go from starting center at the beginning of the season to not playing in 20 games due to coach's decision. Ekpe Udoh and rookie John Henson moved ahead of Dalembert in the rotation under former Bucks coach Scott Skiles.\n\n\"It's been a down side in my career, the lowest in my career,\" Dalembert said. \"It takes a lot of dedication, a lot of focus to not be angry. You're upset, but you step back up and say, 'It's a new day. Let's get to practice. Let's be professional. Let's go, let's support.'\n\n\"A lot of guys in my situation can relate to that. It's not easy. When you're in it, in any business, you go crazy. But I feel like it was a blessing where you learn to mature.\n\n\"Everything in life is a test. . . . I wait, I wait and my opportunity shows up. I will continue to be a professional and continue to support a good team of guys.\"\n\nThe unfortunate part of Dalembert's big night? The Bucks squandered a 17-point lead to lose to the Nuggets in the final minutes. And they lost again at Utah.\n\nNow the Bucks have three home games remaining before the all-star break, beginning with Saturday night's game against Detroit. Then Washington visits on Monday and Philadelphia on Wednesday.\n\nDalembert said the Bucks must shore up their defensive rebounding, cut down turnovers and return to the good ball movement that has been critical to their success.\n\n\"If we can make the transition from what we do in practice to the basketball court, people will start becoming believers again,\" Dalembert said. \"Until then we are our worst enemy.\n\n\"We don't want to go to the break and worry. In the second half of the season teams are coming with vengeance. There's pressure on everybody, coaches, players and organizations. They've got to win.\"\n\nInjury update: Sanders took part in non-contact drills but was held out of contact work in Friday's practice at the Cousins Center. Forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute also did some work in practice.\n\nBoth players missed the 100-86 loss to Utah in Salt Lake City on Wednesday. Sanders is nursing a bruised lower back suffered in a nasty fall in Denver on Tuesday, and Mbah a Moute tweaked his right knee in the same game.\n\nIt's possible both could play against Detroit. They are listed as day-to-day and a decision on both will be made Saturday.\n\n\"It went good,\" Sanders said after practice. \"I moved around a little bit and got some of the stiffness out. It's still sore.\n\n\"I'll just play it by ear. I'll know more about it in the morning (Saturday). See how I'm feeling. See how I'm moving.\"\n\nSanders received good news Wednesday when a bone scan revealed no serious damage to his back. He went down hard while trying to block a dunk attempt by Denver forward Kenneth Faried.\n\n\"It's just a soreness factor and how he can tolerate that,\" Boylan said. \"He was out here today trying and just didn't go through any of the contact.\n\n\"There's always hope (he can play Saturday). It's day-to-day, so we'll see. This is a big stretch for us right here, and I know Larry wants to play. When you have that will to want to be out there and be part of what's going on, suddenly you can make yourself feel a lot better.\""
