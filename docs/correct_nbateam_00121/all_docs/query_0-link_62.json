        "text": "https://twitter.com/AlexKennedyNBA/status/215868924863057920\n\nThe Houston Rockets are shopping Samuel Dalembert, according to sources. He may be packaged with one of Houston's first-round picks.\n\nPlease, Geoff Petrie, get in on that.\n\nI don't totally understand the motive here. He has has a team option, so if it was a salary dump couldn't they just decline it?\n\nI suggested Hayes and Jimmer for Dalembert and #16 in another thread. Jimmer could be their Dragic safety net. Not sure that's enough to get it done though.\n\nAnd Thornton for Dalembert + #16 doesn't seem like a good deal for us, either.\n\nThen, of course, there is always the potential for Thornton+Hayes+#5 for Dalembert, Lowry, and possibly both or one of their first rounders. Kevin Martin kind of hinders a deal for Marcus, though.\n\nMaybe Jimmer and Hayes is enough for them. If I was Petrie I would give them a call. They love Chuck over there, and if they are going to decline the option on Dalembert, it's always better than nothing.\n\nI really would like to see a move like this. Dalembert is not so expensive, and it would show us that our FO is trying to make this team better, and not just sit there and wait.\n\nYeah, we need to get in on that if its there. The question of course is price. Okay, that's one question. Second question is what happened with Dalembert last year. If his aversion was to Westphal, then we're fine. If his aversion was to Cousins or some such, we're not so fine.\n\nRegardless a chance to undue the mess we made of last summer would be huge.\n\nMaybe Jimmer and Hayes is enough for them.

Dalembert is not so expensive, and it would show us that our FO is trying to make this team better, and not just sit there and wait.\n\nCan't trade Jimmer for a guy we already had and a guy we could have resigned. If this happens, you basically turned Beno, 7th pick (I wanted Leonard), and Hayes into Salmons and Dalembert. So basically, you gave away a top 10 pick to acquire more money and less production. And this, not the CBA, is how ****ty teams stay ****ty.\n\nSay it with me: We moved down in the draft to acquire a player that has a longer contract, makes more money, can't make it out on the court even though his competition for minutes is Garcia and Donte Green, and has absolutely no trade value in the league. Sacramento, these are your kings.\n\nThe Kings arent trading Jimmer. if they were high on him enough to draft him as soon as they did last year they arent gonna give up on him just like that.\n\nMaybe, but they were high on him BEFORE Isaiah Thomas went nuts... and before he struggled quite a bit in his first year. Isaiah, and Terrence Williams, and John Salmons .. make Jimmer pretty expendable.\n\nCan't trade Jimmer for a guy we already had and a guy we could have resigned.

Its built into our psychology. But it doesn't matter at all. All that matters is where you stand today. If you traded LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh yesterday for Matt Bullard. You can't refuse to trade Bullard today for Marc Gasol on the theory that effectively trading James, Wade and Bosh for Gasol would be dumb. All that matters is that today you have Bullard, and can you improve that situation. How Bullard came about does not matter.\n\nSimilarly for us, how we ended up with Jimmer and various junk isn't important going forward. All that is important for our future is can we turn our current junk into something a little better?\n\nWithout for an instant defending what went on last summer...its the most common human afflcition of all to chase yesterday's losses.

Isaiah, and Terrence Williams, and John Salmons .. make Jimmer pretty expendable.\n\nObviously the Kings value Jimmer. Your treating him like nothing more than a throw away. I also think we ought to wait on IT. Lets see how his sophmore year goes. He's no longer a surprise to everyone, and the league is going to make life a lot more difficult for him next season. Not saying he won't succeed, just that there's a long history of players struggling in thier second year. Personally, I'm far from ready to give up on Jimmer. His debut reminds me somewhat of Beno at San Antonio, although Jimmer comes with a rep as a better outside shooter. Some of you guys just have no patience. If a player doesn't come out with guns blazing, you want to throw in the trash and move on to the next victim.\n\nBy the way, that doesn't mean I wouldn't trade Jimmer, but he has more value in my mind than just a throw in.\n\nWithout for an instant defending what went on last summer...its the most common human afflcition of all to chase yesterday's losses.

I'm not saying its the right move, but I am saying as a business that needs the approval of the public, you can't really go around doing things like this.\n\nI'm more concerned with WHY Houston is shopping him. If Dalembert is declining, we don't need him back. And if what Brickie suggested (Dalembert might have had problems with Cousins) is true, then we REALLY don't need him back. And that's not even bringing our current owner situation into the mix. By that, I mean there just might be owners out there who are not going to be making any deals that help the Maloofs. Just sayin...\n\nI'm more concerned with WHY Houston is shopping him. If Dalembert is declining, we don't need him back.

By that, I mean there just might be owners out there who are not going to be making any deals that help the Maloofs. Just sayin...\n\nDalembert's numbers were rock steady last year, just as they always have been. He was botha + +/- player and a + defensive player for them.\n\nBut he's past 30, is still going to be looking to get paid (there is a mercenary aspect to Daly, always has been), and dangled along with the #16 for instance Houston might hope to jump up in the lottry and be able to kickstart a rebuild with an iimpact guy.\n\nObviously the Kings value Jimmer.

So what is the objective for renting him? To get a couple more wins? At the expense of developing JT and the new draft pick (assuming the Kings pick a big guy)? For Dally and Sacto, it's not about the money, the guy just flat out doesn't want to be here.\n\nNow if the Kings pick a SF in this draft and is not confident that JT will be back, then I guess Dally is a reasonable stop gap.\n\nyou call starting 3 games a chance?\n\nHe started 7 games on the year and averaged 27.9 mins in those games 10.9 ppg, 2.1 assist 2.1 TO shooting .394%. The only plus side was the .500 from 3's.\n\nIn Jimmers position, being a high draft pick and the guy in front of you goes down you need to come to play. Especially from a 4 year college guy. What happened is IT did excately that when he got his shot.\n\nDo we know that? Its entirely possible, and something I would like to know the truth about, but there was an x-factor that changed early this past season.\n\nThe fact that he turned down a better offer from the Kings (a better offer from the Kings' point of view but still, I believe our FO when they say their offer is the best one on the table) or at the very least let the Kings' offer sat for a long time while eyeing Huston; says volume about Dally's preference.\n\nUnfortunately, not wanting to be in Sac is slowly becoming a trend. Hope I'm wrong on this one...."
