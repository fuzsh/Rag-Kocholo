        "text": "The Houston Rockets have traded center Samuel Dalembert and the 14th pick in Thursday's NBA draft to the Milwaukee Bucks for the 12th pick and three players, league sources told Yahoo! Sports.\n\nIn addition to the 12th pick, the Rockets will receive guard Shaun Livingston and forwards Jon Leuer and Jon Brockman. The deal allows the Rockets to move up in the draft as they continue to try to compile assets for a possible trade for Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. Houston now owns the 12th, 16th and 18th picks.\n\nThis is the second trade in as many days for the Rockets, who acquired the 18th pick from the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for forward Chase Budinger.\n\nDalembert played one season for the Rockets, averaging 7.5 points and seven rebounds in 65 games. Only $1.5 million of Dalembert's $6.7 million team option for next season is guaranteed, but the Bucks plan to keep him."
