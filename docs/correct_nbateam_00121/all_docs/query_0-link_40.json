        "text": "It remains to be seen just how much of a pay cut a top free agent would take to join the Miami Heat. But at least one admits the Heat’s salary-cap situation could make it difficult. Because they are over the salary cap, the Heat at most will be able to offer a free agent the mid-level exception of $5 million. That might not be enough to entice center Samuel Dalembert. “Yeah, that would be tough,” Dalembert said Monday in a phone interview with FOX Sports Florida about signing with the Heat for that amount. “But you never know. There are trades and things that you could do.”\n\nDalembert, who averaged 8.1 points and 8.2 rebounds last season, did say “chances are still open” he could re-sign with the Kings. He said he exchanged text messages with Sacramento coach Paul Westphal on Monday, the first day teams could resume contacting players after a five-month lockout. Dalembert said the exchange of texts was along the lines of both the coach and center being eager to get back to work.\n\nDalembert told FOX Sports Florida last week that the three teams he’s targeting are the Heat, New York and Houston. It sounds as if the Rockets, with a gaping hole at center due to the retirement of Yao Ming and plenty of money to spend in free agency, are his preference at this point. “Houston, that one is the best,” said Dalembert. He later added, “I’m interested in the Rockets. They have a good team over there, a running team.”"
