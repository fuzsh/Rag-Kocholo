        "text": "By of the\n\nJohn Hammond did not wait until draft day to land his starting center.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks general manager went into action a day early, obtaining veteran center Samuel Dalembert in a draft-related deal with the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe Bucks traded down two spots in Thursday's draft, moving from the No. 12 pick to No. 14, the last spot in the lottery.\n\nIn addition to the 12th pick, they sent guard Shaun Livingston and forwards Jon Brockman and Jon Leuer to the Rockets. Milwaukee also received a future second-round pick and cash considerations as part of the deal.\n\n\"We had an obvious need at the center position,\" Hammond said Wednesday night after the trade was completed. \"He (Dalembert) is a legitimate 7-foot player with great length. He's an above-average shot blocker and rebounder, a guy who is a 70% free throw shooter in his career.\"\n\nHammond said he thought Dalembert would move into the lineup as the starting center, allowing Drew Gooden to return to power forward.\n\nThe 6-10 Gooden played nearly exclusively at center last season after Andrew Bogut fractured his left ankle and later was traded to Golden State.\n\n\"Drew is a power forward and we had him playing out of position,\" Hammond said. \"He did an admirable job.\"\n\nThe Rockets now hold the Nos. 12, 16 and 18 picks in the first round and may be trying to gather enough assets to parlay in a trade for Orlando's Dwight Howard or another veteran star.\n\nThe Bucks traded down in the draft for a second straight year, but Hammond said this is a much different scenario, dropping two spots in what is considered a deep draft.\n\nMilwaukee might now be able to focus on grabbing a shooting guard or small forward with the 14th pick, although Hammond wasn't tipping his hand.\n\n\"There's a big difference in moving down nine spots (in 2011) and two spots,\" Hammond said. \"To move to 14, we still feel very comfortable we will get a very good player, similar to a player we would get at 12.\"\n\nThe Bucks had been projected to be looking closely at North Carolina center Tyler Zeller and Illinois center Meyers Leonard, both considered likely lottery selections.\n\nBut that need could be altered now, and it wouldn't be surprising if the team's focus turned to shooting guard prospects. Connecticut's Jeremy Lamb and Washington's Terrence Ross both were at the Cousins Center on Tuesday, although Lamb could not work out due to an ankle injury.\n\nRoss produced an impressive workout and said he would be happy to wind up with the Bucks.\n\n\"It's real deep in our position,\" Ross said after the Bucks workout. \"We can all shoot it; we can all play by the rim.\n\n\"I try to do extra things to help me stand out to the teams.\"\n\nDuke freshman guard Austin Rivers did not work out in Milwaukee, but the team did interview him at the draft combine in Chicago and scouted him extensively.\n\n\"They could all be gone (at 14),\" Hammond of Lamb, Ross and Rivers. \"I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.\n\n\"Somebody has got to fall to 14. Within our rankings in this draft, we feel it's going to be a player we like.\"\n\nThe Bucks also worked out forward candidates John Henson of North Carolina, Terrence Jones of Kentucky and Perry Jones of Baylor. Henson could go in the top 10, with Detroit a possible destination at No. 9.\n\nA year ago the Bucks were part of a major three-team deal on draft day and moved from the No. 10 spot to No. 19. They selected Tennessee forward Tobias Harris with a pick obtained from the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nThe 6-11 Dalembert averaged 7.5 points and 7.0 rebounds in his only season with the Rockets, starting 45 of 65 games.\n\nHe has averaged 8.0 points, 8.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks in 10 seasons, including the first eight with Philadelphia and one with Sacramento.\n\nThe 31-year-old from Haiti has finished in the NBA's top 10 in blocked shots eight times and was 10th last season (1.7 blocks per game).\n\n\"After moving Andrew (to Golden State), we had a gaping hole in protecting the basket and rebounding the ball effectively,\" Hammond said. \"Those are Samuel's strengths - his ability to block shots and rebound.\"\n\nForward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute is coming back from off-season knee surgery after struggling with tendinitis last season.\n\nIf the defensive stalwart can regain his form and join with Dalembert, and young power forwards Larry Sanders and Ekpe Udoh can continue to improve, the Bucks' defense could improve dramatically.\n\nNow Hammond, assistant general manager Jeff Weltman, coach Scott Skiles and the staff can focus on the all-important first-round pick.\n\n\"We want to get every draft right,\" Hammond said. \"I think we make every effort to do so.\n\n\"We've done a good job with our first-round picks and our second-round picks. The first pick we had here (Joe Alexander at No. 8 in 2008) didn't work out well for us and that was unfortunate.\n\n\"But we've been in a different situation since that day to have a different mode of preparation.\"\n\nThe Bucks also have their own choice in the second round, the 42nd overall pick.\n\n\"With the second-round pick we'll keep all of our options open,\" Hammond said. \"Could we move the pick for a future second or could we draft an international player and leave him overseas for a year or two? All those are going to be options for us.\"\n\nFIVE TO WATCH AT NO. 14\n\nThe Bucks made a deal with Houston, trading down two spots to the No. 14 overall pick in Thursday's NBA draft. Who could be waiting for them there?\n\nTerrence Ross, 6-7, 197, shooting guard, Washington\n\nRoss worked out for the Bucks on Tuesday, and assistant general manager Jeff Weltman said the Huskies sophomore possessed sound mechanics and \"has got NBA written all over him.\"\n\nJeremy Lamb, 6-5, 179, shooting guard, Connecticut\n\nDon't be fooled because Lamb missed some workouts with a sprained ankle and has a laid-back reputation. He has shooting guard size, length and athleticism. He met with Bucks officials Tuesday even though his ankle injury kept him off the court.\n\nTerrence Jones, 6-10, 252, power forward, Kentucky\n\nHe's a versatile player, a left-handed shooter who can score, rebound and defend. He's big enough to play some power forward but quick enough to play small forward.\n\nAustin Rivers, 6-5, 203, shooting guard, Duke\n\nThis appears to be a long shot that Rivers could fall to the 14th spot. Several teams in the top 10 are targeting guards. But the Bucks have sincere interest despite the fact he didn't work out in Milwaukee.\n\nTyler Zeller, 7-0, 247, center, North Carolina\n\nThe Bucks got their center Wednesday by acquiring Samuel Dalembert in the trade with Houston. It's unlikely Zeller would fall this far, but if he did it still could be tempting."
