        "text": "The quest for Jon Brockman to play on every single NBA team is alive and well. His fourth season in the NBA will be spent on his third team. Brockman was dealt to the Houston Rockets as part of the trade that sent Samuel Dalembert to the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nBrockman originally spent his first season with the Sacramento Kings after being drafted with their second round pick, and was dealt to the Bucks in July in exchange for Darnell Jackson. Brockman has averaged about two points and three rebounds per game in his first three years in the league, mostly as a utility bench player.\n\nTalk about Brockman with Washington basketball fans at UW Dawg Pound. Discuss Brockman with Rockets fans at The Dream Shake. Talk about Brockman with Bucks fans at Brew Hoop.\n\nCheck out the SB Nation NBA YouTube channel below. If you'd be interested in viewing more coverage of the league."
