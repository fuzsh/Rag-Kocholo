        "text": "According to sources with knowledge of the situation, they may have found a way to move one of those picks. Samuel Dalembert says all the right things in talking about wanting to be back in Houston, but his relationship with Rockets head coach Kevin McHale could have been better, and partially because of that, he is no longer considered to be in the Rockets’ long-term plans. The fact that he can become a free agent in July makes him an attractive trade piece, either for a team looking for a decent starting center, or for a team looking to create cap space.\n\nWith 11 years of experience under his belt, Dalembert fully understands that he may have played his last game with the Rockets. Becoming a free agent is nothing new to him. He already knows what he’ll be looking for should he get waived before July 8th. “I would love to be a part of it, but it’s a business and everybody knows it,” Dalembert said. “Someone like myself looks to win. I want to go to a team where I have the opportunity to win and also contribute to the team. Either way being a part of the NBA for so many years is a blessing. There are a lot of good teams out there looking for an athletic big man. I’m making sure to having myself ready and seeing what happens for next year.”"
