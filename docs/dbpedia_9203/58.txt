Nestled in the heart of Central Europe, Czechoslovakia emerged in 1918 from the remnants of the disintegrating Austro-Hungarian Empire, uniting the historical lands of Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia. This newfound nation flourished and became the most prosperous state in eastern Europe. Czechoslovakia was also politically stable during the interwar period.

From April 10, 1919 until March 14, 1939, Czechoslovakia’s currency was the Czechoslovak koruna. On September 29, 1938, the British and French lost control over Sudetenland, the portion of Czechoslovakia resided by ethnic German speakers, and in the following month, Germany occupied it.

The Germans took over the rest of Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939, and split the state into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and the Slovak State. This resulted in the withdrawal of the Czech banknotes. The Czechoslovak koruna became the currency again from November 1, 1945. On January 1, 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two separate nations—the Czech Republic and Slovakia. On February 8, 1993, the Czechoslovak koruna was replaced by the Czech koruna and the Slovak koruna respectively.
