        "text": "On the first floor, visitors have a unique chance to see a full history of money in the territory of Slovakia from the earliest times to the present, with a particular focus on production at the Kremnica mint. It shows not only coins but also the technology used to mint them from medieval times to the present, alongside various trial strikes and coining tools.\n\nThe exhibition begins with the diverse forms that money could take before the introduction of coins and the first coins struck in the territory of Slovakia, which were made by the Celts in the first century BCE. These are followed by Roman, Byzantine and Western-European (Carolingian) coins that have been found in our territory dating from the beginning of the current era to the 10th century. Although the Great Moravian Empire did not mint money of its own, finds of coins from closer and more distant neighbours indicate a flourishing of trade. Later the territory of Slovakia became part of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. This period is documented by the numerous mintages of small dinars, high-quality silver groschens and the world famous Kremnica florins, later known as ducats.\n\nThe earliest coins were struck manually on a block using a coining die and a hammer, and this method remained in use until the 17th century. From this date mechanical striking gradually took over. At Kremnica, a roller minting machine operated from 1661 and a screw coin press, or balancier, was introduced in 1710. Since the 19th century, the mint has used automated minting machines.\n\nThe first room concludes with a presentation of the famous Kremnica guldiners, heavy silver coins minted at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nThe next room exhibits the diverse circulation coins of the multinational Habsburg monarchy and presents the attempts made to develop a single currency. The history of paper money in the Kingdom of Hungary began in 1762. In this part of the exhibition, visitors can see the oldest banknotes of the Habsburg monarchy, monetary inflation from the time of the Napoleonic Wars, paper money issued during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848-49, banknotes of the Austro-Hungarian Bank and the first Czechoslovak banknotes. There are also souvenirs of the more recent past in the form of post-1948 banknotes and coins. Amongst the most interesting exhibits are numerous trial strikes and coins that never entered production. The establishment of the Slovak currency in 1993 is documented in detail – from stamped Czechoslovak banknotes through the artistic design of the coinage to the final form of the Slovak koruna. The exhibition ends with a reflection on the introduction of the common European currency – the euro – in 2009.\n\nWhat types of money have been used in our territory?\n\nIn the depths of prehistory – money before coins\n\nOn the threshold of written history – the Celts (4th to 1st century BCE)\n\nOn the borders of the Roman world – Romans and Germanic peoples (1st to 4th centuries)\n\nTimes of change – the migration period, Slavs, Avars and Byzantines (5th to 8th centuries)\n\nGreat Moravia – rise and fall (9th and 10th centuries)\n\nThe denar period\n\nThe groschen period\n\nThalers\n\nThe currency reforms of Leopold I\n\nThe coinage of the “malcontents”\n\nConvention currency\n\nThe rise of paper money\n\nState bankruptcy in 1811 and the foundation of the Austrian National Bank\n\nThe revolution of 1848 – 1849\n\nAustrian currency 1857 – 1892\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian krone/korona 1892 – 1918\n\nEstablishment of the Czechoslovak currency\n\nSlovak Republic 1939 – 1945\n\nSlovakia after the end of the Second World War\n\nThe currency reform of 1953\n\nCzechoslovak Socialist Republic\n\nSlovak Republic 1993 – 2008"
