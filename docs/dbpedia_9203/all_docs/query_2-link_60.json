        "text": "World Coin Search\n\nThe World Coin Price Guide is a complete catalog of values for World coins from 1600 to date. Created by NGC and Active Interest Media’s NumisMaster, the price guide pages are arranged by Krause catalog numbers and include values, images and specifications such as weight, composition, engraver and current bullion values. Found at NGCcoin.com, it is the most comprehensive online valuation guide available, and is free to all users.\n\nSearch by coin\n\nUse this search by entering the category, year, mintmark (if known) and denomination.\n\nSearch Terms\n\nThis search fills in matches as you type.

In some cases, NGC has made adjustments or edits to the prices, descriptions and specifications. NGC makes the World Coin Price Guide available to its website visitors as a free service, but in no way does the information provided represent NGC’s official opinion or policy. For example, varieties listed in the World Coin Price Guide may not necessarily be recognized by NGC. Please contact NGC Customer Service with any questions.\n\nNGC Price and Value Guides Disclaimer\n\nDisclaimer: The prices listed in the various NGC Price and Value Guides are compiled from a number of independent, third party sources in the numismatic community which NGC believes to be reliable. Prices provided are averages, not specific prices for individual coins. Further, because these prices are only updated from time to time, they do not reflect short term pricing trends, which are quite common and are often quite dramatic, given the volatile nature of the collectible coin marketplace. This is especially true for rare coins, where there are fewer sales and greater variations in sale prices. For all of these reasons, the prices in these guides are designed to serve merely as one of many measures and factors that coin buyers and sellers can use in determining coin values. These prices are not intended, and should not be relied upon, to replace the due diligence and — when appropriate — expert consultation that coin buyers and sellers should undertake when entering into a coin transaction. As such, NGC disclaims all warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information contained in the NGC Guides. By using the NGC Guides, the user agrees that neither NGC nor any of its affiliates, shareholders, officers, employees or agents shall have any liability for any loss or damage of any kind, including without limitation any loss arising from reliance on the information contained in the Guides."
