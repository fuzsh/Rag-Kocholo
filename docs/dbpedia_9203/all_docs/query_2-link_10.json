Used in Theresienstadt Ghetto (Terezin, Czechoslovakia). The Theresienstadt Ghetto notes were printed by the National Bank in Prague.The notes have a central vignette of Moses holding the tablets containing the Ten Commandments. They are dated 1 January 1943 but did not see actual circulation until May, 1943.The notes were worthless except to rent library books and the elaborately engraved style and inscriptions were copied from the Litzmannstadt (Lodz) Ghetto issues of 1940. The note appears slightly worn, creased and discoloured.\n\nHistory note\n\nThe Theresienstadt Ghetto, located near Prague, was a creation of SS General Reinhard Heydrich, appointed Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia (Czechoslovakia) in late 1941. Originally, it was designed as a \"model\" camp for holding prominent and respected Jews and to impress the international community. It was the only camp the International Red Cross was allowed to visit. A Nazi propaganda film, \"The Fuhrer Gives a City to the Jews\", was made on the subject . A Council of Elders (Judenrat) was responsible for running the Ghetto and reported to the SS. Ultimately, the Theresienstadt Ghetto was used as a transit point to the Auschwitz extermination camp. One of 61 ghetto notes found in an unlabelled bag. Three of the best condition notes of each value have been catalogued (see CUR 20913 : CUR 20933).\n\nObject Details\n\nCategory\n\nCurrency\n\nRelated period\n\nSecond World War (production), Second World War (association)\n\nProduction date\n\n1943-01-01\n\nMaterials\n\nwhole: paper\n\nCatalogue number\n\nCUR 20930\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.
