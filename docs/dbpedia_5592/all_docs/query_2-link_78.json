        "text": "Kelly Ripa is proving that her love for husband Mark Consuelos is stronger than ever. The 52-year-old talk show host is known for having one of the longest-lasting marriages in Hollywood – she and CW actor husband Mark have been married since 1996. In a recent Instagram share, the former All My Children costars enjoyed a throwback smooch under a massive Christmas tree, and fans can’t get over it. Kelly, who has called marriage a “marathon,” posted for her 3.3 million followers. Fans have left her over 28,000 likes.\n\nSmooching Under The Tree\n\nThe photo showed Kelly with closed eyes and looking blissfully happy as Mark brushed his nose into her forehead. The mom of three and her hunky husband were backed by a gorgeous and large lit-up Christmas tree – the romance vibes were level 100 as the A-Lister couple enjoyed their intimate moment.\n\nKelly was all dressed up, showing hints of a sequin black dress with a classic neckline. The Live Wire author wore her signature blonde locks tied back and away from her face. She sported a warm face of makeup complete with foundation and blush, also adding sparkly eyeshadow to honor the holiday season. Mark, meanwhile, looked dapper in a dark blazer and white shirt as he showed his affection. “#tbt 2018 Big Tree Energy,” Kelly captioned the photo.\n\nTrainer Says It’s ‘Lit’\n\nThe post has gained a like from Kelly’s daughter, Lola Grace Consuelos. Together, Kelly and Mark are parents to sons Michael and Joaquin, plus middle child Lola. Also sending love was Kelly’s trainer, Anna Kaiser. She wrote: “LIT!!!” with heart-eye and fire emoji. “Such a beautiful couple,” one fan replied.\n\nKelly and Mark met on the set of All My Children before eloping to Las Vegas, NV back in 1996. The rest is history.\n\nSays She ‘Just Knew’\n\nKelly has opened up on her feelings regarding first meeting Mark.\n\n“I saw my husband in a photograph before I saw him, and I knew,” she has stated. “I wasn’t looking to get married… but when I saw him, the photograph of him, I saw my entire future with him flash before—like I saw it. And I don’t believe in any of that, but now I do. Because of that moment.”\n\nLove Of Her ‘Life’\n\nSeparately, Kelly has referred to Mark as the one in the most tender of ways.\n\n“It all began with All My Children . And All My Children is where I met the love of my life, the man who taught me how to be a person , a real person,” the bubbly blonde has shared."
