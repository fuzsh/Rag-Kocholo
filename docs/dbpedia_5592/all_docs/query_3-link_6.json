        "text": "Could the Real Housewives of Atlanta be rebooted? That‚Äôs the question on Bravo fans‚Äô lips at the moment.\n\nThe Real Housewives franchise started back in 2006 with the premiere of The Real Housewives of Orange County. The original series‚Äîwhich starred OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson and four other Housewives‚Äîled to the creation of Housewives shows in nine other cities across the United States: New York City, Atlanta, New Jersey, D.C., Beverly Hills, Miami, Potomac, Dallas and Salt Lake City. RHODC and RHOD have since been canceled, but the rest of the Housewives universe seems to still be thriving, especially the newest Housewives city, RHOSLC, which premiered in November 2020.\n\nOn March 23, 2022, it was announced that the showrunners had made the decision to recast RHONY for the show‚Äôs 14th season from scratch, which brings us to the announcement of its new group of dynamic women on October 16, 2023. From fashion and real estate to philanthropy and social influence, these women have made their mark in NYC and will now share their lives as they juggle careers, family life and jam-packed social calendars in the city that never sleeps.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a totally different show,‚Äù Andy Cohen told The Daily Beast. ‚ÄúWe all love the original RHONY so much. I think you have to really do a trust fall and understand this is different. This is a different group of women. ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre formidable, and they‚Äôre interesting, and they‚Äôre fashionable and viable, and funny, and outspoken, and everything we love about New York.‚Äù They‚Äôre also more diverse‚Äîwith the show‚Äôs first Indian woman and the show‚Äôs first Puerto Rican woman‚Äîand younger across the board, ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen husbands in New York in a long time,‚Äù Cohen continued. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen children in New York in a long time. I think they‚Äôre in a different phase of their lives, which presents different stories.‚Äù\n\nNow, some fans are hoping the Real Housewives of Atlanta will get the same treatment. Here‚Äôs what we know about a possible RHOA reboot.\n\nWhy is RHOA being rebooted?\n\nWhy is RHOA being rebooted? We‚Äôre not 100 percent sure it is, but that‚Äôs what the fans want. LoveBScott was the first to report the news that Bravo was working on a RHOA reboot: ‚ÄúA source close to production tells us that Bravo is beyond thrilled with the reception of the recently rebooted Real Housewives of New York, so they‚Äôre fully onboard with production‚Äôs decision to recast RHOA. The network is also very pleased with the upcoming seasons of The Real Housewives of Potomac and Married to Medicine.‚Äù\n\nAccording to Page Six, the Bravo network is in talks to reboot the series for season 16, though ‚Äúnothing official has been decided,‚Äù adding that recasting speculation was due to ‚Äúfan feedback‚Äù.\n\nThroughout season 15, fans have expressed their desire for a whole new group of Housewives on social media. ‚ÄúI only watched 2 episodes of #RHOA, idk I‚Äôm not into it like I use to. It needs a re-cast. Some of the cast has the same story lines!! (sigh) never thought I would get bored of #RHOA but yeah. üëéüèæ,‚Äù one person tweeted in May. Another added, ‚ÄúBravo needs to listen to the fans before we tune out,‚Äù while another fan said: ‚ÄúRecast #rhoa Sanya [Richards-Ross] Courtney [Rhodes] gotta go.. we wanna see rich black women doing their thing not boring women with dry story lines trying to start fake beefs to get a peach.‚Äù\n\nApparently, the anonymous tipster said ‚Äúsome outreach‚Äù was happening ‚Äúlocally in Atlanta‚Äù to scout new talent for the upcoming series, while another insider said the reboot talks were ‚Äúthe worst-kept secret in town‚Äù and mentioned Bravo had been looking for new talent for the ‚Äúlast two months‚Äù.\n\nThey added that the search has been more difficult than the network was anticipating. ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt found any famous people of note that want to be on the reboot, and if they can‚Äôt find any famous people that want to be on the show, then they can‚Äôt reboot the entire show.‚Äù\n\nIt echoes what another insider told ET, ‚ÄúA major shakeup is coming to The Real Housewives of Atlanta. Before the women filmed their recent reunion, they were told that they should expect a big change with the franchise moving forward,‚Äù they said.\n\n‚ÄúThey hinted at a reboot like New York got, but it also could be moving forward with only a couple of the current stars. The cast is on edge about their future and has no idea where the network plans to go. Although their ratings are still strong, the network is listening to fans and their desire for a change.‚Äù\n\nThe latest scandal to hit RHOA is rumors that Drew Sidora and Ty Young are dating. Drew and Ralph‚Äîwho married in 2014 and share three kids: sons Machai and Josiah, and daughter Aniya‚Äîjoined The Real Housewives of Atlanta in Season 13 in 2020. From the start, their marriage issues were a main storyline, with Drew and Ralph attending couples therapy and engaging in fights over Ralph‚Äôs mysterious disappearances for days. After nine years of marriage, Drew and Ralph filed for divorce in February 2023.\n\nThe filing came when Season 15 of The Real Housewives of Atlanta had already finished filming. But as fans know, nothing is truly off-camera on Bravo, with cameras picking back up to film the aftermath of Drew‚Äôs divorce‚Äîand accusations that she cheated on Ralph with a woman named Ty Young. Read here what to know about Drew Sidora and Ty Young dating rumors on The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 15, and the real reason Drew and Ralph divorced.\n\nOur mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you‚Äôll love as much as we do.
