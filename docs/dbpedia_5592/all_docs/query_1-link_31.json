        "text": "Actress Drew Sidora has been a topic of conversation as of late as the drama between her and her ex-husband, Ralph Pittman, begins to surface on The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\nDuring the midseason trailer, Sidora is accused of cheating on Ralph with basketball player, Tamera “Ty” Young. The trailer shows the women reacting to the rumors. Fellow castmate, Marlo Hampton shared how she felt about the rumors.\n\n“I can’t get over she’s dating a woman, the way she is, ‘I’d never kiss a girl!’” Shereé Whitfield reveals the rumors that she heard about Drew. “She was cheating with a well-known basketball player… That’s what the streets are saying.”\n\nWhen asked about the rumors, Drew responded, “I don’t know what I can say and not say.” It’s been reported that the rumors about Drew and Ty began after Love and Hip-Hop Atlanta star, Mimi Faust shared on social media that an affair may have taken place.\n\nMimi, who used to be engaged to Ty, posted a photo of Ty with her arm around Drew with rapper Ice Spice’s “Munch” song playing over it. However, the post was never clarified by Mimi.\n\nWe reported that Drew and Ralph had filed for divorce just 61 minutes apart from each after being married for nine years. Pittman is currently seeking joint legal and physical custody of their two children, Machai and Aniya. He is also asking for ownership of his 2018 Cadillac and his Porsche Taycan.\n\nDrew has also alleged that Ralph was a “serial cheater” in their marriage. This case is currently ongoing."
