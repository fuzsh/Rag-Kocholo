        "text": "01 of 12\n\nJulia Stiles as Kat Stratford\n\nAfter playing the snarky, anti-mainstream, feminist lead who learns to loosen up (who could forget that iconic table dancing scene?) and let love in, Stiles went on to star in two other film adaptations of Shakespeare plays in the early aughts (2000's Hamlet and 2001's Othello-inspired O).\n\nShe made notable appearances in other films, including Save the Last Dance (2001), Mona Lisa Smile (2003), The Prince and Me (2004), Hustlers (2022), Orphan: First Kill (2022), Chosen Family (2024) and the Bourne movie franchise.\n\nIn 2011, Stiles was nominated for an Emmy for her guest role on Dexter. The actress later reprised her Save the Last Dance character during a cameo on Saturday Night Live in 2023.\n\nStiles graduated from Columbia University in 2005 with a B.A. in English literature. In 2017, she married Preston J.
