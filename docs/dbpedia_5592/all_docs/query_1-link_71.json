        "text": "Are Drew Sidora and Ty Young dating from RHOA?\n\nAre Drew Sidora and Ty Young dating from The Real Housewives of Atlanta? Drew was accused of cheating on her husband, Ralph Pittman, with WNBA player Ty Young in The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 15 finale. “She was cheating with a well-known basketball player,” he co-star, Sheree Whitfield, said as headlines flashed about Drew and Ty on screen. “That’s what the streets are saying.” Another co-star, Marlo Hampton, also expressed shock over Drew and Ty cheating rumors. “I can’t get over she’s dating a woman, the way she is, ‘I’d never kiss a girl!’” she said. When asked about the rumors in a confessional interview, Drew declined to confirm or deny her relationship with Ty. “I don’t know what I can say and not say,” she said.\n\nRumors of Drew and Ty’s relationship started in March 2023 when Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta star Mimi Faust, who was previously engaged to Ty, suggested in an Instagram post that Drew and Ty were having an affair when Mimi and Ty were still together. The post included a photo of Drew and Ty on Mimi’s Instagram story as Ice Spice’s song “Munch (Feelin’ You)” — which included lyrics about oral sex between two women — played over it. When later asked about the accusations in an interview with internet personality Anthony Lofties, Mimi said, “What’s done in the dark will come to light.”\n\nThe rumors also came after Drew’s starring role in her co-stars Kandi Burruss and Todd Tucker’s movie, The Pass, in which she has a romantic storyline and sex scene with a woman. The rumors also came after Drew was accused of kissing former cast member, LaToya Howard, on The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 13.\n\nDuring The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 15 finale, Drew’s co-star and Ralph’s cousin, Courtney Raquel-Rhodes, also claimed that Ralph told her that Drew is bisexual. “I had heard, ‘Drew’s a good time. She’s bisexual.’ And I was like, ‘Really?’ So I just asked Ralph. It was no secret. She has fun with girls too. He’s aware of it,” Courtney said in a confessional interview. When asked by a producer what she knew about Drew and her girlfriend, Courtney said, “I know that Drew visits her.” The producer then asks Courtney where Drew visits her girlfriend, to which Courtney responds, “Texas.” Courtney continued, “I know Ralph has a lot of ‘the discovery.’ You know, when you’re going through a divorce, you have to provide evidence. It’s called ‘discovery.’ And I know Ralph feels pretty confident about the discovery that he has.”\n\nOn a hot mic while filming her confessional interview, Courtney claimed that also had photos of Drew and her girlfriend on her phone. “I have pictures of them on my phone, but I wasn’t going to say that on camera. Y’all shouldn’t leave me in there with vodka that long. Now we see why she was pushing so hard for that adoption. Because she was like, ‘Adopt this child, so I can be in my gay lover relationship and you pay the bills.'”\n\nTy, whose full name is Tamera, is a professional basketball player with the WNBA. She played for the Atlanta Dream from 2008 to 2009; the Chicago Sky from 2009 to 2017; the Shanxi Flame from 2016 to 2017; and the Las Vegas Aces from 2018 to 2019. She also played for the Atlanta Dream for a second time in 2017.\n\nWhy Did Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman Divorce From RHOA?\n\nWhy did Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman divorce from The Real Housewives of Atlanta? Drew and Ralph filed for divorce from Drew in March 2023 after nine years of marriage. Ralph listed their date of separation as February 19, 2023, while Drew listed it as February 23, 2023. “Love is a beautiful thing,” Ralph said in a statement to People at the time. “Unfortunately we have made the difficult decision to move on to our next chapters, independent of each other. Drew and I have decided to file for divorce. We have three amazing young children, and their mindset and growth is what is most important. As we navigate this difficult time, I ask that you please respect our privacy.”\n\nDrew added in her own statement, “After eight years of wholeheartedly fighting for my marriage, I have made the agonizing decision to release my husband with love. Although Ralph and I have decided to move forward separately, the hope is to remain friends so that we can co-parent responsibly. In spite of our very public life, I am asking for privacy during this difficult time as my children and I learn how to navigate through our new beginnings.”\n\nIn the filing, Drew, who filed for divorce an hour before Ralph, accused Ralph of being a “serial cheater and adulterer” who abused her mentally, financially, and got “physically aggressive” with her. Drew doubled down on her filing in an interview with People in June 2023. “Well everything in the petition I obviously stand by and it was just a culmination of things that should not happen in a marriage,” Drew said. “And I think the inability to own it, the inability to apologize, the inability to work through it, the inability to care about my emotional state and wanting to work and heal that, was very challenging.”\n\nDrew told People that her “boiling point” was when their marital issues “started to happen on camera” on The Real Housewives of Atlanta and she began to feel “embarrassment on top of what we were dealing with behind closed doors.” “[It was] definitely the breaking point and enough is enough,” she said. “And I didn’t see that coming. Of course I was forever, but it was like [there was] nothing else left for me to hold onto because the behavior and inappropriateness just never stopped. It was just too much.”\n\nIn a statement to People, Ralph denied that Drew’s filing told the true story of the reason for their divorce. “I love my wife with all my heart. It is no secret that marriage is a challenging journey, one that is not for the faint of heart,” she said. “My family means the world to me and I’ve dedicated myself to providing support, encouragement and acting as a pillar of strength for my wife and children.”\n\nHe continued, “Although we know the real reason that ultimately led to my request for divorce, I’m taking this time to be more introspective and working to become the best version of myself. I stand by my response to the petition however I sincerely apologize for my part in the deterioration of our relationship. As seasons change, I’m hopeful and optimistic for brighter days ahead.”\n\nDrew, for her part, told People at the time that she was “hopeful for an amicable divorce.” “I’m hoping for a great co-parenting partner. I’m hoping for us to come out of this and be able to be friends and be respectful,” she said. “I’m hoping for my kids to be happy and just to really see what life has for me on the other side of all this. It’s hard to imagine right now, but I would love to just be completely whole moving forward.”\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta is available to stream on Peacock.\n\nOur mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
