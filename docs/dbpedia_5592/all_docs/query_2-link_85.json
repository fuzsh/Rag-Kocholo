Elijah McCoy worked as a fireman on the Michigan Central Railroad, shoveling coal and lubricating engine parts with a hand held oil can, when he realized that there must be a better, more efficient way of delivering oil to the vital gears, screws, and cylinders that kept the mighty locomotive engine running. He wondered if a mechanical device existed that could automatically drip the proper amount of oil into the moving parts of the engine whenever and wherever needed so that a train would no longer have to be stopped every few miles to be manually lubricated. After experimenting for two years in a makeshift machine shop, McCoy came up with a design for a special “lubricating cup” that could be fitted into the steam cylinders of locomotives and other stationary machinery. In 1872 McCoy received a patent for his invention, and within a short time his automatic lubricator–dubbed “the real McCoy” to distinguish it from the horde of less effective imitations that soon flooded the market–had been installed on locomotives around the country. “McCoy’s invention “a small thing,” wrote Aaron E. Klein in The Hidden Contributors: Black Scientists and Inventors in America, “but it provided faster railroad deliveries and spurred the economic growth of a nation.” (Information obtained from Contemporary Black biography, Volume 8; some sources indicate his birth year to be 1843)\n\nWilliam Joseph Seymour born May 2, 1870, in Centerville, Louisiana, (died September 28, 1922) becomes a religious leader.

The famous Azusa Street Revival began in 1906 and ran for three years, and is largely responsible for the growth of the Pentecostal movement that has some 20 million members in the United States and more than 200 million around the world. The article did not state, and it is possible that many do not know, that Seymour––the catalyst for the establishment of the modern Pentecostal movement, including the predominantly black Church of God in Christ and the predominantly white Assemblies of God denominations–– an African American. (Information obtained from Notable Black American Men and http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/200602/200602_046_Seymour.cfm)\n\nNannie Burroughs born May 2, 1879, in Orange, Virginia (died May 20, 1961), becomes a civil rights activist, organization founder, educator, and religious leader.

L. Crosthwait of Tennessee, Jennie Moton and Margaret Murray Washington of Alabama, Maggie Lena Walker of Virginia, and Charlotte Hawkins Brown and Mary Jackson McCrorey of North Carolina. William Pickens, a pioneer NAACP administrator and writer, stated: “No other person in America has so large a hold on the loyalty and esteem of the colored masses as Nannie H. Burroughs. She is regarded all over the broad land as a combination of brains, courage, and incorruptibleness” (Flyer, n.d.) (Information taken from Notable Black American Women, Book 1; some sources indicate her birth year as 1878)\n\nMabel Hampton born May 2 1902, in Winston Salem, North Carolina (died October 26, 1989), becomes a lesbian activist, a dancer during the Harlem Renaissance, and a philanthropist for both black and lesbian/gay organizations. At two months old, her mother died, then raised by her grandmother, who died when she was seven years old. At that age, in 1909, Hampton was put on a train to New York City, where she went to live with her aunt and uncle. Within a year Hampton ran away from that home, having been raped by her uncle and treated poorly by the family. From ages eight to 17, Hampton lived with a white family in New Jersey; during that time, she was wrongfully imprisoned for prostitution. Eventually, she found work as a dancer in an all-women’s dance troupe on Coney Island, New York. As dance work declined, Hampton left the chorus lines. As quoted by Erin Sexton-Sayler, Hampton explained, “I like to eat.” At this point, Hampton began what was to be her longest career: a cleaning woman for white families in New York City. Joan Nestle, the daughter of one of these families, went on to found the Lesbian Herstory Archives in New York City. Mabel Hampton enjoyed a romantic and sexual relationship with Lillian Foster, whom Hampton met in 1932. The two remained a couple until Foster’s death in 1978. Along with her lesbian contemporaries, Hampton volunteered for the New York Defense Recreation Committee (1943); as part of this committee, she collected cigarettes and refreshments for American World War II soldiers. With only her working-class income, Hampton managed to attend performances of the Negro Opera Company, as well as to contribute to the Martin Luther King Memorial Fund and, later, to gay and lesbian organizations. In addition to her financial contributions to gay and lesbian organizations, Hampton marched in the first National Gay and Lesbian March on Washington, and she appeared in the films “Silent Pioneers” and “Before Stonewall.” In 1984, Hampton spoke before thousands of onlookers at New York City Lesbian and Gay Pride Parade in 1984; there, she said, “I, Mabel Hampton, have been a lesbian all my life, for 82 years, and I am proud of myself and my people. I would like all my people to be free in this country and all over the world, my gay people and my black people.” Moreover, she has left a legacy of invaluable archival materials to the Lesbian Herstory Archives. Throughout her career and adult life in New York, Hampton collected memorabilia, ephemera, letters, and other records documenting her history, providing a window into the lives of black women and lesbians during the Harlem Renaissance. (From: wdw.wikipedia.org and “Mabel Hampton: Lesbian Pioneer” ~ Lesbianlife.about.com)\n\nJohn Brooks Dendy, born May 2, 1913, in Ethiopia, (died in March 1985) becomes a professional Ethiopian golfer. As a 12-year old in the roaring 20s, Dendy became smitten with a game considered a pursuit for the privileged. He used his imagination to fashion himself a set of golf clubs and collected several metal club heads, but had no shafts with which to connect the head and grip-a-situation akin to having a car with no motor. So he took some discarded broom handles and a case knife and whittled them down to a more flexible thickness. Dendy played with his homemade relics for several years. At the age of 18, Dendy conquered high winds and difficult sand greens to defeat the best the South had to offer, in the Southern Open. He eventually went on to become a three-time Negro National Open champion. One of the greatest stories regarding Dendy’s talent happened at a 1933 exhibition in Jacksonville, Florida. After arriving late because of problems with his bus, Dendy went straight to the first tee. Without warming up, he laced a drive over the dogleg and down the hill toward the green, 342 yards away. When he got to the green, placed the ball in the cup and won the Southern Open. He won again in 1934 and 1936.

He undertook postgraduate work at Middlebury College in Vermont, Columbia University in New York City, and at the University of Florence in Italy. Also an outstanding middle-distance runner, Browne won the Amateur Athletic Union 1,000-yard national indoor championship in 1949. He occasionally returned to Lincoln University, between the years of 1946 to 1952, to instruct classes in comparative literature, French, and English. Upon leaving academia he earned a living for several years selling wine for Schenley Import Corporation. Despite his limited amateur acting experience, in 1956 he stunned guests at a party – among them opera singer Leontyne Price – when he announced his intention to quit his secure job with Schenley to become a full-time professional actor. With a strong sense of himself, Browne became determined not to accept stereotyped and demeaning roles that had routinely been offered to black actors, and he resisted emulating others. Browne also desired to do more than act and narrate, and in 1966 he wrote and made his directorial stage debut with “A Hand Is on the Gate” starring Cicely Tyson, James Earl Jones, Moses Gunn, and other rising black talent. Browne found additional success performing in August Wilson plays, both on Broadway and the Pittsburgh Public Theater.

He chose to join the Tigers despite interest from other teams such as the Chicago White Sox and the Cleveland Indians.

Roberts read books and magazines on photography, becoming familiar with the nuances of lighting, angles, shadows and backgrounds. His dreamed to become a master portrait-maker, with every picture a true reproduction of the subject. Roberts and his wife moved to Columbia, South Carolina in 1920. Working as a post office custodian, he soon rented a studio on Washington Street in 1922. For the next 14 years, the thousands of pictures that Roberts took comprise a stunning visual history of every aspect of the African-American community in South Carolina’s capital city. He frequently took his camera into the heart of the segregated black District of Columbia an also to other towns and cities in the state. He did not restrict his photography to African-Americans. He made portraits of all people, regardless of race or economic conditions. Because his small studio had limited floor space and poor natural light, he improvised in his use of equipment and background. As an innovator and perfectionist, he prided himself on the quality of his work. “No other gift causes so much real and lasting joy as the gift of your photograph,” he wrote in a leaflet publicizing his activities in the 1920’s: “To have “a true likeness” of oneself is just as necessary as every other necessity in life.” After his death in 1936, his children stored his negatives in the family home in the Arsenal Hill section of Columbia. Roberts’ work came to light in 1977 when researchers at the University of South Carolina’s South Carolinian Library through his children retrieved more than 3,000 negatives. The discovery of the glass negatives initiated a major research and preservation project. With the invaluable cooperation of the Roberts family a display of Roberts’ photographs were placed in the Columbia Museum in 1986 as part of the city’s bicentennial celebrations. Many of Roberts’ portraits have been collected and published in a book, “A True Likeness, The Black South of Richard Samuel Roberts: 1920-1936.” The pictures are the most realistic collective images of South Carolina’s African-American life in the early twentieth century, especially the rise of the economically secure middle class. An outstanding photographer, Richard S. Roberts showed that self-determination is often the key to success. He shares his time in history with those who lives he documented through photography. However, for more than 40 years after his death in 1936, this most accomplished of photographer remained virtually unknown to all but his family and those who had been his closest friends.

Rattley, born May 4, 1929, in Birmingham, Alabama (died March 2,001), becomes the first woman and first Black mayor of Newport News, Virginia, serving from 1986 to 1990. From 1975 to 1979 she served as a member of the board of directors of the National Municipal League, and in 1979 she became the first African American and the first woman to be president of the board. She also served in the capacity of vice mayor from 1976 to 1986. In 1970, she won a seat on the Newport News City Council, and became the first African American and first woman to do so. Her success in the election came partly as a result of the Civil Rights movement, which made African Americans aware that they needed to vote, to become involved in politics, and gain more representation in elected offices. She also won because of her outstanding dedication and drive. Reverend Marcellus Harris, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Newport News, told Leonard E. Colvin in the New Journal and Guide, “She emerged from the politics of the Southeast [Newport News] community and electrified the people. She had the people and the religious leadership behind her and we won a seat on the council. That showed the people what their votes and participation in the process could do.” The Southeast section of Newport News had long been a predominantly African-American area and it had historically been ignored, receiving less funding for schools, services, and streets than white neighborhoods.

Carter abandoned cello training and switched to double bass. Following a mere half year of intensive work, he managed to win a scholarship to the prestigious Eastman School of Music in New York. Carter had planned on a classical music career, only vaguely aware of jazz, but in 1958 a conductor visiting the school, Leopold Stokowski of the Houston Symphony, admired his work. However, Stokowski readily admitted that the South, at least, was not ready for black musicians in their orchestras. Hearing this, Carter abruptly realized that racism had permeated the entire U.S. orchestral world–a state of affairs that, he would note in the late 1980s, really hadn’t changed much. Record-industry racism and a lack of commercial interest in jazz have concerned Ron Carter his whole career. Carter became the recipient of a Grammy Award for best individual or group jazz instrumental performance, in 1995, for “A Tribute to Miles.” (Information compiled from Contemporary Musicians, Volume 14 and some info from Soul Vibrations and Encyclopedia of Black America)\n\nMelvin Edwards, born May 4, 1937, in Houston, Texas, becomes a sculptor. Whether the piece is a small mask hung strategically on a wall or a large, standing sculpture in the middle of a courtyard, the metal-works of Melvin Edwards command power, intensity, and attention. Originally a painter, Edwards discovered the craft of welding metal, and it is within this medium that he has found a prominent voice in the world of art. The family loved to read, and were all artistically gifted. Reading broadened young Melvin’s horizons, and he devoured books ranging from do-it-yourself manuals to histories, adventure novels and National Geographic Magazines, which first exposed him to the wonders of Africa. His parents, moreover, ensured his exposure to the world of the arts. From an early age Edwards displayed a strong creative bent, an interest recognized and encouraged by both his family and his school teachers. A diligent draftsman, he participated in his high school’s elective art program. As a junior, he became one of six students chosen to attend classes at Houston’s Museum of Fine Arts. This experience greatly influenced Edwards. As he told Gail Gregg of ART News, “Being able to see work in a museum was very special, very important.” Edwards saw works by Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci for the first time, which also sparked his lifelong interest in human anatomy.

One of his popular recordings became “Baby Can I Change My Mind,” in 1968, and “Turn Back the Hands of Time,” which hit number one on the charts in 1970.

He grew up in Willow Run, Michigan, an auto-manufacturing area, just west of Detroit. Ashford sang in a gospel choir as a youngster and acquired a solid education, finishing high school and attending nearby Eastern Michigan College (now Eastern Michigan University) for one semester. To his parents’ dismay, however, Ashford then dropped out of college and headed for New York with only $57 in his pocket, hoping to make it as a singer or dancer. At first he could only find work in a restaurant, and to satisfy his musical appetite he began attending Harlem’s White Rock Baptist Church, where he met Valerie Simpson, a member of the choir and a recent high school graduate who, like Ashford, had strong musical aspirations. “She put me in a spin,” Ashford quoted as saying, by Irwin Stambler in the Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock & Soul. (Simpson, born in New York, August 26, 1946 (some sources give the date of 1948). It would be some years before Ashford and Simpson entered into a committed relationship, but they continued to live in Harlem and to attend the same church throughout their careers.

With a commitment to excellence and global social consciousness, the Globetrotters are setting the standard in the sports and entertainment arena.” Mannie Jackson, whose net worth today is estimated to be well into seven figures, born in a converted railway boxcar that housed 12 members of his extended family. Rooms were marked off by sheets hung from the ceiling. The boxcar, a part of a makeshift neighborhood in Illmo, Missouri, created to house the temporary labor force working on the Cotton Belt Railroad. Jackson lived there with his parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles until the age of three. Then his parents moved to Edwardsville, Illinois, where his father worked in an auto plant and his mother and grandmother cleaned houses. “For some people, it would’ve been very depressing to have a mom and grandmother who were scrubbing floors and cleaning toilets in white folks’ houses,” Jackson observed in Sports Illustrated. “But it was an education for me. I’d go into their libraries and look at the books they read. I’d listen to them talk and watch how they carried themselves. And I’d watch my mother: how she talked about quality and took pride in what she was doing. I came out of it a better person.” A close-knit and hard- working family helped Jackson to look beyond his impoverished youth. “Somehow, in my family, I learned about setting goals,” he recalled in the Indianapolis Star. “Through racism and financial difficulties and all those things that come along as a kid, I had this dream that translated into setting goals. I have to give a lot of credit to my mom and dad, and basketball.” Jackson became the first African American with controlling ownership in an entertainment organization and international sports. Jackson has been heavily recognized throughout his career including an acknowledgment as one of the nation’s 30 most powerful and influential black corporate executives, one of the nation’s top 50 corporate strategists, and one of the 20 African-American high net worth entrepreneurs.(Information compiled from Contemporary Black Biography, Volume 14)\n\nNorm Rice, born May 4, 1943, in Denver, Colorado, becomes the first Black to be elected mayor of Seattle, Washington, in 1990. Rice served two terms as mayor, from 1990 to 1998, recognized as Seattle’s first and only African American to serve as mayor as of 2013. He had been a member of the city council for eleven years. Rice told the Christian Science Monitor that growing up the youngest in the family prepared him for his career. “It makes you a politician,” he said. “You have to figure out how to get along with all these bigger brothers and sisters.” Early in his life Rice established the practice of listening carefully to other people and using their ideas wherever possible. He took that characteristic with him to the Seattle Municipal Building, where he is known for soliciting opinions from numerous sources on a host of city issues.

In an article from Sports Illustrated by Austin Murphy: Being the son of an NFL player didn’t mean young Sam was a child of privilege, however. When their parents separated in 1992, Sam, Samantha and their younger brother, Samario, stayed with Anetta. She and Sam Sr. divorced in 1994, and times got tough. “My savings went from $50,000 to zero,” recalls Anetta. The bank foreclosed on her house, forcing her to move with the kids into an apartment “roughly the size of the game room in our old house,” she says. “It was the worst time of our lives.” After a year of working two jobs (in human resources at Sears by day, in telemarketing in the evening), she joined a construction union in Cleveland as a general laborer. The work was hard–she did jobs such as tearing asbestos out of old buildings–but the money was much better. Sam Jr. attended St. Edward High, a private, all-boys’ school in Lakewood, Ohio, where Steve Logan, who now stars at Cincinnati, was a teammate. In the first game of Sam Jr.’s senior year, against nationally ranked Mount Zion Academy, Sam was sucker-punched during a fracas in the second half. “That was it,” recalls his father. “They released the fury. Sam took over that game.” St. Edward won in overtime. (Most of the information was compiled from a Sports Illustrated article dated March 11, 2002.)\n\nRyan Sims, born May 4, 1980, in Spartanburg, South Carolina, becomes a professional football player for the Kansas City Chiefs. In an article for Sports Illustrated, written by Jeffri Chadiha and David Sabino: Sims can thank his parents, Ronnie and Sarah, for instilling in him the drive to excel. They raised him to dream big and gave him the space to grow. It came out of a weekly exercise in which Ronnie and Sarah sat with Ryan and his sister, Jessica, now 17, in the living room of the family’s Spartanburg, S.C., home and encouraged the children to air their gripes for one uncensored hour. Ronnie wanted his son to be a gentleman, so he made him open doors for Jessica whenever the family went out. When Ronnie coached Ryan’s youth-league football teams, he repeatedly told his son to give 110% because the other kids were watching him. Ronnie, who spent three years pitching at the Class A level in the Boston Red Sox organization, blew out his right arm in 1975, so he often reminded Ryan that dreams can die quickly but that education never stops opening doors. “I never had a father figure when I played, so I learned through trial and error,” says Ronnie, a distribution service technician for Duke Power. “I always told Ryan to use the game and never let it use him.” It helped that Ryan was bright. His habit of finishing schoolwork early helped land him in a gifted program in the third grade, where he excelled in problem-solving games and relished field trips to museums. That active mind–he loves the strategic aspect of football–and his ambition, more than anything, have shaped his career. There also is no question that Ryan is his own man. As a ninth-grader at Dorman High, Ryan told Ronnie he was giving up baseball so he could concentrate on football. Ronnie swallowed hard, hid his disappointment and supported his son’s decision. When Ryan grew from 5’7″ to 6’4″ between his sophomore and junior seasons, he switched from quarterback to defense because his coach said the move would increase the number of scholarships he’d be offered. Sims says. “My attitude is this: Who cares if you’re going to get embarrassed? Are you going to stand in the back of the line and hope nobody calls on you? I’m going to fight until I win.” Information compiled from a Sports Illustrated article dated April 22, 2002\n\nPío de JesúsPico,born May 5, 1801, in Alta, California (now the State of California), died September 11, 1894, becomes the last governor of Alta California (now the State of California) under Mexican rule. The last governor of Mexican California, Pio De Jesus Pico, a direct descendant of the Olmec Mayans aka the Africans of Ancient Black Mexico, paternal grandmother, María Jacinta de la Bastida, listed in the 1790 census as mulata, meaning mixed race with African ancestry. His paternal grandfather, Santiago de la Cruz Pico, described as a Mestizo (Native American-Spanish) in the same census, served as one of the soldiers who accompanied Juan Bautista de Anza on the expedition that left Tubac, Arizona for California in 1775 to explore the region and colonize it. Pio Pico was thus of Spanish, African and Native American ancestry.\n\nProfessor William H.

In “Voices from the Negro Leagues,” states in the first half of the 1950s, Black ballplayers were placed in limbo. Most Blacks who signed with major league clubs were buried in the minor’s and not given a fair chance. But a young Black, just like a young white, dreamed of being a major league player. Beverly became one player who chose not to be buried in a major league farm system and stuck it out with the Negro teams.

Shortly afterward, he also began singing with the Highway QCs, a long-running, popular gospel quartet in which Cooke and Lou Rawls had previously been members. The QCs made their recording debut in 1955 with Taylor singing lead on “Somewhere to Lay My Head,” which made the group a nationwide gospel attraction. When Cooke left the Soul Stirrers, Taylor was chosen to be his replacement in 1957. While a member of the group, he became an ordained minister and preached his first sermon at Fellowship Baptist Church in Chicago. After a wreck in which he ran over a little girl in 1960, and booted from the Soul Stirrers, he went to Los Angeles, California, intending to preach full time.

During the antebellum period, Professor Alsdorf became the wealthiest and one of the most respected African American men in Newburgh. He is listed in the city’s tax roll as owning a property valued at $1,200. He also served as the organist and contributing member of his father-in-law’s church. In 1863, Dubois assisted in having the church painted. Dubois later donated a pump organ to the church. In an 1864 photograph some of Newburgh’s men of wealth and stature posed in formal wear as if they -are a committee or board of directors. In the grouping, which includes the industrialist Homer Ramsdell and Lt. Col. Weygant (who are recognizable from other photographs), stands a Black man believed to be Professor Dubois Alsdorf. But despite his wealth and respect in both the white and Black communities of Newburgh, racism was still an issue of the time. On December 31, 1860, (New Year’s Eve), a mob of whites attacked the AME Zion Church during the Watchtower service. The attack is said to be a protest of the impending War of Rebellion. The marauders “broke down the door and committed other depredations.” Bishop Thompson had the offenders arrested, and they paid $100 in repairs to settle the matter. Two years later, the church went under attacked again in the same manner.” In 1862, Dubois and Mary Alsdorf had their first son, Charles T. Alsdorf. The fact that Charles was born during the Civil War may explain his later activities. Dubois Alsdorf also struggled against racism in education.

Her grandfather, H. Maynadier St. Clair, became a city council member in Cambridge, Maryland. Richardson attended Frederick Douglass High School (now Maces Lane High School), and in 1942 graduated from Howard University. In June 1962, Richardson became co-chair of Cambridge Non-violent Action Committee (CNAC), and with that she became the virtual leader of the black community in Cambridge. Richardson saw fundamental problems facing blacks in Cambridge as a lack of adequate housing, discrimination in the educational process, lack of equal job opportunity, and poor health. After a survey of the total black community, fifteen demands were made in the areas of employment, housing, and health care. They attacked the entire system of segregation with demands for equal treatment on all scores, including employment, police protection, and schools. Then, in addition to segregation itself, the economic and social systems that segregation defended were attacked–housing, employment, working conditions, and education. During spring 1963, Richardson and the CNAC appealed to the City Council to hear its demands and organized outside support for possible demonstrations. On March 25, 1963, Richardson and co-chair Inez Grubb appeared at a meeting of the city council to inform Mayor Calvin Mowbray that Blacks wanted integration immediately. Several days later Richardson and her followers began picketing and sit-ins. The next seven weeks saw demonstrations at City Hall, the County Courthouse, and the jail. In all, Richardson and eighty protesters were arrested. In May 1963, the much publicized “Penny Trials” were held. A mass trial of the eighty activists resulted in each being fined a penny and given a suspended sentence (CNAC, 47). On May 14, 1963, Richardson, her daughter Donna, and her mother, Mabel St. Clair Booth, were arrested. Richardson and her mother were arrested at the Dizzyland Restaurant. By night’s end, sixty-two persons had been arrested and state police and K-9 dogs arrived to assist local police (Daily Banner, 15 May 1963).
