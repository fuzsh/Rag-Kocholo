        "text": "As this outlet reported, Pittman filed for divorce in February after 8 years of marriage — and while they managed to get the documents sealed, the two continued to hurl accusations against each other in the public eye. And apparently, nothing is off limits, including the kids.\n\nAfter the RHOA star clapped back at Pittman's \"fake\" cousin for insinuating she only wanted Ralph to adopt her son Josiah — aka “Jojo” so that she could spend more time with women. Sidora was accused of cheating on Pittman with retired WNBA star Ty Young.\n\nThe former happy couple have hurled several endless accusations against one another. While Sidora was accused of cheating with the female athlete, she claimed Pittman of \"repeated adultery,\" \"mental abuse,\" and being \"physically aggressive.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for the RadarOnline.com newsletter to get your daily dose of dope. Daily. Breaking. Celebrity news. All free.\n\n“[Ralph became physically aggressive with [Drew] to the point that the [Drew] considered filing an application for a Temporary Protective Order and flying with her three (3) minor children to Chicago, Illinois so that [Drew] and the minor children could feel safe,\" she alleged in court documents.\n\nSidora and Pittman share two biological kids. Besides child support, the RHOA star has demanded temporary and permanent primary physical custody of their kids and exclusive use of their marital home."
