        "text": "Drew Sidora slammed her husband, Ralph Pittman, for not shutting down his “fake” cousin, Courtney Rhodes, after she made “disgusting comments” during a recent episode of the Real Housewives of Atlanta. Ralph hit back, accusing his estranged wife of playing victim and calling her “adoption request” a “money grab.”\n\nDrew and Ralph, who are currently embroiled in a nasty divorce, exchanged real-time social media blows amid drama unfolding on the Bravo series. Courtney implied that Drew wanted Ralph to adopt her oldest child so she could spend time with women, amid allegations that she had engaged in lesbian affairs during her marriage.\n\nDrew took to Twitter to slam her ex for not speaking out against Courtney’s remarks.\n\nShe wrote — “I must always protect and stand for my children against this type of evil. I gave him the opportunity to shut his unverifiable fake cousin down for her disgusting comments made concerning my son, however he refused to do so & it breaks my heart.”\n\nThe RHOA star added in a separate post — “She meant to be nasty & rude making comments and dragging my child into this… KIDS ARE ALWAYS OFF LIMITS!!! That’s it, that’s all….we’re done!”\n\nRalph replied to the first tweet, writing — “It’s time to speak truth so let’s be real. You expect me to pay child support when he has a father that wants to play an active role in his life but you won’t let him. Your adoption request was only a money grab and control. Since the age of 3, I stepped up to fill the gap as a man and unconditionally provided from my heart without expectations.”\n\nHe continued — “I will continue being there but you’re not going to take advantage of me or use this show to get your way. I understand playing the battered victim role earns you sympathy on this platform but you will respect me as a Father. I love all my kids and have given them the world, including you. It’s about them now. #Respect.”\n\nDrew’s rant coincided with her public apology to co-star, Kenya Moore, for dissing her acting career in a previous episode.\n\nDrew tweeted — “@KenyaMoore I know we talked about this already privately, but I just want to publicly apologize. Any comments made about your career wasn’t necessary. You are a Superstar! Legend! Icon! Let’s not forget forever the moment.”\n\nKenya replied — “Thank you @DREWSIDORA I appreciate this. Keep shining! Let nothing nor anyone stop you.”\n\nDrew filed for divorce in March, telling People that she had been “wholeheartedly fighting for my marriage” but had to make “the agonizing decision to release my husband with love.”\n\n“Although Ralph and I have decided to move forward separately, the hope is to remain friends so that we can co-parent responsibly,” she said. “In spite of our very public life, I am asking for privacy during this difficult time as my children and I learn how to navigate through our new beginnings.”\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta airs Sundays at 8 pm ET on Bravo."
