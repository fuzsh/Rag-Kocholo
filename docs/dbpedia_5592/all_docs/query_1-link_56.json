        "text": "7.6K\n\nReal Housewives of Atlanta star Drew Sidora’s marriage to Ralph Pittman, Jr. has seen its fair share of ups and downs, but Drew is making it clear that there is nothing that can break her marriage, even amid new rumors that Ralph may be gay.\n\nMost recently, Drew and Ralph got into it over an alleged sexual advancement made by Ralph’s former female assistant, and her castmates had her back.\n\nSpeaking to Distractify Drew said of Ralph, “Yes, he can be an a**hole. He admitted that he has owned his junk. But he is who he is. And he showed me other things.”\n\nBecause of all the trust issues, the couple are “actively” in therapy as they want things to get better between them.\n\n“You’ll see us go to marriage counseling and we’re still in marriage counseling,” Drew told the outlet. “And I feel like he is putting forth the effort to try to communicate softer. And I appreciate him for showing up to marriage counseling.”\n\nDrew also admits that she can be “triggering” to Ralph but that the two are committed to standing as a united front as her marriage isn’t “perfect”\n\n“I appreciate him for acknowledging his faults and wanting to stay here because he can leave. Neither one of us are holding each other or tying each other to this marriage. So, I appreciate someone that is willing to stick it out and go through those valleys.”\n\nDrew says she doesn’t believe in divorce and that people “give up too easily on marriage.”\n\nAnd while she’s willing to put all her marital issues out there in the name of transparency, Drew does sometimes wonder if she’s sharing too much.\n\n“It’s always a thought like, ‘Are we showing too much?’” Drew said before continuing, “I mean, we were new. We weren’t at the level of knowing how to concoct a story. I want people to see who I am as a mother, a wife, a friend, a daughter, and I made a conscious effort to just be more vulnerable here.”\n\nDrew admitted that even through all of Ralphs faults he’s a great father and businessman with “many layers.”\n\nBut is one of those layers being…. gay?\n\nRumors have been circulating after a recent episode where Drew’s assistant alleged that Ralph was gay. In a new clip, captured by @kandiburrussfanpage, Ralph is calling B.S. on those accusations.\n\n“People will say anything, everybody needs a storyline,” he laughingly said.\n\n“I’ve got all of these things going on, I’m cheating, I’m doing this, now I’m gay”, he continued. “Next, they’re going to tell me I’m a lesbian!”\n\nRalph says he doesn’t “know what to say about it [the rumors]” as they’re nothing.\n\nKandi Burruss’ husband Todd Tucker also appears in the clip and backs Ralph saying, “Y’all gotta stop making sh*t up.”"
