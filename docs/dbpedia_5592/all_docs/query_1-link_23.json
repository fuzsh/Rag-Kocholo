        "text": "The couple, who have appeared on “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” since season 13, have officially split. Both filed for divorce on Monday.\n\nDrew Sidora and Ralph Pittman are officially splitting. The couple, currently on “The Real Housewives of Atlanta,” publicly announced their decision to end their marriage.\n\nThe news came on Wednesday, Pittman saying, “Love is a beautiful thing,” in a statement obtained by People. “Unfortunately we have made the difficult decision to move on to our next chapters, independent of each other.”\n\n“Drew and I have decided to file for divorce,” he continued. “We have three amazing young children, and their mindset and growth is what is most important. As we navigate this difficult time, I ask that you please respect our privacy.”\n\nPer the outlet, Pittman and Sidora both filed for divorce on Monday, with the Atlanta “Real Housewife” filing her divorce petition just an hour before her estranged husband. “The Game” actress’ petition details “there is no chance or hope of reconciliation,” while Pittman’s filing requests joint legal and physical custody of the two children the couple have together, 7-year-old son Machai and 5-year-old daughter Aniya.\n\nThe pair did not hide their marital woes from “The Real Housewives of Atlanta,” which\n\nSidora joined in season 13. The reality series highlighted various spats and issues between the two, including an incident involving Pittman’s former assistant, who was fired after Sidora learned of a suspicious text message she sent to Pittman.\n\nMany of their disagreements lead to involvement from other “RHOA” cast members, including Kenya Moore, who called Pittman “disrespectful” last season.\n\nOn a cast trip, while Sidora shared with the others how the incident made her uncomfortable, Pittman defended himself and questioned Sidora’s perspective. Moore went on to say to his face it “would piss me the f–k off” if her husband spoke to her that way, telling Pittman he was actively tearing Sidora down.\n\nBravo has yet to announce a release date for season 15 of “RHOA.” Former episodes are available to stream on Peacock.\n\nTheGrio is FREE on your TV via Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Roku and Android TV.
