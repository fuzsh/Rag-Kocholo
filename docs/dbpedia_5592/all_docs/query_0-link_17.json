We review evidence that the core emotional regions of the brain constitute the primary mediator of the well-established association between stress and health, as well as the neural focus of “wear and tear” due to ongoing adaptation. This mediation, in turn, allows us to model the interplay over time between context, current stressor exposure, internal regulation of bodily processes, and health outcomes. We illustrate how this approach facilitates the integration of current findings in human neuroscience and genetics with key constructs from stress models from the social and life sciences, with implications for future research and the design of interventions targeting individuals at risk.\n\nKeywords: stress, brain, allostasis, allostatic load, genes\n\nIntroduction\n\n“There is growing evidence that multilevel analyses spanning neural and social perspectives can foster comprehensive accounts of cognition, emotion, behavior, and health. This is in part because the social environment shapes neural structures and processes and vice versa” (Cacioppo, Ernst et al., 2000, p. 152).\n\nThis review and synthesis covers broad themes and key findings across numerous areas of stress research to develop a new framework for converging biomedical and psychosocial models of the stress process. This effort expands on theory that identifies the brain as the central mediator of ongoing systemwide physiological adjustment to environmental challenge (McEwen, 2004, 2007; Schulkin, 2003; Sterling & Eyer, 1988; Sterling, 2004). This process has been termed allostasis (Sterling & Eyer, 1988), a major revision (McEwen 2004) or replacement (Sterling, 2004) of the classical theory of homeostasis. Exploiting the central role of the brain in allostasis, we integrate new research in human neuroscience and genetics with key elements of stress models from the social and life sciences to develop a model of the interplay over time between current stressor exposure (in its physical, social, and cultural context), the internal regulation of bodily processes, and health outcomes. Integration of social and life science research perspectives simultaneously constrains models of the stress process at all levels of analysis and prompts their expansion to include new methods, mechanisms, and objectives, with implications for the development of a research agenda and the design of interventions targeting individuals at risk.\n\nIn the expanding research utilizing allostatis as a working model of the relationship between environmental challenge and physiological outcomes, the focus has been on the effect of prior stressors (e.g., McEwen & Seeman, 2003; Singer, Ryff, & Seeman, 2004). We expand on these earlier models to include response to a current stressor, which we term allostatic accommodation. Modeling the ongoing stress process requires a much higher level of specificity about the underlying mechanisms of allostasis. To this end, we argue that the core emotional regions of the brain1 serve as the primary mediator of physiological and behavioral response to a current stressor and that other physiological and behavioral change in the face of adversity is secondary to this central mediation. It follows that the core emotional regions of the brain will be the first and primary sites to show evidence of long-term “wear and tear” (McEwen & Seeman, 1999; McEwen & Stellar, 1993) as a part of the cost of physiological accommodation to environmental demand. Modeling the ongoing stress process also demands a higher level of specificity about the stressors themselves and their relationship to proximal and distal risks and resources in the environment. Integration of allostasis with recent findings in neuroscience and dynamic systems theories regarding the context of stress gives us a new theoretical platform for incorporating biology into the social psychological study of stress.\n\nThe result of this effort is a model delineating the individual’s response to a current stressor. This model reveals systematic sources of variation in the stress response itself that render it mandatory to explore the full set of associations between personal stress history, the stressor in context, brain, and body to best understand health outcomes. Within this allostatic model, an organism’s ability to “achieve stability through change” (p. 171, McEwen, 1998) represents ongoing development. Establishing ongoing development within the stress response itself focuses a new lens on the etiology of acquired vulnerability and resistance to stress across the lifespan. This prompts specific predictions about the impact of accumulating life stress within an array of research domains, with suggestions for future research.\n\nThis effort is prompted by the observation that the social and biological approaches to stress research had, over many years, diverged into largely parallel structures with independent academic research traditions, methodologies, and literature (Cacioppo, Berntson, Sheridan, & McClintock, 2000; Magnusson, 1995; Mason, 1971). These research traditions are now beginning to converge again, with notable interfaces arising in a number of disciplines, including human development (e.g., Cicchetti & Rogosch, 2001; Granger, Hood, Dreschel, Sergeant, & Likos, 2001; Gunnar & Vasquez, 2001; Susman, Schmeelk, Ponirakis, & Gariepy, 2001) and gerontology (e.g. Karlamangala, Singer, McEwen, Rowe & Seeman, 2002; Seeman, Crimmins, Huang, Singer, Bucur, Gruenwald et al., 2004), and emerging in new disciplines such as biosocial and public health epidemiology (Geronimus, Hicken, Keene, & Bound, 2006; Hubbs-Tate, Nation, Krebs, & Bellinger, 2006; Krieger, 2001) and social neuroscience (e.g., Caccioppo et al, 2007). In addition, new neuroimaging techniques are driving a renaissance in brain-body medicine (e.g., Lane et al, 2009; Lane & Wager, 2009). This, together with research involving clinical outcomes of stress-related disorders (mechanisms, treatment, epidemiology), has also served as an important interface between the fields of biomedical and psychosocial stress research (e.g., Brown, 2002; Caspi, et al., 2002; Cohen, Kessler, & Gordon, 1995; Gallo & Matthews, 2003; Glaser, Kiecolt-Glaser, Malarkey, & Sheridan, 1998; Moffit, Caspi, & Rutter, 2006; Rutter, 1994). Notably, the convergence of the social and biological research traditions has lacked a common model for specifying the stress process. The focus of the present paper is the development of such a model.\n\nThe model we propose here is potentially of use to stress researchers in the life sciences who are faced with the need to broaden their research agendas to include the impact of social/environmental influences on outcomes in a range of fields, including neuroscience, genetics, neuroendocrinology, medicine, and immunology. For example, identification of the core emotional systems of the brain as the neural foci of response and adaptation to stressor exposure is important because these will be the first and primary sites to show evidence of long-term “wear and tear” (McEwen & Seeman, 1999; McEwen & Stellar, 1993) as a part of the cost of physiological accommodation to environmental demand, including social context. Thus, this model raises questions regarding long-term stress-related plasticity and damage in the healthy human brain, with implications for present and future work in social neuroscience that we will discuss later. We also note the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between stressor exposure and adaptation, such that small-to-moderate amounts of stressor exposure (often termed stimulation or challenge) lead to increased health and improved physiological and mental function, and high levels of stressor exposure are related to negative health outcomes (see McEwen, 2002, for a review). For example, profound early deprivation of environmental stimulation is known to be detrimental to brain development, cognitive function, and socioemotional adaptation (Ames, 1997; Rutter, 1998) and progressive increases in environmental stimulation (up to a point) are associated with increases in neurocognitive function (Farah et al., in press) and other health outcomes (McEwen, 2002). While we will discuss this allostatic model primarily in terms of the “high-stress” side of this inverted U-shaped curve (where the majority of research on negative health outcomes has been concentrated), we will also use this model to articulate the difference between a helpful challenge and a harmful stressor, as well as who may be most stress-vulnerable (or resilient), when, and why. These are relatively new questions for social neuroscientists but they will resonate with stress researchers in the social sciences, for whom these are long-standing concerns. In addition, a common theoretical platform would be of use to social scientists who are faced with a rapidly advancing array of discoveries in the life sciences and who need to assess the potential usefulness of these advances in furthering psychosocial research agendas. While the rich literature on human stress and coping in the social sciences can serve to direct biological and medical research onto new and exciting ground, biological stress research (and human neuroscience in particular) can serve as an empirical testing ground for psychosocial theory and a means to refine the scope and methods of intervention research.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows: In the first section, we take the opportunity to understand the historical points of divergence and current points of intersection between stress research in the social and life sciences. Then we discuss the fundamentals of allostasis and how it functions in the integration of these research tranditions. This review will allow readers with diverse background to have a common understanding of the foundations of our model. In the second section, we briefly review the relevant brain anatomy and build our model of the allostatic response to a current stressor in context, with the brain as the master controller of this physiological adjustment and the primary regulator of allostasis. This is the point of transition in this work from a review of prior work to the development of our proposed, integrated model. We then model the current stress process from the perception of proximal and distal stressors in context, through central and peripheral accommodation as modified by prior allostatic load, with mental and physical health as primary outcomes. We conclude our model-building by bringing time and genetics in to the model. Throughout this section, we review the current evidence that stress-related neural changes in the healthy human brain play a key role in the well-established association between stress exposure and long-term decreases in well-being and health and suggest points for future research. In the final section, we summarize these points for future research and draw from our new conceptual framework to make predictions based on this model. Finally, we discuss implications of the model for new research and interventions targeted at individuals at risk.\n\nCommon Origins: Psychosocial and Biological Models of the Stress Process\n\nWalter Cannon and homeostasis\n\nStress research in the social and life sciences shares a common foundation in the work of Walter Cannon (Cannon, 1932) and Hans Selye (Selye, 1956). At the beginning of the 20th century, Harvard physiologist Walter Cannon expanded upon Claude Bernard’s views of a flexibly stable milieu interieur (Bernard, 1878: also see Goldstein, 1995a) in his investigation of the response of the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system to emergency situations. This system swiftly mobilizes the body’s energy resources by increasing epinephrine (adrenaline), which in turn increases blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar, as well as hastening blood coagulation, clearing fatigue products from muscles, and decreasing digestion (Cannon, 1920). In Cannon’s view, these processes occurred locally in the body, independent of central nervous system (CNS) control. He used the term homeostasis to refer to the way this array of independent physiological systems works together to re-establish initial conditions when the system is perturbed (Cannon, 1932).\n\nSelye, the GAS, and the “unknown mediator”\n\nHans Selye demonstrated that an organism has an adaptive response to adversity that includes both Cannon’s sympathetic (adrenaline-driven) responses plus the actions of hormones from the pituitary gland, which globally affect the major organs of the body in indirect but important ways (e.g., Selye, 1956). Selye proposed the existence of a generalized physiological syndrome that occurs in response to a great diversity of threats to the integrity of the organism (e.g., Selye, 1956). The syndrome, which he called the General Adaptation Syndrome or GAS (Selye, 1956), included three stages of sequelae to stressor exposure. The alarm stage is best characterized by dramatically increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis starts in the brain, where an area of the hypothalamus (the paraventricular nucleus) is activated by perceived adversity and begins to produce corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH, also called corticotropin releasing factor, CRF). These, in turn, activate the anterior pituitary to produce adrenocorticotropin releasing hormone (ACTH), which causes the adrenal cortex to produce corticosteroids (cortisol, in humans). Corticosteroids, in turn, act broadly and relatively slowly to mobilize the body’s energy resources. In the resistance stage of the GAS, the organism’s biological responses to the stressor achieve a steady state and overt symptoms of stress often are reduced or disappear. Eventually, however, the organism enters the third stage of the GAS, which Selye called exhaustion. If a stressor continues and physiological defenses are depleted, then the organism’s symptoms reappear during the exhaustion stage. If there is no relief, death follows.\n\nSelye adopted the term “stress” to describe this overall phenomenon and re-defined it to mean “that which stimulates the GAS response” (Selye, 1956, p. 54). He tested the universality of all three stages of the GAS across a very broad range of severe stressors (e.g., physical trauma, burns, heat, cold, electroshock, infection) and suggested these stressors shared the common trait of being noxious (Selye, 1950). His writing included discussion of a hypothetical neural or endocrine “common mediator” that lies between application of the noxious stressor and the GAS response (Selye, 1950, p. 105). This unknown “common mediator” would serve to receive and integrate local inputs and then transmit generalized messages to all parts of the body to activate the GAS response, including facilitating changes in regulatory (i.e., homeostatic) set-points during the stage of resistance (e.g., Selye, 1950, 1956).\n\nAlthough Selye’s research drew into question the stability of the internal milieu (Bernard, 1878; Cannon, 1932), his work retained many of the omissions inherent in the original conceptualization of homeostasis, including inattention to the significance of psychological state, information processing, life history, and environmental context beyond the specific stressor (Mason, 1975b; Burchfield, Woods, & Elich, 1980; Toates, 1995). Importantly, he also never identified the “common mediator” that facilitated changes in homeostatic set-points in response to the environment. This removed consideration of many of the central questions of the social sciences from biological models of the stress process and foreshadowed the divergence of stress research in the social and life sciences over subsequent decades.\n\nDiverging from Cannon and Selye\n\nSelye’s claims for the scope of application of the GAS were sweeping (e.g., Selye, 1956) and his work was highly provocative. It prompted thousands of articles across the fields of medicine, biology, psychology, and sociology (Goldstein, 1995b; Mason, 1975b). Initially, and with Selye’s encouragement (e.g., Selye, 1956), early stress researchers across many domains invoked Selye’s concept of the nonspecificity of stressors to justify application of the GAS to the entire range of systemic (e.g., heat, cold, infection, hemorrhage) and psychosocial stressors (both positive and negative, e.g., the Schedule of Recent Experiences; Hawkins, Davies, & Holmes, 1957). The psychosocial stress literature of this era demonstrated a reliable association between life events and both psychological distress and medical disorder (Turner & Wheaton, 1995). This research, in turn, engendered an increasing amount of critical commentary pointing out that the size of these associations was persistently small (e.g., Thoits, 1983). It was noted that more explicit measurement of the chronicity, as well as the level of change or threat posed by a given stressor often improved the amount of variance explained in the outcomes, (e.g., Brown & Harris, 1978; Dohrenwend, Ashkenasy, Krasnoff, & Dohrenwend, 1978; Holmes & Rahe, 1967; Pearlin & Schooler, 1978; Wheaton, 1999b) and it became clear that changes in environmental context over time made significant independent contributions to the outcomes of stressor exposure (e.g., Baltes & Baltes, 1990; Furstenberg, Brooks-Gunn, & Morgan, 1987; Hobfoll, Johnson, Ennis, & Jackson, 2003), Holahan, Moos, Holahan, & Cronkite, 1999; Lazarus, 1993a; 1999; Masten et al., 1988; Rutter, 1979; Sameroff, Seifer, Barocas, Zax, & Greenspan, 1987). Importantly, individual differences in cognitive and emotional responses to both stressor and context were found to be key factors in determining outcomes (e.g., anticipation, appraisal, coping, learning, and other types of information processing: Foa & Kozak, 1986; Lazarus, 1991; Hobfoll, 1989; Holahan, Moos, Holahan, & Cronkite, 2000; Ironson et al., 2000; Siegal & Allan, 1998; Sterling & Eyer, 1988; Stone, 1995; Toates, 1995; Tolin & Foa, 2002; Wheaton, 1985). Thus, within the social sciences, the historical process of improving the power of psychosocial factors in predicting health outcomes has been one of more carefully specifying the accumulating negative impact of different stressors within a changing environmental context, combined with acknowledgment of individual differences in response and adaptation over the lifecourse (e.g., Baum, Garofalo, & Yali, 1999; House et al., 1992; Singer & Ryff, 1999). Taken together, this body of work has stretched the psychosocial requirements for models of the stress process well beyond the classical homeostatic perspective or the GAS.\n\nParallel streams of discovery\n\nWithin biomedical research, observations of the influence of the brain and the environment on the stress response process were also prompting reconsideration of classical homeostasis (for a review, see Schulkin, 2003) and Selye’s GAS (Mason, 1971, 1975b; Pacak & Palkovits, 2001). Mason (1971, 1975a) documented substantial variation in elements of the GAS response as a function of the situation, the individual, and the individual’s history, thus raising questions about the specificity of the “nonspecific” GAS response (also see Pacak & Palkovits, 2001). He also discovered that whenever it was possible to substantially reduce or remove the noxious “psychological concomitants” of the stressor, then there was no GAS response (Mason, 1971, 1975a, p. 326); “The knowledge that the psyche is superimposed upon the humoral machinery for endocrine regulation drastically complicates our whole view …” (Mason, 1975a, p. 177). Thus, the biomedical stream of stress research also found itself in need of a model that included appraisal, cognition, and emotional state as primary elements of the stress process (Frankenhaeuer, 1979; Moore-Ede, 1986; Weinberg & Levine, 1979).\n\nThis work set the stage for Sterling and Eyer’s (1988) presentation of allostasis, which proposed that the central nervous system (CNS) exerts control over all physiological regulatory responses to environmental demand in the alert, intact organism. They argued that control of the stress response by the CNS allows the regulatory set-points of the organism to vary in response to environmental demand (Sterling & Eyer, 1988), thus placing the brain squarely in the role of Selye’s “common mediator” between the environment and physiological response (Selye, 1950). This work went largely unnoticed at the time of its publication. Three years later, Levine and Ursin (1991) proposed that the sensory input from all types of stressors is gated through the brain before affecting any other physiological regulatory response, and that this input is modified by expectation and evaluation. They argued that this is true even of stressors that do not appear overtly “psychological,” such as cold exposure and tissue damage, because novelty, expectation, and efforts to avoid noxious stimuli will all activate brain responses (Levine & Ursin, 1991). Soon after, Chrousos and Gold (1992) and Goldstein (1995a, b) independently proposed a model in which homeostasis “resets” itself in response to stress exposure and Goldstein (1995b, p. 41) argued that “distress invariably resets homeostasis.” Thus, by the end of the 20th century, it was clear that homeostasis required revision to account for the influence of environment and/or CNS influence on physiological regulation.\n\nNone of these modifications of homeostatic theory addressed the accumulating cost of dynamic, ongoing physiological accommodation to environmental challenge over the lifespan. This prompted McEwen and Stellar to introduce the concept of allostatic load (McEwen & Stellar, 1993), the physiological cost of making long-term adaptive shifts across a broad range of systems in order to match internal functioning to environmental demand. With the inclusion of allostatic load as a key element of the theory, allostasis became the most comprehensive account of regulatory accommodation to environmental demands and accumulated physiological cost over time. The adaptation and dissemination of allostatic theory by McEwen and an expanding cohort of colleagues (e.g., McEwen, 1998; McEwen, 2000a; McEwen, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c, McEwen & Seeman, 1999; McEwen & Seeman, 2003; McEwen & Stellar, 1993; Schulkin, Gold, & McEwen, 1998; Schulkin, McEwen, & Gold, 1994; Schulkin, 2003, 2004; Singer, Ryff, & Seeman, 2004) is lending allostasis the status of “a new conceptual framework” for the study of stress (Schulkin et al., 1998, p. 220), with advantages for research in both the social and life sciences.\n\nAllostasis\n\nAdvantages for modeling the stress process\n\nBecause homeostatic responses operate locally, they can be (and typically have been) studied in organs and tissues that have been isolated from the body. Thus, for much of the last century, the biological response of the body to stressors has been viewed as largely independent of the brain. When Sterling and Eyer (1988; see also Sterling & Eyer, 1981; Sterling, 2004) pointed out that homeostatic models do not provide adequate explanation for the internal regulation of an unanesthetized animal that is experiencing a variety of behavioral states in response to an ever-changing environment, they argued that essentially all physiological parameters2 covary with behavioral state and that behavioral state is identified with CNS activity (or “states of the brain”, Schulkin, 2003, p. 12). Thus, the brain has overriding regulatory power that supercedes the local effects of homeostasis in the conscious organism. Sterling and Eyer (1988) note that this is a more complex system of regulation than classical homeostasis but it has several advantages for stress researchers in both the social and life sciences:\n\nAllostasis allows ongoing evaluation of the match between internal resources and external demands.\n\nAllostasis permits the organism to produce physiological adjustments in advance of need through anticipatory arousal.\n\nAllostasis allows the organism to adapt to circumstances over time.\n\nAllostasis predicts the responses of an alert, intact organism existing in a changing ecological framework.\n\nThis is illustrated in the etiology of chronic high blood pressure. Cannon (1920) and Selye (1956) both developed their theories by studying animals that were subjected to varying levels of environmental stressor exposure, resulting in acute or semichronic arousal. In these situations, blood pressure rises during arousal and falls afterwards. Sterling and Eyer (1988) pointed out that neither the classical view of homeostasis nor the general adaptation syndrome (GAS) provides a mechanism by which blood pressure fluctuates markedly throughout the day, nor a mechanism to maintain elevated blood pressure once a stressor is removed (Sterling, 2004). Consistent with an allostatic model, an animal’s blood pressure typically does not fall when faced with arousal over a sustained period (Forsyth, 1969). In short, the system is responding to “anticipated demand” (Sterling, 2004, p. 24), as the aroused brain activates the sympathetic and hormonal systems. These increase cardiac output, blood volume, sodium appetite (and thus sodium intake), and vascular constriction to temporarily raise blood pressure. When arousal becomes chronic, the body adapts by thickening arteriolar smooth muscle and increasing the vascular wall-to-lumen ratio so that they are more effective in maintaining a higher blood pressure (Boulos & Rosenwasser, 2004; Sterling, 2004). For such individuals, even under conditions of maximum relaxation, blood pressure does not decrease to the previous low point. This is because blood pressure is maintained by vascular resistance such that a higher blood pressure is needed to maintain the same blood flow (Boulos & Rosenwasser, 2004; Folkow & Neil, 1971; Lund-Johanson, 1984). The vascular system, under the direction of the aroused brain, has adjusted its parameters to meet the demands of the chronically stressful environment. This is an adaptation that is rarely reversed, even when the chronic stressor is removed (probably because of hormones that feed back to the brain to maintain this efficiently-responding system: Sterling, 2004).\n\nThus, when a physiological system is activated by a current stressor, it accommodates by adjusting its parameters within a range of functioning (allostatic accommodation). “Different circumstances demand different homeostatic set points” (Sapolsky, 1998, p. 7). These changes will have cascading effects in other systems, producing organism-wide accommodation to the environment. Thus, in response to a stressor, the organism is not struggling to get its homeostatic systems back into their initial balance. Instead, it is making wide-ranging physiological changes in order to find a new homeostasis that better fits the circumstances (McEwen, 1998). By identifying the brain as the central mediator of allostatic accommodation to a stressor, Sterling and Eyer’s (1988) theory of allostasis accounts for the effects of anticipatory arousal, appraisal, coping, learning, and memory on physiological regulation under adversity and subsequent effects on health.\n\nNotably, under conditions of repeated or chronic stress, this system-wide accommodation can combine with the physiological tendency for the body to create “fixed automatisms” (Sterling & Eyer, 1988, p. 641) and cause the lasting cardiovascular alterations associated with high blood pressure, as well as a range of other possible changes, such as alterations in the concentration and receptor densities of key hormones (e.g., Blanchard, McKittrick, & Blanchard, 2001; Yehuda, 1997) or irreversible activation and/or downregulation of the transcription of specific genes (e.g., Levine, 2001; Valentino & Van Bockstaele, 2004). Implicit in this analysis is the notion that allostatic accommodation over time also results in“wear and tear” in the very systems that are experiencing adaptation to meet the environmental challenge (McEwen, 1998).\n\nAllostatic load: The impact of prior stressors\n\nRutter has referred to the effects of prior stressors as the “long-term carry-forward of the sequelae of stress and adversity” (Rutter, 1994, p. 373) and argued that they must be accounted for in any formulation of the stress process. In allostasis, the new balance of system parameters that follows stressor exposure comes at a physiological cost that McEwen and Stellar (1993) have called allostatic load. This cost can occur through the adoption of Sterling and Eyer’s “fixed automatisms” (1988. p. 641), i.e., those small and large physiological changes that do not revert to the way they were when the challenge has passed. Such changes may be helpful in the short term (as with the increases in blood pressure discussed above) but may have negative long-term consequences for the organism (e.g., increased wear-and-tear on the heart). This cost can also come through damage due to overproduction of the neurochemicals involved in the stress response, some of which are toxic. For example, persistent high concentrations of cortisol can cause damage to regions of the hippocampus (e.g., Bremner et al., 1995; Gurvits et al., 1996; Sapolsky, 1984; Sapolsky et al., 1986; Uno, Tarara, Else, Suleman, & Sapolsky, 1989) and inhibit neurogenesis in this region (Gould, McEwen, Tanapat, Galea, & Fuchs, 1997), both of which potentially interfere with cognition and future adaptation to stressors. Allostatic load can also occur through exhaustion of stress response systems, as can occur in the immune system. This can result in compromised immunocompetence, which is related to higher levels of infection and vulnerability to cancer (Cohen, Tyrrell, & Smith, 1991; Sapolsky, 1998; Sapolsky & Donnelly, 1985). Increased load can also come through the inability to activate a particular stress response system, in which case other stress responses over-respond (McEwen, 1998).\n\nAllostatic load can be negligible, resulting in a symptom-free organism that is well adapted to living with a particular stressor. This is analogous to remaining within the “elastic limit” of the human material in the “engineering” model of stress described by Cannon (1935). Human resilience under duress (e.g., Freitas & Downey, 1998; Garmezy, 1996; Glantz & Sloboda, 1999; Kaplan, 1999; Rutter, 1990) may be seen as resistance to the acquisition of allostatic load, which may help concretize this important but elusive concept (Glantz & Sloboda, 1999; Tarter & Vanyukov, 1999). Load can accumulate from daily low levels of stress in the environment as well as from discrete life events, as observed in the effects of social hierarchies on physical health in nonhuman primates (e.g., Kaplan, Adams, Anthony, Morgan, Manuck & Clarkson, 1995; Kaplan, Manuck, Clarkson, Lusso, & Taub, 1982; Kaplan, Manuck, Clarkson, Lusso, Taub, & Miller, 1983; Manuck, Marsland, Kaplan, & Williams, 1995) and humans (e.g., the Whitehall studies: Marmot, Shipley & Rose, 1984; Marmot, Kogevinas & Elston, 1987; Marmot, 1994). On the other end of the stressor spectrum, allostatic load can be massive enough to produce symptoms that are severe, or even fatal, as in Selye’s “exhaustion” phase (Selye, 1956). The concepts of allostasis and allostatic load allow for dynamic change in the adaptive capacity of the organism and they highlight individual differences in ability to withstand stressors (which can be related to Antonovsky’s [1974] early concept of “homeostatic flexibility”). By defining this accumulating cost of physiological adaptation and outlining some of the biomarkers by which it might be identified, McEwen and Stellar (1993) provided a conceptual framework to explain the accumulated effects of prior experience on physical and mental health (e.g., Boulos & Rosenwasser, 2004; Heim et al, 2000; Levine, 2001; Mason, 1971, 1975a; Resnick, Yehuda, Pitman, & Foy, 1995).\n\nImplications for an integrative model\n\nIn sum, history suggests that the coherent integration of social and biological approaches to stress research has been hampered by the traditional biological representations of the stress process. In particular, many of the fundamental findings of psychosocial stress research have been incongruent with the classical biological paradigm of homeostasis, which has been the dominant model of physiological regulation for the past 100 years (Schulkin, 2003). The classical view of homeostasis maintains that the physiological parameters of the body have an ideal set-point under the control of local biological mechanisms (Cannon, 1932), i.e., these parameters can and will return to equilibrium after perturbation without the need for a central mediator. Classical homeostasis does not easily reconcile with the observation that most of these physiological set points vary as a function of environmental context and psychological state (Sterling & Eyer, 1981, 1988, Sterling, 2004), resulting, for example, in the social stratification of incidence of chronic disease (House et al., 1992). Nor does homeostasis explain why increased social support ameliorates this risk (Seeman, Singer, Ryff, Love, & Levy-Storms, 2002; Singer & Ryff, 1999). Homeostasis alone does not account for the mitigating and exacerbating effects of emotional regulation, anticipation, appraisal, learning, and other types of information processing on the biological response to threat (Siegal & Allan, 1998; Sterling & Eyer, 1988: see also Lazarus, 1991; Hobfoll, 1989; Holahan, Moos, Holahan, & Cronkite, 2000; Ironson et al., 2000; Toates, 1995; Tolin & Foa, 2002; Schulkin, 2003). In addition, the classical view of homeostasis does not square with empirical evidence indicating that the stress response itself is not static: rather, it changes over time as a function of the life history of the individual (Levine, 2001; Liu et al., 1997; Mason, 1975a; McEwen & Stellar, 1993).\n\nAlthough there has been recognition that the classical homeostatic perspective presents problems in a number of scientific domains (for reviews, see Schulkin, 2003; 2004), these issues have been especially pressing for social scientists. Social scientists typically study organisms that are intact, alert, and functioning in a changing ecological framework (as opposed to being observed dismantled and in vitro). Under these circumstances, the brain itself exerts executive control over local regulatory systems (Sterling & Eyer, 1988; Sterling, 2004), as we will discuss in detail below. With the central nervous system in charge, physiological system parameters do not necessarily return to their pre-perturbation state; instead, they co-vary with behavioral state to re-establishing new set-points that are better suited to challenges presented by the environment (McEwen, 1998; 2000a; 2003a and c, 2004; Sapolsky, 1998; Schulkin, McEwen, & Gold, 1994; Sterling & Eyer, 1988). This CNS-driven, continuous adjustment to ongoing environmental challenge is the keystone of our approach to modeling the current stress process.\n\nAllostasis and the Brain\n\nOverview\n\nIt is at this point that we transition from a review to a new synthesis of the emerging literature on the human neuroscience of the stress response and psychosocial perspectives on the context of stressors. To do so, we will review the relevant neural systems and present an integrative model of the stress process that incorporates current research in human neuroscience with key elements of stress models from the social and life sciences (see Cohen et al., 1995, for a review of the distinctions between the two). The concepts of allostasis and allostatic load allow this integration. The model itself constitutes the framework of our proposed bridge between the traditions of stress research in the social and life sciences. As discussed, the keystone of this model is identification of the brain as the primary mediator of allostasis, i.e., the primary point of interface between a given stressor in its physical and social context, and an individual’s physiological and behavioral accommodation to that stressor. We will emphasize here that the core emotional regions of the brain constitute the primary regulators of allostatic accommodation, to which all other physiological and behavioral accommodation is secondary. This follows from the recognition of these neural systems as the main organizing factor in the translation of environmental stimulus into behavioral and/or physiological response (e.g., LeDoux, 1996; Ohman & Mineka, 2001; Rosen & Schulkin, 1998). Identification of the neural foci of allostatic regulation is important because these will be the first and primary sites of physiological adaptation in the face of adversity, as well as the areas mostly likely to show evidence of allostatic load. Accrual of allostatic load in the brain will have consequences for psychosocial adaptation and health; identification of the specific circuitry that is most vulnerable to the acquisition of load will allow better understanding of the physiological and behavioral consequences of environmental adversity in humans, which will, in turn, allow more precision in intervention strategies to aid populations at risk. Thus, identification of the neural processes underlying the central regulation of allostasis (and the central acquisition of load) is our first step in bridging stress models in the social and life sciences.\n\nEmotions and the brain\n\nEmotions are central motivational states of the brain that underlie human behavioral adaptation to the environment (LeDoux, 1996; Ohman & Mineka, 2001; Panksepp & Miller, 1996; Rosen & Schulkin, 1998; Schulkin, 2003). The weight of current experimental evidence across multiple species suggests that control of emotional processing lies in the central nervous system. Further, this control is primarily localized within a limited number of brain regions that function together as a neural circuit or set of interconnected circuits (see below; e.g., Davidson et al., 2000; Gregg & Siegel, 2001; Ishai. Pessoa, Bilkle, & Ungerleider, 2004; LeDoux, 1995; LeDoux, 1996; Ohman & Mineka, 2001, Panksepp, 1998; Sanchez et al., 2001). The processing of emotional stimuli is regulated by neurotransmitters and neurohormones within this system, which in turn underlies emotion-related behavioral states and physiological response in systems external to the CNS (for reviews, see Gunnar & Quevedo, 2007; Schulkin, 2003; Salamone & Correa, 2002). These core emotional regions of the brain are highly interconnected with other neural systems that underlie perception, cognition, bodily representation, homeostasis, and behavior (see Pessoa, 2008, for a review); they serve as hubs in the processing of stimuli that have threat or reward value, which we will call emotional stimuli.\n\nTwo key areas in the neural systems associated with the processing of emotional stimuli are the amygdala and basal ganglia, both of which are highly evolved (Barton & Aggleton, 2000; Gerfen, 1992) structures or sets of structures near the base of the brain, below the neocortex. Meta-analyses indicate that these structures play a consistent (Murphy, Nimmo-Smith, & Lawrence, 2003; Phan, Wager, Taylor, & Lieberzon, 2002) and central (Wager, Phan, Lieberzon, & Taylor, 2003) role in the functional neuroanatomy of emotion in humans. This is supported by research with animal and humans, which also identifies the involvement of the extended amygdala3, hypothalamus, and a small number of medullary and brainstem nuclei as central to the processing of emotional stimuli (Armony & LeDoux, 1997; Koob, 2003; LeDoux, 1996; Panksepp, 1998).\n\nThe coordinated activity in these brain regions is seen in the interplay of the basic “approach” and “avoidance” mechanisms of the brain. In general, the basal ganglia (in particular, the nucleus accumbens) are associated with approach behavior, motivation, and positive incentive (e.g., Galvan et al., 2006; Haber, Kim, Mailly, & Calzavara, 2006), as well as playing important roles in motor and cognitive control (Casey, Tottenham, & Fossella, 2002). In contrast, the amygdala and extended amygdala are generally associated with fearful, anxious, and avoidance-related behavior (e.g., Davis, Walker, & Lee, 1997; LeDoux, 1996; Phelps, 2004, 2006). Yet these regions are highly interrelated. For example, the current reward value of a stimulus is encoded in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (Gottfried, O’Doherty, & Dolan, 2003); conversely, the amygdala modulates the incentive values of rewards by controlling the amount of dopamine available to key regions in the basal ganglia (Phillips, Ahn, & Howland, 2003).\n\nThese regions are also highly interconnected with nearby brain areas that provide more complex representations of emotional stimuli and regulation and evaluation of emotional response (Bremner & Vermetten, 2001; Kaufman & Charney, 2001; Sanchez et al., 2001; also see supporting human neurimaging data, e.g., Dolcos, LeBar, & Cabeza, 2004; Kim et al., 2004; Wager et al., 2003; Wickers et al., 2003; Urry et al., 2006). The medial and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, located along the central and lower midline of the prefrontal cortex, are implicated in the representation and evaluation of the potential personal impact of a given stimulus. For example, functional imaging studies have found ventromedial (Phan et al., 2004) and medial (Lane, Fink, Chau, & Dolan, 1997; Phan et al., 2004) prefrontal cortex activation in response to tasks involving appraisal of the self-relatedness of emotional images; patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex are observed to have difficulty generating an emotional response when recalling emotion-laden past experiences (e.g., death of a loved one: Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio, 2003). Interior to the medial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex is the affective subdivision of the anterior cingulate cortex, which is implicated in the regulation of emotional response (for a meta-analysis, see Bush, Liu, & Posner, 2000). This is closely connected with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and hippocampus, as well as with the amygdala and the basal ganglia (Bush et al., 2000). The hippocampus, located adjacent to the amygdala, provides both representation of the context of an emotional stimulus (Phillips & LeDoux, 1992) and explicit knowledge of the pairing between a negative stimulus and an unconditioned one (Bechara et al., 1995), and serves a key role in the regulation of the HPA-axis (Sapolsky et al., 2000). Together, these brain regions form an interconnected neural circuit or set of circuits (often referred to as the limbic system, but see LeDoux, 1996, pp. 98–102) that serves to represent, regulate, and process emotional stimuli, with a widening array of neocortical areas being recruited with increasing task demand and complexity. The high level of structural and functional connectivity between these regions of the brain and the rest of the cortex allows these core emotional areas to function as hubs for recruiting and integrating a wide range of the brain’s computational resources in the processing of emotional stimuli (Pessoa, 2008; Stephan et al., 2000). Such stimuli effectively engage attention and are prioritized in the competition for processing resources in the brain (e.g., Anderson, 2005; Ohman, Flykt, & Esteves, 2001; Vuilleumier, Armony, Driver, & Dolan, 2001). This provides emotional stimuli with a “privileged status”4 in the brain (Davidson, Maxwell, & Shackman, 2004) and gives the core emotional regions of the brain a crucial role in allostasis.\n\nThe larger context\n\nIn humans, understanding of the functional role of the core emotional regions of the brain is derived from both neuroimaging data (which provide a correlation between a stimulus and brain activation in a given region) and from brain lesion studies in neurology patients (which confirm that a given region is critical for the neural processing of that type of stimulus). The weight of evidence from these studies, combined with data from studies of animals, indicates that the brain mediates human physiological and behavioral response to challenge (Phelps. 2006; Rosen & Schulkin, 2004). Thus, study of the relevant neural systems is informative to the study of the stress process. However, arguing that the core emotional regions of the brain are the primary mediators in the stress process does not imply that any aspect of CNS activity, or of biology in general, provide all of the information needed to understand the stress process. This is because the sources of input into this system are both external and internal to the individual; for example, the context and the nature of the stressor are often socially determined, so that psychosocial approaches are also critical to understanding the stress process.\n\nModeling allostasis\n\nWithin psychosocial models of stress, important factors include emotion, cognition, attention, appraisal, and coping (see, for example, Bolger, 1990; Cohen et al., 1995; Lazarus, 1993b; Scherer, 1993; Zautra, 2003). To more fully integrate biological views of the stress process with psychosocial perspectives, we will discuss current work on the neural mechanisms underlying these key processes in humans. Locating these processes in the brain allows us to link external influences with physical and mental health outcomes. This, in turn, allows us to construct an allostatic model of the stress process in terms of these psychosocial factors and as part of physiological accommodation to a current stressor.\n\nThe current stressor\n\nIn the expanding research utilizing allostasis as a working model of the relationship between environmental challenge and physiological outcomes, the focus has been on the past acquisition of allostatic load (Singer, Ryff, & Seeman, 2004). These assessments have relied on cumulative physiological measures across a range of stress-reactive systems that are peripheral to the CNS (McEwen & Seeman, 1999). While important, such assessments do not require specification of how allostasis works on a stressor-by-stressor basis. The model presented in this paper focuses on the allostatic response to a current stressor, with the brain as primary mediator of this process. As such, it requires a higher level of specificity about the underlying mechanisms of allostasis.\n\nThe most basic model of allostatic accommodation to a current stressor ( ) is presented as a traditional psychosocial stressor → stress response → distress model of the stress process, with the exception that the biological aspects of the process are presented in terms of allostatic accommodation to a current stressor (the solid gray line represents the perimeter of the body, within which all processes are biological). Allostatic response and adaptation to a current stressor is a two-stage process, including what we term central allostatic accommodation and peripheral allostatic accommodation. Allostatic accommodation encompasses not only the state of being in “homeostatic imbalance” (Sapolksy, 2004) but also the process of either bringing the system back to its original equilibrium or finding a new one (adaptive plasticity). In this model, adaptive plasticity is an inherent component of allostatic accommodation because under allostasis, immediate response to a current stressor (e.g., alarm) and adaptation to that stressor are merged (e.g., the brain predicts the need for more oxygen and resets blood pressure on a moment to moment basis: Sterling, 2004). To summarize, in this basic form of the model, the stressor is the current environmental challenge and stress response refers to the perturbation and reestablishment of physiological equilibrium following this challenge (which may include the re-setting of physiological parameters under allostasis). Distress is operationalized here as mental health and/or physical health outcomes.\n\nCentral Allostatic Accommodation\n\nPerception of the stressor\n\nAn external threat affects the individual through the portals of the sensory systems, which send information to the amygdala (e.g., Armony & LeDoux, 1997; Bremner & Vermetten, 2001; Charney et al., 1998; Kaufman & Charney, 2001). The amygdala, in turn, has reciprocal connections to the perceptual systems (Amaral, Behniea, & Kelly, 2003; Freese & Amaral, 2005; Vuilleumier, 2005) and down into the brainstem (e.g., to the locus coeruleus, the raphe nuclei, and the medullary norepinephrine-producing nuclei: Kaufman & Charney, 2001; Van Bockstaele, Bajic, Proudfit, & Valentino, 2001). This, in turn, facilitates heightened perceptual processing of threatening stimuli in the environment and may supply emotional and motivational significance to stimuli (e.g., Berntson, Bechara, Damasio, Tranel, & Cacioppo, 2007; Vuilleumier, Richardson, Armony, Driver, & Dolan, 2004; Vuilleumier & Driver, 2007; see also Cacioppo & Gardner, 1999, regarding increased sensitivity to negative information).\n\nCentral emotional processing of environmental threat\n\nIn discussing central emotional processing of stressful stimuli, we focus here on fear-provoking or threatening environmental stimuli. Notably, the model applies equally well to other types of stressors (e.g., remembered or imagined threats or stressors), which are addressed peripherally in this paper, as appropriate. Key neural areas in the processing of negative emotional stimuli (e.g., fear-provoking, stressful, or threatening stimuli) include many of the areas previously discussed, including the amygdala, extended amygdala, hippocampus, and areas of the prefrontal cortex, of which the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex play particularly salient roles (Bremner & Vermetten, 2001; Davidson, 2003; Kaufman & Charney, 2001; LeDoux, 1995; LeDoux, 1996; Rosen & Schulkin, 1998: Schulkin, 2003). This neural circuit has been called a “general-purpose defense response control network” (LeDoux, 1996, p. 158). Electrical stimulation of various elements of this circuit elicits behavioral response to threat, the most basic of which are fear-related behaviors (LeDoux, 1996; Panksepp, 1998). Key aspects of fearful and anxious behavior in animals can be eliminated by blocking the activity of various elements of this circuit chemically, by lesion, or by genetic manipulation (e.g., Bordi & LeDoux, 1994; Davis, Walker, & Lee, 1997; LeDoux, Cicchetti, Xagoraris, & Romanski, 1990; Muller et al., 2004). As previously discussed, these brain areas not only perform important functions in themselves but also integrate and regulate the flow of information across multiple brain regions in the perception, processing, and production of behavior in response to environmental threat.\n\nAs an example, an intact amygdala appears to be required for normal emotional arousal in response to negative stimuli, although individuals with amygdala damage appear to be able to perceive and recognize the negative emotional valence of a stimulus (Berntson, Bechara, Damasio, Tranel & Cacioppo, 2007; Glascher & Adolphs, 2003). In addition, the amygdala is required for the acquisition of normal fear conditioning (Bechara et al., 1995). It has been found to be critical to virtually every physiological expression of fear conditioning in animals (planned and reflexive behavior, autonomic responses, stress hormone release: Kapp, Whalen, Supple, & Pascoe, 1992; Davis, 1992; LeDoux, 1993), with evidence for most of these effects in humans (Bechara et al, 1995; Buchel, Morris, Dolan, Friston, 1998; LaBar et al., 1998). The latter is true even for fears that are acquired by social means. Human or nonhuman primates can learn fear vicariously (by social observation: Ohman & Mineka, 2001) and humans have the added advantage of being able to learn fear through instruction (Hugdahl & Ohman, 1977). The amygdala appears to be key in the physiological expression of both of these types of social fear learning (Funayama, Grillon, Davis, & Phelps, 2001; Phelps et al., 2001; Phelps, 2006). The amygdala, however, does not do this work alone nor is this the sum total of its functions. The core emotional systems of the brain work in interaction with the complex representation of sensory stimuli, i.e., cognition (attention, memory, planning, problem solving, language) to generate behavioral response.\n\nPeripheral Allostatic Accommodation\n\nAllostasis as a two-stage process\n\nWhen Sterling and Eyer (1988) proposed the concept of allostasis, understanding of the relevant brain circuitry was in its infancy, even in animal models (LeDoux, 1996) and the neuroimaging techniques that have enabled much of the current research in human neuroscience were not yet available. Research with humans and animals since that time has provided substantial evidence that the core emotional regions of the brain organize the physiological stress responses in the systems peripheral to the CNS (e.g., Pacak & Palkovits, 2001; Stratakis & Chrousos, 1995). Thus, it has been argued (Panksepp, 1998) that this emotional circuitry serves both executive and command functions in an organism’s interaction with its environment. It is executive in that it has the “superordinate role” in the dynamic sequelae of neurobiological and hormonal responses that begin with the sensing of an emotional stimulus and end with the production of behavior (Panksepp, 1998). This core emotion circuitry also serves a command function in that it initiates specific physiological and behavioral processes (Panksepp, 1998). If the core emotional circuits of the brain exert command and executive control over the organization of behavioral and physiological accommodation to environmental demands, as this research suggests, then it follows that these neural circuits are the primary mediators of the stress process.5 Thus, the allostatic response to an environmental stressor is a two-stage process in which the core emotional regions of the brain have the primary regulatory role (central allostatic accommodation) and in which accommodation in systems peripheral to the CNS is secondary (peripheral allostatic accommodation),\n\nPeripheral accommodation\n\nThe central allostatic response to threat drives the stress response in physiological systems peripheral to the CNS. It is difficult to overstate the scope of these responses. Threat-related limbic activation of both the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system produces glucocorticoids (cortisol, in humans) and catecholamines (e.g., epinepherine and norepinepherine: e.g., Gray, 1999; Feldman, Conforti, Itsik, & Weidenfeld, 1995; Muller et al., 2004; Pacak & Palkovits, 2001; Schulkin, 2003). In particular, cortisol and epinephrine, the primary products of the adrenal glands, have profound preparative and modulating effects on most of these systems (Sapolsky, Romero, & Munck, 2000) and are arguably the principal physiological mediators of peripheral allostatic accommodation (for a review, see McEwen, 2007). For example, they work together to produce the classic inverted U-shaped response to increasing stressor exposure within the peripheral immune system. An absence of normal glucocorticoid production results in inmpaired immunity (Kannan, 2004) but the moderate levels of cortisol and catecholamines that are generated in the early phases of the stress response work together to enhance immune function (Bierhaus et al, 2003). Out at the far end of the U-shaped curve, under conditions of extreme stress, the combined actions of high levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinepherine inhibit the activity of the peripheral immune system (for a review, see Sorrells & Sapolsky, 2007). This process is also regulated in important ways by the parasympathetic nervous system, which acts to counter sympathetic response and generally decreases immune/inflammatory responses (Sloan, McCreath, Tracey, Sidney, Liu, & Seeman, 2007; Borovikova et al., 2000). This is an example of mutuality in the regulation of allostatic systems, where each component acts to modify and compensate for the others (McEwen, 2007), resulting in the observed nonlinearities in allostatic accommodation to stressor exposure (e.g., the inverted U-shaped curve).\n\nExtremes of stressor exposure can also profoundly inhibit the reproductive system (via direct suppression of production and uptake of sex hormones at all levels within the reproductive axis), growth (via suppression of growth hormone and growth factor effects at multiple points in the growth axis), thyroid function (via suppressed secretion and/or conversion of key thyroid hormones), as well as altering metabolism (e.g., increases in production of glucose), cardiovascular activity (e.g., increased blood pressure), and gastrointestinal function (Davis, Walker, & Lee, 1997; Heinrichs, Mensaghi, Pich, Britton, & Koob, 1995; Maier & Watkins, 1998a; Stratakis & Chrousos, 1995). These peripheral systems not only have regulatory effects upon themselves and one another (illustrated by cortisol’s negative feedback effects upon the HPA axis: Sapolsky, 1998), but they can also have important bottom-up effects on central allostasis (e.g., Davidson, 2003). For example, in animal models, increases in cortisol enhance CRH gene expression in the amygdala and extended amygdala, which appears to be the causal mechanism behind the finding that cortisol affects fear conditioning (Schulkin, 2003). Cortisol also has a variety of other central nervous system effects, including modulating glucose utilization in the brain and either enhancing or disrupting memory formation, depending on the duration of stressor exposure (e.g. Sapolsky et al., 2000). Abnormalities in glucose regulation, in turn, may damage the hippocampus and produce memory deficits (Convit, Wolf, Tarshish, & deLeon, 2003; Gold et al., 2006), particularly in interaction with stress-related increases in circulating cortisol (Margarinos & Mc Ewen, 2000. Likewise, immune-cell derived cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier to directly stimulate the central nervous system, modulating both HPA axis and sympathetic activation (Kannan, 2004). This bi-directional process is indicated by the two-way arrow between central and peripheral allostatic accommodation in .\n\nThe physiological association between the central and peripheral components of the physiological response to a current stressor has been well-explored in animal models. Based on this research, increased activity in the core emotional regions of the brain (e.g., the amygdala and extended amygdala) is often modeled as driving increases in HPA axis activity, which in turn has inhibitory feedback on the amygdala via the hippocampus (e.g., Gunnar & Quevedo, 2007). However, there have been remarkably few studies of the relationship between brain function and the peripheral stress response (e.g., HPA axis function) in healthy human samples (individuals without clinical disorder). The healthy human brain is of particular interest in this paper because this is where the basic mechanisms of allostasis will be the least confounded with disease processes.\n\nFear, social threat, and the human HPA axis\n\nOf the studies that have examined the role of the healthy human brain in the relationship between stressor exposure and cortisol production, most have relied on paradigms involving social stressors. Specifically, they employed stimuli that engender feelings of perceived social rejection (Eisenberger, Taylor, Gable, Hilmert, & Lieberman, 2007) or the threat of social rejection (harassment and negative feedback on the performance of a difficult task, e.g., difficult mental arithmetic: Pruessner et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2005), which are the most effective ways to engender cortisol responses in human subjects in the laboratory (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). Increases in cortisol levels associated with social stressor exposure have been associated with increased cerebral blood flow in the right ventral prefrontal cortex (Wang et al., 2005) and, in an analysis involving comparisons across different social stressor paradigms, with increased activation in a wider range of cortical regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and posterior parietal cortex: Eisenberger et al., 2007). More surprisingly, social anxiety has also been associated with significant and widespread deactivations in several core emotional regions of the brain including amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, dorsal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and anterior cingulate (Pruessner et al., 2008). Counterintuitively, these deactivations are the most profound in those individuals who showed the greatest HPA axis reactivity to social threat, with a strong inverse association between hippocampal activation and cortisol levels in response to social threat. Although counter to standard models of the association between limbic activity and HPA axis function, this study used convergent data from positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with substantial sample sizes and is therefore difficult to dismiss. This example demonstrates how combining standard social psychological paradigms with neuroscience research expands theoretical models on the stress process.\n\nInterestingly, none of the above studies found that exposure to social threat increased amygdala response (see also Eisenberger Lieberman, & Williams, 2003). To our knowledge, the only imaging studies to date that have found a positive correlation between cortisol production and amygdala activation in healthy humans did not use social threat paradigms, but instead used standardized stimuli typically associated with the production of fear (Urry et al., 2006; van Stegeren et al., 2007). This is consistent with a substantial body of neuroimaging work indicating that fear paradigms are reliably associated with increases in amygdala activation (e.g., Buchel et al., 1998; LaBar et al., 1998; Whalen et al., 1998). In light of this disparity, it has been argued that there may be qualitative physiological differences between the neural processing of fear as compared to social anxiety (Pruessner et al., 2008). This is consistent with data suggesting that neurotrophins (a family of proteins that mediate CNS and peripheral nervous system structural change) respond differently to social stress as opposed to physical threat, producing significant differences in the regulation of homeostasis under these two types of stress conditions (Alleva & Santucci, 2001). This, in turn, suggests differences in the physiological processes underlying central and peripheral allostasis over time in response to these different types of environmental challenge, with implications for health and behavior. Resolution of these fundamental questions must, by their very nature, be addressed at the interface between the social and life sciences, with important implications for both fields. It also highlights the importance of clarifying the nature and context of the stressors themselves.\n\nThe Stress Process in Context\n\nSources of input\n\nConsistent with theory and biological observation, we specify two separate sources of input to the basic allostatic model, (1) context, and (2) the stressor itself (see ). Psychosocial theory distinguishes stressor and context in predictions of stress-related outcomes (for reviews, see Brown & Harris, 1989; Dohrenwend, 1998; Dohrenwend, 2006). Likewise, research on the neural processing of information suggests that the characteristics of the current stressor and the current context of that stressor are processed in separate subcircuits of the emotional circuitry of the brain (e.g., Armony & LeDoux, 1997; Bordi & LeDoux, 1994; LeDoux, 1996).\n\nHaving specified the neural levels of influence that are part of the stress response, we now turn to social science to guide our thinking of the contextual influences on the stress process. In short, our task is now to specify the construct of current context and consider its influence on the current stressor, which in turn influences the relationship between that stressor and sensory processing, allostatic accommodation, and, ultimately, mental and physical health. Consistent with our interest in specifying the multiple ecological levels of influence on physical and health outcomes, we draw from dynamic systems theories in modeling the context of stress as an important source of input into physiological allostasis, while also drawing from psychosocial stress research to consider how to conceptualize the special conditions of contextual risk in this model.\n\nMany of the principles of dynamic systems theories (Waddington, 1957; Sameroff & Chandler, 1975; Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998; 2006; Ford & Lerner, 1992; Thelen & Smith, 1998) are integral to a multilevel approach to understanding behavior and development (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1992). We highlight those principles here and then draw on them throughout the course of our discussion as they affect our conceptual framework. Two principles of dynamic systems theories help us to consider the relations between the levels of a multilevel system. The first is the principle of multiple nested and interacting levels, which states that the person is embedded in an ecological system that represents the influences of the most proximal system (the microsystem) to more distal systems (the macrosystem). The influence of more distal systems on individual development occurs through these nested ecological levels. Moreover, individual behavior is moderated, or shaped, by the context in which that individual is embedded (the notion of interaction across systems). The second of these principles is the transactional relationships between levels of the system, which states that the relations between individuals and their environment, or between proximal and distal contexts, are transactional instead of unidirectional. That is, causality works in both directions. In addition, three principles of dynamic systems theories help us to consider how development plays out across time: The first, multifinality and equifinality, indicates that there are many paths to a single outcome and a single pathways can lead to a diverse set of outcomes. The second, attractor states constrain possible pathways, suggests that development proceeds on a small number of trajectories and is subject to a small number of possible influences, with biological and ecological constraints that limit possible outcomes. The third, continuous and discontinuous change, posits that change can occur through continuous developmental processes as well as through large changes that result from what are often called “threshold effects”.\n\nDynamic systems theory helps us understand the structure of context, how context interacts with other ecological and individual levels, and how contextual effects may play out across time. Researchers working at the nexus of stress and neuroscience expand the understanding of contextual risk in the context of a stress model by including notions of risk as separate from resources (Hobfoll, 1989; Hobfoll, Hall, Canetti-Nisim, Galea, Johnson, & Palmieri, 2007) and by parsing out the key factors in conceptualizing the negative effects of risk status (e.g., social standing; Gianaros, Horenstein, Harir, Sheu, Manuck, Matthews, & Cohen, 2008). The importance of bridging the social and life sciences lies in this kind of greater specificity of influence as to how context can affect outcomes through particular brain processes. We will highlight some of the implications of these theories for the conceptual frame we have begun to build in this section, but will continue to draw on some of the other principles as as we expand the model in later sections of this paper.\n\nFirst, as shown in , we conceptualize contextual risk as including both proximal and distal risk factors. While not shown on the figure for the purpose of efficiency, we do consider them as nested and interacting influences on the stress process. The direct arrow from current context to environmental stressor reflects the recognition that low-resourced environments are likely to result in higher levels of stressor exposure (Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, & Aber, 1997; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000; Earls & Buka, 2000). In some cases, there is feedback (as indicated by the reverse arrow) from stressor to the current social or physical context; this accounts for the selection of individuals into environments and the constraint on opportunities that stressors create in the choice of such contexts.\n\nGiven the interactive nature of this system, we also posit that current risk will moderate, or shape, the effects of environmental stressors on sensory processing. That is, the meaning of the stressor to the individual interacts with information about the physical and social context in which the individual is embedded (e.g., Hobfoll, 2001) to drive perception of the emotional intensity of the stressor and the resulting behavioral response. In short, the extra-individual context matters - the individual is not divorced from their context, but highly influenced by context. Finally, we argue for a distinct role for contextual resources from that of risk, in considering the current context. Not only are risk and resources related (Hobfoll et al., 2007), but together they moderate the link between current stressor and sensory processing.\n\nIn the next section, we discuss two areas in which the most work has been done to understand contextual influences on brain processes. First, a wealth of social science research has linked low income (a key contextual risk factor) and children’s functioning and development. Quite recently, neuroscientists have considered how SES may affect the brain as a means for understanding the neural underpinnings of those relations. We review some of that recent work here. Second, social support (a key contextual resource) has been documented to be an important buffer of negative life circumstance and/or events on mental and physical health. Both of these examples highlight the value of using an integrated model across the life and social sciences to test the influence of context through individual physiological processes, on mental and physical health outcomes.\n\nSES: An example of contextual risk\n\nA wealth of research conducted over the last several decades makes clear that poverty puts children’s development at risk (Haveman & Wolfe, 1994; Duncan & Brooks-Gunn, 1997). Poverty appears to impinge on children’s cognitive growth and academic achievement (Duncan & Brooks-Gunn, 1997), as well as their physical and mental health and behavioral development (Gershoff, Aber, & Raver, 2003). As early as kindergarten, poor children exhibit lower scores on tests of early literacy and math abilities as well as other indices of school readiness (Dahl & Lochner, 2008; Gershoff, 2003; Lee & Burkham, 2002). By adolescence, these children are more likely than their peers to repeat a grade and drop out of school and, as they reach adulthood, are more likely to face challenges in the labor market, contributing to a cycle of intergenerational poverty (Duncan, Yeung, Brooks-Gunn, & Smith, 1998; Duncan, Kalil, & Ziol-Guest, 2008).\n\nAt the same time, there is a very recent body of research examining the neural activity that may underlie the behavioral and health effects observed in the social science literature. Using neuropsychological tests, Farah and colleagues find deficits in language and in long-term memory skills among poor children compared with their more affluent peers (Farah et al., 2006; Noble, McCandliss, & Farah, 2007). Functional neuroimaging evidence suggests that SES moderates the relationship between phonological awareness (a strong predictor of reading achievement) and reading-related brain activity (Noble, Wolmetz, Ochs, Farah, & McCandliss, 2006). Using electrophysiological recordings, Kishiyama and colleagues (Kishiyama, Boyce, Jimenez, Perry, & Knight, 2009) found that prefrontal cortex activity critical for attention was decreased in a small sample of children with low socio-economic status (SES) compared with high SES children. Consistent with the work of Farah and colleagues, this study also found decreased executive function in their low SES sample, including working memory, cognitive flexibility and semantic fluency on tests of neurocognitive function (Kishiyama et al., 2009).\n\nTypically, the discussion in the social science literature on the theoretical background of income’s influence on children’s development has focused to two complementary disciplines within the social sciences. On the one hand, psychological theory has highlighted how low income may have negative effects on children’s development by increasing parental stress and thereby changing the quality of the parent-child relationship (Mcloyd, 1990; McLoyd, Jayartne, Ceballo, & Borquez, 1994). On the other hand, economic theory emphasizes the limited ability of low-income parents to invest in their children’s human capital. Economic theory has emphasized the notion that income can affect the resources that families can provide for their children (Becker, 1981; Coleman, 1988). For example, research has found that the provision of cognitively stimulating home environments differs across poor and nonpoor households, and may account for a sizeable amount of the variance in educational outcomes for children (Duncan & Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Voltruba-Drzal, 2006). In effect, low income children may have poor outcomes because of overstimulation from the environment (e.g., they live under highly stressful conditions) or as a result of understimulating environments (due to low levels of resources), or both. Below we suggest how the bridging of the social and life sciences may help to parse out these distinctions so we can more precisely describe the nature of the relationship between contextual risk factors and outcomes for children.\n\nA key issue in this area of research is whether or not the associations observed between income and outcomes for children represent causal relations (see Mayer, 1997 and Mayer, 2001 for critical reviews). The estimation problem is that virtually all studies of income effects are based on nonexperimental data and susceptible to biases from unmeasured parental characteristics. In short, it is often not clear whether the differences between poor and non-poor children are caused by poverty itself or by the many correlates of poverty, such as low-education and single-parenthood. To address this, a number of studies have tried to assess the causal effect through randomized experiments (Duncan, Morris, & Rodrigues, 2006) or by leveraging what are known as “natural” experiments (i.e., variations in policy changes that may be outside of the control of individuals; Dahl & Lochner, 2008; Milligan & Stabile, 2008). The newest research on the associations between income and neural pathways are no exception—while the results are intriguing, their small samples and correlational designs cannot definitively attribute the low SES effect observed to SES per se, rather than the other correlates of poverty. Thus, an important area for future research is to examine precisely the question of whether income can causally affect neural function, and if so, what interventions are likely to be effective for improving outcomes for low-income children? We return to this point again in the concluding section. By embedding physiological measurement into large-scale intervention studies, we can go a long way toward understanding the malleability within this system and ways through which to alter the stress-health link.\n\nNotably, there is also emerging evidence of neural effects associated with low socioeconomic status in healthy adults. Gianaros and colleagues (Gianaros, Horenstein et al., 2007; Gianaros et al., 2008) focus on a particular aspect of SES—perceived social standing -- and suggested it may be a critical component of SES in considering the context-distress association (perceived social standing may be a better predictor of health than objective SES: Singh-Manoux, Marmot, Adler, 2005). This research finds reduced grey matter in the perigenual area of the anterior cingulate cortex in individuals reporting lower levels of social standing in a healthy community sample (Gianaros et al., 2007), with control for multiple demographic and psychological variables including depression, pessimism, hostility, and negative affect. Notably, this brain region is implicated in emotion regulation and assessment of the salience of emotional stimuli (e.g., Bush, Liu, & Posner, 2000). However, no effects were found on gray matter volume in the hippocampus or amygdala, in contrast to what has been found in other research on the effects of chronic stress (Gianaros, Jennings et al., 2007) and trauma (Ganzel, Kim, Glover, & Temple, 2008) on the morphology of the healthy human brain. This suggests that there are important nuances in the neural impact of these different types of stressor exposure. Furthermore, young adults’ perception of their parents’ social standing during childhood (Gianaros et al., 2008) was found to be related to their amygdala reactivity in response to angry faces. This finding was independent of the subjects’ ranking of their own perceived social standing, anxiety, depression, personality traits, and demographic characteristics. This suggest that there may be long-term neural biomarkers of early social environment on emotional reactivity, which may be part of the neural mechanism underlying the independent effect of childhood SES on adult health (van de Mheen, Stronks, Looman, & Mackenbach, 1998).\n\nSocial support: an example of a contextual resource\n\nSocial support has been documented to be an important buffer of negative life circumstance and/or events on mental and physical health. A number of studies have established the link between social isolation and mortality (House, Landis & Umberson, 1988) and a thorough review of over 80 studies of the link between social support and health finds that social support is related to cardiovascular and immune functioning, with weaker evidence for effects in endocrine systems (Uchino, Cacioppo, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1996). In addition, there has long been a tradition in the literature on social development that highlights the stress-buffering role of social support on parenting, which can mitigate the deleterious effects of poverty on children (Belsky, 1984; Seagull, 1987).\n\nThe brain mechanisms underlying the moderating effects of social support are only beginning to be studied. On the one hand, social support may reduce the initial response to threat, in effect reducing the individuals’ initial perception of a threat and preventing a full stress response (resulting in reduced stress reactivity). On the other hand, social support may moderate the regulatory strategies that an individual employs after a full stress response has already occurred (resulting in increased emotion regulation). Notably, these two dimensions (reactivity and regulation) have been specified as orthogonal dimensions in psychological research in their contribution to behavior (Rothbart & Bates, 2006; Rothbart & Derryberry, 1981).\n\nA functional neuroimaging study examining these two hypothesized mechanisms (Eisenberger, Taylor, Gable, Hilmert & Lieberman, 2007) suggests that brain activation associated with the regulation of emotion does not vary with the level of current social support for the individual. Instead, these data are more consistent with a model in which individual reactivity is reduced in the context of social support. More specifically, using an ecologically valid assessment of community social support, Eisenberger et al. (2007) found that individuals with low levels of ongoing social support were more likely to have high levels of cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test. In this study, neural activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate and nearby prefrontal areas in response to acute social stress statistically mediated the relationship between social support and cortisol response. Eisenberger et al. (2007) argue that the lack of medial and prefrontal cortical involvement (which are usually associated with effortful emotion regulation, e.g., Ochsner et al., 2004) suggests that current social support preemptively moderates stress reactivity, preventing or reducing the initial emotional response rather than down-regulating it after it has already developed. However, the jury is still out on this issue, as there is evidence on the regulatory side as well; a laboratory-based experiment (Coan, Schaefer, & Davidson, 2006) finds that social contact (in the form of hand-holding) regulated the neural response to threat of electric shock in cortical areas that may be more involved in emotion regulation, such the ventral anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in a small sample of happily married couples (Coan et al., 2006). On the other hand, this study also found that the effects of spousal hand holding moderated the neural response to threat in brain areas associated with basic emotion processing (e.g., anterior insula), suggesting an influence of social support on basic threat reactivity as well.\n\nWe know from the social-psychological research that social support has implications for health and well-being (Brown & Harris, 1978; Seeman, 1996; Wethington & Kessler, 1986), yet we know little about the processes underlying these benefits. Much may be learned by the integration of biomedical research and psychosocial research on this topic. To be specific, there is very limited research on the neural mechanisms of human social affiliation (Depue & Morrone-Stupinksy, 2005) and its moderating influence on well-understood processes underlying response to negative stimuli (although see discussion of Coan et al, 2006, and Eisenberger et al., 2007, above). Expanding such efforts would broaden understanding of what it is about social support that is beneficial to health and well-being, as well as help develop more targeted intervention efforts. The central idea is that social networks are selected by individuals and are hard to manipulate through intervention (although notably some interventions, such as home visiting programs, attempt to change such networks directly: Olds et al., 1997), it may be more fruitful to target the basic social-emotional processes that underlie the beneficial effects of social support. In particular, examination of the neural mediators underlying these effects may be a valuable window into these processes.\n\nIt has been argued (Zautra, 2003) that increased positive emotionality is a key underlying factor in the helpful impact of social support on health. There is extensive literature supporting the premise that positive emotionality and negative emotionality are relatively independent constructs from a behavioral point of view (although this bivariate structure may vary as a function of the conditions under which emotions are activated: Cacioppo & Bernston, 1994; Zautra, 2003). The functional separability of these systems appears to be supported by a meta-analysis of the neuroimaging data examining the neural mechanisms of emotion (Wager et al., 2003), albeit with a high degree of interconnection between the two. Positive emotionality generally appears to buffer the harmful effects of negative emotionality on health (e.g., Cohen, Doyle, Turner, Alper &, Skoner, 2002; Segerstrom, Taylor, Kemeny, & Fahey, 1998) but the neural mechanisms underlying these processes are not well understood (although see Taylor, Burklund, Eisenberger, Lehman, Hilmert, & Lieberman, 2008). Improved understanding of the neurobiology of positive emotionality and its interaction with the neurobiology of stress may allow greater specificity in interventions designed to improve health outcomes in populations at risk.\n\nIncorporating Cognition\n\nEmotion and cognition\n\nThere is a long and contentious history of debate regarding the relative primacy of emotion versus cognition in affecting behavior and health. Plato, who helped to father a rationlist perspective that endured to the 20th century, warned of the derailment of higher reason by emotion. In his view, “the poet’s emotional charge shot straight to its target in the auditor’s heart, and bypassed the workings of reason entirely” (O’Connell, 1997, p. 57). A parallel line of psychosocial research has maintained that emotion precedes cognition (e.g., Zajonc 1980, 1985; Zautra, 2003); this work has often used subliminal presentation of emotion cues to conclude that “preferences need no inferences” (Zajonc, 1980) and that conscious awareness is not required for emotions to have an effect on behavior and physiology. In contrast, William James and Carl Lange (Lange & James, 1922) argued for a cognitive model of emotion in which cognition preceded emotion (e.g., that the act of running from a predator would generate certain patterns of physiological sensation that are subsequently labeled as “fear”). In this view, emotion follows complex representation of sensory input rather that preceding it. There is a robust tradition of research in the social sciences concerning the cognitive appraisal of emotional stimuli (e.g., Lazarus, 1991; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) and these appraisal theorists have held to the view that cognition precedes emotion.\n\nA similar debate continues at present in human neuroscience regarding whether the amygdala is primarily under top-down (conscious: Pessoa, 2008) or bottom-up (automatic, unconscious: Dolan & Vuilleumier, 2003; Ohman, 2002) control, and is indepdendent of selective attention. There is mounting evidence both for (e.g., Pessoa, Japee, Sturman, & Ungerleider, 2006; Pessoa, McKenna, Gutierrez & Ungerleider, 2002; Pessoa, Padmala, & Morland, 2005) and against (Davidson, Jackson & Kalin, 2000; LeDoux, 1996; Armony & LeDoux, 1997; Vuilleumier, Armony, Driver, Dolan, 2001, 2003; Whalen et al. 2004, Whalen et al., 1998) the need for conscious awareness and selective attention in the processing of emotional stimuli. We have represented the unresolved nature of this debate by depicting the association between sensory processing and the core emotional systems of the brain as a heavy dotted arrow in .\n\nIt is clear, however, that as the primary neural system underlying “fight or flight”6, the core emotional systems of the brain are highly effective at recruiting other brain systems to facilitate ongoing response to threat or potential threat (Vuilleumier et al, 2001). For example, a threatening stimulus is hard to ignore and it is easier to detect other events that happen near it; this is accompanied by enhanced activation of not only the amygdala but also the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, and a network of cortical areas associated with the spatial orienting of attention (Armony & Dolan, 2002). Once a threat has been acknowledged and learned, it takes additional prefrontal neural systems to regulate physiological and emotional response to that threat (Ochsner et al., 2004; Urry et al., 2006) and to help extinguish those responses when they are no longer useful (Phelps, Delgado, Nearing, & LeDoux, 2004). Thus, the emotional and cognitive systems of the brain interact to generate behavior and influence health, and there is overlap in the brain areas that subserve each function (for a review, see Pessoa, 2008). Despite this overlap, we argue that the neural systems that we have outlined as the emotional systems of the brain are the primary mediators of allostatic accommodation and take the brunt of accumulated wear and tear (see Incorporting Allostatic Load), making these areas the first and primary foci of allostatic load in the brain. Thus, it is useful to discuss these neural systems separately in the present model.\n\nAppraisal and coping\n\nAccurate appraisal of environmental stimuli is instrumental for survival. Accordingly, both the social and life sciences place importance on the need for an understanding of how environmental stimuli are evaluated for personal salience and urgency; this common focus makes the topic of appraisal a natural “bridge” area between domains. In the social sciences, it has been demonstrated that evaluation of the personal meaning of the stressor to the individual explains a substantial amount of the variance in the stress response. In this perspective, a stimulus functions as a stressor depending upon its emotional valence (i.e., whether it is judged to be harmful or beneficial), level of intensity (e.g., aversive threat versus interesting challenge) and personal importance relative to environmental context and personal beliefs, goals, and coping resources (for a review, see Cacioppo & Gardner, 1999).\n\nWithin this framework, the appraisal system is often discussed as having primary and secondary response components (e.g., Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Monroe & Kelley, 1995). Primary appraisal is defined as the early evaluation of the impact, or potential impact, of an environmental situation on the well-being of the individual (Monroe & Kelley, 1995). As such, it is a rapid, relatively unrefined analysis of a few salient properties of the stressor, including its magnitude and whether its impact is likely to be neutral, benign, or negative (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Monroe & Kelley, 1995: as discussed above, it is not clear whether this process requires conscious awareness). Secondary appraisal has been defined as “a complex evaluative process that takes into account which coping options are available, the likelihood that a given coping option will accomplish what it is supposed to, and the likelihood that one can apply a particular strategy or set of strategies effectively” (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984, p. 35). Secondary appraisal is critical to the mobilization of personal resources to mitigate a potential threat or to compensate for it (see also Baltes & Baltes, 1990; Schultz & Heckhausen, 1996). It includes an evaluation of past successes and failures of strategic coping in similar situations. This has been hypothesized to be an iterative process that feeds back on primary appraisal over time – the combination of the two constitutes appraisal per se (Monroe & Kelley, 1995).\n\nThere are strong parallels within the neuroscience perspective on appraisal and coping. Work with animal and human models indicates that the amygdala receives convergent input regarding stressor intensity (Yoon, Fitzgerald, Angstadt, McCarron, & Phan, 2007), stressor context (e.g., Phillips & LeDoux, 1992), and personal salience (e.g., Phan et al., 2004), which may be iteratively refined (LeDoux, 1996) during the complex representation of sensory stimuli (see ). The initial stimulus evaluation that allows motivated behavioral response to biologically salient stimuli (e.g., those stimuli relevant to safety, health, or reproduction) is performed in key subsystems of the core emotional regions of the brain. Similar to the psychosocial concept of primary appraisal, this response includes rapid evaluation of stimuli for the key attributes of emotional intensity and personal salience. For example, in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study of the neural mechanisms of stimulus evaluation in healthy adults (Phan et al., 2004), the amygdala specifically responded to the emotional intensity of a given stimulus. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was activated only in conjunction with evaluation of the personal significance of the stimuli. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc, a subunit of the basal ganglia) responded to both increasing personal significance and emotional intensity (which is consistent with computational models suggesting that the NAcc gates information between the vmPFC and the amygdala: Wagar & Thagard, 2004). Thus, accurate appraisal of information from the environment requires coordinated neural effort – and the more salient the input, the more intensive and widespread the activation. When the stimuli in the above study reached increasingly higher levels of personal significance, the vmPFC recruited the additional activation of both the insula and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Other research suggests that an even more distributed neural system is engaged in situations of effortful emotion regulation of highly aversive visual stimuli (e.g., mutilated bodies of humans and animals: Ochsner, Bunge, Gross, & Gabrieli, 2002; Ochsner et al., 2004) or socially complex ones (e.g., moral versus non-moral violations: Harenski & Hamann, 2006).\n\nFrom this perspective, appraisal is an iterative process wherein the evaluation of personal salience via the vmPFC feeds back on the evaluation of emotional valence and intensity via the amygdala over time (Bechara, 2004; Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio, 2003; Phan et al., 2004). These are associated with ongoing changes in somatic state and trigger motivated behavioral responses to the stressor (Bechara et al., 2003). This neural system has the capacity to iteratively update evaluations of emotional stimuli in light of new information and information from a broader array of neural systems (e.g., long term memory). Studies of brain damage in humans and primates have found that lesions of the vmPFC and amygdala impair this process and are associated with specific deficits in social functioning and with poor social decision making (Adolphs, 2003; Beers, 2006). Experimental work with humans and animals has identified the ventromedial and dorsomedial PFC cortex as being critical not only to evaluations of the self-relatedness of emotional stimuli (Phan et al., 2004) but also to the generation of feelings of anticipation of personal reward or punishment in association with those stimuli, which in turn are highly important to prospective social decision making and judgment (Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio, 2003). One well-studied assessment of this critical process is the Iowa Gambling Task (e.g., Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson, 1995), which requires subjects to repeatedly choose from different decks of cards that provide either high gain with high risk (resulting in long term loss) or low yield with low risk (resulting in long-term gain). Patients with vmPFC cortex damage and those with damage to the amygdala both do poorly on the Iowa Gambling Task because they continue to choose high-risk strategies that eventually result in substantial long term losses (for a review, see Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio, 2003). We note that these findings parallel psychosocial views of appraisal and ongoing coping, as discussed above, as well as suggesting a rich array of testable neural mechanisms that are likely to underlie these key psychosocial processes (e.g., further examination of the role of the amygdala, the ventromedial and dorsomedial PFC, and the NAcc may bear particular fruit in such analyses, per the discussion above).\n\nWhile the psychosocial literature on appraisal and coping has a longer history than the more recent neuropsychological literature on these points, there is a new and growing body of work that bridges the two domains. For example, the substantial psychosocial literature on the taxonomy and function of coping (e.g., Bandura, 1977; Gross, 2002; Lazarus, 1966; Scherer, Schor, & Johnstone, 2001) has provided grist for hypothesis generation that has been highly fruitful in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying emotion regulation and coping. Ochsner and Gross (2005) have proposed a schema for organizing the neuroscience literature on the cognitive control of emotion that ranges on a continuum from attentional control of emotion (e.g., selective inattention: Hariri et al., 2000; Vuilleumier et al, 2001) to effortful cognitive change of emotional response (e.g., reappraisal: Ochsner et al., 2002; Kim & Hamann, 2004; Phan et al, 2004). Notably, this effort organizes the understanding of the neural mechanisms of emotion regulation in a way that can constrain and inform psychosocial theories of appraisal. Likewise, inclusion of psychosocial theories of appraisal and coping into social neuroscience research will continue to clarify these critical functions of the human brain.\n\nThe model up to now\n\nWe have argued that the core emotional regions of the brain work together to function as the primary mediator of central allostatic accommodation. As described above, these brain regions are central to the assessment of the valence (approach or avoidance), intensity, and personal salience of a stressor, as well as physiological adaptation and behavioral response to that stressor. They are also central to the emotion regulation and coping required to moderate these responses over time. Thus, the brain becomes a key point of integration for theory and research on the stress process across the life and social sciences. We then added consideration of context as a key contributor to and moderator of this process, and considered the way in which both distal and proximal contextual effects may occur, and how extra-individual resources can influence these processes. Despite the well-established role of social context on health and behavior, there are surprisingly few studies in social neuroscience on the effects of social context on brain function (although some notable exceptions do exist in the area of SES and social support, as we discuss above). Consideration of these factors is an important topic for future research. Next, in order to fully draw the links between stressor, context, allostatic accommodation, and health, we expand the model to include the accumulating effects of allostatic load. In doing so, we not only draw on the neuroscience literature, but we also expand to include some of the other principles of dynamic systems theory discussed above.\n\nIncorporating Allostatic Load: Adding time to the model\n\nThe concept of allostatic accommodation is fundamentally related to allostatic load, but distinct. To use an analogy from physics, just as acceleration results from a change in velocity, so does allostatic load result from the physiological change required to respond and adapt to a stressor (allostatic accommodation). Under allostasis, there is no load without accommodation.\n\nThe “tipping point”\n\nAs previously described, the relationship between stressor exposure and adaptive health outcomes takes the form of an inverted U-shaped curve. With mild stressors, the accumulation of load that results from ongoing allostatic accommodation is likely to be negligible – well within the “elastic limit” of human resilience described by Can"
