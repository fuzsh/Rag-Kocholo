        "text": "They didn't want no scrubs when it came to casting the members of R&B group TLC in an upcoming VH1 biopic.\n\nIn \"Crazy, Sexy, Cool: The TLC Story,\" Keke Palmer (\"Akeela and the Bee\") will play \"Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas; Lil Mama (\"America's Best Dance Crew\") will play Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes; and Drew Sidora (\"Step Up\") will play Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins. They likely have the blessing of the surviving members of TLC, Chilli and T-Boz, who are executive producers of the movie. While everyone's keeping quiet about the casting news, Sidora did post a telling tweet:\n\nTLC rose to fame in the early '90s, with their first album, \"Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip\" going quadruple-platinum. But it was their second album, \"CrazySexyCool,\" that launched them into the music stratosphere with hits like \"Creep,\" \"Waterfalls,\" and \"Diggin on You.\"\n\nBut along with fame and success came a host of troubles, including Left Eye's tumultuous relationship with football player Andre Rison as well as the group's bankruptcy filing in 1995.\n\nAfter signing on with a new label, the group meandered around other projects before settling down to record \"FanMail.\" The album was an instant success, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard charts. Their single, \"No Scrubs,\" became a blockbuster and helped the women launch a lucrative nationwide tour.\n\nBut friction was beginning to tear the group apart. After \"FanMail,\" Left Eye was pursuing a solo career when she tragically died while filming a documentary. That footage was shown by VH1 in \"The Last Days of Left Eye\" in 2007.\n\nAfter her death, Chilli and T-Boz completed the fourth TLC album, 3D (Left Eye's vocals had already been recorded). And since then, the two have continued to perform together, sometimes using images of Left Eye in the background. Last year, they announced plans for a new album and tour after the release of the VH1 biopic.\n\nCharles Stone III of \"Drumline\" will direct \"Crazy, Sexy, Cool,\" which will start filming next month in Atlanta (the trio's hometown). No word yet on when the movie will air.\n\nTLC performs \"No Scrubs\":"
