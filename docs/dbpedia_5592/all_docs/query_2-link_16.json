        "text": "While acts like Imagine Dragons and Ariana Grande made their American Music Awards debut at the Nokia Theatre on Sunday night, TLC returned to the AMAs stage after performing for the first time at the awards show in 1993. Tionnne “T-Boz” Watkins and Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas enlisted the help of Lil Mama to step in for the late Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, who died in a tragic car crash in 2002.\n\nPHOTOS: American Music Awards: Lady Gaga, Katy Perry Step Out on Red Carpet\n\nDressed in embellished all-white outfits, the trio touted their 1995 hit “Waterfalls” with Lil Mama taking the missing emcee’s verse. After the choreography-packed performance, a large image of Lopes was projected on the screen behind them.\n\nThe rapper also recently played “Left Eye” in TLC’s CrazySexyCool biopic, which aired on VH1 on Oct. 21. She starred alongside Keke Palmer and Drew Sidora as the up-and-coming iconic trio.\n\nAdditionally, T-Boz and Chilli have 10 brand-new finished tracks for a new album, expected to be ready for release in early 2014. The project will pay tribute to their late friend and group member.\n\n“There are things that we will do, both recording and touring, that will always pay homage to Left Eye,” said the group’s longtime manager Bill Diggins to The Hollywood Reporter last month. “Left Eye was an extraordinarily creative part of TLC and as an artist, I think she was unparalleled. From a human nature perspective, she was their sister and they have not forgotten that, but they now have to create different ideas without her. She’ll always be a part of TLC, but moving forward, they have to start to have their own identity without her because obviously she’s not here.”\n\nWatch TLC’s AMAs performance below:\n\nWhat did you think of TLC’s performance with Lil Mama at the American Music Awards? Sound off in the comments below."
