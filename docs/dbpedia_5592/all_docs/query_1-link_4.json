        "text": "The multi-hyphenate is looking back at the film's \"phenomenal\" choreography — and memories from set — nearly 18 years later\n\nIt's been nearly 18 years since Step Up first hit theaters — and Drew Sidora is looking back at how the movie \"turned into something pretty iconic.\"\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE about her role in Bounce TV's new series Mind Your Business, the 39-year-old multi-hyphenate and Real Housewives of Atlanta cast member also reflected on Step Up and the \"fun\" experience of filming the movie's memorable \"Til' the Dawn\" dance scene.\n\n\"I was nervous. I'm like, 'Oh my God, this is crazy.' But I think, too, also for me to have that outlet to share my music, people didn't really know I was a singer until Step Up came out,\" she now says. \"Being able to showcase that side of me was amazing.\"\n\nFor the film, in which she shared soundtrack space with the likes of Ciara and Sean Paul, Sidora recalls the feeling of displaying both her acting and musical skills, thinking that things \"can't get better than that.\"\n\nStep Up's choreography, Sidora adds, was also \"so phenomenal, mixing a little bit of ballet, jazz with hip-hop and infusing modern,\" which matched \"all the training that I had growing up.\"\n\nRelated: Drew Sidora Says Playing a Divorcée in New Sitcom Has Been 'Healing' amid Her Ongoing Divorce (Exclusive)\n\n\"But really at the end of the day, people didn't know this was the little engine that could for Disney,\" Sidora says. \"They started to put more money behind it and it became one of the biggest grossing films for them. It has, what is it, up to 20 editions to it? I don't even know what Step Up they're on now.\"\n\n\"But it really truly was kind of like a guinea pig project that turned into something pretty iconic,\" she continues. \"So I think for me, that just is a testament to us all really being humbled and really putting our best work forth and it just coming out on top and it really translating to be something great that none of us ever expected.\"\n\nAfter the first Step Up film released in 2006 — featuring Sidora as Lucy Avila, alongside Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan — five more Step Up films soon followed, as well as a three-season series Step Up: High Water.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIn the years since the first movie, Sidora says she has \"reconnected\" with Dewan, 43, on social media and still keeps up with former cast mates including Damaine Radcliff. Sidora joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Atlanta back in December 2020, and admits it would be \"awesome\" to hear if any fellow Step Up alumni are fans.\n\n\"But it would be awesome to definitely hear, or do a reunion of some sort and really hear their thoughts about [The Real Housewives of Atlanta] because, truth be told, a lot of people watch the show. They may not want to admit it, but I've met rappers that just knew too much about me,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm like, 'OK...' And basketball players and things like that. But I'm just like, 'How do you know that?' They're like, 'Well, my girl watches it,' or 'My momma,' whatever, 'My sister.' I'm like, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.' So I think people are more fans of the show than they would lead people to believe, but it would be funny to hear from my cast what they really think of me on it.\"\n\nMind Your Business — Sidora's new sitcom, which she's described as \"healing\" for her — airs Saturdays at 8 p.m. ET on Bounce TV, with episodes viewable on streaming service Brown Sugar.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
