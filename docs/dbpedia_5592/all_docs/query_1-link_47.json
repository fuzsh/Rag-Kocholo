        "text": "Drew Sidora unleased on Marlo Hampton after her Real Housewives of Atlanta castmember \"attacked\" her weight on national television, RadarOnline.com has learned.\n\nBravoholics know that Sidora and Hampton have been hurling insults at each other all season, but their feud reached a new height on Sunday when Hampton suggested her RHOA enemy \"should go get lipo\" while appearing on Andy Cohen's Watch What Happens Live.\n\nIt didn't take long for Hampton's comments to make their way to Sidora, who fought back on her Instagram Stories.\n\n“I am sitting here in disbelief that @marlohampton would attack me’ by body shaming and attacking my weight at this crucial time in my life,” she wrote.\n\nSidora noted she's going through a “public divorce” from her estranged husband, Ralph Pittman, and “dealing with stressful emotional issues\" while raising two young children.\n\n“I am sitting here in disbelief that @marlohampton would attack me’ by body shaming and attacking my weight at this crucial time in my life,” the RHOA star replied.\n\n“Clearly attacking me, won’t get you very far,” Sidora added. “If you feel this way about me at this size, I can only imagine what you think about women of all sizes who have weight challenge, illnesses or eating disorders due to comments like yours.”\n\nShe ended her lengthy response by stating, “All I can say is Shame on you @marlohampton.”\n\nHampton later continued her attack, taking to social media to bring up Sidora's recent accusations, in which she claimed her RHOA co-star of not being able to pass a drug test in a recent episode.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for the RadarOnline.com newsletter to get your daily dose of dope. Daily. Breaking. Celebrity news. All free.\n\n“I have watched you assassinate my character all season. Your words have been absolutely disgusting to and about me this past year. Stop it. I laughed to mask the pain,” Marlo wrote.\n\nNew RHOA episodes air Sundays at 8 PM ET on Bravo."
