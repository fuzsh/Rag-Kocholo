In 1983, she directed SUGAR CANE ALLEY (Rue Cases Negres) putting the French West Indies on the world cinema stage. This critically acclaimed movie went on to win the prestigious Cesar award (French Academy Award) for best first film making Euzhan Palcy the first black person (male or female) to be granted this prestigious award. SUGAR CANE ALLEY won more than 17 international awards including the Silver Lion and Best Actress awards at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nEuzhan Palcy successfully brought back Marlon Brando to cinema screens with the anti-apartheid film, A DRY WHITE SEASON. She travelled to South Africa defying the special section of the apartheid regime with the help of Dr. Nthato Motlana, President Nelson Mandela’s personal physician and friend, who smuggled her into Soweto undercover. She received the Orson Welles award for this film in Los Angeles in 1989. After his historic release from Robben Island in 1990, the newly elected President Mandela watched the film and invited her to South Africa in 1995 (during the first anniversary of his election). Therefore, she directed and produced the never before seen interview titled MY CHAT WITH PRESIDENT NELSON MANDELA.\n\nEuzhan wanted A Dry White Season to be “Cinema Verité” — that is to reflect the truth — at all costs. She was so passionate about creating an accurate portrayal that she traveled to Soweto undercover to research the riots. With a false cover of a recording artist looking for singers for her new album she was secretly interviewing victims of the apartheid regime thus eluding the South African secret services.\n\nThe regime felt particularly threatened at this time and had stepped up it’s actions against the opposition. A Dry White Season was finally released in September, 1989. South Africa banned it, enraged by the truths exposed of what they were actually doing to the people who opposed them. MGM had to continue engaging the two bodyguards to protect Euzhan Palcy throughout the promotion of the film.\n\nIn 1992, she wrote and directed the musical fantasy film SIMEON with Kassav, the Godfathers of Zouk music and premiered the Caribbean Musical Fantasy genre. Technically, SIMEON was the first French movie produced with CGI VFX & digital scans.

While his mother worked two full-time jobs to make ends meet, Robin and his sister Florence spent three years in foster care before coming to Boston, Massachusetts at age ten. Robin grew up in Belmont where he noticed people close to him were influenced by the wrong crowd, and he saw their lives crumble from drugs and alcohol. He became determined to become successful and avoid self-destructive behaviors at all costs. Robin explored his passion for flying by joining the Civil Air Patrol, immersed himself in extracurricular activities, and blossomed as a track star in high school.\n\nWhile in college, he enjoyed working as a summer camp counselor. On a track scholarship, he graduated from the University of Connecticut with a Bachelors of Fine Arts Degree in Acting and a minor in Communications. He later qualified for the Olympics, but moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. It was in Los Angeles that he discovered flight school, and obtained his Commercial Helicopter Pilot License and Certified Flight Instructor’s Certificate. Shortly after, be started his own helicopter company that grew to a $3.5 million a year business earning him features in numerous books, magazines and television appearances including the Oprah Winfrey Show.\n\nRobin created Positive Vibrations in 1990 when a local school invited his first company, Bravo Helicopters & Wing, for a career day landing. In 1992 he met a single mother with a troubled son. Robin was compelled to mentor Richard Washington, and discovered a passion for helping kids and the community.\n\nRobin’s vision was to honor WWII’s Tuskegee Airmen by continuing their legacy with the next generation of pilots and provide tools for youth to learn about aviation as a real life application of math and science. He founded Torrance Aeronautical Museum in 1997. In 2000, Compton’s Mayor Eric Perrodin invited him to re-locate the organization to the Compton Airport. Seeing the greater need for at risk youth programs in Compton, Robin moved his small staff of two and a few desks with computers to the 7,000 square foot hangar, and re-named the organization Tomorrow’s Aeronautical Museum (TAM). Robin envisioned TAM’s Compton airport location as being an entry point for underrepresented youth to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) careers and enrichment. TAM’s purpose was simple: teach inner city kids about flying, support their academic achievement, and instill in them the importance of their education.\n\nToday, the non-profit museum boasts a variety of static displays and historical artifacts, an annual Arts & Aviation Career Expo, and is the umbrella agency for the Aero Squad fixed wing flight school and after-school program in its Tuskegee Airmen Learning Center. TAM has become a living classroom bringing aviation history to life and empowering the dreams of youth to take flight. TAM has been a safe haven for the youth in the community since it’s inception evolving into a safe place for learning and building positive relationships with other adults and peers. Robin instills a “second home” culture. When a youth joins TAM, they not only join a family, but become part of a cultivation process designed to empower them to excel in their personal, academic, and future professional lives. Under his leadership, TAM envisions a place where all community youth receive the support they need to graduate high school, go to college, and become future contributors in the fields of science, aeronautics, technology, and to the well-being of society. TAM serves the community from 8am to 8pm daily, and Robin currently volunteers 100% of his time as Executive Director. Most youth do not have access to aviation-centered enrichment on this level, let alone an impoverished area like Compton.\n\nRobin and TAM have received numerous awards, recognitions and honors for service to at- risk youth, including the General Noel F. Parrish Award presented by the National Order of Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.; the Astronaut Ronald McNair Award presented by National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees and the Living Legend Award presented by LA County Board of Supervisors. Robin and TAM have been featured in People Magazine, Los Angeles Times, Oprah, CNN, AIM Zones on AOL to name a few, and have been recognized by Senator Roderick D. Wright, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, Congresswoman Janice Hahn, and California State Assemblyman Isadore Hall. In November 2011, Robin received the Bank of America Local Heroes Award.\n\nRobin is also a highly sought after motivational speaker through his “Positive Vibrations” program. He is a stunt pilot with celebrity status and has several movie credits to his name. He privately funded many of the museum’s programs and equipment needs. Robin holds fast his belief that all children are capable of achieving success.\n\nIn addition to receiving his BA in Acting and Communications from the University of Connecticut, Robin is a Gold Seal Flight Instructor, helicopter pilot, airplane pilot, the museum’s Executive Director, President & Chief Pilot of Celebrity Helicopters, and mentor. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Myra; daughter Little Robin and son Neeko.\n\nLloyd Greig, M.D.\n\nJamaica\n\nPhysician, Cedars Sinai Medical Group; Founding Member & Chairman of the Board, United Support of Artists of Africa (USA for Africa)\n\nCaribbean Heritage Humanitarian Award\n\nLloyd Byron Greig was born in the town of Savannah La Mar on the island of Jamaica.

Making their children their priority, Rosie and Julien decided that Rosie who had worked in Securities and Investments upon moving from the United States Virgin Islands to Los Angeles in 1999, would give up her career in finance and become a stay-at-home mother to ensure that their children received the best possible care that only a mother could give to her child. Julien, who worked as a Federal Prosecutor at the time, shortly after accepted a position with the Law Firm of Dovel & Luner, where he remains one of the lead attorneys today.\n\nGrowing up in the Caribbean afforded Julien and Rosie the opportunity to appreciate the simple things in life yet aspire to achieve greater things in their lives. Hard work and good ethic, the principles instilled in them by their parents, their Caribbean teachers, their churches and the communities in which the two were raised – are what the couple credits for their success today. However, success in philanthropy is measured differently than success in business or government. And while Julien’s profession has afforded his wife Rosie and their children to enjoy a rather pleasant and comfortable lifestyle, [outside of seeing their children develop into healthy and independent young adult (Justin) and teenagers (Julien, and Jaida)] today, it is about the stunning strides that underprivileged children have made in overcoming the challenges that they face. Success for Julien and Rosie today, is about making a sad child happy. Success is about getting an HIV positive child to feel just as loved and accepted as the child who is HIV negative. Success is about ensuring that every child is happy over the holidays. It is about ensuring that every child has access to education and the books and supplies he needs for school. It is about reducing the infant mortality rate in the Caribbean, especially on Haiti. Success to Julien and Rosie is “about the gains made in helping others without – because in helping those who are less fortunate than ourselves, we express our true Caribbean values.\n\nOne of the greatest of those values is our belief that the best investment that anyone can ever make is in the life of a child.”\n\nPras\n\nHaiti\n\nGrammy Award-winning Rapper, Filmmaker and Activist\n\nGrammy and Emmy winner, Prakazrel “Pras” Samuel Michél, rose to international super-stardom as a member of the multi-platinum group “The Fugees.” As a solo artist, he is most known for writing and producing the Grammy-nominated, worldwide top ten hit “Ghetto Supastar” feat. Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Mya. The hit single was included in the soundtrack for the film “Bulworth”.\n\nThe Fugees stepped onto the music scene with a hip hop sound mixed with a Caribbean beat. A reflection of Pras’ identity — a Haitian American, born in Brooklyn, raised in New Jersey.\n\nAfter his Fugees fame, Pras continued to work not only as a performer but also as an actor, producer and documentarian. In “Skid Row”, the documentary chronicles Pras as he spends nine days as a homeless man in downtown Los Angeles. His film “Sweet Micky for President” follows Pras as he returns to Haiti post-earthquake and passionately mobilizes a presidential campaign for the unlikeliest of candidates: Michel Martelly, aka ‘Sweet Micky’, Haiti’s most popular and most outlandish pop star. The film won the Jury Award for Best Documentary at Slam Dance and Documentary Edge Festival in 2015. It was also an official selection at HotDocs, Miami International Film Festival and Los Angeles Film Festival. Pras is also Producer on the web series “The Bay” which swept the digital categories at the 2017 Daytime Emmy Awards winning five awards.\n\nPras continues his work in music, and his new band Get Fr3e released their first album in 2015. Their song “Came to Win” was written for “Sweet Micky for President.”\n\nPras’ philanthropic efforts to improve the lives of Haitians after the devastating 2010 earthquake inspired him to take frequent travels around the world, specifically to countries where war, crime, disease, and lack of governance remain destabilizing issues. Recently, he visited Azerbaijan, North Korea, Yemen, and Iraq.\n\nPras has also worked with the Clinton Global Initiative, Artists for Peace and Justice, and his support for President Obama’s campaigns have shown his consistent drive to inspire conversation about the positive changes needed for societies to grow and flourish. During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Pras was one of President Obama’s top 25 private donors, and firmly supports the effort made by the President and the First Lady.\n\nFrom his start as a member of the Fugees, infusing hip-hop with social consciousness, to his efforts as a filmmaker documenting grass roots elections in Haiti, Pras has made it his mission to produce art that fights against injustice and sheds light on the important issues of our time. The success Pras created when he founded the Fugees opened the door for him to pursue impactful political activism. While he does not seek the spotlight, nobody should underestimate the passion and vision of the man who makes it his ongoing mission to live a purpose-driven life that uplifts, entertains, and transforms the world around him.\n\n“The Fugees afforded me many opportunities, professionally and personally,” explains Pras. “I’ve traveled the world, met the most interesting people and, most importantly, I am able to put my celebrity to good use by contributing to charities and working on philanthropic projects. Of all my endeavors, my philanthropic work is what I take most seriously. It’s what I hold dear to my heart and believe is my larger purpose on this planet.”\n\nShane Morgan & Romaine Sabukie Allen\n\nJamaica\n\nDirectors, Life Yard\n\nShane Morgan and Romaine Sabukie Allen are the Directors of Life Yard an oasis in the middle of Parade Gardens in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nShane Morgan\n\nHaving witnessed first-hand challenges facing his community while growing up, Shane Morgan made it his mission to make a difference in his community of Parade Gardens and to lead in the social reform and development of a community riddled with political segregation, violence and financial constraints.\n\nWith this mission in mind, he and a group of Rastafarians within the community with the same vision created Life Yard. A social enterprise that would be geared toward creating changes through art, education and agriculture.\n\nShane’s collaboration with Paint Jamaica acted as a stepping stone to Life Yard being a driving force behind Parade Garden’s new glow.\n\nWith a genuine love for social work, he has been able to garner support from residents and establish relationships outside of his community. As a result, he has been able to grow partnerships that blossomed into successful workshops for children in the neighbourhood. Teaching them social skills such as crochet, drumming and art.\n\nAlthough the challenges have not been eradicated, Shane Morgan and Life Yard’s intent on “bending the tree while it’s young” will most likely see a change in the thoughts and actions of the community’s future generations.\n\nLife Yard is now a space where children laugh, learn and liberate their minds. Each member tries to be an individual the children can emulate, practicing self-sustainability through their farm to kitchen restaurant, pallet furniture made from recycled pallets and craft jewelry made from simple resources such as coconut shells.\n\nShane Morgan has a sincere love for his community. This love inspired him to start Southside Eye TV, an extension of Aseer Entertainment, a media company owned by him and his partner.\n\nThrough photography and videos, Shane Morgan highlights what he believes is the beauty of self determination of the residents of Parade Gardens, which is achievable, despite the struggles they face.\n\nRomaine Sabukie Allen\n\nGrowing up in a Rastafarian household, Romaine Sabukie Allen, understood from a very young age that “there is nothing more rewarding in life than to work for the benefit of others, one can derive more pleasure from giving rather than receiving”. One of Haile Selassie’s famous philosophies.\n\nAs a child his mother would have to constantly talk to him about giving away everything that he has and then having nothing for himself. But no matter how many times she spoke to him, his actions remained the same. Eventually one of her favorite names for him became “Samaritan”.\n\nOne of his favorite quotes from Haile Selassie is “Let infants be clothed, the elder be fed and the sick taken care.” He continues to live by these words as well as the words of Marcus Garvey and Patrice Lumba.\n\nIn his second year at the University of Technology, studying a BSc., he got reacquainted with Shane Morgan of Life Yard ( he knew him from the neighbourhood). He immediately fell in love with the mission of Life Yard.\n\nHe believed it was his calling and even ended his fruit business to be a part of Life Yard full time. Since then, his contribution has been nothing short of extraordinary. He has managed to enhance the vision and broaden the scope of Life Yard. Present for every event and standing strong with Shane Morgan for every mission, Romaine Sabukie Allen has been able to satisfy his own yearning to enhance the life of everyone who crosses his path.\n\nIt is safe to say that even though he has grown into an inspiring young man, he is still that little boy who is giving his all even though it often means being left with nothing but personal satisfaction. Both his mother and father had instilled in him a love for music. Realizing the powerful influence that music has, he also uses his creative energy with his sound system, Black Revelationz Sound, to help others learn about themselves and be better influences in society.\n\nPlease visit www.lifeyard.org for more information.\n\nCarmen J.

Enrolling in college there, the Big Apple remains home and work today.\n\nAfter attaining a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Communication from the State University of New York at Albany, Fox spent the first seven years of her career as an award-winning News Promotion Producer at ABC and FOX news affiliates, before becoming the Editor-In-Chief of JAMROCK Magazine, a then nationally-published Caribbean lifestyle and entertainment magazine. Ultimately, she parlayed her extensive professional media experience into launching a music media-marketing firm aptly named FOX FUSE, representing clients such as Pitbull, Lil Jon and Shaggy. The company became a partnership in 2010, to allow time for her to embark on an acting career.\n\nWorking in entertainment offered a natural transition into acting for Fox, who told her mother since she was a five-year-old in Guyana that she will become an actress one day. Being surrounded by opportunities in New York forced her to make the leap towards fulfilling her ultimate dream. Fox’s first acting gig placed her on the set of the Roc-A-Wear 10th Anniversary commercial in August 2009, where she was directed by Spike Lee.
