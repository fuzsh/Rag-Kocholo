        "text": "James Dornan (born 1 May 1982) is an actor, model, and musician from Northern Ireland. He played Sheriff Graham Humbert in the ABC series Once Upon a Time (2011–2013), and serial killer Paul Spector in the BBC Two and RTÉ One crime drama series The Fall (2013–2016), the latter of which won him an Irish Film and Television Award for Best Actor in Television and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Actor . In film, he portrayed Axel von Fersen in Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006), Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades franchise (2015–2018), and Jan Kubiš in Anthropoid (2016).\n\nTim McGraw, born Samuel Timothy McGraw in 1967 in Delhi, Louisiana, is a highly accomplished American country singer and songwriter. He has shaped the contemporary country music landscape with his soulful vocals and compelling storytelling. His journey to stardom began after discovering that his estranged father was Tug McGraw, a professional baseball player, which inspired him to pursue his dreams with steely determination. McGraw's music career took off in 1990 when he signed with Curb Records. In his initial years, he produced several successful singles that contributed to the growth of his fame. His breakthrough came in 1994 with the release of the album Not a Moment Too Soon, which peaked at number one on the Billboard Country charts. Throughout his career, McGraw has released more than 14 studio albums and a majority of those have reached number one on the Top Country Albums charts. He has also won multiple awards, including Grammys, over a dozen Academy of Country Music awards, and even a few People's Choice Awards, proving his mettle as a distinguished artist. Beyond music, Tim McGraw has also ventured into acting, showcasing his talent in films like Friday Night Lights and The Blind Side. His endeavors aren't limited to entertainment; he has been involved in various philanthropic activities. Together with his wife, Faith Hill, another country superstar, they have initiated several charitable projects, including Neighbor's Keeper Foundation, a non-profit organization aimed at improving community services in areas such as education and health. Despite his numerous accomplishments, McGraw remains grounded, often crediting his success to his fans and maintaining a warm, down-to-earth persona that resonates with audiences worldwide.\n\nJulie Benz, an American actress, is best remembered for her critically acclaimed roles in both television and film. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on May 1, 1972, she was raised in a family deeply entrenched in the world of figure skating. Her early years were marked by intensive training and competitive events, even reaching the 1988 U.S. Championships in junior ice dancing. However, a stress fracture at 14 ended her promising skating career and steered her towards acting. Benz's acting career began with a small role in the horror movie Two Evil Eyes directed by George A. Romero and Dario Argento. Over the years, she carved out a niche for herself in the entertainment industry, garnering significant roles in various genres. She is notably recognized for her role as Rita Morgan in Showtime's drama series Dexter, for which she won the 2006 Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress. Benz also portrayed Darla on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spinoff series Angel, leaving a lasting impact on fans of the supernatural genre. In addition to her work in television, Benz has appeared in a number of films, including Jawbreaker, The Brothers, and Rambo. She has also lent her voice to video games like Halo 2 and Defiance. Despite her diverse roles, Julie Benz consistently brings an engaging energy and emotional depth to her characters, making her a beloved figure in the entertainment industry. Her journey from a figure skater to an accomplished actress serves as an inspiration to many."
