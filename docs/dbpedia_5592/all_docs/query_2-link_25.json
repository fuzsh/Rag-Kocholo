The focus is on universal and widely used interventions that touch large numbers of families and that are primarily preventive, such as those delivered in health care settings; those delivered in connection with child care, early education, and K-3 schooling; and public education approaches. 1 These interventions and approaches generally emphasize providing parents with knowledge and guidance about children's development and successful parenting practices; many also connect parents to a variety of needed support services. Following this review, the chapter turns to a discussion of the use of information and communication technologies to support parenting. The chapter then examines the research evaluating the impact on parenting of income, nutrition, health care, and housing support programs and parental and family leave policies described in Chapter 3. The chapter concludes with a summary.",

        "text": "UNIVERSAL/PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS\n\nParents seek knowledge about how to raise their children from many sources, including both formal programs and information they obtain on their own. Numerous books, magazine articles, and Websites provide information about parenting. Whereas earlier generations may have relied on books such as Benjamin Spock's Baby and Child Care (e.g., Spock, 1957, 1968, 1976) and later generations on guidance from T. Berry Brazelton and Harvey Karp (Brazelton, 1992; Karp, 2002; Karp and Spencer, 2004), parents today are seeking information from a more diverse array of print, online, and human resources. Some of the information that is available is not grounded in evidence.\n\nParents seek information and guidance in particular about actions they can take that apply to the developmental stage of their child (e.g., infancy, toddlerhood, early childhood, early school age). They naturally look to their extended family (e.g., their own parents, siblings), the community (including others who are raising their own children), faith-based institutions, and community organizations for guidance and support. All of these sources contribute to parents' knowledge, attitudes, and practices with respect to raising their children. In the best cases, parents have access to and knowledge of multiple resources and are able to draw on them as needed.\n\nThere are also a variety of formal sources of parenting information, guidance, and support. These sources include primary care practitioners who provide guidance on early learning, well-child care and guidance, and other health care for children. In some communities, this role also is filled by visiting nurses and others in both lay and professional disciplines with experience in parenting. Other formal programs discussed in this chapter include center-based child care and comprehensive early care and education (ECE) programs (e.g., Head Start and Early Head Start). These programs, sometimes referred to as universal interventions, reflect the shared needs of children and families for health care, educational preparation, and general support.\n\nWell-Child Care2\n\nWell-child care refers to preventive care visits for children that include not only basic health care, vaccination, and developmental assessment but also anticipatory guidance (counseling and education on a broad variety of topics aimed at supporting parents) and identification of family concerns that can serve as a barrier to good parenting. Conducted by pediatricians, family physicians, and other primary care providers, well-child care is a mainstay of families' interaction with the health care system. In 2013, 92 percent of children under the age of 6 and covered by health insurance had had a well-child visit in the past year (Child Trends Databank, 2014). In the 0-8-year age range, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a regular schedule of multiple well-child visits during the first 2 years and annual visits thereafter and specifies that each visit should include a physical exam, anticipatory guidance, and developmental/behavioral assessment (American Academy of Pediatrics and Bright Futures, 2016). Several other organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Academy of Family Physicians have developed similar well-child care recommendations (American Academy of Family Physicians, 2005; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2015). Visits may be conducted either individually or in a group format.\n\nAnticipatory guidance is intended to help parents prepare for and deal with issues and concerns—such as anticipated developmental steps and situational crises—they may encounter as their child grows. Guidelines for anticipatory guidance encompass a broad variety of topics pertinent to supporting evidence-based parenting knowledge and practices, ranging from promoting children's health and safety (e.g., guidance on helmet use, gun safety, treatment and counseling on overweight and obesity, guidance for parents on tobacco cessation), to appropriate discipline techniques, to managing difficult child behavior (e.g., sibling rivalry, tantrums) (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2000, 2002; Green and Palfrey, 2002). Multiple randomized controlled studies have examined tools for enhancing anticipatory guidance, such as telephone advice lines, supplemental parent education via DVD, Websites, and waiting-room kiosks (Bergman et al., 2009; Christakis et al., 2006; Kempe et al., 1999; Paradis et al., 2011; Sanghavi, 2005). Most of these supplemental interventions have failed to show substantial benefits, but efforts to improve safe sleep by means of video education modules and nurse education for parents have shown promising results in uncontrolled trials (Canter et al., 2015; Goodstein et al., 2015). (See also the section on information and communication technologies later in this chapter.)\n\nUnfortunately, many families do not receive all of the parenting support and guidance that is recommended in well-child care guidelines. A shortage of provider time to cover the full range of topics may be one of the most important factors in the observed variation in the quality of well-child care. Longer well-child visits have been associated with more anticipatory guidance, more psychosocial risk assessment, and better ratings of family-centeredness of care in survey research with parents (Halfon et al., 2011). Yet the AAP has estimated that it would take a clinician 90 minutes to complete just one visit if all of its guidelines were followed (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004). Given the time limitations for well-child visits (often constrained to 15-30 minutes), there have been efforts to expand the scope of visits by partnering families with nonphysician providers who can offer education, guidance, and counseling services to augment the care provided during formal visits, either within or outside of those visits (Farber, 2009; Zuckerman et al., 2004). However, the qualified personnel needed to provide those services are lacking.\n\nIn general, although well-child visits, including anticipatory guidance, likely support parenting and the achievement of evidence-based parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices (e.g., vaccination), and several interventions have been designed to enhance the effectiveness of well-child care, evaluation of these interventions is limited. In addition, there is a lack of objective measures with which to evaluate effects of these interventions on parenting behavior or to identify the optimal mode of delivery of well-child care (O'Connell et al., 2015).\n\nSome models of care and enhanced anticipatory guidance have proven successful, particularly by extending the resources provided during the initial visit through regular contact and support. Healthy Steps for Young Children is a model of care and enhanced anticipatory guidance in which a pediatric health care provider and a child specialist with training in child development (e.g., nurse, social worker) partner to provide well-child care. The specialist spends extra time with the family after the physician visit, offering home visits and connecting the family with telephone help lines, parent support groups, and community resources (Zuckerman et al., 2004). Most of the evaluations of Healthy Steps have focused on parenting outcomes rather than child outcomes (Piotrowski et al., 2009). A systematic review of experimental and quasi-experimental studies (Piotrowski et al., 2009) found that this model provided parents with effective developmental screening and anticipatory guidance (Caughy et al., 2003, 2004; Huebner et al., 2004; Johnston et al., 2006; Kinzer et al., 2004; McLearn et al., 2004; Minkovitz et al., 2003; Niederman et al., 2007). For example, parents reported improved parenting practices with respect to discipline, safety, and promotion of early reading (Minkovitz et al., 2003a). Other positive outcomes from Healthy Steps include parents reporting greater knowledge of infant development, better recognition of appropriate discipline, improved compliance with immunization and well-child visit schedules, and increased satisfaction with pediatric care (Johnston et al., 2006; Minkovitz et al., 2003).\n\nAnother program, the Parent-focused Redesign for Encounters, Newborns to Toddlers (PARENT) intervention (Coker et al., 2016), employs a team-based approach to care in which a parent coach provides the bulk of services at well-child visits and addresses specific needs faced by families in low-income communities. An initial randomized evaluation of this model among 251 parents found positive effects on parents' receipt of anticipatory guidance and health information, psychosocial assessment, and other services. Parents participating in the intervention had significantly reduced emergency department use (22% of control parents versus 10% of intervention parents reported two or more emergency department visits in the past 12 months) (Coker et al., 2016).\n\nFinally, a well-known program designed to support early literacy, Reach Out and Read, provides caregivers of young children with free, age-appropriate books and anticipatory guidance on the importance of child literacy at each well-child care visit to promote caregiver-child reading. As noted in a recent review, the existing evidence on this program is limited by nonrandom designs, data collected by self-report, and high participant dropout rates (Yeager Pelatti et al., 2014). That said, a recent cross-sectional survey of eight Reach Out and Read sites found that caregivers provided with at least four books read to their children more often than those who received fewer books (Rikin et al., 2015). Other observational studies of the program also have found that it is associated with improvement in the home literacy environment for children, particularly for parents who might otherwise face obstacles in this regard, with parents participating in the program being more likely to report having books in the home and reading aloud to and looking at books with their children (Needlman et al., 2005; Zuckerman, 2009). However, there have been no studies of the reading scores of children whose caregivers participate in Reach Out and Read.\n\nPatient-Centered Medical Homes and Shared Decision Making\n\nThe patient-centered medical home is a relatively new model of care in which primary care providers serve as the medical home for patients, offering team-based and coordinated care to increase the receipt of preventive services and reduce the need for specialty or emergency room care. Early findings from a review of randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies suggest that interventions based on this model have a small positive impact on patient experiences with health care and a small to moderate effect on the delivery of primary care services (Jackson et al., 2013). Family-centered care recognizes a partnership among patients, families, and health care professionals and encourages shared decision making (Scholle et al., 2010), which can improve patients' knowledge about treatment options and risk perceptions and help them take a more active role in decisions about their care (Stacey et al., 2014). In meta-analyses of studies using various designs, shared decision-making interventions designed to engage pediatric patients, parents, or both in medical decisions significantly reduced decisional conflict and improved parents' knowledge of their children's health conditions and how to manage them (Wyatt et al., 2015).\n\nUniversal Health Interventions for Parents for Specific Parenting Behaviors\n\nMany interventions for parents that occur within health care settings support parents in engaging in empirically grounded parenting practices outlined in Chapter 2 that promote the physical health of their children. Examples of these practices include receiving preconception and prenatal care, breastfeeding, complying with recommended immunization schedules, limiting children's screen time, helping children avoid overweight and obesity, reducing children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and educating caregivers on normal infant crying to reduce shaken baby syndrome/abusive head trauma.\n\nPreconception and Prenatal Interventions\n\nSelf-identification as a parent often begins long before the birth of a baby. Pregnancy and the postpartum period serve as the transition period for becoming a parent as both mothers and fathers anticipate changes in their roles, prepare for the upcoming birth, and recall important aspects of their own childhoods (Leon, 2009). Parental attachment starts to develop during pregnancy, facilitated by fetal movement as well as biological and hormonal changes in the mother. Feeling the baby move or seeing the fetus on ultrasound has been shown to significantly increase feelings of attachment, and there are even surveys for measuring maternal-fetal attachment during pregnancy (Pisoni et al., 2014).\n\nAs a universal parenting intervention, family planning helps optimize the timing of pregnancy and defer conception for individuals who do not desire children or do not feel ready to have a child under their current circumstances. More than one-half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended. These pregnancies can have serious negative consequences for parents as well as for children, including complications with pregnancy and delivery; exposure to illicit substances in utero; low birth weight; and higher risk of infant death, abuse, and developmental delays (Finer and Zolna, 2014; Institute of Medicine, 1995; Sawhill and Venator, 2015). Family planning can include efforts both to delay the onset of sexual activity among young people and to increase access to and use of birth control among those who are sexually active but do not currently desire pregnancy (Finer and Zolna, 2014). Family planning can be particularly valuable for populations at high risk for unintended pregnancy, including adolescents, individuals who abuse substances, and parents with severe mental illness (Institute of Medicine, 1995; Seeman, 2010; Strunk, 2008). A randomized intervention in North Carolina enrolled adolescent mothers with their first child in the Adolescent Parenting Program, which offers case management and peer group meetings aimed at keeping adolescents in school and preventing a rapid second pregnancy (Sangalang et al., 2006). Compared with usual care, the program did not reduce time to second birth among participants as a whole, but the time to next birth was significantly longer for 12- to 16-year-olds participating in the program. (The Adolescent Parenting Program is discussed further in Chapter 5.) In a longitudinal study, adolescent mothers offered subdermal contraceptive implants immediately postpartum had significant reductions in rapid repeat pregnancy compared with controls, as most had retained the implant 1 year after delivery (Tocce et al., 2012).\n\nPreconception and prenatal health visits are universal strategies for optimizing maternal health and well-being prior to and during pregnancy and promoting healthy child development. As discussed in Chapter 1, exposures in the in utero environment can affect the developing fetus in ways that shape health across the life span (Institute of Medicine and National Research Council, 2009; Tsankova et al., 2007; van Ijzendoorn et al., 2011). Prior to conception, people can initiate many health behaviors with strong evidence for improving child birth and developmental outcomes. These behaviors include folic acid supplementation to reduce neural tube defects (De-Regil et al., 2010); weight loss for obese mothers to prevent stillbirth and infant death (Aune et al., 2014); and cessation of tobacco use (discussed further below) to reduce the risk for pregnancy complications, low birth weight, and preterm delivery. Preconception and prenatal services also are important for identifying and providing intervention for women with such conditions as psychosocial stress (e.g., depression, anxiety, job strain), which during pregnancy is associated with preterm birth and low birth weight (Gold and Marcus, 2008; Loomans et al., 2013), and mental illness, which can increase the risk of fetal death and behavioral and mental health problems in children (Lancaster et al., 2010; O'Donnell et al., 2014).\n\nAfter conception, universal parenting programs promote healthy pregnancy and delivery, often through education and counseling to increase parents' knowledge of child development and use of effective parenting practices. For example, California tested a Kit for New Parents available through prenatal care providers, delivery hospitals, home visits, and other means that provides new and expecting parents with free pregnancy and early childhood information. The kit led to a significant increase in parent knowledge at 2-month follow-up (based on an assessment of sleep safety, infant feeding and nutrition, early learning, accessing child care, low-cost medical care for babies, and smoking cessation) compared with controls in a quasi-experimental study (Neuhauser et al., 2007). Also, nearly half of mothers who received the kit reported improved parenting practices, with significant differences seen between participants and controls at 14-month follow-up in frequency of reading to their children, steps taken to childproof their homes, taking children for routine medical visits, and use of safer bottle-feeding practices. These gains were particularly strong for Spanish-speaking mothers, suggesting that videos and written materials may be useful for such interventions as they can be easily translated into other languages (Neuhauser et al., 2007).\n\nChildbirth classes for expecting parents are widely available. Some medical and community centers also offer classes in newborn care, first aid, breastfeeding, and infant sleep. However, such classes have not been studied for their effects on promoting evidence-based knowledge, attitudes, and practices.\n\nThe use of group visits for prenatal care has attracted strong interest because of the potential for peer support. While group care appears to result in high participant satisfaction, however, a recent Cochrane review found only four eligible studies of group prenatal care and noted no differences in either maternal or infant birth or health outcomes (Catling et al., 2015). Centering Pregnancy is a proprietary model for group prenatal care (Mittal, 2011) that has been given a “strong” evidence rating by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2015). Groups of 8 to 10 women meet with a health care provider to discuss nutrition, stress management, breastfeeding, and other issues. One large randomized controlled trial examined the impact of this model on key outcomes, including adequacy of prenatal care and rates of preterm birth. Analysis of data from individuals who enrolled and participated (N = 993) showed that those in the intervention received better prenatal care, had fewer preterm births, were more likely to initiate breastfeeding, and had better prenatal knowledge relative to those receiving usual care (Ickovics et al., 2007). Sites using the model have reported an enhanced capacity to serve nonpregnant patients, as the group sessions free up resources previously used to provide individual visits (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2015).\n\nAll of these programs address knowledge, attitudes, and practices focused on improving children's physical and mental health at birth and beyond. However, some researchers have asserted that the sources of disparities in birth outcomes (e.g., the increased risk for preterm birth and infant mortality among African American women relative to other women) are isolated not only to the 9 months of pregnancy but also arise from parents' own developmental trajectories (Lu and Halfon, 2003). This view implies that support for parents may need to start with support for positive environments, health behaviors, and opportunities focused on reducing risks for women long before they actually conceive. As discussed further in Chapter 5, some evidence indicates that school-based clinics that provide prenatal care for teenagers in the school setting increase the uptake of health care and also encourage adolescents to stay in school. These programs have been shown to reduce absenteeism and dropout rates, help in identifying potential developmental delays among children born to teenagers, improve birth weights, and encourage the use of contraception in correlational and qualitative research (Griswold et al., 2013; Strunk, 2008).\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nA systematic review of 10 randomized controlled studies of primary care-based educational interventions designed to improve breastfeeding practices among low-income women found that such interventions are effective in encouraging mothers to initiate breastfeeding as well as to continue breastfeeding 3 months postpartum. Successful programs often involved ongoing brief follow-up sessions with health care providers (Ibanez et al., 2012). In another review of randomized controlled studies conducted primarily in the United States and other Western nations, breastfeeding interventions using lactation consultants and counselors who provide antenatal education and postnatal support were found to be associated with increased initiation of breastfeeding and increased exclusive breastfeeding rates (Patel and Patel, 2015).\n\nA lack of research exists on how to support breastfeeding effectively among adolescent mothers in the United States, whose breastfeeding rates are disproportionately low (Sipsma et al., 2013; Wambach et al., 2011). In one randomized study (N = 289), predelivery and postnatal education and counseling from lactation consultants who were registered nurses and peer counselors significantly increased breastfeeding duration, but not initiation or exclusive breastfeeding, in adolescent mothers (Wambach et al., 2011).\n\nComplying with Recommended Immunization Schedules\n\nHealth care providers and educational interventions delivered in health care settings play an important role in parents' immunization practices (Dunn et al., 1998; Hofstetter et al., 2015; Mergler et al., 2013; Vannice et al., 2011; Wallace et al., 2014; Yaqub et al., 2014). Such simple tools as patient reminders and health care providers talking to parents about vaccination are associated with higher rates of child immunization (Hofstetter et al., 2015; Szilagyi et al., 2000). Experimental studies indicate that moderately intensive interventions also are effective. In a cluster randomized trial, parents recruited from primary health care centers who received an information leaflet on the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and/or participated in a parent meeting addressing immunization experienced a decrease in decisional conflict regarding child immunization after receiving the intervention. Those who participated in the parent meeting were significantly more likely to have a fully vaccinated child than those who only received the information leaflet (Jackson et al., 2011). In another randomized trial, Dunn and colleagues (1998) found that videotape was more effective than written material in increasing parents' knowledge about immunization, but actual uptake of the practice was not measured. Little evidence exists on how to reduce parental refusal of vaccination (Sadaf et al., 2013).\n\nLimiting Screen Time\n\nNewer health interventions have focused on helping parents limit young children's screen time, such as the time they spend watching television and using computers and hand-held devices, including playing video games. As discussed in Chapter 2, limiting young children's screen time can reduce sedentary behavior associated with increased risk for future overweight (see also the discussion of overweight and obesity below) (Gable et al., 2007; Lumeng et al., 2006). In randomized controlled trials, family-based interventions designed to reduce screen time that include a parental component of medium to high intensity have been the most effective, and these programs appear to be most beneficial for preschool-age children (Marsh et al., 2014). Brief primary care interventions also may be effective. In an experimental study involving English- and Spanish-speaking parents, parents who watched a short video or received a handout on reducing children's exposure to television violence, compared with parents who received standard primary care, were more likely to report reductions in their children's media viewing habits and exposure to media violence 2 weeks postintervention. Parents who watched the brief video were slightly less likely to report a change in media viewing habits and slightly more likely to report a reduction in exposure to media violence relative to parents who received the handout (Aragon et al., 2013).\n\nHelping Children Avoid Overweight and Obesity\n\nThe rapid increase in the percentage of children who are considered overweight or obese in the United States (currently about 30%) has led to efforts to address the issue through multiple settings, including primary care (Taveras et al., 2011). Obesity in childhood often persists into adulthood and is related to a myriad of adverse health outcomes, including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, among others. Most health care settings with interventions related to child obesity focus on children who are already overweight or obese rather than on primary prevention. One systematic review found that only 8 of 31 randomized controlled trials in primary care demonstrated significant benefits with respect to child weight (Seburg et al., 2015). The review also noted that all of the interventions with positive outcomes—particularly those focused on young children—included a parent-targeted component. Newer research examining the role of motivational interviewing for parents of overweight children in primary care shows promising outcomes although this work is still in early development (Resnicow et al., 2015).\n\nReducing Environmental Tobacco Exposure\n\nOne of the most extensively evaluated interventions is cessation of tobacco for parents who smoke. In the United States, about 9 percent of women overall self-report smoking during pregnancy, and rates are much higher in some communities (Child Trends Databank, 2015). Tobacco use during pregnancy is associated with prematurity, growth restriction, and infant death. While the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not specifically target parents, it has issued Grade A recommendations that clinicians ask all adults and all pregnant women about tobacco use and provide counseling for smokers (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2009). Many tobacco cessation programs for parents also involve identifying smokers at well-child exams, in the hospital during delivery, and during postpartum care, although some of the longitudinal interventions take place in the home setting or via telephone. While several programs targeted to parents of young children focus on outpatient settings (Winickoff et al., 2003), there has been growing interest in hospital interventions targeting caregivers who smoke for cases in which children are hospitalized for tobacco-sensitive illnesses, such as asthma, other respiratory diseases, or infection (Chan et al., 2005; Ralston and Roohi, 2008).\n\nA systematic review identified 13 experimental and quasi-experimental studies on interventions designed to assist families of young children with smoking reduction and cessation (Brown et al., 2015). Ten of these studies were focused on reducing child exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and most of them found positive outcomes, such as use of household restrictions on smoking or less smoking. Approaches that focused on smoking cessation and relapse prevention among parents were less successful. However, the heterogeneity among the interventions reviewed prevented the authors from drawing firm conclusions about essential components associated with success (Brown et al., 2015). In a separate meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials of interventions aimed at preventing children's exposure to tobacco smoke delivered primarily in the context of health care (including such components as provision of educational materials, counseling, and telephone check-ins), a small but statistically significant benefit was noted based on parent self-report. Studies in which child biomarkers were collected showed lower exposure to tobacco smoke for those whose parents participated in the interventions, but these findings were not significant (Rosen et al., 2014). Finally, a novel approach to promoting cessation of tobacco use among parents through primary care is a pilot program that includes electronic health record prompts for exposure to tobacco smoke at well-child visits, as well as decision support, education, and a referral to the state quit hotline (Sharifi et al., 2014).\n\nEducating Caregivers on Normal Infant Crying\n\nTypically delivered by health care professionals, the Period of PURPLE Crying Program aims to educate caregivers about normal infant crying given where the infant is in his or her development and thereby prevent shaken baby syndrome/abusive head trauma. Caregivers learn that there is a unique developmental phase beginning at age 2 weeks through age 3-4 months during which infants may cry for hours despite efforts to soothe them, that shaking a baby can be fatal, and that alternatives (such as walking away) can be used instead (Barr, 2012; Reese et al., 2014). Even though this program is currently classified as promising by the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare, the concern about crying as a precursor to abuse (especially abusive head trauma) is supported by evidence showing that teaching parents about typical crying and how to respond effectively is beneficial. In one study, the program's approach was associated with a significant reduction in cases of infants ages 0-5 months who were brought to the emergency department primarily because of crying (with no other underlying medical condition) by 29.5 percent relative to before the program was implemented (Barr et al., 2015). The Period of PURPLE Crying Program has been or is in the process of being implemented in a number of health care facilities throughout the United States (National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome, 2013).\n\nPublic Education Approaches\n\nAs noted in Chapter 3, public education has increased general awareness of some positive parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices among parents and families. Some public education initiatives use media to disseminate information relevant to promoting parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices to a broad audience. An example is the universal component of the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program, referred to as Triple P level 1. (The full Triple P system is described in Chapter 5.) Triple P level 1 uses a coordinated media and communication strategy targeting all parents and other members of the community to destigmatize parents' seeking and participating in parenting support programs, counter parent-blaming messages in the media, and connect parents with supportive resources and programs. Messages are delivered using newsletters, brochures, posters, radio and televisions spots, and other media (Shapiro et al., 2015; Triple P-Positive Parenting Program, 2016a). A number of controlled evaluations have found that parents who participate in Triple P show improved quality of parenting compared with controls (Hoath and Sanders, 2002; Sanders et al., 2000; Turner and Sanders, 2006; Zubrick et al., 2005). To the committee's knowledge, however, no studies have evaluated the specific effects of Triple P level 1 in changing parenting-related knowledge, attitudes, or practices at the individual or community level.\n\nOther media efforts focused on parenting are organization driven. ZERO TO THREE, for example, is a nonprofit organization founded by experts in child development, health, and mental health that disseminates evidence-based parenting information nationwide. Based on the premise that children's earliest years are a period of substantial growth during which experiences can have lasting impacts, ZERO TO THREE has created a variety of resources to educate parents about how to nurture children during this important developmental stage. Tools include tip sheets, brochures, podcasts, and videos on a range of parenting-related topics, such as what parents should expect from their children given their age and steps parents can take at each developmental stage to help their children acquire various skills (e.g., language, communication, thinking, self-control); how to promote young children's social-emotional development and school readiness; and how to address challenging behaviors (ZERO TO THREE, 2015).\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has developed a number of parenting resources, including information on developmental milestones and parenting tips in such areas as creating structure and rules for children, using consequences, giving directions, and using time-out. Videos and other tools are designed to help parents practice these skills (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016).\n\nSeveral public health education campaigns in clinics and hospitals have proven successful. An example, reviewed in Chapter 3, is the Safe to Sleep campaign (previously known as Back to Sleep), which was thought to have played a significant role in reducing the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) over the past two decades (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015b). Much of the Safe to Sleep information is provided in hospital settings prior to postpartum discharge and in outpatient clinics. Similarly, use of media for wide dissemination of information about helmet safety, coupled with distribution of free and reduced-price helmets, in the National Safe Kids campaign is believed to have increased knowledge among parents about the importance of children wearing helmets during bicycling and other wheeled sports and increased children's helmet use (Morris et al., 1994; Rouzier and Alto, 1995). Other examples with documented success range from tobacco control, to seat belt use, to reduced use of illicit drugs (Hornik, 2002).\n\nThe literature on successful public health campaigns identifies characteristics conducive to success (Randolph and Viswanath, 2004). These include maximizing exposure to targeted messages among the audience; using social marketing tools to create the appropriate messages for distribution, drawing on “message effect” theories (Storey et al., 2008); and creating associated structural conditions, such as a supportive environment or opportunities to support the audience in making the recommended changes. The reach of the communication effort, as well as the campaign's intensity (e.g., how often individuals are exposed to the message), duration, and messaging approach and whether it is used in combination with other elements, also may influence the extent of its impact (Boles et al., 2014; Friend and Levy, 2002).\n\nLikewise, certain factors can reduce the success of public health campaigns. This is the case, for example, when individuals become confused or they develop distrust as a result of competing messages advocating behaviors inconsistent with or contradictory to those being promoted by a campaign (Carpenter et al., 2015; Nagler, 2014). Another characteristic of the contemporary information environment that presents a significant challenge to public health campaigns is the generation of a large body of information and data on a range of topics and the dissemination of such information on increasingly proliferating information delivery platforms (Viswanath et al., 2012). Also posing a challenge are differences among social groups in the generation, manipulation, and distribution of information at the group level and differences in access to and ability to take advantage of information at the individual level, a phenomenon characterized as communication inequalities (Viswanath, 2006).\n\nDespite these challenges, public health campaigns can be an effective tool for reaching a large and heterogeneous population at a much lower cost than many other forms of interventions. And information and communication technologies make it possible to customize and tailor information to the needs of the parents based on their background and social circumstances. The use of information and communication technologies is discussed further later in this chapter.\n\nInstruction in Parenting for Adolescents in the General Population\n\nPart of the committee's task was to describe “key periods of intervention that are more effective in supporting parenting capacity—beginning in high school or even earlier” (see Box 1-2 in Chapter 1). The committee interpreted this part of its task as including individuals of high school age and younger in the general population who are not pregnant or parents. (See Chapter 5 for a discussion of interventions for adolescent parents.) However, scarce scientific evidence supports the premise that informing individuals about the challenges of parenting during high school or earlier will help lower pregnancy rates or improve future parenting among those who do become parents. Evaluations of infant simulation programs, including the well-known “Baby Think it Over” (BTIO: now marketed by Realityworks as “RealCare Baby”), have not yet demonstrated a direct relationship between participating in such programs and reduced pregnancy rates or improved parenting.\n\nSome evidence from longitudinal research does point to a prospective association between perceived benefits of childbearing and subsequent pregnancy among young women wishing to avoid pregnancy (Rocca et al., 2013). Additional longitudinal data show that positive attitudes toward an adolescent birth may be predictive of a subsequent birth (Rosengard et al., 2004). The converse also may be true—that adverse attitudes toward adolescent parenting may be predictive of delayed childbearing, although this has not been shown.\n\nSome, but not unequivocal, evidence indicates that participating in BTIO resulted in changes in adolescents' perceptions with regard to the costs and rewards of adolescent parenting. For example, Somers (2013) used an experimental design and a 1-year follow-up with middle schoolers from low-income families in an urban district to test BTIO. The program instilled a more realistic perception of their lack of readiness among the BTIO groups; however, none of the other expected outcomes—changes in sexual behavior, contraceptive use, personal intentions to avoid teenage pregnancy, sexual attitudes, and actual pregnancy rates—was seen. Some of these effects could be due to the relatively low rate of sexual activity even after 1 year.\n\nRoberts and McCowan (2004) implemented a randomized controlled trial of an intervention combining the New York State parenting curriculum (which focused on reflection-based parenting skills with specific child care competencies) and exposure to BTIO, with the control group experiencing only the BTIO curriculum. Their findings, based on a sample of high school students in a rural community, show that the infant simulator is an effective tool for teaching child care skills in that the students more often expressed their belief that parenting is a skill that takes time and patience to learn, that teenagers cannot afford to raise a baby, that raising a child and continuing one's education is difficult, and that teenagers should abstain from sexual behaviors.\n\nHerrman and colleagues (2011) concluded that 79 teens in a single-group study using a pre- and post-test design showed no changes in perceptions following six weekly BTIO classes and a weekend infant simulator experience. The committee agrees with their conclusion that “until such a time as a multiple site, large sample, randomized study with control groups using a valid instrument to measure outcomes is conducted, the use of infant stimulators will remain controversial” (Herrman et al., 2011, p. 327). It is possible that the use of infant simulators as part of a more comprehensive pregnancy prevention program providing accurate information about both abstinence and contraception could change attitudes about becoming pregnant and encourage a reduction in unprotected sexual intercourse. Many effective pregnancy prevention programs do include exercises aimed at getting adolescents to consider the untoward impact on their lives if they become parents. Programs such as BTIO could reinforce this message, although this is not a known effect of the program. However, the committee found no direct evidence as to whether teaching youth in the general population about parenting has an impact on their future behavior as parents.\n\nCouple Relationship Education\n\nOver the past two decades, concerns about the state of family life in the United States have led to the creation of many general programs designed to strengthen couple relationships, prevent the emergence of conflict and violence, and increase fathers' positive involvement with their children. Generally characterized as couple relationship education (Cowan et al., 2010; Panter-Brick et al., 2014), these programs have focused primarily on improving couples' communication, although a very few, using clinically trained staff, also focus on parenting. Couple relationship education programs initially were targeted to middle-class couples early in their marriage and not already in marital or relationship distress. More recently, there have been efforts to provide services for couples that are at risk by virtue of low income but not otherwise identified as experiencing serious relationship difficulties.\n\nTwo relatively large-scale couple relationship education initiatives have been funded and evaluated by the federal government. Building Strong Families (Wood et al., 2014), which included three different couple relationship intervention approaches, was conducted across eight U.S. sites, with 5,102 low-income, unmarried couples being randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions. The couples were not identified as having specific relationship difficulties. The Supporting Healthy Marriage Program (Hsueh et al., 2012) was a randomized controlled trial involving 6,298 low-income married couples, expecting or with a child, at eight sites assigned randomly either to one of four couples-group programs plus a family support worker or to a no-treatment control condition. The results for Building Strong Families appear to be limited, although there is some evidence for a possible impact on conflict in low-income families. Self-report and observational measures suggest that the Supporting Healthy Marriage Program changed the way participants viewed their marriage, as well as the extent to which they were able to implement the skills taught by the program curricula (Cowan and Cowan, 2014).\n\nA number of smaller programs have shown evidence of success (Cowan and Cowan, 2014; Faircloth et al., 2011; Feinberg et al., 2010; Pinquart and Teubert, 2010). One of these programs (Supporting Father Involvement) works with parents about to have a child. A consistent body of research finds that marital satisfaction often decreases following the birth of a child, and marital conflict emerges or worsens. This program provides a 16-week group course to either the couple or just the father. Randomized controlled research involving several hundred families found reductions in parenting stress; stability in couples' relationship satisfaction; and stability or reductions in children's hyperactivity, social withdrawal, and psychological symptoms compared with families in a control group (Cowan and Cowan, 2000). Reduction in parents' violent problem solving was linked to reductions in children's aggression. In another randomized controlled trial involving parents of children entering kindergarten, positive effects were found on both mothers' and fathers' marital satisfaction and the children's adaptation (hyperactivity and aggression), according to their teachers (Cowan et al., 2011).\n\nWIDELY USED INTERVENTIONS\n\nBeyond the health care system, the most widely used approaches to strengthening and supporting parenting are home visiting programs; programs focused on helping parents provide cognitive stimulation in the home through educational activities involving reading, language, and math; efforts at providing parenting education in the context of classroom-based ECE programs; and efforts to increase parent engagement in school settings and school-related activities (prekindergarten through grade 3). These are usually voluntary programs aimed at enhancing parenting knowledge, skills, and practices; improving the parent-child relationship and the quality of parent-child interactions; improving children's school readiness and well-being; and preventing poor outcomes for children. The programs vary in their core features (e.g., requirements for staff training, number of sessions, cost to implement), target populations, and the amount of evidence of effectiveness available to guide policy and program decision making. Because these programs may cost several thousand dollars per participant per year, they often are targeted to those families considered to be in greatest need of additional support. Some programs, such as Head Start, require that families meet income requirements (e.g., a certain poverty level), and others, such as the home visiting program Durham Connects, are limited to individuals living within a specific geographic area. In addition, as described in Chapter 3, the actual numbers of families enrolled in these programs represent only a fraction of those who are eligible for them.\n\nHome Visiting Programs\n\nPrenatal, infant, and early childhood home visiting is a relationship-based mode of service delivery in which a professional or paraprofessional home visitor provides services in the family home using a prescribed home visiting model or curriculum. Home visiting programs have specific goals and range from truly universal programs for new parents in the community in which it is offered to targeted programs that select families based on important descriptive characteristics (e.g., first-time pregnant woman early in her pregnancy) or key risk factors. Across models, the home visitor's aims generally include supporting parents in their parenting role, facilitating positive parent-child interactions and relationships, reducing risks of harm, and promoting good parenting practices. Because the intervention is provided where families' daily lives take place, a potential benefit of home visiting is the ability to tailor services to meet families' specific needs (Johnson, 2009). Visits usually last 60 to 90 minutes and occur regularly over the course of 6 months to 2 years, with some long-term models serving families prenatally through age 5. These relatively intensive services usually are targeted to families with children at the highest risk for poor outcomes and those who are unlikely to enter kindergarten with the preacademic skills needed to make the most of formal schooling. Home visiting services generally are voluntary, although in some cases they may be court mandated (for example, in cases of child abuse and neglect). Although many home visiting programs target pregnant women and mothers, some include fathers in visits, and others provide separate visits for mothers and fathers (Sandstrom et al., 2015).\n\nThe roots of home visiting in the United States trace back to nurse and teacher home visiting in 19th-century England (Wasik and Bryant, 2001). The more than 250 home visiting programs implemented and studied at the state and local levels in the United States during the late 20th and early 21st centuries reflected those public health and education roots as well as an emphasis on prevention of child maltreatment (Boller et al., 2010; Paulsell et al., 2010). Programs focused on pregnant women and newborns often were run by public health departments and child welfare agencies, and those focused on ECE or on special education services often were run by a human service or education agency (Boller et al., 2010; Daro, 2006).\n\nIn fiscal year 2015, the federal home visiting program served about 145,500 parents and children in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 5 territories (Health Resources and Services Administration, 2016). There are also a number of state-based home visiting programs. In 2009, the most recent year for which the committee could find data, 40 states reported that they had state-based home visiting programs. Most states supported one or two models (Johnson, 2009), with 5 states reporting that they supported three or more, for a total of 70 state-based home visiting programs across the 40 states (Johnson, 2009). Over the past 20 years, the development of national home visiting programs with national offices and a support infrastructure for implementation has grown (Daro, 2011; Daro and Benedetti, 2014). States, counties, and municipalities around the country have implemented different models, some that are branded and have some evidence of effectiveness and some that are home grown and have not been evaluated (Johnson, 2009).\n\nHome Visiting Logic Model: Changing Parenting Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices to Improve Child Outcomes\n\nAs depicted by the prenatal and early childhood home visiting logic model in , some of the problems home visiting is designed to address include poor birth outcomes (low birth weight), child maltreatment, and lack of school readiness. Historically, funding agencies and communities that developed home visiting programs or selected from existing programs chose models that best suited the needs of the families they served and the particular outcomes they were trying to improve. Regardless of the specific mode, the underlying assumption of these programs is that the home is a comfortable, convenient setting for expectant parents and parents of young children to receive supports and services. As described below, a growing body of research points to the importance of high-quality implementation (such as collaboration among local public and private partners, program developers, and funders and oversight of service provision [training, quality assurance]) in achieving impacts on targeted knowledge, attitudes, and practices and child outcomes. Assuming an implementation system that brings families into services and provides high-quality visits as intended, targeted short-term outcomes include decreased parenting stress, depression, and isolation and improved parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices.\n\nFIGURE 4-1\n\nIllustrative prenatal and early childhood home visiting logic model. NOTE: HIV = home visiting; KAPs = knowledge, attitudes, and practices.\n\nAs depicted in , home visiting programs aim to support several evidence-based parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices identified in Chapter 2. Visits are designed to improve parents' knowledge of children's development and how adults can support children's exploration and learning. Some programs attempt to enhance parents' attitudes about their own efficacy in the parenting role, given that parents who do not believe they can be effective in supporting their child's development and learning may be unable to overcome that mind-set and engage fully in the home visits. Home visiting's primary pathway to the targeted long-term child outcomes is through improvements in the parent-child emotional relationship and the quality of parent-child interactions (e.g., how sensitive and responsive parents are when interacting with their young children). Other specific aims of programs may include increasing parents' use of positive guidance and decreasing their use of harsh punishment. Some programs target household and vehicular safety.\n\nThroughout this section, three home visiting models are profiled to illustrate how model activities are linked to outcomes and to highlight examples of the evidence for their impacts on parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices and child outcomes. Box 4-1 describes the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP)®, a model rooted in a public health approach for which multiple longitudinal impact studies have been conducted. Box 4-2 describes Parents as Teachers (PAT)®, a model with roots in ECE for which a number of studies exist. Finally, Durham Connects, described in Box 4-3, is one of the newer models, focused on universal strategies for ensuring that families receive the services they need, for which two studies were included in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) 2014 Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness (HomVee) review.3\n\nBOX 4-1\n\nNurse-Family Partnership (NFP).\n\nBOX 4-2\n\nParents as Teachers (PAT).\n\nHome Visiting and Evidence-Based Policy Making\n\nThe Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program, funded under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, changed the national home visiting landscape considerably by providing $1.5 billion in funding to states, territories, and tribal entities to serve very high-risk families. A distinctive feature of the legislation is its emphasis on research evidence as the basis for the home visiting models states could select (75% of funds had to be allocated to models with evidence of effectiveness [see below], and the other 25% could be used to fund models that were promising if they met certain criteria and states agreed to conduct a rigorous study). In addition, the legislation identified the specific outcome areas that had to be impacted by the selected programs and the performance measures on which the states would have to report each year, which included positive parenting practices and three child outcome areas—child health, child development and school readiness, and reductions in child maltreatment.4 A national evaluation is also under way to assess MIECHV implementation and impacts (Michalopoulos et al., 2013).\n\nBased on a systematic review of the evidence and the application of strict criteria for what counted as evidence (adapted in part from the U.S. Department of Education's What Works Clearinghouse), the HomVEE project team identified seven national models that met the HHS evidence criteria5 and to which 75 percent or more of funds had to be allocated (Paulsell et al., 2010): Early Head Start-Home Visiting (EHS-HV), Family Check-Up® for Children, Healthy Families America (HFA)®, Healthy Steps, Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY)®, NFP®, and PAT®. In a second HomVEE review, published in 2012, six more models that met the evidence criteria were identified: Child FIRST, Early Intervention Program for Adolescent Mothers (EIP), Early Start (New Zealand), Oklahoma's Community-Based Family Resource and Support (CBFRS) Program, Play and Learning Strategies-Infant (PALS Infant), and SafeCare® Augmented (Avellar et al., 2012). In 2014, 40 models were reviewed, and 4 more met the HHS criteria (Avellar et al., 2014): Durham Connects/Family Connects, Family Spirit®, Maternal Early Childhood Sustained Home-Visiting (MECSH) Program, and Minding the Baby®. Two additional models were included in a September 2015 update: the Health Access Nurturing Development Services (HANDS) Program and Healthy Beginnings (Avellar et al., 2015).\n\nshows the number of favorable primary positive parent and child outcomes compared with the total number of outcomes reviewed for all of the models reviewed in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2015.6 The table also notes where unfavorable or ambiguous outcomes were found.\n\nTABLE 4-1\n\nNumber of Favorable Impacts of Home Visiting for Primary Outcomes Compared with Total Number of Outcomes Reviewed for Models with Evidence of Effectiveness, by Outcome Domain.\n\nA Note on Program and Evaluation Logic\n\nIt is important to note that the logic of home visiting programs and their evaluations may not always align. As depicted in the generic home visiting logic model in , for example, parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices are among the hypothesized short-term outcomes en route to the longer-term outcome of child well-being. As seen in , positive parenting practices were not measured in the evaluations of some programs; however, this does not necessarily mean that parenting was not part of the program logic model. For example, the program description for Child FIRST states that parenting enhancements are expected as a result of the program, but parenting practices were not measured in the study that provided evidence of the program's effectiveness based on impacts on child outcomes (Lowell et al., 2011).\n\nHome Visiting Program Impacts\n\nIn addition to findings from the HomVEE review, this section draws on findings from a paper commissioned by the committee on evidence for investing in parenting programs at scale, which includes six programs that were not included in the HomVEE review. These programs have rigorous designs that differ from MIECHV in either program delivery approach or outcomes.7\n\nPositive parenting practices PALS Infant and NFP had the highest number of favorable impacts on parenting practices ( ). Across two studies, the HomVEE evidence review found 11 favorable impacts of PALS Infant on parenting behaviors such as contingent responsiveness and maintaining child foci, although it also found a negative impact on redirecting child foci (Landry et al., 2006, 2008). The HomVEE review identified favorable impacts of NFP on a number of parenting beliefs and practices, including cognitive stimulation in the home, reductions in dangerous exposures in the home, beliefs, worry, mother-infant interaction, and sensitive interaction across a number of studies (Kitzman et al., 1997; Olds et al., 1986, 1994). Among other models with impacts on parenting practices, the specific parenting outcomes affected within and across models vary, even for those programs that share a similar theoretical grounding or logic model.\n\nIn addition, as can be seen in for several programs, the number of outcomes for which no impacts were found is high, exceeding the number of outcomes for which significant impacts were found; moreover, impacts may have been found at one point of measurement but not another. For example, EHS-HV participants were no more likely than controls to report reading to their children every day at the end of the program. Two years after the program ended, however, participants were significantly more likely than controls to say that they read to their children daily (Jones Harden et al., 2012). Getting Ready, an add-on to EHS-HV that provides parents with additional training in effective engagement in routine activities that support child behavior and learning, showed changes in parent warmth, encouragement of autonomy, and supports for children's skills and appropriate guidance, but no changes in the quality of behavior supporting children's learning (Knoche et al., 2012). The effect of Getting Ready on child outcomes was not assessed.\n\nOverall, while many individual evaluations of home visiting programs have shown impacts on parenting practices tied to positive developmental outcomes, the average impacts of home visiting on parenting practices are not large. Nor is there a strong pattern of effects on parenting practices across evaluation studies and home visiting models.\n\nFamily economic self-sufficiency Relatively few home visiting programs target or measure effects of home visits on family economic self-sufficiency. The HomVEE review identified several studies in which participation in NFP was associated with reduced rates of subsequent childbearing (Kitzman et al., 1997; Olds et al., 2002, 2004) and lowered use of some forms of public assistance (Olds et al., 2010). In two impact studies, participation in HANDS was associated with significant increases in maternal receipt of WIC (Williams et al., 2014a, 2014b). Other models had positive effects on aspects of parents' self-sufficiency, such as reductions in rates of subsequent childbearing in Minding the Baby (Sadler et al., 2013). Taking into account secondary outcomes (i.e., those self-reported by means other than a standardized instrument), Early Head Start and EIP showed improvements in parents' receipt of education and training (Jones Harden et al., 2012; Koniak-Griffin et al., 2000; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al., 2001, 2002).\n\nChild health Several programs, including EIP, Durham Connects (Box 4-3), HANDS, and NFP have had favorable impacts on child health, with some consistent findings across studies. Effects for measures of infant health, such as fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits, were found for both EIP and Durham Connects (Dodge et al., 2013; Koniak-Griffin et al., 2002, 2003). Participation in HANDS was associated with reductions in preterm births and low birth weight across studies (Williams et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2014c). Two programs included not in the HomVEE review but in the commissioned paper—Rest Routine and the MOM Program—showed impacts on child health. Rest Routine, which focuses on reducing infant irritability or colic, a hypothesized precursor to child maltreatment, was found to reduce the number of hours of child crying and some aspects of parenting stress (Keefe et al., 2006a, 2006b). The MOM Program provides up to 11 home visits to encourage care for the health and development of the baby and use of well-child care and early intervention services if needed (Schwarz et al., 2012). The program had an impact on use of early intervention services, but no differences were seen in rates of developmental delays or cognitive outcomes. Parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices were not assessed.\n\nChild development and school readiness Family Spirit, HFA, PAT, Child FIRST, and NFP showed the greatest number of favorable impacts on child development and school readiness in the HomVEE review, although there were many null effects for each of these programs. Three programs showed clear evidence of effectiveness: Child FIRST (effects on externalizing problems and language problems [Lowell et al., 2011]); HFA (effects on some behavioral and academic outcomes in at least in two of the three trials in which child outcomes were measured [Caldera et al., 2007; Kirkland and Mitchell-Herzfeld, 2012]); and NFP (but only based on longer-term followup [Eckenrode et al., 2010; Kitzman et al., 2010; Olds et al., 2004]). In the commissioned paper, the University of California at Los Angeles Family Development Project is identified as improving child behavior but not cognitive skills (Heinicke et al., 2001). Minding the Baby (Sadler et al., 2013) also demonstrated evidence of efficacy but only for the child's security of attachment, which may or may not translate to long-term benefits (other behavioral and academic skills were not measured in the study of that program).\n\nEffects were less clear for the EHS-HV model (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al., 2002), with effects being found only on parent-reported child behavioral measures and only at a later follow-up point (and no effects on cognitive skills being found at any time point). Both trials of Family Spirit showed mixed findings across parent-reported behavioral outcomes, including significant reductions in externalizing problems but not in many other similar behaviors (Barlow et al., 2013; Walkup et al., 2009); academic skills were not measured here. Effects of Healthy Steps on children were not evaluated during the intervention, and no effects were found 2 years after the intervention (Minkovitz et al., 2001, 2007).\n\nReductions in child maltreatment Of the programs reviewed by HomVEE, NFP showed the greatest number of favorable impacts on child maltreatment. The program had effects on hospitalizations for accidents and injuries and involvement in child protective services (CPS) in some sites and follow-ups, but not consistently across sites and studies (Administration for Children and Families, 2015b). There is also evidence of effects of Child FIRST on reductions in CPS involvement and general child maltreatment (Lowell et al., 2011). The review found improvements in measures of child maltreatment for other programs as well (e.g., HANDS and PAT).\n\nHome Visiting Collaborative for Improvement and Innovation Network\n\nMary Catherine Arbour, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, was invited to present before the committee at one of its open sessions on lessons learned in continuous quality improvement from the Home Visiting Collaborative for Improvement and Innovation Network (HV CoIIN). The HV CoIIN is operated by the Education Development Center, Inc., with funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Dr. Arbour is the Improvement Advisor for this national initiative that supports the work of a set of MIECHV state grantees. HV CoIIN aims to achieve improvement in outcomes in four areas targeted by home visiting programs: breastfeeding, maternal depression, family engagement, and child development.\n\nHV CoIIN uses the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Breakthrough Series Collaborative Model (Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2003), which combines the Model for Improvement and a structured, time-limited collaborative learning model. This model is designed to close the gap between what is known from science about what works and what is happening on the ground to achieve results and facilitate the implementation of improved programs (Arbour, 2015). The collaborative's first step is to select a topic that has a good evidence base but is not always applied in practice. Faculty are recruited to develop a framework and set of changes expected to improve service quality and outcomes, and teams are then formed to participate in the collaborative (including leadership, front-line workers, and end-users). These teams test changes and adapt them to specific contexts, collect data on a number of indicators over time to demonstrate improvement, and share experiences to facilitate learning (Arbour, 2015). HV CoIIN is using this approach to build a culture of inquiry and improvement and enhance the implementation of improvements across a number of the home visiting models included in the MIECHV Program and across the participating states.\n\nHV CoIIN is the first national initiative to apply continuous quality improvement (CQI) methods to evidence-based home visiting programs to improve critical outcomes for vulnerable families with young children ages 0-5. Participating home visiting teams receive training and coaching in the basic quality improvement skills of rapid-cycle hypothesis testing and data use based on the Model for Improvement. The model uses three questions to guide teams to set short-term specific aims: (1) “What are we trying to accomplish?” asks them to define aims specific to their context; (2) “What ideas do we have that can result in improvement?” asks them to use their own ideas to make home visiting work in their specific setting; and (3) “How will we know that a change is an improvement?” asks them to collect and use data to determine how well those ideas work to advance their aims. Drawing on the manufacturing and business sector, teams then subject their ideas to small, rapid-cycle testing using Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA).\n\nIn addition to applying the Model for Improvement in their local work, the CQI teams apply the Breakthrough Series Collaborative Model by participating in three “Learning Sessions” that bring together local teams, expert faculty, and stakeholders (including model developers and state leaders). Between Learning Sessions, CQI teams test changes in their local settings and gather data to measure the effect of those changes during 4- to 6-month-long “Action Periods.” At the first Learning Session, expert faculty presented a vision for home visiting quality and specific changes proposed by HV CoIIN, and CQI teams learned about the Model for Improvement and PDSA cycles. At the second and third Learning Sessions, teams learned from one another as they reported on successes, barriers, and lessons learned in formal presentations, workshops, and informal dialogue and exchange.\n\nParticipants in HV CoIIN commit to pursuing shared aims and to reporting a set of shared measures. Every month, data are displayed on run charts and shared transparently across the collaborative and with state and local representatives to facilitate shared learning and rapid diffusion of good ideas.\n\nThe mission of HV CoIIN is to achieve breakthrough improvements in selected process and outcome measures, including benchmark areas legislatively mandated for the federal MIECHV Program, while reducing or maintaining program costs. Its mission also includes developing the means to diffuse the learning and improvements resulting from its efforts more widely within participating organizations and to other MIECHV grantees and home visiting agencies. During its first phase (May 2014-August 2015), the collaborative enrolled 12 states and tribes and 33 home visiting agencies using five evidence-based home visiting models serving 3,500 families. HV CoIIN integrates CQI methodologies into existing evidence-based home visiting programs with the goal of disseminating practices known to work, innovating, achieving results more rapidly, building leaders in quality improvement and sustainability in home visiting, and demonstrating the effectiveness of home visiting in large-scale implementation.\n\nInitial data indicate that the learning and improvements resulting from the HV CoIIN efforts have enabled agencies and staff to change their practices so as to affect behaviors in ways that are associated with quality improvements that support outcomes targeted by the collaborative (Arbour, 2015). The collaborative's approach shows promise as a way to work with staff in programs that target parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices, and has been used in a variety of other health and related fields, including efforts focused on reducing infant mortality (McPherson et al., 2015; Selk et al., 2015).\n\nPrograms Promoting Parent Educational Activities in the Early Home Learning Environment\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, in recent years there has been increased attention to parent behaviors that are associated with children's cognitive development as well as social-emotional skills. Designing interventions that generate large impacts on parent practices in promoting children's cognitive skills has proved difficult. Two large meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have included evaluations of parent skills training in relation to children's cognitive outcomes. One found that parent training in promoting children's cognitive, academic, and social skills was associated with smaller effects relative to parent training programs that did not include those components (Kaminski et al., 2008). The other found that interventions for new and expecting at-risk parents that focus on the promotion of children's cognitive development (e.g., teaching parents how to use stimulating materials) generate small to very small effects on various noncognitive childhood outcomes, including parent-child relations (Pinquart and Teubert, 2010).\n\nThere is, however, some experimental research suggesting that interventions designed to promote parents' provision of stimulating learning experiences do support children's cognitive development, primarily on measures of language and literacy. Intensive parent training in the home or a community setting provided by coaches who visit parents frequently (as often as weekly) have been shown to increase responsive and developmentally stimulating parenting and, in turn, children's early achievement and positive social behavior. Evidence-based models of this approach include Play and Learning Strategies (PALS) (Landry et al., 2006, 2008, 2012); My Baby and Me (which used the PALS curriculum for responsive parenting plus additional training on such topics as developmental milestones, health and safety, and literacy) (Guttentag et al., 2014); Let's Play in Tandem (Ford et al., 2009); the Head Start Research-based Developmentally Informed Parent (REDI-P) Program (Bierman et al., 2015); and the Getting Ready for School Program (Noble et al., 2012).\n\nIn PALS and My Baby and Me, parents of infants are coached during 90-minute in-home sessions on contingent responsiveness, joint engagement, interactive communication, and emotional support for their children. Multiple randomized trials of these programs have indicated increased contingent responsiveness, verbal stimulation, and warmth from socially disadvantaged mothers and, in turn, later improvements in children's receptive and/or expressive language skills and complexity of play, as well as more prosocial play with their mothers and fewer behavior problems (Guttentag et al., 2014; Landry et al., 2006, 2008, 2012). It is worth noting, however, that while My Baby and Me produced gains for mothers and children when administered from 4 to 30 months of age, PALS administered during the toddler years produced more positive outcomes for children than it did during infancy alone or across both infancy and toddlerhood. Let's Play in Tandem (Ford et al., 2009) and REDI-P have (Bierman et al., 2015) demonstrated effectiveness in randomized controlled trials with respect to parent engagement during the preschool years, at ages 3 and 4-5, respectively. For Let's Play in Tandem, weekly home visits for 1 year were used to train parents in how to engage children in activities designed to promote vocabulary, emergent literacy, and numeracy skills, as well as self-regulation. Although changes in parenting behaviors were not examined following treatment, significant child-level effects included improved vocabulary, literacy, numeracy, and general academic skills, as well as inhibitory control and social-behavioral skills. For REDI-P, parent training during home visits was focused primarily on developing parenting skills directed at children's social-emotional, self-regulatory, and literacy outcomes, including how to better engage in literacy-based play and learning activities that support children's learning skills and motivation. The intervention improved the richness of parent-child conversations and interactive reading activities. When the children entered kindergarten, significant differences between treatment and control groups included better self-directed learning, literacy skills, and academic performance for those whose parents had received the trainings (Bierman et al., 2015).\n\nAlthough generally less intensive than the other in-home and workshop trainings discussed above, several dialogic reading interventions (Arnold et al., 1994; Lonigan and Whitehurst, 1998; Whitehurst et al., 1988, 1994) have been designed to increase parents' engagement with their children during storybook reading by training them to ask open-ended questions, respond to and encourage children's comments and interests, and teach children vocabulary. Experimental evaluations of these interventions have shown them to be effective for improving literacy or language outcomes (e.g., expressive language skills), although these effects appear to be limited to immediately after the end of the intervention and may be most pronounced when complemented by similar interventions within child care/preschool. Similarly, programs designed to tutor parents in reading effectively with their children have demonstrated short-term but not long-term improvements in children's literacy (Mehran and White, 1988). Notably, in these dialogic reading interventions, there is some evidence that video-based instruction and modeling that is complemented by discussion with parents is effective for training parents to better engage in their children's early learning (Arnold et al., 1994; Whitehurst et al., 1988).\n\nThere are several other programs with some evidence of impact. In one randomized controlled study, interactions between high-risk parents and their children over developmentally stimulating, age-appropriate learning material (e.g., a book or a toy) followed by review and discussion between parents and child development specialists, were found to improve children's cognitive and language skills at 21 months compared with a control group, and also reduced parental stress (Mendelsohn et al., 2005). In another experimental study, children of mothers who watched a series of short films on talking to children, using praise, using bath time to learn, and looking at books and puzzles, among other topics, followed by discussion with community health workers to encourage mothers to practice the activities with their children, showed significant benefits on measures of cognitive development predictive of academic achievement compared with controls (Chang et al., 2015).\n\nLanguage interventions for parents of children with developmental disabilities and delays also have shown an impact. An 18-study meta-analysis found that language interventions implemented by parents had a significant and positive effect on the development of receptive and expressive language skills in children ages 18-60 months with and without intellectual disabilities (Roberts and Kaiser, 2011). In another randomized controlled study, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, which targets child behavior problems through mother's use of child-directed play, improved language production among children ages 20 to 70 months with and at risk of developmental delays compared with a control group (Garcia et al., 2015).\n\nIn the Getting Ready for School intervention (Noble et al., 2012), 2-hour weekly workshops with parents over a 15-week period were used to complement existing Head Start teacher-parent workshops for families of children in randomly selected intervention classrooms. The complementary workshops, led by a trained facilitator, focused on teaching parents how to engage with their children at home in activities focused on literacy (e.g., helping their children learn the letters in their names), language (e.g., learning how to ask questions of their children), and math (e.g., helping their children recognize and extend patterns). Although parenting behaviors were not measured, compared with children in comparison classrooms, children of parents in the intervention evidenced improved language and literacy as well as applied problem and math concept scores.\n\nThere is also some evidence that aligning home learning contexts for literacy with early elementary school literacy learning is valuable, at least for increasing the frequency of literacy activities in the home of socially disadvantaged children. The Family Literacy Program (Morrow and Young, 1997), for example, encouraged parents to create home centers for parent-child literacy activities that paralleled 1st- to 3rd-grade classroom centers, while also encouraging reading daily, sharing stories, and writing journals together. Parents were guided through monthly group meetings and one-on-one mentorship. In an experimental study, according to parents and children, in-home literacy activities increased in the intervention group relative to controls, and teacher-rated literacy ability and interest improved, although no improvements were evident on a standardized reading assessment.\n\nThere is also evidence that transmedia interventions—focused on media content delivered across multiple platforms (e.g., videos, online games, and apps)—can be used to promote parent engagement in the home. From 2010 to 2015, the U.S. Department of Education supported the Ready to Learn initiative, a series of descriptive and experimental studies on parent-caregiver outcomes in supporting children's cognitive (literacy and math) engagement and social-emotional skills. A randomized controlled evaluation study, Supporting Parent-Child Experiences with PEG+CAT Early Math Concepts, conducted by SRI International, addressed the question of how time spent viewing and playing with PBS KIDS educational, noncommercial media at home, in family settings, can foster positive outcomes for children and parents/caregivers (Moorthy et al., 2014). Using videos, online games, and tablet-based apps that allowed caregivers and children to engage with PEG+CAT characters, parents and caregivers in the treatment group reported a higher frequency of joint parent-child use of technology, more joint gameplay, and more conversation connecting digital media and daily life than did nontreatment parents and caregivers. In addition, the study report indicates that children participating in the intervention exhibited statistically significant improvements in the mathematics skill areas of ordinal numbers, spatial relationships, and 3-D shapes compared with children in the nontreatment group. Important study limitations, however, included reliance on parent self-reports, selection bias, and inadequate assessments targeted by the study experience.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting recent findings indicating that information about the importance of engaging in children's learning may not be enough to achieve meaningful behavioral changes among parents. In a randomized field experiment of the Parent and Children Together Program (Mayer et al., 2015)—a 6-week intervention with English- and Spanish-speaking parents of children enrolled in Head Start programs—three behavioral tools were employed (text reminders, goal setting, and social rewards), and parents were provided with information about the importance of reading to children. Findings indicated large increases in usage of a reading app after the 6-week intervention with increases due to the behavioral tools rather than the increased information.\n\nParenting Education Delivered in the Context of Classroom-Based Early Care and Education Programs\n\nECE programs provide full- or part-time classroom-based services (center or family child care) for children from birth to age 5. They often include parenting education and other services for families (sometimes starting prenatally) designed to improve the overall circumstances of families and promote parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices that support children's cognitive and social-emotional development and success in school (Brooks-Gunn et al., 2000; Chase-Lansdale and Brooks-Gunn, 2014; Fantuzzo et al., 2013; Seitz, 1990). ECE programming that involves parents can be structured in several different ways, including (1) comprehensive two-generation programs with components that include multipronged, intensive classroom-based services for children, parenting education, and parent self-sufficiency support (as in Head Start, Early Head Start, and Educare); (2) primarily classroom-based services for children with some parenting education services; and (3) primarily classroom-based services for children with some parent self-sufficiency services.\n\nThe logic behind ECE programming that involves parents is the potential for additive effects for the child and family. Children's positive experiences in care can have a direct effect on their outcomes, and if parenting education or parent self-sufficiency outcomes also are achieved, additional benefits may accrue. However, coupling ECE programs with parenting components does entail costs, and with a fixed budget it is difficult to maintain high-quality efforts on both components. Indeed, a meta-analysis showed significant effects of preschool education on children's cognitive and social development but found that provision of additional services tended to be associated with smaller gains (Camilli et al., 2010). Thus, it is important to identify two-generation models likely to generate benefits that justify their added expense and administrative complications.\n\nThis section summarizes findings from studies evaluating how ECE programs support parenting and healthy child development. The committee was unable to identify clearinghouses or reviews of classroom-based ECE programs that included parenting supports and thus drew on rigorous studies published in the peer-reviewed literature. Note that the discussion in this section excludes approaches used in the early intervention/special education system.\n\nHead Start and Early Head Start\n\nHead Start and Early Head Start are rigorously evaluated two-generation programs. (A brief description of both programs and numbers of families served can be found in Chapter 3.) In addition to education services directed at children, Head Start and Early Head Start programs are required to provide parents with activities that may include (1) parenting education, including at least two home visits per year whereby teachers give parents information about their children's current classroom activities; (2) group parenting support classes on topics of interest to parents; and (3) opportunities to volunteer in the child's classroom (Administration for Children and Families, 2016). Parent policy councils and center committees also provide opportunities for parents to participate in program leadership. Services are intended to be responsive to the needs and cultural and linguistic heritage of families in the communities served (Administration for Children and Families, 2016).\n\nParental engagement and service take-up, which have become a focus of attention because of the cost of nonparticipation and the potential impact of nonengagement on school readiness outcomes, are far from 100 percent (Administration for Children and Families, 2015d).8 Recent data show that just 41 percent of parents whose children were enrolled in Head Start attended parenting classes, although this percentage was 14 percent higher than that for control group parents. Attendance at goal-setting classes also was significantly higher for Head Start than for non-Head Start parents, but take-up rates for nutrition, income, housing, utilities, education and job training assistance programs did not differ significantly between parents who won and lost lotteries for their children to enter the Head Start Program to which they had applied. Parents' participation in the programs offered by Early Head Start was higher than was the case for Head Start parents, and almost always significantly higher for Early Head Start parents than for their control group counterparts (based on full-sample estimates) (Auger, 2015).\n\nHead Start impacts on knowledge, attitudes, and practices and child outcomes Puma and colleagues (2012) provide a random-assignment evaluation of parenting impacts in the National Head Start Impact Study. Parenting-related measures included disciplinary practices, educational supports, parenting styles, parent participation in and communication with the school, and parent and child time together. Two cohorts of children (those entering Head Start for the first time at ages 3 and 4) were analyzed separately.\n\nLooking first at impacts at the end of the Head Start year, in no case did any of the parenting measures differ significantly for the two cohorts of children. Practices for which significant impacts were found for only one cohort included an unexpected negative impact on the amount of time parents reported reading to their children (for the 3-year-old cohort) and beneficial impacts on spanking, reading, and cultural enrichment for the 4-year-old cohort. None of the beneficial impacts found at the end of the Head Start year persisted across the kindergarten, 1st-, and 3rd-grade follow-ups, and in no case did safety practices differ significantly between the Head Start and control groups. For the 4-year-old cohort, only 1 of 28 parenting impacts emerged as statistically significant (time spent with child in 3rd grade). For the 3-year-old cohort, there was some indication that parenting styles were more authoritative (characterized by high warmth and control) and less authoritarian for the Head Start group, although these patterns were seen in less than one-half of the tests conducted. Overall, despite the program's stated goals of improving parenting, the Head Start evaluation found virtually no consistent evidence that this goal was achieved.\n\nWith respect to child outcomes, both cohorts showed statistically significant impacts on children's language and literacy development while they were in Head Start, although these effects dissipated when children reached elementary school. By the end of 3rd grade, the only favorable impact was on reading, and this was only for the 4-year-old cohort. Results in the social-emotional domain differed by both cohort and source of information. In the 3-year-old cohort, early favorable impacts on social-emotional measures (problem behaviors, social skills) were sustained through 3rd grade based on parent-reported measures, but data reported by teachers suggested no impacts on social-emotional outcomes in either the kindergarten or 1st-grade year. No social-emotional impacts were observed in the 4-year-old cohort through kindergarten, while favorable impacts were reported by parents and unfavorable impacts by teachers at the end of the 1st and 3rd grades. There was strong evidence of improved receipt of dental care at the end of the Head Start year in both cohorts (Puma et al., 2012).\n\nOne of the challenges of programs that include both direct and indirect pathways to child outcomes is the inability to assess the extent to which observed impacts are the result of any one component of the intervention. It is impossible to know in this case whether the parenting impacts noted (scattered as they were) had any role in the observed impacts on child outcomes. Nonexperimental analyses could provide exploratory answers to these types of questions.\n\nEarly Head Start center-based impacts on knowledge, attitudes, and practices and child outcomes Evidence of the impact of Early Head Start on parenting comes from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project, a large-scale randomized evaluation following 3,001 children and families in 17 community sites. Sites delivered services primarily through home visits (discussed in the previous section), center-based services, or a mixed program approach whereby families received home visiting and/or center-based services (Love et al., 2005; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al., 2002).\n\nA random-assignment evaluation of Early Head Start in four center-based programs found one positive impact of the program on the quality of parent-child play when the children were age 3 and one negative impact on parent knowledge of how to use a car seat correctly (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al., 2002). Mothers in the Early Head Start group reported lower levels of severe depression and were more likely than controls to be employed or in an education or training program. Overall, none of the other many parenting, parent well-being, home, and self-sufficiency outcomes studied was affected by Early Head Start among the families in the center-based sites. With regard to child outcomes at age 3, children in the Early Head Start group were less likely to show negativity toward their parent during a parent-child play task. There were no other impacts on child outcomes for the Early Head Start center-based group.\n\nIn sites using the mixed approach (center-based and/or home visiting services), families would in some cases receive home visiting services when they started in the program and then transition to center-based services when their children were older and the mother went to work. At age 3 and beyond, analysis indicated that among the three service delivery approaches, sites employing the mixed approach tended to have the greatest concentration of impacts with respect to both parenting and child outcomes (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al., 2002). These findings may have implications for the need for increased flexibility in programming that allows families to shift from one mode of service delivery to another as their needs change.\n\nSmaller-Scale Classroom-based ECE Interventions\n\nOther classroom-based ECE programs that include parenting supports also have some evidence of effectiveness and provide insights into ways to reach parents. Effective interventions target improving parents' engagement in preschool/elementary school, as well as parents' roles as collaborators with teachers in decision making about children's academic experiences. In some cases, these targets are complemented by attempts to improve alignment between home and classroom learning contexts.\n\nThe Companion Curriculum, for example, uses Head Start teachers to encourage parents' participation in the classroom and provide workshops and activity spaces in the classroom that are focused on training parents to engage in parent-child learning activities. Although the program did not demonstrate benefits for parents' involvement in the classroom or general engagement in home learning activities, it led to increased frequency of parent-child reading and improved children's vocabulary in a quasi-experimental study (Mendez, 2010).\n\nThe Kids in Transition to School (KITS) Program is a short-term, targeted, evidence-based intervention aimed at increasing early literacy, social skills, and self-regulatory skills among children who are at high risk for school difficulties. This program provides a 24-session readiness group for children that promotes social-emotional skills and early literacy as well as a 12-session parent workshop focused on promoting parent involvement in early literacy and the use of positive parenting practices. In a pilot efficacy trial with 39 families, Pears and colleagues found that children in families who received the KITS intervention demonstrated early literacy and social skill improvements as compared with their peers who did not receive the intervention (Pears et al., 2014). In randomized controlled studies, foster children who received the intervention exhibited improvements in social competence, self-regulation skills, and early literacy skills (Pears et al., 2007, 2012, 2013).\n\nTwo-Generation Approaches\n\nOne class of early intervention programs uses a two-generation approach with an explicit focus on human capital skill building. As described by Chase-Lansdale and Brooks-Gunn (2014, p. 14), these programs “intentionally link education, job training, and career-building services for low-income parents simultaneously with early education for their young children.”\n\nEarly versions of these kinds of two-generation programs focused on adolescent mothers, providing them with a host of education- and job-related services. Developed during a time when the nation was focusing on welfare reform and had not begun to appreciate the potential of high-quality early childhood education programs with respect to skill building for children, these programs typically viewed child care services as a means of supporting the self-sufficiency efforts of mothers rather than promoting the school readiness of their children.\n\nFour prominent programs conducted during the 1980s and 1990s (Project Redirection, the New Chance Demonstration, Ohio's Learning and Earning Program, and the Teen Parent Demonstration) offered adolescent mothers a wide range of services, including, in some cases, parenting classes, job training, and mandatory schooling (Granger and Cytron, 1999; Polit, 1989). Project Redirection was the earliest. It offered education and training programs for low-income adolescent mothers combined with intensive support services that included individual counseling, training in parenting and employability skills, and referrals to community services. Its evaluation, which was not based on random assignment, showed virtually no differences in parents' education or training but some promising improvements in the quality of their children's home environments and early literacy and behavior (Polit, 1989).\n\nEvaluations of the other three programs were based on random assignment and showed a less positive set of impacts (Granger and Cyrton, 1999). In terms of parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices, the New Chance Demonstration provided parenting education designed to promote positive parenting practices and better mother-child relationships and to reduce the stresses associated with parenthood. The Teen Parent Demonstration also included parenting workshops. The effects of these programs on mothers were not very promising, with virtually no impacts being seen on educational advances (New Chance increased GED holding, possibly at the expense of high school diplomas) or on mothers' earning, employment, or welfare participation. Maternal mental health was assessed in evaluations of New Chance and the Teen Parent Demonstration, but in neither case did the program improve scores on the mental health measures employed. Moreover, mothers in the New Chance Demonstration experimental group reported significantly more parenting stress relative to their control counterparts.\n\nConsistent with the view of child care as merely a support for the mother's employment and education activities, none of these three programs affected any of the assessed dimensions of children's school readiness. In fact, New Chance mothers reported higher rates of child behavioral problems relative to their control group counterparts.\n\nAnother example of a rigorously evaluated comprehensive two-generation program was the Comprehensive Child Development Program (CCDP). Developed in the 1990s, this program was an ambitious attempt to provide low-income families with a range of social services designed to support infants' and children's cognitive, social-emotional, and physical development, as well as to enhance parents' ability to support their children's development and achieve economic and social self-sufficiency (St. Pierre et al., 1997). Services were intended to extend from birth through kindergarten or 1st grade but, in contrast to Head Start and some Early Head Start programs, were not built on a high-quality classroom-based program for children. The comprehensive nature of CCDP services is reflected in the program's cost, which amounted to $15,768 per family per year, or about $47,000 per family over the entire course of the program (St. Pierre et al., 1997). (In 2014 dollars, this amounts to approximately $23,250 per family per year, or nearly $70,000 per family over the entire course of the program.)9\n\nCCDP service delivery relied heavily on case managers and appeared to be implemented effectively (St. Pierre et al., 1997). For children, the program supported and in fact increased parents' use of center-based child care, although evaluators did not systematically assess the quality of this care. Most sites offered biweekly home visits by a case manager or early childhood specialist between birth and age 3 in which training was provided to parents on infant and child development and, in some cases, modeling of ways to interact with children. Results of CCDP's random-assignment evaluation 5 years after the program began showed no statistically significant impacts on parenting skills or self-sufficiency among participating mothers or on the cognitive or social-emotional development of participating children (St. Pierre et al., 1997). Nor did consistent impacts emerge for any demographic subgroups or among the families that participated in the program for most of the service period. Evaluators speculated that the lack of impacts may have b"
