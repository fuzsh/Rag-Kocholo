She pretends I'm invisible,\" Kenya revealed on her Bravo blog.[7] Moore graduated from Cass Technical High School in 1989.[8] While still in high school, Moore experienced domestic violence from a much older boyfriend. In Moore's words, \"He tormented me physically, mentally and once even nearly killed me by putting me into the hospital, from attacking me with a finger nail file… stabbing me with a finger nail file.\"[9] Moore attended Wayne State University, where she majored in psychology and minored in communication.[10]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nModeling and pageants\n\n[edit]\n\nMoore began modeling at the age of 14, and was the January 1992 cover girl for Ebony Man magazine.[11] She also modelled for the Ebony Fashion Fair cosmetic line.
