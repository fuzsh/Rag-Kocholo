        "text": "TLC had quite a year with the release of their VH1 biopic, CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, which broke record ratings as the highest-rated cable movie this year with 4.5 million viewers. It also became VH1’s strongest-performing original to date.\n\nThe film, directed by Drumline‘s Charles Stone III, stars Keke Palmer, Drew Sidora and Lil Mama (nee Niatia Jessica Kirkland) as the iconic trio, shining light on their troubled past amidst groundbreaking success as well as their future, as the remaining members, Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas, will have 10 brand-new finished tracks for their next album.\n\nThe R&B group is one of the most successful female trios the business has ever seen and their backstory — complete with life-threatening illness, bankruptcy and tragedy — is as compelling as their unprecedented rise to fame.\n\nPHOTOS: American Music Awards: Lady Gaga, Katy Perry Step Out on Red Carpet\n\nT-Boz and Chilli took the stage to perform their 1995 hit, “Waterfalls,” on Sunday night with rapper Lil Mama in place of the late Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, who died in a car accident in 2002.\n\nAfter the show, they took time to set the record straight on the recent rumors that they had been dropped from their label, Epic Records. “No, we weren’t,” said Chilli. “L.A. Reid set it straight. He got on Twitter.”\n\nT-Boz chalked it up to the gossip-loving media: “You know how the press is and one person starts it and it gets in the stratosphere and they run with it.”\n\nThe girls have been fighting that rumor mill since the movie premiered and ruffled the feathers of Perri “Pebbles” Reid and her children for what they claimed was an inaccurate portrayal of greed. The singers said they have come full circle after rejoining forces with L.A. Reid, despite their tumultuous past with the infamous music man.\n\n“At the time it really did feel like that,” said Chilli. “We were so happy so many people watched the movie and they got a chance to see a lot of stuff we went through and where we are today.”"
