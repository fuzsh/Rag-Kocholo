        "text": "It's Time To Reboot \"The Real Housewives Of Atlanta.\" You May Not Like It, But You Know I'm Right\n\nOver the last three years, Real Housewives of Atlanta seems to have taken a decline not only in ratings but also in the audience’s reaction to the once-hit show. Let’s get into what went wrong, and why a reboot may be the only saving grace.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta is one of the most iconic reality shows of all time. From its premiere in 2008, the hilarious antics, the powerful personal stories, and the best shade we’ve ever seen in the history of television itself, RHOA has made its mark in television history. However, over the last three years, the show seems to have taken a decline not only in ratings but also in the audience’s reaction to the once-hit show.\n\n1. The show has lost major players over the years.\n\n2. The current group is disjointed. I don't see them being actual friends outside the show.\n\n3. The same antics have been going on for seasons, and frankly I'm over it.\n\n4. There never seems to be a resolution anymore, and I don't know if these ladies care about that or not.\n\n5. Perhaps a bit controversial, but the production team is holding the show back...A LOT.\n\nSo, ultimately, this is why I think a reboot of the show is needed.\n\nAfter seeing the greatness that The Real Housewives of Miami reboot gave us, I feel like it’s only right that RHOA gets the same treatment. A reboot could bring a new audience to show, while also reinventing what RHOA is about. We need new graphics and different shots of Atlanta so we can know more about the city. Let’s see the girls shopping, or going out to social events that give us a glimpse into what ATL is about. That is a rarity on the show nowadays.\n\nSo...here's what a reboot would look like to me.\n\nWhat’s fun about a reboot is that the overall direction of the show could change.\n\nFirst, I would put the show on pause for about a year or so just to figure everything out and give the show a bit of a breather. Secondly, I would move RHOA to Peacock. This would mainly be to revitalize the show and introduce it to newer audiences. I would love to see the show take a more fun yet sophisticated approach. Let’s see women of Atlanta who have made their mark and have an actual love and connection for the city of Atlanta. The RHOM reboot casting was perfect for this exact reason.\n\nWho do I think on the cast should stay/go? Let's start with Sanya Richards-Ross and Drew Sidora: OUT. Gone. Goodbye.\n\nKenya Moore: She is definitely staying!\n\nMarlo Hampton: She should stick around.\n\nKandi Burruss: Maybe a spin-off?\n\nSheree Whitfield: She should be demoted to \"friend of.\"\n\nPorsha Guobadia: Bring her back.\n\nKim Zolciak-Biermann: No, thank you.\n\nBut, I think we can also all agree that new cast members are needed to keep this show going. Here's what I think about adding new members.\n\nI would bring in four newbies, women with different backgrounds, and different personalities that have made their mark in the ATL. Women who are wealthy, messy, and fun. I don't need the women to have a strong connection to the current cast, either. Let them genuinely get to know each other.\n\nNo matter what, though, RHOA will forever be the blueprint.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you agree with me that it's time for a reboot of The Real Housewives of Atlanta? Let me know what changes you would make in the comments below!\n\nAnd remember, you can watch new and old episodes of Real Housewives of Atlanta on Peacock whenever you want!\n\nShare This Article"
