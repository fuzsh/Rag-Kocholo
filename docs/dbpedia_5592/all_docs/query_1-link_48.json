        "text": "As I have mentioned, my first chapter as a professional was as an actor in New York I worked on stage and was an original member of an amazingly creative ensemble of improvisors. We called ourselves War Babies and drew a great crowd and national reputation. After a few years producer's came from Hollywood with offers to bring us West to do a summer comedy show. We never returned. For me it was a world wind of success. The Seventies. All I had to do was lighten my hair lover my blouse and become part of the Pin-up generation. It was complicated leaving the group and starving myself into Farah Fawcett's size clothing but very exciting. I loved so much of it and and did some good work. My new image did box me in to the roles that made me the most money for my agency and I missed the versatility of the New York Stage. When I was thirty-one I was told I was going up for a twenty-eight year old. There was a pause on my end. After what felt like a 5 hour flight from LA to NY I asked, \"What am I supposed to do with this information\"? The answer gave me no solace. I understood. If the show lasted a while I had to find a way to stay stunted at 28. My mind wondered towards the Ingenue's who never aged and wound up on Love Boat (of which I enjoyed traveling the world). I was acting since 16 and started understanding that my mental make up was too fragile for the outside obsession.\n\nLater that year, at the top of my game I registered in school to get my PhD. in Psychology. It took a long and exciting road. I have been loving this for many years.\n\nRecently I have been lecturing and becoming able to merge both chapters in my life with humor self-deprivation and much twinges of truth. I have written personal and clinical pieces but my observational ones are what has brought me back to the theater and Indie films- no more starving, only for authenticity. My hair is still blonde with splashes of white."
