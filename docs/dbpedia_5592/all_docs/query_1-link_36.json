        "text": "By Tatayana Yomary\n\nUpdated Mar. 1 2023, 12:46 p.m. ET\n\nAvid viewers of Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Atlanta know that relationship issues are always a hot topic. Over the years, viewers have watched couples deal with cheating scandals, financial issues, separations, and more. And unfortunately, second-time peach holder Drew Sidora has felt the heat with her marriage to Ralph Pittman Jr.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIn Season 13, the Game star was vocal about her issues with Ralph going to Tampa, Fla., for three days without telling her. Although Drew and Ralph were able to get over that hump, Season 14 revealed more serious issues between the couple. Social media users called out Ralph for the way he talks to Drew. As a result, fans called for Drew to divorce her husband.\n\nIn a May 2022 exclusive interview with Distractify, Drew shined a light on her marriage issues with Ralph and the steps they were taking to mend things.\n\nHowever, there have been further developments regarding the pair's marriage. Are the two getting a divorce? Here's what we know.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nRalph Pittman has filed for divorce with 'RHOA's' Drew Sidora.\n\nMany RHOA fans may argue that they saw this coming ... Ralph and Drew are going their separate ways after nine years of marriage.\n\nCourt documents obtained by People share that Ralph filed the petition on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2022. Ralph cited that \"there is no chance or hope of reconciliation\" between the spouses.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nRalph gave an exclusive statement to the publication sharing that both he and Drew came to the decision of splitting up.\n\n\"Love is a beautiful thing,\" Ralph told the outlet. \"Unfortunately we have made the difficult decision to to move on to our next chapters, independent of each other. Drew and I have decided to file for divorce. We have three amazing young children, and their mindset and growth is what is most important.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nRalph ended his statement by asking for folks to \"respect their privacy\" as they navigate the change in their relationship. Interestingly, Drew has been silent so far. But, we expect for the entrepreneur to make a statement soon.\n\nAs expected, social media users wasted no time sharing their sentiments. Many folks have shared that they're not surprised at the news based on Ralph's actions, while others are upset that she didn't file first. The general consensus on social media is that Drew deserves a man that is better for her.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDrew and Ralph previously told 'Distractify' that they were going through marriage counseling to work out their issues.\n\nMarriage is a major commitment. It’s not something that you easily give up on when things get tough, and Drew wanted to keep her promise with her union to Ralph.\n\nIt’s no secret that the Pittmans have frequently dominated the Housewives section of Twitter. And after one episode in 2022 showcased a heated argument between Ralph and Drew about his assistant — along with a romantic night out that went left — fans had their pitchforks ready. Social media was convinced that Drew should leave Ralph. But, the songstress had no plans of ending her marriage.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“Yes, he can be an a--hole,” Drew exclusively told Distractify at the time, in May 2022. “He admitted to that, he has owned his junk. But, he is who he is. And he showed me other things. So, we are actively in counseling because I'm not going to sit here and act like our marriage is perfect. We are working to be better.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIn fact, Drew opened up about realizing her own faults with how she communicates with Ralph and how she can sometimes trigger him. Drew shared that viewers would hopefully see the couple's counseling efforts on Season 14 of RHOA.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“You'll see us go to marriage counseling and we're still in marriage counseling,” Drew told us. “And I feel like he is putting forth the effort to try to communicate softer. And I appreciate him for showing up to marriage counseling. \"\n\n\"I appreciate him for acknowledging his faults and wanting to stay here because he can leave,\" she added. \"Neither one of us are holding each other or tying each other to this marriage. So I appreciate someone that he's willing to stick it out and go through those valleys.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDrew also shared her belief that “people give up too easily on marriage.”\n\nSo, we can assume that the couple tried their hardest to put in the work to salvage their marriage before throwing in the towel.\n\nWe'd like to wish both Drew and Ralph all the best."
