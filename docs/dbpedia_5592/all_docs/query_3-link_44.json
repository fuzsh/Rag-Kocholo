        "text": "Porsha Williams Guobadia is making her comeback to The Real Housewives of Atlanta and has also signed an overall scripted talent deal with NBCUniversal Entertainment.\n\nWilliams Guobadia has officially rejoined the cast following a two-season absence and will return for Season 16 on Bravo.\n\n“I’m incredibly thankful for the vision and faith NBCUniversal has put in me to be a larger part of their family,” Williams Guobadia said in a statement. “I’m looking forward to being back on The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and showing the world my new world!”\n\nThe entrepreneur originally joined the show in Season 5 and left following Season 13. As part of her deal, Williams Guobadia will partner with NBCUniversal Entertainment for scripted project opportunities across the company’s broadcast and streaming properties.\n\n“Porsha Williams Guobadia is a multi-hyphenate and we are fortunate to collaborate and tap into her creativity and passion through this partnership,” Rachel Smith, Executive Vice President of Unscripted Content, Lifestyle and Documentaries, NBCUniversal Entertainment, said in a statement. “Our audience has supported and admired Porsha as she so authentically, hilariously and vulnerably shared her life over the years and we couldn’t be more excited to welcome her back to the NBCU family.”\n\nRHOA was placed on an extended hiatus following Season 15. As production prepares to resume on a new season, longtime housewife Kandi Burruss announced she would be leaving the franchise after 14 seasons. Bravo has not confirmed what the rest of the cast for the Atlanta-based show looks like but the most recent season included Kenya Moore, Shereé Whitfield, Drew Sidora, Sanya Richards-Ross and Marlo Hampton.\n\nWilliams Guobadia most recently starred in the RHOA spinoff Porsha’s Family Matters in 2021 and in Season 3 of The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip, which aired in 2023. The reality TV personality was also part of the inaugural cast of the William Shatner competition Stars on Mars.\n\nOn the scripted side, she has made guest appearances on HBO’s Insecure, IFC’s Sherman’s Showcase, Fox’s Star and TV One’s Steppin’ Back to Love.\n\nWilliams Guobadia is repped by Karen Kinney, KK Entertainment & Media, Fox Rothschild LLP and UTA. The Real Housewives of Atlanta is a Truly Original production."
