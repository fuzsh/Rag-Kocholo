The economy was shedding 800,000 jobs a month. The auto industry was on the brink of collapse, and our manufacturing sector was in decline. Many families were struggling to pay their bills and make ends meet. Millions more saw their savings evaporate, even as retirement neared. Seven years later, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, the United States of America has rebuilt, reformed, and emerged as the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We are in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history: 14 million new jobs; the strongest two years of job growth since the ‘90s; an unemployment rate cut in half. Manufacturing has added 900,000 jobs in the past six years, and our auto industry just had its best year of sales ever. We are less reliant on foreign oil than at any point in the previous four decades. Nearly 18 million people have gained health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, cutting the uninsured rate to a record low. And we’ve done all this while dramatically cutting our budget deficit. In 2015, we continued to take steps forward, with strong job growth and wages rising at their fastest rate in the recovery. Here in Washington, Congress came together to pass a budget, secure long-term transportation funding, reform education laws, and make tax cuts for working families permanent. So claims that America’s economy is in decline or that we haven’t made progress are simply not true. What is true—and the reason that a Economic Report of the President | 3 lot of Americans feel anxious—is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, starting long before the Great Recession. Today, technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but rather affects any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy face tougher competition from abroad, and they can locate anywhere. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top. All these trends have squeezed workers, making it difficult for middle-class families to feel secure, even when they have jobs and the economy is growing. For the past seven years, our goal has been not just strengthening economic growth but also creating an economy where everyone who works hard gets a fair shot. We’ve made progress. But we need to make more. And we must choose policies that not only make us stronger today, but also reflect the kind of country we aspire to be in the coming decades. Real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. Together, we’ve increased access to early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing pre-school for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and recruiting and supporting more great teachers for our kids. And we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no hardworking student should be saddled with unmanageable debt. We’ve already doubled investments in college scholarships and tax credits and capped student loan payments to 10 percent of a borrower’s income. Now, we need colleges to find innovative ways to cut costs and help more students finish their degrees. Of course, a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever, and we shouldn’t weaken them; we should strengthen them. For Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That’s part of what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It helps fill the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we’ll still have coverage. We can build on this progress by further strengthening our social safety net and modernizing it for the changing economy. For example, 4 | Economic Report of the President when a hardworking American loses his job—we shouldn’t just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him. If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he’s going from job to job, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That’s the way we make the economy work better for everyone. But there are broader choices to make about what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. A thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy, and we can all agree that there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record corporate profits, working families won’t have more opportunities or see faster wage growth by letting the biggest companies make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses that have figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America. In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative, and that spirit of innovation is essential to helping us meet our biggest challenges. Over the past seven years, we have nurtured that spirit by protecting an open Internet, creating online tools to help entrepreneurs start their businesses in a single day, and taking bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. But we can do so much more, especially for medical research and clean energy sources. With 2015 marking the warmest year on record, we need to build on our existing investments in clean energy and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. At the same time, I’ll keep pushing forward on work that still needs to be done, like fixing our broken immigration system, raising the minimum wage, providing two years of free community college to responsible students, ensuring equal pay for equal work, opening U.S. exports to new markets, and expanding tax cuts for low-income workers Economic Report of the President | 5 without kids. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do, and I will not let up until they get done. I have never been more optimistic about America’s future than I am today. Over the past seven years, I have seen the strength, resilience, and commitment of the American people. I know that when we are united in the face of challenges, our Nation emerges stronger and better than before. And when we work together, there are no limits to what we can achieve.

Our businesses created 2.6 million jobs in 2015 and the unemployment rate fell to 5.0 percent, half its level in fall 2009, far faster than forecasters expected. Private domestic final purchases—the most stable and persistent components of economic output—rose 2.7 percent over the four quarters of the year, bolstered by solid personal consumption, strong residential investment, and record-setting investment in research and development. Health care price growth remained at low levels not seen in nearly five decades as the Nation’s uninsured rate fell below 10 percent for the first time ever. Overall, consumers were more confident about the economy than in any year since 2004. Nominal wage growth remained too low, but still grew faster in 2015 than at any time since the recovery began. While more work remains to be done on each of these fronts—especially in terms of wage growth—the U.S. economy exhibited substantial strength throughout the year. At the same time, slowing foreign demand has weighed on exports and impacted the manufacturing sector, low oil prices—while boosting household balance sheets—have constrained investment and job growth in the drilling industry, and financial market volatility is also impacting the economy. The divergence between strong domestic demand and these global factors will remain an important macroeconomic dynamic in 2016. But we must not lose sight of the longer-term challenges that the U.S. economy has faced for decades, most notably the insufficient growth of middle-class incomes. Last year’s Economic Report of the President focused on the three factors that drive middle-class incomes: productivity growth, inequality, and participation in our economy. This year’s Report examines the economics and policies that can strengthen productivity without exacerbating inequality, promoting robust and inclusive growth that can be shared by a broad group of households. Many of these policies increase economic 21 efficiency as well as equity, unleashing productivity growth that benefits families across the income distribution. Despite progress during the recovery and promising economic trends, inequality remains a defining challenge of the 21st century economy. This is a global issue, but one that is particularly salient in the United States. While rising income and wealth inequality tend to attract the most attention, the last few decades have seen an especially unequal distribution of something more fundamental—the opportunity to succeed in our economy. Too many Americans’ ability to innovate and participate in the labor force is constrained by their circumstances. For example, children of low-income families face broad disadvantages that limit their ability to get ahead in school and later in life; our criminal justice system fosters inequities and inefficiencies that limit opportunity; and persistent biases against women and minorities limit their full economic participation. Unequal outcomes often reward hard work and innovation, and may promote the efficient use of our resources and raise overall living standards. But unequal outcomes that arise from unequal opportunities—barriers that keep some individuals from realizing their full potential—are a detriment to growth and fairness. The President supports a wide range of policies to promote equality of opportunity for all Americans, detailed extensively later in this chapter. The overall increase in income inequality in recent decades is large enough to accommodate many partial explanations. The traditional view is that inequality arises from competitive markets, paying workers, investors, and innovators according to their productivity—with divergences in productivity stemming from changes in technology, globalization, and education. Such a mechanism promotes productivity growth by encouraging productive labor, wise investments, and innovation. But many economists have recently emphasized another contributor to rising income inequality: “economic rents.” Rents are unproductive income paid to labor or capital above what is necessary to keep that labor at work or that capital invested. Rents arise when markets are not perfectly competitive, such as when uncompetitive markets yield monopoly profits or preferential regulation protects entities from competition. For example, a firm might be willing to sell a piece of software for $20 based on costs and a reasonable return to capital. But if the firm has no competition, it may be able to sell the same product for $50—the $30 difference reflects an economic rent. Rents can serve a productive purpose in encouraging innovation. Some rents are inevitable, but the critical question is how they are divided—for example, between profits and wages. And in many cases the evidence suggests that the pursuit of such rents (“rent-seeking behavior”) exacerbates inequality and can actually impair growth. 22 | Chapter 1 To promote inclusive growth, both channels of inequality—competitive markets and economic rents—must be addressed from a pro-growth perspective. Since the competitive channel most effectively promotes growth when competition is open to the widest set of economic actors, promoting equality of opportunity helps the competitive channel work better. And because the abuse of market power in pursuit of economic rents results in inherently unproductive inequality, strategies to reduce such unfair advantages can promote equality and opportunity. Both of these broad goals would reduce inequality while unleashing productivity growth, raising living standards across the income distribution. Forms of Economic Inequality: Income, Wealth, and Opportunity Unequal outcomes may provide incentives for individual effort and therefore play a productive role in the economy. Large rewards can motivate innovators, entrepreneurs, and workers and compensate them for taking large personal risks—choices that, in some cases, can benefit households more broadly across the economy. Hard work and personal capital developed the first personal computer; its developer reaped great rewards, but so too did aggregate productivity. Inequality can also simply reflect the choices of two otherwise identical people who make different decisions about how to balance work versus leisure, or an undesirable job versus a desirable job. But excessive inequality may also reflect substantially more than “just deserts,” ranging from pure luck to economic rents. Moreover, while inequality can play an important role in economic growth, excessive inequality is not necessarily essential to growth and may even impede growth. This is especially true to the degree that inequality derives from interfering with the competitive market or protecting high returns to capital or labor with barriers, natural or otherwise. To understand how to promote widely shared growth, it is critical to distinguish among various forms of economic inequality to better understand their sources. This Report considers three broad forms: inequality of income, inequality of wealth, and inequality of opportunity. All are closely related and can influence one another. Income Inequality Although a global issue, income inequality is particularly important in the United States in terms of both its level and in recent changes. Large advanced economies have seen a persistent trend of rising inequality for decades, as the very highest earners capture a larger share of aggregate Inclusive Growth in the United States | 23 income. Until the 1980s, the United States experience was similar to other countries; as recently as 1975, the top 1 percent garnered a similar share of the income in the United States as in other G-7 countries, as shown in Figure 1-1. But since 1987 the share of income going to the top 1 percent in the United States has exceeded every other G-7 country in each year that data are available. Moreover, the United States has continued to diverge further from other advanced economies, with the top 1 percent’s income share rising 0.2 percentage point a year on average in the United States from 1990 to 2010, well above the 0.1 percentage point average increase in the United Kingdom. While comparable international data are scarce after 2010, the gains of the top 1 percent have continued in the United States. In 2014, the top 1 percent captured 18 percent of income, up from 8 percent in 1975 (World Top Incomes Database 2015). In contrast to rising inequality within countries, inequality across the globe as a whole has been largely stable and possibly even decreasing. Fast growth in many poorer and emerging countries has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in recent decades, moderating the trends observed in the advanced world. In fact, when measured at a global level, the biggest income gains from 1988 to 2008 went to households between the 15th percentile and the 65th percentile of global income (Milanovic 2012). The dynamics of income inequality across many countries have gained considerable attention in recent years, perhaps most notably in Thomas Piketty’s 2014 work Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Following Piketty, previous Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) analysis has decomposed inequality into three components: • Inequality within labor income (wages, salaries, and benefits); • Inequality within capital income (capital gains, dividends, and interest); and • The division of aggregate income between labor and capital. All three of these have different causes, dynamics, and policy implications. CEA has decomposed the changes in inequality in the United States into the three sources using a combination of data from Piketty and his colleague Emmanuel Saez, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Figures 1-2a and 1-2b shows the top 1 percent shares of labor and capital income according to various datasets. The data present several issues with volatility, systematic measurement error that results from using administrative tax data in an environment of changing tax policies, and definitional nuances around what should be 24 | Chapter 1 Percent 20 Figure 1-1 Share of Income Earned by Top 1 Percent, 1975–2014 United States Canada Italy Germany United Kingdom France Japan 2014 15 10 5 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 Note: Data for all countries exclude capital gains. Source: World Top Incomes Database (Alvaredo et al. 2015). 2005 2010 2015 classified as labor or capital income. Nonetheless, this decomposition exercise illustrates a few broad points. In the United States, the top 1 percent’s share of total income rose from 8 percent in 1970 to 17 percent in 2010, according to the Piketty-Saez data. Throughout this period, the top 1 percent’s share of labor income rose steadily while its share of capital income only began a sustained rise around 1990, as shown in Figure 1-2a. Overall, the 9-percentage-point increase in the share of income that Piketty and Saez find going to the top 1 percent from 1970 to 2010 is attributable to the three factors discussed above in the following dimensions: 68 percent due to increased inequality within labor income; 32 percent due to increased inequality within capital income; and 0 percent due to a shift in income from labor to capital. This finding is broadly consistent with the recent emphasis on labor income inequality, though it tells us that capital income is also a reasonably important driver of income inequality. Other data discussed below show a bigger share for the shift from labor to capital income. However, when looking at the extreme upper end of the income distribution in more recent periods, capital income becomes much more important. Table 1-1 shows the relative importance of the distribution of income within labor in explaining the increased share of income going to the top in different data sets and different periods.

Source: CEA calculations based on Piketty-Saez (2015) and Congressional Budget Office (2013). The higher up the income scale, the less important inequality within labor income is in explaining the overall increase in inequality, and the commensurately more important the degree of inequality within capital income. There is a strong temporal pattern as well, with inequality within capital income becoming increasingly important over time. The relevant CBO data only go back to 1979 and do not show any finer measurements than the top 1 percent, but they tell a similar story both in terms of the overall magnitudes and in terms of within-capital inequality being more important higher up the income scale. Inequality within Labor Income The topic of inequality within labor income has been studied extensively. As a factual matter, those at the very top of the income distribution (top 0.1 percent) are about 40 percent managers in non-financial industries and about 20 percent financial professionals, with the remaining 40 percent spread across law, medicine, real estate, entrepreneurship, arts, media, sports, and other occupations (Bakija, Cole, and Heim 2010). A variety of explanations have been put forward for the overall rise in labor income inequality, including the increased return to skills, especially given technological change, the increased national and global reach of corporations, the slowdown in increases in educational attainment (weakening the skill base and earning power of the lower part of the income distribution), and changes in norms and corporate governance (such that a wider gap between CEO and worker pay is now acceptable). The rising importance of unproductive economic rents is likely also contributing to the broad increase in inequality. Workers and managers at firms earning supernormal Inclusive Growth in the United States | 27 return—likely reflecting increased aggregate rents—are paid progressively more than their counterparts at other firms. Moreover, as union membership declines, inequality can rise further as workers at the bottom of the income distribution lose market power. Inequality within Capital Income A second source of increased inequality is the distribution of capital income. As the distribution of wealth becomes increasingly unequal, the returns to that wealth—like interest, dividends, and capital gains—will generate more inequality. In addition, the fact that those at higher wealth levels seem to receive higher returns to capital, when coupled with reductions in tax rates on capital income in recent decades, has increased the contribution of capital income to overall inequality. Further, if some firms earn monopoly profits, owners of those firms may benefit more than others. These issues have been studied much less than labor income inequality, though they clearly merit much more attention given their increasing importance over time. Division of Income between Labor and Capital Wealth is much more unequally distributed than labor income. As a result, the extent to which aggregate income is divided between returns to labor and returns to wealth (capital income) matters for aggregate inequality. When the labor share of income falls, the offsetting increase in capital income (returns to wealth) is distributed especially unequally, increasing overall inequality. In Europe, the share of income going to labor has been falling since about 1970. In contrast, a marked decline in the labor share of income occurred only after 2000 in the United States, though there is some volatility in the data. The relative importance of this factor in the overall increase in inequality is harder to consistently quantify, although the importance of labor and capital income inequality in recent decades suggests that it plays only a supporting role. Wealth Inequality When unequally distributed income is saved, it results in unequally distributed wealth. Growing wealth inequality in the United States reflects many of the trends and many of the same causes as rising income inequality. Wealth inequality is particularly difficult to measure accurately because we do not track wealth in the way we do income and trends in wealth inequality are concentrated among a small number of households. One perspective on wealth inequality comes from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) which, as shown in Figure 1-3, shows that the top 3 percent 28 | Chapter 1 Figure 1-3 Distribution of Household Wealth (Survey of Consumer Finances), 1989-2013 Percent of Total Household Wealth 60 Top 3 Percent 50 40 Bottom 90 Percent 30 20 10 1989 2013 Top 4th-10th Percentiles 1992 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007 Source: Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Survey of Consumer Finances. 2010 2013 of households have held more than 50 percent of aggregate wealth since 2007 (Bricker et al., 2014). This share has been on a consistent uptrend since the late 1980s. The next 7 percent of households in the wealth distribution hold roughly 25 percent of aggregate wealth, a share that been fairly stable time during this period. Notably, the loss in wealth share experienced by the bottom 90 percent of households, which in 2013 held only 25 percent of all wealth is accounted for by the rise in share captured by the top 3 percent. This is not a uniform spreading of the wealth distribution; it is a rising concentration of wealth at the very top. An alternative analysis by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman finds that the rise in wealth inequality is due to the very top of the wealth distribution. Using capital income reported on tax returns, they estimate that the share of wealth held by the top 0.1 percent of households has more than tripled, from 7 percent of total household wealth in 1979 to 22 percent in 2012—reversing a decline over the prior decades.1 As shown in Figure 1-4, the wealth share of these households (approximately 160,000 families with average net wealth per family above $20.6 million) is now nearly as large as it was in 1929 (Saez and Zucman 2015). 1 Any method to measure wealth is imperfect and unlike income, individuals are not required to report the value of their wealth each year, so there is no administrative data to use as a benchmark for the distribution, the two methods discussed here each have their advantages and disadvantages. (Bricker et al 2015, Saez and Zucman 2015). Inclusive Growth in the United States | 29 Figure 1-4 Distribution of Household Wealth (Saez-Zucman), 1913–2012 Percent of Total Household Wealth 40 35 Bottom 90 Percent 30 2012 25 Top 1 Percent to Top 0.1 Percent 20 15 10 Top 0.1 Percent 5 0 1913 1923 1933 1943 1953 Source: Saez and Zucman (2015). 1963 1973 1983 1993 2003 2013 Saez and Zucman argue that this increase in wealth concentration is compounded by an increase in differences in saving rates across wealth classes (for instance, wealthier individuals save a larger percentage of their income). More generally, they hypothesize that income inequality has a “snowballing effect” on the wealth distribution: a larger share of income is earned by top wealth holders, who then save at higher rates, which pushes wealth concentration up; this dynamic leads to rising capital-income concentration and contributes to even greater top income and wealth shares. Rising wealth inequality is perhaps best understood as the ultimate outcome of economic growth that leaves the middle class behind. But it is also an important cause of income inequality. In part, it directly reinforces itself because concentrated wealth leads to concentrated capital income. But more importantly, it helps entrench a broader inequality of opportunity that blocks the path to full economic participation for wide swaths of the potential U.S. labor force and innovation force. Inequality of Opportunity The traditional argument that inequality results from normal economic competition rests on the notion that competition for unequally distributed rewards encourages production. But when inequality has become so entrenched that it passes across generations and limits opportunity, it 30 | Chapter 1 narrows the pool of human capital that can compete. Such throttling of opportunity is unambiguously bad for growth, preventing potential innovators from full economic participation and weighing on productivity growth. Further, if entrenched interests are able to limit future competition either by influencing the policymaking process or by abusing their market power, dynamism in labor markets or firm entry can decrease. While some level of income and wealth inequality can play a constructive role, the implications of unevenly distributed opportunity are simpler—working the wrong way for both equity and efficiency. While inequality of opportunity is an international phenomenon, it is especially important in the United States. Mishel et al. (2012), based on data from Corak (2011), assembles a set of intergenerational earnings elasticities across large advanced economies with similar incomes to the United States. The intergenerational earnings elasticity reflects the extent to which the earnings of parents and children are correlated—the higher the elasticity, the less mobile the society. Such mobility can be understood as a measure of the inequality of opportunity. If children at all income levels faced the same set of opportunities, one might expect a lower elasticity. Among the 17 peer countries identified by Mishel, the United States ranks in the top half, as shown in Figure 1-5. Other measures of mobility support the observation: Raj Chetty has found that a child born in the 1980s to parents in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution has only a 7.5 percent chance of moving to the top 20 percent. A similar child has a 12 percent chance in Denmark and a 13 percent chance in Canada (Chetty 2014). It is important to understand the forms that this inequality of opportunity takes and to explore the institutional structures that entrench the pattern. Three particular examples that the Council of Economic Advisers has recently explored in a series of reports include the experience of children in low-income families, inequities in the criminal justice system, and the systemic challenges faced by women in the U.S. economy. The President has a robust agenda to promote equality of opportunity for all Americans, detailed extensively later in this chapter. Children in Low-Income Families Barriers to opportunity take many forms, but those that appear early in life for children and youth are particularly costly to society, as their impacts accumulate over many years, shaping adolescents and young adults during their critical transition to adulthood beyond. Moreover, there is evidence that in recent decades, family income has become more important in shaping children’s outcomes. Chapter 4 of this Report focuses on Inclusive Growth in the United States | 31 Figure 1-5 Intergenerational Earnings Mobility Elasticity Between Earnings of Fathers and Sons 0.6 0.5 Less Earnings Mobility More Earnings Mobility 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 Source: Mishel et al. (2012); Corak (2011). the particular challenges facing children and the policies that can improve outcomes for them. Parents’ socioeconomic status can produce an inequality of opportunity via a number of channels. Financial expenditure is one obvious pathway. As income inequality has grown, so has inequality in child-related expenditures. Parents in the top income quintile now spend seven times more on children’s materials and enrichment activities—such as books, computers, summer camps, and music lessons—than families in the bottom income quintile, and other research suggests that this inequality in expenditure has grown over time (Duncan and Murnane 2011). A family’s socioeconomic status can also impact a child’s chances through housing stability and neighborhood conditions, food security, and access to medical care, as well as in the types of activities that parents participate in with their children. Sustained exposure to the toxic stresses of poverty during childhood can prevent children from achieving their potential, exacerbating later-life income inequality and limiting national economic growth. Criminal Justice The criminal justice system is plagued with inequalities of opportunity, both along racial lines, and along income lines in the form of monetary payments such as fines, fees, and bail. The dramatic rise in incarceration 32 | Chapter 1 over the past several decades has been distributed unequally, disproportionately impacting low-income households and minorities. In 1984, the majority of State and Federal prisoners were White; but by 2014, over 65 percent of sentenced prisoners were minorities (Minor-Harper 1986; Carson 2015). Even when there is little difference in the likelihood of committing a crime, individuals of color are much more likely to be arrested. For example, an African-American individual is nearly four times as likely as a White individual to be arrested for marijuana possession, even though individuals of both races reported using marijuana at similar rates in 2010 (ACLU 2013). Different rates of interaction with the criminal justice system by income and race can create substantial barriers to economic success, limiting opportunity for many. The expanding use of monetary penalties—fines, fees, and bails—also disproportionately impact poor defendants and offenders who have fewer resources available to manage criminal justice debt. Financial penalties also serve as a regressive form of punishment as the same level of debt presents an increasingly larger burden as one moves down the income scale. Such systemic challenges limit the opportunities available to low-income families, preventing them from full participation in our economy (CEA 2015a). Women in the Economy Over the last five decades, women have made enormous strides in the U.S. labor market. Our economy is $2.0 trillion, or 13.5 percent, larger than it would have been without women’s increased participation in the labor force and hours worked since 1970 (CEA 2014). Although the United States was initially a leader in bringing women into the labor force, our progress has stalled somewhat over the past 20 or 30 years. In 1990, the United States ranked seventh in female prime-age (2554) labor force participation out of 24 advanced economies for which data is available—but in 2014, the United States fell to 20th place (OECD 2015). Part of the explanation may be that the United States lags behind many of its peer countries in terms of pro-family policies like paid leave requirements that ease the burden on working families. Moreover, women in the labor force face a persistent wage gap. The typical woman working full-time full-year earns 21 percent less than the typical man. In addition, while the pay gap closed by 17 percentage points between 1981 and 2001, it has remained flat since 2001. In the past two years, some modest progress has been made, with the gap closing by 1.8 percentage point from 2012 to 2013 and by an additional percentage point between 2013 and 2014. The wage gap has many causes and contributors, including gender Inclusive Growth in the United States | 33 gaps in education and experience; differences in choices of occupation and industry; decisions about family responsibilities; and discrimination. The Interplay of the Forms of Inequality These three forms of inequality discussed above are not conceptually distinct phenomena—they closely affect one another. Wealth inequality is, in some respects, an outcome of income inequality, as the saving of unequally distributed income produces unequally distributed wealth. But inequality of opportunity is in many ways both a cause and a result of income and wealth inequality. Therefore, unequally distributed opportunities entrench an unequal income distribution, and an unequal income distribution leads to many of the inequities faced by low-income and low-wealth children. The “Great Gatsby” curve, a term introduced by former CEA Chair Alan Krueger, illustrates the relationship between income inequality and inequality of opportunity. When plotted across counties or across countries, Figures 1-6a and 1-6b shows that areas with more income inequality also tend to have less mobility for children from low-income families. This relationship also holds across large advanced economies. The Great Gatsby curve shows that inequality is correlated with lower mobility, and one important transmission mechanism is the distribution of opportunity. When disparities in education, training, social connection, and the criminal justice system are distributed as unequally as overall wealth, poorer families have a much harder time succeeding in the economy. Sources of Inequality: Competitive Markets and Economic Rents Classical economics suggests that income inequality is a product of competitive markets, with income differences reflecting pure productivity differences. Under this view, inequality encourages growth by rewarding the most productive labor and the highest-returning capital. But recently, economists and commentators have suggested that much of the rise in inequality can be explained by the rising importance of economic rents. Recent work by the Council of Economic Advisers has focused on the influence of economic rents or their division in the labor market (CEA 2015c), in the housing sector (Furman 2015a), in occupational licensing (Furman 2015b), and in the broader capital markets (Furman and Orszag 2015). The long-term trend of rising inequality is sufficiently large that multiple forces are likely playing a part. While there is truth to the “competitive markets” view that an unequal distribution of income compensation for 34 | Chapter 1 Figure 1-6a The \"Great Gatsby Curve\" Within the United States Upward Mobility 55 50 Less Upward Mobility 45 40 More Inequality 35 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Inequality (Gini Coefficient for Parent Family Income, 1996-2000) 0.6 Note: U.S. commuting zones were ordered by Gini coefficient and divided into 20 equally sized bins.

Inclusive Growth in the United States | 35 differences in productivity, there is also evidence of rents complicating the income-productivity link. This Report considers each channel in turn. The Competitive Channel The traditional economic explanation of inequality is grounded in competitive markets, wherein workers receive wages commensurate with their productivity. According to this explanation, a combination of skillbiased technological change, a slowdown in the increase in educational attainment, and globalization have increased the demand for highly skilled workers at the same time that their relative supply has not kept pace— resulting in higher wages for these high-productivity workers and greater inequality. Skill-Biased Technological Change Many economists have pointed to the role of technology in increasing inequality (Autor 2010). This argument asserts that technology can most readily replace labor in tasks that are easily automated, which tend to involve routine tasks that place them in the middle of the skill and wage distributions. Over time, employment moves to both the lower and higher ends of the occupational skill ranking, as shown in Figure 1-7, where occupations are ranked by average wage as a proxy for skill. While technology is a better replacement for tasks that are easy to routinize, it complements the abilities of highly skilled workers and improves their productivity, thereby increasing their earnings and employment opportunities. Lower-skilled workers are not necessarily made more productive, but neither are they easily replaced, as their jobs often include interpersonal interactions and variable situations that are difficult to automate. Taken together, this view of the role of technology points to both rising inequality and rising job polarization. Educational Attainment The increase in skill-biased technological change has been compounded by a slowdown in the rate of increase in educational attainment. Schooling attainment rose for much of the 20th century, in part due to measures like the G.I. Bill, the expansion of high schools and community colleges, and greater educational attainment by women. However, growth in years of schooling slowed substantially around 1980. The rate of growth in the college-educated population fell by almost 60 percent, from 3.9 percent a year between 1960 and 1980 to 2.3 percent per year between 1980 and 2005, according to estimates by Lawrence Katz and Claudia Goldin. While the pool of skilled workers is still growing, in recent decades it has 36 | Chapter 1 Figure 1-7 Change in Employment by Detailed Occupation, 1989–2015 Change in Total Employment, Millions 7 Service Occupations, Except Protective and Household 6 5 4 Teachers, Except Postsecondary 3 2 Technicians and Related Support Occupations Executive, Administrative, and Managerial Occupations ManagementRelated Occupations 1 0 -1 -2 -3 Machine Operators $10 $14 Secretaries, Stenographers, and Typists $18 $22 $26 Average Hourly Wage, 1989 (in 2015 Dollars) $30 Note: Excludes five occupational categories with outlying wages and relatively small changes in employment (Farm Occupations, Except Managerial; Private Household Occupations; Engineers, Architects, and Surveyors; Lawyers and Judges; and Health Diagnosing Occupations).

Globalization Other economists have pointed to the rapid rise in globalization that has occurred since the 1980s as a potential explanation for growing inequality within the United States, especially the expansion of trade with China since 2000. (Greater globalization also coincided with a shift in national income shares from labor to capital, a worldwide phenomenon.) Economic theory predicts that such trade may have some effect on wages for lowskilled workers in the United States who now face more competition from low-skilled Chinese workers, while reducing wages for high-skilled workers in China who now face more competition from high-skilled American workers. But some evidence militates in the other direction. For example, the returns to education have increased in a wide range of countries over the last several decades, including many relatively poor countries. This suggests either that some other more-subtle globalization explanation is operative or, alternatively, that the technology/education explanations are even more important than the globalization explanation. Inclusive Growth in the United States | 37 To some extent, some of these forces—like skill-biased technological change and globalization—reflect the type of desirable economic progress that promotes productivity growth. But that competitive channel works best when the competition is open to the broadest pool of potential labor and investable capital. Public policy is therefore critical to ensuring that the competitive channel works well, in part by providing a cushion for those disadvantaged by the system—such as providing job retraining, unemployment insurance, robust Social Security, access to health care, and other policies for which the President has advocated. But government also has an important role in reducing the inequality of opportunity that creates barriers to success for some groups and thus limits the pool of workers who can successfully compete in the labor market. As important as these forces are, the competitive channel does not appear to explain the full rise in income inequality in recent decades. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, there is evidence that an especially unproductive element is at work—the rising influence of economic rents and their distribution. The Rents Channel Many economists have recently advanced an explanation of inequality grounded in the importance of economic rents—the notion that investors or highly compensated workers are receiving more income than they would require to undertake their production or work. Classic examples of such rents include monopoly profits and the unearned benefits of preferential government regulation. Rents can result from abuses of market power and tend to encourage “rent-seeking behavior,” the unproductive use of resources to capture such rewards. According to this view, the unequal distribution of these rents—rather than the conventional explanation that inequality reflects only actual differences in worker productivity or the allocation of capital—is an important cause of rising income inequality. To the degree that this interpretation is correct, it suggests that it is possible to reduce inequality without hurting efficiency by changing how the rents are divided or even while increasing efficiency by acting to reduce these rents. There is relatively little academic literature on this question and data are scarce since rents cannot be directly observed, but considerable evidence appears to support the notion that rents are exacerbating inequality. It is important to note that not all economic rents are undesirable. For example, in a perfectly competitive market, the price settles at a level below that which some buyers would be willing to pay and above that which some sellers would be willing to accept. The rents collected by these buyers 38 | Chapter 1 and sellers—consumer and producer surplus—are widely considered one of the chief benefits of market competition. In addition, temporary monopoly power that guarantees rents for a firm can be an incentive for additional innovation—one of the goals of our patent system. Nevertheless, growing rents, the increasingly unequal division of rents between workers and firms, and rent-seeking behavior are often highly problematic and appear to have become more so in recent decades (Furman and Orszag 2015). The Division of Rents in Wage Negotiations: Declining Unionization and the Minimum Wage Whenever a firm hires a worker, the difference between the highest wage the firm would pay and the lowest wage the worker would accept is the surplus created by the job match—an economic rent. The division of that rent between firm and work depends on their relative bargaining power. As markets grow concentrated and certain forms of labor are commoditized, the balance of bargaining power leans toward the firm. Unionization and collective bargaining—along with policies like the minimum wage—help level the playing field, concentrating labor and encouraging the firm to share those rents with labor. This process traditionally helped bolster the wages of lower- and middle-wage workers, thereby reducing inequality. But union membership has declined consistently since the 1970s, as shown in Figure 1-8. Approximately a quarter of all U.S. workers belonged to a union in 1955 but, by 2014, union membership had dropped to just below 10 percent of total employment, roughly the same level as the mid-1930s. In some states, just 3 percent of workers belong to unions (CEA 2015c). Research suggests that declining unionization accounts for between a fifth and a third of the increase in inequality since the 1970s (Western and Rosenfeld 2011). Other research shows that union workers have higher wages than their nonunion counterparts, with unions raising wages by up to 25 percent for their workers compared with similar nonunion workers (Boskin 1972). Unions also increase the likelihood workers have access to benefits and work under safe conditions. Of course, other specific policies can help promote wage growth by affecting the division of economic rents. The minimum wage is one such policy, geared to those workers with the very-least bargaining power. A minimum wage protects some workers from having their lack of bargaining power exploited by firms in the wage negotiation, helping direct some of the rents from their job match to the workers themselves. But the real value of the minimum wage has declined [20] percent over the past three decades, losing its ability to protect workers in parallel with declining unionization.

Source: Troy and Sheflin (1985); Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Population Survey; Weir (1992); World Wealth and Income Database; CEA calculations. Greater support for collective bargaining and the minimum wage are both policies that can help address the increasingly unequal division of economic rents, promoting stronger wage growth and reduced inequality—and to the degree that such policies are about changing the divisions of rents, they need not reduce efficiency. In some respects, like improving worker’s voice and motivation, such policies can actually boost efficiency. Some Evidence for the Growth of Aggregate Rents The challenge is not just that the division of rents is changing based on comparative bargaining power. Moreover, the economic structure appears to be generating greater rents and tilting these toward profits and profitable firms. Corporate Profits and Interest Rates One important piece of evidence that rents are on the rise is the divergence of rising corporate profits and declining real interest rates. In the absence of economic rents, corporate profits should generally follow the path of interest rates, which reflect the prevailing return to capital in the economy. But over the past three decades, corporate profits have risen as interest rates have fallen, as shown in Figure 1-9. This suggests that some corporate profits could reflect an increase in the economic rents collected by corporations, not a “pure” return to capital. Of course, this divergence can 40 | Chapter 1 Percent 15 Figure 1-9 Corporate Profits and Real Interest Rates, 1985–2015 Corporate Profits as Share of Gross Domestic Income 10 2015 5 1-Year Real U.S. Treasury Rate 0 -5 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Note: Corporate profits for 2015 are an average of the first three quarters of the year.

Source: Census Bureau. be affected by other factors such as credit risk, but such factors are unlikely to explain the full gap. Market Concentration and the Distribution of Profits Another piece of evidence for the rising importance of rents is increased market concentration across a number of industries. Table 1-2 shows that the share of revenue earned by the largest firms increased across most industries between 1997 and 2007. This observation complements a range of studies that find increasing concentration in air travel, telecommunications, banking, food-processing, and other sectors of the economy. Increased concentration may play a role in the strikingly large and growing disparity in return to invested capital across major corporations (Furman and Orszag 2015). As shown in Figure 1-10, the returns earned by firms at the 90th percentile are now more than six times larger than those of the median firm, up from less than three times larger in 1990. Occupational Licensing There is also evidence of increased rent-seeking in the requirement of a government-issued license to be employed in certain professions (“occupational licensing”). As documented in Kleiner and Krueger (2013), the share of the U.S. workforce covered by state licensing laws grew five-fold in the 42 | Chapter 1 Percent 30 Figure 1-11 Share of Workers with a State Occupational License 2008 25 20 15 10 5 0 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000 2008 Source: Council of State Governments (1952); Greene (1969); Kleiner (1990); Kleiner (2006); and Kleiner and Krueger (2013), Westat data; CEA calculations. second half of the 20th century, from less than 5 percent in the early 1950s to 25 percent by 2008, as shown in Figure 1-11. Although state licenses account for the bulk of licensing, the addition of locally and Federally licensed occupations further raises the share of the workforce that is licensed to 29 percent. While licensing can play an important role in protecting consumer health and safety, there is evidence that some licensing requirements create economic rents for licensed practitioners at the expense of excluded workers and consumers—increasing inefficiency and potentially also increasing inequality. First, the employment barriers created by licensing raise wages for those who are successful in gaining entry to a licensed occupation by restricting employment in the licensed profession and lowering wages for excluded workers. Estimates find that unlicensed workers earn 10- to 15-percent lower wages than licensed workers with similar levels of education, training, and experience (Kleiner and Krueger 2010). Second, research finds that more restrictive licensing laws lead to higher prices for goods and services, in many cases for lower-income households, while the quality, health and safety benefits do not always materialize (Kleiner 2015). Finally, some state-specific licensing requirements create unnecessary barriers to entry for out-of-state licensed practitioners, reducing mobility across state lines (Johnson and Kleiner 2014). Inclusive Growth in the United States | 43 Housing and Land-Use Restrictions There is evidence that land-use regulation may also play a role in the presence of increased economic rents. Such regulation in the housing market can serve legitimate, welfare-enhancing purposes, such as restrictions that prohibit industrial activities from occurring alongside or within residential neighborhoods or limitations on the size of a dwelling due to a fragile local water supply. But when excessive and primarily geared toward protecting the interests of current landowners—including their property values—landuse regulations decrease housing affordability and reduce nationwide productivity and growth. These are impacts detailed in Chapters 2 and 6 of this Report, respectively. The presence of rents in the housing market, moreover, may also restrict labor mobility and exacerbate inequality. One main indication that land-use regulation gives rise to economic rents is that, in the aggregate, real house prices are higher than real construction costs, and this differential has increased since at least the early 1980s, as shown in Figure 1-12. In fact, Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005) find that more stringent land-use regulations have driven house price appreciation in excess of construction costs since 1970, before which time quality improvements actually drove much of the price increases. Further, in a large and growing set of U.S. cities—including major population centers such as New York and Los Angeles and high-productivity cities like San Francisco— home prices are usually at least 40 percent above construction costs. (Glaeser and Gyourko 2003). In addition, rental payments in the housing market in these areas often rise faster than wages. The Interplay of Inequality and Growth The relationship between inequality and growth continues to be the subject of much debate in the economics literature. The traditional finding for canonical policy responses to inequality, like progressive taxation and income support for low-income households, is that there is a tradeoff between equity and efficiency, the famous “leaky bucket” coined by Arthur Okun (1975). There has also been a long-standing macroeconomic debate about the consequences of inequality, with one traditional view being that more inequality leads to more savings by high-income households and thus a higher level of output (Duesenberry 1949). The current theory and evidence at both a micro and macro level is considerably more ambiguous than these traditional views and suggests a number of mechanisms by which inequality can be harmful to growth. As discussed above, one clear-cut example is that to the degree that inequality is 44 | Chapter 1 Figure 1-12 Real Construction Costs and House Prices, 1980–2013 Index, 1980=100 280 240 200 2013 Real House Prices 160 120 80 Real Construction Costs 40 0 1980 1985 1990 Source: Gyourko and Molloy (2015). 1995 2000 2005 2010 generated by anti-competitive rents, then fostering greater competition has the potential to improve both equity and efficiency simultaneously. But even with respect to inequality that stems from competitive markets, the relationship between such inequality and output is unclear. While there are no doubt respects in which such inequality can help motivate additional innovation and growth, a range of new research has also emphasized that there are a number of ways through which inequality may in fact constrain economic growth. This literature starts from the observation that the traditional emphasis on the quantity of capital, even if true, is dwarfed by the importance of the quality of capital, technology, and entrepreneurship. In particular, this approach emphasizes a number of ways by which inequality could harm growth: (1) by reducing access to the education necessary for the full population to reach its full potential; (2) by reducing entrepreneurship and risk-taking; (3) by undermining the trust necessary for a decentralized market economy and by increasing monitoring costs; and (4) by leading to increased political instability, growth-reducing policies, and uncertainty (Ostry, Berg, and Tsangarides 2014). In keeping with this, much recent microeconomic evidence finds important exceptions to the “leaky bucket.” For example, as discussed in Chapter 4, a number of anti-poverty programs focused on children have Inclusive Growth in the United States | 45 been shown to increase incomes in later life, illustrating the importance of the educational channel between inequality and growth. It is impossible to have the same degree of confidence about causation at the macroeconomic level as at the microeconomic level. There are no comparable natural experiments and the causality between inequality and growth clearly runs in both directions. Nevertheless, the fact that several recent papers have found that inequality is harmful to growth suggests—at a minimum—that it is unlikely that there is a substantial tradeoff between equality and growth. For example, cross-country analysis from Jonathan Ostry, Andrew Berg and Charalambos Tsangarides at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides better evidence of the harm done by inequality and the lack of harm done by progressive policies. The IMF study finds that inequality decreases both the magnitude and sustainability of growth and that progressive redistributive policies alone are neutral for the magnitude and sustainability of growth (with a small caveat that very large amounts of redistribution—those policies that redistribute above the 75th percentile of income—could have a small negative effect on growth). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also found associations between higher inequality and reduced growth across OECD member countries (Cingano 2014). The OECD focused on inequality of opportunity, particularly disparities in education, as the chief transmission mechanism of inequality’s restraint on growth. Ultimately, the link between growth and inequality at an aggregate level is ambiguous, not admitting a single direction for all co"
