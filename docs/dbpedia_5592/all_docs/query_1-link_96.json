        "text": "Kenya Moore will not return to The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 16 following her suspension, Deadline has learned\n\nThe reality star had been put on pause amid an investigation after filming a scene where she allegedly displayed sexual images of her co-star and newcomer Brittany Eady.\n\nAccording to a report by TMZ, Moore was not fired by Bravo, and the network is keeping the door open to have her return in the future. However, another source tells us the network didn’t discuss that option for now.\n\nMoore is also reportedly considering her legal options following the incident.\n\nRELATED: Kenya Moore Breaks Her Silence After ‘RHOA’ Season 16 Exit\n\nThe incident occurred while filming RHOA Season 16 at an event promoting one of Moore’s business ventures. According to videos of the event shared online, things took a turn when sexually explicit images of Eady were displayed.\n\nWhen the scandal went viral on social media, Moore took to Instagram and posted, “Believe none of what you hear and half of what you see. The truth always comes to light.”\n\nMoore also defended herself from claims she engaged in “revenge porn,” as she allegedly shared publicly available images.\n\nRELATED: ‘Real Housewives Of Atlanta’ Suspends Kenya Moore Over Disturbing Online Content\n\n“I would never engage in revenge porn, I have never distributed private images or footage of anyone, nor solicited images owned by others to use to threaten or blackmail,” Moore shared on X, formerly Twitter. “I have always been vindicated. I can’t talk about STORY even with people planting fake news.”\n\nMoore joined RHOA in Season 5 and maintained her peach for six seasons before taking a break in Season 11. The entrepreneur returned as a full-time housewife in Season 12 and had maintained her peach up until now.\n\nRHOA is in the middle of a reboot season, and Moore, alongside Drew Sidora, were the only two returning housewives from Season 15 returning for Season 16. Bravo also enlisted Porsha Williams for the new season after a two-season break, with former RHOA star Cynthia Bailey joining the show as a guest star. New cast additions included Angela Oakley, Eady, and Kelli Ferrell.\n\nAfter news that Moore was suspended, former RHOA star Kandi Burruss came to her defense."
