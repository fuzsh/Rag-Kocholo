Lajuana is also a cosmetologist, this was the job she spent 20 years in service, while also raising her four children.\n\n​\n\nLajuana draws her ingenuity from her aspiration for travel and her infatuation of different cultures. She doesn't consider herself being traditional but yet eclectic. “I refer to my style as a cross between Pippi Longstockings and Lena Horne; classic with a whole lotta’ edge! If you’re looking for cohesiveness then I'm not your girl. I like the freedom to change!” ATIV has been featured in shows and events in Detroit, Chicago, Columbia and Virginia. The industry has awarded her the opportunity to work with local TV Celebrities, Bianca Golden from Season 6 of ANTM and most recently Drew Sidora from the show, “The Game”.\n\nAlthough meeting new people is always exciting, faith and family comes first in her life and she prides herself on helping people feel and look beautiful!\n\nA “recovering super-woman” understanding that we are all flawed and imperfect yet can always learn from our mistakes and strive toward success. A woman of who juggles many hats: Daughter, Sister, Mother, Model, Make-Up Artist & Entrepreneur. At the age of four is when she was first introduced to the entertainment industry. She attended various modeling agencies & schools to gain experience and enhance her exposure. Her family was a part of the armed services which provided exposure to the vast cultures that make up our society. In her adolescent years, Jalía was very sincere about becoming a strong businesswoman.\n\n​\n\nBeing very active in her teen years, she began her college career at Western Michigan University in 1995 where she majored in both Interpersonal Communications & Business Management. Over the years she has planned & executed runway shows, events of all sort, attended numerous development workshops, conferences & seminars.
