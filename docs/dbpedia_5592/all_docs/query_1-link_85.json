        "text": "As all the reality television obsessives already know, 2023 was a really big year for our lord and saviour Bravo. Thanks to the Scandoval on Vanderpump Rules, Bravo‚Äôs reality programming hit the mainstream in a way we haven‚Äôt seen since the Jersey Shore crew fist-pumped their way into our collective hearts.\n\nI won‚Äôt lie and say that Bravo hasn‚Äôt delivered some extremely engaging content in this last year (Real Housewives of Salt Lake City season 4, I‚Äôm looking at you). But with increased interest and popularity comes scrutiny. From me, at least. There were many, many times this year while I was watching and consuming everything Bravo that I felt like I was witnessing some of the most misogynistic storylines, edits, PR plays, and online discourse I‚Äôve ever seen, all heavily spurred on and encouraged by a huge media conglomerate.\n\nFor a network that traffics almost exclusively in content for and by women, Bravo seems to base a significant portion of its business model on humiliating the women on their shows for money and ratings. And shockingly, the fanbase is actively participating in it.\n\nI know. It all sounds a bit dramatic. But after this year, after watching what happened to Rachel, Monica, Daisy, Lindsay and others, I remain convinced that the current strategy for Bravo involves picking a woman to be their sacrificial lamb on the altar of ratings and advertising dollars; a chosen one selected to absorb all the heat and ire, so the network can create bombshell, dramatic content that riles up the fanbase and, ultimately, feeds its bottom line (i.e., money).\n\nI‚Äôve consistently heard that there are clauses in reality TV contracts that essentially give the editing and production teams free reign to use the footage as they see fit. In other words, they can put scenes and sound bites into their own order and context to craft a compelling ‚Äî and insanely dramatic ‚Äî narrative.\n\nI feel like that rumour has never been as apparent as it is now. As a reality television connoisseur, aficionado, and all-around obsessive, I noticed that 2023 has reached new highs ‚Äî or rather, lows ‚Äî when it comes to how these stories are presented to the audience. 2023 was just not it for Bravo women. In fact, I‚Äôd argue that it was downright exploitative in terms of both storyline and fan reaction.\n\nStay with me on this journey. Here‚Äôs my list of all the women on Bravo who were given a rough ride in 2023 by the network and the fans.\n\nDrew Sidora ‚Äî Real Housewives of Atlanta\n\nSeason 15 of the RHOA wasn‚Äôt a great year for Drew. Not only did she break up with her (allegedly) cheating husband, she also got clowned for it.\n\nInstead of having any sort of sympathy edit, Drew was portrayed as a liar and kind of a joke. Cast members, including my personal favourite Kandi, flat out said she was lying about Ralph, who decided to pull the ol‚Äô switcheroo on Drew and accused her of cheating on him. Production even kept a scene of Ralph‚Äôs ‚Äúcousin‚Äù (she‚Äôs unverifiable) saying on a hot mic that Drew only wanted Ralph to pay for her child from a previous relationship, casting a suspicious cloud of doubt over Drew‚Äôs truth, her motivations, and the ins-and-outs of their relationship.\n\nOn top of that, production brought Ralph out at the reunion where he continued to accuse Drew of being a cheater. A definite choice because since when have any of the Housewives franchises been about the men? These shows are not about the husbands, no matter how much Bravo wants to expand their demographic. Why was Ralph at the reunion when none of the other men were? Why am I, as an audience member, being forced to hear the side of a man who has obviously cheated? Even if Drew did cheat, I Juan Dixon-style DON‚ÄôT CARE considering Ralph‚Äôs own history on the show.\n\nBut the cherry on top of it all was having Drew perform a song in front of this man. She made a moment of it like the industry professional she is, but, if we‚Äôre being honest, she was the butt of the joke. Andy cringed and laughed at Drew during her performance, which, of course, encouraged the fanbase to make fun too. We must follow King Andy in all he does.\n\nSince then, Atlanta has been put on pause while production tries to recalibrate. There are rumours that only a few long-standing peaches will be back, and I wonder if it‚Äôs because Drew decided to walk away from the show after that reunion. Apparently, she removed the RHOA tag from her bio way back when the reunion aired. And you know, after that edit, good for her.\n\nDaisy Kelliher ‚Äî Below Deck: Sailing Yacht\n\nThe Below Deck series takes a lot of pleasure in humiliating and terrorizing their chief stews and this season of Below Deck: Sailing Yacht was no exception. Daisy is the most charming, sweet and laid-back of all the chief stews we‚Äôve seen. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love ice queens Kate and Hannah, but Daisy brings an overall sunny disposition while handling interior pretty efficiently.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt matter how good Daisy is though because production is determined to break her. We started the most recent season with extra pressure on Miss Daisy. She‚Äôs been given two incompetent stews, of course, and extra-demanding guests. Whatever, we live for the drama, right? However, as is Below Deck tradition, not only is the chief stew getting it from the guests, the rest of the cast decide to make her life difficult too.\n\nThe deck crew never gives a single shit about helping the interior (that‚Äôs women‚Äôs work!), and it happened this season as well with not a single shit given that the interior team had to do more heavy lifting with the guests because the boat‚Äôs motor broke in episode one.\n\nEven Captain Glenn got in on the fun this year, barking at Daisy at one point to get more ice because he didn‚Äôt understand that the ice was already in the tender in the cooler. The weaponized incompetency of it all. He also took the obnoxious guests‚Äô side when they complained. Glenn even had the audacity to single Daisy out for her performance in front of the rest of the crew during a tip meeting. Funny how no one said anything about Glenn not noticing that his boat was on the verge of dying.\n\nIt‚Äôs such a typical storyline: the chief stew is overwhelmed and everyone disrespects her. However, this time was also slightly different because of the new and icky love triangle twist.\n\nWhen it was revealed that Daisy hooked up with Gary, my first thought was NOOOOOOOO, NOT GARY! Because to me, he‚Äôs always been a little creepy (turns out he‚Äôs allegedly much, much worse). But it‚Äôs not even my business who Daisy has sex with, so why is this such a major plot line?\n\nTo sum up: Daisy made out with Colin and he ended up throwing an emotional tantrum because Daisy never told him she fucked his friend (üôÑ). It‚Äôs bad enough that Gary smirked his way through revealing their tryst on camera when she said she‚Äôd wanted it kept private, but to then have another guy mad about it and not talking to her because of it and calling his sister to complain about it feels like a regression. We also got treated to a flashback montage of the three of them before this, apparently, very serious revelation, set to some of the most dramatic music outside of a film trailer.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt sit right with me having a stupid love triangle storyline set up as some sort of super-serious, friendship shattering fall-out caused by Daisy after she was already humiliated on the job at the top of the season. What‚Äôs funny and also sad is that now Bravo really has to rely on Daisy for the franchise because Gary‚Äôs having some, shall we say, bad press right now. It‚Äôs all very gross. Sorry Daisy, you deserve better from this show.\n\nTaylor Ann Green ‚Äî Southern Charm\n\nLast season, viewers got a front row seat to Taylor‚Äôs toxic relationship with Shep, which included him calling her an idiot for dropping an egg during an egg toss game. (I‚Äôll take this moment to remind you that Shep is over 40 years old and screamed at his much younger girlfriend over a game.)\n\nThis season, we open with Taylor obviously Going Through It after their break-up and melting down at parties over Shep and his cheating. And instead of holding Shep‚Äôs feet to the fire, production decided to give us a Taylor-as-a-wayward-woman storyline.\n\nDisappointing, but not surprising. And also, extremely tiring. It was episode after episode of the cast grilling Taylor about her sex life because of a secret kiss she shared with Austen after he and Olivia (Taylor‚Äôs friend for a minute) broke up and almost got back together or something (it‚Äôs so boring and convoluted I can barely follow it). All season, Taylor was dragged for the kiss (not Austen though, of course) and pressured to apologize again and again to Olivia. Pretty quickly it morphed from being honest to being really sorry to taking accountability to, finally, Taylor being told she had to admit she had sex with Austen because that‚Äôs what a blog post said she did.\n\nOn top of that, Taylor was exposed and shamed by everyone for sending a nude photo to much older cast member and executive producer Whitney. The age gap and power dynamic is shady enough, but they didn‚Äôt stop there. A number of cast members, including Whitney‚Äôs geriatric mother Patricia, Craig, Madison, and Leva, openly said on camera that they saw Taylor‚Äôs nudes and messages.\n\nI expected the fanbase to pick up on the grossness that is Taylor‚Äôs nudes being shared without her consent, but instead, a lot of fans have decided that Taylor deserves the heat for breaking ‚Äúgirl code‚Äù and also, that she may actually be the sexual harasser here for sending Whitney nudes against his will (we do not actually know anything about how or why these nudes were sent ‚Äî it‚Äôs so fascinating how so much of the story gets cut out to produce ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù moments).\n\nSorry, but I am desperately uninterested in a ‚Äúthis woman is acting too slutty‚Äù reality TV storyline in this day and age. That‚Äôs why I was shocked to the point of feeling enraged when Venita made a blink-and-you‚Äôll-miss-it comment in Jamaica blaming Taylor after she whined about feeling verbally abused by her cast mates for whatever it is that happened with Austen while they were both single. Taylor was for sure exaggerating, but she was definitely getting picked on, so I have trouble understanding why Venita would want to chime in under her breath about why Taylor was complaining about being verbally abused because she ‚Äústole someone‚Äôs man‚Äù.\n\nSo, following that logic, that means Taylor deserves to get dragged and ganged up on for kissing some guy? It‚Äôs always a disappointment when this attitude comes from another woman because in no way should we ever normalize bashing a woman over a kiss or a hook up.\n\nI feel bad for Taylor. It‚Äôs one thing to be on TV, but it‚Äôs another to have your sexual history put out there and actively judged. Not a fun storyline. Shocking that they even tried it, but after Scandoval and big ratings, I guess anything goes when it comes to shaming women for sex on Bravo.\n\nLindsay Hubbard ‚Äî Summer House\n\nThe new season of Summer House has no start date yet, but already, I can tell that it‚Äôs going to be another rough ride for our Hubb House.\n\nLast year wasn‚Äôt exactly easy for her either. Lindsay‚Äôs started dating Carl and this sent the rest of the cast into a spiral. They called her a bitch, pretended like they didn‚Äôt know why she was upset after getting caught on a hot mic saying she ‚Äútainted‚Äù Carl, and even accused her of having a fake relationship, fake engagement, and no job.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I felt so bad for Hubbs when it came out at the end of August that Carl blindsided her by ending their engagement a few months out from the wedding on camera after filming ended. Oh god, I thought. Now the haters are really going to have some shit to talk about. A break-up that close to a wedding is basically being left at the altar. It‚Äôs so embarrassing and humiliating on its own, but to have it blasted out to the entire world within hours of it happening is really something else. That‚Äôs a whole new level of betrayal that I didn‚Äôt think was possible, but the men on Bravo truly never cease to amaze me with the bullshit they pull.\n\nHowever, despite Carl being the one to dump his fianc√© and best friend on camera, there are a lot of fans and gossip bloggers coming up with justifications as to why Carl would want to do this to her. Yes, there are people insisting that Lindsay must‚Äôve done something to prompt Carl to humiliate her like that. The rationales have ranged from Lindsay being a drunk putting Carl‚Äôs sobriety on the line to those convinced she‚Äôs spinning information to make Carl ‚Äúlook bad‚Äù. There are those that keep insisting Lindsay is toxic and abusive and Carl wanted the cameras there to make sure she didn‚Äôt turn it around or do something to him. Then there those who believe she needs to take accountability for being dumped because there‚Äôs no way she couldn‚Äôt have seen it coming.\n\nWhy are we running with the assumption that Lindsay must‚Äôve ‚Äúdone‚Äù something to make Carl act so callous? What is with the obsession that she needs to take accountability for the break-up? It‚Äôs the same attitude I witnessed during the Amber Heard/Johnny Depp trial where the majority was obsessed with the idea that Heard must have done something to her husband to make him hit her.\n\nThis is the new normal. The woman needs to be held accountable for her behaviour. Even when she‚Äôs the dumpee, she needs to take accountability. But bring up that Ariana stayed with a man she knew cheated on her before and you will incur a lot of wrath for ‚Äúblaming women‚Äù. Apparently, it‚Äôs only okay to blame certain women. The double-standards make it all so confusing. But the biggest double standard remains ‚Äî men can cross the line and that‚Äôs status quo, but women need to toe it in order to get a bare minimum of respect.\n\nThe information that came out at the start of all this was that Carl called up production to get cameras to cover their break-up. Production has tried to deny it, but all the early articles made it clear that Carl wanted the engagement called off and he wanted cameras there to document it. It‚Äôs pretty low, in my opinion, to drum up interest for your show by capitalizing on someone‚Äôs pain, and also by secretly setting up a scene with one party to blindside another. But that‚Äôs Bravo, baby! I guess we should get used to it.\n\nAriana Madix ‚Äî Vanderpump Rules\n\nI guess you could say that, overall, Ariana had a great 2023. Bravo‚Äôs darling, aka the Scorned Woman, made it to the mainstream and gained a whole bunch of fans by being a core part of the reality television cheating scandal that rocked the fanbase for the better part of a year.\n\nAfter news broke that Tom cheated on her with their friend Rachel, Ariana went on a nation-wide tour to talk about being cheated on. She was in Glamor and The New York Times, snagged national TV appearances, did podcast interviews, got brand endorsements and sponsorships, was cast in a Lifetime movie and Dancing with the Stars, will be in Chicago, released a new cocktail book, and enjoyed many other promotional opportunities like serving chicken tenders to fans at a fast-food joint. She apparently made a million dollars off of it all.\n\nUnfortunately, all that opportunity came off of being cheated on by her boyfriend of ten years (again). While I‚Äôll never been one of the fans who saw this cheating scandal as fundamentally different from every other cheating scandal on Vanderpump Rules, I will say that it was notable considering the length of time Tom and Ariana were together (a lifetime, really, when it comes to public relationships). I can‚Äôt imagine how humiliating it would be to find out that your boyfriend was having a months-long love affair with a younger co-worker who you defended (when convenient) on the show, to say nothing of admitting to an entire nation that he had cheated on your multiple times after you said for years he never did.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure that having an entire network monetize your personal betrayal is as fun and lucrative as it may seem. Sure, Ariana got fame and a lot of opportunity, but at what cost? She‚Äôs had her relationship nitpicked by everyone (including me). I consume this as entertainment, but I do wonder what this level of scrutiny on your life feels like. Ariana will be known as the Woman Who Was Cheated On for the rest of her life. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶not so sure that‚Äôs something I‚Äôd ever want to be famous for ‚Äî but I guess Jen Aniston also did it with great success.\n\nBut I‚Äôm not convinced it was that great of a performance, honestly. Her behaviour at the reunion was too much, too over the top, too vitriolic towards Rachel and not towards the partner who betrayed and embarrassed her. Now she‚Äôs going to waste all that hard earned money suing Tom over their house.\n\nIt‚Äôs all pretty cringe. Ariana has a team. Vanderpump Rules has producers. And they all convinced her that this was a good idea. It isn‚Äôt going to age well, especially not if more secrets get revealed about what went on behind the scenes.\n\nBravo has done Ariana a disservice, ultimately. And with production giving Sandoval what is sure to be a redemption edit, I‚Äôm not sure she‚Äôs going to be able to keep much control over this narrative. What goes up, must come down. And if it suits them, Bravo will let Ariana go down, in flames preferably, so they can make sure to maintain those sky-ratings they achieved by throwing Rachel under the bus.\n\nRachel Leviss ‚Äî Vanderpump Rules\n\nSpeaking of, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anyone on Bravo who‚Äôs had a worse year than Rachel. My homegirl had to deal with an unhinged, nation-wide hate campaign that includes fans, media and brands trashing and making fun of her for being The Girl Who Slept with Ariana‚Äôs Man.\n\nIt was, and still is, intense. She was called whore, cunt, moron, subhuman by the cast and that just inspired the rest of the fans to go even lower. The hate and backlash she received was so over the top it affected my daily moods and I ended up block and muting almost every Bravo-adjacent account on social media because I just didn‚Äôt want to hear it anymore. I still get into weekly fights on reddit because fans don‚Äôt want to let go of the hate train and continue to call her a disgusting, trash, crazy, stupid, etc., because she had an affair on a reality show that was founded on cheating.\n\nIt got so bad and went so far that Rachel and her family received death threats from fans who called up her parents and said they were going to kill her and dump the body. She disappeared from the public eye and checked into a facility for mental health treatment. That alone should‚Äôve been the call to make this whole thing stop, but Bravo stayed silent.\n\nThen, in the middle of the summer, after Rachel completed her 90-day treatment for trauma therapy, there was a story leaked to TMZ about her dog, that she had to give up while taking care of her mental health, being given to James, her former fianc√© who was known for screaming at her and ‚Äúbumping‚Äù her in the face so hard he fucked up her nose job. Once this story inspired a new wave of insane fans ripping her apart online, it was announced that Rachel would not be returning to the show.\n\nRachel has since started a podcast and confirmed that the dog was being used by Lisa Vanderpump as a way to reach out to her and get her to come back and talk about why she left so abruptly. Well Lisa, did you think that maybe she never came back because your production created and enabled such a hostile environment that people thought it was totally okay to call up her family and say they wanted to kill her?\n\nProduction and cast members have yet to comment on any of this. Ariana has never said anything, which is especially rich considering she‚Äôs made mental health awareness her storyline for multiple seasons. Andy has also never apologized for speculating that Rachel was ‚Äúheavily medicated‚Äù while filming the reunion, but I suspect no one wants to open themselves up to criticism or worse, legal repercussions.\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean that all of this isn‚Äôt completely disgusting and exploitative. At least Rachel has her podcast and the opportunity to speak for herself after everyone decided to trash her for doing what we expect reality TV stars to do ‚Äî fuck up their lives for our entertainment.\n\nMonica Garcia ‚Äî Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\n\nYou can say Monica had a great rookie season in 2023. No one else from this franchise was talked about more and even Mr. Boss Man Andy Cohen said that he found Monica‚Äôs storyline about buying a bag out of her budget to fit in with the other women compelling. She was Bravo‚Äôs new fresh face, getting a lot of early press because she brought realness and a breath of fresh air to a set of franchises that platform ‚Äúrich‚Äù women and their material lives.\n\nBut there was, of course, backlash for Monica for making such a big splash. Fans went from calling her incredible to calling her annoying, trashy, rude. Speculating that her storyline with her mother and their toxic relationship was for show, that Monica was lying, that her stories and behaviour were too emotionally dark, that she was too reactive, that she dealt out too many low blows. On and on and on.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt help that she got sued by Heather and Beauty Lab + Laser for non-payment (Monica countered that the injections she received were botched and she refused to pay past the initial membership fee). Accounts started accusing her of stealing Lisa Barlow‚Äôs missing $60K ring. By the time it was revealed that Monica was part of an Instagram burner account that exposed Jen Shah and said some mid gossip about the other women on the cast, the fanbase was rabid.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt help, in my opinion, that Heather got such a hero edit in the finale and was able to narrate a whole story about why Monica is terrible for participating in an anonymous gossip account before she was on the show. Heather got most of the talking head confessionals and a majority of the screen time to set-up this shocking reveal that resulted in Monica getting screamed at by everyone with no allies to defend her.\n\nThe fans have kicked it into overdrive now, going on about how she‚Äôs actually crazy, unhinged, a stalker, a liar, not to be trusted. People are going so far as to say they‚Äôre concerned for the safety of the rest of the cast. It‚Äôs all pretty stupid and overblown considering we know that all people on reality TV use burner accounts and send out tips to get audience love and, most importantly, get back at the cast mates they hate.\n\nProduction has left Monica to fend for herself. Monica‚Äôs former friend ‚Äî who also ran the account and is, inexplicably, still Heather‚Äôs friend and hairdresser after all her screaming, crying, and throwing up about Monica‚Äôs involvement ‚Äî has released voice memos and videos to smear Monica‚Äôs reputation. Production is too busy trying to absolve themselves of all of this by claiming that they had nooooooooooooo idea when they cast Monica that she was part of Reality von Tease.\n\nThat‚Äôs really hard to believe considering Heather sued Monica three weeks before the season started to tee-up her little storyline. Add to that the fact that Monica‚Äôs family pulled out of filming during the Bermuda trip and Monica has no idea why.\n\nThis is coming off like a coordinated effort to isolate her on the show. And it‚Äôs really gross to watch production and the cast lead Monica to slaughter when she really hasn‚Äôt done anything that different than anyone else on this franchise ‚Äî or, frankly, on this entire network.\n\nThe only difference is that Monica‚Äôs in a lower tax bracket. She was an assistant to Jen Shah, therefore she‚Äôs a lowly working-class woman without a big house, but she was still able to run circles around the richer, most established cast with ease while garnering a lot of audience sympathy and support. Is this really how we should treat our proletariat housewives or women in general? I don‚Äôt think so.\n\nSadly, I don‚Äôt think Bravo ultimately cares. They seem to think riling up the fanbase with these sensational storylines that veer into misogynistic territory are completely fine and par for the course. As a Bravo watcher, I‚Äôm naturally a hypocrite because I still watch all of this for entertainment. What can I say, I‚Äôm addicted to these women and trash reality programming. But personally, I‚Äôm a little scared to see what the rest of 2024 has in store for the women on Bravo. For all our sakes, I hope it gets a little less volatile and a little more fun again."
