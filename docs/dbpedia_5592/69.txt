Drew Sidora recently revealed that she still lives with her soon-to-be ex-husband, Ralph Pittman.

During a recent interview, Sidora revealed that a court order required her to allow Pittman to continue to live in their marital home. She also believes that Pittman is holding up the divorce process by taking more “from the marriage than what he bought.”

The 39-year-old spoke about it after she was asked about her divorce. “It’s still not settled and yes, we’re still living together under the same roof…I didn’t even know that could happen. I was like, ‘What?’ But yeah — he is living in the basement, and that was court-ordered,” she said.

Sidora continued by revealing that forcing Pittman to stay in the same house is stopping them from moving on from the relationship. “It’d be much easier if we were able to move on separately; you know, out of sight, out of mind, with your own space and your own energy. But that’s clearly not in the cards…so sharing space has been a double whammy…We’re kind of like, the blueprint for a s—show divorce.”

In 2023, Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman filed for divorce in 2023 within hours of each other. They were married for 8 years and they have two children together, 9-year-old Machai and 6-year-old, Aniya. The actress has a 13-year-old boy from a previous relationship. Sidora went on to say that Pittman was a serial cheater and that he was mentally abusive.

He denied all allegations against him. Drew went on to suggest that greed was the real problem in their marriage. “When you’re dealing with someone who wants everything and is just not willing to walk away with what he came in with, it makes it very, very hard…I’m just learning how this process can go in the worst-case scenario. And I’m taking it literally one day at a time.”
