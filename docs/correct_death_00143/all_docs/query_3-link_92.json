        "text": "His success really was out of this world – but Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy author Douglas Adams once came close to jacking in ­writing and becoming a shipping clerk, his ­private diaries reveal.\n\nSelf-critical and often fearing his efforts were “utter rubbish”, he had nearly given up after years of dreaming of writing for Doctor Who. And then, just as he was considering moving to Hong Kong to get a “proper job” with P&O, word came from the BBC. It was accepting two of his scripts – Hitchhiker’s for radio and The Pirate Planet for Doctor Who.\n\nAfter years of plugging away, plagued by self-doubt, a diary entry from July 12, 1977 reveals Cambridge-born Douglas’s elation. “One of the best days of my life,” the 25-year-old wrote in his journal. “They loved The Pirate Planet… loved H.H.G.” He adds “I shall be released” and “Phone John Cleese” – a touching reference to wanting to let his comic hero, who he had met, know of his good fortune.\n\nThe never-before-seen diary entry is captured in a new book, 42: The Wildly Improbable Ideas of Douglas Adams, which provides intimate insights on the weird and wonderful workings of the creative genius and humorist’s mind. The book’s editor Kevin Jon Davies – a long-time pal and colleague of the sci-fi writer – recounts the day that changed Douglas’s life forever.\n\nKevin recalls how his friend was living in a London flatshare at the time, saying: “That was the day they were reading the Doctor Who script he’d written and they loved it. “At the same time he heard that the programme review board at the BBC Radio had also approved Hitchhiker’s. Douglas had almost given up on ­everything and nearly took a job for P&O in Hong Kong as a shipping clerk to get a proper job. So I guess it was the beginning of everything.”\n\nDouglas had been dreaming of writing for Doctor Who since his teens. His student notebook in 1972 shows ideas for an episode called ‘Travel Forward’, with a doodle of the Tardis. In his scrawly hand, Douglas writes about being “caught in ‘time-pocket’” and mentions a “space-time continuum”. “At prep school, he’d written this sketch about Daleks being powered by Rice Krispies,” filmmaker Kevin says. “So even then, he was thinking about it.”\n\nOnce the BBC accepted those two scripts in 1977, Douglas’s career had lift-off. His five Hitchhiker’s books – featuring characters such as Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin the Paranoid Android – sold 15 million copies in his lifetime and were made into a Radio 4 series in 1978, a TV series in 1981 and a feature film in 2005.\n\nWhen he died of a heart attack in 2001, aged 49, Douglas left 67 boxes of documents, letters, scripts, poems and scribbles, which daughter Polly Jane Rocket Adams and other family members entrusted to Kevin to go through for a book. The pair met in 1978 when Kevin, just 17, interviewed the author for a fanzine. They became close and Kevin worked with him on the TV adaptation of Hitchhiker’s and on Doctor Who.\n\nAlthough Douglas was constantly “bursting with ideas”, Kevin says the writing process was not always easy. He recalls: “His notebooks are hilarious because each one starts with a fresh burst of enthusiasm, saying, ‘I’m going to write something new every day, even if it’s crap, I’m going to make sure I write something.’ And then six pages later it fizzles out and the rest of the book is blank.\n\n“He hated the lonely business of sitting at the typewriter, bashing out the ideas and ‘staring at a blank piece of paper until your forehead bleeds’, as he would say. He would fight with himself on the page, sometimes breaking off in the middle of a piece and writing, ‘Douglas, you’re writing utter rubbish’.”\n\nThen came July 12, 1977. Kevin explains the John Cleese footnote in the diary entry – long-time admirer Douglas had interviewed the Monty Python star for Cambridge University magazine Varsity. “So when he had his big, exciting day, of course the first person he wanted to tell was his hero.”\n\nDouglas’s exuberant creativity presented Doctor Who producers with quite a challenge. Kevin says: “I recall him saying when he read the story-line out to the producer, he sank lower and lower in his chair and said, ‘Now I know how Stanley Kubrick felt’. Douglas was demanding things like a flying car and inertialess corridors, which they had to try to realise on a budget – one famously getting tighter and tighter in the 70s.”\n\nKevin, 62, who lives in North London with his wife Elaine and son Liam, 31, who also works in TV, always looked up to Douglas – not least because he was 6ft 5in tall. “Douglas had a way of turning a phrase and delivering a thought that made you stop and think – and it would often involve a laugh,” he says.\n\n“He would set up these very complex, long sentences with sub-clauses and parentheses, and at the very last word, he would whip the rug from underneath you and make you laugh. He inspired people with a unique perspective and everyone whose lives he touched – even those who never met him – felt like they knew him through his books.”\n\nIn the 1990s, Douglas and his actor wife Jane Belson, who died in 2011, became famous for parties at their home in Islington, North London. “He would have rock stars playing there, like David Gilmour from Pink Floyd,” Kevin says. \"These parties would be packed with titans of the industry, a real mix of people like Clive Sinclair and Salman Rushdie, all sitting cross-legged on the floor because there was nowhere else to sit.”\n\nThe last time Kevin saw his pal was in 1998, when Douglas, who moved to California the following year, was speaking at the annual Public Science Drama Awards. “He was mobbed when he came off the stage,” Kevin says. “And that was my last vision of him, surrounded by adoring fans.”"
