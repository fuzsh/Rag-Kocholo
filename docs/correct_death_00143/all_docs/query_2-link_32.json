        "text": "Ten years ago today, author Douglas Adams passed away. Perhaps you remember his comedy sci-fi bestseller, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" and if you don't, you obviously haven't read it. It's unreasonably hilarious.\n\nAdams, a Brit wit, intellectual and outspoken atheist, died terribly young, at 49, of a heart attack. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins wrote a eulogy for him, and famously dedicated his book \"The God Delusion\" to Adams, and summed him up perfectly: \"Science has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the mountain gorilla and the black rhino have lost a gallant defender.\"\n\nSo, in the spirit of Adams' work, I've ceremoniously typed eight ways to commemorate his passing. I would never profess to being as funny as he is - few in the world could even claim such a thing - but his writing has been an inspiration for this humble scribe, who has read the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" series probably a dozen times, and can only hope to do him justice.\n\n1. Don't panic. The \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" classic catchphrase is good advice on any day, in any situation, really. It worked when I recently dropped the fingernail clippers in the toilet by accident.\n\n2. Re-read Adams' terrifically funny, insightful piece about the internet. The article, which ran in The London Times in 1999, is proof that he's a wise humorist. On not trusting what you read on the internet, he wrote, \"What should concern us is not that we can't take what we read on the internet on trust – of course you can't, it's just people talking – but that we ever got into the dangerous habit of believing what we read in the newspapers or saw on the TV – a mistake that no one who has met an actual journalist would ever make.\"\n\n3. Pen some terrible poetry. \"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in my Armpit One Midsummer Morning\" is my favorite piece of odious Vogon verse. It cracked me up as a lad reading \"Hitchhiker's Guide,\" and still does as an adult. Of course, Vogon poetry is only the third worst in the universe, remember, so we can aim to usurp its spot with, perhaps, a rumination on bellybutton lint or the irrepressible hijinks of your cat.\n\n4. Miss a deadline. \"I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by\" is one of his most famous quotes, one appreciated by every writer out there. (In fact, this blog is a year late, originally started to remember the ninth year of Adams' passing. I seem to recall blowing one in homage when I reviewed the passable-but-not-exemplary 2005 Hollywood movie adaptation of \"Hitchhiker's Guide.\")\n\n5. Don't forget your towel. The indispensable tool of the intergalactic hitchhiker, it has a variety of uses in a myriad of situations, i.e., \"to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you).\" I just used mine to swamp up some spilled coffee. It was given to me as a high-school graduation present by a very clever, astute friend, who, if you're reading this, thank you again. Note: The official celebration of Towel Day is May 25. Mark your calendars. Not joking.\n\n6. Keep in mind that you will never be as miserable as Marvin, the Paranoid Android. No matter your predicament, at least you never spent millions and millions of years being depressed. \"The first ten million years were the worst,\" he said. \"And the second ten million years, they were the worst too. After that, I went into a bit of a decline.\"\n\n7. Invent or discover the Babel Fish. Whoops. Someone did it already. But that the tool was named after the creature from Adams' stories is evidence of his place in pop culture history.\n\n8. Remember that 42 is the ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything. \"42 (forty-two) is the natural number following 41 and preceding 43,\" reads Wikipedia, amusingly droll, as if written by Adams himself. Does anyone know the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything yet?"
