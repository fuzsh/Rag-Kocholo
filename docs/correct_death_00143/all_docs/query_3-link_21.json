I will hear no argument. The best.) If, like me, you can recognize and recite parts of the passage on the towel he's draped himself with in the above video, you don't need me to say any more about that. But he was also a committed environmentalist who devoted a chunk of his post-Hitchhiker's Guide career to increasing awareness about endangered species.\n\nTry this on for activism: He climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in a rhinoceros suit to raise money to save the black rhino. What did YOU climb in a rhinoceros suit to save endangered animals? I THOUGHT SO. (Okay, to be fair he wore the suit before the climb actually started, but still.) And for his radio series Last Chance to See, Adams traveled the world having encounters with near-extinct species like the mountain gorilla and the manatee, creatures his audience might never have heard of but suddenly found themselves wanting to preserve."
