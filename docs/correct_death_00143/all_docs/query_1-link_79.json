        "text": "British author and humorist, best known for the comic science-fiction series The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1979). Though primarily characterized as a science fiction author, Douglas Adams always insisted that he is a \"comedy writer\" who merely uses \"the devices of science fiction to send up everything else.\" Basically the series carries on the old tradition of fantastic voyages to other worlds (Lucian's Icaro-Menippus, Cyrano de Bergerac's Other Worlds, Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, etc), in which the form serves as a vehicle for satire on contemporary society.\n\nThe Histoy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is now so complicated that every time I tell it I contradict myself, and whenever I do get it right I'm misquoted. So the publication of this omnibus edition seemed like a good oppostunity to set the record straight – or at least firmly crooked. Anything that is put down wrong here is, as far as I'm concerned, wrong for good. ('A Guide to the Guide: Some unhelpful remarks from the author,' in The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy: A Trilogy in Four Parts, Pan Books, 1992, p. 7)\n\nDouglas Noël Adams was born in Cambridge, the son of Christopher Douglas Adams, who had abandoned taking holy orders for teaching, and Janet (Donovan) Adams, a nurse. After his birth, the family moved to London. Adams didn't learn to speak until he was almost four. His parents divorced in 1957, and he moved with his mother and sister to live with his grandmother in Brentwood, Essex. Both of his parents remarried later. At school Adams excelled in creative writing. He was also much taller than the other children, and many of his Masters. Moreover, he was forced to wear short trousers. Adams's first publication was a short story, entitled 'Suspense' (1965), in the popular boys' comic Eagle.\n\nWhile St. John's College at Cambridge University, Adams became a member of the Footlights Revue Club, an amateur theatrical club run by students, which at one time had included several members of the Monty Python troupe. Upon graduating from Cambridge with a B.A. in literature in 1974, Adams moved back to London, where worked as a free-lance comedy scriptwriter. He also took on a series of odd jobs.\n\nIn 1974 Adams was given the opportunity to write for the fourth series of Monty Python show ('A Doctor Whose Patients Are Stabbed by His Nurse'), and he had two brief appearances on the sceen. Later he said, \"I would certainly not lay claim to being a contributory writer for Python because Python was those six guys, and my role was quite incidental and coincidental.\" With Graham Chapman he wrote sketches for the television show Out of the Trees (1975) and an episode for Doctor on the Go (1977). Adams and Chapman first met at the opening of the West End run of Chox, the Footlights revue.\n\n'The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a sort of electronic book. It tells you everything you need to know about anything. That's its job.' (in The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy: A Trilogy in Four Parts, 1992, p. 47)\n\nThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy was originally presented as a 12-part radio series. At the same time when he was writing episodes of Hitchhiker, he worked also as a script editor on Doctor Who TV series, starring Tom Baker as the iconic Doctor. According to Adams, he based the original idea partly on a travel book, the Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Europe; he had carried a copy of it with him when he traveled around the Continent in the early 1970. Adams was not keen on science fiction. \"I've started most science fiction books but only got about page 10, I'm afraid, usually,\" he said in an interview. His comic influences in literature were Lewis Carroll and P.G. Wodehouse.\n\nFollowing the success of the series, Adams was asked by Pan Books to write a novel based on his radio scripts. The book went to the top of the London Times best-seller list. Adams's protagonist is an Englisman named Arthur Dent. When Earth is destroyed by Vogons to make way for a hyperspatial express route, Arthur is saved by his friend, Ford Prefect, an alien who is a contributor to an electronic Baedeker, \"The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". Readers are also given answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. The answer is 42. (Adams told The Independent in 1996 that he chose the number because he \"wanted a nice, ordinary number, one that you wouldn't mind taking home and introducing to your parents.\") It has been argued that Lewis Carroll was particularly interested in that number. In the poem 'The Hunting of the Snark', the only rule quoted is No 42. In addition, there are many open and hidden references to 42 in Alice in Wonderland. (The Mystery of Lewis Carroll by Jenny Wolf, 2010, pp. 56-58).\n\nAs unlike it as could possibly be – bar the infectious wit – was Dimensions of Miracles (1968), Sheckley's best novel in the sixties. In that work Thomas Carmody finds himself . . . involved in the wider galaxy of ingtelligent aliens, having won the Intergalactic Sweepstakes. . . . Insanely logical as it is, it puts the Big Questions as perhaps they ought to be put – comically. Some of us grieved when Douglas Adams came along with his Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and grew rich doing the Sheckleyan things which appeared to keep Sheckley poor. (Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction by Brian Aldiss with David Wingrove, House of Stratus, 2001, p. 378)\n\nEventually the Hitch Hiker's Guide evolved into a five-novel \"trilogy\" although after the third installment Adams had got tired of \"sitting in the dark room and writing\". He moved in 1983 to Los Angeles to work on a film version of the story. The movie was never made and Adams returned to England, feeling that he had hit his first major failure in his career.\n\nWith Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987), portraying a private eye, Adams introduced a new angle into the genre of mystery fiction. Dirk Gently, whose real name is Svlad Cjelli, explains that \"The term 'holistic' refers to my conviction that what we are concerned with here is the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. I do not concern myself with such petty things as fingerprint powder, telltale pieces of pocket fluff and inane footprints. I see the solution to each problem as being detectable in the pattern and web of the whole. The connections between causes and effects are often much more subtle and complex than we with our rough and ready understanding of the physical world might naturally suppose, Mrs Rawlinson. \" (Ibid., New York: Pocket Books, 1988, pp. 144-145) Dirk Gently does not eliminate the completely impossible, but accepts ghosts, time travel and aliens as a part of the solution. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has said that it is the only book he has ever read from cover to cover and then again from cover to cover. Dirk Gently also featured in The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (1988). In the middle of a personal crisis, Adams went with the zoologist Mark Carwardine on a journey in search of endangered species. Their research resulted in a BBC radio series and a book entitled Last Chance to See (1990).\n\nMuch of his career, Adams suffered from writer's block and frequent crises of confidence. John Lloyd, which whom Adams collaborated on The Meaning of Liff (1983) and The Deeper Meaning of Liff (1990), recalled: \"We were on holiday in Corfu with three friends when he was finishing a book, and he ended up taking over the whole house. He had a room to write in, a room to sleep in, a room to go when he couldn't sleep, and so on. It didn't occur to him that other people might want a good night's sleep as well. He goes through life with a brain the size of a planet, and often seems to be living on a different one.\" (quoted in 'Prologue' by Nicholas Wroe, in The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time by Douglas Adams, Harmony Books, 2002, p. xxiv)\n\nBesides books, Adams wrote computer games, created a CD-ROM version of Last Chance to See, and established with a founder of Wired magazine and others a production company, the Digital Village, which produced the DC-ROM Starship Titanic. Terry Jones of the Monty Python team adapted the computer game into a novel and made two introductions for the U.S. paperback edition of The Salmon of Doubt (2002).\n\nAdams once said, \"I have a well-deserved reputation for being something of a gadget freak, and am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that it would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand. Ten seconds, I tell myself, is ten seconds. Time is valuable and ten seconds' worth of it is well worth the investment of a day's happy activity working out a way of saving it.\" (Last Chance to See by Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine, Harmony Books, 1991, p. 38) After giving up writing books with a typewriter (Hermes Standard 8), Adams became known as an Apple fan. Both Adams and Stephen Fry have claimed to be the first person in Britain to own an Apple Macintosh. Stephen Fry narrated the audiobook of the Hitch Hiker's Guide when it was released in 2012. An amateur musician, Adams played guitar and piano. Dawkins dedicated his book The God Delusion (2006) to Adams, quoting a line from the Hitch Hiker's Guide: \"Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe there are fairies a the bottom of it?\" (Ibid., Pocket Books, 1981, p. 118)\n\nAdams was married to Jane Belson; they had one daughter. In 1999 he moved with his family to Santa Barbara, California, partly in order to secure funding for a big-screen adaptation of the Hitch Hiker's Guide. Adams died of hear attack on May 11, 2001, in Montecito. Adams's friends Gary Brooker, the leader of Procol Harum, and the Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmous performed at his memorial service. Eventually, in 2005, the long-awaited film version of the book, directed by Garth Jennings and starring Martin Freeman, was released. The audience really wanted to love the film, but simply couldn't. \"The movie was more of a revue than a narrative, more about moments than an organizing purpose, and cute to the point that I yearned for some corrosive wit from its second cousin, the Monty Python universe.\" (Roger Ebert, April 28, 2005)\n\nFor further reading: '\"The Game's Afoot\": Predecessors and Pursuits of a Postmodern Detective Novel' by Kathleen Belin Owen, in Theory and Practice of Classic Detective Fiction, edited by Jerome H.
