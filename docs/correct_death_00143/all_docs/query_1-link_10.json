        "text": "Author Douglas Adams, who wrote The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, has died suddenly aged 49. Mr Adams died on Friday morning in Santa Barbara, California, following a heart attack, said his spokeswoman Sophie Astin.\n\nThe author became a household name with the Hitch-Hiker‘s radio 4 series, which spurred a cult science fiction novel and was turned into a BBC TV series.\n\nPublished in 1979, the novel was a satirical adventure about a group of intergalactic travellers. It was followed by the sequels The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life, the Universe and Everything and So Long and Thanks For All the Fish.\n\nIn recent years the author had been working on a Hitchhiker’s Guide movie, which it was hoped might see release in 2002.\n\nAdams was married with a daughter.\n\nHe will be much missed.\n\n• Visit his official web site: www.DouglasAdams.com\n\n• Books by Douglas Adams (Amazon UK Affiliate Link)"
