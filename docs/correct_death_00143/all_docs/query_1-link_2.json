        "text": "Share\n\nPrint\n\nNews in Science\n\nDeath of the hitch-hiker's guide\n\nDouglas Adams, cult science fiction author, has died at the age of 49 from a heart attack in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nHis best selling book, The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, published in 1979, sold more than 14 million copies. It first appeared as a radio show in 1978 and in the 1980's it became a BBC TV series and Adams became a household name.\n\nAdams studied at Cambridge and was a member of the Footlights theatre group before working in radio and later as script editor and writer on the TV sci-fi classic, Dr Who.\n\nThe Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy followed the intergallactic adventures of Earthman Arthur Dent who hitched a ride on a passing starship after his planet, Earth, was destroyed to make way for a freeway.\n\nThere were four more titles in the series, The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe; Life, The Universe And Everything; So Long, And Thanks For All The Fish; and Mostly Harmless.\n\nThe book made fun of the absurd lengths people go to answer the big questions in life and made the link between cosmic questions and everyday life. Adams is credited with predicting the internet and reinventing the science fiction genre. He injected wit and comedy into science fiction and inspired a generation of writers and film makers.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times, Terry Jones a former member of Monty Python and a personal friend said \"While the Pythons found humour in anger and being silly, he was the first to find humour in intellectual subjects.\"\n\nAdams also wrote Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul and The Meaning of Liff - an alternative dictionary of nonsense words.\n\nMore recently, Adams had been involved in writing computer games and had just finished working with Jay Roach, the director of Austin Powers, on a film of the Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. for Disney.\n\nIn the Hitch-Hiker books the Earth was a gigantic biological computer designed to calculate the meaning of life. When Adams finally revealed the meaning of life was the number 42 he said, \"I think I disappointed a lot of people with that. They must have been expecting this great, profound piece of genius, but I screwed them!\"\n\nHe was also a musician and close friend of Dave Gilmour from Pink Floyd. On his 42nd birthday, the number that revealed the meaning of life, he joined the band on stage and played two songs from Dark Side of the Moon."
