        "text": "LONDON, England -- Douglas Adams, author of the cult science-fiction comedy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, has died at the age of 49.\n\nBritish-born Adams died on Friday of a heart attack in Santa Barbara, California, his London spokeswoman Sophie Astin said. He was married with a daughter.\n\nThe guide, published in 1979, was a satirical adventure about a group of intergalactic travellers.\n\nIt opens with the Earth being destroyed to make way for an intergalactic highway.\n\nIt went on to sell more than 14 million copies worldwide and was turned into a BBC radio serial and later a TV series.\n\nThe book preceded a series of best-selling titles by the author, including The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe; Life, The Universe And Everything; and So Long, And Thanks For All The Fish.\n\nThe books blended satire, memorably named characters such as Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin the Paranoid Android and witty philosophy, at one point supplying the answer to \"the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything.\" The answer was 42.\n\n'Creative genius'\n\nAdams later recalled how he first thought of the book during a teenage trip around Europe.\n\n\"I was hitchhiking around Europe in 1971, when I was 18, with this copy of A Hitchhiker's Guide to Europe,\" he said.\n\n\"At one point I found myself lying in the middle of a field, a little bit drunk, when it occurred to me that somebody should write a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It didn't occur to me that it might actually be me years later.\"\n\nThe book came 24th in a poll of the top 100 books of the 20th century conducted by the Waterstone's bookstore chain and Channel 4 television.\n\nGeoffrey Perkins, the BBC's head of comedy, called Adams \"absolutely one of the most creative geniuses to ever work in radio comedy,\" he told the Press Association.\n\n\"He probably wrote one of the greatest radio comedy series ever, certainly the most imaginative,\" he added.\n\nAdams and his barrister wife moved from their home in north London to California in 1999, after he set up multimedia company The Digital Village.\n\nThe company, which lists Adams as its founder-director Chief Fantasist, created the Bafta-nominated 1998 CD-Rom Starship Titanic adventure game.\n\nHe signed a deal with Disney in 1998 to turn The Hitchhiker's Guide into a film, but the movie is still in development.\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nAdams on online encyclopedias\n\nNovember 21, 2000\n\nRELATED SITE:\n\nDouglas Adams\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive."
