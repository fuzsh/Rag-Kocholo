Lockhart\n\nReview by Sterling S\n\nFind it in our catalog\n\nI read We Were Liars last summer, and (like many other readers), I was completely shocked by the ending. I’d go so far as to say We Were Liars contains the best plot twist I have ever encountered in teen fiction, so that’s why I felt Family of Liars was a little lacking as a prequel. Read full review\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars by John Green\n\nReview by Sterling S\n\nFind it in our catalog\n\nThe Fault In Our Stars is one of those books that never fully leaves your mind.
