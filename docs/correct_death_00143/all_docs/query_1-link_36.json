        "text": "I love Douglas Adams. Although he has been gone from our world for 13 years I miss him as I would miss a good friend. The good times we had together, listening to him read his own books. He was a mad man and such a delicious one.\n\nI was looking for a short audiobook. I wanted something funny and witty, so of course I found “Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency.” It’s just over three and a half hours — precisely the right length and correct degree of lunacy.\n\nWhen I began listening, I googled Douglas Adams and realized Douglas Adams shares my birthday.\n\nWhat an honor! I can’t imagine anyone with whom I could be happier to share a birthday. I’m delighted Maybe there a bit of his madness in me, too.Perhaps I have a tiny piece of his magic. Even a sprinkling of pixie dust would be fine.\n\nThe Dirk Gently series — just two books — never enjoyed the monumental success of the Hitchhiker books — but I’ve love them best. And this version is Douglas reading his own book and he’s an exceptional reader. There are a bunch of versions of all of Adams’ books on Audible.com. The few actually narrated by the author are the best.\n\nFor my life, forever hence forth, when I celebrate my birthday, I will also be celebrating for Douglas Adams. Happy Birthday,Douglas. No one has replaced you and never ever will.\n\nDouglas Adams\n\nBorn: March 11, 1952, Cambridge, United Kingdom\n\nDied: May 11, 2001, Santa Barbara, California\n\nCategories: Book Review, Books, Entertainment"
