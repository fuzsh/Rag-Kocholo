'No fear, optimism and disappointment' - Inside story of Liverpool's 1995/96 Premier League title miss

Part 1: The story of 1995/96. Former Liverpool star Jason McAteer talks through the emotions of narrowly missing out on the Premier League title

Liverpool were favourites to clinch the title ahead of the 1995/96 season.

The Reds made an ambitious move in the market before the campaign got underway to bring in Nottingham Forest striker Stan Collymore for a then record £8.5million.

‌

Defending champions Blackburn Rovers, meanwhile, had failed to add any significant players and runners-up Manchester United had sold three key names without bringing in any major new signings too.

The Anfield club also possessed some of the finest young talent in football with the prolific Robbie Fowler up front plus the talented Steve McManaman and Jamie Redknapp in the engine room.

The youth was backed up by senior players in the form of John Barnes, Ian Rush, Rob Jones, Mark Wright and Phil Babb to name but a few.

Optimism among the faithful Kop around a first Premier League title heading to Anfield, therefore, was high.

And Roy Evans' side made a strong start in the 95/96 term, winning five of their first seven matches and positioning themselves in close third behind Man United and Newcastle who were second and first respectively as they headed into October.

Liverpool have 'broken' Manchester City and Rafa Benitez is proven right Liverpool have already beaten five previous Premier League points totals

‌

Collymore had started in a rich vein of form, as had Fowler, and October saw the arrival of Jason McAteer from newly-promoted Bolton Wanderers for £4.5m and the former defender said it was a "dream move for him" switching to Liverpool despite strong interest from Kenny Dalglish at Blackburn Rovers.

It was the realisation of a boyhood dream for McAteer, but he admitted what a tough decision it was heading into the season.

"Being a Liverpool fan the move for me was a dream come true," McAteer told the ECHO in an exclusive chat.

‌

"I was also in talks with Blackburn and they were the ones who triggered the move. It was ironic really because Kenny Dalglish was my hero and I got a phonecall from my agent saying he wanted to buy me for the Rovers.

"I had talks but halfway through the meeting my agent took a call from Liverpool and it was really difficult because I wanted to play for Kenny who'd just won the league but I wanted to sign for Liverpool as my club.

"Kenny was trying to strengthen while Roy Evans was putting together this really really good young team.

‌

"There were still strong senior players here when I signed but Roy was investing heavily in the youth and already had Jamie, Robbie and Steve McManaman while Rob Jones was there and Phil Babb was brought in the season before and he bought Stan in after he had a brilliant season.

"When I settled down and stopped being a fan, I noticed it was a very young team with a sprinkling of experience because Ian Rush, John Barnes, Mark Wright and Michael Thomas were all there so the spine of the team was quite experienced and everywhere else it was really good young players - probably the best in Britain at that time - and you could see what Roy was trying to do.

‌

"We were being tipped as favourites that season to win the league and when I got there, there was a lot of optimism around the place and I'd come into a team that knew they'd be challenging for the title."

By the end of the month, having secured two draws and a win, Liverpool hammered Manchester City 6-0, leaving Alan Ball's side rooted to the bottom of the table while positioning themselves four points behind Newcastle and three adrift of Man United in first and second. The Reds were, however, knocked out of the UEFA Cup in a shock second-round upset by Brondby on October 31.

November was then all but a disaster for Liverpool in 1995 after they were beaten by Newcastle in both the Premier League and League Cup fourth round while also losing to Everton and Middlesbrough as well as drawing against West Ham. December didn't start much better with a 1-1 draw at home to Southampton, leaving Evans' men in eighth place in the top flight after securing just two points from five games.

‌

However, heading towards Christmas that season, Liverpool started to show the form they had displayed at the beginning of the campaign.

They beat Bolton 1-0 before putting Man United to the sword 2-0 at Anfield and then followed that up with a 3-1 victory over a challenging Arsenal side.

Liverpool's Man United triumph meant Newcastle's lead at the top of the Premier League was very comfortable heading towards the new year and the Reds drew with Chelsea on December 30 before beating Nottingham Forest 4-2 on January 1, 1996, to elevate themselves back up into third - just three points behind United in second with a game in hand.

‌

January was another successful month and wins over Aston Villa and Leeds plus a draw with Sheffield Wednesday saw the Reds move into second-place ahead of Man United on goal difference and nine points behind Newcastle.

Belief in Liverpool's camp was growing that the Reds could catch Newcastle.

"Newcastle were the runaway leaders," McAteer said.

‌

"Man United with this team Ferguson had brought through from the academy were still finding their feet, Arsenal weren't really pushing for anything, Chelsea had a good team but couldn't get it together and the title was up for grabs.

"We didn't fear anyone."

Liverpool went on to win four of their next six games - held to draws by Wimbledon and Tottenham - before their next loss away at Nottingham Forest in late March.

‌

By this point Newcastle's lead, which stood at 12 points at one stage, had been eaten up by Man United. Both teams sat in second and first respectively on 64 and 67 points while Liverpool were in third on 59 - but with a game in hand over the league leaders.

The Reds then kicked April off with a 4-3 win over Newcastle in one of the most thrilling games of the era, giving their title hopes a shot in the arm.

‌

McAteer said: "We were drawing games when we should have been winning them, and that's what cost us.

"People look back on that season and might question the defence but apart from Arsenal we had the best defensive record in the league and we'd scored more goals than Newcastle.

"It was the odd game when a lapse of concentration would cost us. We beat Newcastle but in the next game we lost to Coventry which is a massive three points and just when you think you've clawed something huge back and got within touching distance we fell behind."

‌

Indeed, the 1-0 defeat away to struggling Coventry City three days after the Newcastle victory almost ended any chance of the Reds lifting the league trophy that season as they were now eight points behind Man United with five games to go.

"I think if we had got on top we'd have stayed there," McAteer said.

"But the fact we were always chasing and would give a stupid two points away and make the job even harder - in the end we just ran out of games.

‌

"It was disappointing that we didn't win it, but Newcastle would be devastated to lose that lead. We never felt like we threw it away, we felt like we were chasing and chasing but never quite got there.

"It was never a feeling that we should have won it."

Evans' side picked up two wins and two draws over the next four games before finishing the season with a 2-2 draw at Manchester City, a result which saw Liverpool finish in third place, their final day hosts relegated on goal difference and Ian Rush score his final goal for the club before leaving on a free transfer.

‌

McAteer said: "We put Manchester City down, we were devastated about that and we had the FA Cup final against United the week after.

"When a team is playing the last game of the season and has a big cup final the next week, you do protect yourself and go into that game not wanting to get injured.

"We went to City knowing we couldn't win the league but we didn't want to put them down - we had friends there - it wasn't a half-hearted performance but it was a win, lose or draw it didn't really matter to us."

‌

Liverpool's third-place finish in the Premier League was their highest league finish since finishing runners-up of the old Football League First Division in 1991 and they had an FA Cup final against Manchester United to look forward to but lost 1-0 in a relatively poor contest at Wembley after an 85th-minute winner.

"Having beaten Man United at home and drawing 2-2 with them away, we weren't intimidated by them and we felt like we were going into that as slight favourites," McAteer added.

‌

"The lads had experience of being in the final before too and both clubs wanted it so much, the game played out to a bit of a non-event and everyone cancelled each other out.

"Overall, it's more gutting when you look back thinking that you could have done it.

‌

"As players we sat down and analysed what it was that lost us the league. We were good enough to win it. Defensively we were okay, we were scoring. But it was drawing too many games - we were inexperienced and didn't really grasp that winning 1-0 was enough, we were so expansive.

"We went into the next season thinking we've got to do better and played the same attacking brand of football - we drew 3-3 with Middlesbrough in the first game of 96/97 but shutting up shop and taking it wasn't in our repertoire.

"We hadn't won a title and didn't know how to do it really and then before you know it you've left the club thinking what might have been.

‌

"I think winning the first title really is the hardest."

Fowler would end the 95/96 season as the second highest goalscorer in the country with 36 goals in all competitions, only behind Alan Shearer, while McManaman lead every player in terms of goal assists, having made 25 in the Premier League alone.
