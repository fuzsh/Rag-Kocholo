        "text": "Stephen Blackford\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nDec 14, 2021\n\n--\n\nPortsmouth FC Season 1995–1996. Discontent is rife. Defeat to Southampton in the Cup and last day escape from relegation at Huddersfield.\n\nWelcome to Part 14 of a running series entitled “A Meander Through Scrapbook Lane” and here we focus on the 1995/96 Endsleigh League Division One season and another poor season is catalogued against the bitter defeat in the South Coast Derby and a final day win at Huddersfield to narrowly avoid relegation.\n\nDisclaimer — All pictures contained within this blog will be almost certainly from the Portsmouth Evening News and Sports Mail as well as wholly contained within some loved, if dusty, scrapbooks of over 30 year vintage and placed here purely for enjoyment purposes and I hope that this disclaimer meets everyone’s needs. If not, thank you www.portsmouth.co.uk for entertaining this Pritt Stick and scissors wielding young child/spotty teen/tall and gangly late teenager and young adult who should’ve stopped ripping and cutting up newspapers long before he hung up his scissors!\n\nDisclaimer II — This is far from a fully comprehensive review of the season and purely the contents and selected pages from my earliest scrapbooks. I am also a Liverpool fan born of a Manchester United supporting Mother who was born and raised in Portsmouth.\n\nI was nicknamed by my Liverpool match going pal as “The Cutter” in reference to an Echo and the Bunnymen song and so hence, here are my cuttings.\n\nDisclaimer III — As a cursory glance at any of my blogs will confirm, I write a lot. Here, not so. Pictures speak a thousand words apparently and from the annals of my childhood scrapbooks I think they sound strikingly eloquent on their own and with only minimal intrusion or commentary from me.\n\nSo I hope these scraps from my books jog a memory of the match concerned or the era, the city in general or your life at that time.\n\nHuman memories are a precious commodity. I hope you enjoy.\n\nI sincerely hope you’ve enjoyed this ramble through a painful season for the Blues and should you so desire, the links below will lead you to every season published so far, going back to 1982/83 and the winning of the old Division 3 Championship.\n\nA meander through Scrapbook Lane: Part I\n\nPortsmouth FC Season 1982–83 and the winning of the Division 3 Championship\n\nmedium.com\n\nA meander through Scrapbook Lane: Part 2\n\nPortsmouth FC Season 1983–1984 and *that* FA Cup Tie in front of 36,000 at Fratton Park and the 90 seconds that changed…\n\nmedium.com\n\nA meander through Scrapbook Lane: Part 3\n\nPortsmouth FC Season 1984–1985 and Alan Ball’s Blues come tantalisingly close to a return to Division 1.\n\nmedium.com\n\nA meander through Scrapbook Lane: Part 4\n\nPortsmouth FC Season 1985–86.
