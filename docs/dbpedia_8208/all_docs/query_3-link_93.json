        "text": "Aston Villa finished in the top four last term. Can they repeat the feat in the 2024/25 campaign?\n\nAs the new season approaches, fans are keenly watching the EPL winner odds. With a strong finish last season and key reinforcements during the transfer window, Aston Villa's odds to win the Premier League have become a topic of interest.\n\nâš¡My quick betting tip\n\nAston Villa to win the Premier League without the big six - at 2/1 with bet365\n\nâš½ Aston Villa last season overview\n\nAs the new season approaches, football betting sites are buzzing with excitement, reflecting the anticipation around Aston Villa's potential.\n\nLast season was one of Aston Villaâ€™s best in the modern era. Tipped to potentially challenge for a top-four finish, Unai Emeryâ€™s side sealed their place among the Premier Leagueâ€™s leading before the final day.\n\nAs a result Villa are back in the Champions League for the first time since 1982/83, when they were the holders of that competition (which was then known as the European Cup).\n\nVilla started and ended last term poorly, losing 5-1 to Newcastle United in their opening encounter and going down 5-0 to Crystal Palace on the final day. That just shows how well they performed in the 36 games in between. In terms of final position, it was Villaâ€™s best season since 1995/96, as they secured a respectable 4th place in the league table.\n\nâš½ Aston Villa manager\n\nEmery has done an outstanding job at Villa Park. He inherited a team in November 2022 that was woefully out of form and only just above the relegation zone. It did not take long for the Spaniard to work his magic and Villa ended that campaign in seventh spot.\n\nEmery outdid himself last time out, guiding the Midlands club into the Champions League. The former Arsenal, Sevilla and Paris Saint-Germain has long been renowned for his record in continental competition, but last season he demonstrated that he can also work wonders over a 38-game league campaign.\n\nAn astute tactician, Emery showed in 2023/24 that the characterisation of him as a defence-minded manager is not actually the case: Villa played some excellent football in his first full season at the helm.\n\nâš½ Aston Villa transfers\n\nAston Villa felt compelled to cash in on Douglas Luiz this summer, with the Brazil international joining Juventus for Â£42.3m. That is a blow. Luiz was the man who made Villa tick and he will not be easy to replace. Elsewhere, Moussa Diaby has been sold to Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia.\n\nVilla have been busy themselves. The deal for Luiz sent Samuel Iling-Junior and Enzo Barrenechea in the other direction. Ian Maatsen has arrived from Chelsea after a key role in Borussia Dortmundâ€™s run to the Champions League final last time out.\n\nVilla have also brought in Ross Barkley on a free transfer, re-signed their former striker Cameron Archer, paid a combined Â£60m for ex-Everton midfielders Amadou Onana and Lewis Dobbin, and struck a deal for former Hull City man Jaden Philogene.\n\nâš½ Aston Villa objective for the season\n\nThe aim will be to qualify for the Champions League again, although no one at Villa Park will be under any illusions as to how difficult that will be. The likes of Chelsea, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur will all hope to be better this time around, while Villa will have to balance Premier League and Champions League commitments.\n\nGranted, Villa were in the Europa Conference League last term, so they are no strangers to the midweek-weekend grind. But the Champions League, needless to say, represents a significant step up. That is hugely exciting for Villa fans, but it would only be natural if their league form declined. Therefore, keeping an eye on the EPL fixtures will be crucial.\n\nâš½ Aston Villa strengths\n\nOnly Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City collected more points at their home grounds than Aston Villa in 2023/24. Emeryâ€™s team made Villa Park a fortress for much of the campaign, even stringing together a remarkably 15-game winning run in front of their own fans. Arsenal and City were among the visiting sides sent packing by Villa.\n\nMaintaining that sort of home form will be crucial if the Villans are to challenge for the top four once more. The fans are fully behind this group of players, this manager and these owners, with everyone involved with the club pulling in the same direction.\n\nVilla Park is one of the most historic grounds in English football and Villa must ensure it remains a difficult place for opponents to go throughout 2024/25.\n\nâš½ Aston Villa weaknesses\n\nAston Villa conceded 61 goals last season, a comparable figure to some of the teams around them like Chelsea, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur. But it was only the joint-seventh best record in the Premier League and was significantly more than the average fourth-place finisher. Villa must tighten up at the back this term.\n\nInjuries did them no favours last time out, so a little more luck in that regard would aid Villaâ€™s chances of being more robust defensively. But the team was vulnerable to quick breaks in 2023/24 and that is something Emery must seek to improve.\n\nðŸ’° What do I bet on?\n\nAston Villa to win the Premier League without the big six at 2/1 with bet365. Balancing domestic and continental assignments could lead to a slight drop-off, but Villa can still be the best of the rest.\n\nRead more about the 2024/25 football season\n\nPremier League winner odds\n\nPremier League top 4 finish odds\n\nChampionship promotion odds\n\nMore Premier League club overviews\n\nArsenal\n\nBrentford\n\nBournemouth\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion\n\nChelsea\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nEverton\n\nFulham\n\nIpswich Town\n\nLeicester City\n\nLiverpool\n\nManchester City\n\nManchester United\n\nNewcastle\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nSouthampton\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nWest Ham United\n\nWolverhampton\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.
