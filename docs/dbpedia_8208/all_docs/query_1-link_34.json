        "text": "Mohamed Salah, Fabinho and Sadio Mane were all on target as the Reds moved to the brink of their first league title since 1990.\n\nBut it was a spectacular free-kick from Trent Alexander-Arnold that set Jürgen Klopp’s side on their way, with the No.66 curling home a brilliant 25-yard effort midway through the first half.\n\nTo mark the anniversary of that stunning strike, here are 10 more of the best free-kick goals scored by Liverpool during the Premier League era…\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold (v Chelsea, September 2019)\n\nA player who has built up quite the collection of free-kick goals, among the most important Alexander-Arnold has scored came at Stamford Bridge early in that title-winning season of 2019-20.\n\nIt was a well-worked one, too, Alexander-Arnold sweeping home after Salah had backheeled the ball into his path.\n\nRoberto Firmino added a second before half-time as Liverpool recorded a vital victory en route to becoming champions.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho (v Arsenal, August 2016)\n\nAn opening-day masterpiece from Philippe Coutinho lit up Emirates Stadium as the 2016-17 campaign got under way.\n\nThe Reds looked set to go in at the break trailing to Theo Walcott’s strike, but on the stroke of half-time Coutinho bent a magnificent 30-yarder past Petr Cech to change the complexion of the game.\n\nLiverpool came out swinging after the break, with Coutinho scoring again and both Adam Lallana and Mane on target as Klopp’s side began the season with an eye-catching 4-3 victory – only their second ever at the Emirates.\n\nFabio Aurelio (v Manchester United, March 2009)\n\nLiverpool’s victory at Old Trafford in March 2009 fired them firmly back into the title race, and saw both Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres at their devastating best.\n\nBoth were on the scoresheet already, giving Rafael Benitez’s team a 2-1 lead, when Gerrard was upended by Nemanja Vidic, who was sent off.\n\nFrom the resulting free-kick, Fabio Aurelio left Edwin van der Sar rooted with a sublime strike into the top corner.\n\nSubstitute Andrea Dossena added a late fourth as the Reds recorded a memorable success at the home of their fierce rivals.\n\nSteven Gerrard (v Aston Villa, August 2007)\n\nGerrard could have his very own Kop 10 of spectacular goals, but perhaps his best and most memorable free-kick came at Villa Park on the opening day of the 2007-08 season.\n\nAfter Martin Laursen’s own goal had given the Reds the lead, Gareth Barry’s late penalty looked to have secured a point for the home side.\n\nBut deep into stoppage time, Gerrard stepped up to whip a quite wonderful effort into Stuart Taylor’s top left-hand corner and ensure Benitez’s men began the campaign with all three points.\n\nGet your 2024-25 LFC home kit at our online store here\n\nJohn Arne Riise (v Manchester United, November 2001)\n\nFew goals in Liverpool’s history have been struck with such ferocity as John Arne Riise’s first at Anfield, which set the Reds on their way to a convincing 3-1 win over reigning champions Manchester United in the 2001-02 season.\n\nRiise’s rocket, fired past Fabian Barthez via the underside of the crossbar, was followed by a brace from Michael Owen and ensured that the Norwegian’s name is still sung by the Kop to this day.\n\n‘John Arne Riise, ooh, aah. I wanna know, how you scored that goal…’\n\nGary McAllister (v Everton, April 2001)\n\nOne of the great Merseyside derby moments came on Easter Monday in 2001, as Liverpool edged a remarkable Goodison Park contest courtesy of a moment of ingenuity from the veteran Gary McAllister.\n\nThe game was locked at 2-2 when, in stoppage time, Liverpool were awarded a free-kick, some 44 yards from goal.\n\nAs Everton’s defence and goalkeeper Paul Gerrard anticipated a cross into the penalty area, McAllister spotted a gap at the near post, whipping his effort perfectly into the bottom corner.\n\nThe celebrations that followed, and manager Gerard Houllier’s face in particular, will live long in the memory.\n\nDanny Murphy (v Manchester United, December 2000)\n\nOld Trafford has witnessed several classic Liverpool free-kicks down the years, and few have been more significant than Danny Murphy’s effort just before Christmas in 2000.\n\nThe Reds hadn’t won away to United in 10 years, but when Gary Neville was penalised for handball just before half-time, Murphy kept his composure superbly to steer a perfectly placed strike into the corner.\n\nLiverpool went on to win 1-0 and would repeat the trick in two of the next three seasons, too, each time with Murphy netting the winning goal.\n\nPatrik Berger (v Manchester United, March 2000)\n\nWhat is it about Manchester United and free-kick goals for Liverpool?\n\nPatrik Berger was known for his penchant for the spectacular, and perhaps his best Reds goal came at Old Trafford in 2000 as he smashed in a brilliant left-footed effort from 30 yards.\n\nIt wasn’t enough to secure all three points, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scrambling an equaliser, but it was certainly one of the more memorable goals the Reds have scored against United in the Premier League era.\n\nRobbie Fowler (v Manchester United, December 1995)\n\nLiverpool scored four times against Manchester United in the 1995-96 season, and Robbie Fowler netted all of them.\n\nHe had already struck twice in a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford in October when Alex Ferguson’s side visited Anfield in December, and he set the Reds on their way to a deserved 2-0 victory with a super effort in front of the Kop.\n\nFowler’s 25-yard curler left United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel completely wrong-footed, and he would follow that up with a clinical finish in the second half to give Roy Evans and his team a big three points."
