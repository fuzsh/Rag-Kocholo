        "text": "Chelsea defender Thiago Silva says the club need to \"stop and put a strategy in place\" or risk another difficult campaign next season.\n\nDespite lavish transfer spending under new owner Todd Boehly, Chelsea are 11th in the Premier League and will end this season without a trophy after defeat by Real Madrid in the Champions League.\n\n\"The manager can only pick 11 from 30-something. That's tough,\" said Silva.\n\n\"There is always going to be someone upset because not everyone can play.\n\n\"We had to increase the size of the changing rooms because it didn't fit the size of the team,\" Silva revealed.\n\nAmerican investor Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital completed a Â£4.25bn takeover of Chelsea in May 2022.\n\nThey spent about Â£550m across the summer and winter transfer windows to amass a first-team squad of 30 players, but that has failed to translate into success on the pitch.\n\nChelsea have sacked managers Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter this season, while interim boss Frank Lampard has lost all four matches since taking over for a second spell this month.\n\nIt means they are unlikely to qualify for Europe for only the second time in 25 seasons.\n\n\"It's a difficult moment for the club, with a lot of indecision,\" added 38-year-old Silva.\n\n\"A positive point is that there are amazing players within the squad, but on the other hand there is always players that are going to be unhappy.\n\n\"We need to stop and put a strategy in place, otherwise next season we could make the same mistakes.\"\n\nChelsea have reportedly held talks with ex-Bayern Munich boss Julian Nagelsmann as part of their search for a new manager with former Spain boss Luis Enrique also in the frame.\n\n\"We keep pointing our fingers to the managers, but we need to look inside and see what we are doing wrong and try to change it,\" Thiago said.\n\n\"When you're pointing someone, you have three fingers pointing back to you.\n\n\"So firstly, we need to look to what we've been doing wrong and play more as a team - because we don't need a hero, we need heroes.\n\n\"At the end of the season if we do what we've got to do, we'll be able to at least finish it with dignity.\"\n\nFormer Chelsea striker Didier Drogba says he does not \"recognise the club\" compared with when he played at Stamford Bridge.\n\nDrogba won 12 major honours between 2004 and 2012 under previous owner Roman Abramovich, whose generous backing turned the Blues into serial trophy winners following his takeover in 2003.\n\nThe 56-year-old was forced to sell the club last year after he was sanctioned by the UK government over alleged links to Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"It is not the same club any more,\" Drogba, 45, told Canal+. \"I don't recognise my club. There is a new owner and a new vision.\n\n\"We try to compare with what was done under the Abramovich era, where there were many acquisitions of players, but the choices were very intelligent.\n\n\"Bringing in players like Petr Cech, Andriy Shevchenko, Hernan Crespo, Michael Essien, Didier Drogba, Florent Malouda, and I go on. It was to win titles and they are players who already have some experience. Here the strategy is different, they bet on young players.\n\n\"I think they certainly lack charismatic players and leaders. It needs players who take responsibility.\"\n\nLucy Oliva, BBC Radio London\n\nWith Chelsea's faint Champions League dreams dashed on Wednesday, it now feels like damage limitation could be the main objective for the rest of this chastening campaign.\n\nThere are seven games still to play in the Premier League before the club, players and fans can take stock, and it is difficult to see how Frank Lampard will be able to pick his squad up and prevent their already record-breakingly bad form spiralling even further.\n\nA free weekend offers respite from the recent misery, but by the next time Chelsea play - against Brentford at Stamford Bridge on 26 April - they could be level on points with Crystal Palace - the same Crystal Palace who up until three weeks ago were at serious risk of relegation.\n\nThe Blues might even be only nine points above the bottom three if Nottingham Forest could pull off a shock at Liverpool this weekend.\n\nSome may talk about being dragged into a relegation battle in jest, but with Arsenal, Manchester City and Newcastle all still to face - plus Bournemouth and Forest, who are both fighting for their top-flight status - the current doom and gloom suggests it is difficult to see where Chelsea will pick up their next point.\n\nCurrently on 39 points, they have got to find another 11 from somewhere if they are to match their lowest Premier League return of 50, set in the 1995-96 and 2015-16 seasons.\n\nThere's just 39 days to wait until they can call time on the 2022-23 season, but then the real fun begins.\n\nIt feels like they are entering the abyss this summer - and who knows who, or what, will come out the other side of this latest tumultuous chapter in the history of Chelsea Football Club."
