        "text": "Manchester City are seeking an unprecedented fifth successive Premier League title this season.\n\nPep Guardiola and co just made history by winning four on the bounce, but Michael Owen doesn't think they'll even be in the hunt, let alone retain their crown this term. In fact the former Liverpool man reckons the champions will finish fourth - quite the fall from grace.\n\nHe's cited the distractions around the 115 charges levied against them, although that hasn't been an issue for them as of yet. Owen though boldly suggested: \"If City are not gonna be really in the race after 10 games then their priority could go elsewhere - I think there could be a big surprise this season.\n\n\"Theyâ€™ve also got the investigation hanging over them and Pep Guardiola is not going to be there forever. This could be his last season.\"\n\nGuardiola's relentless standards have allowed the Manchester outfit to stay top of the pile. Since winning the title in 2018 they've not finished lower than second.\n\nThat hasn't always been the case for champion sides though. After scaling the mountain some have dropped off more than others. It is easy to tip the holders for another impressive year, but for a variety of reasons some teams fall off a cliff.\n\nIn light of Owen's comments, which if true would be quite the prediction, we take a look at Premier League champions who faced a drop off the year after they lifted the trophy.\n\nBlackburn Rovers - 1995/96\n\nThose at Ewood Park cherished their moment in the sun, but it didn't last long. Alan Shearer landed his only title win at Anfield on a dramatic final day. But Manchester United, the team who had finished second, soon wrestled back their crown as Blackburn slumped to a seventh place finish.\n\nTheir success was built on the fortunes of Jack Walker, their owner who had thrown huge sums at the playing group. They eventually finished seventh the following year - and were as low as 15th after eight games of the campaign. They had managed to retain the majority of their winning outfit, but after a failed title defence they all begun seeking pastures new.\n\nManchester United - 2013/14\n\nSir Alex Ferguson was out and David Moyes was in. An opening day victory at Swansea was as good as the feeling got as it quickly became apparent this United side had perhaps overachieved by winning the title, owing a lot to the goals of Robin van Persie.\n\nMoyes was hailed as the Chosen One, but he failed to last the season before he was given the sack. United were embarrassed at Old Trafford by Liverpool and City, who both secured 3-0 wins. Come early December they were ninth having won just five of their first 15 matches. In truth, the Red Devils have never truly found their feet since the Scot's exit and their demise that year was a sign of the struggles that were to come.\n\nChelsea - 2015/16\n\nWhilst some drop offs you can see coming, this one was a bolt of lightning no one forecasted. Jose Mourinho seemed to be at the peak of his powers and had breezed to another title triumph, but an opening day draw with Swansea, marred by a clash with the club's physio, set about a series of events that led to Mourinho's demise.\n\nAt the halfway stage of the season the Blues were in a genuine relegation scrap. Mourinho had claimed the club would have to sack their most successful ever manager before he said his work was \"betrayed\" after losing to Leicester - shortly before he was given the chop.\n\nGus Hiddink led them to the end of the season as they replaced Blackburn by posting, statistically, the worst ever season as defending champions by ending up in tenth.\n\nLeicester - 2016/17\n\nPlenty will argue their tag of Premier League champions - whilst remarkable and an incredible narrative - wasn't exactly a fair gauge of the club and its players. They also lost N'Golo Kante, arguably their best player, after winning the title so were certainly hampered.\n\nA loss to newly promoted Hull on the opening day was a sign of things to come as Claudio Ranieri went from hero to zero, receiving his marching orders in February after five successive losses left them in 17th. Craig Shakespeare helped lead a resurgence that eventually led them to mid-table after the threat of relegation appeared very real.\n\nChelsea - 2017/18\n\nAnother Blues blow up under an outspoken coach, this time Antonio Conte. The Italian had broken numerous records in his debut season en route to the title. However swiftly things turned sour as there was talk of Conte walking away before a ball was kicked ahead of his second season.\n\nA 3-2 home loss to Burnley, who had led 3-0, on the opening day set a sour tone. Chelsea secured some notable wins but there was an undertone of an angered Conte, who publicly challenged the club to match his ambition after missing out on transfer targets. A home hammering at the hands of Bournemouth was among the lowest points.\n\nFA Cup success at Wembley salvaged some silverware but eventually the Blues finished in fifth meaning they missed out on the Champions League for the first time in the Roman Abramovich era."
