        "text": "A smart strike from Joelinton in first half added time gave Newcastle a winning start to the season on Saturday - despite having to play with ten men for over an hour.\n\nWhat had been an indifferent encounter burst into life in the 28th minute when United gained a free kick in the centre circle - only for the focus to shift upfield to the Leazes penalty area that the hosts were defending.\n\nA clash between Fabian Schar and Saint Ben Brereton-Diaz that began when the visiting striker shoved the defender ended with the pair locking horns before the Saint theatrically fell to the floor clutching his face.\n\nReferee Craig Pawson issued the Swiss international with a red card that a VAR check upheld; Brereton-Diaz escaping with a booking and incessant barracking from outraged home fans whenever he gained possession thereafter.\n\nJacob Murphy gave way to Emil Krafth as Eddie Howe's side dropped into a 4-3-2 and a long afternoon of defending to try and grind out a point loomed.\n\nHowever that script altered somewhat at the end of the half, as a loose pass from Saints 'keeper Alex McCarthy was seized on by Alexander Isak on the right hand side of the box.\n\nHis ball infield fell to Joelinton near the penalty spot, who still had work to do but took a touch before tucking a low effort into the corner of the Gallowgate goal - taking what was our only real scoring chance.\n\nFoolhardy though Schar's actions were, they did have the the effect of galvanising colleagues and supporters alike, giving Newcastle a specific task to focus on that they had lacked at 11 versus 11.\n\nThat manifested itself in the tunnel at half time when Dan Burn attempted to shake an opponent warmly by the throat and the whole side defended the Gallowgate goal with grim relish after the break.\n\nA plethora of Saints corners were repelled and two opportunities in quick succession for Adam Armstrong to net against his old side were blocked - beginning with a fine intervention from Lewis Hall and then followed just seconds later by Nick Pope's timely tip-over.\n\nAs full time began to come into sight there was first appearance in our colours for Lloyd Kelly at left back and a return to the so-called sh*thousery that was a hallmark of performances earlier in Howe's reign.\n\nThat included Nick Pope going to ground for treatment on a mysterious injury and some intelligent work from a clearly pumped-up Bruno to engineer free kicks where no indiscretion was immediately apparent....\n\nRegardless of Brereton-Diaz's sneaky conduct, Schar has to bear the blame for being suckered into a response that will sideline him for three matches - and increase the pressure on his club to part with an outrageous amount of money for Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi.\n\nTeam: Pope, Hall (Kelly 70), Livramento, Schar, Burn, Longstaff, Guimaraes, Joelinton, J.Murphy (Krafth 30), Gordon (Barnes 70), Isak.\n\nSubs n/u: Almiron, Dubravka, Osula, Targett, Trippier, Willock.\n\nBooked: Hall, Burn\n\nSent off: Schar (straight red, 28)\n\nGoal: Joelinton 45\n\nSFC: McCarthy, Stephens, Bednarek (Amo-Ameyaw 81), Harwood-Bellis, Walker-Peters (Alcaraz 81), Aribo (Dibling 70), Downes, Smallbone, Sugawara (Edozie 46), Brereton (Archer 71), Armstrong.\n\nSubs n/u: Bree, Lumley, Taylor, Wood-Gordon.\n\nBooked: Brereton, Stephens, Harwood-Bellis, Edozie.\n\nCrowd: 52,196 including 3,204 Saints.\n\nEddie Howe said:\n\n\"It wasnt an enjoyable game to experience.\n\n\"The result is unbelievable for us, but how we got there was very, very difficult. The sending off changed the game completely.\n\n\"We knew what type of game it would be. Before the sending off we had our moments, but we werent in control of the game.\n\n\"I dont know if a sending off ever truly helps you, but it gets the crowd to inspire you  and that made a difference.\n\n\"Last season we scored a huge amount of goals but conceded too many. The guys with ten men produced a really good defensive performance.\n\n\"To a man we were blocking shots, we were covering space very well. On another day we could have played better with the ball.\n\n\"Emil (Krafth) came on in a difficult game, and I thought he was magnificent for us. Hes so reliable, has never let us down, and it was a brilliant performance from him.\n\n\"We have to grab that sentiment because the season we finished fourth, we had that running through us. We were written off, we were criticised, we were you name it, there was a lot of stuff thrown at us.\n\n\"Of course then when youre successful, a lot of plaudits come and thats dangerous sometimes. Im not saying you want criticism, but you want to feel like youre fighting against the odds.\n\n\"Ill certainly take that mindset from today because we were against the odds, we were fighting to try to get something from the game and the players did that magnificently.\n\nOn the red card:\n\n\"I think its really harsh on Fabi, but I think we all know that you cant give the referee the possibility to even give the red card, so thats something well learn from.\n\n\"The big question is do you want a red card for that. Does Fabis action alone warrant a red card? Im not sure."
