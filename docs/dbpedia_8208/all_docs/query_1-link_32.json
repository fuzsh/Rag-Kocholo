        "text": "Real Madrid's Lucas Vazquez says he would love to play in this summer's European Championship for Spain.\n\nThe 32-year-old has nine caps for the national team, with the last coming in 2018.\n\nAn impressive season for Real, however, has put him in contention for a recall and spot in Luis de la Fuente's squad.\n\nVazquez got two assists and a goal in Real's 4-4 with Villarreal on Sunday. Speaking after the match, he said: “I would love to go to the Euro. I would love to continue. Things are looking good.\"\n\nDe la Fuente is set to name Spain's final squad on May 27 before friendlies against Andorra and Northern Ireland in early June followed by the Euros.\n\nSpain are in a challenging group with Croatia, Italy and Albania.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti praised midfielder Arda Guler following Real Madrid's draw against Villarreal on Sunday, calling him \" a special talent\".\n\nThe 19-year-old scored twice in Sunday's 4-4 result at El Madrigal.\n\nAncelotti said on Guler: \"I'm not worried because it was a game with little balance. It was a game for that, to play well. And Arda did something special.\n\n\"The closer to goal (for his finish) the better. He is a special talent and he can do it near the goal.\"\n\nAlexander Sorloth, meanwhile, scored four goals to ensure the home side finished eighth in La Liga.\n\nMikel Arteta says he is proud of his Arsenal side after finishing as runners-up to Manchester City in the Premier League but has challenged them to show they can go to another level.\n\nArsenal took the title to the final day and beat Everton 2-1 at the Emirates but City's 3-1 victory over West Ham meant Pep Guardiola's side are champions for a fourth year in a row.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the match, Arteta said: \"I'm very proud. First of all congratulations to Manchester City, they are the champions, they've been incredible since December. We have tried with everything that we had. You can sense how much we wanted it, we really tried. It wasn't enough unfortunately.\n\n\"It feels good because success can not only be measured by comparing to somebody else, we need to understand what we are doing. We've beat every record this club ever had apart from winning it. This is the most competitive league ever in history and we have to be better. Now we need to find ways we have to improve.\n\n\"Now we have to be more determined, very courageous, very ambitious, and we need to go to a different level. We need to deliver.\"\n\nNuno Espirito Santo says he is happy to have achieved his \"main objective\" at Nottingham Forest, by leading the club to Premier League safety.\n\nForest ensured there was no late drama as they secured their fourth away win of the campaign, with a 2-1 success at Burnley.\n\nForest ultimately finished six points clear of 18th placed Luton, who suffered a 4-2 home defeat to Fulham.\n\nBut there were happy scenes at Turf Moor, where Forest celebrated securing a third season of top flight football.\n\n“We are very, very happy and proud of the way we finished the season. We all know how tough this season was for all of us at the football club,” said Nuno, who has seen VAR controversy and a four-point punishment for breaching PSR rules make his challenge more difficult.\n\n“It was important to finish on a high — winning and achieving the main objective from when we arrived. Our fans are going to see Premier League football next season.\n\n“Now we need to rest. Everyone needs to rest because it was very tough.”\n\nNuno said he would celebrate with two or three beers, before getting stuck into the planning for a new campaign.\n\n“This was the first time that we, as a coaching staff, took on a job in the middle of the season (rather than in the summer),” said Nuno, who replaced Steve Cooper last December.\n\n“We did not have a pre-season. We had to build our relationships, while we were still competing. It was difficult, because we did not have the opportunity to forge a bond.\n\n“That has taken time. Now we are seeing that the players are trusting us and trusting each other.”\n\nJurgen Klopp has told Liverpool fans to welcome his replacement in the same way he was welcomed to the club in 2015.\n\nThe German announced in January he would leave the club at the end of the season and earlier this week, Arne Slot confirmed he is set to leave Feyenoord to replace Klopp at Anfield.\n\nKlopp oversaw his final game in charge on Sunday, a 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers, and after the victory, the 56-year-old addressed the Anfield crowd.\n\n\"Obviously I saw a lot of people crying and I will tonight too,\" he said, \"because I will miss people but change is good. Everything will be fine because the basics are 100 per cent there.\n\n\"You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me. You go all in from the first day. You keep believing. You push the team. I'm one of you now. I love you to bits.\n\n\"Thank you. You are the best team in the world. Thank you!\"\n\nMore from Klopp below\n\nEddie Howe “hopes” that Bruno Guimaraes was not waving goodbye to Newcastle United fans when he lingered behind after his team-mates had departed the pitch at Brentford.\n\nGuimaraes scored one and assisted another two during Newcastle’s 4-2 victory over Brentford, a victory which secured a seventh-placed finish and which means that Howe’s side will be in the Europa Conference League next season, should Manchester City overcome Manchester United in Saturday’s FA Cup final.\n\nThe 26-year-old Brazilian has a £100million ($127m) release clause in his contract which can be activated until June 30 but, even once that expires, there are rumours of interest from Manchester City and Arsenal in the midfielder.\n\n“I don't think it’s a wave goodbye,\" Howe said of Guimaraes. \"I think Bruno probably does that many times but it can be interpreted in a way if the people watching decide that to be the case.\n\n“Certainly from my side, I hope it’s not. He is integral to what we’re doing, an inspirational player and we’re desperate to keep him.”\n\nMore from Howe below\n\nErik ten Hag says he has a \"luxury problem\" regarding team selection ahead of Manchester United’s FA Cup final against rivals Manchester City.\n\nRasmus Hojlund, who started on the bench against Brighton & Hove Albion, scored in United’s 2-0 victory at the Amex Stadium on Sunday.\n\nThe striker has taken his tally to 16 goals this season. Hojlund started on the bench, with Bruno Fernandes playing as a false nine.\n\nTen Hag, who has struggled with injuries throughout his squad this season, remained upbeat ahead of next Saturday’s clash at Wembley Stadium.\n\nHe said: \"I would say the manager, the coaching team, has luxury problems which is good.\n\n\"I think he (Hojlund) came in after we scored a goal already with the movement of Diogo in behind. Then he came in and showed very fresh, as Wednesday as well, scored two great goals. As you say I think he makes a very good impression.\n\n\"It’s a luxury problem. I think both formations can be a success because, as you know, we can play the set-up in the Etihad where we were a threat, I think, with movement in behind. But with Hojlund in this form it’s absolutely a consideration and a thought for us to consider. Let’s have the thought. I also want to say that you need not only 11 players in a final, a tough final, but a bench as well.\"\n\nMauricio Pochettino revealed he had dinner with Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly on Friday evening as he waits to find out the results of the club’s review of his performance.\n\nChelsea finished the Premier League season by beating Bournemouth 2-1, recording a fifth consecutive victory that secures a sixth-placed finish in the table and ensures that European football will return to Stamford Bridge in 2024-25.\n\nPochettino still does not know if he will be the man tasked with leading Chelsea into that campaign, but said his experience with Boehly was a positive one.\n\n“I don't know if this (meeting with the owners) is going to happen,” Pochettino said. “I have an idea about this. I can tell you that on Friday night Todd invited me to dinner.\n\n“It was a very nice dinner together but I don't know about the rumours of the review. Look, my staff tomorrow are going to fly home, (unless) tonight they decide another thing or tell us to stay. I'm going to stay a few more days in London. My door is open and my phone is going to be on.”\n\nAnge Postecoglou has described his first season as \"eventful\" after Tottenham Hotspur secured a place in the Europa League with a win on the final day.\n\nSpurs beat Sheffield United 3-0 to seal fifth place and end a rollercoaster week on a high note.\n\nPostecoglou criticised his club's \"fragile foundations\" after the defeat to Manchester City on Tuesday evening but found reasons to be positive as he reflected on his first campaign in charge.\n\n\"It’s been eventful, it’s had a bit of everything,\" he said. \"I’m obviously not delighted with the way we finished the season but in fairness to the players we’ve been in the top five the whole year, a year where there’s been a fair bit of upheaval after finishing eighth last year.\n\n\"Different football, different way of training. It’s not easy to maintain a level where you’re trying to do that but even in our tough periods we’ve been competitive for the most part. I’ve got maximum effort from everyone, which is all a manager can ask for.\"\n\nAsked whether he has enjoyed his first taste of the English top flight, he replied: \"Contrary to my general demeanour, I’ve loved every minute of it.\n\n\"It’s a great challenge in the Premier League, particularly taking over a big club that didn’t have a great season last year. You understand it’s not going to run smoothly.\n\n\"I’ve enjoyed the season but I’ve got some pretty loft ambitions for the club and until we reach that point I’m not going to be smiling too much.\n\n\"Any manager wants maximum from his players and I’ve had that. That’s the reason we’ve been in the position we have been. I’m looking forward to pushing on from here.\"\n\nErling Haaland has won the Premier League’s Golden Boot for the 2023-24 season.\n\nThe 23-year-old’s haul of 27 goals was five more than Cole Palmer’s 22 and six more than Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, who found the net 21 times in his second season on Tyneside.\n\nThe award seals a successful day for Haaland, whose side clinched their fourth consecutive Premier League title after their 3-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday.\n\nHaaland retains the award he won in his debut season in England after scoring a league record 36 goals as part of Manchester City's 2022-23 title-winning side.\n\nThe Norwegian striker becomes the first player since Harry Kane to finish as the top goalscorer in back-to-back seasons, and the fifth overall after Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry and Robin van Persie.\n\nShearer is the only player in Premier League history to claim the accolade three years in a row. He achieved the feat twice with Blackburn Rovers in 1994-95 and 1995-96, and again in 1996-97 in his debut season at Newcastle United.\n\nManchester City have been crowned Premier League champions for the eighth time after beating West Ham United on Sunday.\n\nA 3-1 win at Etihad Stadium secured the title — their sixth under manager Pep Guardiola — and sees them become the first team in the history of English football to win four successive top-flight league championships.\n\nPhil Foden’s brilliant strike after just 79 seconds set City on their way in the Manchester sunshine before the England international swept home a second 16 minutes later.\n\nMohammed Kudus' sensational overhead kick halved the deficit before the break to add some jeopardy before Rodri, who a year ago scored the goal in the Champions League final to complete the treble, settled any nerves with the third.\n\nThey now have the chance to complete a league and cup double when they take on Manchester United in the FA Cup final on May 25.\n\nManchester United midfielder Casemiro has hit back at what he believes has been “disrespectful” criticism he has faced over his performances this season.\n\nThe 32-year-old has endured a difficult campaign, with doubts arising about whether he can still compete at the top level for club and country.\n\nAfter Casemiro’s difficult showing during the 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on May 6, Jamie Carragher said that the Brazil international should find a new challenge away from United.\n\nHowever, Casemiro, who was left out of Dorival Junior’s provisional Brazil squad for the 2024 Copa America, has hit back at his such talk about his form this season, telling Sky Sports: “I think that criticism is a part of football. I’m always very calm, especially with criticism.\n\n“When it is constructive criticism it is always welcomed. Especially when you’ve been playing at a high level for 10 years and you drop your level a little, the criticism will come. But from the moment when you feel disrespected, I don’t think it is right. And that is when I lose respect for those people.\n\n“You look towards the end of last season, the team was playing well with plenty of positive comments. So, what happened? I was considered one of the best signings of the Premier League last season, and now I’m not worth anything anymore?\n\n“The criticism is disrespectful. When it (the criticism) lacks respect, then it is worrying and I don't have to respect that either.\n\n“There is always going to be criticism in football, especially playing for such a long time. People want to criticise. But from the moment when it lacks respect, that’s when you lose my respect.”\n\nAnthony Gordon is out of Newcastle United's final match of the season after picking up an Achilles injury during the team's 3-2 defeat to Manchester United last week.\n\nThe 23-year-old is hoping to be named in Gareth Southgate's England squad for the European Championship, was hurt in a tackle by Sofyan Amrabat which went unpunished by the match officials. Eddie Howe, the Newcastle head coach, later described the challenge as a \"stonewall\" penalty.\n\nAt his pre-match press conference on Friday, Howe had said he was unsure if Gordon would be fit to take his place in the Newcastle team at Brentford. “We will wait and see how he is today. I’m not 100% sure as I sit here now exactly how he is. Certainly that tackle left a mark on him,” he said.\n\nGordon is not expected to head to Australia for Newcastle's post-season matches with Tottenham Hotspur and A-League All Stars this week. Newcastle are flying straight from London after the Brentford match and Gordon has not travelled with the squad down.\n\nIn better news for Newcastle, Nick Pope, the England goalkeeper, returns to the starting line-up more than five months after dislocating his shoulder in the home game against Manchester United.\n\nJoelinton, the Brazil midfielder, starts a game for the first time since early January, while Callum Wilson returns from illness to take a place on the substitutes' bench.\n\nFull team: Pope, Schar, Joelinton, Isak, Barnes, Krafth, Hall, Murphy, Burn (c), Longstaff, Guimaraes. Substitutes: Dubravka, Trippier, Dummett, Wilson, Ritchie, Almiron, Anderson, White, Murphy.\n\nOn paper, teams who have avoided relegation and aren’t challenging for the title or the European spots have very little to play for in their final matches.\n\nHowever, there are millions of pounds available for finishing just one position in the table higher than you started the day in.\n\nOnly Liverpool (third), Aston Villa (fourth), West Ham United (ninth) and Sheffield United (20th) have a guaranteed finishing position, so 16 clubs have, at the very least, a financial motivation to get all three points.\n\nHere is what each finishing position earns, based off last season’s figures. Due to the broadcast deal being the same as the 2022-23 campaign, we can expect these numbers to be very accurate.\n\nSheffield United and Burnley have already been relegated and will play in the Championship next season — and one of Luton Town or Nottingham Forest will join them.\n\nNottingham Forest, in 17th, are three points clear of Luton and due to their vastly superior goal difference are highly unlikely to go down. Forest play Burnley away and Luton host 14th-placed Fulham.\n\nThere would need to be 12-goal swing for Luton to secure another season of Premier League football and given they have only won one game by more than one goal all season, they are almost certainly going to be returning to the Championship.\n\nEngland’s four representatives in next season’s revamped Champions League have already been determined, with Liverpool and Aston Villa joining Arsenal and Manchester City in Europe’s premier club competition.\n\nTottenham Hotspur looked to be providing the sternest challenge to Unai Emery’s side but five defeats in their last six games have left them staring at a place in the Europa League instead — especially after English sides botched their chances to secure an extra spot in next season’s Champions League.\n\nTo secure that, though, Spurs need to fend off the two teams chasing them from below — Newcastle United and Chelsea, two teams who Manchester United can still surpass in the standings.\n\nTwo of the four will earn a Europa League spot, one will play in the Conference League and one will miss out on European football entirely."
