If ever you wanted to run on to Anfield and rugby-tackle somebody as a last resort it was when Thomas slipped past the Liverpool defence in the very last minute to secure the League Championship for the Gunners. It was certainly a dream come true for Thomas who had joined the club as a schoolboy in 1982 and had gone on to forge a tremendous career. Thomas made some amends though when he scored a fantastic goal for Liverpool in the 2-0 win over Sunderland in the FA Cup final at the end of his first season. Souness liked his versatility as Thomas was able to play as a right-back, centre-half or a midfielder. Thomas snapped his Achilles tendon in January 1993 and was effectively out for a season and a half. His Liverpool career took off again in the 1995/96 season, now under the management of Roy Evans, when he displayed his box-to-box athleticism and played a holding role in midfield allowing Barnes the freedom to attack. Thomas rejoined Souness at Benfica in 1998."
