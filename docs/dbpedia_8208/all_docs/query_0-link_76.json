        "text": "Aston Villa vs. Chelsea : 7 February 2024.\n\nWe weren’t expecting much from this FA Cup replay at Villa Park. Why would we be? In our previous two games we had conceded eight goals. There was, in fact, a real worry that we would become unstuck on a mighty scale.\n\nI had worked an early shift, collected Paul and PD at 2.20pm, and then headed north. We stopped off at “The Vine” at West Bromwich at about 4.30pm. Our modus operandi was that if we were travelling over one hundred miles to watch a football game that we would probably lose, we had best find our fun elsewhere. The three curries, as always, went down a treat.\n\nAt around 6.45pm, I dropped the lads off as close to Villa Park that I could get and then double-backed on myself to park up. The plan was to walk all of the way around the stadium to take a selection of wide-angled photographs of the stands and to try to capture the essence of a midweek cup tie.\n\nVilla Park, eh?\n\nThis is a ground that became synonymous with FA Cup semi-finals before the FA took the unfortunate step to host all semis at the new Wembley Stadium. We have played a few semis at Villa Park over the years dating back to our first one, a win, against Everton in 1915. There was then a long gap of fifty years followed by three games in quick succession. We then lost to Liverpool in 1965 and Sheffield Wednesday in 1966 before defeating Leeds United in 1967.\n\nHowever, my first viewing of an FA Cup tie at Villa Park took place in early 1987. I travelled down to Birmingham with two mates from college in Stoke; Bob, Leeds United, and Steve, Derby County. I remember we posed for a photo outside the famous steps of the Trinity Road but the weather was too overcast and my camera was too cheap for the photo to be worth sharing. I had visited Villa Park for a tedious 0-0 draw in November 1986, but this cup tie was a great match. We had about 5,000 fans in a 21,997 crowd on the low terrace behind the goal and in the seats of the old Witton Lane Stand. We watched from the seats. We went 1-0 up in the first-half via John Bumstead but Villa equalised with twenty minutes to go via Neale Cooper. David Speedie then put us ahead on eighty-six minutes only for Steve Hunt to equalise again. We would win the replay at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThat game in 1987 was our last FA Cup tie against Villa on their home patch. However, we would play two semi-finals at Villa Park within six years during the Glenn Hoddle to Claudio Ranieri era.\n\nIn 1996, we assembled at Villa Park for the game against Manchester United. We were allocated the old Trinity Road Stand and three-quarters of the Holte End. Luckily, we had seats in the very front row of the upper tier of the Holte End, and I decided to take advantage of this position by creating a flag in honour of Ruud Gullit that I could drape over the balcony. Although the great man himself headed us into the lead in the first-half, United came back to win 2-1 with two goals in quick succession a quarter of an hour into the second-half via Andy Cole and David Beckham.\n\nIn 2002, our semi-final against Fulham was to be played at Highbury but our opponents took umbrage that the split of the 38,000 tickets at Arsenal’s stadium slightly favoured ourselves. They demanded that the game should be played at a stadium that allowed more equal allocations. Lo and behold, the two clubs from West London were forced to decamp to Birmingham on a Sunday evening with the game kicking-off at a ridiculous 7pm. I travelled up with a car load from Frome and we enjoyed a lengthy pre-match in the “Crown And Cushion” pub at Perry Barr. This pre-match is notable for the first-ever photo of Parky and myself together. We watched in the noisy upper tier of the North Stand as a John Terry goal just before half-time sent us to Wembley. The irony is that the attendance was only 36,147 and Fulham – of course – did not sell all of their tickets.\n\n“Thanks, then.”\n\nI took a few photographs on the walk through to the away end. Three police vans were parked on the roundabout near the Witton train station. Emiliano Buendia drove past in his car and some Villa fans close by went all weak at the knees. Amidst the throng of match-goers, a chap stood in the middle of Witton Lane with a “God Is Love” placard. I took outside shots of three of the stands but I did not fancy the trot down to the Holte End on this occasion. Time was moving on and I wanted to get inside to join up with the lads. I could sense an air of buoyancy amidst the home fans.\n\n“The Giant Is Awake” is the current tagline at Villa Park and I suppose they have a point. They are playing their best stuff in years.\n\nI was inside at about 7.30pm. As I spoke to a few fellow travellers in the concourse and in the seating area of the away section, nobody was confident.\n\nI took my seat alongside the lads. We were towards the back of the lower tier and it was a decent view. Chelsea were given 6,298 tickets for this game as opposed to the standard 3,000 for league matches. It seemed that a fair few were going spare if the announcements on social media were a clue. I just hoped that there weren’t large swathes of gaps in our section. I soon realised that the split was around 3,000 in the usual areas of the Witton Lane / Doug Ellis but with around 3,300 in the top tier of the North Stand to our right.\n\nThere were occasional empty seats but this was a magnificent effort from our supporters. While the dynamics have changed – for the worse, for the worse – at home games, thank God that the football calendar can occasionally throw up an occasion like this where the bedrock of the club can get a chance to follow the team en masse.\n\nThe minutes ticked by.\n\nThere were a few rock anthems as the 8pm kick-off approached. Surprisingly, “Hi Ho Silver Lining” was aired – as it was at Wolves – but then “Crazy Train” by Ozzy Osbourne took over as the teams were spotted in the off-centre tunnel.\n\nVilla then overdid it a bit. Not only were there plumes of smoke by the tunnel, but flames all along the pitch by the Doug Ellis Stand and – fackinell – fireworks in the sky above the stadium.\n\nNot to worry, the six thousand Chelsea fans had a response.\n\n“CAREFREE!”\n\nOn a serious note, all of this manufactured noise before kick-off might well look good on TV and it might excite children, but the problem is that it doesn’t allow for atmospheres to sizzle along nicely resulting in a crackling crescendo of noise – self-generated – at kick-off. Maybe those days are gone forever.\n\nSigh.\n\nOur team? No Thiago Silva. No Raheem Sterling.\n\nPetrovic\n\nGusto – Disasi – Badiashile – Chilwell\n\nGallagher – Caicedo – Enzo\n\nMadueke – Palmer – Jackson\n\nThere were a few mumbles and grumbles about the starting positions of Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson, but – noticeably – nobody was bemoaning the absence of Raheem Sterling.\n\nOK. Everyone stood. Not many gaps in the immediate area. A few late-comers. Many familiar faces. I still wasn’t confident, but here we go. I tried to juggle photographs with shouts and applause for the team.\n\n“CAM ON YOU BLUE BOYS.”\n\nThe Chelsea players formed a pre-match huddle, and while they waited for captain Ben Chilwell to join them, I spotted Cole Palmer looking over at the Chelsea support in the Doug Ellis Stand. He seemed to be in awe :\n\n“Bloody hell, they have turned up tonight alright. There’s thousands behind the goal too.”\n\nHowever, not all parts of Villa Park were full. I soon spotted hundreds of central seats in the executive areas opposite not being used. That was just odd.\n\nSoon into the game, with Villa attacking our end, a long cross found Alex Moreno unmarked at the far post, but rather than attempt an effort himself he decided to head the ball back across the six-yard box. A defensive head cleared.\n\nIt was a lively start to the game with Chelsea breaking with speed and intensity. Malo Gusto linked with Noni Madueke and worked the ball in to Palmer inside the Villa box at the Holte End. His shot was an easy take for Emiliano Martinez.\n\nThere was a header, shortly after, from Enzo but his compatriot Martinez easily fielded this effort too.\n\nOn eleven minutes, we won the ball out on our left. I stood on tip-toes to watch the move develop. Inside to Conor Gallagher who spread the ball into the path of Jackson. He ran and ran, and played a low ball towards Madueke. Although surrounded by Villa defenders, he wisely took a touch before knocking it back into the path of Gallagher. The shot rose steeply but we erupted when the net rippled.\n\nPandemonium.\n\nBodies and limbs everywhere. I had no hope of taking a shot of the players celebrating away in the corner.\n\nWe were winning. Fackinell.\n\nI was so aware that Conor’s lack of goals is often cited by many as a major-downside. So I was doubly happy that the goal came from him. Lovely.\n\nVilla came into the game but Djordje Petrovic thwarted their couple of attempts on goal including an angled volley from Ollie Watkins.\n\nWe continued to purr. On twenty-one minutes, Disasi found Madueke in tons of space. He turned and pushed the ball wide into the over-lapping Malo Gusto. His cross into the box – a relatively low trajectory – was met by the leap of Jackson. His angled effort crashed into the goal.\n\nWe were 2-0 up, oh my bloody goodness.\n\nI saw the players celebrating through the forest of arms but I managed to cajole a photo or two out of my camera.\n\nThe away support boomed as we continued to dominate. I was really shocked by the lack of noise coming from the home areas though.\n\nNothing. I heard nothing at all.\n\nWe, not surprisingly full of it. However, songs about Willian, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Cesc Fabregas? Really? Save those for the last five minutes of games when we are winning 4-0 plus please. The Willian one was a real shocker.\n\nI took great pleasure in seeing Enzo get more and more involved. Just two examples of his play; the first a cushioned control of the ball with his instep that screamed quality, the second, a first-time transfer of the play from left wing to right wing that told me that he was full of confidence.\n\nAlongside him, Moises Caicedo was enjoying his best game for us, adeptly swatting Villa breaks, tacking hard, turning and passing. And then Gallagher, a one-man search-and-destroy unit, full of energy and running. It was a very fluid and powerful midfield indeed.\n\nThe natives were restless and I was loving it.\n\nChilwell, finding himself on the right, moved inside and unleashed a shot that whizzed just past the near post.\n\nOn thirty-three minutes, Madueke hugged the far touchline as he accelerated away after picking up a loose ball level with our penalty box. He skipped past a challenge and continued his run. He passed to Palmer whose shot was at a relatively easy height for Martinez to save.\n\nOn a rare break, Watkins set up John McGinn, but Petrovic tipped it over.\n\nAt the half-time break, there were nothing but happy faces among the travelling army. It had been, no doubt, the best half of the season by far. Against a decent team, too, let’s not forget.\n\nOzzy serenaded us with “Crazy Train” once again as the teams took to the pitch for the second-half.\n\nThe home team began brightly and I can honestly say that after a quick attack in the first minute I heard the Holte End for the first discernible time.\n\n“Yippee-aye-eh, yippe-aye-oh, Holte Enders in the skoi.”\n\nWe applauded them.\n\nOn fifty-four minutes, a foul on Enzo. The free-kick was a long way out. I wanted Palmer to take it, but Enzo stood with Chilwell. Chilwell peeled away and Enzo took aim. As did I.\n\nSnap.\n\nI looked up to see the ball fly over the wall and dip majestically into the top corner with Martinez beaten.\n\nWhat a goal.\n\nThe away sections again boomed.\n\nZola-esque.\n\nI snapped his euphoric run down to our corner. I sensed the meaning of his actions immediately.\n\n“Look at me. I’m Enzo. I’m staying.”\n\nAh, bloody lovely stuff.\n\nI instantly forgave him for the yellow card that followed him taking his shirt off. Sometimes emotion gets in the way of accountability and rational thought.\n\nThe Chelsea supporters on the side stand piped up.\n\n“North Stand. Give Us A Song. North Stand North Stand Give Us A Song.”\n\nLovely stuff.\n\nWe were through. And we just could not resist a nod to our next opponents.\n\n“We all hate Leeds and Leeds and Leeds…”\n\nAmongst all this, a word for the much-maligned duo of Axel Disasi and Benoit Badiashile. Their best games for ages too. There was even a song, only a few days after many for rubbishing his recent performances.\n\n“Brought us back a centre back. Benoit Badiashile.”\n\nWe’re a fickle bunch aren’t we?\n\nOn sixty-five minutes, a song for a former player that I could fully get behind.\n\n“VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI! VIALLI!”\n\nSome late substitutions :\n\n72 : Christopher Nkunku for Jackson.\n\n75 : Raheem Sterling for Madueke.\n\nMoreno rose at the far post but his looping header landed on top of the net rather than inside it.\n\nMore substitutions.\n\n81 : Thiago Silva for Palmer.\n\n87 : Alfie Gilchrist for Badiashile.\n\nVilla had a late flourish and in injury-time, Moussa Diaby coolly slotted in at the Holte End.\n\nAston Villa 1 Chelsea 3.\n\nA roar at the final whistle. What a night. Roared on by over six thousand our team rose to the occasion and played some gorgeous attacking football. Why can’t all away games be like this?\n\nLeeds – you are next.\n\n2023/24 FA Cup Round Five\n\nBlackburn Rovers vs. Newcastle United\n\nBournemouth vs. Leicester City\n\nChelsea vs. Leeds United\n\nCoventry City vs. Maidstone United\n\nLiverpool vs. Southampton\n\nLuton Town vs. Manchester City\n\nNottingham Forest vs. Manchester United\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers vs. Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nWalking out of the stadium after the game brought back memories of other away triumphs over the years. Everyone was singing – “sign him up for eight more years, Chelsea boys are on the beers” – and I sensed a swagger in our step, that good old Chelsea swagger of old. There’s nothing like it. We walked back to the car and we followed the old rule of being able to walk wherever you want after an away win.\n\nUp to the roundabout, out into the road, the cars can stop for us.\n\nThe swagger was back.\n\n1996\n\n2002\n\n2024\n\n1996 – Part 2.\n\nIt came to light after the game at Villa Park that a sports photographer – working for “Action Images” – had taken a photo of my “Ruud Boys” flag from behind the goal.\n\nI spotted that a cropped version of it soon appeared in a copy of “Total Football” later that year.\n\nI didn’t ask for royalties.\n\n1996 – Part 3.\n\nThe former Wimbledon striker Dean Holdsworth once had an affair with glamour model Linsey Dawn McKenzie. At a game at Selhurst Park in the 1996-1997 season – I wasn’t there – the Chelsea fans were full of rude comments about this romantic liaison. In the “Daily Sport” newspaper – that beacon of journalistic integrity – the following day, there was a photo of Linsey Dawn McKenzie (baring all) with a headline to the effect of “How dare Chelsea fans be rude to both Dean and me?”\n\nThe editor chose to illustrate her tirade at the Chelsea fans with a picture of some Chelsea fans, set just behind a large photograph of Linsey Dawn and her quite substantial charms. The photo that the editor chose was from the Villa Park semi-final. It was the photo of my Ruud Boys flag. Or rather, a close-up photo of Glenn and me (looking, strangely, straight at the camera). The story goes that Glenn was sitting with his workmates during a tea break when one of them opened up the middle pages of his “Daily Sport” to exclaim –\n\n“Hey, Glenn – there’s a picture of you and Chris Axon next to Linsey Dawn MacKenzie here.”\n\nNext up, a game at Selhurst Park once again; Crystal Palace away on Monday evening.\n\nSee you there.\n\nChelsea vs. Blackburn Rovers : 1 November 2023.\n\nTreacherous waters ahead…\n\nBut first, we hoped, a little respite in the form of a home tie in the season’s Carabao Cup against Blackburn Rovers. Here was a game that we should win, surely?\n\nThis was another early start for me; a 4.30am alarm ahead of a day’s toil that would allow me to pick up my three usual passengers at 2pm. We were all well aware that Storm Ciaran was soon to hit the south of England and so I hoped that the drive up to London would be ahead of the expected rainstorms and gales. I would, we presumed, have all of that to contend with on the return drive home after the game. PD kept saying that the rain was due in London at 9pm.\n\nOn the drive towards the capital, the skies to the east and the north were fine, devoid of much cloud, and all very pleasant. However, behind me, in my mirrors, dense grey clouds haunted us most of the way but thankfully did not hit us.\n\nAlready through to the quarter finals were Port Vale and Middlesbrough. Could there possibly be a case of me tempting fate by writing about Port Vale in my previous match report? Should we get through later in the evening, an away game at Vale Park would undoubtedly be my favourite draw. The last time we played them was in 1929, almost a century ago. Alternatively, Ipswich Town would be decent; Portman Road is a ground that I am yet to visit. Alternatively, an away game in Newcastle or in Middlesbrough or in Liverpool or in Manchester would severely test me. Ouch.\n\nAt just after 5pm, I trotted into “The Rylston” to join up with PD and Parky, who I had dropped off forty minutes earlier. They were with Salisbury Steve’s mate Sam. I ordered some food and we chatted a little about the club at the moment. I could not lie; I told the boys that I honestly wondered if we would – could? – pick up a single point from the next treacherous six league games. I stayed in “The Rylston” for an hour and then an hour was spent in “Simmons” where there was a little pre-match meet-up between some friends from the US. I enjoyed a natter with Nick from California, Tim from Texas and Kim from California. I left the bar just after 7pm and was amazed, but pleased, that the rain had not yet hit.\n\nTickets for this game were back at the £26 level. Well done Chelsea.\n\nBlackburn Rovers, eh? It has been a while.\n\nIn fact, the last time that we had met them was the weekend before a certain game in Munich in 2012, a narrow 2-1 win. In that game, we wore the 2012/13 kit and I hoped that it would not be worn in Munich. I did not like the precedent of the 2008/9 shirt being worn in Moscow. On that day, we thought that we had seen the last of Didier Drogba at Chelsea. After the game, the FA Cup was paraded and Roy Bentley made the Matthew Harding laugh with his antics. It was a lovely day, almost dreamlike from this point in time in a little less optimistic 2023.\n\nBlackburn Rovers were relegated that season and have been battling to get back to the top flight ever since. They suffered relegation to League One – I still like to call it Division Three – in 2016/17 but were promoted the very next season.\n\nI used to like going up to Ewood Park. On a few occasions I travelled up with my Rovers mate Mark, including my first visit in 1994/95, a 1-2 loss. There was a game in 1995/96 when I watched with my mate Alan in the home seats when we lost 0-3 and we were immediately sussed when we didn’t spring to our feet when Rovers’ first goal went in. In more hostile environments, we would not have got off quite so lightly.\n\nThere was the Gianfranco Zola debut in 1996/97 when Chelsea completely filled the lower section of the away end, but also had some fans in the top tier too, a healthy 4,000 in total. A fine game ended 1-1 on that occasion.\n\nThere was a game that I watched with Mark in a hospitality suite in 1997/98 as guests of a supplier for the toiletries company that we worked for. Until the opener this season, it is the only Chelsea game where I have “gone corporate” and it was an odd experience. The two of us had watched a Rovers vs. Villa game from the same hospitality suite the previous season too.\n\nI have been up there eleven times in total, but all at the redeveloped Ewood Park, none at the original version. I missed the two most famous away games up there in recent years; the 4-3 win in 1998/99 and the 1-0 win in 2004/5, both mid-week games and difficult for me to reach.\n\nThe last time that I saw a game at Ewood with Mark was in 2003/04. By then Chelsea were the un-loved money men where once Blackburn Rovers held that mantle. One wonders if the media would have been so against Jack Walker and Roman Abramovich had their monies gone to more favoured teams on Fleet Street. I think we know the answer to that question.\n\nArguably our most famous game ever with them was the FA Cup Semi-Final at Old Trafford in 2007, a nice 2-1 win.\n\nOf course there have been plenty of games at Stamford Bridge too. The first one for me was the opening game of 1988/89 when our terraces were closed due to the near riot against Middlesbrough. On that day, just 8,722 saw us lose 1-2. Depressing times.\n\nI also remember the last game of 1995/96, a 2-3 loss, but acknowledged by everyone at Chelsea as the game in which the fans played a major role in determining the next Chelsea manager. Glenn Hoddle was to take over as England manager from Terry Venables and according to the English press, Ken Bates’ mind was full of George Graham as the replacement. The Chelsea choir had other ideas.\n\n“You can stick George Graham up your arse.”\n\nWe serenaded Ruud Gullit that Sunday afternoon. He was soon named as our manager. Job done.\n\nI was inside Stamford Bridge at around 7.15pm.\n\nStill no rain.\n\nRovers only had 3,000 having turned down the chance to have more. This surprised me somewhat. On the Shed balcony were two away flags. One simply said “Darwen BRFC” and I quickly messaged Mark. It is his home town. It was Mark who first spoke to me about Adidas designer Gary Aspden – himself a native of Darwen – about his collaborations with the sportswear giant and the Spezial range especially. It was his story which eventually lead me to tracking down Carlos Ruiz at his incredible shop in Buenos Aires in 2020.\n\nJust before kick-off, a brief flurry of texts.\n\nChris : “Good luck.”\n\nMark : “Not expecting much.”\n\nChris : “That’s OK. Neither am I.”\n\nGood God, that Rovers away kit was shite.\n\nUs?\n\nNice to see Benoit Badiashile back in the team. Reece James was starting again. Enzo back. Jackson too. And “Les”. No Mudryk.\n\nSanchez\n\nJames – Disasi – Badiashile – Cucarella\n\nUgochukwu – Enzo – Gallagher\n\nPalmer – Jackson – Sterling\n\nThe Rovers team included solidly British and Irish names such as Brittain, Hill, Carter, Pickering Wharton, Travis, Moran, Garrett and Leonard, whoever they were.\n\nI used to be able to name the Blackburn Rovers team, nay squad. Sigh.\n\nAt least I recognised their exotic-sounding manager Jan Dahl Tomasson, who once briefly played for Newcastle United among others.\n\nAs the game kicked off, I presumed that the folk from Blackburn, Darwen, Accrington, Rawtenshall, Oswaldtwistle, Clayton-le-Moors and Ramsbottom would be singing songs throughout the evening about Burnley Football Club.\n\nIt’s their thing.\n\nThe game started.\n\nStill no rain.\n\nWe were treated to a very rare occurrence at the kick-off as Enzo pumped the ball up towards Nicolas Jackson who got a shot in from an angle within ten seconds of the whistle.\n\nIt was a decent enough start, though it hardly got our pulses racing. Unsurprisingly, the away team were in no mood to attack and aimed to soak up pressure. Raheem Sterling, away in the far corner, cut inside and there was a strong penalty appeal as he tangled with a defender. Enzo then released James down the right but his shot was low and straight at the Rovers’ ‘keeper.\n\nOur play deteriorated a little and there were some moans around us. Rovers tried to get in the game but their attacks were rare. The noise, even from the away support, was not great. The three of us – PD, Alan and I – sat with our arms crossed. We must have looked as grumpy as hell.\n\nThere was an easy save from Robert Sanchez down below us as Rovers threatened a little.\n\nAt last, something to cheer us up; we witnessed a sublime spin and turn from Cole Palmer on the half-way line. In fact, it was Palmer who produced most of the pleasing play in the opening period. His touch, skill and awareness was a constant treat. Enzo set up James again, and our right back advanced to find space but his low shot was drilled low and eventually wide of the far post. A fine shimmy from Enzo allowed him to create space but his weak shot was kept out by the Blackburn ‘keeper.\n\nOn the half-hour, a short corner was worked well – for once – and Conor Gallagher lofted a cross into the six-yard box. The ‘keeper flapped at it and the ball fell towards a Chelsea player.\n\nI snapped with my SLR.\n\nIn it flew.\n\nWho was the scorer? Ah, the returnee.\n\nBadia – Badia – Bing.\n\nWe were 1-0 up.\n\nAlan : “THTCAUN.”\n\nChris : “COMLD.”\n\nThe Matthew Harding reprised one of its current songs.\n\n“Todd Boehly went to France…”\n\nI found it reassuring when I heard Alan solemnly comment that he refuses to sing that song. I refuse to do so too. I would feel uncomfortable singing that man’s name, giving him some sort of recognition.\n\nI have already heard enough from Todd Boehly to regard him as a fool.\n\nThe away team mustered up a late effort on goal in a rather dull first-half, but Andrew Moran’s effort faded past Sanchez’ far post. Our ‘keeper had completed a couple of Word Search puzzles in that first-half.\n\nAt 9pm, as PD predicted, rain.\n\nThere was a slight scare at the very start of the second period when an early Chelsea attack broke down and Rovers attacked down the right. Harry Leonard just about kept ahead of the chasing pack but his shot was hit meekly wide, with the watching three-thousand away supporters no doubt trying to suck the ball in.\n\nWe improved in the second-half.\n\nI loved an early through-ball that Enzo pushed forward early and into space. Two Chelsea players attacked the ball but the chance evaporated. But I loved this variation to the tap tap tap of balls being pushed around for the sake of it.\n\nSterling started to dazzle and he set up Enzo, who again left his shooting boots at home, a tame effort straight at the ‘keeper. It was then Palmer’s turn to shake off a defender with some fancy dancing, and he created an angled shot that flew over via the ‘keeper’s fingertips.\n\nOn the hour, the two players then combined, Palmer stealing the ball from a Rovers defender and feeding it inside to Sterling, who curled a fine shot into the goal, clipping it around the closest defender. It’s becoming his trademark goal. I snapped that one too\n\nGet in.\n\n[thinking : “Vale away next please”]\n\nWe had heard that West Ham were beating Arsenal, Newcastle were winning at Old Trafford. My mind drifted a little as I played with various scenarios. We had all admitted pre-match that getting to a League Cup Final, or even a semi-final, with this current team and squad in its current state of health and mind would indeed be something to celebrate.\n\nWhat’s that saying about cutting cloth accordingly?\n\nOnce proud Chelsea, serial-winners, getting excited about a League Cup Final?\n\nYes. Absolutely.\n\nIt’s amazing how a – relatively – poor spell re-jigs expectations and aspirations. I think most of my close mates would kill for a stint in the Europa Conference next season.\n\nA couple of substitutions.\n\nMalo Gusto for James.\n\nLevi Colwill for Badiashile.\n\nWe could relax a little now. Sterling set up Jackson who lazily blasted over. He was not having a great game. There was more trickery from Palmer and a low shot from outside the box. The ball took a deflection en route and hit the base of the post. A low shot from Gallagher went just wide. We were treated to The Sterling Show, with one mazy dribble into the heart of the Rovers’ penalty box drawing gasps from us all.\n\nTwo more substitutions.\n\nMoises Caicedo for Jackson.\n\nNoni Madueke for Palmer.\n\nThe away team broke through our ranks but the strong fist of Sanchez thwarted the low shot from the substitute Sigurdsson.\n\nIt stayed 2-0.\n\nA much better second-half, with Sterling excellent.\n\nOn the walk back to the car, the rain continued, but the drive back to Wiltshire and Somerset was not as bad, truthfully, as on Saturday. However, the road near my house was even more flooded than on Saturday so I avoided it and quickly adjusted the last half-a-mile. I reached home at 12.45am.\n\nOh, another home draw, awaits us in the Quarter-Finals; Newcastle United.\n\nVale Park will have to wait until the Semi-Final.\n\nNext up…groan…Tottenham away on Monday evening.\n\nSee you there.\n\n1988/89\n\n1995/96\n\n1996/97\n\n1997/98\n\n2003/04\n\n2011/12\n\n2023/24\n\nTottenham Hotspur vs. Chelsea : 25 February 2023.\n\nIn 2023, there aren’t many bigger away games for us Chelsea supporters than Tottenham Hotspur. In my book, it’s a toss-up between a trip to their stadium and to Old Trafford. There’s not much in it.\n\nIn 1983, the biggest away game in our fixture list was undoubtedly Leeds United.\n\nI continue my look at the current season of 2022/23 with a backwards look at one from forty-years ago, 1982/83, with some memories of our trip to Elland Road on Saturday 19 February 1983. The previous Chelsea four matches, detailed here recently, were horrific; four defeats.\n\nOutside of Chelsea, I was in the process of applying for degree courses at various polytechnics, at Sheffield, at Kingston, at Middlesex and at North London. I had already attended an interview at Sheffield on a blisteringly cold day after my father took a day off work to drive me up to South Yorkshire. It was my first-ever interview for anything, anywhere, and it went reasonably well. In the week leading up to the game at Leeds United, Sheffield Poly offered me a place on their Geography course for the autumn of 1983 if I could achieve a C and a D grade in two of my three “A Levels” in June. On the day before the Leeds United game, I received a similar offer from Middlesex Poly. However, my spirits were not high and these grades were looking beyond me. Both Chelsea Football Club and little old me were experiencing a tough winter. Additionally, the “mock” A-Levels were approaching fast, another reason to become depressed about my immediate future.\n\nGoing in to the game at Elland Road, Chelsea were lodged in fifteenth position, well away from Wolves, QPR and Fulham who appeared to be romping their way to the three automatic places. Fulham, in third place were a huge twelve points ahead of the team in fourth position, Grimsby Town. Chelsea, my beloved Chelsea, however were just three points ahead of a relegation place, on thirty-one points, ahead of Cambridge United on twenty-eight.\n\nBetween me and my “A Levels” and Chelsea in the Second Division, it was a bloody toss-up to see who would fare the better.\n\nMy diary entry on the Friday mentions “hope no trouble at the Leeds v Chelsea match”. I spent the day at home in Somerset, no doubt eagerly awaiting updates from Elland Road on “Radio Two” on the BBC. My radio was always tuned to 909 kHz on the Medium Wave on Saturday afternoons.\n\nThe teams lined up as below :\n\nLeeds United.\n\nJohn Lukic.\n\nNeil Aspin.\n\nEddie Gray.\n\nJohn Sheridan.\n\nPaul Hart.\n\nMartin Dickinson.\n\nGwynn Thomas (Kevin Hird).\n\nTerry Connor.\n\nAiden Butterworth.\n\nFrank Gray.\n\nArthur Graham.\n\nChelsea.\n\nSteve Francis.\n\nColin Lee.\n\nJoey Jones.\n\nPhil Driver (Gary Chivers).\n\nChris Hutchings.\n\nColin Pates.\n\nMike Fillery.\n\nClive Walker.\n\nDavid Speedie.\n\nAlan Mayes.\n\nPeter Rhoades-Brown.\n\nI can remember all of those Leeds United players from forty years ago with the exception of Martin Dickenson. A remnant from the 1970 FA Cup Final, Eddie Gray, was the Leeds player-manager who started down the left flank behind his younger brother Frank. I had first seen Paul Hart playing for Blackpool against us at Stamford Bridge in 1975, and I remember reaching out by the player’s tunnel before the game to obtain his autograph.\n\nJust writing these words takes me right back to my childhood. After my first game in the West Stand benches, we always watched in the East Lower in the ensuing games from 1974 to 1980 and I specifically asked my parents to try to get match tickets as near to the tunnel as possible. I used to boil over with excitement when I called over to various Chelsea players, and a few opponents, to get them to sign my little autograph book. To be so close, touching distance, so close that I could smell their Hai Karate, was utterly amazing for me as a youngster.\n\nLeeds had three internationals in that team – the two Grays plus Arthur Graham, all for Scotland – while our only international player was Joey Jones of Wales. With former striker Colin Lee deployed at right-back, our forward three of Walker, Speedie and Mayes is pretty diminutive, especially for the ‘eighties.\n\nThe goals rattled in at Elland Road that afternoon. It was 1-1 at half-time with us going ahead via a Mike Fillery penalty before Aiden Butterworth equalised. In the second-half, goals from Clive Walker and a Frank Gray penalty were traded before Arthur Graham gave the home team a 3-2 lead. In the closing moments, an Alan Mayes shot was deflected in by the player-manager Eddie Gray.\n\nLeeds United 3 Chelsea 3.\n\nFackinell.\n\nMy diary on the evening of the game guessed at a gate of 21,000. I wasn’t far off. In fact, the attendance was a still healthy 19,365, just narrowly behind the division’s highest gate of 20,689 that saw Newcastle United play Oldham Athletic. Despite a promotion place, our neighbours Queens Park Rangers drew just 10,271 for their home game with Barnsley that day.\n\nThere is no doubt that around 6,000 Chelsea fans made the trip to West Yorkshire, all positioned along the side of the ground in the Lowfields.\n\nOnce the third goal went in, I no doubt wished that I was among the away support. However, apart from five very local away games in Bristol – Rovers four times, City once – from 1976 to 1981, my visits to other away venues with my beloved Chelsea were still over a year away.\n\nThese days, thankfully, they are a very regular occurrence.\n\nIt was a stunning Sunday morning for my drive to London for the away game at Tottenham. There were no clouds to be seen, just a pristine blue sky. There were just three of us this week, Parky, PD and little old me. None of us were relishing the game.\n\n“Damage limitation, innit?”\n\nIt certainly seemed like it.\n\nOn all of my three previous visits to the new spanking Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, I had witnessed three Chelsea wins with no goals conceded. This time, I surmised, might be a little different.\n\nOn the Saturday, we received some sad news. We had known that Sam George – aka “Lovejoy” – had been ill for a while, and we were to learn that he had indeed passed away the previous weekend. I first got to know Lovejoy, named after the Ian McShane TV character, back in the late 1990’s and he became a part of my extended Chelsea family for quite a few years. He was such a character, and played a large role in the first few of these match reports in the 2008/9 season. I can well remember Lovejoy sorting out a ticket alongside him in the East Lower for Farmer John from Ohio, the Stoke City game in 2009, the last-minute Lampard screamer. However, weary with red wine, Lovejoy soon managed to fall asleep, thus missing the entire game.\n\nThe perma-tan, the hair, the dazzling white teeth, the chewing gum, the leather trousers, the ladies on tow in various European cities.\n\nWhat a character.\n\nRIP Lovejoy.\n\nThere was another beautiful breakfast at the “Half-Moon Café” in Hammersmith – more Old Bill this week, but this time they were off to the League Cup Final – before I parked up at Barons Court to catch the tube to Liverpool Street. From there, we caught the midday overland train up to White Hart Lane. We were all subdued. I was trying my best to rationalise where we were in terms of team development but it was such a difficult position in which we found ourselves. The remnants of Frank Lampard’s team had been joined by a mixture of signings by Tuchel in the summer, and were now augmented by our “Supermarket Sweep” of players from January. It almost felt that the past few weeks had been an extra “pre-season” and now the league campaign was to begin again.\n\nDuring the week, I had flitted around the internet to check out a potted history of our man Graham. Was he really as big a nonentity as it seemed? I was aware of his managerial history, or lack of it, but what about before then? Well, I discovered one thing.\n\nHe was playing for Stoke City when they won 1-0 at Stamford Bridge in the League Cup in the autumn of 1995. I was there, I remember it well. A lone Paul Peschisolido goal gave the visitors the win, the goal being scored in front of their “Delilah” singing hordes in the temporary Shed end.\n\nDue to my Stoke past – I lived there for three years – I was well aware of a Potter playing for the Potters at the time, but the penny never dropped until the past week.\n\nYep, Graham bloody Potter. It was him.\n\nFackinell.\n\nThe train pulled into the swish new White Hart lane station and, unlike PD and Parky, I went south and not north. I had not yet walked down to the southern part of the redeveloped area so, camera in hand, I walked down the High Road to soak it all in and to take some photos. Over the course of time, I always like to walk 360 degrees around every away stadium. I stood opposite the “Corner Pin” pub. This still stands on the corner of the High Road and Park Lane, and of course the area is all-changed now. Before, at the old stadium, coins used to be thrown at us as aggressive home fans tried to get close. I don’t miss all that.\n\nUnlike at the northern end, where there is a tightness by the away steps, they have really opened up the area outside their huge home end. This towering stand sits on the site of the old White Hart Lane pitch. I walked on, past a couple on their ‘seventies, perched on a low wall, bedecked in their navy blue and white Tottenham bar scarves, eating sandwiches.\n\nI turned left and headed towards the away turnstiles. I noted a line of newly planted trees at the base of all of the steel and glass. There were now grey skies overhead. The wind chilled me. It was time to go in.\n\nAgain, for the third visit in four, I was down low along the side. There was a subdued atmosphere throughout the concourse and in the Chelsea section. We were a crowd full of long faces. It seemed to take forever to fill. With a quarter of an hour to go, the whole stadium wasn’t even half-full.\n\nI miss the old days. In the ‘eighties, a London Derby would be full with half-an-hour to kick-off, with terrace chants bubbling away for ages.\n\nOur team?\n\nKepa\n\nJames – Silva – Koulibaly – Chilwell\n\nLoftus-Cheek – Enzo – Felix\n\nZiyech – Havertz – Sterling\n\nWe were subjected to flashing graphics and a booming voice blathering on about glory and history that gave the impression that the home club were the epitome of success and greatness, rather than a club that has won just one piece of silverware in twenty-four years.\n\nI still don’t like to see us in Tottenham navy socks.\n\nWhy? Just why?\n\nI detected the Tottenham shirts looking quite grubby, far from lilywhite, as if the colour had run in the wash.\n\nPre-match, I had heard not a single shout, chant or song from the home support.\n\nThe game began and we had just as much of it as they did. There were a few forays, especially down our left where Sterling seemed to be gifted extra space. There had already been a piece of sublime defending from Thiago Silva, but after a strong tackle on Harry Kane, our vaunted Brazilian went down in pain. He tried to run it off but, alas, was replaced by Wesley Fofana. Until then, we had definitely had the upper hand. There was a shot from Joao Felix. And another.\n\nIt was at around this time that Gary realised that Hakim Ziyech was on the pitch.\n\nIt was lovely to hear more “Vialli” chants. These became, as the game continued, our stock response to their tiresome “Y*d Army!” chants.\n\nThere was a lovely lofted pass out to Ben Chilwell from Enzo Fernandez and I quipped “it would appear that we have a playmaker in our midst.”\n\nThe bloke behind me was irritating me. I couldn’t criticise his support, but his voice sounded like he had been gargling with gravel. It got rather tiresome when he kept moaning about our lack of support for the boys.\n\nSigh.\n\n“Turn it in mate” I muttered to myself.\n\nTottenham were nothing special, but Pierre-Emile Hojberg thumped a shot against the base of a post before being whacked away for a corner.\n\nBefore half-time, a sizzling effort from Sterling forced a low save from Fraser Forster, who used to be a goalkeeper.\n\nIn the stands, all was quiet.\n\nIn the closing moments of the first period, a VAR farce. Being so low down, I couldn’t really see what had happened but one minute Ziyech was sent off after a VAR review, but then after a second review, he was allowed to continue.\n\nPathetic. I hate modern football.\n\nThe mood in the away quadrant was “we haven’t been great but neither have they.”\n\nPre-match, I would have taken a 0-0.\n\n“Halfway to paradise, lads.”\n\nThe second-half began preposterously. Within a few seconds of the re-start, Kepa was able to make a low save at the near post from Emerson Royal and Enzo hacked the ball out. Sadly, Skipp robbed Felix and unleashed a powerful shot on goal.\n\nMy mind was calm though.\n\n“That’s a long way out. It is at Kepa. He should save that easily.”\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\nThe ball seemed to go through his arms as he back-peddled slightly.\n\nBollocks.\n\nThe mood in the away end worsened and our support dwindled further. With their team now in front, the home support decided to sing up.\n\nI heard four songs and four songs only, three of which were all about being Jewish.\n\nOur game fell apart despite the promptings of Enzo, who at least tried to knit things together. But everything was so slow and predictable, and most fifty-fifty challenges didn’t go our way.\n\nChanges.\n\nMason Mount for Ziyech.\n\nDenis Zakaria for Loftus-Cheek.\n\nI was surprised how deep Kane was playing for that lot. He was their main playmaker on many occasions.\n\nOur play didn’t improve. There was a half-chance for Kai Havertz.\n\nNext up was the disappearance of the referee Stuart Atwell. I suspected a problem with his technical gizmos but the home end had either ideas. He came back on after a minute or so away.\n\nThis was a shocking game of football.\n\nSadly, poor marking at a corner gifted Kane with a tap in on eighty-two minutes.\n\nSigh.\n\nBody after body vacated the away end, including Mister Gravel and his mate behind me.\n\nThere was no way back from this, despite Potter making two late substitutions.\n\nMykhailo Mudryk for Joao Felix.\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang for Sterling.\n\nMudryk showed a bit of endeavour at the death, but by now the home fans were heaping it on us.\n\n“Chelsea get battered, everywhere they go…”\n\nThe only surprise was that Son didn’t score when he came on as a late substitute.\n\nThis was a truly horrible game of football, a truly horrible experience. There were no positives to come from this match. And taken as a whole, the atmosphere was decidedly muted for a London Derby.\n\n61,000 and we still don’t sing?\n\nSo, what of the future? I don’t know. Relegation? No, surely not. But yet we are in a truly awful run of form. Two wins out of fourteen in all competitions. Our remaining away games make me shudder.\n\nHowever, there really can’t be many Chelsea fans left who think that Graham Potter is the man to lead us on…\n\nNext up, Leeds United at home, 1983 and all that.\n\nSee you there.\n\nRIP Lovejoy\n\nLeeds United vs. Chelsea : 21 August 2022.\n\nWe had to wait around eighteen years to attend a league game at Elland Road and we were then able to visit it twice in just shy of fifteen weeks.\n\nOur last away game of 2021/22 and our second away match of 2022/23?\n\nOK, so be it.\n\nLet’s go to work.\n\nIn May, it was all rather rushed; a hard slog on the motorways of England after a half-day at work, and a quick meet-up at the pub before disappearing inside to witness a pretty decent night of football in front of the Leeds hordes.\n\nThis time was a little more relaxed. I was up at 5.45am and collected PD at 7am and then LP at around 7.20am. I stopped twice en route but arrived in the car park of “The Drysalters” on the Leeds ring road at 11.15am. The 240 miles had been covered in just four hours of driving. I was happy with that. The pub was allegedly scheduled to open at midday but it was already serving pints when we arrived. I soon spotted a couple of Chelsea acquaintances. Within a short time, the place was mobbed with both home and away supporters. It felt odd to be back so soon after the recent visit. Pints – double pints for the drinkers – were purchased and the weather outside was pleasant. Deano – from West Yorkshire, now Lancashire, but steadfastly Chelsea – soon arrived and joined us. I asked a copper to take a photo of us together.\n\n“That’s ‘Crimewatch’ sorted” laughed Parky.\n\nAn Uber cab drew up outside and there was a bit of a commotion.\n\n“Is that your pizza just arrived” I asked the two policemen.\n\nSoon, Goggles from the Fulham branch arrived on the pavement.\n\n“Alright Paul? Alright Parky?”\n\nI still found it a little odd that this once “home fans only” pub now welcomed away fans, and that Chelsea songs were being heartily sung by a few. It wasn’t quite as noisy as in May though. The times have certainly changed over the last twenty years. Looking back to that game in May, I remembered the only trouble that we had encountered took place at Woolley Edge Services on the M1 after the game. Parky and I were drying our hands after using the facilities when we felt a splash of cold water directed at us from behind. Evidently, a Leeds fan must have spotted Parky’s little Chelsea badge on his polo shirt and had decided to take retribution after his team’s loss against a dreaded enemy.\n\nYeah, how times have changed.\n\nSince my last Chelsea game against Tottenham last Sunday, I had seen two Frome Town games. There was a disappointing 3-3 draw at home to Willand Rovers in the league on Tuesday followed by a fine 3-0 away win at Buckland Athletic in the Preliminary Round of the FA Cup on the Saturday. The two footballing journeys of the weekend to Devon and West Yorkshire would total 650 miles – just over 1,000km for those reading in Ireland, the rest of Europe and Canada – and it is doubtful that I have ever driven further for two football games on consecutive days.\n\nIn May, I didn’t have time to attempt much of a look at Elland Road but, with tons of time to spare on this occasion, I set off with Deano at about 12.30pm. Deciding that the queues in the boozer were too long, PD and LP soon caught up with us. I walked past the stadium, past some stalls – there was already a healthy pre-match buzz – and up a footpath to a vantage point that looks down on the whole area.\n\nBefore a game in 1995/96, I had been drinking in the middle of Leeds with my Rotherham United mate Ian and his Leeds United pal from school days. We took a cab to Beeston and I remembered the short walk down that footpath, past the Old Peacock pub, and the grand old view that it afforded. I wanted to recreate a photo that I took before that game.\n\nThe walk up to Beeston was a good cardio-vascular workout for me. Once at the top, I positioned myself along a terraced street with the white steel roof supports of the huge East Stand in the distance. Down below, fans were winding their way down the footpath to the busy roads below. I took plenty of photographs. I was pleased with this. It set the scene nicely. Elland Road is a good three miles out of the busy city centre, and the vista afforded me from Beeston included lots and lots of greenery. Unlike stereotypical northern grounds such as Burnley and Blackburn Rovers, this stadium was never hemmed in among tight terraced streets. Beginning life as Leeds City, Leeds United then came to life in 1919 and have always played at Elland Road. It was an “out of town” ground before such stadia recently become de rigueur.\n\nAn odd fact; I always used to think that the home end – now the Don Revie Stand – from the ‘seventies and onwards was simply known as “The Kop” but only recently, the past few years, realised that it was known locally as The Gelderd End.\n\nThey love those classic white, blue and yellow bar scarves at Elland Road. They also love the iconic Admiral shirt from the mid-‘seventies. I must have seen a fair few before the game in May and I spotted many on this visit too.\n\nAround Elland Road, street side electric boxes have been painted in various shades of white, yellow and blue depicting many of the club’s moments by local artist Andy McVeigh. Maybe that can be next season’s photo project.\n\nI bumped into Deano outside the East Stand. This was once the largest capacity club stand in the UK, built during the 1992/93 season for the then champions, only for it to be overtaken by the other United along the other end of the M62 soon after. It holds some 17,000. I remember that at the 1995 FA Cup semi-final between Everton and Tottenham (4-1), there were Everton fans on three sides of the ground with all the Tottenham lot in the one stand.\n\nI digress.\n\nAs fate would have it, I was sat – stood – in virtually the same place as in May. Last time, I was in seat 48 of the front row of the upper level of the main stand, the John Charles Stand. This time, I was in seat 50 of the same row. There was an empty seat so PD joined us.\n\nThe front five : Davidson, Phillips, Daniels, Parkins, Axon.\n\nThe sun was out and those opposite in the Jack Charlton Stand – the East Stand, the former Lowfields Stand and terrace, the family stand in the lower tier – must have felt that they were being baked alive. Everything was cool in the shadows of the away section.\n\nThomas Tuchel, unable to call on N’Golo Kante, selected the following team :\n\nMendy\n\nJames – Silva – Koulibaly\n\nLoftus-Cheek – Jorginho – Gallagher – Cucarella\n\nMount – Havertz – Sterling\n\nWe would again be using falsies up front and it was all or bust.\n\nLeeds? It pains me that I didn’t recognise many of the home team. Such is my fading awareness of football outside of SW6 these days that my knowledge of opponents’ teams is scant.\n\nI bet I can name most of that 1991/92 team though.\n\nFrom memory…\n\nJohn Lukic in goal.\n\nMel Sterland at right-back, Tony Dorigo at left.\n\nChris Whyte in the middle. Who was the other centre-back? Dunno.\n\nThe famous midfield of Gordon Strachan, Gary McAllister, David Batty and Gary Speed, God rest his soul.\n\nUpfront, Brian Deane and Lee Chapman.\n\nWith Eric Cantona as a late addition.\n\nWho was that bloody centre-back? No, can’t remember.\n\nAh, it has come to me. Chris Fairclough.\n\nI am pretty sure that their squad was the smallest-ever to win a league title. And it was also the last team to lift the Football League version.\n\nDear reader : football did not start in 1992/93.\n\nBack to 2022/23, thirty years on.\n\nThe teams lined-up.\n\n“Marching On Together” boomed.\n\nChelsea were wearing navy socks. Answers on a postcard.\n\nIt was both a lively and a scrappy start to the game. We were attacking the old Kop, once the home of the most vociferous section of the Leeds support, but now playing second fiddle to the rabid hard-core to our right in the South Stand, or rather the Norman Hunter Stand. Raheem Sterling went close early on after good link-up play. Then two chances for the home team, Daniel James and Jack Harrison getting shots in on goal.\n\nI am not convinced that we will ever see the best of Ruben Loftus-Cheek as a wing-back, but we found him coming into the box on an angle. Unfortunately, he dallied too long and the space evaporated and he was soon confronted by three Leeds defenders who halted his progress.\n\nThe noise from both sections of the crowd was impressive.\n\n“Dambusters” was aired in the John Charles Stand.\n\n“Father’s Gun” countered in the Norman Hunter Stand.\n\nIs there much of a rivalry these days? The problem is that we just haven’t played them enough in the past twenty years for that classic, almost legendary, rivalry to have held firm all of the way through those years. It was bubbling along nicely in the ‘nineties when both clubs were jousting at the top table, but Leeds then got themselves relegated.\n\nLet’s say it’s a dormant rivalry, awaiting to explode, awaiting ignition. The battles off the pitch kept the rivalry at such an intense level in past times. Those lads who stood toe to toe in the good old bad old days are probably grandfathers now and not involved. The new breed is aware of the history, but there is simply no recent history.\n\nLeeds were full of energy and closed us down as soon as we had the merest sniff of the ball.\n\nI was celebrating wildly on a quarter of an hour when Sterling slotted home after a pass from Cucarella but the goal was called back for off-side. I felt a proper divvy. I suspect I wasn’t the only one.\n\nOn twenty minutes, a fine move ended with Mason Mount poking a shot at the Leeds goal but their ‘keeper Illan Meslier reacted well to keep it out.\n\nWe were edging possession but were not creating a great deal. I thought that Conor Gallagher was possibly trying too hard to impress and he found it difficult to knit things together. It did not help that Jorginho alongside him seemed to be slowing things down as soon as we sensed a break. There was one moment when he received the ball just inside our half with no Leeds player ahead of him for a good five yards. On receiving the ball, he reverted to type with that cradling of the ball and a slow movement to turn towards his defence and playing the ball back. Safety first was always his mantra.\n\n“Attack you fucker.”\n\nKoulibaly seemed to be rather discombobulated at times. He was bamboozled with the quick turn of pace from an unknown Leeds attacker and grabbed the player’s shirt in desperation. He was suitably booked.\n\n“Embarassing.”\n\nThen, a fucking calamity.\n\nA Thiago Silva back-pass to Edouard Mendy. Everything seemed to be in slow motion now. There was a dither. He lost possession when an attempt to dummy the Leeds attacker Brenden Aaronson backfired and the ball was thumped into an empty net from mere inches.\n\nFucksake.\n\nMendy’s frustration was mirrored by that of ours. And then some. We have seen this before, right? And we have all commented before.\n\n“Kick it away! Safety first! Get rid!”\n\nAs the scorer wheeled away in ecstasy, my eyes were unavoidably drawn to the scene to my right in the South Stand. It was madness. In all my times of going to football, I can never remember seeing such a reaction to any goal being played out in front of me. Bodies were falling in every direction. Limbs everywhere. Screams. Ecstasy. Complete madness.\n\nIt was – actually – despite the horrible sinking feeling of conceding a killer first goal a magnificent sight.\n\nA horribly magnificent sight.\n\nFackinell.\n\nShockingly, just two minutes later, we conceded a second goal. A whipped-in free-kick from the Leeds left found the perfect leap from Rodrigo. His bullet header found the back of the net with ease.\n\nFuck.\n\nThere was another predictable riot in the South Stand.\n\nLimbs again. I drew my camera and reluctantly took a photograph or two; sometimes, a moment simply has to be captured. Ugh.\n\nThirty-seven minutes had elapsed. Some Chelsea supporters in the lower tier, I noticed, left and did not return.\n\n“Thanks then…”\n\nI turned to Parky.\n\n“Mountain to climb.”\n\nWe didn’t create much in the rest of the half, a Cucarella effort barely troubling the Leeds custodian.\n\nOnly Sterling was a half-success. Havertz and Mount were so quiet.\n\nAs the second-half began, there was a change to the system but this only became apparent after a while. We played with a four at the back. A nice piece of skill from Loftus-Cheek in front of us allowed a Cucarella effort on goal and we hoped for an upturn in our play. Yes, we dominated possession but didn’t really create too much. On the two occasions that we were in on goal, one on one, we not only misfired but both chances were offside anyway.\n\nOn sixty-four minutes, changes.\n\nChristian Pulisic for Gallagher.\n\nHakim Ziyerch for Jorginho.\n\nWe now had Pulisic, Ziyech and Sterling to run and twist their way into dangerous positions. In theory. This never looked like a decent game plan to this casual observer. We needed a focal point, a Broja.\n\nPah. What do I know?\n\nA low shot from James was turned around his post by Meslier.\n\nWe continued to dominate but Leeds gave us no time to develop anything worthwhile. Our jousting thrusts needed to be augmented by an occasional hammer at the heart of the defence. But our artillery was without suitable weaponry. A towering leap by Koulibaly – occasionally excellent blocks making up for his malfunctioning sat nav – from a corner was easily claimed by Meslier.\n\nOur play stagnated. Leeds never stopped running.\n\nIt was to get worse. A rapid break down their left and a cross from James, and Harrison picked up the pieces.\n\nThe ground exploded again.\n\nMay : Leeds United 0 Chelsea 3.\n\nAugust : Leeds United 3 Chelsea 0.\n\nYet more Chelsea fans drifted away.\n\nEarlier, we had goaded the home fans with “you’ve only got one song” but this was an empty sentiment.\n\nWe were being out sung, and how.\n\n“We are Leeds. And we’re proud of you.”\n\n“All Leeds aren’t we?”\n\n“Marching on together.”\n\n“And shoot the Chelsea scum.”\n\nAt times, the noise was electric.\n\nIt was bloody horrible. Here I was, stood exposed in the front row of the top section of the away end in full view of the tormenting home support. Loads of Chelsea had drifted away as the game progressed. Gaps appeared in the seats.\n\n“Your support is fucking shit.”\n\nI stood silent. We had no answer. Our pants were being pulled down here.\n\nI looked over at the three thousand in the South Stand – where I once stood when it was the away section in 2001 – and I could not help but notice that virtually all were in their twenties, virtually all were lads – by design? who knows? – and all were up for it. We do not have a section like that at Chelsea and haven’t had one for decades.\n\nAnd we were fair game. We had no real response to the piss-taking. We were being schooled both on and off the pitch. This was truly horrific.\n\nI’ve attended games where we have been gubbed before – the 0-4 loss at Old Trafford in Lampard’s first game was particularly painful, Daniel James involved then too – but this one felt like one of the worst.\n\nA Cucarella block averted a fourth after an effort on goal from Rodrigo. If anything, the noise increased further with the Kop now being heard too.\n\nBen Chilwell replaced Mount.\n\nThen, a second yellow for Koulibaly.\n\nOff he went.\n\nBollocks.\n\nAzpilicueta for Sterling.\n\nI had lost interest by then. I just wanted to get back to my car. I wanted to scoff that waiting Ginster’s Cornish Pasty. I wanted out.\n\nAt the final whistle, relief.\n\nI chatted to a few friends close by, and we all agreed about the amazing antics and booming noise from the home fans.\n\nGrudging respect.\n\nThis, though, was a deafeningly poor show from us.\n\nSo much for us playing with falsies up front. We just looked like tits.\n\nEverton vs. Chelsea : 6 August 2022.\n\nMy summer had been quiet. I never fancied another CFC tour to the US during the close-season, and there was no holiday abroad to excite me. It was simply a case of staying at home, saving pennies and attempting to relax from the burden of work which was as busy as ever. The highlight of my summer season was a little burst of gigs involving some music from my youth; Tom Robinson, Tears For Fears, Stiff Little Fingers and China Crisis. Waiting in the wings in September are Altered Images and Toyah. It will be 1982 all over again and that is never a bad thing.\n\nThe summer was also short. The gap between the last game of 2021/22 to the opening match of the new season was a brief ten weeks. As time passed, I became increasingly bored with the constant tittle-tattle of rumour and counter rumour regarding our transfer targets. I realised how much I disliked the mere mention of the name Fabrizio Romano; nobody likes a smart arse. I again squirmed every time fan after fan, supporter after supporter, FIFA nerd after FIFA nerd used the phrase “done deal” without transfers being completed. Once players sign, then we can talk.\n\nMaybe it’s an age thing but sometimes I feel that I am from another footballing planet compared to a lot of our support.\n\nOur season would open up in a grand fashion. To start, my favourite away stadium with a trip to Everton’s Goodison Park and then what I would class as our biggest home game with the visit of Tottenham. Two absolute belters. Early on in the campaign there would also be visits to Leeds United, Southampton and Fulham. These are three cracking away trips too. But the downside of this opening burst of away games is that we only just visited Everton, Leeds and Southampton very recently. Could the league computer not have spaced the buggers out a bit?\n\nAs the new season approached, I was inevitably concerned that my enthusiasm levels weren’t at especially high levels, but this is so often the case. I often find that I need the season to begin for me to get fully back into the swing of things. But my indifference to the new campaign actually shocked me this summer.\n\nI was faced with the age-old question: was my love of the game waning? It’s a strange one. Many aspects of the modern game leave me cold. So cold. Yet I lap up the chance to attend live matches. There is the old cliché about football – Chelsea – being my drug and I can’t dispute this. Perhaps I should add that my summer season included four Frome Town friendlies, my most ever.\n\nFootball, eh?\n\nI hate you but I love you too.\n\nThe alarm was set for the new season at 5.30am. By 7.30am I had collected the Fun Boy Three – PD, GG and LP – and we were on our way once again.\n\nI made good progress. After picking up PD at 7am, I had deposited the three of them outside “The Thomas Frost” boozer on Walton Road just south of Goodison only four hours later. It was surely my quickest-ever journey up to Merseyside.\n\nWhile my fellow travelling companions settled down for five or more hours of supping, I began a little tour around the city, one that I had been promising myself for ages. It was also time for a little more introspection.\n\nThis would be my fiftieth consecutive season of attending Chelsea games – 1973/74 to 2022/23, count’em up – even though my fiftieth anniversary will not be until March 2024. Additionally, this would be the fifteenth season that I been writing these blogs. Long gone are the viewing figures of when these were featured on the Chelsea In America bulletin board, but these are such a part of my match-going routine now and I can’t give them up. However, over the summer one of my close friends, Francis, suggested that I should take a year out of match photography and blogging. Just to give myself a rest. An average blog takes four hours of my time. But the look that I gave him probably shocked him to the core.\n\n“Nah. It’s what I do mate.”\n\nI will be honest, I did go over the options in my mind though.\n\nBut here I am. Writing away. Taking photos.\n\nI hope that I still maintain the will to keep doing this for a while yet. With the rumours of us partaking in a partial rebuild of Stamford Bridge under the new Todd Boehly regime, I have to continue on until that is finished surely? The success of the Roman Abramovich era might never be matched but there is always something to write about at Chelsea.\n\nOn we go.\n\nOn my own now, I edged my car south and west towards the River Mersey. Within five minutes, I was parked up a few hundred yards away from the construction site of the new Everton Stadium at Bramley Moore Dock. Camera in hand, I set off to record the progress being made.\n\nI hopped up onto a small wall to gain a good vantage point of the overall scene. This would be photo number one of the season.\n\nSnap.\n\nOn leaping down from the wall, my legs crumpled and I fell.\n\nSplat.\n\nThe camera and spare lens went flying. My knees – my fucking knees! – were smarting. I was sure I had torn my jeans. There was blood on my right hand. What a start to the season’s photographs. I dusted myself down, then let out a huge laugh.\n\nThe first fackinell of the season? Oh yes.\n\nOne photo taken and carnage.\n\nHa.\n\nI limped further along Boundary Street and spent a good twenty minutes or so taking it all in. I found it rather funny that a bold sign warned against site photography and sharing images on social media. During my spell there, around fifteen other lads – not being sexist, they were all lads – called by to take some photos too. I am not ashamed to say that I have recently subscribed to two YouTube channels that provide drone updates of the construction sites at Bramley Moore and also Anfield.\n\nI love a stadium, me.\n\nSo, the scene that I was witnessing was indeed pretty familiar. The skeletal shell of the new stadium is rising with the two end stands – the south and north – being the first to pierce the sky alongside the murky grey of the famous river. There are seven cranes covering the site. Maybe those lads were just crane spotters.\n\nI must admit it looks a glorious setting for a new stadium. Evertonians – like me, no doubt – will hate the upheaval of moving out of good old Goodison in a couple of years, but the move represents the chance to level up the playing field with their more moneyed neighbours at the top of the hill up on Stanley Park. I had a fear that last season’s visit to Goodison would be my last. I believe that the new stadium is slated to open up during the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nThere was a chance – with Everton likely to flirt with relegation again perhaps – that this day would mark my last ever visit to Goodison.\n\nI hoped not.\n\nI have a personal history with this stadium that I have often mentioned.\n\nI marched back to the car and then drove south towards the city centre. I immediately passed a huge derelict warehouse – a tobacco warehouse I believe – and I had visions of the red brick structure being upgraded to a hotel to take care of the new match day traffic that the new stadium would attract.\n\nBut I then heard a voice inside my head, of my mate Chris, a staunch Evertonian.\n\n“Chris lad, all our support comes from Merseyside, The Wirral, the new towns, out to the North Wales coast, we don’t have any day trippers, la.”\n\nI continued on. I have driven around the city centre – or at least the area by the Albert Dock – on many occasions but the scale of the Liver Building knocked me for six. What a building. It’s magnificent. But I drove past it – I spotted a massive bar called “Jurgen’s” – and headed up the hill inland. For many years, ten or more, I have wanted to visit the two cathedrals in the city. This was as perfect a day as any to get this accomplished.\n\nI parked outside the massive Anglican Cathedral on St. James Mount. The sandstone used immediately reminded me of the stone used on the tunnels approaching Lime Street – and the “Cockneys Die” graffiti – and of Edge Hill Station on that first-ever visit to the city for football in May 1985. The building is huge. It is the longest cathedral in the world. I popped inside as a service was taking place. The visitors – there were many – walked around in hushed tones. A few photographs were inevitably taken.\n\nI then headed north and then west and aimed for the second of the city’s great cathedrals, or the fourth if the cathedrals at either end of Stanley Park are included, the Metropolitan Cathedral. This Roman Catholic cathedral – made of concrete in the ‘sixties – sits at Mount Pleasant.\n\nHope Street links the two religious buildings. It looked a very lively place with theatres and eateries. I dived into the granddaddy of all Liverpool’s pubs, The Philharmonic, famous the world over for the elaborate porcelain fittings in the gents. More photographs followed both inside and out of the funkier of the two cathedrals – nicknamed “The Mersey Funnel” and “Paddy’s Wigwam” – and I was lost in my own world for a few moments.\n\nThe art deco Philharmonic Hall looked a magnificent site. The TV tower in the city centre was spotted between a canopy of green leaves. There were blue skies overhead. The Liver Birds could be seen peaking over some terraced rooftops. A few hen parties were making Hope Street their own. Maybe on another visit to the city, I will investigate further.\n\nBut it was time to move on. I dabbed a CD on as I pulled out of the car park – China Crisis’ Gary Daly’s solo album “Luna Landings”- a 2020 issue of some synth tracks recorded in the ‘eighties – and it was just perfect.\n\nMy route took me past some old, and grand, Georgian houses no doubt once owned by the cream of Liverpool’s entrepreneurs, businessmen and traders when a full forty percent of global trade came through the port of Liverpool. But it then took me past Edge Hill, and onto Tue Brook – past the drinking dens of “The Flat Iron” and “The Cabbage Hall” of match days at Anfield in previous years – and everything was a lot more down-at-heal, the Liverpool of hackneyed legend.\n\nAt around 3pm I was parked up in Stanley Park. Up to my left, the extension of the Annie Road Stand at Anfield was in full flow. It will bring the capacity up to 61,000. The new Everton one will be just under 53,000.\n\nOuch, la.\n\nI popped into “The Thomas Frost” – my least favourite football pub – and located the lads, who had been joined by Deano and Dave, plus a cast of what appeared to be thousands. A friend, Kim, had not been able to attend due to COVID so her ticket was passed on to another pal, Sophie. The chaps had witnessed the Fulham and Liverpool 2-2 draw, and PD was shocked at the hatred that the watching Evertonians showed their local rivals.\n\nHeysel robbed Evertonians of a tilt at European glory and it is not forgotten by many.\n\nA song for Marc Cucarella was aired by the younger element. It would become the song of the day.\n\nI excused myself and squeezed out of the boozer.\n\nThis particular corner of Liverpool, along the Walton Road, is a classic pre-match location for Everton home games. “The Thomas Frost”, “The Clock”, “The Party Pad” and “St. Hilda’s” are close, and drinkers from both clubs were inside and outside all of them. At just gone 4pm, my friends – and brothers – Tommie (Chelsea) and Chris (Everton) approached “St. Hilda’s” and it was glorious to see them again.\n\nHere was the reason why we go to football.\n\nLads enjoying a laugh, a catch-up, a bevvy.\n\nI was welcomed by the Evertonians that I met outside the pub. I loved it.\n\nThis is football.\n\nChris was in the middle of a punk festival – “Rebellion” – up the road in Blackpool and so was now mixing up his twin passions. The brothers are off to watch Stiff Little Fingers together in Dublin over the next few weeks. That 1982 vibe again. Both of the brothers helped me plan my Buenos Aires adventure a few years back and we all love our travel / football addiction.\n\nWe briefly mentioned previous encounters. This was the first time that we had begun a league season at Everton in my living memory, though there had been opening games at Stamford Bridge in 1995 – Ruud Gullit’s league debut, a 0-0 draw – and also way back in 1978. The earlier game – a 0-1 home loss – was memorable for two of my pre-match friends in 2022. It was Glenn’s first ever Chelsea game and he still rues a miss by Ray Wilkins. It was also Chris’ first visit to Stamford Bridge with Everton. I spoke about it with him. It has gone down in Chelsea folklore as being the “High Street Kensington” game, when Chelsea ambushed Everton’s mob at that particular tube station. This inspired the infamous “Ordinary To Chelsea” graffiti outside Lime Street, aimed at uniting both sets of fans to travel together to Stamford Bridge for the Liverpool league fixture later in the season. The graffiti is so iconic that sweatshirts are being produced featuring the image almost fifty years later.\n\nTime was again moving on.\n\nChris and I sauntered off to opposite ends of the Bullens Road.\n\nI left him with a parting shot.\n\n“Up The Fucking Toffees.”\n\nHe smiled.\n\n“Up The Fucking Toffees.”\n\nThe kick-off was at 5.30pm and I was inside at around 4.45pm or so.\n\nAt last, I had a seat that wasn’t tucked way past the goal-line. In fact, it was right on the goal-line. Compared to previous visits my seat 38 felt as if I was watching from the royal box. John from Paddington now sits with Alan, Gary, Parky and little old me at away games now; the Fantastic Five. I looked over at the Park End; Everton had handed out tons of royal blue flags for their fans to wave. I heard Chris’ voice once again.\n\n“Typical Kopite behaviour.”\n\nI hoped that the ground would be full of shiny unhappy people by the end of the game.\n\nJohn asked me for my prediction.\n\nI thought for a few seconds and went safe : “0-0.”\n\nIt was time to reacquaint myself with more than a few friends as the kick-off time approached. I had recently seen Julie and Tim at the SLF gig in Frome. And I had shared a fine evening with Kev in Aberdare at the recent China Crisis gig.\n\n“From Abu Dhabi to Aberdare” anyone?\n\nKev, in fact, was wearing a China Crisis T-shirt. I had joked on the night that I would wear my exact same copy to the game too, but I had forgotten all about that. Probably just as well, eh Kev?\n\nWe could work out the starting line-up from the drills taking place in front of us. The confirmation came on the twin TV screens at opposite ends of the ground.\n\nMendy\n\nDave – Silva – Koulibaly\n\nJames – Jorginho – Kante – Chilwell\n\nMount – Havertz – Sterling\n\nIn light of our former chairman’s departure, I am surprised that nobody else but me did the “$ out, £ in” joke over the summer.\n\nThe PA ramped up the volume with a few Everton favourites, and then the stirring “Z Cars” rung out around Goodison.\n\nIt was unchanged as it has been from around 1994.\n\nThe rather mundane and bland single-tier of the Park Lane to my left. The still huge main stand, double-decked, sloping away in the top left corner. St’ Luke’s Church peeping over the TV screen in the opposite corner and then the continuous structure of the Gwladys Street bleeding into the Bullens Road, the Leitch cross-struts on show for decades but not for much longer.\n\nA couple of large banners were paraded in the Gwladys Street.\n\nTo the left, an image of The Beatles with an Everton scarf wrapped around them all. Were they really all Evertonians? Well, they weren’t day trippers, that’s for sure.\n\nI hoped that their team would be The Beaten.\n\nTo the right, there was an image of our Frank on a banner. Gulp.\n\nThe teams lined-up.\n\nA shrill noise.\n\nFootball was back.\n\nAlas we were back in the odd away kit. From a long way away, it looks reasonable, but up close I can’t say I am too fond of the stencilled lion nonsense on the light blue / turquoise hoops. This overly fussy design, which is mirrored in the collar of the home kit, resembles a great aunt’s frock design from 1971 far too much for my liking.\n\nMe, bored rigid on a family outing, stifling yawns :“Yes, I’d love another piece of fruit cake please auntie”…but thinking “your dress looks ridiculous.”\n\nTo be honest, in the pre-release glimpses, the colour looked more jade green than blue. Eck from Glasgow, sat to my left, must have been having kittens.\n\nBoth teams were wearing white shorts. I think that ruling has changed only recently.\n\nThe game began. I was immediately warned by a sweaty steward to not use my camera. In the ensuing moments, Eck leant forward and shielded my illicit pursuits. It worked a treat.\n\nAs the game started to develop, the away crowd got behind the team, but with the lower tier of the Bullens outdoing the top tier. I must admit I didn’t sing too much during the whole game; I am getting old, eh? Soon into the game, I experienced chant envy as I couldn’t make out the Koulibaly song being sung with gusto in the lower deck.\n\nGoodison has been an awful venue for us of late. Our record was of four consecutive losses.\n\nBut we began as we often began with the majority of possession.\n\nThe first real incident involved Kai Havertz who picked up a wayward clearance from Jordan Pickford after a poor back pass from Ben Godfrey. Rather than pass inside, he lashed the ball against the side netting. Attempting to tackle, Godfrey injured himself and there was a delay of many minutes before he was stretchered off.\n\nThere was a swipe from Mason Mount that Jordan Pickford managed to claw away. At the other end, a deep cross from Vitaly Mykolenko was headed goal wards by James Tarkowski but Edouard Mendy did ever so well to tip it over.\n\nEverton occasionally threatened, but our defence – the veteran Dave especially – were able to quell their advances. N’Golo Kante, right after a Chelsea attack, was able to block an Everton shot back in his own penalty area. He had no right to be there. The man was starting the season as our strongest player.\n\nNext up, Thiago Silva – the calm and cool maestro – cut out an Everton break down our right, and this drew rapturous applause.\n\nA shot from Kante was fumbled by Pickford but although Raheem Sterling pounced to score – a dream start? – he was ruled offside. It looked offside to me, way down on the other goal line. Who needs cameras?\n\nTo be truthful, despite corner after corner (or rather shite corner after shite corner) that resulted in a few wayward headers, it wasn’t much of a half. The home fans were quiet, and the away section in the upper tier were getting quieter with each passing minute.\n\nBut corner after corner were smacked into the Everton box.\n\n“More corners than a Muller warehouse.”\n\nI noticed that the movement off the ball was so poor.\n\nI chatted to Eck : “Without a target man, our forwards need to be constantly moving, swapping over, pulling defenders away, allowing balls into space.”\n\nThere was sadly none of it. I couldn’t remember two white-shirted players crossing over the entire half.\n\nI had visions of a repeat of the dull 0-0 at Stoke City that began the 2011/12 campaign.\n\nIn injury time, Abdoulaye Doucoure manhandled Ben Chilwell on a foray into the box. It looked a clear penalty to me.\n\nJorginho.\n\n1-0\n\nAlan : “They’ll have to come at us now, like.”\n\nChris : “Come on my little diamonds, like.”\n\nIt was the last kick of the half. Phew.\n\nAs the second-half began, the sun was still beating down on us in the upper tier. I was getting my longest exposure to the sun of the entire summer. But the game didn’t really step up. The noise continued to fall away. If anything, Everton threatened much more than us in the second-half.\n\nA shot from Demarai Gray – after a mess up between Silva and Mendy – was thankfully blocked by our man from Senegal.\n\nCelery was tossed around in the away section and some local stewards looked bemused.\n\nSome substitutions.\n\nChristian Pulisic for a very quiet Mount.\n\nRuben Loftus-Cheek for Chilwell.\n\nReece swapped wings and Ruben played wide right.\n\nIt was pretty grim and pretty tepid stuff this. A tough watch.The practised attacking patterns needed more work. It just wasn’t gelling at all. And during that second-half we allowed Everton a little too much space in key areas. It is early days though. But I have to say it as I saw it.\n\nI could lose myself in this honesty.\n\nMore substitutions from Thomas Tuchel.\n\nArmando Broja for a weak Havertz.\n\nMarc Cucarella for Koulibaly.\n\nI wasn’t too happy about us singing Frank’s name during the game.\n\nIt took bloody ages for us to get an effort, any effort, on goal. It came on eighty-one minutes, a James free-kick, tipped over. Then, just after a pass from Cucarella to Sterling and a shot deflected for a corner.\n\nTo be fair, Pulisic looked keen when he came on and added a new dimension to our play. Cucarella looked mustard too. He looked neat, and picked out a few lovely passes, zipped with pace.\n\n“He’s from Marbella, he eats Bonjela” wasn’t it?\n\nAnd it was a joy to see Broja on the pitch, charging into space, taking defenders with him, a focal point. I hope he is given a full crack of the whip this season.\n\nIn the eighth minute of extra time, Conor Gallagher made his debut and I caught his first touch, at a free-kick, on camera. I see great things for him.\n\nIt ended 1-0.\n\nOutside, I bumped into Sophie, with Andy her father, and remembered that she was soon off to Milan, with a side-visit to Como after talking to me in the pub at the end of last season.\n\n“Did you know Dennis Wise is the CEO at Como?”\n\nIt made Sophie’s day. Dennis is her favourite ever Chelsea player.\n\nWe walked back to the waiting car and shared a few thoughts about the game. It was no classic, but we were all relieved with the win. Tottenham, our next opponents, won 4-1 at home to Southampton and I admitted to PD :\n\n“I’m dreading it.”\n\n“I am too.”\n\nOut\n\nIn\n\nI made good time on the way south, only for us to become entrenched in a lively conversation about all of the players’ performances just as I should have veered off the M6 and onto the M5.\n\n“Isn’t that the Alexander Stadium? Bollocks, I have missed the turning.”\n\nA diversion through the second city was a pain, but I was eventually back on track. As the three passengers fell asleep, I returned to the ‘eighties and Gary Daly.\n\nAnd I wondered what I should call this latest blog.\n\nSome people think it’s fun to entertain.\n\nLeeds United vs. Chelsea : 11 May 2022.\n\nThis was it, then. The long-awaited trip to Elland Road. My last visit was towards the tail end of the 2000/1 season, although the club’s last League visit was in 2003/4. I didn’t go to the League Cup game in December 2012; it came too soon after the jaunt to Japan. Of course, last season the game was behind closed doors, a phrase that I hope that we never have to hear ever again.\n\nWas I looking forward to it?\n\n“By heck as like” and other Yorkshire clichés.\n\nAs soon as the weekend had finished and the collapse against Wolves was behind me, I could not wait to be pounding the tarmac once more. I had booked two half days for this one. I left work at midday and deviated south to collect Parky and then PD. We set off from Frome at just before 1pm. It was a 7.30pm kick-off in West Yorkshire. Plenty of time.\n\nIt was mainly a decent enough trip north. There were rain showers to start but these cleared soon enough. The rest of the journey was spent with me gazing at a Simpsons sky and hoping that any ominous billowing and darkening clouds on the horizon would not ruin our trip. We stopped at Strensham, just south of Worcester, on the M5 at around 2.30pm and then at Woolley Edge, just north of Barnsley, at around 5pm. We then hit a fair bit of slow-moving traffic which meant that our arrival time at “The Drysalters” pub by Elland Road took place at 6pm rather than the envisaged 5.30pm. I dropped the boys off in the pub car park and soon found a cheap place to park nearby.\n\nAs I locked my car, a Leeds fan called out.\n\n“Here we go again.”\n\nI replied “yeah, maybe.”\n\n“The Drysalters” pub is well known to me. I have parked in the car park on two occasions before. We soon spotted Deano, and his son-in-law Steve – a PNE fan – and also three lads from Wiltshire. The three amigos from Northampton were drinking outside in the sun too. There were Chelsea fans everywhere. This sort of scenario would not have happened in the ‘eighties or even ‘nineties when survival was the key pre-game buzzword. Next, Josh appeared with a pint of Diet Coke for me, along with his two mates from Minnesota, Chad and Danny.\n\nA younger set of Chelsea fans were loudly singing the praises of Thomas Tuchel, Thiago Silva, Timo Werner and Edouard Mendy.\n\n“He comes from Senegal.”\n\nAfter just one drink apiece to quench our thirsts, we walked over to Elland Road.\n\nPrevious visits came to mind.\n\nThe first one came in early May 1987. One of my mates at college, Bob, was a Leeds United supporter and had visited Stamford Bridge with me to see a couple of games in 1985/86 and 1986/87. It was time for me to repay the honour. We travelled up by train from Stoke, had a couple of pints near the central station and watched Leeds beat West Brom 3-2 in their final home game of a Second Division season. The gate of 24,688 was their highest that season. What do I remember? The day began with an excellent pint of Sam Smith’s bitter in the pub beforehand. We watched with all the Leeds loons in the infamous South Stand. I remember a pitch invasion at the end and John Sheridan being carried on fans’ shoulders. And of course I remember them singing about us.\n\n“Shoot the Chelsea scum.”\n\nThat season would end disappointingly for Leeds. They had already lost to Coventry City in an FA Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough and they would go on to lose in the play-offs to Charlton Athletic.\n\nMy first visit with Chelsea was in September 1988 when both clubs found themselves in the Second Division again. I was working in the cold store of a local dairy and as was the case with my other long trips north by train that season – Stoke City and Manchester City too – I was coming off a night-shift. I remember struggling to stay awake on both legs of the journey to Leeds. We were yet to win a match after five games in the league and the match at Elland Road – with me watching in the South Stand, now given to away fans much to the consternation of the locals – would be a tough test. Thankfully, an early John Bumstead goal – off his ‘arris – and one from Gordon Durie gave us a surprising but deeply enjoyable win. I don’t remember any trouble at that game despite hundreds of Leeds fans milling around as we caught buses back to the station from right outside the away end.\n\nNext up was a game in November 1995 in which I drove up from Somerset, met up with my mate Ian – Rotherham United – at Stafford and watched from the main stand using tickets that Bob, I think, had bought for us. It was a pretty decent performance and I believe I am correct in saying that it was the first time that Glenn Hoddle had switched to us playing with wing backs – Dan Petrescu and Gareth Hall – outside a back three – Erland Johnsen, David Lee and Michael Duberry – only for us to succumb to a late sucker punch from the boot of Tony Yeboah. I can’t recollect moving a muscle when Leeds scored that goal. Having a mate from South Yorkshire next to me probably disguised my allegiances.\n\nA year later, in December 1996, a Sunday game – live on the TV – and a meek 0-2 loss to a Leeds United team that included Ian Rush. He even scored against us. We were pushed up into the quadrant of yellow seats by the South Stand for this and I can remember our away following was awful, maybe only around 1,000. It was a long old drive home that Sunday evening with work in the morning.\n\nMy final visit took place in April 2001. I had driven up with Glenn and had collected Alan at Stafford en route to save the boy some money. I often did that in those days. Leeds United were a force to be reckoned with at that time. We were back in the South Stand, played decently enough but lost 0-2 to two very late Leeds goals from Robbie Keane and Mark Viduka, with the goals coming in the final five minutes. A tidy roast at Brighouse after the game almost made up for our defeat.\n\nWith relegation threatening Leeds, I decided to make the most of my visit to Elland Road and sped off to take some shots of the stadium. If relegation follows in a few weeks, who knows when I would return. It really was hard to believe I was last outside the South Stand over twenty-one years ago.\n\nMany home fans were wearing the iconic bar scarf from the ‘seventies. I have to say – and my pal Gary agreed with me at the game – that it still looks class. Those tri-colour bar scarves of Leeds United – white, yellow, blue – and Manchester United – red, white, black – and even us – red, green white – were fantastic. I remember the “smiley” badge too, a real ‘seventies classic. Gary and I would mention the Admiral kits. They defined the mid-‘seventies. And the numbered tie-ups on the socks. They were unique. I remembered the “Leeds United AFC” frontage to the West Stand. Bob and I were photographed outside there in 1987, me with a jade Marc O’Polo sweatshirt, one of my favourites, and of course it brought back memories of that classic scene from “Porridge” too.\n\nI spotted a few columns of ‘seventies concrete as the South Stand disappeared around a corner. That a few pillars of brutalist architecture should please me so much is something that I don’t really want to dwell on too much, but it is a sure sign that on these away trips to altered stadia there is no doubt that I love seeing hints of a past.\n\n“The Old Peacock” pub – as iconic a Leeds United sight if ever there was – is now temporarily renamed “The Bielsa” and I remembered walking down the hill towards it from Beeston for the 1995 game, deposited there in a taxi with Ian after a drink in the city centre. There’s a statue of Billy Bremner on the corner, with floral tributes all around. The East Stand is huge. It was built in 1993 on the site of the Lowfields Stand. For a short time, it was the largest stand in the United Kingdom, holding some 17,000, before being overtaken by Celtic and then Manchester United. I can remember the whole of Elland Road being shunted twenty yards to the north in around 1972 with the South Stand being built.\n\nIt was time to get inside.\n\nThere was a bag check outside the away turnstiles and my SLR was waved through. The old main stand, the West Stand, is now named the John Charles after the Leeds United – and Juventus, among others – centre-forward. I made my way upstairs…the steps were carpeted, as was the away bar area.\n\nCarpets in the away end. In Yorkshire.\n\nWhatever next?\n\nI had a cracking seat. Parky, Gary, Alan and I were in the very front row of the upper section. Sadly, the shunting of the pitch in the early ‘seventies meant that those to my far right – geographically, not politically – were left with a shocking view of the pitch, way past the goal line. I had a great view and even I was behind it.\n\nI spotted many familiar faces. It was lovely to see so many mates.\n\nThe sun was still out, catching the East Stand and making it come alive. I looked around. The Kop is now the Don Revie Stand. The East Stand is now the Jack Charlton Stand. The South Stand is now the Norman Hunter Stand. They still dote on that ‘seventies era. It is as if Howard Wilkinson’s League Championship in 1992 never happened. Oh wait, the away bar at Elland Road is called “Howard’s Bar” and that seems a mite disrespectful.\n\nI would talk to Gary about that team during the game.\n\n“Great midfield. Gary Speed, David Batty, Gary McAllister, Gordon Strachan. Had it all.”\n\n“Fanfare For A Common Man” was played on the PA, just like at Wolves. Then came the Leeds anthem “Marching On Together.” Despite my dislike of Leeds throughout my life, my friendship with Bob and Trev – mentioned in a Brentford game this season – means that I am afraid to admit that I knew the words to a few of the songs I would hear during the evening.\n\nThe teams entered the pitch.\n\nLeeds in all white. Chelsea in all blue.\n\nStay still my beating heart.\n\nOur team?\n\nMendy\n\nChristensen – Rudiger – Chalobah\n\nJames – Jorginho – Kovacic – Alonso\n\nPulisic – Lukaku – Mount\n\nPre-match, I feared the worst. I need not have worried. We began so brightly and, with memories of Johnny B’s early goal in 1988, we were soon jumping around like fools. A fine move down our right and the ball was played in sweetly by Reece James for Mason Mount, shades of Frank Lampard at his peak, arriving at just the right time to strike the ball firmly past the Leeds ‘keeper Illan Meslier, aged twelve and three-quarters. Mase raced over to wind up the Leeds fans in the far corner.\n\nHa.\n\nAlan and I resurrected our “THTCAUN / COMLD” routine.\n\nWe were playing some lovely expansive stuff and were finding lots of space out wide. We were playing one-touch football where we could, and I had to ask Alan for some smelling salts. To their credit, all of the Leeds fans in The Kop, the stand opposite and the South Stand – old habits die hard – were standing throughout, and contrasted wildly to the Everton fans in the Park End a couple of weeks ago.\n\n“Marching On Together.”\n\nWe were purring, and Lukaku was much improved. His movement, his work rate, his involvement. It was good to see.\n\nOn around twenty-five minutes, Daniel James – a scorer in that horrible 0-4 loss at Old Trafford in 2019 – scythed down Mateo Kovacic, who up until that point was arguably our best player, and I told Gary “I reckon that’s a red.”\n\nThe referee had soon made up his mind.\n\nRed.\n\nKovacic, full of running, could run no more. After trying to run off his injury, he was replaced by Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n\n“That might mean less movement, Gal.”\n\nBut again I need not have worried. A super run from the sub soon after looked so graceful and it certainly cheered us.\n\nFrom the Chelsea choir :\n\n“Leeds. Leeds are falling apart. Again.”\n\nThere was a glancer from Lukaku on thirty-three minutes that narrowly missed the far post. This was heart-warming stuff indeed. The cross had come from the trusted boot of Reece out on the right, who was finding even more space to exploit. The exact same could be said of Marcos Alonso on the left.\n\nIn our packed section, we were at our Dambustering best.\n\n“We all fucking hate Leeds.”\n\nKalvin Phillips then hacked down Christian Pulisic. This game was living up to the hype, an old-fashioned affair with pulsing runs from deep, mis-timed tackles, battles in key areas.\n\nI turned to Alan : “remember that game at Chelsea in 1997 when they had two sent-off?”\n\nWhen the home team was rewarded with a rare corner in front of me, I was surprised that the home fans didn’t respond with their old “Leeds! Leeds! Leeds! Leeds!” with associated chest beating. That must have fallen from grace since my last visit.\n\nThey had, instead, turned into a crowd of scarf-twirlers.\n\nThe game was halted for a good few minutes when it became apparent that there had been a medical emergency in the lower section of the away support to my left. Sadly, the home fans sung throughout and even dirtied their name further with a couple of offensive comments about “soft southern bastards.”\n\nOn a day that marked the anniversary of the Bradford Fire, this sadly reminded me of a typically shocking moment involving Leeds supporters in the autumn of 1986. Sixteen months after the fire at Valley Parade in May 1985, and with Bradford City hosting Leeds at the Odsal Stadium, some Leeds fans set fire to a chip-van high on the terracing at one end of the stadium.\n\nTo this day, I am left shaking my head.\n\nJust at the end of the half, Trevoh Chalobah sent in a scuffler that went wide of the Leeds goal.\n\nIt was a fine first-half performance, but was I the only one who was a little worried that we hadn’t created more chances?\n\nThe second-half began with Chelsea even more on top and full of running against a Leeds team that were looking like they had already given up on the game, on survival, on life itself. But the home fans were still singing. To be fair, we couldn’t hear the other stands, but from the evidence from The Kop – no gesticulating, no clapping in unison, nowt – it as just the rabble to our right that were making the noise.\n\n“The Yorkshire Republican Army. We’re barmy. Wherever we go. We fear no foe.”\n\nTwo chances showed our intent. A header from Lukaku was high, a volley from Loftus-Cheek went wide.\n\nThen, on fifty-five minutes, a beautiful move involving Jorginho and Mount set up Pulisic on the edge of the box. He took a touch…I said out loud “he can find the corners” and my pulse quickened…\n\nThe low shot was perfectly struck, down low, to the left, “corners.”\n\nGET IN.\n\nThe scorer almost grabbed a second, curling one just wide and as I found myself looking up at the TV screen to my right, both he and myself were pulling the same pained expression.\n\nNext up, Lukaku – full of spirit – took on his marker and rifled just wide too. His play was getting better and better. Yet only as recently as just before the Wolves game had kicked-off, Oxford Frank and I had binned him off.\n\nThere were wildly loud renditions of “Que Sera Sera” – the “Wembley” version by us and not the “Father’s Gun” version by them – and then “Carefree.”\n\nCarl from Stoke, down below me, turned up towards us and yelled :\n\n“ONE MAN WENT TO MOW”\n\nAnd we all followed.\n\nThis was a noisy old game.\n\nI turned to Al : “To be fair, the South Stand haven’t stopped singing all night.”\n\nWe continued.\n\n“We all hate Leeds scum. We all hate Leeds scum. We all hate Leeds scum. We all hate Leeds scum.”\n\nThough this was tame stuff compared to the “witty” interchange about one of Leeds’ sons, but that’s not for here.\n\nOn seventy-eight minutes, a double substitution from Thomas Tuchel, who was now flavour of the month again.\n\nHakim Ziyech for Pulisic. The American had certainly enjoyed a fine game.\n\nDave for Reece. Saving our star man for the next game no doubt.\n\nOn eighty-three minutes, Mount robbed the ball and passed to Ziyech. He then found Lukaku inside the box. What followed was doggedness personified. Surrounded by Leeds defenders, he turned and tried to create an opening for himself. He moved the ball, eventually, onto his left peg and smashed the ball in.\n\nBOSH.\n\nTalk about drama.\n\nHis euphoria after was matched by all of us in the John Charles Stand.\n\nI took about twenty-five photos of the move, the goal, the celebrations. I was exhausted as he was by the end of it all.\n\nFackinell.\n\nLeeds were still singing at the end, but so were we.\n\n“You’re going down. You’re going down. You’re going down. You’re going down. You’re going down.”\n\nI remember only one Leeds effort on our goal in the entirety of that one-sided second-half, a header that was rising high before it left the bloke’s head. It was a deeply satisfying performance. And yet a little voice in my head kept saying –\n\n“It’s only Leeds, mate.”\n\nFor the first time that I can remember at a domestic game in decades, we were penned in after the match had ended. After twenty minutes we were let out onto the streets of Beeston. On the walk back to the car, there was time for a tasty cheese burger with onions. It rounded off a wonderful night out in West Yorkshire.\n\nI said to PD : “Makes it all worthwhile, nights like this. We travel some miles, we don’t always get the results, or sometimes it’s all a bit flat. This was bloody superb. A great night out.”\n\nIt also meant that I had accomplished a full set of league aways for only the third time in my life.\n\n2008/9 : 19/19.\n\n2015/16 : 19/19.\n\n2021/22 : 19/19.\n\nI eventually reached my home a few minutes after three o’clock.\n\nNext up, the FA Cup Final at Wembley on Saturday.\n\nLeeds United can only dream of such things.\n\n1988\n\n2001\n\n2022\n\nAston Villa vs. Chelsea : 26 December 2021.\n\nWe don’t always play on Boxing Day, but when we do it’s usually at Stamford Bridge. However, for once this was going to be a rare trip to the Midlands for this particular festive fixture and that suited me. Sometimes Boxing Day fixtures at Stamford Bridge, especially the dreaded early kick-offs, can be eerily quiet affairs.\n\nBack when I was younger, attending Boxing Day football was fraught with logistical problems. I didn’t see my first Boxing Day Chelsea game until as late as 1992 when, at last with a car to drive, I made my way up from deepest Somerset to see us play Southampton at home.\n\nSince then, I haven’t attended every Boxing Day game; most but not all.\n\nHowever, the game at Villa Park on Boxing Day 2021 would only be the fourth away game out of twenty Boxing Day fixtures that I would have watched. The league computer certainly favours us to play at Stamford Bridge on this most traditional of footballing days. We missed out on an away game at Arsenal last y"
