        "text": "Welcome to the past\n\nBackground​\n\nThe year is 1995 and great things are happening in football. Louis Van Gaal created a team of home grown wonderkids that could triumph over the richest clubs in the world to claim the biggest footballing prize in Europe.\n\nIn English Premier league Blackburn Rovers becomes only the second team to win the Premier league after beating Manchester United. But 1995/96 season would turn out to be arguably the greatest season for premier league with ferociously focused Manchester United gradually reeled in a buckling longtime leader, as United's class of '92 rose to maturity and Newcastle United's tragic entertainers totally collapsed and blew a 12-point lead to finish four points off the pace.\n\nIt was a great season for soundbites and bizarre moments as well, from Hansen's You can't win anything with kids to Keegan's rant when he gave in to frustration with his infamous I will love it speech. Manchester City attempted to time-waste on the last day when they thought a 2-2 draw with Liverpool would be enough to save them, only to be sent down because Southampton had a better goal difference; while, in April, United had felt the need to change out of their gray kits when 3-0 down to Southampton at half-time and still lost.\n\nThe Draft​\n\nAlright so that's the background against which we start the draft. All of these games would be played on Football manager. I've taken a database and customized it using the attributes from old football manager and championship manager database. The game would be starting on July 1, 2015 and all the players would have their DOB increased by 20 years.\n\nDraft Pool​\n\nFor this draft the clock is set back to July 1, 1995, that is most players who were active at that time are available to draft. They are of the same age as they should be on that date. No player who was not active at that time is available. Although the players do include one drug riddled Argentine at the last stage of his career at Boca and a buck tooth 15 year old prodigy from Gremio.\n\nThe only exception for this is Marco van Basten who in our universe didn't got hit with the career ending injury causing him to actually retire at the end of 95.\n\nSame thing is for managers, all the manager who were active in a management role at that time are available for drafting.\n\nThere might be some players / managers who are not in the database. If I can find them in the older FM versions I can add them otherwise I'll ask you to change your pick.\n\nDrafting method​\n\n1. The first 5 players and a manager would be drafted using the auction method. Every team would be given 200 million dollars and must get 5 players and a manager drafted after the auction round.\n\nAuction round details​\n\nThe minimum bid on a player / manager is 10 million.\n\nIf you want to bid higher on a player, you must increase it by 2 million for every hour passed since the previous bid.\n\nAt any time you shouldn't have more than 200 million in bids, EVEN if you are unlikely to get all those players. If that happens all your bids would be reverted and you'll be docked 10 million.\n\nIf your bid stand for 8 hours you get the player.\n\nSince the leftover money only determines your order in the snake and is useless otherwise there is no use in gaming the system by playing passively and letting everyone make the bids and then take players cheaply. Play with the draft spirit and make a lot of bids.\n\nYou must exactly draft 5 players and a manager from auction round. Once you have drafted five players rest of your bids would be reverted.\n\nAn example of previous auction draft - https://www.redcafe.net/threads/the-all-time-auction-draft.404567/​\n\n2. After that we'll continue to draft 20 more players in normal snake. The order of the snake would be the descending order of money leftover from auction round. For players who have the same amount of money left would be randomized.\n\nGames​\n\nGames would be simulated on Football Manager by me and I'll update how teams are doing at the end of every month. After a season depending upon how the initial auction round went, we might decide to do another auction for 5 players or just let the AI managers decide what transfers to do.\n\nSince its a custom league and everyone plays everyone any number of managers are fine, but we'll see if we can get 16 managers before Monday after which we'll start the drafting process.\n\nGame Database\n\n​\n\nThe database is not strictly based on CM2. Its a combination of CM2 database and other custom databases I found online.\n\nThere would be differences, some wonderkids from CM2 who did not turn out so good would not be wonderkids in this database. And some players who turn out great but not recognized as wonderkids in that version would still be great.\n\nWe have the advantage of hindsight in this database and we'll be using it. The idea is to not take the database part too seriously and play as our normal draft with one change that players are not at their peak.​"
