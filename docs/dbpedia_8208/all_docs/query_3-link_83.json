Lee has been with the club for 22 years, the last seven of which were as the Magpies' managing director. Godfrey's woefully under-hit back-pass was intercepted by Jimenez, leaving him clean through. The finish was cute, delicately lifting the ball over the goalkeeper for his 50th Wolves goal. Lowen's late equaliser for promoted Bochum wasn't enough to prevent the so-called Bayern Munich curse from striking again. Stephen O'Donnell, who struggled throughout, was slow to close down Vladimir Coufal in the second phase following a set play. Arsene was an eye-opener, Hoddle tells GOAL ahead of the launch of a new BT Sport film about his life in football. Perhaps what has been most impressive about the left-sided player is that he has been equally effective in a number of different roles over the past 18 months. An ability to play left, centre or right midfield in an attacking style offers versatility, while his dribbling qualities mean he has the capacity to open up tightly-packed defences. Why new striker is next step in Arsenal rebuild'No More Red' - Arsenal to play in all-white kit in FA CupLatest Arsenal newsArsenal want to keep the 22-year-old striker but their offer of a new contract was rejected by the player. Mohamed Salah has scored 15 of them in a row in the Premier League for Liverpool. That is a record only bettered by the former Southampton penalty expert Matt Le Tissier. Their defensive issues are well documented but they also spurned two glorious chances at the start of the second half. That stagnation shows that players have been aware that they can easily outlast coaches they donât like, even if they shoulder much of the culpability for failure. This persistent problem can now be challenged. Chelsea got past Wolfsburg at the quarter-final stage of the competition last season in a two-legged tie played in Budapest. They have never beaten Wolfsburg in three previous trips to Germany. Brendan Rodgers is not a manager to change his ways and shut up shop, so while he is still in charge, Leicester will remain a team that give away plenty of chances. I was lucky because I met him on Sunday and it was good to speak with him. I saw him with his family and it was good, Conte said. Derby responded six minutes before the break as Bird fired a first-time volley from Paddy McNair's clearing header that managed to squeeze its way through a crowd of bodies and into the bottom left corner to send the travelling support wild. They'll have to sit down and watch all the drama unfold again as they look to analyse the good and the bad from their sides. Rice can pass the ball but frankly even if he couldn't he would be a top player. In that sample, number one and two were Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard. New manager Ralf Rangnick says there are no excuses for his teamâs performance The two centre backs were absolutely atrocious from the first minute to the last. James Milner has been playing Premier League football for almost two decades. âWhen I see him play now, it's like time hasnât moved on; he's like he was 10 years ago.

Mikel Arteta's men currently have bragging rights over Tottenham after beating them 3-1 in the latest North London Derby this season. Rapid Vienna were 2-0 up and cruising at home against Vitesse when they had Filip Stojkovic sent off with twenty five minutes remaining. Lois Openda pulled a goal back for the visitors to give them a better position to fight back from in the second leg. The Italian has been at pains to point out he did not sugar-coat his words about the squad he inherited from predecessors Jose Mourinho and Nuno Espirito Santo when in talks with Levy and managing director Fabio Paratici. Abuse survivors will have advance sight of the review and the club said on Tuesday morning they would receive a copy of it within 24 hours. In the Manchester derby, the work rate of the star names among the opposition was questioned but he manages to fuse high quality with total commitment. However, there are rarely any guarantees in international football. Things change quickly and it's rare that everything falls into place. Cristiano Ronaldo was naively barged over in the box by Rico Henry and referee Chris Kavanagh did not hesitate to point to the spot. Ronaldo coolly tucked his spot-kick into the bottom corner for his 18th league goal of the season. I have been really pleased with the way they have reacted. Team news Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones missed the game after a tight groin in training on Tuesday and will be assessed ahead of Monday's trip to Andorra. Leeds struggled for an outlet throughout and City all-but sealed the points just past the half hour when Kevin De Bruyne marked his first league start since early November with a clinical finish from Rodriâs pass. How the teams lined up | Match statsGet Sky Sports | Get a NOW Day Pass for £9.98 Wales had been hit by a raft of withdrawals ahead of their second visit to Helsinki in the space of 12 months. Derby climb up to 22nd, nine points from safety with four games to play. But no sooner had the second half got under way, the Rams were right back in the game. Jurgen Klopp didn't like the way Liverpool played in their 1-0 defeat to Leicester and said they won't catch Man City if they continue to play in the same manner. It was a long journey to reach England's top table and they deserve to celebrate every victory. Chelsea have drawn three of their last four in the competition. The second half was a drab affair with Leicester comfortably able to neutralise Legia's attacking threat, meaning the Premier League side can now look forward to their next European adventure against Napoli in two weeks time. The 49-year-old was another man heavily linked with Goodison Park before Benitez took the job. He has had two spells with FC Nordsjaelland, sandwiched between time with German club Mainz, before taking the Danish job two years ago. But we must be mentally tough and stick to the plan. Not that Guardiola was in the mood for lavishing praise on his team, quite the opposite in fact. CALCIOMERCATO Serie A champions Inter Milan are monitoring Gabriel Jesus' situation at Manchester City. You can almost get 11/2 with Sky Bet for a home win and 5/2 for the Bees to avoid defeat - it's a real tempter for a team that has only lost one of their last 19 league games across two seasons. The fact that Brentford, if they had the opportunity to pick who to play, would have picked Arsenal over, say, West Ham and Everton just about sums it up. âIt has all kicked off again,â BT Sportâs commentator said. âHow on earth did he get there? Heâs just strolling onto the field?â These young players will be better for another 17 league games and next season instead of being nine out of 10 one week and five out of 10 another, we'll start seeing seven out of 10 and eight out of 10 more regularly. Aaron Wan-Bissaka was woefully out of position - It's absolute madness, said Gary Neville on commentary - allowing Phil Foden to centre for Kevin De Bruyne; his low show was blocked by Shaw, before Gabriel Jesus' rebound on the turn was brilliantly turned over by David de Gea. The winger produced a good performance this evening, and was one of the few players that kept their place in the side from the win over Genoa on the weekend.

That came in 1958, when group-stage draws with Hungary, Mexico and Sweden, then a play-off win over Hungary, earned a quarter-final meeting with eventual winners Brazil."
