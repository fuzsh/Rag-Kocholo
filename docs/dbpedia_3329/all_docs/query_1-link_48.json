        "text": "The Peculiarities of European Colonial Slavery’s Legacy in South Africa and the Formation of Slave ‘Dynasties’ at the Dutch-occupied Cape of Good Hope\n\nby Mansell G. Upham ©\n\nI Introduction\n\n“I am constrained, oh benevolent reader, to receive you to a hastily prepared banquet. Show yourself, I beg you, to be an accommodating and easy guest, and consider these delicacies, such as they eventually are, placed before you as fair and just.“\n\nGysbert Hemmy (1746-1798)[1]\n\nThere are two components that I wish to explore in this presentation:\n\nThe Peculiarities of European Colonial Slavery’s Legacy in South Africa\n\nSlave ‘Dynasties’ at the Dutch-occupied colony of the Cape of Good Hope\n\nII Slavery – now all the rage … Is our Slave history in SA ‘hidden’ or ‘suppressed’?\n\nThat South Africa has a hidden or suppressed slave history is not entirely true. There appear to be more records about slave women and homosexual men than anybody else. That the earliest of the first-mentioned just happen to be mostly ancestors to ‘white’ South Africans is not what our governing transformationists are keen, or even willing, to acknowledge. Much of what is mistakenly thought to be hidden, I have summarized before, as follows:\n\n“The slave and Cape indigenous ancestry of old Cape colonial families mostly derives from maternal ancestry. General amnesia, ignorance, presumption, denial and suppression of slave / indigenous heritage – understandable perhaps – presumably goes hand in glove with inherited patriarchal systems and/or perceived misogyny and the repression of maternal descent (not necessarily without female complicity) by the adoption, acquiescence and entrenchment of the overriding convention of carrying over one`s father`s surname and/or adopting one`s husband`s family name. This might explain our hitherto mostly neglected, forgotten and buried matriarchal heritage …“\n\nEviscerating Van Riebeeck’s Legacy …\n\nAgainst the backdrop of historical and current increased cultural, ethnic and racial polarization and de-rainbowism, we are now currently witnessing the following fragmentation and political re-alignments:\n\n(1) South African ‘Whites’, in reaction to the more recently defined Woke ideology premised on Critical Race Theory and the brazen and intensified attack on the Afrikaans language means that these folks are again pulling back into the laager – this is akin to so-called African-Americans in hostile denial of actual shared White or European heritage;\n\n(2) South African ‘Coloureds’ (never Coloreds) are divided even more than ever before with some now aggressively promoting a segregationist People of Colo(u)r exclusivity or a hardened, if not militant, reification of Blackness …;\n\n(3) The South African ‘Black’ majority has already politically (as well as institutionally) hijacked the term African replacing it with Black while conveniently still retaining all the other apartheid racial labels.\n\nWhat is Van Riebeeck’s real legacy?\n\nThe answer to this question is simply this: his slave women.\n\nIt is these women that become the founders of early slave dynasties at the Cape of Good Hope and who are the subject of this presentation.\n\nIII Methodology and Disambiguation – We speak from facts, not theory versus We speak from theory, not facts\n\nJust like there are many genders – the Buginese traditionally have five[2] – we have different (diverse?) types of historical researchers:\n\n(data-verskrik) genealogists historians\n\ncopy-pasters\n\nhobbyists\n\nfamily historians\n\nantiquarians\n\n‘archival historians’\n\ninstitutionalised historians\n\nheritage acitivists\n\nOf these types of historical researchers, the family historian is hugely constrained ab initio. Salman Rushdie in his Midnight’s Children (1981) succinctly sums up their single-most default:\n\n“Family history, of course, has its proper dietary laws. One is supposed to swallow and digest only the permitted parts of it, the halal portions of the past, drained of their redness, their blood.”\n\nOf all these types of researchers, I am most partial to that of the antiquarian.\n\nSadly, the term antiquarian has not only become antiquated itself but it has come to be associated with aged fuddy-duddy men such as Casaubon in George Eliot’s mammoth novel Middelmarch. Yet, the definition of the word remains as pertinent as ever and relates to the ideal kind of exhaustive empirical research and critical / analytical writing up thereof as history that I believe is being neglected – even abandoned – more and more in our more modern times:\n\nAntiquarian –\n\noften used in a pejorative sense, to refer to an excessively narrow focus on factual historical trivia, to the exclusion of a sense of historical context or process. Very few people today would describe themselves as an “antiquary” although the term “antiquarian bookseller” remains current for dealers in more expensive old books, and some institutions such as the Society of Antiquaries of London (founded 1707) retain their historic names.\n\nan aficionado / student of antiquities or things of the past – more specifically, the term is used for those who study history with particular attention to ancient artifacts, archaeological and historic sites, or historic archives and manuscripts.\n\nantiquarianism = the focussing on the empirical evidence of the past – encapsulated in the motto adopted by 18th-century antiquary Sir Richard Colt Hoare, “We speak from facts, not theory.”\n\nOf the types of historical researchers mentioned above, it is the institutionalised historian – as ideologue incarnate – who is the least credible of the lot. He recalls for me Boniface’s virulent and apt exposure of humbuggery / homboggerij in Cape colonial society[3] and the well-known term ‘all hot air and no substance’. Even now, the invaluable work that genealogists and family historians are doing, is not nearly valued enough by Society in general and the Establishment in particular. The dismal performance (also neglect) by South African historians of VOC history needs especially to be called out here. Nigel Worden’s rationalization [‘New Approaches to VOC History in South Africa’] of what Robert Shell singles out as archival historians – is effectively an exercise in dismissal, denigration and disparagement. It is worth quoting in full:\n\n“… But there was another important characteristic of Afrikaans historical writing on the VOC which limited its broader historiographical influence. Despite differences in subject matter, its approach was overwhelmingly that of empiricism, rooted in Germanic (and Netherlandic) traditions of scholarship in which Afrikaans-language historians were trained.’ 6 Theory and interpretation were eschewed in favour of exhaustive factual recording from primary sources. This is not to decry the latter — indeed the meticulous work of many Afrikaans-language historians has provided a bedrock for later researchers. This tradition continues in more recent key work on the VOC published in Afrikaans, notably that of Dan Sleigh and Karel Schoeman. But the empiricism of such work did not engage with the interests and approaches of historians in the Anglophone world in the 1980s and later, and especially so in South Africa where interpretation and debate had become the essence of historical writing …” [Nigel Worden (2007) ‘New Approaches to VOC History in South Africa’, South African Historical Journal, 59:1, 3-18 (2017)]\n\nIt is not clear at all why the free-rider and locked-in-the-present (presentist?) Anglo approach still assumes a ‘superior’ approach. I recall well, too, how horrified I was when a 1st-year history student, Stellenbosch University ‘white’, Afrikaner, male history professors belittling the pioneering work of Anna Böeseken and Margaret Cairns.\n\nSome Pitfalls\n\nAt this point, permit me to highlight some pitfalls that bedevil historical research in South Africa.\n\nThere is the previously predominant binary nature of South African historiography – very bipolar indeed – but which is now being replaced – by an equally problematic unipolar and Afro(ec)centric ‘Black History’. In short, ‘Blackness’, ‘Black Fragility’, ‘Black Privilege’ and ‘Black Supremacy are now all the rage. Just what is the point of going from one extreme to another? This is surely not the way to ‘restore’ balance. Two wrongs do not make a right. This is for me a quick fix solution inevitably having disastrous consequences.\n\nThe seemingly omnipresence of patriarchal tunnel vision (ironically also often reinforced by women), namely the straight / heterosexual pale male whose pathetically last vestige is his singular automatically inherited name.\n\nThe unrealistic C.C. De Villiers genealogical system in which families are constructed and written up only in terms of male-line only genealogies.[4]\n\nAn American hegemony and post-modernism: history versus relativism. Everything now is being blurred, fudged and conflated – bluf befoeter besef [5], as it were. This induces the indecent haste of what I would term Make up / Catch up / Feel Good History and what is lately reconfigured and termed HIStory / HERstory and ‘lived experience’.\n\nThen, there is the outright (also racist) rejection of ‘white man’s / European history.\n\nThe more recent rise and challenge of microhistory to macrohistory as well as current Big Data manipulation (cf. the latest joint project between Stellenbosch and Lund universities – Johan Fourie and Erik Green – in economic history and wealth production and what could easily result in an ideological exercise in ‘restorative justice’), also need urgent re-appraisal.\n\nColonial, racial and apartheid labels – entrenched and perpetuated – result in a grossly distorted historical reality. An example of this is the racially biased research into the Moravian mission station of Mamre.[6] But not all roads lead to Mamre. This I have pointed out in my own research into the neighbouring Dune folk at Blouberg inhabiting the surrounding farms.[7] The important point here is that both groups are related by blood – studying both groups, separately, perpetuates a distorted historical reality.\n\nAlternative – ostensibly politically ‘corrected’- labels such as Bruin Mense[8], the utterly nonsensical and White Supremacist-re-inforcing People of Colour, and the newly fabricated Cammisa[9], are now being used to ‘restore’ a contentious (real and/or imagined) imbalance by favouring, promoting and perpetuating the separate study of ‘Brown’ (or even more inclusively of ‘Black’) history by way of demonizing, downplaying and marginalizing any previous history expediently deemed to be ‘White’ history and thus irrelevant.\n\nCurrent attempts to sanitize the past – an example being Khoe and slavery and so-called Camissa affirmation and hagiography. The Cape-born slave woman Zwarte Maria Everts (c. 1663-1713)[10], for example, has been subjected to ‘mis/representation’ for over several decades. The way she is represented ideologically, however, has – tellingly – expediently changed over the years and she has already been transmogrified thricely:\n\nas a ‘Black’-woman-with-‘White’-descendants\n\nas a ‘Black’-role-model-for-oppressed-‘Blacks’ that ignores totally her ‘White’ descendants …\n\nand now hopefully – and more truthfully\n\nas a hybrid-ancestor-of-historically ‘Black’/’Brown’-and-‘White’ South Africans …\n\nPolitically contrived, desperate and futile attempts at ‘restoring’ dignity sommer carte blanche – a prime and disconcerting example being that of artist Sue Williams.[11]\n\n“In another extraordinary departure from tradition, local British-born artist Sue Williamson’s state-of-the-art contraption of glass, canvas, water and rope, entitled Memories from the Moat originally exhibited at the 2nd Johannesburg Biennale (1997) is sufficiently in-your-face to challenge any ‘South African’ conscious of her/his slave ancestry. The name of each and every slave purchased and sold at the Cape of Good Hope appearing in the Addendum 2 that originally appeared in Anna Böeseken’s book Slaves and Free Blacks at the Cape 1658-1700, has been engraved on a bottle each, containing also additional information inside. These thousands of bottles, all wet or moist, are either floating and submerged or caught suspended in trawler netting, with water constantly draining through. Bewildered onlookers have the ingenious aid of a Schindler-esque replica of Böeseken’s List in take-away booklet form. Unfortunately, not only has Böeseken’s List been discredited for being substantially inaccurate, the list comprises only those privately owned slaves recorded in terms of Transporten en Schepenkennis procedures and requirements. This means that all the other contemporary slaves that belonged to the VOC (‘the Company’) at the Cape – being the majority of slaves – have been overlooked, ignored: a reconstructed history with a faulty premise.”\n\nLikewise, the new slave memorial slabs in Cape Town’s Church Square consist of slave names copied holus-bolus and arbitrarily from Böeseken’s list and mis-contextualise what has been promoted as an exercise in restoring human dignity but with no regard for any of the actual or real individual identities.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSurely, it is incumbent on historians, researchers and academics in general – irrespective of all the ‘-isms’ to exhaust the records, even if we decide beforehand that these records cannot be accepted uncritically? One thing is very clear – most historians and academics shy away from unearthing new material or doing primary research.\n\nWhy? Invariably:\n\nthey are too lazy – primary research is much too time-consuming and frustrating;\n\nthey omit certain facts – known and new facts do not suit their political agendas;\n\nthey are not competent to access, understand or interpret these records (17th century Dutch, Danish, German etc & 17th century handwriting)\n\ntheir knowledge of the VOC-period is disturbingly shallow;\n\nclichéd and trendy academic constructs are preferred at the expense of trying to establish a larger empirical and scientific understanding.\n\nIV My Modus Operandi\n\nI regard myself as an independent and autonomous scholar-researcher-writer with no public affiliation to any church, academy, organization or institution. I hold that the written record should (be allowed to) speak for itself. I am averse to academic opportunism. In short: if we have to choose between either a top-bottom (prescriptive) versus bottom-top (organic, laissez-faire) approach, I choose the latter.\n\nAn example of what happens with the top-bottom approach, can be seen from the following quote:[12]\n\n“… In those days it was possible to change historical understanding by exploring the evidence. The Marxist explanation of the French revolution —also a matter of great concern to the Communist party, which practically monopolised the relevant professorships in France — was overturned by American and British historians. The orthodoxy was that the revolution was carried out by a rising bourgeoisie overthrowing a feudal aristocracy — a crucial stage in the Marxist historical process. But the ‘Anglo-Saxons’ looked in the archives and found it simply wasn’t so: many revolutionaries were nobles; many of the bourgeois were not rising; and there wasn’t much difference between nobles and bourgeois anyway …”\n\nAnd then we have need to balance the Occidental ‘Big Picture’ with the Oriental devils-in-the-detail approaches. The age-old, ever-applicable, powerful and visceral symbolism of the scales of Justice and ying-yang need not go amiss here.\n\nWorking with ‘clusters’ or family networks and principles such as blood-is-thicker-than-water helps to understand wealth, respectability, social censure and marginalisation.[13] And ultimately a due regard for a Holistic approach – in deference to my great-granny’s 2nd (also 3rd cousin) Oubaas (also Kleinneef) Jannie Smuts.\n\nNot excluding, of course, the inestimable value of microhistory and doing the rounds as advocated by Schiller:[14]\n\n“You have to go the rounds from individual to individual in order to gather the totality of the race.”\n\nIn this way we can abandon and eschew amorphous ancestral veneration and get closer to restoring dignity. If we insist on invoking our ‘lived experience’ – we need to understand that self-affirmation and self-identification are completely incompatible with present-day Identitarian Politics: My racial composition and my position in the world are realities which I alone may determine… I do not expect to be told what I should consider myself to be. When it comes to grappling with the objective / subjective and rational / emotional aspects of historical research, I would suggest we look to our own home-grown Olive Schreiner and her two methods of portraying human life:[15]\n\n“Human life may be painted according to two methods.\n\nThere is the stage method.\n\nAccording to that each character is duly marshalled at first, and ticketed; we know with an immutable certainty that at the right crises each one will reappear and act his part, and, when the curtain falls, all will stand before it bowing. There is a sense of satisfaction in this, and of completeness.\n\nBut there is another method—the method of the life we all lead.\n\nHere nothing can be prophesied. There is a strange coming and going of feet. Men appear, act and re-act upon each other, and pass away. When the crisis comes the man who would fit it does not return. When the curtain falls no one is ready. When the footlights are brightest they are blown out; and what the name of the play is no one knows. If there sits a spectator who knows, he sits so high that the players in the gaslight cannot hear his breathing.\n\nLife may be painted according to either method; but the methods are different. The canons of criticism that bear upon the one cut cruelly upon the other.”\n\nV Peculiarities of Cape slavery\n\nFree yet still in chains …\n\nThe insightful comments concerning ‘assimilation versus apartheid’ by Hans F. Heese serve as a valuable starting point:[16]\n\n“The question why some free-blacks, mestiços and castiços were assimilated into the white community while others were rejected during the 17th century and even later is a challenge for the researcher especially interested in social history. It is clear that rejection or assimilation were not necessarily connected. If inferences can be made on the basis of data from this seminar – which of necessity are openly based on a limited amount of documents and primary sources – it appears that the norm for acceptance in the white society was a lot more complicated than the simplistic Christian/Non-Christian or white/non-white dichotomy which is still generally posited. Evidently the person not born in slavery, had a better chance to be accepted into the economic and social life of whites, irrespective of biological descent. There were indeed many prominent free-burghers during the 17th and 18th centuries who were mestiços while some white castiços still found themselves in a state of slavery. The state of freedom or bondage of a person evidently contributed to his position in society. To equate the problems of identity of the 17th century with the colour problem of the 20th century, the following observation should suffice. It seems that white was sometimes black and black was sometimes white with a large grey area existing between the two poles. This grey area must still be investigated by the historian, anthropologist and political researcher and requires further research in the Netherlands, India, Portugal and Madagascar.”\n\nThe curious ‘disambiguation’ of the concept ‘Freedom’ from a Cape colonial context helps us to unravel the complexities surrounding the degrees of freedom and the degrees of bondage and the not unsimilar dehumanisation inextricably linked to bothzielverkopers and lijfeijgen. And then there is the illusory and captivating term of slave itself :[17]\n\n“These [the men] are themselves the laziest creatures that can be imagined, since their custom is to do nothing, or very little; and this is the life of the truly free Hottentots [Khoekhoe], the owners of the land as they call themselves, regarding us as the greatest slaves in the world with our so exactly fixed and precise way of life. If there is anything to be done, they let their women do it …”\n\nWe continue on that ‘long walk to freedom’ where a vrijbrief – letter of freedom acts as a chimera for subjects, burghers, citizens …\n\nKhoikhoi and slavery\n\nSlavery in South Africa was never ever an exclusively European or ‘white’ malpractice. Krotoa’s sister was a captive of war (Chainouqa / Cochoqua). The Gorachouqua feared enslavement by the Cochoqua and sought Dutch protection:[18]\n\n“… This morning early the chiefs of the Gorachouquas arrived at the Fort, namely, Choro with his brother and 3 of their elders. They were escorted by one of our country guards, and brought with them 6 head of cattle as a present. They requested us to protect them against the Cochoquas or Saldanhars, who had yesterday again cut off their approaches to us and commenced to cause them great inconvenience, forcing them to permit them to search their houses, bags and packs, nominally in order to find tobacco, which they knew they did not possess. They were also already commencing to drive their cattle almost among their own, and suddenly and purposely drove off some last night. They had also been forbidden by them to retire to the Hout Bay or elsewhere, as Oedasoa having used up all the grass round about intended to keep those places for himself alone, without leaving any access to us to anyone. Already they had pitched their camps in such a manner as is their custom when they intend to harass anyone (te benauwen); so that they fear that the blow on their heads will be given them perhaps so soon as this evening or to-morrow, that they will be robbed of everything, and with wives and children made slaves of the Saldanhars.\n\nThey therefore prayed for our assistance & mediation, that this might be prevented, as they would as far as possible in return provide us with sufficient cattle, and that for the present one of the country guards may visit them every morning in order to enable them to call on the Commander daily under his protection. This was allowed them … In consequence these people felt as glad as if they had already been delivered from slavery.\n\nA prisoner-of-war was offered to the Dutch as slave:[19]\n\nThe Soeswaas Captain Claas [Dorha alias Claas / Klaas (c. 1640-1701)] sent to inform us that he had killed 2 Gounema Hottentoos (our and his enemies), and at the same time presented us with a little boy about 10 years old, as a slave for the Company. He had spared him on account of his youth (onschuld), but the child was restored to him as his captive. It seems that these brutal Africans have commiseration for innocent childhood, which, however, is not considered by many Christian Potentates\n\nWhat happened to the Hottentots?\n\nExtinction? Genocide? Ethnocide? Self-effacement? Economically marginalized? Cultural vulnerability and incompatibility? There are no simple answers and attributing colonial animus is equally problematic …:\n\n“To what extent did the VOC and the Dutch accommodate and integrate the aboriginal Khoe / San into colonial society? The converse must also be asked: to what extent did the Khoe / San accommodate and integrate the colonial Dutch into their non-colonial or inter-colonial world? To what extent were the Khoe / San peoples effaced; or put, differently: to what extent did these peoples efface themselves? [Jean O’Brien argues that Native Americans have been rendered invisible because they aided and abetted their paleface invaders thereby constructing the myth of ‘Indian’ extinction [Dispossession by degrees: Indian Land & Identity in Natick, 1650-1790]. Micro-historical and genealogical research and re-evaluation of extant records and recorded individuals – Historians often neglect to identify individually the characters in their drama and to contextualise them as a means of countering questionable generalisations about human behaviour – including women – from the earliest period of regular contact, collision and relations – The reductionist categories are derived from Urs Bitterli, Cultures in Conflict: Encounters Between European and Non-European Cultures, 1492-1800 (translated by Ritchie Robertson, Stanford University Press, Stanford, California 1989)] – help to provide answers to these questions. Unhelpful in this regard are absolute and unsubstantiated statements such as that by Dr Con G. de Wet in his chapter on the social and cultural life of the Cape’s free burgher population: …in die oorspronklike bronne is daar geen [sic] bewyse gevind van gewone sosiale verkeer tussen vryliede en Hottentotte nie” [20]…\n\n“The real Hottentot is extinct, I believe, in the Colony; what one now sees are all ‘Bastaards’, the Dutch name for their own descendants by Hottentot women. These mongrel Hottentots, who do all the work, are an affliction to behold—debased and shrivelled with drink, and drunk all day long; sullen wretched creatures—so unlike the bright Malays and cheery pleasant blacks and browns of Capetown, who never pass you without a kind word and sunny smile or broad African grin, selon their colour and shape of face. I look back fondly to the gracious soft-looking Malagasse woman who used to give me a chair under the big tree near Rathfelders, and a cup of ‘bosjesthée’ (herb tea), and talk so prettily in her soft voice;—it is such a contrast to these poor animals, who glower at one quite unpleasantly. All the hovels I was in at Capetown were very fairly clean, and I went into numbers. They almost all contained a handsome bed, with, at least, eight pillows. If you only look at the door with a friendly glance, you are implored to come in and sit down, and usually offered a ‘coppj’ (cup) of herb tea, which they are quite grateful to one for drinking. I never saw or heard a hint of ‘backsheesh’, nor did I ever give it, on principle and I was always recognised and invited to come again with the greatest eagerness. ‘An indulgence of talk’ from an English ‘Missis’ seemed the height of gratification, and the pride and pleasure of giving hospitality a sufficient reward. But here it is quite different. I suppose the benefits of the emancipation were felt at Capetown sooner than in the country, and the Malay population there furnishes a strong element of sobriety and respectability, which sets an example to the other coloured people. Harvest is now going on, and the so-called Hottentots are earning 2s. 6d. a day, with rations and wine. But all the money goes at the ‘canteen’ in drink, and the poor wretched men and women look wasted and degraded. The children are pretty, and a few of them are half-breed girls, who do very well, unless a white man admires them; and then they think it quite an honour to have a whitey-brown child, which happens at about fifteen, by which age they look full twenty. Lady Duff Gordon, LETTER IV JOURNEY TO CALEDON – Caledon, Dec. 10th. [1864]\n\nAmerican historian Richard Elphick’s cautious multi-causal, open-ended – but constraining much ado about nothing – assessment of our own initial cultural close-encounters-of-a-first-kind in his Khoikhoi and the founding of White South Africa,is worthy of revisionist scrutiny:[21]\n\n“Thus, the leading features of Khoikhoi decline were the complex interconnections of its many causes, and the predominance of broad processes over discrete episodes of diplomacy and conquest. For these reasons Khoikhoi decline was a mystery both to the Europeans who initiated it and to nineteenth-century investigators who vainly sought to explain it by a single cause, be it genocide or plague. For these reasons, too, the story has hardly ever been told in recent times; it has few villains, fewer heroes, and little of the drama that attracts novelists and historians to later phases of settler-native conflict in southern Africa. Yet the process of Khoikhoi decline should be understood, and not only because brown and white South Africans still live with its consequences today. For it is a fact worth pondering that the European subjugation of southern Africa began, not because statesmen or merchants willed it, nor because abstract forces of history made it necessary; but because thousands of ordinary men [sic], white and brown, quietly pursued their goals, unaware of their fateful consequences.”\n\nSlave Master’s Status determines slave’s future place in colonial society\n\nTrajectories of Slaves’ lives invariably diversify depending on the status of their owners:\n\nVOC officials\n\npatrician families\n\nfree-burghers\n\nfree-blacks\n\npolitical exiles [Jonker rebellion, Tambora and Late Muslim arrivals; Lady Duff Gordon & Genadendal]\n\nPeculiarities Specified\n\nSlavery is abolished in Europe (including Netherlands) but resurrected partially after voyages of ‘Discovery’\n\nAsian Caste systems (also Jews and Gypsies in Europe and bestiality), Hindu practice of burning widows alive and Guinean human (female virgin) sacrifices need to be brought into the equation when contextualizing slavery at the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n‘Colonial Slavery’ was a LEGAL institution\n\nKhoe were never formally enslaved – Krotoa as a ‘slave’ (presentist) – in contradistinction to Dutch East India\n\nBaptism of slaves – Synod of Dort\n\ndistinctive from Trans-Atlantic and Arab slavery – plantations / castration / religious conversion / language (cf English in USA and Afrikaans in SA)\n\nEthnic breakdown – Malagasy and Masbiekers eventually outnumber the Asian (Indian, Sri Lankan / Indonesian / Malaysian) slaves – this has implications re the make-up of the ‘Coloured’ communities\n\nClothing restrictions (shoes, hats and luxury items)\n\nMinnamoers­ – fons et origo of the Afrikaans language [?] – unlike US or Canada [?]\n\nNonya & Nyai – ‘rape’\n\nSlave women – even once freed (are made to) take on role of domestic servant-cum-concubine-cum-nursemaid in ‘Cape Dutch’ colonial households. Triple role mirrors position(ing) of njai and nyonya in SE Asia. Terms (derived from Indonesian languages & Portuguese, respectively) become fully integrated in both Cape Dutch dialect Kaaps and what is today institutionalised as Afrikaans as a term of respect for not only white women, but also mixed race women of a higher social standing: nonnie. It has also left us with the more vulgar term naai for ‘fornication’ when debasing human sexual intercourse by equating it with the ‘mating’ of animals.\n\nNjai / njaie / nyai / nyaie / nyahi / nyi = term for women kept as ‘housekeepers’, ‘companions’, and ‘concubines’ in Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) and evidently also at the Cape. Position of njai – always subservient, being the man’s housekeeper and companion, before she is his concubine. In the Javanese and Balinese languages, the word nyai means ‘sister’. In Sundanese the term nyai refers to ‘miss’ or young woman, while in Betawi dialect, nyai refers to ‘grandmother’ or elderly lady. The Great Dictionary of the Indonesian Language of the Language Centre gives three definitions for njai: as a term for referring to a married or unmarried woman, as a term for referring to a woman older than the speaker, and for the concubine of a non-Indonesian. This last definition gains traction in the 17th century when Balinese njais first become common in the colonial capital of Batavia (now Jakarta). The word is sometimes simply translated as ‘mistress’. A variety of other terms are also used to refer to the njai, with varying degrees of positive and negative connotations. In the 19th century the term inlandse huishoudster, or simply huishoudster (‘housekeeper’), is common. The njai are also known as moentji, from the Dutch diminutive mondje, meaning ‘mouth’, and the more negative snaar (‘strings’); both refer to the njai’s verbal / oral propensities. As the njai can also serve as a translator and language teacher, substitute terms such as boek (‘book’) and woordenbooek (‘dictionary’) also abound. Objectification of the njai is found in terms such as meubel (‘furniture’) and inventarisstuk (‘inventory piece’).\n\nNyonya (also spelled nyonyah / nonya) / nonje / nonna / nonnie) = Malay, Indonesian and Cape Dutch / Kaaps / Afrikaans honorifics and (ostensibly diminutive) terms of affection used to refer to a ‘foreign married lady’ – but at the Cape also as term of respect for older women freed from slavery. Loan word, borrowed from old Portuguese word for lady donha / dona (compare, for instance, Macanese creole nhonha spoken on Macau – a Portuguese colony for 464 years). Malays addressed foreign women (and those appearing foreign) as nyonya using that term for Straits-Chinese women as well. It gradually became more exclusively associated with them. In Penang Hokkien, it is pronounced nō͘-niâ (in Pe̍h-ōe-jī), and sometimes written with the phonetic loan characters 娘惹.\n\nplight of male slaves\n\nconcubinage / marriage [Jannetje Bort versus Kaet; (Jan Groff; Maria da Costa & Maaij Ansela & Catharina van Malabar]\n\n1660: Barent Waendersz: van Varich / Varick\n\n… vryman alhier aan gemelte Caap … Heeft yemant van u volck met de slavinnen te doen gehadt, ende met kint gemaeckt? … segt het vrij, daer is niet aengelegen, het is ten dienste van de Compagnie.\n\n“Declaration of Arent Gerritsz: van der Elburgh, sailor, and Adriaan Bastiaansz: Peereboom, marine, made at the request of Barend Waendersz:, of Varick, freeman here, that Theunis Frederiksz:, of Weserysen, sailor, had publicly said, whilst standing before the gate of the horn works, that the Commander Jan van Riebeeck had come to the Bosheuvel and said to Barend Waendersz:, who lives there: “Has any of your men had anything to do with the female slaves and fructified them?” and that Barend answered, “No, sir.” That Riebeeck replied: “Barend, did you have anything to do in the matter?

Grof’s earlier brief encounter, liaison or concubinage (… het schandelyke crime van fornicatie ofte hoerendom) with the commander’s private slave woman appears not to blemish his standing in Cape colonial society – on the contrary, it may have enhanced it. However, his later unashamed, indiscrete, defiant and public long‐term but illegal concubinage with his own slave appears to have had the opposite effect on him, his slave and her offspring.

An Angolan waif (aged 6) forcefully enslaved by fellow Black Africans, she is removed across the Atlantic Ocean by their Portuguese clients from her African homeland, and again taken (1658) – this time by the Dutch as prize off the Brazilian coast of Bahia – and returned across the Atlantic Ocean on the ship Amersfoort to Africa – but further south – and dumped at the Cape of Good Hope. Sold by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), she becomes a private slave in the household of the colony’s 1st commander, Jan van Riebeeck. Thereafter she is sold to the colony’s secunde, the bachelor Roelof de Man; again resold to the Company; sold again as a private slave to the married Lieutenant Abraham Schut; and thereafter to the colony’s 4th commander, the unmarried Jacob Borghorst; before being again sold back to the Company. Taken across the Indian Ocean as a Company slave on loan to Indonesia (1689) in attendance to a senior VOC official’s wife, she returns from Batavia across the Indian Ocean to the Cape to claim her freedom promised her. She is accordingly manumitted but soon re-employed as the free-midwife (frij froemoeder) to the Company’s Slave Lodge. She has several children – mostly fathered by prominent European officials and/or free-burghers. At least one of her granddaughters, occupies the pivotal position of school mistress (school matres in s’ Comp[agnie]s Slaven Quartier) in the Company Slave Lodge (in 1685 & 1689 respectively).

The lesser-known aspects of conquest, indigeneity, colonization and decolonization – often contradicting newly imposed Political (mis)Correctness and likely again to be silenced – has induced a situation whereby a great many – if not most – South Africans classified ‘White’ and ‘Cape Coloured’ under apartheid happen to actually be direct descendants of both indigenous African and Africasian slave women. Many descendants end up, not only as ‘colonisers’, colonial officials and slave owners in their own right, but also as founders of nomadic mixed race clans such as the Griqua, Koranna, Nama, Oorlam, and the Buys, Cloete, Van Wyk, and Rehoboth Basters …\n\nDenial or Affirmation?

That many of her immediate offspring do not succeed in obtaining their freedom likely influences her astounding retreat into the Slave Lodge where she continues to ‘slave’ away as a δούλη (doula) and presumably help purchase the freedom of at least some of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. At least one granddaughter, occupies (1689) the pivotal position of school mistress (school matres in s’ Comp[agnie]s Slaven Quartier) in the Company Slave Lodge. Those of her enslaved grandchildren fortunate enough to be freed, end up amongst the colony’s free population. Claesje dies (December 1732) – still in the Slave Lodge at the ripe old age of 80 – having lived at the Cape of Good Hope (and briefly in Batavia) for 74 years.\n\nInterception and Capture\n\nCLAESJE VAN ANGOLA arrives at the Cape of Good Hope as part of the group of slaves from Angola being a Portuguese prize (neger prijs – literally ‘negro prize’) captured (23 January 1658) at sea off the South American coast by the Dutch East Indiaman the Amersfoort. The ship has a cargo of approximately 500 slaves still surviving the voyage from Luanda. The ship’s name the Dutch leave unrecorded. The skipper they report to be one Emanuel Francisco Poort (from Lisbon).\n\nBound for Brazil, the ship had been heading for Bahia Todos los Sanctos [Salvador]. According to Dutch accounts, the ship was in trouble with masts broken, leaking and top heavy. Is the slaver damaged by the Dutch in their pursuit to capture the slaver? Since the ship is in no condition to sail or be escorted, it is decided to relieve the slaver of some of its cargo and to abandon the ship. The slaver is left with six days supply of food and five or six pijpen[2] water. The fate of the slaver and its remaining cargo is unknown. The Dutch single out 250 of the best (also youngest) slaves – mostly children and ship them to the Cape on the Amersfoort.\n\nThe Amersfoort, captained by Frederik Eldense, leaves the Netherlands (14 October 1657) with a crew of 337 men. Of the crew, 31 die before reaching the Cape. The voyage is most eventful. Besides the Portuguese prize, the ship’s cook Thomas Peulman commits sodomy (a capital crime) with some of the ship’s boys, one of the crew falls overboard in a drunken state and then there is the discovery of a pregnant woman disguised as a sailor. She subsequently gives birth to a baby girl during the voyage. The baby dies, however, six weeks later.\n\nThe slaves (negers) thrown overboard during the voyage to the Cape – dead and those considered to be moribund – amount to 76 individuals. Do any of these take their own lives by jumping overboard? The list whereby these discarded dead or dying slaves are recorded on a daily basis has been located and transcribed.[3]\n\n‘Angolan’ Background\n\nThe Portuguese obtain their slaves in Angola from the two dominant Mbundu kingdoms of Kasanje and Matamba – the latter being ruled by Queen N’zinga who collaborates with the Dutch against the Kasanje in their conflict (1641–1648) against the Portuguese. During this time Imbangala war-bands – indigenous mercenaries of the Portuguese – operate in Mbundu, making war, plundering other inland tribes and capturing slaves. Later the Kasanje also side with the Portuguese and after 1640 become the chief supplier of slaves. The slaves are marched from the interior, westward to the port of Luanda. After 1650 there is an annual export of 4000 to 5000 slaves per year from Kasanje.[4]\n\nThe Amersfoort arrives at the Cape (28 March 1658) with only 174 survivors.[5] There is a slave roll-call on land (17 April 1658). The slaves are named, clothed, fed and schooling provided.[6] The Cape’s 1st commander, Jan van Riebeeck (from Culemborg), confirms that his brother-in-law, Pieter van der Stael (from Rotterdam), superintendent of the hospital and sick-comforter, had in addition instructs the Company’s slaves and the Hottentots in the Dutch language and the Christian language “and with some success”.[7] These arrangements only really kick in once the bulk of the slave cargo – the healthiest of the slaves – are shipped off to Batavia with the weakest remaining at the tip of Africa.\n\nVan Riebeeck is instructed to send the best of these ‘Angola’ and ‘Guinea’ slaves to Batavia. Although the majority of the ‘Angola’ slaves arrive ill and dying daily in the Company’s hopelessly ill-equipped and undersized hospital, Van Riebeeck complies: 16 ‘Angola’ slaves are sent on the Amersfoort, 16 on the Amsterdam, and 8 on the Sparrow. Reporting to his superiors, Van Riebeeck writes:[8]\n\n“The best had died. Of the survivors (many of whom are still dying daily) most are girls and boys, from whom just yet very little service will be obtainable, but in three or four years time they will be very fit.”\n\nThe numbers of the remaining 125 ‘Angola’ slaves dwindle, however. Nevertheless, 38 men and 37 women are immediately put to work. A further 52 of the healthier slaves were shipped away: 30 on the Dordrecht and 22 on the Hasselt.[9] Thus 92 of the best ‘Angola’ slaves are shipped from the Cape destined to labour and possibly leave their roots elsewhere. There are now only 82 ‘Angola’ slaves remaining. The officials and free-burghers purchase no less than 24 ‘Angola’ slaves.[10] Only 19 ‘Angola’ slaves (3 men and 16 women) can be utilized by the Company. The rest are too old, infirm or young. The mortality rate among the ‘Angola’ slaves is high: 32 slaves die already in the first year since their arrival and 7 abscond into the interior. On 2 June 1658 an ‘Angola’ slave working in the forest ran away. Another 2 working in the grainfields, 2 employed at the Fort and 2 women follow suit after midnight.[11] Described as men from the highlands and cannibals by fellow slaves, these 7 slaves are never retrieved.[12] In 1663 there were only 5 men and 12 women left from ‘Angola’ belonging to the Company.\n\nA school for slaves\n\nArrangements are started for establishing a school for the Company’s male and female slaves brought here from Angola by the Amersfoort, which had taken them off a prize Portuguese slaver. Pieter van der Stael is entrusted with the task of giving them instruction in the morning and afternoon, besides his duties of visiting the sick, particularly because he reads Dutch well and correctly:\n\nTo encourage the slaves to attend and to hear and learn the Christian prayers, it is ordered that after school everyone is to receive a small glass of brandy and two inches of tobacco. All their names are to be written down and those who have none, are to be given names, paired or unpaired, young or old. All this is to be done in the presence of the Commander, who will attend for a few days to put everything in proper order and subject these people to proper discipline, signs of which are already apparent. All the slaves are to be properly clothed to protect them against the daily increasing cold. The strongest have been put to work so that they may as soon as possible be of service to the settlement. [13]\n\nSlave to Commander Jan van Riebeeck\n\nClaesje is 1st mentioned as such in the records (20 April 1662), but presumably she features earlier as the slave woman recorded as Marselij (coupled with the slave Mathijs) mentioned in the attestation (1659) listing Van Riebeeck’s personal slaves. This name may well be a transcription error as it is not found again in the records. Van Riebeeck sells her (20 April 1662) to the secunde Roelof de Man (from Rotterdam) together with the‘Angola’ slaves Domingo, Jan Meeuw and Thomas/so Keuken. Her fellow slaves in the Van Riebeeck household are numerous – 26 in number (including a female convict serving as washerwoman).\n\nInitially, Van Riebeeck’s household includes two baptized ‘Abyssinian’ [‘Ethiopian’] or ‘Arab’ slave girls – Cornelia Arabus aka Koddo (born c. 1647) and Lijsbeth Arabus aka Sabba (born c. 1649) – who are gifts to Van Riebeeck’s wife Maria de Queillerie from the French admiral, Gilles de la Roche-St.-André (1621-1668) on La Maréchale, who visits (1657) the Cape with his battered fleet. Together with them comes the Malagasy slave Cleijn Eva who is also a gift (1654) – but from the ‘king’ of Antongil – presented to Amsterdam-born secunde Frederik Verburgh (c. 1627-1659) for Van Riebeeck’s wife. These three slaves become Company slaves in compliance with the instructions of Commissioner Rijckloff van Goens Sr. (1619-1682) that such gifts are illegal. The Arab girls are loaned to Meijntjen Campen (from Amersfoort), the widow of Frederik Verburgh and to the sick-comforter Pieter van der Stael and his wife who is the commander’s sister, Geertruijd van Riebeeck. Cleijn Eva later has the singular task of sweeping the mud Fort.\n\nThen there were the ‘Guinea’ slaves Oude Hans and Jajenne / Gegeima aka Lobbetje, Houwij / Hoen/a aka Anna and Dirk; the ‘Angola’ slaves Mathijs[14]; Domingo and Francina (Francijn); Ouwe Jan and Maaij Isabella; Thomas/so Keuken and Marij; Claes Kelder and Marij Pekenijn and the ‘Bengal’ slaves Maaij Ans(i)ela (dies 1720) [15] Maria (Marij) da Costa (dies 1713?), Dominga and the ‘Madagascar’ (from Antongil) slave Meijndert. In the household there is also the Indian convict woman from Pulicat, Groote Catrijn (c. 1631 – c. 1683). Banished to the Cape for life as a Company slave, she is seconded to the commander’s household to do washing, having arrived at the Cape (21 February 1657) on the Prins Willem.[16] The impetuous indigene, the Goringhaicona girl, Krotoa called (and also later baptized) Eva by the Dutch – later Eva Meerhoff (c. 1643-1674) – also lives at the Fort with the Van Riebeeck family. However, she comes and goes as she pleases whenever there is a crisis amongst her people.\n\nClaesje’s mistress is Maria de la Queillerie (from Rotterdam) who arrives at the Cape (6 April 1652) with her husband, Jan van Riebeeck, and son Lambertus van Riebeeck (1651-1678). She gives birth to five more children while at the Cape Abraham (born 1653), Anthonij (1655-1656), Maria (1657-1688), Elisabeth (born 1659) and Johanna (1662-1665).\n\nVan Riebeeck purchases (1 April 1659) the ‘Guinea’ slave Evert from the free-burgher Casper Brinkman (from Vreeckenhorst). Van Riebeeck is informed (1 February 1659) that his ‘Guinea’ slave at Bosheuvel had run away during the night (To-day the Commander received news that one of his Guinea slaves on his farm had run away last night). Is this Dirk? Is he the same slave who previously runs away (1658), but is recaptured? Use is made (21 May 1659) of the more loyal slaves to help retrieve runaway slaves who had fled into the interior.[17]\n\n… and some slaves, for whom assagays, according their instructions, are making after the fashion of their own country, which they can manage better than the Hottentots; orders are also given to take care that the slaves’ wives are kept here, to prevent the men from staying away … as they seem much attached to their wives and will not easily part from them.\n\nThe situation worsens, however, and the Company Journal informs us (18 August 1659) that the ‘Guinea’ slaves are again becoming a problem:\n\n“Not only have the Guinea slaves been stubborn and recalcitrant, but it now appears that they intended and resolved to escape as a group and to join the Hottentots, so all the male slaves have been promptly clamped into chains once more. This has been so as to prevent such a loss to the Company, for should these sturdy and audacious people link up with our enemies, they would be able to cause more mischief and damage than a hundred times as many Hottentots. Moreover, they would give the Hottentots too much instruction in warfare, since some of them were in Guinea at the time of the European war there.”\n\nWe are informed further (22 August 1659):\n\n“To-day the two Guinea slaves belonging to Herman Remanjen were recaptured at the lower end of the Bos river, which flows out of the Company’s forest. This spot had been their rendezvous and there they had erected a convenient shelter and had already prepared for the rest of the Company’s and all the free burghers’ slaves to follow them. But, praise be to God, this was prevented in time last Monday, and all the slaves were again cast into chains, with the exception of the one, who had brought back his companion. He was therefore allowed to remain free and placed in charge of his countrymen, the Company’s Guinea slaves, of whom he is one.”\n\nVan Riebeeck frees Evert for collaboration (22 August 1659). He quickly exchanges (18 September 1659) two other ‘Guinea’ slaves – before they, too, might attempt absconding. They are Oude Hans and Lobbetje whom he exchanges with Thomas Christoffel Müller (from Leipzig) and his partner for the ‘Angola’ slaves Jan Meeuw and Jacqje Joij. Sometime after, he exchanges (18 September 1659) with the Company his troublesome ‘Guinea’ slave Dirk for the ‘Angola’ slave Christina. The free-burgher Brinkman sells (4 September 1660) his female ‘Guinea’ slave, Maria, to the commander’s wife, Maria de la Queillerie.\n\nZacharias Wagener succeeds Van Riebeeck as commander\n\nThe Van Riebeeck family sails to Batavia (6 May 1662) on the Mars. Before Van Riebeeck’s transfer to the East, he sells some (but not all) of his slaves. The following ‘Angola’ slaves, he sells to the secunde Roelof de Man (from Culemborg) Domingo, Jan Meeuw, Thomas Keuken, Jacqje Joij and Claesje. He sells (19 April 1662) to Abraham Gabbema (from‘s Gravenhage), who succeeds De Man (dies 6 March 1663) as 2nd-in-command (secunde) of the Cape Maaij Ansela van Bengale. He also sells two more of his ‘Angola’ slaves to free-burghers: Christina is bought (22 April 1662) by Gabbema’s brother-in-law, Elbert Dircksz: Diemer (from Emmerich, Duchy of Cleves), and Maaij Isabella is purchased (22 April 1662) by Hendrik Hendricks: (from Sürwürden, Duchy of Oldenborg). The seconded convict Groote Catrijn, however, remains as washerwoman to him and successive commanders.[18]\n\nA seasoned VOC official nicknamed Der Donnerman while superintendent at Dejima, the artificial island off Nagasaki in Japan, Wagenaer comes to the Cape with his wife and stepdaughter from Batavia with their own retinue of five Asian slaves. Unlike other officials, who invariably arrive, slave-less, at the Cape from the Netherlands, officials from Batavia are able to bring slaves with them from the East. Although private trading is illegal, it is a lucrative practice for officials to bring (usually with permission) personal slaves and sell them at the Cape before returning to the Netherlands. Slaves are forbidden to be taken to the Netherlands. When permission is indeed obtained in exceptional circumstances, these slaves are deemed to be freed persons on arrival there. Wagener’s and his step-daughter Widow Verburgh’s other slaves are: Catharina (Catrijn) van Malabar (born c. 1639); Elisabeth (Lijsbeth) van Bengale; Susanna van Bengale (sold to the free-women, Hilletje Redoux[19]); Helena van Bengale; Maria van Bali[20]; Matthijs van Coromandel[21]; Paulo van Malabar; Annica van Bengale (dies 1673); Jantje van Bengale; Louis van Bengale; Willem van Bengale; and Anthonij van Japan (baptized in Batavia).\n\nWhat happens to the remainder of Van Riebeeck’s slaves?\n\nIt is unlikely that they accompany him to Batavia. Better prices can be obtained at the Cape and the Company would be unwilling to pay for their passage. These appear to be sold to the Company or into private hands or later when Van Riebeeck’s farms Uijtwijk and Bosheuvel and other property are auctioned on his behalf (as late as 28 November 1665) once he has already departed. These slave sales are not reflected in the Transport en Schepenkennis records.\n\nFrancina (Francijn) van Angola appears to revert to the Company as a Company slave of that name appears later in the baptismal register. Maria van Angola, later appearing as a free person at Stellenbosch and is likely freed by the Cape-born free-burgher Jan Stevensz: Botma, may well be the Maria Pekenijn who once belonged to Van Riebeeck. Claes Kelder appears to be sold (27 November 1665) – together with Anna van Guinea by Jochum Cornelisz: Blanck / Blancq (from Lübeck) – dispensier and keeper of the Fort’s paybooks – presumably on behalf of Van Riebeeck and the Company – to his stepson-in-law, the free-burgher Elbert Dircx: Diemer (from Emmerich), both of whom again appear to be resold to the free-burgher and former Company gardener Hendrick Hendricksz: Boom (from Amsterdam). The fate of his remaining ‘Angola’ slave Ouwe Jan is unknown. His ‘Guinea’ slaves: Anna van Guinea and Maria van Guinea later appear as private slaves; the former becoming the property of the free-burgher Jochum Cornelisz: Blanck, resold to Elbert Dircx: Diemer and then again resold to Hendrik Boom (from Overtoom, near Amsterdam) and the latter belonging to the official, Johannes Prætorius (from Ouddorp, near Goeree on Overflakke island). His ‘Malagascar’ slave Meijndert probably reverts to the Company. His ‘Bengal’ slave Maria (Marij) is later sold – with Serrij [? Abraham (Abram) van Guinea] and Elisabeth (Lijsbeth) van Bengale – to the Rev. (Johannes) Petrus Wachtendorp[22] (from Maasbommel), whose widow Maria Prignon sells her to Commander Jacob Borghorst and who, in turn, resells her to the Company. The fate of his other ‘Bengal’ female slave Dominga is unknown:\n\nVan Riebeeck is legally entitled to sell the children of his personal slaves, but only their unbaptized heelslag children. These he sells. He sells (as early as 25 August 1661) the infant of his ‘Guinea’ slave Anna, fathered by his troublesome slave Dirk. The child is named Jan Dircksz: (born 1661) and sold to the secunde Abraham Gabbema. Soon thereafter, he sells (28 September 1661) – also to Gabbema – the infant Marij (born 1661), daughter of his ‘Angola’ slave Christina. The father is the ‘Guinea’ slave Deuxsous.\n\nIt is the general custom to baptize halfslag children in their infancy. Once baptized, they cannot be resold. It is illegal to re-sell any baptized slave (adult or child), whether halfslag or heelslag. These slaves cease to have any economic value. This discourages private owners from baptizing their slave folk. In theory, unbaptised halfslag children can still, however, be legally alienated. This may well have happened in the case of darker complexioned children, but such transactions would have been frowned upon and even denied registration. All slaves had to be registered with the authorities as ‘fixed’ or ‘immovable’ property. Thus the baptized halfslag slaves of private owners – who die or are emigrating and unwilling or unable to free them – automatically revert to the Company until they attain legal majority. Company policy on slave children is different, however. Both halfslag and heelslag slaves born in the Lodge are all baptized. This does not mean, however that every child in the Lodge would have been baptized. Some children come to the Lodge after infancy. Their lack of baptism is generally rectified with later adult baptism together with heelslag slaves wanting to become Christians, but only, it seems, made compulsory in the case of slaves whose halfslag status is not in question – and only once visiting VOC commissioners (1671 and 1685), when inspecting the Lodge, are appalled to still find unbaptised halfslag slaves.\n\nSlave to Secunde Roeloff de Man\n\nClaesje’s new owner, the unmarried Roeloff de Man (from Culemborg), dies, however, prematurely (6 March 1663). He had been second-in-command (secunde) at the Cape (from 1658 until his death). She is sold from the deceased estate (27 March 1663) as one of the drie Angoolse slaven en [een] slavinnen. The three slaves are Domingo, Jan Meeu and Jacqje Joij. The last-mentioned slave is sold to Hendrik Hendricksz: (from Sürwürden, Duchy of Oldenborg), better known as Hendrik Snijer, and reunited with the ‘Angola’ woman Maaij Isabella, while Jan Meeu and Domingo become the property of De Man’s successor, Abraham Gabbema (thus reunited with Maaij Ansela), who later sells them to Gabbema’s brother-in-law, Elbert Diemer, thus reuniting them with the ‘Angola’ slave woman Christina. The fate of Thomas Keuken is unknown. Are he and Claesje both taken up temporarily into the Company but sold later (1665) in the public auction together with Van Riebeeck’s remnant slaves?\n\nSlave to Lieutenant Abraham Schut\n\nClaesje may well be the slave Pollecij that later belongs to the official Abraham Schut who only arrives at the Cape two years later (1665). The name Pollecij appears to be a transcription error for Claesje. By this time, Claesje is already mother to a Company halfslag Willem (baptized 25 October 1665).[23]\n\nAbraham Schut, is a military man with the rank of lieutenant in the garrison of the Casteel de Goede Hoop. He had arrived (1665) at the Cape with his wife, Johanna Lijkburgh / Luijtenborgh on the ship Casteel van Medenblicq. They baptize two daughters Margareta[24] and Catalina[25] at the Cape. With Claesje in the Schut household is the ‘Ceylon’ slave Ventura. During this time Claesje baptizes a daughter. The child is the halfslag Elisabeth (Lijsbeth) who is baptized (14 August 1667).[26]\n\nThe Schut family’s stay at the Cape is short-lived, ending (1668) after he loses his seat on the Council as Policy for slandering (1 August 1668) Maria Prignon, the widow of the late minister (Johannes) Petrus Wachtendorp.[27] Lieutenant Schut is expelled from the Council for passing a deed of reclamation to the widow of the late Rev. Wachtendorp for libellous words uttered by him behind her back, and to her injury. The Council is of the opinion that it “should keep itself free from obloquy, and unpolluted”. The family sails to Ceylon after selling Ventura and Claesje and her unnamed [heelslag] child to the commander, Jacob Borghorst. Ventura fetches the price of f 277:10; while Claesje, with her (presumably heelslag) child, cost f 225.\n\nSlave to Jacob Borghorst\n\nBorghorst had been administrateur (1660) in Colombo on Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka). Thereafter, he departs (September 1664) from Ceylon via Coromandel on the flute Diemermeer after being in Colombo for four years. He had already stopped over at the Cape (1 March 1665-22 April 1665) en route from the Indies to the Netherlands. While returning to the Netherlands in the Return Fleet of Pieter de Bitter, his entire fortune, consisting of precious stones, is seized by the English who take his ship. He departs (16 June 1668) arriving at the Cape on the Het Hoff van Breda (left Texel 27 December 1667) becoming commander at the Cape (18 June 1668) succeeding Cornelis van Quaelbergen.\n\nIn the wifeless commander’s household, Claesje and Ventura join up with other slaves. These had been obtained from Borghorst’s disgraced predecessor, Cornelis van Quaelbergen and his 2nd wife, Judith van den Bogaerde: the ‘Bengal’ / ‘Coromandel Coast’ slaves: de meijt Catharina (Catrijn) (born c. 1639),ex-slave of Zacharias Wagener’s stepdaughter, Claes Gerritsz: van Bengale, Mathijs[28], Anthonij Jansz: van Bengale, Andries van Bengale and Jeronimus Titus (Tita) van Bengale and a Malay (een Maleijer) Barru / Baddou.\n\nBorghorst also purchases Serrij[29], Lijsbet van Bengale(with her two children) and Marija da Costa van Bengale for f 660 from Maria Prignon, the widow of the Rev. Petrus Wachtendorp, who leave the Cape (11 August 1668) on the ship Polsbroeck. The former is the slave Elisabeth (Lijsbeth) van Bengale (born c. 1643)[30], once acquired by the Cape’s 2nd commander Zacharias Wagener. The latter is Van Riebeeck’s former slave Maria van Bengale who had been in the 1st commander’s household.\n\nAs commander at the Cape, Borghorst is immensely unpopular, and purportedly sickly and generally indisposed. He is installed (18 June 1668). The resolutions by the Council of Policy reveal a skeleton staff of sorts when contrasted with the membership and attendance of councils chaired by his predecessors and successors. Rev. François Valentijn writes later of Borghorst’s unpopularity:[31]\n\n“The Heeren Wagenaar and van Quaalbergen had indeed left good instructions and set good examples to Heer Borchorst as regards the artisans; but on his own authority, and without the knowledge of the Council he had so altered these, that he made them work by day and stand at night, by which he had made himself so hated by them that scarce any wished to remain here longer, and also during his rule he had caused very great discontent among the civil population, so that it was full time for him to depart.”\n\nEven the local aborigines dislike Borghorst intensely. This is confirmed by the visiting VOC official Arnout van Overbeke.[32] Calling Borghorst “the only monster” that he could find at the Cape, Van Overbeke states further:\n\n“All his quarrelsomeness came from the fact that Quaelbergen was still so beloved that no one was very willing to have anything to do with him. Even the Hottentots, who each year give a free-will present to the Commandeur, were fed up with him: “What sort of a Captain is that?” they said, “always Sieckum!” (that is to say sick, bad, grumpy, ugly – everything that is no good is sieckum, thus bad tobacco is “sieckum Tabak,” etc.); and that made our friend mad. He wants to get by force what in reality can be had only by affection. For that matter, he punishes himself every evening with a few glasses of spirits which one of those in his confidence brings him under cover.”\n\nHe is relieved (25 March 1670) as commander at the Cape.[33] He soon returns (1671) to the Cape, however, as VOC commissioner. Borghorst sells (9 April 1669) his slave Catrijn van Malabar to the non-resident VOC official Rijckloff van Goens Jr., but it is the Cape-resident official Joannes Coon (from Sommelsdijk) who pays for her.[34] Before leaving the Cape, Borghorst sells (31 December 1669) all his other slaves, including Claesje and Ventura, to the Company at cost price for the lump sum of f 2 842:10:-. As a Company slave, but now chef to Commander Simon van der Stel, Ventura (his name is incorrectly recorded as Pintura) petitions (26 June 1686) for his freedom with another slave or convict Jan Figoredo. He appears in the muster roll (1692).[35] Ventura has two illegitimate children, one Joost Ventura[36] by the Company slave Helena van Malabar and Jacob van Hoff[37] by the Cape-born Eurasian halfslag Margaretha (Griet) Jans: Visser.\n\nCompany slave\n\nOn 2 February 1670, now a Company slave – and together with her children in the Lodge – Claesje baptizes three halfslag daughters Sara (15 July 1671) [38]; Jannetje (27 October 1675)[39] and Magdalena (15 August 1677)[40] who later goes by the name of Magdalena Smid(s:) – her biological father has not been positively identified – and she is listed (1691) as a mesties Company slave with Lt. Rheede who later marries (1698) Christina Does, the widow of Elbert Dircksz: Diemer. Magdalena Smids: has the following children:\n\n(1) Christina (Christijn) mesties baptized 1696[41] who later becomes matres at the Company’s Slave Lodge; manumitted (1743) with daughter Christijn[42]\n\n(2) Johanna Barbara casties baptized 1699[43]\n\n(3) Johannes (Jan) casties baptized 1703[44]\n\n(4) Maria baptized 1707[45]\n\n(5) Roelof(f) baptized 1709[46]; listed 1714; manumitted 7 August 1749[47]\n\n(6) Jonas baptized 1712[48].\n\nClaesje as a mother of several children now fills the very serviceable position of midwife in the Company Slave Lodge. Not surprisingly, perhaps, Claesje is singled out (1689) to accompany Geertruyd Chastelijn the pregnant wife of the high-ranking VOC official (fiscal-elect to Surat), Pieter van Helsdingen, to Batavia:[49]\n\nThe memorial of the Hon. Pieter van Helsdingen, designated fiscal in the service of the Hon. Company to Surat, on ship ‘t Wapen van Alkmaar now anchored in the roads, respectfully placed before the Council, containing the request to take out of the Company’s Slave Lodge the slave woman named Claasje as midwife along to Batavia to be of service to his pregnant wife. It is thereby unanimously decided to approve the suppliant’s request for the afore-mentioned slave woman to serve him provided that he pay into the Company’s treasury at Batavia the cost and freight by way of taxation to the Supreme Government of India for the passage to and fro and that he indemnify the Hon. Company for any damages that may be incurred should the oft-mentioned slave woman Claasje come to die before her return or abscond.”\n\nVan Helsdingen is previously the ordinary fiscal of Malacca (present-day Melaka in Malaysia). He returns (June 1686) to Patria after being appointed fiskaal independent of Surat. The slave woman Flora van Timor, is left (18 June 1686) at the Cape as a free person by Pieter van Helsdingen on condition that if he or one of his family should call at the Cape on their way back to Batavia, the slave is to return to his service. Van Helsdingen returns (1689) to the East. He is removed (1696) from office because of his irreverent and improper writings (over zijn irreverente en onbetamelijk schrijven) and ordered to leave via Ceylon.[50]\n\nBorn of a notable merchant family, Geertruyd Chastelijn[51] is the daughter of Anthony / Antoine Chastelein (1613-1664) and Maria Cruydenier. Her father arrives in Netherlands from France as a Huguenot, and joins the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Her mother is the daughter of the mayor of Dordrecht who serves in the Dutch West India Company. Her brother, the youngest member of a family of eight children, is the famous Amsterdam-born philanthropist and proto-slave abolitionist Cornelis Chastelijn (1657-1714) [52] who marries Catharina van Quaelbergen whose father Cornelis van Quaelbergen had been the Cape of Good Hope’s 3rd VOC commander and whose step-mother is his paternal aunt Henriette Chastelijn.\n\nAged 17, Cornelis Chastelijn boards (24 January 1675) the ship ’t Huis te Cleeff and arrives at Batavia (16 August 1675) and works as an accountant in service of the Company and then as senior shopkeeper (groot-winkelier) in the Grooten Winkel te Batavia (1683). By 1691, he is also 2nd opperman of the Batavia Castle. In that same year, he is discharged at his request owing to increasing ill health. The appointment of Joan van Hoorn as Director-General may have been the reason for this resignation request, it being well- known that he and Van Hoorn do not get on very well.\n\nHe subsequently acquires (1691-1704) the estate to the south of Batavia known as Siringsing – now Serengseng Sawah, South Jakarta – in 1695, at pole 17 (about 25 km from Batavia), middle of the Batavia-Buitenzorg route. He also buys (18 May 1696) a plot of land with an area of 12.44 square kilometers, at pole 21 (about 32 km from Batavia), between Ciliwung and Pesanggrahan river where he establishes a Protestant congregation consisting of native Indonesians named De Eerste Protestante Organisatie van Christenen (DEPOC) – the 1st of its kind in Java. It is at this time that he also sells two slaves at the Cape of God Hope.[53] He then buys (1704) Weltevreden establishing the 1st experimental coffee plantation in the Indies, as well as the 1st Indies zoo. At Depok he creates a pepper plantation. It is no coincidence that he lets slave families family work on Depok, eg Laurens and Loen van Ambon. During the period he writes a dissertation in which he establishes an ethical manifestation against VOC’s merchant politics, especially toward Governor-General Willem van Outhoorn, who is in favour of aggressive trade policy.\n\nHe opposes slavery advocating that slaves in the colonies be given their freedom. The Church Council of Batavia had ruled that slavery is contrary to the Bible, but this provision is valid only for Christians. Because of this, he converts his slaves to Christianity and liberates them. Their number in the year 1714 – the year that he dies – is estimated to be about 200. For his estate Depok, he buys slave families from various parts of the archipelago: Balinese, Ambonese, Buginese and Sundanese likely including descendants of Mardijkers, a group of Portuguese-creole, among his slaves. Of the 12 original slave families, at least five families adopt new Christian names. Roman Catholic families were also converted to (Protestant) Christianity by Chastelein. Isakh, Jacob, Jonathan, Joseph and Samuel are the Biblical names given by Chastelein to the converted slave families. The remaining seven families retain their original names: Bacas, Laurens, Leander, Loen, Sadokh, Soedira and Tholense. After World War II, the name Sadokh becomes extinct. Cornelis Chastelijn works (1704) for the Company once more as ‘Extraordinary Council’. At his 1st meeting in the Council of the Indies (1705), he is appointed (November 1708) as Ordinary Member of the Council of Dutch India receiving a monthly allowance of 350 guilders per month. He remains in this position to his death. He marries his niece Catharina van Quaelborg – her father, Cornelis van Quaelbergen then Council of India, is married to Henriëtte Chastelein.[54] They have one son Anthony, while Chastelein’s will shows that they also adopt a mixed blood girl as daughter: Maria Chastelein mixtures (5 June 1693). He dies (28 June 1714) at 4 o’clock in the afternoon (aged 56) and 28 June is still the official day of Chastelein being commemorated. In addition to his great ability as a businessman, he is a socially conscious man far ahead of his time. His greatest merit, however, is his legacy to his slaves. In his will, he bequeaths to the 12 original families and their descendants in perpetuity the 1240 ha estate Depok.[55]\n\nClaesje sails away (27 February 1689) to Batavia on the ship Het Wapen van Alkmaar arriving there (20 May 1689).[56] At Batavia Claesje almost immediately requests (27 May 1689) to be allowed to return to the Cape on the next Return Fleet.[57] Her request to be manumitted – because Van Helsdingen had promised her freedom – is referred by the VOC Governor-General and his Council at the Castle in Batavia to the Commander and the Council of Policy at the Cape:[58]\n\nClaasje from Angola in her own words had been about 37 years a Company slave at the Cape of Good Hope, and lately serving as midwife the wife of the fiscal at Surat Pieter van Helsdingen having come from there being allowed again to depart for there with the first return ships : yet, instead of approving her additional request desiring her freedom ; it is decided to favourably recommend this matter to the Commander and Council [at the Cape of Good Hope], insofar as she has long served the Company and behaved herself well to warrant her freedom, also that she has made it known that he [Pieter van Helsdingen] had promised her [freedom].”\n\nThat she is subsequently manumitted by the Company, is confirmed by her appearance as a free-citizen in Table Valley in the census (1692). Here she appears (this time with a patronymic indicative of an upwardly mobile enhanced status) as Claasje Jansz:. Her neighbours are the free-black Ma[a]ij Isabella van Angola and Dirk Bronsche.\n\nIn 1695 there is no mention of her in the tax rolls. Her absence is probably explained by her appearance (already in 1693) as part of the Company’s Slave muster (possibly already free?), seconded, presumably as a free-woman but in the employ of the Slave Lodge, to the landdrost Jan Mulder at Sorgvliet, Stellenbosch.\n\nServant to Landdrost Jan Mulder at Stellenbosch[59]\n\nJohannes (Jan) Mulder arrives at the Cape (1682) as soldier on the Geele Beer. He marries (13 December 1682) at the Cape Jacoba Kicheler / Legelaer (from The Hague).[60] On 28 November 1684 he is appointed winckelier and promoted, with Jan Hendrick Blum, to garrison bookkeeper (guarnisoen boechouder). He later becomes landdrost, free-burgher, church elder and surveyor (1687-1689).\n\nAfter Claesje’s return to Table Valley, Mulder’s household is the scene of much controversy in 1682. The shepherd Jantje van Batavia, a manumitted slave and free-black, has sexual relations with Adriana van Jaarsveld[61], an orphaned European girl (aged 13) living at the home of Jan’s employer, the landdrost Jan Mulder and his wife. He had been the slave of Hans Ehrentraut, former partner of Willem van Wijck (from Ingen, Gelderland), and was freed (23 June 1688) de gewenschte en dierbare vrijheijt by the orphan masters at the age of 22/23 in accordance with the wish expressed by his master before his death. At his trial, the fiscal demands death on the gallows, but Jantje, in self-defence, says that Adriaantje had been pregnant before he had sexual intercourse with her. Having heard his defense, the Council of Justice delay final judgement until the child is born. If the child is black, they would send Jantje to the gallows. If white, as it happened to be, the sentence is to be commuted to flogging, branding and a life-time in chains. It is noted in December that:\n\n… Dezen Adriana van een blanck kind verlost zijnde, is de sententie verandert in geselen, brandmercken en ad vitam in de kettingh.\n\nThough there is evidence of the girl’s general promiscuity, the court sentences Jantje to be scourged and sent in chains to Mauritius for 20 years’ hard labour.[62] Adriana van Jaarsveld, also found as Adriana Hoffers, and in the care of Jan Mulder and his wife being a ward of the Orphan Chamber. After the incident, she is hastily married (9 January 1695).[63] Within days of her marriage, she baptizes (16 January 1695) a daughter named Johanna.[64] In September 1699, word is received from Mauritius concerning Jantje van Batavia. He petitions the Cape authorities for clemency begging “that he might be relieved of his chains, and received a very good character and strong recommendation”.[65]\n\nVrijburgeresse (‘Free Citizen’) and Frij Froemoeder\n\n“Freedom is not something that anybody can be given. Freedom is something people take, and people are as free as they want to be …”\n\nJames Baldwin (1924-1987)\n\nIn 1700 she is recorded as a free-citizen Claasie van Angola and her neighbours are Job Scheerbeek and the recent returnees from the abandoned Dutch settlement at Mauritius, the free-fisherman Lambert Sijmonsz: Stam (from Amsterdam) and his wife, Maria Jans: Visser aka Maria de Lierman (1649-1718)(from Ommen, Overijssel), widow of Willem Willemsz: de Lierman (from Deventer, Overijssel). She is recorded (1705) in Table Valley as Claasje van Angola. Her neighbours are Pieter Pietersz: de Groot and his wife, the Cape-born halfslag Maria Pieters: and Pieter Hillekes Huijtema and his Cape-born halfslag wife, Martha Martens:.\n\nClaesje does not appear again (1709) and probably returns to work for the Company Slave Lodge where, having survived the devastating smallpox epidemic of 1713, she appears listed in the Slave Lodge muster (31 August 1714) as Maaij Klasje frij froemoeder.[66] She does not appear in the census for free citizens (1716-1719). She dies (December 1732) and the Company Journal uncharacteristically mentions (31 December 1732) the death of a presumably prominent, slave named Manna [sic – Mama or Mamãe ?] Claasje.[67]\n\n“… Warm, calm weather. Nothing of importance occurred. One slave named Manna Claasje [Mai Claesje van Angola] died during the month. And as this year has also come to an end, we feel ourselves bound to thank God the Lord from the bottom of our hearts, for all His Fatherly Grace & favours received during the past, with the prayer that the Giver of all good may in future preserve us from all harm, and grant us what we may require for our temporal prosperity, but above all, for our eternal happiness. Amen. (Signed) N[icolaa]s. LEY[68], 1st sworn clerk.”\n\nNo other Company slave with this name has been identified and the entry doubtless refers to the death of one of the Lodge’s more, if not most, prominent inhabitants.\n\nEpilogue: Warm, calm weather. Nothing of importance occurred … the solace of one’s labour pains …\n\nWithout a doubt the life of the slave woman Claesje, is quite remarkable. Evidently competent and no push over, Claesje accompanies a high-ranking VOC official and his wife to Batavia and on her return claims her freedom as promised. After spawning several children – at least three with European fathers – she lives an exceptionally long life able to witness one of her granddaughters becoming matron of the Slave Lodge. She herself, after a brief stint of freedom as a free citizen, retreats, opting instead for the safety and security of the Slave Lodge where she is re-employed – a free-black woman – as midwife until the end (1732) of her humble and protracted life-giving life. As midwife in the Slave Lodge, she has unique leverage in terms of inducing ‘confessions’ of biological paternity from slave mothers in mid-birth.[69] And despite her servile status, she also has the exceptional privilege of being allowed to give legal testimony – as well as perhaps even at times compelled to administer the expedient termination of lives deemed to be unsustainable. Curiously, Claesje’s decision to self-curtail her freedom coincides with Cornelis Chasteleijn’s ambitious assisted emancipation scheme for his many slaves at Batavia. During this ostensibly regressive move back into bondage – if Claesje is not the force majeure herself toiling behind the scenes to realize the freedom and if not of any of her children – then witnessing at the very least, the manumission (31 August 1728) of only her great-granddaughter Johanna Barbara. Sadly, it is only after her demise that her grandson David liberates himself – he does a runner (1735) thus releasing himself from the colonial record.[70] And only a good many years later do her granddaughter and great-granddaughter – both named Christijn – and her great-grandson Hermanus and grandson Roelof all finally manage to purchase – jointly or severally – their freedom (1743, 1748 and 7 August 1749).\n\nOur names are the light that glows on the sea waves at night and then dies without leaving its signature.\n\nRabindranath Tagore, Stray Birds (1916)\n\nGENEALOGY\n\n[?b1] Willem baptized 25 October 1665 … den 25 October is gedoopt van Edele Compagnie Slavinnen een dochter genaamd … Noch een zoon, is genaamd Willem de moeder Vlessijk [?
