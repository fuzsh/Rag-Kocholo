Baum has served as the basis for some of the most popular musicals on stage and screen. Show by show, Bunch highlights the forms and conventions of musical work as practiced in its time and context–such as the turn-of-the-century extravaganza, the classical Hollywood film musical, the Black Broadway musical of the 1970s, and the twenty-first-century mega-musical. He then shows how the journey of each show teaches participants and audiences something about how to act American within contested frameworks of race, gender, sexuality, age, and embodiment. Also explores home theatricals, make-believe play, school musicals, Oz-themed environments, and community events as sites where the performance of the American fairy tale brings home and utopia into contact through the conventions of the musical. 232 pages.\n\nRegina Zona & Sean Harkness: It Must Have Been the Mistletoe\n\n(new digital album)\n\nOpera singer Regina Zona and guitarist Sean Harkness. \"Sleigh Ride,\" \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\" \"Welcome Christmas / Christmas Time Is Here / My Favorite Things,\" \"The First Noel / Silent Night,\" \"Angels We Have Heard on High,\" \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire),\" \"Home (When Shadows Fall) / I'll Be Home for Christmas,\" \"A Christmas Love Song,\" \"What Child Is This / O Holy Night,\" \"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve,\" \"It Must Have Been the Mistletoe,\" \"Christmas Time of Year.\" Released 11/1/22.\n\nDecember 7, 2022\n\nCarl Moellenberg's Story: Broadway and Spirituality as a Path to Survival\n\n(Imagine and Wonder - Hardcover Book)\n\nBy Carl Moellenberg.
