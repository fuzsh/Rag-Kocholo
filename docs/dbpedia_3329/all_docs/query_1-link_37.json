This paper analyzes the difference that exists between the feelings and spiritual attitudes that Adam and Eve express on the occasion when they are informed by the angel Michael that they have to abandon the Garden of Eden. It is a comparison of their lament in order to understand the contrast of the two attitudes that Milton wove in the tapestry that Paradise Lost is. The paper also explores male and female roles in Paradise Lost and concludes that Adam and Eve are equal yet different, that difference being the cause of their contrastive ways of expressing their sorrow. Adam and Eve manifest two contrastive worldviews in opposition, one spiritual (heavenly, and the other material (earthly.\n\nOn the Inequalities of Babu\\\\vska-Aziz, Friedrichs and Horgan-Payne\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCostabel, Martin; Dauge, Monique\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe equivalence between the inequalities of Babu\\\\vska-Aziz and Friedrichs for sufficiently smooth bounded domains in the plane was shown by Horgan and Payne 30 years ago. We prove that this equivalence, and the equality between the associated constants, is true without any regularity condition on the domain. For the Horgan-Payne inequality, which is an upper bound of the Friedrichs constant for plane star-shaped domains in terms of a geometric quantity known as the Horgan-Payne angle, we show that it is true for some classes of domains, but not for all bounded star-shaped domains. We prove a weaker inequality that is true in all cases.\n\nUnder the Radar: The First Woman in Radio Astronomy, Ruby Payne-Scott\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMiller Goss, W.\n\n2012-05-01\n\nUnder the Radar, the First Woman in Radio Astronomy, Ruby Payne-Scott W. Miller Goss, NRAO Socorro NM Ruby Payne-Scott (1912-1981) was an eminent Australian scientist who made major contributions to the WWII radar effort (CSIR) from 1941 to 1945. In late 1945, she pioneered radio astronomy efforts at Dover Heights in Sydney, Australia at a beautiful cliff top overlooking the Tasman Sea. Again at Dover Heights, Payne-Scott carried out the first interferometry in radio astronomy using an Australian Army radar antenna as a radio telescope at sun-rise, 26 January 1946. She continued these ground breaking activities until 1951. Ruby Payne-Scott played a major role in discovering and elucidating the properties of Type III bursts from the sun, the most common of the five classes of transient phenomena from the solar corona. These bursts are one of the most intensively studied forms of radio emission in all of astronomy. She is also one of the inventors of aperture synthesis in radio astronomy. I examine her career at the University of Sydney and her conflicts with the CSIR hierarchy concerning the rights of women in the work place, specifically equal wages and the lack of permanent status for married women. I also explore her membership in the Communist Party of Australia as well as her partially released Australian Scientific Intelligence Organization file. Payne-Scottâs role as a major participant in the flourishing radio astronomy research of the post war era remains a remarkable story. She had a number of strong collaborations with the pioneers of early radio astronomy in Australia: Pawsey, Mills, Christiansen, Bolton and Little. I am currently working on a popular version of the Payne-Scott story; âMaking Waves, The Story of Ruby Payne-Scott: Australian Pioneer Radio Astronomerâ will be published in 2013 by Springer in the Astronomersâ Universe Series.\n\nCollege in Paradise!

Using a right-angled magnetic air prism, we have achieved a separation of â10 arcsec between â2 arcsec wide up- and down-spin peaks of 0.54 nm neutrons. The SUSANS instrument has thus been equipped with the polarized neutron option. The samples are placed in a uniform vertical field of 8.8 Ã 10(4) A/m (1.1 kOe). Several magnetic alloy ribbon samples broaden the up-spin neutron peak significantly over the Â±1.3 Ã 10(-3) nm(-1) range, while leaving the down-spin peak essentially unaltered. Fourier transforms of these SUSANS spectra corrected for the instrument resolution, yield micrometer-range pair distribution functions for up- and down-spin neutrons as well as the nuclear and magnetic scattering length density distributions in the samples.\n\nCecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, An Autobiography and Other Recollections\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHaramundanis, Katherine\n\nCecilia Payne-Gaposchkin became acclaimed in her lifetime as the greatest woman astronomer of all time. Her own story of her professional life, work and scientific achievements is augmented by the personal recollections of her daughter, Katherine Haramundanis, as well as a scientific appreciation by Jesse Greenstein, a historical essay by Peggy Kidwell and, in this new edition, an introduction by Virginia Trimble. Payne-Gaposchkin's overwhelming love for astronomy was her personal guiding light, and her attitude and approach have lessons for all. She received many prestigious awards for her outstanding contributions to science and in 1956 became the first woman to be advanced to the rank of Professor at Harvard University, as well as being the first woman departmental chair. This book will interest both astronomers and those studying the advancement of the position and status of women in society.\n\nParadise Lost: Difference Between Adam and Eve's Lament on Leaving Paradise - a Contrastive Analysis\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nServÃ­n, Sara Torres\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe difference between Adam and Eveâs lament on leaving Paradise in Miltonâs Paradise Lost is striking in its contrastive content and depth.

This paper reports an evaluation of the Queensland lockout pilot in Surfers Paradise. Patrons could not enter or re-enter licensed venues after 3âam, while patrons inside at this time could stay until close. Using police and ambulance data, time series analyses examined the impact of tourism seasons and the lockout on rates of crime, violence, injury and intoxication. Additional analyses were also conducted to show spatial and temporal changes in crime over time. Both police and ambulance data showed that the lockout introduction had no statistically significant impact on rates of crime, violence, head and neck injuries, and intoxication over the 2âyears following lockout. Hot spot maps indicated limited spatial shift of crime within Surfers Paradise following the lockout introduction, with evidence of a temporary intensification of crime in already established hot spots. We found a moderate statistically significant change in the 24âh distribution of crime after the lockout implementation, suggesting temporal displacement of crime. Results support the small existing body of evidence on lockouts that indicates they are largely ineffective in reducing crime and injuries in entertainment districts. As multi-pronged strategies that include a lockout gain in popularity, further investigation should focus on identifying the key drivers of successful interventions such as the Newcastle strategy, to better refine these interventions for replication and evaluation elsewhere.

His recordings are apocalyptic vignettes which juxtapose and conflate paradises, using many different voices. I describe the theological and political paradises in Johnsonâs songs: the Old Testament journey to Canaan; the post-death heaven in the New Testament; Christâs kingdom on earth in Revelation; freedom in Northern cities or Canada; and a utopian dream of political emancipation of African-Americans and transformation of society in the South. I outline the various voices present in Johnsonâs recordings: vocal styles; accompanying singers; the guitar; grammatical, textual and lexical voices; and the silent voices of technology and time. I suggest traces of a subtle political activism in these voices and paradises, and explore uses of these voices in linking paradises, arguing that the complex transitions enhance the force of signification and frustrate attempts to finalise meanings. Many interpretations of Johnsonâs recordings, however, seek to determine final meaning, and I discuss the limitations of such attempts, limitations which not only underestimate the richness of the recordings but deny Johnson any political awareness or agency. In cautioning against this kind of project, I call for a hearing open to plural interpretations, and suggest political potential not only in coded messages, but in radical indeterminacy itself.\n\nParadise, pleasure and desire: Edenic delight in some late-medieval dramatic fragments\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nJames, Sarah\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper explores the biblical Paradise and its relationship with the concept of delight or pleasure.

Commentary on Milton's Paradise Lost is not limited to verbal texts; painters and illustrators have contributed greatly to the poem by presenting their own time-bound readings and interpretations of the poem through their illustrations that are far beyond mere decorations. John Martin, in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution, deletes the Father and the Son from his illustrations. Only angels such as Raphael are the representations of deity and are as powerless and tiny as Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve, after the Fall seem as small, powerless and as subjugated to the natural surrounding as they were before the Fall. Satan is the only powerful figure in his elegant palace. Through a new historical outlook, the researchers aim at exposing the workings of ideology and dominant discourses that informed John Martin's pictorial reading of Milton's poem in the early 19th century\n\nREVIEW: A STEP AWAY FROM PARADISE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nReviewed by Konchok Gelek (Dkon mchog dge legs à½à½à½¼à½à¼à½à½à½¼à½à¼à½à½à½ºà¼à½£à½ºà½à½¦à¼ (Gengqiu Gelai æ´æ±æ ¼æ¥\n\n2018-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Thomas K.

The author was fascinated by the account of Tulshuk Lingpa's disciple, Dorje Wangmo, a Bhutanese nun and a disciple who abandoned her worldly possessions to pursue the land of dreams and imagined paradise. The author dug deeper by interviewing Kungsang, Tulshuk Lingpa's son, and other key disciples who were participants in the search of the same hidden realm on the slope of a glacier. Elements of this tale resemble magical realism with its narration detailing participants' experiences of magic, a parallel world, and a portal to the hidden land. The story centers on a continuing search for locating this paradise with each step holding the possibility of drawing nearer to the destination. This holds readers' curiosity to the end. In 1962, Tulshuk Lingpa led 300 followers from Sikkim and Bhutan to an adjacent area along the Nepal-Sikkim border. He then took a few close disciples to Kangchenjunga, a remote area located on the border between Sikkim and Nepal, and attempted to pass through a gate that he believed led to a heavenly place, paralleling our own existence. At that moment, an avalanche enveloped them, killing Tulshuk and injuring the two others with him. ...\n\nMedical education in paradise: another facet of Hawaii.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJacobs, Joshua L; Kasuya, Richard; Sakai, Damon; Haning, William; Izutsu, Satoru\n\n2008-06-01\n\nHawaii is synonymous with paradise in the minds of many. Few know that it is also an environment where high quality medical education is thriving. This paper outlines medical education initiatives beginning with native Hawaiian healers of centuries ago, and continuing to present-day efforts to support top-notch multicultural United States medical education across the continuum of training. The undergraduate medical education program has as its core community-based problem-based learning. The community basis of training is continued in graduate medical education, with resident doctors in the various programs rotating through different clinical experiences at various hospitals and clinics. Continuing medical education is provided by nationally accredited entities, within the local context. Educational outreach activities extend into primary and secondary schools, homeless shelters, neighbouring islands, and to countries throughout the Pacific. Challenges facing the medical education community in Hawaii are similar to those faced elsewhere and include incorporating more technology to improve efficiency, strengthening the vertical integration of the training continuum, better meeting the needs of the state, and paying for it all. Readers are invited to join in addressing these challenges to further the realisation of medical education in paradise as a paradise of medical education.\n\nMaking waves the story of Ruby Payne-Scott : Australian pioneer radio astronomer\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGoss, M\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis book is an abbreviated, partly re-written version of \"Under the Radar - The First Woman in Radio Astronomy: Ruby Payne-Scott.\" It addresses a general readership interested in historical and sociological aspects of astronomy and presents the biography of Ruby Payne-Scott (1912 â 1981). As the first female radio astronomer (and one of the first people in the world to consider radio astronomy), she made classic contributions to solar radio physics. She also played a major role in the design of the Australian government's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research radars, which were in turn of vital importance in the Southwest Pacific Theatre in World War II. These radars were used byÂ military personnelÂ from Australia, the United States and New Zealand. From a sociological perspective, her career offers many examples of the perils of being a female academic in the first half of the 20th century. Written in an engaging style and complemented by many historical photographs, this book offers fascinating...\n\nInfrared image background modeling based on improved Susan filtering\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYuehua, Xia\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWhen SUSAN filter is used to model the infrared image, the Gaussian filter lacks the ability of direction filtering. After filtering, the edge information of the image cannot be preserved well, so that there are a lot of edge singular points in the difference graph, increase the difficulties of target detection. To solve the above problems, the anisotropy algorithm is introduced in this paper, and the anisotropic Gauss filter is used instead of the Gauss filter in the SUSAN filter operator. Firstly, using anisotropic gradient operator to calculate a point of image's horizontal and vertical gradient, to determine the long axis direction of the filter; Secondly, use the local area of the point and the neighborhood smoothness to calculate the filter length and short axis variance; And then calculate the first-order norm of the difference between the local area of the point's gray-scale and mean, to determine the threshold of the SUSAN filter; Finally, the built SUSAN filter is used to convolution the image to obtain the background image, at the same time, the difference between the background image and the original image is obtained. The experimental results show that the background modeling effect of infrared image is evaluated by Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity (SSIM) and local Signal-to-noise Ratio Gain (GSNR). Compared with the traditional filtering algorithm, the improved SUSAN filter has achieved better background modeling effect, which can effectively preserve the edge information in the image, and the dim small target is effectively enhanced in the difference graph, which greatly reduces the false alarm rate of the image.\n\nIndia, a paradise for Genetic Studies\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nFirst page Back Continue Last page Overview Graphics.

While Payne, later Payne-Gaposchkin, did not extend her data and conclusions to the universe, her 1925 monograph, described by Otto Struve as ``the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy,'' is a pioneering landmark that for the first time combined astronomical observations of stellar spectra with the then new atomic theories of Bohr and Saha. Her conclusions were suppressed by her advisor, H.N. Russell, but she wisely published her data with a disclaimer. Though facing overt gender discrimination throughout her career, and suffering the ``pink paycheck'' so well known to many women, she persevered and, towards the end of her working lifetime at Harvard University, became Chairman of the Department of Astronomy, a department she had helped to establish with the exuberant director Harlow Shapley in the 1920s and 1930s. One colleague, who called her ``An Astronomer's Astronomer,'' admired her as a person of great kindness, graciousness, humor and humility, who conveyed her love for the science ``lucidly and enthusiastically.'' She never lost her love and ardor for astronomy and astrophysics and made innumerable contributions to these sciences. Her work continues to inspire and provoke those working in the field, and she remains a model for all scientists to follow.\n\nMeet EPA Scientist Susan Yee, Ph.D.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSusan Yee, Ph.D., is an ecologist at EPA's Gulf Ecology Division.

Peat is a highly organic and compressible material. Surfers Paradise (as a study area has problematic peat layer due to its high water content, high compressibility, and low shear strength. This layer has various thicknesses at different locations ranging between R.L. . 10 to R.L. -19.6 m. Buildings in Surfers Paradise are using piled foundations to avoid the high compressibility and low shear strength peat layer. Spatial Analyst extension in the GIS ArcMap10 has been utilised to develop zonation maps for different depths in the study area. Each depth has been interpolated as a surface to create Standard Penetration Test SPT-N value GIS-based zonation maps for each depth. In addition, 8 interpolation techniques have been examined to evaluate which technique gives better representation for the Standard Penetration Test (SPT data. Inverse Distance weighing (IDW method in Spatial Analyst extension gives better representation for the utilised data with certain parameters. Two different cross sections have been performed in the core of the study area to determine the extent and the depth of the peat layer underneath already erected buildings. Physical and engineering properties of the Surfers Paradise peat have been obtained and showed that this peat falls within the category of tropical peat.\n\nThinking about rumination: the scholarly contributions and intellectual legacy of Susan Nolen-Hoeksema.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLyubomirsky, Sonja; Layous, Kristin; Chancellor, Joseph; Nelson, S Katherine\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOur article reviews and celebrates Susan Nolen-Hoeksema's remarkable contributions to psychological and clinical science, focusing on her vast body of theoretical and empirical work and her influence on colleagues and students. Susan spent her career trying to understand how and why a style of regulating emotions called rumination increases vulnerability to depression and exacerbates and perpetuates negative moods.

The three main strands of this thesis are Gothic, Noir and sense of place. The novel, ââHeaven and Hell at the Paradise Motelâ, is preoccupied with the natural environment, its subtle seasonal changes and the way the environment impacts on its human inhabitants and how they in turn affect it. The novel is, in a very Gothic sense, haunted by dreams, apparitions and narratives â specifically mini-narratives that reflect the nature of fairy tales, horror stories and urban myths. It contains elements of melodrama, horror, romance. The story follows a deeply dysfunctional family through a seasonal cycle: beginning in Spring and ending once again in Spring. A key focus for both the creative and the theoretical work was the everyday application of the Gothic and Noir â for example a house doesnât have to be a castle to be haunted; people donât have to be monsters to be monstrous. The dark, the strange, the sinister and the perverse lurk in the shadows of everyday reality, but also how these elements intertwined within the landscape.\n\nParallax adjustment algorithm based on Susan-Zernike moments\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDeng, Yan; Zhang, Kun; Shen, Xiaoqin; Zhang, Huiyun\n\n2018-02-01\n\nPrecise parallax detection through definition evaluation and the adjustment of the assembly position of the objective lens or the reticle are important means of eliminating the parallax of the telescope system, so that the imaging screen and the reticle are clearly focused at the same time. An adaptive definition evaluation function based on Susan-Zernike moments is proposed. First, the image is preprocessed by the Susan operator to find the potential boundary edge. Then, the Zernike moments operator is used to determine the exact region of the reticle line with sub-pixel accuracy. The image definition is evaluated only in this related area. The evaluation function consists of the gradient difference calculated by the Zernike moments operator. By adjusting the assembly position of the objective lens, the imaging screen and the reticle will be simultaneously in the state of maximum definition, so the parallax can be eliminated. The experimental results show that the definition evaluation function proposed in this paper has the advantages of good focusing performance, strong anti-interference ability compared with the other commonly used definition evaluation functions.\n\nParadise Lost: Introducing Students to Climate Change through Story\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBennon, Brady\n\n2013-01-01\n\n\"This country has been the basis of my being.

A novel infrared small target detection algorithm based on improved SUSAN operator is put forward. The algorithm selects double templates for the infrared small target detection: one size is greater than the small target point size and another size is equal to the small target point size. First, the algorithm uses the big template to calculate the USAN of each pixel in the image and detect the small target, the edge of the image and isolated noise pixels; Then the algorithm uses the another template to calculate the USAN of pixels detected in the first step and improves the principles of SUSAN algorithm based on the characteristics of the small target so that the algorithm can only detect small targets and don't sensitive to the edge pixels of the image and isolated noise pixels. So the interference of the edge of the image and isolate noise points are removed and the candidate target points can be identified; At last, the target is detected by utilizing the continuity and consistency of target movement. The experimental results indicate that the improved SUSAN detection algorithm can quickly and effectively detect the infrared small targets.\n\nCharacterization of genetic diversity of bird-of-paradise accessions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlessandro Aparecido Brito dos Santos\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This study aimed to characterize genetic diversity in the bird-of-paradise (Strelitzia reginae collection at the Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso Carlos Alberto Reyes Maldonado (UNEMAT by estimating genetic divergence among genotypes based on agronomic characteristics. Seven agronomic characters were evaluated with average Euclidean distance. The UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean hierarchical clustering method was used between groups, as well as Tocherâs optimization clustering method and principal component analysis (PCA, in order to classify the genotypes with maximum similarity between groups. Measures of genetic dissimilarity with average Euclidean distance verified the existence of genetic variability among accessions since the amplitude of dissimilarity values ranged from 1.09 to 36.97. Tocherâs clustering method verified the formation of two distinct groups. UPGMA hierarchical clustering, based on the dissimilarity matrix, verified the formation of three groups with 30% cutoff point. Based on the main components analysis, we verified genetic divergence between the bird-of-paradise accessions in the UNEMAT Collection. The most promising combinations for future crosses in breeding programs comprise accessions 1, 11, and 23 and accession 1 as the most divergent among the accessions evaluated.\n\nIs Ecotourism Just Another Story of Paradise Lost?\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nEnglish, Brian J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper uses Miltonâs epic Paradise Lost as a metaphor to highlight the pitfalls of the label âecotourismâ.

It questions the importance of the context in which the movie with a historical theme is created and in that light its significance is interpreted. Based on the structural theory of myth, the article examines the elements of the mythic structure of Christopher Columbusâs voyage, relating this concept to Utopia. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of the first meeting or the clash between two cultures, which determines their future relations. According to the established theoretical and critical framework, the notions of paradise as well as the figure of the foreigner are questioned. The intention of this paper is to demonstrate that in Ridley Scottâs film history is much more complex and cannot be enclosed in platitudes and common places. Although it was not Scottâs intention to offer a counterfactual view of recorded history, and he does not question what might have happened in other circumstances, by introducing certain apocryphal elements and foretelling later historical events, we show that he is able to start a discussion on views on the process of discovery and conquest of America and especially about their meaning throughout history and their relationship with the present.\n\nPhytochemical Investigation of Antimicrobial Seed Extract of Citrus paradise Fruits\n\nOpenAIRE\n\n, R.M.O.

It thus supports the findings of Robert Charles Fox, who in his study The Seven Deadly Sins in Paradise Lost first thoroughly analysed and comprehensively presented this issue and its importance in Miltonâs epic. The authors of the study share Foxâs belief that Milton consciously used the system of the Seven Capital Vices in his epic as a structural device to present the entire scope of evil to the willing reader, and he achieved this by giving Satan and six other major denizens of Hell each the characteristics of a particular Vice. In other words, each of the seven major diabolical figures that appear in Paradise Lost embodies or personifies one of the Seven Capital Vices. As the most eloquent and characteristically perfected of the diabolical figures of Hell, Satan embodies Pride, the prime Capital Vice.\n\nOn a new bird of paradise from Central New Guinea, Falcinellus meyeri albicans\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nOort, van E.D.\n\n1915-01-01\n\nAmong the collection of birdskins brought home by the third expedition to Mount Wilhelmina in the Snow Mountains of New Guinea there are some specimens, males and females, of a bird of paradise, much resembling Falcinellus meyeri (Finsch) from South-east New Guinea, but differing in some points.\n\nTeaching Students About Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Discrimination: An Interview with Susan Fiske\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHackney, Amy\n\n2005-01-01\n\nSusan T.

The protocol involves the use of a simple and cheap superbase under mild, additive- and metal-free conditions towards the initial formation of a less substituted carbonate product that equilibrates to a tri- or even tetra-substituted cyclic carbonate under thermodynamic control. The latter are conveniently trapped in situ providing overall a new domino process for synthetically elusive heterocyclic scaffolds. Control experiments provide a rationale for the observed cascade reactions, which demonstrate high similarity with the well-known Payne rearrangement of epoxy alcohols.

The first results from the limitationâinherent in the human conditionâto express the ineffable, which the author experiences; the second stems from the difficulty of language that Dante himself builds in order to overcome the first difficulty. The success or the failure of a translation is measured in terms of how much of the original message the translator manages to make available to the reader in a foreign language, and this percentage can only be revealed by comparative analysis. Therefore, this paper starts from a comparative analysis between the original text of the Paradise and its Romanian translations, with a focus on the contexts that foster the concept of âTrinityâ; the analysis carried out on the Romanian versions revealed both successful equivalences, semantically and formally faithful to the original, and cases of âbetrayalâ of the original text.\n\nResurrecting Absence: Iconic Ghosts in the Poetry of Susan Howe\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJessica Wilkinson\n\n2011-04-01\n\nFull Text Available The article focuses on the opinions of Susan Howe in her book A Bibliography of the King's Book, Or Eikon Basilike.

Their brilliant, structurally colored feathers play a principal role in mating displays. The structural coloration of both the occipital and breast feathers of the bird-of-paradise Lawes' parotia is produced by melanin rodlets arranged in layers, together acting as interference reflectors. Light reflection by the silvery colored occipital feathers is unidirectional as in a classical multilayer, but the reflection by the richly colored breast feathers is three-directional and extraordinarily complex. Here we show that the reflection properties of both feather types can be quantitatively explained by finite-difference time-domain modeling using realistic feather anatomies and experimentally determined refractive index dispersion values of keratin and melanin. The results elucidate the interplay between avian coloration and vision and indicate tuning of the mating displays to the spectral properties of the avian visual system.\n\nSome exact solutions to the LighthillâWhithamâRichardsâPayne traffic flow equations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRowlands, G; Infeld, E; Skorupski, A A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe find a class of exact solutions to the LighthillâWhithamâRichardsâPayne (LWRP) traffic flow equations. Using two consecutive Lagrangian transformations, a linearization is achieved. Next, depending on the initial density, we either apply (again two) Lambert functions and obtain exact formulae for the dependence of the car density and velocity on x, t, or else, failing that, the same result in a parametric representation. The calculation always involves two possible factorizations of a consistency condition. Both must be considered. In physical terms, the lineup usually separates into two offshoots at different velocities. Each velocity soon becomes uniform. This outcome in many ways resembles the two soliton solution to the Kortewegâde Vries equation. We check general conservation requirements. Although traffic flow research has developed tremendously since LWRP, this calculation, being exact, may open the door to solving similar problems, such as gas dynamics or water flow in rivers. With this possibility in mind, we outline the procedure in some detail at the end.

The correlations found between the scores measured in the \"closed\" field and those measured in the \"transparent\" field are discussed in this paper.\n\nSusan Sontag â A Forgotten Mother?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKludia Ziewiec\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article discusses new and republished translations of Susan Sontagâs work, recently launched by the Karakter publishing house: Regarding the Pan of Others, On Photography, and Against Interpretation and Other Essays. The article focuses on the elements of Sontagâs thought that make her a forgotten mother of feminist and gender theoreticians, as well as such influential critics as Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes. The article points out to continuations of Sontagâs thought in contemporary theoretical and social projects, and to the pertinence of her critical observations on theories based on metaphysics of presence: psychoanalysis, Marxism, or hermeneutics. The article also touches upon history of war photography and related war journalism, and upon the ambivalent quality of imaging of the misery of war. It also present historical and cultural circumstances of the development of Sontagâs thought in the intellectual milieu of New York in the 1960s. The discussion recapitulates the main statements of Sontagâs essays, relating them to a wider theoretical context, which is aimed at a reappraisal of the forgotten intelectual in the history of literature.\n\n'Dark Paradise: Norfolk Island â Isolation, Savagery, Mystery, and Murder' by Robert Macklin\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nCauser, T.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nNorfolk Islandâs past has suffered much misrepresentation and misunderstanding over the years, particularly in relation to the penal settlement in operation between 1825 and 1855. Sadly, Dark Paradise is another in a long line of narratives of questionable accuracy. The cover blurb claims that Norfolk Island is âexposed like never beforeâ, while elsewhere the author notes that he hoped to write the âdefinitive historyâ of Norfolk Islandâs âhorrific past (and present)â. These are surprising as...\n\nUltrastructure of Spermatogenesis of the Paradise Fish, Macropodus opercularis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTsung-Han Lee\n\n2006-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The intricate process of spermatogenesis in the paradise fish, Macropodus opercularis, was studied. In this species, the unrestricted or lobular type testes lining the caudal side of the body cavity are translucent and slender. Spermatogonia occur along the length of the tubules and the development of sperm takes place within cysts formed by Sertoli cells. Spermiogenesis involves preparatory morphological events followed by conspicuous modifications such as the movement of the centrioles, completion of the nuclear condensation, reduction of the cytoplasm, and the final differentiation of the flagellar complex. Mature spermatozoon has an oval nucleus, condensed chromatin, and typical 9 + 2 flagellar axoneme but lack acrosome. The role of the material in the nucleus and the cytoplasm as it reaches the Sertoli cell in the control of spermatogenesis is discussed.\n\nSusan Magoffinâs Santa Fe Days in 1846: The Value of Testimony Les journÃ©es de Santa FÃ© en 1846 de Susan MagoffinÂ : la valeur du tÃ©moignage\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSusanne Berthier-Foglar\n\n2009-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Susan Magoffin, la jeune Ã©pouse dâun commerÃ§ant de la piste de Santa Fe, accompagna son mari en 1846 pour un voyage oÃ¹ la caravane suivait de prÃ¨s lâArmÃ©e de lâOuest et pendant lequel elle tint un journal.

Citron\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKimberly Reitsma\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFull Text Available One of the currently prevalent analytic approaches in academia is feminist theory and criticism. Its combination with musicology has influenced the field for the past four decades. The goal of the new approach, loosely termed âfeminist musicology,â has been to discover, analyze, discuss, and promote the representation of women and the âfeminineâ essence in various disciplines of music. Today, feminist musicology is highly researched, published in books and journals, and presented as scholarly papers at various musicological conferences around the world. This new approach introduces the ideologies of feminism to the study of music. Susan McClary and Marcia J. Citron are two musicologists who were influenced by these ideologies and have guided the musicological world in this direction of feminist musicology. Both have made serious contributions to the emerging field of feminist musicology. Both researched the ideas of gender musical construction within musical narratives, music as a gendered discourse, and historical and social factors that affected women in music. Although they have met with considerable resistance, Susan McClary and Marcia J. Citron have significantly expanded the scope of musicology through their application of feminist theory.\n\n[The Durkheim Test. Remarks on Susan Leigh Star's Boundary Objects].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGieÃmann, Sebastian\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe article reconstructs Susan Leigh Star's conceptual work on the notion of 'boundary objects'. It traces the emergence of the concept, beginning with her PhD thesis and its publication as Regions of the Mind in 1989. 'Boundary objects' attempt to represent the distributed, multifold nature of scientific work and its mediations between different 'social worlds'. Being addressed to several 'communities of practice', the term responded to questions from Distributed Artificial Intelligence in Computer Science, Workplace Studies and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and microhistorical approaches inside the growing Science and Technology Studies. Yet the interdisciplinary character and interpretive flexibility of Starâs invention has rarely been noticed as a conceptual tool for media theory. I therefore propose to reconsider Star's 'Durkheim test' for sociotechnical media practices.\n\nKeeping it pure: could New Zealand be an eco paradise?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIan Yeoman\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Purpose â The world is changing and key change agents include climate change and scarcity of resources. The purpose of this paper is to address how New Zealand and tourism could address the future and generate appropriate strategic responses. Design/methodology/approach â Using the process of scenario analysis and drawing upon recent research from the www.tourism2050.com project, this paper describes the circumstances, drivers, economic consequences and key decisions that New Zealand would have to take in order to position itself as an eco paradise. The background to the scenario presumes overarching behaviours in a cooperative world in which resources are scarce. Findings â The scenario portrays a future of collective individualism, where a high degree of personal freedom exists but within the constraints of a world in which there is a scarcity of resources. A communitarian ethos drives policy making with an emphasis on efficient resource use and waste minimisation. New Zealand is a nation favoured by climate change. Environmental intellectual property is one of the nation's key resources and in the spirit of achieving a global environmental equilibrium these technologies are shared with the rest of the world. Life is simple. Competitive individualism is equated with excess and resource waste, while cooperation, harmony, and the continuation of a global cooperative psyche are seen as the foundation stones of the continued, relatively comfortable survival of humanity. Tourism is a luxury and activities are environmentally ethical. Visitors are well-off, purposeful, highly respectful and careful to prove their worth. Originality/value â Eco paradise represents the classic tale of a prisoner's dilemma in which decision makers and consumers ponder the betterment of humankind against individualism. The scenario concludes with a strategic map of the core decisions New Zealand's tourism industry would have to take.

In this epic in verse Milton, by displaying a portrait that combines Greek Mythology and Christian teachings, seeks to elucidate Divine Providence and manâs relation with Godâs decree. He puts together Divine will-power and human determination to make the meaning understood of the Manâs Fall.

J.; Kaluzny, S.; Kulakowski, K.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nA social network is modeled by a complete graph of N nodes, with interpersonal relations represented by links. In the framework of the Heider balance theory, we prove numerically that the probability of each balanced state is the same. This means in particular, that the probability of the paradise state, where all relations are positive, is 21-N . The proof is performed within two models. In the first, relations are changing continuously in time, and the proof is performed only for N = 3 with the methods of nonlinear dynamics. The second model is the Constrained Triad Dynamics, as introduced by Antal, Krapivsky and Redner in 2005. In the latter case, the proof makes use of the symmetries of the network of system states and it is completed for 3â¤ Nâ¤ 7 .\n\nLesson Plans for \"Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.

C.; Decker, L.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nA previously unreported internal tidal bore, which evolves into solitary internal wave packets, was observed in Port Susan, Puget Sound, and the timing, speed, and amplitude of the waves were measured by CTD and visual observation. Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements were attempted, but unsuccessful. The waves appear to be generated with the ebb flow along the tidal flats of the Stillaguamish River, and the speed and width of the resulting waves can be predicted from second-order KdV theory. Their eventual dissipation may contribute significantly to surface mixing locally, particularly in comparison with the local dissipation due to the tides. Visually the waves appear in fair weather as a strong foam front, which is less visible the farther they propagate.\n\n\"I Am Not a Fairy Tale\": Contextualizing Sioux Spirituality and Story Traditions in Susan Power's \"The Grass Dancer\"\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDiana, Vanessa Holford\n\n2009-01-01\n\nStanding Rock Sioux writer Susan Power's best-selling novel \"The Grass Dancer\" (1994) includes depictions of the supernatural and spiritual that do not conform to the Judeo-Christian or, in some cases, the atheist or rationalist worldviews of many readers.

New data, indicating in-situ peat development and marine influence, collected from the first in-mine exposure of this interval are presented. Borehole data from the region are examined in the context of ''ragged edge'' exposures and a carbonate platform depositional model for this portion of the Illinois Basin is presented. This shows that deposition of the sequence was influenced both by the underlying sediments and by a marine transgression. The former influence is seen in variations in coal and limestone thickness over sandstone-filled channels versus over shale bayfill deposits. The latter is marked by the progressive upwards loss of coal benches (i.e., the bottom bench of both coals is the most extensive and the Herrin coal is more extensive than the overlying Paradise coal) and by marine partings in both coals. Further, the brecciated margins seen in both coal seams are similar to brecciated peats encountered along the Everglades margins of Southwest Florida. Overall coal distributions are similar to both those along the Everglades margins and those along a transect from the Belize coast to Ambergis Caye.

Al-Badarneh\n\n2014-07-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper absolves John Milton from any critical and feminist accusation of being anti-feminist in Paradise Lost. Such defense of Milton is based on the close reading and analysis of the passages that focus on Adam and Eve in the text. This study highlights Miltonâs modern view of women as independent, free, and responsible. It also presents his iconoclasm in representing women as leaders and initiative takers when decision is to be taken. This study shows Milton reversing traditional gender roles through the relationship of Adam and Eve. In addition, one can find a modern emphasis on the principles of equality, democracy, dialogue, freedom, and free will available in the poem and designed in a way that serves Eveâs rights in comparison with Adamâs. Therefore, my voice in defending Milton joins the cohort of critics who believe of Miltonâs wide perspective of pro-feminism and not a person of misogyny.\n\nUndeath in Paradise: The Humanity of the Zombie in (Religious Utopias\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMadelon Hoedt\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The words âutopiaâ and âzombieâ are likely to conjure up strong images in the mind of the reader. The first makes one think of perfection, of happiness, of something new and better; the other, of the monstrous, of death and decay. Despite the fact that these images are arguably the most common, one can question their validity: can it be said that utopias are always perfect, and are the undead always monstrous? In this paper, I aim to explore the concepts relating to both utopias and zombies and the possible connections between the two, including a reading of the undead in light of the ultimate utopia: Paradise. In the light of these analyses, I propose a more positive approach to the figure of the zombie, which will be discussed as a counterpoint to the commonly held views of (religious utopias. Keywords: utopia, dystopia, Christianity, Revelation, Paradise, Second Coming, zombie, post-zombieA man, dressed in an old, torn and dusty suit, is seen in the distance, staggering between the tombstones as he makes his way towards the two young people, who have come to the cemetery to visit their fatherâs grave. They notice the man, but make fun of him; to them, the figure is not dangerous. Until he attacks them. Part of the opening sequence of George A. Romeroâs Night of the Living Dead (1968, it was in this film that audiences were introduced to the now iconic figure of the shambling, flesh-eating undead. Cinemagoers saw the dead come back to life, crawling out of the earth as if it were Judgement Day. These creatures may have looked human, but were unmistakably evil, attacking and feeding on anything they could find. This negative image of the zombie existed in horror media before Romeroâs reinvention of the narrative in the shape of the voodoo zombi of Haitian origins, and this vision has persisted ever since. The undead are the monstrous Other and perhaps the ultimate threat to humanity: as their numbers grow, they replace and\n\nSusan Loucks-Horsley learning model in light pollution theme: based on a new taxonomy for science education\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLiliawati, W; Utama, J A; Fauziah, H\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe curriculum in Indonesia recommended that science teachers in the elementary and intermediate schools should have interdisciplinary ability in science.

Indeed, he used to call this device âtraduire Ã la vitreâ, which means providing a transparent translation. This way, he remained faithful to the strangeness of the English language and refused any adaptation. However, the translation of a work which to some values related to the English revolution by an author who left for London during the French revolution raises several questions: could the âEnchanteurâ get rid of his stylistic prints? Didnât he leave his imprint on Miltonâs style? Was the positive side of Satan, assimilated to Freedom, completely depicted in the translation of a counter-revolutionary author? The analysis of Chateaubriandâs translation of Satanâs speech to his troops when the paradise is lost gives an answer to all these questions.\n\nA conversation with Susan Band Horwitz.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHorwitz, Susan Band; Goldman, I David\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSusan Band Horwitz is a Distinguished Professor and holds the Falkenstein Chair in Cancer Research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. She is co-chair of the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and associate director for therapeutics at the Albert Einstein Cancer Center. After graduating from Bryn Mawr College, Dr. Horwitz received her PhD in biochemistry from Brandeis University. She has had a continuing interest in natural products as a source of new drugs for the treatment of cancer. Her most seminal research contribution has been in the development of Taxol(Â®). Dr. Horwitz and her colleagues made the discovery that Taxol had a unique mechanism of action and suggested that it was a prototype for a new class of antitumor drugs. Although Taxol was an antimitotic agent blocking cells in the metaphase stage of the cell cycle, Dr. Horwitz recognized that Taxol was blocking mitosis in a way different from that of other known agents. Her group demonstrated that the binding site for Taxol was on the Î²-tubulin subunit. The interaction of Taxol with the Î²-tubulin subunit resulted in stabilized microtubules, essentially paralyzing the cytoskeleton, thereby preventing cell division. Dr. Horwitz served as president (2002-2003) of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. She has received numerous honors and awards, including the C.

Geotourism is still a new discipline and relatively little has been written about its demand side, demonstrated by a lack of studies in the literature This article studies the recreational value of geotourism areas, and focuses on the first geopark in the Czech Republic, namely the Czech Paradise Geopark. To assess the recreational value the travel cost method is applied, specifically the individual travel cost model. The necessary research data was gathered through intensive tourist surveys conducted in the study area.

It is the purged space of perfection and pure happiness, where the believers who have washed their clothes in the blood of the Lamb are in harmony, together with the angels, continuously praising the saving and triumphant Holy Trinity. It is the feast of the bog weeding, of the union between Christ and His Church, it is the divine Liturgy which is the union of the saintsâ and the angelsâ voices who worship the divine glory.\n\nPlastic paradise: transforming bodies and selves in Costa Rica's cosmetic surgery tourism industry.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAckerman, Sara L\n\n2010-10-01\n\nLong popular as a nature tourism destination, Costa Rica has recently emerged as a haven for middle class North Americans seeking inexpensive, state-of-the-art cosmetic surgery. This paper examines \"cosmetic surgery tourism\" in Costa Rica as a form of medicalized leisure, situated in elite private spaces and yet inextricably linked to a beleaguered national medical program. Through historical context and ethnographic analysis of activities at medical hotels and clinics, I describe how the recovery industry operates on the embodied subjectivities of visiting patients and their local caretakers. Recovery sociality and healing landscapes facilitate patients' transition through a period of post-surgical liminality and provide nostalgic transport to an imagined medical arcadia, while clinicians are attracted by a neoliberal promise of prosperity and autonomy. Ultimately, Costa Rica's transformation into a paradise of medical consumption and self-optimization is contingent on a mythology that obscures growing uncertainties and inequities in the nation's broader medical landscape.\n\n'Nine times the space' : from translator's notes to Milton's Paradise lost\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarjan Strojan\n\n1997-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Understanding the original meaning in the original context forms the b"
