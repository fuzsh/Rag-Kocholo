The Asia-Pacific region is home to some of the fastest growing economies in the world, and TPP will help open more markets to American businesses and exports.\n\nSpecifically, the TPP will feature new cross-cutting issues not previously included in trade agreements. In addition, the agreement focuses on integrating small- and medium-sized businesses more competitively to regional supply chains. Additional export opportunities for American businesses can help create more job opportunities for American workers, and will help grow the American economy."
