The gang's is back together! 🚀 Over the next ~82 days, Serguei and I are all in on a sprint to build out Upsolve AI (YC W24) 🏃♂️. What an amazing opportunity to be part of Y Combinator, and we're very lucky to have mentors like Dalton Caldwell, Pete Koomen and David Lieb directly at our disposal. Their advice has already reshaped our approach to building Upsolve in significant ways. Plus, the energy and inspiration we're drawing from our fellow batch mates are simply amazing! 💥 If you need to build out your customer-facing analytics within your platform/product, hit us up. We will make it happen for you! 💻 (In the photo, it's us using our kitchen top as our work desks since our standing desks have not yet arrived 😅) #ycombinator #startuplife #startup #upsolve #upsolveai #siliconvalley"
