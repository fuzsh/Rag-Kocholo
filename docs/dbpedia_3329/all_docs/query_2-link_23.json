        "text": "Discussion\n\nCKD affects a large segment of the aging population, but the causes remain poorly defined. The transmission of higher pressure and flow pulsatility into the kidney microvasculature due to increased aortic stiffness is a potential mechanism of disease. In a population-based study of 940 older adults, we found a prevalence of CKD of 32% and a broad range of values of CFPWV and CPP. We found that CPP was more strongly related to kidney disease measures than CFPWV, but both measures were attenuated after adjustments for age and CVD risk factors. Higher CPP was associated with modestly higher levels of albuminuria after adjustments, suggesting that aortic stiffness may play a role in the development of kidney disease.\n\nThe ranges of CFPWV and CPP seen in our study were similar to those seen in other older populations [24,49]. The average values in our study were higher than those seen in younger cohorts from both the general population, such as the Framingham Study which used the same protocol and equipment, as well as CKD populations, such as the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study [18,21]. The observed measures for aortic stiffness in our population included values that have previously been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events [32]. However, the strength of the association of the aortic stiffness and cardiovascular events may attenuate with age [50].\n\nAlthough CFPWV and CPP are both used as measures of aortic stiffness, we found these parameters to have different relationships to the kidney disease measures, especially ACR. CFPWV is computed from the distance from the carotid to femoral sites over transit time between the end of diastole at the two sites; it is primarily affected by the blood vessel wall properties, such as thickness and elasticity [39]. These changes in wall properties can lead to loss of impedance mismatch between the central and peripheral vasculature, resulting in increased transmission of pulsatility into the peripheral arterial beds, such as the kidneys. Although we did not observe this relationship in our study, the higher pressure and flow pulsatility in the kidney are hypothesized to produce vasoconstriction and reduced GFR. On the other hand, CPP is affected by cardiac function, pulsatility of blood flow, and the interaction between aortic stiffness and aortic diameter [51]. Excessive pressure pulsatility associated with increased CPP may damage the endothelium of the glomerular capillaries, potentially contributing to albuminuria [9]. The majority of previous studies examining aortic stiffness and albuminuria have used CFPWV or PWV at other sites, such as aortic or brachial-femoral, as the measure of aortic stiffness.\n\nWe found no evidence for a relationship between eGFR and either measure of aortic stiffness. The narrow confidence intervals for the relationship of eGFR with iCFPWV (−1.46 to +0.87 ml/min/1.73 m2 per SD of iCFPWV) and CPP (−6.23 to +0.79 ml/min/1.73 m2 per SD of CPP) make it unlikely that there is a clinically meaningful association in our study population. However, our study population might not have been optimal to detect the associations. Due to the age of our participants, those who had died prior to the AGES-RS-I visit or declined participation may have been more likely to have higher aortic stiffness or lower kidney function, resulting in underestimation of the true relationship. This type of informative censoring would bias our findings towards the null hypothesis. Although our measures of aortic stiffness and kidney disease are state of-the-art, they may be imprecise, presenting another possible source of bias towards the null hypothesis. For example, eGFR is known to provide an imprecise estimate of measured GFR, due to non-GFR determinants of circulating levels of creatinine and cystatin C, with eGFR based on both creatinine and cystatin C to be the more precise than either alone [52]. Our colleagues found a significant relationship between measured GFR and CFPWV in a selected cohort from a later visit of the AGES study [29]. The differences in the relationship of aortic stiffness to measured and estimated GFR serve to highlight potential limitations of eGFR for these analyses, a finding that has been shown in previous studies [53].\n\nThe observed absence of a strong relationship between eGFR and aortic stiffness is consistent with findings from two other population-based studies with both cross-sectional and longitudinal components, the Health ABC and Framingham Heart Studies [20,21]. However, other studies in the general population as well as CKD cohorts found significant associations between aortic stiffness and lower eGFR in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies [18,20,22,23,26], even after adjustment for age, blood pressure, and CVD risk factors. These associations were often seen in younger populations, minimizing the potential effect of survivor bias affecting our population.\n\nWe did find a significant association between aortic stiffness measured with CPP, but not CFPWV, and albuminuria, even after adjustment for age, sex, MAP, and other CVD risk factors. Our observed relationship with CPP and albuminuria but not eGFR may be due to the different mechanisms leading to increased albuminuria vs. lower eGFR. However, the strength of the association of CPP with albuminuria was modest (a 14% higher ACR per SD higher CPP). The effect of higher CPP on the development or kidney disease (ACR >30 mg/g) and its progression needs to be further explored with longitudinal follow up. Meanwhile, the narrow confidence intervals for the relationship of ACR to CFPWV (−0.09 to 0.11 mg/g per SD of CFPWV) suggest that it is highly unlikely that there is a clinically meaningful association in our study population.\n\nOur finding of the association of CPP and albuminuria is consistent with the Framingham Heart Study in which CPP and CFPWV at baseline were associated with baseline albuminuria in cross-sectional analyses and incident albuminuria during longitudinal follow-up in age and gender adjusted models. However, the longitudinal association was attenuated and became non-significant after adjustment for baseline blood pressure and other CVD risk factors, [21]. However, other studies have shown significant relationships between CFPWV and albuminuria [54–60]. The largest of the prior studies, CRIC and the Renal Risk in Derby studies, were cross-sectional analyses of patients with CKD and may represent changes already present in those with reduced kidney function [54,56].\n\nThe associations of measures of aortic stiffness and kidney disease measures in our study are significantly confounded by age. We observed strong relationships between age and measures of aortic stiffness and kidney disease. Aging is associated with decreased elasticity, decreased compliance, and increased vessel wall thickness, potentially resulting in both aortic stiffness and reduced GFR and albuminuria [5,6,8–12]. Because there are numerous changes that occur with age, many of which may be unmeasured, and because age precedes our outcomes of interest, age introduces confounding by baseline conditions as well as potential mechanisms along the causal pathway. Unfortunately, it is impossible to clarify these complicated relationships with the cross-sectional design of our study.\n\nThere are several strengths of our study. First, the study design is a population-based cohort that is representative of the Icelandic population at large. Second, the relatively large sample size provides sufficient power to examine even modest associations. The aortic tonometry protocol, including CFPWV and CPP, is highly standardized and has high correlation coefficients for reproducibility [9]. Additionally, the ascertainment of kidney disease included both ACR, a measure of kidney damage, as well as eGFR based on the combination of creatinine and cystatin C which has been shown to be more accurate and precise compared to either alone as a measure of kidney function.\n\nOur study also has several limitations. First, the population of Iceland is Caucasian which limits the generalizability of our findings to other races or ethnicities. However, the homogeneity of the population may allow a more accurate assessment of the true relationship between aortic stiffness and kidney disease. Survivor bias and regression dilution are introduced with the older age of the study population. Additionally, we have used estimated GFR instead of measured GFR as the primary measure for kidney function. Although measured GFR would provide the true quantification of kidney function, the estimated GFR is used more often in the clinical setting and is more practical. Lastly, this is a cross-sectional study and the direction of causality cannot be determined. Previous studies have suggested that baseline aortic stiffness is associated with subsequent changes in kidney function, although the relationship could be bidirectional [23]. The longitudinal nature of these associations should be more thoroughly explored to make any causal inferences.\n\nIn conclusion, aortic stiffness measured with CPP was related to albuminuria in a representative elderly Icelandic population; higher CPP was associated with higher levels of albuminuria, independent of age and CVD risk factors. CPP was not independently associated with lower eGFR. In contrast to previous literature, CFPWV was not associated with higher albuminuria or lower eGFR. However, the association of aortic stiffness to eGFR may be confounded by age and CVD risk factors, making it difficult to delineate the mechanisms of disease. Future studies are needed to explore the mechanism underlying CKD as well as better markers of vascular and kidney disease."
