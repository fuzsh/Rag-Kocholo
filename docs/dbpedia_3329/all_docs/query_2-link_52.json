The most frequently reported damage involves water resources and water-related ecosystems. Indirect effects in time and space, intrinsic recovery capacity, cascade impacts on socio-economic systems, and the lack of established monitoring activities appear to be the most challenging aspects for future research.\n\nAre flood damage models converging to ârealityâ?

However, the capacity of available flood damage models to depict real damages is questionable. With a joint effort of eight research groups, the objective of this study was to compare the performances of nine models for the estimation of flood damage to buildings. The comparison provided more objective insights on the transferability of the models and on the reliability of their estimations.\n\nTesting empirical and synthetic flood damage models: the case of Italy\n\nMattia Amadio, Anna Rita Scorzini, Francesca Carisi, Arthur H. Essenfelder, Alessio Domeneghetti, Jaroslav Mysiak, and Attilio Castellarin\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 661–678, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-661-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-661-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFlood risk management relies on assessments performed using flood loss models of different complexities. We compared the performances of expert-based and empirical damage models on three major flood events in northern Italy. Our findings suggest that multivariate models have better potential to provide reliable damage estimates if extensive ancillary characterisation data are available. Expert-based approaches are better suited for transferability compared to empirically based approaches.\n\nDevelopment and assessment of uni- and multivariable flood loss models for Emilia-Romagna (Italy)\n\nFrancesca Carisi, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, Alessio Domeneghetti, Heidi Kreibich, and Attilio Castellarin\n\nNat.

We develop empirical uni- and multivariable loss models for the residential sector. Outcomes highlight that the latter seem to outperform the former and, in addition, results show a higher accuracy of univariable models based on local data compared to literature ones derived for different contexts.\n\nEffects of anthropogenic land-subsidence on inundation dynamics: the case study of Ravenna, Italy\n\nFrancesca Carisi, Alessio Domeneghetti, and Attilio Castellarin\n\nProc.

In the area around Ravenna, in Italy, that experimented a cumulative drop of more than 1.5â¯m after World War II due to groundwater pumping and gas production platforms, we compared the actual effects on flood-hazard dynamics of differential land-subsidence relative to those associated with other man-made topographic alterations, which proved to be much more significant.\n\nClimate, orography and scale controls on flood frequency in Triveneto (Italy)\n\nSimone Persiano, Attilio Castellarin, Jose Luis Salinas, Alessio Domeneghetti, and Armando Brath\n\nProc.

Our study focuses on Triveneto (Italy) and proposes an update of the existing reference procedure by properly considering climate and scale controls on flood frequency. Moreover, the study highlights the remarkable influence of a single extreme-floods year on analyses for detecting possible changes in flood frequency regime.\n\nSimplified graphical tools for assessing flood-risk change over large flood-prone areas\n\nF. Carisi, A. Domeneghetti, and A. Castellarin\n\nProc. IAHS, 370, 209–215, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-370-209-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-370-209-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study proposes simplified graphical tools (Hypsometric Vulnerability Curves) for assessing the recent dynamics of the flood vulnerability and risk over a large floodable area along the River Po, Northern Italy, and for defining sustainable flood-risk mitigation strategies. We assess the accuracy of the proposed methodology, based on inundation scenarios simulated with a quasi-2D model, by means of a comparison with a traditional approach relying on the simulations of a to a fully-2D model.\n\nThe ability of a stochastic regional weather generator to reproduce heavy precipitation events across scales\n\nXiaoxiang Guan, Dung Viet Nguyen, Paul Voit, Bruno Merz, Maik Heistermann, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-143,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-143, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluated a multi-site stochastic regional weather generator (nsRWG) for its ability to capture the cross-scale extremity of high precipitation events (HPEs) in Germany. We generated 100 realizations of 72 years of daily synthetic precipitation data. The performance was assessed using WEI and xWEI indices, which measure event extremity across spatio-temporal scales. Results show nsRWG simulates well the extremity patterns of HPEs, though it overestimates short-duration, small-extent events.\n\nHeavy-tailed flood peak distributions: What is the effect of the spatial variability of rainfall and runoff generation?\n\nElena Macdonald, Bruno Merz, Viet Dung Nguyen, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-181,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-181, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFlood peak distributions indicate how likely the occurrence of an extreme flood is at a certain river. If the distribution has a so-called heavy tail, extreme floods are more likely than might be anticipated. We find heavier tails in small compared to large catchments, and that spatially variable rainfall leads to a lower occurrence probability of extreme floods. Spatially variable runoff does not show an effect. The results can improve estimations of occurrence probabilities of extreme floods.\n\nHESS Opinions: The sword of Damocles of the impossible flood\n\nAlberto Montanari, Bruno Merz, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2603–2615, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2603-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2603-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFloods often take communities by surprise, as they are often considered virtually impossible yet are an ever-present threat similar to the sword suspended over the head of Damocles in the classical Greek anecdote. We discuss four reasons why extremely large floods carry a risk that is often larger than expected. We provide suggestions for managing the risk of megafloods by calling for a creative exploration of hazard scenarios and communicating the unknown corners of the reality of floods.\n\nIt could have been much worse: spatial counterfactuals of the July 2021 flood in the Ahr valley, Germany\n\nSergiy Vorogushyn, Li Han, Heiko Apel, Viet Dung Nguyen, BjÃ¶rn Guse, Xiaoxiang Guan, Oldrich Rakovec, Husain Najafi, Luis Samaniego, and Bruno Merz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-97,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-97, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe July 2021 flood in Central Europe was one of the deadliest floods in Europe in the past decades and the most expensive flood in Germany. In this paper we show that the hydrological impact of this event in the Ahr valley could have been even worse if the rainfall footprint trajectory was only slightly different. The presented methodology of spatial counterfactuals generates plausible unprecedented events and helps better prepare for future extreme floods.\n\nQualitative flood risk assessment for road and railway infrastructures: the experience of the MOVIDA project\n\nNatasha Petruccelli, Luca Mantecchini, Alice Gallazzi, Daniela Molinari, Mohammed Hammouti, Marco Zazzeri, Simone Sterlacchini, Francesco Ballio, Armando Brath, and Alessio Domeneghetti\n\nProc. IAHS, 385, 407–413, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-385-407-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-385-407-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study illustrates the methodology developed for flood risk assessment for road and railway infrastructures. Through the creation of a detailed database, using different data sources, and the definition of a risk matrix, a risk level (High, Medium, Low and Null) is assigned to each section, considering the physical and functional characteristics of the infrastructure, as well as its relevance and the magnitude of the expected event.\n\nFlood damage model bias caused by aggregation\n\nSeth Bryant, Heidi Kreibich, and Bruno Merz\n\nProc. IAHS, 386, 181–187, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-386-181-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-386-181-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study found that simplifying data in flood risk models can introduce errors. We tested 344 damage functions and found errors up to 40 % of the total asset value. This means large-scale flood risk assessments may have significant errors due to the modelling approach. Our research highlights the need for more attention to data aggregation in flood risk models.\n\nInvited perspectives: Safeguarding the usability and credibility of flood hazard and risk assessments\n\nBruno Merz, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, Robert JÃ¼pner, Heidi Kreibich, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-856,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-856, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe discuss the validation of flood hazard and risk assessments (FHRAs) to ensure they are useful for decision-making. We propose a new validation framework that considers not only technical aspects but also the real-world context in which decisions are made. By applying this framework to flood emergency planning, we demonstrate its practicality.\n\nBrief communication: On the environmental impacts of the 2023 floods in Emilia-Romagna (Italy)\n\nChiara Arrighi and Alessio Domeneghetti\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 673–679, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-673-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-673-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this communication, we reflect on environmental flood impacts by analysing the reported environmental consequences of the 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods. The most frequently reported damage involves water resources and water-related ecosystems. Indirect effects in time and space, intrinsic recovery capacity, cascade impacts on socio-economic systems, and the lack of established monitoring activities appear to be the most challenging aspects for future research.\n\nWhat controls the tail behaviour of flood series: rainfall or runoff generation?\n\nElena Macdonald, Bruno Merz, BjÃ¶rn Guse, Viet Dung Nguyen, Xiaoxiang Guan, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 833–850, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-833-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-833-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn some rivers, the occurrence of extreme flood events is more likely than in other rivers – they have heavy-tailed distributions. We find that threshold processes in the runoff generation lead to such a relatively high occurrence probability of extremes. Further, we find that beyond a certain return period, i.e. for rare events, rainfall is often the dominant control compared to runoff generation. Our results can help to improve the estimation of the occurrence probability of extreme floods.\n\nTechnical Note: Resolution enhancement of flood inundation grids\n\nSeth Bryant, Guy Schumann, Heiko Apel, Heidi Kreibich, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 575–588, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-575-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-575-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new algorithm has been developed to quickly produce high-resolution flood maps. It is faster and more accurate than current methods and is available as open-source scripts. This can help communities better prepare for and mitigate flood damages without expensive modelling.\n\nExploring the use of seasonal forecasts to adapt flood insurance premiums\n\nViet Dung Nguyen, Jeroen Aerts, Max Tesselaar, Wouter Boutzen, Heidi Kreibich, Lorenzo Alfieri, and Bruno Merz\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2862,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2862, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study explored how seasonal flood forecasts could enhance insurance premium accuracy. Insurers traditionally rely on historical data, yet climate fluctuations influence flood risk. We employed a method that predicts seasonal floods to adjust premiums accordingly. Our findings showed significant year-to-year variations in flood risk and premiums, underscoring the importance of adaptability. Despite limitations, this research aids insurers in preparing for evolving risks.\n\nPanta Rhei benchmark dataset: socio-hydrological data of paired events of floods and droughts\n\nHeidi Kreibich, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, Giuliano Di Baldassarre, Anne F.

We present a dataset containing data of paired events, i.e. two floods or two droughts that occurred in the same area. The dataset enables comparative analyses and allows detailed context-specific assessments. Additionally, it supports the testing of socio-hydrological models.\n\nStreamflow data availability in Europe: a detailed dataset of interpolated flow-duration curves\n\nSimone Persiano, Alessio Pugliese, Alberto Aloe, Jon Olav SkÃ¸ien, Attilio Castellarin, and Alberto Pistocchi\n\nEarth Syst.

FDCs at ungauged sites are estimated by means of a geostatistical procedure starting from data observed at about 3000 sites across Europe.\n\nBrief communication: Impact forecasting could substantially improve the emergency management of deadly floods: case study JulyÂ 2021 floods in Germany\n\nHeiko Apel, Sergiy Vorogushyn, and Bruno Merz\n\nNat.

The detailed spatial forecast of floods and flood impacts is a large step forward from the currently operational forecasts of discharges at selected gauges, thus enabling a more targeted flood management and early warning.\n\nMachine-learning blends of geomorphic descriptors: value and limitations for flood hazard assessment across large floodplains\n\nAndrea Magnini, Michele Lombardi, Simone Persiano, Antonio Tirri, Francesco Lo Conti, and Attilio Castellarin\n\nNat.

We investigate this approach with particular attention to (a) the comparison with a selected single-descriptor approach, (b) the goodness of decision trees, and (c) the performance of these models when applied to data-scarce regions. We find promising pathways for future research.\n\nRecurrence analysis of extreme event-like data\n\nAbhirup Banerjee, Bedartha Goswami, Yoshito Hirata, Deniz Eroglu, Bruno Merz, JÃ¼rgen Kurths, and Norbert Marwan\n\nNonlin.

A regional attribution analysis in Europe\n\nMiriam Bertola, Alberto Viglione, Sergiy Vorogushyn, David Lun, Bruno Merz, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

In northwestern and eastern Europe, changes in small and large floods are driven mainly by one single driver (i.e. extreme precipitation and snowmelt, respectively). In southern Europe both antecedent soil moisture and extreme precipitation significantly contribute to flood changes, and their relative importance depends on flood magnitude.\n\nInventory of dams in Germany\n\nGustavo Andrei Speckhann, Heidi Kreibich, and Bruno Merz\n\nEarth Syst.

Data about dams are crucial for practitioners, scientists, and policymakers. We present the most comprehensive open-access dam inventory for Germany to date. The inventory combines multiple sources of information. It comprises 530 dams with information on name, location, river, start year of construction and operation, crest length, dam height, lake area, lake volume, purpose, dam structure, and building characteristics.\n\nAre flood damage models converging to ârealityâ?

However, the capacity of available flood damage models to depict real damages is questionable. With a joint effort of eight research groups, the objective of this study was to compare the performances of nine models for the estimation of flood damage to buildings. The comparison provided more objective insights on the transferability of the models and on the reliability of their estimations.\n\nComparing Bayesian and traditional end-member mixing approaches for hydrograph separation in aÂ glacierized basin\n\nZhihua He, Katy Unger-Shayesteh, Sergiy Vorogushyn, Stephan M. Weise, Doris Duethmann, Olga Kalashnikova, Abror Gafurov, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Our study provides the first comparison of two end-member mixing approaches for hydrograph separation in glacierized basins.\n\nEvent generation for probabilistic flood risk modelling: multi-site peak flow dependence model vs.Â weather-generator-based approach\n\nBenjamin Winter, Klaus Schneeberger, Kristian FÃ¶rster, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 1689–1703, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-1689-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-1689-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper two different methods to generate spatially coherent flood events for probabilistic flood risk modelling are compared: on the one hand, a semi-conditional multi-variate dependence model applied to discharge observations and, on the other hand, a continuous hydrological modelling of synthetic meteorological fields generated by a multi-site weather generator. The results of the two approaches are compared in terms of simulated spatial patterns and overall flood risk estimates.\n\nOptimal design of hydrometric station networks based on complex network analysis\n\nAnkit Agarwal, Norbert Marwan, Rathinasamy Maheswaran, Ugur Ozturk, JÃ¼rgen Kurths, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Here, using network theory, we first generate a node-ranking measure and then prioritize the rain gauges to identify influential and expandable stations across Germany. To show the applicability of the proposed approach, we also compared the results with existing traditional and contemporary network measures.\n\nThe role of spatial dependence for large-scale flood risk estimation\n\nAyse Duha Metin, Nguyen Viet Dung, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, Sergiy Vorogushyn, BjÃ¶rn Guse, Heidi Kreibich, and Bruno Merz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 967–979, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-967-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-967-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor effective risk management, flood risk should be properly assessed. Traditionally, risk is assessed by making the assumption of invariant flow or loss probabilities (the chance that a given discharge or loss is exceeded) within the river catchment during a single flood event. However, in reality, flooding is more severe in some regions than others. This study indicates the importance of representing the spatial dependence of flood peaks and damage for risk assessments.\n\nThe role of flood wave superposition in the severity of large floods\n\nBjÃ¶rn Guse, Bruno Merz, Luzie Wietzke, Sophie Ullrich, Alberto Viglione, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1633–1648, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1633-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1633-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFloods are influenced by river network processes, among others. Flood characteristics of tributaries may affect flood severity downstream of confluences. The impact of flood wave superposition is investigated with regard to magnitude and temporal matching of flood peaks. Our study in Germany and Austria shows that flood wave superposition is not the major driver of flood severity. However, there is the potential for large floods at some confluences in cases of temporal matching of flood peaks.\n\nUnravelling the spatial diversity of Indian precipitation teleconnections via a non-linear multi-scale approach\n\nJÃ¼rgen Kurths, Ankit Agarwal, Roopam Shukla, Norbert Marwan, Maheswaran Rathinasamy, Levke Caesar, Raghavan Krishnan, and Bruno Merz\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 26, 251–266, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-26-251-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-26-251-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe examined the spatial diversity of Indian rainfall teleconnection at different timescales, first by identifying homogeneous communities and later by computing non-linear linkages between the identified communities (spatial regions) and dominant climatic patterns, represented by climatic indices such as El Nino–Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation.\n\nStochastic generation of spatially coherent river discharge peaks for continental event-based flood risk assessment\n\nDirk Diederen, Ye Liu, Ben Gouldby, Ferdinand Diermanse, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 1041–1053, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-1041-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-19-1041-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFloods affect many communities and cause a large amount of damage worldwide. Since we choose to live in natural flood plains and are unable to prevent all floods, a system of insurance and reinsurance was set up. For these institutes to not fail, estimates are required of the frequency of large-scale flood events. We explore a new method to obtain a large catalogue of synthetic, spatially coherent, large-scale river discharge events, using a recent (gridded) European discharge data set.\n\nTesting empirical and synthetic flood damage models: the case of Italy\n\nMattia Amadio, Anna Rita Scorzini, Francesca Carisi, Arthur H. Essenfelder, Alessio Domeneghetti, Jaroslav Mysiak, and Attilio Castellarin\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

We compared the performances of expert-based and empirical damage models on three major flood events in northern Italy. Our findings suggest that multivariate models have better potential to provide reliable damage estimates if extensive ancillary characterisation data are available. Expert-based approaches are better suited for transferability compared to empirically based approaches.\n\nClimate influences on flood probabilities across Europe\n\nEva Steirou, Lars Gerlitz, Heiko Apel, Xun Sun, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1305–1322, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1305-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1305-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate whether flood probabilities in Europe vary for different large-scale atmospheric circulation conditions. Maximum seasonal river flows from 600 gauges in Europe and five synchronous atmospheric circulation indices are analyzed. We find that a high percentage of stations is influenced by at least one of the climate indices, especially during winter. These results can be useful for preparedness and damage planning by (re-)insurance companies.\n\nJoint editorial: Invigorating hydrological research through journal publications\n\nNevil Quinn, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, AndrÃ¡s BÃ¡rdossy, Attilio Castellarin, Martyn Clark, Christophe Cudennec, Demetris Koutsoyiannis, Upmanu Lall, Lubomir Lichner, Juraj Parajka, Christa D.

Results show that changes in dike systems or in vulnerability may outweigh changes in often investigated components, such as climate change. Although the specific results are conditional on the case study and assumptions, they highlight the need for a broader consideration of potential drivers of change in a comprehensive way.\n\nTowards risk-based flood management in highly productive paddy rice cultivation â concept development and application to the Mekong Delta\n\nNguyen Van Khanh Triet, Nguyen Viet Dung, Bruno Merz, and Heiko Apel\n\nNat.

The derived modelling concept explicitly takes plant phenomenology and timing of floods in a probabilistic modelling framework into account. This results in spatially explicit flood risk maps to rice cultivation, quantified as expected annual damage. Furthermore, the changes in flood risk of two land-use scenarios were estimated and discussed.\n\nJoint editorial: Invigorating hydrological research through journal publications\n\nNevil Quinn, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, AndrÃ¡s BÃ¡rdossy, Attilio Castellarin, Martyn Clark, Christophe Cudennec, Demetris Koutsoyiannis, Upmanu Lall, Lubomir Lichner, Juraj Parajka, Christa D.

Numerous scholars have problematized this approach and shown that increasing levels of flood protection can generate a false sense of security and attract more people to the risky areas. We briefly review the literature on this topic and then propose a research agenda to explore the unintended consequences of structural flood protection.\n\nMulti-hazard fragility analysis for fluvial dikes in earthquake- and flood-prone areas\n\nSergey Tyagunov, Sergiy Vorogushyn, Cristina MuÃ±oz Jimenez, Stefano Parolai, and Kevin Fleming\n\nNat.

Failure probability of the earthen structures is presented in the form of a fragility surface as a function of both seismic and hydraulic load.

In our method, one can get enhanced streamflow simulations without any further model calibration. Indeed, this method is neither computational nor data-intensive and is implemented only using observed streamflow data and a GIS vector layer with catchment boundaries. Assessments are performed in the Tyrol region.\n\nDevelopment and assessment of uni- and multivariable flood loss models for Emilia-Romagna (Italy)\n\nFrancesca Carisi, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, Alessio Domeneghetti, Heidi Kreibich, and Attilio Castellarin\n\nNat.

We develop empirical uni- and multivariable loss models for the residential sector. Outcomes highlight that the latter seem to outperform the former and, in addition, results show a higher accuracy of univariable models based on local data compared to literature ones derived for different contexts.\n\nEstimating parameter values of a socio-hydrological flood model\n\nMarlies Holkje Barendrecht, Alberto Viglione, Heidi Kreibich, Sergiy Vorogushyn, Bruno Merz, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nProc.

This is not trivial because the model is highly nonlinear and it is not clear what amount of data would be needed for calibration. We demonstrate that, using Bayesian inference, the parameters of the model can be estimated quite accurately from relatively few data, which could be available in real case studies.\n\nStatistical forecast of seasonal discharge in Central Asia using observational records: development of a generic linear modelling tool for operational water resource management\n\nHeiko Apel, Zharkinay Abdykerimova, Marina Agalhanova, Azamat Baimaganbetov, Nadejda Gavrilenko, Lars Gerlitz, Olga Kalashnikova, Katy Unger-Shayesteh, Sergiy Vorogushyn, and Abror Gafurov\n\nHydrol.

To support water resources management we propose a generic tool for statistical forecasts of seasonal discharge based on multiple linear regressions. The predictors are observed precipitation and temperature, snow coverage, and discharge. The automatically derived models for 13 different catchments provided very skilful forecasts in April, and acceptable forecasts in January.\n\nWhat controls the stable isotope composition of precipitation in the Mekong Delta?

The impact of the different factors on the isotopic condition was quantified by multiple linear regression of all factor combinations combined with relative importance analysis. The proposed approach might open a pathway for the improved reconstruction of paleoclimates based on isotopic records.\n\nMulti-scale event synchronization analysis for unravelling climate processes: a wavelet-based approach\n\nAnkit Agarwal, Norbert Marwan, Maheswaran Rathinasamy, Bruno Merz, and JÃ¼rgen Kurths\n\nNonlin.

This study shows that skilled seasonal forecasts can be achieved with statistical methods built upon driving factors for drought occurrence. These are the hydrological factors for current streamflow and meteorological drivers represented by anomalies in sea surface temperatures of the surrounding oceans, which combine to form unique combinations in the drought forecast models.\n\nA statistically based seasonal precipitation forecast model with automatic predictor selection and its application to central and south Asia\n\nLars Gerlitz, Sergiy Vorogushyn, Heiko Apel, Abror Gafurov, Katy Unger-Shayesteh, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol.

However, for many target regions, these indices do not lead to sufficient results and customized predictors are required for an accurate prediction. This study presents a statistically based routine, which automatically identifies suitable predictors from globally gridded SST and climate variables by means of an extensive data mining procedure.\n\nCan local climate variability be explained by weather patterns? A multi-station evaluation for the Rhine basin\n\nAline Murawski, Gerd BÃ¼rger, Sergiy Vorogushyn, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

A downscaling based on conditioning a stochastic weather generator on weather patterns is a promising approach. Here the link between patterns and local climate is tested, and the skill of GCMs in reproducing these patterns is evaluated.\n\nEffects of anthropogenic land-subsidence on inundation dynamics: the case study of Ravenna, Italy\n\nFrancesca Carisi, Alessio Domeneghetti, and Attilio Castellarin\n\nProc.

Our study focuses on Triveneto (Italy) and proposes an update of the existing reference procedure by properly considering climate and scale controls on flood frequency. Moreover, the study highlights the remarkable influence of a single extreme-floods year on analyses for detecting possible changes in flood frequency regime.\n\nCombined fluvial and pluvial urban flood hazard analysis: concept development and application to Can Tho city, Mekong Delta, Vietnam\n\nHeiko Apel, Oriol MartÃ­nezÂ Trepat, Nguyen Nghia Hung, Do Thi Chinh, Bruno Merz, and Nguyen Viet Dung\n\nNat.

Often, level and velocity sensors are placed on bridges, which may disturb the flow. Using accurate numerical models, we explored the entropy model reliability nearby a multi-arch bridge. We found that it is better to place sensors and to estimate the discharge upstream of bridges; downstream, the entropy model needs the river-wide distribution of surface velocity as input data.\n\nIsotopic evaluation of the National Water Model reveals missing agricultural irrigation contributions to streamflow across the western United States\n\nAnnie L.

We used a coupled catchment–lake model to investigate future changes in the timing of spring discharge, ice-off, spring phytoplankton peak, and onset of stratification in a mesotrophic lake. We found a clear trend towards earlier occurrence under climate warming but also that relative shifts in the timing occurred, such as onset of stratification advancing more slowly than the other events.\n\nEffects of high-quality elevation data and explanatory variables on the accuracy of flood inundation mapping via Height Above Nearest Drainage\n\nFernando Aristizabal, Taher Chegini, Gregory Petrochenkov, Fernando Salas, and Jasmeet Judge\n\nHydrol.

In this study we have shown that the decreasing levels of the Groß Glienicker Lake in Germany are not simply the result of changes in climate, but it is affected by other processes. In our example reduced inflow from a growing forest, regionally sinking groundwater levels and the modifications in the local rainwater infrastructure together resulted in an increasing lake level loss.\n\nUnderstanding the compound flood risk along the coast of the contiguous United States\n\nDongyu Feng, Zeli Tan, Donghui Xu, and L.

Skilful lake seasonal predictions require better weather predictions and realistic antecedent conditions.\n\nPast and future climate change effects on the thermal regime and oxygen solubility of four peri-alpine lakes\n\nOlivia DesguÃ©-Itier, Laura Melo Vieira Soares, Orlane Anneville, Damien Bouffard, Vincent Chanudet, Pierre Alain Danis, Isabelle Domaizon, Jean Guillard, ThÃ©o Mazure, Najwa Sharaf, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Soulignac, Viet Tran-Khac, Brigitte VinÃ§on-Leite, and Jean-Philippe Jenny\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 837–859, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-837-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-837-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe long-term effects of climate change will include an increase in lake surface and deep water temperatures. Incorporating up to 6 decades of limnological monitoring into an improved 1D lake model approach allows us to predict the thermal regime and oxygen solubility in four peri-alpine lakes over the period 1850–2100. Our modeling approach includes a revised selection of forcing variables and provides a way to investigate the impacts of climate variations on lakes for centennial timescales.\n\nExploring tracer information in a small stream to improve parameter identifiability and enhance the process interpretation in transient storage models\n\nEnrico Bonanno, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, and Julian Klaus\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6003–6028, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6003-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6003-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is an unclear understanding of which processes regulate the transport of water, solutes, and pollutants in streams. This is crucial since these processes control water quality in river networks. Compared to other approaches, we obtained clearer insights into the processes controlling solute transport in the investigated reach. This work highlights the risks of using uncertain results for interpreting the processes controlling water movement in streams.\n\nHow do inorganic nitrogen processing pathways change quantitatively at daily, seasonal, and multiannual scales in a large agricultural stream?\n\nJingshui Huang, Dietrich Borchardt, and Michael Rode\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5817–5833, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5817-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5817-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we set up a water quality model using a 5-year paired high-frequency water quality dataset from a large agricultural stream. The simulations were compared with the 15 min interval measurements and showed very good fits. Based on these, we quantified the N uptake pathway rates and efficiencies at daily, seasonal, and yearly scales. This study offers an overarching understanding of N processing in large agricultural streams across different temporal scales.\n\nSeasonal forecasting of lake water quality and algal bloom risk using a continuous Gaussian Bayesian network\n\nLeah A. Jackson-Blake, FranÃ§ois Clayer, Sigrid Haande, James E. Sample, and S. Jannicke Moe\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3103–3124, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3103-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3103-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a Gaussian Bayesian network (GBN) for seasonal forecasting of lake water quality and algal bloom risk in a nutrient-impacted lake in southern Norway. Bayesian networks are powerful tools for environmental modelling but are almost exclusively discrete. We demonstrate that a continuous GBN is a promising alternative approach. Predictive performance of the GBN was similar or improved compared to a discrete network, and it was substantially less time-consuming and subjective to develop.\n\nSpatially referenced Bayesian state-space model of total phosphorus in western Lake Erie\n\nTimothy J. Maguire, Craig A. Stow, and Casey M. Godwin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 1993–2017, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1993-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1993-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWater within large water bodies is constantly moving. Consequently, water movement masks causal relationships that exist between rivers and lakes. Incorporating water movement into models of nutrient concentration allows us to predict concentrations at unobserved locations and at observed locations on days not sampled. Our modeling approach does this while accommodating nutrient concentration data from multiple sources and provides a way to experimentally define the impact of rivers on lakes.\n\nFuture water temperature of rivers in Switzerland under climate change investigated with physics-based models\n\nAdrien Michel, Bettina Schaefli, Nander Wever, Harry Zekollari, Michael Lehning, and Hendrik Huwald\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 1063–1087, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1063-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1063-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents an extensive study of climate change impacts on river temperature in Switzerland. Results show that, even for low-emission scenarios, water temperature increase will lead to adverse effects for both ecosystems and socio-economic sectors throughout the 21st century. For high-emission scenarios, the effect will worsen. This study also shows that water seasonal warming will be different between the Alpine regions and the lowlands. Finally, efficiency of models is assessed.\n\nPhysical controls and a priori estimation of raising land surface elevation across the southwestern Bangladesh delta using tidal river management\n\nMd Feroz Islam, Paul P. Schot, Stefan C. Dekker, Jasper Griffioen, and Hans Middelkoop\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 903–921, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-903-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-903-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe potential of sedimentation in the lowest parts of polders (beels) through controlled flooding with dike breach (tidal river management – TRM) to counterbalance relative sea level rise (RSLR) in 234 beels of SW Bangladesh is determined in this study, using 2D models and multiple regression. Lower beels located closer to the sea have the highest potential. Operating TRM only during the monsoon season is sufficient to raise the land surface of most beels by more than 3 times the yearly RSLR.\n\nEvaluation and interpretation of convolutional long short-term memory networks for regional hydrological modelling\n\nSam Anderson and Valentina RadiÄ\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 795–825, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-795-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-795-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop and interpret a spatiotemporal deep learning model for regional streamflow prediction at more than 200 stream gauge stations in western Canada. We find the novel modelling style to work very well for daily streamflow prediction. Importantly, we interpret model learning to show that it has learned to focus on physically interpretable and physically relevant information, which is a highly desirable quality of machine-learning-based hydrological models.\n\nSynthesizing the impacts of baseflow contribution on concentrationâdischarge (CâQ) relationships across Australia using a Bayesian hierarchical model\n\nDanlu Guo, Camille Minaudo, Anna Lintern, Ulrike Bende-Michl, Shuci Liu, Kefeng Zhang, and ClÃ©ment Duvert\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 1–16, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the impact of baseflow contribution on concentration–flow (C–Q) relationships across the Australian continent. We developed a novel Bayesian hierarchical model for six water quality variables across 157 catchments that span five climate zones. For sediments and nutrients, the C–Q slope is generally steeper for catchments with a higher median and a greater variability of baseflow contribution, highlighting the key role of variable flow pathways in particulate and solute export.\n\nCalibrating 1D hydrodynamic river models in the absence of cross-section geometry using satellite observations of water surface elevation and river width\n\nLiguang Jiang, Silja Westphal Christensen, and Peter Bauer-Gottwein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 6359–6379, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6359-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6359-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRiver roughness and geometry are essential to hydraulic river models. However, measurements of these quantities are not available in most rivers globally. Nevertheless, simultaneous calibration of channel geometric parameters and roughness is difficult as they compensate for each other. This study introduces an alternative approach of parameterization and calibration that reduces parameter correlations by combining cross-section geometry and roughness into a conveyance parameter.\n\nA global algorithm for identifying changing streamflow regimes: application to Canadian natural streams (1966â2010)\n\nMasoud Zaerpour, Shadi Hatami, Javad Sadri, and Ali Nazemi\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 5193–5217, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5193-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5193-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStreamflow regimes are changing globally particularly in cold regions. We develop a novel algorithm for detecting shifting streamflow regimes using changes in first and second moments of ensemble streamflow features. This algorithm is generic and can be used globally. To showcase its application, we assess alterations in Canadian natural streams from 1966 to 2010 to provide the first temporally consistent, pan-Canadian assessment of change in natural streamflow regimes, coast to coast to coast.\n\nStreamflow drought: implication of drought definitions and its application for drought forecasting\n\nSamuel J. Sutanto and Henny A. J. Van Lanen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 3991–4023, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3991-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3991-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive overview of the differences within streamflow droughts derived using different identification approaches, namely the variable threshold, fixed threshold, and the Standardized Streamflow Index, including an analysis of both historical drought and implications for forecasting. Our results clearly show that streamflow droughts derived from different approaches deviate from each other in terms of drought occurrence, timing, duration, and deficit volume.\n\nQuantifying floodwater impacts on a lake water budget via volume-dependent transient stable isotope mass balance\n\nJanie Masse-Dufresne, Florent Barbecot, Paul Baudron, and John Gibson\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 3731–3757, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3731-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3731-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA volume-dependent transient isotopic mass balance model was developed for an artificial lake in Canada, in a context where direct measurements of surface water fluxes are difficult. It revealed that floodwater inputs affected the dynamics of the lake in spring but also significantly influenced the long-term water balance due to temporary subsurface storage of floodwater. Such models are paramount for understanding the vulnerability of lakes to changes in groundwater quantity and quality.\n\nRiver runoff in Switzerland in a changing climate â changes in moderate extremes and their seasonality\n\nRegula Muelchi, Ole RÃ¶ssler, Jan Schwanbeck, Rolf Weingartner, and Olivia Martius\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 3577–3594, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3577-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3577-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study analyses changes in magnitude, frequency, and seasonality of moderate low and high flows for 93 catchments in Switzerland. In lower-lying catchments (below 1500 m a.s.l.), moderate low-flow magnitude (frequency) will decrease (increase). In Alpine catchments (above 1500 m a.s.l.), moderate low-flow magnitude (frequency) will increase (decrease). Moderate high flows tend to occur more frequent, and their magnitude increases in most catchments except some Alpine catchments.\n\nRiver runoff in Switzerland in a changing climate â runoff regime changes and their time of emergence\n\nRegula Muelchi, Ole RÃ¶ssler, Jan Schwanbeck, Rolf Weingartner, and Olivia Martius\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 3071–3086, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3071-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3071-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRunoff regimes in Switzerland will change significantly under climate change. Projected changes are strongly elevation dependent with earlier time of emergence and stronger changes in high-elevation catchments where snowmelt and glacier melt play an important role. The magnitude of change and the climate model agreement on the sign increase with increasing global mean temperatures and stronger emission scenarios. This amplification highlights the importance of climate change mitigation.\n\nMachine-learning methods for stream water temperature prediction\n\nMoritz Feigl, Katharina Lebiedzinski, Mathew Herrnegger, and Karsten Schulz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 2951–2977, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2951-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2951-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we developed machine learning approaches for daily river water temperature prediction, using different data preprocessing methods, six model types, a range of different data inputs and 10 study catchments. By comparing to current state-of-the-art models, we could show a significant improvement of prediction performance of the tested approaches. Furthermore, we could gain insight into the relationships between model types, input data and predicted stream water temperature.\n\nBathymetry and latitude modify lake warming under ice\n\nCintia L. RamÃ³n, Hugo N. Ulloa, Tomy Doda, Kraig B. Winters, and Damien Bouffard\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1813–1825, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1813-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1813-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen solar radiation penetrates the frozen surface of lakes, shallower zones underneath warm faster than deep interior waters. This numerical study shows that the transport of excess heat to the lake interior depends on the lake circulation, affected by Earth's rotation, and controls the lake warming rates and the spatial distribution of the heat flux across the ice–water interface. This work contributes to the understanding of the circulation and thermal structure patterns of ice-covered lakes.\n\nLake thermal structure drives interannual variability in summer anoxia dynamics in a eutrophic lake over 37Â years\n\nRobert Ladwig, Paul C. Hanson, Hilary A. Dugan, Cayelan C. Carey, Yu Zhang, Lele Shu, Christopher J. Duffy, and Kelly M. Cobourn\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1009–1032, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1009-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1009-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a modeling framework applied to 37 years of dissolved oxygen time series data from Lake Mendota, we identified the timing and intensity of thermal energy stored in the lake water column, the lake's resilience to mixing, and surface primary production as the most important drivers of interannual dynamics of low oxygen concentrations at the lake bottom. Due to climate change, we expect an increase in the spatial and temporal extent of low oxygen concentrations in Lake Mendota.\n\nReservoir evaporation in a Mediterranean climate: comparing direct methods in Alqueva Reservoir, Portugal\n\nCarlos Miranda Rodrigues, Madalena Moreira, Rita Cabral GuimarÃ£es, and Miguel Potes\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 5973–5984, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5973-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5973-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn Mediterranean environments, evaporation is a key component of reservoir water budgets. Prediction of surface evaporation becomes crucial for adequate reservoir water management. This study provides an applicable method for calculating evaporation based on pan measurements applied at Alqueva Reservoir (southern Portugal), one of the largest artificial lakes in Europe. Moreover, the methodology presented here could be applied to other Mediterranean reservoirs.\n\nDiverging hydrological drought traits over Europe with global warming\n\nCarmelo Cammalleri, Gustavo Naumann, Lorenzo Mentaschi, Bernard Bisselink, Emiliano Gelati, Ad De Roo, and Luc Feyen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 5919–5935, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5919-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5919-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change is anticipated to alter the demand and supply of water at the earth's surface. This study shows how hydrological droughts will change across Europe with increasing global warming levels, showing that at 3 K global warming an additional 11 million people and 4.5 ×106 ha of agricultural land will be exposed to droughts every year, on average. These effects are mostly located in the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions of Europe.\n\nAnthropogenic influence on the Rhine water temperatures\n\nAlex Zavarsky and Lars Duester\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 5027–5041, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5027-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5027-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRiver water temperature is an important parameter for water quality and an important variable for physical, chemical and biological processes. River water is also used as a cooling agent by power plants and production facilities. We study long-term trends in river water temperature and correlate them to meteorological influences and power production or economic indices.\n\nA new form of the Saint-Venant equations for variable topography\n\nCheng-Wei Yu, Ben R. Hodges, and Frank Liu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 4001–4024, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4001-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4001-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the effects of bottom slope discontinuity on the stability of numerical solutions for the Saint-Venant equations. A new reference slope concept is proposed to ensure smooth source terms and eliminate potential numerical oscillations. It is shown that a simple algebraic transformation of channel geometry provides a smooth reference slope while preserving the correct cross-sectional flow area and the piezometric pressure gradient that drives the flow.\n\nSimulations of future changes in thermal structure of Lake Erken: proof of concept for ISIMIP2b lake sector local simulation strategy\n\nAna I. Ayala, Simone Moras, and Donald C. Pierson\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 3311–3330, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3311-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3311-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impacts of different levels of global warming on the thermal structure of Lake Erken are assessed. We used the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) to simulate water temperature driven by meteorological scenarios supplied by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) and tested its ability at different frequencies. Then, daily ISIMIP meteorological scenarios were disaggregated and assessed for the effects of climate change on lake thermal structure.\n\nAssessment of the geomorphic effectiveness of controlled floods in a braided river using a reduced-complexity numerical model\n\nLuca Ziliani, Nicola Surian, Gianluca Botter, and Luca Mao\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 3229–3250, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3229-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3229-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlthough geomorphic recovery is a key issue in many rivers worldwide, controlled floods have been rarely designed using geomorphological criteria. An integrated approach is used to assess the effects of different controlled-flood scenarios in a strongly regulated river. None of the controlled-flood strategies provide significant morphological benefits. Nevertheless, this study represents a significant contribution for the management and restoration of highly disturbed rivers.\n\nWorldwide lake level trends and responses to background climate variation\n\nBenjamin M. Kraemer, Anton Seimon, Rita Adrian, and Peter B. McIntyre\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2593–2608, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2593-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2593-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLake levels go up and down due to natural variability in the climate. But the effects of natural variability on lake levels can sometimes be confused for the influence of humans. Here we used long-term data from 200 globally distributed lakes and an advanced statistical approach to show that the effects of natural variability on lake levels can be disentangled from other effects leading to better estimates of long-term changes that may be partially caused by humans.\n\nModeling inorganic carbon dynamics in the Seine River continuum in France\n\nAudrey Marescaux, Vincent Thieu, Nathalie Gypens, Marie Silvestre, and Josette Garnier\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2379–2398, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2379-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2379-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRivers have been recognized as an active part of the carbon cycle where transformations are associated with CO2 outgassing. To understand it, we propose a modeling approach with the biogeochemical model, pyNuts-Riverstrahler. We implemented it on the human-impacted Seine River. Sources of carbon to the river were characterized by field measurements in groundwater and in wastewater. Outgassing was the most important in streams, and peaks were simulated downstream of wastewater treatment effluent.\n\nA data-based predictive model for spatiotemporal variability in stream water quality\n\nDanlu Guo, Anna Lintern, J. Angus Webb, Dongryeol Ryu, Ulrike Bende-Michl, Shuci Liu, and Andrew William Western\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 827–847, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-827-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-827-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study developed predictive models to represent the spatial and temporal variation of stream water quality across Victoria, Australia. The model structures were informed by a data-driven approach, which identified the key controls of water quality variations from long-term records. These models are helpful to identify likely future changes in water quality and, in turn, provide critical information for developing management strategies to improve stream water quality.\n\nFlooding in the Mekong Delta: the impact of dyke systems on downstream hydrodynamics\n\nVo Quoc Thanh, Dano Roelvink, Mick van der Wegen, Johan Reyns, Herman Kernkamp, Giap Van Vinh, and Vo Thi Phuong Linh\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 189–212, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-189-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-189-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is a rice bowl of not only Vietnam, but also the world; agriculture is the main source of livelihood in the delta. The VMD is facing threats related to water management and hydraulic structures. Dykes are built to protect agricultural crops in the floodplains and may influence water regimes downstream in the VMD. If the VMD floodplains are completely protected by dykes, yearly mean water levels could increase by 3 cm (at Can Tho) and 1.5 cm (at My Thuan).\n\nReconstruction of the 1941Â GLOF process chain at Lake Palcacocha (Cordillera Blanca, Peru)\n\nMartin Mergili, Shiva P. Pudasaini, Adam Emmer, Jan-Thomas Fischer, Alejo Cochachin, and Holger Frey\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 93–114, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-93-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-93-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn 1941, the glacial lagoon Lake Palcacocha in the Cordillera Blanca (Peru) drained suddenly. The resulting outburst flood/debris flow consumed another lake and had a disastrous impact on the town of Huaraz 23 km downstream. We reconstuct this event through a numerical model to learn about the possibility of prediction of similar processes in the future. Remaining challenges consist of the complex process interactions and the lack of experience due to the rare occurrence of such process chains.\n\nHistorical modelling of changes in Lake Erken thermal conditions\n\nSimone Moras, Ana I. Ayala, and Don C. Pierson\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 5001–5016, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-5001-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-5001-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used a hydrodynamic model to reconstruct daily historical water temperature of Lake Erken (Sweden) between 1961 and 2017 to demonstrate the ongoing effect of climate change on lake thermal conditions. The results show that the lake has warmed most rapidly in the last 30 years and that it is now subject to a longer and more stable stratification. The methods used here to reconstruct historical water temperature records can be easily extended to other lakes.\n\nImproving lake mixing process simulations in the Community Land Model by using KÂ profile parameterization\n\nQunhui Zhang, Jiming Jin, Xiaochun Wang, Phaedra Budy, Nick Barrett, and Sarah E. Null\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 4969–4982, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4969-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4969-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe improved lake mixing process simulations by applying a vertical mixing scheme, K profile parameterization (KPP), in the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.5, developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The current vertical mixing scheme in CLM requires an arbitrarily enlarged eddy diffusivity to enhance water mixing. The coupled CLM-KPP considers a boundary layer for eddy development. The improved lake model provides an important tool for lake hydrology and ecosystem studies.\n\nUpgraded global mapping information for earth system modelling: an application to surface water depth at the ECMWF\n\nMargarita Choulga, Ekaterina Kourzeneva, Gianpaolo Balsamo, Souhail Boussetta, and Nils Wedi\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 4051–4076, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4051-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4051-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLakes influence weather and climate of regions, especially if several of them are located close by. Just by using upgraded lake depths, based on new or more recent measurements and geological methods of depth estimation, errors of lake surface water forecasts produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts became 12–20 % lower compared with observations for 27 lakes collected by the Finnish Environment Institute. For ice-off date forecasts errors changed insignificantly.\n\nSediment transport modelling in riverine environments: on the importance of grain-size distribution, sediment density, and suspended sediment concentrations at the upstream boundary\n\nJÃ©rÃ©my Lepesqueur, Renaud Hostache, NÃºria MartÃ­nez-Carreras, Emmanuelle MontargÃ¨s-Pelletier, and Christophe Hissler\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3901–3915, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3901-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3901-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article evaluates the influence of sediment representation in a sediment transport model. A short-term simulation is used to assess how far changing the sediment characteristics in the modelling experiment changes riverbed evolution and sediment redistribution during a small flood event. The study shows in particular that representing sediment with extended grain-size and grain-density distributions allows for improving model accuracy and performances.\n\nReplication of ecologically relevant hydrological indicators following a modified covariance approach to hydrological model parameterization\n\nAnnie Visser-Quinn, Lindsay Beevers, and Sandhya Patidar\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3279–3303, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3279-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3279-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ecological impact of changes in river flow may be explored through the simulation of ecologically relevant flow indicators. Traditional approaches to model parameterization are not well-suited for this. To this end, this paper considers the ability of a modified covariance approach, applied to five hydrologically diverse catchments. An overall improvement in consistency is observed, whilst timing and rate of change represent the best and worst replicated indicators respectively.\n\nLidar-based approaches for estimating solar insolation in heavily forested streams\n\nJeffrey J. Richardson, Christian E. Torgersen, and L. Monika Moskal\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2813–2822, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2813-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2813-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh stream temperatures can be detrimental to the survival of aquatic species such as endangered salmon. Stream temperatures can be reduced by shade provided by trees in riparian areas. Two lidar-based methods were effective at assessing stream shading. These methods can be used in place of expensive field measurements.\n\nNumerical study on the response of the largest lake in China to climate change\n\nDongsheng Su, Xiuqing Hu, Lijuan Wen, Shihua Lyu, Xiaoqing Gao, Lin Zhao, Zhaoguo Li, Juan Du, and Georgiy Kirillin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2093–2109, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2093-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2093-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, freshwater lake model simulation results, verified by satellite and buoy observation data, were used to quantify recent climate change effects on the thermal regime of the largest lake in China. Results indicate that the FLake model can reproduce the lake thermal pattern nicely. The lake surface is warming, while the lake bottom has no significant trend. Climate change also caused an earlier ice-off and later ice-on, leading to an obvious change in the energy balance of the lake.\n\nUnraveling the hydrological budget of isolated and seasonally contrasted subtropical lakes\n\nChloÃ© Poulin, Bruno Hamelin, Christine Vallet-Coulomb, Guinbe Amngar, Bichara Loukman, Jean-FranÃ§ois Cretaux, Jean-Claude Doumnang, Abdallah Mahamat Nour, Guillemette Menot, Florence Sylvestre, and Pierre Deschamps\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1705–1724, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1705-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1705-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the water budget of two intertropical lake systems in the absence of long-term hydrological monitoring. By coupling dry season isotopic data with satellite imagery, we were able to provide quantitative constrains on the hydrological balance and show that these two lake systems can be considered miniature analogs of Lake Chad, making them important targets in the future setup of any large-scale program on the hydro-climatic evolution in the Sahel region.\n\nFuture projections of temperature and mixing regime of European temperate lakes\n\nTom Shatwell, Wim Thiery, and Georgiy Kirillin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1533–1551, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1533-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1533-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used models to project future temperature and mixing in temperate lakes. Lakes will probably warm faster in winter than in summer, making ice less frequent and altering mixing. We found that the layers that form seasonally in lakes (ice, stratification) and water clarity affect how lakes accumulate heat. Seasonal changes in climate were thus important. This helps us better understand how different lake types respond to warming and which physical changes to expect in the future.\n\nConservative finite-volume forms of the Saint-Venant equations for hydrology and urban drainage\n\nBen R. Hodges\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1281–1304, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1281-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1281-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new derivation of the equations for one-dimensional open-channel flow in rivers and storm drainage systems has been developed. The new approach solves some long-standing problems for obtaining well-behaved solutions with conservation forms of the equations. This research was motivated by the need for highly accurate models of large-scale river networks and the storm drainage systems in megacities. Such models are difficult to create with existing equation forms.\n\nModelling Lake Titicaca's daily and monthly evaporation\n\nRamiro Pillco ZolÃ¡, Lars Bengtsson, Ronny Berndtsson, Belen MartÃ­-Cardona, Frederic SatgÃ©, Franck Timouk, Marie-Paule Bonnet, Luis Mollericon, Cesar Gamarra, and JosÃ© Pasapera\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 657–668, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-657-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-657-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe evaporation was computed at a daily time step and compared with the estimated evaporation using mean monthly meteorological observations. We found that the most reliable method of determining the annual lake evaporation is using the heat balance approach.\n\nPrincipal components of thermal regimes in mountain river networks\n\nDaniel J. Isaak, Charles H. Luce, Gwynne L. Chandler, Dona L. Horan, and Sherry P. Wollrab\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 6225–6240, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6225-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6225-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDescription of thermal regimes in flowing waters is key to understanding physical processes and improving bioassessments, but has been limited by sparse data sets. Using a large annual temperature data set from a mountainous area of the western U.S., we explored thermal regimes using principle component analysis. A small number of summary metrics adequately represented most of the variation in this data set given strong temporal coherence among sites.\n\nModelling the water balance of Lake Victoria (East Africa) â PartÂ 1: Observational analysis\n\nInne Vanderkelen, Nicole P. M. van Lipzig, and Wim Thiery\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 5509–5525, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5509-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5509-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa and one of the two major sources of the Nile river. The water level of Lake Victoria is determined by its water balance, consisting of lake precipitation and evaporation, inflow from rivers and lake outflow, controlled by two hydropower dams. Here, we present a water balance model for Lake Victoria, which closely represents the observed lake levels. The model results highlight the sensitivity of the lake level to human operations at the dam.\n\nCited articles\n\nAdB-Po-DISEG: Studio dei terreni di fondazione di un tratto campione degli argini maestri del fiume Po attraverso prospezioni geofisiche da eseguirsi mediante metodi sismici ed elettrici, ST1-12, Vol. 12, 2001 (in Italian).\n\nAdB-Po-GEOVIT: Definizione delle indagini di campo necessarie a defini"
