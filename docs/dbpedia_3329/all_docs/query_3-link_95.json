        "text": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nCurrently, about 800 million people are affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally. The number of CKD patients is expected to grow, including those patients at the most advanced CKD stage who require some form of kidney renal replacement therapy (KRTRRT ) to sustain life. Hemodialysis is by far the most frequent form of KRTRRT.\n\nHemodialysis faces two major challenges: first, the provision of access to affordable hemodialysis globally. It has been estimated that in 2010 about 9.7 million patients would have needed KRT while only 2.6 million had access to it. Projections indicate that in 2030 the number of patients in need for KRT will grow to 14.5 million, while only 5.4 million will have access to it. These numbers show that the gap between patients in need of KRT and those who will have access to it will widen from 7.1 million in 2010 to 9.1 in 2030. This shortfall in KRT is one of the widely unknow human catastrophes. Mitigating it will require highly innovative solutions.\n\nThe second challenge is making hemodialysis more physiological and more efficient. Contact of blood with the extracorporeal circuit results in a host of reactions, such as activation of complement, and immunological and inflammatory responses. Further, hemodynamic instability and hypoperfusion of vital organs during hemodialysis create systemic stress. Novel technologies, including highly biocompatible membranes and feedback systems are paths forward to improve the hemodialysis experience for patients and thus their quality of life. As it is highlighted by most studies, RRT delivered in its conventional way as short high-flux hemodialysis (12 hours a week) covers only about 15 to 20% of the excretory native kidney function. Such limited efficiency may explain in large part the so-called remaining kidney burden and the poor long-term outcomes of conventional RRT. Therefore, in an attempt of enhancing treatment efficiency in the future, new or combined approaches are clearly needed to enhance solute removal capacities in particular for middle-, large-, and protein bound uremic toxins.\n\nProf. Dr. Peter Kotanko\n\nProf. Dr. Bernard Canaud\n\nDr. K S Nayak\n\nGuest Editors\n\nManuscript Submission Information\n\nManuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All submissions that pass pre-check are peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.\n\nSubmitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a double-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Toxins is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI."
