        "text": "Introduction\n\nPregnant women commonly take drugs (medication) throughout their pregnancy, especially when afflicted with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, or infectious diseases (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus). About 97% take at least one drug, and about 31% take at least five drugs during pregnancy (Mitchell et al., 2011; Haas et al., 2018). Due to lack of clinical trials of drug candidates in pregnancy, a large proportion of approved drugs are prescribed off-label to pregnant women (Laroche et al., 2020). However, because pharmacokinetics of many drugs are modulated by pregnancy, such use may result in suboptimal dosing of pregnant women (Westin et al., 2018). To design optimal drug dosing regimens for pregnant women, it is important to quantify the pregnancy-induced changes in pharmacokinetics of drugs. However, such studies are logistically and ethically challenging. Therefore, an alternative is to predict these changes by first characterizing, using probe drugs, the magnitude of pregnancy-induced changes for a given drug clearance pathway. We have previously used this approach to predict the pregnancy-induced changes in pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (Ke et al., 2012, 2013; 2014a). Here, we extended this approach to drugs that are renally cleared via organic anion transporters (OATs) using published data of renal secretory clearance (CL) of probe drugs that are selectively transported by a single OAT.\n\nIn clinical practice, 32% of the top 200 prescribed drugs are renally eliminated (i.e., ≥25% of the absorbed dose is excreted unchanged in urine) (Morrissey et al., 2013). Many of these drugs taken by pregnant women are secreted by single or multiple OAT (OAT1–3), such as antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin) and antivirals (e.g., tenofovir, adefovir) (Mitchell et al., 2011; Leong et al., 2019). We have previously shown that P-glycoprotein- and/or OATP4C1-mediated secretory CL of digoxin is significantly increased during pregnancy (Hebert et al., 2008; Ke et al., 2014b). Likewise, the clearance of OAT-secreted drugs is also increased during pregnancy [e.g., amoxicillin and tenofovir (Andrew et al., 2007; Best et al., 2015)], suggesting that OAT activity is increased during pregnancy. To predict the magnitude of changes in OAT-mediated renal CL of drugs in pregnancy, we first quantified the magnitude of pregnancy-induced change in the activity of individual OATs (OAT1, 2, 3). This we did based on previously published renal secretory CL ( CLsec) and total renal CL ( CLrenal) of OAT probe substrate drugs (training dataset; OAT1: tenofovir, OAT2: acyclovir, OAT3: oseltamivir carboxylate) that are known to be predominately renally cleared (>75%) by a single OAT. Then, these pregnancy-induced fold-changes in individual OAT activity were used to predict the pregnancy-induced changes in renal secretory CL ( CLsecpregnant), renal CL ( CLrenalpregnant), and total CL ( CLtotalpregnant) of drugs transported by a single or multiple OATs (verification dataset; amoxicillin, pravastatin, cefazolin, and ketorolac, R-ketorolac, S-ketorolac). To do so, we estimated the fraction of drug transported by the individual OAT (1, 2, and 3) based on their in vitro transporter-mediated and passive clearance data in OAT- or mock-transfected cell lines. Predictions by any approach must be verified before it can be applied with confidence to other drugs. Therefore, to verify the above predictions, we compared the predicted and the observed CLsecpregnant, CLrenalpregnant, and CLtotalpregnant values of these drugs. We deemed our predictions successful if they fell within 80% to 125% of the observed values.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nPharmacokinetics Data Collection and Estimation of CLint,sec of Drugs.\n\nBriefly, renal total clearance ( CLrenal,B) of training drugs (tenofovir, acyclovir, oseltamivir carboxylate) and verification drugs (amoxicillin, cefazolin, pravastatin and ketorolac, R- ketorolac, S-ketorolac) in nonpregnant and pregnant women were obtained from the literature or estimated from the reported data. These data were available mostly for the 2nd and 3rd trimester. Except for acyclovir, where the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters were from two different cohort of women (pregnant and nonpregnant), for the remaining drugs, the pharmacokinetic parameters were from the same cohort of women studied, antenatal (oseltamivir carboxylate and ketorolac) and postpartum (≥6 weeks). We assumed pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from postpartum women had returned to levels of nonpregnant women prior to pregnancy. Observed intrinsic secretory CL ( CLint,sec), blood renal secretory CL ( CLsec,B) and blood renal total CL ( CLrenal,B) of tenofovir, oseltamivir carboxylate, cefazolin, and ketorolac were calculated from their reported CL/F (oral) or CL (intravenous). Observed CL of acyclovir was estimated by digitizing the reported concentration-time profile using WebPlotDigitizer (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/). Observed CLint,secand CLsec,B of amoxicillin and pravastatin were calculated from the reported CLrenal,B. Details of how these parameters were estimated are provided below ( , Step 1–3).\n\nFirst, CLrenal,B in both nonpregnant and pregnant women were estimated (if not already stated in the publications) using eqs. 1–4 (Choi et al., 2019):\n\nwhere CLtotal,B was the sum of the CLrenal,B and nonrenal clearance ( CLnon-renal,B). AUCinf was the area under the plasma concentration-time profile from zero to infinity. Oral bioavailability (F) and fraction excreted in the urine as unchanged drug ( fe) in nonpregnant women are provided in . F, fe, and CLnon-renal of tenofovir, acyclovir, oseltamivir carboxylate, cefazolin, and ketorolac were assumed to be unchanged by pregnancy. Blood to plasma ratio (BP) in nonpregnant or pregnant women was estimated using previous published methods (Uchimura et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2017). Clearances were normalized by the nonpregnant women’s body weight (i.e., postpartum weight for those women who were also studied antenatal) to take into account the effect of body weight on CL.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nfe a FafuaBPa\n\nCLint,sec\n\nCLint,PD\n\nReferenceNonpregnant1st Trimesterb2nd Trimester3rd TrimesterIn VitroIn Vivoc ml/min/kg ul/min/mg protein ml/min/kg Tenofovir0.810.250.990.580.49, 0.57NA1.390.43,0.650.100.01(Best et al., 2015)\n\n(Colbers et al., 2013)Acyclovir0.760.220.851.002.80NANA8.660.270.02De Miranda and Blum, 1983) (Kimberlin et al., 1998)Oseltamivir carboxylate0.930.790.970.673.437.455.704.390.100.01(Pillai et al., 2015)Amoxicillin0.580.930.850.673.68NA7.296.854.600.30(Andrew et al., 2007)Cefazolin0.801.000.180.554.40NA5.63NA1.700.11(Philipson et al., 1987)Pravastatin0.450.180.470.5613.51NA19.8222.940.160.01(Costantine et al., 2016)Ketorolac0.601.000.011.0046.94NANA64.3015.801.02(Kulo et al., 2012)S-ketorolac0.601.000.011.0062.51NANA103.6815.801.02(Kulo et al., 2017)R-ketorolac0.601.000.011.0038.30NANA49.6315.801.02(Kulo et al., 2017)\n\nThen, the observed CLsec,B and CLint,sec in nonpregnant and pregnant women was calculated from CLrenal,B using the well stirred model (eqs. 5 and 6) (Ladumor et al., 2019):\n\nwhere fraction unbound in blood ( fuB) was the ratio of fraction unbound in plasma (fu) and blood to plasma ratio in nonpregnant or pregnant women estimated using previous published methods (Dallmann et al., 2017b; Zhang et al., 2017). Renal blood flow ( Qrenal) were determined from gestational age, dependent renal plasma flow, and hematocrit (Hct, %) (Odutayo and Hladunewich, 2012; Dallmann et al., 2017a). Glomerular filtration rate ( GFRinulin) was based on inulin blood clearance in different trimesters (Koetje et al., 2011; Odutayo and Hladunewich, 2012). As justified by others, Freabs of the drugs was assumed to be negligible (Mathialagan et al., 2017).\n\nIn addition, gestational stage in our study was defined per US Department of Health and Human Services recommendations: 1–12 weeks as the 1st trimester, 13–28 weeks as the 2nd trimester, and 29–40 weeks as the 3rd trimester. Except for oseltamivir carboxylate, drug CL data for the remaining probe drugs were not available for the 1st trimester. Likewise, CL data for acyclovir and ketorolac in the 2nd trimester and cefazolin in the 3rd trimester were not available.\n\nDetermination of Modulation of OAT Activity during Pregnancy (Steps 4 and 5, ).\n\nAs reported in our previous study (Kumar et al., 2021), the in vivo passive diffusion clearance ( CLint,PD) of the drugs was estimated (eq. 7) from previously reported in vitro CLint,PD,invitro in transfected HEK293 cells (Mathialagan et al., 2017)\n\nwhere MPPGK (i.e. milligram of total proteins per gram of kidney) is 15 mg/g, and kidney weight is 4.3 g/kg body weight (Mathialagan et al., 2017).\n\nThen, the fold-change in OAT activity during pregnancy was calculated by eq. 8.\n\nwhere OATj indicates OAT1, OAT2, or OAT3 (training dataset; OAT1: tenofovir, OAT2: acyclovir, OAT3: oseltamivir carboxylate; these drugs were assumed to be solely secreted by the listed OAT). CLPD was assumed to be unchanged by pregnancy.\n\nDetermination of Fraction of the Verification Drug Transported by OATj.\n\nFraction transported by OATj ( ftOATj) of the verification drugs (amoxicillin, pravastatin, cefazolin and ketorolac, R-ketorolac, S-ketorolac) was calculated by eq. 9.\n\nwhere in vitro CLint,OAT j and relative activity factor ( RAFOAT j, 0.64, 7.3, and 4.1 for OAT1, OAT2, and OAT3, respectively) were obtained from a previous publication (Mathialagan et al., 2017). Then, ftOAT j was used to calculate the individual OAT-mediated CLint,OATjnon-pregnant of verification drugs in nonpregnant individuals by eq. 10.\n\nPrediction of CLsec, CLrenal, and CLtotal of the Verification Drugs in Pregnancy.\n\nBased on the above data, CLint,OATjpregnant of the verification drugs was calculated by multiplying fold-change in activity of each OAT at different gestational ages with CLint,OATjnon-pregnant in nonpregnant individuals (eq. 11). CLint,secpregnant was calculated from the total of individual CLint,OATjpregnant and the predicted in vivo CLint,PD (eq. 12). Further, CLsec,Bpregnant was estimated using well stirred model based on Qrenal and fuB during pregnancy (eq. 13). Finally, CLrenal,Bpregnant was determined from CLsec,Bpregnant, fuB, and GFRinulin during pregnancy (eq. 14). Freabs was assumed to be negligible (Mathialagan et al., 2017). Total clearance (based on blood concentrations) in pregnancy ( CLtotal,Bpregnant) was predicted using eq. 15, where nonrenal CL was assumed to be unaffected by pregnancy and calculated using eq. 16.\n\nPrediction of Change in CLsec and CLrenal or CLtotal of the Training and Verification Drugs in Pregnancy.\n\nThe ratio of the predicted CLsec,Bpregnant, CLrenal,Bpregnant, or CLtotal,Bpregnant and the corresponding clearance in nonpregnant women (i.e., fold-change in different trimesters) was estimated for the verification and training drugs. The latter was estimated as indicated above for the verification drugs (eqs. 11–16). That is, the small contribution of other OAT contributing to their secretion was taken into consideration.\n\nData Analysis.\n\nTo assess the accuracy of our predictions, the ratio of the predicted and the observed data and absolute average fold error (AAFE) in the predictions of verification drugs were calculated as follows:\n\nOur a priori acceptable range for the ratio was 0.8–1.25, i.e., the bioequivalence criteria.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHere, we predicted the CLsec,Bpregnant, CLrenal,Bpregnant, and CLtotal,Bpregnant of OAT drugs transported by single or multiple OATs. In doing so, we employed an experimental design not adopted by others when predicting renal CL of drugs (van Hasselt et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019). First, this is the first time that probe drug data, in combination with the RAF approach, have been used to predict CLsec and CLrenal of drugs during pregnancy. Others have reported using physiologically-based PK models to predict renal CL of OAT drugs during pregnancy. However, they have either ignored pregnancy-induced changes in renal secretion of these drugs or have concluded that such changes are absent (De Sousa Mendes et al., 2016; Dallmann et al., 2017b); second, we focused on predicting CLsec rather than CLrenal or CLtotal, as the latter two can be predicted well even when CLsec is poorly predicted, such as for drugs where CLsec is a small or a minor contributor to CLrenal; third, most publications use creatinine renal CL as a measure of glomerular filtration CL (Banfi et al., 2009; Garner et al.,2019; Wiles et al., 2020). However, creatinine is also secreted via OCT2 and OAT2 (Gutiérrez et al., 2014; Lepist et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2016), which could confound interpretation of changes in OAT/OCT activity during pregnancy. Therefore, we used inulin renal CL, a gold-standard measure of glomerular filtration CL, because it is not actively secreted (; Smith et al., 2008; Koetje et al., 2011).\n\nAs expected, the fraction of probe drugs transported by the OATs (training dataset) was more than 90% ( ). Further, there is no evidence of transporter-mediated reabsorption of tenofovir, acyclovir, or oseltamivir carboxylate, and the CLPD of these drugs is relatively small ( ). Therefore, tenofovir, acyclovir, and oseltamivir carboxylate can be used with confidence as selective in vivo probes of pregnancy-induced changes in OAT1, OAT2, and OAT3 activity, respectively.\n\nWe found that each OAT activity was induced by pregnancy to a different extent, with maximum induction of about 3-fold for OAT1 and OAT2 and about 2-fold for OAT3 ( ). The time course of this induction also varied, with OAT3 activity peaking earlier (1st trimester) than OAT1 (2nd trimester), whereas OAT2 activity peaked in the 3rd trimester. However, additional data at various gestational ages are needed to confirm this conclusion. This pattern of change in OAT activity during pregnancy may be driven by the pattern of changes in plasma concentration of pregnancy hormones as we have shown previously for induction of hepatic CYP3A4 (Zhang et al., 2015). For example, the plasma concentration of estradiol, progesterone, human chorionic gonadotropin, and relaxin peaks during 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester of human pregnancy, respectively (Steroid Endocrinology of Pregnancy, 2009; Cheung and Lafayette, 2013; Papageorgiou et al., 2013). Indeed, experiments with opossum kidney cells show that 17β-estradiol induces human renal OAT1 likely via the estrogen receptor α (Euteneuer et al., 2019). Expression of renal Oat2 mRNA level (slc22a7) increases 1.19- to 1.88-fold during pregnancy in mice (Yacovino et al., 2013), and mRNA expression of rat Oat2 is modestly upregulated by estradiol and progesterone (1.25- and 1.18-fold) but significantly downregulated by testosterone (0.27-fold) (Ljubojević et al., 2007). Last, the activity of OAT3 increased during pregnancy, and it was the highest in the 1st trimester. This trend was similar to the change in plasma concentration of human chorionic gonadotropin and relaxin (Cheung and Lafayette, 2013). These data of pregnancy-induced OAT induction are hypothesis-driving observations and should be followed up by experimental studies to determine the mechanism(s) of regulation of OAT transporters. An alternative explanation is that this OAT induction is a nonspecific change in the size and volume of kidneys and/or the length of proximal tubule during pregnancy (Cheung and Lafayette, 2013). However, such a change would likely result in the same extent and time-frame of induction of the OATs. Our data suggest that this is not the case ( ).\n\nBased on the changes in OAT activity during pregnancy, we successfully predicted the pregnancy-induced changes in CLsec,Bpregnant, CLrenal,Bpregnant, and CLtotal,Bpregnant of the verification drugs [amoxicillin, cefazolin, pravastatin, and ketorolac (R-ketorolac, S-ketorolac, and the racemic mixture)] ( , ). These predictions were within our a priori acceptance criteria (i.e., 0.80–1.25 fold of the observed value), except for CLsec,Bpregnant of amoxicillin in the 3rd trimester and cefazolin in the 2nd trimester, which were marginally outside (0.76 and 1.27, respectively) our acceptance criteria ( ). This highlights the importance of predicting the CLsec,Bpregnant rather than CLrenal,Bpregnant or CLtotal,Bpregnant of drugs.\n\nThere are a few limitations to our study. First, we assumed that the rate-determining step in renal secretory CL of the drugs was their OAT-mediated transport. That is, even though some of the probe and verification drugs are substrates of other transporters (basal and apical; see Supplemental Table 1), we assumed that their secretory CL was determined only by OATs. Given the low CLPD of the drugs, and assuming this value applies to the basal efflux CL of the drugs based on the extended CL model, this is a reasonable assumption (Patilea-Vrana and Unadkat, 2016). If this assumption is incorrect, then the proposed approach will work only if probe drugs are available that selectively report the activity of each of these alternative transporters. Second, we assumed that CLnon-renal of tenofovir, acyclovir, oseltamivir carboxylate, cefazolin, and ketorolac is not affected by pregnancy. About 20% of ketorolac is metabolized by UGT enzyme and 9%–14% of acyclovir is metabolized by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. However, these enzymes may not be affected by human pregnancy (Mroszczak et al., 1987; De Miranda and Good, 1992; Anderson, 2005; Jelski et al., 2020). Third, the pharmacokinetics of the drugs in postpartum women were assumed to have returned to those in nonpregnant women prior to pregnancy. Indeed, comparison of their postpartum pharmacokinetics with those in nonpregnant individuals supported this conclusion (data not shown). Fourth, Freabs was assumed to be negligible as previously justified (Mathialagan et al., 2017). If this assumption is substantially incorrect, our predictions for the verification drugs would not have met our acceptance criterion. Last, but not least, in vivo data for OAT1 in the 1st trimester or for OAT2 in the 1st and 2nd trimester are, as yet, not available, limiting the application of our approach to OAT1 and OAT2 substrates in these trimesters.\n\nBased on the above observations, an important question that arises is: under what circumstances will pregnancy-induced changes in OAT-mediated drug CL result in recommendation of change in dosing regimen of a drug administered to pregnant women? Of course, the drug would have to be predominately renally cleared from the body, and CLsec would need to constitute a large fraction of CLrenal of the drug (high CLsec/CLrenal and therefore low fuB*GFRinulin/ CLrenal,B). A good example of these guidelines is acyclovir ( , Supplemental Table 2). Acyclovir’s fe is 0.76 and CLsec/CLrenal is 0.57, and it is secreted predominately by OAT2 (97%), which is induced by 3.1-fold during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Based on these data, we predict that its CLtotal will increase (compared with nonpregnant population) by 1.69-fold during the 3rd trimester. However, if acyclovir’s fe and CLsec/CLrenal were much greater (e.g., 0.9), the change in the CLtotal of this hypothetical drug would be 2.4-fold. Such a change would warrant dosing regimen change for only those drugs that have a narrow therapeutic window. In contrast, a small CLsec/CLrenal or fe will reduce the impact of OAT induction on CLtotal of the drug in pregnant women ( ). For example, the predicted CLtotal of tenofovir in the 2nd trimester was less affected by induction of OAT1 activity (2.9-fold), even though its fe is 0.81, because its CLsec/CLrenal is small (0.23). This is not surprising since contribution by filtration clearance modulates the change in CLrenal produced by large and significant changes in CLsec of the drug. For example, the maximum reduction in in vivo CLtotal of an OAT substrate (bumetanide) in the presence of probenecid, a potent OAT inhibitor, is ∼85% (Mathialagan et al., 2017).\n\nIn summary, we showed for the first time that the changes in CLsec,Bpregnant and CLrenal,Bpregnant of OAT-transported drugs can be predicted during pregnancy using probe drugs and the RAF approach. This approach could be used in the future to prospectively adjust dosing regimens of renally secreted OAT drugs (likely narrow therapeutic window drugs) administered to pregnant women without a need to conduct pharmacokinetic studies in this difficult to study and understudied population."
