Everything changes when she flees to the Forest and is given a treasure—ten silver coins—which she quickly loses. It is up to Jill and Simon, the boy she meets in the Forest, to recover the treasure.\n\nTo so, the Children enter Acchora, a world inhabited by the Drylings who hide in the belly of a dormant volcano under the curse of the Rashtakar, the cruel being who seeks the very treasure Jill has lost. In Vendor, imagination and adventure are forbidden. In Acchora, without them, Jill, Simon and the Drylings have no hope for survival.\n\nPraise for Ten Silver Coins: The Drylings of Acchora (Book 1)\n\n“I HAVE A 13 YEAR OLD WHO'S DYING TO READ THE NEXT BOOK IN YOUR TEN SILVER COINS SERIES.
