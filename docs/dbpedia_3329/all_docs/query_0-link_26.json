        "text": "LONDON — It was another buoyant night for postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s auction here on Tuesday night, and it was, in many ways, an echo of Sotheby’s sale the evening before. Both salesrooms were overflowing with collectors, predominately from America and Asia, bidding briskly for classic paintings. Even the two artists who brought the top prices were the same — Francis Bacon and Peter Doig.\n\nBacon’s magic seems endless. While nothing has approached the $142.4 million price paid for “Three Studies of Lucian Freud” (1969) at the gavel-busting auction at Christie’s last fall, the house did manage to sell a smaller, single canvas, “Study for Head of Lucian Freud” (1967), from the estate of the writer Roald Dahl to an anonymous bidder for $19.6 million. It was expected to bring around $20 million.\n\nOn Monday night, a triptych by Bacon, “Three Studies for Portrait of George Dyer (on Light Ground)” from 1964, sold for $45.4 million, exceeding its $33.6 million high estimate.\n\nIt’s also been a strong week for Mr. Doig, whose prices are stronger than they’ve ever been. At Christie’s, Larry Gagosian, the superdealer, snapped up “Gasthof,’’ a dreamlike scene that is one of the artist’s rare self-portraits, painted in 2002-2004 and set in an expressive verdant landscape with a blue night sky, for nearly $17 million. The price was more than twice its high $8.3 million estimate. At Sotheby’s on Monday night another work by the Scottish-born Mr. Doig, “Country-Rock (Wing Mirror),” a 1999 bright yellow canvas of a tunnel in Canada where the artist grew up, brought $14.4 million.\n\nThere was active bidding from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and the Middle East, according to officials at the auction house. Christie’s sale totaled nearly $169.9 million, against an estimate of $135 million to $196.2 million. Of the 75 works on offer, 12 failed to sell. Sotheby’s auction, by comparison, totaled $158.5 million, above its high estimate of $152.6 million, but that sale was smaller. Of the 59 works, eight failed to sell. (Final prices include the buyer’s premium: 25 percent of the first $100,000; 20 percent of the next $100,000 to $2 million; and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)\n\nOn Tuesday, one of the top prices was paid for a Warhol self-portrait from 1986, a bright red canvas with the artist’s gaunt face and fright wig in yellow. Dimitri Mavrommatis, the Greek financier, bought it for $10.8 million, less than its $11 million to $16 million estimate. Before the auction, dealers said it was being sold by Jose Mugrabi, the New York dealer, on behalf of an anonymous seller.\n\nChristopher Wool has been fetching big prices recently and Christie’s had one of the American painter’s 1990 word paintings, with HAAH in black capital letters. Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund manager, was said to be the seller. And the buyer, an unidentified telephone bidder, paid $10.6 million, against its low $9.2 million estimate.\n\nThe sale included several works by Lucio Fontana. Among the best of them was “Concetto Spaziale, Attese,’’  a 1965 white canvas with the artist’s familiar slashes. The Nahmad Gallery beat out three other bidders, paying $10.2 million, surpassing its high $10 million estimate.\n\nTwo years ago the Gagosian Gallery in New York held an exhibition of the German painter Albert Oehlen. While he is hardly a household name among American collectors he brought stronger-than-ever prices this week. One of his self-portraits from 1984 was locked up by a telephone bidder for $1.8 million, roughly three times its $670,000 high estimate. “He’s found his levels,’’ said Ivor Braka, a London dealer. “Oehlen is one of the finest manipulators of paint working today.’’\n\nHigh prices were paid on Tuesday night for less conventional works too. The London collector and advertising magnate Charles Saatchi was selling Tracey Emin’s “My Bed,’’ from 1998. (He had paid £150,000, or more than $200,000) for the British artist’s installation in 2000, and proceeds from the Christie’s sale were going to benefit the Saatchi Gallery’s Foundation.)\n\nConsisting of the artist’s unmade bed with crumpled and stained sheets, torn pillow cases and cigarette butts, dirty underwear and condoms strewn beside it, “My Bed” had graced Christie’s salesroom since the artist installed days ago. And Ms. Emin could be seen sitting proudly in the salesroom applauding the loudest when her dealer, Jay Jopling bought her bed for $4.3 million, more than twice its $2 million high estimate.\n\nBefore the sale, the ever-raunchy Ms. Emin told the British news media that when her bed was shown in Japan “They were shocked by my dirty slippers, but they stole my knickers.’’\n\nThe Tony Award-winning playwright David Henry Hwang, the composer Adam Gwon and the composing duo Michael Kooman and Christopher Dimond are among the names represented in this year’s Festival of New Musicals, produced by the National Alliance for Musical Theater, a national nonprofit organization.\n\nThe 26th annual festival will be held Oct. 23-24 at New World Stages, and will feature readings of eight musicals, whittled down from over 230 submissions. The festival can offer significant exposure; among those who typically attend are producers and regional-theater programmers, and last year the performers included the Tony winner Sutton Foster and the “Rocky” star Andy Karl.\n\nAmong the selections are “Great Wall,” a family drama with music and lyrics by Kevin So and a book by Kevin Merritt, with Mr. Hwang as a creative consultant; “The Noteworthy Life of Howard Barnes,” a satirical comedy with music by Mr. Kooman and book and lyrics by Mr. Dimond, winners in 2013 of the Fred Ebb Award for aspiring musical theater songwriters; “Stu for Silverton,” about Stu Rasmussen, the transgender mayor of Silverton, Ore., with music and lyrics by the singer-songwriter Breedlove and a book by Peter Duchan (“Dogfight”); and “String,” a romantic comedy with music and lyrics by Mr. Gwon (“Ordinary Days”) and book by Sarah Hammond.\n\nAll of the shows arrive at the festival already having been seen, either in development or as workshops, in theaters in New York and across the country. “Stu for Silverton” had its premiere in 2013 at Intiman Theater of Seattle, where it had been developed. “String” has been developed at New Dramatists, where it received the Frederick Loewe Award for new musical theater work.\n\nA list of other shows and more information is at the National Alliance for Musical Theater’s website.\n\nDo two instances mean the start of a trend – or is it still just an experiment? In June, On Site Opera, a small New York company, presented a production of Rameau’s “Pygmalion,” at which operagoers were encouraged to use Google Glass, the eyeglasslike computer, onto which a translation of the libretto was projected. It was by no means an amateur operation or a frivolous stunt: the technology used to project the subtitles to Google Glass was created by Figaro Systems, the company that makes the seat-back title panels used at the Metropolitan Opera, the Santa Fe Opera and other houses.\n\nNow Figaro is taking the next step. When the Wolf Trap Opera performs Bizet’s “Carmen” at the Filene Center at Wolf Trap, in Vienna, Va., on July 25, Figaro and its MobiTxt technology will be on hand. And apart from taking the technology to a bigger opera company, Figaro is offering an expanded form of its service – but one that could raise hackles if it becomes widely used. This time, the libretto will be beamed not only to Google Glass, but also to cellphones, tablets and other devices that can connect to the Internet.\n\nMoreover, more than titles will be projected. The technology writer David Pogue, who previously wrote for The New York Times, will be milling around the stage with the other extras (“Carmen” has several crowd scenes), wearing his own Google Glass, which will allow him to capture brief video clips and still photos of the opera, from the stage perspective, and send them to the Filene Center’s social media outlets.\n\nBut Wolf Trap is intent on avoiding altercations between connected and off-the-grid audience members.\n\n“We’re very sensitive to the possibility that people reading the texts on their phones might be a distraction for other listeners,” Arvind Manocha, the president and chief executive of the Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts, said in a telephone interview. “So the devices can only be used by those in the lawn seating, not in the main seating area of the Filene Center. And on the lawn, which holds 2,600 people, about a quarter of the area will be set aside for those who want to be device-free.”\n\nMr. Manocha added that MobiTxt shows the translations as white text on a black screen. “That’s deliberate,” he said. “The text is very readable, but the light bleed is minimal. So there won’t be a sea of lit-up phones. And for those using Google Glass, there’s the benefit of having the titles projected right in your line of vision. You don’t have to do the up-and-down head motion, or decide whether to read the screen or follow one of the singers. You can do it all at the same time.”\n\nSeason 2, Episode 8 It’s all about privilege in this episode — who benefits and who doesn’t — and it should surprise none of us at this point in the story (or history?) that our white heroine from Connecticut is the chief recipient. Piper gets her furlough after Healy makes some calls. Harder to judge is whether we’re supposed to be annoyed by her going on about her grandmother. (As I was – am I alone?)\n\nCertainly the more compelling story is about one who is denied privilege. That’s Rosa, a Hispanic woman with cancer who has existed as little more than a shapeless pile making acrid comments from her bunk.\n\nShe needs surgery – she will die without it — but the Department of Corrections won’t pay. “We’ll stick with chemo,” Healy tells her, trying to be sympathetic.\n\n“We?” she shoots back. “You got cancer in your ovaries, too?”\n\nHealy is apparently just the latest in a long string of men to leave Rosa disappointed, as we see in the flashbacks to her career as a bank robber. (A really good one, apparently, until she pushes her luck one last time.) We see her in the backseat of a car about to make her first heist. She’s nervous, and resists as her boyfriend (he oozes feckless) gives her a gun – taking it only when he assures her that it makes her look cool. Then he tells her the ritual: “We kiss before, we kiss after.”\n\nRead more…\n\nEver since Rachel Lambert Mellon died in March at the age of 103, the art world has been wondering what would become of the vast treasures of art and objects that she and her husband, Paul Mellon, had collected and lived with.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sotheby’s announced that it had landed the sale of the estate of Mrs. Mellon, winning it over its rival Christie’s. The auctions, starting in November, will be among the most highly anticipated sales from a fabled family collection, with more than $100 million of art, jewelry, furniture and decorative objects. Proceeds will benefit the Gerald B. Lambert Foundation, a charitable entity established by Mrs. Mellon, known as Bunny, in memory of her father. The foundation supports the Oak Spring Garden Library, Mrs. Mellon’s celebrated collection of rare books, manuscripts, works of art and artifacts relating to horticulture, landscape design and natural history.\n\nWhile the Mellons had bequeathed much of their art, like paintings and works on paper by van Gogh, Seurat, Gauguin and Winslow Homer, to museums including the National Gallery, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Yale Center for British Art and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, there is still much that has not been spoken for. Among the stars of the collection are revered paintings by Rothko and Diebenkorn that had been hanging on the walls of the National Gallery for decades. They were loans, not gifts.\n\nInformation is scant about what exactly these sales will contain, but they will consist of the contents from the Mellons’ residences both here and abroad, including Oak Spring Farm in Upperville, Va., where Mrs. Mellon spent the last years of her life; a townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan; and the couple’s homes in Cape Cod, Antigua and Paris.\n\nIn addition to the Rothkos and Diebenkorns, the treasures include jewelry by great designers of the 20th century, among them Cartier and Verdura; antique French, English and American furniture; and examples of rare porcelains.\n\nThat Sotheby’s won the sale is not surprising. Mrs. Mellon’s longtime friend and lawyer, Alexander D. Forger, is an executor of her estate. He was also an executor for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis’s estate — and it was Sotheby’s that was chosen for that estate sale.\n\nMrs. Mellon and Onassis were close friends. In 1961 Mrs. Mellon, a serious horticulturist, redesigned the Rose Garden at the White House, creating a central lawn bordered by flower beds in the French style, but with American botanical specimens that flowered year-round. She was also Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg’s godmother.\n\nThe Onassis auction, which took place in 1996 and raised $34.4 million, became something of a New York happening, with people from around the globe descending on Sotheby’s York Avenue headquarters. Despite timed tickets, lines snaked around the auction house, with people waiting hours to glimpse objects like John F. Kennedy’s golf clubs and the mammoth 40-carat diamond engagement ring Onassis received from Aristotle Onassis.\n\nOver the years, Sotheby’s has held many such events, including the 1998 sale of art and objects belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor — more than 40,000 objects — that brought $23.3 million. For sale was a George III mahogany library table at which King Edward VIII signed his abdication in 1936, becoming the Duke of Windsor, and a box containing a piece of the duke and duchess’s wedding cake.\n\nThe Mellon sale is expected to provide a similarly rich visual history and a peek into the world of one of this country’s most private couples. Until his death in 1999, Paul Mellon, the son of Andrew W. Mellon, one of the world’s richest financiers and founder of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, was passionately involved with the National Gallery. Over the years, he served as its president, chairman and honorary trustee, giving the institution more than 900 works, including Cézanne’s “Boy in a Red Waistcoat”; paintings by Rothko; animal sculptures by Alexander Calder; Winslow Homer’s “Dad’s Coming”; Picassos, Gauguins, Bonnards and Vuillards; a Manet; the original wax version of Degas’s “Little 14-Year-Old Dancer”; and postcards that had been written by van Gogh and Matisse.\n\nEach Mellon had impeccable taste, and Mrs. Mellon, an heir to the Listerine fortune, was famous for her understated eye and attention to detail, whether it was the kind of the food she served, the dishes she served them on or every part of the grounds surrounding her homes.\n\nShe designed the gatehouse to the couple’s property in Virginia and was known to have employed her own carpenter to build furniture of her own designs. Notably loyal, Mrs. Mellon was dressed exclusively by Balenciaga until his retirement in 1968 and later only by Hubert de Givenchy."
