        "text": "ALLISON KELLY is thrilled to be returning to The Human Race Theatre! Allison was last seen at HRTC in Red Blooded All American Man. Other favorite theatre credits include: The Other Josh Cohen (dir. Hunter Foster), The Hello Girls, American Idiot, Little Orphan Danny, Almost Heaven: John Denver’s America, and multiple productions of Ring of Fire. TV: The Helpsters for Apple TV+. Allison co-created and helmed an all female creative team for Ramblin’ Rose: the Women who made country music and tours nationally with Not Fade Away: Rock n’ Roll: Reignited! and Darlin Companion: the music of Johnny Cash and June Carter. Her original music can be found with her band, Southpaw Green. Thanks to cast and crew for making all her air dreams come true! @akplaysmusic www.allisonannkelly.com\n\nZACK STEELE is overwhelmingly grateful and proud to be returning to The Human Race (in every sense) for this production of Airness. He last appeared on The Loft Theatre stage as Anthony in Sweeney Todd for HRTC’s 30th Anniversary Season, and also appeared as Patrick in Mame in 2014. Some other favorite regional credits include: Johnny Cash in Ring of Fire (Beef & Boards), Young Ben in Follies (Short North Stage), Bob Cratchit in A Christmas Carol (Hanover Theater), and Jimmy in Hank Williams: Lost Highway (Infinity Theatre). A huge congratulations and thank you to Kevin Moore for all that he has done and will do for this arts community, and all the love to Zack’s friends and family, without whose support he would not be back on stage today. @steeleyducats http://www.SoundCloud.com/Zack-Steele\n\nChelsea MarcantelBook & Lyrics\n\nChelsea Marcantel is an LA-based writer, director, and collaborator.\n\nReared by Cajuns in southwest Louisiana, Chelsea has lived and worked among the peoples of the Midwest, Appalachia, the Mid-Atlantic, and now the West Coast. In 2016, she completed a Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Fellowship at The Juilliard School. Her plays, which have been produced across the US and Canada, include Airness (2018 M. Elizabeth Osborn New Play Award), Everything is Wonderful, Tiny Houses (2018 Roe Green Award), Ladyish, Devour, and the online theatrical experience Citizen Detective (NY Times Critic’s Pick).\n\nChelsea has been entrusted with teaching young minds at Virginia Intermont College and Emory & Henry College, and loved every minute of it. As a writer, she is extremely interested in humans as small-group primates, and what happens when the rules and value systems of our chosen groups cease to serve us. She reads a lot of books, watches a lot of documentaries, and listens to a lot of podcasts. Chelsea is an enthusiastic member of The Writers Guild of America and The Dramatists Guild, and runs with a kick-ass group of activists called The Kilroys.\n\nChelsea’s current theatrical projects include the new plays Vanishing Act commissioned by the Geffen Playhouse, Lake Erie Oubliette commissioned by Cleveland Play House, and The Upstairs Department, which will have its world premiere at Signature Theatre DC in 2022. She is also working on (at last count) five commercial musical projects, as well as writing the book for the original musical The Monster, commissioned by Chicago Shakespeare Theatre, for which she won a 2021 Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theatre.\n\nSpecial Skills: stalking celebrity chefs, making killer playlists, taking artsy photos of her dog, defending the oxford comma, and overestimating her own proficiency with yoga.\n\nReviews for AIRNESS\n\n10/23/21 http://leagueofcincytheatres.info/human-races-airness-rocks/\n\n10/24/21\n\nhttp://leagueofcincytheatres.info/airness-at-human-race-for-those-about-to-rock-i-salute-you/\n\n10/29/21\n\nhttps://www.daytondailynews.com/what-to-do/events/ready-to-rock-5-reasons-to-see-airness-at-loft-theatre/HF6PI6VGNREOJCJHCKMY6ZFK7E/\n\nOfficial Rules of Air Guitar Competition\n\nRegional and US Air Guitar obeys the rules set forth by the Air Guitar World Championship:\n\nEach performance is played to 1 minute (60m sec.) of a song.\n\nThe 60 seconds can start anywhere in the song.\n\nThe instrument must be invisible & must be a guitar.\n\nAir roadies are allowed, but must leave the stage before the performance.\n\nBack-up bands (air or real) are not allowed.\n\nRounds:\n\nRound 1 (freestyle): each competitor performs to a song of their choice, with top 5 advancing to Round 2.\n\nRound 2 (compulsory): advancing competitors from Round 1 will perform surprise song.\n\nJudging Criteria:\n\nAll performances are scored on a scale from 4.0 to 6.0, with 6.0 being the highest. Scores are given to one decimal point (ie: 5.4, not 5.48). A single score is given to each air guitarist based on their overall performance in that round. The scores from BOTH ROUNDS are added to determine the contestants’ final scores. This combined score determines the winner.\n\nThe score reflects the quality of the performance based on three key criteria:\n\nTechnical merit: You don’t have to know what notes you’re playing, but the more your invisible fretwork corresponds to the music that’s playing, the better the performance.\n\nStage Presence: Anyone can do it in the privacy of their bedroom. Few have what it takes to rock a crowd of hundreds or even thousands – all without an instrument.\n\nAirness: The last criteria is the most difficult to define yet often the most decisive of all. Airness is defined as the extent to which a performance transcends the imitation of a real guitar and becomes an art form in and of itself.\n\n(Source: www.usairguitar.com/rules)"
