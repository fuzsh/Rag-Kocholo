        "text": "The article below enunciates a novel rhetorical strategy for the description of urban sound installation, drawing on the visual rhetoric of Siegfried Kracauer (“the mass ornament”), Walter Benjamin (the flâneur), and Roland Barthes (“punctum”, “studium” and “grain”). The installation Proximities (Melbourne: 2006), by David Chesworth and Sonia Leber, is used as a case study, while The Edge of the Trees (Museum Of Sydney: 1995), by Fiona Foley and Janet Lawrence, serves as a comparison and precedent for the discussion of colonial politics and heterotopic form. Rather than viewing these works in terms of an immersive, layered, or infinitely expansive depth (LaBelle, Kahn), Proximities is examined from the perspective of Kracauer’s theory of the planar superficial visual ornament. The flat ornamental quality of Proximities allows it to engage with the dialectics of memorialisation, the nature of modernism and travel, and with the sounds of the city, all of which are invoked through the artists’ generation of a technological sonic archive to evoke subaltern, colonial identities within the contemporary metropolitan space of empire and capitalism. This essay thus offers a reappraisal of the issue of sonic memorialisation as it applies to public art works and museums within contemporary Australia and the Commonwealth.\n\nFirst edition of Sound Scripts journal arising from first Totally Huge New Music Festival Conference; TOC includes:- Volume 1 (2006) Introduction Tos Mahoney Sound Scripts: A word from Tura New Music 1 Cat Hope A New Historicism? 2 Jonathan Marshall Sound, music and ruined pianos Keynote Papers Liza Lim A “Hidden Centre”: 9 Crossing cultural boundaries and ecstatic transformation Annea Lockwood How To Prepare a Piano 19 Refereed Papers Lindsay Vickery Western Electric: 23 A survey of recent Western Australian electronic music Jonathan Mustard Invisible Symmetries: 32 A retrospective of the work of Lindsay Vickery.

It investigates how an extended sense of sound, space and place is encoded in the interface of the two stereo recordings and its use as the basis to form a new work. From the motive behind the work’s concept, documentation of the new work (Alien In The Landscape) to suggestions for further research and development are discussed."
