        "text": "In this book chapter, I attempt to survey London’s highly fragmented new music theatre landscape as it developed through the first two decades of the 21st century. I argue that, while the term ‘music theatre’ lacks a strong disciplinary orbit in the UK, equivalent trends have nevertheless emerged across a number of discrete disciplinary terrains (opera, contemporary theatre, new music, visual art, dance, cabaret, Live Art), in response to the same socio-economic factors of austerity and neoliberalism. Surveying each disciplinary context in turn, I outline the collapse of mid-scale opera production since the '90s, and the simultaneous rise of flexibility, transparency and immediacy as creative and aesthetic principles. The chapter draws on interviews with artists and producers associated with three key music theatre ‘nodes’—Tête à Tête Festival, Battersea Arts Centre and London Contemporary Music Festival—whose production practices and curatorial projects have helped determine the emergence of trends such as gig theatre, composer-performer collectives and gallery opera. Stressing the comparative centrality of pop music and Live Art to the UK’s music and theatre discourses, the survey concludes by highlighting the importance of a context-specific understanding of ‘music theatre’, which asks 'What do we mean by \"music\"?' and 'What do we mean by \"theatre\"?'.\n\nThis dissertation explores the place of musicals at the Stratford Festival of Canada—with specific attention focused on the function, and the value of an American art form in a classical theatre company devoted to the works of Shakespeare. I trace the history of music theatre at the Festival, including opera and operetta, and argue that the Festival’s commitment to music in its early history led to the organic inclusion of musicals in its seasons. I also give a more nuanced reading of the place of musicals at the Stratford Festival in analyzing the physical places where they are produced, and how they are valued within the company. Theatre critics commonly view musicals as money makers for the Festival to finance its real goal of producing Shakespeare and the classics. The economic value of musicals is undoubtedly important, and I examine it in detail, but it is only one facet of their purpose at Stratford. I problematize the role of musicals at Stratford, arguing that reducing the value of musicals to economic value alone is rooted in a historical construction of highbrow/lowbrow taste hierarchies that align musicals to bourgeois aesthetics and commercial theatre. I unpack the history of the way musicals have been trivialized as middlebrow entertainment within theatre communities and academia. I contend that their role cannot be fully understood by examining their economic value alone, but must be understood by analyzing their aesthetic value and entertainment value. Assessing the entertainment value of musicals means analyzing and valuing the pleasures that audience members derive from theatre that entertains them, even when its aesthetic value might be questionable. Musicals should also be assessed aesthetically, and that allows for the values—the tastes—of the critics to be heard. Studying the economic/commercial, aesthetic, entertainment value and socio-political factors present in musicals allows for a well-rounded analysis of the musicals and the many roles they fulfill at Stratford. It is an approach that attempts to balance text and context(s) by acknowledging the hierarchies of genre within the musical and theatrical worlds and highbrow/lowbrow considerations within the canon of musical theatre.\n\nDespite the rich range of scholarship on the film musical, in-depth scholarly attention to the relationship between Hollywood and Broadway as symbolic centers of the U.S. culture industries has been surprisingly sparse. This article makes an intervention into this largely neglected history through an examination of David O. Selznick's failed efforts in the early 1940s to stage Gone With the Wind as a Broadway musical. Fresh off back-to-back Academy Awards for Best Picture, Selznick made the innovative move to try adapting Gone With the Wind during his four-year hiatus from film production. Using Show Boat as an inspiration and Oklahoma! as a catalyst to accelerate his efforts, Selznick's attempts ultimately failed during his lifetime, but represent an earlier inroad into cross-industrial franchising. Furthermore, few know that Selznick set up a summer stock theater in Santa Barbara in 1941 not only to hone his contracted talent, but also to prevent them from leaving southern California for the New York stage in the summer. Consequently, this article emphasizes the value of studying industrial failure for scholars of the culture industries as well as the need for greater study of the alternately generative and competitive relationship between Broadway and Hollywood—a relationship put into renewed relief recently as Broadway shows now espouse a high concept aesthetic to tell stories often with roots in film properties and fueled in part by Hollywood money."
