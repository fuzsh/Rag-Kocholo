        "text": "A lot of times it’s hard to even know where to begin. We hear some of the unthinkable statistics about gender-based violence and our blood boils, our heart breaks. But we also feel helpless to do anything to change it.\n\nThis book starts with prayer. As I’ve shared the books across Canada, one of the things I often repeat is that, “even if you don’t pray, you’ll start once you read this.” That might not be the best way to market a publication, but it’s true.\n\nWhat I love about this book is that it looks honestly at the issues. I wrote 14 of the 30 stories, and my intention as I wrote them was to imagine real issues, personalize them, imagine one person.\n\nThe publisher’s goal was to compel 100,000 people to pray for 5 mins a day for 30 days about these issues, which means that some 30+ years of prayer time was given to the issues, which is incredible to consider because prayer works. I’ve heard stories from around the world about how this publication has compelled them not only to pray but to act.\n\nAlthough published in the early 2000s, the book remains incredibly relevant today.\n\nIn the foreword, Loren Cunningham, founder of Youth With A Mission, in response to the question about what the greatest global challenge will be as we enter the 21st Century writes, “the abuse and suppression of women. Why? Because it is the biggest, most far reaching, and most hidden.”\n\nOrder the book that has been read around the world. Perfect for your justice-focused organization or small group to learn more about gender-based injustice, the 30 day prayer curriculum will also lead you or your group into effective action\n\nFeaturing 14 fictional stories written by Andrew Kooman that bring real issues of gender-based injustice to life. Published 2006 by photogenX, the stories have been translated into Japanese, Korean, German, Urdu, Russian, and Spanish."
