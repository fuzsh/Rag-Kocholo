        "text": "I’m traveling this week. Whenever I step out of the ordinary—get on a plane, cross a border—I’m reminded of previous travels, imagine new adventures, think of stories to tell.\n\nFor my post this week, I’m sharing Chapter 13 of my YA novel Ten Silver Coins: The Drylings of Acchora which I’ve been sharing for free, week-by-week on my site.\n\nI hope you’re enjoying if you’ve been following along. (You can subscribe to get access to the weekly chapter if you want to catch up).\n\nRecapping 12 chapters in 2 paragraphs: The main character in the story, Jill Strong, is a young girl who had to flee her city. She lives in a dystopia, a future where conformity is demanded. Unlike everyone else, her face is uncovered, as in not masked, a sign of her shame. An orphan, with little memory of her parents, she’s guided out of the city just before it burns, and escapes to a mysterious mansion in the nearby forest. It’s here she’s given a treasure—ten silver coins she needs to guard with her life—that, of course, she immediately loses.\n\nIn today’s chapter, she’s stepped from her troubled world into another, through an unexpected portal, perhaps because of her over-active imagination. And things are about to get wild as the treasure takes a new shape, as invisible beings meet her on the beach, and as her new friend Simon, whom she meets in the mansion, are about to be pulled into the Dryling nation’s battle for survival.\n\nThe story is a fun trip out of the ordinary and into the imagination.\n\nIf you need an escape, I think you’ll enjoy it. If you or a child in your life need a spark of hope, share it with them and jump into the adventure.\n\n~ AK\n\nChapter 13: Scouring the Beach\n\nSimon stood up and brushed the sand off his trousers. The two looked around. To the north was the amusement park. It looked smaller than it once did, now that the Ferris wheel was gone. The park was set upon a plot of land that rose out of a steep rock face standing more than ten metres above the water.\n\nThe grade of the rocks diminished at a gradual angle into shoreline nearly half a kilometre south of the park where Jill and Simon stood on the beach. The beach had warm golden sand and stretched behind the children for about a hundred metres. The water was directly to the east. Simon pointed this out, noting that the sun was just rising from that direction to the highest point in the sky. The stretch of beach was bordered to the south and west by trees, and rocky terrain that rose into the small cliff on which stood the amusement park in the north.\n\n“Seraph said we were not to leave the beach without the coin,” Jill noted.\n\n“Do you think it could have washed up onto shore?”\n\n“The waves are fairly large,” Jill said, “but I don’t see how that’s possible. It bounced off the Ferris wheel and landed in the water all the way over there by those rocks.”\n\n“Well, we may as well start looking,” Simon concluded.\n\nThey decided to start in the shallow water by the shore. They both took off their socks and shoes and walked up to their ankles in the water. They walked up and down the stretch of beach, looking into the murky water intently. They found nothing. They stepped out of the water, rubbed their necks which were strained from keeping their heads down for so long, then started to walk along the shoreline in the same manner: side by side, eyes scanning directly at the area in front of their feet as they walked. When they came to one end of the beach, they would step a few feet away from the water then walk in the other direction, always carefully scanning the ground, in hopes of spotting the silver coin.\n\nAfter quite some time, Jill stopped walking. “Simon, this is useless. We’re already more than ten metres away from the water, and still no coin. The waves aren’t that large. How could the coin have made it this far inland?”\n\n“You’re probably right. Maybe we should start back at the water and retrace our steps. We might have missed it.”\n\n“We could go on doing this forever and never find it,” Jill said. “We don’t even know if it’s here. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack.”\n\n“Well, what else can we do? You know what Seraph said.”\n\n“I know,” said Jill. “How did Seraph ever think we could find it?”\n\n“Wait a minute!” Simon announced, “What’s that?”\n\nSimon pointed to a spot in the sand a few steps behind Jill. Jill turned and looked but saw nothing. “What is it Simon? I don’t see anything.”\n\n“You have to look at the right angle, you need to see the reflection of the sun. Move your head a bit.”\n\nJill did. She tilted her head from side to side then stepped to where Simon was standing and squinted her eyes. There! A silver glimmer of light reflected out of the sand. The two looked at each other and then ran toward the spot. Jill and Simon dropped onto their knees into the beach. They looked down on a thin arc of silver sticking out of the sand. Jill smiled at Simon.\n\n“Good eye.”\n\nShe was about to reach her hand toward the silver object, but stopped abruptly when she heard a sound that seemed to come from behind her, and above her, and all around her. A voice. Jill gulped. Be careful little eyes what you see! Jill looked wide-eyed at Simon. They heard the voice again.\n\n“What was that?” Simon stood up and looked around. “Who’s there?” he said, and spun on his heels.\n\nA strong wind came with sudden force from the ocean and blew across the beach. It blew sand all about, in the children’s eyes and mouths. The water was choppy and violent. White waves breached and foamed. The sand bit into their skin. Simon crouched back onto the ground. The wind continued to blow.\n\n“What’s happening?” he shouted toward Jill.\n\n“I don’t know. Oh no,” she cried above he sound of the howling wind. “The coin! It’s been covered by the sand. We have to find it!”\n\nThe two moved over the spot where they last remembered seeing the coin and frantically dug about, scooping sand with their hands blindly as sand swirled around their bodies and blew in their faces. Jill felt something metallic under her fingers. Face near the sand, she squinted in the wind at the beach and saw a thin line of silver.\n\n“I’ve found it,” she yelled toward Simon. As she yelled, the wind abruptly stopped. There was an eerie silence. Simon looked at the water, which was now totally still.\n\n“I don’t have a very good feeling about this place, Jill. Grab the coin, and let’s run for the trees.”\n\nJill brushed sand away from the thin line of silver with her finger. “What is this?” Jill gasped. “It looks like a coin, but it’s different somehow.” Jill dug a little more around the metal, then jumped back and screamed.\n\n“What Jill?” Simon asked in surprise.\n\n“Simon, this isn’t a coin, it’s a ring!”\n\n“Yeesh, Jill. I thought you saw something worth screaming about. What’s the big deal?”\n\n“The ring is still attached to a hand!” Jill announced.\n\n“What do you mean? Jill, you must be imagining things.” Simon bent over the metal, and blew sand from it with his mouth. The force of the air from his lungs pushed more sand away to reveal what Jill feared – a long white finger! “Jill, was there anyone else on the Ferris wheel with us?”\n\n“I don’t know. What do you mean? You think there were other people on the ride?”\n\n“If there were,” Simon continued, “could they have been thrown this far from the wheel?”\n\n“It was spinning pretty fast,” Jill said. “I don’t know. Oh!” Jill dropped to her knees again and started to frantically pull sand from the finger along with Simon. In a matter of seconds they had exposed the rest of the hand. Soon they had uncovered a forearm. The hand and forearm were strangely white, like skin with no pigment. “Simon, stop! Look!”\n\n“What?”\n\nJill pointed at the hand. “The hand, it just moved!” They both froze and watched the hand. It lay completely still. Jill looked at Simon, the blood completely drained from her face. “I know what I saw, Simon. The hand moved.”\n\nSimon leaned in closer to the hand. He quickly touched the hand and then pulled his arm away, like he was testing to see if a clothes iron was hot. But the hand was not hot. It was cold, like he was touching a raw piece of chicken pulled from the refrigerator, ready to be cooked. Simon touched the hand again. He lifted the ring finger.\n\n“I don’t think so, Jill, this hand is deathly cold. I don’t think there is life in it.”\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when suddenly the hand shot up out of the sand and gripped Simon by the wrist. Jill screamed as Simon’s hand was pulled forcefully against the sand. The white hand tightened around Simon’s wrist. Simon tried to pull away, but the grip was stronger than iron.\n\n“Jill, help!”\n\nSuddenly, another hand emerged from the sand, exposing a white forearm, bicep and shoulder. The other hand reached toward Simon, groping along the sand, then his arm until it stopped at his chest. The arm hooked itself around Simon’s neck and pulled him against the sand. The ground began to shake. Jill fell back into the sand away from Simon and the hands. The sand all about Simon started to drop and fall away, like sand falling through the hole of an hourglass. An area, not much longer than Simon’s body, began to sink away into the ground. Jill crawled to the edge of it and peered down. Simon was about three feet below her.\n\n“Simon!” she yelled. “Grab my hand!”\n\nJill reached down to Simon. He feebly thrust out his arm and tried to grab Jill’s hand, but he couldn’t. He kept sinking further and further into the ground. Sand from the higher ground, along the edges of the sinkhole started to pour in and fill the hole. The sand was burying Simon! Simon was disappearing into the ground fast; he was nearly covered in sand. Jill could no longer see the terrible white arms. Simon was coughing and shouting incoherently.\n\n“Simon!” she yelled again. “Simon!”\n\nThe ground continued to rumble and sink. And then, Simon’s head disappeared beneath the surface of the sand. Without thinking Jill threw herself at the sinkhole, jumping toward it, desperate to save Simon. But, her fall was stopped short by level ground. The sinkhole had been replaced by solid ground again. Simon was gone.\n\nJill stood looking at the sand all around her, worried that her next step would be into another sinkhole and that she, too, would be pulled underground and disappear. Jill was shocked and frightened. “Forget the coin, Jill,” she said out loud. “Simon was right, you need to run for the trees.”\n\nMotivated less by courage and more by terror, Jill ran for the trees as fast as she could. She didn’t stop running until she could no longer see sand. Then, she found a fallen tree, sat down, and cried. After some tears, she felt a little relieved, though still afraid and disoriented. She still did not know where in the world she was. Was it the real world or somewhere in Simon’s imagination? Yet, how could she be in Simon’s imagination if he was, if he was –?\n\nShe could not think it. She would not think it. She would never say it until she knew it was true. If that man or creature could live in the sand, then Simon could too. Jill dropped her head onto her knees in despair, and started to cry again.\n\nHer cries were interrupted, by voices that spoke in unison. “Little girl, why do you cry?”\n\nJill stood up with a start. She looked around her. All she saw was forest on every side. But the sound of the voices echoed in her head. The voices were low pitched and haunting. It was like standing in the middle of a stringed instrument section of an orchestra that was playing low notes in the bass clef.\n\n“You cry for your friend who has disappeared,” the voices said, together.\n\n“Who said that?” Jill asked looking all about.\n\n“Keep looking, but you won’t see us – ”\n\n“Where are you?”\n\n“Keep searching but you will not find us. We cannot be seen.”\n\n“Honestly,” Jill said, exasperated. “It must be my fate to be haunted by voices.”\n\n“Not more haunted than we are, young girl. Be thankful that you can hear. Be thankful that you can be seen. We are not so fortunate as you.”\n\n“Who are you? Please, you’re scaring me,” Jill said.\n\n“The question, better put young girl, is, ‘Who are you?’”\n\n“My name is Jill Strong. I’m not afraid to tell you who I am. Now please, tell me who you are!”\n\nThe voices were silent for sometime, then Jill heard the sound of a low murmuring, as though the few voices were speaking softly, the way a fly sounds when it buzzes against a window, or the way a child sounds when he counts against a wall in a game of hide-and-go-seek.\n\n“Did you say Jill Strong?”\n\n“Yes. That’s my name. I’m Jill Strong. Now who are you?”\n\n“We are ones who know that name. Child, we were friends of your mother.”\n\nJill relaxed her body a little. “You knew my mother? How? When?”\n\n“Daughter of Grace, your questions will be answered, but they must wait. You are not safe. This is a dangerous land. It belongs to the Dark Prince, though he is known by other names. We must find somewhere else to talk, somewhere that is safe. He roams these lands and has many foul creatures that do his evil work. There are few in these woods that can be trusted.”\n\nJill gulped and looked back at the beach. “My friend! My friend Simon. The boy I came with. The boy with me on the sand!”\n\n“Fear not, child. The boy is alive, but what his condition might be is not ours to say. If the seed that was planted in the sand was good, then he will meet a good fate. However, if the seed planted was not good, if it was a tare or weed, then – ”\n\nThe voices stopped.\n\n“Then what?” Jill asked.\n\n“Then,” said a single voice that sounded like a sad, lonely violin, “his life is in great danger.”\n\n“What do you mean? I don’t understand.”\n\n“There will be time for understanding later,” said the lonely voice, “but you must come with us, Jill. You must trust us. I know it is difficult. You cannot see us. But we can only offer you our word, and, our protection.”\n\nJill bit her lip as she looked to try to see where the voice came from. All she could see was the forest. She could feel a presence, but could see no one. “Where are we going?” she asked.\n\n“Hold out your hand. We will lead you there.”\n\nJill did not know what else to do, so she hesitantly lifted her hand out in front of her. Her hand shook the way it shook when she had to read in front of all her classmates at school. Jill felt a sudden, warm pressure against her wrist. She tried to pull her arm back towards her body but could not. Her hand was now being held in the solid grip of another, invisible hand. Jill looked at her hand and then focused her attention at a spot a little ways above it.\n\n“You’re real!” she said, relieved. “You aren’t ghosts?”\n\nJill heard laughter, she guessed there were at least two other beings accompanying the creature that now held her hand. “Yes, Jill, we’re real. Real as the trees,” said the single voice again.\n\nJill was pulled into the air. She let out a yelp of surprise. Her feet dangled off the ground, and she continued to be pulled higher in the air. Soon she felt pressure around her waist. Her arm dropped freely to her side. She was being lifted by invisible hands that now held her around the waist. She was about two metres in the air.\n\n“Jill, I’m going to set you down now.” Jill felt something firm underneath her. “Relax a little bit Jill, you can sit here,” said the disembodied voice. “You’ll be safe, just hold on, I hope you’re okay with flying.”\n\n“Flying?” Jill asked hesitantly. “I’ve never flown. I’ve never been in an airplane or a helicopter. I’m not sure I can – whoa!” Jill yelled.\n\n“It’s okay.”\n\nJill fell forward and was stopped by something hard in front of her. She reached out her arms and found that she could wrap them around it. It was thick as a tree trunk but warm and soft like a goose-down pillow.\n\n“Yeah, okay, you can hold on Jill, but not so hard. You’re choking me.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Jill, you’re choking me.”\n\n“Oh, sorry.” Jill blushed and loosened her grip around the invisible creature’s neck. “So,” Jill asked, “do you have a name?”\n\n“Yes, I do. You can call me Stelton. Here we go.” In a matter of seconds Jill was high above the ground and slowly moving higher and higher until she was level with the treetops. “You’re less likely to be spotted here among the tops of the trees. The Dark\n\nPrince probably forgets that we can fly. It’s been so long since he’s seen any of us. So long since we’ve seen ourselves.”\n\nThe further Jill flew, the thicker the forest became. Soon she could not see the forest floor, only the tops of the trees. Jill turned and looked behind her. The rock cliff where the Ferris wheel once stood was a small speck in the distance. Jill could see the shoreline vaguely against the blueness of the sky where the sun was at the peak of its arc.\n\nOn and on they flew, until they came to a large rock formation that spiked out of the forest of trees. The rock was shaped like a cone whose top had collapsed inwardly on itself. “A volcano!” Jill announced.\n\n“A dormant volcano,” said Stelton. “The last time it spouted lava was hundreds of years ago, before I was born.”\n\nThey came to the end of the forest, and swooped sharply down the tree line toward the ground. Jill’s stomach jumped into her throat and she let out a squeal that was a mix of fear and excitement. Just as quickly as she started to drop in the sky, Stelton started to climb again, centimetres away from touching the rock, climbing in the air along the rock formation until they were at the top. When they reached the tip of the volcano, they flew over the lip and dropped into the volcano’s centre. Jill shrieked as she suddenly spun with the invisible creature that turned in circles in the air.\n\n“Home sweet home!” Stelton shouted then whooped out loud.\n\n“You live here?” Jill asked.\n\n“Yes we do. All of the survivors.”\n\nThe inside of the volcano looked like a giant, empty salad bowl. A ledge protruded a few metres above the basin and ran around the entire bowl. Jill felt pressure against her waist again. She was lifted from where she sat and put down on the ledge. “There you go. Safe and sound. Now that wasn’t so bad, was it?” asked Stelton.\n\n“Not at all, that was fantastic!” Jill said, clasping her hands together and pulling them under her chin. “Can we do that again sometime, Stelton?”\n\n“I think we just might,” he said. “Now, if you turn around, you’ll find an opening in the volcano wall. Few, even among my people, know of its whereabouts. It’s a secret passageway. Follow behind me. We’ll follow this lava tube to the inner chamber. You’ve had an exciting afternoon. I imagine you will want nourishment and rest.”\n\n© 2024 Andrew Kooman. All rights reserved.\n\nAbout Andrew Kooman\n\nAndrew Kooman is a Canadian writer of fiction, poetry, plays, and films.
