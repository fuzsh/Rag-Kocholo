I am grateful to all of them, though will limit my formal thanks and acknowledgments here to those people and institutions that most directly supported this project or helped at crucial moments. This study began as a doctoral dissertation, and therefore I am most thankful for the guidance and thoughtful instruction of my supervisors, Martin Kemp and Gervase Rosser. Both were always supportive as my research took unexpected turns and offered many insights on Renaissance art, also providing critical feedback that challenged me to consider this study from different points of view, and as part of larger discussions in the history of art. I am grateful to both of them for sharing their expertise and scholarly guidance. For providing thoughtful criticisms that have helped me to rethink my argument as I revised my research for publication, I am very appreciative of the examiners of my doctoral thesis, Geraldine Johnson and Lina Bolzoni. I am also thankful for the instructive comments of Philip Sohm, who supervised my Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Toronto, as well as to Sharon Gregory and Allison Sherman, all of whom have generously read portions of this book. For welcoming me very warmly to the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies at Toronto, I would like to express my gratitude to Olga Pugliese and Konrad Eisenbichler. My ma supervisor, David McTavish, has remained an always supportive mentor from whom I learned much while working on an earlier project. Mauro Di Vito and Sarah Rolfe Prodan offered second opinions on various Italian translations and stimulating conversation on Renaissance art. I am also particularly grateful for the thoughtful comments of two anonymous readers for Brill, whose criticisms were especially valuable. Needless to say, any remaining oversights or errors are my responsibility alone. Financial funding for this research was provided through a Doctoral Fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, an Overseas Research Student Award Scheme Scholarship, the Canadian National Scholarship from Linacre College, an award from the Canadian Centennial Scholarship Fund, and a thesis completion grant from the Vice Chancellor’s Fund, Oxford. Study in Italy was made possible through a fellowship at the Dutch University Institute for the History of Art in Florence and an Isaiah Berlin Fund Scholarship from the Taylor Institution, Oxford. Revisions and additional research were made possible by a Postdoctoral\n\nx\n\nacknowledgments\n\nFellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, hosted by the Department of Art at the University of Toronto. A Faculty Research Development Plan Grant from Concordia University, where I have recently been warmly welcomed into the Department of Art History, enabled me to hire research assistants who helped in the final stages of this project. Without the generous assistance of these institutions, this research would not have been possible. I am very grateful to the many friends who have helped me talk through ideas and who have shared their perspectives and humor. Although they are too many to name, I am thankful for friends in Oxford, Florence, Toronto and Montreal who have given moral support in the face of research obstacles. For their editorial help at various stages, financial aid while I was a student, and, most importantly, continual moral support, this book is dedicated with many thanks to my parents, Nick and Francine Stowell.

Typically these writings have been studied to shed light on issues that shaped the creation, reception and interpretation of works of art in Renaissance Italy across a wide spectrum of subjects: the education and biography of the artist, the intellectual understanding and philosophy of art, optical theory and the study of anatomy, the reception of works of art, and the relationship between poetry and art, etc. Surprisingly, with some important exceptions, these texts have not been studied for the valuable information they provide on the spiritual experiences within which works of art were embedded. As this study aims to demonstrate, a wide-ranging selection of writings on art may be reread with this issue in mind, illuminating both the spiritual responses evoked by works of art, as well as the spiritual dimensions of artistic practices. Whilst studies of the religious contexts of works of art have investigated, amongst other questions, the rituals in which works of art were used, the iconographic relationships between spiritual sources and works of art, as well as the proscribed theological uses of works of art, the literature on art remains an invaluable body of sources concerning sacred art, revealing the subjective experiences of viewers and creators. By looking at writings on art, we are offered firsthand accounts of the thoughts that structured the reception and creation of works of art. Outlining the relationship between writings on art and Christian spirituality entails reconstructing the literary sources out of which Italian art discourses emerged. Generally, writings on art have been interpreted in light of the revival of classical literature, and therefore there has been a perceived symmetry between the presence of classical motifs in Renaissance art and the influence of antique sources on writings on art.1 Although it would certainly 1 With the exception of sources written by theologians to serve ecclesiastical needs, such as Gabriel Paleotti’s treatise on art discussed in chapter 5, scholars of the literature on art have been predominantly concerned with the classical tradition. There will be many opportunities to observe this bias throughout this study; in general, classical sources are frequently emphasized in the foundational bibliography written by Julius von Schlosser Magnino, La letteratura artistica: manuale delle fonti della storia dell’art moderna, trans. Filippo Rossi (Florence: La Nuova Italia, 1935). Schlosser Magnino was also very attentive to the medieval tradition\n\n© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���5 | doi ��.��63/9789004283923_002\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nbe unfair to suggest that the existing scholarship has ignored medieval sources, on balance classical sources tend to be given pride of place, often justifiably. Though the bias for research on classical motifs in Renaissance art has been balanced over the past several decades by art historians whose interests lie in the social and religious functions of images, research into the writings on art from the same period has not engaged with their spiritual content to the same degree. Though an increasing number of scholars study art theory to answer questions that extend beyond the revival of classical literature, there has only been little work done to suggest that Renaissance Italian writings on art might be indebted to medieval spiritual as well as classical sources. Therefore, whilst aiming to illuminate the spiritual experiences of art during the Renaissance from the perspective of Italian writers, I also intend to revisit the question of their intellectual sources, proposing that we can see the influence of Christian as well as classical texts. Given their obvious importance, I do not propose to displace classical sources, but rather to show how multiple voices and intellectual traditions have shaped writings on art. By examining writings on art in light of spiritual literature, one is able to see how the experience and creation of art was articulated using terms that were central to spirituality, offering hitherto unexplored evidence on the nature of spiritual relationships with art objects. My goal is thus twofold: to bring further depth to our understanding of the spiritual relationships formed between artists, viewers and art objects, and to describe how medieval and Renaissance Christian sources (comprising spiritual, theological, and mystical texts) bore upon Italian Renaissance writings on art.\n\nfrom which this literature emerged. Close to the same time, Erwin Panofsky surveyed much art theory from antiquity to the Baroque period through the lens of Platonic philosophy, frequently inferring classical rather than medieval sources; see Erwin Panofsky, Idea: A Concept in Art Theory, trans. Joseph J.S. Peake (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1968; original German text published in 1924). The same preference can be observed in Anthony Blunt’s short book (influential amongst English-writing art historians), Artistic theory in Italy, 1450–1600 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1940). Similarly influential is Rensselaer Lee’s essay on the humanist theory of painting in which the unifying theme is the relationship between poetry and painting, a concept attributed to Horace. See Rensselaer W. Lee, “Ut Pictura Poesis: The Humanistic Theory of Painting,” The Art Bulletin 22 (1940). The work of Michael Baxandall has been likewise significant, positing that the language used to discuss art by early humanists was strongly determined by the project of reviving classical Latin; see Giotto and the Orators: Humanist Observers of Painting in Italy and the Discovery of Pictorial Composition 1350–1450 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971). There are many exceptions to this general bias, including for example the writings of David Summers and Paul Barolsky.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nThe primary sources for this study are thus Italian writings on art from roughly 1400–1600. “The literature on art” denotes a selection of texts that modern scholars have grouped together including treatises, dialogues, biographies, ekphrastic descriptions of works of art, instruction manuals, letters and poetry.2 Though this grouping of texts does not necessarily reflect an Early Modern category, there is evidence to indicate that at times writers and readers saw relationships between these different genres, as demonstrated by the fact that writers on art in one literary form might draw upon or make reference to the writings on art in another form.3 The analysis here is therefore not limited to one literary genre, seeing as the relationship between spirituality and art did not express itself so narrowly, though consequently this study cannot claim to have surveyed the literature on art in its entirety.4 In general, however, most of the literature studied here was circulated either as a manuscript or published as a printed book during the Renaissance, and emphasis has been given to prose texts dealing primarily with art rather than books in which visual art is mentioned in passing. The writers of these texts include humanists, scholars, artists, and theologians working throughout Italy. Methodologically, the approach used in this study is, in some sections, consistent with the majority of studies of the literature on art, and in other sections pushes against and expands upon this approach. Many studies of the literature on art have demonstrated the importance of locating these texts within specific historical and geographical contexts in which language was shaded 2 The genre of literature on art is outlined by Schlosser Magnino, La letteratura artistica, and more recently discussed by David Summers, introduction to Michelangelo and the Language of Art (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981); Robert Williams, introduction to Art, Theory, and Culture in Sixteenth-Century Italy: From Techne to Metatechne (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997). 3 This is evident, to take one example, in the fact that a literary dialogue by Ludovico Dolce appears to refer to the biographies of artists written by Giorgio Vasari. Dolce’s literary sources are discussed by Mark Roskill, introduction to Dolce’s ‘Aretino’ and Venetian Art Theory of the Cinquecento (New York: New York University Press, 1968). 4 Regarding these omissions it can only be said that, within the scope of a study of this size, a representative sample of authors from both the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and from diverse social and political contexts has been examined. Additionally, the challenge has been taken to speak about certain writers, for example Leonardo da Vinci, who are not traditionally considered to have been greatly influenced by spiritual literature. The attention to prose writings in this book is the reason that Michelangelo’s poetry is not examined, however, a recent book by Sarah Rolfe Prodan sheds much new light on this topic: Michelangelo’s Christian Mysticism: Spirituality, Poetry and Art in Sixteenth-Century Italy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014); I am grateful to the author for sharing an early draft of this manuscript.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nin particular ways.5 This approach is not rejected in this study, and accordingly, in several chapters, I have aimed to study these texts within the particular contexts in which they were written, considering the authors’ known and presumed intellectual sources and literary influences in order to illuminate the spiritual dimensions of their texts. Thus, like many scholars who work on this material, I have engaged these sources with the methodologies developed by literary and intellectual historians for textual analysis. By considering the historical contexts and the intellectual sources of the authors, I have looked for spiritual texts that might throw into relief the spiritual dimensions of their writings on art. This is not primarily a work of philology, though at times this method is used. The approach outlined above, however, tends to favor a positivistic method of interpreting writings only in light of known sources, whilst it is reasonable to assume that an author’s writings are informed by a broad range of intellectual, literary and spiritual sources, not all of them documented and not necessarily textual. Therefore, in certain chapters I have engaged with texts and spiritual traditions, even in the absence of concrete evidence that a particular Renaissance author was engaged with the given tradition. The last chapter of this book, in which certain ideas concerning architecture in the writings of Giorgio Vasari are read in light of architectural motifs in the writings of Hugh of St. Victor, exemplifies this approach. Whilst not wanting to argue that Vasari was definitely influenced by the thinking of Hugh of St. Victor, I have investigated Vasari’s literary and cultural milieu, and particularly the writings of his advisors, in order to illustrate how ideas perhaps stemming from Hugh of St. Victor might have formed part of Vasari’s spiritual and intellectual framework, even if there is no direct line of influence that has yet come to light. Likewise in other chapters, not to disregard the differences between authors but rather to show the pervasiveness of Christian themes, I have ranged more freely through a selection of authors not normally considered together. This method can be justified, in part, by pointing out the obvious fact that Christianity pervaded nearly all aspects of life in Early Modern Italy. To discuss Christian themes in the literature of a Florentine author and a Venetian author does not incur quite the same problems that one may encounter writing about the political philosophies of two authors from these two cities in which the lived political realities were distinctly different. This, of course, is not to say that there are no differences whatsoever in the way Christianity was practiced throughout Italy, or that devotional literature of the fifteenth century is interchangeable with that of the sixteenth. There are, however, great continuities in 5 For example Baxandall, Giotto and the Orators.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nspirituality between various regions of Italy and between the early Renaissance and the Counter-Reformation, and in certain parts of this book my aim will be to illustrate these continuities, though always with an awareness of the unique local contexts in which these texts were produced. In these cases my method is similar though I have called upon a broader literary context, considering the spiritual sources widely available to readers and writers of Renaissance writings on art. In doing this, I have tried to reconstruct some of the given philosophical, theological and spiritual beliefs that may have been commonly understood across a broad spectrum of literate people by drawing upon the printed spiritual literature of the time as well as medieval literature that is often reprinted in the Renaissance in order to shed light on a given text on art. The spiritual themes that have emerged through this process are often in forms that have been vulgarized from their original source. The third chapter of this study, part of which investigates the theme of ‘self-love’ in the writings of Leonard da Vinci in light of Augustine’s concept of self-love, is an example of this process. Here, texts by Augustine are introduced into the discussion, as well as later texts closer to Leonardo’s time (some of which Leonardo may have owned) that make use of Augustine’s concept, albeit in a more simplified form. I have thus attempted to reread Renaissance art theory through the lens of this vulgate understanding. Unpacking the varied and multiple cultural and intellectual traditions and ideological structures of a given piece of writing, which often exist unspoken in texts, is an approach that might be likened to Michael Baxandall’s concept of the ‘period eye,’ whereby he attempts to articulate the unspoken framework that shaped visual perception in the fifteenth century.6 Similarly, this study attempts to uncover the spiritual precepts embedded in writings on art, throwing them into relief sometimes by focusing on the local context in which a given text was produced, and at other times by considering a spectrum of writers who would not normally be considered together due to their geographic or intellectual differences. There are many ways in which the writings on art can be interrogated for evidence on the spiritual and religious uses of images. This study is concerned primarily with spiritual themes, and therefore does not aim to cover all issues relating to religious themes in writings on art. This is not, for instance, a study of the theological justification of images in the Renaissance, nor is it a study of what images were deemed theologically correct, though questions regarding both these issues are discussed. There is no universal definition of spirituality, 6 See Michael Baxandall, Painting and Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988), chapter 2 on the period eye. In this book, Baxandall also explores the terms of Renaissance art criticism.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nthough it can be characterized generally as pertaining to the subject’s interior experience of faith, religion, devotion and God through prayer, meditation, reading and the experience of the sacraments, among other things.7 Some writings on art, primarily those written by ecclesiastical authors who openly address artistic matters from the point of view of faith and theology, have already been the subject of scholarly study on religion and art. This book, on the other hand, discusses such written sources in order to penetrate the spiritual attitudes that were thought to guide the creation and experience of works of art. Beyond looking to texts written by ecclesiastical authors, this study also investigates spiritual themes as they appear in texts written by lay authors dealing with both sacred and secular art and artistic practices more generally. Spiritual themes thus reveal themselves in explicit discussions of an art object’s spiritual efficacy, but also through the metaphorical language used, and the more subtle choices and inclinations expressed by Renaissance authors regarding ideals of art and practice. Reading the literature on art in light of spiritual themes involves exposing how attitudes to painting practices, for example, are articulated in terms reminiscent of spirituality, prayer and meditation, how the terms and concepts used to describe the experience and reception of both secular and sacred art reflect spiritual experiences, and how the qualities desired in works of art are shaped by spiritual concerns. The spiritual experience of art that I aim to describe in this study is characterized by a particular relationship to the techniques of visual representation now known as naturalism. In this way, this study engages with an issue that might be considered paradigmatic of Renaissance art history: in a student’s earliest exposure to European art history, he or she is often taught that the fundamental development distinguishing the Renaissance from the Middle Ages is the use of pictorial techniques that represent the natural world consistently according to rational principles.8 Increasingly in recent decades, changing artistic practices and techniques for making images have been posited 7 Useful discussions can be found in Bernard McGinn, introduction to Christian Spirituality: Origins to the Twelfth Century, ed. Bernard McGinn and John Meyendorff, with Jean Leclercq (New York: The Crossroad Publishing Company, 1987), see xvi: “It is possible to distinguish spirituality from doctrine in that it concentrates not on faith itself, but on the reaction that faith arouses in religious consciousness and practice.” Likewise, see Ewert Cousins, “Preface to the Series,” in the same text, xii. “This spiritual core is the deepest centre of the person. It is here that the person is open to the transcendent dimension; it is here that the person experiences ultimate reality . . . It deals with prayer, spiritual direction, the various maps of the spiritual journey, and the method of advancement in the spiritual ascent.” Ibid., xiii. 8 On naturalism, see David Summers, The Judgment of Sense: Renaissance Naturalism and the Rise of Aesthetics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 3–9.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nby scholars as having played a role in producing new relationships between viewers and paintings of sacred images, and the findings of this study have a bearing on this discussion. Most influentially, Hans Belting’s history of cult images presents the Renaissance as the turning point during which the “presence” of holy persons faded from their images, and images became viewed instead as the artist’s presentation of the sacred figure or historical moment.9 Various factors such as the turn to naturalism, objections to images during the Reformation, and the multiple devotional practices that attended them, contributed to this change. Intuitively one might suppose that naturalism would have heightened the spiritual presence of the represented figure, and scholars have likewise discussed how naturalism allowed artists to present spiritual images with a new directness.10 The changing techniques of art making, and the resulting spiritual possibilities of images, have been revisited in recent scholarly arguments that also discuss various “controversies” and “dilemmas” occurring in Renaissance art. Marcia Hall has examined how various artists responded to the challenges facing practitioners of sacred art following the Council of Trent, noting also the problems that arose with the increased naturalism of holy images, which seemed to present the divine realm as continuous with our own.11 Alexander Nagel’s recent study has likewise drawn attention to religious reform as a vital factor, shaping Renaissance art in a condition of “controversy.”12 Belting, Hall, Nagel and others approach the changes that occurred within the art of Renaissance Italy with varying methods—in ways that cannot be unpacked at length here—though each observes changes in Renaissance art within the context of the religious Reformation and Counter-Reformation. This religious 9 See Hans Belting, Likeness and Presence: A History of the Image before the Era of Art, trans. Edmund Jephcott (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1994), particularly chapter 20. 10 See for example Paul Barolsky, “Naturalism and the Visionary Art of the Early Renaissance,” Gazette des Beaux-Arts, ser. 6, 129 (1997). A most provoking suggestion appears in Megan Holmes’ study of miraculous images in Renaissance Florence, which notes how the veneration of miraculous images grew in Florence during the period she identifies as initiating the decline of the image’s “presence.” See “Miraculous Images in Renaissance Florence,” Art History 34 (2011), 437; this publication was followed by her book The Miraculous Image in Renaissance Florence (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013), the full findings of which appeared too recently to be incorporated into this study. 11 See Marcia B. Hall, The Sacred Image in the Age of Art: Titian, Tintoretto, Barocci, El Greco, Caravaggio (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2011). 12 See Alexander Nagel, The Controversy of Renaissance Art (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011).\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\ncontext, as is well known, made the status of sacred images a material problem, necessitating the Catholic Church to revisit and reaffirm the official doctrine legitimizing their use at the Council of Trent. Naturalism, logically, has a place within this discussion since it has been classically argued that the emergence of naturalism was related to a preceding spiritual movement, the mendicant movement, which encouraged vivid imaginings of sacred history.13 Thus, a theme in recent and not-so-recent art historical research frames the issue of naturalism, coming to fruition not long before the Reformation and not long after the mendicant movement, as having had important consequences for sacred images, allowing artists to articulate and visualize sacred personages and history in new ways, but also causing considerable tensions within the devotional sphere, perhaps removing the “presence” of holy figures from their images, or provoking new artistic experiments that might reaffirm the spiritual effectiveness of sacred art. The evidence of this study—whilst not aiming to reconcile the divergent views on naturalism and sacred art and related spiritual movements, nor to definitively define the new spiritual experiences that naturalism made possible—offers fresh evidence on the problem and, therefore, while presenting a rereading of the literature on art and its sources, aims also to deepen the discussion on this problem through a sustained engagement with a group of sources in which contemporary writers expressed their thoughts on art. When read in light of spiritual sources, writings on art suggest that naturalistic representational techniques were thought to bring viewers closer to meaning than previous signs had, and the meaning to which these signs pointed was God.14 This is not to say simply that these pictures were believed 13 See discussion and bibliography in chapter 5. 14 On signs in Christian philosophy, see Marcia Colish, The Mirror of Language: A Study in the Medieval Theory of Knowledge, 2nd ed. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1983), especially chapter 1. Colish investigates the medieval philosophy of signs, particularly St. Augustine’s, noting how “God creates the world and man through his Word, and he takes on humanity in the Word made flesh so that human words may take on divinity, thereby bringing man and the world back to God,” 26. However, “Augustine was forced to conclude that although redeemed speech may be truly expressive, it is not always completely efficacious in conveying the knowledge of God,” 38. Throughout this study I will be demonstrating how we might think of Renaissance images as redeemed signs that surpass some of the barriers that prevented linguistic signs from expressing knowledge of God (Colish’s study investigates the tradition of Augustine’s philosophy of signs up to Dante). I do not, however, argue that these paintings and sculptures were perceived to have completely overcome these barriers. See also Rita Copeland, Rhetoric, Hermeneutic, and Translation in the Middle Ages: Academic Traditions and Vernacular Texts (Cambridge:\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nto look more like their subjects in the sense that a naturalistic painting of the Crucifixion looked more like the Crucifixion than, say, a gothic painting of the same subject (forgetting, for the moment, that this implies the possibility of objectively determining what looks more like something than another thing); rather, “meaning,” in the sentence above, refers to the spiritual meaning of the Crucifixion of Christ, the spiritual reality of salvation for Christians. Thus, as will be discussed in subsequent chapters with reference to the semiotics of St. Augustine, if signs mediate a viewer’s understanding of meaning by pointing, however imperfectly, to a particular meaning, then the naturalistic Crucifixion would appear to be a more effective sign, bringing the viewer closer to the signified meaning. The evidence that I will present in support of this argument does not exclusively concern the degree to which the resulting Crucifixion was thought to “look like” the original Crucifixion; that is, the efficacy of naturalistic images of sacred subjects is not entirely dependent on its visual semblance, though this is a factor. Rather, the efficacy of the sign would appear to stem from the fact that the image is a trace of the artist’s own spiritual engagement with the meaning of the Crucifixion. It is only fitting that the interior and spiritual engagement of the artist should play a role in augmenting the quality of a visual sign in Christian art, since the interior quality of the written signs of the Bible played a fundamental role in Christian spirituality. I argue, therefore, that the work of art is undeniably more intimately associated with the artist, though that it is not necessarily less spiritual for this. In the chapters that follow I will examine this theme as presented in the writings of various authors, each of whom appears to present some evidence in support of this idea, each articulating this concept according to their own particular artistic concerns and thus emphasizing different facets of this general theme. Moreover, as I hope to demonstrate, the efficacy of naturalistic signs does not appear to preclude, in the minds of Renaissance authors, other kinds of efficacy (arising, for instance, from images that are less naturalistic), raising the possibility of multiple approaches to the divine. The multiple approaches to God are perhaps most relevant to a consideration of art in late medieval and Early Modern Europe in light of the fact that this was a period during which images from many periods, embracing many different styles and techniques, lived side by side in devotional contexts. Thus, at the moment in Western history when the visual arts (primarily painting and sculpture) were becoming objects of discussion, the experience of art was articulated using the terms of spiritual experience.

This central theme is developed in the middle chapters of this study (chapter two through five), and it is framed by the first and last chapters, each of which are more concerned about how works of art were experienced by viewers, the first chapter being about a miracle-working painting and the final chapter dealing largely with a dialogue on a series of secular images that nonetheless reveal the persistence of spiritual themes. Thus, though this is not a chronological study, this study aims to trace a single arc of logic. The primary concern in the first chapter is to identify the experience of spiritual compunction as a meaningful lens through which to view the myriad of Christian themes in writings on art. Compunction, related closely to religious penitence, was a central experience in Early Modern Christian spirituality and one that was frequently stimulated through gazing upon (or otherwise interacting with) a material object, either a relic or, increasingly in the Early Modern period, an image; compunction thus serves as a central theme from which many attendant issues stem. To examine this experience, the writings of one sixteenth-century author will be treated in depth: the Florentine scholar Francesco Bocchi, author of numerous treatises on art. One text by Bocchi in particular offers insight into what may be called a truly mystical experience of art: the reaction of viewers to the miracle-working image of the Annunciation at the Santissima Annunziata in Florence. By unpacking the language of compunction utilized by Bocchi to discuss this work of art, and by placing Bocchi’s discussion more broadly within the devotional context of Renaissance Florence, it becomes clear that Bocchi’s terms apply equally to works of art that were not miracle-working. This suggests, therefore, a line of continuity between the works of men and the works of God, with Bocchi clearly implying that all artists should strive to match the spiritual efficacy of the miraculous image. This first chapter is in some ways a prelude to the larger argument about how artists orient themselves in relationship to the natural objects they study and the sacred subjects they represent in images. The experience of compunction in Bocchi’s text entails a complex relationship to materiality: religious compunction often motivates the rejection of material and sensuous experiences, and yet paradoxically it would appear that material objects—particularly, in this case, paintings—had the capacity to provoke this experience. This problem, which is deeply related to the problem of idolatry and the devotion to images in general in a Christian context, is a central theme in this study. As will be discussed, the relationships forged between artists and the subjects they\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nrepresented naturalistically bear upon discussions of the materiality of art and art making. If, by Bocchi’s account, the works of men were supposed to approach the works of God, this would indicate that artists potentially had a certain closeness to Him. That artists were frequently praised for being “divine” is well known.15 Chapters two, three, four and five thus investigate how artists were able to bring themselves closer to the will of God, a closeness which often concerned the artist’s relationship to materiality. Chapter two turns to the book of art theory that is often said to have initiated the theoretical discourse on art, Leon Battista Alberti’s De pictura. Although the text does not obviously pertain to spiritual discourse, when the text is viewed within the Christian tradition of the liberal arts, there are many resonances with contemplative study that may be perceived. Although Alberti is known for being one of the first to advocate the sustained study of nature as a prelude to artistic activity, close reading of his text reveals harmonies between the artist’s practice and meditation. Particularly, my concern is to demonstrate how Alberti recommends that artists take a particular position with respect to the objects of nature that they study and the material objects of art they produce. Thus, the study of nature and the naturalistic images that it creates demands from the artist a particular habit of mind that resists the material and sensuous temptations of nature: not to engage with nature with a sensuous desire but rather only to find God’s presence within it. To some readers this may seem to revisit an earlier theory of Renaissance art, notably explored by Panofsky, that in the Renaissance, naturalistic paintings or sculptures were believed to have had some closeness to the Platonic Ideas: artists could find the laws of nature, or the divine Forms upon which all forms are based, by using their judgment.16 Throughout this study, the similarities and differences between Platonism and Christianity will be reflected upon, while the argument will be made that in some cases evidence of Neoplatonic philosophy in writings on art may best be illuminated by Christian texts. Though there are many similarities, the meaning of God in the Christian religion is\n\n15 On the history of this term as applied to artists, see Patricia A. Emison, Creating the “Divine” Artist: From Dante to Michelangelo (Leiden: Brill, 2004). 16 See Panofsky, Idea, 65. “An Idea which is produced by the human mind but . . . at the same time expresses the laws of nature embodied in each object, achieves basically the same thing . . . that Alberti, Leonardo, and Dürer had tried to achieve.”\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nnot philosophically identical with the Platonic Ideas.17 For example, for the Christian it would not be enough to know that he or she could improve upon nature in his or her pictorial imitation: he or she would also have to believe that in painting such an ideal nature, he or she was behaving in accordance to God’s will. Making art as a religious practice, however, does not figure prominently in Panofsky’s discussion of the philosophy of Ideas in Renaissance art theory. Although this is not an adequate representation of Panofsky’s thesis (nor is it intended as a refutation), it does highlight some questions that have not been greatly discussed in Renaissance art theory: though there has been ample discussion on what subjects were thought to be religiously correct topics for painting, fewer scholars have inquired into what intention of mind might have been required of a Renaissance artist to paint any given subject. That is, how specifically could the action of painting bring the artist to God (and consequently lead the viewer to God as well)? Given two identical looking paintings of the Crucifixion, how could one convey the knowledge of God more than the other? It shall be argued that this was believed not only to be possible but was also a recurring theme in the literature on art. Chapter three develops the argument concerning Alberti by considering the writings of the author and artist often said to be his successor in the field of art theory, Leonardo da Vinci. Starting with a group of spiritual texts included in a list of books drawn up by Leonardo, presumably indicating the contents of his library, I illustrate how writings on artistic practice in his manuscripts recall principles found in the popular spiritual texts he owned. As in Alberti, many precepts regarding artistic study echo ideals of contemplation. Themes relating to communication through visual art also appear to be closely related to discussions regarding signs and the imperfection of communication after the fall of man. Within a discourse on the imperfection of man’s signs, Leonardo appears to posit the painter’s signs as nearer to perfection, using language shaded with spiritual meanings to convey this argument. As noted, the textual sources for this study encompass a broad historical period, during which time several changes affected the exchange of literary ideas and the history of art. One factor was the changing nature of the reading public as a result of the printing press. With regard to fifteenth-century writings, manuscripts were circulated amongst a small group of elite readers.18 The sixteenth century saw greater numbers of authors writing on art and, likewise, 17 In general, see Etienne Gilson, The Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy (Gifford Lectures 1931–1932), trans. A.H.C. Downes (London: Sheed & Ward, 1936; facs. ed., Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2007). 18 See Baxandall, Giotto and the Orators, 127–129.\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\ngreater numbers of readers. Many books written on art during this period had the potential, sometimes fulfilled, to reach a large number of educated upperclass readers.19 Judging by their appearance, form, and literary tone, these books were often meant for general consumption.20 Accordingly, in chapters four and five, a range of printed sources are considered together, looking at how they relate both to one another and the printed spiritual sources of the time. These chapters likewise broadly consider the question of how artists imagined and visualized sacred topics. In chapter four I move from a consideration of the intellectual habit that characterizes the study of nature in Alberti and Leonardo, and introduce a discussion of the problems and concerns that artists faced representing the bodies that appeared in sacred histories, and the challenges of representing the soul that animated the body. This question is divided into two parts: how was it that bodies could make evident the virtue of the soul, and, secondly, how was the painter capable of imagining perfect virtue as seen on the body of a sacred figure? With respect to the second question, the problems that Renaissance artists encountered while trying to imagine faces are explored, noting that the progress of an artist could proceed down two paths: first, the improvement of the science of his or her art (his or her ability to represent the material world), or, secondly, the improvement of his or her soul. An attendant issue explored here is the manner in which Renaissance artists used the techniques of naturalism to “animate” their products, not only by giving life-likeness to their figures, but also by embedding various devotional practices that were customarily believed to enhance the “presence” of a devotional object—such as the veiling of sacred objects and images—into the very practice of painting. The second part of chapter four explores how virtue could reside on the face or on the body of the virtuous person, considering the problematic desire to 19 The two editions of Giorgio Vasari’s biographies of Renaissance artists (1550 & 1568) attest to the popularity a book on art could achieve. 20 On the design of popular books, see Paul F. Grendler, “Form and Function in Italian Renaissance Popular Books,” Renaissance Quarterly 46 (1993). See also D.R. Edward Wright, “Structure and Significance in Dolce’s L’Aretino,” Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 45 (1987), 280.

At issue here are the different values of signs according to the semiotic theories of St. Augustine. By reading Renaissance art theory in light of Augustine’s semiotics, naturalistic paintings and sculptures emerge, particularly in the writings of Francesco Bocchi, as particularly efficient signs conducive to spiritual experiences. The effects of the Counter-Reformation have also been noted as a substantial cultural development that impacted Renaissance writings on art. Chapter five considers the effects of the Counter-Reformation in relation to the broader question of how artists imagined moments from sacred history. As will become clear throughout this book, I treat the Counter-Reformation less as a marked shift in the general attitude towards art, and more as an event that emphasized beliefs that could already be perceived in earlier writings on art, if less prominently. There are thus continuities that exist between the literature on art before and after the Counter-Reformation, and it is valid to attend to the themes that unite these two periods. The Counter-Reformation theologian Gabriele Paleotti is a central focus of this chapter, and yet relationships between his writings and those of Giorgio Vasari, Ludovico Dolce and others are noted. Progressing from a consideration of bodies (in chapter four), chapter five investigates the challenges of creating a pictorial composition of a sacred narrative, or pictorial invention. Considering the history of the word “invention” reveals how the composition of a historical narrative engaged with the traditions of biblical exegesis, contemplative invention and sacred oratory. The representation of nature, as discussed in this chapter, becomes deeply related to and guided by scriptural exegesis, and the intellectual and artistic habits discussed in chapters two and three are implicated within the contemplative tradition of ruminating on and amplifying the Bible. Having discussed the spiritual dimension of artistic practice in the middle four chapters of this book, the final chapter returns to the experience of visual art from the viewer’s perspective, though focusing primarily on a text describing the experience of secular art. Chapter six investigates spiritual themes in the writings of likely the most-read sixteenth-century writer on art, Giorgio Vasari. Looking particularly at architectural themes in both his biographical writings as well as his literary descriptions of his own paintings, I consider how his concept of architecture calls upon a range of spiritual themes engaging with, amongst other things, biblical hermeneutics and the spiritual meanings of history. This discussion culminates in a meditation on the similarities between Vasari’s literary descriptions of his own, secular works of art in the Palazzo Vecchio of Florence, and a method of biblical exegesis developed by Hugh of St. Victor, demonstrating how Christian sources are woven\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\ninto discussions of secular art, provoking questions on the lingering spiritual importance of such cultural migrations. Though this study cannot be an exhaustive history of Christian themes in writings on art, it does aim to present a representative sample comprising numerous literary perspectives that reveal their debt to the language developed by spiritual writers from early Christianity through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Unpacking the relationship between medieval Christian sources and Renaissance writings on art offers a view onto the spiritual experiences related to the creation of and experience of visual art in Early Modern Italy; these sources are particularly valuable for offering a perspective on the subjective interior experiences and methods associated with artistic experience.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nArt and Compunction: Francesco Bocchi’s Mystical Experience of Art\n\nCompunction in Renaissance Literature on Art\n\nThe flowering of literature on art during the Italian Renaissance, as discussed in the introduction, has often been linked to humanist interest in classical culture. Despite the clear relationship between the two, it would be difficult to deny the presence of Christian themes in Renaissance writings on art, though no thorough attempt has been made to delineate their scope and character. Amidst the variety of devotional patterns and practices that shaped Renaissance attitudes toward art (and therefore, amidst the many possible starting points for this study), the theme of religious compunction and penitence is particularly rich and I have chosen it as a lens through which to view the myriad of spiritual motifs that are woven into fifteenth- and sixteenth-century texts on art in Italy. This chapter will outline the nature of religious compunction and illustrate how it can help unpack many spiritual terms, metaphors and concepts in Italian Renaissance writings on art. Following this, a more in-depth consideration of one particular sixteenth-century text on art, Francesco Bocchi’s treatise in praise of the miracle-working image of the Annunciation at the church of the Santissima Annunziata in Florence, will further reveal the complex interrelationships between the devotional experience of compunction and the writings on art of the Italian Renaissance. Throughout this book, compunction will continue to serve as a point of orientation, bringing into focus the spiritual qualities of writings on art. Compunction is an enduring element in Christian spirituality. It had a strong presence in Latin patristic literature as well as in spiritual texts of the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. Briefly stated, compunction is a movement of God within the soul causing man or woman to feel grief for his or her sins, inspiring him or her to reject worldly goods, to purge his or her soul, and finally to rebuild his or her soul in God alone.1 It is related to the guilt and misery that comes from worldly experience and, in contemporary parlance, 1 For an overview, see New Catholic Encyclopaedia, 2nd ed., 15 vols. (Detroit: Thomson Gale, in association with the Catholic University of America, 2003), s.v. “compunction.” The literature on compunction is surveyed in Piroska Nagy, Le don des larmes au Moyen âge: un instrument\n\n© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���5 | doi ��.��63/9789004283923_003\n\nArt and Compunction\n\n17\n\ncompunction often means simply guilt. In the medieval Christian tradition, as described by the medieval historian Jean Leclercq, within the worldly misery of terrestrial life, the grace of God was said to provoke an internal “piercing” or “pressing” (cum-pungere), a spiritual pain that motivated man to reject sensual pleasure and to love only the spiritual gifts of God.2 Leclercq writes that compunction was a “pain of the spirit” leading to “humility, detachment from the world . . . and the consciousness of our need for God.”3 Compunction, therefore, entailed both the pain of guilt and the joy of God’s love.4 The notion of painful love, naturally, precedes Christianity, and occurs for instance in the Song of Songs, where the bridegroom reveals that the bride has “ravished [his] heart with a glance of [her] eyes” (Song of Sol. 4:9);5 equally, in pagan sources, cupid literally pierces the heart with love.6 In St. Augustine’s spirituel en quête d’institution (ve–xiiie siècle), preface Alain Boureau (Paris: Albin Michel, 2000), 29–33. 2 “In its original profane use, the word ‘compunction’ is a medical term, designating attacks of acute pain, of physical illness . . . Compunction becomes pain of the spirit.” See Jean Leclercq, The Love of Learning and the Desire for God, trans. Catherine Misrahi (New York: New American Library, 1962), 29–30. 3 Ibid., 29. Leclercq is speaking specifically of the experience of compunction in the writings of St. Gregory the Great. On the compunction of Gregory, see also Bernard McGinn, ed., The Essential Writings of Christian Mysticism (New York: Modern Library, 2006), 367–373, and Bernard McGinn, The Presence of God: A History of Western Christian Mysticism (New York: Crossroad, 1992), 2: 58–50. 4 On the double aspect of compunction see Leclercq, Love of Learning, 29–31.

Sometimes he . . . lifts up our hearts to desire the eternal world . . . Sometimes he discloses to us our own evil deeds . . . pierced with a wonderful feeling of compunction.8 Gregory especially promulgated the theme of compunction among countless writers throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance and, as shall be seen, the penitential dimensions of this subject became important in Italian texts from the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. In Gregory’s writings and in those of other medieval authors, compunction is often a mystical experience in which it is “God Himself who is working in us by His mysterious action.”9 Likewise, St. Bernard of Clairvaux described the presence of Christ within him as a “motion of [his] heart,” as a result of which “vices were banished and . . . carnal desires were repressed.”10 Consequently, Bernard “perceived [Christ’s] beauty from the recasting and renewal of the 7 Augustine, Confessions, trans.

The concept of being pierced visually by love is present already in the Song of Songs in which it is the eye of the lover that wounds the bridegroom, a motif that is later elaborated in chivalric romances and spiritual writings of the High Middle Ages.14 Notably, some Renaissance sources suggest that the idea of being pierced visually was blended with the theory of optics and perspective. For instance, Michael Kubovy has presented several Renaissance texts on perspective that metaphorically speak of perspectival illusion as an arrow piercing the eye.15 As Kubovy notes, some Renaissance paintings appear to make reference to this metaphor, suggesting specifically an image by Andrea Mantegna 11 Bernard of Clairvaux, translation from McGinn, Essential Writings, 224. “et ex renovatione ac reformatione spiritus mentis meae, id est interioris hominis mei, percepi utcunque speciem decoris ejus.” Bernard of Clairvaux, Sancti Bernardi sermones in cantica Sermo 74 (Migne, pl 183.1141). 12 Carruthers, Craft of Thought, 95–96, has described how compunction was a feeling that was self-induced during monastic prayer. 13 The literature on the topic of visual imagery and meditation is extensive, and is discussed in more depth in chapter 5. On affective meditation, see Rachel Fulton, From Judgment to Passion: Devotion to Christ and the Virgin Mary, 800–1200 (New York: Columbia University Press, 2002); Sarah McNamer, Affective Meditation and the Invention of Medieval Compassion (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010). On Franciscanism and visual imagery in sermons and meditation in the Florentine High Middle Ages, see Daniel Lesnick, Preaching in Medieval Florence: The Social World of Franciscan and Dominican Spirituality (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1989), and Denise Despres, Ghostly Sights: Visual Meditation in Late-Medieval Literature (Norman: Pilgrim Books, 1989). On the influence of this meditative tradition on art, see, for example, the essays in Hamburger and Bouché, The Mind’s Eye; a much cited discussion of this concept with respect to Italian art is Michael Baxandall’s Painting and Experience, 45–56. On general devotional attitudes toward religious images see Michele Bacci, “Pro remedio animae:” immagini sacre e pratiche in Italia centrale (secoli xiii e xiv) (Pisa: ets, 2000). 14 As in, for example, the writings of Gilbert of Hoyland and Guillaume de Lorris’ Roman de la Rose, both discussed with respect to this theme in Newman, “Christ as Cupid,” 271 and 281 respectively. 15 Michael Kubovy, The Psychology of Perspective and Renaissance Art (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), 10–15.\n\n20\n\nChapter 1\n\nfigure 1 Domenico Veneziano, Martyrdom of Saint Lucy (1445/48).

Likewise, I suggest that in this and another painting discussed by Kubovy by Domenico Veneziano, of the piercing of a body directly over the painting’s vanishing point, we may perceive further spiritual meanings.16 For instance, Veneziano’s Martyrdom of Saint Lucy places the vanishing point of the composition directly over the hand carrying the knife that pierces Saint Lucy’s neck, hence merging the point opposite of which the painting is ideally viewed with the instrument that leads to the Saint’s martyrdom (Figure 1). 16 Ibid., 10–15. Kubovy discusses these paintings, though not to explore their spiritual implications. More recently on the spiritual implications of perspective see John F. Moffitt, Painterly Perspective and Piety: Religious Uses of the Vanishing Point, from the 15th to the 18th Century (Jefferson, nc: McFarland & Company, 2008).\n\nArt and Compunction\n\n21\n\nfigure 2 Andrea Mantegna, The Martyrdom and Translocation of the Body of Saint Christopher (detail of people in windows) (1451–5).

In another instance, Mantegna’s painting of The Martyrdom and Translocation of the Body of Saint Christopher shows King Samos being pierced in the eye by an arrow intended for Saint Christopher, the wound of which is afterward healed when it is bathed in the blood of the later decapitated Saint, a miracle that then persuades the King to convert to Christianity (Figure 2).17 This story from the Golden Legend, illustrated with perspectival accuracy by Mantegna, demonstrates literally the propositions made metaphorically in the writings discussed above: namely, that a life of sin brings the pain of compunction through which we regain “true” sight and joy. Without discussing in-depth the mingling of spiritual language and perspectival technique, the overlapping themes suggest that the literary trope of piercing the soul through the eye was implicated in the emerging art of perspective and naturalism more broadly. Thus, the common motif of love puncturing the eye, as well as the widespread 17 Kubovy, Pyschology of Perspective, 8–9.\n\n22\n\nChapter 1\n\npractice of using mental pictures and images in meditations aiming to provoke compunction, may in part explain how compunction emerges naturally as a theme in Renaissance writings on visual art. Some aspects of compunction discussed above relate to questions being explored in contemporary art-historical scholarship, for instance the importance of sight to conversion, the relationship between the mystical experience and art, and the rejection of the material world. Recent art-historical scholarship has noted the primacy of sight in the religious experiences of the Early Modern period, particularly with respect to penitence and conversion. Thomas Worcester has examined images in Early Modern Italy as evidence of a spirituality of hope and conversion or transformation, adding complexity to the understanding of Early Modern spirituality that emerges from the study of texts alone.18 In paintings that actually depict religious conversion or mystical union, scholars have also noted how questions about naturalistic painting are foregrounded in these images, since they purport to record the visual appearances of interior experiences and visions of a celestial nature. A classic example of this tension emerges in paintings of mystical union that border on the erotic, and Victor Stoichita, for example, has investigated various strategies used by Spanish artists to depict the “multi-sensory experience” of mystical union in art.19 The problems associated with having the real and celestial worlds overlap are also discussed recently in Alexander Nagel’s broad exploration of Renaissance art of the first half of the sixteenth; among the various case studies presented by Nagel, for example, are the problems that emerge when the naturalistic depiction of sacred history becomes a stage for the likenesses of contemporary people in the guise of holy people, thereby doubling representations and making the religious image an opportunity for display.20 Also at issue in these converging paths in art-historical scholarship are questions regarding the charismatic appeal and contradictory qualities of art objects which use material substances manipulated by artistic craft to seduce and engage viewers into holy experiences that aim ultimately to inspire Christians to reject these sensory pleasures. Questions regarding the materiality of images, and the desire for spiritual elevation are also evident, for example,\n\n18 See Thomas Worcester, “Trent and Beyond: Arts of Transformation,” in Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image, ed. Franco Mormando (Chestnut Hill, ma: McMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, distributed by the University of Chicago Press, 1999). 19 Victor I. Stoichita, Visionary Experience in the Golden Age of Spanish Art (London: Reaktion Books, 1995), 123, and in general see chapter 6 on the “mystical eros.”. 20 Nagel, The Controversy of Renaissance Art, 13–29.\n\nArt and Compunction\n\n23\n\nin writings on medieval art by Herbert Kessler and Caroline Walker Bynum.21 Some central themes in recent art-historical scholarship thus examine sacred art, particularly in the Early Modern period when image-making techniques were shifting toward greater naturalism and thereby combining manual craft with a rational understanding of visual perception, and questions what implications this had for the viewer’s spiritual relationship to the art object. Related to this are questions regarding the relationship between conversion, and the new status of the artist and the image. In this chapter, I explore how looking at the theme of compunction in writings on art from Renaissance Italy sheds light on Early Modern attitudes regarding the sensuous appeal of images and conversion. Though to my knowledge no study has examined the presence of compunctive themes in Renaissance literature on art, the common literary patterns that had conventionally evoked the experience of compunction in spiritual literature of the Middle Ages are frequently rehearsed in the Renaissance to discuss the experience of art: the tears of repentance and joy, the purging and nourishing of the soul, the rejection of the material world, and the journey upward toward God. Though later in this chapter the theme of compunction will be treated with respect to a very particular artistic, literary and spiritual context in the sixteenth century (the church of the Santissima Annunziata in Florence), at the moment I will range through a selection of Early Modern Italian writers (mainly from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries) to demonstrate the presence and importance of this theme in general. Paintings could play an integral part in the experience of compunction in late medieval Italy, as is illustrated in a passage from the widely circulated book that illuminates many of the themes discussed in this chapter: Lo specchio della vera penitenza (The mirror of true penitence) by the Florentine friar Jacopo Passavanti (1302–1357).22 Passavanti recalls the story of a young nobleman, hoping to regain his riches, who renounces his faith in Christ when urged to do so by a demon. The young man is overcome with grief, however, when he is asked to renounce the Virgin Mary. He leaves the demon feeling “penitent and compuncted,” and then goes to a church where he finds “a Virgin Mary with the [Christ] Child in her arms, painted and sculpted of wood,” before 21 See Herbert L. Kessler, Spiritual Seeing: Picturing God’s Invisibility in Medieval Art (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000); Caroline Walker Bynum, Christian Materiality: An Essay on Religion in Late Medieval Europe (New York: Zone Books, 2011). 22 On penitential texts and the Franciscan movement in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, see John V. Fleming, An Introduction to the Franciscan Literature of the Middle Ages (Chicago: Franciscan Herald Press, 1977), 167–173.\n\n24\n\nChapter 1\n\nwhich he begins crying and “asks mercy and pardon for the great wrong he had committed.”23 Eventually the figures in the painted panel begin speaking with one another, and the Virgin implores her Son to have mercy on the young man until Christ reluctantly yields to her petitions.24 Through the prevalent cult of Mary in the late Middle Ages, the story demonstrates the extent to which an image could participate in the compunctive and penitential experience leading to conversion and redemption. It is an act of God that brings the art object to life, though through this story the reader understands that the art object is a gateway through which the prayers of the nobleman are channeled toward Mary and Christ, acting as a bridge between the penitent and the sacred.25 The story is an apt example of medieval attitudes toward images, since divine intervention enlivens the material object, and questions about the artist’s agency are not part of the narrative. The late medieval attitudes toward paintings embedded within this story recur in similar passages found in Renaissance literature. Sometimes medieval sources are openly cited in Renaissance texts, illustrating a continuous tradition, as is the case in the theologian Gregorio Comanini’s Il Figino overo del fine della pittura (The Figino, or, On the Purpose of Painting), a dialogue on painting from 1591 set in northern Italy. To properly contextualize Comanini’s use of medieval sources it must be placed within the context of the CounterReformation and the heightened religious conservatism that followed the Council of Trent (a topic treated in later chapters). Presently, however, his text serves to illustrate the presence of compunctive themes in Renaissance literature and the continuing relevance of medieval spiritual experiences. In a passage discussing the religious use of images, the interlocutors frequently cite the proceedings of the Second Council of Nicaea (787), at which the use of sacred icons was affirmed.26 Comanini’s interlocutors inform readers that 23 “E vegnendo per la via, e ripensando il grande suo peccato d’avere rinnegato iddio, pentuto e compunto entrò in una chiesa, dov’era la Vergine Maria dipinta col Figliuolo in braccio, di legname scolpita; davanti alla quale riverentemente inginocchiandosi e dirottamente piagendo, domandò misericordia e perdonanza del grande fallo che commesso avea.” Jacopo Passavanti, Lo Specchio della vera penitenza, in Mistici del duecento e del trecento, ed. Arrigo Levasti (Milan: Rizzoli Editori, 1935), 703 (unless otherwise noted, all translations are mine). 24 “A queste parole la immagine si levò in piede, e posto il Figliuolo in sull’altare, si gittò ginocchione davanti a lui, e disse: ‘Dolcissimo Figliuol mio, io ti priego che per lo mio amore tue perdoni a questo cavaliere contrito il suo peccato.’ ” Ibid., 704. 25 On this theme more broadly, see Bacci, “Pro remedio animae”, 14–19. 26 An introduction to the proceedings of the Second Council of Nicea (or the Seventh Ecumenical Council) can be found discussed by Daniel J. Sahas, introduction to Icon and Logos: Sources in Eighth-Century Iconoclasm (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1986).\n\nArt and Compunction\n\n25\n\nimages were justified in part for their ability to inspire pity in the viewer. The interlocutors recall how the Council heard the description of an image of the martyrdom of St. Euphemia, after which “many fathers of the Sinod compuncted themselves having only heard the description of this painted story, and cried their sins.”27 Here, illustrating how compunction could be provoked by contemplation of mental as well as painted imagery, the tears of compunction arise from the awareness of one’s own unworthiness next to the holiness of a Saint. As in Comanini’s text, many Renaissance writers discuss religious compunction and art with respect to the justification of religious images, albeit often fleetingly. To take one further example, the dialogue on art by the Florentine writer, Raffaello Borghini, published in 1584, entitled Il Riposo (named after the villa at which the dialogue takes place), rehearses common justifications for religious images derived from Gregory the Great. At an early moment in the dialogue, the interlocutors defend religious images on the grounds that through teaching the stories of the Bible to the illiterate, images can teach what should rightly be adored and what should not be adored.28 For an image to be edifying in this way, one of the interlocutors argues, the artist “must observe in their painting . . . honesty, reverence and devotion; such that the viewers . . . are compuncted with penitence by looking at the work . . . [rather than] being moved to lasciviousness.”29 Here, the painting’s ability to inspire compunction\n\n27 “si come ancora Padri di quella Sinodo si compunsero nell’udir leggere il solo racconto di questa dipinta istoria e piansero i loro peccati.” Gregorio Comanini, Il Figino overo del fine della pittura, in Trattati d’arte del Cinquecento fra manierismo e controriforma, ed. Paola Barocchi (Bari: G. Laterza, 1962), 3: 311. My translation was made in consultation with Gregorio Comanini, The Figino, or, On the Purpose of Painting: Art Theory in the Late Renaissance trans. Ann Doyle-Anderson and Giancarlo Maiorino (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001). The original description of the image can be found in English in Sahas, Icon and Logos, 129–131. 28 “disse San Gregorio, altro è adorare le pitture, altro per l’historia delle pitture quello che sia da adorare imprendere; percioché la pittura a gli idioti riguardanti quello mostra, che la scrittura a gli studiosi delle sacre carte insegna.” Raffaello Borghini, Il Riposo di Raffaello Borghini, in cui della pittura, e della scultura si favella . . . (Florence: Giorgio Marescotti, 1584), 77. Citations from Il Riposo refer to the first edition, though an e-book produced by Paola Barocchi and made available at http://www.memofonte.it/ has also been consulted; my translations have also been prepared in consultation with the translation in Raffaello Borghini, Il Riposo, trans. Lloyd H. Ellis (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2007). 29 “che sempre osservar deono nelle lor pitture, è l’onestà, la riverenza e la divozione; acciò che i riguardanti in cambio di compugnersi a penitenza nel rimirare quelle, più tosto non si commuovano a lascivia.” Ibid., 78.\n\n26\n\nChapter 1\n\ndetermines the success of the religious painting and hence becomes a concern for the painter and the proper practice of their their art. Compunction is diametrically opposed to the sins of worldly pleasures (lasciviousness), and it is the painter’s responsibility to paint with a pious intention (observing “honesty, reverence and devotion”) so as to inspire devotion in viewers. This both illustrates how compunction is fundamentally concerned with relinquishing sensual appetites, and also how the compunctive efficacy of a work of art was not only due to the grace of God (as was the case in the story described by Passavanti), but also to the skill and piety of the painter. One painting that might have inspired compunction in viewers, by Borghini’s standard, is the painting of Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery by Allesandro Allori found in the church of Santo Spirito in Florence (Figure 3).30 This painting is singled out for praise in Borghini’s dialogue by one of the interlocutors who notes that the figure of the adulteress is “beyond being well ornamented, she is arranged in that way that shows the shame of her error,” and, elsewhere in the dialogue the figure is described as demonstrating the “shame and penitence” of her sin.31 The artist has thus created a figure who, as she turns away from lasciviousness, expresses the guilt and shame that were associated with religious compunction. Other passages in sixteenth-century literature suggest that the shame seen on the adulteress may have encouraged the feeling of culpability in viewers. This process of what may be called “empathetic compunction” is illustrated in the second edition of Giorgio Vasari’s Vite de’ più eccellenti pittori scultori e architettori (Lives of the Artists), published in 1568, in which Vasari describes one of Titian’s late paintings of the Penitent Mary Magdalen (Figure 4).32\n\n30 See Ellis in the introduction to Borghini, Il Riposo, 30, where it is noted that this is one of the few paintings that receives only praise in the dialogue. The painting, commissioned for the Cini family altar, is discussed by Simona Lecchini Giovannoni, Alessandro Allori (Turin: Umberto Allemandi & C., 1991), 240–241. 31 “e particolarmente mi piace la femina colta in fallo, la quale oltre all’essere benissimo ornata, è acconcia in tal atto che dimostra vergogna del suo errore.” Borghini, Il Riposo, 203. “e particolarmente cotesta femina, che dimostra vergogna e pentimento del fallo commesso”. Ibid., 114. 32 On Titian’s many paintings of the penitent Magdalene, see Harold E. Wethey, The Paintings of Titian: Complete Edition. i.

It may be that images which first seduced the viewers’ carnal thoughts could potently inspire 33 “mentre ella alzando la testa con gl’occhi fissi al cielo, mostra compunzione nel rossore degl’occhi, e nelle lachrime dogliezza de’ peccati. Onde muove questa pittura, chiunche la guarda, estremamente. E che è piu, ancorche sia bellissima, non muove a lascivia, ma a comiserazione.” Giorgio Vasari, Vite de’ più eccellenti pittori scultori e architettori (Florence: Giunti, 1568) 3: 816. Several modern editions of Vasari have been consulted in the course of research, especially the editions by Rosanna Bettarini and Paola Barocchi, and Gaetano Milanesi; the translations by Gaston Du C. DeVere and George Bull have also been consulted in the preparation of my own translations (full details on editions and translations in the bibliography). Citations from the text of Vasari’s Vite refer to the 1568 Giunti edition unless it is otherwise stated that the Torrentiana is being cited. Later, the poet Giambattista Marino would describe this (or a similar) painting by Titian, evoking again the language of the pain of compunction (pentita, piagne, colpe, etc.) and also that of love (amata, amante, amor, etc.); see James V. Mirollo, The Poet of the Marvelous: Giambattista Marino (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), 286–293. 34 On expressions of grief in Renaissance art, see Moshe Barasch, “The Crying Face,” in Imago Homonis. Studies in the Language of Art (Vienna: irsa, 1991). 35 See, for instance, Pamela Jones, “The Power of Images: Paintings and Viewers in Caravaggio’s Italy,” Thomas Worcester, “Trent and Beyond: Arts of Transformation,” and Franco Mormando, “Teaching the Faithful to Fly: Mary Magdalene and Peter in Baroque Italy,” all in Franco Mormando, ed., Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio & the Baroque Image (Chestnut Hill, ma: McMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, distributed by the University of Chicago Press, 1999).\n\n30\n\nChapter 1\n\ncompunction since these images recalled viewers to their base appetites before reminding them to shun these desires.36 By viewing Titian’s Magdalene pictures within the framework of spiritual compunction we are made aware that compunction, even though it renounces earthly preoccupations, cannot really exist without being preceded by them and transforming them into a passionate love of God. Though scholars have traditionally wrestled with the mixed sexuality and spirituality of the image, the devotional experience of compunction helps to make sense of images in which sexuality, carnal appetites, guilt and the passionate love of Christ are entirely appropriate together.37 The pain of compunction is a purgative experience during which God cleanses the soul of sin.38 For example, the penitence of the Magdalene was described as simultaneously painful yet renewing in the sense that through her grief, God purged sin from her soul. In a work of Gregory the Great, for instance, which is discussed and quoted in Passavanti’s Specchio della vera penitenza, Gregory argues that the Magdalene’s penitence is efficacious for being infused with love. Gregory, in Passavanti’s text, asks rhetorically, “what would we call love, if not a fire? . . . So much more, therefore, is the tarnish of sin consumed, the more strongly the heart burns with love.”39 Because her penitence is full of love, it is able to burn sin away and purge her soul. The tears of compunction were a standard trope for demonstrating the “tarnish of sin” being purged from the soul and were a leitmotif of medieval spiritual literature. Gregory the Great writes that once “the mind . . . pierces itself with the sword 36 A similar argument is suggested by Bernard Aikema, “Titian’s Mary Magdalen in the Palazzo Pitti: An Ambiguous Painting and Its Critics,” Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 57 (1994), 52–53. 37 In addition to Aikema, “Titian’s Mary Magdalen,” recent discussions include Nirit BenAryeh Debby, “Vittoria Colonna and Titian’s Pitti ‘Magdalen’,” Woman’s Art Journal 24, no. 1 (2003). 38 Leclerq, Love of Learning, 30, writes that the “ultimate role of compunction is to bring the soul a longing for Heaven . . . tears of love always accompany those of penitence; but more and more these are dominated by tears of joy.” See also Straw, Gregory the Great, 218: “Gregory may have believed, as others did, that tears of compunction release excessive humours, helping the soul regain balance and self-control.” 39 “Che diremo noi che sia l’amore, se non un fuoco? . . . Tanto, dunque, più si consuma la ruggine del peccato, quanto il cuore arde di maggiore amore.” Passavanti, Specchio della vera penitenza, 706. Similar sentiments concerning Mary Magdalene are rehearsed in Pietro Bembo’s Book of the Courtier, in which the Saint is said to be forgiven of her sins for her great love; see Debby, “Vittoria Colonna and Titian,” 31. On the Magdalene as an examplar for penitence, see K. Ludwig Jansen, The Making of the Magdalen: Preaching and Popular Devotion in the Later Middle Ages (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1999), chapter 7.\n\nArt and Compunction\n\n31\n\nof compunction, . . . [it] can do nothing but weep and by its tears, wash away its stains.”40 Crying, hence, expelled sin from the soul whilst it discharged bodily fluid. A book by Brunoro Pistorozzi, Virtu di lagrime (The virtue of tears), demonstrates that the tears of compunction were still a living convention in sixteenth-century Italy.41 Pistorozzi writes that tears are the realization of misery and the beginning of the path to salvation. True misery exists in those who are “for the hardness of their heart deprived of the tears of compunction,” since they will therefore not find salvation.42 Titian’s painting of the Magdalene, with its crystalline tears noted by Vasari, illustrates the pictorial expression of this convention.43 The tears of compunction likewise recur frequently in Renaissance literature on art, even in the writings of authors who were not singularly concerned with theological questions. For example, in the nearly encyclopedic treatise on painting published in 1584 by Giovan Paolo Lomazzo, there is a list of the kinds of images that could produce the guilt and shame of compunction. Lomazzo writes that Many wicked people and sinners who had already forgotten God, having seen the Holy image of Christ flagellated . . . have made great penitence, returning in themselves and spreading rivers of bitter tears . . . many proud and lustful people, seeing the image of Our Lady, have become\n\n40 Gregory the Great, Homilaiae in Ezechielem 2.2.1, translation in Cuthbert Butler, Western Mysticism: The Teaching of ss.

On the phenomenon of tears in art and crying in response to a painting, see James Elkins, Pictures and Tears: A History of People Who Have Cried in Front of Paintings (New York: Routledge, 2001), particularly chapter 9 on compunction.

In this image, the presence of and emphasis given to tears suggests that it may have provoked compunction in its viewers: it is not hard to imagine that the tears of the Virgin, articulated with crystal-like precision, may have induced the tears of viewers, not only in empathy for the sadness of Mary, but 44 “Percioche molti scelerati, & peccatori scordatisi gia di dio, vedendo la santissima imagine di Christo flagellato . . . ritornando in se stess, & spargendo da gl’occhi fiumi d’amare lagrime hanno fatto asprissima penitenza . . . molti superbi, & lussuriosi vedendo l’imagine di nostra Donna, hanno seguito l’humilità & castità; molti impenitenti, vendeno il ritratto Maddalena, di santa Maria Egittiaca, & altri santi hanno lasciato le delitie de le città & seguito l’asprezza de la solitudine . . .” Giovan Paolo Lomazzo, Trattato dell’arte della pittura, scoltura, et architettura (Milan, 1584), 5.\n\nArt and Compunction\n\n33\n\nalso in contemplation of the fact that Christ had died for their sins. A cartellino depicted at the bottom of the painting on the front of Christ’s sarcophagus makes this point by declaring that “when these swelling eyes evoke groans this [very] work of Giovanni Bellini could shed tears.”45 By stating that the painting itself might begin to shed tears if it could successfully inspire viewers to feel compunction, the inscription suggests that its power approaches that of a living being when it persuades viewers to experience an emotion. The presence of compunction in this sampling of writers is not surprising: since these images served religious purposes, it makes sense that the images should conjure the recollection of medieval spiritual language. However, as can already be faintly perceived in the selection above, these texts describe a relationship between compunction and visual art that is not merely a recitation of medieval tropes but rather a renewal and reworking of these themes in light of new discourses on art. In fact, there is a complex interaction between compunction and the work of art that emerges in Renaissance writings which, as noted in the introduction, articulated the meanings and methods of the newly emerged art of naturalistic painting and sculpture. In the medieval tale told by Passavanti, the artist who created the work was not a central actor in the story; however, in other examples explored above, the artist’s agency plays a fundamental role, and though these later writings do not involve miracles per se, the drama of conversion is still preserved according to the medieval conventions of compunction. To demonstrate how compunction is a theme that is entwined with many central issues in Renaissance literature on art, and to illustrate how looking at the literature on art through the lens of spiritual themes can enhance our understanding of Renaissance art, the remainder of this chapter focuses on one particularly rich religious, literary and artistic context in sixteenth-century Florence: the cult of the Annunciation at the church of the Santissima Annunziata in Florence. Here, a miracle-working image, with features believed not to have been made by human hand, became a focal point for reflections on art and provoked contemplations more broadly on the nature of artistic ability and the role of images in religious experiences.\n\n45 “HAEC FERE QVVM GEMITVS TVRGENTIA LVMINA PROMANT BELLINI POTERAT FLERE IOANNIS OPVS.” Giles Robertson, Giovanni Bellini (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1968), 54–55. Robertson notes the similarity between this couplet and the work of Propertius. More recently the cartellino is discussed by Keith Christiansen, “Giovanni Bellini and the Practice of Devotional Painting,” in Giovanni Bellini and the Art of Devotion, ed. Ronda Kasl (Indianapolis: Indianapolis Museum of Art, 2004), 36.\n\n34\n\nChapter 1\n\nCompunction and Popular Devotion at the Santissima Annunziata in Florence\n\nThe cult and devotional context around the miracle-working image of the Annunciation at the Santissima Annunziata in Florence is an appropriate object of study for this introductory chapter since in the late sixteenth century a unique book, merging art theory and spiritual literature, was written about this image by the Florentine author Francesco Bocchi (Figure 6). In recent years, Bocchi has become one of the more studied writers of literature on art from the sixteenth century.46 A scholar and writer who lived primarily by educating the sons of noblemen, he also wrote many speeches, historical works and various treatises, amongst which are a group of texts on visual art. Bocchi’s reputation today rests largely upon these artistic writings and his guidebook to Florence, Le Bellezze della città di Fiorenza.47 A treatise in praise of Donatello’s sculpture of St. George at Orsanmichele in Florence has likewise been the subject of several studies, and a discourse in praise of Andrea del Sarto has been noted amongst his other writing on art.48 Despite this scholarly interest, his treatise on the miraculous painting of the Annunciation in S"
