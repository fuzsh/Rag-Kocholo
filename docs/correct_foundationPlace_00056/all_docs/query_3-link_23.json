I'd be happy to fold that proposal into this project if there is a commitment to have some effort toward specific industry focuses or task forces. My issue with health-related companies is probably the same for all industries -- too many articles are written like brochures rather than proper encyclopedic articles. Further, I think it's important to cover both the positive and negative aspects of companies. Would a health industry focus be welcome here? Thanks. Stevie is the man! Talk • Work\n\nStevie - I think task forces for specific industries are a great idea for attracting participants to this project, and would encourage their creation. I'll add a section to the main project page for listing related task forces and then please feel free to sign up for the main project and start a health industry task force. Please note this WikiProject is just starting so any other comments or suggestions for improvements are more than welcome!! Cheers! Richc80\n\nMiranda\n\nI was wondering whether the WP Companies team thought it would be worth starting a taskforce specifically focused on credit agencies and similar companies? My thought is that these articles need special attention for the following reasons:\n\nHighly noteworthy attracting much media and regulatory attention due to the nature of their businesses, especially due to data quality and privacy/big brother issues. (See for example ChoicePoint, Experian.)\n\nAre often started as POV articles biased against the companies\n\nSeem to be more often edited by the companies themselves than other industries. See for example ChoicePoint, Experian, Equifax and possibly TransUnion\n\nAre complex organisations whose articles could benefit from having a variety of editors working on them. For example see the problematic Florida voter section of ChoicePoint\n\nSeem yet to have a common article structure (contrast LexisNexis which is written about from a product perspective against TransUnion, which is almost at stub status despite its large size).\n\nAny thoughts? CheersSaganaki-\n\nI'm in let me know what you need / where to start. I've already started searching the 'Big Three'. --Patrick Fleischman\n\nI would like to propose a project, but I am not sure if I should propose it here on the Companies page or with the Wikiproject Council. Some advice would be greatly appreciated. Kpapadopoulos\n\nIf you are trying to see if others would be interested in joining your proposed project, my advice would be to propose it on the Wikiproject Council page first and then post a message on the talk page of related projects linking to that proposal and asking interested people to sign-up. Assuming that it is related to companies in some way, then one of those messages would be here. Alternatively if you are looking for feedback on whether your proposal will make a \"good\" project, feel free to tell us about it here and we can give you our thoughts. Either way, good luck! Richc80\n\nThanks for you help!Kpapadopoulos\n\nHow are articles about merged companies managed? A user keeps on deleting the content of the Web.com article since the company has merged with Website Pros on Oct 1st. All other examples I can think of in the moment keep their own - updated articles - like Macromedia or Ulead. I think there are plenty of reasons to keep the Web.com article. It was traded on NASDAQ as late as last week and they are still selling products over their website. Please advice. --Peter Eisenburger\n\nInteresting question, and I don't believe there is any specific policy on this. My personal view is that if a company was notable enough for an article before becoming defunct (either through merger or liquidation) then continuing to have an article for it is valid, and information from prior to a merger / liquidation certainly continues to be encyclopedic. We also have {{an infobox specifically for defunct companies}}. Have you tried talking wih the editor in question about why they insist on a redirect? I'd also recommend reading Wikipedia's article on conflict resolution. Cheers. Richc80\n\nYes, I had used the defunct template and also made some minor changes to the article. See my comment below.--Peter Eisenburger\n\nI tend to agree with Richc80. The companies you mention all have existing product lines, which is the primary focus of those pages. This page that was merged is different in that it was part of the companies history. That company (and its' history) is now part of another company's page, which already makes mention of the prior company. I appreciate the dialogue as this does help.--Obgydd\n\nI moved your comment to the right section. - I think you misinterpreted Rich's post. A merger can be no reason to delete an article altogether over night. There is much reason to keep the information for our readers as all the other examples show. And of course the history of a bought company is not part of the history of the buyer but stays in its own right. Wikipedia has lots of articles about history (things that are over). E.g. a country that has been incorporated by a bigger country once in time sure keeps its own article.\n\nPlease consider that a \"redirect\" in effect means a \"deletion\" that you made in a very unilateral way. However I am happy that you are open to dialogue. Let's give other readers the choice to read the text of Web.com too. For that purpose I will restore the article. Please don't delete again but take part in the discussion and hear what others say.--Peter Eisenburger\n\nI'll add this here, rather than start a new section, since it is to do with merged companies. Is there a consistent way to deal with the foundation dates of a company that is formed from two or more with separate dates of their own. I've seen the latest date put (when A & B became A-B) and the earliest (A alone). What is the preferred method of giving this info? Cheers, Lindsay\n\nLindsay, thanks for your post. I've brought this up over at the talk page for the Infobox Company template (see discussion here). My preference is that the foundation date should be the latest (when A&B became A-B). In my view there are a couple of benefits to that:\n\nConsistency - uses the date the current entity (A-B) was actually formed, rather than whichever date & history the company chooses to keep (could be A's date, B's date or some other date that the company \"traces its history to\")\n\nIf prior entities are notable enough for their own article then the dates between articles will \"flow\" correctly (e.g. A's date would be 1911, B's date would be 1934, A-B's date would be 1975). Having that could even let us do something like with a band's discography in the artist infobox, where previous & newer entities are displayed)\n\nInformation on the other dates could be noted under a Corporate History section. I've had a couple of other editors agree with this suggestion. Hope this helps! Richc80 (talk)\n\nAh, thank you. I knew that there must be a previous discussion of this matter somewhere out there, but a brief modicum of searching didn't bring me to it.\n\nI think your suggestion certainly makes sense, and answers my question admirably. Thanks again, Cheers, Lindsay\n\nReading your project page I see you recommend major companies with a billion dollar revenue and nearly two thousand employees for deletion because of lacking notability or importance. I deleted one template and wrote sth. on the talk page. I won't go in any further but you should explain your guidelines. And why not first ask for sources before giving them only 5 days? In the case of ABRY a simple Google search showed a lot of media coverage for this company.--Peter Eisenburger\n\nPeter, thanks for your message. To respond to your concerns, the articles that are posted on this talk page were not nominated for deletion by this project, nor are we making a \"sight unseen\" recommendation that they be deleted. We are asking users to post any company articles that they notice have been nominated so that our participants (as interested and hopefully knowledgeable editors) can review that nomination against our notability criteria and then provide an informed view. I would mention though that the Google search you provided does not demonstrate \"a lot of media coverage\", plus not all sources are considered reliable. A more relevant search would be of Google News, which produces far fewer results. 1 2 Cheers. Richc80\n\nSorry for misinterpreting your project, Rich. - In the case of ABRY I think even if you assess fewer sources as \"reliable\" as me there are hits for this company. However, what I was appealing for is to take care when deleting articles. The sheer size of this company is one argument in the first place.--Peter Eisenburger\n\nAgain I ask someone please look after what's going on with the Web.com article. See Talk:Web.com. I restored the article for the 3rd or 4th time now. The last edit contained many errors and was written in bad grammar also.--Peter Eisenburger\n\nFYI - I've opened a Peer Review on the article Dow Chemical Company, which is rated as a GA on the Companies WikiProject. Feel free to comment on the article on its Peer Review subpage, here. Thanks, Rjd0060 (talk)\n\nBlackwater Worldwide, an article under this WikiProject, is up for Peer Review to move to Featured Article status. Please help out and offer up reviews, advice, or edits to the article or review at:\n\nWikipedia:Peer review/Blackwater Worldwide/archive1\n\nThanks! Lawrence Cohen\n\nI'm pretty sure that Embarq falls into your project's scope, but its discussion page does not have a WikiProject Companies template. Is it true that general Wiki editors may place your template on articles or must an editor be a member of your project to use the template? GO-PCHS-NJROTC (talk)\n\n...must an editor be a member of your project to use the template - absolutely not! We welcome input from all editors, so be bold and add it! Thanks for your interest in the project! --Gimlei (talk to me)\n\nI second that - use {{WikiProject Companies| class= | importance= }} liberally and often. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nCorrect, and yes, Embarq does fall in the Companies scope. Basketball110\n\nIn the Resources section of the Main page, I have added a section containing a link to the subpages of the main WikiProject page. This is meant to eliminate the need for manually maintaining such a list and provides a ready reference for newly created subpages, regardless of whether they are discussed here or not. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nI have created a subpage for the collection of published lists of companies that might be useful in establishing notability. This was prompted by the deletion of C&H Distributors, which was listed 35th on the first list I have added to this page; a comment was made during the AfD that \"35 is not ranked very high\", which implies that perhaps 1st or 4th might have been garnered more support. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nWow. Hmmm. Notability is a vaperous apparition varying greatly depending on who is participating in the subject. Is Carver_Bancorp notable? How about C._K._Cooper_&_Company? --Pearrari (talk)\n\nnotice of thread placed on four editors' talk pages\n\nI have created {{Delsort WPCompanies}} (see #Deletion discussion template above), which can be affixed to ongoing xfD discussions in conjunction with listing those discussions here. I will not list this on the Main Wikiproject page until after consensus is reached about whether this template should be retained or destroyed and/or modified. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nWell, as for me, I have nothing against this template, but I can see only marginal benefit in its use in the afd discussions either. If you could enlighten me, I'd happily support. Otherwise, I am pretty much neutral in this respect. --Gimlei (talk to me)\n\nI've generally interpreted this type of addendum to AFD's as advertisement for the notification route and for the WikiProject in general, a different route to raising awareness of the WikiProject than placing banners on talk pages. Also, it provides closing admins with some information on whether or not a small number of responses in a discussion is due to lack or interest in the article's fate or lack of awareness of the article's nomination for deletion. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nI took a cue from Wikipedia:WikiProject Scouting which I implemented first in Wikipedia:WikiProject Anthroponymy and indicated who of the participants are admins in the Members listing. This information was gotten from quick consultation against Wikipedia:List of administrators (I wish there was a lookup tool implemented there). I did this without prior discussion, so please revert if you disagree and we can discuss here. Regards User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nLooks ok. If anyone think its elitist, then we should revert, but otherwise fine. Addhoc (talk)\n\nI didn't explain why I added this notation. It was primarily to let Project Participants know who among us can either restore deleted pages (either to main or user space) or peer into the history of deleted pages. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nRegarding the section Wikipedia:WikiProject Companies#Brand Names, I have made an expansion of the text to explicitely refer to record labels and book imprints. Examples are needed to back up the text, but I thought it good to add these because I don't think the general public looks at these with the same level of recognition \"that is a brand\" as they do with the consumer goods mentioned earlier in the text. Please feel free to remove the text and discuss it here, or leave it in place and discuss it here. Thanks. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nAgree this is a good idea on both counts. Examples would definitely be beneficial to ensure the distinction between label/imprint & actual companies/subsidiaries (such as the Big Four or Penguin Group) that should remain in project scope. Great work as always with improving the project! Richc80 (talk)\n\nMay I suggest that we state specifically on the Main page that parent of this WikiProject is Wikipedia:WikiProject Business and Economics? This parentage is already reflected in Category:WikiProject Business and Economics and at Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Directory/History and society#Business and economics. The reason for doing this is to reflect the hierarchical organization in the text of the Project Main page, as is done for many other Projects. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nMakes sense to me. --Pearrari (talk)\n\nYep, helpful clarification. Addhoc (talk)\n\nBanners & Templates section\n\nI have made significant revisions to the 'Banners & Templates' section of the Main Project page, which is now called simply 'Templates'. The revisions include altered wording of instructions including more background text and links; \"<pre></pre>\" formatting for template code (allowing double/triple click for quick use); and significant re-sectionization. The content is not changed in a major way, and I hope it is clearer and easier to use than before. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nRevision to opening inches\n\nI felt that there was a great deal of white space at the opening of the Main page, so I've made a number of revisions that remove much of that white space. I've also added a 'milestones' listing that draws directly from the quality/importance bot-maintained table; this follows from a similar list I created for WikiProject Anthroponymy. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nLooks nice. Addhoc (talk)\n\nI've started a discussion on the Infobox Company talk page regarding what the Foundation Date should be. I'd appreciate the thoughts & contributions of other WikiProject Companies participants on this subject. Thanks! Richc80 (talk)\n\ncontributed --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\n{{Portal companies}}\n\nThe template above has been deleted. Unfortunately, the person who has deleted it has also been removing it from articles without replacing it. See these two items:\n\nWikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2008 February 4#Portal template\n\nUser talk:RyanGerbil10#removing portal templates\n\n--User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nWorking replacement {{Portal|Companies|Factory.svg}} (see right margin):\n\nCompanies portal\n\n--User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nCan someone point me to the procedures for uploading copyrighted company logos to wikipedia? It seems like a low res image is uploaded. Do we take the image from the website and change it to a low res image somehow then upload it with the fair use justification? Pocopocopocopoco (talk)\n\nHave a look at WP:LOGO.--Addhoc (talk)\n\nI have noted this cross reference in Wikipedia:WikiProject Companies/Guidelines#Format/Content Guidelines. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nI've created a subpage to list inactive/infrequent participants and moved those struck out by Edibility to that page. I think this helps make the main page more readable without completely losing those users in case they ever come back to Wikipedia. If you have any concerns about this feel free to revert and discuss here. Cheers. Richc80 (talk)\n\nThank you. I have moved myself to this new page and left an explanatory line there. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nThere are many wikipedia searches that are not being appropriately redirected to companies, an excellent example is a search for \"twa\". A search for twa brings up an obscure african tribe. Please help me get this changed back to twa = Trans World Airlines. Thank you. Paco8191 (talk)\n\nNo, I think that Twa going to the tribe helps to counter the rampant systematic bias here. The vast majority of people who are looking for TWA will use 'TWA', all caps, in my opinion. Let's leave it as it is .. afterall, which is more important, a tribe or a multinational company - if the answer is not obvious, it is 'the tribe' (In my opinion). --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nLooking at the talk page for Twa, Paco8191 has withdrawn his move request after being made aware that Wikipeda search can distinguish between 'Twa' & 'TWA'. Sounds like that makes everyone happy :-). Cheers. Richc80 (talk)\n\nTime to archive this page? Any objections? --Edibility (talk)\n\nI think that moving the deletion items to a subpage would drop the page size by ~50%. (I'm to blame for much of that content) If archiving is to be done manually rather than robotically, is there a way that we could archive so that topics can be found later? --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nWhatever removes the inactive discussions and work lists works for me. This discussion page is just too long. Topics show up on the TOC of archived pages, so do what you can to shrink this page if you want. --Edibility (talk)\n\nMoving deletion-related items reduced the page size by about ¼. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nCan we still proceed with the archiving of old and inactive discussions? --Gimlei (talk to me)\n\nIs there anyone, member or not, interested in maintaining the Companies Portal? Looks like the \"Featured Article of the Week\" has not been changed since August, and in general the Portal could do with some TLC. Any takers? Cheers Richc80 (talk)\n\nIt would be good to establish what the use cases for the Portal are so that requirements for maintenance and content can be to-do-listed. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nSince the mission of this WikiProject is to get articles on companies up to GA or FA status, I thought I would post here asking for peer reviews on Elderly Instruments. I started this article from scratch and want to get it up to FA states. The peer review is here. In return for a substantive review, I will review or copyedit the article of your choice - just leave me a note on my talk page. Thanks! --Laser brain (talk)\n\nI have applied the Project Banner to this article's talk page with parameters 'class = B' and 'importance = mid'; I have not provided a rationale on the talk page for the class or importance assignment. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nJust to clarify: Is that your review of the article or is that an intermediate step of some kind? --Laser brain (talk)\n\nNeither - the article was not tagged as being associated with this WikiProject - that is now rectified. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nThat's a nice article! I left some comments on the talk page. --Edibility (talk)\n\nFYI, the article is now a Featured Article candidate. --Laser brain (talk)\n\nCongrats on getting this article to FA status! - Richc80 (talk)\n\nWhat do we do about franshises and trade names? I came across Civic Video, which is a trade name and a franchise, but not actually a company itself. The company is Civic Retailing. Any guidelines on this? --Edibility (talk)\n\nI would put franchises & trade names in the same category as book imprints & record labels, which as discussed above would put them out of scope for this project. So I say tag Civic Retailing if it has an article, but not Civic Video. Richc80 (talk)\n\nI'm afraid I don't understand that short discussion. Civic Video is a well-known DVD rental store by that name. It's not a legal company name, but it's an active and recognized trade name. The company does not use its legal name as a trade name, and it franchises its trade name. Its trade is conducted via its trade name. I don't think the answer here is \"this is not within the scope of this project\". Companies create, claim, and control trade names. And those trade names are often what's seen by the general public (rather than an official company name).\n\nI'll ask again: How do we deal with this in Wikipedia? --Edibility (talk)\n\nSorry for any misunderstanding, but now I'm not sure what you are asking. What do you mean by \"deal with this\" if we are not talking about whether they are within project scope? Richc80 (talk)\n\nHow do we deal with companies with the same name? [1] --Edibility (talk)\n\nContributed my thoughts on the naming conventions talk page. Richc80 (talk)\n\nI think we should change the \"Fortune 500\" recommendation in rating the importance of a company to a \"Fortune Global 500\" recommendation. This is because wikipedia usually wants a global worldview in the article and also because the importance ratings directly correlate to global importance at the top two levels.--Finalnight (talk)\n\nCurrently, we have Wikipedia:Companies, corporations and economic information, a part of Manual of Style. I'd like to embark on a difficult and controversial mission of developing somewhat more detailed and thorough guidelines, basing of course on what is already in place. I would not want/dare to do that myself, but rather team up with some people, and collaborate to produce something, in my view, important and valuable to the community. Is anyone up for it? --Gimlei (talk to me)\n\nI'm in. Note that a start has also been made to put together something more comprehensive within the WikiProject, so maybe we could build upon that to start with. Cheers - Richc80 (talk)\n\nI noticed someone is trying to create a state-owned companies taskforce. I was under the impression that we do not include state-owned companies. The reason being how do you distinguish between a state-owned company, a government institution, a nationalized company, or some weird mix (IE USPS or Amtrak)? Seems like this would only cause further complications and interfere with other WP projects. If we do include, I recommend that we create a special importance rating or limit it to \"high\" as I have seen possible nationalism from people adding a lot of their home country's companies as \"top\" or \"high\" importance when they are clearly not. I am also curious because I have been informally working on quality and importance ratings of the Fortune 500 and Global 500 since I started on Wikipedia and wouldn't mind further guidance--Finalnight (talk)\n\nYou raise a really good question here that I hadn't thought of before. Taking a look at a couple of articles it seemed to be clear to me whether or not they should be included (using the examples you gave, USPS is a government agency so is out of scope, Amtrack is setup as a company with stock owned by the government so is in scope) so my gut feeling is to continue including state-owned companies, but I'm willing to be swayed. If we do include those in scope then I think the taskforce becomes important in making those determinations, I even think we should look at ways indicate within the project banner (as I've seen happen in other Wikiprojects) that the taskforce is involved. Thanks for all of the work you are doing for this project! Richc80 (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nthere are currently 66 articles in the scope of this project which are tagged with notability concerns. I have listed them here. (Note: this listing is based on a database snapshot of 12 March 2008 and may be slightly outdated.)\n\nI would encourage members of this project to have a look at these articles, and see whether independent sources can be added, whether the articles can be merged into an article of larger scope, or possibly be deleted. Any help in cleaning up this backlog is appreciated. For further information, see Wikipedia:WikiProject Notability.\n\nIf you have any questions, please leave a message on the Notability project page or on my personal talk page. (I'm not watching this page however.) Thanks! --B. Wolterding (talk)\n\nThank you for putting forth the effort to do this work to assist us in increasing Wikipedia article quality. I will endeavor to take a look at several over the next couple of days. --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nAs an aside - the optional parameter 'companies' may be useful to encourage use of; i.e. {{notability|companies}} (see Template:Notability/doc). --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nI could use a little guidance (feel free to point where this has been discussed before)... Bringing SS Christopher Columbus to FA status, I and others de-redlinked every ref in it, including Samuel F. Hodge & Company which was created as a stub. This area is not really my wife's interest so I plan to give it a bit more. The company is notable enough in its field, having put the first triple expansion engine in service in the Great Lakes, in SS Roumania, but overall info is scant, so it's not likely to ever be much more than a start or at most B class article... Many 19th century companies were founded by individuals. This one outlasted the founder, with one of the sons taking over, but I don't think by much. Is it appropriate to put the bio of Samuel F. Hodge into this article? It seems he's notable for little else, and his story and the company story are intertwined. What do others do in this area? Thanks. ++Lar: t/c\n\nThanks for your post. To my knowledge this question has not been raised before, either within the project or the wider world of Wikipedia, so there is no consensus or example to follow. My feeling is, based upon the information you provided, that it would make sense to include information about the founder in the company's article. - Richc80 (talk)\n\nI have had a long, long dispute on Singapore Airlines with an editor over whether Temasek Holdings is the parent company. I have a long long long long list of sources stating this is the case, and have even quote the Singapore Airlines annual report, where it states Singapore Airlines Limited (\"the Company\") is a limited liability company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore which is also the place of domicile. The Company is a subsidiary company of Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, incorporated in the Republic of Singapore., yet the other editor ignores this, says it does not mean that Temasek is the parent company, removes info, and then claims that Temasek is the parent of the \"Singapore Airlines Group of Companies\" (which we know is a different animal altogether). I have started the unknownth discussion on the talk page, and hope other project members can weigh in with their input. --Россавиа Диалог\n\nI have created INTO University Partnerships. Can your good eyes see any improvements needed? Thanks! BusinessAsUnusual (talk)\n\nConflict of interest is obvious, and notability needs to be asserted. My impression after a very brief look is that it is just on the borderline so far. --Gimlei (talk to me)\n\nWhat conflict of interest? I don't and have never worked for them, if that is what you mean. Notability? I cite articles from British trade, regional, and national newspapers. The company says it has £400 million in venture capital behind it, and it is changing the way universities work and see themselves. If that isn't worthy of a Wikipedia article then I don't know what is. I was hoping for constructive suggestions of better categories to put it in, wikilinks to make, info I may have overlooked, etc. BusinessAsUnusual (talk)\n\nMost of this article has been deleted as a probable copyright violation (the material was added in January 2006 and removed a couple of days ago). I'm not certain if it is within the scope of this project or not, but it could do with some attention and watchlisting. Thryduulf (talk)\n\nWikipedia:Companies, corporations and economic information was marked with \"Template:Style-guide\", but there were only a few pages that used that template and it's been deprecated. I'm wondering whether to include this page in the \"Wikipedia style guidelines\" category. It's shorter than other pages in that cat, and it's seen very little traffic over the last couple of years. Does anyone from this wikiproject want to go have a look and decide if it's a useful style guideline? - Dan Dank55 (talk)(mistakes)\n\nI agree in it's current form it is not much of a style guideline, but that there is some useful information there. I think it makes sense for this project to work on creating a more comprehensive guideline (a rough draft has been started) for inclusion in the category. A couple of project members have expressed an interest in participating, but we've yet to make any substantial progress. Thanks for bringing this to our attention! - Richc80 (talk)\n\nOkay, thanks Richc80. I'm going to un-watchlist; please either let me know or post a message at WT:MoS when you guys have something that you'd like included in the style guidelines category. There isn't any official process to be included, but we like to keep track. - Dan Dank55 (talk)(mistakes)\n\nI've created a draft set of guidelines for the various lists of companies by country. The quality of these lists varies greatly, and several have been subject to AFD discussions in the past. I think it would be good if this project could help facilitate improvements to these lists to ensure a minimum quality standard and consistency across all. Please review the draft guidelines, make edits as you see fit and discuss any major changes on the talk page. Thanks for your help! Richc80 (talk)\n\nMyself and a couple of new editors just created an article about our favorite jigsaw puzzle company Stave Puzzles, we added it to this project and as this was my first article written about a company I would like to get an assessment of its quality and importance from an editor more familiar with company articles. Thanks in advance. --Captain-tucker (talk)\n\nWas this acted on by anyone? --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nNo action so far, Thanks.--Captain-tucker (talk)\n\nI thought that the WikiProject Companies page could use a makeover to make it more user friendly and readable. To that end, I've put together a mock-up for a new page here. I'd appreciate any feedback, either by replying here or making constructive edits directly to the mock-up. Thanks for contributing to the success of this project and Wikipedia! - Richc80 (talk)\n\nI have no objection to a radical change such as that proposed. Sometimes a shift like this can breath new life into a project. I think that providing a far more succinct entry page than used by most WikiProjects is beneficial.\n\nWhat do you think about using the brevity of the top-page to our benefit by emphasizing some aspect of the WikiProject on an occasional basis? I am thinking about a section box entitled \"Quarterly Message for Q{#} 200{#}\" with subtext \"a message from the WikiProject to provide focus\". This could be anything from a four-word highlighted phrase like \"Companies are people too\" followed by a paragraph on the application of BLP guidelines to companies (just a thought) to something like \"Goal for the quarter: zero unassessed articles\". No statement would be put up without ample (quorum) discussion.\n\nThis quarterly statement would be something that could encourage non-participants to act on the Project's behalf and, perhaps, draw at least one new member in per quarter (I don't know what the current addition rate is .. interesting thing to look into, though, across WikiProjects in general).\n\n--User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nI think it's a great idea, thanks as always for the feedback! I've added your suggestion, along with my thought on the first quarterly message (it would be good to get all company articles tagged for the project). I'll keep working on the formatting and getting the remaining pages setup, and then unless there are any major objections will launch the new page before the end of this weekend! - Richc80 (talk)\n\nI think the proposed layout would catch my attention more. --Hroðulf (or Hrothulf) (Talk)\n\nRevamp of portal?\n\nIn a similar vein to the above, I've been mocking up some ideas for a new-look portal here. Any feedback would be appreciated at Portal talk:Companies. Best, Gr1st (talk)\n\nI love it! I am not so keen on having a list of categories in a portal, but that is just a personal preference. --Hroðulf (or Hrothulf) (Talk)\n\nOK, bumped a better-looking category tree off to the index subpage. Anyone have any more thoughts before I deploy this for real? Gr1st (talk)\n\nI do: I love it even more. But please comment out the link to Portal:Co-operatives (yes I know it was me that asked for it to be added, but that portal seems to be broken right now.) --Hroðulf (or Hrothulf) (Talk)\n\nThere is one small problem to tidy up before I deploy this: the two-column category tree apparently only works in Firefox - it just sits in one column in IE and Safari, meaning a huge amount of white space on the right. Any suggestions for a better way to lay this out (or a fix for the column problem)? Gr1st (talk)\n\nI've rolled out the new-look portal. Would appreciate the highlighting of any errors/possible improvements. Cheers, Gr1st (talk)\n\nLooks great! I couldn't find any errors. --Patrick (talk)\n\nEarlier I tried to clean up the article on Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS Corporation and in 2007 the second-best paid S&P 500 executive (see salary reference I added to his infobox).

Since it is optional for individual projects to use, I think we need to decide if we will be adopting this or not. Thanks.--Finalnight (talk)\n\nThe community needs to decide the definitions (and examples) of B and C class. Won't that take months? When they emerge, we can decide if people here want to do more assessments, or write articles. --Hroðulf (or Hrothulf) (Talk)\n\nI think of doing an assessment and writing an article as not mutually exclusive activities. Nonetheless, the key question here is how would the implementation of an additional class (C-class) benefit the WikiProject's contributing to the Encyclopedia. This class axis tends to deal with article structure and \"completeness\", so I agree that the consensus as to how to define this class might take a long time. I think that the low-med-high axis of importance is more relevant to prioritization of editing activity by a WikiProject as this is a measure of how important a particular topic is to the subject area as a whole. The A-B-C class axis is more of a milestone bar and I feel that such \"structural\" classes should emerge from natural editing activity than be striven for -- meaning that they should be assigned by an \"outside committee\" (relative to the WikiProject) or by bot (based on a clear rule-set). In those external-measure cases, it doesn't matter if C-class is added or not. The 'Good Article' and 'Featured Article' classes are where the two axes converge and are considered together (at least for FA). --User:Ceyockey (talk to me)\n\nLooks like it was implemented faster than we thought, I have added the proper code to the banner.--Finalnight (talk)\n\nCurrently, 959 of the articles assigned to this project, or 33.2%, are flagged for cleanup of some sort. (Data as of 18 June 2008.) Are you interested in finding out more? I am offering to generate cleanup to-do lists on a project or work group level. See User:B. Wolterding/Cleanup listings for details. Subsribing is easy - just add a template to your project page. If you want to respond to this canned message, please do so at my user talk page. --B. Wolterding (talk)\n\nAs you may have heard, we at the Wikipedia 1.0 Editorial Team recently made some changes to the assessment scale, including the addition of a new level. The new description is available at WP:ASSESS.\n\nThe new C-Class represents articles that are beyond the basic Start-Class, but which need additional references or cleanup to meet the standards for B-Class.\n\nThe criteria for B-Class have been tightened up with the addition of a rubric, and are now more in line with the stricter standards already used at some projects.\n\nA-Class article reviews will now need more than one person, as described here.\n\nEach WikiProject should already have a new C-Class category at Category:C-Class_articles. If your project elects not to use the new level, you can simply delete your WikiProject's C-Class category and clarify any amendments on your project's assessment/discussion pages. The bot is already finding and listing C-Class articles.\n\nPlease leave a message with us if you have any queries regarding the introduction of the revised scheme. This scheme should allow the team to start producing offline selections for your project and the wider community within the next year. Thanks for using the Wikipedia 1.0 scheme! For the 1.0 Editorial Team, §hepBot (Disable)\n\nIs there a section dealing with UK (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Island) companies, or do they just come under the companies project, as most of them will be insignificant to Americans and others, but have some local significance, and bringing articles to peoples attention can help to get them expanded as a lot of niche groups have created articles but only categorised then in there niche area and not as companies. But bringing article to greater viewing prominence can then lead to calls for AfD. rather than them receiving constructive editing and expansion to get them to a reasonable quality. Some articles could be a Bio or a Company article, but appear to be nither or.\n\nI'm unsure if to join WP Companies as already involved in other UK Area projects, which obliviously cover the companies in the local areas in there scope of work, ut some UK Areas do not have projects looking at them. - BulldozerD11 (talk)\n\nI think the phenomenon you describe is called a walled garden. But attracting readers is never harmful. I created an article for a small UK company last week, Northern Co-operative Society. Someone tagged it for notability within seconds, but I was soon able to improve the referencing, and hopefully it is going to stay.\n\nDon't feel you have to join a WikiProject to work on a topic (if that is your concern.) If you don't, it can still be helpful to put a project's page on your watchlist, to keep an eye on what editors that share your interest are talking about.\n\n--Hroðulf (or Hrothulf) (Talk)\n\nFYI, Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robotshop. Banjeboi\n\nAre there any parameters for template content/purpose? I'm having an issue with the existence of {{Intrawest resorts}} and the response I'm getting from the template's creator (also the author of articles on resorts owned by that company) is that \"people want to read more about places owned by Intrawest\", rather than \"people who want to read about other ski resorts\". I ran into the same thing with {{Ski resorts in the Canadian Rockies}}, which had only resorts owned by Resorts of the Canadian Rockies Inc. (formerly titled Resorts of the Canadian Rockies, which is a clever corporate name in this search-engine happy age, no? I changed the Cdn Rockies template around to actually be about resorts in the Rockies (and not ones outside owned by Resorts of the Canadian Rockies, Inc.). This Intrawest one, aside from the recognizable spin-doctor responses of the author, is also of issue because of the context of the article I found it on Whistler Blackcomb, which is the site of the alpine and sliding events for the 2010 Olympics; my concerns about that are laid out on Template talk:Intrawest resorts. I've posted this already on WikiProject Canada but I came here wondering if there are corporate-usage guidelines. I think the template is spam/promotion and wonder how many also might be seen as such; {{Weyerhaeuser}} is an entirely different type of company template; but my discussion companion trotted out Disney resorts and Six Flags and (mistakenly} cited {{Canada's railway hotels}} as if it were CP Hotels. Disney and Six Flags and chateau gothic hotel buildings are definitely of thematic interest; but are resorts, simply because they have the same owner(s)?Skookum1 (talk)\n\nI saw the WP:BFAQ notice in the intro to the project page; should I post it there or leave it to someone more polite?Skookum1 (talk)\n\nRE company templates (nav boxes) For an example UK articles have several single company ones but are often used with others of a more general nature so navigation of both general subject and the corporate structure is possible (due to regional branding & take overs companies operate with various names). See First_Group, were there is a company template for the large no of subsidiaries, and regional templates to navigate the competition / other operators to balance. I would say create a simple one listing all Canadian resort operates (with wiki pages) or all Resort Areas in Canada, theme. The rockies resort article has little content any way in its present form (detailed history not examined) to be considered corporate hype. My view is that template boxes form a neat way of offering navigation without the WP:Lists problem or righting a great load of rubbish to put it in prose thats just padding out whats neater as a list. (just my 2 cents for what its worth). They also allow the same info to be consistent through multiple articles, and update all articles with one edit. - BulldozerD11 (talk)\n\nThe Rockies template had resorts owned by the company in question, and did not list other Rockies resorts (i.e. Powder King, among others( but it did list corporate-owned ones in the Selkirks and Monashees. But only theirs, not all.....Skookum1 (talk)\n\nSkookum1, have you actually read and looked at what it says above, as I'm talking about have one company template and A more general one in an article to cross link \" ALL Resorts in the Rockies, the world\" or what ever criteria editors feel is valid groupings. you opinion that its corporate spam is unjustified. If you feel a general template navbox linking Resorts in general serves a purpose make one. But as its more general would sit below the current one. IMO. - BulldozerD11 (talk)\n\nIt's common to have company navboxes list assets and subsidiaries, so I don't have a problem with the wholly (or partly) owned resorts such as Panorama Mountain Village being there. As a compromise move to end the stand-off at Template talk:Intrawest resorts, however, I'd suggest that entries such as the \"Club Intrawest\" group (which just link to the nearest city or town rather than an actual property) be removed as they don't serve the purpose for which navboxes are intended. Gr1st (talk)\n\nI'm not sure there's a standoff, per se. There's one editor, going to any page he can find on Wikipedia, calling me a \"spin doctor,\" spammer, and \"kibitzer.\" Then, you have him saying he's going to make other navboxes, simply so he can place them \"above\" Template:Intrawest resorts on the Intrawest articles. Hello, WP:POINT, how are you? If you'd like to remove the Club Intrawest links, that's fine. But I think doing it to resolve a \"standoff\" and appease an editor who has deemed me an agent of the \"corporatization of Wikipedia\" and the template I created \"near-spam\" is a bit of a slap in the face. user:j (aka justen)\n\nI didn't call you' a spin doctor I said your responses were spin doctor responses because they sound exactly like them. An I said your template has the effect of spam, I didn't say you were a spammer. But adjusting what people said to waht you'p prefer had been said.....well, I'm not going to lecture about ducks. The point above theat hte Club Intrawest links don't even go to resorts, but to towns....this is also what I found on another resort company page - a list of links that claimed to be for the resorts, but were actually only for the towns where they were located (Great Wolf Lodge or Grey Wolf Lodge or some such). To me a corporate tempalte should have stuff like the Weyerhaeuser template, plus real subsidiaries. I think the use of tempaltes such as the one I've encountered here is dangerously close to spam, and taht care must be taken in their design and in their use. Pretending that this is the best template to put on Whistler Blackcomb because \"people may want to read about Intrawset\" rather than other ski resorts is silly; or sad, if you actually believe that's why people read ski resort pages. I'll go ahead and make the otehr template, and I'm expecting to see changes on this one that make an effort to not seem like spam. BTW spin doctors always give personal umbrage that they're not when their activities are pointed out; I'm not saying you're a spin doctor, but I am saying you're behaving like one.Skookum1 (talk)\n\nMis-citing links is also a trait of.....in this case pointing to the Canada's railway hotels tempalte as if it were CPH's (thet comparison is more to a general ski resorts tempalte, really) and in the tempalte itself making sure people knew about Club Intrawest, even though there were no articles on those resorts (presumably because they're not notable enough to warrant them).Skookum1 (talk)\n\nPlease see WP:NPA. You can't say \"spin doctors always give personal umbrage that they're not\" and then say you're not attacking an individual editor. You are. Stop. user:j (aka justen)\n\nSkookum1, you need to start assuming good faith in questioning j's motives - calling him a \"kibitzer\", etc. isn't constructive. As to my comments above - in hindsight, I could probably have worded them better. Here's what I was trying to say - as the Club Intrawest links, for example, just link to cities and towns rather than a relevant article, they're really of no practical use in what is a navigational template. I don't agree that the navbox is spam (or near-spam, a template which links the various assets of a company is useful), but I do think it should slimmed down to contain only links to properties which Intrawest owns. Gr1st (talk)\n\nDone. user:j (aka justen)\n\nOK, what's left is a collection of links to the notable assets of a notable company - any further accusations of spam will be misplaced in my opinion. Let's hope we can all leave it at that.

If you could leave your comments somewhere on the talk page, that'd be great. :) Intothewoods29 (talk)\n\nFor those articles where the stock symbol (i.e. NYSE: T) is in the infobox, I want to remove it from the first sentence of the article. This is to reduce clutter. Any objections? --Apoc2400 (talk)\n\nI don't think it does make the article look particularly cluttered myself, and there's nothing in the Manual of Style which discourages this as far as I know. There are featured articles (such as El Al) which have the ticker in the lead. If you want to remove the symbol from a particular article, go ahead, but I'm not sure that going round the hundreds and hundreds of articles that have this is really necessary. Gr1st (talk)\n\nWhat if someone just copies the article to a word processor to print but doesn't copy the infobox. If I had to choose between the infobox and next-to-the-comapny's-name-in-brackets, I'd go with the latter. It would allow us to have a more generic infobox across listed and unlisted companies. But it's not a huge deal and if you feel strongly enough, take Gr1st's advice! Zain Ebrahim (talk)\n\nI don't see a problem with the ticker symbol appearing in both places, but I agree with Zain Ebrahim; it might be better to pull them from the infobox than the lead section. —/Mendaliv/2¢/Δ's/\n\nWe may be used to skip past the ticker symbols but new readers might be confused by it. I think it's better to keep the introduction as readable as possible. If somebody copies the article without the infobox, well then he will miss out on all the quick facts. I know business websites often have a linked ticker symbol after all company names, but that is mostly to drive traffic to their affiliated stock trading sites I think.\n\nI'm not going to systematically change all company articles. Just a few so we have a discussion about it and develop a consensus.\n\nWe are also discussing the same thing right now at Talk:Sun Microsystems --Apoc2400 (talk)\n\nI think we already have a consensus: you have three editors who think the symbol should stay in the intro. sentence, and add me as a fourth one. Please to not do any removals that are contrary to this consensus. Thanks! UnitedStatesian (talk)\n\nSo, can I hear some arguments for having stock tickers right after the name in the intro? They are external links with I think make them especially inappropriate as the first thing in the article. --Apoc2400 (talk)\n\nWhile I think the burden rests firmly on the editor proposing to change consensus (i.e. you), I'll humor you and give you one: I think the main reason is to have a consistent style between the public company articles that don't have the infobox (the vast majority) and those that do have the infobox. I do not think these external links are problematic; in every case they go to an extrememly reliable site (the exchange); surely you are not arguing that their use is linkspam? UnitedStatesian (talk)\n\nI don't think there is any such \"burden of proof\" rule here, and I have provided several reasons. Still, since it seems the tickers don't bother others much I will drop this for now. --Apoc2400 (talk)\n\nI think the inline ticker links should be dropped from articles that have infoboxes, as being excessive linking. --Hroðulf (or Hrothulf) (Talk)\n\nI have opened a discussion at Wikipedia talk:Notability (organizations and companies)#Public_Companies around my opinion that every publicly traded company in any stock exchange of the world, with a market capitalization of at least $100 million or currency equivalent, deserves at least a stub.

BMW Motorrad, which manufacturers and sells motorcycles, has its own websites and its own general director. There was formerly a single BMW motorcycles article on Wikipedia that was very long, covering both past and current production of BMW motorcycles since 1923. Some time last year the article was split into two: BMW Motorrad and History of BMW motorcycles, with the former concentrating on the company itself. Does a division of a company merit an article or should the two articles be merged back into one general article about BMW motorcycles again? I personally favour two articles, but an editor has commented on the talk page today that it isn't needed so I thought I would ask here. --TimTay (talk)\n\nHi TimTay, great question. My thought is that a division of a company, like a subsidiary, can have it's own article so long as that division by itself meets the notability criteria for companies. in short, this means that the division has received \"significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources\". Note that for this purpose there is an important distinction between coverage of a product produced by the company (which is typically considered trivial coverage of the company) and coverage of the company itself. My personal view is that having the separate article makes sense (not that this could prevent its existence being challenged of course!), although I would suggest\n\n1) Adding a source for the history information that meets the notability criteria for companies\n\n2) Adding more information about how this division became prominent enough to warrant its own website and general director (during a company re-org perhaps?)\n\nHope this helps! Richc80 (talk)\n\nGreat help, thanks. I will see if any information can be found about the division itself as the BMW Motorrad article does seem to be more about the products rather than the division, in which case it should be about BMW motorcycles (the product) rather than BMW Motorrad (the division of BMW). If I cannot then maybe it would make sense to merge the articles back. Opinions from others on this would be very welcome. --TimTay (talk)\n\nThe \"Division\" has no start date, no legal definition, no history. Maybe you or someone else can create it. The \"Division\" seems to be a marketing ploy based on the German for \"BMW Motorcycles\". It seems to appear in the 1990's as a marketing ploy with no legal basis. For the article to exist a legal basis will be required. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 124.170.116.112 (talk)\n\nJust curious, under what basis do you make the assertion that \"for the article to exist a legal basis will be required\"? I do not see anything in WP:CORP which indicates that. Thanks! Richc80 (talk)\n\nAfter some consideration, and the excellent advice given here, I have changed the focus of the article slightly. BMW Motorrad's position as a business unit with the Corporate and Brand Development division means that it is probably best represented as a brand rather than a distinct company - even though it has a separate General Director. This principle is already established on Wikipedia with another BMW brand - Mini (BMW) so I feel this is the right way forward with the article. Hopefully others will concur. --TimTay (talk)\n\nI thought this WikiProject might be interested. Ping me with any specific queries or leave them on the page linked to above. Thanks! - Jarry1250 (t, c)\n\nShop Direct Group is in the news having just purchased Woolworths (UK). It is the UK's largest retail company, but its entry on Wikipedia is in need of a little TLC. Thought I'd give you guys a nudge. --Jza84 | Talk\n\nWould it not be a good idea to have a |needs-infobox= field added to the project template? __meco (talk)\n\nDoes this provide us with a way to identify and therefore address all company articles without an infobox?

Which, if either, belongs? (My personal belief is that neither really does, since WikiProject Trains is de facto a subproject of both, but I'd like to hear what you think.) --NE2\n\nIf nobody responds, I will remove business and companies tags from railroad article talk pages. --NE2\n\nPlease leave it on companies (but not other rail articles.) --Hroðulf (or Hrothulf) (Talk)\n\nWhy? Does anyone here do anything about rail company articles (example: Wichita, Tillman and Jackson Railway)? --NE2\n\nHave WikiProject Texas or WikiProject Oklahoma contributed to the example article you provided either? I see the main goal of tagging articles by Wikiprojects as providing editors interested in an article with a place to go to ask questions and understand how other articles in that category are typically put together. NE2 - I do appreciate what you are saying, but I'm concerned that I see no evidence of a link between WikiProject Trains and this project on the Trains site. Without that link we may end up going off in different directions on how these articles are put together, which goes against what I consider to be our goal of creating consistency among all Company articles, regardless of which industry they are in. Thanks for checking in with us on this! - Richc80 (talk)\n\nNot sure what you're asking, but I'm a WP Trains member and I rewrote that article. What consistency does WP Companies wish to bring to the article? --NE2\n\nYou had posed the question about whether any project participants do anything about rail company articles, and cited an example. I was just pointing out that, to me, the \"worthiness\" of tagging an article (any, not just the example provided) within scope of a Wikiproject should not solely be judged by contributions. My main concern is that articles on railroad companies appear, from my quick glance, to be from the \"rail\" perspective and not a \"corporation\" perspective. For example, there is the Infobox template for railroads which provides information specific to railroads but excludes a lot of the corporate information that still applies to these organizations and is found in the Infobox Company template (financial information, # of employees, locations, parent, subsidiaries, founder etc.). Given this my thought is that we should work more closely together to cover railroad articles from all angles. Thanks again. - Richc80 (talk)\n\nSo you're saying there should be two infoboxes? Sorry, but no. If you feel strongly about this, I suggest you work with WP Trains to get all that in {{infobox rail}}. --NE2\n\nI apologise for not being clearer in my previous post (was being rushed out of a hotel!). I agree there should only be one infobox and am happy to work with WP Trains on that. My point is that both projects (WP Trains & WP Companies) should work together going forward on items such as this to ensure that we are in sync. Finally, to answer your original question I believe that the WikiProject Companies tag does belong on railroad articles. Thanks again for bringing up this discussion! - Richc80 (talk)\n\n[undent]I was here about the item below, but just to note that railway companies often have wide-ranging subsidiaries far beyond their homebase rail operations; Canadian Pacific being may be the grand-daddy of them all; Cominco (Columbia Mining & Smelting) is one such subsidiary, Marathon Realty yet another. Also in the case of the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, despite its name by the 1930s/1940s it had become primarily an electric utility, and was as \"BC Electric\" (as it was known for short, or BCE) the main founding componenet of BC Hydro.Skookum1 (talk)\n\nPlease see Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mining#Granby_Consolidated_Mining_.26_Smelting_Company_etc..Skookum1 (talk)\n\nHi!

Gr1st (talk)\n\nWell, since the 2006 figures changed in the 2007 report, and the 2007 figures changed in the 2008 report, it's likely that the 2008 figures will change in the 2009 report.

Editors are invited to comment on the proposed change at this location. Xandar\n\nThe above \"notification\" is a grossly biased misrepresentation of the changes under discussion. The old version of the naming conventions policy tried to lay down binding rules; we don't work that way, so it was necessary also to make explicit exceptions. The new version articulates principles, and allows for consensus to establish how they should be applied. Thus there is no longer any need for exceptions. In fact, making exceptions is nonsense, since there are no rules to make exceptions to. These changes are good for specific conventions. Xandar is trying to induce moral panic in those who stand to gain the most from this. Xandar is only opposed to the new version because he thinks the wording, not the general thrust, weakens his position in a dispute unrelated to this RfC. Don't be fooled. Hesperian\n\nNo. Don't be fooled. The proposed wording change is shown at the RFC linked in my post above. The removal of the \"exceptions\" phrase is a very significant change. The policy never stated that it consisted of \"rules\" before, and it still doesn't. However it remains policy. Simply stating a personal view that titling a section \"principles\" changes the status of the policy page, is one not even accepted by many editors on Hesperians side. There is already an attempt to use the principle of no exceptions to the \"use common name\" policy to radically change the Naming conflict page, and one of the proposers of this change has indicated that the guidance on flora is also targetted. The change is in my view an attempt to impose a rigid, top-down policy on naming which ignores what wikipedia editors on the ground find most useful.

I am new to the Wikipedia editing process and I recognize that there exists an inherent COI with me making any edits to the page about the company I work for. If I have made any procedural errors I apologize in advance and ask that someone direct to the proper venue for this complaint. In an effort to approach this in an honest and upfront manner, I have not made any edits to the page. I recently came across the Wikipedia entry on APP and I believe it meets the Wikipedia description of an “Attack page.” I recommend that the article be reduced to a neutral “stub” immediately and a more appropriate, neutral and encyclopedic article be created over time and added. I would like to submit some suggested material for consideration in the article to the WikiProject Companies and allow for it to be reviewed and edited by neutral editors with no COI. I believe that a simple reading of the article will show that it is clearly meant to disparage the company it is about. I recognize that there is a high level of controversy regarding APP and certain issues, including the environment and financial issues. I respect the rights of any and all to express their opinions on these subjects freely, but as I understand it, Wikipedia is to be a source of neutral and encyclopedic information and not a soapbox for the views of individuals or organizations. An article on APP should certainly include mention of the controversy and the issues, but in a more balanced and accurate way. Additionally, a more encyclopedic article might include more information on the history of the company and the area in which it operates. I would also, like to make clear my specific concerns with the article, the following are quotes from the article and my specific concern with them and a suggested neutral change:\n\n• “their record of consistent breaches of environmental laws and agreements has lead many companies to terminate contracts with them[2].” – Even in the article quoted “consistent breaches of environmental laws and agreements” is not mentioned. The article says, “large paper sellers in the U.S., Europe and Asia, including Office Depot Inc., stopped buying from APP in recent years because of alleged environmental misdeeds.” The entry should use the wording from the quote which would be an acceptably neutral phrasing, “alleged environmental misdeeds.” In fact, APP does not have a record of consistent breaches of environmental laws and agreements.\n\n• “has been convicted of being involved in Illegal Logging in Cambodia, Yunnan province in China, and in Indonesia, and has breached agreements with three major environmental organizations.” – First, there is no citation for this sentence and claim (though similar claims later in the entry quote sources). Second, APP has never been convicted of Illegal Logging anywhere. There have been allegations and even investigations into Illegal Logging, but never has the company been convicted of Illegal Logging. I believe that stating that APP has been convicted of such a crime could be considered libel. Finally, none of the articles quoted in the entry claim that APP has ever been convicted of Illegal Logging, they discuss investigations or allegations of Illegal Logging, but none say that these allegations or investigations have resulted in any kind of conviction. An appropriate phrasing would be to say that “APP has been investigated for Illegal Logging,” or “there have been allegations of Illegal Logging by APP.”\n\n• “The company is also well known for defaulting on debt repayments in 2001, leading to a collapse in confidence of South Asian assets.” – The company is well known for defaulting on debt repayments in 2001. However, it is difficult to make the claim that this lead “to a collapse in confidence of South Asian assets.” Again, the source quoted to back this claim does not say or imply this. I would recommend removing or at the least attributing the claim that the default lead to such a collapse in confidence.\n\n• In a broader context the “Environmental Issues and Illegal Logging” section presents the views and opinions of environmental NGOs and groups with a long record and history of attacking APP without contextualizing it, or presenting other views on the subject. The entry seems to present these views as fact and uses Wikipedia as an outlet to promote these opinions. A more balanced article would note the controversy and contextualize it appropriately, possibly presenting the APP view on the subject.\n\nI have other more specific complaints with language and tone, but prefer to limit this initial post on the topic to the major issues. I believe a neutral party would agree that this article meets the “Attack page” requirements as described by Wikipedia and should be reduced to a neutral stub while an appropriate, encyclopedic article is developed. I am posting this on the entry’s “Discussion” page and the WikiProject Business “Talk” page. I have also alerted the editor who added this information to the entry to alert him/her of my concerns. If more experienced Wikipedia editors and users believe there is another, more appropriate venue or method for this discussion or I have in any way breached standard procedure please let me know. As mentioned earlier, I am new to this aspect of Wikipedia and would appreciate any guidance. My goal in this is not to use Wikipedia as venue for promotion but simply to ensure that a balanced, neutral and high quality encyclopedia article is created for APP.\n\nDewi bramono (talk)\n\nTekserve at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tekserve \"...largest independent Apple retailer in the U.S....\" Needs sources badly.
