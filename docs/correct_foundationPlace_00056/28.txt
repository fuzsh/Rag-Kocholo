CORPORATE WHISPERS

Hearing from leading CIO's and VP's at technology firms:

Many clients refusing to pay maintenance fees and have let contracts lapse

Vendors fearful of the high interest in third party maintenance. Some customers considering anti-trust suits in EU and US

Virtualization, Business Process Outsourcing, and SaaS seen as cost saving investments

Interest in SOA on the decline, but party faithful still in large numbers

Gov contracting, healthcare, compliance, project based solutions, and BI remain hot investment sectors for M&A
