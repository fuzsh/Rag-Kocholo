        "text": "This article explores how Slovenian collective memory and national identity have been renegotiated by post-communist political elites through the adoption of new state symbols in the light of changes connected to the collapse of communist ideology, the breakup of Yugoslavia, and the establishment of an independent Slovenian state. Concentrating on the ways state imagery is legitimated as representing the nation, the analysis discusses the post-1991 reorganization of Slovenian national symbols. I argue that, by analysing the adoption of a new state flag, coat of arms, and national anthem, the official national identity re-conceptualization shows how Slovenian national memory became redefined as the new state memory, which resulted in nationalizing state practices and policies.\n\nIn August 1948 Josip Broz – Tito was prominently featured in Life magazine, the cover and published article representing his first appearance in western media after Yugoslavia's break with the Cominform. The richly illustrated reportage showed the new state leader on the grounds of his Slovenian summer residence Vila Bled, and comprised of photographs of several artworks located at the Villa, including one of Tito posing in front of a statue of a charging partisan. As spaces of state representation official residences began to be set up soon after 1945; due to the lack of funds in the time of post-war rebuilding of the state and the five-year plan they were mostly planned as renovations of existing, nationalized buildings. Apart from serving as places of residence for President Tito on his visits, they were also regularly used as accommodation for foreign politicians on state visits and as ceremonial venues for important receptions. The many paintings and sculptures, as well as the renovated architecture, created a distinct and carefully thought-out backdrop for these occasions. Most of the artworks were specially commissioned with their execution closely supervised in order to appropriately promote the new, socialist regime; their reproductions were used as a constituent part of the state's visual propaganda in mass media, as suggested by the Life magazine example. The paper will examine how the new, socialist state was represented in these artworks and assess their role as conveyors of regime's political ideas. It will focus mostly on works commissioned for the Slovenian residences Vila Bled (1946–1947) and Brdo Castle (1950s), and base its survey on a comparative stylistic and iconographic analysis of paintings and sculptures."
