        "text": "Forty years ago today, Yugoslavia's lifetime president, Josip Broz Tito died at 3.05 pm, at the Ljubljana Clinical Centre in Slovenia, just three days before his 88th birthday.\n\nOn May 4, 1980, the national television programme was interrupted and presenter Miodrag Zdravkovic read the saddest news after which everything had changed: âComrad Tito had died.â\n\nHe headed Yugoslavia for 35 years, took the country out of the Soviet bloc and was one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement. He was an honorary member of all academies in Yugoslavia and many abroad. He was awarded the Order of the People's Hero (three times), the Order of Heroes of Socialist Labour, the Order of Lenin (USSR) and many other national and foreign decorations.\n\nHe received the Nehru Prize (India) in 1973 for international understanding. Tito's speeches, articles and other political and theoretical papers were published in several editions in former Yugoslavia as well as abroad.\n\nHe fell ill at the age of 88, but nevertheless performed his duties and participated in the 1979 Non-Aligned Summit in Havana. In January 1980, his left leg was amputated and four months later he passed away.\n\nHis funeral in Belgrade on May 8, was attended by representatives of more than 120 countries, kings, princes and about 700,000 people.\n\nFans of the character and works of Josip Broz Tito have traditionally been visiting his grave at the Flower House in Dedinje, Belgrade, in the early morning hours and most visitors come from countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia. This year, this will not be possible due to the coronavirus pandemic."
