        "text": "Communist Indoctrination From the Young Age\n\nKids who grew up in communist regimes, including the former Yugoslavia, were systematically indoctrinated to idolize their leaders, a phenomenon strikingly evident in the reverence for Tito. From a young age, every child had to memorize verses from songs and poems about “Comrade Tito,” reinforcing the deep-seated culture of personality cults that are characteristic of totalitarian systems, reminiscent of practices still observed in contemporary North Korea. This enforced glorification placed leaders like Tito on a pedestal, often through coercive means, ingraining them firmly into the nation’s social and cultural landscape.\n\nOne of the most popular events was Relay of Youth, celebrated on Tito’s “second birthday.“ It was the day he survived Operation Rösselsprung, a failed German airborne coup de main operation aimed at capturing Tito in Drvar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on May 25, 1944. Tito himself initiated this tradition in a manner of a true dictator’s grandeur. The relay involved a baton carrying a birthday pledge from the youth of Yugoslavia to Tito, symbolizing the unity of Yugoslav nations. The ceremony would end with Mass Games — in Yugoslavia known as Slet, a typical symbol of totalitarian regimes showcasing strong youth as a projection of absolute power and control.\n\nTo this day, numerous associations across the Balkans bear Tito’s name, founded in his honor, reflecting the enduring legacy of his cult of personality. Members of these associations continue to bring flowers to his statues, glorifying him in a manner akin to sainthood and showcasing his lasting impact on regional identity and collective memory. Tito’s efforts aimed to foster a unified national identity, employing mechanisms of control to maintain his authoritative grip on power. Such traditions, while promoting unity and patriotism, also served to ingrain Tito’s image as an infallible leader, embedding his persona into the very psyche of Yugoslavian society.\n\nToday, the idolization of leaders can still be observed, from the MAGA movement to the support during Obama’s presidency. However, unlike the forced idolization in authoritarian regimes, in modern democratic societies, the adulation of leaders is voluntary, born from genuine support or alignment with their policies and ideals.\n\nProgressive Reforms and Repressive Tactics\n\nTito’s rule was marked by a paradoxical blend of progressive reforms and repressive measures. While his policies modernized Yugoslavia and fostered a sense of unity among its diverse population, his regime was also characterized by political persecution and suppression of dissent. This duality remains a focal point in assessments of his leadership, reflecting the complex legacy of his rule.\n\nAfter WWII, a series of cleansing operations ensued, which solidified Communist control over all of Yugoslavia in 1945. Throughout this process, special agents carried out brutal reprisals against Croatian and Slovenian collaborators. In the periods immediately before and after the end of the war, Tito’s executors killed approximately 50,000 Croats, about 5,000 Serbs and Montenegrins, and a similar number of Slovenes, with some estimations of over a hundred thousand as new mass graves are being discovered. These liquidations were kept as top military and state secrets for decades to follow, known only to people who were directly involved in these operations, thus highlighting the regime’s repressive nature.\n\nCriticism of Tito, ranging from vocal dissent to even mild jokes, was met with severe consequences, from imprisonment on Naked Island prison to indefinite hard labor, or worse, murder. These measures highlight the stark absence of freedoms Westerners often take for granted, illustrating the severe limitations on speech and political expression under Tito’s regime. The phrase “eaten by dark,” a popular term in Yugoslavia at that time used to explain someone’s disappearance and, most likely, liquidation, vividly captures the fear and reality of speaking out against the government. This striking disparity between the oppressive conditions under Tito’s regime and societies that cherish free speech, like America, where anyone is free to call a president for example, an idiot, should serve as a warning. The freedoms we often take for granted are not universally guaranteed and must be vigilantly safeguarded. Free speech is the foundation of a democracy and is essential against tyranny.\n\nLegacy and Death\n\nIn his final years, Tito battled with diabetes and rheumatism, conditions that kept secret from the public eye. He refused surgery, opting instead for medication to treat poor circulation in his legs. Unfortunately, treatment was unsuccessful, leading to gangrene and the subsequent amputation of his leg 20 days later. Tito died on May 4, 1980, and his death culminated in a grand funeral attended by delegations from nearly every country in the world. His body was transported from Ljubljana to Belgrade via the Blue Train, and he was laid to rest in the House of Flowers, a mausoleum he had designated for himself.\n\nTito’s legacy is complex and multifaceted, encapsulating his role as a unifier and a divisive figure. He acted as a bridge between the East and the West on the international stage, positioning Yugoslavia as a key player in Cold War politics. For 35 years, he managed to maintain a delicate balance within Yugoslavia, a country of three religions, two alphabets, and six nations. Ironically, his magnum opus didn’t even last a decade after his death. It marked the end of an era, with millions in attendance at his funeral, reflecting his profound impact on his country and the world. His efforts to reconcile diverse groups within Yugoslavia while maintaining its sovereignty in a polarized global context continue to be a significant aspect of his enduring legacy.\n\nThe immediate aftermath of his death exposed the fragility of the Yugoslav federation, setting the stage for future wars in the region and the eventual disintegration of Yugoslavia. The discovery of an empty state treasury contrasted with his regal lifestyle and the narrative of prosperity presented to the public about Yugoslavia’s economic condition. This revelation cast a shadow on his governance, reinforcing the critique often directed at Communist regimes, like the former USSR and Venezuela, that, despite their utopian promises, Communist systems are inherently unsustainable.\n\nThe Enduring Enigma of Tito\n\nTo this day, Josip Broz Tito remains an enigmatic figure, embodying the contradictions of his time. His legacy, a complex mixture of liberation, authoritarianism, national pride, and political repression, continues to evoke debate and reflection. Some will forever see and glorify him as the best president and a hero, while others will call him a tyrant and a dictator responsible for hundreds of thousands of murders (liquidations) after WWII.\n\nDr. Josip Mihaljević, a historian at the Croatian Institute of History in Zagreb, said:\n\n“In public and in part of the historiography, Tito is evaluated from completely opposite viewpoints. Some authors emphasize solely his negatives and warn about Yugoslav totalitarianism. On the other hand, there are those who highlight Yugoslavia’s economic development and international significance. Neither is disputable. If we consider the history of the 20th century and the traumas that occurred, if your family experienced trauma during World War II when fascist regimes harmed your relatives, it’s clear that Tito, as a member of the Anti-Fascist Coalition, is closer and more favorable to you. If someone suffered from the communist regime, you will have a negative image of Tito. Likewise, if you are an advocate of collectivist political ideologies, you might overlook the crimes committed by his regime, and if you are a proponent of democracy and political pluralism, you won’t consider the international significance of Yugoslavia important when judging Tito. Yes, he is a criminal because he is responsible for the crimes that occurred at the end of World War II and after it. But he is also responsible for some positive achievements.”\n\nAs history marches on, Tito’s life and leadership endure as a subject of fascination and study, a testament to his lasting mark on the Balkans and the world."
