        "text": "The concepts of monumentality and collective memory have not been neglected by discourses concerning national identity. However, insights favouring forgetting and counter-memory are considerably new approaches reconstructing identities and redressing tragedy after pronounced violence. Erecting monuments is often a strategy towards building and inciting public memory and defining the nation, but they can also be used as a means of masking histories and manipulating national narratives – this is seemingly the case in a number of post-war monuments throughout the former Yugoslavia. The interplay between cultural heritage, memory, and space is a huge component of national identity; the installation of monuments memorializing non-Yugoslav celebrities throughout the newly defined states serve as a means to reconstitute identity, redefine heritage and avoid the celebration of a painful past. By consolidating existing theories on nationalism, identity and memory, this paper will examine the potential consequences of this manipulation of public space. Through a discussion of the way in which identities can strive to strategically avoid the state in the ‘non-commemoration’ of the nation and its inflicted traumas, I hope to demonstrate that the state is always present: that even through neglecting it – it is always referenced, that the framework of political sociology can operate, not just by identifying and treating the state as an actor, but also by simply acknowledging the state as spectre.\n\nThe paper argues that post-socialist neoliberal democracy is hindered by the exposed or conditioned ethnic symbolic radical populism, particularly in the post-Yugoslav ethnonationalism political behavior. Moreover, the approach toward the fascist ideology symbols disregards the communist social memory of stability and human security and a collectivism-oriented community. Neoliberal globalization has strengthened national identities, supported by the war-related creation of ethnic homogenous territories. Consequently, former Yugoslavia’s historical conflicting memory cultures from WW2 to the Yugoslav wars present enduring processes within sociopolitical ethnic-religious traditions. The collective historical and social memory that forms people’s identities is manipulated, falsified, reduced, and politically instrumentalized. Contemporary ethnic-symbolic politics communicate through conservative political orientations: re-traditionalism behavior (including some left-wingers) advocates public acceptance. Historical anti-fascism actors have been stigmatized within attitudes toward fascist ideology symbolism and traditional Balkan sociopolitical mythologies. Frequent use of (often) antagonistic ethnic symbolism in textual, rhetorical and visual forms expresses it. Various methods of conducting historical revisionism in the symbolic and ideological vocations decrease Yugoslavia’s social memory. Institutional and non-institutional engagement is normatively needed in a battle for correct memory. Citizens’ participation in political decision-making outside the ethnoreligious paradigm is crucial. The consequence of populist political orders in ethnoreligious partitioned post-socialism is ethnic-symbolic collectivism. It oppresses individual identity and excludes the possibility of distinct classification. Contemporary notions of autonomy and mind, adapted to modern society, provide a theoretical framework for formulating political strategies in a post-national context. Acquisitive components of civil society and the society’s stagnation due to slow consolidation can abruptly transform into political apathy motivating violent disorder. Accordingly, many sociopolitical realities symbolize and indicate that \"democratized\" post-socialist and post-Yugoslav states are more \"inadequate\" and \"ineffective\" than Yugoslavia.

Reconfiguring Communities of Memory in Yugoslavia. On the Work of the Monument Group and Four Faces of Omarska Group' (2012) examines the tactics, methods and political potential of critical memorial practices in the new Yugoslav space. Not wishing to construct a rigid definition of ‘critical memorial practices’ I understand these as diverse artistic and intellectual procedures that confront the effects of dominant, nationalistic memorial cultures and work prospectively towards a different understanding of both collective memory and community. In analyzing their political potential in this particular socio-political context, I depart from a general understanding that conventional public monuments, rather than embodying memory, actually displace it, and, moreover, are in fact instrumental in either the production or suppression of specific memories through institutionalized forms of memory politics. While having this expanded version of Young’s premise in mind, I attempt to locate modalities through which the complex and challenging conjunctions of the concepts of embodiment, memory and the collective can be both politically and symbolically reclaimed. In the first part, aside from introducing a more general discussion on memorial cultures and counter-memorial drive, I delineate the specificities of the Yugoslav historical and political context. In the second part I move on to read the above-mentioned postulate by Young in order to argue that a process of reclamation is only possible through the re-situation of these concepts (of the monuments, collective memory and embodiment) outside the realm of singular artistic vision and visual representation and into the wider field of emancipatory politics. Such politics come to being thorough a collective reflection that not only involves an open and exploratory confrontation with the past, but also activates a radical reconstruction, reconfiguration and re-imagination of the idea of community. This reconfiguration, in turn, can only be achieved by forging new, non-essentialist communities of memory similar to “inoperative communities”, as elaborated by Jean Luc Nancy. In defining such an emancipatory idea of community in relation to memorial cultures I will have in mind some interrelated concepts developed by J-L. Nancy, as well as Maurice Blanchot and Giorgio Agamben. These theoretical configurations will be brought into relation with the idea of communism (understood in line with Alain Badiou) and its dissolution already in the Socialist State and brought to ultimate destruction through the genocidal politics of the 1990s. Finally, in the third part, I examine the multifaceted work of the Yugoslav art and theory platform - Monument Group as well as the work of the Four Faces of Omarska Group, by analysing the concrete case of the Omarska Concentration Camp. I contemplate the potential of a specific architectural remain on its as a 'becoming memorial'. In the conclusion, my central argument is that, in the face of a proliferation of monuments and cultures of ethnic and religious commemoration in the current transitional and post- conflict Yugoslav space, we should explore and seek to encourage those forms of the “embodiment of memory” which operate by way of instigating wider, continuous critical memorial forums consisting of different ‘voices’ and unresolvable conversations involving subjects and objects. Such forums reinvest with collective desire and radically politicize the political concepts and events from the past, such as the communist idea on which the Anti-fascist liberation struggle during WWII was based, and potentiate their effects in the present, simultaneously developing forms of memorialization that prefiguratively work towards a radically different, non- essentialist and “inoperative” community of the future.\n\nStarting from the thesis that ''history is written by the winners”, ''mainstream'' history can be under¬stood as the revised and politically instrumentalized means of a certain nation's ''cultural'' memory, which some consider to be a ''history of selective memo¬ri¬zation and selective forgetfulness''. Most approaches in con¬temporary Croatian historiography which are focu¬sed on the historical periods of monarchist and socialist Yugoslavia use national-level themes as their starting point. A similar preoccupation is also present in those historiographical approaches which are focused on the problems of analyzing and understanding how collective memories are constructed. However, our aim here is to move from the ''big'' themes to a ''small'' (local) setting. In this context, Samobor, a small Croatian urban centre, is going to serve us as the basis for analyzing in which way two Yugoslav rulers – King Alexander Karađorđević and Marshal Josip Broz Tito – were perceived on the local level. By analyzing the relevant archival sources as well as contemporary periodicals, we seek to un¬der¬stand the ways in which local authorities and elites, from their position of social power and status, received the mentioned rulers during their visits, and in which ways did they honour and commemorate these high-profile guests. Through this analysis, we hope to gain a better understanding of the process of the creation of local social memory, the constitution of memorial and cul¬tural patterns, and their key cultural elements and me¬anings, which are often torn apart during periods of social and political upheaval, only to be reconstituted by recombining the same key cultural and social elements while simultaneously encompassing new actors. In other words, the focus of our analysis will be on tracing the collective memory of the population of Samobor to¬wards two ''great leaders''.
