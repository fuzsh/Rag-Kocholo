        "text": "The Balkans was a politically and ideologically diverse region during the Cold War. Bulgaria and Romania were parties to the Warsaw Pact, with the former not uncommonly labelled the “16th Republic” of the Soviet Union. Albania, too, was a staunchly Stalinist state, but during the Sino-Soviet split, the country’s communist dictator Enver Hoxha decided to side with the People’s Republic of China, after which the country was isolated for most of the Cold War period. Greece has been a member of the European Union since 1981 and, along with Turkey were members of NATO, thus belonging to the Western, capitalist (and, arguably, democratic) bloc. Finally, Yugoslavia, another communist state, pursued its own economic ideology, separate from that of the Soviet Union, on the principles of a liberalised, almost Western-like, market socialism. It was the only communist country to establish formal foreign and trade relations with the European Economic Community (ECC) and founded the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961.\n\nYugoslavia will be the main focus of this analysis. The development of its foreign and trade relations throughout most of the Cold War unveils important lessons about balancing its geopolitical and economic interests between two major trading blocs. Although the Belgrade government insisted on its independent, non-aligned position on the international stage, this analysis will seek to explain the difficulties and advantages of maintaining such a position, and will thus apply them to modern-day Bulgaria, a full member state of the EU and NATO that has trade relations, mainly in the energy and tourism sectors, with the successor state of the Soviet Union – Russia. The body of this article is broken down into four main sections. Firstly, a broader analysis of Yugoslavia’s ‘in-between’ position will be provided for the period 1948-1965. Secondly, this article will look at the Economic Reforms of 1965 that sought to further liberalise the Yugoslav economy. Thirdly, it will look at the effect of these reforms on trade with the EEC and the crisis in relations during that lasted throughout the 1970s. Finally, it will provide concluding thoughts regarding Bulgaria since the beginning of the period of ‘democratisation’ and transition to market economy in 1989.\n\nYugoslavia between the regional trade blocs (1948-65)\n\nCommunism was not interpreted uniformly throughout Eastern Europe. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin propagated the “socialism in one country” principle, whereby the industrial base and military power of the communist state are built up, before competing with the economically advanced nations of the West and exporting communist revolution to the world. However, his namesake and Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito had different ideas. What would later become the ideology of Titoism, Josip Broz advocated policies and practices based on the principle that in each country the means of attaining ultimate communist goals must be dictated by the conditions of that particular country, i.e. Yugoslavia, rather than by a pattern set in another country – the USSR. Titoism is characterised by self-management, cooperation between nations and independent foreign and trade policies, which, despite obvious exogenous factors, contributed significantly to characterising Yugoslavia’s political and economic relations with not only both camps in Europe, but also the rest of the world.\n\nThis clear divergence led to the Soviet-Yugoslav split: Yugoslavia was expelled from the Communist Information Bureau (the Cominform), and the Soviet bloc by default, in 1948. Yugoslavia was practically left isolated in a bipolar world, which undoubtedly resulted in insecurity among policymakers in Belgrade: “…more than a decade of anxiety and uncertainty for the Yugoslavs about the effect on their economy of the apparent division of the world into regional economic blocs.” (Holt and Stapleton, 1971: 47). The West unsurprisingly saw Yugoslavia’s expulsion from the rival bloc as an opportunity to establish economic relations with what was still a communist state, and, possibly, prove that capitalist economic system will gradually and naturally overcome the communist principles of the Yugoslav state. Thus, from 1949 Yugoslavia began receiving offers for loans and other forms of aid from Western countries and organisations (Holt and Stapleton, 1971), which arguably contributed to Belgrade’s decision to seek a trade agreement with the EEC. Yugoslavia’s foreign trade was thus diverted toward Western Europe and the United States (Obadić, 2014).\n\nStalin’s death in 1953 led to Soviet-Yugoslav relations warming, with the Soviets “revoking restrictions on trade with Yugoslavia” (Holt and Stapleton, 1971: 41). Be that as it may, Western Europe remained Yugoslavia’s major trading partner and Tito made it clear during the Moscow conference of Communist Particles four years later that Yugoslavia will be non-aligned and will not intend to rejoin the Soviet bloc. This, however did create unprecedented challenges for the Belgrade government. For at least the first half of the 1950s, Yugoslavia’s foreign and trade policy was multifaceted, stuck isolated in the middle of the two blocs, preoccupied with surviving the Soviet threat (Obadić, 2014: 331). This complex policy included a focus on Third World countries and other countries that were non-aligned, which would later comprise of the Belgrade-led Non-Aligned Movement, but Yugoslavia was still economically and financially dependent on the West and, nonetheless, shared ideological principles with the Soviet East. What was at first Yugoslav apathy towards Europe’s integration project, turned into serious anxiety. Belgrade was interested in cooperation with the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation, which later became the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as it offered the liberalisation of trade and the opportunity to be better informed about the investment plans of Western European states (Obadić, 2014). However, the emergence of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952 and the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957 gradually drew the attention of Yugoslav policymakers, because the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) posed serious threats to Yugoslav exports. Since the establishment of the common European agricultural market, Yugoslavia’s agricultural exports steeply reduced from over 50% of the country’s total sales to the EEC in the early 1960s to 13.5% in 1978.\n\nDespite the non-alignment of Yugoslav foreign and trade policy, the EEC’s increasingly protection policy forced Yugoslavia to shift its attention from agricultural exports to industrialisation and the export of industrial goods. This development had significant social and political repercussions and it changed the volume and structure of Yugoslav foreign trade. A process of industrialisation meant that the Yugoslav economy was more reliant on raw materials from Western Europe to export a larger share of industrial products. This led to a significant problem for the Yugoslav economy – the balance-of-payment deficit increased (Obadić, 2014). The balance of payments is the record of all international financial transactions made by a country, showing whether it saves enough to pay for its imports and whether the country produces enough economic output to pay for its growth. The strategy pursued by Belgrade authorities for tackling this deficit was through Western aid and donations, war reparations and financial credits, yet this would not be a feasible long-term strategy for Tito, if he wishes to keep Yugoslavia independent and non-aligned. Therefore, exports needed to be expanded.\n\nIn order to maintain economic independence, Yugoslav economist Janez Stanovnik set out three main measures to be taken (Holt and Stapleton, 1971): economic ties with other non-aligned countries, i.e. the Third World; concentrating investment policy on promoting export industries and joining with other non-aligned countries in the development of normal trade relations with the existing blocs. Widening and diversifying its foreign-trade relations with the Third World seemed to be the only sensible policy choice for Tito, as he maintained that Yugoslavia ought to base its economic development on these emerging markets, which will anticipatedly experience sufficient growth (Obadić, 2014). It was hoped that this policy would solve the problem of economic dependence of Yugoslavia on the West, and that it will provide growing markets for Yugoslav industrial products in the long-term, considering these products’ lack of competitiveness in the Western European market.\n\nWith this policy, Yugoslavia became increasingly involved internationally as a diplomatic power. Throughout the 1960s, Belgrade sought to make use of this increased international presence – it monitored the negotiations and discussions on international trade within UNCTAD and GATT, expecting the establishment of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) to ease the country’s economic challenges, and founded and played an active role within the Group 77 – a coalition of developing nations, designed to promote its members’ collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the United Nations. Furthermore, Tito initiated the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961, resumed relations with the OECD as an observer, became associated with COMECON in 1964, a member of GATT in 1966 and also established relations with the EFTA. Additionally, the 1964 agreement with the Eastern bloc was a result of increased trade between the two in the period 1962-1965, reaching a high point of 34.69% in 1965 (see Figure 1 below).\n\nPercentage of total Yugoslav trade to EEC, COMECON, EFTA and Developing Countries 1958-70\n\nFigure 1\n\nNonetheless, establishing trade relations with EEC proved to be more difficult, as the Europeans showed little signs of enthusiasm for negotiations on a trade agreement with Yugoslavia (Obadić, 2014). In addition, Yugoslavia’s experimental expansion towards the Third World markets did not solve the severe balance-of-payments deficit (as Figure 2 shows for the second half of the 1960s), thus it could not lessen the importance of Western Europe as a trade partner for Belgrade.\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe policy of trading with the non-aligned Third World was not particularly successful: the comfortable surplus position of 1962 (seen in Figure 3) was short-lived and lapsed into one of deficit in which imports rose faster than exports, rather than the other way around, which is why Yugoslavia sought expansion into these markets in the first place.\n\nFigure 3\n\n1965 Economic Reforms\n\nIn order to address the structural problems of Yugoslavia’s foreign-trade policy, the Belgrade government introduced a major economic reform in 1965, which was a “complete abandonment” of classical Marxist theory (Margold, 1967: 66). The new economic programme included an allocation of greater responsibility to industries for their gains and losses, which meant a strengthening of the self-management system, a de-politicisation and decentralisation of the economy, stricter policies towards unprofitable enterprises (such as the cancellation of subsidies), a new banking system that would make banks more responsible for giving out loans and credits and boosting exports by focusing on quality and price without subsidy (Margold, 1967: 66-7).\n\nThese policies were introduced after a domestic political rivalry between liberals and conservatives, who favourited a Soviet-style centralised economy, in Yugoslavia. Tito’s ultimate support for the liberal platform was undoubtedly crucial, resulting in the reforms introduced. Thus, as Obadić writes (2014), between 1965 and the early 70s, Yugoslavia had developed into a federalist society, based on “national” equality and market economy. The reforms gave further impetus to the cultural and economic openness to the West, to which Yugoslavia was open since the early 1950s.\n\nImplementing the Reforms seemed to be an uphill struggle, as there was significant internal resistance, especially from the southern republics. The closure or merging of unprofitable industries affected the southern republics more (which subsequently produced the least economic output), where local or provincial authorities were given various privileges under former policies. These republics believed that market socialism did not fit within the structure of the Yugoslav economic system because of the great disparities of wealth between the regions themselves (Pirjevec, 2012). On the other hand, Croatia and Slovenia, the more developed republics, strongly supported market socialism and the 1965 reforms, as their own economies had already established closer ties with Western Europe and even asked the central Belgrade authorities for their own semi-official missions in Western Europe.\n\nTrade in the second half of the 1960s with the Third World and COMECON stagnated, while trade with the European trade blocs (EEC and EFTA) increased (see Figure 1 above). The Soviet bloc had strict bilateral clearing system with the outside countries they conducted trade with. These agreements were government-to-government reciprocal trade agreements up to a specific amount and for a limited period. Value of these trades is expressed usually in a major currency (usually US dollars) but the exporters in both countries are paid in their local currency. After its establishment in 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) termed such agreements disruptive of free trade (Bilateral Clearing Agreement, n.d.). Despite the growing demand for Yugoslav products in the COMECON area, the bilateral clearing system constrained Yugoslav exports. In addition, Yugoslavia was not interested in importing products from the Soviet bloc, due to low comparative quality, the terms of trade, the policy of economic non-alignment, among other reasons. The liberal reforms failed in 1968 because they failed to address Yugoslavia’s major long-term economic challenge: “the inability to integrate free-market mechanism within the socialist foundations of society” (Batović, 2009; see also Singleton and Carter, 1982) and began to cause significant divergences in economic productivity within Yugoslavia itself, which Tito sought to avoid in principle from the beginning of his leadership.\n\nYugoslavia’s renewed relations with the EEC and the 70s relationship crisis\n\nAs previously mentioned, Yugoslavia’s trade relations with the EEC were largely asymmetrical – the primary Yugoslav export was agricultural products that, although were unaffected until the mid-1960s by the EEC’s agricultural protectionism, would be hit by the full implementation of the CAP. Beef was one of the most important Yugoslav export products in the Western European common market (Obadić, 2014) and the Belgrade authorities even adapted its beef production to the demands of the Italian market. There was increasing competition from French farmers, who also diverted their attention to the production of beef, which turned out to be the most profitable sector in the agricultural industry.\n\nBeef remained a contentious issue during the negotiations for a trade agreement between the EEC and Yugoslavia, with French obstructionism even leading to a stalemate in negotiations. However, other member states’ dissatisfaction with France finally led to a three-year Trade Agreement signed in 1970, two years after the EEC and Yugoslavia formally established relations, and also after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia – a major exogenous factor contributing to Western enthusiasm for an agreement with Yugoslavia. The signing of this agreement was undoubtedly a great achievement and milestone for the Yugoslav authorities – it covered trading arrangements for beef and other important Yugoslav agricultural products, as well as tariff concessions for Yugoslav industrial exports, and it liberalised trade between the two parties. Furthermore, Belgrade successfully insisted on a non-preferential agreement, arguing that the discriminatory nature of preferential agreements would discredit their policy of non-alignment in the Third World countries. Yugoslavia was also included in the GSP programme, which provided exemption from customs duties on imports of industrial products from developing countries. Hence, the Yugoslav relationship with the EEC was unusual: on the one hand Yugoslavia was a beneficiary of GSP; on the other hand, its relations with the EEC were arranged by the Trade Agreement. As one of the most developed countries among the beneficiaries of the GSP, Yugoslavia derived the most benefit from this scheme (Yugoslavia and the European Community, 1979).\n\nAlthough all this sounds great for the Yugoslav economy, the 70s saw a decline in EEC-Yugoslav trade relations, because of the still unresolved problem of the balance-of-payment deficit. Exogenous factors such as the 1973 oil crisis led to the EEC introducing further protectionist measures to protect industries and workers (Frangeš, 1976). Safeguard clauses were applied to the beef and veal sectors between 1974 and 1977 and, by then, Yugoslavia had developed a dependence on migrant remittances, which were, too, hampered because of the rising unemployment in Western Europe. Figure 4 shows an increase in exports unable to match the increase of imports, thus contributing to the deficit in the balance of payments. Figure 5 shows a similar trend: a steady rise in the invisible balance of payments, characterised mainly by Yugoslavia’s dependence on migrant remittances, but insufficient to counter the steeper decline in the visible balance.\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 5\n\nThe liberals in power in Belgrade were thus replaced by conservatives, who sought to legitimise their authority by expanding investments that were financed by further international loans – possibly not the most economically rational decision. However, both the EEC and Belgrade authorities were interested in improving trade relations, especially the former, as Yugoslavia began diverting its economic attention to COMECON once again. After an intensification of diplomatic relations, a Joint Declaration of Belgrade was signed in 1976 and a Cooperation Agreement in 1980, the latter of which was stimulated by major exogenous and endogenous political events – the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the death of Josip Broz Tito.\n\nLessons for contemporary Bulgaria?\n\nAlthough it might initially seem unusual to draw conclusions from Tito’s Yugoslavia for Bulgaria as an EU member, there are significant lessons learned from Yugoslavia’s foreign trade relations between the late 40s and 70s. Firstly, Yugoslavia’s expulsion from the Soviet bloc in 1948 mirrors the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 80s and early 90s. Western Europe sought to seize the opportunity to establish economic relations with communist Yugoslavia in order to exert its market power and, possibly, seek to overcome communist economic ideals. The West arguably did the same with Eastern Europe in the early 90s. Damro provides an analysis of the EU’s international power being exerted through its market presence, arguing the EU’s identity is not a particular set of collective norms but rather a comparatively large regulated market with institutional features (Damro, 2012). After all, the EU has evolved from its origins as a market integration experiment into the world’s foremost economic bloc. This has obviously remained the case during Bulgaria’s accession in 2007 – as the four graphs below show, consistently about two thirds of Bulgaria’s imports and exports have been from and to the EU.\n\nDespite Stalin’s death, Tito insisted on a non-aligned Yugoslavia, which did ultimately cause the Yugoslav economy headaches, considering the rising balance-of-payments deficit. This insistence could be reflected in the UK’s desire to leave the EU, and even adopt a hard Brexit stance under the current Conservative government. This is yet another example of Europe’s market power – numerous analysts have made pessimistic predictions for the British economy should the Brexit negotiations outcome be a hard one.\n\nThe integration of the EEC and the establishment of the CAP caused a steep reduction in Yugoslav agricultural exports and, consequently, hit the Yugoslav economy. However, Bulgaria’s membership has produced mixed results in the agricultural sector: there has been increases in the production of wheat and barley since accession in 2007 (see Figures below; Agriculture and Food Ministry, 2012), but significant decreases in the production of other agricultural products, such as tomatoes.\n\nYugoslavia’s foreign policy attention towards the Third World, although arguably unsuccessful in the long run, has shown that exporting to these countries may not be a sustainable economic growth model. If Sofia is now looking towards the Western Balkan countries, it can focus more on importing from these countries products that are in deficit in the Bulgarian economy, but, more importantly, the export of relatively cheaper know-how and technology to neighbouring countries has the potential to create much-needed regional cooperation. Similarly, Bulgaria and other countries in the Balkan region ought not to rely on migrant remittances. According to Bulgarian National Bank data for 2017, migrant remittances to Bulgaria have overtaken foreign direct investments. Such a trend is not only vulnerable to exogenous financial crises, but indirectly contributes to the rising levels of brain drain.\n\nThis analysis may have confirmed what many analysts already knew about Eastern Europe’s economic challenges, but it also tried to give an objective account of the politics of non-alignment in a bipolar world. The post-Cold War world may have been the result of a victory of capitalism and democracy, but it has also shown that the maintenance of a non-aligned trade policy is extremely difficult to achieve for developing or semi-developed countries in the presence of a single (as in the case of Bulgaria and the EU) or two major trading blocs (Yugoslavia in the Cold War period). Tito’s insistence on a non-aligned policy contributed to the diverging economic performances of the separate republics of Yugoslavia – Slovenia and Croatia proved their economic productivity to Western Europe, as there were calls for certain concessions for trading with those two regions, whereas republics that lagged behind were critical of the 1965 liberal reforms. From the perspective of international trade, Bulgaria is not in the exact same position today as Yugoslavia was in the Cold War, but both cases prove to us that they are/were countries on some sort of economic periphery around the core of the EU/EEC.\n\nBibliography"
