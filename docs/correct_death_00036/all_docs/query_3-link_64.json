        "text": "Yugoslavia was different from the other Eastern European socialist states. From being the Soviet Union’s staunchest ally after the Second World War, it turned into its most direct challenger in 1948 when the Yugoslav Communist leadership under Josip Broz Tito clashed with the Soviet leadership under Josif V. Stalin. As a result, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) was branded as a heretic party and expelled from the Cominform, the organization of Eastern European socialist states. In the aftermath of the conflict, Yugoslavia did not give up communist ideology, but due to Soviet economic sanctions and faced with the possibility of a military attack from the East, Tito sought assistance from the West, short of committing to any formal alliance. When Stalin died in 1953, however, Yugoslavia, instead of realigning with the Soviet Union, set out to define its own path of national communism, thus becoming the first socialist country in Europe not formally tied to Moscow.\n\n[T]hose in the Western world who tend to regard [Tito as] just another Gottwald or Gomulka, but one who happened to break loose from Moscow, are making a big mistake.\n\n— George F. Kennan, US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, 19 July 19611"
