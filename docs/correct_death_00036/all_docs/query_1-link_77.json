        "text": "Serbia became a stand-alone sovereign republic in the summer of 2006 after Montenegro voted in a referendum for independence from the Union of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nThe end of the Union marked the closing chapter in the separation of the six republics of the old Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, which was proclaimed in 1945 and comprised Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia.\n\nYugoslavia's communist leader, Josip Broz Tito, kept the lid on ethnic tensions. The federation lasted for over 10 years after his death in 1980, but under Serbian nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic it fell apart through the 1990s.\n\nThe secession of Slovenia and Macedonia came relatively peacefully, but there were devastating wars in Croatia and Bosnia. Serbia and Montenegro together formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2003 before forming a looser union.\n\nIn 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence.\n\nIn recent years the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) has steadily eroded political rights and civil liberties, putting pressure on independent media, the political opposition, and civil society organizations, says the democracy advocacy group Freedom House.\n\nPresident Aleksandar Vucic claimed a re-election victory in the country's snap December 2023 elections, with his Serbian Progressive Party, or SNS, winning some 47% of the vote. Opposition parties under the Serbia Against Violence (SPN) banner were well behind with around 23%.\n\nThe vote was almost immediately marred by accusations of irregularities.\n\nThe International Election Observation Mission said in a statement that \"serious irregularities, including vote-buying and ballot box stuffing were observed\".\n\nThe SNS has been in power since 2012 but there have been three elections since 2020.\n\nOpposition figures accused the SNS of using public resources for political purposes and election monitor CRTA complained before the vote of a \"chronic lack of pluralism\" in Serbia.\n\nIn 2021, Amnesty International characterised his mandate as one of human rights violations, restrictions on freedom of expression and campaigns of harassment against the opposition figures, journalists and media outlets.\n\nSerbia is a candidate to become a member of the European Union, and President Vucic is under pressure from both the EU and the US to normalise relations with Kosovo.\n\nKosovo declared unilateral independence from Serbia in 2008, and while it is recognised by more than 100 UN members, Serbia has refused to do so - backed by allies like Russia, China and five EU members.\n\nPrime minister: Milos Vucevic\n\nMilos Vucevic, leader of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) became prime minister in May 2024, taking over from Ana Brnabic.\n\nVucevic's government has the challenge of maintaining Serbia's relations with Russia and China while pursuing its goal of European Union membership.\n\nIn a speech shortly after his appointment, Vucevic told the Serbian parliament that EU membership remained Serbia's goal but that the \"burdens\" introduced into the membership process \"cannot be ignored.\"\n\nHe said EU expectations were tied to Serbia \"humiliating\" itself by recognising Kosovo's independence and joining sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTelevision is, by far, the main source of news and information. The flagship public network, RTS1, is among a handful of outlets that dominate the market.\n\nThere are more than 90 TV channels and the average viewer spends more than five hours a day watching television, the highest figure in Europe.\n\nSix TV stations are licensed to broadcast nationally; 30 have regional licences. The national TV broadcasters attract around 70% of the audience.\n\nRTS1 is the most popular channel in Serbia, attracting up to a quarter of the audience and providing strong competition for commercial stations, including leading commercial network TV Pink."
