        "text": "Tito knew how to enjoy life – among other things…\n\nOn this day, twenty-seven years ago, at 15.10 Josip Broz – Tito died in Ljubljana Clinical Centre at the age of 88.\n\n[audio:tito-osmrtnica2.mp3]\n\nThe announcement of his death on Radio Belgrade\n\nat first you hear a commentary of a football match between Hajduk and Crvena zvezda, then a male voice interrupts, saying “and now for some music from our studio”, upon which we hear the first bars of The Internationale played at a very slow tempo. A female voice than says.\n\nRadio Belgrade, first, second and third programmes and Radio Belgrade 202. United Serbian radio stations and Radio Titograd\n\nMale voice:\n\nCentral Committee of League of Communists of Yugoslavia and Presidency of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have issued a statement at 18.00 hours. The statement reads: To the working class, to the working people and citizens, to the nations of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Comrade Tito has died.\n\nAnd this is how his funeral looked like:\n\nA clip from film “Underground” by Emir Kusturica\n\nDespite Tito’s controversial role (or precisely because of it) his death was mourned all over the world. It also meant a start of the true dissolution of Yugoslavia – and some people are liable to see his death in Ljubljana as a sign of things that were to follow and start precisely in Slovenia.\n\nIn any event, it was an end of an era…. And a start of a new, much more turbulent one…\n\nMore Tito memorabilia here…"
