        "text": "History, we know, is written by the victors – especially when they are Communists. Getting rid of inconvenient facts is child’s play to rulers who are happy to get rid of people on a massive scale. And so, a generation after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, historians still struggle to dismantle all the convenient stories the Communists told.\n\nJosip Broz Tito, ruler of Yugoslavia from 1945 to his death in 1980, was a victor twice over. His first victory was that he was the only resistance leader in Europe to emerge, at the end of the Second World War, at the head of an army of hundreds of thousands, in control of a large part of his country. And his second was a moral victory: after his break with Stalin in 1948, Tito was feted as a brave, independent statesman, standing up against the Soviet bully.\n\nThe subtitle of this book is “How the Maharaja of the Balkans Fooled the World”, so readers can expect some serious myth-busting. Above all, the “fooling” consisted of the pose Tito adopted in that latter period, when he persuaded Western leaders that he was their strategic ally against Moscow. But the whole of his life is laid out for examination here.\n\nTito was a village boy, with just six years of schooling and an apprenticeship as a locksmith. Serving in the First World War, he was captured by the Russians and then recruited by the Bolsheviks. Training in Moscow followed – probably, the authors suggest, by military intelligence – and he worked as an agent, in and out of Yugoslavia, thereafter.\n\nBack in Moscow in 1935, he showed a talent for informing on his close colleagues, who were taken off to firing squads. Returning to Yugoslavia, he quickly denounced his main rival and took control of the rag‑tag Communist party. When Hitler launched his Blitzkrieg against Yugoslavia in April 1941, Tito did nothing to prepare anti-German resistance. He was following the Moscow line, as Germany was Stalin’s ally – that would change only when Hitler invaded Russia 10 weeks later.\n\nThe authors make this point well; but then, in their coverage of the war in Yugoslavia, they stay surprisingly close to the traditional, self-congratulatory Communist story. They emphasise that Tito assembled large forces, marched long distances, and sometimes fought fierce battles with the Germans; they do not stress that the marches were retreats and that the big battles were fought by Tito’s Partisans only when the Germans bothered to attack them.\n\nFor a polemically anti-Tito book, this pulls several punches. Tito’s secret truce offer to the Germans in 1943 is glossed over as being essentially concerned only with a prisoner exchange. Yet we have the account of the German intelligence officer involved, who says that Tito offered to collaborate with the Germans in resisting any Anglo-American landing on the coast – an offer fully in tune with Tito’s own strategic plans, as he feared that the Allies would restore the old royal government in Belgrade.\n\nAgain, Tito is credited with harrying the Germans at the end of the war, as they withdrew their armies from Greece and Macedonia through Yugoslavia. Two of his divisions, we are told, attacked them as they passed through Kosovo; I have read the war diary of the German commander (in the Washington archives) and even minor Partisan attacks are hardly mentioned – let alone these imaginary divisions. In all, 350,000 Germans got safely through. Tito didn’t want to waste ammunition on Germans who were leaving anyway; he was too busy trying to conquer bits of territory outside the borders of the old Yugoslavia.\n\nWhich brings us, more than halfway through the book, to the main point: Tito’s ambition, megalomania even, as a post-war leader. There are fascinating details here about his control of a far-flung network of agents, Spanish Civil War veterans and others; at the end of the war, hard-line Italian Communists were primed to rise up in major cities, in the hope of a Yugoslav invasion to seize Venice. It was these ambitions, plus his waging of another war by proxy, the Greek Civil War, that persuaded Stalin to break off relations in 1948. Thereafter, the authors chart Tito’s clever self-reinvention as a “non‑aligned” statesman, which gained him huge American subsidies. The break with Moscow was fairly brief; Khrushchev courted him and soon he was being subsidised by both sides. His instinctive alignment, of course, was always pro-Communist, so it was the West that was “fooled”.\n\nDid this matter? The authors argue that, in a long-term continuation of his broader Mediterranean strategy, Tito inflicted real damage on Britain and France, by helping to arm Nasser in Egypt (strengthening his hand over Suez) and the rebels in Algeria. The information given here is fascinating, but the conclusion seems very overblown – that it was Tito who caused the collapse of Anglo-French colonialism in the Mediterranean. And the idea that Tito became Khrushchev’s foreign policy “guru”, single-handedly turning him into a Third World interventionist, is even more of a stretch.\n\nThe strength of this book lies not in such grand speculations, but in its sharp detail. Unfortunately the details take some digging out, amid a forest of names and acronyms; the prose, though sometimes snappy or quirky, is not an easy read. But still, those who persist will learn a great deal that is missing from the standard accounts.\n\nTito’s Secret Empire by William Klinger and Denis Kuljiš is published by Hurst at £30.
