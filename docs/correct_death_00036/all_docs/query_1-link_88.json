        "text": "When I got off my Air Montenegro flight in Podgorica during the summer of 2017, I still thought I that would go into academia. I was set to defend my PhD in Brussels, where I was living at the time, in only a few months. I had come to the Balkans for summer holiday.\n\nFate had other ideas. There were a lot of things on that trip that led to the moment when I saw, in indefinite terms, what became the Tito’s Lost Children trilogy laid out in front of me: walking the walls of Dubrovnik for the first time, heading to the town of Trebinje in Republika Srpska, standing in the courtyard of the Cetinje Monastery, gazing up at the cliff-perched Ostrog Monastery, standing on the beach before the resort island of Sveti Stefan….\n\nMore than any of the others, though, I’d have to say that the idea for the Tito’s Lost Children trilogy hit me like a ton of bricks while I was standing on the dais behind Saint-Poet-King Njegoš’s tomb. I remember walking up the covered concrete stairways toward the tomb on the summit of Mount Lovćen. Speaking with the tomb’s caretaker, him telling me how Njegoš and Slovene poet France Prešeren were both, in some way shape or form, advocates of Yugoslav unity. He spoke Serbo-Croat and I spoke in Slovene. Then I went into the tomb itself, with its large obsidian statue.\n\nFinally, I walked out onto the dais. All of Montenegro was spread out before me. It just clicked: What if Marshall Josip Broz Tito had named a successor, ordained to try and keep all of Yugoslavia’s nationalities together after his death? I saw the whole story in a flash: a young woman suddenly faced with an overwhelming undertaking and responsibility, her country-bumpkin, scrappy brother, their hard-fighting but mute sidekick, a hung-out army captain determined to win redemption in the eyes of his father. I had been coming to the region for years; it was like I’d never seen that the (very fictional) story was just sitting here, waiting for someone to tell it. I knew what I had to do.\n\nAt the time, a friend in Ljubljana was moving to a bigger flat. He had offered to connect me with has landlord. At first I declined, telling him that I planned in remain in Brussels at least for the time being. Shortly after my return from Montenegro, I decided that I would take the plunge. I contacted him again. By December the newly minted Dr. Anžur Clement had moved to Ljubljana. So, thanks to that friend for presenting the opportunity that brought me to Slovenia, the country of my ancestors where Tito’s Lost Children was penned.\n\nThanks as always to my mom, who is my first-line beta reader. She is first to tell me if a draft has gone off into left field. With Tito’s Lost Children she not only did that, but she also proved quite useful to bounce ideas off of, drawing on her years of experience as a journalist, editor and her memories of reporting on the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. Indeed, the character of Mojca would not have been as rich and complex if it weren’t for her suggestions early on. Thanks to my Dad as well. You both have been incredibly supportive throughout the whole process of my moving to Slovenia to pursue my writing career.\n\nFor Tito’s Lost Children, I was also fortunate enough to find a superb copy editor and proofreader, when my old one proved unavailable. She always makes sure that I spell the names of the towns right, when writing in English about a place where I understand the language results in a sort of cognitive dissonance. She was nice enough to be okay with it, when I accidentally sent her an earlier version of book one. She whipped the manuscript right back into shape.\n\nAdditionally, thanks to my friends here in Slovenia, who proved largely supportive when I told them that I wanted to write an adventure story set during the breakup of Yugoslavia, even though I grew up a continent away. In many cases you were willing to share your own personal stories and even offered a few corrections when I got a detail or two wrong. You’re input doubtlessly improved the text. And, to my PhD supervisors who, in addition to putting up with me during my PhD, made me a good enough researcher to pull off writing these books, if I do say so myself. And, to one of my best friends from high school, who created a monster: you know what you did."
