But Tito died three days short of his 88th birthday. The trees still grow along the alley, since renamed to Josip Broz Street (that is minus \"Tito\"), but there are only 87 of them. One grew stunted and later a car crashed into it so it had to be replaced. The replant dried out.*\n.\nüì∏ November 2019\n.\n.\n.\n#kumrovec #croatia #croatiafulloflife #zagorje #redmaple #redmapletree #spomenploca #memorialplaque #spomenik #spomenikdatabase #exyu #exyugoslavia\n#formeryugoslavia #rememberingyugoslavia \n.\n* Story from a chapter by Marijeta Rajkoviƒá in the book \"O Titu Kao Mitu\" (2004)\".",
