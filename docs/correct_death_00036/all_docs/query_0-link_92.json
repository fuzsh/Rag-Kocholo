        "text": "Vladimir Dedijer was born on February 4. 1914. in Belgrade, where he spent his childhood and youth. He finished elementary school, high school and journalism, and was actively involved in the workers movement. He edited several newspapers in the country.\n\nAlthough not a member of any Communist Party or Communist Youth League, Dedijer worked in favor of communist propaganda. He knew the director of \"Politika\", Vladislav Ribnikar with whom he met Tito's arrival in Belgrade in 1941.\n\nAt the time of the rebellion he had to organize the political and propaganda work, to teach communists and work at the \"Struggle\" as an editor, along with Milovan Djilas. There, their great friendship started.\n\nVladimir Dedijer was appointed political commissar of the Kragujevac NOP Detachment. Participated in the siege of Kraljevo, in mid-October 1941, when he was wounded in the leg.\n\nAfter that, he went to the Supreme Headquarters and works in agitation and propaganda department of the war.\n\nAfter the war, he left to witness the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco. Upon his return, as a very educated man, he gets a place of history teaching NOB at Belgrade University. During the war, he carefully writes his diary, which he publishes after the war.\n\nHe was a representative of the Yugoslav delegation at the peace conference in Paris 1946. Upon his return, becomes the editor-in-chief of the \"Struggle\".\n\nDuring the conflict with Stalin, he was a member of various negotiating missions. There he began to collect data for his famous work, by which he would later become known - \"Contributions to the biography of Josip Broz Tito.\"\n\nHe was a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee since 1952, the Socialist Alliance and the federal committee since 1953. As editor of \"Struggle\", was accused of arranging Đilas's articles, and was brought before a party committee, then before the court in Belgrade in 1954. He was sentenced to a year and a half (suspended). Later, the court overturned that decision.\n\nDedijer then decided to retire from political life. He resigned his membership in the Communist Party and Socialist Alliance in August 1954.\n\nAfter his political career, he began to engage in writing. He went to the U.S. the 1955 where he won the title of professor of historical sciences. Occasionally he came from America to the country in which the research for his book was to be done.\n\nVladimir Dedijer became a member of the Russell Tribunal, and then the president of the same court that investigated war crimes in Vietnam, human rights violations in Latin America and many others.\n\nHe actively worked in the Serbian Academy of Sciences in Belgrade. He was one of the coauthors of the textbook \"History of Yugoslavia since 1918\", published by the Belgrade \"Nolit\" in 1972.\n\nAfter Tito's death, he went back to America, to Washington, where he collected materials for a biography of Tito.\n\nIn America, he worked on preparing the Russell Tribunal Court of the Jasenovac concentration camp. To this end, he returned again to Yugoslavia in 1989. and in conjunction with senior research associate Antun Miletic worked on writing a book about Jasenovac.\n\nTowards the end of his life he turned blind, and wanted to come back and die in his country, but died suddenly of a severe heart attack on the 30th of November 1990. in Boston, where he was cremated. His urn was, with all military honors, placed besides his two tragically departed sons in Ljubljana.\n\nAs a merit in working together, Antun Miletic (after Dedijer's death) published the book \"Against oblivion and taboo - Jasenovac (1941-1945), where in addition to his name, entered the name Vladimir Dedijer."
