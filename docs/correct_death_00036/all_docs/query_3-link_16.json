        "text": "Josip Broz was born to a Croat father and Slovene mother in May 7, 1892. He was a Yugoslav communist revolutionary and politician who served in national leadership from 1943 until his death.\n\nIn 1920, Tito joined the Communist Party of the newly established Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and by 1937 had assumed de facto control over the party. He was formally elected its general secretary in 1939 and later its president, the title he held until his death.\n\nDuring World War II, after the Nazi invasion of the area, he led the Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the Partisans (1941–1945).[5] By the end of the war, the Partisans – with backing of the Allies since mid-1943 – took power in Yugoslavia.\n\nTito was the only leader in Joseph Stalin’s lifetime to leave the Cominform, the co-ordination body of Marxist-Leninist communist parties in Europe during the early Cold War that was formed in part as a replacement of the Communist International. He established Yugoslavia as an idiosyncratic model of socialist self-management in which firms were managed through workers’ councils and all workers were entitled to an equal share of profits.\n\nWhile autocratic, Tito supported a decentralized federation to keep ethnic tensions under control. A very powerful cult of personality was built around Tito, which was maintained even after his death on this day in history. Tito made strides in reducing illiteracy, expanded the average Yugoslavian’s access to consumer goods, permitted Yugoslav workers to go to western Europe as guest workers, and opened its borders to foreign visitors. But not everyone agrees that the Tito years were a halcyon period of human rights or reconciliation among ethic groups.\n\nFor example, Topics of Meta reports:\n\nWashington Post foreign correspondent Dusko Doder, who emigrated to the U.S. from Yugoslavia in 1956, suggested that Yugoslavians — Croats and Serbs alike — fought off the Nazis, but they also spent most of the war killing each other. Although some 1,700,000 Yugoslavs died in the war, only about 300,000 were killed by Germans. The rest were victims of fratricidal warfare – among Tito’s Partisans, Draza Mihailovic’s Chetniks, Croatian fascists and others’.”\n\nEthnic tensions escalated after Tito’s death, especially when, twelve years later, communism collapsed in Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia dissolved. Misha Glenny, in The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804-1999, (New York: Penguin, 1999), at p. 574 contends that Tito frequently pitted one ethnicity against another in an attempt to neutralize one or both of them, feeding ethnocentrism. Furthermore, in an effort to dilute Serbian political power, Tito took parts of Serbia and added them to Croatia and Bosnia. He also declared Kosovo an autonomous province despite its centrality to Serbian life, historically and religiously. Later on, former president of Serbia Slobodan Milošević built his nationalist appeal on the return of these regions. (Milošević was the president of Serbia from 1989 to 1997 and president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1997 to 2000. He led the Socialist Party of Serbia from its foundation in 1990 until his death in 2006.)\n\nTito became increasingly ill throughout 1979 with circulation problems and died on this day in history, three days short of his 88th birthday. His funeral attracted government leaders from 129 states. A 2010 poll found that as many as 81% of Serbs believe that life was better under Tito. Tito also ranked first in the “Greatest Croatian” poll which was conducted in 2003 by the Croatian weekly news magazine Nacional."
