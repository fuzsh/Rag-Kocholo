        "text": "Josip Broz Tito devoted his life to keeping Yugoslavia together. Now his countrymen are battling for secession _ and some of Tito's old limousines. The automobiles are part of the collection of villas, rail cars and exotic animals amassed by the former communist ruler, who balanced Yugoslavia between the Soviet bloc and the West for 35 years until his death in 1980.\n\nBut the quests for independence by the republics of Slovenia and Croatia have set off quarrels over the trappings of Tito's power.\n\n\"In Yugoslavia at the moment, symbolic things have a high value,\" said Marjan Vidmar, director of the Bistra Technical Museum near the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana.\n\nThe museum is refusing to return to Belgrade 16 of Tito's cars it restored and displayed for eight years. The cars, including a 1952 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith convertible valued at $1-million, came from Belgrade's military museum and the Tito Memorial Center.\n\n\"We have restored or repaired all of these cars when the authorities in Belgrade didn't care enough about them. Now they want them back,\" Vidmar said.\n\nTito also kept hunting lodges, seaside retreats and villas in all six Yugoslav republics. The property and cars _ now under republican control _ together are estimated to be worth millions of dollars.\n\nThe federal government, strapped for cash, has proposed selling off to Western railroad companies the so-called \"Blue Train\" Tito used to travel through Yugoslavia. But some likely would oppose any such plan.\n\n\"The memory of Tito is sacred to many people in Belgrade,\" Vidmar said. \"The army particularly still lives in the communist era.\""
