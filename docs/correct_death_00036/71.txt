44 years ago today, Josip Broz Tito, the lifelong president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, died in Ljubljana. Josip Broz Tito was undoubtedly one of the most striking figures of the 20th century, not only in the Balkans but also throughout the countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain. Tito was a leader in the struggle against the occupier from 1941 to 1945.

He was the longtime leader of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and commander of its armed forces from the end of World War II until his death in 1980.

He was one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement, which united countries from several continents that did not belong to either of the two dominant blocs at the time, the Western and Eastern blocs â€“ NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

Opinions about his role and work are conflicting - for some Tito is a symbol of social justice, a better and more secure life, a great foreign policy reputation, and for others - a dictator with enormous political power who reckoned with political dissidents.

Josip Broz Tito died on May 4, 1980 at the Clinical Center in Ljubljana. He was buried on Dedinje in Belgrade in the House of Flowers.

The funeral was attended by more than 200 statesmen and prominent people from all over the world.

Although 44 years have passed since Tito's death, a large number of citizens from the republics of the former SFRY still visit his grave. More than 20 million people have visited the House of Flowers so far
