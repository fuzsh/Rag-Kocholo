The announcement of his death on Radio Belgrade

at first you hear a commentary of a football match between Hajduk and Crvena zvezda, then a male voice interrupts, saying “and now for some music from our studio”, upon which we hear the first bars of The Internationale played at a very slow tempo. A female voice than says.

Male voice:

Central Committee of League of Communists of Yugoslavia and Presidency of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have issued a statement at 18.00 hours. The statement reads: To the working class, to the working people and citizens, to the nations of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Comrade Tito has died.

And this is how his funeral looked like:

Despite Tito’s controversial role (or precisely because of it) his death was mourned all over the world. It also meant a start of the true dissolution of Yugoslavia – and some people are liable to see his death in Ljubljana as a sign of things that were to follow and start precisely in Slovenia.

In any event, it was an end of an era…. And a start of a new, much more turbulent one…
