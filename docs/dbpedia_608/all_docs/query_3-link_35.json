        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nInformation technologies possess a crucial part of a business infrastructure and are a stimulus for the way modern society operates on a daily basis. It is important to keep a focus on their continuous development since it impacts the economic environment and is a part of the factors which influence business wealth and competitiveness [1]. The pace of technological development is unprecedented. The growing number of people connected to the internet and the increasing use of internet services such as email, social media, instant messaging, and cloud computing have led to a significant change in the way we communicate. This transformation has taken place across virtually all sectors, both private and public. There has been a fundamental shift in the way companies communicate with consumers, moving away from the traditional one-way promotional approaches found in traditional marketing copy. Instead, a two-way communication paradigm has emerged, with its own advantages and disadvantages. In an interconnected world, a company’s ability to cultivate trust and relationships is of unprecedented importance. Communication through new technologies brings new ways of interacting with customers [2]. As a result, social media has connected different users around this content and enabled customers to share their impressions and perceptions of the products and brands [3]. In an open and constantly developing environment, effective marketing communication is crucial and serves as a critical tool to achieve the organization’s goals. The research shows that just over 90% of US companies currently use and plan to use social media for marketing purposes. In 2017, social messaging and video were seen as emerging trends in social media advertising that are expected to have a significant impact on marketing strategies. As a result, investment in social video advertising has grown steadily and is expected to reach nearly $15 billion by 2021. It is worth noting that Facebook is becoming a major platform in this space, particularly in influencer marketing. As influencer marketing campaigns using Instagrammers and YouTubers become more prevalent, there is a growing body of research and knowledge about the phenomenon. The concept of online influencers is becoming more defined and analyzed as their influence on marketing strategies continues to evolve. Influencers at all levels, from micro-influencers to celebrities, predominantly share their videos on Facebook. The second most popular video-sharing platform is YouTube, despite being the quintessence of video sharing, it is relatively less popular with influencers, probably due to a more limited user reach. By 2022, this amount will reach $66 billion and include paid advertising on social networks as well as games and apps on social networks. By 2025, advertisers are expected to spend more than $82 billion to promote their products on social networks [4]. Therefore, the main objective of this chapter is to formulate an updated model of marketing communication adapted to social networks.\n\nFrom basic concepts to actionable strategies, this introduction sets the stage for exploring key aspects of social media marketing.\n\nSocial media as a marketing tool section highlights the key role of social media in modern marketing and emphasizes its importance as a communication channel for brands. Social Media Marketing Fundamentals section explores the evolution of social media platforms and their profound impact on current marketing practices. Social Media Marketing Strategy covers strategic planning, goal setting, and audience segmentation.\n\nCreating a social media strategy section covers practical insights into strategy development, including content planning, audience engagement, and performance measurement [5]. Content creation and curation section focuses on creating and curating compelling content tailored to target audiences. Content Curation Tools highlight content curation tools that simplify the sharing process and improve content discovery. Building Engaged Communities brings strategies for fostering authentic connections and cultivating engaged online communities around brands. Social Advertising and Influencer Marketing section concludes with an introduction to social advertising and influencer marketing as an integral part of modern social media branding [6, 7].\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Literature review and definition of basic terms\n\nTo understand accurately the possibilities that social networks are offering to marketing communication, first, it is necessary to state definitions of key terms. In the literature on the topic of social media, there can be different terms found such as social media, social network, social web, social network site, social networking, etc. These terms can be used in different concepts which is the root cause of inconsistent definitions among different authors [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. According to the literature review, the basic definitions can be elaborated below:\n\nSocial media can be defined as a means of sharing information in the form of text, image, sound, or video [13].\n\nSocial network sites can be defined as “web-based services that allow individuals to construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system. The nature and nomenclature of these connections may vary from site to site” [14].\n\nSocial media sites are defined to open a new environment of conversation-based marketing communication, creating opportunities for entirely different forms of nearly instantaneous customer connections [15].\n\nSocial networks are a platform where people of various professions and interests are intersected [16].\n\nSocial networks are applications that enable users to build personal websites available also to other social network users with the aim of exchanging personal content and promoting communication [1].\n\nSocial media sites create a new environment full of opportunities to create conversation-based marketing communication with customers and to create immediate customer connections [15, 17]. To this, the perception of social media by academics and marketing managers operating business-related activities may differ. This is mainly because the scope of social media is understood to be very dynamic which is directly related to the rapidly evolving progress in technology. As a result, there are new opportunities brought to the users, which create new areas for development on the one hand and on the other hand reflect rapid obsolescence of some ideas, views, and definitions. Having said the above, it can be stated that drafting appropriate definitions can be challenging as the viewpoints of the authors may be influenced [13].\n\nWithin the general definitions, there are various social media that would need to be characterized further, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and many more. However, there is no known systematic approach in which various social networks could be characterized especially as there are newly created ones in the cyberspace on a daily basis. To enable some kind of classification scheme in a systematic manner, a set of theories in the field of social media is taken into account. According to Kaplan and Haenlein [18], social media can be categorized into two-factor matrix, media richness concept, and self-disclosure concept. The social presence theory [19] describes the media-related component of social media by declaring that media differ in the degree of social presence. This may be acoustic, visual, or physical contact which can be carried between two communication partners. The impact is expected to be lower for mediated (for example, telephone conversation) and higher for interpersonal (for example, face-to-face conversation) communication and similarly asynchronous (for example, email) than synchronous (for example, online chat) communications. The basic rule is simple, the higher the social presence, the larger the social influence. Regarding the second aspect of social media, self-presentation states that people tend to have an aspiration to control the impressions other people form of them, so they naturally tend to present themselves in a way to gain rewards or positive impressions. Typically, this kind of self-presentation is performed by conscious or unconscious revelation of personal data which should be in line with the image one would like to create. In this context, social networking sites allow self-disclosure and, in terms of richness, provide an opportunity to share audio-visual content in addition to the text-based communication. An effective social media implementation as a tool for enhancing marketing communication requires a degree of planning, collaboration, and coordination (Table 1).\n\nSocial presence/media richnessLowMediumHighSelf-presentation/self-disclosureHighBlogsSocial networking sites\n\n(e.g., Facebook)Virtual social worlds\n\n(e.g., Second Life)LowCollaborative projects\n\n(e.g., Wikipedia)Content Communities\n\n(e.g., YouTube)Virtual game words\n\n(e.g., World of Warcraft)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Social media as a tool for marketing communication\n\nSocial media is a new paradigm that is very dynamic and fast-moving. In other words, what is up to date today could be outdated tomorrow and, therefore, naturally vanish from the virtual space. Due to that, it is crucial for companies to very carefully select a set of rules or guidelines which should be used in the virtual space to promote effective marketing communication. There is a set of recommendations that can be considered when a company decides to use social network sites for marketing communication which include:\n\nA wise choice of social media application—there are numerous social network sites, and it is just not feasible to use all of them especially as the user’s activity is the key parameter for success. To ensure effective marketing communication, it is vital to understand the target group and the message that is to be communicated which are crucial determinants for a correct choice of the social network site.\n\nPick an application or create your own—in certain situations, it may be best to join an existing network especially as there are positive externalities in terms of existing audience of social network users who may be attracted by the marketing communication. On the other hand, in some situations, it may be better to create your own network to build a specific community which may be, for instance, applicable to photo enthusiasts.\n\nEnsure alignment of activity across different media—in case the company decides to use more applications or sites, the target shall be to unify the activities across them. For example, on sites like Facebook or Instagram, a company can share pictures of newly released products and on YouTube, content related to the audio-visual presentation can be published to ensure communication of the same message through various media.\n\nMedia plan integration—it is important for a company to create a corporate image which needs to be aligned between traditional media and social one. Even though the marketing department may distinguish them, in customer’s eyes, both are part of the brand image.\n\nAccessibility for anyone—one could take this as a straightforward principle but still it is a key one to consider mainly due to the fact that employees can be an essential part of creating the brand image and should have the possibility to identify themselves as a part of the company’s social media website.\n\nBeing active—in general, social networks are about the interaction between users and about the engagement in a discussion with customers. If a company wishes to promote marketing communication by this means, then there is a need to go beyond and strive for a desire to engage participants into becoming producers and consumers of the content, so-called “prosumers” [20].\n\nBeing interesting—the important part is to understand what the interests of the audience are, what they find valuable, interesting, or debatable so it can engage with the company, and provide some insights or ideas for improvements.\n\nBeing humble—prior to joining a social platform, one should first take a moment to better understand the basic rules and to discover them.\n\nBeing unprofessional—it may not always be the best choice to invest in creating professional online contact while investing in a perfect brand presentation. Sometimes, it may be a better choice to be human and show a realistic side as well.\n\nBeing honest—honesty is the basic brick for building a marketing communication strategy. It is pointless to try to mask the truth because it is highly probable that the truth will become known one day to the wider audience, and the company’s reputation could be harmed.\n\nThe trajectory of social media platforms represents a compelling evolution that is emblematic of the dynamic transformation of digital marketing and consumer behavior. Founded in 2003 with a primary focus on professional networking and job searching, LinkedIn has quickly evolved into a huge B2B marketing and personal branding platform. Facebook, which was launched in 2004 mainly with the purpose of personal networking, has transformed into a crucial tool to be applied by the marketing strategy of businesses. The introduction of Facebook pages and advertisements transformed the way targeted marketing and ads are executed and cemented its position in social media marketing. X (before Twitter), founded in 2006, introduced real-time, concise communication and quickly became the preferred platform for brands. YouTube, founded in 2005, has become a powerful video marketing tool used by brands for product demos, tutorials, and sponsored content opportunities with influencers. Instagram, which started in 2010 as a photo-sharing platform, has transformed into a hub for visual storytelling, attracting lifestyle and e-commerce brands with tools like Instagram Ads and Stories. Pinterest, launched in 2010, has revolutionized visual discovery, especially for e-commerce brands, and offers tools like Pinterest Ads and Buyable Pins. Snapchat, which introduced Stories in 2013, changed the face of ephemeral content and allowed brands to share behind-the-scenes content and exclusive offers. TikTok, which has been disrupting the landscape with short video content since 2016, quickly gained the attention of a younger audience [21].\n\n3.1 Foundations of social media marketing\n\nIn the constantly evolving landscape of contemporary marketing, social media has become a key force that is changing the way businesses connect with their audiences. Gone are the days when marketing was one-way. Today, it is a dynamic, interactive digital dialog, and social media serves as a connecting link in this profound transformation. Social platforms have shifted from merely communication tools to integral parts of complex marketing strategies. The evolution of marketing paradigms has seen a seismic shift driven by social media innovation. Traditional approaches that used to rely on conventional advertising channels have given way to strategies that leverage the immediacy, connection, and democratization of information offered by social platforms. The integration of social media into marketing frameworks has become not only an option but also a necessity for brands that aim to remain relevant and competitive in an increasingly digital world. This paradigm shift is being expertly articulated by thought leaders and industry experts [22]. Guy Kawasaki and Peg Fitzpatrick assert in their book, The Art of social media [23], that social platforms are no longer marginal, but an integral part of a brand’s communications strategy. They stress that businesses have to accept the interactive nature of social media in order to thrive in today’s marketing environment. Jonah Berger, a renowned marketing professor at the Wharton School, discusses the dynamics of why certain content goes viral in his book “Contagious: How to Build Word of Mouth in the Digital Age.” Berger’s insights highlight the influential role of social media in framing brand narratives and the psychology behind content sharing. Gary Vaynerchuk, an influential entrepreneur and marketing expert, advocates a customer-centric approach in his book “The Thank You Economy.” Vaynerchuk emphasizes the significance of social media in creating authentic relationships with customers, thereby contributing to a shifting paradigm in the way brands communicate.\n\nBrand visibility has taken a huge shift with the advent of social media. Although still relevant, traditional methods of brand promotion now coexist with a dynamic, interconnected digital environment. Social platforms offer unparalleled reach and immediacy. Brands can use these platforms not only to broadcast their messages but also to engage in purposeful discussions with their audiences. This two-way communication increases brand visibility by fostering authentic connection and creating a digital presence that goes far beyond conventional marketing channels [24]. Social platforms have become catalysts for changing market momentum and have brought a level of agility and responsiveness that is unequaled to date. The interlinked nature of these platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information, consumer trends, and sentiment. Market dynamics are no longer dictated solely by top-down marketing strategies but are co-created through dynamic interactions on social networks. The real-time nature of these online platforms allows businesses to adapt quickly to changing market conditions, promoting an environment in which innovation and responsiveness become key success factors [25].\n\n3.2 Social media marketing strategy\n\nIn the last decades, we can perceive a significant shift in people’s social connections which is a result of the increased popularity of social media apps and mobile internet platforms. Due to that, social media marketing became an important pillar in the marketing strategy of a company. Thus, having a proper understanding of the meaning, varieties, and methods of social media marketing strategy became crucial for a company’s success [26].\n\nBased on the Global Social Media Statistics 2023, the average time a social media user spends daily browsing social media networks is 2 hours and 31 minutes with the number of social media users reaching 4.76 billion. The year-on-year average of the time social media users spend in the online space has increased by 2 percentage points or by 3 minutes. Having said that, it is critical for a company to have a social media marketing strategy in order to maintain the focus on bringing and acquiring new customers through campaigns and advertisements on social media networks [26].\n\nOne of the most common marketing strategies has its roots in the studies of a professor of advertising at Harvard University, Neil Borden, who promoted the marketing mix concept in the 1950s, later known as the “4Ps,” which consists of product, price, place, and promotion [27]. Borden [28] further defines the elements as below:\n\nProduct planning is key in terms of policies and procedures related to product lines to be offered, target market (including answering the questions who, when, where, and in what quantities), and new product policy focusing on research and development.\n\nPrice includes policies and procedures relating to price level to be adopted, pricing policy of, for example, one price or varying price level, and relating to that, a margin level to be adopted.\n\nPlace is the consideration of where the products and services should be available, in physical stores or in the online space and how they should be displayed but also choosing the right channels of distribution.\n\nPromotions include policies and guidelines relating to burden which is applied on specific selling plans or devices directed at or throughout the trade and form of these devices for customer promotion and trade promotion [28].\n\nMoving from the traditional marketing strategies, there are also more modern strategies which can be used in social media platforms, and which reflect the evolving customer needs. One of them is experiential marketing strategy which simply relates to the experience consumers have when consuming goods and services. According to Abadi et al. [29], experiential modules describe five types of customer experiences that form the basis of experiential marketing strategy, namely Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate. This strategy contradicts with many others that assume that the customer is logical or rational and believes that the consumer is not only logical but also emotional before, during, and after the purchasing experience. Emotional or sensory experiences have direct positive impact on customer satisfaction and on customer loyalty (Figure 1) [27].\n\nNowadays, customers do not always focus on quantity, quality, or price but sometimes also look for added value to satisfy emotional needs and look for psychological identification. On the other hand, the company’s communication on social networks could be interpreted as a deep, long-term connection with the customer. It can be seen as a means for enterprises to advertise the brand, to promote, and to strengthen the brand image. Unlike the traditional social marketing strategies, the emotional marketing emphasizes the interaction between customer experiences and memories and the posts or stories of the brand which should serve as a stimulus for customer to buy. Emotional marketing can bring a special kind of customer satisfaction and trust [30].\n\nAnother common marketing strategy in social network sites is so-called “hunger marketing.” In order to use hunger marketing effectively, there is a need to build a solid base of satisfied consumers to be able to have a psychological foundation for marketing. The strategy is a kind of combination of supply restrictions and low-price control. In the online platforms, the company relies on creating a thrilling atmosphere and artificial phenomenon to simulate a shortage of supply which has three stages, namely early warm-up, middle empathy, and late feedback. For e-commerce retailers, these have several advantages including control of retail price, and total sales volumes thus having also a control of the total profit and having a direct effect on marginalization [31]. In other words, a large amount of advertising creates a stimulus for consumers’ eagerness to buy and with applying further waiting the customer’s desire to buy is greater which eventually helps the company to increase product prices. Apart from that, the long-term effect of hunger strategy is an added value for the brand and a high value of the brand image. It is crucial to understand the market competition, consumer maturity, and product substitution for a successful implementation of the strategy. Absence of such understanding can lead to customer loss and diminished company reputation (Figure 2) [27].\n\nOne of the widely used strategies to promote a product is using celebrities to endorse the product. These endorsements usually come through social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc. Since celebrities have a wide audience, they can attract a large number of customers and thus have a high social value. Celebrity influences can therefore easily acquire customer attention and have the potential to reach bigger audience than other advertising methods. This can represent an added value for building brand awareness and credibility. In today’s world, it is a common practice that companies approach many followers and many times this includes celebrities going live on their social media platforms which helps to build a positive brand image [32].\n\nAccording to Kim and Ko [13], social media can have a dramatic impact on brand’s reputation and companies that do not engage in social media as a part of their marketing strategy are losing the opportunity to reach out to the potential customers. Furthermore, on social media, there is a high probability of sharing the information among other users, so the value of customer is more than what is the initial spending or purchase. Therefore, companies need to be aware of the value of customers and the influence of social media on them [33]. As a result, social media strategy should include the activities in five dimensions and these are trendiness, entertainment, interaction, word of mouth, and customization. The degree of how contemporary and up-to-date the content of a company’s online platform is and how new information are is referred to as the trendiness dimension. Social media marketing activities include fun and joy of using the social media and entertainment is a key component that encourages participation and stimulates continuity of the follow-up events. The third dimension called interaction simply defines the contribution customers make to brands on social media platforms to interactively communicate between customer and brand, to collect the needs, opinions, and suggestions in a real time. The informal communication between users can also be called word of mouth and defines how much a customer is willing to talk about a brand or to share information with other users. The last dimension is customization and refers to the information customer can retrieve from social media platforms with the aim to create customer satisfaction based on communication between individual user and company. This may result in a customer feeling heard and thus also unique which can be an advantage compared to competitors [34].\n\n3.3 Developing a social media strategy\n\nDeveloping a robust social media strategy is a cornerstone for businesses looking to thrive in the connected world of online engagement in the dynamic digital marketing environment. Illuminated by influential authors in the field, including Guy Kawasaki, Peg Fitzpatrick, Jonah Berger, Gary Vaynerchuk, Neil Patel, Anne Handley, and Rand Fishkin, this chapter sets out on a journey to unravel the complexities of creating an effective social media strategy. Together, these thought leaders stress the strategic alignment of social media efforts with broader business objectives, the primary importance of understanding and engaging target audiences, and the need for measurable goals that go beyond mere performance metrics. We address platform selection, cultivating brand voice, and the delicate balance between organic and paid strategies. Combining the insights of these experts, the aim of this section is to guide businesses as they negotiate the ever-evolving social media environment and deliver a roadmap for the strategic development of campaigns that have a response, engage, and have a real impact on the business.\n\nWe will embark on a journey to create a comprehensive social media strategy based on dedicated websites that are specifically for digital marketing along with the contributors’ expertise in the field.\n\nAligning with business objectives—starting by aligning social media strategy with core business objectives. In The Art of social media, Guy Kawasaki and Peg Fitzpatrick stress the importance of seamlessly integrating social media efforts with broader organizational goals.\n\nIdentifying target audiences—penetrate the complexities of understanding and defining the target group. Jonah Berger, known for his work “Contagious: How to Build Word of Mouth in the Digital Age,” stresses the importance of tailoring content to closely resonate with the motivations and behaviors of your specific audience.\n\nSetting measurable goals and objectives—set specific, measurable, and time-bound goals for your social media initiatives. The importance of goals is directly related to achieving business results.\n\nChoosing the right platforms—specialist advice goes beyond general advice and provides detailed and platform-specific tailor-made strategies for different industries and audience segments. Such an approach recognizes that a successful social media strategy requires careful attention to the characteristics, demographics, and interaction patterns present on each platform. For instance, an examination of Instagram’s visual glamor suggests its suitability for brands in more visually oriented industries such as fashion, beauty, or gastronomy. Alternatively, it may underscore the potential of LinkedIn’s professional networks for B2B businesses, or the real-time conversation dynamics of Twitter for instant engagement [31].\n\nCrafting a unique brand voice and message—a resonating brand voice goes far beyond the choice of words but encompasses the overall communication strategy. It involves telling a convincing brand story, addressing the pains and desires of the audience, and showcasing solutions in a way that resonates. Highlighted in various industry publications and content creation guides, this kind of approach ensures that brand messaging is not only memorable but also smoothly aligned with the needs and preferences of the audience [26].\n\nContent planning and calendar development—a content calendar is a documented timetable that indicates the anticipated schedule for publishing upcoming content. Content calendars, which typically cover a spectrum of elements such as forthcoming articles, status updates, planned promotional initiatives, collaborative partnerships, and revisions to existing content, serve as a comprehensive organizational tool for strategic content planning and distribution.\n\nEngagement and community building strategies—the point of engagement is not just to get likes or comments, but to create meaningful social interactions that resonate with the audience. Fishkin’s insights explore the dynamics of community engagement and emphasize its deep impact on brand loyalty. In an era where consumers are seeking genuine connections with brands, fostering a vibrant community is becoming a powerful tool for supporting lasting relationships and improving overall brand perception. Beyond the transactional aspects of business, the community engagement strategies Fishkin discusses often pivot around creating spaces where customers feel heard, valued, and connected. This extends beyond answering questions to actively searching for and engaging customer feedback, valuing their contributions, and fostering a shared sense of belonging [35].\n\nIntegrating paid and organic strategies—Rand Fishkin highlights the importance of balancing organic and paid strategies for a comprehensive social media presence in digital marketing. He dismisses a binary perspective and asserts a symbiotic relationship in which genuine audience engagement from organic activities synergistically complements the targeted reach of paid campaigns. Fishkin stresses that the two strategies serve distinct but interrelated purposes, organic efforts build authentic relationships, while paid strategies strengthen visibility and marketing objectives. The key conclusion drawn is the need for strategic integration that leverages the strengths of both approaches to achieve a resilient and adaptable social media presence in an ever-evolving digital environment [36].\n\nMeasuring and analyzing performance—performance measurement and analysis are crucial aspects of a successful social media strategy. By implementing reliable metrics and analytics, businesses can gather valuable insights into the effectiveness of their digital activities. Grasping key performance indicators (KPIs) enables informed decision-making and keeps strategies aligned with overarching goals. The data collected enable continuous optimization and improvement, whether it is tracking engagement rates, conversion rates, or audience demographics. In essence, the capability to gauge and benchmark performance allows businesses to adapt, evolve, and react in an ever-changing digital environment [37].\n\nTo conclude our examination of the evolution of social media strategy, it is important to stress that adaptability and responsiveness are extremely important in this dynamic environment. The most significant aspect stems from the realization that a successful strategy is not static, but evolves in response to changing trends, algorithms, and audience behavior. Being able to measure and analyze performance is fundamental to strategy refinement. However, caution is necessary to avoid the traps of complacency and over-reliance on specific platforms. While each platform has its merits, businesses must resist the temptation of a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, follow Neil Patel and Rand Fishkin’s advice and selectively choose platforms that are in line with your audience and goals. At its core, a successful social media strategy combines strategic forward-looking with adaptability, using data-driven insights to remain agile and responsive. As we navigate this many-faceted territory, true craftsmanship lies in finding a balance between consistency and evolution, ensuring lasting impact in the ever-evolving social media sphere.\n\n3.4 Content creation and curation\n\nShared content can be divided into two basic categories: curated content, which comes from reputable and relevant sources within the industry, and created content, which the organization creates itself. Typically, organizations take a hybrid approach to social media content marketing, which includes a mix of both curated and created content. Although the optimal ratio can vary by sector and depending on the specific dynamics of the organization, general guidance suggests a split of 40% created content and 60% curated content. This proportion can be adjusted based on audience reactions and engagement patterns. Created content includes a variety of formats such as blog articles, white papers, infographics, guides, and visuals sourced from within the organization. Also included in this category are the text components of social media messages. However, even in cases where a dedicated team is dedicated to creating branded social content, it is recommended that the social media team creates content tailored to specific channels, such as Facebook Live sessions, Instagram visuals, Snapchat Stories, and Tweets [38].\n\nContent curation is the strategic discovery, organization, and sharing of valuable material from external sources to engage and build trust with the audience. It is not about copying; it is about adding a unique perspective or commentary. This practice is a time-saving way to build authority and enrich the content narrative. On the other hand, content creation is the process of creating unique material for the platform that showcases expertise and attracts potential customers. It involves more than just writing or uploading, it involves planning, research, editing, and optimization. Curating and content creation are not mutually exclusive, but complementary. Content curation can enrich our own material, fill gaps in our calendar, and spark new ideas. At the same time, content creation adds depth, originality, and personality to curated content, responding to specific audience needs. The ideal balance depends on our goals, resources, and audience preferences to curate content effectively, start by selecting sources that fit your niche, audience, and tone, with an emphasis on relevance and credibility. Leverage tools and platforms including RSS feeds, newsletters, social media, or content curation platforms to efficiently find, filter, and organize content. Add your own voice or opinion to curated content, rather than sharing it verbatim. Ensure proper attribution to the author and link to the original source while respecting copyright and fair use principles. Finally, measure the performance and impact of curated content and use metrics as needed to refine our strategy [39].\n\nCreating effective content involves using a differentiated approach that resonates with the target audience and achieves our strategic goals. Start this process with a comprehensive understanding of our audience—recognizing their interests, needs, and challenges. Accurately articulate the goals of our content, whether it is to disseminate information, entertain, or promote specific activities. Emphasize quality over quantity to ensure that our content is of substantial value. Diversify our content formats, delving into articles, videos, infographics, and podcasts to cater to different preferences. Master the art of storytelling to engage our audience and make our content memorable. Conduct thorough keyword research to optimize SEO, maintain a consistent brand voice, and utilize visuals to increase overall appeal. Encourage audience engagement and regularly evaluate and adapt based on insights gained from analytics data [40].\n\n3.4.1 Content curation tools\n\nThere are numerous scopes of content curation tools, platforms, and services that could be used to curate a digital or online content. These tools differ in various ways, for example, in the source from which the dataset is extracted, what platforms are permitted for sharing, and also what audience has access to it.\n\nFeedly is a powerful content curation tool that aggregates articles and news from a variety of sources, providing users with a centralized platform to stay informed about industry trends and topics of interest [41].\n\nHootsuite is a valuable tool for monitoring and managing multiple social media platforms. Its features allow users to track audience reactions and discussions related to their brand or relevant topics. In addition, Hootsuite provides visibility across multiple networks such as Facebook, X/Twitter, and Google, allowing users to respond quickly by posting updates [42].\n\nFlipboard is a visually engaging content curation platform that transforms articles, images, and social media into a personalized magazine-style layout. It makes it easy to discover and curate content with an esthetically pleasing interface [43].\n\nPocket is a user-friendly content curation tool that allows individuals to save, organize, and later return to articles, videos, and websites. It simplifies the process of curating valuable content for personal or professional use [44, 45].\n\nEvernote is a well-known online note-taking application, alongside Google Keep and Microsoft’s OneNote. Users can use a variety of advanced tools to manage notes according to their preferences [46].\n\nPocket Casts is a content curation tool focused on podcasts. It allows users to discover, curate, and listen to podcasts of different genres, offering a streamlined experience for podcast enthusiasts [47].\n\nDiigo serves as a reliable tool for capturing, storing, recalling, and sharing information. Key features include storing important web URLs, categorizing pages by title, notes, tags, lists, and groups, and quickly searching for information via bookmarks. Other features include storing snapshots of web pages for historical tracking, annotating pages with highlights or virtual annotations, and displaying annotations created by other users [48].\n\nContent creation and curation are essential parts of a successful digital strategy. Content creation allows organizations to showcase expertise, build brand identity, and connect with audiences through original, tailored materials. In turn, content curation rounds out these efforts by offering different perspectives, populating content calendars, and inspiring new ideas. The ideal approach entails a harmonious balance between creating unique, high-quality content and curating valuable insights from reputable sources. Leveraging the right tools, understanding audience preferences, and adapting strategies based on performance analysis are key elements in navigating the dynamic environment of content creation and curation to achieve lasting impact and relevance.\n\n3.5 Building and engaging communities with brands\n\nIn the last decade, consumer engagement has gained considerable attention in the field of consumer behavior research [48]. Recent research suggests a shift in brand relationships toward a broader relational orientation and highlights the importance of fostering interactive consumer-brand relationships [49]. Within this emerging stream of research, which includes other relational concepts such as brand relationship quality, brand commitment, and brand love, consumer engagement has achieved tremendous momentum as it reflects consumers’ dynamic relationships with the brand. In recent years, the conceptualization and depersonalization of consumer engagement have become central topics of discussion [50].\n\nCommunity building is about fostering a sense of connection and belonging among people who share common interests or goals. In the context of business and marketing, community building involves actively engaging with an audience to create a dedicated community that is focused on our brand, product, or service. Through the cultivation of such a community, we build a loyal following that is an advocate for our brand and actively promotes it to others. In addition, by harnessing the power of word-of-mouth marketing facilitated by engaged community members, community building serves as a key strategy for expanding our audience. We can effectively extend our reach and attract new customers or followers as they share our content, promote our offers, and invite others to join the community [51].\n\nCreating a community around our brand or product is an effective strategy to increase engagement, build trust, and ultimately grow our business. Starting this process requires careful consideration and implementation of well-defined strategies [52].\n\nIdentifying target audience—the foundational step involves a thorough understanding of the target audience’s characteristics and interests. This insight informs content creation and messaging for heightened resonance and increased engagement.\n\nSelecting appropriate platforms—various platforms, including social media, forums, or email lists, serve as potential spaces for community building. The choice should align with audience preferences and the brand’s overarching goals and values.\n\nDelivering value—community retention hinges on the provision of tangible value, be it through informative content, exclusive offers, or avenues for connection among like-minded individuals.\n\nEncouraging engagement—active engagement is fostered through initiatives like posing questions, soliciting feedback, and promptly responding to comments and messages within the community.\n\nConsistency as a key element—successfully building a community necessitates a sustained commitment to consistently delivering value and actively engaging with the audience over an extended period.\n\nHarnessing user-generated content—empowering community members to create and share content related to the brand or product enhances the communal bond and offers social validation for the brand.\n\nFacilitating offline engagement opportunities—beyond the digital realm, organizing events or meetups provides an opportunity for community members to connect in person, fostering deeper relationships and loyalty.\n\nExamples of smart community building span a variety of brands and industries and illuminate a spectrum of engagement strategies. Through in-depth analysis of these cases, we explore the multifaceted dimensions of successful community building and offer insights and frameworks applicable across industries.\n\nCosmetics brand Glossier has adopted a community-building approach that focuses on inclusivity and authenticity. By actively engaging with customers, including soliciting feedback and featuring user-generated content on social media platforms, Glossier has successfully cultivated a strong community. Glossier ensures that community members feel recognized and valued. In addition, the brand organizes offline events including pop-up shops and workshops to deepen community engagement [53].\n\nApproach to community building: Patagonia, a major outdoor apparel and equipment company, has created a community focused on environmental sustainability and social responsibility. By supporting environmental goals and encouraging community involvement in activism, Patagonia has created an engaged community that identifies with the brand’s values and actively supports its mission [54].\n\nCommunity building approach: Peloton, an interactive fitness platform, has created a community that is united by shared fitness goals and the virtual experience of group workouts. Through live and on-demand classes that facilitate member interaction and competition, Peloton cultivates a sense of camaraderie and mutual accountability in its community [55].\n\nCommunity Building Approach: Twitch, a major live streaming platform for gamers and content creators, strategically fosters communities of people with shared interests and hobbies. This is made possible by interactive features such as online chat and subscriptions; the platform encourages active participation from community members and facilitates networking between like-minded individuals. Unlike pre-recorded content, live streaming on Twitch presents special integration opportunities and challenges. Streamers are faced with the challenge of maintaining viewer engagement throughout an unabridged broadcast, leveraging technical capabilities such as webcams and dedicated chat monitors. A unique feature of Twitch allows for monetary contributions from viewers in real time, underscoring the platform’s emphasis on immediate and interactive audience engagement [56].\n\nThese cases illustrate successful community-building strategies used by Glossier, Patagonia, Peloton, and Twitch and offer academic insights into different methodologies for fostering engaged and loyal communities.\n\n3.6 Social advertising and influencer marketing\n\nThe use of opinion leaders to influence consumer decision-making is a well-known concept [57]. Opinion leaders, as defined by Godey et al. [58], are individuals who have a significant influence on consumer attitudes and behaviors. This influence is based on factors such as elevated status, social prestige, personal attractiveness, or expertise [59]. The conceptual roots can be traced back to the research of Lazarsfeld and colleagues [59], who studied voters during the 1940 US presidential election. The study revealed that mass media influence was indirect, operating through opinion leaders who in turn influenced more passive segments of the population and shaped their behavioral tendencies—a phenomenon referred to as the two-stage flow model. Katz and Lazarsfeld [60] extended this theory and argued that consumer responses to mass media messages are filtered through opinion leaders who communicate their personal interpretations through multiple group interactions. As a result, the final consumer purchase decision combines both the influence of mass media and the strong influence of interpersonal communication, the latter proving to be more influential in shaping decision-making processes and behavior, unlike mass media [60].\n\nIn previous decades, the use of celebrities, including movie stars and Hollywood personalities, to enhance marketing communications was a proven strategy [61]. However, the ubiquity of social media has substantially increased the availability and appeal of influencer endorsement [62]. Recent statistics report that approximately 50% of internet users follow influencers’ social media accounts and rely on their recommendations, while 40% make purchases based on product visibility on platforms such as Instagram or YouTube. In 2018, 19% of US consumers made purchases based on influencer recommendations [63]. It is notable that brands are increasingly prioritizing social media influencers (SMIs) because they recognize that it is challenging to meaningfully engage consumers on social media independently [64]. Specifically, in 2018, influencer marketing (IM) was integrated by 86% of marketers into the overall outreach strategy. This trend is expected to intensify in the new decade [65].\n\nBased on author Mladen Maksic [66], we have created the most important points on how to use and follow influencer marketing strategies:\n\nTrust and authenticity—influencers inspire trust by authentically endorsing products and fostering a genuine connection with their audience.\n\nTargeted outreach—businesses gain access to a niche audience through influencers, connecting with followers whose demographics match their ideal consumer base.\n\nContent creation—influencers, proficient content creators, relieve brands of the responsibility of content creation while increasing their influence.\n\nSocial proof and recommendations—influencer endorsements carry significant weight, influencing consumer decisions and driving product trial initiatives.\n\nDiversifying marketing channels—collaborating with influencers brings new marketing channels, enriching and diversifying brand and its visibility.\n\nStorytelling and engagement—influencers capture audiences through storytelling techniques, establishing a more extensive connection with customers than conventional brand efforts.\n\nMeasurable ROI—marketing with influencers makes it easy to evaluate return on investment (ROI) based on data, allowing for precise and strategic adjustments.\n\nCost-effective marketing—influencer campaigns, which are often cost-effective, deliver significant ROI, positioning them as a cornerstone of today’s marketing triumphs.\n\nTo optimize the effectiveness of influencer partnerships, businesses should follow best practices that align with the dynamic contours of digital transformation and include processes for selecting and collaborating with influencers.
