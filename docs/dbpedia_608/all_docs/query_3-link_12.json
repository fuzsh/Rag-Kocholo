        "text": "Born in the Czech city of Brno in 1985, Rosol started playing tennis at the age of six. Twenty years later, he is ranked at exactly 100 in the ATP world rankings with a career high of 65 achieved in August last year.\n\nRosol turned professional in 2004 and is coached by 1999 US Open quarter-finalist Slava Dosedel. The Czech favours clay-court competitions, having won four of his five Challenger titles on the red surface.\n\n(Here he fairs less well against Albert Montanes in the Pekao Open in Poland)\n\nEarlier this month, Rosol played his first ever professional event on a grass surface at the AEGON Championships at Queen’s Club. There he beat Victor Hanescu and Marcos Baghdatis before losing to eventual champion Marin Cilic.\n\nHis first Challenger title came in the 2008 Košice Open in Slovakia, followed by the Internazionali Trofeo Lame Perrel – Faip in 2009, the Prosperita Open in 2010, and Strabag Prague and Spakassen Open’s in 2011.\n\nThis is Rosol’s sixth year in a row competing at Wimbledon, but the first time he has made it into the main draw. His previous attempts have all fallen short in the first round of qualifying. His round one win over Croatian Ivan Dodig was therefore his first ever main draw win in a Wimbledon main event."
