        "meta_description": "This chapter explores the changing geographies of the state in the Russian Far North by examining corporate social responsibility programmes undertaken by the hydrocarbon sector through a case study of Gazprom Neft’s Rodnye Goroda (‘Home Cities and Towns’) initiative, which is framed as promoting social, economic and environmental sustainability through a citizen-powered movement. Yet, as we show, the programme actually entrenches a paternalistic pattern of government through corporate–state partnerships. That is, Rodnye Goroda emphasizes state and corporate interests of creating a strong citizenry, but without investing in more systematic political and environmental reforms. In this way, the programme is iconic of the Russian Arctic paradox in which conditions have markedly improved today, yet plans are missing for a post-production scenario tomorrow. The transformations under way in the Arctic, combined with the consolidation of corporate and state power, we argue, are harbingers of the new spaces of geopolitics on the horizon.",
