Created a plan and presentation that is still used in order to draw investments and funding ($190,000) for the project, revised the financial part of the business plan of the projects, developed a strategy on how to approach investors and the crowdfunding community.\n\nAEM is a start-up project in Ghana (West Africa) with the aim to help rural pupils across the country and expand later across other Africa countries by providing them with good health care and relevant education for sustainable regional and continental development.\n\nThe objective is to assist these vulnerable children acquire the relevant basic education for sustainable human development hence responsible citizen in future. Ultimately education and development are first of all about liberating people from all (taboos, unfounded believes, wrong traditions, sacrifices, unemployment and many others) that holds them back from a full and worthy human life.\n\nThe project will promote the kind of education that can help those rural students to achieve a better live and therefore help to improve the future for these people and areas. Through the Rural Education initiative AEM wish to provide all rural schools with well-trained teaching professionals from our two teaching universities to enhance adequate teaching and learning processes for relevant cognitive development instead of using retirees and senior high leavers in the classrooms causing truancy, poor performance and many school dropout due to the pupils discourage.

At the same time, it will enable these hardworking professionals join the public sector to enjoy better work condition through the help of AEM. They will be trained through regular workshops to acquire basic entrepreneurial skills to pioneer development programs in the rural communities to help stop the high number of rural-urban migrants.\n\nWinner of the 2014 GESS Competition.
