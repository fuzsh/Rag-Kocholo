It is vital to study and comprehend the competitiveness of these tourist locations in order to create solutions to face competition and affect economic development. This research work aims to determine the tourism competitiveness of the Magical Towns of Mexico from the resources inherited, created, and supported. The methodology used was the exploratory factor analysis. The extracted factors’ factorial scores were used to create a competitiveness index, and, ﬁnally, the result was translated into a scale of 0−100 to make it easier to read. Todos Santos (62.89) is the most competitive Magical Town, while Bustamante is the least competitive (11.53). Expanding cultural resources, tourism infrastructure, events, additional tourism services,\n\n1\n\n2\n\nAnalysis of the Competitiveness of the Magical Towns of Mexico as Tourist\n\nand accessibility are some of the ways these locations can improve their competitiveness.

Having characteristics conducive to tourism, the towns with the designation Magical Town are considered an option to diversify inland tourism (Núñez & Ettinger, 2020; Shaadi et al., 2018). During the 20 years of validity of the Magical Towns program, a total of 132 appointments have been granted; however, these destinations face a growing number of competitors, both national and international, a situation that requires effectively managing their available resources and capacities. Understanding the importance and value of tourism in the global economy has allowed tourism to contribute to the competitiveness of a region and allows managers to consider the steps they can take to ensure advantages over other regions (García & Siles, 2015). In the same vein, given the diversity of tourist destinations and increasingly demanding customers, it becomes a necessity to develop competitive destinations capable of satisfying demand in a sustainable way, as well as increasing market share in balance with effective exploitation (Saavedra, 2012; Avila, 2011). Market trends in tourism make it necessary to propose processes of renewal of destinations and increase their competitiveness (Vera & Baños, 2010). In this way, to gain a favorable position in the market, tourism competitiveness is the key (Leung & Baloglu, 2013). The competitiveness of a destination has considerable implications for the entire tourism industry, which makes it an objective of great interest for public and private tourism agents (Sánchez, 2012). It is then that the measurement of competitiveness is a primary need (Gandara et al., 2013) which importance and usefulness lie in being a tool for the classiﬁcation of tourist destinations and the formulation of policies (Mendola & Volo, 2017; Amaya et al., 2017). Strategies are needed to boost the competitiveness of the tourism\n\n1.2 Preliminaries\n\n3\n\nsector (Armenski et al., 2017) and enhance our own capacities to achieve sustainable development over time (Granados et al., 2016). Competitiveness is a challenge that tourist destinations currently face to preserve their position in the market (Pérez et al., 2021). In Mexico, the development of tourist destinations is limited as there are no conditions of competitiveness; particularly, in the Magical Towns, their competitiveness is unknown and it is through the study, analysis, and understanding of tourism competitiveness that the establishment of suitable strategies to achieve economic development is facilitated. This research work aims to determine the tourism competitiveness of the Magical Towns of Mexico from the resources inherited, created, and supported. The structure of this chapter is as follows: Section 1.2 shows the theoretical foundation that guides this research; Section 1.3 presents the methodology, where the steps of the exploratory factor analysis are described; Section 1.4 points out the main results regarding the tourism competitiveness of the Magical Towns of Mexico; ﬁnally, Section 1.5 takes up the main ﬁndings.\n\n1.2 Preliminaries This section addresses the theoretical−conceptual foundations that have been seen as relevant and necessary in this research. First, the theory of tourism competitiveness is examined and then the Magical Towns of Mexico are discussed. 1.2.1 Tourism competitiveness Competitiveness has been present in tourism research since 1990 (Ritchie & Crouch, 2003). Tourism competitiveness is deﬁned as a destination’s ability to create, integrate, and deliver tourism experiences, including value-added goods and services that tourists consider important (Wei-Chiang, 2009); multiple factors intervene in this concept, although it is only in a few where the greatest options of success or failure reside (Alonso, 2010). The concept has evolved from focusing on tourism attractiveness to strategically developing the tourism industry in a more holistic way (Kim, 2012). To determine and explain the competitiveness of destinations, authors such as Poon (1993), Crouch & Ritchie (1999), Hassan (2000), Kim (2001), Health (2003), Ritchie & Crouch (2003), Dwyer & Kim (2003), Acerenza (2009), Wei-Chiang (2009), Alonso (2010), and Jiménez & Aquino (2012) have proposed models, which among their variables include the environment,\n\n4\n\nAnalysis of the Competitiveness of the Magical Towns of Mexico as Tourist\n\ndestination management, comparative advantage, competitive advantage, tourism infrastructure, key resources and attractions, demand, price, and cost of tourism, location or the destination, environment, and security, mainly. In addition, the causes and effects of destination competitiveness have recently been described by Flores et al. (2021b), ﬁnding among these causes are environmental commitment, inherited resources, resources created, general infrastructure, quality of service, accessibility, hospitality, destination management; and among the effects on sustainable development, tourism demand, customer satisfaction, tourism spending, proﬁtability, prosperity, and the arrival of tourists, mainly. 1.2.2 Magical Towns The Magical Towns offers a complementary and diversiﬁed tourist offer toward the market (Center for Social Studies and Public Opinion, 2017). A Magical Town is a town that has symbolic attributes, legends, history, transcendent facts, and ordinariness, which mean a great opportunity for tourist use (SECTUR, 2001). The localities that are attached to the Magical Towns program have, through this denomination, a category that identiﬁes them as diversifying elements of the country’s tourist offer (Shaadi et al., 2018). A town called Magical Town must have different architectural, historical, or contemporary elements, emblematic buildings, festivals, and traditions, artisan production, traditional cuisine, and a tourist destination of support in a radius of inﬂuence no greater than 1 hour away (García & Guerrero, 2014). The Magical Towns program raises the possibility of beneﬁting small towns in addition to providing them with the opportunity to recover their cultural, festive, gastronomic, natural, artistic, historical heritage, and even the capacity of proposal and management of some local groups, although it also contemplates towns with a great tourist trajectory (López, 2018). According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2012), Magical Towns is one of the most successful tourism programs, because it has managed to boost the growth of rural communities and towns, in addition to generating the conservation of natural landscapes and local cultural traditions. During the 20 years of the Magical Towns program, a total of 132 appointments have been granted, of which 26 (20%) are distributed in the northern region, 85 (64%) in the central region, and 21 (16%) in the southern region of Mexico. Figure 1.1 shows the number of Magical Towns for each state of Mexico. The states of Puebla and the State of Mexico have the highest\n\n1.2 Preliminaries\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.1 Number of Magical Towns by state. Source: Own elaboration based on information available in DataTur Comprehensive Tourism Analysis.\n\nnumber of appointments, each with 10; on the contrary, the states of Baja California, Colima, Guerrero, and Tabasco have only one appointment each. It is worth mentioning that Mexico City does not appear in the graph as it does not have any appointment. Magical Towns can be considered as an alternative or non-mass form of tourism in Mexico, because as described by López and Palomino (2008), this type of tourism presents a new trend whose objective is to provide shared experiences in a unique environment, as well as participate in the cultural expressions of rural, indigenous, and urban communities. Likewise, it has been identiﬁed that among the 132 Magical Towns, the following tourist typologies are covered: sun and beach tourism, nature tourism or ecotourism, adventure tourism, rural tourism, cultural tourism, religious tourism, gastronomic tourism, and geotourism. In October 2016, derived from the results of the tourist statistics of the 2014 economic census by the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics (INEGI), SECTUR prepared for the ﬁrst time a section for Magical Towns. The following statistics correspond to the 82 different Magical Towns designated until 2013: • They concentrate 7.8% of the total economic units with tourist activities (38,693 units). The highest concentration is in the retail trade, with a total of 17,673 units; Also noteworthy is the sector of temporary\n\n6\n\nAnalysis of the Competitiveness of the Magical Towns of Mexico as Tourist\n\n•\n\n• •\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\naccommodation services and food and beverage preparation, which groups 16,103 units. The Magical Towns of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Taxco, Comitán de Domínguez, Lagos de Moreno, Cholula, Dolores Hidalgo, and Pátzcuaro concentrate 40.9% of the economic units, that is, about 15,829 units. They registered a gross tourist census value added of 10,292 million pesos, which represents 2.4% of the total tourism nationwide. The share of retail trade in the gross tourism census value added was 58.5% while the temporary accommodation services and food and beverage preparation sector participated with 24.2%, so that these two sectors account for 82.7% of the total in Magical Towns. The Magical Town of Metepec was the one that presented the greatest contribution to the gross tourist census value added with 14.8%, followed by San Cristóbal de las Casas with 8.4%, Comitán de Domínguez with 6.7%, and Cholula with 4.7%. 117,972 occupations are generated, which is equivalent to 4.3% of the total tourists. The two sectors that generate the highest volumes of tourist occupancy are temporary accommodation and food and beverage preparation services, as well as retail trade, with a total of 49,273 and 49,030 people employed respectively in 2013. The Magical Towns of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Comitán de Domínguez, Metepec, Taxco, Cholula, Lagos de Moreno, Pátzcuaro, Valladolid, Dolores Hidalgo, Valle de Bravo, Tecate, and Coatepec are the ones that generate just over half (51.6%) of the total jobs in these destinations. The gross formation of tourist ﬁxed capital (FBKFT) amounted to 642.3 million pesos, which is equivalent to 1.8% nationally, being the two sectors with the highest volume of FBKFT retail trade with 414.7 million pesos and temporary accommodation services and food and beverage preparation with 132.8 million pesos.\n\n1.3 Methodology The focus of this research is quantitative since it is based on the measurement of the characteristics of social phenomena (Bernal, 2010) − in this case, tourism competitiveness. With respect to the design of the research, it is descriptive since it is inferred that the Magical Towns as tourist destinations\n\n1.3 Methodology\n\n7\n\nhave a series of characteristics that make them an objective of study; it is also transversal because data will be obtained from the population at a particular time. The universe of study is the 132 existing localities in Mexico that have the designation of Magical Town from 2001, when the program began, to 2020. The study data have been taken at the municipal level because in several cases, this is the last level of disaggregation of the information provided by INEGI, in addition to the fact that the tourist promotion of the Magical Towns can consider tourist attractions that are nearby. Based on the above, it is important to note that an appointment was granted to San Martín de las Pirámides and Teotihuacán; however, these localities are located in different municipalities, both in the State of Mexico, which is why data from both municipalities have been included and a total of 133 individuals are under study. The information was taken from the year 2020. To evaluate tourism competitiveness, inherited resources, resources created, and support resources were established as dimensions of this variable. In turn, sub-dimensions and indicators were deﬁned for each of them, proposing a total of 7 sub-dimensions and 37 indicators. To obtain the information corresponding to each indicator, secondary sources such as the National Statistical Directory of Economic Units, the Cultural Information System of Mexico, and the Ministry of Tourism, mainly, were used. With the information obtained, a database was generated in Excel. An exploratory factor analysis was then carried out as developed by Guillermo and García (2010, 2015) to evaluate the municipal competitiveness index in the municipalities of Puebla and in municipalities of metropolitan areas of the different states of the Mexican Republic, in addition to Navarro and Zamora (2013) who examined the municipal competitiveness of tourism in Michoacán. Factor analysis is a multivariate technique that aims to simplify the multiple and complex relationships that may exist between a set of observed X1 , X2 , . . ., Xp variables. Speciﬁcally, it is a question of ﬁnding a set of k < p factors not directly observable F1 , F2 , . . ., Fk that sufﬁciently explain the observed variables losing the minimum of information, so that they are easily interpretable (principle of interpretability) and that they are the least possible, that is, small k (principle of parsimony) (Pérez, 2004). In this case, the exploratory factor analysis allowed to analyze the indicators of each sub-dimension and dimension that makes up the variable of tourism competitiveness.\n\n8\n\nAnalysis of the Competitiveness of the Magical Towns of Mexico as Tourist\n\nIt began with the typiﬁcation of the indicators, a step that sought that all the indicators had a similar contribution to the determination of the proximities, and, in turn, there are no variables that, due to the fact of being very dispersed, contribute more to the calculation of the distances (Pérez, 2004). This was achieved with a transformation of the standard normal distribution with zero mean and variance one through the following equation (Zamora & Cruz, 2020): (Y ij −Yj ) , Zij = Sj where Yij is the variable j of individual i, Yj is the arithmetic mean of variable j, and Sj is the standard deviation of variable j. Immediately, the contrasts prior to the extraction of factors were applied; this was with the intention of analyzing the relevance of applying the factor analysis. The correlation matrix, its determinant, the Bartlett sphericity test, and the Kaiser−Meyer−Olkin (KMO) statistic were used. Subsequently, the optimal number of factors was determined, for which the criteria of scree test and eigenvalue were used. Factors were then extracted using the main components method. The next step was the rotation of factors to identify the structure of association between variables and factors; for this, the varimax method was used. The rotation effect is to redistribute the variance to obtain a pattern of factors or components with greater meaning (Kendall & W. R., 1990). The varimax redistribution method focuses on simplifying the vectors of the columns of factors (components) as much as possible; maximum simpliﬁcation is achieved by reaching values such as +1 (positive association) or −1 (negative association) and other charges close to 0 (absence of association) (Santos et al., 2003). Their scores were immediately obtained through the regression method. To construct the competitiveness index of the Magical Towns, the factorial scores of the extracted factors were used, that is, values that were multiplied by the standardized variables. These results were transformed into a scale from 0 to 100 in order to facilitate their interpretation (OECD & JRC, 2008), based on the following formula: Iij =\n\nINIJ −minj (Xi ) maxj (Xi ) −minj (Xi )\n\n× 100,\n\nwhere Iij represents the value of indicator i on the scale from 0 to 100 for observation j, INIJ is the value of indicator i for observation j, minj (Xi ) represents the lowest indicator of observation j, and maxj (Xi ) is the largest\n\n1.4 Results\n\n9\n\nindicator of observation j. Finally, each factor was multiplied by the proportion it explains, thus obtaining a weighted average. Exploratory factor analysis was performed in the R Studio software.\n\n1.4 Results The exploratory factor analysis eliminated 20 of the 37 indicators initially considered, leaving 17 indicators that are distributed in the 7 sub-dimensions and these in turn in the 3 dimensions proposed: inherited resources, resources created, and support resources. When applying the contrast tests, the following results were found: the determinant presented a value close to 0 (2.813277E-09); indicators are positively correlated (see Figure 1.2); Bartlett’s sphericity test resulted in a p value = 0; the KMO test gave an MSAg (measure of sufﬁciency or adequacy) of 0.86 (interpreted as meritorious according to Hair et al., 2009) and MSAj values were higher than 0.5 in all cases (see Figure 1.3). Three factors to be extracted from the eigenvalues and the scree test were deﬁned. Figure 1.4 exempliﬁes the result of the eigenvalues, and in the same ﬁgure, the result of applying the function “fa.parallel” of R Studio is observed, which suggests three factors. The three factors were extracted and the loads were rotated. Figure 1.5 presents the results obtained. The three factors together explain 77% of the variance, the commonality of each of the variables is greater than 60%, each factor is composed of a number greater than three variables, the average square root of the residuals is 0.06, and the principles of interpretability and parsimony are met (Pérez, 2004). The ﬁrst factor explains 33% of the variance and is made up of eight indicators: BAB (infrastructure of restaurants and bars), BAC (travel agencies), BBA (recreational activities), BBB (sports activities), BBD (cinemas), BCA (medical services), BCB (gas stations), and BCC (banking/ﬁnancial services); see Table 1.1. The second factor explains 23% of the variance and together with the ﬁrst factor accumulate 56% of the variance; it is made up of ﬁve indicators: AAE (beach offer), BAD (tour operators), BAE (car rental), BAH (tourist transport), and BCE (botanical gardens and zoos); see Table 1.2. The third factor explains 21% of the variance and together with the two previous factors accumulates 77% of variance; it is made up of four indicators: ABF (museums), BAA (hotel infrastructure), BAF (rental of buses, trailers, etc.), and CAC (ground transport services) (see Table 1.3).\n\n10 Analysis of the Competitiveness of the Magical Towns of Mexico as Tourist\n\nFigure 1.2 Correlation graph.

On the other hand, the least competitive Magical Town with a score of 11,526 is Bustamante, located in the municipality of Bustamante, Nuevo León. Bustamante scored 9100 in the ﬁrst factor, 15,482 in the second factor, and, ﬁnally, 10,995 in the third factor. Regarding the indicators analyzed, the Magical Town of Bustamante has only 2 museums, 2 medical services, 1 gas station, 2 banking/ﬁnancial services, 21 restaurants and/or cafes, and 8 hotels.\n\n1.5 Conclusions With the results obtained in the development of this research, it can be afﬁrmed that the inherited resources, the resources created, and the support\n\n14 Analysis of the Competitiveness of the Magical Towns of Mexico as Tourist resources are factors that determine the level of tourism competitiveness of the Magical Towns of Mexico. Through these factors, the competitiveness of the Magical Towns was measured, generating a Tourism Competitiveness Index (ICT) for the 132 Magical Towns of Mexico. Once the tourist competitiveness of the Magical Towns has been analyzed, the results obtained allow comparing the most outstanding indicators and those that are susceptible to improvement depending on each competitiveness factor. The results achieved in the current research work contribute directly to the vision that has been proposed by the national strategy of Magical Towns, which seeks to position Mexico as a competitive and avant-garde tourism power, which achieves equitable, fair, and balanced development between communities and regions, through the sustainable use of cultural and natural heritage. With the exception of natural resources, the rest of the indicators of each competitiveness factor can be created by human beings, and it is recommended to identify the resources that are needed in each destination, as well as the quality of those already existing to immediately integrate into the development plans of each town actions aimed at having all the indicators mentioned in the previous paragraph both in quality and in sufﬁcient quantity to meet the needs and expectations of the tourists who visit the Magical Town. One of the constraints noted was that the analytic data were collected at municipal level; while this is understandable, it would have been fascinating to have data from a speciﬁc locality, as this is thought to have an impact on the outcome. The COVID-19 pandemic is also seen as a limitation, since it changed the pace of tourism dynamics and will make it difﬁcult to subsequently compare the index obtained in this work. As future lines of research for Magical Towns, the following are visualized: to evaluate the satisfaction of the residents since the designation of Magical Town was granted to the place; to evaluate the perception and satisfaction of the tourist about tourist services and in general about the Magical Town to analyze the use of ICTs by the different tourist services and by the Magical Town in general, as tools for the promotion and tourism marketing of the place; to evaluate the quality of the service provided by the various establishments directly involved in the tourist activity; to assess the economic impact that Magical Towns had during and after the pandemic. Finally, it is considered feasible to carry out this same study in various periods of time, with the aim of studying the evolution of each Magical Town on tourism competitiveness.\n\nReferences\n\n15\n\nReferences Acerenza, M.

The panel data method was used by creating three unbalanced models. According to the results, the economic performance of organic berries depends mainly on increasing the number of cultivated hectares, obtaining higher yields, and improving domestic prices as well as the average rural price. The conclusion is that improving the economic performance of Mexico’s organic berries entails an increased production. However, this depends on the international demand, which currently has been increasing, while the yield per hectare is mainly a function of the technology and techniques used. On the other hand, rural and domestic prices are largely determined by international prices. Keywords: Economic performance, berries, Mexico.\n\n2.1 Introduction Organic agriculture represents a sustainable alternative to customary agriculture. It can contribute to reduce hunger, poverty, and rural inequality. It preserves the cultural diversity of natural resources since it uses soils that\n\n23\n\n24 Economic Performance of Organic Berries in Mexico are not degraded or contaminated, and it generates healthy and better quality food. It also helps to generate jobs because of a higher production and use of labor. Organic agriculture holds an average increased production of 20% more than customary farms. In addition, it has increased biodiversity, improved water quality, and generated greater proﬁtability as well as greater nutritional value in its products (Häring et al., 2001; UN, 2020; Organic Research Centres Alliances, 2009; Seufert & Ramankutty, 2017). Sustainable consumption behaviors have generated greater demand for organic products based on a growing awareness of the environment lately. A sustainable consumption behavior occurs when a consumer adopts two positive attitudes: the consumer shows greater involvement and responsibility so that the needs of future generations are not put at risk, and the consumer becomes aware of sustainability and the environment by minimizing the use of natural resources, toxic materials, and waste emissions. This is all related to the meaning of organic agriculture. It is deﬁned as a production system that maximizes orchard resources focusing on increasing soil fertility and biological activity, and it maximizes the use of non-renewable resources by avoiding synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for the protection of natural resources and human health (Aceleanu, 2016; FAO, 2020; Salgado-Beltrán & Beltrán-Morales, 2011; Veracruz & Hernández, 2016). According to FiBL & IFOAM-ORGANICS INTERNATIONAL (2021), currently, only 1.5% of agricultural land is organic; however, mainly in recent years, there has been a substantial increase in organic agricultural land in many countries. In 2019, 187 countries registered 72.3 million hectares of organic farmland. The countries with the largest areas of organic farmland were Australia (35.7 million hectares), Argentina (3.7 million hectares), and Spain (2.4 million hectares). All registered organic area was more than 72 million hectares. It represents a growth of over 2 million compared to the previous year. These lands were managed by 3.1 million producers in 2019 with an increasing trend since 2018, when almost 2.8 million producers were registered, India, Uganda, and Ethiopia being the most important holders. This change in consumer preferences has played a crucial role in increasing organic production as the demand for organic products has grown substantially. Sales exceeded 106 billion euros in 2019. The United States was by far the main market with 44.7 billion euros, followed by Germany with 11.9 billion, France with 11.3 billion, and China with 8.5 billion. Also, other European and American countries remained within the top 10 of the largest organic food markets such as Italy, Canada, Switzerland, UK,\n\n2.2 Theoretical and Conceptual Framework\n\n25\n\nSweden, and Spain, which together add up to 16.9 billion euros. As for the highest per capita consumption worldwide, it was registered by Denmark and Switzerland with 344 and 338 euros, respectively, in 2019. These countries continue to show an increasing trend considering that they registered a per capita consumption of 312 euros each in 2018. Given these circumstances, there are greater opportunities for producers and companies not only in their countries of origin, but also to expand their markets internationally by exporting their products to other countries (FiBL & IFOAM-ORGANICS INTERNATIONAL, 2021; FAO, Committee on Agriculture, 1999; Gomiero, 2018). Organic agricultural exports regularly sell for 20% more than customary products. Even so, the proﬁtability of organic production can be highly unsteady due to vulnerability to pests, climate changes, etc., among other factors. In addition, little research has been done to assess long-term market prices although the study is relevant as the proﬁtability of organic agriculture contributes to local food security, food safety, and household income encouragement (FAO, 2019b). Mexico has managed to increase its presence in the production and marketing of organic food worldwide, especially in the production of fruits, vegetables, and coffee. The organic fruit sector in particular has registered a remarkable growth in recent years (SIAP, 2021), which is attributed to the growing global demand for this type of food. The production of berries in Mexico has experienced a remarkable increase in recent years, and it concentrates in eight Mexican states: Baja California, Baja California Sur, Michoacán, Jalisco, Querétaro, Tlaxcala, Guanajuato, and Puebla. However, the production of the latter four states is still very incipient and/or inconsistent. The group of fruits known as berries is also called ﬁne fruits, frutillas, or forest fruits because they are small and intensely colored. This includes strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries (FIRA, 2016). The production and exports of Mexican organic berries hold economic, ecological, and social importance as these products satisfy a growing international demand. So, this research seeks to identify and analyze the main factors that inﬂuence the economic performance of these foods. This paper is structured as follows. Section 3.1 is the introduction, and Section 3.2 corresponds to a literature review, which is mainly based on the theories of economic growth. Subsequently, Section 3.3 describes the model and data used. Finally, the results and conclusions obtained are presented.\n\n26 Economic Performance of Organic Berries in Mexico\n\n2.2 Theoretical and Conceptual Framework 2.2.1 Economic performance and agricultural sector When we talk about economic performance, we know that such deﬁnition is framed within the theories of economic growth and the various factors that can explain it. Therefore, there are several deﬁnitions of economic growth. Some of these deﬁnitions relate to this research. Enriquez (2016) and Chetthamrongcha (2020) deﬁned economic growth as the increase, rise, or quantitative expansion of income and the value of ﬁnal goods and services produced in the economic system during a certain period. This is measured and reﬂected through the growth rate of a country’s gross domestic product (GDP). From Antoine de Montchrétien’s (1575−1621) point view, economic growth is related to an increase of wealth that can be obtained through territorial extension and gold possessions, understanding the cultivated surface as “territorial extension.” Francois Quesnay (1758), in Tableau Economique, mentioned that agriculture is the productive activity that generates net products in a circular ﬂow of income and expenditure. In contrast, John Maynard Keynes (1883−1946) argued that economic growth is inﬂuenced by the level of investment, the level of savings, and the possibilities of opening new investments. Supporting this perspective, Michal Kalecki (1899−1970) supported the relationship between investment and economic growth. Examining the effects of exports on economic growth through the export-led growth hypothesis, we found a causal relationship with better performance in growth than in import substitution policies (Balassa, 1978). Thirlwall (1979) established a relationship between economic growth and trade balance based on the restricted growth model of the balance of payments (Holland et al., 2004). According to a study by Meador and O’Brien (2019), the agricultural sector is a factor for economic growth in the case of Rwanda; this country has experienced signiﬁcant economic growth as a result of that sector’s expansion. In another study, Chetthamrongcha (2020) deduced that some macroeconomic indicators are important to the agricultural sector such as the interest rate, agricultural land, the unemployment rate, agricultural exports, crude oil prices, inﬂation, government expenditure, trade openness, and the exchange rate. Also, Chowdhury (2020) found a positive relationship between economic growth and government consumption expenditure, fertility rate, inﬂation rate, and agricultural sector growth, and a negative relationship between economic\n\n2.2 Theoretical and Conceptual Framework\n\n27\n\ngrowth and population growth. On the other hand, Kumar (2019) revealed a positive and signiﬁcant relationship between economic growth and foreign direct investment in the agricultural sector. According to Onegina et al. (2020), the basis of economic growth is increasing labor productivity in agriculture and reducing the time needed for food production. Hofman (2017), on the other hand, concluded that a negative contribution of the total factor productivity (TFP) reﬂects a longterm economic growth in countries and sectors, even if there is investment in the last 20 years. Badibanga and Ulimwengu (2020) showed that additional agricultural investment coupled with improved agricultural input productivity will accelerate the country’s pace toward achieving growth and poverty reduction goals. In the same vein, Phiri et al. (2020) found a signiﬁcant impact in both the short run and long run of agricultural production on economic growth, with unit effect coefﬁcients of 0.428 and 0.342, respectively. The effects tend to be high because more than two-thirds of the rural population depends on agriculture, which has been a catalyst for food security. According to the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC), the factors of economic growth in Latin American structuralism are the balance between imports and exports, meaning productivity and tariff protection to obtain distributive equity (Enriquez, 2016). Regarding the organic sector, Milosevic (2020) obtained that competitiveness and production capacity of organic producers in Serbia should be strengthened through the tax system. This will contribute to the sustainable and long-term growth of this activity and consequently to the economic growth and development of the country. 2.2.2 Performance of organic farming Numerous studies have tried to estimate performance of organic agriculture in comparison to conventional farming ﬁnding different results. For example, a study in India found that organic farming activities were very favorable for improving degraded lands. These ﬁndings may favor the implementation of policies to manage organic agricultural production in India (Yadava & Komaraiah, 2021). Another study, also in India, investigated small-scale tea producers in Assam; it was found that the annual income obtained from 1 hectare of smallscale organic tea cultivation is higher than the income from conventional production. However, it was identiﬁed that organic yields are lower than\n\n28 Economic Performance of Organic Berries in Mexico conventional yields by 10%, and this in turn generates a decrease in income. However, organic tea cultivation is considered to be an economically viable alternative for small-scale producers over a time span of 10 years, as long as producers obtain a high and stable yield after transitioning from conventional to organic (Deka & Goswami, 2021). In another study conducted in Lebanon, it was found that organic agriculture, even though beneﬁcial, is increasingly costly mainly due to the high production costs incurred by producers as well as the inefﬁcient organization of the organic value chain (Aoun et al., 2022). In Bangladesh, a study was carried out to examine the historical development of organic agriculture as well as its current status. It detected the bottlenecks in the growth of this activity. Unlike the previous study, it was found that input prices are lower than in conventional agriculture and similar productivity was identiﬁed. In addition to this, price premiums make organic production as a whole beneﬁcial and suitable for smallholder farmers in Bangladesh. Farmers achieved lower production costs through reduced use of external chemical inputs, higher prices, and thus higher proﬁts, which translated into beneﬁts from organic farming (Ferdous et al., 2021). Just like Deka and Goswami (2021) and Ferdous et al. (2021), Durham and Mizik (2021) found that, in economic terms, production costs can be reported to be lower in organic agriculture than in conventional agriculture, in addition to the existence of higher prices in organic markets; however, lower yields were detected in organic farms, mainly in fruit production, vegetables, and the livestock sector. Even so, it can be pointed out that organic systems outperform conventional systems, since organic agriculture can generate important beneﬁts in environmental terms for local communities. For organic agriculture to be considered as contributing to sustainable agricultural development, it needs to be economically viable for farmers, i.e., the income obtained must be at least as high as that of conventional agriculture (Meemken & Qaim, 2018). 2.2.3 Land, prices, and yields Several investigations have been mainly oriented to contrast yields between organic and conventional agriculture. In some cases, it was shown that yields in organic production were higher than yields in conventional production, although in other cases, they were considerably lower. In this sense, the average yield of organic agriculture is lower due to the higher costs it incurs, which leads to higher average prices. As a result, consumers sometimes end\n\n2.2 Theoretical and Conceptual Framework\n\n29\n\nup paying a higher price given the lower yields of organic products that do not necessarily convert into higher dividends for producers (Meemken & Qaim, 2018). In contrast to organic agricultural production, some authors consider that the low yields it generates lead to the use of a greater amount of land, which generates greater deforestation and a loss of biodiversity. This contrasts with the supposed environmental beneﬁts of organic agriculture. Ecological, social, and economic beneﬁts are very important for sustainable food security. However, these beneﬁts are achieved through good agricultural production practices in speciﬁc organic commodity crops. In such crops, yields are almost equal to those of conventional crops; however, this does not apply to all organic products at present (Seufert et al., 2012). A study conducted in Punjab, Pakistan revealed that in terms of agricultural production, the yield of conventional producers was 11% higher than that of organic producers. However, consumers maintained their preference for organic products (Aslam et al., 2020). This implies a change in preferences and consumption habits, as long as income is sufﬁcient. According to Croeder and Reganold (2015), organic production is in a proﬁt range between 22% and 35%, which is more proﬁtable than conventional production. Despite this, as mentioned above, yields of organic products are lower and therefore farmers receive higher prices as long as their products are certiﬁed. The additional to the average price of organic production is around 30%; these incentives make it more attractive than conventional production (Crowder & Reganold, 2015). Agriculture today should be focused on caring for the environment and mitigating climate change. The problem is that inputs are insufﬁcient to raise yields of organic crops in all countries that are dedicated to producing sustainably, leading to the impossibility of meeting the global demand for this type of food (Timsina, 2018). To improve agricultural sustainability, it is essential to guarantee yields, mitigate environmental impacts, and reduce climate change. Organic agriculture is sustainable as long as yields increase, orienting production toward better distribution and consumption habits and with adequate agroecological management (Brzozowski & Mazourek, 2018). Organic agriculture is economically sustainable depending on the geographical location where it is grown and the types of crops; the beneﬁts obtained come mainly from the price premium of these crops. This implies the need for further studies in various locations, products, and situations (Aoun et al., 2022).\n\n30 Economic Performance of Organic Berries in Mexico When producers decide to adopt organic agriculture, their main incentive is higher prices than conventional agricultural products. At the same time, the aim is to maintain food security, which also allows them to increase exports in the face of higher production and increased domestic demand due to the increase in population and income (Ferdous et al., 2021). Badley et al. (2007) state that the yields of organic agriculture in advanced countries are in the order of 92.2% compared to the dividends of traditional farming. On the other hand, yields range from 180.2% in the case of developing countries, which could change world production in a short time. In less developed countries, smallholder farmers have low education standards and limited access to agricultural training. This implies that more land area is required to produce the same amount of agricultural goods in these countries, given the yields in developed countries (Meemken & Qaim, 2018). A study in Germany revealed that larger plots reduce agricultural costs, including labor. Thus, producing organically with the same plot sizes and distances between plots is cheaper and therefore generates higher dividends. This led to the conclusion that increasing the size of plots generates economies of scale, reduces unproductive times, and improves the utilization of agricultural activities (Heinrichs et al., 2021). The best alternative to conventional agriculture is organic agriculture, since it generates healthy products with minimal environmental impact. However, the debate still prevails as to which of the two systems is more proﬁtable for producers in each sector. Likewise, the challenge for organic agriculture is to be more economically feasible so that it can be considered fully sustainable considering the three dimensions: environmental, social, and economic. According to this theoretical and empirical review, we can conclude that the main variables contributing to economic growth are yield, prices, cultivated area, agricultural land, income, and demand. Thus, the methodology used, considering these factors that inﬂuence economic growth, or in other words, the economic performance of organic berries in Mexico, is presented below.\n\n2.3 Methodology The model proposed for the present study was selected based on the previous section, mainly detecting the same most recent studies (most of them from 2018−2022 in databases such as Elsevier, Google Scholar, X-MOL, etc.);\n\n2.3 Methodology 31\n\nFigure 2.1\n\nModel of economic performance variables for Mexico’s organic berries.\n\nSource: Author’s design based on empirical and theoretical evidence.\n\nthus, it collected information from the empirical evidence through interviews with 20 organic berry producers from the Los Reyes, Michoacán, and Ziracuaretiro regions during 2019 and 2020. Based on the above, the proposed model is composed of the variables: cultivated area, harvested area, yields, average rural price, domestic price, and international price as independent variables; and the value of production as a dependent variable. The data on some variables − dependent variable such as Production Value and independent variables such as Cultivated Area, Harvested Area, Yields, and Average Rural Price − were obtained from SIACON (Agri-food information system for consultation). This is an electronic tool designed to generate dynamic reports on annual statistics of the agricultural, livestock, and ﬁshery subsectors. The information can be consulted at state and municipal levels. It has information on all national crops by cycle, water modality, and with annual data for the 1980−2018 series. The data for the National Price variable were retrieved from the SNIIM (National Information and Market Integration System). This is a service of the Ministry of Economy that provides information on the behavior of wholesale prices of agricultural, livestock, and ﬁshery products traded in national and international markets. The data for the International Price variable were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) – FAOSTAT. This database on food and agriculture provides freely accessible data for more than 245 countries and 35 regions since 1961. Once the data were obtained, the statistical software R version 4.0.0 was used, and three unbalanced panel data models were constructed to identify the\n\n32 Economic Performance of Organic Berries in Mexico Table 2.1 Deﬁnition of variables and data sources.

The period selected corresponds to the information available. The data for variables National Price and International Price were based on data from customary berries because there is no information at national level on these variables for organic berries. Panel data is a special type of pooled data in which the same crosssectional unit (a household, a company, or a state) is analyzed over time, i.e., the dimensions of space and time are found in panel data. A balanced panel is one in which each subject − a company, individuals, etc. − has the same number of observations. The panel is unbalanced if there are different numbers of observations. There are short panels and long panels. A short panel is one in which the number of subjects is more than the number of periods. In a long panel, T is greater than N (Gujarati & Porter, 2010).\n\n2.3 Methodology 33\n\nThe panel data model for this research is given by formula (2.1): (2.1) Valordelaproduccionit = α + β1 Superﬁciesembradait + β2 Superﬁciecosechadait +β 3 Rendimientoit + β4 Preciomedioruralit +β 5 Precionacionalit + β6 Preciointernacionalit + ε i = 1, . . . , N t = 1, . . . , T, where α is the constant, β represents vector q × 1 of the parameters to be estimated, i is the ith subject, t is the period of the variables, and ε is the error. Panel data regression can be estimated through several different models: pooled regression, ﬁxed effects, and random effects, among others. In the pooled regression model, the observations on different individuals are simply grouped in a single regression without foreseeing individual differences that could generate different coefﬁcients; it does not take into account their crosssectional and time-series nature. In the ﬁxed effects model, the observations are pooled, but each variable is expressed as a deviation from its mean value for each time-steady feature of individuals, and then an ordinary least squares regression is estimated on the mean-corrected values. As for the random effects model, we assume that the values of individual differences are the values of the intercept, but we recognize that individuals in the sample are from a r"
