Lottie Williams came to attention in 2013 as Curvy Kate’s “Star in a Bra” winner. Modelling here for the same brand she is snapped at a trade show. A heroine, in our book, for bearing her body in such a public arena, Lottie is pleasingly like the rest of us, with her own curves, lumps and bumps. That the bra and knickers she models are somewhat unremarkable is of secondary interest to such a life-affirming role-model.
