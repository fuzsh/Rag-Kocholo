        "text": "Tips on Writing a Message of Condolence\n\nYou may not know exactly what you want to say in your Book of Memoriesâ„¢ condolence message. In fact, this may be the first time you've ever been faced with sharing your feelings or offering comforting words to someone who is grieving a loss. Whether it's the first time, or the fifth, we're here to offer some assistance. We've compiled some tips, and brought together a list of expressive words you can use in your condolences.\n\nTip #1: Be sincere. It's important to mean what you say, on the deepest emotional level. Yes, we know, \"saying what you mean\" can be harder - that's why we're here.\n\nTip #2: Keep it simple. You don't need to say much more than \"I'm sorry for you loss,\" yet it's always wonderful to share a personal memory of their loved one, if you have one.\n\nTip #3: Don't tell them you know how they feel. Because you can't really know; even if you've endured the loss of a loved one in the past - your grief was yours, and this is theirs.\n\nTip #4: Share how you felt when you heard the news. Perhaps you were shocked, disbelieving, or deeply saddened.

It will be a comfort to them to know that their loved one will be remembered.\n\nA Short List of Appropriate Phrases:\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with you during this difficult time.\n\nPlease accept my condolences on the loss of your partner.\n\nWith deepest sympathy for your loss.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with you.\n\nPlease know our loving thoughts embrace you each and every day.\n\nThinking of you in these difficult times and sending you love.\n\nWith heartfelt condolences.\n\nWishing you comfort at this sorrowful time.\n\nSharing in your sorrow, thinking of you and wishing I could be there\n\nto hold your hand.\n\nMay the love of those around you, help you through the days ahead.\n\nHold tight to memories for comfort.\n\nLean on your friends for strength, and always remember how much you are cared about.\n\nAs you comprehend this profound loss, let yourself cry knowing each tear is a note of love rising to the heavens.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with you.\n\nPeace, prayers and blessings.\n\nWords cannot even begin to express our sorrow.\n\nYou are in our prayers.\n\nMay your memories give you strength.\n\nRemember that we love and care about you.\n\nMay the love of those around you help you through the days ahead."
