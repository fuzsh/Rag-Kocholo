        "text": "Early Friday morning, a charter bus transporting the Sioux City Explorers, a professional baseball team, caught fire while en route from Iowa to a game in a Chicago suburb. The incident occurred as the bus was approaching Earlham, Iowa, a small town with a population of around 1,400, situated approximately a third of the way into their 490-mile journey to Geneva, Illinois.\n\nWhat was the cause of the fire?\n\nThanks to the Independent we learned the blaze, which was caused by a mechanical issue according to Earlham Fire & Rescue, began in the engine compartment and quickly spread to the passenger area of the bus. At the time, many of the players were asleep, unaware of the unfolding danger. The fire was intense enough to break the bus windows, creating a chaotic and dangerous situation for those on board.\n\nJ.D. Scholten, a 44-year-old pitcher for the Explorers and also a member of the Iowa Legislature, recounted the frightening experience. Scholten was awakened by fellow players urging everyone to evacuate due to the smoke that had filled the bus. In the confusion, several players lost their gloves as the overhead bins melted from the heat.\n\nFortunately, all members of the team managed to escape the bus unharmed. The Earlham Fire & Rescue was alerted to the emergency at around 2:45 a.m. and arrived promptly. Volunteer firefighter Blake Boyle reported that the team responded quickly to extinguish the fire, preventing further damage or injuries.\n\nDid everyone make it out okay?\n\nDespite the significant damage to their transportation and the loss of some personal belongings, the Explorers were relieved that no one was hurt in the incident. The team will have to make alternate travel arrangements for the remainder of their trip to Geneva."
