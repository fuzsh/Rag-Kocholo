        "text": "They became 'random' pals after meeting at Glastonbury this year. But now it can be revealed that Tom Cruise and Spanish singer Victoria Canal may have crossed the line of friendship into something more romantic.\n\nColleagues of the Hollywood star were stunned when Ms Canal visited the set of Mission: Impossible 8 in Oxfordshire, England.\n\nShe spent most of the day there, setting tongues wagging that the pair - who are more than 35 years apart in age - may have struck up a romance.\n\n'It is all very bizarre,' a crew member told MailOnline. 'Tom invited Victoria to watch him film for the whole day and that is just not something he does for his random friends.\n\n'When she turned up, there was much gossip: is she Tom's new romantic partner? It might have seemed unlikely that they would become anything more than friends but they are pretty much inseparable.\n\n'They have been seeing a lot of one another and Victoria is beautiful. It's all been happening in plain sight.'\n\nCruise and Ms Canal hit it off instantly when they met after she joined Coldplay on Glastonbury's Pyramid stage along with Michael J Fox.\n\nSources say they got along 'like a house on fire' and they have met on at least five occasions. And Ms Canal, 25, is said to have visited Cruise's lavish apartment in Knightsbridge, London.\n\nJust days after they were introduced, Cruise, 62, invited Ms Canal, who was born without her right forearm due to amniotic band syndrome, they met again at the premiere of Twisters at Cineworld in London's Leicester Square.\n\nHe flew her to the capital in his helicopter and video footage has emerged of them giggling inside the venue and later walking through the city together.\n\nAfterwards, Ms Canal wrote on Instagram: 'We met backstage at [Glastonbury] and talked about the upcoming premiere we were both going to and he said, \"roll with me!\"' A week later, Cruise and Ms Canal, who bears a resemblance to his ex-wife Katie Holmes, were seen hand-in-hand as they giggled together at Battersea Power Station helipad in London.\n\nCruise affectionately helped the singer zip up her coat before escorting her off the runway.\n\nDays later, Ms Canal was his guest in the VIP area for Bruce Springsteen's concert at Wembley Stadium. After the gig, the pair met Springsteen backstage and posted a photograph taken with him on Instagram. Ms Canal, who plays piano and has also sung with the likes of Hozier and Leslie Odom Jr, has acknowledged that she and Cruise are close, saying he is the 'most random friend I have ever made.'\n\nShe was born in Munich and moved to Barcelona as a child. In 2015, Ms Canal headed to the US for her first tour but relocated to Amsterdam in 2021 following the pandemic.\n\nThen, Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin discovered her music after she shared a post online. He was later sent her Instagram profile by a friend.\n\nMartin introduced Ms Canal to his record label, Parlophone, and they signed her up. He described her track Swan Song as 'one of the best songs ever written'."
