        "text": "I am a healthcare communications leader with a proven track record of creating and delivering programmes with real impact.\n\nAs the world around us transforms, communications is moving on. I set up Curious Health to explore how we look at the world differently and ask, ‘how can we do this better, and with more impact?’\n\nWith 25 years’ experience in healthcare communications there aren’t many therapy areas I haven’t worked in. Cardiology, diabetes, immunology, oncology, vaccines and a range of consumer health categories. There also aren’t many challenges or issues I haven’t encountered and worked with clients to navigate. This means I’m good at simplifying complex situations to diagnose problems and work out cost effective solutions. My preferred way of working is in collaboration with others, particularly people with different perspectives and skills.\n\nMy personal areas of expertise include:\n\nConsulting with senior executives in organisations to ensure communications is at the heart of business strategy\n\nDevising a succinct communications plan that meets objectives and delivers on brand strategy\n\nBuilding relationships with stakeholders on behalf of clients, to deliver on a shared goal\n\nSpotting the emotional hook in a story that will move audiences and create impact\n\nMy career highlights include rebooting the UK health practice at WE Communications, joining the Board of Red Door Unlimited in 2005 at the age of 30 and being Highly Commended as Communications Leader at the Communique Awards in 2019. I now Co-Chair the Communique Awards, having served on the Steering Committee since 2018 and was a Cannes Lions Health and Wellness jury member in 2020/21.\n\nWhen I’m not working with clients, I’m learning a lot about youth culture from my 12-year-old, spending time by the sea in Camber, East Sussex and feeling nostalgic for all things northern and 90s.\n\nWhen done really well, communications will provoke responses, create impact and drive change. As the world around us transforms, communications is moving on. I set up Curious Health to explore how we look at the world differently and ask, ‘how can we do this better, and with more impact?’\n\nWith 25 years’ experience in healthcare communications there aren’t many therapy areas I haven’t worked in. But I think there is something just as valuable as experience; the ability to get to grips with a therapy area, stakeholder needs and the communications challenge by being inquisitive and asking questions. Experience can mean we make assumptions based on the way things used to be. If we learned anything since 2020 it’s that things change. Fast.\n\nI know can be guilty of doing things the way I’ve always done them. At Curious Health, we have created an environment where everyone feels comfortable to ask ‘why’? to build better programmes for our clients, and a better agency.\n\nAs a communications consultant with over 15 years of experience in healthcare communications, I am passionate about leading campaigns that truly resonate and drive change. Known and valued as an all-rounder, my career has included in-house, freelance and various agency roles, allowing me to develop an understanding of the power of communications from different perspectives, enabling me to do brilliant work for our clients.\n\nI’m a people person, good at reading the room and helping bring together various stakeholders in such a way that everyone feels they are part of something important. I do my best work when I can become an extension of my clients’ teams, fostering a collaborative environment that ensures a clear and committed communications strategy aligns seamlessly with the overall marketing plan.\n\nThroughout my career, I have worked with some of the largest pharmaceutical companies, such as AstraZeneca, Allergan, Novartis, LEO Pharma, and Janssen, as well as consumer health brands like Benecol and Cetaphil. I’ve also worked with not-for-profit clients such as the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and WellChild. While I have experience across major therapy areas, my particular interest and expertise lie in immunology dermatology and nutrition.\n\nAreas of particular expertise:\n\n– Communications strategy: developing approaches that marry external audiences’ needs with brand strategic imperatives\n\n– Storytelling: translating complex scientific concepts into everyday language that is accessible and engaging\n\n– Communications to support HTAs: developing communications strategies, stakeholder relationships and issues preparedness and management\n\nCareer highlights include becoming a BANT-registered nutritionist and successfully managing a busy clinical practice alongside my role as a freelance communications consultant. Leading two Communique award-winning campaigns (Excellence in Communication of Survey or Market Research Data and Excellence in Communications via a Live Event or Stand-Alone Activity). And, of course, co-founding Curious Health.\n\nOutside of work, you’ll find me in the spin studio trying to improve my functional power threshold, answering my son’s endless questions about outer space, or curled up with my well-loved and battle-worn Kindle.\n\nMore than ever, we’re being encouraged to ask questions in healthcare. Whether you’re a patient striving to take ownership of your treatment, or a healthcare professional pushing to make changes to an established way of doing things. Smart questions can be the start of big changes.\n\nI’ve spent all my working life in health, either as a communications consultant or a registered nutritionist. In both of these roles, the ability to take a step back and ask the right questions has been fundamental to delivering campaigns that change behaviours – whether that’s inside the consultation room with my nutrition clients, or in collaboration with my healthcare clients. I’m particularly proud of award-winning patient advocacy work I’ve done in immunology and chronic migraine. Throughout my career I’ve been known as someone who can be relied on to deliver, but also (I hope!) someone who is good fun to work with."
