        "text": "A light aircraft has crashed into a California golf course, narrowly missing a golfer.\n\nFootage of the crash, posted to X (formerly known as Twitter), shows the plane crashing into the practice green at the Haggins Oaks Golf Complex in Sacramento, California before sliding across the grass and hitting a pro shop. The incident occurred mid-afternoon on August 5.\n\nA golfer can be seen leaping out of the way to avoid being hit by the incoming aircraft.\n\nAccording to the Sacramento Fire Department, the plane took off from the nearby McClellan Air Force Base before experiencing a mechanical fault at 400ft. No one on the ground was injured and the pilot sustained only minor cuts.\n\nThe plane was a single-engine Piper PA-28, according to the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), who classified the crash as accidental. Newsweek has reached out to the FAA by email for further comment.\n\nIn a post to X, the Sacramento Fire Department said: \"Crews arrived to a plane that emergency landed on the golf course and came to rest up against the pro shop. The pilot had minor injuries and was able to walk away from this incident. No others were injured.\"\n\nNewsweek has emailed the Sacramento Fire Department for comment.\n\nCapt. Justin Sylvia of the Sacramento Fire Department told Fox News Digital that when the pilot lost power he decided to land at the golf course.\n\n\"He picked a golf course, which is a pretty good locationâ€”nice and open,\" said Sylvia.\n\nOne golfer, who heard the incident but did not see it, told FOX40: \"We heard a boom, but we didn't know what it was. This is a first. I guess cross it off my bucket list.\"\n\nSylvia also reported the Fire Department found the plane leaking fuel but not on fire.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook, the Haggins Oaks Golf Complex said: \"Earlier today, there was an unexpected plane crash on our golf course. Thankfully, no one was harmed, and the damage to the facility is minor. We are incredibly grateful to the first responders from the fire department and law enforcement for their swift and professional reaction.\"\n\nDue to clean up and safety precautions, the pro shop and club restaurant were closed for the remainder of the day. The rest of the golf club remained open.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Haggins Oaks Golf Complex via its website for comment.\n\nThe crash was just one of 26 aircraft incidents reported by the FAA for August 5. Of these incidents, five included Piper aircrafts.\n\nThe cause of the incident is under investigation by the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board."
