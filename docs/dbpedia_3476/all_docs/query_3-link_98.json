        "text": "Spanish police give autopsy update after body found in hunt for Jay Slater\n\nSpanish police issued an update after a body was found in the search for Jay Slater. Following weeks of desperate searching for the teenager in Tenerife, Spanish authorities issued a statement yesterday, July 15, confirming the discovery. It brought an end to the search for the missing 19-year-old, who vanished on Monday, June 17.\n\nHuman remains were reportedly found in the Masca area close to where Jay vanished, but the body has not yet been formally identified. The Civil Guard said: \"Everything is pointing to the body being that of the young British man who disappeared on June 17.\" They added initial inquiries are pointing to him \"having suffered an accident/fall in the area where he was found.\"\n\nA Civil Guard spokesman said an autopsy is still yet to be carried out. He added this will 'probably' take place this morning, Tuesday, July 16.\n\nIn a statement a spokesman said: \"After 29 constant days of searching the lifeless body of the young man has been found in the Masca area. The discovery has been possible thanks to the tireless and discreet search carried out by the Civil Guard over these 29 days.\n\nRead the full update here\n\nJay Slater: Every word of Spanish police statement after body found\n\nSpanish police have issued a statement after a body was found in the Jay Slater search. Authorities issued the major update today, Monday, July 15, after a month long search for the missing 19-year-old who vanished on Monday, June 17.\n\nJay, an apprentice bricklayer from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, had been on the island with two friends for a three-day music festival. The 19-year-old vanished on the morning of Monday, June 17 as he attempted to make his way back to the town of Los Christianos, where he was staying with his friends Lucy Law and Brad Hargreaves.\n\nA spokesman for the Civil Guard said today: “After 29 constant days of searching the lifeless body of the young man has been found in the Masca area. The discovery has been possible thanks to the tireless and discreet search carried out by the Civil Guard over these 29 days.\"\n\nRead the full statement here.\n\nSpanish police give 'initial' cause of death for body found in Jay Slater hunt\n\nThe Spanish Civil Guard has given an \"initial\" suspected cause of death for a body found in the search for Jay Slater. The 19-year-old, from Lancashire, was last seen four weeks ago on the island of Tenerife.\n\nEmergency services, followed by Jay's family and friends, and volunteers, searched tirelessly for Jay after he disappeared from the village of Masca. In an update today, Monday, Spanish police confirmed a body had been found in the Masca area, adding that everything pointed to the body being that of the young British man who disappeared on June 17.\n\nThe body has not yet been identified. The Civil Guard said its \"initial inquiries are pointing to him having suffered an accident/fall in the area where he was found.\n\nAuthorities issued the major update bringing an end to the search for the missing 19-year-old who vanished on Monday, June 17. Jay, an apprentice bricklayer, had been on the island with two friends for a three-day music festival.\n\nFull story here.\n\nBody found\n\nA body has been found in the search for British teenager Jay Slater who disappeared on holiday in Tenerife.\n\nA spokesman for the Civil Guard said today: “After 29 constant days of searching the lifeless body of the young man has been found in the Masca area. The discovery has been possible thanks to the tireless and discreet search carried out by the Civil Guard over these 29 days.\n\n“Everything is pointing to the body being that of the young British man who disappeared on June 17, pending full identification. Initial inquiries are pointing to him having suffered an accident/fall in the area where he was found.”\n\nAuthorities issued the major update bringing an end to the search for the missing 19-year-old who vanished on Monday, June 17. Jay, an apprentice bricklayer from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, had been on the island with two friends for a three-day music festival.\n\nFull story here.\n\nNew Jay Slater search team heads to Tenerife 'committed' to finding missing teen\n\nA specialist search team is set to help find Jay Slater as it approaches a month since the teenager was last seen in Tenerife.\n\nThe BBC reported that non-profit Signi Zoekhonden, based in the Netherlands, is sending over a group of five specialist volunteers and four dogs to the Canary Island, with a sixth person to join on Monday. Jay, from Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire has been missing on the Canary Island since June 17.\n\nAfter the local police halted their search efforts on Sunday, June 30, the family looked further afield for help finding Jay. The 19-year-old partied at a nightclub in the south of Tenerife before leaving with two men and staying with them at an Airbnb in Masca.\n\nHe left the accommodation and after missing a bus told a friend that he was going to try and walk back to where he had been staying in the south - a trek that would take about 11 hours - before his battery went dead. Nothing has been seen or heard of him since.\n\nOn Sunday, July 14, Marieke Krans, one of the volunteers flying to the Canary Island, discussed the search mission with the BBC from Brussels Airport. She told the corporation they will use drones in the search subject to flight permission from local authorities.\n\nShe told the BBC: \"We are very committed to come and we are confident in the dogs and in ourselves. Our dogs are trained to find people, both alive or dead, and have more skills. They can search underwater, and up mountains, whatever it may be.\"\n\nFull story here\n\nJay Slater's dad says they 'need an army'\n\nWarren Slater, Jay Slater's dad, has said the family will not stop as they continue the search. Warren Slater, and Jay’s brother Zak, have been hiking through the treacherous mountains in Tenerife every day desperately trying to find the 19-year-old.\n\nReturning to the Valley of Barranco de Juan Lopez, close to the village of Masca, where Jay’s phone last pinged three-and-a-half weeks ago, Warren told The Mirror: “We are still out looking. What more can we possibly do?\n\n“I’ve said before, I need an army to help me. People don’t understand the vastness of it.” Looking out over the treacherous rocks, brambles and cacti he said: “I’d love to be able to fly a drone and sit here all day scouring the whole area. Why would you go down there? Why leave the road?” He believes someone must have spotted his son as he walked up the road from the village of Masca. “When we came on Monday we must have passed 200 cars going up those hills.”\n\nWho is Mark Williams-Thomas?\n\nMark Williams-Thomas was a police officer with Surrey Police. In recnet years he has made his name for his work as an investigative journalist. He was the lead investigator on the ITV Exposure documentary, The Other Side of Jimmy Savile.\n\nHe joined the hunt for Jay after reaching out to Jay’s mum Debbie Duncan, 55, offering his help free-of-charge, which she accepted.\n\nHe travelled to the island on June 24, where he was seen carrying out inquiries at the holiday rental, as well as at Papagayo nightclub, where Jay had been seen shortly before he vanished.\n\nThe investigator has also been given access to Jay's family and friends, including close pals Brad Hargreaves, 19, and Lucy Mae Law, 18, who were both with Jay on the holiday. Mr Williams-Thomas today said his thoughts \"remain with Jay's family and friends\".\n\nMr Williams-Thomas has criticised internet rumours about the case, describing them as a mix of \"wild speculation\", \"elements of the truth\", \"but overwhelmingly many are just made up\". He has also issued a new appeal for information and asked anyone searching for Jay to share information on areas they have covered.\n\nHe said: \"We've now had the opportunity to speak to all the people that we know leading up to his disappearance. However there are still people we have not yet spoken to and I would urge them to get in contact so they can be ruled out of the investigation.\n\n\"We have a number of outstanding actions that still require completing and we remain open-minded with our investigation. We are uniquely placed. We've spoken to nearly all the key witnesses to cross-check their accounts and evidence, thus building the clearest picture.\"\n\nHe added: \"I would appeal to anyone who had contact with Jay in the last 48 hours before his disappearance to please get in touch. I would like to appeal again to any parties involved in their own searches to share their data with us so we can compile an accurate map showing the areas that still need searching.\"\n\n'Significant new Jay Slater information' passed to police\n\nA former detective who is helping the family of missing Jay Slater in Tenerife said he has received \"significant new information\" about the 19-year-old's disappearance.\n\nMark Williams-Thomas flew to the Spanish island on Tuesday, June 25, eight days after Jay was last seen in the village of Masca. He said he had reached out to Jay's mum, Debbie Duncan, and offered to help.\n\nOn Friday morning, July 12, Mr Williams-Thomas said: \"We know now that Jay took certain actions while at the rental because he was clearly worried about his own safety. This was shortly before he decided to leave.\n\nNo further information about what the new clue is was given, the Mirror reports. He had previously spoken out about how Jay, 19, had told pals he couldn't go back to the property, which he had travelled to with two older British men before his disappearance.\n\nThe apprentice bricklayer was last seen leaving their Airbnb rental, named Casa Abuela Tina, in Masca, at around 8am on June 17.\n\nIn his latest update today, Mr Williams-Thomas said: \"On the morning of the 17th of June on arrival back to the rental, Jay spoke to a number of different people on his phone and they have described him as very much awake and still buzzing. We know Jay was on his phone and alone at 8.50am on Monday the 17th of June walking on a track just off the main road about 30 minutes walk from the apartment.\n\n\"It was a cold damp morning only 18 degrees, with a high that day only reaching 20. The evidence we have been able to collect, including the significant new intelligence, strongly supports that Jay is therefore most likely to be in or around the mountains, we suspect some distance from the last phone location.\"\n\nSpanish police have said the two British men, who were both spoken to by Spanish officers before leaving the island, have no relevance to the missing persons investigation.\n\nYou can read the full story here.\n\nJay Slater donations pour in as his family moves to new area\n\nOn Monday, July 8, Jay's brother, Zak, and dad, Warren, appear to have widened their own personal search, as they were spotted in Santiago del Teide, a mountain village on the outskirts of the Teno Rural Park.\n\nIt was higher up in the park, close to Masca, that Jay Slater's mobile phone signal was last believed to have been positioned before he went missing. Earlier on Monday Zak and Warren had searched higher in the mountains in the Los Carrizales valley.\n\nGoFundMe donations have flooded in today, with the amount raised at £51,890 at the time of publication. Earlier this week Jay's mum Debbie Duncan said donations will be used to support volunteers helping to find her son in Tenerife.\n\nDebbie thanked the “vast” generosity of donors, saying her family are “grateful for all of your support and kindness during this unimaginable time”.\n\nMs Duncan wrote that part of the funds will be used to support volunteers hunting for Jay, and that the remaining money is to be used to support rescue teams, as well as her family’s “own expenses as we remain in Tenerife looking for our boy”.\n\nJay Slater: People urged to search outbuildings where teenager went missing\n\nLocals in Tenerife have been asked to search their outbuildings and land in the area of Tenerife where Jay Slater went missing.\n\nFormer British police detective Mark Williams-Thomas, who has been helping Jay Slater's family in Tenerife, has claimed Jay Slater was \"scared\" when he left an Airbnb and had allegedly \"taken a £12,000 Rolex\" before he disappeared.\n\nMr Williams-Thomas suggested that Jay might have gone back to the Airbnb to charge his phone and grab some water, but apparently decided against it. The ex-detective also mentioned that Jay had 'posted a Snapchat saying that he'd taken a £12,000 Rolex from a person'.\n\n\"We've been unable to validate this in terms of a reported theft\" he stated in the footage. \"However, friends of Jay said he would not make this up and the watch was subject of later conversation between the friends.\"\n\nHe outlined the last known activities of the teenager, saying: \"The evidence is that Jay walked off on the rental, walked for about 30 minutes, and then sent his location at 8.49am and 8.50am. And we know that he was at that stage off the road on a track with loose stones.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I want to make an appeal for landowners in the area of the rural park to check any outbuildings and land that they have in the hope that further searches will continue by volunteers in the area not yet searched.\"\n\nYou can read the full story here.\n\n'Scared' Jay Slater 'took £12k Rolex' before he disappeared, claims TV detective\n\nA former detective has claimed Jay Slater was \"scared\" when he left an Airbnb and had allegedly \"taken a £12,000 Rolex\" before he disappeared.\n\nMark Williams-Thomas, renowned for investigating several high-profile missing persons cases, has now indicated that the teen must have been \"feeling scared\" upon departing the accommodation on that Monday morning. In a video recorded yesterday (July 2) and shared on X, previously known as Twitter, today, the investigator remarked: \"We've received information that would suggest that Jay left the rental property feeling scared and he would not return to the rental, even though that would have been the most sensible course of action.\"\n\nJay's friend Lucy Law, said that during his last phone call to her, he mentioned \"he was in the middle of nowhere, trying to get home with no water and 1 per cent on his phone battery\". That conversation turned out to be the final contact anyone had with him.\n\nYou can read the full story here.\n\nWhat we know\n\nJay Slater is still missing. The 19 year-old apprentice bricklayer was on holiday attending the NRG Music Festival in the Spanish island of Tenerife.\n\nHe was there with two friends Lucy Law and Brad Hargreaves. on Sunday, June 16, he was out with his friend Lucy who he was attending the festival with. Lucy decided to head home to the resort they were staying in, just outside Playa de las Americas. Meanwhile, the two men Jay met, who reportedly didn't attend the festival, had hired a car to allow them to travel easily to their rented holiday home, located just outside the village of Masca on the side of a mountain in the Rural de Teno national park. This is around a 10 hour walk from Playa de las Americas.\n\nIt was at this cottage that Jay was last seen, with the landlord, Ofelia Medina Hernandez, saying she had explained to Jay when the next bus was to arrive after he missed it.\n\nYet he chose to continue on foot, and she described him as \"walking alone, and fast\". Jay called Lucy shortly before 8am on that fateful Monday morning to say that his phone battery was down to one per cent, and that he had no idea where he was.\n\nAfter a two week-search in the island, the search involiving mountain rescue experts, sniffer dogs, a helicopter and volunteers, was called off on Sunday, June 30.\n\nHowever, Spanish police have said officers would continue to act on any tip-offs or other information received. Jay's parents are still in contact with the Spanish Police and were pictured leaving a Tenerife police station yesterday. After the meeting, his mum Debbie said: \"We don't know anything about the investigation. We're leaving it to the police.\"\n\nA Spanish judge has stated there is currently no evidence of criminality in relation to the case. Mayor Emilio Navarro, the local mayor, has said the police are continuing 'several lines of inquiry'.\n\nIn her first public statement after the search for her son was called off, Debbie said: \"We are a very close family and are absolutely devastated about his disappearance. Words cannot describe the pain and agony we are experiencing. He is our beautiful boy with his whole life ahead of him and we just want to find him.\n\n\"We do not have any information on his whereabouts. The Guardia Civil have worked tirelessly up in the mountains where Jay's last phone call was traced.\n\n\"They conducted a land search for 12 days which involved every resource they had available. Although the land search ended, the Spanish police still continue with their investigations into why Jay had travelled to the location so far away from his accommodation.\"\n\nJay Slater's mum issues gutting statement about her 'beautiful boy'\n\nThe mum of Jay Slater has given a gutting statement about her 'beautiful boy' after the search for the teen was called off.\n\nDebbie Duncan has now given her first public comment since the search ended. Speaking via the British overseas missing persons charity LBT Global, she said: \"My son, Jay Dean Slater, came to the holiday island of Tenerife on the 13th of June with his friend to attend a music festival.\n\n\"On the 17th of June after not returning to his apartment he was reported as a missing person. Jay is a normal guy who is in his 3rd year of an apprenticeship, and he is a very popular young man with a large circle of friends.\n\n\"We are a very close family and are absolutely devastated about his disappearance. Words cannot describe the pain and agony we are experiencing. He is our beautiful boy with his whole life ahead of him and we just want to find him.\"\n\nDebbie praised the efforts of the police in Spain and said that their investigation is still ongoing into what has happened. She added: \"We do not have any information on his whereabouts. The Guardia Civil have worked tirelessly up in the mountains where Jay's last phone call was traced.\n\n\"They conducted a land search for 12 days which involved every resource they had available. Although the land search ended, the Spanish police still continue with their investigations into why Jay had travelled to the location so far away from his accommodation.\"\n\nJay Slater 'long night' update as Paul Arnott zones in on 'broken sunglasses' and 'GPS coordinates'\n\nTikTok star and amateur climber Paul Arnott has issued an update as he carries on his search for missing Jay Slater in Tenerife.\n\nThe 29-year-old is believed to be working for missing Jay's family and has carried on his search close to Masca, where Jay, 19, was last seen on Monday, June 17. Yesterday, Monday, Mr Arnott, from Bedfordshire, said he was focusing on two new leads, including a set of GPS coordinates and the discovery of a broken pair of sunglasses that resembled a pair Jay had previously been seen wearing.\n\nHowever, it has not been confirmed that the eyewear has any connection to the missing teen.

Yesterday, he said he was foccussed on two new leads, including a set of GPS co-ordinates and the discovery of a broken pair of sunglasses that resemble a pair Jay had previously been seen wearing.\n\nHowever, it has not been confirmed that the eyewear has any connection to the missing teen. Jay, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancs, had been partying at Papagayo nightclub in Playa Las Americas the night before he vanished.\n\nShortly after Papagayo Beach Club closed in the early hours of Monday morning - where Jay was pictured partying - a fight broke out involving a man who allegedly had a valuable Rolex watch stolen. According to MailOnline, one of Slater's friends, who had travelled to Tenerife to join the search for him, suggested to police that it could have led to Jay going missing.\n\nIt is not clear how the incident could be linked to the teen's disappearance, though there is an unsubstantiated theory that the Rolex somehow ended up in the rural mountainous region where Jay vanished.\n\nJay Slater's mum makes plea to Spanish police\n\nThe mum of Jay Slater held talks with Spanish police after the search for the missing teenager was called off.\n\nThe search for Jay, undertaken by police, search and rescue teams and volunteers, was called off at the weekend but the case is being investigated.\n\nThe apprentice bricklayer's heartbroken parents Debbie and Warren spoke to officers in a bid to get answers about their investigation, which remains open and active. A source close to the family said: “The family want to be sure the police aren’t giving up on Jay. They are in constant contact with them about the case.”\n\nFormer British police detective Mark Williams-Thomas, who is helping the family, had earlier revealed: “They have been talking to the police most days and are speaking to them again today.”\n\nThe summit, which is believed to have taken place by phone, came as detectives announced they have found no evidence of a crime in relation to Jay's disappearance and are treating it as a missing persons inquiry.\n\nYou can read the full story here."
