        "text": "Lottie Williams & Co.\n\nLocation:\n\nTheater:\n\nDate:\n\nType:\n\nWhile I felt that Miss Williams would have some drawing power, I didn’t expect we were going to get the splendid sketch which she promised, which, in some respects, resembles the Rose Stahl “Chorus Lady” sketch, altho [sic] on an entirely different theme. The play is well-written and excellently acted by Miss Williams and the members of her company. Acts of this kind are of far more value to this house, and I believe to the average vaudeville theatre, than all the George Beban or other serious sketches that were ever written. 20 Min. F.S.\n\nSource:\n\nUniversity of Iowa, Keith-Albee Vaudeville Collection, Manager Reports, 25 October 1909-30 May 1910"
