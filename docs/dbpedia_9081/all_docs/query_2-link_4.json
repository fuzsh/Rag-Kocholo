        "text": "People of Manila\n\ninManila\n\nMetropolitan Manila is densely populated and contains a significant proportion of the population of the country. This concentration of people has been brought about by a constant rural-urban migration. The strain on municipal services has had an adverse effect on the quality of life in the urban area. Consequently, various government policies and resettlement projects have been implemented in an effort to address the problem of population density.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 18, 2024, 8:56 PM ET (Deutsche Welle)\n\nChinese, Philippine ships collide in South China Sea\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 6:34 AM ET (South China Morning Post)\n\nChina vows ‘strong measures’ against Philippines in South China Sea\n\nAug. 15, 2024, 12:35 PM ET (South China Morning Post)\n\nPhilippine coastguard ship ‘heading for disputed South China Sea reef’\n\nAug. 14, 2024, 5:34 AM ET (South China Morning Post)\n\nThousands jam streets as Philippines holds parade for 2-gold Paris gymnast Yulo\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 3:34 AM ET (South China Morning Post)\n\nHow will Manila answer as Beijing shifts its South China Sea tactics to the sky?\n\nAlmost all the residents of Manila are Filipinos. The largest single foreign community, representing less than one-tenth of the population, is made up of Chinese. The population of the city is predominantly Roman Catholic, although there are some Protestants, Muslims, and Buddhists. The two national churches—the Iglesia ni Kristo and the Philippine Independent, or Aglipayan, Church—have small congregations.\n\nEconomy\n\nManufacturing\n\nThe diverse manufacturing activities of Manila include textile production, publishing and printing, food and tobacco processing, and chemical processing. Manila also produces lumber and wood items, rope and cordage, soap, and other goods. Factories generally are small and are located mostly in the congested districts of Tondo (which also has the railroad and truck terminals), Binondo, and Santa Cruz. Heavy industries are located in the districts of Paco, Pandacan, and Santa Ana.\n\nFinance and other services\n\nManila is the centre of trade and finance in the Philippines. Trade flourishes within the metropolitan area and between the city and the provinces and other countries. Most of the Philippines’ imports and exports pass through the port of Manila. Financial institutions headquartered in Manila include such establishments as the Development Bank of the Philippines, the Philippine National Bank, the Philippine Veterans Bank, the Government Service Insurance System, the Social Security System, and many private commercial and developmental banks. Private insurance companies and the Philippine Stock Exchange also contribute to the mobilization of savings for investment.\n\nTransportation\n\nWithin the area of Metropolitan Manila, public transportation is provided principally by buses, jeepneys (small buses built on the chassis of jeeps), and taxis. Traffic congestion is serious, especially at the bridges during the morning and evening rush hours. Adjacent towns serve as dormitory suburbs, and many people commute to the city, adding to the traffic problem. Authorities attempted to address this issue with a “number coding” scheme that restricted access to metro Manila roads at peak times based on the last digit of a driver’s license plate. Bus services operate routes to northern and southern Luzon.\n\nRailroad services operated by the Philippine National Railways also connect the city with northern and southeastern Luzon. An elevated rail line, linking Caloocan City and the city of Baclaran (to the south of Pasay City), was completed in 1984. It was the first phase of a transit system, called the Light Rail Transit, that by the early 21st century had lines extending throughout much of the metropolitan area.\n\nInterisland and international transportation is provided by domestic and foreign airlines and by shipping. Manila South Harbor, with its enclosed customhouse, warehouses, and sheds, is sheltered by a low breakwater. There are no railway lines within the port area, and cargo is transported from the piers by trucks or barges. The piers and warehouses of Manila North Harbor are busy with heavy traffic from all ports in the Philippines. In the 1980s additional port facilities for international shipping were built, partially on reclaimed land, in the area between the two harbours.\n\nAdministration and society\n\nGovernment\n\nMetropolitan Manila is administered by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA). Within the MMDA is an administrative council consisting of the mayors of each of the constituent cities and municipalities as well as a number of other officials. The Sangguniang Bayan (Municipal Assembly) of each city or municipality helps in administration and legislation. It is composed of the mayor, vice mayor, councillors, captains of barangays (neighbourhoods), and representatives from other sectors who are appointed by the president upon recommendation of the local unit.\n\nMunicipal services\n\nPotable water comes from a supply network managed by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. Satisfactory sanitation conditions are maintained by constant surveillance of markets, restaurants, movie theatres, recreation halls, and slaughterhouses. Insecticides are sprayed regularly on open sewers, uncollected garbage, and standing water; garbage is collected by a fleet of trucks that operate night and day. Moreover, workers maintain cleanliness in the metropolitan area and are also responsible for the beautification of the city as directed by the governor of Metropolitan Manila.\n\nHealth and security\n\nHealth facilities in Manila are among the best in the region. The city government maintains numerous health centres as well as San Lazaro Hospital, where patients are treated free of charge, and subsidizes a number of government hospitals. There are also many missionary and private hospitals in the city.\n\nPolice and fire services are well organized and well supplied, and personnel are comparatively well trained and well paid. The Police Community Relations Group helps to combat local crime, as do barangay brigades and barangay tanods (guards) throughout Metropolitan Manila. Members of those groups are volunteers and selected leaders of the barangays who aim to maintain peace and order in their communities.\n\nEducation\n\nNearly all citizens over age 10 are literate. More than 100 free public schools are maintained, in addition to the night vocational and secondary schools and the Manila branch of the University of the Philippines. Educational opportunities are also provided for children with disabilities, orphans of school age, and adults.\n\nAs the education centre of the Philippines, Metropolitan Manila houses many of the major institutions of higher education of the country, including the University of the Philippines (with its main campus in Quezon City), the Philippine Normal University, and the Technological University of the Philippines. There are several universities sponsored by religious bodies, including the University of Santo Tomas (founded in 1611) and the Ateneo de Manila, as well as nonsectarian institutions such as the University of the East and the Far Eastern University.\n\nCultural life\n\nThe centre of the performing arts in the country is the Philippine Cultural Center. There is also the Folk Arts Theater, facing Manila Bay, the renovated historic Metropolitan Theatre, and an open-air theatre in Rizal Park. The many libraries and museums include the National Library and the National Museum, known for its anthropological and archaeological exhibits; the National Institute of Science and Technology, with a scientific reference library and large collections of plants and animals; the geological museum of the Bureau of Mines and Geosciences; the Planetarium; Fort Santiago, which houses original works of the Philippine patriot José Rizal; and the Kamaynilaan (Manila City) Library and Museum, which contains valuable carvings, paintings, and archives.\n\nThe foremost outdoor recreational area is Rizal Park, with a Japanese garden, a Chinese garden, an open-air theatre, a playground, a grandstand, and a long promenade adjacent to Manila Bay. Other areas include the Manila Zoological and Botanical Gardens, the Mehan Garden, and Paco Park. Athletic facilities include the Rizal Memorial Stadium and the Jai-Alai Fronton, both located in Manila, and the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. Annual festivals and carnivals are held in the sunken garden fronting the City Hall of Manila."
