Eligible foreigners may apply for the waiver at the Bureau of Immigrationâs (BI) e-services portal at https://e-services.immigration.gov.ph.\n\nThe cruise terminal is located at pier 4 within walking distance of Old Manila (by Rizal Park). The locals will be putting on a nice welcoming party on the pier, not only for the passengers but also for the Filipino crew on your ship. If your cabin attendant is Filipino, it is a nice gesture to give him/her the day off.\n\nOriginally scheduled to open in August 2021, Solaire is a luxury cruise centre located within an integrated resort. Upon completion, the cruise port will accommodate two mega-size cruise ships simultaneously, one berth for vessels up to 365mtr and one for vessels up to 345mtr, in a linear berth configuration. Expected to be ready in 2024.\n\nAt times pier 15 may be used.\n\nPrintable map to take along.\n\nCruise calendar for this port.\n\nCheck here for festivals and events in Manila when you are in port.\n\nWatch a destination video.\n\nLive Nautical Chart with Wikipedia Markers\n\nPort Location on Google Maps\n\nMonthly Climate Averages for Manila Philippines\n\nHotels near the Cruise Terminal\n\nSightseeing:\n\nUp until World War II, Manila was considered the most beautiful city in Asia but the war put the city into complete ruins. It was the second most destroyed city after Warsaw, Poland. But this modern capital-city is the premier Christian city of Asia and considered as one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world with a population of over 1.5 million people.\n\nHistoric, bustling, awe-inspiring, Manila is a blend of cultures and flavors that offers an endless serving of places to see, sights to behold, and experiences to never forget.\n\nManila Cathedral Dating from 1571, this is the sixth cathedral on this site and the only church to be rebuilt after the war. The cathedral is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. Main features are the octagonal dome and the impressive stained-glass windows.\n\nThe National Museum The museum collection totals more than one million items from the fields of anthropology, art, botany, geology and zoology. As the museum is in the process of being relocated, only a limited amount of the collection is on display.\n\nManila was a colony of Spain from 1565 all the way until 1898. From that point in time the United States occupied and controlled the Philippines (as a territory), until 1946. Because of its history, the Philippines still has may influences from, and ties to, the West.\n\nTours Excursions Transportation:\n\nWhen in Manila, get around as the ManileÃ±os do-via the colorful, ubiquitous jeepneys. These \"kings of the road\" not only get you almost everywhere around the city on a minimal fare, they also provide insights into the Filipino psyche and allow a liberal glimpse of pop art.\n\nTaxi: Taxis are available in cities and in many towns. Make sure meters are used, as some taxi drivers will set an exorbitant and arbitrary rate.\n\nPopular shore excursions at this Cruise Port include city tours (usually focusing on either the historic Old Manila section of the city or the more modern sections of the city) and boat trips to the island-fortress of Corregidor. Corregidor is an island located right in the entrance of Manila Bay. Over the years it has been the location of many important battles in the history of the Philippines, and is a popular tourist attraction today.\n\nIt pays to compare your cruise line tours here.\n\nNearby Places:\n\nThe city of Tagaytay is located about 55 km (about a 90-minute drive) from Manila. It's a popular tourist destination during the summer, because of its cooler temperature (because of its high elevation) and great views of Taal Lake and the Taal Volcano.\n\nMarikina, which is about 21 km from Manila, is one of the cleanest and urbanized cities in the Philippines. It's known as the \"Shoe Capital of the Philippines\" because of its well known shoe industry, and is a really charming place to visit. The Shoe Museum houses a lot of shoes and is an interesting place to check out. SM City Marikina is a huge shopping mall, located by the Riverbanks Center in Marikina.\n\nShopping and Food\n\nA foray into the shopping malls and commercial complexes, bazaars and markets can be both exhilarating and exhausting. Local products range from arts and crafts, ready-to-wear apparel and knitwear, shoes, bags and fashion accessories to fine Philippine embroidery. Bargaining is generally accepted in the open markets and bazaars.\n\nMore than just a Mall, the SM Mall Of Asia is a tourist destination that has raised the standard of shopping, leisure and entertainment in the Philippines.\n\nTry the experience of the Dampa Seafood Market on Malapagal, buy your own seafood and bring it to one of the restaurants just behind it to have it cooked the way you want.\n\nThere is a free shuttle bus from the pier to Robinsonâs Place shopping center.\n\nCurrency:\n\nThe local currency is the Philippine peso.\n\nAmerican Express, Diners Club, MasterCard and Visa are widely accepted in major establishments throughout the big cities of the Philippines. ATMs are available.\n\nCurrency Converter\n\nCommunication:\n\nMost Filipinos speak English well, no matter their level of education.\n\nOpening Hours and Holidays:\n\n1 Jan - New Year's Day\n\n24 Feb - Edsa Revolution Day\n\n9 Apr - Bataan Day (Araw ng Kagitingan)\n\nMaundy Thursday\n\nGood Friday\n\n5 May - Labour Day\n\n16 Jun - Independence Day\n\n31 Aug -National Heroes' Day\n\n2 Oct - Eid Ul Fitr (exact date varies)\n\n1 Nov - All Saints' Day\n\n30 Nov - Bonifacio Day\n\n25 Dec -Christmas Day\n\n30 Dec - Rizal Day\n\n31 Dec - New Year's Eve\n\nHelp us to keep this page up to date: Mail us your suggestions\n\nThank you for printing this article!
