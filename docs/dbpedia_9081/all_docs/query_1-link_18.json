        "text": "Since more than a decade, outsourcing has had a major impact on how business is done and now companies are finding ways to maximize the profit from outsourcing. Calling the outsourcing business revolutionary would be an understatement, as business process outsourcing to countries such as Philippines and India has had a massive impact on businesses worldwide. Philippines in fact is one of the fastest growing countries in the world as far as BPO is concerned and the call center industry is its crowning jewel. Today, Philippines on its own covers 15% of the global outsourcing market and has more than 1.7 million employed people with different skill sets.\n\nDespite the global economic slowdown, the call center industry in Philippines is chugging right along and ensuring that people have healthy jobs which pay well and allow the country to have such a dynamic, youth-driven economy.\n\nWhy is Philippines the BPO Capital of the World?\n\nToday, mostly owing to call centers, the Philippines BPO industry has a total revenue of close to $23 billion and is currently growing at a rate of 16%. Compared to the world-famous Indian BPO industry, these are impressive numbers and can easily rise to $40 billion by 2022, replacing overseas-based Filipino worker (OFW) remittances as the top contribution to the nation's economy. According to a recent revelation by the government-sponsored job search sit PhilJobNet, call center jobs account for more than 17% of the daily listings posted, higher than any other job category.\n\nSome of the main reasons why Philippines is the BPO capital of the world include the following -\n\nExceptional Literacy Rate\n\nThe Philippines produces more than 450,000 graduates annually and has more than a 95% literacy rate owing to that reason. With an employment pool adding up to 38 million, and with specializations across call center BPO, accountancy, etc. Filipinos are qualified to work for BPO jobs including call centers, which is a big advantage for potential investors.\n\nCost-effective solutions\n\nLabor costs in the Philippines are very low compared to most western countries, and while they are still high compared to India, most western companies find it at the perfect nexus of cost-to-skill ratio. The quality of labor provided by the BPO sector in the Philippines, worlds call center capital is much higher compared to other such outsourcing destinations, therefore serving as a cost-effective solution.\n\nProgressive Government Policies\n\nApart from offering TESDA courses to train people in call center and other BPO jobs, the government has also set up new subdivisions such as the Department of Information and Communications Technology to provide further support to the BPO sector. Also, since many western companies take data security extremely seriously, the government helped to revise the Data Security Act and the SEZ Act to ensure the clients always remained satisfied with regulations which then comply to international data privacy standards.\n\nNeutral Accent\n\nA small, but an extremely important reason why is Philippines the BPO capital of the world is because compared to other BPO giants around the world, the country has more than 93% proficiency in English speaking, thanks to a rich history of interaction with other English-speaking nations. Because the people are accent-neutral, the call center employees find it easier to connect with the customers, while also being aware of American idioms and slangs as compared to their counterparts in India.\n\nFactors Which Helped Philippines to Become the Call Center Capital of the World\n\nMost of the call centers in Philippines service international clients who transfer the work offshore for two main reasons - better customer service and lower costs. Since most of the call centers work in shifts they can assure 24/7 support to the international companies, while charging a fraction of the costs. Call center employees earn good pay as well, earning almost double the average salary of a bank teller in Manila, further ensuring that a lot of young talent decides to take up a call center job.\n\nSome of the main factors leading to the Philippines becoming the call center capital of the world include -\n\nChallenges Ahead of the Filipino Call Center Industry\n\nToday, most outsourcing companies want to standardize their processes and solutions. Recent events caused due to global crisis has led to companies choosing standardized solutions instead of custom-made ones. That is a big reason why countries such as the Philippines have met with so much success in the field of BPO and call center outsourcing. At the same time, there are a few challenges which need to be met within the coming few years to meet market expectations. While not significant, these challenges could soon grow out of proportion if not handled carefully and therefore need to be addressed.
