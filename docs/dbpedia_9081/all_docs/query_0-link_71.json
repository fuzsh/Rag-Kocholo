This may be needed for your travel insurance if you have a pre-existing medical condition.\n\nIf you are not up-to-date with your routine vaccinations or if the doctor believes you may be at an increased risk of contracting a vaccine-preventable disease, then they may recommend you get a booster or be revaccinated against a particular disease.\n\nSources & Citations\n\n5.

Facilities in other areas may vary. So, it is important you are prepared before heading off on your trip.\n\nSee your doctor at least a month before departure to discuss your travel health requirements.\n\nBefore travelling:\n\nRegister your trip with Smart Traveller\n\nEnsure you’re up-to-date with your routine vaccinations\n\nMake sure you have enough of your regular prescription medicines\n\nTake out travel insurance to cover you and your family for medical and other costs resulting from unexpected incidents and accidents\n\nPut together a travel kit with paracetamol and aspirin, diarrhoeal medicine, oral rehydration salts, antiseptic lotion or ointment, adhesive bandages and other wound dressings, insect repellent, sunscreen, latex gloves, thermometer, motion sickness medicine, and water purification tablets\n\nDuring travel:\n\nThe tap water in the Philippines is not safe to drink. Drink bottled or filtered water only and check the plastic seal on bottled water is intact (some stores have been known to sell boiled water in recycled bottles). Avoid adding ice to your drinks, and check that salad and fruit have been washed with filtered water prior to consumption.\n\nAvoid mosquito bites, as insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and Japanese encephalitis are quite common in the Philippines. You can protect yourself with insect repellent, wearing clothes that cover your arms and legs, and staying in accommodation that has fly nets or screens provided.\n\nAvoid animal bites. Rabies is a deadly disease and considered a risk in the Philippines. It is spread by the bite, lick or scratch of an infected animal, such as a dog or a monkey. Vaccinations for rabies are available – your doctor can advise whether vaccinations are required for your trip.\n\nUse condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, hepatitis B and AIDS.\n\nSources & Citations\n\n5.
