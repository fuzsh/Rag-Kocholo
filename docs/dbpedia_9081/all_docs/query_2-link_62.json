        "text": "Districts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city was named after former Philippine president Manuel Luis Quezon y Molina. Quezon City was the country's capital from 1946 until 1972, when the seat of government was returned to neighboring Manila. Quezon City consists of five districts. Administratively, the city is divided into 127 barangays that are generally used in addresses and for official purposes; in addition, there are also a number of traditional areas, like Cubao, Diliman, New Manila, etc., that have since been subdivided but are still commonly used in addresses and when giving directions. For the purposes of this guide, these can be broadly grouped into seven districts.\n\nCubao\n\nThe commercial heart of the city, centered on the sprawling Araneta City (formerly Araneta Center), with its many malls and condominiums. This area is considered the modern \"downtown\" of Quezon City, and is also a major transport hub, with various options available to the rest of Metro Manila and even to other parts of the Philippines.\n\nDiliman and Katipunan (Commonwealth, Diliman, Katipunan Avenue)\n\nThis area is home to a very large transient student population, being home to the University of the Philippines and Ateneo de Manila University campuses, as well as several other educational institutions. Near the two universities is Maginhawa Street, a food district popular with students. Between the two universities is Katipunan Avenue, home to a lot of establishments frequented by students.\n\nTriangle and Scout Areas\n\nThe bustling heart of Quezon City, filled with people all day and all night. Major city and national government offices are clustered around the Quezon Memorial Circle, while the restaurants, bars and nightclubs along Tomas Morato Avenue are among the best Metro Manila has to offer, both to locals and tourists alike.\n\nNorthern Quezon City (Balintawak, Novaliches, Project 8, Project 9)\n\nThe Commonwealth and Fairview districts are primarily residential. This area hosts the La Mesa Watershed Reservation, Metro Manila's only remaining natural rainforest and the primary source of the city's drinking water. Shopping malls are primarily clustered in the northern part of Fairview, while to the south along Commonweath Avenue are sights as varied as the Batasang Pambansa, various government offices, the central temple of the Iglesia ni Cristo and even the city's old landfill. Northwestern Quezon City is the birthplace of the Philippine Revolution. Today it is a busy commercial district, with Balintawak's bustling public market, the up-and-coming Cloverleaf mixed-use development nearby, and the many restaurants along Congressional Avenue.\n\nSoutheast Quezon City\n\nLargely residential, this area is mostly known for hosting the headquarters of the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines, where the People Power Revolution took place nearby in 1986. To the east is Eastwood City, a large mixed-use development popular with the upper classes.\n\nWestern Quezon City\n\nOn the La Loma area are its famous row of Filipino restaurants and lechon stores. Santa Mesa Heights is a mid-class area, with two major Roman Catholic shrines and prestigious Catholic schools. Near the boundary with Manila and San Juan lies the supposedly haunted location of Balete Drive, the car part stalls and Chinatown area along Banaue Street, and the row of funeral homes along Araneta Avenue. At the center of New Manila are lofty condominiums and growing nightlife.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nQuezon City was created to become the future capital of the Philippines. It houses various government agencies whose buildings were constructed under the original masterplan laid out by the American architect and urban planner William Parsons. Quezon City is the largest city in terms of population, resulting from its gradual expansion and rural-urban migration; the 2015 census gives a population of over 2.9 million. The city is home to every person from all walks of life, from the richest to the poorest, and the contrasts are almost ubiquitous to this city.\n\nQuezon City has no single place considered the city center; it is a multipolar city, with central business districts and commercial centers scattered at different points. Quezon City sprawls out in almost every direction, and this is manifested by the low-density developments that border each business and commercial center, and the scarcity of high-density homes for poorer residents have led to its notorious overcrowding illustrated by slums forming overnight, even after demolitions or fires break them down. The major business districts are grand old Cubao, glitzy North EDSA at the North Triangle neighborhood, with its large malls, and the classy Libis or Eastwood area at the southeast (a little version of Singapore's Orchard Road, but with its Hollywood-esque twist: the Philippines' Walk of Fame). If you are seeking the city's nightlife, the Scout Area provides all you need to hang out through the night.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nQuezon City was conceived as the future capital of the Philippines under the Philippine Commonwealth government, as Manila had become overpopulated. Most of the city was planned by the urban planner, William E. Parsons. Most areas that are now Quezon City are acquired from various municipalities in Rizal. Many government buildings were built to house the agencies as they move from Manila. Only parts of the plan had come to fruition when the Japanese invaded the Philippines in 1941. After World War II, Quezon City further expanded by ceding parts of Caloocan to form the Novaliches district, resulting in the geographic division of the municipality.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city has a tropical climate; daytime temperatures fall between 30s (86â€“102 Â°F), and has two seasons: dry and wet. Because of its location near the forested and rainy Sierra Madre, the dry season is rather cut short by the southwest monsoon. Average annual humidity is high, making the heat very unbearable, so dry season heat can take toll on your body; you will sweat easily on a short stay outside and do frequent changes in clothing.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral options are available covering various distances and some areas are accessible only by certain means of transportation.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nPrivately-operated city buses are plenty in Quezon City, and there is also a government-run free-fare bus service.\n\nEDSA Carousel: BRT-like service running from the ParaÃ±aque Integrated Terminal Exchange (PITX) and Monumento (Caloocan) and uses a dedicated lane at the middle of EDSA. Serves Cubao and the Triangle areas.\n\n2 Antipolo-Quiapo: Local bus service between Antipolo (PITX) and Quiapo (Manila via Aurora Boulevard. Major destinations served are Katipunan area, Cubao and New Manila.\n\n6 PITX-Sapang Palay, 7 PITX-Fairview and 34 PITX-Montalban: Local bus services plying Quezon and Commonwealth avenues. 6 runs between Sapang Palay in Bulacan and PITX, 7 runs between PITX Fairview (with stops along Timog and East avenues) and 34 runs between PITX and Rodriguez (Montalban), turning off Commonwealth near the Batasang Pambansa.\n\n18 BGCâ€“North EDSA: Local bus service between SM North EDSA and Bonifacio Global City via Congressional, Luzon, Katipunan and E. Rodriguez avenues. This is one of 4 city bus routes that serve Eastwood to the southeast.\n\nQCityBus: intracity bus service operated by the Quezon City government, composed of 7 radial routes (QC1-QC6 and QC8) emanating from the Quezon Memorial Circle and 1 crosstown route (QC7 Katipunanâ€“Welcome Rotonda). Services use air-conditioned coaches.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile covering only parts of QC, LRT Line 2 and MRT Line 3 run through the main points in the city, namely Cubao, North EDSA and Katipunan.\n\nThe MRT Line 7, nearing completion, will extend train coverage to Fairview, most of Commonwealth Avenue, the UP campus, Quezon Memorial Circle and North EDSA. Most of the line is already complete, opening 2023 at the earliest.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nMetered taxis are probably the most comfortable option - just be wary of large taxi fares during rush hours and drivers being picky on their passengers (they try to avoid destinations in crowded areas).\n\nBy jeepney\n\n[edit]\n\nJeepneys, either traditional or modern ones, are most useful in areas of QC not already served by city buses such as UP Diliman, which is served by a loop service known as the \"UP Ikot\".\n\nA lot of jeepney routes in QC also take the main roads primarily served by buses such as Commonwealth Avenue, but for trips that involve those roads, taking a bus is preferable.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nDriving in QC is not recommended, especially if your destination is along EDSA. Traffic is badly congested, streets are often narrow, left turns are rare than rights, and parking can be expensive in the CBDs. Reckless driving, road rage and police corruption are also problems.\n\nMain roads in QC are EDSA, C-5 (E. Rodriguez Jr., Katipunan, Tandang Sora, Luzon, Congressional and Mindanao avenues), Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon Avenue, and Quirino Highway. With the exception of Quirino Highway, most of them are wide avenues with a median divider, but these are expected to be snarled during rush hour. Left turns are often prohibited on those roads, with street intersections crossing the median closed and replaced by U-turns.\n\nQC implements the regionwide road space rationing (\"number coding\") scheme, with window hours before and after noontime except along EDSA.\n\nParking can be elusive and/or expensive at key locations. Parking spots at malls are bound to be scarce during peak shopping periods and weekly sales.\n\nBy tricycle\n\n[edit]\n\nSmaller lanes and roads in residential areas are plied with bicycles fitted with side cars, termed padyak or traysikel.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nLandmarks and parks\n\n[edit]\n\nQuezon Memorial Circle, in the Triangle Area, is a national park and shrine bounded by the Elliptical Road. At its center is a mausoleum containing the remains of Manuel L. Quezon, the second President of the Philippines. Mabuhay Rotonda in Quezon City/West was built to welcome people to the new national capital that was being built in Quezon City. Tandang Sora National Shrine is the place where the house of Melchora Aquino stood in Northwestern Quezon City It was in this site that she took care of the wounded Katipuneros and provided them food and shelter. Known as \"Tandang Sora\" she was adopted \"Heroine of Quezon City\" by a City Council Resolution. She died at the age of 107 on March 12, 1919.\n\nChurches\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Quezon City/West, you'll find Santo Domingo Church, home to the statue of the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary, said to be more than 400 years old, and San Pedro Bautista, which is one of the oldest churches in the country, housing the bones of the patron saint. There is also a catacomb in the basement of the church where the friars of the past were buried. Hearts of Jesus and Mary Parish Church is a quiet church near former President Cory Aquino and current President Noynoy Aquino in Brgy. West Triangle\n\nOther places of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nTomas Morato and Timog Avenue Tourist Belt Area in Scout Area is where restaurants, bars, clubs, and other retail and entertainment establishments are found. Araneta Center is a mixed-use residential and commercial complex in Cubao housing several malls and budget accommodations. An ideal transport base as it's LRT-2 and MRT-3 stations connects 2 major lines. It also houses several city and provincial bus terminals for travel within the metro or to other provinces. It is home to the \"Big Dome\" which is the biggest arena in the country.\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nCrime is a major problem in Quezon City. Given its crowded situation, many people are struggling to live, even resorting to crime. Snatching, pickpocketing and robbery are common, so use common sense when going to rough areas. Also beware of the Budol-budol or Dugo-dugo scams, which can rip you off and take your valuables. The dreaded budol-budol scam is noted for using hypnosis and sleigh of hand, but they rarely target foreigners.\n\nWomen should be careful, or preferable, wear modestly when outside, as Quezon City has a troubling rate of street harassment, most commonly cat-calling and wolf-whistling, usually by bystanders. Women travellers should travel in groups, especially at night.\n\nQuezon City has its share of rough areas, and the problems do perfectly rhyme: slums, fires, trash, thugs and drugs. Commonwealth and Payatas are the seediest of the city's barangays, but there is more of it; parts of the Scout Area are best avoided. Fortunately, most slums are outside the tourist track, so they are best avoided for a good reason.\n\nBeware also of scams on taxis and tricycles, most commonly where the driver pretends to know you. There are numerous case of locals falling victim to these scams, usually becoming victims of robbery, or brought to illicit locations, if not being ripped off on the fare. Women should take caution when calling a ride, especially at night and when alone."
