        "text": "1. Intramuros: Contrasted Past\n\nThick defensive walls once delimited the entire city of Manila, now a metropolis expanding far beyond containment. These streets hold the only remnants of a complicated past, and history unfolds with a tour of military headquarters Fort Santiago, or of lush colonial residence Casa Manila. Nearby, San Agustín remains the oldest active church in the country. Rizal Park stands at the outskirts of Intramuros, in celebration of the national heroes and the recent independence.\n\n2. Binondo: World's Oldest Chinatown\n\nAcross Pasig River from Intramuros, this intensely contrasting neighborhood exemplifies the bustling culture of Manila as it is known today. Besides iconic Binondo Church, food is the main attraction. The famous Dong Bei dumpling house draws hungry visitors all day long. The local Cemetery extends northwards from this Chinatown, offering a break from the city amidst lovely Chinese architecture.\n\n3. Manila Bay: Beyond the Busy Streets\n\nManila was strategically located on this bay for trade and defensive purposes, and today the city's greatest attractions surround its picturesque waters. Rides at Ocean Park and Star City send you soaring over the horizon, while the SM Mall of Asia offers endless shopping opportunities. The Cultural Center of the Philippines always has a local event going on, and is just a few steps from the boats that bear you to Corregidor Island.\n\n4. Makati: Wall Street of the Philippines\n\nMakati is the striking contemporary hub of Manila, and the Philippines' center for business and finance. Its skycrapers are iconic and jaw-dropping, with high-end department stores at their feet. Beneath the cityscape, side streets also hide smaller scale wonders worth a tour. The enjoyable Ayala Triangle Gardens with its cafés lie just behind the Stock Exchange, and the Greenbelt Chapel and Nuestra Señora de Gracia church harken back to earlier times.\n\n5. Taal Lake: Lake-ception\n\nA Lake within a Lake... Though Manila is teeming with energy day and night, the Philippines are also full of serene natural wonders. For a change of pace, make the day trip to Taal Lake, a dazzling freshwater crater south of the city. Take a boat to the isolated island at the center and make your way to the top of Taal Volcano on horseback. Light plays with the water that fills the mountaintop crater, as the rest of the lake expands in every direction down below.\n\nThose who need to be close to the sights in Intramuros could go for the comfortable Bayleaf Hotel, which has a rooftop restaurant. Other city center highlights include the Sofitel Philippine Plaza, Raffles Makati (which is very handy for the main business district), and Nobu Hotel, which has a huge on-site pool. Budget travelers could also have a look at Z Hostel in Makati, which is a modern, well-located but cheaper accommodation provider.\n\nPopular Neighborhoods in Manila\n\nIntramuros - literally \"inside the walls\", Intramuros is Manila's historical heart. Here you'll find almost all of the colonial-era attractions like the city ramparts, the church of San Agustín, Manila's splendid cathedral, and Casa Manila, a recreated colonial home.\n\nErmita - famous for its nightlife and restaurants, Ermita is where most tourists gravitate to at the end of a day of sightseeing, and with good reason. Ermita has plenty of family attractions like the Ocean Park Aquarium and the Museo Pambata, while eateries like Kamayan are a wonderful place to sample Filipino delicacies.\n\nSampaloc - home to most of Manila's higher education institutions, Sampaloc has a student vibe about it, but is also famous for its stunning Dangwa Flower Market. It's a good place to party and relax, while the many lechon (roasted pig) restaurants are excellent places to fill up at the end of the day.\n\nIntramuros - literally \"inside the walls\", Intramuros is Manila's historical heart.
