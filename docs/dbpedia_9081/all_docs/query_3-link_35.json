The beautiful grounds, open to the public, are filled with majestic palm trees and lush, colorful vegetation.\n\nTemple History\n\nThe Manila Philippines Temple was the first temple built in the Philippines and the second built in Asia.\n\nThe street where the Manila Philippines Temple is located was renamed to Temple Drive during the temple's construction.\n\nA typhoon approached Manila the day before the groundbreaking of the Manila Philippines Temple, creating concern that would event would have to be postponed. At a mission conference that evening, a missionary prayed for the weather to cooperate so that the groundbreaking could continue. The typhoon changed direction that night, and the groundbreaking proceeded as planned.\n\nNearly 27,000 toured the interior of the Manila Philippines Temple during its 13-day open house held prior to its dedication.\n\nThe days prior to the dedication of the Manila Philippines Temples saw several natural disasters in the Philippines including two typhoons, the eruption of Mayon volcano on Bicol Peninsula, and an earthquake in northern Luzon. The temple remained unaffected.\n\nThe Manila Philippines Temple was dedicated in nine sessions by President Gordon B. Hinckley, Second Counselor in the First Presidency."
