        "text": "Filipino gymnast Carlos Yulo won his second Olympic gold medal in two days, becoming only the second athlete to take home the Games' top prize for his country.\n\nA three-bedroom condo, thousands of dollars and a lifetime of free ramen are among the flurry of gifts that the government and local brands have pledged to reward the 24-year-old with for his historic wins in the men's floor exercise and vault events.\n\nMr Yulo's feat has also made him the country's latest social media sensation.\n\n“Another gold for the Philippines! History is made again! Ang galing galing mo! [You are incredible!]” wrote a user on X.\n\nMr Yulo scored an average of 15.116 on the vault on Sunday, ahead of Armenia's Artur Davtyan (14.966) and Britain's Harry Hepworth (14.949).\n\nHe punched his arms into the air and embraced fellow athletes on hearing his score. He went into the competition without high expectations, he had told reporters.\n\n\"I was just hoping to perform well. I didn't really expect a medal,\" Mr Yulo had said.\n\n\"It really felt like a bonus for me. It's crazy, because last night I couldn't sleep. I was so hyped because I had won that gold medal [the day before].\n\nBarely 24 hours ago, Mr Yulo had scooped the gold for the men's floor exercise with 15 points, edging out Artem Dolgopyat of Israel by just 0.034 of a point. Mr Dolgopyat had been the defending Olympic champion and world title holder.\n\nMr Yulo's double gold feat is now the most discussed topic on X, formerly known as Twitter, in the Philippines.\n\n“It took 100 years for us to hear Lupang Hinirang [the Philippines' national anthem] two nights in a row while the world is watching. Thank you so much for the pride and historic moment!\" wrote an X user.\n\nA century has passed since the Philippines' debut in the Olympics in 1924. Weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz earned the country's first Olympic gold medal in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nPhilippine celebrities and public figures, including president Ferdinand Marcos Jr and First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, also congratulated Mr Yulo.\n\n\"No words can express how proud we are of you, Caloy. You have achieved GOLD for the Philippines not once, but twice! Filipinos all over the world stood united, cheering and rooting for you,\" Mr Marcos wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe Philippine government will hand the gymnast 10 million Philippine pesos ($173,300; £135,400) - a reward promised to any gold medalists - while a real estate firm has promised him a fully furnished three-bedroom unit at McKinley Hill, the largest condominium development in metropolitan Manila.\n\nThe House of Representatives has pledged to give Mr Yulo an additional 6 million pesos in cash incentives, with speaker of the lower house, Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, describing him as a “sports hero” and “national treasure”.\n\nEven medical clinics and universities have rolled out the red carpet for the national hero - a gastroenterologist has offered Mr Yulo free consultations and colonoscopies for life while the University of Mindanao has pledged free university credits.\n\nAlso awaiting him are lifetime supplies of ramen, mac and cheese and grilled chicken offered by various restaurant chains.\n\nMeanwhile, the capital city Manila, where Mr Yulo was born and raised, is preparing a \"hero's welcome\" for him.\n\n“The grandest welcome will greet him and all our Paris Olympians. When we meet him, we will present Carlos Yulo cash incentives, awards and symbols of the eternal gratitude of the proud capital city of the Philippines,” the city's mayor, Honey Lacuna, said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Virma Simonette in Manila"
