        "text": "Quezon City served as the Philippines’s capital for almost three decades (1948 1976), yet Filipinos today barely remember this historical fact. Was the city, therefore, a failure? This book answers this question by presenting an unconventional historical geography of twentieth-century Quezon City, one that focuses not on its grandiose architecture and master plan but on its boundaries, peripheries, and marginal areas. In so doing, it shows how the city functioned as a buffer zone mediating between city and countryside, and thus developed due to the urban rural overlaps inherent in sociohistorical forces such as colonialism, revolution, agrarian unrest, decolonization, migration, and authoritarianism. Not quite Manila-centric, this book is twentieth-century Philippine history from an off-center point of view.\n\nContents\n\nList of Figures\n\nList of Maps\n\nList of Tables\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nList of Abbreviations\n\nIntroduction: The Contours of a Capital at the Margins\n\nChapter one: From Cattle Rustlers to Cabaret Dancers\n\nChapter two: Quezon’s City\n\nChapter three: Spectral Spaces beyond Balete Drive\n\nChapter four: Jeprox Ambiguity\n\nChapter five: The Submissive and Subversive Suburbs\n\nConclusion: Past, Imperfect, Tense"
