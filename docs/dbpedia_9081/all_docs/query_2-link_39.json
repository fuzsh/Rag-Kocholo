        "text": "Geography\n\nThe Philippines is an archipelago in the South China Sea, northeast of the island of Borneo and about 350 km south of Taiwan. The country consists of 7,641 islands and has a total area of 300,000 km². The total coastline is 36,289 km long. This makes the country only three quarters the size of California, but with 117.34 million inhabitants it has a significantly higher population density of 391.1 per km². Only slightly less than half of all inhabitants (48.0%) live within the cities, with the metropolitan region of Manila being by far the largest in the country."
