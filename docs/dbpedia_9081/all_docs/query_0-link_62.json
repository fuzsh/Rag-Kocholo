It comprises eight cities and nine municipalities, which I infer would be known in other parts of the world as towns or townships.\n\nJohn Ayer, 4 February 2001\n\nCaloocan City Manila\n\nManila International Airport Authority\n\nPasay City Quezon\n\nCaloocan City\n\nby Jaume Ollé, 4 February 2001\n\nThe northernmost locality in the National Capital Region is Caloocan City, with a population in 1995 of 1,023,159 in 215,122 households.\n\nJohn Ayer, 4 February 2001\n\nManila\n\nby Paolo, 3 November 2005\n\nThe flag of Manila according the book that came from the Heraldry Office of the presidency. Manila is a chartered city, and like many others chartered, has its own flag (all the flags of these cities and provinces are included in the book).\n\nJaume Ollé, 14 April, 2000\n\nManila, the Philippine national capital had 1,654,761 inhabitants in 347,173 households in 1995.\n\nJohn Ayer, 4 February 2001\n\nThe seal on a flag I have is similar but the words and the stars on my flag are both in yellow. The flag I've got was made in Manila in one of the most important flag makers.\n\nPaolo, 3 November 2005\n\nManila International Airport Authority\n\nimage by Kazutaka Nishiura, 3 March 2014\n\nIn Oct 2005 I found a flag of Manila International Airport Authority at the airport which depicts a bird with national tricolor of red, yellow and blue in white field and its Authority name in black beneath. The flag proportion is 1: 2 same as national flag.\n\nNozomi Kariyasu, 3 March 2014\n\nPasay City\n\nby Dirk Schönberger, 4 February 2001\n\nSource: Symbols of the state\n\nPasay City had 408,610 inhabitants in 86,253 households.\n\nJohn Ayer, 4 February 2001\n\nQuezon\n\nby Jaume Ollé, 4 February 2001\n\nQuezon is the biggest city in the National Capital District, in both area and population. Its inhabitants number 1,989,419 in 415,788 households by the 1995 census.\n\nJohn Ayer, 4 February 2001\n\nSee also:"
