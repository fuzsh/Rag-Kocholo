        "text": "Metro Manila, the National Capital Region (NCR), is a vital economic, political, and cultural center of the Philippines. The region comprises the country’s capital city of Manila, 14 other cities, and one municipality. Among the other regions in the country, Metro Manila is the second most populated, with the majority of its inhabitants below the age of 40 as of the 2020 census. The region has the highest gross domestic expenditures in the Philippines, owing to the various business and financial activities in several cities belonging to it. Metro Manila is poised to continue becoming an important economic hub of the Philippines despite the growth of other regions such as Cebu and Davao.\n\nWholesale and retail trade driving Metro Manila’s economy\n\nThe Metropolitan Manila has shown steady growth in its gross regional domestic expenditures (GRDE) over the past decade, until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The larger share of its GRDE has been attributed to the services sector, mainly the wholesale and retail trade and the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles. Although no data are available that specifically focuses on the trade activities in Metro Manila, the largest port in the Philippines is the Port of Manila, which is the gateway to international shipping and trade. The United States, Japan, and China stand as the leading trade partners of the country’s export goods, which are comprised of mainly electronic products.\n\nIn addition to the services industry, the manufacturing sector is also very significant in Metro Manila, especially for the food and beverage, textile, electronics, and plastic industries. As a commercial capital, the region is also home to several headquarters of multinational companies, high-end shopping establishments, and office and residential properties, particularly in the central business districts (CBD). There are six CBDs in the region and each district has distinct business focuses. For instance, the Makati Central Business District can be considered the most premier corporate district and metropolitan atmosphere. Meanwhile, the up-and-coming Bonifacio Global City (BGC) is known for its high-tech offices, residential buildings, and lifestyle scene. These districts are also where most of the leading BPO firms are located, although plans to expand office locations outside of the region and into the other major cities and provinces are already in place.\n\nTraffic and mobility situation in Metro Manila\n\nMetro Manila is well known for its traffic congestion, averaging about three million vehicles daily. In Manila City alone, motorists can lose about 100 hours annually when driving during the rush hour. In 2023, motorcycles and cars dominated the roads of Metro Manila. With an increasing number of passenger cars in use, the traffic situation in the metropolitan area can be expected to worsen. To resolve traffic congestion, plans were put in place, such as expanding commuter train lines, introducing bike lanes, and allowing alternative modes of transport such as electric scooters, motorcycle taxis, or carpooling. However, the traffic situation in the Metro remains complex and will need more comprehensive approaches, especially as the region’s population continues to grow."
