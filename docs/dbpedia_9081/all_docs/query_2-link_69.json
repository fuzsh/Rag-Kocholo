        "text": "Located at the gateway of Entertainment Cityâs Manila Bay area in the city of Paranaque, the 6.2-hectare City of Dreams Manila is a premier leisure and entertainment destination in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Its golden exterior features six hotel towers and an egg-shaped dome that houses luxurious VIP and exclusive gaming areas.\n\nThe luxury resort is part of the Aseana City township development that includes the Ayala Malls Manila Bay, a huge shopping mall which is across from the resort. Nearby is the Mall of Asia complex within the SM Central Business Park that includes one of the worldâs largest shopping malls, the 20,000-capacity Mall of Asia Arena, and SMX, the largest convention center in the country. Via the elevated NAIA Expressway, the luxury resort is about three to five kilometers to and from the Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airportâs (NAIA) three terminals. Makati and Bonifacio Global City business districts are also about seven and ten kilometers away, respectively.\n\nForbes Travel Guide (FTG), the globally recognized rating system for luxury hotels, restaurants, and spas, has recognized City of Dreams Manila: in 2023, as Finalist in the inaugural 2023 Responsible Hospitality Award for its outstanding level of commitment to sustainable practices at the luxury level; and in 2022, the winner of the Work Here, Work Happy, an accolade which distinguished the resortâs âemployee loveâ initiatives that foster colleaguesâ professional growth and work-life balance at the annual Best of the Year Awards. And since 2018, has awarded Star ratings to the three luxury hotels and the NÃ¼wa spa at the integrated resort.\n\nThe integrated resort is known for its three luxury hotel brands, impressive regional and international specialty restaurants, bars and a spacious retail boulevard. The resort is also known for its thrilling entertainment venues, notably DreamPlay, the worldâs first DreamWorks-inspired family entertainment center. NÃ¼wa Spa, Nobu Spa, three gyms, and a multi-level car park complete the resort facilities.\n\nThe luxury integrated casino resort features an aggregated space for luxurious VIP and mass-market gaming. Like all the properties of Melco Resorts & Entertainment, it is recognized by RG Check, the worldâs most comprehensive responsible gaming accreditation program developed by the Responsible Gambling Council."
