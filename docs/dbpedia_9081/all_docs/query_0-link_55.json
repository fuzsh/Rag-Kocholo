        "text": "EDITOR’S NOTE: Please be advised that this Manila travel guide hasn’t been updated in 2024. Prices and travel guidelines may no longer be accurate so it’s important that you verify any information before proceeding.\n\nIt’s been over two years since I wrote the first edition of this Manila travel guide. I decided to write it after hearing more than one foreigner describe Manila as the scariest city they’ve ever visited. I don’t know where they stayed or what happened that made them say that, but it inspired me to write a travel guide that put traveler safety first. I certainly didn’t want anyone visiting my home city and having a negative or even traumatic experience.\n\nBut the thing is, focusing so much on safety inadvertently put my city in a negative light. Without meaning to, I may have made it seem worse than it actually was. Sure, we have our share of taxi scammers and purse snatchers, but don’t many destinations around the world have those too? Surely Manila isn’t worse than any other third world metropolis? I wanted tourists to have fun in Manila but I realized after some time that putting so much emphasis on traveler safety wasn’t the right approach. It shed light on the negative instead of focusing on the positive aspects of my city and Filipinos in general.\n\nMany travel bloggers have come to Manila and fallen in love with my city and its people, so much so that some of them are actually considering moving here. And they all said the same thing – when you’re here, you’re family. We Filipinos are known for our hospitality. Travel safety is a concern no matter where you go, but the chance to be welcomed like family isn’t something you can find just anywhere. I wanted the new edition of this guide to be a reflection of that.\n\nGUIDE TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nTravel Restrictions\n\nManila at a Glance\n\nBest time to Visit\n\nHow to Get There\n\nWhere to Exchange Currency\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nHow to Get Around\n\nThings to Do\n\nDay Trips from Manila\n\nOn Filipino Food\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nHow Many Days to Stay / Sample Itinerary\n\nTravel Tips\n\nPoblacion Area Map\n\nTRAVEL RESTRICTIONS\n\nBecause of the current global situation, travel guidelines change often. Our friends at SafetyWing created a website that lists detailed information on travel restrictions around the globe.\n\nBefore doing any serious planning, be sure to check the Flatten the Curve website for information on travel restrictions to the Philippines.\n\nMANILA AT A GLANCE\n\nManila is the capital city of the Philippines. Strictly speaking, it refers to one specific city but it’s also used as a blanket term for the whole metropolitan area. When people say “Manila”, they can either be referring to the actual city of Manila which is home to the capital’s most recognized attractions like Intramuros and Fort Santiago, or they can be using it to refer to the entire metropolitan area which consists of several cities like the city of Manila, Makati, Pasay, and Quezon City. Does this make sense?\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Manila is the most densely populated city in the world (as of June 2016). If you’ve ever driven through Manila’s rush hour traffic, then you won’t argue with that. The Philippines is a developing country with a dearth of well-paying jobs in the provinces. Many Filipinos flock to Manila looking for work which is part of the reason why the city has become so densely populated.\n\nI’ve lived in Manila most of my life and I’ll agree it isn’t the prettiest city. But if you give it a chance, then you’ll find that there’s much to love here.\n\nBEST TIME TO VISIT MANILA\n\nMore often than not, Manila is a stopover for many travelers so there isn’t really a “best time” to visit. Just know that there are two seasons — dry and rainy. Dry season is from December-May while rainy season is from June-November. March-May is the hottest and most humid time of the year with temperatures frequently exceeding 40°C (104°F). July-September are the wettest months while December-February are the coolest, making it the most ideal time to visit. This holds true for most of the Philippines.\n\nClimate: Annual Monthly Weather in Manila\n\nFor more on the weather in Manila, check out this climate data from weather-and-climate.com. I’ve also created the average temperature and annual rainfall graphs below. Best months to visit are colored in orange.\n\nAverage Temperature\n\nAnnual Rainfall\n\nHOW TO GET THERE\n\nThe majority of international flights will be arriving at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 1. Terminal 2 services Philippine Air Lines only, while the few airlines not served by Terminal 1 will land at Terminal 3.\n\nRegardless of where you land, the best ways to get to your hotel from the airport are by UBE Express Bus, Grab, or private transfer. Personally, I always use Grab. There are metered and coupon taxis as well but I’ve never used them.\n\nBY UBE EXPRESS BUS: A fleet of air-conditioned buses called UBE Express services passengers to and from the airport. Buses are equipped with onboard wifi and cost PHP 150 each way. You can purchase tickets at the airport kiosks when you arrive or you can buy them in advance through the UBE Express booking website. It services all three airport terminals and takes passengers to and from designated stops along several routes. You can follow the link for more detailed information about UBE Express and their bus routes.\n\nBY GRAB: Despite being known as an app-based service, you’ll be able to book a ride with Grab even if you don’t have a smartphone or wifi connectivity. Grab booths can be found at these locations:\n\nTerminal 1: Main arrival curbside\n\nTerminal 2: Inner arrival curbside between Bays 7 and 8\n\nTerminal 3: Secondary arrival curbside between Bays 5 and 6\n\nTerminal 4: Curbside\n\nBY PRIVATE TRANSFER: It’ll probably be more expensive but if you’d like to book a private airport transfer, then you can do so through Bookaway.\n\nMost travelers will probably fly to Manila but there may be other ways to get there depending on where you are. Check out Bookaway to search for route options available to you. You can click on the link or use the widget below.\n\nWHERE TO EXCHANGE CURRENCY\n\nThe best place to exchange currency in Manila is at a licensed money changer. Their rates are generally 10-20% better than banks. The rate at the airport is terrible so be sure to change no more than USD 100 there. That’ll get you to your hotel and give you enough pesos to spend on your first day until you can find a money changer.\n\nThere are plenty of money changers in Manila, including malls, so you can ask your hotel where the nearest (and best) one is. Be wary of anyone who approaches you on the street offering a great exchange rate. These are scams so avoid them like the plague. Exchange your currency only at licensed money changers and be sure to count your pesos before leaving the counter.\n\nWHERE TO STAY IN MANILA\n\nIn my opinion, the Poblacion area in Makati is the best place to stay in Manila. It’s located near the commercial business district so there are plenty of shops, restaurants, bars, and convenience stores in the area.\n\nThere are many hotels to choose from in Poblacion but I can recommend the three below based on personal experience. You can also check Booking.com or Agoda for alternate listings in Poblacion/Makati.\n\nBACKPACKER: Z Hostel\n\nA hip, centrally located hostel in Poblacion, Makati, Z Hostel is perfect for backpackers and group travelers. It’s clean and well-designed with mostly dorm-type accommodations. Over the weekends, it has a small roofdeck that turns into a lively bar with DJs and live music. You can make a reservation through Booking.com or Agoda. Be sure to check both sites to find the best deal.\n\nBOUTIQUE: La Casita Mercedes\n\nThis is the type of place we love staying at when we travel. La Casita Mercedes is an old Filipino house that was renovated and reopened as a 7-room bed and breakfast in 2015. If you’re traveling as a couple and want peace and quiet, then this is a great place to stay. You can make a reservation through Booking.com or Agoda. Be sure to check both sites to find the best deal.\n\nBUSINESS: City Garden Grand Hotel\n\nCity Garden Grand Hotel is a 4-star hotel just a few minutes’ walk from Z Hostel and La Casita Mercedes. It’s central location makes it ideal for business or leisure travelers to Manila. Considering it’s a 4-star hotel in Makati, rates are reasonable with Standard rooms starting at around PHP 3,785 a night. You can make a reservation through Booking.com or Agoda. Be sure to check both sites to find the best deal.\n\nHOW TO GET AROUND\n\nCommuter Apps\n\nBooking rides through Grab is the best way to get around Manila. It isn’t the cheapest, but it’s the safest and most convenient. Downloading and using the app will require a constant internet connection which is why I’m suggesting you rent a pocket wifi device or purchase a sim card while you’re in the Philippines. For your convenience, I’ve listed the Grab location and approximate fare for each of the recommended destinations in this guide.\n\nIf you’re considering using anything other than commuter apps, don’t. As much as I would love to heap praises on our public transportation system, I can’t at this time. Here’s why:\n\nRegular Taxis\n\nDon’t get into a regular taxi. They don’t have the best reputation, even among locals. Many are rundown and smelly and we often hear about taxis being used to commit scams and thefts (or worse). With that said, I’m not saying all taxi drivers are evil. Many are good, honest people. But for your safety and peace of mind, then it’s best that you stay away from regular taxis for now.\n\nPublic Buses\n\nForget buses. Not only are many of them rundown, bus drivers are the worst. They drive like fucking maniacs. A kiwi friend of mine who lived in Manila for a year told me that he was never sure he’d get out of a bus alive. I’m sure he was exaggerating but you get my point.\n\nJeepneys (?)\n\nPublic jeepneys aren’t the most comfortable means of transportation but they’re an iconic part of Philippine culture so feel free to ride them at least once. It’s a memorable experience and the cheapest way to get around. I’ve never personally used it, but there’s a mobile app from sakay.ph that can help you navigate Manila’s often confusing public transportation system.\n\nMRT\n\nAs much as I would love to recommend the MRT (subway system) as an ideal means of transportation for tourists, I can’t. At least not until they make improvements. The most common complaints include how scorchingly hot train stations are and how crowded trains get during rush hour (not enough trains!). The MRT has potential but until they address certain issues, it isn’t the best way to get around the city. Check out this video on an American’s thoughts on Manila’s MRT system.\n\nPlease be advised that my recommendations above reflect my personal thoughts and opinions at this time. They may change if improvements are made. I’ll be sure to update this page if they do because there’s nothing I want more than a public transportation system we locals can be proud of.\n\nTHINGS TO DO IN MANILA\n\n1. Tour Intramuros on a Bamboo Bike with Bambike Ecotours\n\nHistoric Intramuros is without a doubt the premier tourist attraction in Manila. Known as the Walled City, this 0.67 sq km walled area (0.26 sq mi) WAS the City of Manila during the Spanish Colonial Period. You can explore Intramuros on your own but one of the most fun ways to experience it is on sustainable bamboo bikes made in partnership with one of the Philippines’ most respected NGOs, Gawad Kalinga.\n\n2. Do the Binondo Food Wok with Ivan Man Dy\n\nHave you seen the Philippine episode of No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain? If so, then you might recognize Ivan. He was one of Anthony’s guides in Manila. A fun gastronomic tour that takes you through the back alleys of Binondo, there’s no better or more delicious way of exploring Manila’s Chinatown than this. Highly recommended.\n\n3. Marvel at Juan Luna’s Spoliarium at the National Museum\n\nThe National Museum is Manila’ foremost museum and houses what’s widely considered to be the most internationally renowned piece in Philippine art history — Spoliarium by national artist Juan Luna. A cultural treasure measuring a gargantuan 422 cm x 767.5 cm, this painting of dying gladiators received a gold medal at the Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in Madrid in 1884.\n\nThe National Museum is comprised of three buildings — The National Art Gallery which showcases visual artworks, the Museum of the Filpino People which houses important historical artifacts, and the Planetarium. Needless to say, you can spend an entire day visiting all three. The National Museum went through a major renovation in 2012 so the buildings look and feel brand new.\n\n4. Enjoy the Manila Bay Sunset over Buckets of Beer at Mall of Asia (MOA)\n\nManila Bay is renowned for its sunsets and there are few better vantage points than Mall of Asia. Fronting the bay, its the third largest shopping mall in the Philippines.\n\nTo catch the sunset, head on up to the second floor around 5 PM and look for signs pointing you to Seaside Boulevard. There you’ll find a row of al fresco restaurants facing Manila Bay. Pick any restaurant that appeals to you and order a bucket (6 bottles) of San Mig Lights or Pale Pilsens. Kick back and enjoy the light show.\n\n5. Satisfy Your Sweet Tooth at the Dessert Museum\n\nIf you’re going to Mall of Asia, then you may want to pay a visit to the Dessert Museum as well, especially if you like sweets and posting your #ootd on Instagram. It’s a fun and unique candy-filled attraction that boasts eight themed rooms, each inspired by a different dessert.\n\n6. Go Bargain Hunting at Greenhills Shopping Center\n\nGreenhills Shopping Center (or “Greenhills” for short) is a bargain hunter’s paradise. You can find almost anything there like mobile phones, gadgets, jewelry, clothing, fashion accessories, watches, shoes, bags, etc. It’s also home to a good amount of quality knock-offs. Just be aware of any laws that your country may have about the importation of counterfeit goods before you go crazy buying fakes.\n\nLike Mall of Asia, you can book a half-day shopping experience at Greenhills Shopping Center through Klook.\n\nGrab fare from Poblacion: Around PHP 299 each way (Destination: Greenhills Shopping Center)\n\n7. Watch Science come Alive at the Mind Museum\n\nThis place was fun. If you’re traveling with kids, then the Mind Museum is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Not only will they be learning about things like Bernoulli’s Principle, magnetic fields, and Einstein’s theory of gravity, but they’ll be doing it in the funnest way imaginable. The Mind Museum is located at the BGC (Bonifacio Global City) as well which is home to some of Manila’s trendiest bars and restaurants.\n\n8. Get a Massage\n\nMassages are cheap in Manila and pretty good. You can get a full body massage for around PHP 350. Just be sure that you go to a LEGITIMATE massage parlor and not a sex den masquerading as one.\n\nThere are many legitimate massage parlors around so just ask your hotel where the nearest one is. If you’re staying in Poblacion, then I recommend Nuat Thai near A Venue Mall. You can refer to the map at the bottom of this post or ask your hotel for directions. You can also book a massage through Klook. Massages are hard work so be sure to give your masseuse a good tip (PHP 50-100).\n\nDAY TRIPS FROM MANILA\n\nIf you’re staying a few days in Manila, then here are a few day trips you can take from the city.\n\n1. Masungi Georeserve\n\nThis is the place that went viral on social media not too long ago. Located about 1.5 hours from Makati, Masungi Georeserve is a geological park and conservation area in Baras, Rizal. It’s home to a hiking trail featuring rope walls, hanging bridges, and unique viewing platforms suspended over limestone karsts and overlooking a lush tropical rainforest. If you had time to take just one day trip from Manila, then this should be it.\n\n2. Taal Volcano\n\nA trip to Tagaytay is one of the most popular day trips locals make from Manila. Tagaytay is a holiday town about 2 hrs south of Manila which features cooler climates and a picturesque view of Taal Volcano.\n\nLocated in the middle of a lake, Taal Volcano is one the most active volcanos in the Philippines with 33 historical eruptions, though don’t let this frighten you. Like many Filipinos, we’ve been making weekend trips to Tagaytay for as long as I can remember and I don’t recall the volcano ever being a concern.\n\n3. Taal Heritage Town\n\nHave you heard of the historic town of Vigan in Ilocos Sur? Think of Taal Town as a mini-version of Vigan, but just 2 hours south of Manila. It’s home to a wealth of Spanish colonial heritage houses and the biggest church in Southeast Asia. If you don’t plan on doing a Taal Volcano trek, then it’s possible to pair this with a trip to Tagaytay.\n\n4. Mount Pinatubo\n\nIf one active volcano isn’t enough for you, then you can pay a visit to Mt. Pinatubo as well. Many people may not remember it, but Mt. Pinatubo was the volcano that produced the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century. Turning day into night, it erupted in 1991 and covered Manila in a blanket of ash.\n\n5. Corregidor Island\n\nIf you’re interested in WWII history, then a visit to Corregidor Island is a must. Because of its strategic location at the entrance of Manila Bay, Corregidor has long been fortified with coastal artillery to defend Manila against attacks from enemy warships.\n\nDuring WWII, it played a vital role in the liberation of the Philippines from Japanese forces. Today, it’s a popular tourist attraction featuring military installations used during the war.\n\nON FILIPINO FOOD\n\n45 MUST-TRY FILIPINO DISHES\n\nRenowned food personality Andrew Zimmern once said that Filipino food will be the next big thing. I believe it with all the features on Filipino food I’ve been seeing more and more on social media. There are many delicious things to eat in the Philippines but in my opinion, these are the dishes that you absolutely must try. Click on the link for a list of the best and most interesting food in the Philippines.\n\nFILIPINO STREET FOOD\n\nIf street food is your thing, then you need to check out this guide. From fish balls to ukoy to that notoriously bizarre Filipino dish called balut, check out this post for a list of Filipino street food dishes you can try in Manila.\n\nPOBLACION FOOD CRAWL\n\nPoblacion is one of the hippest and trendiest areas in Manila. It’s fast becoming a food and arts hub in the city, which is part of the reason why I think it’s the best place to stay in Manila. With all the interesting restaurants popping up in the neighborhood, it’s recently been the subject of many lifestyle shows and blog posts. Check out my post for a list of popular restaurants you can visit on a Poblacion food crawl.\n\nWHERE TO EAT IN MANILA\n\nThis was the hardest section to write being a food lover from Manila. How could I narrow it down? These restaurants may not be the trendiest, but they made the list for what in my mind are the most important reasons — longevity, accessibility, price, and overall experience.\n\nTailored for travelers getting their first taste of Filipino food, we chose restaurants that serve authentic Filipino cuisine and have withstood the test of time.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: I recently published a guide to the best restaurants in Manila. You may want to check that out for a bigger and more updated list.\n\n1. Blackbeard’s Seafood Island\n\nThere’s no Filipino dining experience more fun than a boodle fight. A tradition that started in the Philippine military, a boodle feast consists of a central mound of food – typically grilled Filipino food – piled high on banana leaves. Diners are seated around the spread and expected to eat kamayan-style, which means to “eat with one’s hands”. Many restaurants offer boodle feasts but one of the most popular is Blackbeard’s Seafood Island. They have many branches in Manila, including Mall of Asia.\n\n2. Abe\n\nAbe belongs to the iconic LJC group of restaurants that’s been serving excellent Filipino cuisine for over 30 years. It’s one of the first restaurants I think of when entertaining foreign guests. Popular dishes include the Lamb Adobo, Crispy Pork Adobo ni Lola Ising, Bamboo Rice (pictured below), and Sikreto ni Maria (sticky rice dessert with ripe mangoes and macapuno ice cream). For more adventurous eaters, I suggest trying the Betute (stuffed frogs) and Arobong Kamaru (sauteed crickets).\n\n5. Seaside Market on Macapagal Boulevard\n\nIf you like fresh seafood, then you’ll enjoy the Seaside Market along Macapagal Boulevard. A fish market to table concept, you’ll buy your seafood from the wet market then have it cooked by one of the many restaurants in the complex. Seafood doesn’t get any fresher than this.\n\n6. Gerry’s Grill\n\nGerry’s Grill is arguably the most popular Filipino grill restaurant in Manila. The food is good and inexpensive, making it a favorite watering hole among locals. I suggest trying the Inihaw na Liempo (grilled pork belly), Inihaw na Baby Pusit, and the Adobong Puso Rice (pictured below). They’re also known for their Pork Sisig, a hugely popular bar appetizer made with chopped pig’s face, ears, and chicken liver.\n\nHOW MANY DAYS TO STAY / SAMPLE ITINERARY\n\nAs previously described, Manila is a stopover destination for most travelers so there’s no need to stay too long. If you won’t be doing any day trips from Manila, then three days should be plenty. You can extend your stay based on how many day trips you want to do.\n\nHere’s a sample 4D/3N Manila itinerary I put together to help you plan your trip. I made it four days to give you time for one or two of the recommended day trips.\n\nDAY ONE\n\n• Go on an Intramuros Tour\n\n• Visit the National Museum\n\n• Enjoy the sunset at Mall of Asia DAY TWO\n\n• Visit Taal Heritage Town\n\n• Enjoy the sunset at a restaurant in Tagaytay overlooking Taal Volcano DAY THREE\n\n• Do the Binondo Food Wok\n\n• Look for bargains at Greenhills Shopping Center DAY FOUR\n\n• Visit the Mind Museum and Bonifacio Global City (BGC)\n\n• Get a massage\n\n• Go on a Poblacion food crawl\n\nTRAVEL TIPS\n\n1. Plan your Trip with Sygic Travel\n\nI’ve been using this free trip planning app for several years now. It enables you to plot points of interest on a map, including your hotel, so you can see exactly how far you need to travel between points. You can then group attractions together per day based on their location. Check out my post on the Sygic Travel app for more information.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS / Android\n\n2. Rent a Pocket Wifi Device\n\nThis guide hinges on getting around using commuter apps so it’s imperative that you have wifi access. Many public places like your hotel and cafes do have free wifi but the connection isn’t as good nor as reliable. For that reason, I suggest renting a pocket wifi device or buying a sim card so you have uninterrupted wifi access at all times. You can either pick them up from Ninoy Aquino International Airport or have them delivered to your hotel.\n\n3. Check for Discount Passes\n\nKlook is my favorite booking platform when it comes to finding deals on interesting tours and attractions in Asia. They often have the biggest selection at the best prices and their website is super easy to use. If you’re looking for deals on things like tours, airport transfers, and activities, then you can search through these lists of Manila attractions on Klook.\n\n4. Get Travel Insurance\n\nYou may not need it as much in Manila but if you’re traveling to less developed parts of the Philippines, then I’d say travel insurance is a must. Much of our infrastructure isn’t as developed and if you go to places like Batad or Sagada where you can easily lose your footing when hiking, then having travel insurance will be a godsend.\n\nWe buy travel insurance from SafetyWing. They’re a popular travel insurance provider used by many long-term travelers. Click on the link to get a free quote from SafetyWing.\n\n5. Give around 10% Gratuity\n\nAs mentioned up top, the Philippines is a tipping country, a practice that we probably inherited from the Americans. However, it isn’t as regimented (or expected) as the US so you’re free to give whatever you want. Filipinos are generally nice so they won’t chase you down for giving them a bad tip.\n\nWhen you get your bill, check if service charge has already been included. Most will be 10%. If so, then you can give an additional PHP 20 on top of it, more if you’re a large group. If service charge hasn’t been included, then leaving a 10% tip would be nice. You’re welcome to leave more if you’re happy with the service of course. It’ll be much appreciated.\n\nMabuhay!\n\nAs described up top, many travelers gloss over Manila. It may not be as beautiful as other destinations in the Philippines but I hope this guide convinces you that my city has a lot to offer if you give it a chance. If you have any questions, then please feel free to post them in the comment section. We’d love to hear from you.\n\nThanks for stopping by and enjoy Manila and the Philippines!\n\nDisclosure\n\nWe were invited by City Garden Grand Hotel for the sole purpose of reviewing their hotel. They never asked to be included in this guide but I added them anyway to provide more choices to a larger demographic of travelers. Everything else on this guide was paid for by us and added at our own volition. No one asked to be added, no one knew they were going to be included.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links so we’ll earn a small commission if you make a purchase at no extra cost to you.
