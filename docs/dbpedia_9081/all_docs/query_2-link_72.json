        "text": "Getting Around Manila\n\nExploring Manila by public transportation can be overwhelming, but don’t worry, we have you covered. First, you have to find your way to your hotel once you arrive at the airport. Then you have to learn how to get around the city by using public transportation.\n\nFrom the Airport\n\nThe Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 is located in Parañaque City, while Terminals 2, 3, and 4 are in the neighboring Pasay City.\n\nThe metro or subway system does not connect these airport terminals at the moment. The only way to get there and out is via private transport, shuttle buses, or taxis.\n\nBy Bus\n\nThere is a free shuttle bus going to all terminals that runs every 15 minutes, depending on traffic. Given the heavy traffic in Manila during the day and early evening, it may not be the best idea if you are pressed for time (e.g., if you have a connecting flight with a layover of less than 4 hours).\n\nYou can also take the Airport Loop buses from all terminals. It will take you from the airport to Baclaran, Pasay Rotonda, Taft Avenue station of the Manila Metro Rail Transit System (MRT), and Manila Light Rail Transit System (LRT) in Pasay. Taft Avenue is the closest light rail station to the airport. Both MRT and LRT1 have a Taft Station and are connected with each other by a walkway.\n\nAnother option is the P2P (Point-to-Point) buses called the UBE Express. Fares vary depending on your destination. These buses run on four fixed routes, stopping at selected hotels and shopping malls, while other buses stop at big bus terminals. Check the P2P bus schedules here.\n\nBy Taxi/Cabs\n\nAll Manila airports have taxi stands. You can ride the following:\n\nRegular Taxi - White metered taxi/cabs with a fixed flag down rate and per kilometer fee.\n\nCoupon Taxi- Blue-marked white taxi/cabs that are dispatched by airport personnel and charge a fixed price\n\nYellow Airport Taxi - Metered taxi with a fixed flag down rate and per kilometer fee, but almost double than the regular taxis.\n\nTaxi scams at the airport are common. If the driver shows you a printed list of destinations and their corresponding prices, be warned that those rates are most probably overpriced.\n\nAnother red flag is when the driver doesn't use a meter and charges you ridiculous prices. To avoid the headache of getting scammed, use the official taxis (coupon taxis and yellow airport taxis).\n\nWhen someone outside the arrival area offers you a ride, say no. Often, these drivers (or their middlemen) will overcharge you. They might offer to help you with your bags, keep a tight grip on your belongings and say no, or ignore them.\n\nBy Car Booking App\n\nAnother recommended way to get out of the airport and into the city is through Grab, a ride-hailing app similar to Uber (Uber is no longer operating in the Philippines).\n\nGrab offers GrabTaxi (accredited regular metered taxi), GrabCar (private), and GrabShare (carpooling). Download the Grab App before arriving in the Philippines in case the airport WiFi fails.\n\nBy Car Rental\n\nThere are car rental services in Manila that you can avail of, including Manila van rentals, SUV rental in the Philippines, and luxury car rentals in the Philippines. Self-drive car rentals in the Philippines like budget car rental in the Philippines are also available in all Manila airports (except Terminal 4). Just make sure you have the requirements to rent a car in the Philippines. You can book a car rental in Manila in advance so you can pick up the car at the airport or their designated pick-up points in Manila.\n\nIf you're driving in Manila, we highly recommend using GPS navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze. Traffic in Manila needs a lot of patience and excellent driving skills, so make sure to prepare yourself if you're driving here for the first time.\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nFor first-time visitors, Manila can be a bit overwhelming to explore by public transportation. When exploring Manila tourist spots, you’ll need to learn about the several types of public transit that ply the roads of this bustling metropolis.\n\nThe fastest way of getting around is via train. Three lines are operating in Manila: Manila Metro Rail Transit (MRT), Light Rail Transit 1 (LRT1), and Light Rail Transit 2(LRT2). The other modes of transportation are the tricycle and jeepney, both unique to the Philippines.\n\nYou can also hail a taxi or use car booking apps or a motorcycle booking app if you want to explore Manila.\n\nMRT and LRT\n\nThe Manila Metro Rail Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) run across major roads in Manila and connect Manila's north and south areas. The MRT traverses Epifanio de Los Santos Avenue (EDSA), while LRT1 and LRT2 have routes crossing Pasay, Manila, Caloocan, and Quezon City.\n\nIf your hotel is somewhere in the city of Manila, Makati, Pasay, or even Quezon city, you can ride the MRT or LRT. Be warned though, that the MRT and LRT are very crowded during rush hour (7 AM to 9 AM and 5 PM to 9 PM on weekdays).\n\nHowever, if you travel during the off-peak hours, the MRT and LRT offer the quickest way to slice through Manila's notorious traffic jams.\n\nYou can purchase single-journey tickets/cards (one way) or stored value cards (reloadable BEEP cards) in any station in MRT, LRT1, and LRT2. Reloading can be done at any station, as well.\n\nThe single-journey tickets are exclusively used in each line where you purchased them, while the reloadable BEEP cards can be used in all three lines. If you'll be riding the MRT and LRT a lot while in Manila, purchasing a BEEP card is highly recommended.\n\nSource: Light Rail Transit Authority\n\nMRT\n\nMRT runs along EDSA, from Taft Avenue to North Avenue in Quezon City. This line gives travelers access to Roxas Boulevard, Makati, Mandaluyong, San Juan, and Quezon City. You can take this line if you want to explore Makati tourist spots and Quezon City attractions.\n\nLRT1 and LRT2\n\nThere are two LRT routes, LRT1 and LRT2. LRT1 is the first among the three light rails in the Philippines, while LRT2 is the newest. A walkway in Doroteo Jose station connects LRT1 and LRT2.\n\nLRT1 runs from Baclaran to Monumento. It lets you explore areas in Roxas Boulevard or Pasay area, Makati, Manila, and Caloocan. Beyond Caloocan are mainly residential areas not frequented by travelers.\n\nLRT1 cuts through most of the city of Manila, which makes it the best transit to ride to get to popular Manila attractions such as Binondo, Intramuros, and Rizal Park.\n\nLRT 2 has the shortest route. It runs through Metro Manila's East to West areas. It starts in Manila and ends in Marikina City, with stops along Quezon City and San Juan City. LRT 2 may be the shortest line, but it can still take you to Manila tourist spots. You can ride the LRT 2 to get to Binondo and San Sebastian Church in Intramuros, which is the only all-metal building in the country.\n\nJeepneys\n\nJeepneys or jeeps are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines along major and some small roads. These are initially the US-made military jeeps left over from World War II.\n\nJeepneys have become an iconic symbol of Philippine culture and art. These can accommodate up to 20 passengers, depending on the size of the jeepney. Riding these open-aired vehicles in the streets of Manila offers an interesting experience for first-time visitors.\n\nYou can hail these anywhere on most Manila roads, but take note if there are designated loading and unloading stations in the area. Each jeepney has a sign on its windshield that indicates its last stop and 1 or 2 other significant stops along its route. Find out first which route you need to take before riding a jeepney.\n\nPayments are handed to the driver at the front during the ride. If you're seated at the far end of the jeepney, the other passengers can pass it to the driver for you.\n\nLocals say \"Bayad po, \" (Here's my payment) when handing the money to the driver. It is so the driver can compute how much your fare is since it varies on your pick-up point and destination.\n\nWhen you're about 5 to 10 meters away from your stop, locals will say \"Para po!\" (Please stop) to notify the driver to slow down and stop at the nearest unloading station.\n\nTricycle\n\nMotorized tricycles, or simply tricycles, are the local form of the auto-rickshaw similar to Thailand’s tuk-tuk. These public utility vehicles ply a set route in inner roads. They are usually found in terminals where passengers line up to wait for their turn to board one.\n\nThese can also be hired like taxis in some areas if their route allows it. Built in a variety of styles that differ from city to city, these are usually made locally by building a sidecar affixed to a motorcycle. These can usually accommodate 2 to 4 passengers only.\n\nTaxi or Car Booking App\n\nFor those who only have a short time in the city and want a hassle-free journey, the best option is to take a taxi or book Grab using the Grab App.\n\nWhile Grab is usually more expensive than riding jeepneys or buses, these can ensure you can get around safely and in comfort. You don't have to do multiple transfers, which is convenient for travelers coming from and going to the airport.\n\nMotorcycle Booking App\n\nMore adventurous travelers can choose to book with the Angkas app, which is similar to Grab Motorbike in other countries like Vietnam.\n\nIf you are traveling solo, you can use the app to hire a rider to pick you up and take you to your desired location. It is especially significant if you are in a hurry since motorcycles can navigate through heavy traffic easily.\n\nWhere to Stay in Manila\n\nPhoto from the Philippine Department of Tourism\n\nManila is made up of multiple cities, and traveling from one city to another can be time-consuming, especially during rush hour.

The majority of locals can speak and understand English. Make sure to greet the locals with a simple \"Hello\" to initiate a conversation. Don’t worry, they’re friendly and can accommodate most of your questions.\n\nSafety Tips\n\nWatch out for pickpockets when commuting and keep your valuables safe, especially in crowded areas like Cubao, Binondo, and Makati Avenue. If you’re planning to walk alone at night, make sure to keep your bags close to you. Always be aware of your surroundings.\n\nWhat to Pack\n\nWear light clothing when going to nature parks, and bring lots of water. It's best to bring a jacket or umbrella with you in case of rain. Don’t forget to bring a small bag when you’re going on a sightseeing trip! It will be more comfortable when you're walking along minor roads, especially if you plan to shop.\n\nCommuting Tip\n\nThe weather in Manila can get quite hot and humid, so be sure to bring drinking water while going around. Although vendors are selling bottled water everywhere, it is best to bring your water bottle to stay hydrated and minimize plastic waste.\n\nLike in most big cities, it’s best not to wear fancy jewelry and carry all your valuables with you when doing sightseeing trips in Manila. Secure all your essential items and money in anti-theft bags.\n\nMake sure to do some research as well on standard costs of fares and other items. Most Filipinos can speak English. Don’t be afraid to ask for help from locals if you need information on the amount paid for jeepney fares or directions if you get lost.\n\nSample Itinerary in Manila\n\nFor first-time visitors to Manila, here's a sample itinerary that should cover all the bases in just two days.
