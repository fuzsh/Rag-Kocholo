        "text": "Warhol, Andy [http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1c/warhol1cl/darbanville.html Warhol Stars- Patty D'Arbanville] ]\n\nCareer\n\nEarly recognition\n\nDiscovered by Andy Warhol, during a gig as a club Disc Jockey at age 13, she acted in her first film in 1960; a New York University student film \"Tuesday And Blue Silk\" in 1960. Having been raised in New York's Greenwich Village, D'Arbanville had dropped out of school at 14 and traveled around the country. Andy Warhol eventually cast her at age 16 in his 1968 film \"Flesh\".\n\nFlirting with fame\n\nIn the late 1960's she pursued a career as a model in London, where she met Cat Stevens and they developed a romance from 1968-1970. She was the inspiration for at least two of his hit songs: \"My Lady D'Arbanville\", and \"Wild World\", which were recorded on \"Mona Bone Jakon\", and \"Tea for the Tillerman\". She left him for periods of time to continue her modeling career in Paris, and New York City, and was a peripheral part of the Warhol's Factory scene. In an interview with Warhol, she said wistfully, that she'd heard the song \"My Lady d'Arbanville\"; saying, \"Steven wrote that song (Lady d'Arbanville) when I left for New York. I left for a month, it wasn't the end of the world was it? But he wrote this whole song about 'Lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still.' It's about me dead. So while I was in New York, for him it was like I was lying in a coffin... he wrote that because he missed me, because he was down... It's a sad song.\" Stevens had adopted a stage name which D'Arbanville never used; instead preferring his true name, Steven Demetre Georgiou."
