After returning to America to appear in \"Rancho Deluxe\" (1974), D'Arbanville was featured in \"Time After Time\" (1979), played Ryan O'Neal's floozy girlfriend in \"The Main Event\" (1979) and appeared in \"Modern Problems\" (1981) and \"Real Genius\" (1985) before essaying her most challenging role, portraying Cathy Evelyn Smith--D'Arbanville's one-time friend and John Belushi's drug dealer--in the film biography of the \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian, \"Wired\" (1989)."
