He made albums about drug use and how bad it was for not only adults but one specifically for children too which is beyond creepy.\n\nThe lengthy four part documentary is an interesting journey, in which you can see why many black people were so determined to not believe the allegations because he was 'America's Dad', who educated white people into seeing black's as three dimensional people and more than stereotypes. Even when he polarised black people toward the later years with speeches which blamed poor black Americans, he was still held with respect and when finally acquitted over legal mishandling by the prosecution, he still has many black and white people who choose to turn a blind eye because of what he represented in comedy for young whites but more especially betterment for black people\n\nA quick google offers the uncomfortable news that he is saying that 2023 is his year to tour.

Pretty much on the record about the 14 year old 'groupie'/'girlfriend'.\n\n'I wouldn’t want this for anybody’s daughter': will #MeToo kill off the rock'n'roll groupie?\n\nMale rock stars of the 1970s and 80s were often notorious for sleeping with young female fans.

It can only be thought that he paid off some and not just gave them a college credit.\n\nThen there's Tyson, who's beloved again and yet a convicted rapist.\n\nHowever, the power dynamic argument is another mine field, in which it's always assumed the ,(typically) man is in control and thus guilty.\n\nWhere did I put my NIN Star _)kcker Inc. track...\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 16, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n3,112\n\nReaction score\n\n2,544\n\nPoints\n\n1,036\n\nLocation\n\nU.K\n\nMar 19, 2023\n\n#11\n\nEpisode 3 tonight 9pm BBC 2 3/4\n\nCosby strikes gold with The Cosby Show, a genre-defining family sitcom and monument to black excellence.

There are two trials, a conviction, incarceration and appeal, and in 2021, an overturned verdict. Now, the debate turns to what is to be done with beloved works of art and the larger systemic problems Cosby’s story lays bare"
