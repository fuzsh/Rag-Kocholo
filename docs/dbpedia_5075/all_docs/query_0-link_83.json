        "text": "Did anyone notice how chummy Daniel and Emma were during the Golden Globes?\n\nMaybe he got drunk again and asked her if she wanted to be in Bond 25.\n\nThe issue is I think this is where the rumour stems from. She just recently worked with his wife, so of course people are going to link her to James Bond.\n\nEmma Stone is excellent. And anyone who has seen The Favourite will know she can do a decent English accent. Dakota Fanning is also not a bad actress but frankly I don't really see either of them in B25. With Lea Seydoux already expected to return, this seems like far too many 20/30 year old female characters. I am not generally a fan of American actresses in Bond (Barbara Bach being an exception) but wouldn't object to either. Just seems unlikely.\n\nAmerican actres i sugest before\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm0001091/ Patti D'Arbanville, 67 years old (1951)\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm0005034/ Amy Hunter, 52 years old (1966)\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm1293475/ Jennifer Lothrop, 44 years old (1974)\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm0250743/ Susan Egan, 48 years old (1970)\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm0005447/ Leelee Sobieski, 35 years old (1983)\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm3037833/ Eloise Mumford, 32 years old (1986)\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm3006818/ Analeigh Tipton, 30 years old (1988)\n\nI also like to see more older ones, but even have sugestion born in 1991, before she get more fame Shailene Woodley https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0940362/\n\nAnd then we have my quantum leader sugestion include Catherine Zeta-Jones (Uk born, but more American in my opnion), Andie MacDowell (1958) and Jane Fonda (1937).\n\nOf course i think further then only lead Bondgirls.\n\nMatera is interesting, as some have already said was used in the Passion of The Christ as a stand in for Jerusalem 2000 years ago.\n\nI can say from experience there really is nowhere in Europe quite like it, when my Wife, her Mum and sister were on holiday in 2017 in southern Italy, Puglia this was on our schedule.\n\nI don't mind saying it was the undoubted highlight of the holiday and while I think I've possibly seen enough of Puglia, Matera I would definitely return to, it's really quite stunning.\n\nI would likely say it's doubling for somewhere else, could well be somewhere in the Middle East, I'll be very surprised if this is going to be Italy.\n\nWOW! what with Jamaica and now Matera rumoured, as well as Norway and Cadiz could Bond 25 be the pinnacle of all Craig's films for locations?\n\nIn Cary Fukunaga we trust!\n\nWell I have a feeling they might be definitely not true. Dakota Johnson was spotted shopping in LA yesterday and Emma Stone was spotted filming Zombieland 2, so if the article that states rehearsals begin tomorrow is true, shouldnâ€™t they be getting their arses to London?\n\nBut if Emma is filming Zombieland 2, is she going to have the time to go work on a James Bond film?\n\nSticking Elizabeth Taylor and Julie Andrews (both great), in Goldfinger would be stupid. 50 years later, nothing has changed.\n\nTrue. I agree that big names can take you out of a Bond film. I don't think Fiennes as M was particularly helpful. He has too much baggage.\n\nI\n\nI agree with you. Part of the joy of watching a Bond film was getting to see an international cast you were unfamiliar with. You would get to know actors who are well known in their respective countries on a larger stage. Sometimes, you even got a complete unknown who got a chance at a star-making turn.\n\nHowever, it's seriously difficult to not get excited at the notion of either Johnson or Stone joining.\n\nIn a world where Marvel casts are stacked to the hilt with A-list talent (I mean, just look at the Infinity War cast list!), it be remiss of Eon to not court big names.\n\nPerhaps Stone is Bond's daughter - akin to Logan. I'm certain she's playing an English character after Eon saw The Favourite"
