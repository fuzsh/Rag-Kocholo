        "text": "An ex-city firefighter found out “it takes a village to make a movie” when 40 of his Sea Cliff, L.I., neighbors – including actress Patti D’Arbanville – helped quench his burning desire to become a filmmaker.\n\nThe result is “The Chumley Factor,” a 24-minute short that will premiere tomorrow night at – where else? – the Sea Cliff firehouse and at Costello’s Pub, where much of the film was shot.\n\nMike Lennon, 46, started pursuing the dream of seeing his name on the big screen after an injury forced him to leave the FDNY.\n\nA professional who read the screenplay advised him to try making the film.\n\nLennon recruited “actors,” brewed the coffee, lugged the props – and was able to convince soccer moms to play hookers, and enlisted dozens of other upscale Sea Cliff residents to play barflies, junkies and other roles in the 24-minute short.\n\n“Nobody wanted a dime for anything. It takes a village to make a movie,” chuckled Lennon, who began filming in January.\n\nD’Arbanville, who is currently seen on NBC’s “Third Watch” and just wrapped up the film “Enter Fleeing,” said she was pleasantly surprised at Lennon’s script – and energy.\n\nHe “was always ready to roll,” said the TV and film star, whose children attend the same school as Lennon’s.\n\n“It was a town project – he grabs people. He did things instinctively that seasoned directors do because they’ve done it.\n\n“I saw it today for the first time, and I got teary. It was so sweet, you want to hug it. It’s a labor of love and it shows in every frame.”\n\nLawyer John Canning, a former GOP legislator with a distinctive upper-crust voice, said he jumped at the starring role in the film.\n\n“Ronald Reagan went from acting to politics and I thought I’d try it in reverse,” Canning chortled. “I really enjoyed doing it. From my experience in government, I was used to the delay on the set.”\n\nCanning plays the title character, blueblood Darryl Chumley, who discovers he was switched at birth with another baby named Chumley – whose parents are blue-collar workers from The Bronx.\n\nD’Arbanville plays Stella, a wisecracking Queens bar owner who teaches Chumley how the other half lives.\n\nCanning lamented the lack of a love scene with his sexy co-star.\n\n“Patti was great but there’s a no-nudity clause in my contract – it’s the first time a studio has insisted on it,” Canning joked. “I’m a Republican, and I don’t take off my clothes.”"
