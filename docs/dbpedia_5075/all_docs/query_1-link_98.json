Serves her right!\n\nHee hee! Yep, I said it!!\n\nOh, and being the astute collector of monumentous memorabilia that I am...I bought it!\n\nPost by hyacinth on\n\nI NEVER believed that she LEFT him for Mick J. NOBODY is that crazy! I think that she just wasn't ready to settle down and wanted to have an acting career. Obviously, they were on very different trajectories.\n\nSo, Richina, just when is the Open House in your museum, er . . . I mean home, for all the Majicat members? ;D\n\nPost by richina on\n\nI NEVER believed that she LEFT him for Mick J. NOBODY is that crazy!

Obviously, they were on very different trajectories.\n\nSo, Richina, just when is the Open House in your museum, er . . . I mean home, for all the Majicat members? ;D\n\nWell, if you say she wasn't ready to settle down...then I have to believe it! Since you are a walking encyclopedia on CS and PD, I will defer to your illustrious mountain of knowledge!\n\nAnd as far as opening the uh, museum....\n\nwhen the boy comes to the states, PARTY AT MY HOUSE!!!!!\n\nPS And since you live just one state over Hyacinth....you gonna come help me clean house for the party??\n\nPost by hyacinth on\n\nProbably half of what I think about PD and Cat is totally wrong. That's why a certain someone should write a thorough autobiography and get it all out there, including the inspirations for his songs. But I don't think that's going to happen!\n\nUh, Richina, I'm seeing a pattern here.

Some people didn't like the content but... what the heck....\n\n\"Patti D'Arbanville reads from Pamela Des Barres' new book 'Let's Spend the Night Together: Backstage Secrets of Rock Muses and Supergroupies' at Soho McNally Robinson on July 9 2007. The text concerns her own relationship with Cat Stevens back in the 60's\"\n\nPost by hyacinth on\n\nOh, dear. Yes, this was discussed before. As a Westerner, I don't find the story itself shocking - just adventurous young love. I bet many of us have fond memories of our own exploits, there was this time that I . . . but we don't televise them! I would think it would be uncomfortable for Yusuf if he knows of her blabbing it on camera, but perhaps he takes it in stride.\n\nShe seems to do and say pretty much as she pleases, which makes her an interesting character; but she's also paid a price in her personal and professional life for this. And she'd be the first one to admit it. I think if her DNA were analyzed, she'd be found to be missing the \"inhibition gene.\"\n\nPost by hyacinth on\n\nThis is the kind of uninhibited and therefore, to me, humorous comments PD makes. This is from a People magazine interview with her, April 3, 1989. \"In 1975 she married French actor Roger Mirmont and became a junkie. 'I didn't want to be an alcoholic,' she says, 'so I decided to do drugs.' \"\n\nHere's a recent self-reflection on her life . . . \" ' We get to pretend for a living. What’s better than that?' said actress Patti D'Arbanville at her Performing Arts Master Class at Crites Hall [in Savannah], Nov. 1 [2010] . . . While she talked about exciting things in the industry, she didn’t shy away from the corruption that can come with success. She spoke with honesty about past drug problems.\n\nWhen asked if she had any regrets, she told the students, 'It took a long time to get rid of and come out of [addiction]. It’s a waste of f***ing time and energy. Nothing good ever comes out of it—ever. Don’t try anything; it’s all a gateway.' \"\n\nTheir relationship inspired some unbelievably beautiful songs, so we benefitted from their heartbreak. I'm just glad that Y. found happiness, and PD seems pretty resilient.\n\nPost by hyacinth on\n\nThanks, Glaucus. I know of the movie Bilitis but hadn't seen this t.v. performance. I think she made an album in French? Hard to believe that at this time she was deep into heroin addiction, but she went cold turkey (I think the next year). She's had quite the life.\n\nShe should have left the singing to Cat, though.\n\nCheck your PMs. I'm sending you a message.\n\nPost by hyacinth on\n\nA July, 2012, interview with Patti D'Arbanville. It was posted online in Sept. Apparently, she watches Cat YouTube videos sometimes!\n\n\"I remember seeing him perform 'Matthew and Son' years before we actually met. You can see the clip on Youtube and it has dated a lot. But he looked so cute in his black and white suit . . .\"\n\nwww.money-into-light.com/2012/09/patti-darbanville-talks-to-paul-rowlands_6010.html\n\nPost by Sir Lorry Load on\n\nA July, 2012, interview with Patti D'Arbanville.

How interesting to know that Patti D. still has a place reserved in her heart and mind (and, apparently, too, at least an ember, or two, aglow) for Yusuf.\n\nThank you for sharing this, Hy...

I'm sure Yusie is glad he won't have to deal with any more \"stories\"!"
