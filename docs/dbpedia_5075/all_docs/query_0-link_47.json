        "text": "This week's choice is Patti D'Arbanville, also known as Selena Davis!\n\nThis bio continues Gone but Not Forgotten month in the community. Patti's life was a decent part of the reason I thought to do this theme. Enjoy!\n\nPatti was born on May 25, 1951 in New York City to George D'Arbanville and Jean Egan. In 1960 she made her first appearance in a NYU student film called Tuesday And Blue Silk. At the age of 14 she dropped out of school and began traveling. While working as a DJ in a club when she was 16, she was discovered by Andy Warhol. He put her in his film Flesh when she was 17. After that she started modeling, working in France, England and New York. At 5'4\", she is the shortest person to ever work at Wilhelmina. She has been married 3 times, Terry Quinn (1993-2002) with three children, Steve Curry (1980-1981), and Roger Miremont (1975-1980). She has also been in a few very public relationships, including Cat Stevens and Don Johnson, with whom she has a son.\n\nPatti joined GL in 1998 and stayed until 2000.\n\nFun Facts:\n\n- Cat Stevens wrote \"Lady d'Arbanville\" and \"Wild World\" about her\n\n- Fluent in French\n\n- Lived in Europe for ten years\n\n- She has seven tattoos\n\n- She taught Andy Warhol how to crochet\n\n- For a full list of projects she has been involved in, please click here.\n\n- For a list of projects she has been involved in after leaving GL, please click here.\n\n- Another World as Christy Carson from 1992-93\n\nThe picture is linked to its source.
