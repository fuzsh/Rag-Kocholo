Feb. 6, 1893, Sialkot, Punjab, India [now in Pakistan] - d. Sept. 1, 1985, Lahore, Pakistan), Pakistani politician. He entered the Punjab Legislative Council in 1926 and was a delegate to all three Round Table Conferences on Indian reforms in London (1930, 1931, 1932). In 1931-32 he was president of the All-India Muslim League, and in 1935-41 he was the Muslim member of the viceroy's executive council and was knighted. He was called upon to represent the government of India abroad and in 1942 was sent as agent general to China to open direct diplomatic relations with the Kuomintang regime at Chongqing. At this stage, his instinct was to preserve the unity of India; he hoped for a just settlement of Muslim demands without partition. But when it was announced that Pakistan would come into being, he resigned from the Federal Court of India where he had been serving from 1941 as a judge, and opted for Pakistan. He presented the Muslim League's case to the commission under Sir Cyril Radcliffe which was to decide the boundary between the two states. After partition, he became foreign minister of Pakistan (1947-54). He was deeply involved in the disputes with India over Kashmir and the waters of the Indus, presenting his country's case at the UN. In 1954-61 he was a judge of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague. He was Pakistan's permanent representative at the UN in 1961-64 and president of the UN General Assembly in 1962-63. He was again a judge of the ICJ in 1964-73 and its president in 1970-73. He belonged to the Ahmadiyya sect, which was declared non-Muslim by the Pakistan National Assembly in 1974; thereafter he lived in England, visiting Pakistan only infrequently.\n\nZafy\n\nZafy, Albert (b. May 1, 1927, Betsiaka, Madagascar - d. Oct. 13, 2017, Saint-Pierre, Réunion), president of Madagascar (1993-96). A former minister of social affairs (1972-75), he founded the opposition party National Union for Democracy and Development in 1990. In May 1991, he launched a campaign against Pres. Didier Ratsiraka, blaming him for the underdevelopment of the country's economy. In July 1991 the opposition coalition Comité des forces vives named him \"prime minister\" of a provisional government, with Jean Rakotoarison as \"president.\" In August he was reportedly fired upon by Ratsiraka's presidential guard. In October, he reached an agreement with the regime to set up a transitional body of power, the High Authority of the State (of which he became president), to prepare for the presidential election in November 1992. He led over Ratsiraka 45%-29% and went on to defeat him in a runoff in February 1993, 67%-33%. The powers of the president, which had been reduced in the 1992 constitution, were increased again in a referendum in September 1995. In July 1996 parliament passed an impeachment motion against him, on the grounds that he had failed to promulgate certain laws. In September the High Constitutional Court upheld the validity of the vote, removed him from office, and ordered new elections; he narrowly lost to Ratsiraka in another runoff in December. In 2001 he only came a distant third, but he continued to lead a significant opposition faction and was one of the four leaders who signed power-sharing agreements in August and November 2009.\n\nZagafuranov, Fayzrakhman (Zagafuranovich) (b. Oct. 10 [Sept. 27, O.S.], 1913, Suleymanovo, Ufa province [now in Bashkortostan republic], Russia - d. Sept. 5, 1975, Ufa, Bashkir A.S.S.R., Russian S.F.S.R.), chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Bashkir A.S.S.R. (1950-67).\n\nZagari, Mario (b. Sept. 14, 1913, Milan, Italy - d. Feb. 29, 1996, Rome, Italy), justice minister of Italy (1973-74). He was also minister of foreign trade (1970-72).\n\nZaghlul\n\nZaghlul Pasha (ibn Ibrahim), Saad, Arabic Sa`d Zaghlul Basha (ibn Ibrahim) (b. July 1857, Ibyanah, Egypt - d. Aug. 23, 1927, Cairo, Egypt), Egyptian statesman; son-in-law of Mustafa Fahmy Pasha. He was minister of education (a newly created post) in 1906-10 and minister of justice in 1910-12, resigning after a disagreement with the khedive Abbas Hilmi II. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1913 and became its vice president. He soon became the principal spokesman of the nationalist movement. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Egypt became a British protectorate and the Legislative Assembly was dissolved. Discontent grew during the war, and on Nov. 13, 1918, two days after the armistice, a delegation (wafd) of three prominent former members of the Assembly, led by Zaghlul, informed the British high commissioner that they regarded themselves and not the government as the true representatives of the Egyptian people and demanded independence. This was initially refused, and Zaghlul temporarily exiled to Malta in 1919, but in 1920 the British essentially agreed to it. But when Zaghlul refused to endorse any agreement, he was deported to the Seychelles in 1921. Transferred to Gibraltar in 1922, he was released in 1923 to take part in the first elections under the new constitution of the nominally independent Egypt. His Wafd Party dominated the January 1924 elections and he became prime minister. When negotiations for further British concessions failed, serious disorders erupted again and numerous British officials and Egyptian \"collaborationists\" were murdered by extremists. After what amounted to an ultimatum from the British high commissioner, Zaghlul resigned in November. He later contented himself with the presidency of the Chamber but remained the most influential politician in Egypt.\n\nZahar\n\nZaharieva\n\nZahar, Mahmoud, Arabic Mahmud al-Zahar (b. 1951, Gaza city, Gaza Strip), foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority (2006-07).\n\nZaharieva, Ekaterina (Spasova Gecheva-) (b.

In 1931 he married Princess Homaira (d. 2002). In 1932 he became assistant war minister and in 1933 acting education minister. He came to the throne at the age of 19, after the assassination of his father. Until 1963 his older relatives ran the government, but then he took control and ushered in the constitution of 1964 which guaranteed civil rights, gave women the right to vote, and barred the royal family from holding high-level government posts. He followed a program of economic development, including irrigation and highway construction, accepting aid from both the United States and the Soviet Union. He maintained Afghanistan's neutrality in the Cold War, as he had in World War II. In the early 1970s the country suffered drought and famine. Pashto tribes along the Pakistan border continued to press for autonomy, and his reforms seemed to have little effect outside the Kabul area. In a bloodless coup on July 17, 1973, Zahir Shah, who was in Italy at the time, was deposed by his brother-in-law, Gen. Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan, who proclaimed Afghanistan a republic with himself as president. Zahir Shah formally abdicated on August 24 and remained in exile in Rome. He could only watch as Afghanistan descended into decades of civil war from 1978. In 1991 he suffered stab wounds in an assassination attempt. In 2001 he was considered as a possible head of an interim government for his country. He returned to Afghanistan on April 18, 2002, but said he had no plans to regain his throne. He was allowed to live in his former palace and granted the title \"Father of the Nation.\"\n\nZahiruddin bin Syed Hassan, Tun Syed (b.

He was a 10th-generation descendant through the male line from Abdullah ibn Hassan, grand sharif of Mecca in 1630-31. A high-school classmate of King Hussein, he served in the army for 35 years, becoming known for his courage. He commanded a Jordanian armoured brigade in the 1967 Middle East War that tried to prevent an Israeli advancement into the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In 1968, he fought in the Battle of Karameh when Jordan forced out Israeli troops advancing into Jordan to fight Palestinian guerrillas engaged in cross-border attacks against Israel. During the Black September War of 1970 when Jordan fought a bloody conflict against the Palestine Liberation Organization, he assisted the army commander who crushed the insurgents and thwarted their attempt to topple King Hussein. The king recognized his achievements and loyalty by naming him army chief commander in 1976 and later field marshal. He also became chief of the royal court (1988-89, 1989-91, 1993-95). As prime minister for the first time in 1989, he implemented political reforms Hussein introduced following violent riots fueled by price hikes that widened into calls for public freedoms. He held the first general elections after a 22-year hiatus sparked by Jordan's loss of the West Bank to Israel. The soft-spoken, cunning army commander revived a multiparty system banned in 1956 and initiated steps toward abolishing martial law, which had been enforced since the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948. The moves earned him his countrymen's respect. Months after his last prime ministerial duty in 1996, he was made an emir, or prince - a move aimed at sending him into retirement as royal title holders are banned from acquiring public posts.\n\nZaimis, Alexandros (Thrasyvoulou) (b.

Oct. 29, 1826, Brescia, Lombardy, Austrian Empire [now in Italy] - d. Dec. 26, 1903, Maderno, Italy), prime minister of Italy (1901-03). A combatant in the volunteer corps during the war of 1848, he returned to Brescia after the defeat of Novara. Elected deputy in 1859, he received various administrative appointments, but attained a political office only in 1876 when the Left, of which he had been a prominent and influential member, came into power. Minister of public works in the Agostino Depretis cabinet of 1876, and minister of the interior in the Benedetto Cairoli cabinet of 1878, he was overthrown with Cairoli in December 1878, but returned to power as minister of justice in the Depretis cabinet of 1881. Abandoned by Depretis in 1883, he remained in opposition until 1887, when he again joined Depretis as minister of justice, retaining his portfolio throughout the ensuing Francesco Crispi ministry until 1891. After the fall of the Giovanni Giolitti cabinet in 1893, he made a strenuous but unsuccessful attempt to form an administration.

Returning to the presidency of the Chamber, he again abandoned his post in order to associate himself with the obstructionist campaign against the Public Safety Bill (1899-1900), and was rewarded by being enabled to form an administration with the support of the Extreme Left in 1901. Although the period was marked by strikes, he decreased excessive taxes on the poor and put an end to strikebreaking by the army.

April 10, 1919, Chinameca, Morelos), Mexican revolutionary. In 1897 he joined a village protest against the hacienda that had appropriated the peasants' lands and was arrested for his rebellious attitude. After obtaining a pardon, he organized new protests. He supported Francisco Madero against dictator Porfirio Díaz in 1910-11 but when Madero refused to return the ejidos (communal lands) to the villages, Zapata prepared the Plan of Ayala, the signers of which vowed to expropriate, with payment, a third of the area of the haciendas; those haciendas that refused to accept this plan would have their lands expropriated without compensation. The Zapatistas, under the slogan \"Tierra y Libertad\" (\"Land and Liberty\"), adopted guerrilla tactics. On Nov. 24, 1914, he ordered his Liberation Army of the South, numbering 25,000 men, to occupy Mexico City, where he and Pancho Villa visited the National Palace and promised to fight together until they put a civilian president in the palace, and Villa accepted the Plan of Ayala. At the height of his success Zapata controlled Morelos and large parts of adjoining states. In those areas he destroyed the haciendas and gave land to his followers; he also attempted to establish schools and social services. He won various battles, but in 1917 Venustiano Carranza's generals defeated Villa and isolated Zapata. In 1919 Zapata was trapped when one of Carranza's officers, Jesús Guajardo, pretended to rebel in favour of Zapata, and as proof of his loyalty even killed some Carrancista soldiers, then requested a face-to-face meeting. When Zapata arrived, Guajardo's troops presented arms, ostensibly as a guard of honour, but at a sign from their leader fired on and killed Zapata.\n\nZapata, Ernesto (b. 1863, Tacna, Peru - d. 1925), interior minister of Peru (1900-01, 1906).

He early joined the Social Democratic Party and became secretary of the stonemasons' union in Kladno. His political activities earned him a term in jail in 1905. On his release, he became trade union secretary of the Social Democratic Party in Kladno and political secretary of the Kladno Trade Union Federation. In 1911 he was elected to the Kladno town council and again he served a jail term for political activity. After army service in World War I he was named secretary-general of the Social Democratic Party in Kladno. He organized a general strike in the Kladno mines and smelters in 1920 and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. While he was in jail, the party split in 1921, and he joined the new Communist Party on his release and was named secretary of its Prague district. He was elected to the Czechoslovak parliament in 1925, but devoted most of his time to organizing a Communist labour federation, becoming its secretary-general (1929-39). During the Nazi occupation he was confined in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. On his release by Soviet troops in 1945 he became chairman of the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement, composed of all of Czechoslovakia's organized labour, and a deputy to (and in 1946 briefly chairman of) the National Assembly. He was a major architect of the successful Communist takeover of the government in 1948, when he became a member of the political secretariat and premier of Czechoslovakia.

In 1987 he married Benazir Bhutto, who would become prime minister a year later. Arrested on kidnapping and extortion charges, he was imprisoned in 1990 but released on bail in 1993, and the last charges were dropped in 1994. Nevertheless, corruption allegations against him multiplied (he was nicknamed \"Mr. 10%\" for the kickbacks he was said to have received on government contracts during Bhutto's tenure in office). He was a member of the National Assembly in 1990-96 and served as minister of water and power (1993) and investment (1996) and chairman of the Environmental Protection Council (1995-96). He aggressively sought control of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), but was the subject of ever-increasing criticism from within and outside the party. A family feud led by Bhutto's brother, Murtaza, and mother, Nusrat, ruptured the PPP; the conflict between Zardari and Murtaza over leadership of the Bhutto clan ended abruptly on Sept. 20, 1996, when Murtaza was shot and killed by police. Zardari was implicated in Murtaza's death, and, following Bhutto's second dismissal in November 1996, he was arrested on charges that included corruption, money laundering, and murder. Although never convicted, he was imprisoned from 1997 to 2004; elected from his jail cell in 1997, he was a senator until Pervez Musharraf's military coup in 1999. In 2007 he was given amnesty for his alleged offenses. Following Bhutto's assassination in December 2007, he named his son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari chairman of the PPP and made himself co-chairman. In the parliamentary elections of February 2008, the PPP and the party of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif formed a coalition government. In August 2008 Zardari and Sharif led the movement to impeach President Musharraf, who then resigned. However, sustained feuding between the two ultimately caused Sharif to withdraw his party from the coalition. Zardari easily won the indirect presidential elections of September 2008. Friction between the two rivals continued. Never popular and always shrouded in controversy, Zardari nevertheless made history simply by presiding over the first civilian government in Pakistan to complete a full term in office and hand over to another at the ballot box. In 2019 he was arrested again on money-laundering charges but released months later. Under a coalition deal brokered after 2024 elections marred by rigging claims, the PPP would take the presidency and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) the prime minister's position, and he was elected president again.\n\nZarev, Kiril (Dimitrov) (b.

Dec. 27, 1951, Mexico City, Mexico), president of Mexico (1994-2000). In 1971 he joined the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). As undersecretary (1987-88) and secretary (1988-92) of planning and budget, he successfully controlled Mexico's immense foreign debt, reduced the inflation rate from 160% to about 8% in five years, and helped balance the budget. As secretary of education (1992-93), he decentralized the public school system, attempted to raise literacy, and oversaw a revision of history textbooks that played down the role of some revolutionary heroes. In 1993 he became campaign manager for PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, and when Colosio was assassinated on March 23, 1994, Zedillo was chosen to replace him. He campaigned on promises to open and modernize Mexico's economy. On August 21 he defeated eight other candidates with 50.2% of the vote; it was the closest victory in the PRI's history. Taking office on December 1, he promised to spend more money on education, health, and basic services while maintaining a balanced budget, but his hopes were quickly dashed when the stock market plunged, and on December 20 he was forced to devalue the peso by about 14% against the U.S. dollar and then allow it to float, leading to a further drop in value. In 1995 he accepted the terms of a U.S. bailout package. As a result of a 1996 agreement to reduce PRI control over the political process, he became, after the 1997 elections, the first Mexican president in decades to face a Congress not dominated by the PRI. With him also ended a 71-year PRI hold on the presidency. Following his initiative, the PRI had held its first ever primary elections in 1999; in the past, Mexican presidents had effectively handpicked their successors. The chosen candidate then lost the 2000 election.\n\nZedkaia\n\nZedkaia, Jurelang (b. July 13, 1950, Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands - d. Oct. 7, 2015, Majuro), president of the Marshall Islands (2009-12). He was speaker of the Nitijela in 2008-09.\n\nZeeland\n\nZeeland, Paul (Guillaume) van, from 1963 Paul, vicomte van Zeeland (b. Nov. 11, 1893, Soignies, Belgium - d. Sept. 22, 1973, Brussels, Belgium), prime minister (1935-37) and foreign minister (1935-36, 1949-54) of Belgium.\n\nZeevi, Rehavam (b. June 20, 1926, Jerusalem, Palestine - d. Oct. 17, 2001, Jerusalem), Israeli politician. He served in the Israeli army from its creation in 1948 until 1974, ending up as a general and chief of operations on the general staff. He was nicknamed \"Gandhi\" because of his skeletal frame but had nothing else in common with the Indian pacifist leader. After Israel's seizure of the Palestinian territories in the 1967 war he headed the central military region including the occupied West Bank, where he waged an effective campaign against the infiltration of Palestinian guerrillas from Jordan. He left the army in 1974 and entered politics, becoming adviser on counterterrorism to Labour prime minister Yitzhak Rabin until 1977. He founded the Moledet (Homeland) party in 1988 and entered parliament on a platform including the \"voluntary\" deportation of Palestinians to Arab countries. In 1991 right-wing prime minister Yitzhak Shamir named him a minister without portfolio. The party was renamed \"National Union\" for the 1999 elections, when it won four seats in the 120-member parliament. In March 2001 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon made him tourism minister, though he would have preferred internal security; he soon became a strong critic of the government, accusing it of being soft on the Palestinians and calling for more raids into the Palestinian territories. He finally announced his resignation in protest at Sharon's decision to withdraw tanks and troops from Palestinian areas of Hebron. The resignation was to take effect on Oct. 17, 2001. Early that day he was shot and fatally wounded in an East Jerusalem hotel, in an attack claimed by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in reprisal for Israel's assassination of its chief in August.\n\nZegarra Arana, Juan Pablo, finance minister of Bolivia (1992-93).\n\nZegers Samaniego, Julio (b.

He was also minister of environment and conservation (1987-88, 1992-95).\n\nZejnullahu, Jusuf (b. Feb. 9, 1944, Svirce, near Medvedja, Serbia), chairman of the Executive Council of Kosovo (1989-90). In 1999 he moved to the U.S., where he became a citizen in 2005.\n\nZekovic, Veljko (b. Dec. 28, 1906, Niksic, Montenegro - d.

In 2023 he became director of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration.\n\nZelaya (Rosales), José Manuel (b. 1988?), defense minister of Honduras (2022- ); nephew of Manuel Zelaya.\n\nZelaya (López), José Santos (b. Nov. 1, 1853, Managua, Nicaragua - d. May 17, 1919, New York City), president of Nicaragua (1893-1909). He was made a general in 1885, and led the Liberal Party in the revolt (April-June 1893) which overthrew Pres. Roberto Sacasa, ending 30 years of Conservative dominance. A new constitution was proclaimed, and he became president. He kept power by playing the Liberal and Conservative parties against each other and established an unswerving dictatorship. He developed railroad and steamer transportation, coffee growing, and education, but nevertheless drained Nicaragua's resources for his own profit. In 1894 he sent a force to the Mosquito Coast, establishing full Nicaraguan sovereignty over the area. He fomented revolutions in neighbouring countries and tried to reestablish the Central American federation with himself as head. His ambitions created intense opposition, which led to the Washington Conference of 1907 and the establishment of the Central American Court of Justice. The United States was highly antagonistic to him, and the presence of U.S. cruisers helped rebel forces to overthrow him. Early in 1910 he was finally forced to flee to Mexico.\n\nM. Zelaya\n\nZelaya (Rosales), (José) Manuel, byname Mel Zelaya (b. Sept. 20, 1952, Catacamas, Olancho department, Honduras), president of Honduras (2006-09). He served as a legislator in 1985-98 and was director of the Honduran Social Investment Fund in 1998-2000. As a major theme in his campaign for the presidency, he put forward \"citizen power\" - a new form of government seeking greater participation from ordinary people in the political decision-making process and in the effort to secure government accountability. An affable man, with easy communication skills, usually appearing in a wide-brimmed hat, he was elected as the candidate for the ruling Liberal Party in 2005. Since late 2007, he swung towards the leftist pole around Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez. In 2008 Honduras joined the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). In June 2009 he sought to hold a referendum to gauge the level of support for a further referendum to be held at the time of the November presidential elections on the setting up of a body to review the constitution. It was widely believed to be intended to remove the presidential one-term limit. Just before voting was scheduled to start, he was overthrown in a military coup supported by most of the civil establishment, which afterwards attempted to give a legal cover to his removal; he continued to be recognized by most countries as the legitimate president. After the military initially exiled him to Costa Rica, he later managed to enter Honduras and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy, but he failed to return to power, and when his regular term ended in January 2010, he left for the Dominican Republic. He returned to Honduras in May 2011.\n\nZelaya Ramírez, Félix Pedro (d. Feb. 7, 1923), finance minister of Nicaragua (1898-1903).\n\nZelayandía (Cisneros), (Gregorio) Ernesto (b. 1963? - d.

Oct. 4, 1879, La Concordia, Jinotega department, Nicaragua - d. [killed] Oct. 4, 1912, Barranca Coyotepe, Masaya department, Nicaragua), supreme chief of government of Nicaragua in rebellion (1912).\n\nZelenin\n\nZelenin, Dmitry (Vadimovich) (b. Nov. 27, 1962, Moscow, Russian S.F.S.R.), governor of Tver oblast (2003-11).\n\nZelenovic, Dragutin (b. May 19, 1928, Temerin, north of Novi Sad, Yugoslavia [now in Vojvodina, Serbia] - d. April 27, 2020, Novi Sad), prime minister of Serbia (1991). He was also rector of the University of Novi Sad (1987-89) and a member of the Presidency of Yugoslavia (1989-91).\n\nZelenoy, Aleksandr (Alekseyevich) (b. Aug. 26 [Aug. 14, O.S.], 1819, St. Petersburg, Russia - d. March 21 [March 9, O.S.], 1880, Yalta, Russia), Russian minister of state properties (1862-72).\n\nZelensky, Isaak (Abramovich) (b. June 22 [June 10, O.S.], 1890, Saratov, Russia - d. [executed] March 15, 1938, Moscow, Russian S.F.S.R.), first secretary of the Communist Party of the Uzbek S.S.R. (1929).\n\nV. Zelensky\n\nZelensky, Volodymyr (Oleksandrovych) (b. Jan. 25, 1978, Krivoy Rog, Ukrainian S.S.R. [now Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine]), president of Ukraine (2019- ). He was known as a comic actor who in one television series (\"Servant of the People,\" 2015-19) played the role of a teacher who unexpectedly becomes president of Ukraine. But fiction turned into reality when in 2019 he was elected to the very post after an insurgent campaign that railed against corrupt politicians influenced by rich oligarchs. While he denied being influenced by anyone, he was himself supported by oligarch Ihor Kolomoysky, who had clashed with incumbent president Petro Poroshenko. Zelensky defeated Poroshenko in a runoff 75%-25%. In 2021 he signed an \"anti-oligarch law\" which ultimately allowed the president to decide who is an oligarch, giving him power for selective targeting. But domestic issues were swept away when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, mainly to prevent it from joining NATO. Zelensky dashed any expectations that he might flee the country and leave it to collapse quickly; instead he rallied the people to a determined defense. Henceforth he appeared typically in a military-green T-shirt rather than suit and tie, and he spent much effort on asking (sometimes rather demanding) support from the West, addressing (usually by videolink) almost every Western parliament, down to Iceland and Luxembourg. Immense military and financial aid in fact poured into Ukraine. Initially he allowed negotiations with Russia, and they seemed close to agreement in April 2022 (involving Ukraine giving up its NATO ambitions), when Western leaders apparently persuaded him to fight on. But despite a limited success in a counteroffensive later in 2022, actually defeating Russia seemed increasingly unrealistic, and the prophesy of Prof. John Mearsheimer from 2015, that the West was leading Ukraine down the primrose path and the end result would be Ukraine getting wrecked, appeared to come true. Zelensky formally ruled out any further talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin in October 2022 after Russia annexed four Ukrainian regions. No reliable casualty figures were published, but at least tens of thousands were killed on each side; with Russia having more than three times the population, but unlikely to have that much higher losses, a war of attrition was hard to win for Ukraine, leading the West to consider increasingly dangerous options. Zelensky's term ran out in 2024 without new elections, while Russia continued to occupy some 17% of Ukrainian territory.\n\nZeliang\n\nZeliang, T(aditui) R(angkau) (b. Feb. 21, 1952, Mbaupungwa village, Assam [now in Nagaland], India), chief minister of Nagaland (2014-17, 2017-18).\n\nZeligowski, Lucjan (b. Oct. 17, 1865, Oshmyana, Vilna province, Russia [now Ashmyany, Belarus] - d.

Sept. 13, 1960), premier of Sarajevo canton (2012-14).\n\nZeller\n\nZeller, Adrien (b. April 2, 1940, Saverne, Bas-Rhin, France - d. Aug. 22, 2009, Haguenau, Bas-Rhin), president of the Regional Council of Alsace (1996-2009).\n\nZema, Romeu, Neto (b. Oct. 28, 1964, Araxá, Minas Gerais, Brazil), governor of Minas Gerais (2019- ).\n\nZemaitis\n\nZemaitis, Jonas, byname Vytautas (b. March 15, 1909, Palanga, Russia [now in Lithuania] - d. Nov. 26, 1954, Moscow, Russian S.F.S.R.), Lithuanian resistance leader. An artillery captain in the army of independent Lithuania in 1937-40, he joined the armed resistance against Soviet rule in 1945. He tried to centralize the armed underground forces throughout Lithuania and form a general leadership for partisans. In February 1949 he summoned a congress which established a united resistance organization, the Lithuanian Movement for Freedom; he was elected chairman of its Council, which was declared the supreme political body of the nation, and was conferred the highest military rank of \"Freedom Fighter - General of Partisans.\" In May 1953 he was arrested and transported to Moscow, where he was executed the following year. After the restoration of Lithuanian independence, he was posthumously awarded the rank of brigadier general in January 1998, and on March 12, 2009, he was retrospectively recognized by the Seimas (parliament) as president of Lithuania (Feb. 16, 1949-Nov. 26, 1954).\n\nZeman\n\nZeman, Milos (b. Sept. 28, 1944, Kolín, Bohemia and Moravia [now in Czech Republic]), prime minister (1998-2002) and president (2013-23) of the Czech Republic. In 1968, he joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, from which he was expelled in 1970 due to his opposition to the invasion of the Warsaw Pact armies in August 1968 and the \"normalization\" regime. He actually entered politics in August 1989 when he published an article in the Technický magazín monthly in which he unusually sharply criticized the Communist regime. After the November 1989 revolution, he assisted in the foundation of the Civic Forum (OF), a dominant anti-Communist movement for which he was nominated as deputy to the Federal Assembly. As a deputy (1990-91) he presented himself as a sharp critic of coupon privatization, a project engineered by people around Václav Klaus, then finance minister, which he branded \"the swindle of the century.\" After the split of the OF, Zeman entered the Civic Movement (OH), one of the successor entities. In the mid-1992 elections, however, he ran for the Czechoslovak (later Czech) Social Democratic Party (CSSD) and was elected to the last Czechoslovak federal parliament. In 1993-2001, he was chairman of the CSSD, initially a rather unimportant opposition party (it had gained about 7% of the vote in 1992), which, however, under his leadership became one of the two major political parties in the Czech Republic. He served as chairman of the Chamber of Deputies in 1996-98. The CSSD's victory (with 32% support) in the 1998 elections catapulted him to the premier's post. His political style included insults and disputable lashing-out at his political rivals, which often ended in court, and his verbal attacks on journalists were legendary. He retired after one four-year term, with the CSSD's popularity intact. In 2003, he was an unsuccessful presidential candidate. In 2007 he left the party as a result of his conflict with its leader Jirí Paroubek. In 2013 he was elected president as candidate of the Party of Citizens' Rights, founded in 2009 to enable his return to public life. He took right-populist stances against immigration and sexual minorities and endorsed Donald Trump for U.S. president. In 2013, following the collapse of a government, he ignored a coalition that had a majority in parliament and named a new government of technocrats led by his adviser as prime minister. In 2019 the Senate voted to charge him with failing to act in line with the constitution in eight cases, including a repeated failure to appoint proposed government ministers.\n\nZemgals, Gustavs (b. Aug. 12, 1871, Dzukste parish, Russia [now in Latvia] - d. Jan. 6, 1939, Riga, Latvia), defense minister (1921-23), president (1927-30), and finance minister (1931-32) of Latvia.

At the age of 18 he joined the French army and was transferred to the armed forces of Upper Volta in 1961, a year after the country had become independent. A former parachutist, he served in Indochina and Algeria and then received advanced training at a school in Fréjus, France, that was reserved for future cadres in the armed forces of Africa and that trained many political leaders who later came to power in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1971 he entered the École Supérieure de Guerre, leaving in 1972 as the first officer from Upper Volta to gain his diploma from the school. He was Upper Volta's foreign minister in 1974-76. After holding various commands he became director of the Bureau of Studies of the armed forces staff. On Nov. 25, 1980, Colonel Zerbo, then commander of the combined forces regiment in Ouagadougou, overthrew his ranking superior, Maj.Gen. Sangoulé Lamizana, president of Upper Volta since 1966, and became the country's new ruler at the head of a Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress. Born in the same village as his predecessor, Zerbo was publicly rumoured to be Lamizana's cousin and, despite the latter's confinement to house arrest after the coup - which involved no loss of life - it was said that they had acted in agreement. Speaking in December 1981 on the anniversary of the establishment of the republic in 1958, Zerbo referred to the \"spectres of thirst, famine, disease, and ignorance\" that the nation had to continually struggle to overcome. He said that although progress had been made, minimal needs had not yet been met, and that self-sufficiency in food would be the Military Committee's first priority.

Chadli Bendjedid and became ambassador to Romania (1990-91). In 1993 he was named defense minister, and in January 1994 he was appointed president of the state by the High Security Council. Two attempts to broker peace negotiations with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Algeria's main opposition party, ended in failure, but he continued to express an openness to future negotiations if the FIS renounced the use of violence. He won an easy victory in Algeria's first multicandidate presidential elections on Nov. 16, 1995. He immediately pledged to be \"a president for all Algerians\" in a bid to limit the impact of civil war that has raged in the country since 1992, when the military-backed regime cancelled elections that the FIS was poised to win. However, the conflict - which pitted Muslim fundamentalists against the Algerian security forces - continued. In May 1996, he unveiled proposals for constitutional reforms aimed at resolving the crisis. Although the FIS rejected his blueprint, most legal opposition parties voted in favour of the reforms at a national conference in September and the new constitution was approved by referendum in November. In September 1998 he surprised the public by announcing early presidential elections in which he would not take part.\n\nZerpa (Guerrero), Iván (Antonio) (b. Feb. 23, 1958), Venezuelan diplomat.

He served as a field commander with the Communist guerrilla Red Army that was fighting both Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and Japanese invaders, joining in the epic Long March - the Red Army's 12,000-km retreat west to escape Chiang's encircling forces in the mid-1930s. During World War II, Zhang was the commander of a guerrilla band sent to rescue U.S. flight crews who crash-landed in China following the April 1942 bombing raid on Tokyo commanded by Lt.Col. James H. Doolittle. The raid provided a huge psychological boost for the United States after Pearl Harbor, proving that the United States could hit Japan. A decade later, Zhang faced off against the Americans as the head of an army corps in the 1950-53 Korean War, returning home to serve in a series of progressively higher positions in the government, party, and army.
