        "text": "Many of the ideas central to Western politics can be traced back to ancient Greece, and more specifically, to the ancient Athenian city-state. Indeed, classical Athens is often referred to as the birthplace of democracy itself. From the eighth to the fifth century BCE, a series of legislative reforms and popular revolts alike saw power (kratos) wrested out of the hands of nobility and placed among the people (demos). Average citizens passed, voted, and deliberated on laws in the assembly and played an important role in deciding upon matters of right and wrong as jurors in the courts. During Athens' period of direct democratic government, Plato wrote his most famous tract, The Republic. Yet the canonical text has come to be known for its rebuke of, rather than celebration of, democratic rule. Plato's student Aristotle, for his part, was not himself a citizen of the famed Athenian city-state in which he wrote his Politics. What are we, contemporary readers, to make of these disjunctures? This course serves as an introduction to political theory as a sub-field of political science, as well as an introduction to ancient political thought. We will spend our semester reading Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics closely, paying particular attention to how it is that these thinkers view the relationship between justice and democracy. Is popular judgment in matters of right a crucible of democratic government? Can justice exist absent democratic governance? We will focus our attention on these questions in class, with some reference to contemporary issues. Our primary goal, however, will be to attend to the form and substance of the arguments put forward in these canonical texts. After surveying the arguments made for and against democracy by these thinkers and learning about the mechanisms of democratic government and popular judgment in ancient Athens, we will turn our attention to the thought of Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Farabi. al-Farabi was an important interpreter of both Plato and Aristotle and is considered the father of Islamic political philosophy. In our last classes, we will think about the legacy of \"the ancients\" or \"the Greeks\" and learn about how it is that their texts were passed down to us by way of early medieval Islamic philosophers. In doing so, we will consider how the history of political thought is narrated and told, pondering upon the questions of justice that are raised by its telling.\n\nThe aim of this article is to delineate a comprehensive account of the development of human civilization in terms of increasingly representative structures of governance, structures that make people more and more present on the upper echelons of decision-making. I hypothesize that there are three essential dimensions of this development: first, media of communication becoming increasingly abstract makes society increasingly conscious of itself because it gets the ability of self-reflection and self-critique from increasingly complex perspectives that do increasing justice to the society; second, the anthropomorphizing/relativizing of the increasingly creative forms of life; third, if the law-making is conducted within the exchange of perspectives in which the being and the people are properly represented, the laws thus issued make societies increasingly free (1) from the dictate of violent power (2) and to practi—Åe the art of interdependence, that is, to create new models of coopera...\n\nWhen thinking about populism, one of the first images coming to mind is that of populist leaders and their rhetoric. Abhorrent as their words may be to those who do not share their views, the real danger of populism lies of course in what populist politicians do or intend to do to the institutions of liberal democracies. In my contribution to this volume, I should like to examine several key features of populism, notably the institutional connection between populism and democracy. I argue that the democratic principle of representation is one of the essential factors underlying present-day populism. Turning next to the democracy of Classical Athens, I discuss some similarities and differences, and see what institutional instruments were in place in Athens to address this problem."
