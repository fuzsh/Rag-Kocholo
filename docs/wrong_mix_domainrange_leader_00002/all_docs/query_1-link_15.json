He is a member of Collaboration O, where he works as an independent designer and collaboratively with the other studio members. <br /><br />Taking a humorous and playful approach, many of Mastenbroek's works reveal a nostalgic perspective on our relationship to money. He uses storytelling as a tool to reflect on society, often resulting in interactive installations made in collaboration with musicians, composers, and programmers.<br /><br />Frank is a cuckoo clock featuring an animated character called Frank. According to Mastenbroek, Frank is an expert on time and being punctual; he is never too early or too late. Mastenbroek's project offers a playful perspective on our ideas about managing the daily nine-to-five routine.",

        "text": "Alessandra Scalora\n\nIllustrator and urban beekeeper Alessandra Scalora of House of Honey was selected during the Scout Night in Eindhoven. Scalora creates work on bees with materials she finds and conserves during beekeeping. Inspired by the bee, returning themes are the environment, women's emancipation and feminism, collaboration and her own history. During the talent development year, Scalora wants to develop a clear, personal style, research the Sicilian beekeeping culture and set up a community of female beekeepers. In particular, she wants to gain knowledge so that she can make pigments from flowers and experiment with different painting and material techniques. Through literature research and taking workshops, Scalora wants to learn from other artists. Scalora intends to start collaborations with Paddy Johnson, Nan Groot Antik, Ellen Gallagher, Cleo Goossens, Margarita Osipova, Yolande van der Heide, Marieke Pijler, and Masharu. At the end of the year, House of Honey will present ten new works in an exhibition at TAC. Scalora will also make her first photo book.\n\nAlyson Sillon\n\nDesigner Alyson Sillon graduated from the Gerrit Rietveld Academie with a bachelor's degree in graphic design in 2022. In the development plan, Sillon describes the ambition of looking analytically at established and hidden visual codes through graphic design. She builds on the work Before/After, experiments with world-building and links three communication methods to them: narrative writing, visual creation and embodied manifestations. For the first communication method, Sillon wish to involves the expertise of a Black writer and critic to obtain a decolonial perspective, to work on writing stories. With 'visual creation', Sillon wants to get a better understanding of visual creatorship. To do this, Sillon will visit Tianzhuo Chen in Berlin and will make digital collages that will reflect on The Book of Drexciya by Abdul Qadim Haqq. Through the third communication method, Sillon wants to remodel her graphic design into embodied manifestations and performances. The designer will seek the expertise of choreographer Connor Schumacher and Michele Rizzo. In order to steer the project in the right direction, according to the maker it is crucial to possess production management skills. By attending Dweller festival in New York, Sillon will observe how you can reach an audience in the right way, and how you let this grow. The project will result in a showcase in a nightlife venue of Amsterdam. Lastly, Sillon will create a publication in which black heritage, techno and spirituality are linked to each other. The publication will be presented by Pamela, San Serriffe, After 8 Books, Presence Africaine and Do you read me?\n\nAmos Peled\n\nAmos Peled designs experiences in the audiovisual domain of art and performance. His work explores the definition of 'doubt' in relation to medical technology. Peled uses defamiliarization, alienation and doubt as methods to stimulate research into the human perception, the perception of oneself and the construction of intersubjectivity. This interest follows on from his own experience of growing up in a hospital environment. Here, he experienced and observed the work processes of the medical system, which are designed in such a way that there is hardly any room for doubt. In the coming year, he wants to introduce creativity into the medical environment, by working with the University of Twente Technical Medical Centre and the Leiden University Medical Centre and introduce medical technology into an artistic context. He will be mentored by artists Aya Ben Ron, Karel van Laere and iii.\n\nAnge Neveu\n\nAnge Neveu, who graduated from the Royal Academy of Arts The Hague, researches the rapid changes in the relationships between 'nature', technology and people and the blurring that arises between them. According to Neveu, these changes emphasize existing power structures, but they also offer new possibilities for co-existence and connection. As an observer, a storyteller and a designer, they want to tell these multifaceted stories from different perspectives, no matter how contradictory. In the talent development year, Neveu wants to further develop their voice as a researcher at the interface between eco-surveillance, production and reproduction technologies and non-normative desires, develop a polyphonic narrative style that speculatively, poetically and accurately combines words and images. Also, Neveu wants to develop new research and speculation methods for phenomena across the physical and digital world. Neveu will work on two projects: May your eyes never look away, may your genitals always be lubricated and Invasion Diaries. In addition, they will develop research methods in a smaller collaboration project and will learn practical skills, like scriptwriting, video editing and planning. Neveu will work with, amongst others, June Yu, Waag, Ine Gevers and Mari Bastachevski. The findings will be presented in a publication and during Waag's Open Evening Programme. Other locations where Neveu will present are FIBER, IMPAKT, International Film Festival Rotterdam, International Documentary Festival Amsterdam and Brussels Short Film Festival.\n\nAnna Torres\n\nAnna Torres is an artist, architect, a visual storyteller and a general spatial poet. Her work uncovers the various power structures that play a part in the so-called public space, in which gender, sexuality and homosexuality are central. In the coming year, Anna will research the spatial display of power at the Wallen (the Red Light District in Amsterdam). Anna intends to deepen her artistic sensibility and spatial knowledge, expand her network and investigate her own definition of what an architect is. She will take a spatial storytelling workshop and a multimedia course. She will be mentored by René Boer. The year will find form in a series of spatial drawings, architecture collages and critical texts that will be bundled in a publication.\n\nAnna Zan\n\nAnna Zan's architecture practice focuses on the cultural and artistic value of raw materials. Zan's work is an exploration of new, regenerative building materials. Up until recently, efforts in the field of sustainability specifically focused on energy consumption when using buildings, whilst interest in the carbon included in the construction was marginal. Replacing carbon-intensive building materials with regenerative resources from the biosphere is an important approach for making our built environment carbon-free. Using the Talent Development grant, Anna will work on two parallel studies (Material Cultures Limburg and Material Cultures NL) in order to deliver a contribution to the new, sustainable, local, material culture of the Netherlands. By means of this research, she will explore solutions for low-carbon construction in the Netherlands with a special focus on raw materials (plants and minerals). She will be supported and mentored by, amongst others, Oskam, NAP Ingenieurs, Werkstatt and Lucie Havel. Zan intends to go on study trips to Atelier Luma+Gernoble National School of Architecture and to Bolthauser Architekten+ETH Zürich material lab.\n\nAurélia Noudelmann & Laëtitia Delauney\n\nCuratorial and social design duo Aurélia Noudelmann and Laëtitia Delauney graduated from the Gerrit Rietveld Academie. Their practice focuses on hybrid spaces where new creation-based dialogues can be facilitated. Noudelmann and Delauney are driven to re-appropriate crafts dominated by men, in particular shipbuilding, by researching sustainable design methods, like upcycling and through inclusive structures offering scope to practices that focus on communities and specifically feminist and queer initiatives. Core themes and topics are intersectional feminism, upcycling, open source and shipbuilding. Using the Talent Development grant, they want to develop De Walvis project, a hybrid and modularly designed boat which can be used in all seasons as a residence and as a presentation space. To realize this, Noudelmann and Delauney will study shipbuilding techniques, build and test prototypes, and carry out upcycling experiments and learn about participative design. They will also develop an open, participative shipyard. Noudelmann and Delauney will work, amongst others, with Buurtwerkplaats Noorderhof, Fiona De Bell, Recycle Valley, and Bureau Double. Presentations will take place at Fanfare, Buurtwerkplaats Noorderhof, SAIL Amsterdam, and will be published on social media.\n\nChen-Yu Wang\n\nDesigner, artist, researcher, maker and factory girl, Chen-Yu Wang graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven. In these different roles, Wang translates Eastern and Western ways of thinking, written information in Mandarin and English, the implicit between material and immaterial and the dialogue between us and the other.

Buur's work will be presented in an installation at NEVERNEVERLAND.\n\nRosalie Apituley\n\nIn her work, product designer Rosalie Apituley focuses on the world around energy, the energy transition and communication problems related to this. In the coming year, Apituley wants to make new work for her Chasing Polar Bears project. She is challenging herself to take a more decisive and activist stance. Apituley will be mentored by Tega Brain, Sam Lavigne and Arne Hendriks in developing the speculative side of her work. Furthermore, she intends to take a course in Arduino and a residence on Spitsbergen. In 2024, she will present the results at The Solar Biennale and Springtij.\n\nSamuel Rynearson\n\nGrafisch ontwerper Samuel Rynearson onderzoekt de symbiotische relatie tussen de digitale en fysieke wereld. Een centrale vraag die hij stelt, is: hoe beïnvloeden objecten onze omgeving en vice versa? Een belangrijk thema in zijn werk is 'het ongewone' als een kenmerk van objecten, een ruimte tussen genres en classificaties, en een plaats voor verhalen die nergens anders thuishoren. Tijdens zijn talentontwikkelingsjaar zal hij de verschuiving van uitsluitend digitale kunst naar het creëren van fysieke objecten verkennen, die geworteld zijn in de digitale wereld. Dit zal vorm krijgen in een serie fysieke objecten die samen met ontwerper Jonathan Looman tuinen in Den Haag zullen sieren. Rynearson zal samenwerken met diverse ontwerpers, beoefenaars en kunstenaars op verschillende gebieden, waaronder keramiek, 3D-printing, digitaal kunstenaarschap, materiaalonderzoek en schrijvers die zich richten op het concept van 'vreemdheid'. Daarnaast zal hij live teken- en AutoCAD-cursussen volgen om zijn beurs te ondersteunen. Het resultaat van dit onderzoek zal samenkomen in een open-source digitaal archief, ontwikkeld in samenwerking met Paul Bille.\n\nSandipan Nath\n\nSandipan Nath graduated in 2020 with a master's degree in Industrial Design from the Royal Academy of the Arts. In the talent development year, Nath will focus on the interaction between language, listening and the freedom of choice in relation to non-human ecological processes and animals. In addition, Nath will research political data and technologies behind machine-listening systems like automatic voice recognition (AVR) and language processing (NLP). Nath has set himself a number of objectives, including experimenting with alternative presentation forms, practising with and using AI tools, professionalizing sound and video skills, cultural business skills and business strategies. The development plan consists of three phases. In phase 1, Nath will work with sociologist Darko Lagunas and artist Theun Karelse to develop his research and storytelling skills. He will be mentored in this regard by Lucas van der Velden and Marijke Cobbenhagen. In phase 2, Nath will be experimenting, and he will be mentored by researcher Dr Ramon Amaro. Furthermore, Nath will take an AI coding workshop in Berlin. In phase 3, Nath will reflect on the activities he has done. The different phases will be presented in subpresentations and workshops, including at the Rijksmuseum Twenthe and V2_Lab.\n\nSébastien Robert\n\nSébastien Robert is an interdisciplinary artist and researcher. With his projects, he researches disappearing indigenous sonic rituals and cosmologies. Sébastien seeks to archive them by developing alternative recording techniques using sustainable materials that reflect the traditions and geo-specific characteristics of the communities. In the coming year, he will start IN-FOR-OUT-TOWARDS, a new artistic project that focuses on a trans-Mediterranean instrument: the bagpipe. This instrument reflects on the interconnectedness of cultures around the Mediterranean and takes a critical look at the definition of traditions. In creating the work, he will be mentored by instrument makers Leo Maurel and he will work with creative programmer Lucien Nicou. To refine his own technical skills, he will take a Rhino workshop, do a residency at GMEM in France and a performance residency at CAMP in France. The work will be presented at Grey Space in the Middle, at the Rewire Festival in The Hague and at the Scopitone Festival in Nantes.\n\nShanella Bleecke\n\nShanella Bleecke is a multidisciplinary maker. As a film maker, programme maker, journalist, curator and politician, she spreads untold stories of the new generation and gives them a stage. The priority in the talent development year lies in developing a plan for a documentary about Surinamese women, called MATA'S. Going through the entire process is an effective method to further develop her talents as a digital storyteller. She will be mentored in this by documentary maker and director Sacha Vermeulen. During this development process, Bleecke also wants to keep on networking with both established documentary makes and starting makers. For this, she wants to work with The Black Archives, the Surinaams Nationaal Archief and Eye Filmmuseum. Bleecke's work specifically focuses on the Dutch-Surinamese community - for her presentation she wants to produce an exhibition in collaboration with Kunst is Leuk.\n\nSjoerd Willem Bosch\n\nDesigner Sjoerd Willem Bosch studied at the Technical University Delft and wants to create contemporary architecture in the Ommelanden, the countryside around Groningen. He regards his role as an architect as a mediator between the landscape, inhabitants and future scenarios. Topics Bosch works on include the loss of biodiversity and social and economic inequality which are manifested in the Groningen landscape as subsidence, salination and earthquakes. Using the grant, Bosch wants to broaden and strengthen his position as an architect in the non-urban landscape and obtain his architect's degree. His plan includes taking weekly walks in Ommeland as a 'listening architect' and meeting up with inhabitants from Groningen, officials and landscape experts, amongst others. Some of those Bosch will work with include Rien Korteknie, Sijas de Groot, Lieke de Jong, Zef Hemel, Christian Ernsten and Rubén Dario Kleimeer. The information gathered will be documented in models, sensory maps and drawings. Presentations will be given shape in articles on Platform GRAS, a Tumblr page, an exhibition and an essay.\n\nSun Lee\n\nSun Lee is a textile and social designer. She graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven with a master's degree in Social design. During the development year, Lee will further delve into the historical and cultural crafts of paper art and paper cutting. As a Korean designer working in the Netherlands, she always stands at the boundary between maintaining her identity and adapting to a new environment. This is why she deeply connects with the philosophy embodied in craft history. She sees it as a collection of cultures that has been accumulated in specific regions and time. As she builds her practice, she finds a deeper connection working within the craft realm. It is clear that in the past, mankind developed a craft culture through numerous cultural exchanges of each country. She believes the various representations resulting from these exchanges don't bring identity crises, but create opportunities for cross-cultural development. Her study aims to examine the similarities and differences between cultural contexts, while also building on existing studies that focus on the transmission of knowledge and skills between cultures as well as the role of crafts in shaping cultural identity. Lee will carry out research, experiments and will work with experts and makers, including the Vereniging voor Papierknipkunst, the author Jan Peter Verhavem, Sjamaan Buwon Joe, artist Jae Pil Eun and researcher Lim Seung-Bum. Lee will work on the presentation of the development year with June Yoon, an American visual designer who currently works for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. A final location will be selected in collaboration based on the reason behind the project.\n\nTessa van den Eeden\n\nFashion designer Tessa van den Eeden was selected during the Scout Night in Eindhoven. Inspired by our inner world, Van den Eeden sheds a light on difficult to discuss issues around mental health, like depression, burn-out and suicide, using haute couture. Using the Talent Development grant, she wants to realize a five-part design series, Les Finns, based on her own mental health struggles and realize a series of couture pieces, named US, realiseren, that tell the experiences others have with addiction. Van den Eeden will enhance her technical knowledge of and skills in materials and different body shapes by taking various courses. Van den Eeden will work with, amongst others, film maker Noël Oosterhof and music designer BLKTYLR, psychiatrists and addiction workers and marketing professional Eline Levering. At the end of the development year, she will have realized a digital portfolio and developed a presentation strategy.\n\nTofe Al-Obaidi\n\nGraphic designer Tofe Al-Obaidi (Studio Tofe) graduated from ArtEZ. In his practice, he explores the 'digital realm' with coding software like Processing and P5.js and animation software like Blender, Unreal Engine and Cinema4D. Through animation or VR, but also through physical objects, he processes his Iraqi background, the Arabic language and culture and his experiences as a refugee in his work. Al-Obaidi wants to use his work as a means or experience to help people to save or process memories. Recurring themes are fleeing, integration, traumas and loss. Using the Talent Development grant, Al-Obaidi wants to further develop his Removing Dust Covers graduation project, from telling his own story to telling the stories of others. To do so, he wants to become more competent with various software techniques, data analysis and interpretation, design skills, psychological insight and interdisciplinary collaboration. Studio Tofe will work with Wineke Salemink, Remco van Baren, José Huibers and Janine Zielman. The work will partly be presented digitally and, in part, physically in the form of an exhibition and presentation at Dutch Design Week.\n\nTycho\n\nTycho creates interventions in the public space. Their work mainly deals with urban change, which they use to address and visualize themes like the housing shortage and gentrification. During the development year, Tycho will focus on three goals. Developing their research and design methods, specifically aimed at the gentrification theme. Tycho will be mentored in this regard by Massih Hutak. Utilizing new contexts with the help of Bureau Ruimtekoers and Bouke Bruins. And developing technical skills by taking a course at MK24 and masterclasses by Michel Alders. The development year will lead to three interventions: one in the outdoor space, one in the public indoor space and one on the instructions of an organization.\n\nZobayda\n\nAudiovisual maker Zobayda was selected at the Scout Night in Rotterdam. With their work, Zobayda captures the queer and BIPOC community around her to enhance connections between people, knowledge and actions based on care. Zobayda is inspired by family beyond the nuclear and heteronormative structures, consisting of chosen family, close friends and loved ones. Zobayda's practice is non-individual, driven by the community and holds up a mirror to euro-centric views. The work can be expressed in film, photography, assembly and production. During the development year, Zobayda will work with theme rest. He will research this concept via literature studies, interviews and brainstorming with her community. Zobayda will also develop a sustainable business model and will learn about branding and building a brand identity. Zobayda will, amongst others, work with Yasmin Najiba, Setareh Noorani, Yasser Abubeker, Leyla Benouniche, Reda Senhaji, Ada M. Patterson and Rami Abadir. The findings will be presented via an archive website, a short film and an exhibition with panel discussions. Nieuwe Instituut and Bar Bario are possible presentation locations.\n\nZuzanna Zgierska\n\nZuzanna Zgierska is an interdisciplinary artist and researcher. She draws inspiration from indigenous relations with nature and is motivated to sketch climate conditions that escape the Western concept of 'classifying the world'. Zgierska is inspired by the capacity of minerals to store information and researches the possibility of rewriting colonial histories by means of geo-hacking. In the coming year, she will carry out a case study on the giant potbelly sculptures created by the ancient peoples of Monte Alto. To do this, she will do a residency on her own initiative in the Guatemalan Highlands. Here, she will work with Manuela Girón Recinos, an experienced film director and producer who specializes in this region. During the year, she will be mentored by Paulien Dresscher (art) and Annique van der Boon (science). In addition, Zgierska will take courses in hacking, scriptwriting and creative film editing to refine her artistic skills. The research will be published in an online reader and presented in spaces that go beyond white gallery environments. The actual space still needs to be defined, but local community centres and initiatives, education and workshop institutes, geological and scientific institutes and anthropological conferences are among the ideas.\n\nAfsaneh Ghafarian Rabe’I\n\nAfsaneh Ghafarian Rabe'I is an Iranian-Dutch self-taught photographer and visual artist. She creates layered images that translate into stories full of messages, symbols and paradoxes. 'As the daughter of migrant workers who ended up in the Netherlands in the late 1960s, I found out at a young age that the Netherlands is not the centre of the world, but that multiple realities can and do exist side by side.' This layered reality is also reflected in the techniques she employs. In addition to photographs she also makes collages, combining photography with paintings, screen printing and textiles.\n\nFor Parallel, which is due to be elaborated and released as a self-published art book, Ghafarian Rabe'I examines the parallel experience of second-generation Iranian Dutch nationals. 'It is specifically about the group that was born or grew up in the Dutch system as the result of a choice that their parents made. A world where the outdoors at first glance bears no resemblance at all to their roots. Iranians in diaspora are known for their rapid and successful integration and even assimilation. But the paradox is that many of them, despite not having been born or raised in Iran, maintain strong cultural links with their country of origin and often have a strong sense of homesickness and uprootedness.'\n\nBesides her experimentation with images, this year Ghafarian Rabe'I also worked on her positioning and profile. Her first venture was to design a stamp that bridges her two cultures. 'I find it important to leave a stamp behind, literally from my own point of view.' The prints and merchandise in her online shop fulfil an important role in her communication with her target groups. This year she also exhibited for the first time the photographic series MHD SKATE 1401 – LIFE GOES ON, about the skating generation Z in the holy Iranian city of Mashhad. The series was displayed as part of the group exhibition QOQNOOS – You Can't Burn Woman Made Of Fire, curated by the Iranian-Dutch artist Tina Farifteh.\n\nIt has also been a taxing year. A few weeks after she started the Talent programme, the Woman, Life, Freedom revolution broke out in Iran, triggered by the death of the young Kurdish-Iranian woman Jina Mahsa Amini. It turned the world on its head, certainly for Ghafarian Rabe'I as well. A number of her original plans could not be carried out, but other plans soon took their place. As she says: 'It's all part of my practice; you learn to be resilient from a very young age.'\n\nAlex Walker\n\nThrough his publishing project Mumbling Matter, graphic designer Alex Walker documents artistic practices that are grounded in resourceful, do-it-yourself and collective production methods. The project was launched in February 2023 with Growing Blue, a micro-site which hosts a collection of 102 paper and fabric filters that were used by textile designer Lucila Kenny to extract indigo pigment from the leaves of Dyer's Woad. Each individual filter shows different traces of the pigment, and as such are artefacts that capture a moment in time and an alchemic interaction with the plant.\n\nThe second project to be released as part of Mumbling Matter is Best of Days — a monograph documenting Octave Rimbert-Rivière's ceramic works. This book showcases the ceramist's experimental use of casting, glazing and the ways in which he incorporates digital 3D sculpture into the production process. Photographs of the works are reproduced using fluorescent CMYK, which emphasises the lively character of the objects.\n\nIn November 2023, Walker will launch the publication flower, fruit, leaf, husk and root: experiments in growing colour — another collaboration with Lucila Kenny and the third project to be released as part of Mumbling Matter. This publication documents the friendship and artistic collaboration between Kenny and artist Naan Rijks. Kenny and Rijks have a shared garden adjoining their studio which is part of their project Painting Plants. The publication contains conversations and photographs of the work, the studio and the artists' gardening activities. To share their knowledge and offer inspiration, the publication also includes a number of recipes. Each book has a unique silkscreen-printed cover, using homemade inks produced from plants in the artists' garden.\n\nAnna Wonders\n\nA strand of seaweed from a black beach on Iceland ends up on the workbench in Anna Wonders's studio in Zwolle. There, the seaweed is pressed into a synthetic rubber mould using a vulcanising press. After pouring wax into the mould, the wax replica of the seaweed is transferred into a cuvette, and plaster is poured in. Once the plaster has hardened, the wax is heated and poured off. The resulting mould can then be used to cast precious metals.\n\nWonders uses this ingenious and time-tested procedure to transform natural forms into gold and silver jewellery. Her latest collection is based on the curling form of a piece of seaweed. In the past year she was able to spend another month in the Icelandic studio where she performed her graduation internship in 2018, as part of the goldsmith education programme at the Vakschool Schoonhoven. She also invested in new equipment for her studio to enable the in-house production of her jewellery pieces. This marks a renewed start to her own business, with a shift in emphasis from commissioned work to developing her own work. To underline this new start, her own name is now the brand name. 'I think that the core of my discipline is about creating narrative. This is my story, alongside the customer's story.'\n\nAt the same time, Wonders is increasingly aware that, as a goldsmith, she is part of a chain. It's not just the relationship to the customer that matters, but she has also started contemplating her relationship to the people who mine the raw material – gold – for her. 'Being a goldsmith is a wonderful artisan practice, but when you really start looking into it, it often turns out to not be very sustainable.' That is why she works with Fairmined Gold: a quality label for gold sourced from responsible and small-scale mining organisations that guarantee that the gold is traceable and mined in a sustainable manner. Wonders also aims to increase this awareness among her customers and colleagues, and to show that you can choose for sustainably sourced gold. 'It's important to me that people choose my jewellery for the design, but also that they are happy with the backstage story. And that they want to join me in spreading this story and in that way to inspire others as well.'\n\nText by Roosmarijn Hompe\n\nAnni Nöps\n\nSound artist and electronic composer Anni Nöps started her talent development year with a residency in Zurich, at the Institute for Computer Music and Sound Technology. There, she studied how the movement of speakers affects sound. In the conceptual installation Becoming an ocean, speakers produce a static hiss – a monotonous sound when they are at rest, but when they move around it creates the impression of waves. That sensory aspect of sound is what fascinates Nöps. 'Part of my research for this development year is “sonic materiality”. I want to study sound in the broadest sense, but also from the perspective of how sound can feel physical and tangible in a space.'\n\nShe has now studied these qualities of sound in a museum setting for the first time. The sound installation Borderlands (a collaboration with sound artist Casimir Geelhoed) will be open to visitors in Stedelijk Museum Schiedam for six months. No fewer than twenty-two speakers have been installed in the museum's attic. As the sound moves between them, the dark room enhances the senses, creating an intimate experience. With regard to the title, Nöps explains: 'In a way, you feel as if the sounds are coming from very far away, so you feel that you are part of the same world as the sounds, as it were, but not always. That creates a space that exists between the real world and the imaginary or virtual world.'\n\nPresenting the installation in a museum allows a much larger and diverse audience to experience her work than at specialized festivals, resulting in different feedback than she is used to. She also intends to invite a choreographer to Stedelijk Museum Schiedam to respond to the sound with dance and motion (whereas usually in choreography, sound follows movement). Nöps is also working towards a music release, since she has also developed further in her compositions. Among other things, she participated in a mentorship programme to explore classical composition.\n\nAll in all, Nöps is satisfied with her development year. 'Being able to fully focus on my work has been amazing. It was wonderful to develop myself and be able to investigate things without knowing what the outcome will be.'\n\nText by Victoria Anastasyadis\n\nBenjamin Earl\n\nTechnology helps us in our daily lives, boosting our productivity and making our lives more efficient. Since completing his master's studies in Non-Linear Narrative at the Royal Academy of Art, tech artist Benjamin Earl sees technology in poetic terms. This year, he wanted to conduct research that would ultimately lead to a 'home-made' computer – a DIY computer that would serve not only as a tool but also as company. 'I came to know computers in a new way this year. Not just as a slick interface, but as something built up out of materials that I can play with.'\n\nIn this past year, Earl joined the Varia collective in Rotterdam, which employs technology in poetic ways. In his opinion, the closer you zoom in on technology, the more poetry there is to be found. 'The language used for coding, for example, but also the way we deal with technology as a society. With my work, I want to bring the intangible into the foreground.'\n\nWhile creating his computer, one aspect that Earl thought about was the power source. He chose solar energy. 'Using technology based on the sun's rotation is interesting. One direct consequence is that the computer does not work at night: like the rest of us, it sleeps.' A computer that 'goes to sleep' and functions in a cyclical manner: it is as poetic as our daily computer usage is prosaic. The fact that the computer does not function at all hours of the day is part of the project. 'You come to realise that there are limits to the way things were made.'\n\nFinding likeminded others was a challenge. 'I found it difficult to break out of my bubble,' Earl says. Fortunately he had the computer by his side, who gradually became a friend of sorts that travelled with him. 'It gained a personality of its own, and because it worked on solar energy, I could use it outside in the park as well.'\n\nThe computer will never be completely finished in Earl's mind – an attitude that he also adopts when talking about his project. Always open and inquisitive; not adamant, but possessed of a certain carefulness. This approach was well received at the symposium Naive Yearly. 'I involved the audience in my findings, and that yielded a lot of positive responses and suggestions, which felt very good.' That was the moment when Earl's bubble broke, and he was able to find the kindred spirits he had been looking for. Thus, his DIY computer graduated from good company to matchmaker.\n\nText by Priscilla de Putter\n\nPhoto by Camilla Marrese\n\nColin Wegman\n\nMusic producer and sound designer Colin Wegman was born in Curaçao and moved to the Netherlands with his parents at a young age. For many years, he had a wish to do something involving the island where his family came from and still lives. Curaçao is therefore central to the development plan that he submitted to the Fund. Through music, he hopes to become more intimate with the feelings that Curaçao arouses in him.\n\nWegman travelled to the island for a month. He met and talked with many people, visited museums, and conducted research in music archives. With the traditional music of Curaçao as starting point, he studied the musical instruments that play a role in this musical tradition. That led him to the tambú, a drum that is played during celebrations and has long been used to perform protest songs. 'I visited the workshop of the first and only woman in Curaçao who makes her own instruments, Tatiana. She taught me how to make a tambú. This instrument came to the Caribbean from Africa and has always been used as a political statement. It is also a ritual instrument: the rhythms are played quite fast and create a kind of trance that I recognise from night clubs. Techno music was always associated with resistance, too. I was able to collect all kinds of ingredients, like another instrument, a benta, to take back to the Netherlands and use in my composition. There are a lot of similarities between club music in the Netherlands and the music of Curaçao, that's something I want to work with.'\n\nBefore his trip, Wegman spent some time working with Cosmic Force (the stage name of Ben Spaander). 'Cosmic Force has been active as a producer of Electro music in the Dutch dance scene for many years. I worked with him in his studio and learned a lot from him. It was a valuable experience that will help grow further.'\n\nWegman would like to capture the beauty of Curaçao in several tracks. With that in mind, he made a large number of audio recordings during his trip. 'There are some things that everyone experiences in Curaçao – the way the wind blows, for example. Where my family grew up, the wind is always strong. That's very familiar to me. My grandmother's veranda is always lively, with people coming and going. There's always the sound of chatting and cars passing by. And there's always the wind, which carries sounds from far away as well. All that together creates a kind of mystical quality, which you'll definitely be hearing in my music.'\n\nText by Maaike Staffhorst\n\nConstanza Castagnet\n\nConstanza Castagnet's design practice focuses on sound, technology and performance. She is particularly interested in language and voices, which allow us to express ourselves in all manner of ways. 'That fascination has been with me ever since I was a toddler,' she says excitedly. 'I used to mimic all kinds of voices and experiment with high and low tones.'\n\nTalking in more depth about her work, the sound designer explains: 'I use sound, text, performance and video to create experimental environments in which I resist the temptation to use the voice as a shaper of meaning. I create eerie settings in which I use non-verbal and indefinable forms of expression to question our conventional understanding of communication.'\n\nCastagnet came to the Netherlands from Argentina in the fall of 2019 for a two-year master's programme, Approaching Language, at the Sandberg Institute. During her studies, she focused her research on singing as a way to dissolve the structures of language. She created compelling installations that encouraged people to reflect on how preconceptions about meaning, sense and misunderstandings can be changed.\n\nThe currently ongoing discussions about new technologies are a subject of great interest to Castagnet. 'I am intrigued by the ways in which new technologies affect our lives and how we express ourselves, especially the unexpected ways they can be linked to the creation of sound.'\n\nThe project is in part an homage to her great-grandfather, who composed tangoes around the year 1930, largely in the capacity of ghost writer for other musicians. 'His own works had been lost, there were no more sound recordings to be found, but during a family visit in Buenos Aires I discovered the existence of a number of original scores. I was seized by the idea that I could revive his music using technology. First, I arranged a quartet performance of his original scores, and recorded that music in order create an archive of his forgotten works. I also had the ensemble perform my own reinterpretations of his works. Now, I am in the process of creating my own compositions using the collected materials, while for example also using AI and other generative software to transfer the woody tones of, say, a cello to my own voice recordings, endowing my voice with a phonic quality that it does not have by nature. Using all of these materials, I am currently preparing an album, which will be followed by a live presentation. Thanks to sound, I can find some sort of connection with my great-grandfather, even though I never knew him.'\n\nText by Iris Stam\n\nDeborah Mora\n\nVisual artist and designer Deborah Mora has loved nature for as long as she can remember. She grew up near Lago Maggiore in Italy, surrounded by nature and greenery. In her work, too, nature is present everywhere.\n\nIn the context of her artistic practice, she is interested in storytelling through combinations of image and sound. Mora studies how these components complement each other, produce stories, convey meaning, have tactile qualities and physical sensations. 'I am curious as to how physical and sensory ways of telling stories can mesh with my image-focused practice, using physical and digital techniques,' the designer says. She creates her audiovisual experiences in collaboration with artists from other disciplines, such as sound designers and musicians. For example, Mora (stage name: Orah) presented an audiovisual performance at FIBER Festival 2023, accompanying the premiere of Kenny Kneefel's (Shoal) new album with visuals that immersed the audience in new worlds where reality and illusion merge.\n\nMora takes another stride forward in her new project, which is to create a live performance in interaction with her audience. Because she misses hiking and cycling through nature, the designer is – during a brief spell back in the area where she grew up in Italy – spending a lot of time outside, zooming in on plants, insects and rocks with her macro lens. The resulting photographs, videos and graphic 3D animations will then be combined with collaborations with musicians, sound designers and dancers. Mora also wants to embrace spontaneity, improvization and intuition. After all, as a designer she can exercise a great deal of control. 'Visuals can always be corrected, the work is planned and structured,' she says. 'I am learning to relinquish control by working with musicians, dancers and performers whose practices are based more on improvisation. By organising live audiovisual performances, I am learning to accept the unexpected. To experience the physical in person, I took an intensive dance workshop at Amenti in Rotterdam.'\n\nExactly how she will fuse together music, dance and the interactive live performance remains a bit of a puzzle. Once all the pieces click together, Mora will present the result at arts and culture festivals, such as the next edition of FIBER Festival in Amsterdam. Visitors will have the opportunity to form their own interpretations of what they hear and experience, and the nature of the connection they feel with the natural world that Mora has created.\n\nText by Viveka van de Vliet\n\nDérive\n\nHedwig van der Linden and Kevin Westerveld met at Delft University of Technology, where they were studying for their master's degree in Architecture. After gaining experience in various internships and workplaces, they founded Dérive in 2022. Operating from Brussels and Rotterdam, their research-driven design practice focuses on scenography, public space, landscapes, co-creation and strategy. The socially engaged duo does so in a world full of transition issues, for instance in the areas of climate, biodiversity, food, water and mobility. 'We want to take steps, to bring fresh air to those complex issues, by taking a conceptual and co-creative approach and by being attentive listeners,' says Westerveld.\n\n'We do so both upon request and at our own initiative, so that we can put issues on the agenda,' says Van der Linden. 'We are open-minded and embrace an intuitive and associative approach that lets us deviate from the established way of doing things. That deviation – whose meaning is encapsulated in the French word dérive – can be difficult because it requires more persuasion. But it also breeds excitement.' A sense of wonder, strolling around and studying environments at eye level are essential elements in Dérive's design practice.\n\nBuilding on what is already there and operating on a basis of equality and a plurality of perspectives are two further important principles for Dérive. 'We want to involve a diverse group in the development or redevelopment of a given area, and to stimulate a public dialogue,' says Westerveld. Van der Linden elaborates: 'We relate to each other like amphibians, we speak different languages: the tongue of politics as well as of the citizen. All so that we can increase the involvement of the local community.'\n\nThe duo's application for the grant centred around a further investigation of the dérive method and its potential applications in various areas for their design practice. 'Around the time when we were awarded the grant, we were also selected for the Young Innovators programme and got the opportunity to create an exhibition design in collaboration with AIR and OMI Rotterdam,' Van der Linden explains. 'That gave us the confidence to investigate whether we can make Dérive a full-time practice.' Westerveld adds: 'We are working on various projects, in both fixed and variable collaborations.' Van der Linden: 'With the Dutch Design Week approaching, we are also turning our attention to our visual identity and our website, to share insights with young designers about the dérive method and how to run a firm, based on talks with various experts.' 'Transparency is important to us,' Westerveld notes. 'It's going to be a showroom full of stories.'\n\nText by Iris Stam\n\nElif Satanaya Özbay\n\nElif Satanaya Özbay's background is in film and video. She obtained her bachelor's degree from Design Academy Eindhoven in 2013, and her master's degree from the Sandberg Institute in 2017. Through her research-based works, the artist – born in the Netherlands and of Turkish Circassian descent – seeks to decode diasporic nostalgia within the horror genre by producing performances, visuals and installations.\n\nWith her project How to Trace a Forgotten Diasporic Identity, Özbay wishes to further develop both her inner storyteller and her inner researcher, as well as to investigate how she can make materials and information more accessible.\n\nTalking about her background, the artist says: 'My ancestors come from Circassia and Abkhazia, an area in Caucasia, in northern Russia. Ethnic cleansing and genocides forced the Circassian people to flee in the late nineteenth century, creating a diaspora that halted the growth of this demographic group and caused their languages and cultures to slowly be forgotten.' Impassioned, she continues: 'I consider it an honour to create works around this theme. Even with my minimal knowledge, I can help resist this slide into obscurity. I believe that this is important for my community, and I also want to inform others about it. Most people don't know about Circassians, the region of Circassia or the genocide committed against Circassians.'\n\nÖzbay describes her project as 'research combined with performance, framed within the horror genre, using linking methods and mind mapping.' She explains further. 'I combine Circassian mythology, folklore and information about historic events with contemporary references, for instance from pop culture. The story's starting point is autobiographic. After that, I play with the idea that myths are born from a place of truth before gradually transforming into fiction. I use structure, but also intentionally create chaos. This way I try to tell my story in a playful and informative way, and to create new stories together with the audience.'\n\nFollowing a number of educational studio visits and meetings with researchers and members of the Circassian community, Özbay is now focusing on further elaboration and presentation. The first performance has already been held in Antwerp, while the second version will be presented during the Dutch Design Week. The third and final version will be presented in December, again in Antwerp.\n\n'The grant has given me freedom, recognition, time to conduct research, and opportunities to network and establish working relationships,' Özbay concludes.\n\nText by Iris Stam\n\nElizaveta Federmesser\n\nWhen Elizaveta Federmesser used AI to create new designs based on a database of images of modern jewellery, the software soon came up with the image of a coin. She quickly realized that this is the archetypal form of jewellery in many cultures. For Federmesser, this lucky find opened up the idea that 'instead of creating something new, you can also look at how the new is actually the super old.' It made her wonder whether for every object group there is a source object that we forgot but AI can remember. She applied for the Talent Development Grant with a plan to 3D scan objects from prominent Dutch museum collections and feed them to AI as a dataset to discover the archetypal form of different object groups.\n\nAs she carried out the various steps of her plan, contacting museums and starting an acting course to work on her presentation skills, she realized that she needed a venture closer to heart. 'I wanted to expand the project, extend its scope by involving institutions, but instead I expanded into thinking: why do I even care?' She realized that she is not so much interested in the objects as in the stories behind them, the mythology and iconology that gives objects their unique meaning. This realization marked the start of an investigation into icons, mythology, archetypes, fashion theory and philosophy.\n\nDuring this research, several pieces of the puzzle fell into place. Her new insights converge with her previous research on 'it' bags and coming-of-age stories, and Federmesser sees many similarities between these theories. 'I adopted the coming-of-age angle to examine these tropes. Many cultural theorists are talking about them, they just have different fields they want to influence. But then I realized I don't need to influence a field; I can just tell a story about interesting icons and tropes through a coming-of-age story to acknowledge what they mean and how they changed throughout time.'\n\nThe story will take the form of a self-published magazine, BagMag, in which essays and interviews are alternated with AI enhanced images. The first issue will be dedicated to the iconic as an enduring genre in media and everyday life. 'It is a teen magazine for reading adults who are curious about culture, fashion and ideas,' says Federmesser. 'What you might call a mixed bag.'\n\nText by Roosmarijn Hompe\n\nEstelle Barriol\n\n'I believe that we have to build differently in order to create future-proof, resilient and low-impact architecture,' says Estelle Barriol, founder of Studio ACTE, an architecture firm that specializes in designs based on reused materials. Sourcing those materials and subsequently using them for construction is something Barriol prefers to do personally. There are times when she feels more like a contractor than an architect.\n\nThe past year has given her a better grip on her positioning. 'The most interesting thing about applying for grants is that it forces you to think clearly and to figure out how you want to evolve and develop your practice.' One of her insights pertains to the scale of her work: that it needn't be very big. What is more important is that her design method of hands-on building is clear to see. She also realized that her practice, at heart, is shaped by a deep love for artisanal professions and regional or indigenous (vernacular) architecture.\n\nThis year gave Barriol the financial room she needed to participate in pitches that pay little or nothing: challenging competitions that do not always lead to a commission but are interesting in terms of substance and offer a good way to expand one's expertise. For example, she was able to elaborate her preparatory process with an additional step, engage in more on-site research into available materials, and create detailed models. She created a database of local materials, found among others at junk dealers and horticulturists, thereby further positioning Studio ACTE as an expert in the field.\n\nBarriol was also able to further professionalize her practice in terms of the recording and documenting of projects and submissions. This is an important factor in acquisitions, especially because the reused materials are often not recognizable as such. This aesthetic aspect is something that Barriol also finds important. 'What kind of language could reuse bring to architecture? And how can we use the urban mine stocks to build in a substantial spatial manner, with design quality?'\n\nBarriol has run her firm for three years, of which the past year was the most exciting: so many things came together. 'Because I could reshape all these thoughts about what reuse means and push it further, that created the chance to get selected and develop more meaningful projects.' The highlight of the year was the studio's selection for the French equivalent of the Prix de Rome, for which she is researching the antique recycling technique of spolia. Her contribution will be part of a group exhibition in Paris, along with the other selected participants.\n\nText by Victoria Anastasyadis\n\nFlorian Regtien\n\nFlorian Regtien is straight about it: 'I am addicted to the sewing machine, and I am content with that addiction.' Every piece of clothing he creates is unique and, in that sense, a work of art. Aside from that, he paints and creates mixed media sculptures and collages, often also with the use of his sewing machine. And he is an actor too. Clearly, Regtien has a strong drive to create: 'I just really enjoy making things. It's a kind of meditation, a thought process, something that gives me peace.'\n\nRegtien wanted to use his talent development year to 'taste' a variety of traditional crafts and in doing so develop himself into a true multidisciplinary artist. He apprenticed under a shoemaker, a furniture maker and a goldsmith; he made sneakers, an ottoman, pedestals; he upholstered, learned how to weld, and took a painting course. During a residency in Japan, he dedicated himself fully to denim fabric. 'I was already in love with denim, but now I feel that this love has grown into something eternal.'\n\nInitially Regtien was preoccupied with the techniques, striving to execute them as well as possible. But he gradually let go of that fixation and instead came to focus on the question: what do I want to make, and what do I want to say with my works? Expanding his toolbox of skills has multiplied the creative possibilities in his mind, allowing him to adopt a broader perspective. Now, the challenge is to channel all these ideas. In the past year he was assisted by a creative strategist, who helped him figure out and communicate his broad practice. Regtien will be presenting a selection of his various recent creations in a solo exhibition at Vrij Paleis in Amsterdam.\n\nThe many workshops and courses that Regtien took gave him new skills, but even more valuable is a new important insight: 'This year, the main lesson has been that you need to enjoy the process, instead of being obsessed with the end product.' This is symbolised in the artwork that he composed out of the lists he makes every morning, when he writes down everything he wants to get done that day, followed by a daily motto. The most important motto of the year sits at the piece's centre: Maybe I should seize the day. 'I really got to know myself better. I have more peace and more love for myself now.'\n\nText by Victoria Anastasyadis\n\nFlorian van Zandwijk\n\nFlorian van Zandwijk obtained his bachelor's degree in Design Art Technology (DAT) at ArtEZ in Arnhem in 2019. He works in the field of digital culture, both as an autonomous maker and on commission. The latter includes assignments as event organizer, curator, designer, producer and educator. Van Zandwijk describes his work as 'an unrelenting search for order in the chaos and complexity that surrounds us and an attempt to make some kind of sense of it.' He explains: 'We humans are constantly taking action to keep the systems, protocols and technologies running that we ourselves created. That incessant need, alongside humanity's inability to truly grasp and control, is central to my work.'\n\nVan Zandwijk's focus is currently on De Arena, in which he investigates the football stadium as a metaphor for society. This project is a continuation of his ArtEZ graduation project, The Ball The Field The Arena, in which he interviewed workers and journalists from the worlds of data collection, stadium security, technological tools and the recording for TV of football. The book Homo Ludens by philosopher Johan Huizinga served as a basis for the project.\n\nDe Arena has already resulted in Spectacle of Sports, a performative lecture at W139 about the personal, political, cultural, social and technological aspects of the football World Cup. The performance was live-streamed on a large screen. This year also saw the emergence of a new video work, which Van Zandwijk created in the stadium of football club Sparta Rotterdam. It centres around a performative action that relates to technology: 'Before every match in the Eredivisie football league, someone has to bounce a football in the goal on both ends of the pitch to calibrate the television cameras, to ensure that all cameras register the bounce at the exact same moment. This prevents errors during the match itself, for example in the registration of offside. My video work centres on the absurdity of such obligatory protocols.'\n\nVan Zandwijk is currently being mentored by curator Sanneke Huisman. 'My approach has gradually grown more direct. I am trying to develop fewer 'round' concepts and instead respond more to fleeting observations and inspirations, such as an online video or something that I encounter on the street and record. This has grown into a collection of works that I will present both online and in a physical setting in the coming months, for example via open calls and by organising a studio visit.' Concluding: 'Getting out there with my work is good for me. It takes me out of my comfort zone.'\n\nText by Iris Stam\n\nGijs Schalkx\n\nAt his graduation, designer Gijs Schalkx drew attention with his home-built moped, powered by methane gas that he personally 'harvested' from ditches. Why? Because what drives him is a desire to minimise his dependency on the infrastructure that shapes our lives and to demonstrate that we can do more than just consume. 'And because I am very interested in energy, mobility and vehicles, I thought to myself: you know what, I'm going to investigate how much driving a car actually costs.'\n\nThe intention to build a car with his own hands had been with him for a while, but the main question was: what should it be powered by? 'My first thought was electricity, but that would never satisfy my requirements and be low-tech at the same time. I would have had to build enormous batteries, so big that the car would be too heavy to move under its own power.'\n\nAfter some further research, the designer came up with another answer: oil. Or rather, plastic. 'We all throw away so much of it, and plastic is made from oil. I wondered whether I could reverse the chemical process and convert plastic back into its original form, and then use that oil to power my car. It seemed like a very interesting idea.'\n\nSchalkx found almost everything he needed to build his car at the scrapyard. 'Unfortunately, the car I chose turned out to be the most rotten one of the lot, so I had to cut out the entire floor in order to fix everything underneath it, including the brakes. I ground away all the rust and spent an enormous amount of time welding. Right after the official inspection, the engine broke, although I was able to replace it with another second-hand one. Now, the vehicle is road-ready.'\n\n'For the Dutch Design Week, I want to have succeeded in getting the car to run on oil. But even that process has consequences that may not be entirely responsible. What I do is boil plastic on the car's roof until it evaporates, and cooling down those vapours gives me oil to fuel the car. One kilo of plastic yields a bit less than a litre of oil. So although my plan to make a car that I can fuel independently was a success, I am not completely self-sufficient as regards energy. I need plastic for each trip, and because of that I may end up having to start consuming more again. So how independent can you really be, nowadays? Everything has consequences.'\n\nText by Maaike Staffhorst\n\nHattie Wade\n\nShe was always one to ask critical questions, wanting to understand the frameworks that preserve a status quo in Europe. Hattie Wade questions what we accept as the truth with respect to our national heritage. Stories about the 'official' heritage can create a sense of national identity based on pride, which can lead to what Wade describes as 'toxic nationalism'. As an example: white nationalists in Great Britain – Wade's place of birth – protected the statues of slave traders during the Black Lives protests. And in the Netherlands, the Forum voor Democratie national party proposed a 'Dutch Values Protection Act', in response to the escalating debates about the figure of Black Pete (Zwarte Piet). 'This is rarely opposed by “contra-heritage”, that is to say, by understanding how the violence inherent to colonialism and imperialism is maintained through the contemporary frameworks of law, education and media,' she says.\n\nWade is working on three projects to expose this and to offer 'anti-venom', through extensive online, archival and field research. For example, she has interviewed Sadia Habib, a lecturer, researcher and project coordinator of Our Shared Cultural Heritage in Manchester Museum. Habib works with young diaspora communities to explore the question how heritage institutions can contribute to creating safe spaces where they can access heritage. Wade also interviews teachers and children in the Netherlands and Great Britain about the way colonial history is presented. She is working with the archaeology department of the municipality of The Hague to understand how historical stories are formed in response to archaeological finds. Her work will result in an experimental documentary. 'Wherever possible, I like to use audiovisual media to let the voices of others be heard.'\n\nHer two other research projects focus on legislation. Wade is working with ARIJ, which is a network of Arabic research journalists in the Middle East and North Africa. The project concentrates on a colonial law from 1917 in Morocco, which protects forests on the one hand but that stimulates creating wildfires on the other, in order to facilitate the occupation of land. 'As a designer, I am able to represent their research in a spatial, sculptural exhibition, due to go on display in Jordan in December. I enjoy making complex and concealed information tangible, visible and comprehensible for the general public,' Wade says. 'I cannot cause systems to collapse but can make them wobble. And I hope that, a few generations after us, the narrative will have shifted to a more polyphonic, honest historical narrative and fairer laws.'\n\nText by Viveka van de Vliet\n\nIgrien Yin Liu\n\nCreative director and image creator Igrien Yin Liu (刘寅) had a clear idea in her mind when she formulated her plans for her talent development year.
