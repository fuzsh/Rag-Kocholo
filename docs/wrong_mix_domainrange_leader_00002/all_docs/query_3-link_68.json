Viviana Bohórquez and Deissy Martinez Baron April 29/2020 Action Plan for Colombia Scaling the use of research outputs to support the low emissions development (LED) strategies in agriculture\n\n2. Actor’s engagement MADS -Incorporation of the research outputs on the PIGCCS agriculture. NDC updating process and the gaps of development IDEAM -Use of research’s outputs of nitrogen fertilizers activity data in the National GHG inventory - Next steps and researches needed to fully impact the AFOLU categories. Training - Progress of the associations in measure and implementation of efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers - Needs and next steps of implementation of efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers FEDECACAO - Scope of the study and Fedecacao targets - Recalculation of potentials to include in NDC update FEDECADETEROS - Progress on mitigation of GHG of coffee sector - Needs and next steps of implementation of efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers FEDEARROZ - Progress on mitigation of GHG of rice sector - Needs and next steps of implementation of efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers\n\n3. Results Improvement of activity data of nitrogen organic fertilizers on agricultural systems Assessing in situ the emission factor of the use of crop residues and biological inhibition of nitrification Generate an accord to assure the report of information in category 3C3, 3C4 and 3C5 Identify the information and the forms to report information to ICA Exploring institutional arrangements with fertilizer sales companies Develop a MRV pilot for reductions of the renovation/ rehabilitation of cocoa plantations in prioritized regions/sites Restructuring Coffee NAMA Developing a base line of cocoa new areas for zero deforestation accords Building capacity in low carbon production of sugar cane, cocoa and other crops\n\n4. EC-LEDS studies impact on Colombian climate policies The NDC updating process consist in assessing the mitigation actions of the PIGCCS\n\n5. Interactions of 2020 action plan\n\n6. 2020 action plan • Outcome 1. Improvement the GHG inventories in Colombia - 2. Contribution to NDC implementation 3. Implementation of national and subnational LED strategy (PIGCCS Ag) • Next users: Ministries, IDEAM, producers associations • Output • Who develops the output • Activities • Focus areas (Improvements, Capacity building, Integration to LEDs policies) • Timeline (12 months) • Estimate cost USD (240.697 USD)"
