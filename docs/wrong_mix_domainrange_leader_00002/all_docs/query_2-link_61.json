        "text": "Ketamine reduces the need for intubation in patients with acute severe mental illness and agitation requiring transport to definitive care: An observational study.\n\nPubMed\n\nParsch, Cathrin S; Boonstra, Adrianne; Teubner, David; Emmerton, Wade; McKenny, Brian; Ellis, Daniel Y\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to review mental health patients transported by a dedicated statewide critical care retrieval team before and after the implementation of a ketamine sedation guideline. This is a a retrospective cohort study of mental health patients with acute behavioural disturbance, transported between January 2010 and December 2015. A total of 78 patients were transported in the study period, 50 before and 28 after implementation of the ketamine guideline in June 2013. The introduction of the ketamine guideline was associated with a significant reduction in intubation for transport (36.00 vs 7.14%) (odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.02-0.71, P < 0.01). The likelihood of utilising ketamine for non-intubated patients (n = 58) was higher in the period after implementation (37.50 vs 84.62%, odds ratio 9.17, 95% confidence interval 2.54-33.08, P < 0.005). The incidence of complications in our series was low. The implementation of a ketamine clinical practice guideline for agitated mental health patients was associated with an increase in the number of patients receiving ketamine as part of their sedation regime and a reduction in the number of patients requiring intubation for transport. Appropriately trained critical care retrieval teams should consider ketamine as part of the sedation regime for agitated mental health patients.

We hypothesized 5âmg/kg of intramuscular ketamine would be superior to 10âmg of intramuscular haloperidol for severe prehospital agitation, with time to adequate sedation as the primary outcome measure. This was a prospective open label study of all patients in an urban EMS system requiring chemical sedation for severe acute undifferentiated agitation that were subsequently transported to the EMS system's primary Emergency Department. All paramedics were trained in the Altered Mental Status Scale and prospectively recorded agitation scores on all patients. Two 6-month periods where either ketamine or haloperidol was the first-line therapy for severe agitation were prospectively compared primarily for time to adequate sedation. Secondary outcomes included laboratory data and adverse medication events. 146 subjects were enrolled; 64 received ketamine, 82 received haloperidol. Median time to adequate sedation for the ketamine group was 5âminutes (range 0.4-23) vs. 17âminutes (range 2-84) in the haloperidol group (difference 12âminutes, 95% CI 9-15). Complications occurred in 49% (27/55) of patients receiving ketamine vs. 5% (4/82) in the haloperidol group. Complications specific to the ketamine group included hypersalivation (21/56, 38%), emergence reaction (5/52, 10%), vomiting (5/57, 9%), and laryngospasm (3/55, 5%). Intubation was also significantly higher in the ketamine group; 39% of patients receiving ketamine were intubated vs. 4% of patients receiving haloperidol. Ketamine is superior to haloperidol in terms of time to adequate sedation for severe prehospital acute undifferentiated agitation, but is associated with more complications and a higher intubation rate.\n\nIncidence, Risk Factors and Consequences of Emergence Agitation in Adult Patients after Elective Craniotomy for Brain Tumor: A Prospective Cohort Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Lu; Xu, Ming; Li, Gui-Yun; Cai, Wei-Xin; Zhou, Jian-Xin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEmergence agitation is a frequent complication that can have serious consequences during recovery from general anesthesia. However, agitation has been poorly investigated in patients after craniotomy. In this prospective cohort study, adult patients were enrolled after elective craniotomy for brain tumor. The sedation-agitation scale was evaluated during the first 12 hours after surgery. Agitation developed in 35 of 123 patients (29%). Of the agitated patients, 28 (80%) were graded as very and dangerously agitated. By multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, independent predictors for agitation included male sex, history of long-term use of anti-depressant drugs or benzodiazepines, frontal approach of the operation, method and duration of anesthesia and presence of endotracheal intubation. Total intravenous anesthesia and balanced anesthesia with short duration were protective factors. Emergence agitation was associated with self-extubation (8.6% vs 0%, Pâ=â0.005). Sedatives were administered more in agitated patients than non-agitated patients (85.7% vs 6.8%, P<0.001). In conclusion, emergence agitation was a frequent complication in patients after elective craniotomy for brain tumors. The clarification of risk factors could help to identify the high-risk patients, and then to facilitate the prevention and treatment of agitation. For patients undergoing craniotomy, greater attention should be paid to those receiving a frontal approach for craniotomy and those anesthetized under balanced anesthesia with long duration. More researches are warranted to elucidate whether total intravenous anesthesia could reduce the incidence of agitation after craniotomy. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00590499.

Totally 120 peadiatric patients (aged 4-10 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I for inhalational induction) were randomly allocated into group I (remifentanil 1 microg/kg), group II (remifentanil 2 microg/kg), group III (remifentanil 3 microg/kg), and control group (vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg). After inhalational induction with 3% sevoflurane and 60% nitrous oxide in 40% oxygen for 2 minutes, remifentanil 1 microg/kg, 2 microg/ kg, and 3 microg/kg were intravenously injected over 1 minute into patients in group I , group II, and group III, respectively. After remifentanil administration and manual ventilation for 1 minute, the trachea was intubated. In the control group, 2 minutes after intravenous administration of vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg, tracheal intubation was attempted. Agitation, intubating satisfactoriness, and the circulation changes after tracheal intubation and anesthesia induction were observed. In these four groups, agitation occurred in 37.5% of patients during sevoflurane induction. Satisfactory intubation rate was 70.0% in group I, 86.7% in group II, 90.0% in group III, and 93.3% in the control group. Compared with the control group, the impact of tracheal intubation on the circulatory system was smaller in group I , II , and III. Induction with 3% sevoflurane combined with remifentanil can be smoothly performed, followed by the successful tracheal intubation. The intubating conditions are more satisfactory with 3% sevoflurane combined with remifentanil 2 microg/kg or 3 microg/kg.\n\nRisk factors for agitation in critically ill patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde Almeida, Thiago Miranda Lopes; de Azevedo, Luciano Cesar Pontes; NosÃ©, Paulo MaurÃ­cio Garcia; de Freitas, Flavio Geraldo Resende; Machado, FlÃ¡via Ribeiro\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate the incidence of agitation in the first 7 days after intensive care unit admission, its risk factors and its associations with clinical outcomes. Methods This single-center prospective cohort study included all patients older than 18 years with a predicted stay > 48 hours within the first 24 hours of intensive care unit admission. Agitation was defined as a Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale score â¥ +2, an episode of agitation or the use of a specific medication recorded in patient charts. Results Agitation occurred in 31.8% of the 113 patients. Multivariate analysis showed that delirium [OR = 24.14; CI95% 5.15 - 113.14; p < 0.001], moderate or severe pain [OR = 5.74; CI95% 1.73 - 19.10; p = 0.004], mechanical ventilation [OR = 10.14; CI95% 2.93 - 35.10; p < 0.001], and smoking habits [OR = 4.49; CI95% 1.33 - 15.17; p = 0.015] were independent factors for agitation, while hyperlactatemia was associated with a lower risk [OR = 0.169; CI95% 0.04 - 0.77; p = 0.021]. Agitated patients had fewer mechanical ventilation-free days at day 7 (p = 0.003). Conclusion The incidence of agitation in the first 7 days after admission to the intensive care unit was high. Delirium, moderate/severe pain, mechanical ventilation, and smoking habits were independent risk factors. Agitated patients had fewer ventilator-free days in the first 7 days.

In an attempt to avoid this complication, the authors used flexible fiberoptic nasal intubation in a series of 327 patients with cervical lesions undergoing elective neurosurgical procedures. The nasal route was preferred for laryngeal intubation because it is easier than the oral route and a restraining collar or halo device does not impair the intubating maneuver. Bronchoscopic intubation was possible in all patients. In 12 patients (3.6%), anatomic abnormalities prevented transnasal insertion of the endotracheal tube, and transoral fiberoptic intubation was necessary. Endotracheal intubation was graded as slightly difficult in 85 patients (26%). The minimal peripheral oxygen saturation during intubation exceeded 90% in 289 patients (88%). In the other 38 patients, the mean O2 saturation was 84.2+/-4.3% (range, 72-89%). Intubation was well tolerated by all patients and none had recall of the procedure. Cervical stabilizers did not have to be removed for intubation in any patient. None of the patients had postoperative neurologic deficits attributable to the intubation procedure. The authors consider fiberoptic transnasal intubation to be a useful alternative to direct laryngoscopic tracheal intubation in patients undergoing elective surgical procedures on the cervical spine to avoid potential injury to the cervical spinal cord.\n\nDiscovery of unexpected pain in intubated and sedated patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nClukey, Lory; Weyant, Ruth A; Roberts, Melanie; Henderson, Ann\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe perceptions of patients who are restrained and sedated while being treated with mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit are not well understood. The effectiveness of sedation used to aid in recovery and enhance comfort during intubation is unknown. To explore the perceptions of patients who were intubated and receiving pain medication while sedated and restrained in the intensive care unit, in particular, their experience and their memories of the experience. In a phenomenological study, 14 patients who were intubated and receiving pain medication while sedated and restrained were interviewed at the bedside. A semistructured interview guide was used. Data were analyzed by using an inductive method consistent with qualitative research. Three major themes were identified from the data: lack of memory of being restrained; a perception of being intubated as horrific; nursing behaviors that were helpful and comforting. An unexpected discovery was that sedation may be interfering with pain assessment and management. Being intubated can be painful and traumatic despite administration of sedatives and analgesics. Sedation may mask uncontrolled pain for intubated patients and prevent them from communicating this condition to a nurse. Nurses may need to evaluate current interventions in order to provide maximum comfort and promote optimal positive outcomes for intensive care patients who are intubated.\n\nHypokalemia and agitation in acute psychotic patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nHatta, K; Takahashi, T; Nakamura, H; Yamashiro, H; Asukai, N; Yonezawa, Y\n\n1999-04-19\n\nHypokalemia is caused partly by intensive exercise. Some evidence suggests that psychological distress may cause hypokalemia. The relationship between the decline of serum potassium concentration and the level of symptoms of acute agitation, which was defined as a total score on a subset of six categories on the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (anxiety, tension, mannerism and posturing, hostility, uncooperativeness, psychomotor excitement), was examined in 313 schizophrenic men, admitted on an emergency basis during a 24-month period. In addition, change in serum potassium concentration after sedation was investigated. Serum potassium concentration in the severely agitated group was lower than that in the mild group. There was a significant correlation between serum potassium concentration and the level of symptoms of acute agitation (r = -0.30, P < 0.0001). Although the decline of serum potassium concentration in the patients who were sufficiently sedated improved within 8 h, that in the patients showing high scores on the acute agitation subset even 8 h after emergency admission was prolonged. Results indicate that sedation improves acute agitation-induced hypokalemia. rights\n\nIntubation of the morbidly obese patient: GlideScope(Â®) vs. Fastrachâ¢.\n\nPubMed\n\nYdemann, M; Rovsing, L; Lindekaer, A L; Olsen, K S\n\n2012-07-01\n\nSeveral potential problems can arise from airway management in morbidly obese patients, including difficult mask ventilation and difficult intubation. We hypothesised that endotracheal intubation of morbidly obese patients would be more rapid using the GlideScope(Â®) (GS) (Verathon Inc Corporate Headquarters, Bothell, WA, USA) than with the Fastrachâ¢ (FT) (The Laryngeal Mask Company Ltd, Le Rocher, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles). One hundred patients who were scheduled for bariatric surgery were randomised to tracheal intubation using either a GS or an FT. The inclusion criteria were age 18-60 years and a body mass index of â¥â35âkg/m(2) . The primary end point was intubation time, and if intubation was not achieved after two attempts, the other method was used for the third attempt. The mean intubation time was 49âs using the GS and 61âs using the FT (Pâ=â0.86). A total of 92% and 84% of the patients were intubated on the first attempt using the GS and the FT, respectively. One tracheal intubation failed on the second attempt when the GS was used, and five failed on the second attempt when the FT was used. There were no incidents of desaturation and no differences between the groups in terms of mucosal damage or intubation difficulty. We experienced one oesophageal intubation using GS and six oesophageal intubations in five patients using FT. There was no difference between the pain scores or incidence of post-operative hoarseness associated with the two intubation techniques. No significant difference between the two methods was found. The GS and the FT may therefore be considered to be equally good when intubating morbidly obese patients. Â© 2012 The Authors.

Concurrent use of a laryngoscope may facilitate lightwand intubation, allowing midline placement and free movement of the lightwand in the oral cavity without jaw thrust. We compared the effects of laryngoscope-assisted lightwand intubation (LALI) versus conventional lightwand intubation (CLI) on cervical spine motion during intubation in patients with simulated cervical immobilization. In this randomized crossover study, the cervical spine angle was measured before and during intubation at the occiput-C1, C1-C2, and C2-C5 segments in 20 patients with simulated cervical immobilization who underwent intubation using both the LALI and CLI techniques. Cervical spine motion was defined as the change from baseline in angle measured at each cervical segment during intubation. Cervical spine motion at the occiput-C1 segment was 5.6Â° (4.3) and 9.3Â° (4.5) when we used the LALI and CLI techniques, respectively (mean difference [98.33% CI]; -3.8Â° [-7.2 to -0.3]; P = .007). At other cervical segments, it was not significantly different between the 2 techniques (-0.1Â° [-2.6 to 2.5]; P = .911 in the C1-C2 segment and -0.2Â° [-2.8 to 2.5]; P = .795 in the C2-C5 segment). The LALI technique produces less upper cervical spine motion during intubation than the CLI technique in patients with simulated cervical immobilization.\n\nKetamine as a first-line treatment for severely agitated emergency department patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nRiddell, Jeff; Tran, Alexander; Bengiamin, Rimon; Hendey, Gregory W; Armenian, Patil\n\n2017-07-01\n\nEmergency physicians often need to control agitated patients who present a danger to themselves and hospital personnel. Commonly used medications have limitations. Our primary objective was to compare the time to a defined reduction in agitation scores for ketamine versus benzodiazepines and haloperidol, alone or in combination. Our secondary objectives were to compare rates of medication redosing, vital sign changes, and adverse events in the different treatment groups. We conducted a single-center, prospective, observational study examining agitation levels in acutely agitated emergency department patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who required sedation medication for acute agitation. Providers measured agitation levels on a previously validated 6-point sedation scale at 0-, 5-, 10-, and 15-min after receiving sedation. We also assessed the incidence of adverse events, repeat or rescue medication dosing, and changes in vital signs. 106 patients were enrolled and 98 met eligibility criteria. There was no significant difference between groups in initial agitation scores. Based on agitation scores, more patients in the ketamine group were no longer agitated than the other medication groups at 5-, 10-, and 15-min after receiving medication. Patients receiving ketamine had similar rates of redosing, changes in vital signs, and adverse events to the other groups. In highly agitated and violent emergency department patients, significantly fewer patients receiving ketamine as a first line sedating agent were agitated at 5-, 10-, and 15-min. Ketamine appears to be faster at controlling agitation than standard emergency department medications. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Patients with either untreated acromegaly or non-functional pituitary adenomas were enrolled. Patients with acromegaly underwent hormone assays, upper airway computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examinations and preoperative overnight polysomnography. The modified Mallampati classification, mouth opening, neck circumference, and neck extension were assessed, and the Cormack-Lehane grades and the time of tracheal intubation were recorded. Patients with acromegaly had a higher incidence of difficult intubation (62.5%). The time of tracheal intubation was prolonged, the neck circumference was enlarged, and the neck extension was confined. In patients with acromegaly and difficult intubation, the insulin-like growth factor 1 levels and apnea/hypoxia index were significantly higher compared to patients without difficult intubation (1115.40âÂ±â253.73 vs. 791.67âÂ±â206.62 ng/ml, Pâ=â0.020; 22.17âÂ±â23.25 vs. 2.47âÂ±â2.84, Pâ=â0.026, respectively). The bilateral regression analysis revealed that high levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 were an independent risk factor for developing difficult intubation (pâ=â0.042, Exp Bâ=â1.006). The modified Mallampati classification was positively correlated with apnea/hypoxia index and could be calculated using the following logarithmic equation: MMCâ=â0.2982 * ln (AHI)â+â2.1836. In patients with acromegaly, neck movement is confined, the time of tracheal intubation is prolonged, and the neck circumference is enlarged, and these patients suffer from an increased incidence of difficult intubation (62.5%) during anesthesia induction. The apnea/hypoxia index and insulin-like growth factor 1 levels are both increased in acromegalic patients with difficult intubation, and elevated insulin-like growth factor 1 levels are an independent risk factor of difficult\n\nPatients with difficult intubation may need referral to sleep clinics.\n\nPubMed\n\nChung, Frances; Yegneswaran, Balaji; Herrera, Francisco; Shenderey, Alex; Shapiro, Colin M\n\n2008-09-01\n\nUpper airway abnormalities carry the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and difficult tracheal intubations. Both conditions contribute to significant clinical problems and have increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that patients who presented with difficult intubation would have a very high prevalence of OSA and that those with unexpected difficult intubation may require referral to sleep clinics for polysomnography (PSG). Patients classified as a grade 4 Cormack and Lehane on direct laryngoscopic view, and who required more than two attempts for successful endotracheal intubation, were referred to the study by consultant anesthesiologists at four hospitals. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) data and postoperative events were collected. Patients with AHI >5/h were considered positive for OSA. Clinical and PSG variables were compared using t-tests and chi(2) test. Over a 20-mo period, 84 patients with a difficult intubation were referred into the study. Thirty-three patients agreed to participate. Sixty-six percent (22 of 33) had OSA (AHI >5/h). Of the 22 OSA patients, 10 patients (64%) had mild OSA (AHI 5-15), 6 (18%) had moderate OSA (AHI >15/h), and 6 (18%) had severe OSA (AHI >30/h). Of the 33 patients, 11 patients (33%) were recommended for continuous positive airway pressure treatment. Between the OSA group and the non-OSA group, there were significant differences in gender, neck size, and the quality of sleep, but there were no significant differences in age and body mass index. Sixty-six percent of patients with unexpected difficult intubation who consented to undergo a sleep study were diagnosed with OSA by PSG. Patients with difficult intubation are at high risk for OSA and should be screened for signs and symptoms of sleep apnea. Screening for OSA should be considered by referral to a sleep clinic for PSG.\n\nNurse education regarding agitated patients and its effects on clinical practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nOzdemir, Leyla; Karabulut, Erdem\n\nThis study identified the impact of an education program on nurses' practices for agitated patients and documented the changes in practice after completion of the training. Eighteen cardiac intensive care nurses were included to the study. Prior to nurses' participation in an education program, a pre-test indicating nurses' current practices for 40 agitated patients was evaluated with the 'Nurse Practice Form'. After the pre-test data collection period was completed, the 2-day training program on caring for agitated patients was conducted. The last step of the study was evaluation of post-test nurses' practices for 40 agitated patients using the 'Nurse Practice Form'. The findings indicated that instead of pre-test nurses' use of physical restraints for controlling agitated patients without a physician order, none of post-test nurses applied them. The training program provided nurses the knowledge and skills needed to evaluate and to manage the causes of agitation.\n\nCharacterizing the experience of agitation in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoberts, Jenna; Gracia Canales, Alfredo; Blanthorn-Hazell, Sophee; Craciun Boldeanu, Anca; Judge, Davneet\n\n2018-04-16\n\nAgitation is a common manifestation of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia which includes symptoms ranging from inner tension and unease to violence and aggression. Much of the existing literature has focused on agitation in the acute setting, with the patient experience poorly defined. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize agitation and its management from a patient perspective, with the focus on those who reside in the community. Surveys were completed across Germany, Spain and the UK by 583 community dwelling patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who experienced episodes of agitation. Patients were recruited via either their physician or through patient support groups. The survey captured information on demographics, disease characteristics, frequency of agitation episodes and different pre-defined severity levels ranging from mild to severe, symptoms experienced during an episode, awareness of agitation and coping strategies employed by the patient. Statistics were descriptive in nature. The most commonly reported symptoms during an episode of agitation were feeling uneasy (nâ=â373, 64%), restless (nâ=â368, 63%) or nervous (nâ=â368, 63%). Patients experienced an average of 22.4 (SD 57.2) mild, 15.4 (SD 61.2) moderate, 6.8 (SD 63.3) moderate-intense and 2.9 (SD 24.4) severe episodes within the last 12Â months; on average 2.7 (SD 6.8) required hospital attendance. Half of patients (nâ=â313) had attended hospital due to agitation. In total, 71% of patients (nâ=â412) were aware they were becoming agitated either always or sometimes and 61% of patients (nâ=â347) were aware of agitation triggers either always or sometimes. The majority of patients reported being able to sometimes control their agitation (56%, nâ=â329) but 16% (nâ=â94) stated that there is typically nothing they can do. To cope with episodes 55% (nâ=â125) of schizophrenia patients and 66% (nâ=â234) of bipolar disorder patients reported taking\n\nPre-Hospital Intubation Factors and Pneumonia in Trauma Patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWarner, Keir; Bulger, Eileen M.; Sharar, Sam R.; Maier, Ronald V.; Cuschieri, Joseph\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAbstract Background We reported similar rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) previously in trauma patients intubated either in a pre-hospital (PH) venue or the emergency department. A subset of PH intubations with continuous quality assessment was re-examined to identify the intubation factors associated with VAP. Methods The subgroup was derived from an existing data set of consecutive adult trauma patients intubated prior to Level I trauma center admission July 2007âJuly 2008. Intubation details recorded included bag-valve mask ventilation (BVM) and the presence of material in the airway. The diagnosis of VAP was made preferentially by quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures (â¥104 colony-forming units indicating infection). Baseline data, injury characteristics, and circumstances of intubation of patients with and without VAP were compared by univariable analysis. Results Detailed data were available for 197 patients; 32 (16.2%) developed VAP, on average 6.0Â±0.7 days after admission. Baseline characteristics were similar in the groups, but diabetes mellitus was more common in the VAP group (4 [12.5%] vs. 5 [3.0%]; p=0.02). There was a higher rate of blunt injury in the VAP patients (28 [87.5%] vs. 106 [64.2%]; p=0.01) and higher injury severity scores (33.1Â±2.8 vs. 23.0Â±1.0; p=0.0002) and chest Abbreviated Injury Scores (2.6Â±0.3 vs. 1.5Â±0.1; p=0.002). Lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores (7.9Â±0.9 vs. 9.9Â±0.4; p=0.04) and greater use of BVM (18 [56.3%] vs. 56 [34.0%]; p=0.02) were observed in patients who developed VAP. Among aspirations, 10 (31.3%) of patients with emesis developed VAP compared with only 4 (12.5%) with blood in the airway (p=0.003). Conclusion Aspiration, along with depressed consciousness and greater injury severity, may predispose trauma patients to VAP.

A subset of PH intubations with continuous quality assessment was re-examined to identify the intubation factors associated with VAP. The subgroup was derived from an existing data set of consecutive adult trauma patients intubated prior to Level I trauma center admission July 2007-July 2008. Intubation details recorded included bag-valve mask ventilation (BVM) and the presence of material in the airway. The diagnosis of VAP was made preferentially by quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures (â¥ 10â´ colony-forming units indicating infection). Baseline data, injury characteristics, and circumstances of intubation of patients with and without VAP were compared by univariable analysis. Detailed data were available for 197 patients; 32 (16.2%) developed VAP, on average 6.0Â±0.7 days after admission. Baseline characteristics were similar in the groups, but diabetes mellitus was more common in the VAP group (4 [12.5%] vs. 5 [3.0%]; p=0.02). There was a higher rate of blunt injury in the VAP patients (28 [87.5%] vs. 106 [64.2%]; p=0.01) and higher injury severity scores (33.1Â±2.8 vs. 23.0Â±1.0; p=0.0002) and chest Abbreviated Injury Scores (2.6Â±0.3 vs. 1.5Â±0.1; p=0.002). Lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores (7.9Â±0.9 vs. 9.9Â±0.4; p=0.04) and greater use of BVM (18 [56.3%] vs. 56 [34.0%]; p=0.02) were observed in patients who developed VAP. Among aspirations, 10 (31.3%) of patients with emesis developed VAP compared with only 4 (12.5%) with blood in the airway (p=0.003). Aspiration, along with depressed consciousness and greater injury severity, may predispose trauma patients to VAP. Prospective studies should focus on the quality and timing of aspiration relative to intubation to determine if novel interventions can prevent aspiration or decrease the risk of VAP after aspiration.\n\nThe Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway Facilitates Tracheal Intubation in the Lateral Position\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKomatsu, Ryu; Nagata, Osamu; Sessler, Daniel I.; Ozaki, Makoto\n\n2005-01-01\n\nAlthough the difficulty of tracheal intubation in the lateral position has not been systematically evaluated, airway loss during surgery in a laterally positioned patient may have hazardous consequences. We explored whether the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) facilitates tracheal intubation in patients with normal airway anatomy, i.e., Mallampati grade â¤ 3 and thyromental distance â¥ 5 cm, positioned in the lateral position. And we evaluated whether this technique can be used as a rescue when the airway is lost mid-case in laterally positioned patients with respect to success rate and intubation time. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium in 50 patients undergoing spine surgery for lumbar disk herniation (Lateral) and 50 undergoing other surgical procedures (Supine). Patients having disk surgery (Lateral) were positioned on their right or left sides before induction of general anesthesia, and intubation was performed in that position. Patients in control group (Supine) were anesthetized in supine position, and intubation was performed in that position. Intubation was performed blindly via an ILMA in both groups. The time required for intubation and number and types of adjusting maneuvers employed were recorded. Data were compared by Mann-Whitney U, Fisherâs exact, chi-square, or unpaired t-tests, as appropriate. Data presented as mean (SD). Demographic and airway measures were similar in the two groups, except for mouth opening which was slightly wider in patients in the lateral position: 5.1 (0.9) vs. 4.6 (0.7) cm. The time required for intubation was similar in each group (â25 s), as was intubation success (96%). We conclude that blind intubation via an ILMA offers a frequent success rate and a clinically acceptable intubation time (< one min) even in the lateral position. Summary Blind intubation via the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) offers a high success rate and a clinically acceptable intubation time even in\n\nA comparison of blind nasotracheal and succinylcholine-assisted intubation in the poisoned patient.\n\nPubMed\n\nDronen, S C; Merigian, K S; Hedges, J R; Hoekstra, J W; Borron, S W\n\n1987-06-01\n\nIn the patient obtunded by drug intoxication, the optimal method of airway protection prior to gastric emptying is not clear. We report a prospective randomized trial of two methods of intubation in this patient population. Fifty-two overdose patients with Glascow Coma Scale scores of 12 or less were intubated either orotracheally after succinylcholine administration or nasotracheally. Success rate, time to intubate, difficulty, and complications of intubation were compared for the two groups. We found a success rate of 100% (23 of 23) for succinylcholine assisted intubation (SAI) versus 65% (19 of 29) success with blind nasotracheal intubation (BNI). Mean time to intubate was 64 seconds and 276 seconds in the SAI and BNI groups, respectively. Eighty-six percent (19 of 22) of patients were intubated successfully in less than 120 seconds in the SAI group versus 37% (10 of 27) in the BNI group (P less than .005). In the SAI group, the mean number of attempts was 1.3 per patient, (range, one to three) with 96% (22 of 23) having two or fewer attempts. No complications were identified. In the BNI group, the mean number of attempts was 3.7 per patient, (range, one to 13) with 45% (13 of 29) having two or fewer attempts (P less than .005). Sixty-nine percent of the BNI group experienced epistaxis, 17% had vomiting, and 10% aspirated. We conclude that SAI is a safe and effective method of airway protection in the obtunded poisoned patient. Complications and difficulty in intubation were significantly less with SAI than with blind nasotracheal intubation.\n\nIntubated Trauma Patients Do Not Require Full Trauma Team Activation when Effectively Triaged.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarbrecht, Brian G; Franklin, Glen A; Smith, Jason W; Benns, Matthew V; Miller, Keith R; Nash, Nicholas A; Bozeman, Matthew C; Coleman, Royce; O'Brien, Dan; Richardson, J David\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull trauma team activation in evaluating injured patients is based on triage criteria and associated with significant costs and resources that should be focused on patients who truly need them. Overtriage leads to inefficient care, particularly when resources are finite, and it diverts care from other vital areas. Although shock and gunshot wounds to the abdomen are accepted indicators for full trauma activation, intubation as the sole criterion is controversial. We evaluated our experience to assess if intubation alone merited the highest level of trauma activation. All trauma patients from 2012 to 2013 were assessed for level of activation, injury characteristics, presence of intubation, and outcomes. Of 5,881 patients, 646 (11%) were level 1 (full) and 2,823 (48%) were level 2 (partial) activations. Level 1 patients were younger (40 Â± 17 vs 45 Â± 20 years), had more penetrating injuries (42% vs 9%), and had higher mortality (26% vs 8%)(p < 0.001). Intubated level 2 patients (nÂ = 513), compared with intubated level 1 patients (nÂ = 320), had higher systolic blood pressure (133 Â± 44 vs 90 Â± 58 mmHg), lower Injury Severity Score (21 Â± 13 vs 25 Â± 16), more falls (25% vs 3%), fewer penetrating injuries (11% vs 23%), and lower mortality (31% vs 48%)(p < 0.01). Fewer intubated level patients went directly to the operating room from the emergency department (ED)(16% vs 33%), and most who did had a craniotomy (63% vs 13%). Only 3% of intubated level 2 patients underwent laparotomy compared with 20% of intubated level 1 patients (p < 0.001). The ED lengths of stay before obtaining a head CT (47 Â± 26 vs 48 Â± 31 minutes) and craniotomy (109 Â± 61 vs 102 Â± 46 minutes) were similar. Deaths in intubated level 2 patients were primarily from fatal brain injuries. When appropriately triaged, selected intubated trauma patients do not require full trauma activation to receive timely, efficient care. Copyright Â© 2016 American College of Surgeons.

This report describes a case series that examined the effectiveness and safety of low-dose divalproex in the treatment of agitated patients with Alzheimer's disease who were admitted to an inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit over a 1-year period. All patients had agitation due to probable Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia and were prescribed divalproex monotherapy at low and completely flexible doses. Patients and nursing staff were blind to study enrollment. Clinical global impression scale scores, divalproex serum levels, and a variety of medical chart data were collected. Twenty patients met selection criteria and were included in the study. Of those, 13 patients (65%) were considered responders, while 4 patients (20%) required augmentation with other psychotropic medications; divalproex was discontinued in 1 patient. Adverse events occurred in 25% of patients. This case series suggests that low-dose divalproex may offer behavioral improvement and a reduced risk of side effects for some patients with agitation in Alzheimer's disease.\n\nDiagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in intubated, intensive care unit patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalata, R A; Lederman, M M; Shlaes, D M; Jacobs, M R; Eckstein, E; Tweardy, D; Toossi, Z; Chmielewski, R; Marino, J; King, C H\n\n1987-02-01\n\nThe clinical distinction between bacterial colonization of the tracheobronchial tree and nosocomial pneumonia is difficult, especially in intubated patients. We studied 51 intubated, intensive care unit patients prospectively by serial examinations of tracheal aspirates for elastin fibers, graded Gram's stains, and quantitative bacterial cultures in conjunction with clinical and radiologic observations in an attempt to develop criteria for the early detection of pulmonary infection. Patients with infection had new or progressive pulmonary infiltrates plus 1 of the following: positive blood culture results, radiographic evidence of cavitation, or histologic evidence of pneumonia, or 2 or more of the following: new fever, new leukocytosis, or grossly purulent tracheal aspirates. Twenty-one patients developed infection, 22 remained colonized, and 8 had an uncertain status. Infiltrates developed in 34 patients (21 infected, 8 colonized, 5 uncertain status). Gram-negative bacilli were most commonly isolated and were more frequent in infected patients (81 versus 47%, p less than 0.05); Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were most often associated with infection. No differences were observed between infected and colonized patients in demographic features, smoking history, underlying disease, previous antibiotic therapy, days in hospital before intubation, preexisting pneumonia upon intubation, or highest temperature or leukocyte count during course. By univariate analysis, infected patients had a longer duration of intubation (p less than 0.05), higher Gram's stain grading for neutrophils (p less than 0.05) or bacteria (p less than 0.005), higher bacterial colony counts (p less than 0.05), and more frequent detection of elastin fibers in tracheal aspirates (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\n[Usefullness of bronchofiberscopy for difficult intubation in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities].\n\nPubMed\n\nMizuno, Yuji; Ukaji, Koutarou\n\n2005-11-01\n\nIn 21 patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities, bronchofiberoptic intubation was performed because of difficulty in tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy. The patients ranged from 3 to 35 years old (mean age: 20.2 years). Twenty patients (95.2%) were bedridden. Among the 21 patients, 15 had cerebral palsy and 20 had hypertonia. The reason for intubation were acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia in 17 cases, suffocation after aspiration of food in 2 cases, hypovolemic shock in 1 case, and laryngotracheomalacia in 1 case. Intubation was done pernasally in 15 patients and perorally in 10. It was successful in 20 cases without any significant complications. The Cormack score ranged from 3rd degree in 4 cases to 4th in 17 cases. The 20 cases of successful fiberoptic intubation were divided into 7 patients with and 13 without tracheostomy. The mortality rate was 14.3% in patients with tracheostomy and 30.8% in those without tracheostomy. When more than 4 intubation trials were needed, there was a significantly higher mortality rate. In neurologically handicapped patients with deformity or hypertonia of the oral, cervical, or airway structures, a bronchofiberoptic procedure may be recommended when there is difficulty with intubation.\n\nEffect of Use of a Bougie vs Endotracheal Tube and Stylet on First-Attempt Intubation Success Among Patients With Difficult Airways Undergoing Emergency Intubation: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nDriver, Brian E; Prekker, Matthew E; Klein, Lauren R; Reardon, Robert F; Miner, James R; Fagerstrom, Erik T; Cleghorn, Mitchell R; McGill, John W; Cole, Jon B\n\n2018-05-16\n\nThe tracheal tube introducer, known as the bougie, is typically used to aid tracheal intubation in poor laryngoscopic views or after intubation attempts fail. The effect of routine bougie use on first-attempt intubation success is unclear. To compare first attempt intubation success facilitated by the bougie vs the endotracheal tubeâ+âstylet. The Bougie Use in Emergency Airway Management (BEAM) trial was a randomized clinical trial conducted from September 2016 through August 2017 in the emergency department at Hennepin County Medical Center, an urban, academic department in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where emergency physicians perform all endotracheal intubations. Included patients were 18 years and older who were consecutively admitted to the emergency department and underwent emergency orotracheal intubation with a Macintosh laryngoscope blade for respiratory arrest, difficulty breathing, or airway protection. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo the initial intubation attempt facilitated by bougie (nâ=â381) or endotracheal tubeâ+âstylet (nâ=â376). The primary outcome was first-attempt intubation success in patients with at least 1 difficult airway characteristic (body fluids obscuring the laryngeal view, airway obstruction or edema, obesity, short neck, small mandible, large tongue, facial trauma, or the need for cervical spine immobilization). Secondary outcomes were first-attempt success in all patients, first-attempt intubation success without hypoxemia, first-attempt duration, esophageal intubation, and hypoxemia. Among 757 patients who were randomized (mean age, 46 years; women, 230 [30%]), 757 patients (100%) completed the trial. Among the 380 patients with at least 1 difficult airway characteristic, first-attempt intubation success was higher in the bougie group (96%) than in the endotracheal tubeâ+âstylet group (82%) (absolute between-group difference, 14% [95% CI, 8% to 20%]). Among all patients, first-attempt intubation success\n\nValproate for agitation in critically ill patients: A retrospective study.\n\nPubMed\n\nGagnon, David J; Fontaine, Gabriel V; Smith, Kathryn E; Riker, Richard R; Miller, Russell R; Lerwick, Patricia A; Lucas, F L; Dziodzio, John T; Sihler, Kristen C; Fraser, Gilles L\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe purpose was to describe the use of valproate therapy for agitation in critically ill patients, examine its safety, and describe its relationship with agitation and delirium. This retrospective cohort study evaluated critically ill adults treated with valproate for agitation from December 2012 through February 2015. Information on valproate prescribing practices and safety was collected. Incidence of agitation, delirium, and concomitant psychoactive medication use was compared between valproate day 1 and valproate day 3. Concomitant psychoactive medication use was analyzed using mixed models. Fifty-three patients were evaluated. The median day of valproate therapy initiation was ICU day 7, and it was continued for a median of 7 days. The median maintenance dose was 1500 mg/d (23 mg/kg/d). The incidence of agitation (96% vs 61%, P < .0001) and delirium (68% vs 49%, P = .012) significantly decreased by valproate day 3. Treatment with opioids (77% vs 65%, P = .02) and dexmedetomidine (47% vs 24%, P = .004) also decreased. In mixed models analyses, valproate therapy was associated with reduced fentanyl equivalents (-185 Î¼g/d, P = .0003) and lorazepam equivalents (-2.1 mg/d, P = .0004). Hyperammonemia (19%) and thrombocytopenia (13%) were the most commonly observed adverse effects. Valproate therapy was associated with a reduction in agitation, delirium, and concomitant psychoactive medication use within 48 hours of initiation. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this descriptive correlational study, 80 surgical ICU patients were recruited and interviewed using 3 structured questionnaires: demographic information, scale of basic needs, and scale of communication difficulties. The intubated patients were found to have moderate communication difficulties. The sense of being loved and belonging was the most common need in the intubated patients studied (56.00 standardized scores). A significantly positive correlation was found between communication difficulties and general level of basic needs (r = .53, P < .01), and another positive correlation was found between the length of stay in ICUs and the need for love and belonging (r = .25, P < .05). The basic needs of intubated patients could be significantly predicted by communication difficulties (P = .002), use of physical restraints (P = .010), lack of intubation history (P = .005), and lower educational level (P = .005). These 4 predictors accounted for 47% of the total variance in basic needs. The intubated patients in surgical ICUs had moderate basic needs and communication difficulties. The fact that the basic needs could be predicted by communication difficulties, physical restraints, and educational level suggests that nurses in surgical ICUs need to improve skills of communication and limit the use of physical restraints, especially in patients with a lower educational level.\n\nPredictors of Silicone Tube Intubation Success in Patients with Lacrimal Drainage System Stenosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaek, Ji Sun; Lee, Saem; Lee, Jung Hye; Choi, Hye Sun; Jang, Jae Woo; Kim, Sung Joo\n\n2016-06-01\n\nTo evaluate prognostic factors affecting silicone tube intubation outcomes in Asian patients with lacrimal drainage system stenosis. A retrospective review was conducted on the medical records of 822 patients (1,118 eyes) who had undergone silicone tube intubation to treat lacrimal drainage system stenosis between January 2011 and December 2012. Patients were divided into two groups: a success group and a failure group. Success was defined as the disappearance of epiphora symptoms, normalization of tear meniscus height, and the easy passage of fluid without resistance on the postoperative syringing test. Patient and ocular parameters were compared between the success and failure groups. A total of 994 eyes of 727 patients were included in analyses. Patients had a mean follow-up period of 34.11 Â± 18.70 weeks. Silicone tube intubation was successful in 67.2% of participants. Significant differences between the success and failure groups were found for age (p < 0.001), history of ipsilateral facial palsy (p = 0.028), follow-up period (p < 0.001), and degree of passage on the preoperative syringing test (p = 0.001). Only age (p < 0.001) and degree of passage on the preoperative syringing test (p = 0.002) remained significantly associated with silicone tube intubation success in multivariate analysis. Age was negatively associated with silicone tube intubation success in patients with lacrimal drainage system stenosis. The success rate was higher in patients who showed easy passage of fluid without resistance on the preoperative syringing test. These factors should be considered by surgeons planning silicone tube intubation in patients with lacrimal drainage system stenosis.\n\nComparison of Oral and Axillary Temperatures in Intubated Pediatric Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nWood, Danielle; Heitschmidt, Mary; Fogg, Louis\n\n2018-05-10\n\nAccurate body temperature measurement is essential in providing timely care to critically ill patients. Current practice within the Pediatric ICU (PICU) at a Midwestern academic medical center is to obtain axillary temperatures in endotracheally intubated patients. According to research, axillary temperatures have greater variance than other forms of temperature measurement. Research in adult patients show that oral temperature measurement in endotracheally intubated patients is acceptable as the heated gases from the ventilator has no significant effect on measured temperatures. This study sought to determine if the same is true in pediatrics. Oral and axillary temperatures of endotracheally intubated pediatric patients were obtained during unit prescribed vital assessment intervals. Patients were divided into neonate, infant, and children age groups with 25 sets of temperatures obtained for each group. Descriptive statistics and Bland-Altman plot interpretation were performed to determine confidence intervals for each age group. Bland-Altman plot analysis of oral and axillary routes of temperature measurement showed a high positive correlation within all age groups studied. The infant age group showed lower correlation in comparison to neonates and children. The infant age group also had an outlier of data sets with lower oral temperatures as compared to the axilla. Oral temperature measurement is a viable alternative to axillary temperature measurement in endotracheally intubated pediatric patients. Correction factors for age groups were calculated for prediction of axillary temperature based on measured oral temperature. This study serves as evidence for practice change within the studied unit.

However, data specific to the emergent setting are lacking. We hypothesized that back-up head-elevated positioning would be associated with a decrease in complications related to tracheal intubation in the emergency room environment. This retrospective study was approved by the University of Washington Human Subjects Division (Seattle, WA). Eligible patients included all adults undergoing emergent tracheal intubation outside of the operating room by the anesthesiology-based airway service at 2 university-affiliated teaching hospitals. All intubations were through direct laryngoscopy for an indication other than full cardiopulmonary arrest. Patient characteristics and details of the intubation procedure were derived from the medical record. The primary study endpoint was the occurrence of a composite of any intubation-related complication: difficult intubation, hypoxemia, esophageal intubation, or pulmonary aspiration. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of the primary endpoint in the supine versus back-up head-elevated positions with adjustment for a priori-defined potential confounders (body mass index and a difficult intubation prediction score [Mallampati, obstructive sleep Apnea, Cervical mobility, mouth Opening, Coma, severe Hypoxemia, and intubation by a non-Anesthesiologist score]). Five hundred twenty-eight patients were analyzed. Overall, at least 1 intubation-related complication occurred in 76 of 336 (22.6%) patients managed in the supine position compared with 18 of 192 (9.3%) patients managed in the back-up head-elevated position. After adjusting for body mass index and the Mallampati, obstructive sleep Apnea, Cervical mobility, mouth Opening, Coma, severe Hypoxemia, and intubation by a non-Anesthesiologist score, the odds of encountering the\n\nPrehospital rapid sequence intubation improves functional outcome for patients with severe traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernard, Stephen A; Nguyen, Vina; Cameron, Peter; Masci, Kevin; Fitzgerald, Mark; Cooper, David J; Walker, Tony; Std, B Paramed; Myles, Paul; Murray, Lynne; David; Taylor; Smith, Karen; Patrick, Ian; Edington, John; Bacon, Andrew; Rosenfeld, Jeffrey V; Judson, Rodney\n\n2010-12-01\n\nTo determine whether paramedic rapid sequence intubation in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) improves neurologic outcomes at 6 months compared with intubation in the hospital. Severe TBI is associated with a high rate of mortality and long-term morbidity. Comatose patients with TBI routinely undergo endo-tracheal intubation to protect the airway, prevent hypoxia, and control ventilation. In many places, paramedics perform intubation prior to hospital arrival. However, it is unknown whether this approach improves outcomes. In a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned adults with severe TBI in an urban setting to either prehospital rapid sequence intubation by paramedics or transport to a hospital emergency department for intubation by physicians. The primary outcome measure was the median extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSe) score at 6 months. Secondary end-points were favorable versus unfavorable outcome at 6 months, length of intensive care and hospital stay, and survival to hospital discharge. A total of 312 patients with severe TBI were randomly assigned to paramedic rapid sequence intubation or hospital intubation. The success rate for paramedic intubation was 97%. At 6 months, the median GOSe score was 5 (interquartile range, 1-6) in patients intubated by paramedics compared with 3 (interquartile range, 1-6) in the patients intubated at hospital (P = 0.28).The proportion of patients with favorable outcome (GOSe, 5-8) was 80 of 157 patients (51%) in the paramedic intubation group compared with 56 of 142 patients (39%) in the hospital intubation group (risk ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.64; P = 0.046). There were no differences in intensive care or hospital length of stay, or in survival to hospital discharge. In adults with severe TBI, prehospital rapid sequence intubation by paramedics increases the rate of favorable neurologic outcome at 6 months compared with intubation in the hospital.\n\nThe intubating laryngeal mask. II: A preliminary clinical report of a new means of intubating the trachea.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrain, A I; Verghese, C; Addy, E V; Kapila, A; Brimacombe, J\n\n1997-12-01\n\nWe have assessed the efficacy of a new laryngeal mask prototype, the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA), as a ventilatory device and blind intubation guide. The ILMA consists of an anatomically curved, short, wide bore, stainless steel tube sheathed in silicone which is bonded to a laryngeal mask and a guiding handle. It has a single moveable aperture bar, a guiding ramp and can accommodate an 8 mm tracheal tube (TT). After induction of anaesthesia with propofol 2.5 mg kg-1 and fentanyl 2.5 micrograms kg-1, the device was inserted successfully at the first attempt in all 150 (100%) patients and adequate ventilation achieved in all, with minor adjustments required in four patients. Placement did not require movement of the head and neck or insertion of the fingers in the patient's mouth. Blind tracheal intubation using a straight silicone cuffed TT was attempted after administration of atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1. If resistance was felt during intubation, a sequence of adjusting manoeuvres was used based on the depth at which resistance occurred. Tracheal intubation was possible in 149 of 150 (99.3%) patients. In 75 (50%) patients no resistance was encountered and the trachea was intubated at the first attempt, 28 (19%) patients required one adjusting manoeuvre and 46 (31%) patients required 2-4 adjusting manoeuvres before intubation was successful. There were 13 patients with potential or known airway problems. The lungs of all of these patients were ventilated easily and the trachea intubated using the ILMA. In 10 of 13 (77%) of these patients, no resistance was encountered and the trachea was intubated at the first attempt; three of 13 (23%) patients required one adjusting manoeuvre. Tracheal intubation required significantly fewer adjusting manoeuvres in patients with a predicted or known difficult airway (P < 0.05). We conclude that the ILMA appeared on initial assessment to be an effective ventilatory device and intubation guide for routine and difficult\n\nTracheal intubation in critically ill patients: a comprehensive systematic review of randomized trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nCabrini, Luca; Landoni, Giovanni; Baiardo Radaelli, Martina; Saleh, Omar; Votta, Carmine D; Fominskiy, Evgeny; Putzu, Alessandro; Snak de Souza, CÃ©zar Daniel; Antonelli, Massimo; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Pelosi, Paolo; Zangrillo, Alberto\n\n2018-01-20\n\nWe performed a systematic review of randomized controlled studies evaluating any drug, technique or device aimed at improving the success rate or safety of tracheal intubation in the critically ill. We searched PubMed, BioMed Central, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials and references of retrieved articles. Finally, pertinent reviews were also scanned to detect further studies until May 2017. The following inclusion criteria were considered: tracheal intubation in adult critically ill patients; randomized controlled trial; study performed in Intensive Care Unit, Emergency Department or ordinary ward; and work published in the last 20Â years. Exclusion criteria were pre-hospital or operating theatre settings and simulation-based studies. Two investigators selected studies for the final analysis. Extracted data included first author, publication year, characteristics of patients and clinical settings, intervention details, comparators and relevant outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool. We identified 22 trials on use of a pre-procedure check-list (1 study), pre-oxygenation or apneic oxygenation (6 studies), sedatives (3 studies), neuromuscular blocking agents (1 study), patient positioning (1 study), video laryngoscopy (9 studies), and post-intubation lung recruitment (1 study). Pre-oxygenation with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and/or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) showed a possible beneficial role. Post-intubation recruitment improved oxygenation , while ramped position increased the number of intubation attempts and thiopental had negative hemodynamic effects. No effect was found for use of a checklist, apneic oxygenation (on oxygenation and hemodynamics), videolaryngoscopy (on number and length of intubation attempts), sedatives and neuromuscular blockers (on hemodynamics). Finally, videolaryngoscopy was associated with severe adverse effects in multiple trials.

We sought to determine whether the duration of agitation and fluctuating consciousness were also associated with outcomes in patients with SAH. We identified all patients with positive Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores from a prospective observational cohort of patients with SAH from 2011 to 2015. Total duration of agitation was extrapolated for each patient using available RASS scores, and 24-h mean and standard deviation (SD) of RASS scores were calculated for each patient. We also calculated each patient's duration of substantial fluctuation of consciousness, defined as the number of days with 24-h RASS SDÂ >Â 1. Patients were stratified by 3-month outcome using the modified Rankin scale, and associations with outcome were assessed via logistic regression. There were 98 patients with at least one positive RASS score, with median total duration of agitation 8Â h (interquartile range [IQR] 4-18), and median duration of substantially fluctuating consciousness 2Â days (IQR 1-3). Unfavorable 3-month outcome was significantly associated with a longer duration of fluctuating consciousness (odds ratio [OR] per day, 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.20; pÂ =Â 0.031), but a briefer duration of agitation (OR per hour, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-0.99; pÂ =Â 0.031). Though a longer duration of fluctuating consciousness was associated with worse outcomes in our cohort, total duration of agitation was not, and may have had the opposite effect. Our findings should therefore challenge the intensity with which agitation is often treated in SAH patients.\n\nThe Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway Allows Tracheal Intubation When the Cervical Spine Is Immobilized by a Rigid Collar\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKomatsu, Ryu; Nagata, Osamu; Kamata, Kotoe; Yamagata, Katsuyuki; Sessler, Daniel I.; Ozaki, Makoto\n\n2005-01-01\n\nSummary An intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) facilitates tracheal intubation with the neck in neutral position, which is similar to the neck position maintained by a rigid cervical collar. However, a cervical collar virtually obliterates neck movement, even the small movements that normally facilitate airway insertion. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the ILMA facilitates tracheal intubation even in patients wearing a rigid cervical collar. In 50 cervical spine surgery patients with a rigid Philadelphia collar in place and 50 general surgery patients under general anaesthesia, we performed blind tracheal intubation via an ILMA. The time required for intubation, intubation success rate, and numbers and type of adjusting manoeuvres employed were recorded. Inter-incisor distance was significantly smaller (4.1 [0.8] cm vs. 4.6 [0.7] cm, mean [SD], P<0.01) and Mallampati scores were significantly greater (P<0.001) in the collared patients. ILMA insertion took longer (30 [25] vs. 22 [6] seconds), more patients required 2 insertion attempts (15 vs. 3; P<0.005), and ventilation adequacy with ILMA was worse (P<0.05) in collared patients. However, there were no significant differences between the collared and control patients in terms of total time required for intubation (60 [41] vs. 50 [30] seconds), number of intubation attempts, overall intubation success rate (96 vs. 98%), or the incidence of intubation complications. Blind intubation through an ILMA is thus a reasonable strategy for controlling the airway in patients who are immobilized with a rigid cervical collar, especially when urgency precludes a fiberoptic approach.

Patients with blunt trauma are at increased risk of unrecognized cervical spine injury, especially patients with head trauma. Manual in-line stabilization reduces cervical motion and should be applied whenever a cervical collar is removed. All airway interventions cause some degree of cervical spine motion. Flexible fiberoptic intubation causes the least cervical motion of all intubation approaches, and rigid video laryngoscopy provides a good laryngeal view and eases intubation difficulty. In emergency medicine departments, video laryngoscopy use is growing and observational data suggest an improved success rate compared with direct laryngoscopy. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Prehospital personnel frequently encounter agitated, combative, and intoxicated patients in the field. In recent years, ketamine has been described as an effective sedative agent to treat such patients; however, a paucity of research exists describing the use of prehospital ketamine. The objective of this study was to provide a descriptive analysis of the Columbus Division of Fire's experience with utilizing ketamine in the prehospital setting. We hypothesized that ketamine administration improves patient condition, is effective at sedating patients, and does not result in endotracheal intubation in the prehospital setting or in the emergency department (ED). Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort chart review of Columbus Division of Fire patient care reports and hospital records from destination hospitals in the central Ohio region between October 2010 and October 2012. All patients receiving ketamine administered by Columbus Division of Fire personnel for sedation were included. Patients 17Â years and younger were excluded. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients noted to have an \"improved\" condition recorded in the data field of the patient care report. The secondary outcomes were the effectiveness of sedation and the performance of endotracheal intubation. Results. A total of 36 patients met inclusion criteria over the study period. Data were available on 35 patients for analysis. The mean IV dose of ketamine was 138Â mg (SD = 59.5, 100-200). The mean IM dose of ketamine was 324Â mg (SD = 120, 100-500). Prehospital records noted an improvement in patient condition after ketamine administration in 32 cases (91%, 95% CI 77-98%). Six patients required sedation post-ketamine administration either by EMS (2) or in the ED (4) (17%, 95% CI 6.5-34%). Endotracheal intubation was performed in eight (23%, 95% CI 10-40%) patients post-ketamine administration. Conclusion. We found that in a cohort of patients administered ketamine\n\nAwake Fibreoptic Intubation for Forearm Injury in a Patient with Occipito-Cervical Fixator\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAkkaya, Akcan; YÄ±ldÄ±z, Ä°sa; Demirhan, Abdullah; TekelioÄlu, Ãmit YaÅar; KoÃ§oÄlu, Hasan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA 23-year-old male patient with occipitocervical fixator was scheduled for surgery due to injury to the right forearm. The patientâs thyromental distance was 5 cm, mouth opening grade II, sternomental distance 10 cm and Mallampati score 4. Loss of extension and rotation movements of the head was assessed as difficult intubation criteria. Anaesthetic procedures are almost always difficult in patients with occipitocervical fixation; the limited cervical extension complicated both intubation and ventilation. In this report, application of general anaesthesia using awake fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation (FOB) is described. After routine monitoring of vital signs and premedication, hypopharyngeal topical anaesthesia was accomplished by instilling 10% lidocaine spray twice via the appropriate nostril. Superior laryngeal nerve block was performed with local anaesthetic infiltration of tissues 1 cm below the greater horns of the hyoid bone. Lingual and pharyngeal branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve were blocked. Transtracheal block was performed. Following completion of local anaesthesia, the patient was intubated using the awake FOB technique, on 5 L minâ1 of 100% O2. After muscle relaxation, the patient underwent a microsurgical operation to repair eight tendons, one artery, and one nerve. Surgery lasted for 5 hours. When the extubation criteria were met, the patient was extubated. In cases of occipitocervical fixation, which causes severe limitation of neck movements, the use of awake fibreoptic intubation should be considered.

Twenty-three institutionalized dementia patients who had sleep disturbance and/or agitation participated in a 5-week study protocol of 1 week of baseline and 4 weeks of treatment. The study design was a one group repeated measures study. For the first and fifth week of the study period, sleep patterns, agitation, and cognition were evaluated using a sleep diary, Modified Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory and revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale respectively. Significant improvement in wake after sleep onset, nap, nocturnal sleep time, and nocturnal sleep efficiency was identified. On the contrary sleep onset time, wake-up time, total sleep time did not change after indoor gardening. Agitation and cognition score was significantly improved. Indoor gardening was found to be effective for sleep, agitation, and cognition of dementia patients. Randomized controlled studies of larger sample size are needed to confirm treatment effect.\n\nProtocol for rapid sequence intubation in pediatric patients -- a four-year study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarvez-Valls, Eduardo; Houry, Debra; Ernst, Amy A; Weiss, Steven J; Killeen, James\n\n2002-04-01\n\nTo evaluate a protocol for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) for pediatric patients in a Level 1 trauma center. Retrospective review of prospectively gathered Continuing Quality Improvement (CQI) data at an inner city Level 1 trauma center with an emergency medicine residency program. Protocols for RSI were established prior to initiating the study. All pediatric intubations at the center from February 1996 to February 2000 were included. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics for categorical data and Chi-square for comparisons between groups. Over the 4-year study period there were 83 pediatric intubations ranging in age from 18 months to 17 years; mean age 8.6. All had data collected at the time of intubation. There were 20 (24%) females and 62 (76%) males (p<0.001). Reasons for intubation were related to trauma in 71 (86%) and medical reasons in 12 (14%) (p<0.001). Of the trauma intubations 7 (10%) were for gunshot wounds, 39 (55%) were secondary to MVCs, and the remainder (25; 35%) were from assaults, falls, and closed head injuries. The non-trauma intubations were for smoke inhalation, overdose, seizure, HIV related complications, eclampsia, and near drowning. Intubations were successful with one attempt in 65 (78%) cases. No surgical airways were necessary. Rocuronium was used in 4 cases. Protocol deviations did not lead to complications. This protocol based pediatric rapid sequence intubation method worked well in an EM residency program. More intubations were in males and more were necessary due to trauma in this group.\n\nPrehospital Agitation and Sedation Trial (PhAST): A Randomized Control Trial of Intramuscular Haloperidol versus Intramuscular Midazolam for the Sedation of the Agitated or Violent Patient in the Prehospital Environment.\n\nPubMed\n\nIsenberg, Derek L; Jacobs, Dorian\n\n2015-10-01\n\nViolent patients in the prehospital environment pose a threat to health care workers tasked with managing their medical conditions. While research has focused on methods to control the agitated patient in the emergency department (ED), there is a paucity of data looking at the optimal approach to subdue these patients safely in the prehospital setting. Hypothesis This study evaluated the efficacy of two different intramuscular medications, midazolam and haloperidol, to determine their efficacy in sedating agitated patients in the prehospital setting. This was a prospective, randomized, observational trial wherein agitated patients were administered intramuscular haloperidol or intramuscular midazolam to control agitation. Agitation was quantified by the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). Paramedics recorded the RASS and vital signs every five minutes during transport and again upon arrival to the ED. The primary outcome was mean time to achieve a RASS less than +1. Secondary outcomes included mean time for patients to return to baseline mental status and adverse events. Five patients were enrolled in each study group. In the haloperidol group, the mean time to achieve a RASS score of less than +1 was 24.8 minutes (95% CI, 8-49 minutes), and the mean time for the return of a normal mental status was 84 minutes (95% CI, 0-202 minutes). Two patients required additional prehospital doses for adequate sedation. There were no adverse events recorded in the patients administered haloperidol. In the midazolam group, the mean time to achieve a RASS score of less than +1 was 13.5 minutes (95% CI, 8-19 minutes) and the mean time for the return of normal mental status was 105 minutes (95% CI, 0-178 minutes). One patient required additional sedation in the ED. There were no adverse events recorded among the patients administered midazolam. Midazolam and haloperidol administered intramuscularly appear equally effective for sedating an agitated patient in the\n\nAddressing Dual Patient and Staff Safety Through A Team-Based Standardized Patient Simulation for Agitation Management in the Emergency Department.\n\nPubMed\n\nWong, Ambrose H; Auerbach, Marc A; Ruppel, Halley; Crispino, Lauren J; Rosenberg, Alana; Iennaco, Joanne D; Vaca, Federico E\n\n2018-06-01\n\nEmergency departments (EDs) have seen harm rise for both patients and health workers from an increasing rate of agitation events. Team effectiveness during care of this population is particularly challenging because fear of physical harm leads to competing interests. Simulation is frequently employed to improve teamwork in medical resuscitations but has not yet been reported to address team-based behavioral emergency care. As part of a larger investigation of agitated patient care, we designed this secondary study to examine the impact of an interprofessional standardized patient simulation for ED agitation management. We used a mixed-methods approach with emergency medicine resident and attending physicians, Physician Assistants (PAs) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), ED nurses, technicians, and security officers at two hospital sites. After a simulated agitated patient encounter, we conducted uniprofessional and interprofessional focus groups. We undertook structured thematic analysis using a grounded theory approach. Quantitative data consisted of responses to the KidSIM Questionnaire addressing teamwork and simulation-based learning attitudes before and after each session. We reached data saturation with 57 participants. KidSIM scores revealed significant improvements in attitudes toward relevance of simulation, opportunities for interprofessional education, and situation awareness, as well as four of six questions for roles/responsibilities. Two broad themes emerged from the focus groups: (1) a team-based agitated patient simulation addressed dual safety of staff and patients simultaneously and (2) the experience fostered interprofessional discovery and cooperation in agitation management. A team-based simulated agitated patient encounter highlighted the need to consider the dual safety of staff and patients while facilitating interprofessional dialog and learning. Our findings suggest that simulation may be effective to enhance teamwork in\n\nA Randomized Controlled Trial of a CPR and Intubation Video Decision Support Tool for Hospitalized Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Jawahri, Areej; Mitchell, Susan L; Paasche-Orlow, Michael K; Temel, Jennifer S; Jackson, Vicki A; Rutledge, Renee R; Parikh, Mihir; Davis, Aretha D; Gillick, Muriel R; Barry, Michael J; Lopez, Lenny; Walker-Corkery, Elizabeth S; Chang, Yuchiao; Finn, Kathleen; Coley, Christopher; Volandes, Angelo E\n\n2015-08-01\n\nDecisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and intubation are a core part of advance care planning, particularly for seriously ill hospitalized patients. However, these discussions are often avoided. We aimed to examine the impact of a video decision tool for CPR and intubation on patients' choices, knowledge, medical orders, and discussions with providers. This was a prospective randomized trial conducted between 9 March 2011 and 1 June 2013 on the internal medicine services at two hospitals in Boston. One hundred and fifty seriously ill hospitalized patients over the age of 60 with an advanced illness and a prognosis of 1 year or less were included. Mean age was 76 and 51% were women. Three-minute video describing CPR and intubation plus verbal communication of participants' preferences to their physicians (intervention) (Nâ=â75) or control arm (usual care) (Nâ=â75). The primary outcome was participants' preferences for CPR and intubation (immediately after viewing the video in the intervention arm). Secondary outcomes included: orders to withhold CPR/intubation, documented discussions with providers during hospitalization, and participants' knowledge of CPR/ intubation (five-item test, range 0-5, higher scores indicate greater knowledge). Intervention participants (vs. controls) were more likely not to want CPR (64% vs. 32%, p <0.0001) and intubation (72% vs. 43%, pâ<â0.0001). Intervention participants (vs. controls) were also more likely to have orders to withhold CPR (57% vs. 19%, pâ<â0.0001) and intubation (64% vs.19%, pâ<â0.0001) by hospital discharge, documented discussions about their preferences (81% vs. 43%, pâ<â0.0001), and higher mean knowledge scores (4.11 vs. 2.45; pâ<â0.0001). Seriously ill patients who viewed a video about CPR and intubation were more likely not to want these treatments, be better informed about their options, have orders to forgo CPR/ intubation, and discuss preferences with providers\n\nThe Effects of a Single Session of Music Therapy on the Agitated Behaviors of Patients Receiving Hospice Care.\n\nPubMed\n\nCadwalader, Alyssa; Orellano, Shashanna; Tanguay, Carla; Roshan, Ramesh\n\n2016-08-01\n\nResearch suggests that agitation is a common symptom for hospice patients, but while studies have examined the outcomes of music therapy on the agitated behaviors of patients in other settings, none have addressed this symptom in patients with terminal illnesses. The study objective was to determine whether a single session of music therapy provided by a board certified music therapist and using the entrainment principle would decrease agitation in hospice patients. This pilot study was a single-blind, pretest/posttest design. Music therapists used the principle of entrainment with live music during the treatment session. Subjects included in the study were 77 patients at a large hospice in south Florida with documented agitation. Agitation was measured using the Overt Agitation Severity Scale (OASS) for 5 minutes prior to and 5 minutes following a 20 minute music therapy intervention. Results from 73 participants were analyzed with a mean difference of -5.77 points from pretest to posttest. Results indicating a decrease in agitation were statistically significant (pâ<â0.001) for the entire sample. Age, gender, location, and diagnosis were found to have no significant effects on the results. Results indicate that a single session of music therapy using the entrainment principle may be an effective treatment for hospice patients experiencing agitation.\n\nProper size of endotracheal tube for cleft lip and palate patients and intubation outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdollahifakhim, Shahin; Sheikhzadeh, Dariush; Shahidi, Nikzad; Nojavan, Gholamreza; Bayazian, Gholamreza; Aleshi, Hamideh\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe aim of the current study was to identify the proper size of endotracheal tube for intubation of cleft lip and palate patients and intubation outcomes in these patients. In this analytic cross-sectional study, 60 nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate patients were selected who had surgery between April 2010 and April 2012 at Pediatrics Hospital, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Demographic findings, previous admissions, and surgical history were registered. The proper tube size was measured by normal children formulas. Then tube size was confirmed by patients' minimum resistance to intubation, proper ventilation reported by anesthesiologist, and appropriate air leakage at an airway pressure of 15-20 cm HâO. If intubation was unsuccessful then smaller size of endotracheal tube would be tried. Frequency of intubation trials and the biggest endotracheal tube size were recorded. Their average age, weight and height were 21.39 Â± 4.95 months, 9.97 Â± 1.18 kg and 74.30 Â± 26.61 cm, respectively. The average tracheal tube size and frequency of intubation trials were 4.34 Â± 0.78 and 1.63 Â± 0.80, respectively. Seven cases required an endotracheal tube size smaller than the recommended size for that age including one case in unilateral cleft palate, three cases in unilateral cleft lip, one case in unilateral cleft lip and palate, and two cases in bilateral cleft lip and palate. Findings proved that considering subglottic stenosis incidence in these children, it is reasonable to determine the tube size for nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate patients by applying the currently available standards for normal children.

Methods: Motion, force, and duration of laryngoscopy on a manikin were compared in two separate experiments between beginning anesthesiology residents (CA1) and anesthesiologists with more than 24 months of anesthesiology training (CA3 or attendings). In one experiment, CA1 residents were also evaluated for the percentage of their laryngoscope path that followed the route used by attending anesthesiologists. The residents were then observed for patient intubation outcomes for 4 weeks after manikin testing. The relationship between manikin test metrics and patient intubation outcomes was analyzed by multilevel modeling. Results: CA1 residents positioned the laryngoscope blade farther right and with less lift than did experienced anesthesiologists. Endpoint position was 0.6 Â± 0.3 cm left of midline for residents (n = 10) versus 2.7 Â± 0.3 cm for advanced anesthesiologists (n = 8; P = .0003), and 15.6 Â± 0.8 versus 17.7 Â± 0.2 cm above the table surface, respectively (P = .033). On average, only 74 Â± 6% of the CA1 laryngoscopy trajectory coincided with the Attending Route (P < .001 versus 100%). For each percentage point increase in Attending Route match, residents' odds of intubating a patient's trachea improved by a factor of 1.033 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.007â1.059, P = .040), and their rate of failed laryngoscopy attempts decreased by a factor of 0.982 (0.969â0.996, P = .045). Discussion: Laryngoscopy motion in manikins may predict which trainees can complete a patient intubation successfully in a few attempts. The assessment could help determine readiness for intubating patients with indirect supervision.\n\nModified single-port non-intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic decortication in high-risk parapneumonic empyema patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nHsiao, Chen-Hao; Chen, Ke-Cheng; Chen, Jin-Shing\n\n2017-04-01\n\nParapneumonic empyema patients with coronary artery disease and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction are risky to receive surgical decortication under general anesthesia. Non-intubated video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery is successfully performed to avoid complications of general anesthesia. We performed single-port non-intubated video-assisted flexible thoracoscopy surgery in an endoscopic center. In this study, the possible role of our modified surgery to treat fibrinopurulent stage of parapneumonic empyema with high operative risks is investigated. We retrospectively reviewed fibrinopurulent stage of parapneumonic empyema patients between July 2011 and June 2014. Thirty-three patients with coronary artery disease and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction were included in this study. One group received tube thoracostomy, and the other group received single-port non-intubated video-assisted flexible thoracoscopy surgery decortication. Patient demographics, characteristics, laboratory findings, etiology, and treatment outcomes were compared. Mean age of 33 patients (24 males, 9 females) was 76.2Â Â±Â 9.7Â years. Twelve patients received single-port non-intubated video-assisted flexible thoracoscopy surgery decortication, and 21 patients received tube thoracostomy. Visual analog scale scores on postoperative first hour and first day were not significantly different in two groups (p valueÂ =Â 0.5505 and 0.2750, respectively). Chest tube drainage days, postoperative fever subsided days, postoperative hospital days, and total length of stay were significantly short in single-port non-intubated video-assisted flexible thoracoscopy surgery decortication (p valueÂ =Â 0.0027, 0.0001, 0.0009, and 0.0065, respectively). Morbidities were low, and mortality was significantly low (p valueÂ =Â 0.0319) in single-port non-intubated video-assisted flexible thoracoscopy surgery decortication.

We aimed to calculate the economic consequences of agitation events in an in-patient psychiatric facility providing care for an urban catchment area. A mixed approach combining secondary analysis of clinical databases, surveys and expert knowledge was used to model the 2013 direct costs of agitation and containment events for adult inpatients with mental disorders in an area of 640,572 adult inhabitants in South Barcelona (Spain). To calculate costs, a seven-step methodology with novel definition of agitation was used along with a staff survey, a database of containment events, and data on aggressive incidents. A micro-costing analysis of specific containment interventions was used to estimate both prevalence and direct costs from the healthcare provider perspective, by means of a mixed approach with a probabilistic model evaluated on real data. Due to the complex interaction of the multivariate covariances, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to have empirical bounds of variability. During 2013, 918 patients were admitted to the Acute Inpatient Unit. Of these, 52.8% were men, with a mean age of 44.6Â years (SDÂ =Â 15.5), 74.4% were compulsory admissions, 40.1% were diagnosed with schizophrenia or non-affective psychosis, with a mean length of stay of 24.6Â days (SDÂ =Â 16.9). The annual estimate of total agitation events was 508. The cost of containment interventions ranges from 282â¬ at the lowest level of agitation to 822â¬ when verbal containment plus seclusion and restraint have to be used. The annual total cost of agitation was 280,535â¬, representing 6.87% of the total costs of acute hospitalisation in the local area. Agitation events are frequent and costly. Strategies to reduce their number and severity should be implemented to reduce costs to the Health System and alleviate patient suffering.\n\nEndotracheal Intubation and In-Hospital Mortality after Intracerebral Hemorrhage.\n\nPubMed\n\nLioutas, Vasileios-Arsenios; Marchina, Sarah; Caplan, Louis R; Selim, Magdy; Tarsia, Joseph; Catanese, Luciana; Edlow, Jonathan; Kumar, Sandeep\n\n2018-06-13\n\nMany patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs) undergo endotracheal intubation with subsequent mechanical ventilation (MV) for \"airway protection\" with the intent to prevent aspiration, pneumonias, and its related mortality. Conversely, these procedures may independently promote pneumonia, laryngeal trauma, dysphagia, and adversely affect patient outcomes. The net benefit of intubation and MV in this patient cohort has not been systematically investigated. We conducted a large single-center observational cohort study to examine the independent association between endotracheal intubation and MV, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and in-hospital mortality (HM) in patients with ICH. All consecutive patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of a spontaneous ICH to a tertiary care hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, from June 2000 through January 2014, who were â¥18 years of age and hospitalized for â¥2 days were eligible for inclusion. Patients with pneumonia on admission, or those having brain or lung neoplasms were excluded. Our exposure of interest was endotracheal intubation and MV during hospitalization; our primary outcomes were incidence of HAP and HM, ascertained using International Classification of Diseases-9 and administrative discharge disposition codes, respectively, in patients who underwent endotracheal intubation and MV versus those who did not. Multivariable logistic regression was used to control for confounders. Of the 2,386 hospital admissions screened, 1,384 patients fulfilled study criteria and were included in the final analysis. A total of 507 (36.6%) patients were intubated. Overall 133 (26.23%) patients in the intubated group developed HAP versus 41 (4.67%) patients in the non-intubated group (p < 0.0001); 195 (38.5%) intubated patients died during hospitalization compared to 48 (5.5%) non-intubated patients (p < 0.0001). After confounder adjustments, OR for HAP and HM, were 4.23 (95% CI 2.48-7.22; p < 0.0001) and 4.32 (95% CI 2\n\nIntubation Biomechanics: Laryngoscope Force and Cervical Spine Motion during Intubation in CadaversâCadavers vs. Patients, the Effect of Repeated Intubations, and the Effect of Type II Odontoid Fracture on C1-C2 Motion\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHindman, Bradley J.; From, Robert P.; Fontes, Ricardo B.; Traynelis, Vincent C.; Todd, Michael M.; Zimmerman, M. Bridget; Puttlitz, Christian M.; Santoni, Brandon G.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntroduction The aims of this study were to characterize: 1) cadaver intubation biomechanics, including the effect of repeated intubations; and 2) the relationship between intubation force and the motion of an injured cervical segment. Methods Fourteen cadavers were serially intubated using force-sensing Macintosh and Airtraq laryngoscopes in random order, with simultaneous cervical spine motion recorded with lateral fluoroscopy. Motion of the C1-C2 segment was measured in the intact and injured state (Type II odontoid fracture). Injured C1-C2 motion was proportionately corrected for changes in intubation forces that occurred with repeated intubations. Results Cadaver intubation biomechanics were comparable to those of patients in all parameters other than C2-C5 extension. In cadavers, intubation force (Set 2/Set1 force ratio = 0.61 [95% CI: 0.46, 0.81]; P=0.002) and Oc-C5 extension (Set 2 âSet 1 difference = â6.1 degrees [95% CI: â11.4, â0.9]; P=0.025) decreased with repeated intubations. In cadavers, C1-C2 extension did not differ: 1) between intact and injured states; or 2) in the injured state, between laryngoscopes (with and without force correction). With force correction, in the injured state, C1-C2 subluxation was greater with the Airtraq (mean difference 2.8 mm [95% CI: 0.7, 4.9 mm]; P=0.004). Discussion With limitations, cadavers may be clinically relevant models of intubation biomechanics and cervical spine motion. In the setting of a Type II odontoid fracture, C1-C2 motion during intubation with either the Macintosh or Airtraq does not appear to greatly exceed physiologic values or to have a high likelihood of hyperextension or direct cord compression.

However, the role of the AWS in routine nasotracheal intubation has not been studied adequately. One hundred and three patients undergoing dental and maxillofacial surgery that required general anesthesia and nasotracheal intubation were enrolled. The study was approved by our Institution Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. We evaluated the success rate of AWS intubation and the incidence of difficult nasotracheal intubation using a modified intubation difficulty scale (IDS) to examine preoperative characteristics and intubation profiles. Categories were difficult intubation (IDS â¥5), mildly difficult (IDS = 1-4), and intubation without difficulty (IDS = 0). We also assessed the incidence of the use of Magill forceps or cuff inflation (the cuff of endotracheal tube is inflated with 10-15 ml air) to guide the endotracheal tube into the glottis. AWS nasotracheal intubation was 100% successful. The cuff inflation technique was used in 37 patients. Neither Magill forceps nor other devices were needed for any patient during AWS use. The incidence of difficult nasotracheal intubation was 10% (n = 10). Of the patients, 61% (n = 63) had mildly difficult intubation and 29% (n = 30) had no difficulty. Patients with difficult intubation were more likely to be male and to have a larger tongue and a higher Cormack grade than in the other two groups. Complications, involving minor soft tissue injury, were observed in only 1 patient (1%). The AWS achieves a high success rate for nasotracheal intubation with cuff inflation in patients undergoing dental and maxillofacial surgery.\n\n[Comparison between VAMA(Â®) and Berman(Â®) cannulas for fibroscopic orotracheal intubation in anaesthetised patients].\n\nPubMed\n\nCastaÃ±eda Pascual, M; Batllori GastÃ³n, M; UnzuÃ© Rico, P; Murillo Jaso, E; Dorronsoro Auzmendi, M; MartÃ­n VizcaÃ­no, M P\n\n2013-03-01\n\nIn fibroscopic intubation, the fact of achieving a direct view in real time does not guarantee the correct advance of the endotracheal tube (ET) to its intratracheal position. The use of oral cannulas helps in achieving a free airway in order to pass the fibroscope and the ET. This study compares the VAMA(Â®) (V) and Berman(Â®) (B) cannulas as regards the time required for the intubation, fibroscopic view, and the ease in positioning the ET. 90 patients with no signs of difficult airway were randomised into 2 groups, Berman(Â®) (B) and VAMA(Â®) (V), depending on the type of cannula employed. After inducing general anaesthesia, they were intubated using a flexible fibroscope. The fibroscope and intubation times were recorded, as well as the quality of the fibroscopic view, and the level of difficulty in positioning the ET. No statistically significant differences were observed between the cannulas, although the intubation time (P=.292) and the difficulty found in positioning the ET were slightly less (P=.447) in the VAMA(Â®) group compared to the Berman(Â®) group. The vision quality was good with both devices, with only some degree of obstruction being encountered in only 22% of the patients. In no case was there complete obstruction, thus all the patients could be intubated correctly. The VAMA(Â®) cannula is an effective alternative to the classic cannulas for fibreoptic assisted intubation. Furthermore, the novel design provides advantages for the correct orientation of the fiberscope and the withdrawal of the cannula after intubation.

Wesley\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: To improve patient safety in our NICU by decreasing the incidence of intubation-associated adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We sequentially implemented and tested 3 interventions: standardized checklist for intubation, premedication algorithm, and computerized provider order entry set for intubation. We compared baseline data collected over 10 months (period 1) with data collected over a 10-month intervention and sustainment period (period 2). Outcomes were the percentage of intubations containing any prospectively defined AE and intubations with bradycardia or hypoxemia. We followed process measures for each intervention. We used risk ratios (RRs) and statistical process control methods in a times series design to assess differences between the 2 periods. RESULTS: AEs occurred in 126/"
