        "text": "Pyelonephritis in Pregnancy: Clinical and Laboratorial Aspects and Perinatal Results.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZanatta, Djulie Anne de Lemos; Rossini, Mariane de Mello; Trapani JÃºnior, Alberto\n\n2017-12-01\n\nObjective âTo identify the prevalence of pyelonephritis during pregnancy and to analyze the clinical and laboratorial aspects, perinatal results and complications. Methods âA transversal study of 203 pregnant women who had pyelonephritis during pregnancy and whose labor took place between 2010 and 2016 at a hospital in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The analysis was based on medical records as well as on the hospital's database. Clinical and laboratory conditions, antibiotics, bacterial resistance, perinatal outcomes and complications were all taken into account. The data was compared using the Mann-Whitney test and the Chi-square test. Results âA prevalence of 1.97% with pyelonephritis was evidenced, with most patients having it during the second trimester of gestation. The bacteria most commonly found in the urine cultures was Escherichia coli , in 76.6% of cases, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%). Ceftriaxone had the lowest bacterial resistance (only 3.5% of the cases). On the other hand, ampicillin and cephalothin presented higher bacterial resistance, 52% and 36.2%, respectively. The risk of very premature delivery was more than 50% higher in patients with pyelonephritis. Conclusion âAmpicillin and first-generation cephalosporins are associated with a higher bacterial resistance while ceftriaxone proved to have a high efficacy for the treatment of pyelonephritis due to low bacterial resistance. Patients with pyelonephritis showed a higher risk for very premature delivery (< 32 weeks). In this casuistry, there were no others significant differences in the overall perinatal outcomes when compared with the routine service series.

Diabetics are clearly more prone to this type of pyelonephritis. However, cases have been described of recurrent EP in non-diabetic patients with urinary obstruction. In 69 to 97% of cases, the infectious agent implied is Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The impact of this disease on the morbidity and mortality of diabetic patients is very high. Therefore, knowledge of this condition enables early diagnosis and adequate treatment, with improved patient survival.\n\nXanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRubinstein, I.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe clinical, radiographic and pathological findings of 10 cases of Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis have been reviewed. It is a form of renal suppuration and obstruction most commonly seen in middle aged women although all ages and both sexes may be affected. Gram negative organism are usually present and bilateral involvement has been reported rarely. Preoperative angiography may increase the accuracy of differentiating this disorder from hipernephroma and may aid the surgeon is planning his approach to kidney resection depending upon the staging of Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis. Chronic renal failure is not usually a feature in this lesion and nephrectomy is curative without any incidence of recurrence.

We aimed to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between hospital and home treatment for these conditions and to identify factors influencing home treatment. Children admitted to the hospital with pyelonephritis or proven and presumed bacterial meningitis from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013 were identified retrospectively. Patients who received any OPAT (home group) received daily visits via our Hospital-in-the-Home (HITH) program; inpatients (hospital group) received standard care. Clinical and demographic features, length of stay, readmission rate and cost were compared between hospital and home groups. One hundred thirty-nine children with pyelonephritis and 70 with meningitis were identified, of which 127 and 44 were potentially suitable for OPAT, respectively. Of these, 12 (9%) with pyelonephritis received OPAT, contrasting with 29 (66%) with meningitis. Clinical features did not differ between hospital- and home-treated patients for either condition. Patients with meningitis in the hospital group were younger than those transferred to HITH (1 vs. 2 months; P = 0.01). All patients were afebrile before transfer to HITH. Admissions for pyelonephritis were brief with inpatients having a shorter length of stay than home patients (median: 3 vs. 4.5 days; P = 0.002). Unplanned readmission rates were comparable across all groups. Transfer to HITH resulted in a saving of AU$178,180. Children with pyelonephritis and meningitis can feasibly receive OPAT. Age, treatment duration and fever influence this decision. None of these should be barriers to OPAT, and the cost savings support change in practice.\n\nAcute pyelonephritis in ER\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGiovanni Volpicelli\n\n2007-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Symptoms and signs of acute pyelonephritis sometimes are subtle and emergency physicians attending overcrowded and busy institutions could easily miss the right diagnosis. The presence of a renal damage is decisive in the therapeutic choice. Aims of our study are: 1 to assess prevalence of renal damage in patients presenting to our ED with symptoms and signs of primary urinary tract infection (UTI; 2 to evaluate the reliability of such symptoms and signs in predicting a renal damage; 3 to assess accuracy of the contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS in the ED diagnosis of renal damage due to acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. We studied 54 patients with suspected UTI. Each patient underwent clinical examination, routine blood and urine sampling and conventional renal ultrasound (US. 23 patients had confirmation of acute primary UTI, and performed renal magnetic resonance (MR to rule out renal parenchymal involvement. In 16 patients (69,6% one or more parenchymal lesions were visualized at MR, and diagnosis of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis was confirmed (group A. The other 7 patients had a diagnosis of UTI without renal involvement (group B. Some of 23 patients presented with few atypical symptoms. Lumbar pain was the most frequent symptom (n = 21, without a statistically significant difference between group A and B (P 0,958; p = 0,328. No other symptom or sign has demonstrated statistically valid in predicting the renal involvement. Renal US was positive in only 3 patients of group A (18,7%. During this first part of our study, CEUS was performed in a limited number of patients (n = 8, and in 7 examinations data were concordant with MR. In conclusion, analysis of our preliminary data confirms that a distinction between patients with different extension of the UTI is not possible through the simple clinical examination and routine tests. CEUS is very promising and its routine employment in the ED could simplify the diagnostic practice in\n\nXantogranulomatous pyelonephritis in a horseshoe kidney: a case report\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMacedo Lemos, D. de; Albuquerque, S.C. de; Lemos, R.S. de; Cruz, F.J.B.; Coelho, J.P.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nA case of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis in a horseshoe kidney. The patient was a child, female, 8-year-old. In a recent review of the literature, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis occurs more often in the fourth and fifth decades. It is rare in children and no case has been reported of the association of horseshoe kidney and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. The use of several image diagnosis methods and the need of correlation with clinical history and laboratory examinations have been emphasized as very important to the definitive diagnosis, in despite of in some cases it was only established after surgery and histopathologic study.

Dotters-Katz\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Objective. Pyelonephritis is a common infectious morbidity of pregnancy. Though anemia is commonly associated with pyelonephritis, there are little data describing the effect of pyelonephritis with anemia on pregnancy outcomes. The purpose of this study was to further assess the association of anemia with infectious morbidity and pregnancy complications among women with pyelonephritis. Study Design. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women admitted to Duke University Hospital between July 2006 and May 2012 with pyelonephritis. Demographic, laboratory, and clinical data from the subjectâs pregnancy and hospitalizations were analyzed. Patients with pyelonephritis and anemia (a hematocrit < 32 were compared to those without anemia. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the two groups. Results. 114 pregnant women were admitted with pyelonephritis and 45 (39.5% had anemia on admission. There was no significant difference in age, race, preexisting medical conditions, or urine bacterial species between patients with anemia and those without. Women with anemia were more likely to deliver preterm (OR 3.3 (95% CI 1.07, 11.4, . When controlling for race and history of preterm delivery, women with anemia continued to have increased odds of preterm birth (OR 6.0, CI 1.4, 35, . Conclusion. Women with pyelonephritis and anemia are at increased risk for preterm delivery.\n\nEvaluation of reflux nephropathy, pyelonephritis and renal dysplasia\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGrattan-Smith, J.D.

MR urography utilizes multiple parameters to assess both renal anatomy and function and provides a more complete characterization of acquired and congenital disease. Pyelonephritis and renal scarring can be distinguished by assessing the parenchymal contours and signal intensity. Characteristic imaging features of renal dysplasia include small size, subcortical cysts, disorganized architecture, decreased and patchy contrast enhancement as well as a dysmorphic pelvicalyceal system. Because of its ability to subdivide and categorize this heterogeneous group of disorders, it seems inevitable that MR urography will replace DMSA renal scintigraphy as the gold standard for assessment of pyelonephritis and renal scarring.

Women have up to a 10% risk of recurrent acute pyelonephritis in the year following a first acute episode. The equivalent risk in men is 6%. Acute pyelonephritis may be uncomplicated and resolve without serious sequelae. A minority of episodes may be complicated by acute kidney injury, papillary necrosis, renal or perinephric abscess or the development of emphysematous pyelonephritis. Acute pyelonephritis is generally caused by microorganisms ascending from the urethra via the bladder into the upper urinary tract. Rarely the kidney may be seeded by blood-borne infection. Ecoli is the most common uropathogen causing pyelonephritis accounting for 70-90% of infections. Species of Enterococci, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus and Staphylococci are responsible for the remaining infections. There is a rising incidence in the community of UTI with bacteria that produce extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes. These ESBL bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics such as penicillin, cephalosporins and increasingly to quinolones. Risk factors for uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis include recent sexual intercourse, acute cystitis, stress incontinence and diabetes and for complicated acute pyelonephritis include pregnancy, diabetes, anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract and renal calculi.\n\nFOLLOW-UP DATA ON 179 DANISH CHILDREN AFTER THEIR FIRST PYELONEPHRITIS\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBreinbjerg, Anders; Kamperis, Konstantinos; FrÃ¸kjÃ¦r, JÃ¸rgen\n\nIntroduction: Controversy exists regarding follow-up investigations in children diagnosed with their first pyelonephritis.

Greer\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Objective. To measure the incidence of ampicillin-resistant uropathogens in acute antepartum pyelonephritis and to determine if patients with resistant organisms had different clinical outcomes. Study design. This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of pregnant women admitted with pyelonephritis, diagnosed by standard clinical and laboratory criteria. All patients received ampicillin and gentamicin. Results. We identified 440 cases of acute pyelonephritis. Seventy-two percent (316 cases had urine cultures with identification of organism and antibiotic sensitivities. Fifty-one percent of uropathogens were ampicillin resistant. The patients with ampicillin-resistant organisms were more likely to be older and multiparous. There were no significant differences in hospital course (length of stay, days of antibiotics, ECU admission, or readmission. Patients with ampicillin-resistant organisms did not have higher complication rates (anemia, renal dysfunction, respiratory insufficiency, or preterm birth. Conclusion. A majority of uropathogens were ampicillin resistant, but no differences in outcomes were observed in these patients.\n\nXanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: an uncommon pediatric renal mass\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSmith, Ethan A.; Dillman, Jonathan R.

Histologically, XGP is characterized by the presence of chronic inflammation and lipid-laden macrophages. This case report illustrates the radiological, surgical, and pathologic findings in a young patient who presented to our institution for treatment of this uncommon condition. Although rare, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a clinically important entity that can affect pediatric patients. This condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis for an atypical-appearing renal mass.

Zvenigorodska\n\n2013-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The results of the clinical use of StimolÂ® in the comprehensive treatment of acute pyelonephritis in 58 children. It is established that the inclusion of metabolism corrector StimolÂ® in complex of medical treatment of patients with acute pyelonephritis contributes to the stabilization of the clinical condition of patients, reducing symptoms of intoxication (improved appetite, reduced general malaise, normalization of temperature. The findings show the feasibility and clinical efficacy of StimolÂ® administration, which can be regarded as one of the promising methods of detoxification therapy.\n\nThe clinical meaning of oxaluria in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with comorbid chronic pyelonephritis on the background of urolithiasis.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nO. S. Khukhlina\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Aim. To study clinical peculiarities of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with comorbid chronic pyelonephritis on the background of urolithiasis with oxaluria. Materials and methods. 60 patients were included into the study and divided into 3 groups. Study groups: I-st group - 18 patients with isolated course of chronic pyelonephritis (CP and urolithiasis (U of oxalic and mixed genesis, II-nd group - 19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, study group III - 23 patients with COPD, CP and U of oxalic genesis. Additional control group consisted of 20 practically healthy individuals (PHI of corresponding age and gender. Laboratory and clinical examination of the patients was conducted. Spectrophotometry with polarization of biologic material was performed. Statistical analysis was done in Primer of Biostatistics, Origin 8.0. Results. Systemic inflammation in patients with COPD and comorbid CP with oxaluria form the syndrome of mutual burdening. This fact was proved by inverse correlation between oxalate salts in sputum (15,5Â±1,0 mg/24h and reduction of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 in group III. This result was in 2,1 lower than in PHI (r = -0,53,Ñ<0,05. Conclusions. Taking into account data of the anamnesis, patients with COPD, comorbid CP and urolithiasis with oxaluria, had more severe course of COPD than patients with isolated COPD. This can be explained by the oxalic acid crystals deposition in bronchial wall. Stated above clinical characteristics are the features of respiratory oxalosis that needs special treatment.\n\nÐptimization of pharmacotherapy of osteopenia in children with chronic pyelonephritis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nL.A.

Mineral density of bone tissue, biochemical parameters of bone remodeling, cytokine profiles were examined. 3 varients of therapy were used. Control period lasted 12 months. Clinical predictors of osteopenia were indicated. The increased biochemical parameters of bone resorption, IL-6, IL-4, OPG were revealed in chidren with chronic pyelonephritis, the indices were higher in case of osteopenia. The article concluded that the most effective treatment scheme included the use of 3 medicines with different effects\n\nRenal scar formation and kidney function following antibiotic-treated murine pyelonephritis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPatrick D. Olson\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available We present a new preclinical model to study treatment, resolution and sequelae of severe ascending pyelonephritis. Urinary tract infection (UTI, primarily caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC, is a common disease in children. Severe pyelonephritis is the primary cause of acquired renal scarring in childhood, which may eventually lead to hypertension and chronic kidney disease in a small but important fraction of patients. Preclinical modeling of UTI utilizes almost exclusively females, which (in most mouse strains exhibit inherent resistance to severe ascending kidney infection; consequently, no existing preclinical model has assessed the consequences of recovery from pyelonephritis following antibiotic treatment. We recently published a novel mini-surgical bladder inoculation technique, with which male C3H/HeN mice develop robust ascending pyelonephritis, highly prevalent renal abscesses and evidence of fibrosis. Here, we devised and optimized an antibiotic treatment strategy within this male model to more closely reflect the clinical course of pyelonephritis. A 5-day ceftriaxone regimen initiated at the onset of abscess development achieved resolution of bladder and kidney infection. A minority of treated mice displayed persistent histological abscess at the end of treatment, despite microbiological cure of pyelonephritis; a matching fraction of mice 1â month later exhibited renal scars featuring fibrosis and ongoing inflammatory infiltrates. Successful antibiotic treatment preserved renal function in almost all infected mice, as assessed by biochemical markers 1 and 5â months post-treatment; hydronephrosis was observed as a late effect of treated pyelonephritis. An occasional mouse developed chronic kidney disease, generally reflecting the incidence of this late sequela in humans. In total, this model offers a platform to study the molecular pathogenesis of pyelonephritis, response to antibiotic therapy and emergence of sequelae\n\n18F-FDG PET/CT Finding in a Case of Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChoi, Bong Hoi; Hong, Sun Pyo; Yoon, Joon Kee; Pai, Ki Soo; Hong, Jeong; Yim, Hyun Ee\n\n2009-01-01\n\nXanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an uncommon chronic renal infection, which is usually found on middle-aged women and is rare in infant. Sometimes it forms focal mass like lesion of kidney with pathologically characteristic lipid-laden macrophage. A 1-month female infant was admitted for fever and moaning sound. On work-up of urinary tract infection, abdomen ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a large mass on the upper portion of right kidney and PET/CT showed homogeneously increased 18 F-FDG uptake. The radical nephrectomy of right kidney was performed and histology revealed a focal xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. To our knowledge, this is the first report presenting the finding of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in the childhood xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis\n\nRational use of CT in acute pyelonephritis: findings and relationships with reflux\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDacher, J.N.; Boillot, B.; Eurin, D.; Marguet, C.; Mitrofanoff, P.; Le Dosseur, P.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nEnhanced renal CT scanners were performed in 38 children (82% girls) to rule out acute pyelonephritis. Patients were divided in 2 groups on the basis of clinical presentation and bacteriology data. In patients of group A (n = 16, preliminary study), upper urinary tract infection (UTI) was certain. CT confirmed the diagnosis in all but 3 patients (a 2-year-old child and 2 patients with UTI developed on prior obstruction). In subsequently studied patients of group B (n = 22), clinical findings or bacteriology data were negative or questionable. CT made the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in 11 patients. As well as DMSA scintigraphy, CT scanner can help to diagnose or to rule out upper UTIs in difficult cases. In all boys of both groups, ipsilateral vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) was found by subsequent voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) on the side of pyelonephritis. In girls, this correlation was shown in only 7 of the 25 kidneys with pyelonephritis. This result supports the hypothesis of a gender-dependent contamination. We believe that absence of radiologic reflux cannot exclude the possibility of bacterial crossings of ureteric meatus capable to lead to genuine upper UTIs.

Determination of intensity of film-formation was carried out by staining of the formed biofilms by crystal violet with consequent extraction of the dye and measurement of its concentration in washout solution. Among causative agents ofpyelonephritis P. aeruginosa isolates had the maximum film-forming ability. The intensity of biofilm formation of these isolates was 2-3 time higher than staphylococcus and enterobacteria strains. Strains isolated from patients with chronic pyelonephritis by ability to form biofilms significantly surpassed strains isolated from acute pyelonephritis patients. A higher ability to form microbial biofilms for microorganisms--causative agents of pyelonephritis progressing against the background ofurolithiasis was noted. The ability to form biofilms is determined by both causative agent species and character of the infectious process in which this microorganism participates. Intensive formation of biofilms by E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus clinical isolates may be an important factor of chronization of urinary tract infections.\n\nXanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis Can Simulate a Complex Cyst: Case Description and Review of Literature\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSalvatore ButticÃ¨\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare and peculiar form of chronic pyelonephritis and is generally associated with renal lithiasis. Its incidence is higher in females. The peculiarity of this disease is that it requires a differential diagnosis, because it can often simulate dramatic pathologic conditions. In fact, in the literature are also described cases in association with squamous cell carcinoma of the kidney The radiologic clinical findings simulate renal masses, sometimes in association with caval thrombus. We describe a case of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis with radiologic aspects of a complex cyst of Bosniak class III in a man 40-year old.\n\nEmphysematous and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: rare diagnosis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLya Duarte Ramos\n\nFull Text Available Pyelonephritis is a pyogenic infection of renal parenchyma that involves the renal pelvis. It is generally of easy diagnosis. The present case report aims to describe two different manifestations of this infection: xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis and emphysematous pyelonephritis, which have poor prognosis and require a more effective treatment. The two cases were women in the fiftieth and sixtieth decade of life, with diabetes mellitus and history of weight loss. The diagnosis of the renal infection was established through computed tomography and the treatment was based in surgical procedure, with favorable outcome.\n\nPyelonephritis, renal scarring, and reflux nephropathy: a pediatric urologist's perspective\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSmith, Edwin A.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nImaging of children with a clinical diagnosis of pyelonephritis is performed to characterize the extent of the infection, to identify associated renal injury and to uncover risk factors for future infections and renal damage. Although there is general agreement regarding the need for parenchymal imaging and the need to exclude processes that are either functionally or anatomically obstructive, there is controversy regarding the need for routine cystography, especially when parenchymal involvement has not been documented. A protocol that limits the use of cystography for evaluation of urinary tract infections must assume that the diagnosis of reflux is at least of variable clinical significance. It is now clear that vesicoureteral reflux and reflux nephropathy represent a diverse population that includes both congenital and acquired processes. MR imaging will improve our understanding of vesicoureteral reflux, pyelonephritis and renal scarring and might help us to identify and manage those patients most at risk for recurrent infections and renal injury. To recognize the potential contributions of this newer imaging technique it is helpful to look at our understanding of the pathophysiology of pyelonephritis, reflux and reflux nephropathy.

It compromises the renal parenchyma, collecting system, perirenal space or retro peritoneal. The clinical presentation is usually not correlated with the severity of infection and the images, mainly the scan images, play an important role in diagnosis and classification to define management. The treatment of this disease has traditionally been aggressive and was considered essential percutaneous catheter drainage and / or nephrectomy.\n\n{sup 18}F-FDG PET/CT Finding in a Case of Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nChoi, Bong Hoi; Hong, Sun Pyo; Yoon, Joon Kee; Pai, Ki Soo; Hong, Jeong; Yim, Hyun Ee [Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2009-04-15\n\nXanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an uncommon chronic renal infection, which is usually found on middle-aged women and is rare in infant. Sometimes it forms focal mass like lesion of kidney with pathologically characteristic lipid-laden macrophage. A 1-month female infant was admitted for fever and moaning sound. On work-up of urinary tract infection, abdomen ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a large mass on the upper portion of right kidney and PET/CT showed homogeneously increased {sup 18}F-FDG uptake. The radical nephrectomy of right kidney was performed and histology revealed a focal xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.

Samples of urine and blood are obtained and used for cultures as part of the diagnosis and management of the condition. Acute pyelonephritis requires hospitalisation with intravenous administration of antimicrobial agents. Several studies have questioned the necessity of obtaining blood cultures in addition to urine cultures, citing cost and questioning whether blood testing is superfluous. Pregnant women with bacteraemia require a change in the initial empirical treatment based on the blood culture. However, these cases are not common, and represent approximately 15% to 20% of cases. It is unclear whether blood cultures are essential for the effective management of the condition. To assess the effectiveness of routine blood cultures to improve health outcomes in the management of pyelonephritis in pregnant women. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register without language or date restrictions (31 December 2014). Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials comparing outcomes among pregnant women with pyelonephritis who received initial management with or without blood cultures. Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion in this review but none were identified. Clinical trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed one trial report for inclusion. We identified one trial report but this was excluded. No clinical trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. There are no large-scale randomised controlled trials to assess outcomes in the management of pyelonephritis in pregnancy with or without blood cultures. Randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of managing pyelonephritis in pregnant women with or without\n\nRole of Conservative Management in Emphysematous Pyelonephritis - A Retrospective Study\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nIrom, Keshorjit Singh; Khumallambam, Ibomcha Singh; Sinam, Rajendra Singh\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntroduction Emphysematous pyelophritis (EPN) is a serious condition with significant mortality. The prognosis of patients with EPN has changed over the years. Mortality has declined with prompt and aggressive medical management and minimally invasive strategies. Aim To identify the prognostic factors and assess the outcome of conservative management of emphysematous pyelonephritis. Settings and Design This was a retrospective study of 8 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with EPN in two medical institutes between July 2010 and June 2015. Materials and Methods Eight consecutive patients diagnosed with emphysematous pyelonephritis between July 2010 and June 2015 was studied retrospectively. On the basis of Computerised tomographic scan findings they were grouped into four classes (1 to 4) according the modified classification recommended by Huang and Tseng. The management was conservative (combination of percutaneous drainage and antibiotics), immediate nephrectomy or delayed nephrectomy (when conservative management failed). Demographic, clinical, biochemical and radiological characteristics were assessed and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Results Seven (87.5%) of a total of 8 patients had diabetes mellitus. Escherichia coli (71.4 %) was the most common offending pathogen identified in pus culture. With conservative management in 7 patients (combination of percutaneous drainage and antibiotics), treatment was successful in 57.14 % and with immediate nephrectomy (one patient), the success rate was 100%. The risk factors for mortality were thrombocytopenia, shock and altered sensorium at presentation. The mortality rate in class 1, 2 and 3 was 0%, 33.3% and 66.7%. None of the patient had class 4 EPN. Conclusion A combination of percutaneous drainage with antibiotics offers an effective therapy for emphysematous pyelonephritis.

Qualitative and quantitative evaluation standards were elaborated to improve the interpretation of DMSA scintigraphy. The normal DMSA distribution pattern, the average background uptake, and scintigraphic kidney length according to age were assessed in 95 presumably healthy kidneys. Furthermore, typical DMSA distribution patterns in acute pyelonephritis were assessed on 65 kidneys in 38 children, and typical DMSA distribution patterns of 152 kidneys with VUR in 101 children with and without previous pyelonephritis. Measurement of scintigraphic kidney length, width and volume was validated in piglets and on a kidney phantom. The scintigraphic kidney length was found to be an accurate measure of renal size, whereas kidney width and volume were less reliable, at least on small kidneys. Criteria of kidney swelling in acute pyelonephritis were defined, and found to be beneficial for identifying reinfections in the absence of clinical symptoms. In 34 children with acute pyelonephritis quantitative and qualitative DMSA scintigraphic findings were correlated to clinical symptoms and laboratory data, in the acute stage and at follow up. We found that quantitative DMSA scintigraphy in the acute stage of pyelonephritis and again after one year will identify children who are at risk of developing progressive renal lesions. Qualitative assessment of DMSA distribution pattern is not reliable enough in this respect. 116 refs., 7 figs\n\nClinical utility of FDG PET/CT in acute complicated pyelonephritis - results from an observational study\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWan, Chih-Hsing [Mackay Memorial Hospital at Taipei, Department of Nuclear Medicine, Taipei (China); Tseng, Jing-Ren; Yen, Tzu-Chen [Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Department of Nuclear Medicine and Center for Advanced Molecular Imaging and Translation, Taoyuan (China); Chang Gung University, Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Science, College of Medicine, Taoyuan (China); Lee, Ming-Hsun [Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Taoyuan (China); Yang, Lan-Yan [Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Biostatistics Unit, Clinical Trial Center, Taoyuan (China)\n\n2018-03-15\n\nAcute complicated pyelonephritis (ACP) is an upper urinary tract infection associated with coexisting urinary tract abnormalities or medical conditions that could predispose to serious outcomes or treatment failures. Although CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are frequently used in patients with ACP, the clinical value of {sup 18}F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) has not been systematically investigated. This single-center retrospective study was designed to evaluate the potential usefulness of FDG PET/CT in patients with ACP. Thirty-one adult patients with ACP who underwent FDG PET/CT were examined. FDG PET/CT imaging characteristics, including tracer uptake patterns, kidney volumes, and extrarenal imaging findings, were reviewed in combination with clinical data and conventional imaging results. Of the 31 patients, 19 (61%) showed focal FDG uptake. The remaining 12 study participants showed a diffuse FDG uptake pattern. After volumetric approximation, the affected kidneys were found to be significantly enlarged. Patients who showed a focal uptake pattern had a higher frequency of abscess formation requiring drainage. ACP patients showing diffuse tracer uptake patterns had a more benign clinical course. Seven patients had suspected extrarenal coinfections, and FDG PET/CT successfully confirmed the clinical suspicion in five cases. FDG PET/CT was as sensitive as CT in identifying the six patients (19%) who developed abscesses. Notably, FDG PET/CT findings caused a modification to the initial antibiotic regimen in nine patients (29%). FDG PET/CT may be clinically useful in the assessment of patients with ACP who have a progressive disease course.

Nine month old girl was admitted to hospital in heavy clinical status due to pyelonephritis--urosepsis. It was complicated by acute renal insufficiency. Patient was treated by broad-spectrum antibiotics and parenteral nutrition. She was feverish for 14 days. Computed tomography done in order to exclude abdominal abscess showed massive renal tissue necrosis of on both sides. Antibiotic treatment was successful after 6 weeks. Urological evaluation revealed bilateral vesico-ureteral refluxes grade IV. Scintigraphy showed multiple scars. Patient was treated Deflux injections (twice). We noted 5 urinary tract recurrences despite antibiotic profilaxis. GFR of 75 ml/min/1.73 m2 was estimated at age of 16 m.

There are few cases in the literature which describe the disease in children. Its pathogenesis remains unknown, although in up to 76% of cases it has been related to lithiasic obstruction of the pyeloureteral junction. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis are most often cited as being the causing bacteria. Since neither its clinical characteristics nor radiological manifestations are specific, it is frequently infra diagnosed, Its definitive diagnosis is anatomophatological, and it is treated by nephrectomy. We present the case of a child with poorly evolving pyonephrosis diagnosed after the anatomopathological study of a renal sample. Special not is made of the importance of performing a preoperative diagnosis, and including such in a differential diagnosis with slowly evolving infectious/obstructive processes.

CASE REPORT: A 37-year old patient presented a chronic history of lumbar pain and thoracic symptoms such as cough, dyspnea and oral elimination of pus. Patient went to several services and was submitted to 2 thorax surgeries before definitive treatment (nephrectomy was indicated. After nephrectomy, the patient presented an immediate improvement with weight gain (8 kg / 1 month and all his symptoms disappeared.

This study was performed to evaluate capabilities of color/doppler sonography to detect pyelonephritis and to predict scarring when compared with 99m Tc-DMSA scintigraphy. Fifty-seven children were evaluated during pyelonephritis: biology (CRP, creatinine, blood formula), color/power doppler sonography and 99m Tc-DMSA scintigraphy (DMSA1). 7 Â± 2 months later, follow-up consisted in biological tests and a 99m 'Tc-DMSA scintigraphy (DMSA2). During pyelonephritis, body temperature, CRP value and neutrophil counts were significantly higher in patients with an abnormal DMSA1 but not in patients with abnormal doppler sonography. When compared with DMSA1, doppler sonography sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 81% respectively. DMSA1 and doppler sonography were concordant in 86% of children with a pyelonephritis. At follow-up, all clinical et biological parameters were normalized. DMSA2 was abnormal in 51% of children. When compared with DMSA2, positive and negative predictive values for scarring of doppler sonography were 57% and 75% respectively. DMSA 1, positive and negative predictive values for scarring were 62% and 100%. In conclusion, color/power doppler sonography is a reliable tool for pyelonephritis diagnosis, but its predictive value for scarring is poor. Negative predictive value of DMSA scintigraphy is excellent.

Methods: A series of 42 patients presenting with obstructive pyelonephritis due to proximal ureteral stones larger than 1.5 cm were included from April 2006 to February 2015 in this comparative study. After drainage of pyonephrosis and resolution of sepsis, 22 patients treated with TPLU (Group I), and 20 patients were treated with F-URS (Group II). Preoperative patient and stone characteristics, procedure-related parameters and clinical outcomes were assessed for each group. Results: It was seen that both methods were effective in the treatment of large proximal ureteral stones. However TPLU provided a higher stone- free rate (100% vs 80%. p=0.043) and lower retreatment rate. There was no difference between the groups for the operative time and complication rate. On the other hand, patients treated with F-URS had less postoperative pain (p=0.008), a shorter hospital stay (p<0.001) and a faster return to daily activities (p<0.001). Conclusions: The results of our study show that both F-URS and TPLU are safe and effective surgical procedures for treatment of large proximal ureteral stones after controlling obstructive pyelonephritis. However, TPLU has a higher stone-free rate with comparable operating time and complication rate as compared to F-URS. On the other hand F-URS has the advantages of less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and faster return to daily activities.

Her temperature was 103Â°F, but the remainder of her vital signs were normal. Upon physical examination, the patient had tenderness to palpation in the left upper and left lower abdomen and left costovertebral angle tenderness. Due to the location of pain (diverticulitis is in the differential for left-sided abdominal pain in this age group and patientâs reported history of nephrolithiasis, a computed tomography (CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV contrast was ordered because the physician felt this could best work up both of these possible conditions. Significant findings: A CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast showed neither nephrolithiasis nor diverticulitis, and instead showed heterogeneous enhancement of the left kidney with mild edematous enlargement and striated left nephrogram. Significant perinephric stranding (red arrows was also noted and was consistent with severe acute pyelonephritis. Discussion: Acute pyelonephritis (APN is a bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma which can present with a spectrum of symptoms including flank pain, high-grade fever, vomiting, and urinary tract symptoms.1,2 The diagnosis of APN can be made based on these clinical features with associated laboratory findings of bacteriuria, pyuria, positive urine cultures, and leukocytosis.1,2,7 Early diagnosis and treatment of APN is essential to prevent complications such as renal abscess or infarct, which could lead to renal failure, sepsis, and shock.3 CT has a sensitivity and specificity of 86.8% and 87.5%, respectively, for diagnosing APN. Common findings include striated nephrograms or perinephric fat stranding.2 However, imaging is not required for diagnosis and is typically reserved for patients who are immunocompromised, have severe symptoms, or show no clinical\n\nAcute antepartum pyelonephritis in pregnancy: a critical analysis of risk factors and outcomes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFarkash, Evelina; Weintraub, Adi Y; Sergienko, Ruslan; Wiznitzer, Arnon; Zlotnik, Alex; Sheiner, Eyal\n\n2012-05-01\n\nTo test the incidence and sonographic parameters of pyelonephritis during pregnancy, and to examine risk factors and pregnancy outcomes of women with acute antepartum pyelonephritis. A retrospective population-based study comparing all singleton pregnancies of patients with and without acute antepartum pyelonephritis was performed. Patients lacking prenatal care as well as multiple gestations were excluded from the study. Multiple logistic regression models were used to control for confounders. Out of 219,612 singleton deliveries in 1988-2010, 165 women (0.07%) suffered from acute antepartum pyelonephritis. Abnormal sonographic findings were found in 85.7% of the patients with pyelonephritis. Pyelonephritis was significantly associated with nulliparity (46.1% vs. 24.4%, pUTI) (4.2% vs. 0.4%, pUTI (OR 10.3; 95% C.I 4.8-22.1; p<0.001) and younger maternal age (OR 0.96; 95% C.I 0.93-0.99; p=0.009). Using another multivariable analysis, with preterm delivery as the outcome variable, acute antepartum pyelonephritis was found as an independent risk factor for preterm delivery (OR 2.6; 95% C.I 1.7-3.9; p<0.001). Acute antepartum pyelonephritis is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes and specifically is an independent risk factor for preterm delivery. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To prevent recurrent pyelonephritis and renal damage, prophylaxis is extremely important. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of probiotic and antibiotic prophylaxis or no-prophylaxis in infants with pyelonephritis and normal urinary tract. Altogether 191 infants, who were diagnosed with acute pyelonephritis, proven to have normal urinary tracts and followed up for 6 months on prophylaxis, were retrospectively evaluated. According to the types of prophylaxis, the infants were divided into three groups [probiotics (Lactobacillus species), antibiotics (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, TMP/SMX), and noprophylaxis]. The incidence of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) during 6 months after the development of pyelonephritis, main causative uropathogens, and its antimicrobial sensitivities were compared. The incidence of recurrent UTI in the probiotic group was 8.2%, which was significantly lower than 20.6% in the no-prophylaxis group (P=0.035) and was not significantly different from 10.0% of the antibiotic group (P=0.532). The significant difference between the probiotic and no-prophylaxis groups was seen only in male infants (P=0.032). The main causative organism of recurrent UTI was Escherichia coli (E.coli), which was not different among the three groups (P=0.305). The resistance rate of E. coli to TMP/SMX was 100% in the antibiotic group, which was significantly higher than 25.0% in the probiotic group and 41.7% in the no-prophylaxis group (P=0.008). Probiotic prophylaxis was more effective in infants with pyelonephritis and normal urinary tract than in those with no-prophylaxis. It could be used as a natural alternative to antibiotic prophylaxis.\n\nScreening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy prevent pyelonephritis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGratacÃ³s, E; Torres, P J; Vila, J; Alonso, P L; Cararach, V\n\n1994-06-01\n\nAlthough asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of developing pyelonephritis, the effectiveness of screening programs to reduce this risk is controversial. A sharp reduction in the annual incidence of pyelonephritis (1.8% to 0.6%, P asymptomatic bacteriuria among pregnant women followed at a large teaching hospital. The data provide retrospective and prospective evidence that screening and treatment programs for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy reduce the risk of pyelonephritis in a population with a moderate to high prevalence of bacteriuria.\n\nSevere renal failure in acute bacterial pyelonephritis: Do not forget corticosteroids\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSqalli Tarik\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Acute renal failure (ARF is a rare complication of acute pyelonephritis in adult immunocompetent patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of procalcitonin (PCT as a reliable marker for distinguishing urinary tract infection (UTI with or without renal parenchyma (cystitis. Materials and Methods: Eighty children, who were suspicious of having UTI and had been referred to Ali Ibne Abitaleb hospital (in Zahedan or pediatric clinics (June 2007- Oct 2009 were included in the study after their urine culture revealed their infection. Besides, their clinical and lab symptoms including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, Câ reactive protein (CRP, serum WBC, and serum procalcitonin (PCT were recorded. The patients were divided into two groups based on their lab clinical symptoms and radio-isotope scans, namely acute pyelonephritis and acute cystitis (lower UTI. Serum procalcitonin was measured in these cases in a semi-quantitative manner. Results: Fifty children with mean age of 4.89Â±3.50 years were compared with 30 children with mean age of 5.20Â±3.07 years. ESR, WBC, and PCT were significantly higher in patients with upper UTI (P<0.001 , but CRP was not significantly different in the two groups. PCT, which was semi-quantitatively measured, when lower than 0.5 had a relationship with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative value of 72%, 83.3%, 87.8%, and 64.1% respectively. When PCT was more than 2, the relationship with the mentioned features was 50%, 96.6%, 96.2%, and 53.7%, respectively. The relationships in these two domains can both be assistant in differentiating pyelonephritis from cystitis. Conclusion: PCT was more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of upper versus lower UTI compared with CRP, and it can be a better marker than CRP for early prediction of febrile pyelonephritis in children.\n\nThe Peripheral Whole Blood Transcriptome of Acute Pyelonephritis in Human Pregnancy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMadan, Ichchha; Than, Nandor Gabor; Romero, Roberto; Chaemsaithong, Piya; Miranda, Jezid; Tarca, Adi L.; Bhatti, Gaurav; Draghici, Sorin; Yeo, Lami; Mazor, Moshe; Hassan, Sonia S.; Chaiworapongsa, Tinnakorn\n\n2018-01-01\n\nObjective Human pregnancy is characterized by activation of the innate immune response and suppression of adaptive immunity. The former is thought to provide protection against infection to the mother, and the latter, tolerance against paternal antigens expressed in fetal cells. Acute pyelonephritis is associated with an increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis in pregnant (vs. nonpregnant) women. The objective of this study was to describe the gene expression profile (transcriptome) of maternal whole blood in acute pyelonephritis. Method A case-control study was conducted to include pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis (n=15) and women with a normal pregnancy (n=34). Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used for gene expression profiling. A linear model was used to test the association between the presence of pyelonephritis and gene expression levels while controlling for white blood cell count and gestational age. A fold change of 1.5 was considered significant at a false discovery rate of 0.1. A subset of differentially expressed genes (n=56) was tested with real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (cases, n=19; controls, n=59). Gene ontology and pathway analysis were applied. Results A total of 983 genes were differentially expressed in acute pyelonephritis: 457 were up-regulated and 526 were down-regulated. Significant enrichment of 300 biological processes and 63 molecular functions was found in pyelonephritis. Significantly impacted pathways in pyelonephritis included a) cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction; b) T-cell receptor signaling; c) Jak-STAT signaling; and d) complement and coagulation cascades. Of 56 genes tested by qRT-PCR, 48 (85.7%) had confirmation of differential expression. Conclusion This is the first study of the transcriptomic signature of whole blood in pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis.

It is presented with fever, shaking chills and flank pain. Intravenous hydration and antimicrobial therapy are sufficient in the treatment unless pyelonephritis is complicated. In case of fever persisting for more than 48 h despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment, a possible complication such as urinary tract obstruction, abscess or phlegmon should be considered. Here, we present an 18-year-old pregnant woman with acute pyelonephritis whose persistent fever returned to normal after double-J ureteral stent was placed even if she had no finding of such a complication.\n\n[Etiology of acute and chronic pyelonephritis in children in Khabarovsk region].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKozlova, E A; Kholodok, G N; Alekseeva, I N; Kozlov, V K\n\n2008-01-01\n\nMicroflora of urinary tract was studied in 419 children aged 1 - 17 years and hospitalized due to acute or chronic pyelonephritis. Etiology of inflammatory process was established in 57.8% of cases. According to our study, etiologic structure of causative agents of pyelonephritis did not differ from all-Russian data. The leading positions belonged to Gram-negative microorganisms from Enterobacteriaceae family: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella spp. Results of the study point to high susceptibility of main causative agents of pyelonephritis to cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. High resistance to aminopenicillines was noted. In several isolates from Enterobacteriaceae family significant resistance to nalidixic acid and furazidin was observed.\n\nChronic pyelonephritis as false interpretation in the excretory urogram\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRieden, K.; Weber, M.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nChronic pyelonephritis, which is largely diagnosed via imaging procedures, is characterised by defined parenchymal scars that become manifest in the excretory urogram as contour recessions of the kidney and result in deformations of the calyces and papillae.

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP is an infectious disease with a potential for fistulization to lung, skin, colon and other organs. We present a case of nephrolithiasis complicated by obstruction leading to pyonephrosis and nephrobronchial fistula, treated successfully by nephrectomy and excision of fistulous tracts. Nephrobronchial fistula, although a rare complication of longstanding renal stone, should be considered when a patient presents with perirenal suppurative process. This clinical case illustrates the natural history of nephro-bronchial fistula and the relevance of early treatment of nephrolithiasis.\n\nXanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis in adults: clinical and radiological findings in diffuse and focal forms\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLoffroy, R.; Guiu, B.; Watfa, J.; Michel, F.; Cercueil, J.P.; Krause, D.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAim: To describe the clinical and radiological features of focal and diffuse xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) in adults. Materials and methods: A retrospective review of the clinical data, laboratory findings, imaging features, and surgical treatment of 13 cases of histologically proven XGP diagnosed between January 1993 and December 2005 was undertaken. There were 10 women and three men with a mean age of 55.2 years (range 30-87 years). All patients underwent both sonography and computed tomography (CT) of the kidneys. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in two patients. Results: XGP was diffuse in 11 patients and focal in two patients. Fever, anorexia and weight loss, urinary symptoms, and flank pain were the most common manifestations. Urinary tract infection was found in eight patients. Sonography and CT showed diffuse kidney enlargement in seven cases and atrophy in five cases; a solitary solid mass was found in two patients. Hydronephrosis was noted in nine cases, staghorn calculus in six, and extensive pararenal disease in six. MRI failed to provide the preoperative diagnosis in the two patients with focal XGP.

Tc-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy is the imaging modality of choice for the detection of acute pyelonephhfis and renal scarfing. This study evaluated the importance of renal cortical scintigraphy to identify children at risk from renal damage due to acute pyelonephritis. Methods: Forty-nine children (ages 9 months to 11 years) with urinary tract infection having positive urine culture were studied. A DMSA scan was performed within 72 hours of receiving antibiotic during acute infection. Single or multiple areas of varying degrees of diminished cortical uptake or diffusely decreased uptake in an enlarged kidney was considered for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephrifis. Follow-up scintigraphy was done at 6 months of initial scan in children with acute pyelonephritis documented by DMSA scan. Renal scarring was considered if the affected kidney shows cortical thinning or focal cortical defect with loss of volume or become small kidney. Children with known renal tract abnormalities were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Twenty-seven children (55%) wine considered acute pyelonephritis by DMSA scintigraphy and the abnormality was bilateral in 17(63%) cases and unilateral in 10(37%) cases. Among these 44 abnormal kidneys, scintigraphy showed solitary defect in 29 kidneys, multiple defects in 6 kidneys and diffuse decreased uptake in 9 kidneys. Of them, twenty children were available for follow-up evaluation and scintigraphy demonstrated complete recovery in 21 of 34 (62%) kidneys and renal scarfing in 13 of 34 (38%) kidneys. Renal scarring was found in 5 of 7 kidneys (71%) with diffuse decreased uptake, 2 of 5 kidneys (40%) with multiple cortical defect and 6 of 22 (27%) with single focal detect.

No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment. This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.\n\nCharacterization of subclinical bacteriuria, bacterial cystitis, and pyelonephritis in dogs with chronic kidney disease.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFoster, Jonathan D; Krishnan, Harathi; Cole, Stephen\n\n2018-05-15\n\nOBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of bacteriuria (ie, a positive microbial culture result for â¥ 1 urine sample) in dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and characterize findings of subclinical bacteriuria (SBU), bacterial cystitis, or pyelonephritis in these patients. DESIGN Retrospective, observational study. ANIMALS 182 dogs. PROCEDURES Medical records from January 2010 through July 2015 were reviewed to identify dogs with CKD that underwent urinalysis and urine microbial culture. Signalment, clinicopathologic data, stage of CKD according to previously published guidelines, results of urinalysis and urine culture, and abdominal ultrasonographic findings were recorded. Dogs with positive urine culture results were categorized as having SBU, bacterial cystitis, or pyelonephritis on the basis of these data. Prevalence of bacteriuria was calculated. Associations between CKD stage, presence of bacteriuria, and diagnosis category were analyzed statistically. RESULTS 33 of 182 (18.1%) dogs (40/235 [17.0%] urine samples) had positive culture results. All dogs received antimicrobials on the basis of culture and susceptibility test findings. Most positive culture results (18/40 [45%] samples) were found for dogs with SBU, followed by dogs with pyelonephritis (16/40 [40%]) and cystitis (6/40 [15%]). Escherichia coli was the most frequently observed isolate (29/40 [73%] cultures from 25/33 dogs). The CKD stage was not associated with presence of bacteriuria or diagnosis category. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The prevalence of positive urine culture results in dogs with CKD was lower than that reported for dogs with some systemic diseases that may predispose to infection. Prospective research is needed to assess the clinical importance of SBU in dogs with CKD.\n\nSeptic liver - Clinical relevance of early inhomogeneous enhancement of the liver in patients with acute pyelonephritis\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHan, Ga Jin; Lee, Nam Kyung; Kim, Suk [Dept. of Radiology, Biomedical Research Inst., Pusan National Univ.

These findings may cause radiologists and clinicians to misrecognize hepatobiliary diseases and initiate an inappropriate treatment. Thus, it is important to recognize hepatobiliary CT findings in cases of extrahepatobiliary infectious disease. Purpose: To evaluate extrarenal CT manifestations in patients with acute pyelonephritis and to determine the correlation between these extrarenal CT findings and septic liver based on laboratory parameters of sepsis. Material and Methods: This study included 157 retrospectively identified patients with confirmed acute pyelonephritis based on CT imaging and urine test, and who had also undergone multi-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced CT scan. Two radiologists reviewed CT findings including early inhomogeneous enhancement of the liver, periportal low density and gallbladder edema, which were correlated with laboratory data including liver function enzymes, albumin, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and results of a blood culture by using the Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Forty-six patients (29.3%) showed early inhomogeneous enhancement of the liver, which was associated with increased C-reactive protein (P < 0.001), a positive blood culture (P < 0.005), and decreased albumin level (P < 0.002). The periportal low density and gallbladder wall edema were noted in 15 patients (9.6%) and six patients (3.8%), respectively.

D. Kaprin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract:Acute pyelonephritis is one of the common diseases both in outpatient and in the hospital practice. The leading causative agent of this disease is E. coli. Obstructive uropathy, foreign body, vesicoureteral reflux, sexual activity, use of local contraceptives contribute to the upward development of urinary infection. The goals of antimicrobial therapy for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are: relief of symptoms, restoration of social activity, prevention of complications and relapse prevention. The choice of an antimicrobial agent in most cases is carried out empirically based on the data on the dominant pathogens and their regional resistance. In acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis duration of antimicrobial therapy should be 7â14 days. The drugs of choice for treatment of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis non-severe in adults are ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, ceftibuten and cefixime. Patients with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis severe emergency hospitalization is shown in urological outpatient and parenteral antimicrobial therapy (carbapenems or protected aminopenicillins combined with or without amikacin with subsequent conversion to oral drugs and infusion therapy.\n\nFebrile urinary tract infections: pyelonephritis and urosepsis\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSchneeberger, Caroline; Holleman, Frits; Geerlings, Suzanne E.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nComplicated infections of the urinary tract (UTI) including pyelonephritis and urosepsis are also called febrile UTI.

Ten cases of nine patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis were percutaneously drained. All were suffering from diabetes mellitus. The procedure was performed under fluoroscopic guidance in nine cases and US guidance in one case in which bilateral multiloculated abscesses were present in the perirenal space. The results were classified as cure, partial success, recurrence, or failure. The mean drainage period and complication were analyzed. Eight cases were cured, and there was one case success. In one case, who had diffuse renal parenchymal destruction without perirenal fluid collection, the treatment failed. The longest drainage period was 45 days, in a case of re-insertion due to incidental catheter removal; the mean was 23 days. Bacteremia in one case was cured with antibiotic therapy which lasted two days. In diabetic patients, percutaneous drainage of obscess is thought to be a safe and effective method for the treatment of emphysematous pyelonephritis, and is one that does not involve diffuse destruction of renal parenchyma\n\nEmphysematous Pyelonephritis Presenting as Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Leg\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYu-Xiong Ye\n\n2009-03-01\n\nFull Text Available We report a 50-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus who presented with a painful, swollen right leg.

There are few cases in the literature which describe the disease in children. Its pathogenesis remains unknown, although in up to 76% of cases it has been related to lithiasic obstruction of the pyeloureteral junction. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis are most often cited as being the causing bacteria. Since neither its clinical characteristics nor radiological manifestations are specific, it is frequently infra diagnosed, Its definitive diagnosis is anatomophatological, and it is treated by nephrectomy. We present the case of a child with poorly evolving pyonephrosis diagnosed after the anatomopathological study of a renal sample.
