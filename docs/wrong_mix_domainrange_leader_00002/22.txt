Jelle’s Zodiac Sign As Per Western Astrology

Western astrology includes the construction of a horoscope based on the person’s exact time of birth and location to understand the positions of the planet, stars, and zodiac signs at that time. However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.

Zodiac sign or Sun sign

The Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.

Each zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.

To know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below. This will give you a glimpse into the world of astrology tailored for your baby.

Celebrity NumerologistAuthor

The name you give a child at birth is like their numerological DNA - it is a blueprint of who they are, their talents and character traits, their likes and dislikes, and much more. So choose carefully and, if possible, consider an ancestral name, especially one that belonged to an ancestor who did well and lived a good life. But consult a numerologist for more insight and perhaps a little fine-tuning by changing a letter or adding a middle name.
