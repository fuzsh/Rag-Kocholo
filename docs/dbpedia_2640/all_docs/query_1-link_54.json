        "text": "Contrary to popular belief, authors enjoyed a derivative work right before the 1976 Copyright Act. Just as society's conception of substantial copying infringement has advanced over the years, society's conception of the scope of the derivative work right should also advance into a more workable legal doctrine. The policy of the Copyright Act is to maximize all prospective authors' incentives to create new works and share them with the public. Pursuant to this policy, this article advocates that the exclusive derivative work right should be deleted from the Copyright Act, because the derivative work right already subsists in the rest of authors' enumerated rights. It further argues that courts should carefully consider the appropriate remedies for derivative work infringement, concluding that injunctive relief for infringement is inappropriate when a derivative author has contributed substantial new creativity relative to the portion of the preexisting work infringed.\n\nThis Article suggests a path to develop a principled conceptualization for copyright of limitations and exceptions at the international level. The paper argues that, normatively, copyright has always sought to reflect a balance between protection and access. It demonstrates that this balance was present to the minds of the negotiators of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and may have been somewhat overlooked in revisions of the Convention. It was ultimately replaced by a three-step test designed to restrict the ability of individual legislators to create limitations and exceptions. The article also considers the conflicts between copyright and rights such as the right to privacy, human rights principles of free expression and cultural diversity, the right to information, the right to education, and the nascent right to development, all of which imply striking a balance in intellectual property protection. The article begins with a historical look at the public interest foundations of the Berne Convention and its revisions until 1971. The article then proceeds to a conceptualization of limitations and exceptions in order to show the policy linkages of each type of exception and proposes a set of principles for limitations and exceptions. The article also examines the meaning and impact of the three-step test because it would be pointless, not theoretically, but from a policy perspective, to ignore the application of the test in suggesting international principles for limitations and exceptions.\n\nThis chapter begins by examining the rights granted exclusively to authors—moral rights and artist’s resale right. It discusses ‘moral rights’ first, that is, the right to be identified as the author of the protected work, and to have that work’s integrity respected by others, followed by the artist’s resale right. The rest of this chapter discusses fundamental rules and controls on exploitation and use of copyright. This includes dealings in copyright, such as assignment and licensing; specific features of copyright exploitation, for example collective licensing; and also contemporary issues related to the use of copyright works, for example the challenge of orphan works for users, and the application of technological protection measures by right owners to prevent unauthorised use of or access to protected works.\n\nThe 1991 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc. delivered was hailed both as a landmark decision and a legal bomb. Was Feist so original as to deserve all the attention? After all, it did not establish a new originality paradigm as such but only ended a long division among federal circuits concerning the protection under copyright of factual compilations. A number of circuits had adopted a test similar to the one articulated in Feist (i.e., based on creative selection), while others required only evidence of labor, a test known as sweat of the brow. In reality, Feist did much more than resolve a definitional tension: it determined that there was a constitutional requirement of creativity. According to the U.S. database industry, the sky had fallen: factual compilations would no longer be protected and without adequate protection, investments necessary for the creation and maintenance of databases would dry up. That did not happen, even though debates concerning a federal tort of misappropriation continue. The purpose of this article is not to analyze whether Feist was correctly decided, but rather to show that a Feist like standard is now applied or may soon emerge in key common law countries. Moreover, in a move that may bridge the gap between the two major systems of copyright, we will demonstrate that civil law systems have also adopted a similar doctrine.\n\nThis chapter considers the evolution of modern copyright law against the background of its historical development in the UK and the international and European legal frameworks within which UK copyright law has been increasingly set since the nineteenth century. It examines the rationale and justifications for copyright and identifies the general policy context within which law and policy has developed in the UK and the EU. It also highlights the rapid development of new technologies which has brought copyright reform to the forefront in recent times, the difficulties which this new environment presents for the copyright framework, and how the framework has developed to such challenges."
