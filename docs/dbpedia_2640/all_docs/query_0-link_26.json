        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhat is the nature and quantum of human agency needed for someone to claim copyright in an original work of expression? At first glance, this question may seem overly metaphysical; yet in reality, it represents one of modern copyright law’s enduring anomalies. Consider the controversy involving the photograph commonly described as “the monkey selfie.” In this episode, a wildlife photographer, David Slater, spent several days in Indonesia following a group of macaque monkeys and photographing their behavior. At one point during the trip, Slater left his camera on its tripod, set the lens to autofocus, and moved away, hoping that the monkeys would approach it and give him a close-up view. Soon enough, a group of monkeys came by and started looking at the reflective lens of the camera. Unexpectedly, one monkey began pressing the camera’s buttons and ended up taking a self-photograph—that is, a “selfie.” Did Slater create the photograph, qualifying him as its author? His general intention was to photograph the monkeys in close proximity. He certainly provided all the equipment, set it all up appro­priately, and anticipated that the monkeys would approach the camera.\n\nJust as Slater was contemplating bringing suit against a website that posted the photograph without his permission, the Copyright Office clarified its rules and eliminated the possibility of protection for the work, concluding that to be eligible for protection, a work “must be created by a human being.” In what appeared to be a direct rebuke to Slater’s claim, it further clarified that a photograph “lack[ed] human authorship” when it was “taken by a monkey.” The Copyright Office was thereby suggesting that while Slater played some role in the creation of the photograph, that role was insufficient to make him its author, since the real creator of the work was the monkey. Even though the work itself met all the formal requirements of copyrightability, the rules presumptively denied Slater and the work protection because Slater’s failure to press the shutter button himself rendered him ineligible to be characterized as the author of the photograph. In other words, this failure was treated as having broken his causal connection to the work.\n\nModern copyright law accords protection to a work automatically, from the instant that the work is created and fixed in a “tangible medium of expression.” In the absence of any formal scrutiny of the work prior to its obtaining protection, copyright law all too readily presumes author­ship of the work and subjects the authorial status of a claimant to exami­nation only when disputed. When copyright law chooses to address the question of authorship, it focuses on whether the expression at issue qualifies as a “work of authorship” rather than on the process of author­ing the work. Authorship in this stylized conception originates entirely in the formal doctrinal prerequisites that a work needs to satisfy, such as the originality requirement and the idea–expression dichot­omy. This is true even though the term “authorship” suggests a particu­lar form, type, and amount of agency underlying the creative process that leads to the work’s creation. This endogenous construction of author­ship and its fragmented understanding through the individual components of copyrightability collectively disable any direct scrutiny of the causal connection between an individual’s actions and the produc­tion of the creative work. The law always presumes a (human) cause for copyright protection once the work itself is found to be protectable, with individu­alized proof of causation being unnecessary. What made the monkey-selfie episode controversial, then, was the Copyright Office’s overt recognition that authorship was more than just a formal matter and that it embodied an important causal dimension.\n\nDespite its growth to encompass a broad array of creative works and processes, copyright jurisprudence has failed to develop a mechanism for assessing when someone is causally responsible for the creative expression that is to be protected. Modern efforts to understand copy­right’s commitment to the ideal of authorship invariably border on the metaphysical in their attempts to understand the construct of the “author” in the abstract and thereby routinely elide the centrality of causation (and causal responsibility) in determining when and how someone ought to be treated as the author of a particular work of expres­sion already brought into existence. Not only does this lie in stark contrast to other areas of law in which the jurisprudence overtly addresses questions of causation but it also lies in contrast to copy­right’s own treatment of liability (for infringement), in which courts have come to see causation as an integral element of the analysis. If copy­right law and authorship do indeed embody a causal element—as one would expect, given their focus on creative behavior—the element is well hidden behind a cascade of copyright’s other intuitions and beliefs.\n\nEveryday scenarios of creative production that routinely give rise to potential claims of authorship embody important questions of causation. And yet, copyright law chooses to address the question of causation only indirectly (and begrudgingly). Consider an artist who accidentally knocks over a palette of paints to produce a visually appealing design on a nearby canvas that belongs to someone else, or a translator who, while attempting to decipher an ancient text, makes creative choices during the process that render the translation fairly distinct. Should the artist or the translator—in either instance—be treated as the author of the resulting work, rendering it eligible for protection? In the normal course of things, copyright law attempts to analyze the issue through the doctrine of “originality,” which asks whether the work was independently created and embodies a minimal amount of creativity that derives from the claimant. Originality, however, remains a rather poor fit for the causal question, given that it focuses almost entirely on the work itself rather than on the process of creation. Copyright law treats the author’s intentionality—or lack thereof—as irrelevant to the originality deter­mination, which is satisfied as long as the work itself exhibits a “modicum of creativity.” By refusing to address the core questions at issue in these scenarios for what they really are—questions of causal responsibility—copyright law in effect conceals its account of causation and presumes it to be altogether uncontroversial.\n\nThis Article argues that copyright law embodies a latent theory of causation, seen in early attempts to construct the “author” for specific categories of work and today hidden behind doctrinal proxies that perform other roles. Unsurprisingly, copyright’s account of causation embodies an important normative dimension, intricately connected to the various contested goals and objectives of copyright protection, which is perhaps responsible for causation’s dormant existence. Several of copy­right law’s modern doctrines embody snippets of this account of causa­tion, but scholars have rarely understood these doctrinal devices as related to causation. Recognizing that the overt acknowledgment of causation’s place in copyright law would better serve the law, this Article proposes an independent causation requirement that plaintiffs would have to prove as part of their prima facie cases. Here, as elsewhere, the workings of the common law provide important insights into how copyright law might realize this requirement.\n\nEver since the advent of legal realism as the dominant approach to legal analysis, scholars have come to see the identification of an act as a “cause” of an event or outcome as intricately connected to the enterprise of regulating the consequences of that determination, rather than as a purely neutral description of reality. Causation in the law thus embodies an unquestionably normative dimension, albeit one that is superimposed on factual criteria. Identifying an antecedent event as a “cause” of a legally relevant outcome involves a determination that there is both a factual connection between that event and the outcome and a norma­tively desirable reason for recognizing that event as legally significant in light of the law’s goals and purposes for the area involved.\n\nIn a similar vein, developing a requirement of “copyrightable causation” as a prerequisite to copyright protection would serve copy­right jurisprudence well. Copyrightable causation would require deter­mining whether the causal antecedent that the putative author or claimant is relying on as the act of creation represents the precise type, form, and quantum of creative input that copyright law should—as a factual and normative matter—deem significant for entry into its system of exclusive rights. Much like other aspects of copyrightability, copy­rightable causation would constitute a part of the plaintiff’s prima facie case for a claim of infringement and embody two separate elements. The first element, “creation in fact,” would examine whether an actor’s partic­ipation in the creative process contributed as a factual matter to the production of the creative expression. The second component, “legal creation,” would then ask whether the contribution—so proven to exist—is significant enough when viewed in light of copyright’s purposes (i.e., normatively) to generate protection and authorship. The appli­cation of this requirement to different areas of creativity should produce varying standards, in turn reflective of copyright’s goals and purposes for those areas.\n\nIncorporating a copyrightable-causation requirement into copyright law would also add substantive content to copyright’s purported—and constitutionally enshrined —commitment to authorship. Scholars today understand authorship to be a largely amorphous idea within copyright law—one that plays a symbolic and expressive role rather than an analytical one. This reality is confirmed by the surprising absence of any meaningful discussion of the idea within copyright case law. A copyrightable-causation requirement would allow copyright doctrine to disaggregate the idea of authoring a work of expression and enable a more detailed examination of that process. The requirement would thereby bring into sharp focus the act—rather than just the result—of authorship and move copyright doctrine and thinking away from its singular emphasis on the “work.” Authorship would in the process re-emerge not just as a symbolic ideal within the system but also as a sub­stantive feature of copyright doctrine that plays a significant role in determining claimants’ rights. The copyrightable-causation require­ment would thereby emphasize that causation is the sine qua non of authorship.\n\nWhile copyright law is statutory in origin as a purely formal matter, much of the modern American copyright system nonetheless consists of rules and principles developed by courts incrementally and contextually in common law fashion. These rules, best described as the federal common law of copyright, augment the statutory text, a reality that courts and scholars have come to see as uncontroversial. Indeed, Congress has incorporated large parts of this federal common law into the text of the Copyright Act itself, effectively restating the rules in statutory form. The copyrightable-causation requirement proposed herein would be a valuable addition to this body of law, and given the requirement’s connection to the common law of torts, courts would be best positioned to develop it. Additionally, the requirement would need to work in tandem with the law’s existing requirement of originality, an established feature of the common law of copyright, giving federal courts a logical and prudential reason to develop it without congressional intervention.\n\nParts I and II of this Article unpack copyright’s dormant theory of authorial causation. Part I looks to early case law, in which courts grappled with the nature and quantum of human agency required for classification as an author of a work, and argues that this early jurispru­dence reveals an unacknowledged commitment to understanding auth­orship in causal terms. Part II provides an overview of copyright law’s modern treatment of authorial causation. It analyzes how courts have routinely deployed several of copyright’s current doctrinal devices to mask what are essentially questions of causation, undermining the analytical coherence of copyright doctrine. Part III then moves to the prescriptive and introduces an independent element of copyrightability that focuses on causation—“copyrightable causation”—and unpacks its elements. Drawing on the understanding of causation in tort law, this Part shows how copyrightable causation should be seen as embodying both a descriptive and a normative dimension in its application to individual cases. Part IV considers a few possible extensions and applica­tions of the copyrightable-causation requirement.\n\nA caveat is in order before proceeding further. As should be appar­ent from the following discussion, the principal impetus for this Article’s proposal for an overt copyrightable-causation requirement is the recogni­tion that the ideas underlying the requirement are already dormant within copyright jurisprudence and thinking. Consequently, the require­ment is not designed to exclude some forms of expression from protec­tion or to bring certain others under the umbrella of copyright­ability. In actual practice, the requirement is unlikely to alter the boundaries of copyrightability in any significant manner. Rather, a copyrightable-causation requirement would streamline the system’s current rationale and better articulate the myriad ideas that are currently concealed within the concept of authorship.\n\nI. Authorship as Causation\n\nCopyright’s construction of authorship has long embodied an important causal element. This Part attempts to trace the contours of copyright’s dormant theory of authorial causation. Section I.A first looks to early copyright jurisprudence involving nontraditional settings of creative production, in which courts have grappled with the issue of causation when determining a work’s authorship. Section I.B then dis­cusses how this jurisprudence strove to articulate a focus on the nature and quantum of human agency needed for authorship.\n\nA. The Author as Cause\n\nThe author has always been the principal subject of copyright protection. The Intellectual Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution enables Congress to enact a copyright law to secure exclusive rights in writings to “Authors.” Similarly, the Statute of Anne, the first modern copyright statute, vested in “the Author of any Book . . . the sole Right and Liberty” of printing and distributing the book and its contents. Over the last several decades, scholars have spent a significant amount of time and effort trying to understand how, why, and when copyright thinking came to embrace this overbearing emphasis on the author, as well as the consequences of this emphasis for copyright jurisprudence. One prominent school of thought locates the origins of this emphasis in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, by which time scholars believe an enlightenment-driven, individualistic conception of creativity emerged—influencing copyright law and policy for several subsequent decades. Another more recent school of thought argues that the prior account is largely incomplete with respect to American copyright law and that conceptions of authorship came to be firmly embedded in copyright doctrine only during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nWhile a good amount of scholarship has focused on unpacking the construct of the “author” in copyright law, there appears to be surpris­ingly little discussion of what the process of authoring entails concep­tually as a matter of copyright law, theory, and policy. Scholars have generally taken authorship to be about understanding the structure, motivation, status, and ideological currency of the author rather than as an effort to understand and unpack the particular process through which the author generates the work that eventually becomes the object of the protection. Even when they do discuss authorship as a process, they invariably treat the question as driven in significant part by normative considerations underlying copyright’s construction of authorship, cloud­ing its analytical basis.\n\nProfessor Alan Durham, for example, argues that “indeterminate works”—works that are created in some part by forces beyond the will or control of the author—should receive protection because they are just as original as other works. Building on the idea that authorship in copyright is defined “in terms of originality,” Durham argues that an indeterminate work merits protection when it is “made” by a human being, “similar in kind” to other protected works, and under the “creative control” of the human. But this account’s a priori category of “indeterminate works” assumes away the core of the problem, which its solution then attempts to artificially remedy. This analysis all too readily implies that there is indeed a workable basis for maintaining the determinate–indeterminate distinction, when this distinction is the source of the problem in the first place. Durham does the same with works “made” by someone and works under an individual’s “control,” all in an effort to further a particular normative position (associated with originality). Yet nowhere in this analysis does Durham recognize that the very ideas of determinacy, control, and the like themselves turn on an understanding of causation.\n\nAs a practical matter, there is little need for courts to scrutinize an individual’s contribution to the process of creating the work, given that the issue appears to be undisputed in the vast majority of cases. It is only when confronted with the need to identify the author of a work by reference to the author’s actions in bringing the work into existence that courts become compelled to articulate a theory of authorial causation—one that links a claimant’s process of creation with the ultimate product of that process (i.e., the work). The historical jurisprudence that emerged from such situations therefore sheds important light on the theory of authorial causation that copyright came to embrace and later conceal under various proxies.\n\n1. Choosing Among Contributors to a Work. — The earliest situations in which courts confronted the question of authorial causation were cases in which a claimant (i.e., a putative author) had interacted with others in the production and creation of the work at issue and sought to be characterized as its sole author upon completion. These were not instances of joint authorship, with more than one party claiming to be the work’s author, but instead situations in which one party claimed to be the author of the work to the exclusion of all the other contributors. These disputes usually followed a common pattern. One party—the conceiver—would conceive of the project and its design and thereafter utilize the services of one or more others to execute specific components of the project under direction. These executors would no doubt produce expression; yet such expression was decidedly for use in the overall project. The overarching question that courts confronted was whether the conceiver who designed the project and was responsible for it could be characterized as its author under copyright law, despite the fact that others had actually created the project’s individual components.\n\nIn an overwhelming majority of these cases, courts recognized the conceiver to be the author of the work, even though significant parts of the actual execution came from someone else. One prominent nineteenth-century treatise on English copyright law synthesized the rule to recognize that “the author is the man from whom emanates the general conception and design . . . although much of the detail may have been the work of subordinate brains and hands.” In one often-quoted case, the court observed:\n\n[U]nder the [Statute of Anne], the person who forms the plan, and who embarks in the speculation of a work, and who employs various persons to compose different parts of it, adapted to their own peculiar acquirements,—that he, the person who so forms the plan and scheme of the work, and pays different artists of his own selection who upon certain conditions contribute to it, is the author and proprietor of the work, if not within the literal expression, at least within the equitable meaning of the statute of Anne, which, being a remedial law, is to be construed liberally.\n\nCentral to this conclusion was a finding that the work owed its origins to its conceiver, since it “emanate[d]” from him. When exactly this connection might be implied was of course far from clear in practice. Consequently, in situations in which the connection between the conceiver and the final work appeared more attenuated, courts did not hesitate to deny authorship status to the conceiver. Elaborating on this strand of thinking, one treatise noted that “[t]he mere suggestion of a subject or idea which is then entirely designed and executed by another does not constitute the originator of the idea an author.”\n\nScholars have often cited the mid-nineteenth-century case of Shepherd v. Conquest as an example of such a denial. The plaintiffs in that case were the proprietors of a theater who had employed a playwright to write and adapt two plays for them. The proprietors compensated the playwright for his service and paid him a weekly salary, and the playwright eventually produced a dramatic work. When the playwright later assigned the work to the defendant, the plaintiffs claimed to be authors of the work by virtue of having commissioned it and having specified the general direction it was to take. The court disagreed, noting that the proprietors had not contributed to the “design or execution of the work.”\n\nAt first glance, one might interpret the case as having premised its conclusion on the idea–expression dichotomy—the principle that the plaintiffs had merely contributed the idea rather than the expression. However, the idea–expression dichotomy appeared to be largely irrele­vant to the court, which faulted the plaintiffs for not having “contributed an idea.” The decision rested instead on the finding that the plaintiffs had made no contribution of significance to the work beyond “sug­gest[ing]” its subject.\n\nAccording to this understanding, valid authorial causation therefore required a contribution that was more than a mere suggestion of the idea. All the same, courts did not require the actual execution or design of the expression. Rather, courts required the contribution to be compositional—that is, related to the content underlying the work rather than its mere physical manifestation. What made a conceiver an author was thus her contribution to the composition of the content, even if not directly to the content (expression) itself. However, the celebrated case of Walter v. Lane, which added an altogether new twist to courts’ early notion of authorial causation, called this compositional requirement into question.\n\nWalter v. Lane brought the question of authorial causation to the forefront in determining authorship. The case involved a series of speeches given by a public personality. Several reporters attended these speeches and took handwritten notes of the speeches in shorthand. They thereafter “wrote the descriptive parts of their reports” and “corrected and revised and punctuated” the speech transcriptions for publication in the London newspaper the Times, which claimed to carry the verbatim text of the original speeches. The defendant later copied these speeches and disputed the authorial status of the reporters, argu­ing that the reporters had not produced an “original composition” given that they had transcribed “verbatim reports” of the speech.\n\nThe House of Lords found for the plaintiffs, concluding that the reporters were indeed the authors of the work that they had tran­scribed. To the court, the work did not have to be an original composition to be eligible for protection. Since each reporter was crucially responsible for producing the book, this was sufficient for a claim of authorship. The judges placed great reliance on the fact that absent the “brain and handiwork [of the reporters] the book would never have had existence.” The book’s reliance merely on prior content (the speech) did not render it any less an act of authorship.\n\nWalter v. Lane is in important ways consistent with the general approach to authorship seen in the other early cases. All of these nineteenth-century cases involved selecting one among several contrib­utors to the work of expression as its sole—rather than joint—author, and in each instance the court chose to do so by focusing on a conception of authorship that examined the ultimate responsibility for the work’s existence, in a but-for sense of the term. But for the speculat­ing conceiver, who was willing to generate the idea, design, and resources necessary to produce the work, there would be no work to speak of; and but for the reporter transcribing the orally delivered speech, there would be no record of it to distribute. The denial of authorship status to an employer who played no active (and direct) role whatsoever in the production of the work was merely a recognition of an outer boundary in this but-for reasoning—that is, a situation in which the work could have still been produced even without the employer. The logic of causation had begun to take shape within copyright’s conception of authorship.\n\nAmerican copyright law around the time appears to have adopted a largely similar position, though case law directly addressing the question of authorial causation is more limited. The leading copyright treatise of the time readily endorses the early English position as good law in the United States. It also gleans from these cases an additional proposition of causal significance in an effort to reconcile the early cases: “When the same work is the basis of two or more different copyrights, he is the author, within the meaning of the statute, who has produced that for which the copyright is granted.” The treatise goes on to observe that a translator is the author of the translation, even if not of the original work, and the person who arranges music becomes the author of the arrangement, even if not of the composition itself. This approach to determining authorship is consistent with Walter v. Lane, but it also situates the authorship question in the context of the particular act (e.g., translation or composition) that the copyright system is attempting to validate through its grant of exclusive rights. The author, in other words, is the person who originated the legally defined object of protection rather than the work as a whole (e.g., the translation rather than the original book or the arrangement rather than the original score). By recognizing an identifiable basis for the connection (between author and work), this construction throws the causal question into sharp relief.\n\n2. Mechanical Intervention in the Creative Process. — It was not until courts were forced to deal with situations in which creators had relied extensively on mechanical methods and processes to create the work that the causal question emerged as an overt consideration in copyright jurisprudence. Somewhat interestingly, the primary area in which this arose was in relation to photographs and their copyrightability. Photog­raphy was invented in the first half of the nineteenth century and started gaining popularity as an artistic practice a decade or so after. As noted previously, this was also around the time that copyright law—on both sides of the Atlantic—was grappling with the general question of author­ship in situations involving multiple contributors.\n\nIn the United States, Congress amended the copyright statute to include photographs as copyrightable subject matter in 1865. Conse­quently, courts had to decide whether photographs created prior to the amendment were at all eligible for protection under the general principles of copyright. This in turn forced them to grapple with the process through which photographs were created and the role of human agency therein. In an 1866 decision, Wood v. Abbott, a New York circuit court refused to treat a photograph as a work of authorship, reasoning that in photography, “the only force that contributes to the formation of the image is the chemical force of light, operating on a surface made sensitive to its power.”\n\nThe Wood court appeared conflicted about the proper role of human agency in the creation and production of photographic prints. For methods of imitation known at the time—such as engraving—the court readily recognized that the production of the work involved a “combination” of agency and mechanical processes but acknowledged that this combination satisfied copyright law’s minimum threshold of agency to qualify for protection. For photography, however, the court found that this threshold was not satisfied, instead attributing the pro­duction of the photograph in its entirety to “the chemical force of light.” The human agency, if any, was in turn seen as limited to the positioning of the plate, paper, frame, and springs—cumulatively beyond the pale of the authorial causation supposedly recognized by the law at the time (i.e., pre-1865). The reasoning in the case is perfectly con­sistent with what Professor Christine Farley describes as the conflict between photography as an art and as a science, which characterizes how individuals thought about the process at the time.\n\nAfter the copyright statute was amended (in both England and the United States) to cover photographs as protectable subject matter, the question of determining who might be characterized as the author of a photograph—and under what conditions—remained significant and fell to courts. Nottage v. Jackson, decided by the Court of Appeals in England, appears to be among the first cases to consider the question directly. There, the plaintiffs were the owners of a photography firm with several employees. On one occasion, the manager of the firm—of his own volition—decided to take a photograph of the Australian cricket team and sent an assistant to physically “take” the photograph, after which the firm processed, mounted, and offered the photograph for sale. The question before the court was whether the plaintiffs, who had no role in the taking of the photograph, could qualify as its author under copyright law. The court answered the question in the negative. Central to its reasoning was the fact that the plaintiffs had not been physically present during the taking of the photograph, nor had they played a supervisory role in its production or in the idea behind it. Further complicating the analysis for the court was the reality that, given the complexity of the equipment involved, the process of taking the photograph itself often involved more than one individual. Reasoning through these issues, the court noted that it was ultimately searching for the cause of the photograph:\n\n[A]ll I can do is to see who is the nearest person—the nearest like the author of a painting or the author of a drawing. Certainly it is not the man who simply gives the idea of a picture . . . . He may have the idea, but still he is not there . . . . The nearest I can come to is that it is the person who effectively is, as near as he can be, the cause of the picture which is produced—that is, the person who has superintended the arrangement, who has actually formed the picture by putting the people into position, and arranging the place in which the people are to be—the man who is the effective cause of that. Although he may only have done it by standing in the room and giving orders about it, still it is his mind and act, as far as anybody’s mind and act are concerned, which is the effective cause of the picture such as it is when it is produced. Therefore it will be a question in every case who that man is. That will be a matter of evidence. That will be a question of fact.\n\nHere one sees for the first time a court openly acknowledging that the identification of authorship for a work is ultimately a causal question—a question of determining the “effective cause” of the protected work. Notably, the court readily acknowledged that this cause will vary from one setting to another, even for the same category of work. It might thus be someone’s superintendence over the process in one instance, the arrangement of the subjects in another, or the physical taking of the picture in yet others. Additionally, the court gave the “cause” an epistemic basis—as something that might be discerned from evidence presented to the court.\n\nIn short order, the same question arose under U.S. copyright law in the landmark Supreme Court case of Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony. Burrow-Giles involved a photograph of Oscar Wilde, taken by the photographer Napoleon Sarony. Sarony had posed Wilde in a particu­lar way, played a role in Wilde’s choice of attire, and then directed the taking of the photograph. Yet the defendant argued that the photo­graph could not be protected as a matter of copyright and constitu­tional law, since there was no identifiable author and its production was “merely mechanical,” involving “the manual operation, by the use of these instruments and preparations, of transferring to the plate the visible representation of some existing object, the accuracy of this represen­tation being its highest merit.”\n\nThe Court chose to dodge the question of determining when and how photography was a purely mechanical (as opposed to artistic) process by concluding that an “ordinary production of a photograph” was indeed a purely mechanical process that would not qualify for protection. Sarony’s photograph, however, was not such an ordinary production; instead, it was “an original work of art[] [and] the product of plaintiff’s intellectual invention,” which rendered it eligible for protection. The Court then approvingly cited the English decision in Nottage—specifically the language about the author being the effective cause of the work—and noted that the author of a photograph was “the man who really represents, creates, or gives effect to the idea, fancy, or imagination.” With this, Burrow-Giles came to endorse the “effective cause”–based construction of authorship in photographs.\n\nAs Farley notes, the Court’s focus on the cause of the photograph arose as a result of its attempt to locate authorship in the preshutter activities of the photographer rather than in the postshutter—that is, negative development—ones. This allowed the conception of author­ship to draw a bright line between the human and mechanical aspects of photography, since postshutter activities at the time involved a far more significant reliance on technology. In other words, the Court’s singular focus on the preshutter cause of the photograph allowed authorship to emphasize the human dimension of the creative process involved.\n\nLater photography cases generally followed the framework of Burrow-Giles, looking for sufficient preshutter agency on the part of a plaintiff-claimant to find authorship. The “effective cause” idea has in the years since Burrow-Giles become the dominant approach to determining the authorship of a photograph, albeit without open acknowledgement. It is precisely because of the open-ended epistemic nature of this standard that courts have on multiple occasions been able to locate the authorship of photographs in individuals other than the photographer who presses the shutter button. Others involved in arranging, posing, or curating the subject matter have, through an application of the effective-cause standard, come to be seen as equally important agents in the overall causal chain that results in the production of the photograph.\n\nBurrow-Giles’s effective-cause framework has had influence beyond photographs as well. For example, one court used the framework to classify the director of a motion picture as the work’s author, even though he played no direct role in its underwater filming, owing to the “control” that the director exercised over the overall process.\n\nOn one occasion, the Third Circuit used this idea to underplay the mechanical aspects of fixation in the authorship determination. In Andrien v. Southern Ocean County Chamber of Commerce, the court treated a cartographer who had surveyed a geographic area, conceptualized the maps at issue, and directed their production as the author of the maps even though someone else had actually printed them. The court defined the author as “the party who actually creates the work, that is, the person who translates an idea into an expression that is embodied in a copy by himself or herself, or who authorizes another to embody the expression in a copy.” When the final task of fixation and embodiment might be characterized as purely “rote” or “mechanical,” the court reasoned that the human agency that constitutes authorship—that is, the cause—is to be found earlier in the chain. Distilled down to its basics, this logic is but a reaffirmation of the standard developed in Burrow-Giles.\n\nThe mechanical-intervention cases thus brought the causal dimen­sion of authorship to the forefront in copyright jurisprudence. While early cases—culminating in Burrow-Giles—articulated the idea in avowedly causal terms, later jurisprudence used terminology that seemed less overtly causal but nonetheless focused on the nature and quantum of human agency involved in bringing the work into exist­ence. More recently, the question has arisen in cases relating to so-called “computational creativity”—situations in which a person creates a computer program that then itself generates creative expression using its artificial intelligence. In these instances, scholars have begun to question the appropriate role of human agency in determining the authorship of what are essentially machine-produced works.\n\n3. Spiritual Authorship. — A third area in which the questions of human agency and causation became central to determining authorship for copyright purposes is automatic writing, also referred to as “psy­chography.” Psychography involves an individual who transcribes expression that was supposedly communicated to her by a supernatural source. The individual operates as the medium and converts the message of the supernatural source into understandable expression. The early-twentieth-century English case of Cummins v. Bond was the first to decide who the author of such expression was for the purposes of copyright law.\n\nThe plaintiff in Cummins was a psychic who practiced automatic writing. After covering her eyes with one hand and holding a pencil in the other, she would pass into a state of trance and begin writing rapidly on a sheet of paper, sometimes at the rate of 2,000 words per hour and a half. On one such occasion, she claimed to have been visited by a spirit and came to produce a work titled The Chronicle of Cleophas. The work was authored in an archaic language, which the defendant then copied. In an action for copyright infringement, the court had to confront the question of authorship in the work.\n\nThe court—somewhat comically—noted that the “true originator of all that is to be found in these documents is some being no longer inhabiting this world, and who has been out of it for a length of time sufficient to justify the hope that he has no reason for wishing to return to it.” Without disputing the veracity of this claim, the court nonethe­less proceeded to find that the plaintiff was indeed the author of the work for copyright purposes:\n\n[T]he communications . . . could not have reached us in this form without the active co-operation of some agent competent to translate them from the language in which they were communicated to her into something more intelligible to persons of the present day. The plaintiff claims to be this agent and to possess, and the defendant admits that she does possess, some qualification enabling her, when in a more or less uncon­scious condition, to reproduce in language under­standable by those who have the time and inclination to read it, information supplied to her from the source referred to in language with which the plaintiff has no acquaintance when fully awake.\n\n. . . [I]t would seem to be clear that the authorship rests with this lady, to whose gift of extremely rapid writing coupled with a peculiar ability to reproduce in archaic English matter communicated to her in some unknown tongue we owe the production of these documents.\n\nIn short, the court needed to identify a human agent responsible for the production of the particular expression for which protection was being sought under copyright.\n\nCummins thus articulates the logic first put forth in Walter v. Lane, namely that the author is the individual but for whose actions the work—in its protectable form—would not be in existence at all. Yet there is also a so-far unacknowledged element: the need to identify a human cause for the work. The precise rationale for this human element remains somewhat unclear. Perhaps it had its origins in the court’s inability to countenance the possibility that the work at issue might be rendered authorless altogether if a human source for the creativity were not identified.\n\nAs recently as 2000, the logic of Cummins in identifying the first human actor who transcribes a psychographic work as its author appeared to hold sway. In Penguin Books U.S.A., Inc. v. New Christian Church of Full Endeavor, Ltd., the court was presented with facts very similar to those of Cummins. A psychic had experienced a series of dreams and heard an inner voice, which requested her to transcribe its message into writing. She then engaged in “rapid inner dictation,” which produced an elaborate set of notes that she then edited and converted into a published manuscript. During the litigation, the court had to address the question of authorship over the manuscript. Relying on Cummins, it concluded that the psychic was indeed the author, since “dictation from a nonhuman source should not be a bar to copyright.” As in Cummins, the court relied on but-for causal logic:\n\n[I]f indeed it was Jesus who spoke to [the psychic], it was only because she had opened herself up to the possibility of receiving this vision . . . . Again, even if the [work] came from Jesus, significant aspects of it are the direct result of it having come through [the psychic]. In this way, [the psychic] is . . . an author . . . , since even Defendants in this action have essentially conceded that had the [work] been channeled through any other individual, its form would have been different.\n\nSimilar to Cummins, the need to identify a human cause for the human-processed expression was at the root of the Penguin Books court’s reasoning.\n\nIt is, of course, quite plausible that the courts in these cases were implicitly questioning the veracity of the plaintiff’s factual claims (i.e., about the true source) and merely articulating a rationale to mask their disbelief. In other words, one might see these courts’ reasoning as a form of ex post rationalization, rather than an analytical precursor to their conclusion. Even allowing for that possibility, the courts’ decision to connect authorship with human agency is revealing: The effort to distinguish between human and nonhuman agency—whether real or motivated—lends support to the proposition that the courts’ conception of authorship was motivated in no small part by what is effectively a causal question (i.e., agency).\n\nThe copyright jurisprudence on spiritual authorship introduces a new element into the causation inquiry. On the one hand, it builds on the preexisting case law that looks to the effective cause of the work in a but-for sense. Yet it does so by expressly acknowledging that the effec­tive cause needs to be human, a supposition that the mechanical-intervention cases alluded to but never openly endorsed. As previously noted, in the context of mechanical intervention, some courts appeared perfectly willing to deny a work any copyright protection on the basis that it did not involve sufficient authorial creativity. The merger of the concepts of copyrightability, authorship, and originality thereby came to mask the emphasis on humans. With spiritual intervention, the work itself could rarely be classified as uncopyrightable on its face given its prima facie originality (unlike a photograph that could, by contrast, be treated as an “ordinary production”), necessitating an account for preferring the human to the nonhuman actor, even when the human actor openly acknowledged the centrality of the nonhuman element to the creative process. And courts came to develop that account around the idea that the work could not have been brought into “earth[l]y” existence without the psychic’s (i.e., the human’s) role and intervention, short for the logic of but-for causation.\n\nB. The Search for Human Agency\n\nAs the previous discussions reveal, causation has historically factored into copyright law’s conception of authorship. Courts paid close attention to the form, quality, and quantity of agency involved in the production of the creative work when determining whether a claimant qualifies as an author. An identification of the right kind of human agency—that caused the work to be brought into existence—was thus integral to the construction of authorship.\n\nIt is important to appreciate a crucial baseline that played an implicit role in copyright’s early account of causation. In searching for the agency at the root of a work, early copyright jurisprudence focused entirely on the human agency that might be properly characterized as causally responsible for the work. Authorship was therefore presump­tively a human endeavor, as far as copyright law was concerned. The logic underlying this proposition was somewhat obvious. Given that authorship was invariably tied to ownership and the assertion of legal rights, it made little sense to speak of nonhuman authorship. In addition, given the fundamentally instrumental nature of Anglo-American copyright law (“for encouragement of learning” ), relating it to human intervention seemed but essential.\n\nAll the same, this seemingly unobjectionable precept had a less-than-subtle effect on the analysis. Once a person brought a facially original work of expression into existence, the parameters of the search for agency automatically became narrower. When there were competing claimants for authorship status, courts merely had to examine whose particular agency was more directly connected to the existence of the work—rather than whether any of their agencies was objectively sufficient on its own. In other words, the possibility that none of the claimants might satisfy an absolute threshold of agency for the claim to authorship never emerged in these situations because the original work would thereby be rendered unprotected altogether—a result that the work’s facially original or creative nature intuitively militated against.\n\nThe same pattern appears in cases involving nonhuman (i.e., mechanical or spiritual) intervention. When some early courts concluded that photographs were more the product of mechanical processes than human creativity and denied plaintiffs’ authorship claims, this had the effect of denying the work any protection under copyright law. However, these courts’ willingness to come to this conclusion was closely tied to findings—seen in these opinions—about the photographs themselves (whether individually or as a class), especially insofar as such photography sought to replicate reality. This lies in contrast to situations in which the work itself was prima facie creative, such as with spiritual authorship. In these situations, courts readily disregarded the nonhuman element in the creative process in order to credit the human actor as the author of the work based on a minimal level of agency, often with the explicit recognition that to do otherwise would be to exclude a facially original creation from the realm of copyright altogether.\n\nOne might thus appropriately describe the search for human agency in copyright law as a constrained analysis. When a work is indisputably protectable and the question is merely who—among multiple contend­ers—is to qualify as its author, the inquiry focuses on the precise form and quantum of human agency involved. One might term this the “relative agency determination,” since the court is merely comparing multiple human agencies to select one as authorial. When courts view a work as meriting protection but view such protection as contingent on identifying an author without which the work would fall into the public domain, the inquiry instead focuses on locating and identifying the minimum agency required for authorship. This variant is best described as the “absolute agency determination,” since the court is attempting to construct an account of authorial agency to establish copyright protection. Both variants are undoubtedly questions of causation, but each is influenced by the precise framing and context of what the causal inquiry is seeking to achieve: protection or allocation.\n\nRecognizing the constrained nature of the search for human agency in the authorship analysis also produces another, perhaps more im­portant, insight about the causal inquiry in copyright law: namely, that it embodies two analytically distinct (albeit functionally overlapping) elements. The first element is principally factual, with the law examining whether and how an individual put into motion the set of acts that eventually resulted in the production of the work under scrutiny. This constitutes the epistemic dimension of the causal inquiry in the authorship determination, since it focuses on the sufficiency and significance of the evidence available to determine that an individual did actually produce the work in a purely metaphysical sense.\n\nCourts acknowledge this aspect of the inquiry when they concede that determining the cause of a work is principally a “matter of evidence,” as occurred in Nottage. The primary mechanism that they thus employ in this epistemic endeavor is the but-for causation test or the sine qua non approach, which is well known in other contexts. This test essentially involves determining whether—as a counterfactual—the outcome that did occur (i.e., the creation of the work) would have occurred even without the intervention of the actor in question, which helps the court to ascertain the causal nexus in question. Thus the Nottage court was essentially concluding that the photograph would have very well come into existence even without the role of the plaintiff-proprietors, thereby rendering their intervention causally unrelated to the final work.\n\nAll the same, it is critical to appreciate that the epistemic dimension does not exhaust the entire gamut of the causal inquiry. Rather, the causal inquiry also embodies an evaluative dimension. This evaluative dimension transcends the more probative dimension—though it still depends on the probative dimension—and examines whether, even if a purely factual basis for a causal attribution exists, this factual basis ought to be sufficient for such an attribution. The evaluative aspect, in other words, asks whether the epistemically defensible cause ought to be enough for authorship purposes given the obvious consequences of an affirmative finding. Instead of relying entirely on the conceptual or analytical for an answer, the evaluative dimension looks to the implications of the determination and approaches the causal analysis pragmatically.\n\nA good example of this evaluative dimension at work is the court’s conclusion in Shepherd that the mere existence of an employment relationship ought not, on its own, produce the status of authorship. In essence, the Shepherd court was suggesting that even if an employer might have played a role in initiating the production of the work, that connec­tion was insufficient in the case at hand—for authorship purposes—to qualify as the normatively relevant cause of the work. Even if the court was not explicit about it, the fact that one individual’s creative labor might produce ownership rights (and exclusivity) in another person who merely suggested the idea and did no more seemed unfair and did not align with copyright’s fundamental purpose of “elevat[ing] and protect[ing] literary men.” The consequence—“buy[ing] [the author’s] brains”—was thus integral to the court’s evaluation of causal sufficiency.\n\nMuch of copyright’s account of authorial causation is evaluative in nature and content. Even when the evidence shows an individual to have contributed in some minimal way to the creation of the work—either absolutely or relatively—courts still analyze whether that contribution should be the basis for authorship. And in making this determination, they implicitly turn to normative considerations underlying the institu­tion, often without overt acknowledgment. Examining the multiple considerations that courts (implicitly and explicitly) take into account in the evaluative part of the causal inquiry reveals three general principles that motivate courts’ analysis, each of which operates as a midlevel constraint rather than as a foundational principle. Despite being analytically distinct, these principles are not always mutually exclusive. Section III.C elucidates on these principles, but they first deserve mention here.\n\nThe first principle is the adequacy of control over the creative process. In situations in which the putative author has had insufficient creative control over the process through which the work was created, either absolutely or relatively, courts treat the causal nexus as insufficient to generate authorship. One can see this principle at work in a recent case, Kelley v. Chicago Park District, in which the court denied protection to an artist who had created an aesthetically pleasing arrangement of live plants in a garden and sought to copyright the product as a form of conceptual art. The court instead concluded that “gardens are planted and cultivated, not authored,” since they emerge from nature rather than human creation.\n\nThe second principle is that of disproportionality. When a court determines that according authorial status to one party is likely to produce an unfair distribution of the entitlement, either by reference to the parties’ respective labor, intellectual input, or investment, once again the court may deem the causal chain severed. In the early copyright cases, courts invoked this principle in situations that involved multiple contributors.\n\nThe third principle emerges from a desire to avoid a personality conflation in identifying the author. Authorship entails instantiating one’s personal choices into the expressive content of a work. Courts strive to ensure that the process of delineating the author by reference to causation tracks the creative process. When finding a causal nexus would conflate the salience of these choices, they readily find it to be severed. One sees this logic at play in the law’s efforts to demarcate the boundaries of different works based on different authors’ contributions, especially when those works themselves appear interrelated. It is precisely this idea that Eaton Drone captured with his observation that when content can give rise to different works, the author is the person “who has produced that for which the copyright is granted.” According to this conception of causation, a lawful translation is not legally caused by the author of the original work that was the subject of the translation.\n\nEach of these principles tracks important normative considerations and precepts underlying the copyright system, many of which remain relevant today. Putting the relative–absolute and epistemic–evaluative elements of the causal inquiry together thus yields four variants of the causal question in the authorship determination. All four variants of the causal inquiry can be found in copyright jurisprudence, even though courts rarely acknowledge the precise analytical nature of the investiga­tion that they are undertaking. In particular, courts hesitate to admit to the evaluative nature of the inquiry in certain situations, especially in the absolute setting. They instead mask the causal framework behind copyright’s other entry requirements, such as originality.\n\nTable 1: The Dimensions of Authorial Causation\n\nIt is especially important to appreciate the epistemic–evaluative distinction. While courts readily acknowledge the epistemic part of the question in their reasoning, they are far less willing to admit the exist­ence of the evaluative, instead preferring to couch the evaluative aspects of the inquiry in probative terms as well. Of course, this phenom­enon is hardly unique to copyright law. Yet when coupled with courts’ frequent unwillingness to acknowledge the existence of a causal dimen­sion in their copyrightability determinations, the collapse of the evalua­tive aspects of the inquiry into the epistemic confounds the analysis even further.\n\nAuthorship has therefore long embodied a theory of causation, reflected in the institution’s search for human agency as the source of protectable expression. A notable feature of this causal theory is that it embodies important normative elements, requiring courts to exercise their judgment over the form and sufficiency of the agency at issue in each instance. Motivated by copyright’s emphasis on human creativity as a foundational ideal and informed by the institution’s additional commit­ments, copyright’s search for causation in determining authorship is functionally embedded in the institution’s overall framework of copy­rightability. All the same, it remains analytically and conceptually distinct—a reality that is often forgotten when it is hidden behind copyright’s other doctrinal devices.\n\nII. Modern Proxies for Causation\n\nPart I introduced the theory of authorial causation underlying copyright law, principally in situations in which the nature and identity of authorship required a clear determination. This Part moves to the modern context, in which courts have made the causal determination within several of copyright’s doctrinal mechanisms, each of which exists for reasons unconnected to causation.\n\nDuring the formative years of copyright law, courts were willing to develop copyright doctrine by reasoning from first principles. As the law evolved, copyright jurisprudence developed a finite set of doctrinal rules and devices that courts could employ. In the United States, this evolution reached its pinnacle with the Copyright Act of 1976, which comprehensively revised the federal copyright law. In effect, this crystallized copyright’s myriad doctrinal mechanisms, even though the statute itself did not purport to restrict judge-made copyright law. The net result was that courts became far less willing to rely on first principles in their decisions, preferring to rely on copyright’s statutorily validated mechanisms instead.\n\nAuthorial causation fell victim to this development. The tasks of independently determining whether something was a “work of author­ship” and whether an actor was an “author” began to recede in importance, as more and more of copyright doctrine became codified. And yet, Congress never once defined “authorship” as part of this codification; nor did Congress make authorship an independent element that a claimant needed to prove to obtain protection. Consequently, courts confronting questions of authorship—and authorial causation—have had to address them through other doctrinal mechanisms. This indirect or proxy method of dealing with authorial causation has pro­duced the impression that authorial causation is altogether redundant within modern copyright law’s analytical framework.\n\nThe remainder of this Part examines the three most prominent copyright doctrines in which questions of authorial causation remain embedded and indirectly addressed, albeit in an ad hoc manner. Section II.A discusses the originality doctrine, which at first seems to embody an overt causal dimension but ultimately does not permit courts to sufficiently scrutinize the process of authoring and its underlying ideas about causation. Section II.B examines the joint works doctrine, which has at times allowed courts to mask their causal intuitions under the doctrine’s “mutual intent” requirement. Finally, section II.C turns to the work for hire doctrine, which presumes a causal relationship between two parties without further inquiry, once certain threshold criteria are met.\n\nA. Originality\n\nProtection under copyright law exists only in “original works of authorship” when “fixed in [a] tangible medium of expression.” The legislative history accompanying the Copyright Act describes originality and fixation as the “two fundamental criteria of copyright protection.” Originality represents modern copyright law’s best-known entry requirement.\n\nThe Copyright Act does not define originality; rather, the concept is entirely a creation of courts. The term’s precise meaning has fluctu­ated over the course of copyright’s long history, but the modern understanding—at least in the American context—derives from the Supreme Court’s well-known decision in Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co. In tracing the originality requirement back to the Copyright Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the Court observed that “[o]riginal, as the term is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.” The modern requirement of originality therefore embodies two distinct components. First, the work must “owe[] its origin” to the claimant (i.e., the author); and second, it must exhibit a “modicum of creativity,” a requirement that is fairly easy to satisfy in practice even though it appears to connote a higher bar in theory.\n\nOn the face of things, originality thus appears to directly—and overtly—embody a dimension of authorial causation. Indeed, in the mod­ern context, some scholars argue that originality is “synonymous with authorship.” The emphasis on the work–author connection (“owe”) and a creative contribution appear to corroborate that proposi­tion. Yet closer scrutiny of the modern understanding of the require­ment post-Feist reveals the causal underpinnings of originality to be largely superficial and perhaps even nonexistent.\n\nWhile originality does require that the work “owe” its origin to its author —suggesting scrutiny of how, when, and where the author brought the work into existence—in practice, the owing is more of a negative requirement. Ultimately, courts have deemed the requirement satisfied whenever the work is “independently created” by its author, which amounts to no more than a requirement that the author not have “copied” the work from any other work or material. The owing requirement is thus a simple noncopying mandate rather than an affirmative requirement of some active contribution on the part of the claimant—something that Feist appears to acknowledge. Once satisfied that the author did not copy the work from other works or materials, and that the author is asserting a claim to the originality manifested in such work or materials, courts almost never scrutinize the creative process itself to ask whether and how the author brought the work into existence. Judge Jerome Frank put this point most starkly when he noted that the requirement is “little more than a prohibition of actual copying” and that “[n]o matter how poor the ‘author’s’ addition, it is enough if it be his own.” While Judge Frank did later add that the author had to “adopt” the work as his own for this purpose (especially when the originality was “unintentional[]”), this adoption requirement suggests no more than a requirement of affirmative assertion rather than any scrutiny of its underlying basis or legitimacy. The owing element thus performs a largely negative—or exclusionary—function, of denying a work protection when shown to have been copied from another. Authorial causation is thus readily presumed as long as there is no copying.\n\nAdditionally, Feist explicitly rejected the “sweat of the brow” interpretation of originality, which would have rewarded industriousness on the part of the author. Instead, the court emphasized that the creativity—mandated by the originality requirement—had to be found in the choices and decisions made by the author, manifested in the work itself rather than in the creative process. Creativity is thus measured by its manifestation as an act of authorship, which in turn precludes any reliance on “skill, training, knowledge and judgment” that cannot be discerned from the work itself. This approach has obvious benefits, especially as a probative matter, in keeping indistinguishable variations of a work that may have been produced through purely creative means out of the realm of protection. Yet, in terms of causation, it poses obvious problems. By precluding any scrutiny of the creative process involved in the production of a work when that process has no direct embodiment in the final product (i.e., the work), the originality doctrine denies courts the ability to scrutinize the author’s causal contribution to the work.\n\nOriginality therefore does very little for authorial causation. Even if originality is “synonymous” with authorship today, its connection to the functional dimension of authorship—as embodying a causal element—is at best superficial. Indeed, one might go further by noting that this superficial connection has been actively detrimental to copyright’s commit­ment to authorial causation, insofar as the originality require­ment falsely suggests that it embodies a scrutiny of causation (“owes”) but all too readily presumes the question away.\n\nThe monkey-selfie episode aptly illustrates this superficiality. Recall that the photograph in the monkey-selfie episode was presumptively denied copyright protection on the theory that it was the monkey—rather than the photographer—who had pressed the shutter button. Given the absence of an “authorship” doctrine in copyright, one might believe that originality provided the system with a basis for the denial. On further consideration, however, originality would have had little to say about the photograph. To begin with, the photograph clearly satisfied the claim that it “owes” its existence to the photographer. It certainly was not copied from another source (i.e., it was independently cre­ated). The fact that it owes its existence to the monkey—rather than the photographer—is of little concern to originality, since the doctrine requires only independent creation in the noncopying sense of the term. To use Judge Frank’s words, the photographer’s contribution may have been “poor,” yet it was “his own.”\n\nAdditionally, the requisite “modicum of creativity” was apparent on the face of the photograph, which would satisfy the originality criteria set forth by the various photography cases. The photograph was no “ordinary production”; it involved specific lighting, zooming, position­ing, and timing, all of which are inputs that one may glean from the work itself and that operate as indicia of originality for photo­graphs. The photographer’s button-pressing activity (or the lack thereof), which was the real basis for the denial, thus would not have been subject to scrutiny under originality’s minimal-creativity standard, being detached from any outward manifestations in the photograph itself. Indeed, short of the photographer explaining how the photograph was produced, copyright law would have provided no basis whatsoever to deny the work protection.\n\nUnder current originality doctrine, then, the monkey selfie would obtain copyright protection without issue. Assuming that there is some valid basis for the legal conclusion that it ought not to receive protec­tion—such as a concern with authorial causation—originality simply does not provide the law with any way to address that concern. Even if originality is otherwise a notional stand-in for authorship in the modern context, it does so through the “work of authorship” construct and not as authorship qua act of authoring.\n\nB. Joint Works\n\nThe joint works doctrine allows multiple authors to simultaneously qualify as coauthors of a work, even in the absence of an express agreement between them. The Copyright Act defines a joint work as one “prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.” However, courts developed the law relating to joint works almost entirely on their own with very little legislative guidance. The sparse legislative history accompanying the statutory definition emphasizes that the defining feature of joint authorship is the relevant parties’ “intention, at the time the writing is done, that the parts be absorbed or combined into an integrated unit.” Courts have, as a result, come to pay close attention to this requirement in giving effect to the doctrine.\n\nAs should be apparent, the joint works doctrine allows multiple parties to claim the status of author, albeit jointly. Consequently, even if modern judges have cared very little about policing authorship in the abstract, in relation to this particular doctrine, copyright law effectively requires that each party independently qualify as an author. The joint works doctrine therefore essentially tests authorship as a precondition to a work being protected as a joint work. Based on copyright jurispru­dence’s historic—but hidden—resort to causal principles, then, one might legitimately expect courts’ application of the doctrine to incorpo­rate elements of authorial causation as part of their authorship analyses. However, to the extent that causation has factored into courts’ analyses, it has mostly worked beneath the surface.\n\nParsing the statutory definition of a joint work and its legislative history, courts have understood the joint works doctrine to embody two interrelated requirements. First, each party or claimant must have contributed protectable expression to the final work. Since authorship requires the production of expression (as opposed to mere ideas), courts have seen joint authorship—as a category of authorship—as requiring nothing less. While the expressive contribution need not be inde­pendently copyrightable, it must qualify for protection in principle. Second, the parties need to have had an intention to be joint authors, a requirement that is often described as that of “mutual intent.” Once both elements are satisfied, each joint author obtains an equal ownership stake in the work, regardless of the amount or quality of expressive contribution made to its creation. This last point bears emphasis: A contributor to a 1,000-page original book who contributes a mere page or two of original content automatically obtains a per capita share in the ownership of the copyright in the book if the creation of the work evinces the requisite mutual intent. This consequential reality of the doctrine may seem innocuous at first. Yet in practice, it exerts a potentially enormous influence on courts’ willingness to qualify an unequal contributor as a joint author, even when in principle the doctrine necessitates according the contributor such status.\n\nUnsurprisingly, courts’ preferred mechanism for policing authorship status in joint works is not an independent-contribution requirement. Instead, courts do so through the mutual intent requirement. To give effect to this requirement, courts have developed various “objective indicia” through which to assess the existence of such intent, although in reality, these indicia work as external, objective measures of author­ship. These indicia include control and decisionmaking authority, the way in which the parties characterize or bill themselves, agreements with third parties, and copyright registration. Assuming that each of these indicators provides objective evidence of the parties’ thinking at the time of creation, courts have used them to find either for or against the existence of joint authorship.\n\nIn reality, however, these objective indicia have at best a tangential connection to the parties’ intent accompanying the creation of the work. The element of control, for instance, says very little about the presence or absence of such intent. Two or more collaborators may well possess the required intent to be joint authors, while nonetheless agreeing that one of them—for reasons of expertise or expediency—is to exercise sole control or decisionmaking authority during the production of the work. In such situations, the absence of diffuse control over the process (or the presence of unilateral control) says less about intent than it does about the law’s (i.e., courts’) willingness to accord the noncontrolling party the status of author. In short, control and the other indicia function as proxies not for intent but for the question of whether the creation of the (joint) work ought to be ascribed to a particular party based on that party’s role in the creative process—a question of causation.\n\nA prominent case applying the indicia illustrates this well. In Aalmuhammed v. Lee, the defendants were the director and producers of the well-known motion picture Malcolm X. The primary defendant, Spike Lee, had authored the screenplay and directed and coproduced the movie. During production, the lead actor in the movie, Denzel Washington, asked the plaintiff to “assist him in his preparation for the starring role” due to the plaintiff’s expertise on Malcolm X and Islam. Agreeing to Washington’s request, the plaintiff “suggested extensive script revisions” to ensure historical and religious accuracy, many of which were included in the final version. He also presented uncontro­verted evidence that he created two entirely new scenes, translated Arabic into English, supplied voice-overs for several scenes, selected “proper prayers” for some scenes, and even edited portions of the motion picture following production. The plaintiff had no written agreement with the defendants but received compensation for his efforts. When the producers later credited him merely as an Islamic consultant, he claimed to be a coauthor of the movie and filed an action under the joint works doctrine for an accounting and share of the movie’s profits.\n\nIn reviewing the matter, the Ninth Circuit conceded that the plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to establish an expressive contribution to the work, satisfying the first prong of the joint works doctrine. All the same, the court concluded that he did not qualify as an author of the work even though he made “substantial and valuable contributions” and perhaps even a “substantial creative contribution.” Relying on Burrow-Giles for its understanding of the author as the “effective cause” of the work, the court, placing great emphasis on the requirement of “mutual intent,” concluded that superintendence over the work “by exercising control” over its production was critical to joint authorship. Control, to the court, was “the most important factor,” and since the plaintiff did not have superintendence or control of the work (or indeed any other evidence of mutual intent), he did not qualify as a (joint) author of the work. In essence, the court converted the intent requirement into a proxy for causation—and did so rather explicitly. Control was—the court effectively conceded—central to intent in order to show authorial causation and therefore authorship. Aalmuhammed is but an extreme—and honest—illustration of what other courts continue to do less overtly.\n\nScholars have criticized the Aalmuhammed decision on a variety of grounds. For present purposes, though, the opinion is also troubling because it attempts to mask the causal question that is central to joint authorship behind the idea of mutual intent, a requirement that lawmakers designed to assess the existence of a particular collaborative mindset in the production of the work. As should be obvious, of consequence to the court was the fact that even though the plaintiff had made some contribution to the work, that contribution was negligible com­pared to that of the defendants, and yet the joint works doctrine would have entitled the plaintiff to an equal ownership share in the work. What the court was really asking, then, was whether the plaintiff’s contribution should be treated as a cause for the work as a whole, in light of the obvious consequence at stake—namely, equal ownership. Although the court answered this in the negative, it chose to do so under the garb of mutual intent rather than directly.\n\nIn this domain, the causal inquiry is principally relative and evaluative, rather than absolute and epistemic. The causal question is clearly imbued with an evaluative dimension. The assessment is not merely whether something can be attributed to a party as a factual matter but instead whether it should be so attributed in light of the conse­quences that follow. Other courts have, in similar fashion, employed the mutual intent analysis to arrive at a different outcome when satisfied that a party’s contributions were sufficiently causal for the person to qualify as co-responsible for the entire final product.\n\nThe joint works doctrine thus incorporates a distinct causal dimension, which courts only ever operationalize through the mutual intent analysis. In scrutinizing the process of creation in some detail, copyright law here is in effect examining the causal sufficiency of each party’s contribution to the final work to see if each party merits a coequal characterization as author of the work. While authorial causation is therefore a core component of the inquiry, it remains well hidden underneath the metaphysics of mutual intent and is almost never openly addressed as such.\n\nC. Works Made for Hire\n\nA third area in which copyright doctrine indirectly engages the question of authorial causation is the work made for hire doctrine. The work made for hire doctrine allows copyright law to accord authorial (and ownership) status to one party when another created the work in its entirety. The law allows this imputation in three scenarios: first, when one party has commissioned a work from another and the parties expressly agree to treat the work as a work made for hire; second, when a formal employment arrangement exists and the employee created the work within the scope of the employment; and third, when an employ­ment arrangement may be implied from the nature of the relationship between the parties.\n\nIt is important to appreciate that the doctrine does not merely effect an implied transfer of ownership. It is instead a doctrine of first author­ship, under which the employer (or commissioning party) is treated as the author and creator of the work from the moment that the work obtains copyright protection. And underlying the doctrine’s treatment of authorship is a nascent—and undoubtedly controversial—account of causation. As noted previously, early copyright law did not recognize an employer as author of a work merely based on the employment relation­ship. This position continued into the late nineteenth century. As Professor Catherine Fisk documents in her exhaustive historical analysis of the work made for hire doctrine, it was at this juncture—the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—that things began to change.\n\nChanges in the U.S. economy at the time, accompanied by the increasing popularity of the corporate form, produced a gradual willingness among courts to treat corporate employers as authors under copyright law. These cases all seemed to commit to a rather fundamental idea—namely, that because the employer had invested monetarily in the production of the work by hiring employees who actually executed the project, that investment was sufficient to generate a claim of authorship. The monetary investment, in other words, was deemed causally relevant and sufficient to produce the status of author. One early court put the point most starkly: “The complainant’s [i.e., employer’s] money paid for the painting; its artist colored it; its president designed it, his was the ‘originating, inventive, and master mind.’”\n\nTo be sure, some observers have noted an “artificiality” in the work for hire doctrine’s treatment of the employer as author even when the employer has played no role whatsoever in the actual creative process. The doctrine, in this understanding, has more to do with facilitating “investment and exploitation” than any commitment to authorship principles. While this characterization may indeed be accurate, this artificiality does not necessarily negate the doctrine’s underlying account of authorial causation. Insofar as such causation is more than just epistemic and embodies normative considerations—that is, the evaluative dimension—one might fairly see the doctrine as specify­ing a causal nexus. As shall become apparent, this causal nexus forms a symmetrical analog to the causal theory underlying tort law’s doctrine of vicarious liability.\n\nIn describing the work made for hire doctrine, Professor Peter Jaszi argues that it takes copyright’s concept of authorship to its instrumental extreme and adopts the logic that “[i]f the essence of ‘authorship’ is inspiration, then it is the ‘employer’s’ contribution as the ‘motivating factor’ behind that work . . . that matters.” Insofar as authorial causation—embodied in authorship—always entailed an instrumental and evaluative dimension, however, the work made for hire doctrine is hardly an aberration from that framework.\n\nThe work made for hire doctrine thus represents an additional domain in which copyright jurisprudence embodies an important causal aspect. Unlike in other areas, however, here the doctrine itself articulates and assumes a specific causal paradigm, wherein the law automatically imputes authorial causation to one actor merely by virtue of a relationship without any need for independent evidence (of causation). The doctrine thus renders the epistemic dimension of authorial causation fairly thin (and close to nonexistent, but for the need to show an employment relationship or contract) in the process.\n\n* * *\n\nAuthorial causation is hardly alien to modern copyright law. It remains embedded in copyright’s various doctrinal devices, in which its role and significance fluctuates with the vagaries of how the particular doctrine (in which it resides) grows and evolves. Given the originality doctrine’s modern rejection of “sweat of the brow” and its limited focus on noncopying and independent creation to determine origination, authorial causation has no doctrinal platform to function as a threshold qualification criterion in general copyright law. The same is true of the joint works doctrine, in which the law’s enduring focus on mutual intent to reconstruct the creative process masks the role of authorial causation, and courts rarely even acknowledge causation as a motivating considera­tion during their analyses. Within the work made for hire doctrine, authorial causation plays a principally structural role, insofar as it forms the very foundation for the doctrine and its default of employer owner­ship, on the assumption that the relevant relationship exists between the parties.\n\nAuthorial causation, then, in both its epistemic and evaluative aspects, as well as its relative and absolute ones, is hidden within copyright doctrine. Whenever courts need to directly address the causation question—as in the monkey-selfie episode or with machine creation —they are left without any doctrinal device to aid their analyses, forcing them to fall back on first principles—a move that some observers may in turn see as suspect given the otherwise comprehensive nature of copyright doctrine. An express acknowledgement of authorial causation within copyright jurisprudence—and allowing its various components (epistemic–evaluative, etc.) to work freely within the system—would therefore better serve copyright law. The next Part turns to this ideal.\n\nIII. Copyrightable Causation\n\nHaving seen how copyright jurisprudence embodies a commitment to identifying the appropriate human cause for the creation of a work and the ways in which modern copyright doctrine prevents that causal inquiry from rising to the surface, this Part moves to the prescriptive and advances a proposal to remedy this anomaly. Building on copyright’s latent theory of authorial causation, this Part suggests a mechanism by which copyright analysis and reasoning might fruitfully make authorial causation—in both its epistemic and evaluative aspects—a part of the copyrightability analysis for original works of expression.\n\nDetermining whether a work of expression is eligible for copyright protection today—otherwise known as the question of “copyrighta­bility”—entails examining the work to ensure that it contains protectable expression (as opposed to ideas and other excluded content); that it meets the originality requirement; and that it otherwise complies with the requirements of the Copyright Act (e.g., fixation). The inquiry into copyrightability, in other words, is limited to a scrutiny of the four corners of the work and no more. The particulars of the process through which the author has created the work are, according to this account of copyrightability, largely irrelevant. Much of this myopia very likely derives from modern copyright law’s conception of originality, which forces courts to ignore the creative process and limit themselves to expressive manifestations within the work.\n\nWhile this limit may make sense for originality after Feist, it is hardly a limiting principle that demands adherence across all of copyright’s eligibility criteria. Indeed, copyright doctrine itself contemplates situations in which a scrutiny of factors other than the content of the work becomes essential to determine copyrightability. The prime example of this is U.S. government works, which the Copyright Act denies protection altogether. Bare scrutiny of the work itself is likely to yield little information about its eligibility for protection, which instead relates to the identity of its author. It is only when a party has produced additional information about the work’s creation (e.g., the identity of its author, the circumstances of its creation, etc.) that the exclusion kicks in. Consequently, it is no major analytical stretch to require that a condition of copyrightability originate outside the contours of the work itself, specifically in the process through which the author brings the work into existence. This is precisely how copyright doctrine ought to address authorial causation.\n\nAuthorial causation is therefore best addressed within copyright jurisprudence as an independent condition of eligibility for protection: copyrightable causation. For a work to qualify for copyright protection as a work of authorship, the work would have to be the result of human agency that is treated as causally relevant to, and sufficient for, copyright law. Much like copyright’s several other conditions for copyrightability, the burden of establishing copyrightable causation would be on the plaintiff or claimant seeking protection, as part of the plaintiff’s prima facie case. In an action for copyright infringement, the law places the burden of establishing ownership of a “valid copyright” on a plaintiff, which would now encompass copyrightable causation as an additional facet. And much like the law’s other copyrightability requirements (e.g., originality or subject matter), copyrightable causation is unlikely to be a contested issue in an overwhelming majority of cases. Only when the matter is contested, or when presented with evidence that calls the existence of such causation into question, would a court be required to resolve the matter as a precursor to the infringement inquiry. This would in turn allow the law to retain its de facto assumption of copyrightability by default, which in turn sustains copyright’s system of automatic protection.\n\nIn situations in which a court must resolve the issue of causation, copyright jurisprudence would benefit from a framework for giving effect to the copyrightable-causation requirement. In developing this frame­work, negligence law sheds important light on how the causal inquiry might be bifurcated, so as to keep the epistemic and evaluative aspects of the inquiry relatively distinct. The common law’s well-known divide between the “cause in fact” and “proximate causation” inquiries serves as a useful model that courts might adapt to the requirements of copyright law. The remainder of this Part attempts to build on that model and develop a two-step mechanism for copyrightable causation. Section III.A begins by looking to the basic structural ideas behind tort law’s approach to causation to show how it embodies important symme­tries for the working of copyrightable causation. Sections III.B and III.C then attempt to integrate the equivalents of the cause in fact and proximate cause steps into the working of copyrightable causation in order to give effect to copyright’s theory of authorial causation.\n\nA. Basic Structure: The Tort Law Analogy\n\nThe question of causation has been a source of much disagreement and theorizing in the world of tort law for nearly a century now. Indeed, the literature on the role and test of causation therein is far too extensive to allow for a compact synthesis here. Nonetheless, the struc­tural features of tort (i.e., negligence) law’s operationalization of the causal inquiry is of direct relevance for copyright law. The law’s efforts to hold an actor responsible for a particular consequence (i.e., harm) that deserves rectification is widely accepted to drive tort law’s understanding of causation as a component of liability determination. Causation is therefore indelibly connected to responsibility. This connection in­flects the causal determination with points of emphasis that an abstract (purely scientific) conception of the idea might otherwise lack.\n\nIt is indeed the centrality of this connection that forces the courts to look for, and classify, a human act as the cause of relevance from a host of background conditions. Some scholars refer to this as the idea of “causal selection,” a view that is traced back to John Stuart Mill. The causal-selection theory readily acknowledges that this selection process has no universally objective basis but is instead pragmatic in content and situation driven. Causal selection understands tort law’s identification of an act as a cause as driven by the law’s attempt to apportion blame for a consequence on a human actor. Causation in tort law therefore takes shape from a nascent understanding of responsibility or blame­worthiness—ideas that embody an account of moral agency, however deep or shallow that account may be as an independent substantive matter. Identifying an actor’s intervention as a cause in tort law’s liability calculus therefore is accompanied and driven by the understand­ing that the actor’s rational agency is worthier than the various back­ground conditions of being selected as the cause of the event. This causation–responsibility connection is therefore an enduring feature of tort law’s approach to the question of causation.\n\nHowever, this connection is far more important as a phenome­nological observation about the nature of the causal inquiry. Most fundamentally, it reveals that the question of causation—regardless of the particular setting within which it is employed—is indelibly purposive in content and operation. The ultimate purpose of the inquiry motivates and informs the identification and selection of a factor or condition as a cause. This point is largely unexceptional but rarely acknowledged. In his well-known discussion of factual causation in tort law, Professor Wex Malone thus made the following observation:\n\n[T]he evaluation which the trier will make of the new fact data will necessarily be affected by the purpose he is seeking to serve. This is particularly true of cause, which, as we have seen, is merely an acceptable deduction from evidential facts. All deductions are drawn purposively—that is to say, they are drawn for a reason.\n\nMalone went on to illustrate this by showing that for a single occurrence, a physicist’s sense of the cause was likely different from an engineer’s, which might in turn be different from a lawyer’s. The purpose of the inquiry thus guides the construction of causation.\n\nFrom this, Malone—a legal realist—readily inferred that the factual aspect of causation inevitably masked policy decisions and that fact and policy were inextricably linked even in the supposedly factual elements of causation. Yet acknowledging the purposive nature of the inquiry need not negate the existence of a factual basis for it. What Malone’s analysis does reveal is that even the principally epistemic aspects of the causal inquiry are hardly objective in the sense of being universalizable across different contexts and these epistemic elements embody some evaluative content that is driven by the reason for the inquiry. The “cause in fact” aspect of causation in tort law is therefore hardly a search for some objectively verifiable truth (e.g., was the defendant’s car green in color?) but is instead an attempt to select from among a finite set of epistemically verifiable conditions in an effort to affix responsibility for a negative outcome (i.e., the “reason”).\n\nScholars have since come to interpret Malone’s observations as being critical of tort law’s causal inquiry. Nevertheless, his argument provides strong support for tort law’s bifurcation of the causal inquiry: cause in fact and proximate cause. Owing to the purposive nature of the determination, each step certainly involves an epistemic and evaluative component. As Malone himself acknowledged, the degree and nature of evaluation that accompanies each step varies rather significantly. In the first, the purposiveness injects an evaluative component into what appears to be a purely factual determination. But it does so in the con­struction of the inquiry and by altering the salience of particular factual conditions over others, thereby operating as a structural influence. In the second, by contrast, the question of ideal tort policy builds on the conclusion of the first step but individualizes the evaluative component to the facts and circumstances of the case at hand. The proximate cause inquiry is thus less about the abstract purpose of tort law than it is about whether the tort defendant in a given case should—as a matter of tort policy—be deemed causally responsible as a legal matter. Here, it is critical to note that the evaluative component is analytically different in both steps. In the first, it is merely a suggestion that any analysis of facts is driven by an end, while in the latter, it is an overt recognition that the analysis incorporates the goals of the system or regime.\n\nOf the various aspects of causation in tort law that have received scholarly attention, proximate cause undoubtedly remains the most controversial. While related to the factual-causation question, in reality it operates as a doctrine that courts use to limit a defendant’s liability under certain circumstances by determining that the defendant’s actions—even if causally related to the harm—should not be the basis for imposing liability. And to determine proximate causation, they look to the basic normative goals of the system, thereby giving the inquiry an avowedly “policy-oriented” flavor. The specific variables to which courts look range from abstract ideals such as justice and equity to more practical goals such as compensation and deterrence. Courts also look to utilitarian considerations such as risk allocation, as well as deontic ideas such as moral responsibility. All in all, the determination is heavily driven by a subjective judgment that the courts make of whether a defendant should be found responsible for the harm in light of tort law’s myriad goals. Here too, then, the purpose of responsibility affixation motivates the causal investigation—of whether an identified factual cause is proximate enough to engender liability—but manifests itself in a determination that is specific to the defendant.\n\nThese basic structural ideas are illuminating for copyright law. Copyrightable causation need not be seen as a purely objective or scientific inquiry that is true across situation and context. Nor, of course, should courts treat it as an entirely vacuous concept that is devoid of all verifiable analytical content and subject to covert manipulation. Building on the insights that legal realism has brought to bear on the understand­ing of causation in other areas of law, courts might fruitfully bifurcate copyrightable causation. In the first prong, the epistemic content—driven by the purpose of the inquiry—would dominate, and in the second prong, normative considerations would play a more direct role. Separating the inquiry into two steps allows for full consideration and independent analytical scrutiny of each of the epistemic and evaluative domains, even if one considers their boundaries somewhat porous. The remainder of this Part thus turns to constructing this bifurcated inquiry, building on the architecture of the causal determination in tort law.\n\nB. Creation in Fact\n\nThe first step of the copyrightable-causation requirement would look for an epistemic basis to causally relate the work in question to an actor’s creative actions. In essence, this step would track tort law’s cause in fact requirement. Notably, identifying—and selecting—a condition as the “cause” for the work is not a purely objective or universal determination; it is instead driven by the purpose of the inquiry as a whole.\n\nTo reiterate, it is important not to confuse “purpose” with policy considerations or normative goals. The reference to purpose is simply an acknowledgement of Mill’s unexceptional point that causality can be an unending sequence and that some ultimate purpose always drives even the factual identification of a cause. As an illustration, consider a murder investigation. It would be insufficient to simply conclude that the cause of death was poisoning without going further and identifying the human agent who committed that act. Our very understanding of cause—in relation to a homicide investigation—involves a focus on a human agent, in an effort to hold someone responsible. Identifying a human agent is thus the purpose of the causal inquiry.\n\nSo it is with tort law too. Whereas tort law uses causation to affix liability, copyright law’s identification of the cause originates in its need to attribute authorship and assign ownership. This purpose would exert an obvious influence on the structure and content of the inquiry. In contrast to tort law, copyright’s authorship determination allocates an exclusive entitlement over expression to the causally responsible individual. Devoid of such purpose, copyright’s creation-in-fact inquiry is likely to be of little utility to authorship.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court’s current understanding, copyright law grants its exclusionary entitlem"
