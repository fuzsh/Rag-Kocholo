        "meta_description": "Cet article retrace l’évolution du genre « adaptation » à partir du Moyen âge jusqu’au XXIe siècle et met en lumière des corrélations intéressantes entre les processus de traduction et d’adaptation. Jusqu’au XVIIIe siècle, l’adaptation était considérée comme un sous-genre de la traduction, souvent utilisé par les traducteurs et écrivains pour mettre en valeur leur créativité et affiner leur talent littéraire. L’adaptation était vue comme un moyen d’enrichir la littérature. Or, de nos jours, la terminologie employée par certains critiques ressemble trop souvent au jargon utilisé dans un tribunal. Des termes tels que violation, viol, tromperie, infidélité, trahison, tricherie, duperie, vol, sont fréquemment usités pour décrire les adaptations littéraires au lieu de mettre l’accent sur leurs contributions artistiques. Etant donné que les traductions et adaptations suggèrent l’existence de textes primaires, elles sont rarement examinées pour leurs propres mérites esthétiques mais opposées aux « œuvres originales sacrées.» Il en résulte que l’adaptation et la traduction sont souvent considérées comme des formes de création inférieures et n’échappent pas à ce que Barbara Folkart nomme « l’effet d’entropie » ou lente dégradation d’une œuvre originale et, en conséquence, sont rarement évaluées en termes de créativité et d’originalité. Cet article explore les raisons à l’origine de l’évolution des mentalités et souligne l’importance de la rupture épistémologique qui a eu lieu au XVIIIe siècle, modifiant à jamais notre conception de l’adaptation littéraire.",

        "text": "2Usually, we associate translation with bilingualism and polyglotism. Foreign language teachers, translators, interpreters and bilingual speakers readily come to our minds when we think of translation. Foreignness, difference, fear, cultural mores and customs are all imbedded in the term. Yet, there is another type of translation we practice on a daily basis in our dealings with friends, colleagues and relatives. We resort to this type of translation when we feel the need to explain or clarify a concept, reword a complex sentence or make us better understood by children, students etc. All instructors, parents, administrators, technicians, politicians, ordinary citizens, and writers use this strategy to improve the communication of a message. In 1963, Roman Jakobson coined the expression “intra-lingual translation” to define this particular adaptational mode of communication.\n\n3Comparison of literary adaptation and translation can help us better comprehend the transformational process at the core of these practices at three different levels, namely: etymological, cultural and linguistic. The first relationship I would like to establish is concerned with etymology, for as we shall see, retracing the origins of the word gives us a better understanding of the evolution of adaptation as a genre. Borrowed from the Latin word “adaptatio,”which was associated with a particular type of translation involving a certain degree of creativity, adaptation carried the idea of transformation, adjustment and appropriation when it first appeared during the 13th century. Douglas Kelly claims that:\n\n2 Douglas Kelly, “Translatio Studii: Translation, Adaptation, and Allegory in Medieval French Litera (...)\n\nThere are three prominent modes of translatio in medieval French: translation as such, including scribal transmission; adaptation; and allegorical or extended metaphorical discourse. In each case, a source, an extant materia surviving from the past, is re-done by a new writer who is, in effect, the translator .\n\n4Translation is closely linked to the concept of creation in the form of updating or recycling of ideas. In the Middle Ages, there is no dichotomy between writer and translator and the practice of translation allows some originality. On the contrary, we can detect a deep sense of collaboration and admiration. Often seen as an extension of the author’s view as well as a communion of spirits, the translator writes as the author might have written had he lived in the translator’s days and age. Translation is viewed as a positive practice and is associated with the ideas of invention and originality. Douglas Kelly remarks:\n\n3 Ibidem.\n\nTranslatio is a diversified and fundamental characteristic of medieval composition, of its history and import. Topical invention is the means for translatio in the Middle Ages. The artful elaboration of true or credible arguments at suitable points in a given source, the whole process in keeping with the idea or ideas the author seeks to show forth through the work’s representations—such topical invention translates, transfers the past to the present .\n\n7Knowledge does not depend on imitation or cloning but on the translator’s ability to adapt and communicate cultural materials appropriately. Described as a “mode of translation” (see Kelly) or sub-genre relying primarily on the transformation and updating of source texts, adaptation often contributes to the enrichment of language and to the building of a domestic literature representative of the nation. During the 16th century, in La Défense et Illustration de la Langue Française, even though he does not use the term “adaptation,” Du Bellay himself urges poets to enrich their language by drawing ideas from the Romans who had themselves translated the Greeks:\n\n11 Joachim Du Bellay, J. Du Bellay. Choix, Notice Biographique par Alphonse Séché, Paris: Louis Micha (...)\n\nSi les Romains (dira quelqu’un) n’ont vaqué à ce labeur de traduction, par quels moyens donc ont-ils pu ainsi enrichir leur langue, voir jusqu’à l’égaler quasi à la grecque? Imitant les meilleurs auteurs grecs, se transformant en eux, les dévorant; et, après les avoir bien digérés, les convertissant en sang et nourriture: se proposant, chacun selon son naturel et l’argument qu’il voulait élire, le meilleur auteur, dont ils observaient diligemment toutes les plus rares et exquises vertus, et icelles comme greffes, ainsi que j’ai dit devant, entaient et appliquaient à leur langue. Cela fait (dis-je) les Romains ont bâti tous ces beaux écrits que nous louons et admirons si fort .\n\n15 Lori Chamberlain, “Gender and the Metaphorics of Translation,” Difference in Translation, Ed. Jose (...)\n\nThe sexualization of translation appears perhaps most familiarly in the tag les belles infidels; like women, the adage goes, translations should be either beautiful or unfaithful. The tag is made possible both by the rhyme in French and by the fact that the word traduction is a feminine one, thus making les beaux infidèles impossible .\n\n10The dichotomy between beauty and fidelity, aesthetics and accuracy implies that beautiful translations are often unfaithful and that unaesthetic translations are not necessarily faithful. This divorce based on seemingly irreconcilable differences precludes any compromise between beauty and fidelity while stressing the importance of decision-making. Although the concept of “original” is lurking beneath the surface, priority is given to originality and creativity, for it is believed that a writer can develop his skills and beautify domestic literature through adaptational translation. As Chamberlain stresses:\n\n17 Lorrie Chamberlain, “Gender and the Metaphorics of Translation,” op. cit., 58.\n\nLes belles infidèles, fidelity is defined by an implicit contract between translation (as woman) and original (as husband, father, or author). However, the infamous double standard operates here as it might have in traditional marriages: the unfaithful wife is publicly tried for crimes the husband/original is by law incapable of committing. This contract in short makes it impossible for the original to be guilty of infidelity. Such attitude betrays real anxiety about the problem of paternity and translation; it mimics the patrilineal kinship system where paternity—not maternity—legitimizes an offspring .\n\nThis attitude toward translation undermines the responsibility of translators since the emphasis is on female infidelity (translation as instigator of infidelity) and not on the translator who performed the translation (most likely to be a male).\n\n12The expression “on savait” (it was known), is in line with Bassnett’s concept of collusion and appears as an unofficial—but well-concerted—effort to overlook differences. It also emphasizes the public’s taste for derivative works meeting the aesthetic trends of audiences. Les Belles Infidèles illustrates the need for importing foreign literature through acculturation of “cultural capital” (see Lefevere) as well as through linguistic and aesthetic remolding. In a study dedicated to the evolution of “The European Picaresque Novel in the 17th and 18th Centuries” Hendrick van Gorp writes:\n\n20 Hendrick Van Gorp, “Translation and Literary Genre: The European Picaresque Novel in the 17th and (...)\n\nAround 1620 the translations become noticeably freer and move to an “acceptable” or target-oriented type of equivalence, reflecting the growing self-confidence and assertiveness of French culture at the time. The translators apply French cultural and social norms and take their bearings from the leading writers of their own country. Although at first the greater freedom manifests itself at the level of language and style only, soon the development of the story is adapted to current target norms too. The initial situation undergoes little change, but the plot is accommodated in such a way that amorous adventures overshadow social criticism and the protagonist’s material needs. Conspicuous are the changes made to the endings of a number of novels. In line with the fashion in ‘regular’ novels of the period, translations are given a “happy ending” incompatible with the element of disillusion and the typical “open ending” of the original novela picaresca .\n\n14Racine acknowledges having read Hippolyte by Euripides and Phèdre by Seneca, but to this intermingling of sources, he adds his final touch. In his preface to Phèdre, Racine admits having manipulated the text in order to make it more appropriate and attractive to his audience:\n\n24 Jean Racine, Théâtre II, Paris: Garnier Flammarion, 1965, 197-198.\n\nJ’ai même pris soin de la [Phèdre] rendre un peu moins odieuse qu’elle n’est dans les tragédies des Anciens, où elle se résout d’elle-même à accuser Hippolyte. J’ai cru que la calomnie avait quelque chose de trop bas et de trop noir pour la mettre dans la bouche d’une princesse qui a d’ailleurs des sentiments si nobles et si vertueux. Cette bassesse m’a paru plus convenable à une nourrice, qui pouvait avoir des inclinations plus serviles, et qui néanmoins n’entreprend cette fausse accusation que pour sauver la vie et l’honneur de sa maîtresse. Phèdre n’y donne les mains que parce qu’elle est dans une agitation d’esprit qui la met hors d’elle-même, et elle vient un moment après dans le dessein de justifier l’innocence et de déclarer la vérité.\n\nHippolyte est accusé, dans Euripide et dans Sénèque, d’avoir en effet violé sa belle-mère: Vim corpus tulit. Mais il n’est ici accusé que d’en avoir eu le dessein. J’ai voulu épargner à Thésée une confusion qui l’aurait pu rendre moins agréable aux spectateurs .\n\n15Combining eloquence with higher thoughts, Racine follows the tenets of classical drama by teaching while entertaining. The alexandrine verse form that gives a particular rhythm to the play exemplifies the beauty of the language as well as the grandeur and eloquence of the characters in a purified style imprinted with moralist overtones. Many similar examples are to be found during the same period in other authors such as Corneille and even Molière in Dom Juan.\n\n16Strongly influenced by the idea of “bon usage,” playwrights, like translators/adaptors, exercise censorship to avoid what might be perceived as vulgarity or unacceptable behaviour and do not hesitate to make additions to meet the needs of their contemporary audience. Aesthetics triumphs over accuracy and fidelity. Even though detractors criticize some translators for their lack of accuracy, during the 17th century the mainstream favours psychological, physical and linguistic grandeur in art over graphic representation and language.\n\n17In L’Originalité, Roland Mortier explores the origins of the word originality and demonstrates how in the 17th century “originality” meant paradoxically departing from an original text. Mortier explains how French Classicism’s desire to replace nature by beautiful nature led the authors to investigate innovative modes of expression, such as rewriting Greek plays in alexandrines.\n\n18The exploration of 17th century theatrical adaptations is of particular interest, for it implies the ideas of performance and “performability”—inherent in film adaptation—to use the terms of Susan Bassnett. In an article titled “Still Trapped in the Labyrinth: Further Reflections on Translation and Theatre,” Bassnett argues that:\n\n26 Susan Bassnet, “Still Trapped in the Labyrinth: Further Reflections on Translation and Theatre,” 9 (...)\n\nThe translator of dramatic texts is expected to grapple not only with the eternal problem of “faithfulness”, however that may be interpreted, but also with the problem of what the relationship between the written and the performed may be. “Performability” offers a way out of the dilemma, since it allows the translator to take greater liberties with the text than many might deem acceptable, in the interests of the end product of “performability.” The term thus justifies translation strategies, in the same way as terms such as “adaptation”or “version” which have never been clearly defined either, are also used to justify or explain certain strategies that may involve degrees of divergence from the source text .\n\nSuch connections, between the notions of “performability” and “adaptation” used as justifications to compensate for a lack of accuracy along with the absence of definition of these terms, are of paramount importance. The use of words such as version, performability, adaptation and transposition are as many clues pointing to feelings of fault, shame and treason inherited from the philosophers of the Enlightenment. The need to justify one’s choices, which also implies the idea of guilt, tends to undermine the prestige of an art that is no longer in tune with 18th century philosophy.\n\n19Indeed, during that period we notice a change of attitude characterized by a strong desire of individualization (already on the rise in the 16th century) and a slight detachment from God. Man no longer takes things for granted but asks ontological and philosophical questions that no longer find a definite answer in God. Le Neveu de Rameau by Diderot in which the protagonist asks apparently naïve questions to which the philosopher has no simple answers exemplifies this epistemological shift entailing a permanent questioning of established knowledge. During the 18th century, this role reversal of the Socratic model where the pupil sometimes appears to be more refined and knowledgeable than his master illustrates a new freedom of thinking that destabilizes hierarchical power and universal knowledge. Power relationships are overturned in many areas (literature, philosophy, politics, etc.) and the constant questioning of universals opens the ways to a new epistemology based on fragmentation. In politics, fragmentation is achieved through power delegation and by giving citizens a stronger sense of personal responsibility. In philosophy and literature, it is illustrated by a desire to bring a personal contribution to society by exposing any institutional wrongdoings. Personal testimonies, exemplified by Diderot’s La Religieuse and epistolary novels such as Laclos’s Les LiaisonsDangereuses epitomize such a fragmented trend where various perspectives are represented at the same time and where individual voices are represented. Man as an individual takes responsibility for his personal actions and ideas, and in so doing claims his right of ownership. Authors own a privileged moment in the history of ideas, knowledge, literature and the sciences and endeavour to make a difference. Within this context, any adaptation of primary texts is regarded as deceitful and becomes suspicious. Respect for authorial discourse as well as economic concerns such as author’s rights, rights of reproduction, etc. had a devastating effect on literary adaptations and contributed to the depreciation of this genre. In “What is an Author,” Michel Foucault sheds light on this epistemological change and demonstrates its noticeable impact on literature:\n\n27 Michel Foucault, Language, Counter-Memory, Practice, trans. Donald Bouchard, Ithaca: Cornell Unive (...)\n\nIn our culture—undoubtedly in others as well—discourse was not originally a thing, a product, or a possession, but an action situated in a bipolar field of sacred and profane, lawful and unlawful, religious and blasphemous. It was a gesture charged with risks long before it became a possession caught in a circuit of property values. But it was at the moment when a system of ownership and strict copyright rules were established (toward the end of the eighteenth century) that the transgressive properties always intrinsic to the act of writing became the forceful imperative of literature .\n\n31 Lawrence Venuti, The Translator’s Visibility, London: Routledge, 1999, 9.\n\nBritish and American law defines translation as an ‘adaptation’ or ‘derivative’ work based on an ‘original work of authorship,’ whose copyright, including the exclusive right ‘to prepare derivative works’ or ‘adaptation,’ is vested in the ‘author.’ The translator is thus subordinated to the author, who decisively controls the publication of the translation during the term of the copyright for the ‘original’ text, currently the author’s lifetime plus fifty years. Yet, since authorship here is defined as the creation of a form or medium of expression, not an idea, as originality in language, not thought, British and American law permits translations to be copyrighted in the translator’s name, recognizing that the translator uses another language for the foreign text and therefore can be understood as creating an original work. In copyright law, the translator is and is not an author .\n\nGiven this second-rate legal status, undermining his work as well as his rights to authorship, the translator/adaptor occupies a “space in between,” where his right to creativity is challenged and often denied.\n\n24In “Des Tours de Babel” [Babel Towers], Derrida uses the plural intentionally and describes translation as a maturing stage where the “original” text gives birth to another “original” and undergoes a transformation derived from a desire to communicate. By raising the status of the translation to that of an original text, Derrida allows us to consider the process from a new perspective as the author draws our attention to the metonymics of translation and highlights its power of regeneration by deconstructing the word Babel:\n\n36 Jacques Derrida, “Des Tours de Babel,” Difference in Translation, trans. and ed. Joseph Graham, It (...)\n\nBabel: first a proper name, granted. But when we say “Babel” today, do we know what we are naming? Do we know whom? If we consider the survival of a text that is a legacy, the narrative or the myth of the tower of Babel, it does not constitute just one figure among others. Telling at least of the inadequation of one tongue to another, of one place in the encyclopedia to another, of language to itself and to meaning, and so forth, it also tells of the need for figuration, for myth, for tropes, for twists and turns, for translation inadequate to compensate for that which multiplicity denies us. In this sense it would be the myth of the origin of myth, the metaphor of metaphor, the narrative of narrative, the translation of translation, and so on ."
