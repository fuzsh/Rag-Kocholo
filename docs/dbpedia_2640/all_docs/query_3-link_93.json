        "text": "In Argentina, intellectual property of works belongs to the creators for their entire life and to their beneficiaries or assigns for 70 years calculated from January 1st of the year after the creator’s death.\n\nIn Brazil, creators’ economic rights shall be protected for 70 years calculated from January 1st of the year after the creator’s death, subject to the order of succession under civil law.\n\nIn Chile, copyright protection is guaranteed for the creator’s entire life and lasts 70 more years after his/her death.\n\nIn Paraguay, economic rights last for the creator’s entire life and 70 years after his/her death.\n\nIn Uruguay, the creator is holder of the copyright for his whole life and his beneficiaries or assigns are holders of the copyright for 50 years after the creator’s death.\n\nIn Venezuela, copyright lasts for the creator’s entire life and expires after 60 years calculated from January 1st of the year after his/her death, even concerning works not disclosed during his/her life.\n\nCopyright protection is automatic in the EU, as well as in every country that is a signatory to the Berne Convention. Copyright, therefore, arises from the moment of the work’s creation and no registration or other formality is required.\n\nNevertheless, copyright owners may take some measures with the purpose of informing others of the existence of a copyright, reducing the likelihood of a potential infringement. A well-known measure commonly used is to mark copyrighted works with a copyright notice. Usually it includes the copyright symbol (©), followed by the owner’s name and year of the work’s protection.\n\nEven though copyright owners do not have to register copyright, and registration is not a requirement for protection, some national laws allow it. Using these non-mandatory registration systems may prove to be useful in some situations, particularly where proof of possession and creation on a certain date is necessary to legal proceedings. It may also prevent misappropriations of information in negotiations with potential partners, since it shows that said material had already been created.\n\nIn the EU, copyright is generally owned by the natural person who creates the work. In most EU countries, the author or co-authors of a work are the first owners or co-owners of the copyright.\n\nHowever, the IP systems in the EU currently vary between member states that maintain a system of institutional ownership, and those which maintain a system of professor’s privilege (inventor ownership).\n\nIn many countries, when a work is made by an employee in the course of his/her employment, the owner of the work will be stipulated in the employee's contract, usually that the employer owns the any work created in the due course of employment.(e.g. the university would be regarded as the owner of a copyright to a work created by its researcher in the course of their employment, since the latter is paid to perform such a task).\n\nSome countries of the EU have a specific type of \"professor’s privilege\" regime according to which the researchers, PhD students, etc. are entitled by law to the ownership of the work they created in the course of their employment (e.g. in Italy or Sweden). Results of publicly funded research created or developed by researchers are thus owned by the latter and not by the academic institution where the research is carried out.\n\nThere is no formal requirement for the work to be registered in order for copyright to be claimed or recognised. However, a copyright owner may voluntarily register their copyright in Malaysia. Registration is still advisable for foreign SMEs as the registration can be extremely useful in enforcement proceedings to provide evidence of your ownership. To claim copyright ownership (i.e. to forewarn infringement), a notice with the symbol © may also be placed in/on the work followed by the name of the owner and the year of first publication."
