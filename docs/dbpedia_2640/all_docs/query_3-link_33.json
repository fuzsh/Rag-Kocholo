        "text": "What Is Copyright?\n\nCopyright is the legal ownership of intellectual property such as original works of fiction and non-fiction and conveys the right to control its reproduction and distribution.\n\nIn other words, copyright is the right to copy. Only the creator of the work can authorize anyone to reproduce the work.\n\nCopyright law gives creators of original material the exclusive right to use and duplicate that material for a given amount of time. Once a copyright expires, the copyrighted item enters the public domain.\n\nHow Copyrighting Works\n\nIntellectual property is loosely defined as an original or unique product that required significant mental activity to create. Intellectual property can be copyrighted to protect it from misuse or unauthorized distribution.\n\nExamples of unique creations include:\n\nNovels\n\nArt\n\nPoetry\n\nMusical lyrics and compositions\n\nComputer software\n\nGraphic designs\n\nFilms\n\nArchitectural designs\n\nWebsite content\n\nWork That Is Copyrighted\n\nWork must be available in physical form for it to be protected by copyright. Copyright does not protect ideas, discoveries, concepts, or theories although other forms of protection such as patents and trademarks exist for those products. Brand names, logos, slogans, domain names, and titles cannot be protected under copyright law.\n\nFor an original work to be copyrighted, it has to be in tangible form. This means that any speech, discoveries, musical scores, or ideas have to be written down in physical form to qualify for copyright protection.\n\nIn the United States, original owners are protected by copyright laws for life plus 70 years after their death. If the original author of the copyrighted material is a corporation, the copyright protection period is 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years, whichever expires first.\n\nU.S. copyright law has undergone amendments and changes that have altered the duration of copyright protection. The “life of the author plus 70 years” protection dates to the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act, (also known as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act or the Sonny Bono Act), which generally increased copyright protections by 20 years.\n\nCopyright vs. Trademarks and Patents\n\nWhile copyright law is not all-encompassing, other laws, such as patent and trademark laws, may impose additional sanctions. Although copyrights, trademarks, and patents are frequently used interchangeably, they offer different forms of protection for intellectual property.\n\nTrademark laws protect material that is used to distinguish an individual’s or corporation’s work from another entity. These materials include words, phrases, or symbols—such as logos, slogans, and brand names—that copyright laws do not cover.\n\nPatents cover inventions for a limited time. Patented materials include products such as industrial processes, machines, and chemical processes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCopyright law is designed to protect the creators of original material. Their copyrighted work cannot be used or duplicated without their permission. In the United States, copyright usually lasts for 70 years after the creator’s death.\n\nFor work to be protected under copyright law, it must be tangible as well as original. Other forms of legal protection, such as trademarks and patents, are available for other types of intellectual property."
