        "text": "by Sheridan Ecker\n\nRecently, online author SenLinYu entered into a book deal with Del Ray at Penguin House to publish her debut novel, Alchemised.[1] This is not an ordinary book deal, though, as Alchemised is a reimagined version of her incredibly successful fanfiction called Manacled,[2] following Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy from the world of Harry Potter[3] if the book had ended quite differently.[4] A quick search for “Manacled” on TikTok will yield countless results of users discussing the work,[5] and the fanfiction has over seven million hits[6] on its hosting website, Archive of Our Own.[7] In the Harry Potter fanfiction world—with over 450,000 works on Archive of Our Own alone[8]—it is second only to All the Young Dudes.[9] As the author herself notes, though, people in recent years have taken to selling it illegally, and this book deal was an opportunity for her to maintain the integrity of the work without jeopardizing the legality of fanfiction itself.[10]\n\nFanfiction requires some legal protection since it directly clashes with copyright.[11] Under federal copyright law, copyright protection “subsists…in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated.”[12] Assuming this is met, the copyright holder enjoys a variety of exclusive rights, including the exclusive right to “to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.”[13] However, to establish a prima facie case for copyright infringement, a copyright holder must show that the work was “actually copied” and that the copying “amounts to improper or unlawful appropriation.”[14] This typically involves looking into whether the new work is substantially similar to the original.[15] However, there are also protections for copyright infringers under doctrines like the fair use doctrine, which “allows the public fair use of copyrighted materials.”[16]\n\nUnsurprisingly, fanfiction and published books are treated differently under copyright law and its defenses. Alchemised is hardly unique in its position as a fanfiction-turned-published-novel, the most notable example being the Twilight[17] fanfiction-turned-novel Fifty Shades of Grey.[18] While non-commercialized fanfiction enjoys broad protection under copyright law, resulting in little more than the occasional cease-and-desist letter,[19] there is a higher burden on those who seek to profit from it.[20] The fair use defense largely protects non-profit based fanfiction, and other similar fan works. Under the fair use doctrine, an “assessment is done under multi-factor test, which in part considers the commercial or non-commercial aspect of the potentially infringing work.”[21] The other considerations include the “nature of the copyrighted work,” as well as the “amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole,” and finally, “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.”[22] When the use is commercial based, “the user must show a greater degree of transformation … in order to establish that it is fair.”[23]\n\nThe fair use doctrine is only necessary if the original work is actually violating copyright—fair use is a defense to the charge of copyright infringement.[24] Though it is uncertain whether a work like Alchemised would be considered copyright infringement in the first place, after changing character names and other Harry Potter specific references, one of the tenets of copyright law is that the owner has exclusive rights to “to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.”[25] Fanfiction is a derivative work, and given the factual knowledge that Alchemised is an updated version of a Harry Potter fanfiction, it would almost certainly have to rely on fair use rather than a basic argument that it does not infringe.[26] Under the current fair use doctrine, so long as the work is sufficiently transformative and does not specifically reference characters or other unique features of the original work, it is not infringing –after all, copyright does not protect ideas, but rather the “particular expression” of them.[27] Alchemised, then, would likely be protected under the fair use doctrine, once it is released.\n\nWhen it comes to fanfictions-turned-novels, the fair use doctrine is an insufficient protection for the original holders of the copyright as it fails to account for the success second-comers enjoy from the intellectual efforts of the original author. As noted by other scholars, a key aspect of fanfictions becoming published novels is that they had wide fanbases due to the original subject matter of the fanfiction, and they got the benefit of this transfer of a fanbase under an ostensibly “original work.”[28] The economic outcome is notable, since authors like E.L. James and Cassandra Clare have been able to turn their fanfictions into “multi million dollar industries.”[29]\n\nIt should matter that these works became successful because of their original source, but under current copyright law, it does not. Would Manacled have been as successful if it was not a Harry Potter fanfiction? Would Alchemised have been chosen for publication if not for Manacled’s proven success? In essence, fanfiction enjoys broad protection because it does not seek to monetize the original work, but these published novels are chosen specifically for their connection to the source material and the underlying fan base. Without a copyright scheme that takes this into consideration for published fanfiction, the law does original copyright holders a disservice.\n\n[1] SenLinYu (@SenLinYu), Tumblr (Feb. 5, 2024), https://senlinyu.tumblr.com/post/741499573811445761/im-excited-to-announce-that-i-have-signed-a-book; see also Emily Lafroy, How the most anticipated book of next year is based off The Handmaid’s Tale-inspired fanfiction of Harry Potter’s Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger that was read more than seven MILLION times, DailyMail (Feb. 9, 2024), https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13061735/book-fanfiction-harry-potter-draco-malfoy-hermoine-granger.html.\n\n[2] SenLinYu, Manacled, Archive of Our Own (Aug. 19, 2019), https://archiveofourown.org/works/14454174.\n\n[3] See, e.g., J.K.

Again the atoms fluttered before my eyes. . . . Long lines, often combined more densely; everything in motion, twisting and turning like snakes. But look, what was that? One of the snakes had seized its own tail, and the figure whirled mockingly before my eyes. . . .”[1]\n\nSo goes the story of August Kekulé’s inspiration for his skeletal depiction of benzene as a six-carbon cyclic compound with alternating single and double bonds (depicted using lines):[2]\n\nWith the 1865 proposal of his dream-inspired ring hypothesis (and his later publications of a refined structure that more closely resembles the modern benzene structural depiction),[3] Kekulé shed light on a mystery that had stumped chemists since the discovery of benzene in 1825.[4] For forty years, chemists had struggled to divine a structure that would explain both the superior stability and unique reactivity of benzene.[5] Kekulé’s intellectual contribution regarding “the simplest and most fundamental structure of the aromatic compounds” has provided the foundation for advances in the theory of aromaticity,[6] opening the door to developments in the synthesis of “dye-stuffs, medicines, and other organic chemicals.”[7]\n\nShifting to a legal perspective: the creation of any innovative and useful idea prompts one to wonder how the originator can protect (and thus, profit off of) her intellectual property rights in her idea. Applying modern legal principles to the inventive landscape of the 1860s, how might Kekulé have protected his intellectual property rights in his structural depiction of benzene?\n\nBroadly speaking, “intellectual property is any product of the human mind which the law protects against unauthorized use by others;” this includes patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.[8] This article will address whether Kekulé could have used Copyright Law to protect his benzene depiction.[9]\n\nThe United States Constitution grants Congress the power “To promote the Progress of . . . useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive right to their . . . Writings . . . .”[10] The statutory source of federal copyright protection is the Copyright Act of 1976 (“Copyright Act”).[11] For Kekulé’s benzene depiction to fall within the scope of copyrightable subject matter, it must be an (1) original (2) work of authorship that is (3) fixed in a tangible medium.[12]\n\nFor a work to be “original,” it must be independently created by its author, and it must possess “at least some minimal degree of creativity.” [13] In other words, a work is not copyrightable if the author copied another’s work to make it. However, even if an author’s work is identical to another’s prior work, it may still be copyrightable so long as the author independently created it.[14] Thus, “originality” hinges on the author’s independent source of inspiration for her work rather than the uniqueness or novelty of the work itself.\n\nUnder this definition, Kekulé’s benzene depiction would likely be found to be “original.” Kekulé derived the idea from his dream of snakes and tails—in other words he independently created it.[15] Even if another “author” independently reached the same structure before Kekulé, another’s independent creation does not bar Kekulé’s copyright prospects so long as the other author cannot prove that Kekulé copied that author.[16] Additionally, given that chemists struggled to determine the structure of benzene for forty years before Kekulé found a solution,[17] his depiction likely meets the “at least minimally creative” threshold for the originality requirement. Thus, Kekulé’s benzene structure is likely “original.”\n\nNext, Kekulé’s structural depiction of benzene must have been a “work of authorship.” A work of authorship can be pictorial or graphic[18] “two-dimensional . . . diagrams [and] models.”[19] This subject matter category is limited by the “Useful Articles Doctrine,” which limits the scope of copyrightable subject material to only the pictorial or graphic elements “that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.”[20] A “useful article” is one that has “an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.”[21]\n\nIn Kekulé’s case, benzene is depicted as a drawing of a hexagon with alternating single and double bonds.[22] The primary purpose of the depiction is likely to “portray the appearance of . . . or convey information” about the molecule that makes up benzene in its physical form. Therefore, the danger that the Useful Articles Doctrine seeks to prevent—“the open-ended extension of copyright protection to all manner of useful articles”—is not implicated here.[23] In other words, a copyright covering a drawn depiction of benzene could not be extended to benzene in its physical form, so an application of the Useful Articles Doctrine would serve no purpose. Therefore, Kekulé’s benzene depiction is likely a pictorial “work of authorship” within the scope of Section 102(a)(5).\n\nThe final Section 102(a) requirement for copyrightable subject matter is that the work of authorship be “fixed in any tangible medium of expression . . . from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated.”[24] In Kekulé’s case, the moment he drew his structure of benzene in a workbook, he “fixed” his “original work of authorship” in a “tangible medium of expression.”\n\nThus, Kekulé’s benzene depiction likely falls within the Section 102(a) scope of copyrightable subject matter; however, Section 102(b) presents a significant obstacle in Kekulé’s path to copyright protection. Section 102(b) establishes: “In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.”[25] As stated by the Supreme Court, “[t]he most fundamental axiom of copyright law is that ‘no other may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates.’”[26]\n\nRegarding ideas, a distinction is made between the expression of an idea, and the idea that is being expressed.[27] Therefore, to overcome the per se uncopyrightable idea of benzene as a cyclic six-carbon compound with alternating single and double bonds (representing the idea of a delocalized electron system, as we understand it now),[28] Kekulé’s copyright should be directed only at the pictorial expression of benzene which uses single and double lines arranged to convey information about the characteristics of benzene.\n\nAnother argument against finding that Kekulé’s benzene depiction is copyrightable is that Kekulé has merely discovered a “scientific fact as to the nature of the physical world,” such that he “may not claim to be the ‘author’ of that fact.”[29] This argument relies on the premise that Kekulé’s benzene depiction is factual in nature, i.e., that Kekulé has merely discovered the structure of benzene as it “actually exists.”[30] In the 1860s, Kekulé likely could have countered that his depiction of benzene was not a fact, but a hypothesis. However, in today’s world, the depicted structure of benzene may be so generally accepted in the scientific community as to be considered a legal fact (even if scientifically, the proposed structure remains hypothetical).\n\nIn conclusion, so long as Kekulé’s benzene depiction is not barred by Section 102(b), it likely falls within the scope of copyrightable subject matter. Exactly how Kekulé may have enforced such a copyright is another question entirely!\n\n[1] Alan J.

Farrington\n\nCredit or copyright? That is the question. On September 25, 2019, fourteen-year-old Jalaiah Harmon created a short, twenty-second dance, dubbed “the Renegade,” and posted it on Instagram.[1] In the weeks after, the video racked up about 13,000 views, inspiring other Instagrammers to recreate the dance and post it themselves.[2] By October, the dance had migrated to TikTok, and Jalaiah was lost in the endless echoes of “the Renegade.”[3] Jalaiah was not credited once.[4]\n\nHowever, Jalaiah did not seek legal action, and did not attempt to copyright her dance,[5] she simply wanted credit.[6] But where is the line between copyright and credit, and must you have one to perpetuate the other?\n\nThe Renegade credit-or-copyright debacle is reminiscent of the 2018 Fortnite lawsuits.[7] In these lawsuits, a handful of basketball players, pop-culture icons, and even Carlton from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air attempted to take on Epic Games for their Fortnite “emotes,” alleging copyright infringement and violation of the right of publicity.[8]\n\nThe United States District Court for the Central District of California cut Carlton at his knees when the court dismissed his suit, holding: “No one can own a dance step.”[9] The court went on to explain that “[c]opyright law is clear that individual dance steps and simple dance routines are not protected by copyright, but rather are building blocks of free expression, which are in the public domain for choreographers, dancers, and the general public to use, perform, and enjoy.”[10]\n\nCopyright does not extend to “short dance routines consisting of only a few movements or steps with minor linear or spatial variations, even if a routine is novel or distinctive.”[11] The reasoning behind such stingy protection is Congress’ unwavering commitment to “progress.”[12] Copyright law walks the line between “providing protection to incentivize authors to create new works and allowing leeway so that new works can be created without being unduly strangled by the rights of preexisting works.”[13] Thus, Carlton’s swinging arms aren’t copyrightable, and neither is your favorite athlete’s end-zone jig.[14]\n\nBut where is the line between “individual dance steps” and “choreographic routines?”[15] The United States Copyright Office provides some clarity: “[c]horeography is the composition and arrangement of a related series of dance movements and patterns organized into a coherent whole.”[16] Common elements of copyrightable choreography include:\n\nRhythmic movements of one or more dancers’ bodies in a defined sequence and a defined spatial environment, such as a stage\n\nA series of dance movements or patterns organized into an integrated, coherent, and expressive compositional whole\n\nA story, theme, or abstract composition conveyed through movement\n\nA presentation before an audience\n\nA performance by skilled individuals\n\nMusical or textual accompaniment[17]\n\nAnalyzing Jalaiah’s Renegade under these factors, it seems as though it might be copyrightable. The hurdles don’t stop there, though. Though the filing costs $45 for a single author or $65 for all other filings,[18] “[p]roviding the requisite material for an ironclad copyright application can also be costly.”[19] For example, a single Labanotation score,[20] which is a “codified dance notation” similar to sheet music, might cost an individual $5,000.[21] This may explain why, out of the 500,000 applications the Copyright Office receives each year, typically less than 20 are “choreographic works.”[22] Furthermore, the “world of professional dance is a small one built largely on reputation—so, historically, choreographers haven’t been tempted to outright copy each other’s work. . . . .[23]”\n\nSo, what does this mean for the amateur dancers of TikTok? “To be robbed of credit on TikTok is to be robbed of real opportunities. In 2020, virality means income. . . . .”[24] Should growing artists like Jalaiah be forced to invest in the copyright process to reap the benefits of their creativity? As is seemingly the answer with anything internet-related: maybe, maybe not. Whether it be social pressures of bourgeoning[25] and veteran[26] creators alike calling out copiers and demanding credit, or the strengthening legal argument some of these creators have,[27] some big names have begun to tip their hat to the original creators.[28] Perhaps we can trust credit will be given where credit is due, or perhaps the Copyright Office is about to get a lot busier with #TikTokApplications.\n\n[1] Jalaiah S.
