        "text": "What is Copyright?\n\nCopyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to the authors of \"original works of authorship\" including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, architectural and certain other intellectual works.\n\n***This protection is available to both published and unpublished works.\n\nMaterial in the \"public domain\" is intellectual property that does not come under copyright laws.\n\nNearly all work before the 20th C. is not copyrighted.\n\nWhat is Plagiarism?\n\nPlagiarism is the the act of stealing and passing off the ideas, words, or other intellectual property produced by another as one's own. For example, using someone else's words in a research paper without citing the source, is an act of plagiarism.\n\nHistory of copyright:\n\nFirst law enacted 1790.\n\n1976 copyright law followed international law, extending copyright for 50 years after death of the author/creator.\n\nOn October 27, 1998, President Clinton signed into law the \"Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act,\" which extends the terms of almost all existing copyrights by 20 years, to provide copyrights in the United States the same protection afforded in Europe. The basic term of copyright protection, the life of the creator plus 50 years, has been increased to life plus 70 years. The term for \"work for hire\" has been extended from 75 to 95 years.\n\nHow long does copyright last?\n\nWorks created on or after Jan 1978 - life of author + 70\n\nWork for hire 95 years\n\nThe OWNER/manufacturer/creator[but not always the creator ] of the work CAN:\n\ncopy the work.\n\ncreate derivative works based upon the work.\n\nsell, rent, lease, lend copies of the work.\n\npublicly perform literary, musical, dramatic, motion picture and other audiovisual works.\n\npublicly perform sound recordings.\n\nIt is not necessary to have a notice of copyright (i.e.: © 1997 Jane Doe) for material to be copyright protected in the U.S. Once something tangible is produced, text, graphics, music, video, etc., it is automatically copyrighted. Sound recordings and some other property use other copyright symbols. Anyone can use the copyright symbol on her or his original work.\n\nThe Internet and Copyright:\n\n\"The Internet has been characterized as the largest threat to copyright since its inception. The Internet is awash in information, a lot of it with varying degrees of copyright protection. Copyrighted works on the Net include new s stories, software, novels, screenplays, graphics, pictures, Usenet messages and even email. In fact, the frightening reality is that almost everything on the Net is protected by copyright law. That can pose problems for the hapless surfer.\" (\"The Copyright Web site\" http://www.benedict.com/)\n\nWhat is protected on the WWW?\n\nThe unique underlying design of a Web page and its contents, including:\n\nlinks\n\noriginal text\n\ngraphics\n\naudio\n\nvideo\n\nhtml, vrml, other unique markup language sequences\n\nList of Web sites compiled by an individual or organization\n\nand all other unique elements that make up the original nature of the material.\n\nWhen creating a Web page, you CAN:\n\nLink to other Web sites. [However, some individuals and organizations have specific requirements when you link to their Web material. Check a site carefully to find such restrictions. It is wise to ask permission. You need to cite source, as you are required to do in a research paper, when quoting or paraphrasing material from other sources. How much you quote is limited.]\n\nUse free graphics on your Web page. If the graphics are not advertised as \"free\" they should not be copied without permission.\n\nWhen creating a Web page, you CANNOT:\n\nPut the contents of another person's or organizations web site on your Web page\n\nCopy and paste information together from various Internet sources to create \"your own\" document. [You CAN quote or paraphrase limited amounts, if you give credit to the original source and the location of the source. This same principle applies to print sources, of course.]\n\nIncorporate other people's electronic material, such as e-mail, in your own document, without permission.\n\nForward someone's e-mail to another recipient without permission\n\nChange the context of or edit someone else's digital correspondence in a way which changes the meaning\n\nCopy and paste others' lists of resources on your own web page\n\nCopy and paste logos, icons, and other graphics from other web sites to your web page (unless it is clearly advertised as \"freeware.\" Shareware is not free). Some organizations are happy to let you use their logos, with permission - it is free advertising. But they want to know who is using it. They might not approve of all sites who want to use their logo.\n\nMany aspects of the issue of copyright and the Internet are still not resolved. This information, however, should serve as a useful guide to help you avoid violation of copyright rules and the pitfalls of unknowingly plagiarizing someone else's material. When in doubt, please consult the official copyright rules and guidelines.\n\nFor more resources on this subject, see Copyright Resources (http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/cpyrght.htm)\n\n© Virginia Montecino 1996"
