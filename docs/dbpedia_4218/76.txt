The Adventures of Abney And Teal returns with new episodes of this unique hand-drawn and digitally animated series. Abney and Teal again welcome young viewers to their island, in the middle of a lake, in the middle of a park, in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the big city, where they live with a group of friendly and hilarious characters, to share more new adventures.

On Sunday, Abney, Teal and Neep make mysterious noises on a misty day. They try to get Bop to join in the game but it’s not so mysterious down by the lake. It is a boiling hot day on Monday - much too hot to do anything apart from eat ice-cream and go swimming. But when Abney and Teal finally get to the lake there’s something not quite right about it. In Tuesday’s episode, the Poc-Pocs have got hiccups. Teal finds the cure, but they're spreading! When they reach Bop something has to be done. Wednesday finds Abney planting seeds in the moonlight. In the morning some have grown into lovely big cabbages. Abney and Teal decide to help out one that is struggling, which leads to big trouble. And on Thursday, Abney and Teal have a snooze in Abney's new summerhouse. They don't wake up where they expect, and Abney has to use his building skills to find them a way home.
