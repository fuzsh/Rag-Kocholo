        "text": "Look at those cars in the background! My guess is that this is the Mouse-trap roller-coaster, Blackpool - picture taken in the early 50â€™s. Thereâ€™s a story here - - The girl in the front seat laughing, the boy sat next to her looking slightly demonic! - The girls in the outside seats in the back row look ever so slightly terrified. - The girl in the middle feeling safer because sheâ€™s wedged in. Looking pensive, a bit of a Mona Lisa smile forming. Who took the photo? What year was it? Who are those children, sitting with my Mum (can you guess which one she is?) Picture found in my attic with a load of old reeled cine film. ðŸŽ¥ Iâ€™ve still got my Grandadâ€™s box brownie camera, his projector and screen. ðŸ“º Theyâ€™re treasured memories captured of family no longer here. A new film â€˜All of us strangersâ€™ is about the imagined conversations with loved ones no longer here. Iâ€™ve yet to see it but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll make us think about our own circumstances and our own family. Whilst thereâ€™s many questions Iâ€™d like answers to, itâ€™s a real comfort to have at least a few memories captured in photos and film. Itâ€™s so important to ask the questions before itâ€™s too late, donâ€™t you think? Whilst itâ€™s not something we think about in our day to day lives, itâ€™s a wonderful thing to record our own family histories. #InMyOwnWords #RecordingYourFamilyLifeStories #TheAuthorsJourney #AllOfUsStrangers\n\nI can't provide images, but I can give you a brief overview of the \"Sholay\" movie story. It's a classic Bollywood film released in 1975. The story revolves around two criminals, Veeru and Jai, hired by a retired police officer to capture the ruthless dacoit Gabbar Singh. The film explores themes of friendship, revenge, and justice, set against the backdrop of a village facing oppression. If you're interested in images, you might want to search for stills or promotional materials related to \"Sholay.\" https://lnkd.in/dFac665M"
