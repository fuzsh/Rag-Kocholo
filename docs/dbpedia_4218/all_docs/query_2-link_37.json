        "text": "Hello. I am T. Johnson. I make animations of my own, but that isn't important. I realized that the last blog post here was made about 10 years ago. I think I want to break the streak, even if I am a few months off. I think I remember when I was younger using the BLitDH website. I think I played with the studio mode where you put clips of the episodes together to music. I might of found it on a archive website. But sense then, the website shut down. I think last year I might of found a working version in some other region, but like most old Mattel websites, it seems to be removed. That is sad. I am pretty sure sense Dreamhouse Adventures ended, I presume, they've started It Takes Two. A lot has happened in a decade... I miss when Barbie was…\n\nBarbie: Well it's going to be amaze at the beach day!\n\nKen: Closet is off! Enrique, Grace, Blissa, Nikki, Teresa, Pack anything to go to the beach!\n\nEnrique: I like baths, especially singing in the bath.\n\nNikki: Same as me, Grace!\n\n(Barbie and her friends arrived at Malibu Beach they wearing swimsuits)\n\nTeresa: Wait! Bananas is going to make a sandcastle\n\nEnrique: Oh! I almost forgot, Teal is a ragdoll who lives with Abney, She is a plush doll.\n\nKen: Peace and quiet!\n\nBarbie: Wait! Someone is missing (Blissa meows) Blissa! You’re back!\n\nEnrique: I collect rock pools and shells, Grace!\n\nGrace: Exactly! Enrique, you collected some shells on the sand.\n\nCorey Liamzane: Hello world! (Corey in his normal outfit)\n\nEnrique and Barbie: What's the matter, Corey\n\nCorey Liamza…\n\nHello!\n\nI am planning on adopting this wiki as I believe it derserves to be updated and looked after. I have experiences of being an Admin over the Barbie, Barbie Movies, My Scene, and currently in progress, the Mattel wiki.\n\nDespite only 27 edits so far, I promise I will make sure to try to update this wiki often as possible as things like LIVE! in the Dreamhouse and Dreamhouse Adventures come along.\n\nI will still make DraikJack and Ylimegirl as Admins (I'm also open to giving adminstrator rights to others that I trust as well) but I'm just adopting this wiki as it needs to be looked after. I am also very quick on my feet so if there's any notice like messages, trolling, and etc., I can get into action right away!\n\nPlease comment below if you gu…\n\nHey Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse fans. I know we are upset that YouTube and the Barbie Website made the episode New Girl in Town episode private due to bad comments. But I have found it on YouTube on a different channel (not the Barbie channel). The YouTube channel's name is HOLAPRINCESA. The person who created it does not own the video. All rights go to Barbie and Mattel. Here is the link to it: http://youtu.be/cdRqYA0QTM4\n\nEnjoy!\n\ni regret ever making a barbie profile, this site has ruined my life.\n\ni have been a victim of bullying and am mentaly scared by this.\n\ni blame the ceators for not having any filters on this website and i hope none of this will follow me later on in life\n\npeace out xoxo\n\nWhat is wrong with me seriously why am I posting this? Proably just beacause I have waaaaay to much spare time, like this morining I did a spa style mani pedi and invented a new style of painting my nails and here I am posting something that no one is going to read!!! That is also probably beacause I'm bored I mean I almost wish school would start again but, anyway if you are reading this chances are you are bored and have time of your hands two soooooooooooo ya..... I guess bye?\n\n...and can be accessed here: http://dreamhouse.barbie.com/pl/episodes\n\nnote: most of the links on the page will redirect to the new barbie.com site, however you can manually enter them in by replacing the /en-US/ part of the link with /pl/.\n\nThe name of episode 50 has been updated (episodes 51 and 52 aren't showing up yet) and I've updated the length of each episode from season 6 from the LitD website like the last 5 seasons were, rather than the YouTube versions.\n\nIt is currently day 2 and buisness is slow. Going to see what tomorrow brings.\n\nSchlond Poofa\n\nEdit: After I posted, the website attempted to attack me with a survey. I am unstable and in no condition to be taking a survey- Ken has broken me once again. Looks like Barbie won't be going to the beach after all.\n\nEdit Number 2: I am on my way to victory. I have been awarded with a badge titled \"something to say\". Well let me tell you something, I have lot's to say. Schlond Poofa, out.\n\nHey, you guys!\n\nSince the Season 6 is coming soon next month as you all know. I wondering what do you all think what will happen in the next season? More drama? More Ken and Ryan fight? Will Raquelle and Barbie will become enemies (I'm just saying that for a fact)? More comedy? More Summer and Midge? WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? This is Valentinetime45 (talk) 01:41, January 9, 2014 (UTC) signing off. Bye!\n\nI finally got off my butt and made some userboxes!\n\nThey aren't great, but they work.\n\nFirst off, the basic template, Userbox. This is the basic template totally not stolen from the cp wiki for all the other userboxes I made. If you want to make a userbox, you can use this template.\n\nSecond, the two gender templates, Male and Female. You can use these to state your gender.\n\nThirdly, I made ones based off the 20 day Dreamhouse challenge by kyan-pepper on tumblr. They are Challenge1, Challenge2, Challenge3, all the way up to Challenge20. They are all shown below since I am crazy. They all default to various things; instructions to utilize them can be found on their template page.\n\nThat's about it! If there are any other templates you'd like me to make…\n\nWhy am I even posting this only 10 people edit this wiki\n\nSo! We are in lack of some userboxes. Any ideas on what these userboxes should be?\n\nwho's up for having the answers to the 20 day dreamhouse challenge be part of 'em\n\nSeason 5 officially has a premiere date - October 2nd! The above tweet comes from the supervising producer of the show and writer of some classic episodes such as Happy Birthday Chelsea and Primp My Ride.\n\nMore information about the upcoming season will be added as soon as it is available.\n\nCast and crew members involved with the show have just announced via Twitter that a special 30 minute episode of Life in the Dreamhouse will air on Nickelodeon at 12pm on the 1st of September! This special episode will actually be made up of two brand new stories, Pool Party and Trapped in the Dreamhouse each 11 minutes long. The more viewers who watch, the more likely it is for Nickelodeon to request more special episodes, so make sure you tune in at 12pm on September 1st to help support the show and watch two brand new full-length episodes!"
