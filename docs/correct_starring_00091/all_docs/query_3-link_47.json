        "text": "Cutthroat Island. 1995. Dir. Renny Harlin. With Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, Frank Langella, Maury Chaykin, Patrick Malahide, Stan Shaw, Rex Linn, Paul Dillon, Christopher Masterson, Jimmie F. Skaggs, Harris Yulin. Screenplay by Marc Norman and Robert King; Story by Michael Frost Beckner & James Gorman and Bruce A. Evans & Raynold Gideon.\n\nBadness:\n\nEnjoyment Factor:\n\nI would first like to apologize to Geena Davis. Geena, you are an amazing, Oscar-winning actress. You have done so much for women in the arts, and continue to this day to be a huge advocate for advancing women in motion pictures and television. I wish that more actresses would get careers in action films, and that action movies would not just be considered a man’s picture. Actresses such as yourself, Angelina Jolie, Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Yeoh, Pam Grier and Ziyi Zhang have really pioneered the woman-led action film.\n\nI wanted to say that because it is a real shame that so few big-budget adventure films have starred women, and it really is disappointing. That being said, the 1995 Cutthroat Island, starring Geena Davis and directed by her then husband, Renny Harlin, is as bad as you’ve heard. It might be worse than that.\n\nCutthroat Island has become one of the most notorious and mocked big-budget bombs of all time. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, it is the biggest financial loss ever. The Internet Movie Data Base cites that it cost $115 million to make, and made only ten million dollars at the box office. For those of my readers who are not great at math, that means it’s a loss of 105 million dollars.\n\nThe film is a classic example of Hollywood filmmaking at its most extravagant and excessive. To paraphrase a line from another nineties blockbuster that actually made money, they spared no expense. Renny Harlin and his crew are trying, so, so hard to make a blockbuster film. He failed miserably.\n\nThis movie is a mess. Nobody has the same accent, or seems to be in the same movie. Geena Davis plays the film pretty straight, and seems to be attempting to act. Matthew Modine, who plays the romantic interest, is just doing bad slapstick. The great Harris Yulin, who plays Davis’ dad, is just doing a Rip Torn impression. And, a movie really has to suck to waste Maury Chaykin, Stan Shaw, and Frank Langella; I mean those three are always great.\n\nOn one level, I appreciate that this movie exists. It is such a disaster that it is fascinating in the way a train wreck or a department store fire is. For such an expensive pirate epic, it is curious how sloppy the directing is. There is a sequence, for example, where the dubbing is so atrocious where the performer’s lips aren’t even moving. Also, strangely, I never thought I’d see the day where I would think while watching a movie, ‘Too many monkeys’. This is that movie.\n\nIt would take eight years before Hollywood would get a pirate movie right.\n\nNever Too Young to Die. 1986. Dir. Gil Bettman. With John Stamos, Vanity, Gene Simmons, George Lazenby, Peter Kwong, Ed Brock, John Anderson, Robert Englund, Tara Buckman, Curtis Taylor, Jon Greene. Written by Steven Paul and Anthony Foutz (billed as Anton Fritz); Story by Steven Paul.\n\nBadness:\n\nEnjoyment Factor:\n\nIn the 1980’s, films that dealt with espionage were all the rage. Many of these movies were clearly James Bond knock-offs, or at least “inspired” by the 007 legacy. Few of these rip-offs actually featured an actor who played James Bond in a key role. Never Too Young to Die, which was an attempt by MGM to start another spy franchise in addition to their super successful Bond films, both acknowledges the world’s most famous spy and kills him off.\n\nThere are many surprising things about Never Too Young to Die, including that a major Hollywood studio released this. It’s also wild that they got George Lazenby, 007 himself, to play the famous secret agent Stargrove, and they cast John Stamos (one year before Full House) as his estranged son, who must avenge his father’s murder (this is not a spoiler). Most surprising, no; most shocking is that they cast Gene Simmons as the villain: a hermaphroditic gang leader named Velvet Von Ragnar. You read that right.\n\nLots about this movie is dated and offensive, but nothing more than Gene Simmons’ role. Everything about his performance is so wrong, but oh so right. It is beyond over-the-top, he is hypnotic in his awfulness. It’s fair to say that it is the most memorable aspect to this film. There is a sequence where Von Ragnar, draped in a costume that would make Mae West blush, sings a song in a nightclub. Some of the lyrics include: “It takes a man like me/to be a woman like me/yeah!” and “Can you guess what I am?/ Do you believe what you see?/yeah!” You cannot make this stuff up. This moment is jaw-dropping in its offensive and also completely hilarious.\n\nBefore I go down a rabbit hole describing Simmons’ work in this film any further, maybe I should attempt to explain the plot. Agent Stargrove, the world’s greatest spy, has been murdered, and his son, a college gymnast, must team up with his dad’s partner to stop Velvet Von Ragnar’s dastardly plan to poison the water supply of a major American city. Oh, and his dad’s partner is a beautiful and intelligent woman played by Vanity. Gee, I wonder if they’ll fall in love?\n\nYou can see how this film was developed as the first entry into a franchise. It’s basically James Bond Jr., but rated R. You have the outrageous villain, you have the love interest, you have the gadgets (you even have the Q branch character, here played by Peter Kwong, as Stamos’ best friend), the chase scenes, you even have the ridiculous theme song. It’s all here. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the elements did not gel with audiences.\n\nLet’s be crystal clear: this film fails as an action film, but succeeds as a bad movie. There is no way you could watch Never Too Young to Die and think it would make a successful film franchise. It is listed on the Internet Movie Database as being an action-comedy, but there is no evidence in the film that any of the hilarity of this motion picture is intentional. I’d argue that this film’s outrageous tone is mostly unintentional.\n\nOn a very basic level, the filmmaking on display here is pretty pedestrian. The opening shot is of a city skyline at night, which instantly cuts to a dam in the broad daylight, before another abrupt cut to another nighttime scene, where Velvet Von Ragnar’s gang is introduced. Another example of bad storytelling is that John Stamos is set up very early and in quite detail as an expert gymnast, and that is never used as foreshadowing in the film. At the end of the movie, when he’s hanging off the edge of the dam, isn’t that when the film would use his gymnastic prowess? Also, there is a character reveal in the third act that is so obvious that it’s kind of insulting.\n\nAll of that being said, this is a delightful bad movie. I loved it, even though I felt very guilty about loving it afterwards.\n\nRed Sonja. 1985. Dir. Richard Fleischer. With Brigitte Nielsen, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sandahl Bergman, Paul L. Smith, Ernie Reyes Jr., Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach. Written by Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser; based on characters created by Robert E. Howard; Red Sonja comic book by Roy Thomas and Barry Windsor-Smith.\n\nBadness:\n\nEnjoyment Factor:\n\nIt’s kind of fascinating that out of all of the films Arnold Schwarzenegger has made, he refers to this one as his worst. I don’t want to disagree with the former Governator, but there is no way that this is worse than The 6th Day ,End of Days, Jingle All the Way, Batman and Robin, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Collateral Damage or Sabotage, to name a few. I would theorize that probably he was tired of making Conan type movies. Red Sonja came out in 1985, and Schwarzenegger had already made two other Conan flicks in the prior 3 years.\n\nIn fact, even though his character’s name is Kalidor, he is clearly playing a Conan type, and he was not named Conan in this film for legal reasons. Dino De Laurentiis, the legendary movie producer, whose film company produced Red Sonja, and told Schwarzenegger that he would have no more than a cameo in this film, and then promptly gave him first billing. It is bizarre in a film about Red Sonja to focus so much on this non-Conan barbarian character.\n\nOf course, Red Sonja and Conan the Barbarian are both Robert E. Howard characters, and both obviously exist in the same world. It would make sense to have at least a Conan reference in this film, but, man oh man, do they play up the Conan stuff! The score by Ennio Morricone sounds very similar to Basil Poledouris’ score from Conan the Barbarian. Sandahl Bergman, who played Valeria in Conan the Barbarian, plays the evil Queen Gedren.\n\nI mention the similarities to suggest that Arnold was probably just really tired of the sword and sorcery genre, and was aware that he needed to pivot his filmography if he wanted to stay relevant as an action star. Which he did. Again, it’s strange that Arnold seems to be the focus of this film when, you know, it’s called Red Sonja.\n\nBrigitte Nielsen is probably known more today as a reality television star than as an actress, which I don’t think is really fair, because she does her best in this film. The script is not very good, and for an actress in her debut performance, she does hold her own. In 1985, the critics were not very kind to Nielsen, and she “won” that year’s Razzie for Worst New Star for her performances in Red Sonja and Rocky IV. I don’t think Nielsen’s performance is more wooden than Schwarzenegger’s, who is definitely on auto-pilot in this film.\n\nThis is a low-rent version of a familiar story, but it is still very charming. The costumes are beautiful and outrageous (all of the villains are decked out in black and gold, clearly Steelers fans). The sets are cheesy but capture the feeling of one of Howard’s adventure stories. I am a sucker for the 1980’s fantasy film, and it has always been one of my favorite genres. The movie is goofy, but in the best way possible.\n\nI haven’t talked about the plot, because you can probably guess the beats by now. Young girl’s village is massacred by evil Queen, young girl is attacked and left for dead (the sexual assault details are glazed over quickly), young girl is granted magic powers by some ghost/fairy godmother character (this scene is right out of “Cinderella”), and young girl now turns into Red Sonja.\n\nEventually, Red Sonja meets up with Conan, er, Kalidor, and must fight Evil Queen Gerden to avenge her family, and to get the powerful talisman, that can destroy the world by earthquakes and lightning. She also meets the young Prince Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his lackey Falkon (played by cult movie mainstay Paul L. Smith), who are kind of like the C-3PO and R2-D2 characters, as in they are here mostly for comic relief.\n\nThe film has some buried sexual repression themes, as Red Sonja is pursued by the very openly by the queen, who lusts after Red Sonja and wants her more as her possession and toy than to kill her. Red Sonja and Conan, uh, Kalidor also seem to really want to knock sandals, and try to find a loophole around their moral codes to do so. This is a running gag.\n\nThis is a ridiculous movie, but it works probably because of its ridiculousness. It is bad, but there is pleasure in the pain.\n\nThe Wizard. 1989. Dir. Todd Holland. With Fred Savage, Luke Edwards, Jenny Lewis, Christian Slater, Beau Bridges, Wendy Phillips, Sam McMurray, Will Seltzer, Jackey Vinson, Frank McRae, Lee Arenberg, Steven Grives, Tobey Maguire. Written by David Chisholm.\n\nBadness:\n\nEnjoyment Factor:\n\nThe Wizard, the 1989 collaboration between Universal Studios and Nintendo, wants to be many things. It wants to be a serious and sensitive melodrama about a broken family. It wants to be a buddy road movie between two brothers and another teenage runaway. It also wants to be a buddy road movie about a father and son. Mostly, though, it wants to be a 100 minute advertisement for Nintendo. All of life’s problems, the film tells us, can be solved by playing video games. No wonder I responded to this film so strongly when I was eight years old.\n\nThe film opens with a little boy, maybe seven, walking down a desert road somewhere in Utah, holding a lunch box. After a long credits sequence, with a song blaring on the soundtrack trying really hard to sound like Bruce Springsteen, an airplane spots the boy, and a Sheriff’s truck shows up. We learn that this boy is Jimmy Woods (Luke Edwards), a troubled child who wanders any chance he can, to get to California. His mother Christine (Wendy Phillips) is concerned, while his stepfather (Sam McMurray, who always plays a great jerk) just wants him institutionalized. Meanwhile, Jimmy’s biological father, Sam (Beau Bridges, incredibly well-cast) is struggling to raise his two other sons, Nick (Christian Slater, who gives a very good supporting performance) and Corey (Fred Savage).\n\nBefore too long, Corey has ran away and busted Jimmy out of an institution, and they head for California. Jimmy and Nick race after them, followed closely by Mr. Putnam (Will Seltzer), the really creepy guy who catches runaways that Christine hired. This is a whole lot of set-up in about ten minutes, by the way. Before too long, Corey and Jimmy are joined along the road by Haley (Jenny Lewis). Oh, and then it turns out that Jimmy is a genius at video games.\n\nSo, for the first sixteen minutes of the film, we’re anticipating a slightly sappy but mostly well acted drama about family. That is, until Jimmy starts playing Double Dragon. According to the Internet Movie Database, in an early pitch meeting one executive referred to the film as “The Karate Kid with video games.” That is definitely what it turns into, as all of the characters are inevitably heading to the Video Armageddon contest in Los Angeles (gee, it’s at Universal Studios, what a coincidence).\n\nEven after all of these years, though, I still get a smile on my face when I see all of the different video games featured in this movie. If you grew up playing Metroid and Super Mario Bros. 3, then you’ll probably enjoy the nostalgia caused by watching this movie. One of the my favorite moments in the film is when Beau Bridges and Christian Slater bond while playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on the original Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nThis film is not perfect. Tonally, the film does not always find a comfortable balance between the different types of stories its telling. The third act includes an over-the-top chase scene through Universal Studios that only seems to exist to get people to go on the tour. The film can’t decide if the main villain is Mr. Putnam or Lucas, the bad boy video game champion who might be better at Mario than Jimmy. But, it’s fun in a cheesy eighties way, and definitely remains entertaining. Oh, and I forgot to mention that Frank McRae plays a truck drive named Spanky. That’s got to be good for something, right?\n\nBloodtide. 1982. Dir. Richard Jeffries. With James Earl Jones, Jose Ferrer, Lila Kedrova, Mary Louise Weller, Martin Kove, Lydia Cornell, Deborah Shelton. Written by Nico Mastorakis and Richard Jefferies.\n\nBadness:\n\nEnjoyment Factor:\n\nBloodtide seems like it has all of the trappings of a good horror film. The plot, about treasure hunters in Greece accidentally summoning an ancient evil, sounds like something ripped right out of H.P. Lovecraft. The film stars three Hollywood legends: James Earl Jones and Academy Award winning actors Jose Ferrer and Lila Kedrova. Even the bad guy from The Karate Kid, Martin Kove, appears in a leading role. It feels like we could have an unjustly ignored horror film here.\n\nBloodtide, however, was ignored for perfectly logical reasons. It is terrible. It is sloppily written, lazily directed, poorly shot and edited. Don’t blame the actors, they’re doing what they can with this mess. James Earl Jones, in particular, gives the film a legitimacy it definitely doesn’t deserve. Martin Kove and Mary Louise Weller (who played Mandy Pepperidge in National Lampoon’s Animal House) play newlyweds who venture to an isolated and foreboding Greek island to find Kove’s sister. Gee, I wonder if his missing sister (played by Deborah Shelton) has anything to do with the ancient, evil presence lurking nearby…\n\nThe motivations of the sister change scene by scene, as do the motivations of most of the characters. That’s not to mention the unhealthy boundaries that the brother and sister seem to have (in a few scenes, I forgot which actress was playing the sister and which actress was playing the bride). I don’t know if it was because this was on a fifty movie DVD pack I bought years ago or what, but the picture was pretty terrible. Several scenes shot in the catacombs underneath the village were impossible to decipher what was going on.\n\nFor a movie that has the talents of two actors from Hollywood’s Golden Age, why would you waste them? Jose Ferrer plays another mysterious local, and Lila Kerdova has a thankless role as an unlucky nun. I didn’t even mention the actual sea monster itself. Taking a page out of the Jaws playbook, the filmmakers wait until the third act of the film to finally reveal the look of the monster. Boy, is it a letdown. An incredibly uninteresting and hastily designed mess. Like the movie.\n\nThe Peanut Butter Solution. 1985. Dir. Michael Rubbo. With Matthew Mackay, Siluck Saysanasy, Alison Darcy, Michael Hogan, Michael Maillot, Helen Hughes, Griffith Brewer, Harry Hill. Written by Vojtech Jasny, Andree Pelletier, Louise Pelletier, Michael Rubbo.\n\nBadness:\n\nEnjoyment Factor:\n\nIf David Lynch ever directed a children’s film, it might look and feel close to Michael Rubbo’s bizarre 1985 feature The Peanut Butter Solution. Unavailable to mainstream audiences for decades, it was recently released on DVD, Blu-Ray and streaming services (as of this writing, if you have an Amazon membership, it’s free on Amazon Prime). I vaguely remembered it, having seen it when I was a child after my grandparents had rented it from the video store. Watching it over thirty years later, I’m kind of surprised that my grandparents let me watch it.\n\nLast week, I wrote about 1987’s The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, another “children’s” film that is strange and unsettling in a way most modern-day family movies simply are not. This is not a criticism, more of an observation, but I can’t think of another movie made for kids that features so prominently both child abduction and the rapidly-growing pubic hair of a minor (I’m not kidding). The supernatural element may be the most normal aspect of The Peanut Butter Solution.\n\nMatthew Mackay plays Michael, a normal Canadian boy living with his artistic father Billy (Michael Hogan) and his sister Suzie (Alison Darcy). His mother is absent for some unexplained reason (although she does return later in the picture, without much commentary on her absence), and Suzie seems to be playing the matriarchal role in the home. Before too long, Michael and his friend Conrad (Siluck Saysanasy) are passing by a creepy abandoned house, and Michael, while exploring the house, sees something so terrifying that all of his hair falls out.\n\nThe rest of the film involves helpful ghosts, unhelpful ghosts, a really sinister teacher named The Signor (Michael Maillot), the titular hair remedy, multiple kidnappings and magic paintbrushes. The Peanut Butter Solution is absolutely bananas in its storytelling, and there were many moments that left my mouth agape.\n\nThere is a gentle wholesomeness to even the more perverse and problematic pieces of the film. There are lessons to be learned, and metaphorical wounds to be healed. I think it’s this weird balancing act of sweetness and darkness that makes the whole crazy movie work so well. This is, quite simply, a movie that could not be made today.\n\nLast Action Hero. 1993. Dir. John McTiernan. With Arnold Schwarzenegger, Austin O’Brien, F. Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Charles Dance, Frank McRae, Tom Noonan, Robert Prosky, Anthony Quinn, Mercedes Ruehl, Ian McKellen, Professor Toru Tanaka, Joan Plowright, Michael V. Gazzo, Danny DeVito (voice). Screenplay by Shane Black & David Arnott, story by Zak Penn & Adam Leff.\n\nBadness:\n\nEnjoyment Factor:\n\nBecause filmmaking is a business, sometimes it is unfairly assumed that if a film is a financial failure, that means that the film is not of artistic value. Sometimes that is the case but not always. Last Action Hero was a huge gamble that did not pay off (the Internet Movie Database estimates its budget at eighty-five million dollars). It was panned by critics, and was nominated for several Razzies, including Worst Picture. Time has revealed Last Action Hero to be a well-made blend of satire and action, with a strong performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger at its center (he was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Actor).\n\nBad timing was definitely a factor in Last Action Hero‘s failure at the time of its original release. Not only did it come out one week after Jurassic Park, but it’s self-referential and sarcastic tone turned off audiences who were expecting a more standard Arnold Schwarzenegger film. This was three years before Scream, so Last Action Hero‘s knowing understanding of movie tropes and cliches was a little ahead of its time.\n\nThe story is well known by now: Danny, a young film fanatic played by Austin O’Brien, is given a magic movie ticket that was once Harry Houdini’s, and he is transported into an action movie, featuring the action movie character Jack Slater, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The plot device, borrowed from both Sherlock Jr. and The Purple Rose of Cairo, plunges Danny into his dream fantasy world, where he knows all of the rules.\n\nThe first two acts of the film, where Danny and Jack Slater have to team up, are funny and fresh; it works both as comedy and action. The third act, however, where Jack is now in the ‘real world,’ drags a bit, and definitely could have been cut down. It is pretty clear that the film could have benefited from some editing after its disastrous test screening.\n\nThis is a movie that works, though, the more familiar you are with movies. It is a film nerd’s dream, with many great cameo performances (including Sharon Stone, Tina Turner and, in a great bit, Maria Shriver). Schwarzenegger gives, ironically, one of his more layered performances, and is ably assisted by O’Brien, Frank McRae as his scenery chewing police chief, Anthony Quinn as an easily confused gangster and the great Charles Dance as the villainous Benedict.\n\nI hadn’t seen Last Action Hero all the way through since the mid-nineties, and I was really impressed by how engaging the film is. It is definitely not perfect, but it is by no means a big-budget bomb, and it deserves a second look.\n\nThe VelociPastor. 2018. Dir. Brendan Steere. With Alyssa Kempinski, Greg Cohan, Aurelio Voltaire, Daniel Steere, Fernando Pacheco De Castro, Jesse Turits, Jiechang Yang. Written by Brendan Steere.\n\nBadness:\n\nEnjoyment Factor:\n\nMaking a film is an incredibly complex process, with lots of people involved to create the final product. With all those different visions, sometimes the completed film can stray from the original idea. Nobody sets out to make a bad movie. Well, rarely. There are some films that are intentionally bad; mocking film cliches and tropes often found in genre movies. The VelociPastor is a competently made film that sets out to be a Grade-Z schlock-filled bad movie. It mostly succeeds.\n\nBecause it’s supposed to be bad, many of the acting and directing choices are pitch-perfect because they’re supposed to be awful. Greg Cohan, who plays the titular character, sounds like he went to the William Shatner school of acting because it fits this particular story. And, what a story! A priest witnesses his parents’ murder (in a really funny visual gag), journeys to China and is gifted a magical tooth that grants him the ability to turn into a dinosaur when he gets Hulk-rage. Under the wise tutelage of hooker/med student Carol (played by Alyssa Kempinski), he decides to use his power to fight criminals and ninjas. That is quite a bit of plot for a seventy-five minute long movie.\n\nI haven’t even mentioned the pimp Frankie Mermaid or the VelociPastor’s mentor Father Stewart or the exorcist or the Vietnam flashbacks or the villain’s ridiculous evil plot or the third act plot twist involving the character called “Sam the White Ninja.” The VelociPastor is crammed with awfulness, but it’s filtered through a mocking, winking sensibility. The cinematography and the color palette actually look like a grainy direct to VHS movie from the nineties, which adds to the atmosphere. The VelociPastor is worth a look for fans of dinosaurs beating up ninjas, as I’m sure you must be.\n\nZero Percent on Rotten Tomatoes Club\n\nThe Garbage Pail Kids Movie. 1987. Dir. Rod Amateau. With Anthony Newley, Mackenzie Austin, Katie Barberi, Phil Fondacaro, Debbie Lee Carrington, Kevin Thompson, Robert Bell, Larry Green, Arturo Gil, Susan Rossitto, Lynn Cartwright. Written by Melinda Palmer, Rod Amateau, based upon the trading cards created by John Pound, Art Spiegelman and Mark Newgarden.\n\nBadness:\n\nEnjoyment Factor:\n\nIshtar. Leonard Part 6. Masters of the Universe. Jaws The Revenge. Over the Top. Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol. Tough Guys Don’t Dance. 1987 was a special year for fans of bad cinema, with the release of all of these “classics,” but also many more, including Ernest Goes to Camp and Madonna’s Who’s That Girl? But, even in a crowded year of trash, one title stands alone in both its oddness and its awfulness: The Garbage Pail Kids Movie.\n\nBased upon the popular trading card series, which in itself is a parody of the Cabbage Patch Kids franchise, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is one of those rare films that’s probably about as bad as you’ve heard; it might even be worse than that. This movie is a steaming pile of sweaty, sloppy, stinky garbage, in the best/worst way possible. Your response to it will indicate how you feel about bad movies. This is easily one of the worst films from a major studio, which, at least to me, makes it essential viewing.\n\nIt’s hard to figure out exactly who this movie was made for. Apparently, it’s considered a legitimate children’s film, which is surprising considering how dark, disgusting and unpleasant the whole experience is. It seems too much for children, but too pedestrian and childish for older audiences. So, we’re left with a motion picture that wasn’t really made with anybody in mind, and it shows.\n\nI could spend more time than it’s worth telling you what this movie is about, or I could just copy and paste the Internet Movie Database synopsis, which is pretty good: “Dodger must confront the struggles of life as he is visited by the Garbage Pail Kids and intimidated by some older bullies.” Perfect summary, thanks IMDB. Mackenzie Astin plays the teenage orphan Dodger (a really obvious reference to Oliver Twist), in a compellingly terrible performance. Dodger, who is supposed to be the hero, is an overly obnoxious character, with very little redeeming qualities. He lives/works for Captain Manzini, who owns an antique shop (played by Anthony Newley, in what was tragically his final film role). Captain Manzini warns that not so artful Dodger about the Pandora’s Box-like trash can that contains the aforementioned Garbage Pail Kids, but Dodger ignores his warnings, and pretty much immediately releases the Kids.\n\nThe Garbage Pail Kids’ design is one of the great, terrible flaws (or highlights) of the film. The puppetry is downright amateur (watch, for instance, at how the dialogue spouted by the Kids does not match the movement of their lips), and the Kids themselves are portrayed by several actors in the costume. This was during the period where most of the chief film roles for little people performers were as a puppet or a goblin or a troll or an Ewok or something of that nature. All of the Pail Kids have a different gimmick: Greaser Greg, Ali Gator (who is an alligator/human hybrid), Valerie Vomit, Foul Phil, Nat Nerd, Windy Winston and Messy Tessie. All of these creatures are gross, but Messy Tessie is especially nauseating in the execution of the character, with lots of snot and slime oozing out of her nose and mouth.\n\nI haven’t even told you yet about Dodger’s obsession with older girl/bully Tangerine (Katie Barberi), and how that leads to him basically starting a sweatshop full of the Garbage Pail Kids making clothes to impress Tangerine, who happens to be an aspiring fashion designer. The third act all concerns Captain Manzini and Dodger busting the Kids out of the Institute for the Ugly.\n\nThis movie is abysmal, but in a wonderful way. If you are a bad movie fan, (and if you’re reading this blog, the chances are excellent that you are) then this movie may be for you. But, don’t say I didn’t warn you.\n\nSpace Jam. 1996. Dir. Joe Pytka. With Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Theresa Randle, Manner Washington, Eric Gordon, Penny Bae Bridge, Brandon Hammond, Larry Bird, Bill Murray, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Shawn Bradley, Billy West (voice), Dee Bradley Baker (voice), Danny DeVito (voice), Bob Bergen (voice), Bill Farmer (voice), June Foray (voice), Maurice LeMarche (voice), Kath Soucie (voice). Written by Leo Benvenuti & Steve Rudnik and Timothy Harris & Weingrod.\n\nBadness:\n\nEnjoyment Factor:\n\nNostalgia is a funny thing. On the one hand, I am aware that this is just a big, sweaty marketing ploy: Bugs Bunny! Michael Jordan! References to just about every product relevant to nineties popular culture! I mean, the entire film was “inspired” by a popular series of Nike commercials starring Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny. Can art really spring from something like that?\n\nOn the other hand, wasn’t It’s a Wonderful Life inspired by a Christmas card? Even though the movie is basically an eighty-eight minute advertisement for the NBA, Nike and McDonald’s, it’s still Bugs Bunny. The movie, with it’s glossy look and bright colors, looks great. It’s a movie that snaps, crackles and pops on screen. Michael Jordan, in his feature film debut, is actually quite capable in his performance, I mean this is an athlete forced to act alongside a bunch of people in green motion-capture suits for weeks at a time, and he does a heck of a job (below is a behind-the-scenes picture capturing MJ during the filming).\n\nNot having seen Space Jam since I was in middle school (and I watched it in middle school over and over), I wasn’t sure how well it had aged. If you put aside all expectations, this film holds up pretty well. It is goofy and all over-the-place, but would you expect any less from a movie about Michael Jordan being abducted by Looney Tunes in order to coach them basketball against a bunch of bulked-up aliens? Michael Jordan and Bugs have a natural rapport in their scenes. All of the basketball players are well-cast in their supporting roles (especially Patrick Ewing). Bill Murray steals the movie in his scenes.\n\nThe Looney Tunes themselves seem restrained, until the third act, which allows all of the characters to get wild and crazy. Bugs himself seems to be acting more as a follower than as an individualist and anarchist, which is very un-Bugs. The great Chuck Jones, who helped create the look and style of the Looney Tunes, was critical of Space Jam for these very reasons (Director Joe Dante actually made 2003’s Looney Tunes: Back in Action as a response to this film). The Tunes seem, in this story, totally dependent on Michael Jordan in a way these characters wouldn’t really be. It’s this factor that awarded this film its one garbage can.\n\nHowever, quibbles aside, this is a fun movie. It is a ridiculous movie in lots of ways, but there’s still much to recommend in this film (I didn’t even mention Wayne Knight as Michael Jordan’s sniveling and manic agent). Michael Chapman, the cinematographer behind Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and The Lost Boys, gives the film a rich, glossy, deeply textured look which, again, looks great on blu-ray, or the HD streaming option. If you haven’t seen it in a while, grab a Big Mac, put on those Air Jordans, drink your Gatorade and make sure your Hanes aren’t on backwards. You will believe you can fly."
