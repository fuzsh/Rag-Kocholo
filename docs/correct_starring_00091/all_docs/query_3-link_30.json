        "text": "Jupiter Ascending\n\nOne of the key aspects of any science fiction or fantasy saga is world (or universe) building. This process refers to the creation and development of the reality in which the story transpires. More than mere background, it informs plot development, c...\n\nJurassic World\n\nIt has been 22 years since Jurassic Park ushered in the modern age of computer generated imagery, becoming the first motion picture to use the then-cutting edge special effects technology to astound and amaze us. Director Steven Spielberg allowed us ...\n\nJurassic World: Dominion\n\nThere’s irony at work here. Back when it this long-running franchise began in 1993 with Jurassic Park, it was all about the dinosaurs. The first movie to go all-in using CGI technology, the Steven Spielberg-directed blockbuster caused everyone t...\n\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\n\nThe only thing that separates Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom from the lamentable Jurassic Park III is that the filmmakers of the newest sequel didn’t opt for cheap production values the way they did back in 2001. Both films feel tired an unin...\n\nKids for Cash\n\nThe underlying incident presented in first-time director Robert May's documentary, Kids for Cash, has been called one of the most shocking recent judicial scandals.

A turd of T-Rex proportions, Land of the Lost makes one remember last s...\n\nLast Action Hero\n\nDanny (Austin O'Brien) is addicted to Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger) movies. He's seen the third one six times and now he's eagerly awaiting the released of Jack Slater IV. When his elderly friend Nick (Robert Prosky), the projectionist at a...\n\nLast Kiss, The\n\nI recommend The Last Kiss, but not without a misgiving or two. This movie is essentially a celebration of yuppie angst. It's about people in their late 20s who have issues with commitment and monogamy, who have lost their way and are trying to fin...\n\nLet Him Go\n\nThere was a time when the name “Kevin Costner” on a marquee was a guarantee of a major box office haul.
