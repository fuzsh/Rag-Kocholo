        "text": "A complete misfire when it was released, this action adventure comedy is nonetheless worth a look as it has some clever moments and a neat premise, even if the execution is a bit heavy-handed.\n\nYoung Danny (O’Brien) is a huge fan of the movie character Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger). He’s watching the new Slater movie when the ‘magic ticket’ he is holding transports him into the movie itself, a world where the good guys always win, of course. However, when movie bad guy Benedict (Charles Dance, going seriously over the top) realises what Danny’s ticket can do, he snatches it so he can travel back to the real world and kill the actor who plays Slater (Schwarzenegger, of course), so Slater no longer exists in the movie world.\n\nIt’s clever (and often head-scratching) stuff, but one of the problems here is having a kid protagonist who appeals to junior viewers (while annoying grown-ups), yet making the film so explosive and violent it gets a ‘15’ certificate. Kids old enough to watch it will enjoy the adventure, however, while grown-ups will get a few laughs from some of the movie in-jokes peppered throughout the film.\n\nIs Last Action Hero suitable for kids? Here are our parents’ notes...\n\nThere is nothing in the movie that should scare the over-12s."
