        "text": "The actor, next starring with George Clooney and Brad Pitt in \"Wolfs,\" will attend Sarasota Film Festival with the film and director/co-writer Ethan Berger, and receive a Rising Star Award.\n\nSarasota Film Festival \"The Line\" Screening, with Austin Abrams and Ethan Berger in Attendance: 3 p.m. Saturday; Regal Hollywood, 1993 Main Street, Sarasota; $30; 941-364-9514; sarasotafilmfestival.com\n\nThis year, Sarasota Film Festival's lineup of celebrity guests will include one of the area's very own — an actor who went from appearing in community theater productions to one of today's biggest TV shows and, soon, a movie with George Clooney and Brad Pitt.\n\nThe Sarasota-raised Austin Abrams will attend this year's festival for a Saturday centerpiece screening of his new film \"The Line,\" with director and co-writer Ethan Berger also in attendance, and to receive the festival's Rising Star Award. Featuring fellow rising stars such as Alex Wolff, Lewis Pullman and Halle Bailey, \"The Line\" follows a fraternity that finds its order disrupted by defiant pledge Gettys O'Brien, played by Abrams.\n\nInterview: Steve Buscemi on new film 'The Listener,' working with Coen brothers, Tarantino\n\n100-plus fun things to do in April in Sarasota, Bradenton, Venice, Punta Gorda\n\nTicket Newsletter: Sign up to receive restaurant news and reviews plus info on things to do every Friday\n\nThe 27-year-old Abrams is perhaps best known for his role on HBO's hit show \"Euphoria,\" along with appearing on other series such as AMC's \"The Walking Dead,\" NBC's \"This is Us\" and Netflix's \"Dash & Lily,\" as well as films including \"Brad's Status,\" \"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\" and \"Chemical Hearts.\" This September, he co-stars with Clooney and Pitt in the thriller \"Wolfs,\" the new movie by \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" director Jon Watts.\n\nIn an April 4 Zoom interview with the Herald-Tribune, Abrams and Berger discussed \"The Line,\" with Abrams also speaking about his time in Sarasota as well as working with the casts of \"Euphoria\" and \"Wolfs.\" Here are excerpts, edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nBeing from Sarasota, Austin, can you talk about the community arts organizations you worked with while you were here and how they influenced you, and how it feels to come back and be recognized by the festival?\n\nAustin Abrams: I started at Florida Studio Theatre when I was a kid, and at camp. Looking back at it now, I think I really needed it because it was the only place I could really express myself or help me open up. I worked at the Golden Apple Dinner Theatre, which is closed now, I worked at Asolo. I was thinking if I was born somewhere else, like a different part of Florida even, I certainly wouldn’t be doing what I was doing and I probably wouldn’t be where I’m at emotionally, because I wouldn’t have needed to dig around in emotional areas. But yeah, coming back, it’s kind of crazy. I remember being at the festival years ago watching, I think it was, “God’s Pocket” with Philip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nEthan, what interested you in \"The Line\" for your directorial feature debut, and Austin, what interested you in the material as an actor?\n\nEthan Berger: Thanks for having us, by the way, I’m really excited to come out to the festival and also get an opportunity to see where Austin’s from, who is such an important part of this whole process and a great person, inspiring person to work with. What drew me to the material is that I went to college and saw how fraternities have a lot of influence; it was something that I observed firsthand, and that lent itself to the style of filmmaking I’m interested in. Another thing that drew me to the project and to the subject matter is that, to me, it’s another example of the way in which Americans can prioritize tradition over the lives of their neighbors.\n\nAA: For me, it was I’m friends with Alex Wolff, who’s the lead in this movie, and we’d been trying to do something together for a little bit. He wanted to get me in on this and pitched me for a couple different parts, actually. And then finally it was seeming like the movie was going to happen, I started talking to Ethan, we just had a lot of conversations about it and I could see that he had a clear vision for it and felt like someone I could really trust. Initially, Alex brought me because I wanted to work with him, and then the character of Gettys was a very interesting and intricate kind of character. It was fun to delve into this idea of ultra-masculinity, and play around with that in a way. But it was just a great script, and it was great people, so that’s probably a simpler way to say it.\n\nEthan, how did you go about casting the film where, since casting took place, many of the actors have gone on to big and bright things?\n\nEB: Well, I wrote the first draft of the script in 2012, right after I had graduated college. I got cast attached in 2018, so there were like six years of trying to get there. Basically, I had a producer who was able to take me into the agencies and they set me up on general meetings. I just made sure to get a real sense of the people who I met with and see if I thought we’d work well together, and save their numbers. I was just lucky to get this group, and they really all pushed each other and were selfless and gave it everything they had in every scene. All you can want as a filmmaker from any collaborator, whether it’s crew or cast, is for them to be invested and believe in what you’re doing, and I was lucky in that regard.\n\nThe cast also includes Angus Cloud who, sadly, we lost last year. Can you talk about your experience with him, both working on this film and, for Austin, on \"Euphoria\" as well?\n\nEB: It’s incredibly loaded for both of us. He was an incredible person, magic, and just inspiring and sincere and not a disingenuous bone in his body. He was also just a great actor; he was just very present and knew how to convey things through action and not say too much. Just a real special person who I miss all the time.\n\nAA: I was just thinking about him today. I’ll just keep thinking, “Damn, I cannot believe that’s he gone.\" It’s just crazy. He was a person you just want to be around, and it’s funny, every time he texted us or wanted to hang out or whatever, we were all so excited, we all had just a real love for him. I don’t know if I’ve really seen people get as genuinely excited to hang out with a person or just to receive a message from a person because that’s how special they are. Being with him, I feel like everyone always felt more genuine, because he was such a genuine guy that he kind of brought that out of everyone he was around. He inspired me in that way big-time, as a person and as an actor.\n\nEB: He was just a very present person, and his absence is felt.\n\nObviously, it's on pause right now, but could you talk about working with the \"Euphoria\" cast for these past two seasons, Austin?\n\nAA: I mean, it's great, I've loved it. Sam Levinson is an amazing creator, the cast is great and amazing, and all the characters are so specific. I loved every day I was working, I feel like I learned every day I was working, tried to watch everyone as much as possible. I loved that set, it was always moving and changing, which I really liked and kept everyone on their feet.\n\nI imagine you still can't talk much about the film itself, but I was curious if you could talk a little about, having \"Wolfs\" coming up, the experience working with George Clooney and Brad Pitt?\n\nAA: Yeah, I mean, it was super wild. I still remember being in the car and getting out on the first day of filming and everything like that and being like, “Damn, I’m about to go on a real adventure here.” It was just super wild, and sometimes I’ll think “I can’t really believe I did that,” in a way. Because I just watched those guys growing up, as everyone did, so it was just kind of nuts. But I loved working with them; they were sick, they were really everything I could’ve asked for. They are that cool and fun to be around. It was a super special time that I’m very grateful that I got to have, even though sometimes it doesn’t feel like it was me when I look back at it.\n\nAnd Ethan, I know you're still in the process of promoting this film, but do you have any idea what your next project might be?\n\nEB: Yeah, so I adapted a novel with the novelist called “Early Work,” and the novelist is named Andrew Martin. I’m going to make that next, I think.\n\nIs there anything else we didn't mention that you wanted to add?\n\nEB: I just want to say how proud we all are of Austin, all of us who worked on “The Line,” and what he continues to accomplish. I feel lucky to have worked on a movie with the inspiring people that I got a chance to work with.\n\nAA: Ethan killed it with this movie. It’s one of my favorite things that I’ve done, so I’m excited that people are going to get to see it."
