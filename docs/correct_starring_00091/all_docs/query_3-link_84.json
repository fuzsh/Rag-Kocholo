        "text": "16. Suite Francaise (2014)\n\nDirector: Saul Dibb.\n\nWriters: Saul Dibb, Matt Charman. Based on the novel by Irene Nemisovsky.\n\nStarring Michelle Williams, Matthias Schoenaerts, Kristin Scott Thomas, Margot Robbie.\n\nWe don’t usually think of historical drama when we think of Robbie, which is why this 2014 feature is worthy of singling out on her movie bio. Based on the Irene Nemirovsky novel of the same name, “Suite Francaise” is a WWII romantic drama that surrounds the relationship of a French villager (Williams) and a German soldier (Schoenaerts) during the German occupation of France. Robbie portrays a tenant named Celine who is also having a relationship with e German soldier (hey, it was all about survival back then), and her supportive work left an impression.\n\n15. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot (2016)\n\nDirectors: Glenn Ficarra, John Requa.\n\nWriter: Robert Carlock.\n\nBased on the book “The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan” by Kim Barker.\n\nStars Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, Martin Freeman, Alfred Molina, Christopher Abbott, Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nA biographical wartime comedy-drama, based on the book by cable news producer-turned-war correspondent Kim Barker, that stars Fey as Barker, charting her adventures in 2002 during Operation Enduring Freedom. Robbie turns in a steady and assured performance as Tanya Vanderpoel, a more seasoned British TV journo who takes Kim under her wing. The movie bombed at the box office but received top marks for its acting particularly that of Fey and Robbie. The title, by the way, refers to the military slang “WTF” – and we all know what that means.\n\n14. Mary Queen of Scots (2018)\n\nDirector: Josie Rourke.\n\nWriter: Beau Willimon.\n\nStars Saoirse Ronan, Margot Robbin, Jack Lowden, Richard Cant.\n\nBased on the book “Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart” by Dr. John Guy.\n\nA fun feature that permitted Robbie an opportunity to stretch her acting muscles. The movie, based on the 2004 bio by Dr. John Guy, surrounds the cousin rivalry of Mary (Ronan) and Queen Elizabeth I (Robbie) as they battle for the British throne they both believe is rightful their own. Both Robbie and Ronan turn in splendid work in a tale that finds them intertwined in patriarchal drama and duty to their kingdom. That Marhot Robbie we see here bears little resemblance to the one we see later in films like “Bombshell” and “Babylon,” demonstrating a surprising range.\n\n13. Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey (2020)\n\nDirector: Cathy Yan.\n\nWriter: Christina Hodson. Harley Quinn created by Paul Dini, Bruce Timm.\n\nStars Margot Robbie, Rosie Perez, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett, Ewan McGregor, Chris Messina.\n\nAn outrageous DC superhero flick that stars Robbie as the Harley Quinn of the title in a movie ripe with “I am woman, hear me roar!” estrogen. Having just broken up with the Joker, Harley now finds herself targeted by a crime boss (McGregor) and other assorted thugs. So she joins forces with Huntress (Winstead), Black Canary (Smollett) and Renee Montoya (Perez) to fend off the male evil. Robbie looks to be having the time of her life in this comic book fantasy, and it shows off a devil-may-care sense of mischief here that’s enormously appealing.\n\n12. Z for Zachariah (2015)\n\nDirector: Craig Zobel.\n\nWriter: Nissar Modi. Based on the book by Robert C. O’Brien.\n\nStars: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Chris Pine, Margot Robbie.\n\nIn this harrowing sci-fi adventure, Robbie portrays Ann Burden, a woman minding her own business living a quiet midwestern life who suddenly finds herself struggling to survive a nuclear apocalypse. But somehow, “Z for Zachariah” turns into a love story about two men (Ejiofor and Pine) who are fighting for her love because, let’s face it, there aren’t a lot of women left to love following the nuke. It sounds kind of dumb, but Robbie rises to the acting challenge and makes the love-triangle plot work and work well. A film no one has heard of that showcased her growing talents.\n\n11. Focus (2015)\n\nWriter-directors: Glenn Ficarra, John Requa.\n\nStars: Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Rodrigo Santoro, Gerald McRaney, Adrian Martinez, BD Wong.\n\nA crime drama that finds Robbie stealing scenes from an Oscar winner. “Focus” stars Smith as a con artist named Nicky who is inspired teach Jess (Robbie) the tricks of his trade. Predictably, she falls for him. Not so predictably, it’s she who we find much more believable in her performance. The chemistry between the two leads is intriguing, and the storyline proves to be reasonably compelling. But it’s Robbie’s work that saves the movie. She’s highly appealing in a role she could have gotten away with mailing in, but doesn’t. In fact, she brings the part a surprising depth.\n\n10. About Time (2013)\n\nWriter-director: Richard Curtis.\n\nStars Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams, Bill Nighy, Lydia Wilson, Lindsay Duncan, Richard Cordery, Margot Robbie.\n\nYou don’t see a whole lot of time-travel romantic dramas, but “About Time” is one. And it’s not a bad one. It stars Gleeson as a guy who one day finds our from his dad (Nighy) that the men in their family can travel through time. So, he decides to go back and get a girlfriend, who turns out to be McAdams. But his first try is with Robbie’s character, who it turns out wants nothing to do with him. She does a terrific job with material that quite honestly is only moderately interesting. Robbie makes it her own with a charismatic portrayal that leaves us fully understanding her rejection.\n\n9. The Suicide Squad (2021)\n\nWriter-director: James Gunn.\n\nStars Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Pete Davidson, Joel Kinnaman, Michael Rooker, Viola Davis, Nathan Fillion.\n\nIn this quick follow=up to her last Harley Quinn movie, Robbie is back again as Harley, who this time has to take on baddies with even higher-tech weapons like Peacemaker (Cena), Blackguard (Davidson) and Bloodsport (Elba). Hey, it’s a living. Robbie is technically the star here but is mostly entwined as part of the ensemble, and she proves to be a dynamic team player. Her role here is even juicier and more diverse than her “Birds of Prey” character, and it’s fascinating to watch her strut her stuff in a comic book action movie of such intense ambition.\n\n8. Amsterdam (2022)\n\nWriter-director: David O. Russell.\n\nStars Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, John David Washington, Andrea Riseborough, Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Rock, Michael Shannon, Mike Myers, Taylor Swift, Robert De Niro, Zoe Saldana, Timothy Olyphant, Rami Malek.\n\nLet’s be honest: David O. Russell’s “Amsterdam” in a bizarre monstrosity of a film that was savaged by critics. But the offbeat period comedy/mystery/crime thriller showcases Robbie in a new and interesting way. She plays Valerie Voze, an enigmatic nurse who creates art out of the shrapnel she extracts from wounded soldiers. There is nothing historically accurate in the depiction, but Robbie gives her a goofy charm that’s infectious. It doesn’t hurt that she’s surrounded by stars like Bale, De Niro, Malek, Myers, even Taylor Swift.\n\n7. The Big Short (2015)\n\nDirector: Adam McKay.\n\nWriters: Adam McKay, Charles Randolph. Based on the book by Michael Lewis.\n\nStars Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell, Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt, Rudy Eisenzopf.\n\nYes, it’s an incredibly short appearance, but it’s so inspired it doesn’t matter. It hilariously features Robbie – in this film that reduces complex and arcane Wall Street verbiage to the easily understandable – appearing as herself in a bubble bath sipping champagne and joyously explaining the whole idea of how the financial system imploded on sub-prime mortgages. It’s so perfect that it’s become legendary in the Robbie film canon. It doesn’t hurt that the movie itsself, featuring Carell, Bale, Gosling and Pitt, also happens to be exceptionally good. But Robbie nearly steals the show in little more than a minute.\n\n6. Bombshell (2019)\n\nDirector: Jay Roach.\n\nWriter: Charles Randolph. Stars Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, John Lithgow, Allison Janney, Malcolm McDowell, Kate McKinnon, Connie Britton, Mark Duplass.\n\nA positively phenomenal cast (Theron, Kidman, Robbie, Lithgow, Janney) illuminates this biopic that tells the mostly-factual story about how a group of women at Fox News took on founder Roger Ailes, #MeToo style, over the toxic atmosphere and sexual misconduct he perpetuated. Robbie portrays the fictitious character Kayla Pospisil, who is the target of some of Ailes’ (Lithgow) worst behavior. She brings great humanity to a part that could have been one-note but is instead rich and multi-faceted. It deservedly earned Robbie a 2020 Oscar nomination for supporting actress.\n\n5. The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese.\n\nWriter: Terence Winter. Based on the book by Jordan Belfort.\n\nStars Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal, Jon Favreau, Joanna Lumley.\n\n“Wolf of Wall Street” is a memorable and brilliantly-acted black comedy/crime film from the incomparable Scorsese, based on Jordan Belfort’s book about his drug-popping, booze-swilling, womanizing criminal behavior as a Wall Street tycoon (played with panache by DiCaprio). In it, Robbie brilliantly portrays his second wife Naomi Lapaglia, a woman who doesn’t take any crap. In one memorable scene. she makes her husband crawl on his hands and knees before placing her high-heel on his forehead and making him beg. That, ladies and gentlemen, is entertainment.\n\n4. Once Upon a Time in…Hollywood (2019)\n\nWriter-director: Quentin Tarantino.\n\nStars Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, Julia Butters, Austin Butler, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, Luke Petty, Damian Lewis, Al Pacino.\n\nIn the 1960s-set Tinseltown epic that Tarantino believes is his best film – certainly his best that agreeably captures some revisionist history – Robbie portrays Sharon Tate, who was murdered by the Manson Family clan in 1969. Except that instead of being slaughtered here (SPOILER ALERT!), she avoids her horrible fate, survives and becomes pals with Cliff Booth (Pitt) instead. It’s a perfectly-wrought, natural performance from Robbie, who infuses the sunny Tate with a sweetness and light that’s palpable. She deserved an Oscar nomination for it but failed to get one.\n\n3. Barbie (2023)\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig. Writers: Greta Gerwig, Noah Baumbach. Starring Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Will Farrell, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, Kingsley Ben-Adir.\n\nRobbie faced an enormous challenge in bringing America’s favorite toy doll to life — could she make audiences care about a piece of plastic? In “Barbie,” Robbie’s character arc was a daunting one — a sunny and oblivious Barbie in Barbieland turns shocked and disillusioned in the Real World, finally becoming determined and hopeful upon her return home. Thanks to a multi-layered script by Noah Baumbach and director Greta Gerwig, Robbie was able to reveal her character’s transitions slowly and with seeming ease — this is a character that could have gone so wrong so easily, but Robbie keeps her character arc firmly on track, and the result is an improbable triumph.\n\n2. I, Tonya (2017)\n\nDirector: Craig Gillespie.\n\nWriter: Steven Rogers.\n\nStars Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney, Julianne Nicholson, Paul Walter Hauser, Bobby Cannavale.\n\nIn a portrayal that rightly earned Robbie an Academy Award nomination for lead actress, she does an exceptional job as Tonya Harding, the rough-hewn figure skater who gets embroiled in the physical attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Her work elevates Harding to the tragic figure she was, one surrounded by airheaded thugs (well-played by Stan and Hauser) and a piece of work of a mother (Janney). Robbie’s depiction provides a masterful exploration of the nuances and pressure the ruthless Tonya was under before the big event.\n\n1. Babylon (2022)\n\nWriter-director: Damien Chazelle.\n\nStars Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Diego Calva, Jean Smart, Olivia Wilde, Tobey Maguire.\n\nCritics have generally been split on the quality of “Babylon,” which may well be the most over-the-top big studio (Paramount) release of the modern era with its oversized depiction of depravity and decadence of Hollywood in the 1920s and ’30s. But the verdict on Robbie’s chaotic, freewheeling performance as the fictitious star Nellie LaRoy (a takeoff on Clara Bow) is less debated. She’s astonishingly good in a role she got reportedly only after Emma Stone dropped out. Regardless, it’s an energetic and unrestrained piece of acting that’s already earned her Golden Globes and Critics Choice nominations."
