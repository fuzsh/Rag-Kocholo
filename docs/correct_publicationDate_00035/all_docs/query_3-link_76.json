        "text": "Sure, Clark Ashton Smith’s stories are readily available online, it’s still nice to have hard copies of his works. When I originally read them it was in the Panther reprints of his Arkham House collections, which retain some tampering and revisions and censoring by various hands. When William Burns tipped me off on my previous article that Night Shade Books’ Collected Fantasies of Clark Ashton Smith series had presented the definitive versions of his short stories, restored as closely as possible to his intended texts by Scott Connors and Ron Hilger, I decided to retire my Panther paperbacks – which by now are a bit tatty – and pick up the new line to reintroduce myself to Smith in a whole new way.\n\nConnors and Hilger arrange the anthologies in as close to chronological order of composition of the stories as they can attain. This is a bit of a break from previous attempts to anthologise Smith, which have tended to collect the stories from his various fictional settings like Hyperborea and Zothique into little clumps, but it does mean that we get to see Smith’s writing evolve over the span of time presented.\n\nIt’s not exactly amateurish to begin with, mind. Connors and Hilger don’t include Smith’s juvenilia in the main run of the series – what was available at the time was collected in Miscellaneous Writings, a companion volume, and other early prose fiction from Smith has been rediscovered and reprinted by Hippocampus Press. Instead, volume one – The End of the Story, picks things up in 1925, when Smith – encouraged by his pen pal H.P. “Creepy Howie” Lovecraft – decided to try his hand at it.\n\nSmith famously lived with his parents in a remote cabin in the woods in Auburn, California, and his parents were unwell; Smith needed to earn some money to support them, and so whilst Lovecraft thought that Smith’s writing talents would lend themselves well to producing short stories of high literary quality, he also noted that if you could churn out stories at a decent pace and get them accepted regularly you could earn a living which, whilst not exceptional, was at least better than trying to earn a crust through poetry, which was the mode Smith had previously been working in.\n\nThe friendship between Lovecraft and Smith is interesting both for their differences in temperament and character – despite being geographically isolated in his cabin rather than living in the heart of an East Coast city, Smith was much more of a man of the world than Lovecraft was – and for the parallels between them, and one of the things they had in common was a grounding in poetry. Lovecraft’s poetry prior to his shift into prose fiction, as I have discussed before, was absolutely fucking awful and he never managed to make any sort of career out of it, but Smith’s was a different matter. Mentored as he was by George Sterling, his poetry was a sort of Californian response to and development of the sensuous, decadent themes of the likes of Baudelaire (Smith attempted a translation of Fleurs du Mal, for instance), and he’d made some headway in poetic circles before he took his turn into prose fiction.\n\nThe upshot of this is that come 1925, Smith’s poetic instincts and methods had been honed to the point where even in writing prose fiction he couldn’t quite step away from them – and nor should he have, because they helped to give him a distinctive voice. It allows him to really bring his vivid visual imagination to life on the page, and allows him to write about the emotional inner life of his characters with a vividness often lacking in the work of Robert E. Howard or Lovecraft.\n\nWhilst his initial scratchings in 1925 didn’t necessarily accomplish much, he’d address the problem of prose fiction again in 1929, and then he cracked it – or at least, got sufficient positive results to persuade him that he’d cracked it, and from then on he ended up writing the bulk of his prose fiction in a great glut that spanned from 1929 to 1937, after which his output of fiction became incredibly sparse until his death in the early 1960s. His parents had died, taking away the immediate need to get those cheques from the pulps, and both Robert E. Howard and Lovecraft had died as well, and without Lovecraft in particular to talk shop with the process of writing fiction seems to have stopped being fun for Smith. It’s evident from the notes on the stories here that Smith took as much joy in sharing his stories with Lovecraft and discussing their craft together as he did in terms of writing the stories themselves.\n\nStill, that sad day is still far off here in volume 1 of the collection. Connors and Hilger aptly preface the stories with Smith’s 1929 prose-poem To the Daemon, in which he appeals to the titular entity to regale him with myths and fantasies from far beyond the world we know; as Ramsey Campbell notes in his introduction, the stories that follow can be seen as the daemon’s response. From there we launch into 1925’s The Abominations of Yondo, which was rejected at the time by most venues as being more of a prose-poem than a narrative. This isn’t entirely fair – there most certainly is a narrative here, but it’s admittedly a bit of a thin one and is mostly an excuse for the narrator to encounter lots of spooky shit in the titular alien-haunted desert before they lose their cool and rush back to face the devil they know. Equally, so what if it’s a prose-poem when the prose is this polished?\n\nSadastor, penned in the same glimmer of activity in 1925 as Yondo, fits the “prose poem” claim much better. It’s constructed around the central image of a siren of a world so ancient that its seas have dried up, leaving her stuck in a pool and doomed to die when it runs out, and presented as a parable told by one monster to cheer up another, as though the creatures and spirits of evil need their comfort from stories too.\n\nIt’s also got a through-line of eroticism which would become a regular thing in Smith and set him apart from Lovecraft – who, if he wasn’t actually on the asexual spectrum, did a damn good impression of someone on there – and Howard, for whom sexuality tended to either be something men cajoled women into participating in (if they didn’t just violently force them) or something bad women did to distract and tamper with men, rather than something that both men and women can derive enjoyment from as an end in itself.\n\nWhilst Smith is occasionally guilty of using the “evil temptress” trope – hell, here the main women mentioned are a siren who got off on luring mariners to their deaths and a lamia whose predation tactics are similarly sexual – he rarely applies the trope with the overtone of apparent bitterness to it as Howard does (he seems to remember that succumbing to the wiles of an evil temptress is kind of fun in a way which Howard didn’t seem to entirely buy into), and will occasionally include male and female characters interested in sex and/or romance without an ulterior motive, which Howard flat-out didn’t seem to believe in. It is, perhaps, no accident that Smith is said to have been the most romantically and sexually active of the trio.\n\nIn particular, Smith carried on a long relationship with Genevieve K. Sully, a married woman some 13 years his senior; it was on a 1927 camping trip with her and her daughters that he became inspired to write more stories, partly from the lovely scenery they encountered and partly because she suggested it would be the best way for him to earn a bit of money. The Ninth Skeleton starts off, then, on a semi-autobiographical note, the narrator setting out from his cabin in the woods to rendezvous with Guenevere, his love who he has to meet secretly due to social disapproval. In the story, her parents disapprove of the connection and refuse permission to marry; in real life, of course, Genevieve wasn’t divorced, but married to someone else – whilst I can’t dig up much biographical information on the finer details, divorce was of course a trickier matter back then than it is today, as Sonia Greene discovered to her annoyance in trying to legally disentangle herself from Lovecraft. The sinister visions of the narrator on his way to his tryst suggest that he’s in two minds about getting more deeply involved himself…\n\nAfter these preliminary works we come to 1929, when Smith pulls his sleeves up and decides he’s going to properly break into the pulp market, having landed The Ninth Skeleton in Weird Tales in 1928. In The Last Incantation the dreadful wizard Malygris learns that whilst you can revisit your lost loves of the past, you can’t ever again see them through the eyes of the person you used to be. Perhaps the most significant development here is the establishment of setting – Malygris lives in Poseidonis, a realm that consists of the last portions of Atlantis to remain above water. First mentioned by Algernon Blackwood in a 1912 short story, Smith would set enough stories there to make the place thoroughly his own, and references to the lost ages of Atlantis and Hyperborea here help place these stories in the wider arc of Smith’s fantasies of other ages of Earth, in which Hyperborea is the first civilisation (in keeping with then-current theories) and Zothique is the last.\n\nWhilst Smith is well-known for his stable of settings – each with its own distinctive flavour and themes – he didn’t seem especially quick to latch onto the idea and develop it extensively at this stage of his career; he doesn’t return to Poseidonis until the last story in this collection, A Voyage to Sfanomoë. With Poseidonis due to fall within a generation two brothers, both scientists, here decide to flee the destruction by constructing a nuclear-powered spaceship to take them to Venus. Smith greatly underestimates the speeds possible in space travel, estimating that it would take decades to reach Venus, but this wrinkle is aesthetically appropriate to the story he intends to tell of how the brothers, spurning the rest of humankind, end up losing their humanity; as we’ll see, it also plays on a recurring theme in these early stories of Venus as a likely first target for offworld exploration.\n\nAnother Smith setting that sees its debut here is the haunted French region of Averoigne, which would become Smith’s go-to region whenever he wanted a historical European setting for a story ranging from the Dark Ages to the Enlightenment, with Averoigne being witness to many a strange event over the course of the centuries. Our first visit there, The End of the Story, is set in the late 18th Century and masterfully replicates the style of the Gothic fiction of that time. The bulk of the story tells of a law student who stumbles upon the lair of a lamia; the actual end of the story is left for the reader to judged, based on whether they consider the lamia to be a vile Satanic threat or a wondrous survivor of a pagan past.\n\nSmith’s sympathies seem to lie more with sensuous paganism than self-denying monasticism, particularly in the depiction of the protagonist’s passion for the lamia, even despite the fact that he was told that the lamia’s idyllic realm is an illusion and that she will kill him. His ecstatic memories of her triumph over the fear of death, and indeed feed into an eroticised notion of death that Smith picked up from Baudelaire and peers and ran with. Lovecraft would have dug the classical riffs – and Smith has his protagonist discover the story of a previous victim sent into the lamia’s clutches after encountering a satyr in the woods, so maybe Smith was inspired by Lovecraft’s oft-repeated anecdote about summoning satyrs and nymphs during his childhood bout of paganism. Then again, the story indulges in way more eroticism than Lovecraft ever contemplated; perhaps the satyrs and nymphs stopped appearing to Lovecraft because they realised he’d never really be interested in what they were after. (Or perhaps some other power asserted a prior claim to ownership.)\n\nEither way, the conception of Averoigne being a realm where the creatures of classical myth still reside seems to have been an important part of its initial conception (though later stories would veer away from it); later in this anthology, The Satyr takes us back to Averoigne and provides further confirmation that the titular carnal entities haunt that land. Here Connors and Hilger restore the original ending to the story; whereas later printings of it offered a conclusion based around abduction and implied rape, the original concept was a full-blown tragedy involving flat-out murder, which I tend to prefer aesthetically.\n\nThe last of Smith’s major settings to make its debut here is Hyperborea, Earth’s primal first civilisation, and it’s interesting how The Tale of Satampra Zeiros there’s already a sense that Hyperborea itself is already ancient. The story is based around a duo of thieves doing some grave-robbing in the ruins of the deserted city of Commoriom (the abandonment of which would later be depicted in the story The Testament of Athammaus) – in fact, the disaster was long enough ago that the protagonists’ visit is as much an archaeological process as a larcenous one.\n\nSmith introduces the world to one of his most widely-namechecked fictional creations here when our antiheroes make the mistake of entering the shrine of Tsathoggua. As well as introducing us to Tsathoggua’s liquid shapechanging spawn (think Terminator 2‘s T-1000 shapeshifting capabiltiies and liquid nature combined with the inhuman malevolence of John Carpenter’s The Thing and the disgustingness of one of Lovecraft’s shoggoths), this was also the debut of Tsathoggua himself, described as a god so old that human beings don’t worship him any more, though wild beasts do.\n\nThe description of Tsathoggua here makes him sound endearingly derpy, and in their correspondence Smith and Lovecraft seem to have regarded him as downright cute. (I think it helps that he’s meant to look like a sort of bat-toad-sloth.) Whilst subsequent Cthulhu Mythos stories – including Lovecraft’s own The Mound – have tried to derive horror from him, in later material Smith would use Tsathoggua to express his particular dry sense of humour, particularly in The Seven Geases where Tsathoggua shows up and has a chat with the protagonist.\n\nThough these stories provide the foundations for later and superior works by Smith, other stories in the collection illustrate how he was still finding his voice here. Like many authors working through that process, Smith would write his fair share of stories riffing on the style of predecessors he admired. For instance, there’s a touch of Ambrose Bierce about The Phantoms of the Fire, which otherwise isn’t much to write home about; Bierce was better at this sort of twist-ending ghost story, and the tale is notable mainly for its depiction of the Auburn evergreen forest where Smith lurked in his cabin. The Resurrection of the Rattlesnake, meanwhile, is a story that Smith himself admitted owed a lot to Bierce; here, the forces of the supernatural conspire to mock both a sceptical horror author and his friends who seek to shake him out of his sceptical attitude equally.\n\nOther stories seem to be an attempt to riff on Poe, much as Lovecraft had his own Poe phase. A Night in Malnéant is verges on being another extended prose-poem, in which narrator is mourning the death of the lady Mariel, who killed herself as a result of his abusive behaviour towards her. When he comes to the titular city it is locked in grief and bereavement, and despite every attempt by the narrator to deny it, it is truly his own Mariel they are mourning. Thirteen Phantasms takes us to a man’s deathbed, where he is haunted by Elspeth, the woman who broke his heart (and whose heart he perhaps broke himself if he’d be more honest with himself) – and the twelve women whose hearts he broke for their failure to be Elspeth. The Epiphany of Death is a brief fantasy about a man who discovers his friend Tomeron has, in fact, been long-dead for the entire span of their acquaintance; it’s dedicated to Lovecraft and it’s pretty evidence that it’s a character study of him, dressed up in morbid and fantastical terms for Smith and Lovecraft’s mutual amusement, with a Poe-esque tone reflecting their common appreciation for the grandmaster.\n\nNone of the Big Three authors of Weird Tales were innocent of racism, though I feel Smith’s fiction is less marred by it than Howard’s or Lovecraft’s; it helps that both Howard and Lovecraft had developed their racism into fully-blown ideologies of hatred, whereas Smith just comes across as being, at worst, a bit clueless and sheltered and too ready to buy into the prejudices of the time.\n\nThe Venus of Azombeii, I’m sorry to report, is an example of Smith at his worst when it comes to racism. It’s set in Africa, and a highly exotified Africa at that, and in addition it has the protagonist discover a lost tribe who’d been colonised by the Romans back in the day and therefore, whilst being dark skinned, are explicitly described as retaining a lot of Roman features and having a level of culture above that of their neighbours, and the protagonist is willing to contemplate banging one of the tribe when he otherwise wouldn’t consider banging a black woman. It’s fucking dreadful, with the only silver lining being a moment of badassery on the part of the queen of the tribe when she has a knife-fight in the water against some crocodiles to save the protagonist and wins handily.\n\nThe story sits in a well-established “white dude wanders into a random tribe and is given an undue level of respect and authority” subgenre of pulp fiction of the era. Whilst it’s unfortunate that Smith engaged in the trope, it’s to his credit that he’d soon recognise some of the inherent flaws in and satirise mercilessly with The Root of Ampoi. Whilst it begins as a fairly straightforward “lost tribe with curious aspects” story by and large, Smith takes the opportunity to cleverly subvert the usual way such stories tended to go in the pulps.\n\nThe story concerns a British sailor who discovers lost tribe of 8-foot-tall matriarchs ruling over an underclass of ordinary-sized men. Matters proceed much as in that “death by Snu-Snu” episode of Futurama, until the protagonist learns of a magic root which the women use to grow themselves to such Chyna-esque proportions; he decides to steal some for himself, so that he can become giant and exert control over his new wife (the queen of the tribe) with his fists – an intention Smith reports in a laconic manner which I think I detect a healthy disapproval in.\n\nHere’s the twist: after denigrating the men of the tribe as effeminate cowards for not doing as he has done and marching in to confront his wife, our sailor man finds her accompanied by the other women of the tribe – and, being massively outnumbered by them, he is quickly overpowered and exiled by them. Whereas the pulps dripped with stories where lone stranger protagonists (often white) turn lost cultures (often majority-PoC) on their heads with ease, here the local cultural mores assert themselves in a much more realistic fashion, and Western gender roles are exposed as localised norms rather than universally applicable rules.\n\nThere’s a few sexist-seeming “Doh ho ho ho, wouldn’t it be terrible if women were in charge” lines earlier in the story, but the fact that the women of the tribe prevail over the protagonist so easily and the men stand aside and let it happen recontextualises those bits as reflecting the protagonist’s own cultural background and prejudices. The overall impression given by the story is that it’s way cool that this tribe with this social order exists out there, and the protagonist is a fool who didn’t recognise or appreciate a sweet deal when he saw one because of his cultural blinkers.\n\nThis whole “the Other is cool and fun and exciting and very often sexy” attitude is a good example of how Smith’s racism differs from Howard or Lovecraft’s “the Other wants to usurp us and take our shit” attitude. When Smith expresses racist views in his fiction, it tends to be the sort of racism which tends more towards Orientalist exotification and fetishisation of other cultures (Smith’s juvenilia is reeking with Orientalism). That obviously isn’t good or something to applaud, but it makes me more tolerant of people saying “Ah, but those were the standards of the time” when it comes to Smith: even if you accept that the vast majority of people in that era were racist in some respect, Howard and Lovecraft’s racism went beyond that – to the point that they got called out for it in their own lifetime – and was rooted in personal philosophies which each in their own way chose to see other cultures as competitors, and therefore enemies, to their own culture – especially when those cultures happen to meet in the melting pot of North America.\n\nSmith, on the other hand, tends to take the approach that the existence of other cultures is wicked cool and awesome; he might have opinions about the superiority of one culture over another, but he doesn’t seem to express the same burning resentment for their existence that Lovecraft or Howard seemed to have. His racial attitudes, where they pop up, can still end up being annoying and patronising and still a problematic element in his fiction, and he was known to make the odd anti-semitic joke in his letters, but Smith at least seemed to have a better angel whispering in his right ear even as the devil of his racism whispered into his left; at least one story of this era seems to be a loud and proud endorsement of mixed-race marriage, which since that was illegal in many states at the time (and would remain illegal in some for decades to come) is pretty decent of him.\n\nThe story I’m alluding to is The Monster of the Prophecy, which bizarrely for a story with its ultimate conclusion has a main character who might well have been based on Lovecraft; he’s a struggling writer given to poetry in old-fashioned formats, who only recently has started experimenting in more modern styles, whose failure to find success in New York has left him miserable – reaching the nadir of his misery somewhere in Brooklyn. (There’s no mention of a failed marriage here – though a Sonia equivalent wouldn’t really have much to do in the story so maybe that’s for the best.) Composed in 1929, a good interval after Lovecraft’s New York jaunt, the opening sections of it are nonetheless highly reminiscent of He, one of Lovecraft’s New York stories, though it goes in a decidedly different direction. This surely isn’t an accident, especially since we know from Smith and Lovecraft’s correspondence that Smith was fully aware of how utterly miserable Lovecraft had become during his New York stint.\n\nThe overall tone of the story is somewhat comical, in a sardonic and low-key sort of way, in that the Lovecraft analogue gets whisked off to another planet by a resident thereof in order to play a role in an audacious scam. Smith, in correspondence with Lovecraft, said that he wanted to do a satirical fantasy story where the satire didn’t trip up the fantasy, and by and large he succeeds. Between the vivid descriptions and unusual aliens, the atmosphere of the whole thing is very Rick and Morty-esque.\n\nEventually, the Lovecraft analogue finds love with an alien space empress of a compatible outlook with his – just as he is mainly known for his Ode to Antares, Antares being the star about which his alien buddy’s planet revolves, she is known for an ode to our own star. Given Smith’s rather cavalier disregard for the marital bond, this can be read as a subtle encouragement to Lovecraft to stop letting his marriage to Sonia Greene confine him (it had in fact been effectively over for some years by this point) and go seek companionship elsewhere. Certainly, if you wanted to depict an ideal partner for Lovecraft, a wealthy empress of similar artistic tastes who could take care of the finances and keep him comfortable like a pet poet would not be a terrible one, though making her an outright alien seems a poor fit, as does giving her any interest in sexytimes.\n\nAt the same time, there’s perhaps a broader social point made here; Smith notes that, despite the interspecies romance, nobody in the Empress’s realm is particularly outraged by it, at most thinking that the Empress has slightly unusual tastes. The story concludes with the statement that “no comment was made: it was her own amour after all, and no one else could carry it on for her. It would seem, from this, that the people of Omanorion had mastered the ultra-civilized art of minding their own business.”\n\nOf course, given his dalliances with married women, Smith might have had his own reasons to espouse a viewpoint that people shouldn’t pillory each other just for their relationship choices, but given the way the interspecies relationship here is treated much like an interracial relationship with the ruler of a far-off country might be in a more conventional adventure story on the one hand, and given the massive social disapproval of mixed-race relationships at the time of writing, I can’t help but think that this is an example of Smith broadly having his heart in the right place, even if it found its way there via circuitous route.\n\nAnother interracial relationship is prominently featured in The Devotee of Evil, though the story is marred up by clueless or simply dated language around race. The term Smith uses to denote that the character of Fifine is mixed-race would be simply unacceptable today; then again, she’s credited with enough wit to save her own and the narrator’s life from her lover’s efforts to get in touch with a cosmological source of pure evil, giving her more agency and relevance than any woman of colour in any of Lovecraft’s tales, and Smith seems to ascribe to her more sophistication and sympathy than Howard would. Smith seems to use her presence to add a whiff of scandal to matters, which is unfortunate, though equally he seems to have a wry approval of said scandal. After all, with his embrace of Baudelaire, Smith could be called a devotee of evil himself.\n\nAnother story from this period which follows The Monster of the Prophecy‘s “dude visits other world, gets laid” outline is The Planet of the Dead, which has an astronomer fall into slumber and dream of a possible past life of his as the inhabitant of a world orbiting a distant star, which is due to go out any time soon, and his rescue and idyllic days with his true love there.\n\nIt’s a lightweight thing in and of itself, but contains one really solid idea – the concept of a dying world whose inhabitants, seeing that the end is nigh, resort to decadent self-indulgence of their whims (whether these be romantic, sadistic, or aesthetic) in what indeterminate time they had left. This formed the concept of his future realm of Zothique, the last civilisation of Earth and the direct inspiration for Vance’s Dying Earth.\n\nBefore that, though, The Necromantic Tale would offer a more Earthbound and horror-oriented take on the “extended period of time lived in a dream of some other incarnation” concept. It is marred slightly by having the protagonist’s mixed-race love interest be a sinister witch; it only partly undoes this damage by depicting Satanic debauchery as being 100% totes awesome.\n\nAs well as writing horror and fantasy-oriented material, Smith was also producing more purely science fictional work at this time, though this is the area where his output seems to be the most variable. The best of the SF-oriented works in this collection is probably The Uncharted Isle, in which a shipwrecked sailor is washed up on a strange island which seems to be in a parallel universe, whose inhabitants show no sign of being able to perceive him and who seem to be caught up in their own enigmatic troubles – and may, perhaps, be stuck in a cycle repeating the awful acts they ended up resorting to out of desperation.\n\nIt’s a decent enough tale which doesn’t outlast its welcome, and it’s nice to have one of the Big Three of Weird Tales depict a culture of PoC who have attained a high level of sophistication and erudition. There also seems to be an anti-religious angle here, with the object of the locals’ worship demanding awful sacrifices of them – and it’s possible to interpret the story as a hideous cyclical pattern that they’ve trapped themselves in as a result of abandoning scientific, rational attempts to resolve their plight in favour of pandering to the more unacceptable demands of the irrational.\n\nAnother pretty good story, if an overlong one, is The Metamorphosis of the World, an alien invasion story which in many aspects is some two or three decades before its time. Smith restricts his poetic and visual imagination to describing the unusual territory cultivated in zones of the Earth which have been subjected to terraforming – ah, I guess it’s Venus-forming – by rays emitted by Venusian colonisation ships, and for much of the story focuses more on speculating about how the world would react under such circumstances.\n\nHis vision is markedly less militaristic than many stories along these lines, with the crisis treated as a scientific problem as opposed to a military one – likely because it is established early on that Earth weapons are near-powerless to stop the process. Whilst not especially based on hard science, it still does an eerily good job of hypothesising how, say, a scientific expedition into an area of unusual radiation might be depicted – and the bit where a farmer and his son witnesses the landing of one of the Venusian scout craft is incredibly reminiscent of UFO reports of later decades. Then again, the contactee scene did get influenced by the Theosophical groups and other flavours of occult movement that were thick on the ground in California even in Smith’s time.\n\nThe other science fiction pieces in the collection are rather threadbare. A Murder In the Fourth Dimension asks us to believe that a lawyer with no particular technical background could plausibly invent a means of projecting objects and people into the fourth dimension all by himself. If you can get past that absurdity, though, the actual depiction of the fourth dimension is rather haunting, and could perhaps have influenced the space-warped, monochromatic otherworld of Fulci’s The Beyond.\n\nMarooned In Andromeda, on the other hand, has little to recommend it – it comes across as a low-effort piece knocked off in a hurry for some quick money, following the lead of the bulk of third-rate pulp SF of the era rather than blazing its own own trail. Three mutineers on a starship are dumped on a planet, have a variety of unlikely encounters with local flora and fauna, and then the survivors are finally picked up again by the same captain they mutinied against, who’s had a change of heart. That’s literally it. The imagery and local colour may be fun, but the dialogue is dull and characterisation nonexistent.\n\nThe Immeasurable Horror is another fire-and-forget SF story; protagonist visits Venus, encounters unusual life form, it’s scary and likely responsible for offworld colonies being wiped off the map between supply visits, big whoop. It’s perhaps most interesting for the way that some of the ideas about the local flora and fauna seem to have their reflection in A Voyage to Sfanomoë, which was written shortly after this one. Comparing this bland space opera of Immeasurable Horror to the flavourful science fantasy of Voyage, and in particular comparing how Smith applies this very bland, workmanlike prose to the former whilst investing more of his aesthetic skills in crafting the prose of the latter, it’s clear to see which story was written primarily to pay the bills and which had a deeper point to it.\n\nStill, it’s only to be expected that this collection would be a bit of a hit-and-miss proposition, since it takes in a time period when Smith was still honing his craft. We haven’t yet seen a single one of his Zothique stories – to my mind his artistic peak; for that matter, there’s better Hyperborea and Averoigne stories to come than the ones we’ve seen so far here. Still, even on the evidence of these stories you have to admit that nobody in the pulp field offered quite the same combination of a powerful visual imagination with the eloquence needed to vividly communicate it to the reader, and whilst in his lesser stories Smith’s all too happy to use cardboard cutout stock characters, in his better works he shows a better understanding of human motivation and emotion than many of his pulp peers."
