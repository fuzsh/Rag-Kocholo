        "text": "I was fortunate to be selected for a panel at Chicon 8 on epistolary novels in speculative fiction. We (author and moderator Meg Elison, author Caroline Stevermer, publisher and editor Sarah T. Guan of Erewhon Books, Professor Leigha McReynolds, and myself) had a wonderful and spirited discussion of many facets of epistolary writing and some…\n\nThe Short: I recently read the Nalo Hopkinson collection Falling in Love with Hominids, 2015 Tachyon Publications. I loved her Foreword and the story introductions, and most of the stories. While I was a bit disappointed there was no story titled “Falling in Love With Hominids” included, I loved Hopkinson’s relating how this was her…\n\nThe Short: I was recently thinking about co-written, co-authored or collaborative short SFF with more than one author. Here is a direct link to my favorite 10 short speculative fiction works. My favorite is the classic “Mimsy Were the Borogoves“, a novelette by Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore, Astounding February 1943, rated 5/5, or…\n\nThe Short: I loved Volume 2 (1953-1957) first. This lead me to read “Rediscovery: Science Fiction by Women (1958-1963)” (Volume 1), Gideon Marcus managing editor, 2019 Journey Press, which I loved just as much for the great stories by authors I knew and did not know and wonderful essays on the authors and their works.…\n\nThe Short: I am a fan of Margaret St. Clair. I decided I needed to read more of her material, and I found The Hole in the Moon and Other Tales, her 2019 Dover Publications collection edited by Ramsey Campbell at my regional library collaborative. My overall average rating for the 17 stories included is…\n\nThe Short: I recently read The Year’s Best Science Fiction, First Annual Collection, Gardner Dozois editor, 1984 Bluejay Books. My overall average rating for the 1983 stories included was 3.73/5, or “Very good”. I recommend it as a very good sample of some of the best stories from 1983, although I do have some criticisms.…\n\nBack in 1981, I was hired by the Santa Clara Valley Water District (today known as “Valley Water”) as a junior civil engineer to design pipelines. Soon after being hired, I found out that they were formed in 1929 by vote of as the Santa Clara Valley Water Conservation District and subsequent state legislation to…\n\nI was recently discussing whether Robert A. Heinlein’s Hugo winning 1961 novel “Stranger in a Strange Land” (G. P. Putnam’s Sons) had held up or not 60+ years later with some other science fiction fans. Needless to say, there was a range of opinions, and that’s okay. From that, we segued into a discussion of…\n\nThe Short: For the Best Editor Short Form nominations for the 2024 Hugo Awards, I read “Communications Breakdown: SF Stories About the Future of Connection“, Jonathan Strahan editor, 2023 The MIT Press. I thought it was very good, with an overall rating of 3.75/5, or “Very good”, for the ten science fiction stories included. Recommended.…\n\nThe Short: I recently read the Ursula Vernon (under her pen name “T. Kingfisher”) collection Jackalope Wives and Other Stories, 2017 Red Wombat Tea Company/Argyll Productions. IMHO, it’s mostly fantasy, with one story that could be SF and two poems that are not genre. I loved it. My overall rating was 3.82/5, or “Great”. Strongly…\n\nI’ve been an SF and speculative fiction fan for many decades, but I came to voting on the Hugo Awards, attending conventions and being a more active fan fairly late in life. Perhaps in 2014, I realized that I was doing the reading anyway and that being a Hugo voter was a great way to…"
