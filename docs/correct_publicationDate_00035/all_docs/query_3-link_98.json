        "text": "Reading The Great Writers, part four\n\nLurching towards, but not quite achieving, a conclusion\n\nBut there are still 26 titles unaccounted for…\n\nAs I mentioned right at the start, this year – by chance – I read two of them, so Darwin’s The Voyage of the Beagle (1839) and Mansfield’s Bliss, and Other Stories (1920) are quickly disposed of. See – I’m moving right along. (I’d intended to read all of Mansfield’s short fiction this year, but Clarice Lispector shoved her aside and got right up in my face demanding attention. Maybe next year.) Two others, Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Kipling’s Kim (1900–1) I read as background for writing about the ongoing perpetuation of colonial adventure fiction narratives in Science Fiction: The Routledge Film Handbook (2012).\n\nWhich leaves 22 titles, five of which I’m surprised by.\n\nAnthology of Fear collects twenty ghost stories originally published between 1824–1914. I have no memory of this book being in the series; if it had been, I would have read it. I can only return to the anomaly of a partwork magazine having 54 rather than 52 issues. Did I miss bonus issues? Did they have to adjust the length of the year to make up for an excess of Daylight Saving or something?\n\nJoseph Conrad, Lord Jim (1900)\n\nThis is utterly mystifying to me. I read Heart of Darkness (1899) and The Secret Agent (1907) for the first time in my mid-teens, and was completely swept away by the latter. It is one of the few occasions I recall being utterly gripped by suspense (was it Stevie who got blown up?). Although Conrad’s posthumously published unfinished final novel was called Suspense (1925), I’m pretty certain he had little actual interest in suspense and that I was applying the wrong reading protocols, but everyone should have that intense an experience the first time they read Conrad. At university, I also read Nostromo (1904) and Under Western Eyes (1911), and since then Almayer’s Folly (1895) and The Inheritors (1901), co-written with Ford Madox Ford. Which is an embarrassingly short list for someone who’s spent 40 years thinking of himself as a Conrad admirer. So maybe it’s not so utterly mystifying after all. Maybe it’s time to bring the others into the rotation – one a year and I’ll be done by the time I’m 70.\n\n(The only other time I can recall being caught up by that kind of suspense was reading Verne’s The Mysterious Island. Could the mysterious helper-figure be Captain Nemo? Surely not, but what if it is?)\n\nGeorge Eliot, The Mill on the Floss (1860)\n\nThis is nearly as mysterious. I did not read Eliot until university, when I was blown away by Middlemarch (1871) and only a little less by Daniel Deronda (1876). But then I read nothing else by her for decades. In the last few years, she has been in the rotation: Silas Marner (1861), Felix Holt, the Radical (1866), The Lifted Veil (1859) and a re-read of Middlemarch. So I am kind of halfway there.\n\nElizabeth Gaskell, Cranford (1851–3)\n\nI’m not a fan but I do I find her I-know-best philanthropic condescension of the working class and her terror of organised labour almost as hilarious as it is painful as it is fascinating. I first read Mary Barton (1848) as very distant background for a piece I wrote about Gwyneth Jones in 2005. Gwyneth once described sf as ‘the green lung of the city of science’ so I started thinking about the industrial/rural hinterlands of Manchester, where she was born and grew up and where Gaskell lived, and went looking for representations of that landscape. I’m pretty certain I also read North and South (1854–5) for the same reason so I have no idea why I didn’t also read Cranford.\n\nMore recently, I read Sylvia’s Lovers (1863) because it is about whaling. Only it isn’t. Not really.\n\nJohn Galsworthy, The Forsyte Saga (1906–21)\n\nA decade or more ago, I bought my housemate the DVD boxset of the 1967 BBC adaptation. It was unexpectedly compelling. And perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the 26-episode series is the way it manages to utterly transform your feelings towards Soames Forsyte, from despising him for his marital rape of Irene to the moment when you realise (many episodes later) that he has become far-and-away the most sympathetic character amongst all these dreadful people. I immediately wanted to see whether (and how) Galsworthy pulls it off. Every second-hand omnibus volume of the much longer The Forsyte Chronicles has since sat in a box unread.\n\nWhich leaves 17 titles. Some are easy to explain.\n\nCharles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities (1859)\n\nI have read just under half of Dickens’s novels, some of them more than once: The Pickwick Papers (1836–7), A Christmas Carol (1843), Dombey and Son (1846–8), David Copperfield (1849–50), Bleak House (1852–3), Hard Times (1854), Great Expectations (1860–1), Our Mutual Friend (1864–5), The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870; with the Leon Garfield conclusion). Mostly, it has been for purposes of study. My least favourite module at university was the compulsory (!) ‘Dickens and Wordsworth’ – it was the only one for which I did not receive a first class grade and I hated it so much I’ve always been quite pleased with that.\n\nDrood I read on my own recognisance, back in my teens, because I’d heard there was spontaneous human combustion in it! Simpler times. (And as a kid, I’d loved Leon Garfield’s Smith (1967) and Black Jack (1968)).\n\nBleak House I read about a decade ago. My partner, who likes Dickens but no one’s perfect, had to go back to the States for a couple of months, so she bought me a copy to read, a chapter a day, while she was away. In return, I gave her Robert Tressell’s The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists (1914) – remember, I’m given to big romantic gestures.\n\nShe’s never quite forgiven me for sending her off on her own with such a devastating book; and I’ve never forgiven her for giving me a book in which the most interesting character, the London fog, turns out to be just a fucking metaphor.\n\nShe so got the better part of that deal.\n\nOf them all, Hard Times is the one I came closest to liking. Not just because it’s short, although that helps, but because the weekly publishing schedule completed screwed with Dickens’ rhythms and forced him into producing something interestingly different.\n\nSo the reason I’ve never read A Tale of Two Cities is that I really don’t like Dickens. He’s such a chore, even when he is not literally so.\n\nThe reason I have not read the following three books is their authors’ close association – in my head, if not necessarily in reality – with Dickens:\n\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray, Vanity Fair (1847–8)\n\nAnthony Trollope, Barchester Towers (1857)\n\nWilkie Collins, The Woman in White (1860) – although I did recently crack and read The Moonstone (1868) and The Frozen Deep (1874) and am prepared to forgive Collins his real or imagined association with Dickens,\n\nHenry James, The Portrait of a Lady (1880–1)\n\nWhile I’m not convinced of its genius, I have read The Turn of the Screw (1898) maybe half a dozen times, most recently this summer as background for that chapter on horror and class with which these musings began. I quite liked Washington Square (1880) and The Bostonians (1886) – which were on my American Lit module and all right as far that kind of realist novel goes. So I was quite looking forward to reading more by him on The Novel module. So naïve! What Maisie Knew (1897) was a baffling mess: not that I couldn’t see what he was trying to do, but that he should botch it so very badly. Maybe, I thought, The Ambassadors (1903) would be better. Quit laughing at the back.\n\nThe Ambassadors seminar was one of those excruciating ordeals. Clearly no one else had read it. Years later, I discovered from his own confession that that included the tutor.\n\nThere is not a barge pole long enough with which not to touch Henry James again.\n\nDH Lawrence, The Virgin and the Gypsy, and Other Stories (1930)\n\nThat bleeding module on The Novel. They also made us read Sons and Lovers (1913), The Rainbow (1915) and Lady Chatterley’s Lover (1928). I hated the whole night-blooming tumescent bunch of them.\n\nI’d already read The Fox (1923) and The Virgin and the Gypsy (1930) at secondary school, but not ‘the Other Stories’, so by the end of the sixth/final post you will appreciate how fucking virtuous I am being by not lying about it here.\n\nEM Forster, A Passage to India (1924)\n\nI’ve only read two things by Forster, but I have read both of them several times: ‘The Machine Stops’ (1909), which seems a little less remarkable with each go, and the first two-thirds of the first chapter of A Passage to India, which is so fucking irritating I can’t ever get any further than that. Does this make me a bad person? Perhaps. Does it make me want to try something else by him instead? Hell, no.\n\nJohn Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath (1939)\n\nI guess I’m still suffering Red Pony trauma after all these years, although I did read Of Mice and Men (1937) for my brother’s CSE coursework. I’ve had a copy of In Dubious Battle (1936) lying around unread since I was writing The Cinema of John Sayles (2009), intended as background for the Matewan chapter. And I’ve been to Tortilla Flat, the oldest operating stagecoach town in Arizona, but have not read Tortilla Flat (1935), and not just because it isn’t actually set there (which doesn’t stop them selling copies).\n\nGraham Greene, The Comedians (1966)\n\nI very occasionally pick up something by Greene – Brighton Rock (1938), The Heart of the Matter (1948), The Third Man (1949), The End of the Affair (1951), Our Man in Havana (1958) – and like all right-minded folk prefer his ‘entertainments’ to his ‘novels’. I guess I’ll get to this one eventually, or maybe not, who knows, but I do have a copy of The Ministry of Fear (1943) kicking around somewhere, so I should read that first.\n\nErnest Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940)\n\nI loved about two-thirds of The First Forty-Nine Stories (1938), The Old Man and the Sea (1952) and the admittedly not-great To Have and To Have Not (1937). I loved the first half of A Farewell to Arms (1929), and the first quarter of The Sun Also Rises (1926). I do not love the law of diminishing returns.\n\nWalter Scott, Ivanhoe (1820)\n\nLate in my teens, I got myself a dirt cheap, second hand, almost complete, 20-or-so-volume hardback edition of the complete Waverley novels. Faded blue, well musty and water stained, it looked grand all lined up on a shelf. Proper handsome. Never read a one of them. Years later, for something or other I was writing (thinking about historical narrative for the John Sayles book?), I read, I think, Waverley (1814), Rob Roy (1817) and one other – I cannot remember which for they all made very little impression on me.\n\nI sometimes ponder reading The Bride of Lammermoor (1819) since I have a fond attachment to Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor, the first opera I ever saw, and when my partner was living in Manchester I was sometimes tempted by Peveril of the Peak (1823) since it shared its name with our favourite city centre pub, but on the other hand it is Scott’s longest novel…\n\nSamuel Butler, The Way of All Flesh (1903)\n\nI’ve read Erewhon (1872) and Erewhon Revisited (1901) and bear their author no ill-will so I really cannot explain not having read this as well.\n\nRobert Graves, I, Claudius (1934)\n\nI’ve read Seven Days in New Crete/Watch the North Wind Rise (1949) and bear its author ill-will so that’s that cleared that up.\n\nLouisa May Alcott, Little Women (1868)\n\nI’m not American, so it just really doesn’t loom that large. (Also male, so ditto.)\n\nW Somerset Maugham, Of Human Bondage (1915)\n\nI’m British, but it just really doesn’t loom that large.\n\nHE Bates, Love for Lydia (1952)\n\nI’m as surprised as you to see Bates considered a ‘great writer’. But since I’ve not read anything by him, who am I to say.\n\nEvelyn Waugh, Vile Bodies (1930)\n\nTowards the end of 1981, the whole world it seemed was a-flutter over Granada’s 11-part TV adaptation of Brideshead Revisited (1945). Desperate for cultural capital, I tuned in faithfully each week on the black-and-white 12-inch portable upstairs (no one else in the house was remotely interested so no chance of seeing it on the 24-inch black-and-white in the living room). But try as I might, I simply could not figure out what all the fuss was about. Sometime the following year, I got hold of the library’s tie-in (but fancy B-format) paperback and made my way through the dreadful thing. Utterly lamentable stuff.\n\nBut someone somewhere recommended the Sword of Honour Trilogy (1952–61) – probably Anthony Burgess, who lists it and Brideshead in his Ninety-nine novels – as the culmination of the mature Waugh. That might be true since it is certainly long and tiresome.\n\nThere was a copy of Scoop (1938) lying around in the book cupboard at the back of our sixth-form English classroom which, bored one day, I picked up (the book, not the cupboard). It rises at times to the mildly amusing. In 1990, BBC2’s Moviedrome season, hosted by Alex Cox, screened Tony Richardson’s 1965 adaptation of The Loved One (1948), which was all right (though I’d much rather Luis Buñuel or especially Elaine May had succeeded in making their versions), which led me to give Waugh one last go.\n\nBottom line: no fucking way is Evelyn Waugh a great writer.\n\nHere endeth the sound and the fury; tune in tomorrow (or sometime soon anyway) to see if it signifies anything.\n\nReading The Great Writers, part six\n\nReading The Great Writers, part three\n\nAnother shorter middle bit\n\nWhile my experience of reading The Great Writers’ novels had always been a little marred by their layout and print, something far worse awaited at university.\n\nCondescension.\n\nJane Austen, Pride and Prejudice (1813)\n\nThis was the very first novel we were required to read on my degree (and one of the very small number by women). I had not read anything quite like it before. Despite my forays into ‘literature’ and ‘literary fiction’, I still mostly read genre fiction. I got through a lot of those 180ish-page sf paperbacks, often at a rate of one or more per day, so I was not at all used to having to keep track of large numbers of characters and their relationships with each other. I remember breaking off after several chapters to jot down their names and draw a diagram mapping how they connected to each other.\n\nI remember a fellow student getting a glimpse of it and laughing.\n\nBut mostly I remember being the only student in the seminar without a brand-new Penguin Classic, and the looks on (some of) their faces when they saw my manifestly cheap ‘fancy’ hardback. It was that Oxford interview all over again.\n\nWhen I was growing up, Plymouth was one of just a handful of places that still retained the 11+ exam, the already archaic post-war system for streaming pre-adolescent children into secondary education at technical schools, secondary moderns or grammar schools. It pretended to neutrality but was really a system for maintaining economic and social class hierarchies while allowing limited social mobility for the ‘worthy’ few. We moved to Plymouth right at the end of 1979 and I started my half year at Hyde Park Juniors on the January day the rest of the class were taking the second part of the 11+. So a couple of months later, after which most school places in the city had already been assigned, I had to take an alternative exam. The outcome was I had done well enough to go to a grammar school but there were no places available, so I could either\n\ncommute to the anomalous Southway Comprehensive (which also was not quite a comprehensive, either, since it streamed some subjects) on the northern edge of the city; or\n\napply for a scholarship to Plymouth College, the public (i.e., private) school less than a ten-minute walk from home, not quite opposite my junior school.\n\nNo way was I going endure being patronised and mocked as a scholarship boy!\n\nBy not going there or to Oxford, I really thought I’d dodged the bullet of class condescension.\n\nAfter that Austen seminar, I went back to my room in Mansfield Hall and looked at the reading list we’d been sent in advance and at the shelf of books I’d brought with me. Every one of them was second-hand, and most of them editions which were less than infra dig (a phrase I’d never encountered before, let alone heard being bandied about, and had to look up in a dictionary). And some of them were so embarrassingly bulky and mouldering that I went scouring Reading’s second-hand bookstores for replacements, which of course meant it would probably have been cheaper to buy new editions in the first place.\n\nAnyway, Austen. Took me a while to get it. But then quickly became quite fascinated and read all the novels – except, for some reason, Northanger Abbey (1817), which I only got to maybe five years ago. Predictably, I guess, sarky Emma (1815) was my favourite, but I’ve only ever re-read Mansfield Park (1814) and Persuasion (1817), both for things I was writing. Maybe when I’m through (re)reading the Brontes (and George Eliot), I’ll move Austen into the rotation.\n\nHerman Melville, Moby-Dick (1851)\n\nWhat can I say? It is an absolute monster of a book. I fell in love immediately. So much so that my first tattoo was very nearly the Penguin edition barcode on the back of my neck. (Again, I wish I was making this up but am also quite delighted by my own ridiculousness. And both relieved and saddened that I never managed to scrape together the cash.)\n\nFor my first essay on my American Literature module – which anthology-wise was thoroughly Norton not Heath, so Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, early Henry James and our token woman, Emily Dickinson – I decided to develop an angle on Moby-Dick by holding it up alongside Ernest Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea (1952), which I also read for the first time. Quite why I thought Moby-Dick could not sustain a 1500-word critical treatment on its own, I have no idea. Maybe Melville’s encyclopedism was contagious.\n\nI read Moby-Dick half a dozen times over the next decade, a couple of them for teaching. After my MA at Warwick, I returned to Reading for my PhD and a couple of years in a row I taught the same American literature module – literally the same, completely unchanged – I’d studied five or six years earlier. Each time, at some point in the first seminar, I advised the class that it was a really big book but they would only need to read so many pages per day to have it under their belts by the time we got to the two weeks we would spend on it. And each week, I updated the increasing page-count if they were to start from that day. Of the 25 students I taught over those two years, not one of them took my advice. But more than half skipped class during the Moby-Dick fortnight… Their loss.\n\nA few years ago, we went to Inverness for our Xmas/New Year’s break, and I decided to read Moby-Dick for the first time in at least 20 years. Once again, I was utterly smitten. Fortunately, it was fucking freezing outside, and the days were much shorter that far north, so my partner didn’t really mind that I basically sat and read it in 4-or-more-hour chunks.\n\nAt the start of lockdown, I decided to read all of Melville. Breezed through Typee (1846) and Omoo (1847), both of which I’d previously read and this time liked even more. And I finally got through Mardi (1849), which had defeated me several times before, and which this time broke me of Melville for a while. However, I’m determined to bring him into the rotation – Redburn (1849) is cued up for 2024, which means I should get to my Moby-Dick reward-read around 2030 or 2031 (depending on what I do about the short stories and poetry). I seriously cannot wait. Such are the schemes of mice and men.\n\nMark Twain, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885)\n\nI must have read a version adapted for younger readers at some point, because parts of it were already familiar. I have not reread it since I taught it in 1996 at Exeter University on an American Literature survey course which was very Heath, not Norton, in its orientation. I feel no particular desire to read it again.\n\nExcept.\n\nHow the hell you abridge Huckleberry Finn. Surely, I can’t be daft enough to track down a children’s version and read it alongside the complete text.\n\nReader, that’s precisely how daft I can be.\n\nF Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby (1925)\n\nWe read this on the Literature, Film and Television module alongside the 1974 Coppola-scripted, Jack Clayton adaptation, starring Robert Redford. The one good thing about Fitzgerald’s novel is that it is quicker to read than it is to sit through the 1974 Coppola-scripted, Jack Clayton adaptation, starring Robert Redford.\n\nAnd it turns out, a quarter century later, quicker to read than to sit through Baz Luhrmann’s 2013 adaptation, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. So that’s two good things.\n\nBut it is even quicker to watch Elliot Nugent’s 1949 version, starring Alan Ladd, which regardless of the liberties it takes with the novel, but also mostly because of them, makes it way better than Fitzgerald’s effort.\n\nWhich is to say, I not only don’t like the novel – the ash heaps and big googly eyes are fine – but am mystified by its critical standing. It’s right down there with JD Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye (1945–6) and that whiny little fuck Holden Caulfield, the literati’s Danny Rand.\n\nHowever, being a dutiful student, I also read Tender is the Night (1934) and re-watched the 1985 BBC mini-series adaptation – I saw the initial broadcast of it because of: a) flailing around re. cultural capital, but also really b) Peter Strauss (i.e., Wolff aka Spacehunter, of Adventures in the Forbidden Zone fame) was in it.\n\nI’d found a cheap paperback Gatsby to switch in for my Great Writers version but did not keep it once we were done with Finals. Of course, a few years later I found myself teaching on an updated version of that module, and equally inevitably, the one bit that had been kept unchanged was the block on Fitzgerald. His estate has made a (very small) fortune from me, and I resent that.\n\nHenry Fielding, Tom Jones (1749)\n\nOur 18th Century Literature module was an intoxicating brew of bawdiness, wit, humanism, misanthropy, scepticism, formal experimentation, moralising, mockery of moralising, refusal to moralise, baby-farming and horse-people. Fortunately John Dryden died in 1700, so there was Alexander Pope instead, with The Rape of the Lock (1712) and The Dunciad (1728). There was Jonathan Swift’s A Tale of a Tub (1704), The Battle of the Books (1704), ‘A Modest Proposal’ (1729) and Gulliver – so I finally learned how to pronounce Houyhnhnms. And for novels, there was Tom Jones, which I liked most of all, with Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy (1759–67) a close second and Daniel Defoe’s Moll Flanders (1722) some way back in third place. Samuel Richardson’s Pamela (1740), trailing the field by quite a distance, was in danger of being lapped. Which makes it all the odder that rather than reading Fielding’s brief spoof, Shamela (1741), or any of his other novels, I voluntarily ploughed through Richardson’s breezeblock response to Fielding, Sir Charles Grandison (1753), and his other doorstop, Clarissa (1748). Of them, I remember nothing beside their immensity.\n\nThomas Hardy, Tess of the D’Urbervilles (1891)\n\nOur module on The Novel gave us Austen, George Eliot, later Henry James, Conrad, Lawrence and Hardy. See, I told you it was a devotedly Leavisite department! (Eliot, James, Conrad and Lawrence will return in part five.) I found Tess a bit meh, not Far From the Madding Crowd meh, but meh nonetheless. Jude the Obscure (1894–5) seemed stronger, undoubtedly because Jude’s struggle for and with social mobility struck a chord. Also, pig pizzles being lobbed over hedges always puts me in a cheery mood. But it was The Woodlanders (1887) that won me to Hardy’s corner. That and him not being James or Lawrence. (I eventually got to write about The Woodlanders in The Anthropocene Unconscious: Climate Catastrophe Culture – alongside Groot, Swamp Thing and Man-Thing, because I’m nothing if not classy.)\n\nVirginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse (1927)\n\nThis wasn’t actually on my degree. It’s best shot was the Modernism module but, although that somehow (and somewhy) devoted two weeks to Ezra Pound’s Hugh Selwyn Mauberly (1920), there was only room for one woman, which was Woolf, represented by one novel, which was Mrs Dalloway (1925), but I liked it so much I read Lighthouse and The Waves (1931), too.\n\nAnd that was it. My degree was over. More house moves – Plymouth, Coventry, Reading, Reading, Reading, Exeter, Exeter, High Wycombe, High Wycombe, High Wycombe, High Wycombe, High Wycombe, Bristol – and my parents wanting to reclaim some space in their own house (the nerve!) and somewhere in all of that The Great Writers (and many other books) found their way to charity shops.\n\nBut there are still 26 titles unaccounted for…\n\nWhich I realise is not much of a cliffhanger, but it’s the best I can muster right now.\n\nReading The Great Writers, part five\n\nReading The Great Writers, part one\n\nA shorter middle bit\n\nOf the 54 titles in The Great Writers series, I had, it turned out, already read 15.\n\nJohn Bunyan, The Pilgrim’s Progress (1678)\n\nOne advantage of aspirational Protestant parents convinced of the value of reading is that abridged and unabridged Pilgrim’s Progresses are put in front of you before you are ten years old.\n\nLewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland (1865)\n\nIn the first year of junior school, our teacher (Mrs Eaton) would end every day by reading a few pages of Alice in Wonderland to us (I remember someone spotting the caterpillar in the famous illustration was, it transpires famously, the wrong colour). But that was way too slow a pace for impatient little me, so I got a copy of it (and Through the Looking Glass (1871)) out of the village library.\n\nJonathan Swift, Gulliver’s Travels (1726)\n\nI got an abridged paperback version in a red leatherette-effect cover from Trago Mills in the mid-70s (also The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876)) but have no idea (in either case) when in the intervening years I first read it unabridged. But I do remember already having experienced that feeling of relief when you finally get through the Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib and Japan and wash ashore in the Land of the Houyhnhnms (even if I hadn’t the faintest idea of how to pronounce it).\n\nMary Shelley, Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus (1818)\n\nAgain, I remember an abridged version (and of Dracula (1897) in the same imprint) in the mid- 70s. Sadly, though, I remember nothing about their undoubtedly cheap and nasty bindings – or, in either case, of when in the intervening years I first read the book proper.\n\nArthur Conan Doyle, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892)\n\nI fell in love with Sherlock Holmes courtesy of Basil Rathbone and, especially, Nigel Bruce, whose mere presence in a film still cheers me up. I remember seeing The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939) and the way too-scary The Scarlet Claw (1944) and being terrified by the Creeper in The Pearl of Death (1944), presumably all part of a late-70s early evening weekday season on BBC2. Somehow there was a copy of Hound in the junior school library, and then around the turn of the decade I got one of those cheap hardback omnibus editions of all the Holmes stories and novels as an Xmas gift, which I devoured.\n\nIn fact, I loved Holmes so much back then that one day in 1985 I feigned illness so I could stay home from school to finish reading Cay Van Ash’s Ten Years Beyond Baker Street (1984), which I’d started the night before (it was probably my first brush with Fu Manchu outside of those Christopher Lee films), and the following year I stayed up late watching Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper/Freemasons in Murder By Decree­ (Clark 1979) rather than revising for the next morning’s Biology O-level exam.\n\nHG Wells, The War of the Worlds (1898)\n\nIn the first term of my final year at junior school, I read an extract (the protagonist diving underwater to escape the Martian heat rat) for a comprehension exercise – and raced to the school library. But it only had a copy of The Invisible Man (1897); my memory is of a paperback tie-in with the 1975 TV series – just a picture of David McCallum on the cover – but as there was a novelisation of the pilot episode by Michael Jahn I now wonder if I read both and have jumbled them up.\n\nThe village library didn’t have a copy of War of the Worlds, either, but Xmas was not far off. Nor was my Jeff Wayne album tie-in copy (which finally fell apart about a decade ago.)\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson, Treasure Island (1883)\n\nI seem to have gone through a nautical phase in the late 70s. Possibly because of Gulliver’s Travels, the Frankenstein frame story, Ursula K Le Guin’s Wizard of Earthsea (which I did not like and tbh still don’t) or Jules Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas (1870) and The Mysterious Island (1875) – both of which I’d read in bowdlerised abridged versions – or RM Ballantyne’s The Coral Island (1857), the first chapter of which I doggedly read half a dozen times as a child, without ever getting any further. But it was more likely because of Willard Price’s Southsea Adventure (1952), Underwater Adventure (1954), Whale Adventure (1960) and Diving Adventure (1969), from a series which briefly, but only temporarily, took that special place in my heart reserved for The Three Investigators (1964–87) series, which had already dislodged Enid Blyton’s Famous Five (1942–63) and Adventure (1944–55) series (I never could stand The Secret Seven (1949–63)).\n\nBut, my god, the black spot! That really put the willies up me.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, The Fall of the House of Usher, and Other Stories (1830s–1840s)\n\nI asked for a big paperback omnibus of Poe for my fourteenth birthday (it contained everything except Eureka), and then worked through it a story, poem or chapter of Pym per day (for years, the only bit of Pym I could actually remember was the great big disappearing dog). But it is only since I had a panic attack during an MRI scan in 2020 that I have developed claustrophobia. And although I have never had a nightmare about being buried alive, I did later that year wake up screaming from a dream in which I was trapped in a small space below deck, in full costume, with Ridley Scott filming me as the lead in his grittily realistic live-action Captain Pugwash reboot. I wish I was making this up, but I am also pretty impressed at myself that I don’t have to.\n\nCharles Dickens, A Christmas Carol (1843)\n\nWe’d read an abridged version of A Christmas Carol in at secondary school, and I was so offended at being deemed incapable of reading the full text that I got it out of the school library. I think it must have been in the second year, because I had a very combative relationship with our English teacher that year. We got off to a bad start when she selected John Steinbeck’s The Red Pony (1933) for us to read as a class. Everyone hated it (which in retrospect I realise was probably just me and a couple of other little gobshites who joined in). We protested so much, she dropped it and picked something else for us to read. I forget what, but we were heady with victory and could smell blood.\n\nSometime around then I got into a stupid row with her, which she ended (or so she thought) by saying ‘If you’re so smart, why don’t you read Ulysses?’.\n\nSo I got a copy out of the Central Library and did just that. One chapter per day for two-and-a-half weeks, understanding almost none of it. Once I was done, I took it into class, dropped it casually on my desk and asked if she had any other recommendations.\n\nI was fourteen. Forty years later, I am still appalled at what an awful little shit I was.\n\nIt is also very difficult to reconcile these memories with the crippling shyness from which I suffered, the frequent terror of speaking, the incomprehension of other people, who were all so fucking weird – either terrifyingly random or so predictable they were even scarier. But I was also a cheeky little bugger, with a tendency to brinksmanship and a self-destructive edge.\n\nThe former would probably now be considered social anxiety and fortunately have some apparatus of understanding and support. But alongside the latter, I am more inclined to think of it as class anxiety. The terror of social mobility, of transclass social non-reproduction. Plus puberty.\n\nAldous Huxley, Brave New World (1932)\n\nI know I had already read Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-four (1949) and William Golding’s Lord of the Flies (1954) and JB Priestley’s An Inspector Calls (1945) because my brother, a couple of years older than me, was doing his CSEs in 1983 and he bribed and/or bullied me into writing his English Literature coursework essays for him. I remember him being annoyed at having to copy them out long-hand so no one could prove he had cheated. But later he was so delighted to have outwitted his Secondary Modern, which had been so quick to (mis)judge his abilities. Not that this triumph necessarily proved them wrong.\n\nSomewhere in that confluence of events, I read Huxley – probably just to make a smart aside in one of those essays, a foible I still have.\n\nHuxley’s Ape and Essence (1948) and Island (1962) would have followed in pretty short order, and I remember the this-is-not-a-sequel disappointment of Brave New World Revisited (1958). Thanks to an Orwell essay, I’d have read Zamyatin’s We (1924) around the same time, which quickly led me to his The Dragon and Other Stories (coll.1966) and Islanders and The Fisher of Men (coll.1984), which in turn got me to Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita (1967) not long after.\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales (1387–1400)\n\nMy posh mate Rob was reading one of the Tales, I forget which, for his A-level English, so I picked up a cheap complete Tales and slowly worked my way through it over a couple of years. This long slow read led to a classic autodidact’s lack-of-cultural-capital moment when I was interviewed at Oxford University (the first and possibly still the only pupil from my Comprehensive ever to even apply to Oxford or Cambridge). Asked what I was reading that was not on my A-level syllabus, I mentioned I had recently completed the Tales. Surprised, the interviewer asked whether I was reading it in translation or in ‘Middle English’. I had never even heard of ‘Middle English’ and had no idea how to reply, so he filled the awkward silence by lecturing me, a state school upstart, on how I could not claim to have read Chaucer if I was only reading a translation. His disdain was palpable; I withered beneath it. The interview ground to a halt. I was not offered a place at that College.\n\nHowever, I had read Chaucer in Middle English! And Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. And Pearl. And Sir Orfeo.\n\nI’m pretty sure this is a case of biting off my own nose to spite my face when I’d rather be punching his, but because of that wanker’s class contempt, I have never voluntarily read any other Middle English, not even Piers Plowman (just a couple of shorter poems I was obliged to read in our first-year survey course at university).\n\nThomas Hardy, Far from the Madding Crowd (1874)\n\nThis is one of those books I saw in Penguin but picked up in a cheaper US paperback (with yellow edges) at my local independent bookstore, In Other Words, on Mutley Plain in Plymouth. Which was also where I bought Russell’s History of Western Philosophy, The Essential James Joyce (containing Dubliners (1914), A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man (19116) and excerpts from Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939)) and the three omnibus editions of Chandler novels I still have. It was also where I bought my girlfriend Jane a copy of Robin Morgan’s Sisterhood is Global: The International Women’s Movement Anthology (1984), the sequel to Sisterhood is Powerful (1970). I have always been given to big romantic gestures.\n\nI spent a lot of time in that shop. It was a haven during some confusing times. They were always welcoming and kind. And once they noticed how careful I was with books, and how unable to afford them, they were fine with me popping in on my way home from school and reading books in half-hour chunks without buying them. At Xmas, they would give me mulled wine, even though I was clearly underage. It was also one of the places where I started to piece together a political education by reading – The Communist Manifesto, The Condition of the Working Class in England, Mutual Aid, Bakunin on Anarchism, Anarcho-Syndicalism, A Room of One’s Own, The Dialectic of Sex, The Female Eunuch, Intercourse, The Wretched of the Earth, Notebook of a Return to the Native Land, goodness knows what else – but also just as much by enjoying their generosity, conviviality, community.\n\nMind you, all I can really remember of Far From the Madding Crowd is finding Bathsheba Everdene really irritating – oh, and the bit about punching holes in sheep to let out trapped wind.\n\nEmily Bronte, Wuthering Heights (1847)\n\nWuthering Heights was one of our lower-Sixth A-level texts, and I remember being really angry at the implausibility of Nelly being able to witness certain events. I was so furious – don’t ask me to explain the logic, presumably something to do with narrative perspective – that I was driven by rage to read John Brunner’s Stand on Zanzibar (1968) and then (obvs) John Dos Passos’s USA trilogy (1930–6). I was clearly broken in some way, and not merely in terms of the unthinking misogyny clearly underpinning such a response.\n\nI’d been reading and protesting my way into socialism and anti-racism, and had been hanging out with a bunch of self-proclaimed anarchists from Plymouth Polytechnic. They knew a student I knew from my parent’s church, and had seen me in her company somewhere, so assumed I was way older than actually I was. (Reader, I did not disabuse them.) But any feminist education would still have been a year or so in the future, courtesy of Jane.\n\nI broke with those anarchists over their refusal to do anything in support of the great miners’ strike. There were really just middle-class wankers who liked to sound radical while smoking dope. Jane was a much better influence.\n\nOh, and I long since changed my mind about Wuthering Heights (it is probably now my favourite Bronte novel, so much more bonkers than anything her sisters ever ventured) and am less convinced of Brunner’s genius (though I still read him, most recently The Great Steamboat Race (1983)), but remain steadfast, forty years later, in my opinion that The 42nd Parallel is the best volume of Dos Passos’s trilogy (it provided, along with a quote from Lenin’s Philosophical Notebooks and another from Billy Zane, an epigraph to my The Cinema of John Sayles: A Lone Star (2009)).\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, Comedies and Tragedies (1590s–1610s)\n\nI have no idea which plays were in these volumes. But in 1986, The Oxford Shakespeare was published and I got a hardback copy as some kind of come-on from a postal book club (I think – I can’t imagine being able to afford it otherwise). But like Ulysses and The Canterbury Tales, I worked through it steadily, a play a week, then some poems until I was done.\n\nIn 1991, I took that volume into my finals exam on Shakespeare; it was an open-book exam, and we were supposed to leave our copies of individual plays behind to be checked for notes, but the invigilator took one look at this immense pristine tome I’d lugged up to campus and said not to bother as no one in their right mind deface it by writing notes in it.\n\nBut what, you are undoubtedly thinking, of the other 39 titles?\n\nReading The Great Writers, part three\n\nThe lrb; or long, redundant beginning\n\nThis spring and summer, I spent several months reading for and writing a chapter on ‘Class and Horror’ for the forthcoming Routledge Companion to Horror. It was the first time I’ve dived deep into critical/theoretical work on class for probably the best part of twenty years. One key shift is the now general acceptance of the need to incorporate Bourdieu (or Bourdieu-like) work into models of class, which meant I found myself thinking a lot more about social and cultural capital. The other key trend was hardly new: marginalising/excluding Marxist traditions of work on economic class, often in favour of Weberian or neo-Weberian approaches, which is odd given how very little Weber actually said about class, but also for other very obvious reasons not remotely odd.\n\nI also found myself baffled (i.e., not remotely baffled but fascinated) by social scientists who present social mobility as an absolutely incontrovertible good (even if the only argument they can muster is that it improves GDP) but are at the same time appalled by the notion of absolute social mobility. Even though it is the obvious end-point of their social mobility enthusiasm, they devote absolutely no words/time/energy to imagining what meaningful equality might look like. Instead, they just brandish terrifying (that is, hilariously clichéd) images of totalitarian states. Harrison Bergeron, eat your heart out! It’s almost as if their main interest is maintaining a slightly tweaked and marginally more palatable status quo (and securing future research income streams from similarly committed funding bodies).\n\nAnyway, the point is, I found myself engaged in autobiographical ponderings about social capital, cultural capital and autodidactism.\n\nI come from a dirt-poor West Midlands working-class family. I was born in Staffordshire but we moved to Devon when I was four years old, which further limited the already negligible social capital to be derived from my now attenuated extended kinship network.\n\nMy parents were Methodists (which is why I have absolutely no idea how to gamble although I did, after no struggle whatsoever, overcome teetotalism). And they were aspirational, at least to the extent of wanting a better life for me and my brother and of taking on a crippling mortgage to own a home rather than rent a house (they were so ripe, sadly, for Thatcher). Their new circle of church friends – middle class folks from the wealthier parts of the village – obviously lived in a different world to us and, despite many kindnesses, were defensive of their relative privilege. While my dad left school aged 15 and with no qualifications, they were mostly graduates from middle class families. Thus they had higher levels of economic, social and cultural capital, the latter of which was often deployed against my ‘uneducated’ dad. Especially when he did things like trying seriously to discuss with them that bit in Acts about the early church sharing all things in common. They were really not up for that! (In this mid-1970s context, my dad was quite radical in trying to square a Co-op/Labour upbringing with the evangelicalism into which he had fallen, which was only just then turning from a vaguely countercultural centrism to the pronounced right-wing attitudes that now define it – and which shifted my parents’ politics: they cried when Callaghan lost in 1979 but have voted Conservative ever since, albeit with growing disillusionment over the last decade of unignorable Tory corruption and incompetence.)\n\nSo I grew up with no economic capital to speak of, and very little social or cultural capital. But my parents’ aspirationalism bought into the post-war promise of social mobility (I am old enough to have benefitted from those limited openings, which have in real terms been whittled down to nothing since the 1980s) and thus they insisted on the importance of education and of reading. However, the latter, amply supported by school and especially public libraries, took place in something of a vacuum: limited cultural capital meant I had little idea of what to read.\n\nWhich I only really began to realise in my mid-teens, thanks to Rob. An extremely middle class friend met through church stuff, he was a couple of years older than me, went to a grammar school and was the most flamboyantly camp person I’d ever met: he ‘simply adored Dickens’ and, he declared, flaunting a Penguin paperback of Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov (1880), was ‘reading the Russians now’. How did he know about these things? They were simply part of the atmosphere in which he grew up, at home and in school. (He urged Ian McEwan’s The Comfort of Strangers (1981) on me, and something green-covered from Grove Press, but it only very slowly dawned on me that this was a kind of courtship: that he was using books – and cultural capital – to hit on me. Last I heard of him, he moved to South Africa at the turn of the 90s to become a croupier at – unforgivably – Sun City.)\n\nIn the absence of such social and institutional networks for inheriting the kinds of cultural capital Rob enjoyed, the only real alternative for me was autodidactism, with all its perils and pitfalls – and potentials for embarrassment: at some point in my mid-teens I asked Plymouth Central Library if they had a copy of ‘Aleksander Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago’ (1973) – I’d read, rather than heard, about it somewhere so only knew how to pronounce one of those five words. (It took a couple of decades before I could start to enjoy mispronouncing ‘archipelago’ as if it were a kind of sausage.)\n\nAutodidactism took many forms:\n\nDiscovering Anthony Burgess’s Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English since 1939 – A Personal Choice (1984) and trying with the aid of the library to work through its list of titles. A quick google of the contents page shows there there are still forty-odd of them I’ve not read. Andrea remains constantly appalled at me for never having read John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces (1980), as now does my mate Dan since she blabbed to him this summer. But I did finally read Herman Wouk’s The Caine Mutiny (1952) last year in Brazil in the old densely-packed A-format paperback that had travelled tens of thousands of miles in my luggage over the years as my emergency back-up should I be ever stranded in an airport or train station with nothing to read.\n\nWatching The Great Philosophers (1987) on TV and reading Brian Magee’s book version and then finally finishing that copy of Betrand Russell’s A History of Western Philosophy I’d got bogged down in a couple of years earlier.\n\nRandomly picking up second-hand Penguin classics (or the usually cheaper imported American paperbacks of the same titles).\n\nSeeing a Vincent Price movie and setting out to read all of Poe.\n\nHearing Apocalypse Now was based on Heart of Darkness so starting to read Conrad.\n\nWatching The Modern World: Ten Great Writers (1988), reading Malcolm Bradbury’s book version and turning them into reading lists….\n\nLists. All the time lists. And following up those leads in libraries and second-hand bookstores. (New books were things you received as gifts.)\n\nJust in case any of this makes me sound adorably (or agonisingly or absurdly) precocious (or dunderheaded), let me be clear: I had not exactly left childish things behind.\n\nI still regularly re-read my full set of The Incredible Hulk Weekly and my stack of movie novelisations (though some passages in Arthur Byron Cover’s Flash Gordon (1980) were definitely not intended for the younger reader).\n\nAnd although I stopped buying second-hand Doctor Who novelisations with number 68, Terrance Dicks’s An Unearthly Child (1981), I carried on rereading my until-then complete set. And reading the new ones until, I think, number 113, Terence Dudley’s Black Orchid (1986), even though that entailed humiliating returns to the kids’ section of the library I’d eagerly abandoned half a dozen years earlier (and even though I’d freakishly stumbled upon, read and had the veil of illusion torn away by John Tulloch and Manuel Alvarado’s Doctor Who: The Unfolding Text (1983), the first proper academic book I’d encountered).\n\nI was also, like every adolescent male I knew, although perhaps more assiduously, reading James Herbert and Richard Allen and Sven Hassel, and exercising an even less discerning penchant for Patrick Lee’s Six-Gun Samurai (1981–82) novels and Guy N. Smith (probably more for the knee-tremblers in alleys and doorways than the slime beasts and giant crabs). I’d given up on Agatha Christie after reading all the Marples I could find (I never liked Poirot) but was starting to read Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett by about 1983. I discovered Mick Norman and Mick Farren, as well as Michael Moorcock (except Elric, could never get into Elric) and grumpy oddball Peter Van Greenaway. Curiously, although my mate Stewart was a huge fan, I never got into Stephen King, and I still find his fiction utterly unengaging. But I did get totally into JRR Tolkien in 1980. And out again completely by 1984 or thereabouts, after many re-reads, even of the appendices and The Silmarillion (1977). I gave up on David Eddings and Raymond Feist by 1985, the year I also ditched Frank Herbert: I was sufficiently loyal to slog through Chapterhouse: Dune (1985) but had been bored since at least God Emperor of Dune (1981). But the overlapping and intertwined story of my autodidactic route through sf and fantasy – similarly thrilling-yet-full-of-pathos – is something for another day.\n\nSuch omnivorous reading – more accurately described, in my case at least, as flailing around – is I think, characteristic of the autodidact. (By chance this morning, I read Michael Moorcock’s 2011 memoir-essay ‘A Child’s Christmas in the Blitz’ and recognised a little something of my own childhood in his ‘I learned from reading and not knowing what was respectable literature and what was not. I read everything.’) But it also resembles the ability to access both high and low culture now often attributed to middle class privilege, so perhaps this is not a story of autodidactism and cultural capital after all, but of ‘How I Became A Class Traitor’.\n\nThe strange thing is, the sense of being an autodidact has never gone away, even though I’ve been in formal education, as student or teacher, every year since the age of five. Apart, that is, from 1987–88, when I took a year off between A-levels and university (because I was so disgusted by what I witnessed during my Oxford interview, but that too is another story). For about 14 months, I toiled as a motor insurance claims handler for the Co-op Insurance Service and the Cornish Mutual Association. I was less than mediocre. I never got beyond processing windscreen claims, and every day I hated that my job mostly consisted of getting claimants to use language that implied their broken windscreen was made of toughened rather than laminated glass, which meant they were liable for the cost of the replacement’s upgrade in quality, even if there hadn’t actually been one (not that this was how my role was described to me). As careers go, it was clearly not for me.\n\nAnd all these years later, I still don’t drive. Which would have probably undermined my prospects for advancement.\n\nAround that time, Marshall Cavendish published the Great Writers partwork. It was an image-heavy magazine, with broad brush historical context and biographical commentary on that issue’s author(s), accompanied by a hardback edition of a novel or collection or other book-length work. The books came, with no apparent rhyme or reason, in red, navy blue, bright blue, black, brown or green covers. Each bore a vaguely illustrative image and ever so slightly embossed fancy gold writing. They were cheaply produced in Spain. I can’t remember whether it was published weekly for a year or fortnightly for two (either way, there seems to have been 54, rather than 52, issues). I purchased it – but did not read it – diligently.\n\nThe magazines and later the books were discarded years ago, during the many moves between rented accommodation familiar to any student and early career academic. But by chance this year I read two of the books included in the series for the first time – Charles Darwin’s The Voyage of the Beagle (1839) and Katherine Mansfield’s Bliss, and Other Stories (1920) – which started me wondering how many of the 54 volumes I’d actually read during the intervening 35 years.\n\nHere, as far as I can reconstruct it, is the complete list of The Great Writers (not in order of publication).

The Anthropocene Unconscious: Climate Catastrophe Culture is made up by four chapters of incredibly varied analyses of books and movies which aim to find out their Anthropocene unconscious. But while working on your book it always seemed to me, that there’s a fundamental message to be found in the introduction and conclusion, where you suggest that every reader (and watcher) can set out to find the unconscious world of a text – whether it be Jameson’s political unconscious, a queer unconscious or, of course, the Anthropocene unconscious. This allows us to imagine a sort of democratic, grassroots, extra-academic idea of criticism which seems, to me, as important as it is revolutionary. I’d like to get to know more about how you picture this democratic literary and cultural lay criticism; and I’d love to know what can we do from within the university (where both of us are positioned, you as a professor and me as a PhD scholar) and within the small and multifaceted world of cultural reviews (where this interview will be published) to facilitate this democratisation of the critical discourse.\n\nMARK: There are whole realms of extra-academic criticism out there. Book clubs, Goodreads, Letterboxd, imdb user comments, people getting a piece of pie after a good movie and talking about it. It might not be criticism in the way academia or broadsheets or literary journals do criticism, but it’s criticism nonetheless. People respond to texts in all kinds of complex ways all the time, including the unconscious dimension – even if they’ve not read Pierre Macherey or Fredric Jameson and are unaware they’re doing it.\n\nIt’s partly why different people understand texts in such very different ways. You just have to be in a classroom with students discussing a book or a film and they will come out with the most amazing things. As with ‘professional’ criticism, some of those things are quite nonsensical, some are rote and cliched and boring, some are interesting and insightful, some clearly come from a particular life experience – all are generated from the individual’s situated (social) knowledge. They’ve all read the same words on the page or seen the same images on the screen, but what they each bring activates different parts of the text in different ways, drawing out an array of things that are there/not-there , flickering between the conscious and unconscious of the text (sometimes even reordering which you think is which). Some of it never really gets past basic judgments: “it was boring” or “I liked it” or “it wasn’t relatable” (whatever the fuck that means). But some of it, ah, some of it is exciting and creative and useful.\n\nOr look at organised science fiction fandom: there’s a century-long tradition of lay criticism, some of it really high end and smart and challenging. It may not use critical theory, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t do and say important things. A significant proportion of active fans are graduates, have some background in arts and humanities, so they draw on some of the critical frameworks and resources academics tend to privilege, but they also reject some – partly, I suspect, because they represent a kind of institutionalised power, which is fair enough.\n\nIn terms of what we academics can do, first, we can treat lay criticism with respect. Like academic work, swathes of it’ll not seem relevant and some of it’s garbage. And as you know from academic conference panels when one or two of the papers are really weak, you never ever say that aloud in the Q&A. Because courtesy. Because work and life are hard. And because certain kinds of elitist power are embedded in academic seniority – particularly white male seniority – so you are never that kind of dick, and you shut down anyone who is. Which doesn’t mean there isn’t room for disagreement and argument. And we should treat lay criticism with the same respect: it might have different purposes and intentions, different reasons and reasonings, but that’s no excuse for denigrating or ignoring it.\n\nSecond, to the extent that academics are public intellectuals, part of our responsibility is to engage with these bigger worlds. Which means writing and speaking in other kinds of venues, learning different voices, understanding different audiences. So the other week I went from a picket line in the morning to do a student teach-out on sf in the afternoon and then in the evening to introduce a screening of the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Cyborg, being screened by the Bristol Bad Film Club in honour of its recently deceased director, Albert Pyun. Orthis week, on top of doing a bunch of admin, delivering a conference paper, prepping classes, grading essays and peer-reviewing an academic journal article, I was the guest on a Fantasy/Animation podcast about Free Guy (2021), helped a colleague pitch his book on cultural representations of Thugee to a trade press, wrote an Earth Day blog for Verso about sabotaging fossil fuel infrastructure, proposed a review of M. John Harrison’s new “anti-memoir” (but a mate got there before me, thank goodness, because it is an amazing book and impossible to review), volunteered to introduce an obscure old Norman J. Warren movie (which didn’t work out) – and did this interview (not all my weeks are this busy). None of these other things are part of my job – my employer doesn’t value, reward or respect them – but they should be.\n\nAnd for all these things, you put in the time to moderate and modulate what you have to say. Last year, I got to interview the director Lucile Hadžihalilović live on stage after a screening of her remarkable film Earwig. It’s not something I’ve ever really done before, so I spent less time rewatching her movies than I did researching how to make that kind of event valuable for an audience. (A really important tip: when you switch to the audience Q&A, always pick a woman to ask the first question, otherwise they tend to get shut out, and if you can get away with it, don’t select questions in order of raised hands but alternate between genders and always bring in any people of colour and young people who might be in your – let’s face it – predominantly white middle-aged arthouse audience.) I’m a massive fan and had all kinds of things I wanted to talk to her about but that’s not why I was there. It’s about respect. About not assuming just because you’re an academic you’re going to gallop in there on a white horse and teach people how to do criticism “properly.”\n\nWhich doesn’t mean I always pull it off – once, introducing Starcrash for the Bristol Bad Film Club, I was heckled by an eight-year-old and there’s no coming back from that – but it’s never for lack of preparation.\n\nThird, this kind of engagement should go the other way, opening up academic spaces to other people and never penalising them for not observing academic norms. For example, back in 2008 when Sherryl Vint and I set up Science Fiction Film and Television, we wanted a much wider range of contributors than is usual for an academic journal. And the reviews section was the obvious place to start. We set our sights on grad students, so they could get experience of writing for academic venues and build relationships within the field, but also sf writers and sf fans, who wrote some great stuff for us. We invited them into this perhaps rather alien environment and made it welcoming. Which is a very low-level version of what’s easily possible within existing structures.\n\nWhen UK universities talk about things like this – they call it “knowledge transfer” or “knowledge exchange” – it’s driven by engaging with industry, trying to find an additional revenue stream by subordinating the university to external corporate needs and agendas. Which makes some sort of sense for certain disciplines, I guess, but it’s such a narrow vision of the role we could and should play in the social, cultural and political life of the cities where we’re based. We’re an important part of local and regional economies, but that’s not all we are or could be.\n\nMARTA: Wow, that’s really interesting and it really shows how wide the array of possibilities is. And since you had so many possibilities of engaging with different audiences, and that’s something that not all of academics, strive for…\n\nMARK: Some of them shouldn’t be allowed near the general public, don’t get me wrong.\n\nMARTA: You’re so right. [Laughs] But my question is, what do you think about this sort of lay criticism when it’s played out in practice? Of course, this is very context-based. And probably the UK is going to be very different to Italy. I mean this also from a concrete, material point of view: do we have enough of these spaces already, and how can we do so while avoiding the risk of recreating other closed bubbles – as academia tends to do?\n\nMARK: Lay criticism often struggles to get past the 4-out-of-5-stars kind of thing: this consumer-advice model of journalistic criticism is what people tend to see, so they orient their responses in that way. And things like Letterboxd add to the problem because of the way it gives greatest visibility to the most liked reviews, which then pushes people to comment on new releases as quickly as possible, without time for reflection, or just to post some kind of amusing quip. So the reviews you’re most likely to see often have little meaningful content. Criticism takes time.\n\nBut some parts of lay criticism are really healthy. For example, there’s been a giant shift in sf culture over the last 20 years – really championing and celebrating Afrofuturism, Africanfuturism, Indigenous Futurism, Latinx Futurism, Asian futurism, feminist sf, queer sf, trans sf, sf by and about people with disabilities, and so on – and that’s been much more driven by lay criticism and by fans’ political commitments, using online venues, crowdfunding, small presses and so on, than by anything we academics have been doing. This sustained change of emphasis in fiction being valued is also why we kind of won (for now) the sf “culture wars.” When the Sad Puppies and the Rabid Puppies tried to rig the Hugo Awards to recentre pros sf as some kind of right wing, misogynist, white supremacist, homophobic tech bro nonsense, they were soundly thrashed. And that’s largely because of a global fan culture that incorporates lay criticism as part of what it does, as part of how it understands itself. It’s not just reading the books. It’s thinking about them and talking about them. And it’s one of the places I find a massive hopeful potential for what you called “democratic criticism”.\n\nMARTA: Yeah, that sounds really nice. I’ve not been in academia for long but it seems like this is something that we should strive towards.\n\nMARK: Well I’ve been doing the academic thing for so many years… I’d like it to actually have some practical results: after all, the point is not just to interpret the world but to change it!\n\nMARTA: I’d like to go on to the actual concept of Anthropocene. Because everyone seems to be talking about it, and we should by now be familiar with the definition of this term from an environmentalist point of view, but something which I have gathered from a lot of people reading your book is, “Well, now I actually know what the Anthropocene is!” People in newspapers and talk show talk about it, but they don’t really explain what the term is about, what’s its history: it’s not widely known that, for example, it is used to describe, as you say, a range of very different periods, with different geographical localisations. And of course there’s not only the Anthropocene, but there are so many other coinages which you go through, from “Chthulhucene” to the “Plantationocene” and the “Capitalocene”. And so of course there are a lot of meanings that come with the word: it’s a word heavy with meanings. But my question is, if we want to move the discussion onto a cultural and literary field, what does the Anthropocene mean as a term of literary and cultural enquiry? And of course it’s not possible to detach literary and cultural inquiry from economic and environmental contexts. But do you think that literature can use this openness, this fluidity of the word, to create new meanings?\n\nMARK: Part of the reason for mapping out definitions and alternatives is that I had to go on that journey myself to figure out the book. But it’s also about keeping a sense of how open and contested meaning is – that the possibilities continue to unfold, often in unpredictable ways. I wanted that to reverberate throughout the whole book, not just when I’m offering a reading of a particular novel or film or comic. (The very first review hated this – it wanted the book to state definitively and unambiguously the “secret hidden meaning” of absolutely everything, from the mountain lions in Ducks, Newburyport to the sharks in Sharknado – but everyone else seems to have got the point.)\n\nThe study of Anthropocene culture as Anthropocene culture is in its early stages, and it needs to not fall into the tendency in any new field to try to lock things down, to rigidly fix definitions and parameters. But it is hard to avoid. For example, when I was reviewing Dan Hassler-Forest’s brilliant Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Politics: Transmedia World-Building Beyond Capitalism (2016), I did my due diligence and read a number of the recent big name books on transmediality and IP franchises, and it was kind of heartbreaking. All these smart people caught up in a pre-critical anatomising phase, doggedly coining new terms for the different kinds of relationships between a franchise’s texts in different media… They all seemed stuck. Less interested in moving on to serious critical work than in demanding everyone else accept their distinctions and designations. As if they had any means to enforce such shibboleths! Meanings are social, unstable. They can’t be fixed in place like that. Much better to work with contingency.\n\nThe longer we keep the definition of the Anthropocene in flux the better, so as to enable, say, Elizabethan scholars, who might feel excluded by certain periodisations, to be part of the struggle. If we date the Anthropocene from the post-war Great Acceleration, we risk losing all the potential in the work of scholars exploring the roots of our thinking about climate and energy and nature. As if these older texts were written in a world that somehow didn’t have climate or weather or catastrophe, as if they haven’t been read since then, as if they’ve played no role in subsequent generations’ thinking engagement with the world. It’s perhaps easier for Film Studies – we just have to date the Anthropocene from Svante Arrhenius’s 1896 discovery of the greenhouse effect and that’s all but the first few months of cinema covered!\n\nBut the important thing is to avoid daft turf wars and maintain openness – about meanings, but also about who is part of the conversation. Which brings us back to our last question. There’s no point to these discussions going on in academia and nowhere else. They need to play their part in effecting the massive change of consciousness about how we live in the world. We can’t not engage with this stuff publicly. We can’t not encourage everybody to be involved in the solutions. Because it’s not going to be one solution. Petrocapitalism is so deeply imbricated in everything we do. Dismantling fossil fuel infrastructure is such a massive task – and one to which not a single nation is committed – that we can’t just wait for it to happen. Nor can we imagine it will happen anywhere near quickly enough: that ship sailed in November 1989, when the US, the UK, the USSR and Japan derailed concrete international emissions targets at the Noordwijk conference; and it has sailed again and again and again, after every IPCC report, after every COP meeting.\n\nWe have to change the how we think and the how we live. And the only way to get people to embrace that is through engaging with them all the time about it. It doesn’t have to be depressing and browbeating, though that does serve a purpose; it can be positive and creative. For example, my partner runs a national network that encourages people to think about food in all its aspects: they are growing food together, cooking together, sharing meals, getting to know and work with each other. Sometimes it involves larger organisations, sometimes it’s half a dozen people here, twenty people there, but it’s the beginning of a change of consciousness about where food comes from. People are growing fruit and vegetables, eating more healthily, strengthening local ecologies, shortening supply chains, learning about different cultures, building communities. It is a very small drop in a very large ocean, but that doesn’t make it insignificant. We have to fight the big fights against fossil capitalism, and always have one eye on the parts per million, on not breaching 2°C, on not breaching 1.5°C (even though that’s another ship that’s sailed). But we also have to build a better world, and to do that we need to discover and ensure the appeal of living differently to the way we do now.\n\nSo alongside that blog about blowing up pipelines, I’m trying to write about ending private car ownership. It is so astonishingly and self-evidently costly and wasteful – but how do we break the libidinal appeal of the automobile, with its mythology of speed and freedom? How do we make alternatives just as sexy? Not everyone gets turned on by the idea of fast, efficient and free public transport (though in the UK, cheap and adequate would probably be enough to get me all hot and bothered). But what if alongside public transport, and, say, legislative measures reducing the cubic capacity of all new car engines to something as resolutely unsexy as a litre or less, we begin seriously to ask: what if our streets were gardens? Arbors to sit in with our friends and neighbours? Communally owned vegetable patches? Havens for wildlife? Pulling down carbon, scrubbing polluted air. And what if our driveways became piazzas? Our garages, bedrooms so the kids don’t have to share, or offices, or community tool sheds or libraries or artists’ studios? You might be able to sell the suburban middle classes on a vision like that, even if it means them giving up using their SUVs for the school run…\n\nMARTA: Yes. And there’s also something very interesting of this pervasiveness of the Anthropocene. As you said, it’s part of our day to day life and it’s going to be part of our future. And this is something that’s not hard to point out. So, since it is so pervasive and fluid, how would you define its “unconscious” status? Fredric Jameson, concerning his political unconscious, was heavily criticised for example by Eve Sedgwick, who pointed out that his way of reading texts was a “paranoid reading”, because it’s went too much into the depth of the texts. But in your book you make very clear something that we’ve also been saying during our chat: that there’s no need to delve in the depth of the text, you don’t need complicated theory, and this is why also lay criticism can uncover the Anthropocene unconscious of a text. In the intro of your book, you say something that has really stuck with me; that in literary analysis there is “no bunny to be taken out of a hat – often, there’s not even a hat”! Because the Anthropocene lies on the surface of many texts, from trash movies to posh literature. So I wanted to reflect on this with you, and I’d also like to know if this can influence the fact that, as we said, the Anthropocene unconscious is open to a very wide and democratic concept of criticism: we just have to see what’s below our noses, and be open to acknowledge the variety of meanings of a text.\n\nMARK: I get the criticism about “paranoid hermeneutics.” Jameson was pretty much the first person to articulate the idea of the text’s political unconscious so he does come on a bit strong. But I don’t think these two approaches are necessarily mutually exclusive. Sedgwick writes that the impulse behind her “reparative readings” has a realistic fear “that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture” and that “it wants to assemble and confer plenitude on an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self.” There’s a related debate going on in contemporary American literary theory at the moment, with Rita Felski’s The Limits of Critique attacking a straw-man version of “the hermeneutics of suspicion.” She argues that it’s time to drop what Marx called “the rigorous critique of all that exists” in favour of the readers’ affective connections to the text, to replace demystification with re-enchantment. As if reason and affect can really be separated out in this way; as if we can only do one thing at a time. So I can see how these different approaches might seem to contradict each other, but they really don’t have to.\n\nJameson is right to basically equate the political unconscious of a text with the mode of production – its ubiquity is largely why our culture is so inadequate and inimical – but we are wrong if we suggest that that is the end of the text. That is why, for example, when I say things like “all zombie movies now cannot not be about climate refugees,” I always insist “whatever else they might mean.” The point is to simultaneously deflate and inflate the text, to lay it bare while also opening up all it has to offer. (An intriguing attempt at this can be found in Uneven Futures: Strategies for Community Survival from Speculative Fiction (2022), edited by Ida Yoshinaga, Sean Guynes and Gerry Canavan.)\n\nAs for the textual unconscious being on the surface…do you know the John Wick films? The first one is a nicely done, violent little movie with a modest budget ($20–30 million). Keanu Reeves plays a legendary Bratva assassin, known as the Baba Yaga, who fell in love and completed an impossible mission to be allowed to quit the life. Years later some upstart Russian mobsters steal his car and, worse, kill the puppy his recently deceased wife left him to help him through his grief. So he comes out of retirement to wreak his revenge. He begins by heading to The Continental, a fancy New York hotel just for assassins (they are not allowed to attack each other on the premises). It’s an odd little absurdity in a film that’s otherwise not really any more plausible or implausible than action thrillers usually are – but it is also the tip of an iceberg. As the series proceeds, each budget and body count bigger than the last, so this criminal demimonde hidden in the shadows of our world becomes an increasingly absurd, baroque, global conspiracy of mafias and crime syndicates controlled by a group called the High Table and, above them, The Elder (other characters have significant names like Harbinger, The Director and Charon). It’s like Foucault’s Pendulum if you replaced the alchemy with assassins, the Kabbalah with kung fu. By the time we get to John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023), there’s this entire mirror world – the Continental is one of a global chain of fancy hotels just for assassins – and the film bounces around between New York, the Moroccan desert, Osaka, Paris. The final act sees John Wick, with a $40 million dollar price on his head, fighting wave after wave after wave of heavily armed assassins, henchmen, gangbangers and street punks as he makes his way across Paris to Montmartre to fight a duel at dawn in front of the Sacré-Coeur. Dozens of cars and even more corpses pile up in a huge battle around the Arc de Triomphe, and through the streets and apartment buildings of the 18th arrondissement. As sunrise is imminent, Keanu fights and shoots and karate chops his way up the 222 stairs of the Rue Foyatier, gets thrown all the way down to the bottom, and like Laurel and Hardy in The Music Box, does it all again (without a piano, obvs).\n\nSo how do we find the textual unconscious of such a film? One way is to begin with the affective response: the thrills; the enjoyment; the repetitive tedium; the astonishingly camp-without-knowing-it opening sequence; Donnie Yen as a blind swordsman; Keanu still not being able, three decades after Point Break (1991), to deliver certain kinds of dialogue; and so on. And then you think, Oh, hold on, what’s missing from this film? And you move from the enjoyment to the terms of that enjoyment: you wonder, what is necessary for that enjoyment to happen? One place to start is the fact that at no point during all this night’s mayhem do any of the many bystanders call the police. The film’s generic worldbuilding, which enables us to give credence to all this hilarious nonsense, excludes elements of the real world – from the way bullet proof vests actually work to the economics of running a hotel chain – even though it’s set in some version of the real world (albeit one where things like gravity and momentum function differently). The world of the High Table is nested within but hermetically sealed off from the world, just as the film, a product of petrocapitalism, never thinks about its mode of production, never pauses to contemplate the terms of its international jet-setting (on either narrative or production levels). And this is precisely what Amitav Ghosh describes as the foundational and defining limitation of “serious literary fiction” that renders it incapable of addressing climate change: it opts for an intensive focus on a particular finite social and physical setting, minimising or severing its interconnections with the world beyond, such as “the imperial networks that make possible the worlds portrayed by Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte.” But that doesn’t mean your ruthless critique of all that exists stops you responding in all kinds of affective ways to Bennet sisters or the Baba Yaga.\n\nMARTA: Woah, this is brilliant. But I absolutely agree that these are strands of criticism that can be joined together. Okay, so, just to close up our chat, I’d like to ask you a lighter question, something that’s made me curious: you wrote this book three years ago, but it was an eventful three years to say the least, because of the pandemic, because of the war that’s being fought at the borders of Europe and the public discourse about nuclear energy that it has sparked, and so much more. And so in the book, the macro-areas on which you focus are fossil fuels, water and trees and of course, climate change. But my question is, if you were to add something new to that, would you focus on something different, at the moment? And of course, this question leads me to another one: during the video that you made for the first Italian presentation of the book [in November 2022 in Bologna], you mentioned that you were writing a sequel. So of course, I would like to ask you if the project’s still going on and what we should expect from that.\n\nMARK: The pandemic was in one way really helpful – it meant I ended up home alone for five weeks just as I got to the point when I needed five uninterrupted weeks to finish writing it. So if only out of gratitude, it should really have had a chapter on contagion narratives. And I’m still really disappointed that I was unable to find the resources to write a geology chapter, something from the viewpoint of rocks; I was getting nowhere fast, and then trees came to my rescue – I read Richard Powers’s The Overstory (2018) and suddenly this alternative chapter about trees coalesced out of thin air.\n\nThe sequel I’m writing, Climate Monsters, is largely a figment of my imagination at the moment, but it begins with the 1816 Mount Tambora eruption, which changed global weather patterns and created “the year without summer”. And it is because of the miserable weather in 1817 that the Byron-Shelley party were stuck indoors by Lake Geneva, entertaining themselves by trying to come up with horror stories. So there’s this astonishingly generative moment born of particles suspended in the upper atmosphere altering climate: we get Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818) and, via Polidori’s “The Vampyre” (1819) and Byron’s “Augustus Darvell” fragment (1819), we get the modern vampire as more fully formulated in Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897). The Tambora eruption also changed the monsoon season through South Asia, leading to a mutation in the cholera bacteria which caused a global pandemic, and the “year without summer” led to a massive typhus outbreak in Ireland which spread across Europe. Contagion is key to Stoker’s novel and to Shelley’s The Last Man (1826); a key moment in Frankenstein is underpinned by terror of the revolutionary “mob,” both proletarian and anti-colonial, and Uriah Derick D’Arcy’s “The Black Vampire” (1819) features a Haitian slave killed by his owner returning as a vampire, which gets is to contemporary representations of the multitude, such as zombies. So I want to track the monstrous progeny of Tambora as a way to start thinking about the relationships between climate and monsters. The polar regions of the Frankenstein frame story lead to Poe’s Arthur Gordon Pym (with sequels by Jules Verne and others), which leads to Lovecraft’s At the Mountains of Madness (1936) and John W. Campbell’s riposte, ‘Who Goes There?” (1938), the source of John Carpenter’s The Thing (1982) and its legacy, including TV shows like Fortitude (2015–18), while other recent polar horror novels include trans characters, characters coming to terms with being the product of in-vitro fertilisation, and so on, which prompts some serious questions about how the things we label monstrous have changed. And so on.\n\nAs you can probably tell, it’s all a bit of a jumbled mess in my head at the moment. So far I’ve made two key decisions. I’ve decided to hive off part of my original idea – on the forms monstrosity takes in fiction about fossil fuels – into a separate book, Carbon Monsters.
