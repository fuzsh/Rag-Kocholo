        "text": "book review Librarian commands firing squad in Australian tale\n\nBy Fred Cleaver\n\nScience Fiction Columnist\n\nJuly 25 - Libraries can lose sight of the importance of books in their quest for more computer power. When the computer parts are human slaves and the head librarian has a firing squad at her disposal, the situation is much worse. That is the power given to Highliber Zarvora in \"Souls in the Great Machine,'' by Sean McMullen (Tor, $27.95).\n\nLong after Greatwinter, culture is rebuilding in Australia and computers are being re-created with human technology rather than electronics. Anyone with some mathematical ability is in danger of being abducted and put to work as a component in the calculor.\n\nAmong those imprisoned is John Glasken, a university student and playboy, who had a vengeful librarian among his many lovers. This librarian is crazier than most and is willing to plunge all Australia into war to get what she wants.\n\nA mysterious aspect of this world is the Call, a periodic siren that grips people and makes them wander off lemminglike to the sea if they are not tethered down. One of the many things Zarvora is studying is why some people seem to be immune to the Call.\n\nGlasken is one of those who learn the secret to immunity from the Call. Add jealous lovers, conspiracies and duels and \"Souls in the Great Machine'' becomes flooded with plot. There are many fascinating concepts and images in the book's great beginning, but it should be twice as long to include all the events that follow. - McMullen is one of the recent genera tion of Australians who have made that continent a rich source of dynamic new writers. All of these authors are included in the large survey collection \"Centaurus: The Best of Australian Science Fiction,'' edited by David G. Hartwell and Damien Broderick (Tor, $29.95).\n\nThe contributors are almost all writers of the past 20 years. The exception is A. Bertram Chandler with one of the many space adventures of ship's officer John Grimes, who voyaged through space, much as Chandler did on the sea in the South Pacific.\n\nThe most prominent of the new writers is Greg Egan. His brilliant extrapolative imagination shines in the excellent \"Wang's Carpets.'' Others already known in the United States are Peter Carey, George Turner and Stephen Dedman.\n\nOne of the newest writers here has one of the most intriguing stories. In \"Written in Blood,'' Chris Lawson presents a dramatic interaction of science and religion as a woman watches her father have the Koran encoded in the DNA of his blood.\n\n- Three of these authors are also represented in the latest volume of the book that has to be read every year - \"The Year's Best Science Fiction,'' edited by Gardner Dozois (St. Martin's Press, $29.95). Egan and Lawson are here, along with Cherry Wilder.\n\nIt's silly to pick favorites among so many good stories, but here are three out of 24. In \"Taklamakan,'' Bruce Sterling has a startling view of space colonists in the Asian desert. Ted Chiang beautifully paces reality and perception in \"Story of Your Life.'' Robert Charles Wilson visits the end of the world and a lost science-fiction author in \"Divided by Infinity.''\n\n- \"Through Alien Eyes,'' by Amy Thomson (Ace, $13.95), applies the lessons of a well-constructed alien ecology to the problems of Earth.\n\nJuna Saari is taking two Tendu back with her to Earth. Moki is her adopted son, still a child in Tendu terms at 34. Ukatonen, almost 1,000 years old, is a distinguished enkar, a kind of traveling judge.\n\nThe desolation and artificiality of the spaceship sends Ukatonen into a deep de pression and longing for the forest environment of home. He overcomes this in the grape vineyards of Saari's space colony where she brings the aliens into her utopian extended-marriage family.\n\nThe Tendu can alter their vocal cords so they can add human sounds to the language patterns they write on their skins. The ability they have to make changes in their own bodies extends to healing human illnesses and makes them much-sought-after miracle workers, although that was not the reason for their trip.\n\nUkatonen would like to extend this miracle-working to our planet's ailing ecology. This rubs up against the human fear of the different, which spurs so much hatred and violence. \"Through Alien Eyes'' updates Robert Heinlein's \"Stranger in a Strange Land'' with a gentler and more modern message.\n\n- \"The Twinkling of an Eye, or, My Life as an Englishman,'' by Brian W. Aldiss (St. Martin's, $32.50), is a fascinating account of the life of the great British science-fiction writer. He not only describes his childhood interests in space and science fiction, but he also relives family cruelties that he later revisited on his own children.\n\nWorld War II experience on the forgotten front in Burma put the ordinariness of Britain in perspective. Childhood and Burma provide the foundations for the struggle to establish a writing career and eventually a happy family life."
