It’s gorgeously written.”\n\n– Alexandra\n\n“What a gloriously vibrant and vicious tale.”\n\n– William Preston\n\n“‘The Queen of Calligraphic Susurrations’… is set on a highly cybernetic future Earth in which even some insects such as bees are linked into the global net… The author of this SF piece explores the real meaning of creativity and asks just what level of external assistance is acceptable if an original work is to be claimed as ones own.”\n\n– Geoff Houghton\n\nOn “The Vanishing of Ultratatts” (Rosalind’s Siblings):\n\n“[W]onderful and hinted at an enormous amount of worldbuilding behind the story.”\n\n– Alexandra Pierce\n\nOn “Symbiosis” (Clarkesworld #196):\n\n“Gutsy tale but it works; good points on consent. Novel take on what is binary.”\n\n– GCL\n\n“Spires deftly moves us through the story, starting from a strange but typical genre trope (forced pregnancy for social/civic reasons) to an even stranger place.”\n\n– Karen Burnham, Locus\n\nOn “Xiaolongbao: Soup Dumplings” (Clarkesworld #180):\n\n“A bittersweet story of love, loss, longing and hope. Lyrical prose that sets the tone for the feel of the story as a whole, not just in terms of language. There’s some magic and some science fiction, combining to make this heart-warming tale. The story revolves around two women who make xiaolongbao, for tradition, memory and umami. The timeline of this story is set in a modern world, but the lovely prose gives us a timeless sort of feel. Very enjoyable story.”\n\n– myra naik\n\n“Lovely prose, fascinating teases of worldbuilding, excellent food description. I really, really want soup dumplings now.”\n\n– Anon Reviews Sf\n\n“An interesting look at this culture.”\n\n– Sam Tomaino, SF Revu\n\nOn “The Exuberant Vitality of Hatchling Habitats” (Multispecies Cities: Solarpunk Urban Futures):\n\n“[W]e follow along as a quirky eco-businessman sees broader applications for a high school science fair project… Science is gentle and there is a multiplicity of voices. These stories of solutions look toward a green future of healthy ecosystems and cities teeming with life.”\n\n– Leanne Ogasawara\n\n“#MakeReadingSexyAgain”\n\n– Tochukwu Okafor\n\nOn “Mamaborg’s Milk and the Brilliance of Gems” (Clarkesworld #174):\n\n“Luqiong is a single mother, alone, caring for her baby daughter, Aijin. But in this future world, her challenges are a bit different. Nicely done.”\n\n– Sam Tomaino, SF Revu\n\n“The theme of breastfeeding is unique in science fiction, as far as I know, and gives the story unusual emotional appeal.”\n\n– Victoria Silverwolf, Tangent\n\n“A story of a mother trying to do anything, everything she can to find a better life for herself and her child. Scavenging in a setting highly automated and highly corrupt, where there isn’t enough of anything but love and hope.”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\nOn “Last Wishes” (Clarkesworld #169):\n\n“…it is all so beautifully done. The story is dedicated to her mother and certainly is a beautiful tribute.”\n\n– Sam Tomaino, SFRevu\n\n“…one of those narratives which grabs me and spits me our like from a dream when the story ends. Beautifully written.”\n\n– Simona Vesela\n\n“[T]his is a deeply personal and heartfelt story.”\n\n– Karen Burnham\n\n“[A] tale of a mourning daughter given a final puzzle in her mother’s urn; left to unpack a history of interwoven meanings in her mother’s life.”\n\n– M L Clark\n\nOn “The Iridescent Lake” (Clarkesworld #165):\n\n“[V]ery much enjoyed it. Felt very lived-in, well-thought-out, and real. Gave me a lot to think about.”\n\n– Jeff B.\n\n“It’s a nicely paced and rendered piece, with solid world building and full characters, and I definitely recommend checking it out! A great read!”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\nOn “Coffee Boom: Decoctions, Micronized” (Clarkesworld #162):\n\n“A fresh and quirky concept, well-realized.”\n\n– Gary Tognetti\n\n“I personally love how the piece combines its elements and delivers a fun, triumphantly flavorful reading experience.”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\n“A fun caper to “acquire” the best coffee grinder in a future where (almost) all coffee (and food) is artificial!”\n\n– Elizabeth C.\n\n“I LOVE coffee, so this was brilliant.”\n\n– Art K.\n\n“Fun, delightful story even if you don’t drink coffee!”\n\n– Sam Tomaino\n\n“…this is a wonderful story. I hope you get to read it while drinking your favourite cup of coffee.”\n\n– Jennifer Shelby\n\n“Such a great heist story, in pursuit of a high-tech high quality coffee! I loved this.”\n\n– Cameron Van Sant\n\nOn “Caihong Juji” (ROBOT DINOSAURS!):\n\n“The Rainbow Dinosaur! yes! I love this new story.”\n\n– K.C. Mead-Brewer\n\nOn “Nutrition Facts” (Uncanny #31):\n\n“Such a lovely story. I adore @spireswriter’s poetic style, and her love of food and family is always so apparent. This story really shines.”\n\n– Elizabeth Rubio\n\nOn “Antarctica” (Clarkesworld #158):\n\n“It’s a bracing read full of cold and resilience, and it makes for a great story!”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\n“The author creates a compelling portrait of Antarctica, in a clear, vivid style.”\n\n– Victoria Silverwolf, QSR\n\nOn “Onyx Woods and the Grains of Deception” (Clarkesworld #155):\n\n“…it’s definitely a piece to spend some time with, and a fine read!”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\n“This inventive story by D.A. Xiaolin Spires, tells of a land exploited and the peasants who do the exploiting at the behest of those more powerful.”\n\n(Selected as “Must-Read Speculative Short Fiction” for the month.)\n\n– Alex Brown, Tor.com\n\n“So good!”\n\n– Katherine Karch\n\n“Very talented author. Read this!”\n\n– Alex, Kasma SF\n\n“Killer story about a world where you just need a good ally and a tasty scalp. @spireswriter is so good.”\n\n– John Wiswell\n\n“This story is beautiful.”\n\n– Pamela Deering\n\nOn “But, Still, I Smile” (Clarkesworld #150):\n\n“She’s becoming one of my favorite authors more and more these days. Another great story!”\n\n– Kevin\n\n“Interesting story. I love how the narrator is so antagonistic and flawed.”\n\n– Cathy\n\n“Dengwen’s psychology and actions are completely central to the story, and there’s a lot of complexity here.”\n\n(Listed as a recommended story in Karen Burnham’s May review column in Locus Magazine)\n\n– Karen Burnham\n\n“Great ending!”\n\n– Amber\n\nOn “Marshmallows” (Clarkesworld #147):\n\n“…I love that because of how real it seems, because it speaks to privilege and power, and how addictive it is… A great read!”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\n“100% MUST READ….MUST LISTEN TO!”\n\n– Synchronicity Of The Heart\n\n“Awesome story!”\n\n– J.T. Hamilton\n\n“This was such a great read. Big cyberpunk vibe that I really enjoyed… I loved this story!”\n\n– Jonothan Pickering\n\n“Much like marshmallows, this story is wonderful.”\n\n– Gretchen Tessmer\n\n“Good ending to this one.”\n\n– Sam Tomaino\n\n“I’m an absolute sucker for interesting tech in science fiction – so naturally I quite enjoyed reading ‘Marshmallows’…”\n\n– Matthew Bailey\n\n“Marshmallows is a great example of stellar worldbuilding and is a dark, delicious, holiday-themed science fiction short. If you need a quick read or listen while you digest that pot roast and fruit cake, check it out!”\n\n– Tipsy Nerds Book Club Podcast\n\n“Delightfully dark story!”\n\n– Courtney, Tipsy Nerds Book Club Podcast\n\n“Augmented reality with Christmasy overlays…”\n\n(Named to the Diabolical Plots’ Best of Clarkesworld 2018 list)\n\n– David Steffen\n\nOn “Waves of Influence” (Clarkesworld #144):\n\n“…it shows the very complex nature of fame and power… it’s a wrenching and heartbreaking story and a great read!”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\n“I love the world-building in this and the story is so emotive and poignant.”\n\n– Monica Christine Woehlert Barraclough\n\n“Waves of Influence @clarkesworld looks into possible social media futures, and beauty and poverty and influence.”\n\n– Derek Künsken\n\n“The author creates an intriguing future world of advanced social media and digital manipulation of appearances.”\n\n– Victoria Silverwolf\n\n“I also love the story she has used to explore how this [social media/facial filters] might affect users – quite different from the usual narrative in real life.”\n\n– Eric Mesa\n\nOn “Vault” (Clarkesworld #141):\n\n“I can say that had it been printed media, I would have devoured it in order to absorb its magic…#goodstuff.”\n\n– Evan Marcroft\n\n“[T]he Spires story is a fun sci-fi adventure… This story gives a great view of a world that is both alien and human. That has been deeply touched by humanity’s damaging hand and yet retains something inhuman in it… And I love how Chenguang approaches it, how she traverses it, in bursts and spins, but being drawn toward something… It’s a fascinating read and a fine story!”\n\n(Praise from both his Patreon blog preview and his review on QSR.)\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR & Patreon\n\n“It’s a well-paced story with some very imaginative ideas and an instantly likeable, proactive hero… Spires’ story offers a fresh approach to the old-fashioned exploration and problem-solving sci-fi – the kind that is usually right up my alley.”\n\n– Gary Tognetti\n\n“I enjoyed the fantastically imaginative “Vault”… It’s one of those comfy sci-fi stories that feels familiar and yet different all at once.”\n\n– Holly Lyn Walrath\n\n“Intriguing story of exploration…”\n\n– Andrew Liptak\n\nOn “Prasetyo Plastics” (Clarkesworld #134):\n\n“…is wonderfully terrifying and you should read it.”\n\n– Osahon Ize-Iyamu\n\n“Spire’s prose is very beautiful and ripe for reflection… The story is well-paced and fascinating with a twist on the singularity that is thoughtful and terrifying.”\n\n– Rebecca DeVendra\n\n“…it challenges us to question what life can look like and what role humanity can and should play in creating, protecting, or fighting against new life that might emerge thanks to our own mistakes, oversights, and abuses… it is [a story] full of interesting ideas, and for that it’s certainly worth checking out.”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\n“interesting”\n\n– Gardner Dozois\n\n“Imaginative and chilling tale.”\n\n– Sam Tomaino\n\n“A thought provoking short with clear parallels to today’s environmental struggles, ‘Prasetyo’ is a fantastic story for anyone looking to read the latest in environmentally conscious sci-fi.”\n\n– Mauricio Rezende\n\n“Loving it.”\n\n– reader in Pakistan\n\n“Ooh, I love this story. I love stories that challenge the scientific community and go back to that one line that was uttered by Dr. Malcolm in Jurassic Park which was: ‘They spent all the time figuring out if they could, they never stopped to think if they should.’ I might be paraphrasing there, but it’s something that we really need to focus on and I’m not for hyper-regulation of the sciences. In fact, I think opening up our creative barriers is what allows us to expand as a species. But, we have to be careful about what we do. And I think this story is an excellent example of that.”\n\n– Kate Baker (podcast narration commentary)\n\nOn “Twisted Knots” (Clarkesworld #131):\n\n“Twisted Knots” was excellent and should be one of the year’s best stories.”\n\n– John\n\n“The premise is interesting and striking and the story is full of a weight that brings the reader down through its layers to a place where they can examine art and space and movement and family. It’s a lovely and beautiful story, and you should definitely check it out!”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\n“I thought it was nicely told, with a lot to like about [protagonist] Lilian.”\n\n– Chuck Rothman\n\n“worthwhile work”\n\n– Gardner Dozois\n\n“…[A] wonderful story… grand ideas, poignant moments and prose that performs mind-bending acrobatics.”\n\n– Dafydd McKimm\n\n“I think as artists whether it be writers, or puppeteers, or any sort of creative mind, I think our whole drive to create comes from imbuing work with life that wasn’t there. And I think what this story is ultimately trying to tell us is that we drive from our experiences in our life and we put everything that we are, everything that we’ve experienced and everything that we want to be into these works of art. And I think that’s why for some of us who listen or who read stories, depending on what is happening, we identify because we can relate on some level.”\n\n– Kate Baker (podcast narration commentary)\n\nOn “A Wispy Chastening” (Reckoning 2):\n\n“Told with gorgeous prose and infused with dreams and magic, this is a story about how our lives affect the natural world we’re a part of… A magic slice of prose that weaves a spell of its own.”\n\n(Recommended in Maria Haskins’ “extra awesome short stories” monthly roundup.)\n\n– Maria Haskins\n\n“Dreams and ducks and a devilish Sheperd. So good!”\n\n– Renee Christopher\n\nOn “Five Tangibles and One” (Terraform):\n\n“What I love about this piece is the way that it frames the love that Sam306 feels… the story is fun and moves with a fluid grace… A fantastic read!”\n\n(Also recommended in Charles Payseur’s “X Marks the Story” column at the Book Smugglers.)\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\n“A touching, insightful tale… This is a perfect example of how small, creative details in world building can make a story click into the deeper consciousness of readers.”\n\n– Jason Sanford\n\nOn “Path to Infinity” (Kasma SF):\n\n“Sunday night SF short story reading… Featuring mosquito-based robot diseases and the disintegration of mopping skills. Loved this story.”\n\n– Glenn Chenevre\n\nOn “Bubblegum Botress” (Grievous Angel):\n\n“I love everything about this story!”\n\n– Gabriel Smithwilson\n\nOn “DNA exchange” (Nature: Futures):\n\n“Awesome story!”\n\n– Steph P. Bianchini\n\nOn “Before the Burst” (Fireside Magazine):\n\n“It’s a story that leaves a tragic aftertaste, bitter and desolate. But it also feels true, and it makes for a great read!”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\n“action-packed”\n\n– Gary Tognetti\n\nOn “Suvu and Swashbuckling Love” (Andromeda Spaceways #69):\n\n“There are many allusions to knitting in ‘Suvu and Swashbuckling Love’, which is fitting, since it presents as something knitted with great care and attention to detail.”\n\n– Kris Ashton\n\nOn “Thin-skinned” (Chronicles– Monthly Challenge Story):\n\n“A strong sense of future shock is created in this story by propelling the reader directly into a tomorrow which only superficially resembles today. By showing us technology different from anything we know through the eyes of one who is used to it, the author offers the reader a true sense of wonder.”\n\n– Victoria Silverwolf\n\nOn “Toy ‘Story Time’ in Toy Land” (Chronicles– Monthly Challenge Story):\n\n“Reminds us that every good toy story has a good moral at the end of it and that’s why everyone looks forward to ‘Toy Story time, In Toy Land.'”\n\n– Parson\n\n“…it’s terrific. Well done!”\n\n– Cat’s Cradle\n\nOn “Manure Magnet” (Chronicles– Monthly Challenge Story):\n\n“An unexpected aspect of future technology comes to life in this comic encounter.”\n\n– Victoria Silverwolf\n\nOn “nakajiru” (Mithila Review– poetry):\n\n“…[I]t’s a bit of a haunting and yearning piece that is very much worth spending some time with!”\n\n– Charles Payseur, QSR\n\nOn “pacemaker” (Eye to the Telescope– poetry):\n\n“I just love ‘pacemaker’… Much of the enjoyment of ‘pacemaker,’ for me, lies in the whimsical wording the contrasts… Recommended for anyone currently hankering for a quick read to put a little pep in their step.”\n\n(Praise from specpotpourri’s “Recommended Reading: Rhysling-Eligible Poetry of 2018” and Twitter)\n\n– Brittany Hause\n\nHow to pronounce Xiaolin:\n\n[Like the word SHOUT minus the “T”] + [The word LEAN]\n\nor for an audio reference, click here.\n\nPublications where my works appear:"
