        "text": "Saw an interesting tweet the other day, of a double page spread from the Galaxy science fiction magazine, circa 1968. On the left hand side, a list of authors supporting America’s presence in Vietnam; on the right, an equally long list of authors opposed to the war. You can predict that the likes of Heinlein, Niven, and Pournelle were on the war-supporting page; while Le Guin, Bradbury, Harrison and Wilhelm were opposed.\n\nI’m not going to pretend to be so right-on that I only liked anti-war writers, but it was interesting to see this fissure in the genre and consider how this ideological split has endured, manifesting itself in the Hugo and Nebula awards controversies in recent times. People have strong opinions about what science fiction should be, and politics, politeness, inclusivity, and identity politics all play their part. Far be it from me to suggest that there are more recognisable names on the right side of history.\n\nA History of Science Fiction Anthologies\n\nObviously, you can’t move for science fiction (and fantasy) anthologies these days, and in many ways the anthology is the central text for the genre of science fiction. While the fantasy genre lends itself to epically long novels, the ur-form of science fiction is the short story. The best way of spinning out a fresh idea without worrying too much about plot or character development, and science fiction is above all a literature of ideas. So it seems to me that an annual collection, edited by someone with impeccable taste, is an essential primer, allowing readers to discover new writers and follow the trends in the genre as it continues to reflect the times we live in.\n\nCentral to my own early experience of science fiction is the Brian Aldiss edited Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus, which was last updated in 2006. My edition dates from 1974, however. The Aldiss anthology belongs to a different age: very few women or people of colour were included in that 1974 paperback, and the names mostly came from the “golden age” of the genre.\n\nAlongside that, I was gifted early on the very first World’s Best Science Fiction collection edited by Terry Carr — and it was the Carr collections that caught the “new wave” of science fiction from the 1960s onwards. I read the Carr annuals avidly until the 1980s, when the late Gardner Dozois began publishing his enormous annual collections.\n\nThirty-five years of those St. Martin’s Press anthologies until Dozois died, aged 70, in 2018, leaving a huge hole in the market. Other science fiction anthologies are available, many of them published in parallel with the Dozois editions, but none of them were quite up to the mark. Lots of them also included fantasy, which is not what I’m looking for in my annual purchase.\n\nEnter Saga\n\nI had high hopes for the new Saga anthology, which is clearly meant to step into the breach. Jonathan Strahan has experience as an editor and I had every reason to trust that this collection would hit the spot.\n\nEight months.\n\nThat’s how long it took me to get through this, from January when I first downloaded it, to yesterday, when I skim read my way through the last couple of stories. It just did not grab me. There were a few stories that I enjoyed, but far too many that I found to be a bore.\n\nIt’s not you, it’s me\n\nI’m prepared to believe that I’ve drifted away from the genre in recent times. Still love it, but the ‘right stuff’ is increasingly hard to find. I’d also say that even the Gardner Dozois collections were disappointing in his last few editions.\n\nPerhaps I’m just too old and too invested in those earlier decades. The genre is about different things now, and while I’d never align myself with the left hand side of that Galaxy page, maybe I’m just not the target audience. I’m a middle aged white male, a tiny demographic group with too much visibility. When I got to the end of the Saga collection, I took a look through the sources from which Strahan had drawn the collection, and here’s the thing.\n\nIt’s obvious that Strahan cast his net wide, trying to be as inclusive as possible, and he has successfully drawn in stories from around the globe, from Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe, from presses large and small, and publications both electronic and print. I absolutely applaud this and have no problem with it.\n\nAnd it occurred to me that at the peak of the Dozois years, upwards of 50% of the content of his collections might have come from two sources: Asimov’s Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Obviously, these collections were less diverse and less inclusive and it’s way past time for the genre to reflect society more fairly. But it’s also clear to me that – probably – I like that Asimov’s stuff, and I’m a lot less enamoured of the other sources.\n\nIn other words, I need to try harder to enjoy the diversity of the field. I didn’t this time, but maybe I’ll try again. Or maybe I’ll just subscribe to Asimov’s. At least he, Isaac Asimov, was against the war.\n\n“…you never really knew a man until you told him you didn’t love him.”\n\nI sometimes think I’ve ruined myself by reading so much genre fiction, meaning that I become restless if there isn’t much of a plot, so that I can’t really do ‘literary fiction’ anymore.\n\nBut this is the Summer of Reading, and there this was on my Kindle (bought on behalf of student daughter who is a massive Erdrich fan and who made a pilgrimage to the author’s book shop when she was touring the States), so I started it.\n\nAnd I was a bit restless for the first few dozen pages. This summer I’ve been reading science fiction, thrillers, ghost stories, espionage… and my restless brain wanted some narrative hook to fix upon. But of course I settled down soon enough, and I’m glad I did.\n\nThe Night Watchman is set in 1953, when the US Congress was deep into its latest round of reneging on treaty promises with First Nations people. House Concurrent Resolution 108, introduced by a racist senator, was designed to terminate the tribal status of American Indian Nations, abolish their reservations, and leave them impoverished and at the mercy of that most brutal form of economy, American capitalism. The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa were among the first five tribes targeted for termination.\n\nAnd like generations of tribes before them, they needed to campaign against the HCR-108 by sending a delegation to Washington, like the many delegations before them, to request that the US government abide by their treaty obligations, which had already confined the tribes to smaller and smaller territories of poor farm land. But there were still forests and there were minerals, and the white people wanted the wood and the minerals and the tribes were in the way.\n\nAll of which sounds grim and infuriating, and to read about this betrayal in the week of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, amid scenes of panic at the Kabul airport is to see something eternal about the United States and its attitude to promises made to people of colour.\n\nBut this book is not grim in its tone, although there are some grim events herein. Louise Erdrich has no interest in portraying her people as helpless victims who are at the mercy of greedy white people. The Turtle Mountain people are not naive; they may be tired and cynical about white people’s bullshit, but they are prepared to fight — and win. The Night Watchman is a story about a group of people who struggle economically, yes, but also live their lives and maintain their beliefs and their traditional ways as far as they are able. Dogs talk. Bears allow themselves to be hunted. Restless ghosts walk. People survive and endure against the odds.\n\nThe plot, such as it is, concerns the titular night watchman, Thomas, who goes without sleep in order to both do his job and lead the campaign against HCR-108 (not to mention being a great uncle and husband). Meanwhile, his niece Patrice is working at the same government-owned factory and negotiating her relationships with the various men in her life, including her drunk and violent father, the white teacher who fancies her, and Wood Mountain, the young boxer who tries to help her find her missing sister.\n\nPatrice is such a brilliant character. She’s curious about sex, knows all about it in Chippewa but needs to know about it in English. She’s good at her factory job, sets traps, chops wood, and sets off on her own adventure to Minneapolis to find the missing Vera and her baby. She’s also funny, cutting, and knows how to look after herself.\n\nThe purpose of literature is to allow us to empathise with others, to learn about the lives we do not live, and The Night Watchman immerses you in tribal life and tribal logic, allowing you to experience a point of view you might not have had before. As I said, this is not a plot-driven novel. The short chapters give you short snapshots of events and thought processes: it’s really more of a Menippean Satire than a novel. And sometimes you read a phrase that brings you up short. Like the quote at the top of this entry. Such a universal truth about men, something that all girls should probably know.\n\nAnd Patrice thought another thing her mother said was definitely true—you never really knew a man until you told him you didn’t love him. That’s when his true ugliness, submerged to charm you, might surface.\n\nGlass\n\nSo I tried Glass. Downloaded the app, clicked to open a new account using my Apple ID, and then waited a couple of days while I moved slowly/swiftly (how do you measure these things?) up the waiting list queue. Waiting list? Really? Invite code? I get it. It makes it seem more attractive and exclusive. Perhaps people are more likely to sign up if you make them wait. Fine. Here’s the thing, though. My daughter also clicked to join and then moved up the waiting list, and although she did so after I did, she received her invite code ahead of me. And then mine went into the Spam, so I missed it for a few hours.\n\nYou get a 14-day free trial, which is probably just enough time to decide whether you need it or not. After that it costs a fiver a month or £25 per year (at launch, as it says). So I think you’re going to have to really need it to be willing to pay.\n\nWhat is Glass? It’s an app (iOS only at the moment, because every developer knows that Android users in general don’t like paying for anything, it being the price-conscious choice – don’t @ me) that allows you to create an account, then upload photographs to it. You can follow other members, look at their photos, and post comments. They follow you and post comments on your photos, but there are no “like” buttons. The subscription fee means there are no ads, and they promise that your feed of photos will just be chronological, like in the good old days.\n\nThe good old days of what? Well, I was in at the ground floor (2004, baby) of the original Flickr, the photo sharing site that allowed you to create an account, upload photos, and like and comment on other people’s photos. Flickr was where the hashtag was invented, where the whole concept of photo sharing took off. Flickr was pre-iPhone, and one of the many reasons it died a death was that it was slow to get on the iPhone platform, and when it did it’s app was terrible. Meanwhile Instagram came along and stole Flickr’s thunder. Flickr was lost in various corporate takeovers and languishes, home to the die hards.\n\nI loved Flickr. There are still over 5000 photographs on my old account, but I’ve moved on to the extent that I’m not willing to pay an annual subscription to it. Which doesn’t bode well for Glass, I suppose.\n\nAnd here’s the thing. Very early on, I was put off by the bland comments. “Great shot”; or, worse, “Great capture”. I was also put off by the creeper tendency in the hobby of photography. The number of men who post photographs of women taken with their expensive camera equipment. Finally, I was put off by the narcissism of the selfie. In Flickr’s early days, we didn’t even have a name for the phenomenon. Self-shot, mirror shot, self portrait. Fishing for compliments. Subsequently, the whole culture was infected with this narcissistic tendency, including myself, and the toxic transactional posting of Instagram is the result.\n\nSo Glass is looking to detox photography by not having a Like button, fair enough. The thing is though, that it took very little time for me to realise that I didn’t want to be followed by complete strangers, and I didn’t want to follow them back. I don’t want comments from strangers on my photos, and I don’t want to post comments. In other words, while I still enjoy posting pics online (using Twitter, or this blog), the idea of starting all over again with a new thing doesn’t appeal.\n\nAs to the app, it’s supposed to be “distraction free”, showing off the photos at their best, and it looks tasteful and all, but… it just felt anodyne and pointless. So, no subscription for me, and I deleted the app.\n\nOne caveat: if my £25 subscription allowed my family to download and use the app without paying any more, then I might have considered keeping it. Then we could all follow each other and see the whole family’s best pics. But in the absence of that, nope. Actually, there’s a gap in the market for families to be able to share photos privately, because Apple Photos sharing is a bit shit, or a bite shite.\n\nBlood on the Tracks: The John Lennon Story (podcast)\n\nJake Brennan made his name with Disgraceland, the trashy true crime/music podcast, and he’s now producing other podcasts for iHeartRadio and Amazon Prime Music. He has a slick presentational style which obviously appeals to a lot of people. His previous season of Blood on the Tracks was about Phil Spector. I listened to half an episode and decided it was too trashy and breathless for my taste.\n\nAnd this is the same, I think. I saw this recommended in the Guardian so I gave it a listen. But it’s trashy tabloidy shit, rehashing the same old Lennon narratives and repeating the same old lies. And I think this is a real shame, when so much great work is being done by independent, fan-driven, well-researched podcasts like AKOM, One Sweet Dream, Nothing is Real, Eggpod etc. Fan-driven but not afraid to be critical, and most importantly, not afraid to challenge the narrative(s). And yet this shitty podsploitation is the one that gets recommended by the Graun and the marketing thrust of iHeartRadio etc.\n\nOne to avoid.\n\nThe Rolling Stones: A Bigger Bang (Live)\n\nThis 2006 free concert in Rio was “seen” by a million and a half people and has now been remastered and released in various formats – in full, as they say. “[T]he whole band in blistering form” claims guitar.com.\n\nWell, maybe. Maybe they were all in blistering form. Jagger was in fine voice, sure, as long as you ignore the fact that he seems to have forgotten the original melodies of all their songs. Fine, yes, Dylan does this. Jagger and Dylan, sure. But to turn the creeping menace of “Midnight Rambler” or “Sympathy for the Devil” into a jolly singalong, I don’t think so. Also, he explores a variety of weird pronunciations: bee-beh (baby); hosses, or was it hasses (horses). And so on, to distracting effect. Keith Richards was in good form, although, as ever, not in good time, apparently in a different time zone to both Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood. Also, guitar sounded a bit out of tune to me at times. And Ronnie? Maybe he was in good form, but as his guitar was mixed several dBs lower than Richards’, I could’t tell. As to Charlie Watts, well. Since nobody was bothering to play in time with each other, you don’t know what to say. But he does come in and drown out the bongoes (?) on “Sympathy for the Devil”.\n\nKeith seemed to be snatching at riffs, Ronnie was playing a different song, Mick was reciting the words with a mere glance at the tunes. I’ve always thought the Stones were awful live. Sure, they generate excitement, but they play so badly. A lot of these songs deserve better. “It’s Only Rock ‘n’ Roll” needs to be played with a louche swagger, as does “Tumbling Dice”; “Honky Tonk Women” needs some attack; and “I Can’t Get No Satisfaction” does not need any extra notes in its riff, for fuck’s sake.\n\nGot this because it was recommended by my sister, who said it was the scariest book she’d ever read.\n\nI’d never heard of this Icelandic novel, translated into English by Philip Roughton, but having just been in Norway for a gothic ghostier, I was in the mood to give this a try. There’s a film of it, too, which is on Amazon Prime, I think.\n\nWhereas Dark Matter was set in a fictive location on Spitsbergen, I Remember You is set in the abandoned village of Hesteyri, and it’s nearest inhabited settlement, Ísafjörður, both in the far northwest of Iceland. You can look up Hesteyri and see photos of the scattered houses, the abandoned mackerel processing plant (and former whaling station), and the old Doctor’s House, which acts as a guest house and café in the short summer season, when people visit the area for hiking holidays and murder ghosts.\n\n“Scariest book I’ve ever read” sets up quite a challenge, and the recent benchmark for me (as mentioned a few days back) is Pine by Francine Toon, which grabbed me – in one scene in particular – and made horripilation happen all over my body.\n\nI Remember You is a bit of a generic title, and I was convinced it was a case of a British publisher picking one out of a hat rather than using the original Icelandic title. But I was wrong. Ég man þig means “I Remember You” apparently, although translating that back into Icelandic (using Google) renders it as ég man eftir þér, so there’s that. It’s a thorn (þ) not a P, so it sounds more like “thig”. Anyway, my complaint here is that I don’t think it’s a good title, so it might as well have been picked out of a hat.\n\nThere are two narratives. One is set in Hesteyri and concerns three thirtysomethings who have acquired an abandoned property and have plans to renovate it and then rent it out during the summer. The other is set in Ísafjörður and concerns a hospital doctor/psychologist who is asked to help the local police with a disturbing case of vandalism at the local pre-school.\n\nThe reader knows that these two threads will eventually twine together, but the question is how, why, and when.\n\nThe three young people in Hesteyri are hopeless, clearly unprepared, out of their depth, and without the first clue as to what needs doing in the house. They’re dropped on the jetty by a boatman who promises to pick them up in a week. But they’ve arrived on this isolated and electricity-free headland (which isn’t an island but might as well be because there are no roads) without so much as a camping lamp or a candle between them. The three are a near-bankrupt married couple and their friend, a young widow whose late husband was the instigator of the scheme. The widow, Líf, is useless from the start, having been very seasick on the way over, and seeming to be both flaky and lazy. The couple, Katrín and Garðar, are tense with each other. Katrín is our viewpoint character, the least enthusiastic of the three, who wants to go home as soon as they arrive and she sees the location for the first time.\n\nMeanwhile, back in civilisation, Freyr the doctor is recently divorced and grieving the loss of his son, who disappeared three years before during a game of hide and seek with his age mates.\n\nSo far so standard, I think. Lost child, check, deserted location, check, vengeful for some reason spirit, check, weird goings on.\n\nHorripilation? Or not? Well. As I started reading, I was aware that there were wheels within wheels here, and that the mechanism of the plot was grinding along, leading up to something. And I inwardly predicted that it would take until about halfway through to kick into gear. And there came a moment, in one of the Hesteyri chapters, when a sense of creeping menace arose and there was some horripilation. I looked down at the bottom right hand corner of my Kindle screen: 50%.\n\nSo yeah, it got me, there, and a little bit later on, but overall I would have to say that, no, this was not the scariest thing I’ve ever read. Being of an analytical frame of mind, I’m interested in why.\n\nNow, this is not to say that I don’t think this is worth reading. If you like this kind of thing, you will “enjoy” it, and your gooseflesh mileage may differ. And we do not live in a universe where you cannot read both this and, say, Pine. You don’t have to choose.\n\nThat said, here are my thoughts. First of all, I was reading this in translation. And I always find, with translated scandi thrillers especially, that there’s a certain flatness to the style. The translator is trying not to get in the way, but I always sense their spectral presence. Take for example, one incident. The word goodbye appears in the house, spelled out with shells on the floor. So I’m thinking, goodbye? In shells? So I look up the Icelandic word for goodbye, which is bless. So it would have been the shorter bless on the floor. But if you reverse translate bless, Google gives you, well, bless. So did the ghost spell goodbye, or did it spell bless? Clearly the translator understood from the context what word to choose, but I was aware that a choice had been made nevertheless.\n\nSo I think translation creates a distance for me that prevents me from fully suspending my disbelief. The other thing, concerning Pine, was that my anxiety was ramped up in that book because there was a living child who was being badly parented. This is a much more effective button to push for me than the dead-or-missing child trope used in I Remember You. Again, your mileage may differ, but my personal anxiety is much higher with bad parenting than it is with the grief of the already-established tragic loss. In other words, Pine primed my emotions for the horripilation far more effectively.\n\nFinally, as the narrative threads and weird goings on begin to come together, I just thought it was all a bit too much, so I was more aware of those plot grinding wheels than I should have been.\n\nA quick palate cleanser after the epic Troubled Blood, and another 99p special. I’m not familiar with Ms Paver’s work, but I am familiar with supernatural scares in an arctic landscape – one of those classic gothic settings. I think Michelle Paver is better known for her YA fiction, which is possibly why this reminded me a little of Alan Garner.\n\nThis is yet another men-without-women narrative, which makes me sigh, but given that it’s at least written by a woman I suppose we can forgive it. It’s better (and shorter) than Dan Simmons’ The Terror, anyway.\n\nFour young men of a certain class are planning a scientific expedition to the island known as Spitsbergen in the Arctic Circle, and they persuade a fifth (not of their class) to join them. Jack Miller is desperate to get out of his current situation and although he has qualms about not fitting in with the upperclassmen, he signs up to be their radio operator.\n\nTheir destination is the (fictive) abandoned mining camp of Gruhuken, and (as you’d expect in a gothic novel), the locals try to persuade them not to go there without saying why. Before they arrive, two of the expedition members are forced to drop out, but the rest press ahead, determined to record a full year of weather data and survive the darkness of the Arctic winter.\n\nThe group doesn’t quite gel. Jack is understandably chippy; Algy is thoughtless, cruel, and annoying; and Gus is caught between the two. Jack harbours what is possibly a secret crush on Gus, but before their Norweigian captain and his crew, who have reluctantly delivered them to Gruhuken, depart, he sees something – or someone – that shouldn’t be there, which he decides to keep to himself instead of sharing.\n\nSo the tone is set. Every man is alone in his own mind, and soon Jack is entirely alone, apart from the (unnecessary) dog team they’ve brought with them.\n\nThe sun dips below the horizon and four months of darkness begins.\n\nThere’s some interesting metalepsis here. The novel begins with a letter written by Algy, then segues into Jack’s journal, and at one point Jack quotes from Gus’ own journal. Frames within frames. And as the reader experiences this mise-en-abîme, whatever it is that is out there in the dark comes closer.\n\nThis is a good read, though not as scary as it wants to be, not Francine Toon hair-on-end chilling. But it’s a good yarn, well researched, with a strong sense of place.\n\nIt being the holidays and my readings being voracious, I downloaded a few samples to my Kindle, including this one. And I started reading the sample… which seemed to be ridiculously long, for a sample.\n\nIt almost felt like I’d downloaded the whole book, but eventually the sample came to an end, and it felt as if I’d read, what, 100 pages? Like a third of a normal length book.\n\nBut then this is Robert Galbraith, J K Rowling in thriller format, and the woman has form when it comes to writing longer and longer books as the series goes on. A few days later, we were in Fnac browsing the small selection of original-language English books they had on display, and there were two copies of Troubled Blood. The huge trade paperback was somewhere around 900 pages, but the regular-sized paperback was over a thousand.\n\nNow, your normal policier comes in at three hundred or so pages, and you might expect to find works of this kind of length in the fantasy or horror genres. Stephen King might write something that’s thriller oriented and about this length, and one of the problems I always have with his books is that they start to feel padded out about halfway through.\n\nSo you might think I’d encounter a similar problem here, in the fifth Cormoran Strike / Robin Ellacott novel: that it would be too long to sustain the mystery/detective angle and would start to feel padded out. In fact, Galbraith does introduce a new element here in the form of an occult angle, a little bit of Crowley, a little bit of Thoth tarot. And of course I felt a little bit seen, because my own most recent novel, The Wake Knot has a little bit of tarot as well.\n\nBut I’m not in the same league, of course, so let’s think about this THOUSAND PAGE novel and ask ourselves, does she pull it off?\n\nOf course she does.\n\nGiven that I’d read the previous four novels, I’m not sure why this one passed me by on publication. There was a bunch of stuff about JKR being cancelled, which I paid scant attention to, but normally I’d have picked this up long before now.\n\nThe premise: visiting relatives in Cornwall, Strike is a approached by a woman who asks him to investigate a cold case – the disappearance, 40 years before, of her mother. This, already, is much better than I was thinking about the third in the series, of which I complained that the case was too personal. If you’re going to write detective fiction, don’t make every case about someone targeting the detectives. It’s the equivalent of the crap science fiction trope of the Earth being threatened.\n\nSo Strike agrees to give it a year, and there is your explanation for why this book is so long. Time takes time. There are other cases on the go, background cases, and we care a little bit about them, but the cold case investigation inevitably moves slowly as they try to trace 40-years-gone witnesses, suspects, and relatives.\n\nMy interest in narrative technique is piqued both by the time-takes-time angle, but also by the inclusion of other genres and forms into the text. There are pages of notebooks, covered in doodles and scribbles. There are witness statements, text messages, quotes from Crowley, all painstakingly pieced together by Strike and Ellacott as they go over the old ground.\n\nGalbraith uses your knowledge of detective and serial killer tropes to lead you along, lines up the witnesses – dead and alive – and suspects, and has the solution hiding in plain sight, the consummate magician of plot and sleight of hand. There’s a serial killer in Broadmoor, a dead detective who had a nervous breakdown, and a husband who – like the antagonist of a famous Australian podcast – conveniently married the much younger nanny who looked after his dead wife’s child.\n\nMost remarkably, it does not drag at any point, never feels padded, and justifies its length in those first hundred pages. The best episode yet.\n\nI was just about sit down and write this when John Harvey’s notes on Nanci Griffith popped up in my Twitter feed. It would have been at John’s house that I first heard Nanci Griffith, in 1989, when I was on a visit to Nottingham. Was it for a reading?\n\nThe album I heard then was Lone Star State of Mind, a fresh addition to the Harvey library, and I liked it a lot – especially the title track. Those were the days when I was new to the New Country scene, and Nanci Griffith opened up a rich new seam for me of literate female singers and songwriters and was the herald of that great era of 90s country, when the women were producing all the best music and Garth Brooks was selling a lot of records – very few of them to me. From Nanci to Patty Loveless, Matraca Berg, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood.\n\nThose were the days when I was going through some changes. Ending a relationship, quitting my job, going to university. That was the night that decided me. That was when I spoke to some lovely girls after the reading and they made me think, where am I ever going to see colours like that? So it was off to night school for me and within a couple of years I was walking those same Nottingham streets and browsing those same Nottingham record stores on a Wednesday afternoon, between the lunchtime beers and the teatime chips.\n\nWhat I loved about Lone Star State of Mind was the beautiful production, every instrument sitting perfectly in the mix, the shimmer of the exciter, the high-strung guitars, the banjos and dobros and fiddles all working together an over the top Griffith’s bright, crystal soprano. That record has always been the benchmark against which I measure the rest.\n\nBut, of course, it would turn out that Griffith’s MCA albums weren’t really her in the sense that they don’t really sound like the artist she became after Late Night Grande Hotel (1991), which I think was the last of hers I bought. I’ve always preferred the commercial sheen of the rockier side of country, and I’m not that into folk music. I’m always listening out for Lone Star State of Mind, and for me Nanci Griffith always seemed a bit too much of a finger-wagger.\n\nIt’s telling that the Apple Music Essentials playlist contains very little that I don’t know. The Essentials algorithm (or person) has chosen the slick sounding commercial stuff, and it’s a fact that Griffith didn’t trouble the US Country charts after Storms (1989). But she was never an artist about platinum records. I think Tift Merritt has followed a similar trajectory, from her very commercial Tambourine through to Stitch of the World which Wikipedia reckons sold 3900 copies in the USA.\n\nListening to that Griffith Essentials playlist wrecked me though. I took me back to the younger man I was, that late-20s career and relationship crisis haver, and the turbulent next few years. Her voice still rings clear, and as I’ve always said about the country genre, it’s timeless really. Things in that genre from 1987 do not sound dated. You can listen to Nanci Griffith forever and she will never grow old.\n\nAnd that’s the other thing, isn’t it. She was only 68 – a a couple of years older than Tom Petty was when he died, and it’s too young. Clearly, there were health problems. Very few musicians retire at 60. And to make it all about me for a second, I do wonder, at the age of 58, what I might do over the next 10 years. And if I knew I only had ten more years, what would I do with them?\n\nI’ve been feeling tired all day, weak legs, stiff all over, aching feet. It’s warm, 29ºC, the kind of muggy heat that makes you feel a bit sick. All of this following a 26km bike ride this morning. I’d wanted to set off early, but insomniac daughter was slow to get going. I offered to go on my own, but she wanted to come, so it was gone 9 o’clock by the time we set off down the hill. And the cool air on the way down, in the shade of the trees, was the last cool air we’d feel – all day, but certainly until the last painful grind up our hill, on wobbly legs and with my right foot burning, as usual.\n\nAnd that’s my limit, an hour or so in the saddle and I’m done, and more or less useless for the rest of the day. Exercise! It’s good for you! It was the kind of ride that has you throwing your bib shorts in the bin as soon as you get undressed for the shower: those are too uncomfortable, you say, slamming the lid of the bin down.\n\nThat being my limit: the weak legs, the burning feet, is why I like to read Tim Moore’s various books of cycling adventure. There was his hilarious Tour de France opus, French Revolutions, and more recently his vintage Giro d’Italia travails, Gironimo! And now comes Vuelta Skelter, his retracing of the route of the 1941 Vuelta d’Espagna on a 40-year-old bike sold by the shop run by that race’s winner, Julián Berrendero.\n\nMoore, as a man of a certain age, makes me feel better about my struggles on the bicycle, because he details his own struggles in such an entertaining way. It’s one of his great gifts as a writer that he can find 300 different ways to detail his pain and exhaustion without boring you. But whereas he is deliriously hungry and puking after 140km over mountains in the Spanish heat, I feel that way after 26km. He achieves feats of endurance that are really quite incredible, especially for a lone cyclist, and his various misadventures in hotels and bars and petrol stations around Spain are all part of the fun. A favourite passage:\n\n…I wobbled into the first petrol station in a state of some disarray. There, in the shadow of a refuelling tractor, I struggled to ingest four bags of cheese puffs. It was all the apologetic attendant could offer me to eat, and as I wanly crunched through smelly handfuls of air and yellow dust, it felt as if the process was expending more calories than it replaced.\n\nMoore’s refusal to take nutrition seriously is very funny, when you consider all the column inches dedicated to gels and electrolytes in the cycling press. He needs around 7000 calories a day, but these take the form of whole bottles of red wine, humungous sandwiches and unappetising chocolate pastries. He does have the odd gel, but what the (all right, this) reader envies is his ability to sit down of an evening and eat two whole pizzas – and still lose about 7 kilos over the 6 weeks of his ride.\n\nAll of this was taking place against the backdrop of the pandemic, as he manages to arrive in Spain and complete his adventure in the brief hiatus between the first and second lockdowns. More seriously, the 1941 Vuelta was only the third in that race’s history, and the first after the devastation of the Spanish Civil War. This lends the book a different tone to the others, as it’s impossible to escape the grim, brutal history of that conflict – especially as the race’s winner spent the previous 18 months in a concentration camp. Only 32 riders started the race, and less than 20 finished, in an era when the race organisers would confiscate drink bottles because of their belief that real athletes didn’t need to hydrate and when half the country was starving.\n\nIt still brings me up short to remember that Spain was a fascist dictatorship well into the 1970s, in the era during which many Brits experienced their first foreign summer holidays. So the darker sections of this book are a stark whiplashy counterpoint to Moore’s usual self-deprecating buffoonery.\n\nHis clothes are dirty, but his hands are clean\n\nAnd you’re the best thing he’s ever seen\n\nSquint sideways at it, and Jamaica Inn is a Western. Translate the characters from the Wild West of England in the early 19th Century to the frontier territory of the United States, twist the wreckers into outlaws who rob trains by blowing up the tracks, and suddenly Daphne Du Maurier is William Goldman and you’re reading Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n\nThis is not my usual fare, and I was really reading it to evaluate it as a potential teaching text. I have to say, I’m probably not the person to be doing this. I don’t really get Gothic literature; I understand that exam boards are obsessed with it for some reason (they’re also obsessed with genre for similarly opaque motives), so we teach it, but… I really don’t get it. It was a dark and stormy night etc. It makes marginal sense to me if ghosts or other supernatural elements are involved, but if it’s just some kind of romantic adventure story featuring unwashed men and plucky heroines, I’m out.\n\nFilthy men with elegant hands… sorry, but you’re weird. Go and watch some porn or something.\n\nPlucky heroine Mary Yellan promises her dying mother that she’ll sell the farm and go and live with her aunt up near Bodmin. I’m a bit hung up on this detail. She sells the farm. So presumably she has some money, but this is never mentioned again, and when she (spoiler alert for a 90-year-old novel) rides off into the sunrise with her filthy man, she doesn’t even take the travelling trunk she arrived at Jamaica Inn with. She doesn’t even go home to pack, just jumps on the cart and leaves everything behind.\n\nAnd the Inn itself is owned by her uncle, and when (spoiler alert for a 90-year-old novel) he and his wife die, presumably the Inn goes to the nearest relative? Except apparently not.\n\nLeaving these minor details of plot logic aside, what we have here is a competently told adventure story about wreckers and smugglers in a Cornwall which is really treated as a separate country, a wild and lawless frontier. It’s on the cusp of being policed and patrolled by proper lawmen, you know, like the guy in the white hat in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, so the way of life is on its way out, and Mary Yellan is here to help it on its way.\n\nThe novel’s opening is laughable in its gothic details. The stormy coach journey, the warnings of fellow travellers not to go to Jamaica Inn, the gloomy, run down atmosphere of the Inn itself. It’s funny because Daphne Du Maurier wrote this after Cold Comfort Farm had been published.\n\nSo the gothic stuff is silly, and I know as an English teacher I’m supposed to point out how the author creates tension with her long descriptions of bleak journeys across the bleak landscape, but I’m really with the kids: she’s generating boredom, really, not tension. Also, two mentions of Brown Willy are a bit of a dealbreaker.\n\nDifficult details: the person with the port wine birthmark is the village idiot. (Spoiler alert for a 90-year-old novel) The freakish albino clergyman in his shovel hat turns out to be the villain all along. This habit of authors to give their villains disabilities, deformities, or genetic anomalies is problematic.\n\nAnyway, it’s all right if you like that kind of thing. It’s gothic but there are no ghosts. It’s a bit silly. Not many teachable moments in it, and… what did she do with her money?\n\nIt was good to pick up a science fiction novel after a series of mystery/thrillers, a refreshing change of pace. The premise of this is that the multiverse is real and that it is possible to travel to different versions of earth — but only if the “you” of the destination world is dead.\n\nThis is a familiar enough premise, treated in a fairly similar way in Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter’s Long Earth series. And it’s a premise with a familiar drawback, which is the scale problem encountered in Bob Shaw’s Orbitsville, Robert Charles Wilson’s Spin, and Larry Niven’s Ringworld: once you have more space than humans would ever need, what do you do with it? In my review of the Baxter/Pratchett series, I wrote:\n\nThe Ringworld, as it turned out, was so big that it couldn’t really be explored. To see all of it, you’d need to travel so fast that you wouldn’t really be able to experience it. Travel slowly enough to explore properly, however, and you end up only seeing a tiny part of it before you die of old age. There was so much room that there was almost no room for conflict.\n\nMicaiah Johnson gets around the issue by creating a claustrophobic world of a far-future walled city and its surrounding wasteland. We don’t get much sense of a global civilisation, and nor do we get any sense of what is happening on all the other earths. There are hints that some have destroyed themselves (allowing their mineral wealth to be extracted), but other than that there’s no clear idea of what the traversers, the travelers between worlds, are really up to. Extracting data, yes, but to what purpose? *Waves hands*\n\nCara is a girl from the wasteland, who has been recruited by a corporation to be a world walker, and she can go to many worlds because, thanks to her precarious lives, she is dead in most of them. If she can last for four more years, she can become a citizen, but four more years might be a tall order, given the risks she takes and the dangers she faces every time she travels.\n\nI like the premise that traveling between worlds causes physical trauma, that it comes with a cost. But in the end, apart from one particular mission, Johnson isn’t really interested in the other earths, and Cara’s daily 9-to-5 job sinks into the background as the politics and personal relationships of the world she lives in come to the fore.\n\nAll of which is fine, but I ended up feeling vaguely dissatisfied because there was a lack of detail in the world, and the lack of a sense of place bothered me. There was a sense that there was a past history of conflict, but that things had settled down into this status quo, with the rich city (arcology?) surrounded by a poisoned land. This started to feel uncomfortably like Ayn Rand, and the technical elite in the city didn’t feel like a club you’d want to be in, while the Mad Max style wastes weren’t attractive either. A dystopia then? Except it was more like family drama and office politics.\n\nAnd then there is the style, which like The Hunger Games is all in the simple present tense, apart from a few flashbacks, which are narrated in the past tense. I don’t mind the use of the simple present to create a sense of excitement and immediacy, but this technique loses its effectiveness quite quickly, and then it becomes 300-odd pages narrated in the present tense for no particular reason. Life in this world seems brutal and nasty, and our protagonist narrator is a survivor, but the parallel worlds trope is underexploited and the background is painted in broad, faint strokes.\n\nCara’s relationship with her mentor Jean and her watcher Dell are interesting, though the former is also underdeveloped. You do root for the spiky relationship between Cara and Dell, exacerbated by the uncomfortable lapses in Cara’s memory that constantly threaten it.\n\nScience fiction seems to be a bit lacklustre at the moment. There are some good things out there, like The Murderbot series, Arkady Martine’s Empire series and Adrian Tchaikovsky’s work, but on the whole the good stuff is overwhelmed by the mediocre. I’ve been struggling through Jonathan Strahan’s Year’s Best Science Fiction collection since January and really struggling to finish it. This never used to happen in the Gardner Dozois heyday.\n\nYes, this was my 8th post in 8 days."
