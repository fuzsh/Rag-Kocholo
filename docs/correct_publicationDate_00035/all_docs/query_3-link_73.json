        "text": "Asimov and Heinlein is an interesting comparison. The Foundation Series was my introductiion to science fiction. I loved Asimov's books, and I thought he had a great sense of humor. He was also noted for numerous nonfiction writings on science, which were very readable and entertaining.\n\nHeinlein, on the other hand, was more involved in hard science fiction early on. Those works were ahead of his time, but would appear dated if read today. Stranger in a Strange Land also broke new ground and introduced a new philosophical bent to his writing that Asimov never got into. However, his later works were all preaching the same ideas, for the most part.\n\nSo I think Asimov's works do hold up better because of his fertile imagination and wonderful sense of humor. Still, Heinlein deserves a lot of credit for his foresight and originality, at least until his later years (he lived longer than Asimov).\n\nI would have to disagree. Simply because Heinlein is a good writer and Asimov is not. He had a lot of ideas and was very prolific, but was not real good at the craft. Asimov's sories all seem the same. I just recently read the Robots of Dawn series and boy were they sad. The writing is stiff, and very limited. In the last book of the series he tried to expand -- it was written later than the rest and book size had grown to about 400 pages, and it was just more stiff stuff, not better stuff.\n\nHeinlein on the other hand could actually write, and the style and content of his books are actually different from book to book. Some may think he is preachy at the end but his stories are always interesting and entertaining and his characters are not wooden.\n\nSome of his concepts are dated, but they reflect our past and so are like distant echoes.\n\nOpinion time, again.\n\nI just re-read The Gods Themselves and enjoyed it as much as I did the first time. So, the Good Doctor holds up for me. I read everything RAH wrote and lost interest in the last two books because I found those books repetitive.\n\nIn my youth, I was introduced to science fiction as the literature of ideas. I still subscribe to that description so that I do not worry overly much about the top 10 story writers or the stories they wrote; I care a lot about the ideas these people write about. Who is better or who is a lesser star is of less importance to me than who made me examine or re-examine what I think and why I think it.\n\nRAH and the Good Doctor both made me look at the things I believed and asked me why I believed them. Then, they gave me food for alternate thought. Good writing tells me what it means to be human but science fiction is the field that consistantly asks me to examine myself, justify myself to myself. I learned more and grew more confident in who I am from reading RAH then from reading Steinbeck and Hemingway. OTH, I probably learned more about the process of living from the latter two.\n\nHeinlein\n\nOn a comparison as prose stylists:\n\n-Heinlein is suprisingly good at times, and Asimov is almost always leaden. No matter what I may think of his ideas or stories, I have to battle through his pedestrian, dull as dust prose. He's not as shockingly bad as VanVogt can be\n\n(and now that I've read a good chunk of his work, I can testify to him often being a ferociously bad writer) -but I find Asimov can't move a story to save his life. Heinlein keeps a nice pace in most of the work that I have read.\n\nHeinlein seems to be more interested in people than Asimov as well. That helps.\n\nIMO, Heinlein over Asimov.\n\nProse craft matters. Especially if the result of your deficiency is that you're dull.\n\nA lot of Asimov's popularity has to do with his success as the celebrity/icon of science fiction. He was the person they trotted out on television when they wanted a SF writer's opinion.Asimov is to science fiction, what Einstein is to theoretical physics. A face.\n\nIf sales are anything to go by, the case in the UK is that it's easier to get hold of (a limited range of) Asimov than it is of Heinlein - which are usually these days only around on import.\n\nHaving said that, I tend to think that Heinlein has more style - certainly a greater range, and a style often repeated by himself, true, but his own - whereas Asimov was more neutral and more one tone - still his own but rarely varied.\n\nHeinlein's style was more opinionated, personable and (especially in his later years) more political and grumpy. Asimov tended to follow the neutral line, expressing scientific ideas in a thoughtful yet less aggressive manner. This meant that the the ideas became more noticeable in the rather downplayed manner - not quite the reserved Britishness of Arthur C Clarke, for example, but not the more flamboyant impact of Heinlein.\n\nCompare Hari Seldon with Jubal for example. One is more adherent to the scientific principle, the other more an opinionated orator. I remember the characters more in Heinlein, the ideas more in Asimov.\n\nPerhaps it is this that has made Asimov more popular today. Because his material was more neutral, it has dated less. He lectures less, prefering the ideas to appear through the work. It may also be that Heinlein tone that has made him less popular today. Though Heinleins characters are more lively they have perhaps dated faster because of their style and manner of speech. Many of Heinlein's characters come straight from the 1950's ideal, which doesn't always sit too well with the 21st century's rolemodels.\n\nAs the posts above have said and I've got to agree - I regularly go back to Heinlein's future history stories as a package, less so The Robot Stories whereas Nightfall is one of the best. I would also put the first three Foundation books up there too, though am more hardpressed to put a Heinlein novel up there quite as high.\n\nBoth have dated - yes, science fiction evolves. But the importance of the two cannot be questioned. In the 1950's and 1960's they were paramount, though very different from each other. It is not unusual even today for some of their work from 50 or so years ago to appear regularly high up in 'best of' lists. They have influenced many a contemporary writer (and reader!) today, even though their style has dated (and in Heinlein's case changed quite a lot). Their sense of wonder has maintained despite the length of time since their publication.\n\nHobbit\n\nI'd have to agree with Ficus and others that Henlein was better at prose style than Asimov. Asimov himself depreciated his crafting ability. But Heinlein was quite capable of being prosaic and plodding in his prose too. It was a good bit of a struggle for me to get through \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,\" and not just for its espoused libertarian philosophy.\n\nWhat Heinlein did that was very important was bring sociological sf to the forefront and really make it a vital part of the genre. His \"Stranger in a Strange Land,\" for instance, brought in a whole new young generation of mainstream readers and opened the way for a lot of new writers to really experiment with political and cultural themes. But that being the case, sociological sf has developed on its own -- it had an explosion of growth in the 1970's and 1980's -- and many writers are going way beyond the themes in Heinlein's work. Essentially, he may not be as popular as he was because there are already other writers, newer and iconic, out there doing the type of stories that he did.\n\nAsimov has also inspired many scientists and writers and remains one of the touchstones of hard sf. While other writers have picked up hard sf ideas and run with them, I can't really think of any other sf writer who's touched on many of the most influential ideas he came up with. He sort of stands out, possible prose deficiencies aside. And I think the re-emergence of hard sf in popularity in the 1990's and today probably helps keep him popular now, as has the recent movie \"I, Robot\" which attracted some new fans and encouraged publishers to reissue his works.\n\nBack in the seventies, there were the five grand lions, the five shining stars -- Asimov, Heinlein, Bradbury, Clarke and LeGuin. I think there still are those five. They may go in and out of focus at times, but they still shine brightly.\n\nIMO, Asimov was trotted onto TV to explain sicence to us masses not because he wrote SF but because he was the greatest explicator of his or any other age. Any man that can produce more than 200 books covering the wide variety of topics that he did deserves a pedestal of some size.\n\nBack on topic, I'm not certain what the complaint is. The original Foundation cycle was as good as story as any I've ever read. I cared about the people and the events and I was as amazed, amused, and FOMCLAO when I discovered why the villain of Foundation and Empire was the Mule. That was as funny as anything RAH ever wrote.\n\nDifferent writers have different writing styles. Some you like; some you don't. I, personally, cannot read more than one of Shakespeare's plays at a time because I do not understand every historical reference, or every Old Englishe word that slips through the grill. But, I learn something about being human every play I read. That remains true for me for all of KatG's Big Five. I always find out something new about myself when I read them.\n\nI think this fascination with lists of who is better or who is worse is symptomatic of the sound bite generation. It seems people don't want to waste time finding for themselves what works and what doesn't so they are constantly researching lists to provide answers. Look at Amazon; it's an endless list of lists.\n\nI have favorite authors who never make the lists and I read them anyway because they work for me. I would not have discovered them if I had worked from someone else's lists. It doesn't matter to me that Gibson is at the top of a lot of lists. I don't enjoy his work so I don't read it. I enjoy both Heinlein and Asimov, so I read them."
