        "text": "A couple of months ago, I was in Midway Books in St. Paul, MN, one of my favorite bookstores. I used to go there about once a month. After moving, I now get there about twice a year.\n\nOn the way out, my wife pointed out this book. Taking a look at the index and description, I immediately added it to the pile to purchase.\n\nI have an interest in the history of the American West, particularly Deadwood, a town I grew up near. I went to school in Deadwood and worked there. I’ve seen the Deadwood stage. (It used to be taken out every year in early August for the Days of ’76 celebration and is in a museum there.)\n\nBut there’s an also an element of guilt in my picking this up.\n\nWhen I was a schoolboy, I wrote a prize-winning essay sponsored by the Lawrence County Historical Society. It was about the robbery of a “treasure coach” which transported gold from the Black Hills of Dakota Territory to Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory. The guilt comes in because I used some dubious sources. (In my defense, I did, as I recall, actually go to the trouble of looking at some old newspaper stories on microfiche.)\n\nReview: Assault on the Deadwood Stage: Road Agents and Shotgun Messengers, Robert K. DeArment, 2011.\n\nOur story (if not DeArment’s book) opens on March 25, 1877 with a shotgun blast to the chest of Deadwood stage driver Johnny Slaughter delivered, witnesses said, almost simultaneous with the command to halt the stage. The shot was fired by “Reddy” McKinnie, a trigger-happy member of the Saul Bass gang who, up from Texas, embarked on a short and largely unprofitable career in stage robbery. McKinnie disappeared from history and never did stand trial.\n\nIt was the start of a war between highwaymen and the Cheyenne and Black Hills Stage, Mail, and Express line that was to last through 1878. On August 25, 1876, the first stage made the trip from Cheynne to Deadwood. It took six-and-a-half days though, by February 1877 the trip was shortened to four-and-a-half days.\n\nThere were four ways to reach Deadwood by stage. The Cheyenne company ran routes from Cheyenne and Sidney, Nebraska. Another company ran routes from Bismarck and Pierre, but those routes were never as popular for passengers or transporting gold since Sidney and Cheyenne were both on the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview: Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev with trans. by Philip Redko and Steven Shabad, 2009.\n\nFirst, let’s get some pedantry out of the way. This history mostly covers the span from the early 1930s to the early 1960s. Second, the authors are well aware that there was no Soviet intelligence called the KGB until March 1954, but they use the name as a convenient term for its ten predecessors. The KGB certainly operated in America for as long as the USSR existed, but operating in America became harder in October 1945.\n\nCross-checking sources is even more important when writing espionage history. When using memoirs, there are not only the usual problems of bad memory, egotistical exaggeration of the writer’s importance, minimization of blame, and straight up lying, but governments and spy agencies also have an incentive to misrepresent events. While the famous Mitrokhin Archives (I reviewed its second volume) are smuggled out notes from the KGB archives, it would be nice to actually see the Soviet archives.\n\nThat opportunity arose when the Soviet Union fell and the SVR, the Russian Republic’s successor to the KGB, made an agreement with Crown Publishers to produce books using material from the KGB’s archives – seemingly because Russia wanted money for its intelligence officer’s pensions. Only four books resulted (I read and reviewed one of them, Deadly Illusions). Crown Publishers ran out of money. Communists and nationalists in Russia weren’t pleased by the project. Vassiliev, an ex-KGB officer and a journalist fluent in English, worked with Allen Weinstein on another of the four books, The Haunted Wood, but feared an Communist victory in upcoming elections. Thinking he might be jailed if that happened, he gave his notebooks from his work on the archives to some friends and emigrated to England with his wife. He sent for the notebooks later.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAnd we continue with the Joe Haldeman series, in this an anthology he appeared in.\n\nRaw Feed (2001): Space Soldiers, eds. Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois, 2001.\n\n“Preface“, Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois — A perfunctory introduction to the anthology and the general theme of combat in space.\n\n“The Gardens of Saturn“, Paul J. McAuley — This is another of McAuley’s Quite War series (so-called because the conflict between Outer System colonists and the Three Powers Alliance of Earth is less overt warfare and more sabotage, espionage, and propaganda). It’s not totally clear if it takes place before or after McAuley’s “Reef”. The evidence seems to be before. The scientist Sri Hong-Owen is rumored to have set up an illegal experiment in accelerated evolution in the Kuiper Belt for the Democratic Union of China. That experiment sounds an awful lot like the site explored in “Reef”; Hong-Owen is not mentioned in that story, but, of course, the events of that story confirm rumors of such an experiment. This story seems to take place at least 17 years after the end of the Quite War. The events of “Reef” take place more than 45 years after the end of the Quite War. Just as “Reef” involves the unpleasant social controls and milieu its contract scientists must work under, this story also, ultimately, revolves around issues of social control and, like “Reef”, evolution. At first, though, it has the flavor of film noir with its good-natured protagonist (if amnesiac after being extensively rebuilt), veteran Baker meeting the attractive, but down-and-out fellow veteran, Colonel Vera Flamillion Jackson. But she turns out to have a darker past than we first think. Not only is she a prostitute to the remittance man son of Hong-Owen, a very obese and rather simple man, but she has also been a convict. Like the femme fatales of film noir, she proposes a criminal scheme: a reverse kidnapping of her charge, Berry, and bringing him back to Hong-Owen’s base on an asteroid orbiting Saturn. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Baker doesn’t really trust Jackson. He also refuses, during sex, to link his updated neural system (updated after he was recovered from drifting 15 years after an incident in the Quiet War) to hers. Baker looks upon Jackson as a pathetic individual who refuses to see the necessity to evolve by having her body further modified. When encountering Hong-Owen, Jackson’s plans fall apart, and she is killed. It is revealed that Hong-Owen is engineering people and herself to be something new in evolution: a consciousness that remains, surviving in various bodies including the mold-like being she has become that is filling the asteroid Epimetheus. Hong-Owen’s “clade” will remake themselves into a thousand forms to inhabit many environmental niches. Eventually, (recapitulating the theme of exploitation in “Reef”), Baker is forcibly given an implant by the clade which renders him a member, in a different form, of the clade but still absolutely loyal to it and Hong-Owen’s son, Berry. As the clade says, “Evolution is cruel” and that seems the theme of this story. The nagging “sidekick” personality and control system planted in Baker by his collective becomes much more controlling when the clade modifies it.\n\n“Soldiers Home“, William Barton — Barton is a poet of despair. In fact, at one point, the narrator even describes a scene and says “They write poems about this stuff.” This seems, given the mention of allomorph and the ARM Corporation, to be set in the same universe as Barton’s “Heart of Glass” and When We Were Real though it seems set later than those works since the narrator seems to be one of the last humans left after most were killed after being drafted by the Spinfellows for their war against the Starfish. The narrator returns to a deserted (because all the humans are dead) space colony to seemingly commit suicide. He finds a world inhabited by intelligent tools, mostly weapons from the war — zeppelin-like sharks, intelligent tanks, allomorphs (engineered female surrogates whose sexual services, presence, and conversation were designed to be therapeutic), and silvergirls (intelligent robots). Like the narrator, heavily engineered to be an artilleryman in the war, they are all tools looking for the peace of death. This is a story of existential angst as the narrator fights one last battle which kills the shark, some of the allomorphs, and the intelligent tank. He finds some sort of peace, as much as possible, with an allomorph whose attentions are simply the result of her programming. The story opens with the narrator saying the stars mean nothing, that they are “heaps of meaningless white light”, “an empty stage where we live and die”. And the story ends, after so many tools have been killed, with the narrator once again expressing the notion that he is doing little more than following pointless programming: “You do what you have to do. Because, sometimes all that’s left is life.” Barton is a master of depressing stories narrated in the first person.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSame story as usual. While I write up new reviews, you get old stuff.\n\nIn this case, Far Horizons was an original anthology of writers setting new stories in their most popular universes. I did not read any of the anthology’s other works.\n\nRaw Feed (2000): “A Separate War”, Joe Haldeman.\n\nHaldeman, in his introductory remarks, sums up this story as a lacuna to his The Forever War. It covers Marygay Potter’s life from the time she is separated from protagonist William Mandella to their reunion at the very end of the novel. The story takes up at the end of the novel’s section entitled “Lieutenant Mandella” and takes place at the same time as the final section, “Major Mandella”. It starts before their final separation.\n\nInterestingly, Potter (who, it must be said, narrates the story in much the same voice as William Mandella but with less black humor) mentions events when she and Mandella went back to Earth. The events she mentions are from Haldeman’s “You Can Never Go Back” which are inconsistent with events in the novel. Plotwise, it’s interesting that Marygay’s homosexual affair with Cat, mentioned in The Forever War sequel, Forever Free, is foreshadowed by watching lesbian sex show on Heaven and her greater comfort with homosexuality than Mandella. Indeed, this story shows that relationship.\n\nIt was also neat to see the encounter of Potter’s troops with Man and Taurans after their peace – ironically there are still casualties when automatic weapons are not shut off in time.\n\nI’ve been in the mood to read some non-fiction.\n\nAnd, really, what could possibly be more in the spirit of Christmas than the Russian Revolution?\n\nPeace! Land! Bread!\n\nAnd this one marks a personal Christmas gift to me since, with this posting, I am caught up on my reviews.\n\nAnd, if you don’t find it too frivolous, I’ve posted a couple of relevant songs at the end.\n\nReview: The Russian Revolution: A New History, Sean McMeekin, 2017.\n\nWith Marxism becoming popular again, McMeekin wanted, with this new history, to remind people the consequences of following ‘armed prophets promising social perfection”. The histography of the Soviet Union heavily concentrates on the Stalin years with the Russian Revolution under covered and often used and abused in political arguments. It wasn’t until Richard Pipes’ The Russian Revolution in 1990 that the men behind the revolution of 1917 were significantly reappraised. McMeekin builds on that by looking at some new material out of Russian archives.\n\nThe result is a highly readable, 352-page history (not including the many useful maps, notes, and index) ideal for those like me who know some parts of the story through documentaries and books touching on it but have never read a full account of it.\n\nIn the introduction and conclusion, McMeekin summarizes the accidental events and spectacularly bad decisions that led to the revolution and made some men famous when they could have died in obscurity.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhile I work on new postings, you get another Raw Feed about a Joe Haldeman work.\n\nRaw Feed (1998): Forever Peace, Joe Haldeman, 1997.\n\nAs Haldeman makes clear in his short author’s note, this book is not a plot sequel to his The Forever War, but it is examination of some of that book’s themes, and I think it draws some of its power through reference to that novel.\n\nBy itself, this book opens strongly. All throughout the book is Haldeman’s terse style which features the verbal hooks of irony, understatement, and a delay in revealing crucial information. He chooses a rather odd combination of first-person narration by Julian Case and third person omniscient narration.\n\nThe novel opens with a depiction of soldierboys, military robots operated remotely, in use. They are operated by “mechanics” “jacked” into them. The jack is a brain implant that allows full remote transmission and reception (though the traffic either way can be filtered) of sensory input as well as controlling the movements of the soldierboys.\n\nThe jacks create a subculture amongst their possessors. In the military, a platoon of soldierboys, during their ten-day tour of duty, has an intimate, gestalt-like connection to one another. Outside the military, people jack into records of other people’s sensory experiences or have sex with fellow jack possessors. There is even a group of ex-mechanics (mostly women – the jacks cannot easily be removed) who hang around as prostitutes hoping to jack with mechanics.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAnd this concludes my look, for now, of the works of S. A. Swiniarski. There are several of his titles I didn’t cover, specifically several of his fantasy titles.\n\nReview: Stranger Inside, Steven Krane, 2003.\n\nThis is something unusual from Swiniarski and something of an experiment. It’s a novel about troubled youths, comic books, a secret CIA mission, and spontaneous human combustion.\n\nTold through four viewpoint characters, we start out with Jimmy Somerset, a troubled youth. He’s been placed in several foster families and plenty of schools. He’s learned to fight for himself from his time in several juvenile detention facilities. But Jimmy has some anger issues, so, when the star quarterback starts something with him, Jimmy ends it. Or, as Jimmy thinks of it, the Jimmything takes care of it.\n\nBut a straightforward case of self defense – at least that’s what Jimmy remembers – is not supported by witnesses or video, and Jimmy finds himself railroaded into a new government program, TRACE, for troubled youth. Part of the evidence against him is the violent comic book he draws featuring Cain (yes, it seems to be Cain from the Bible), trying to get in good with God after several thousands of years and frequently battling the demon Baphomet.\n\nThen there’s Nate Adriano, an independent computer forensic consultant who has become obsessed with the mystery of nineteen teenagers who spontaneously combusted. To pursue his investigation, he uses his law enforcement contacts and impersonates CDC officials, doctors, and even FBI agents.\n\nContinue reading →"
