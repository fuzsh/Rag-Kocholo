        "text": "I’ve been holding off on writing this editorial largely because I wanted to have more data in hand. I know that sounds ominous, so let me start by saying I can see a path forward, which is an improvement over other points in this year.\n\nIt’s no secret that the last couple of years have been challenging. Between “AI”-generated nonsense spamming the submissions pile, Amazon wiping out thousands of subscriptions in a single day, and a million other much smaller things, I’ve frequently found myself throwing my hands in the air and seriously reconsidering my career choices. It doesn’t last long, but it’s been happening more frequently than it should. I’m routinely saved by the positives I find in this work and the people I cross paths with in the process of doing it. Not just my team, but the authors, artists, translators, readers, and even sympathetic strangers who have no idea what we do, but have heard our woes.\n\nLast night, I received a reminder of that support. I became the fourth editor since 1989 to win the Locus Award for Best Editor. If you aren’t familiar with the award, it’s run by Locus Magazine—a monthly genre publishing industry periodical—and voted on by both their subscribers and the public. Previous winners include Gardner Dozois (17), Ellen Datlow (17), and David G. Hartwell (1). It’s somewhat humbling to be in their company and for it to happen this year is particularly meaningful. Thank you to everyone that voted. It’s nice to know that the work we’re doing here is appreciated. It helps more than you probably know.\n\nMuch as I’d like to bask in that moment, our problems are still at the door and we don’t have the luxury of waiting until the last minute to bring you up to speed. Last year, I said this about entering the Kindle Unlimited program for magazines:\n\n“ . . . I can say that our earnings for the first year will be substantially below what we had been receiving. Critically lower, but it does lower the number of new and recovered subscriptions we’ll need to acquire, so we’re going to give it a chance. At worst, it buys time, but we are also very aware that we are playing with the dog that just bit us. We’re proceeding with caution.”\n\nAt this point, I can say that if we didn’t take them up on their offer, we would have closed sometime in the last year. By holding our nose and working with them, we gained the time we needed to make substantial progress on rebuilding our subscription numbers. We’ve done better than I expected and not as well as I had hoped, but there is light.\n\nOver the last few months, we’ve been in discussions with Amazon. It was promising enough that we agreed to a three-month extension for a painfully smaller amount (which they have not yet paid us). The offered contract for July forward was for an even smaller amount—a tiny fraction of what we once earned from them and well-below the rates we are paid for a similar number of subscribers anywhere else—but we were talking and making progress. Those talks, however, seized-up as new requirements entered the picture. Barring a miracle, we won’t be in the program effective July 1st and, once again, we won’t be able to inform those readers why. There’s always a slim chance we get back in, but it’s no longer something we can count on.\n\nIt’s unlikely that the amount we would have received from continued participation would have been sufficient to close the gap, but it would have helped. Ironically, the same number of subscribers anywhere else, would close it and even provide a small margin of safety. This is not a completely unexpected turn of events. In fact, a few months ago, I referred to a darker editorial that didn’t run. We’ve utilized the intervening time well, however, and that editorial is now committed to the dustbin.\n\nThat said, we are not quite out of the woods. Last month’s editorial focused on marketing—a role we are still trying to fill—was the result of a careful examination of what we’ve been able to achieve over the last year and some of the patterns within our field. We still see it as a viable path forward. We need approximately three hundred and fifty new subscribers to return to the levels we were at when this mess started. That’s the baseline for operating as we have been, which is still well-below the budget required to pay our staff a fair wage.\n\nBut wait, the Amazon money is gone and you’re still below that!\n\nFortunately, there was an overlap between the two subscription programs and we set aside that surplus (and our rainy day fund) for this eventuality. That’s going to cover the gap for several months and each new subscription we pick up in the interim extends it a bit further. All is not lost and we’re far from ready to give up. Exhausted, yes, but still standing and a little more optimistic thanks to all of you.\n\nLast year, I asked for your patience as we ramped up our quest for Amazon subscription independence. I’m just asking for a little more time, and if you’re willing, a little more help. Spread the word and the word for today is “Subscribe.”"
