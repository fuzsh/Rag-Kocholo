        "text": "Author\n\n• Introduction •\n\nRobert Silverberg\n\nIf you last long enough in this business, everything comes around again . . . and again and again. Gardner Dozois and I have known each other for forty years, now, and in the course of that time he has turned his hand, not often but steadily, to the writing of dazzling short stories. When he has enough of them put together to add up to a book-sized collection he collects them, and it seems that the karmic necessities of my life dictate that I will be asked to do an introduction for them. This is my third go-round in the Dozois introduction sweepstakes, and if the fates are kind to us both perhaps it is not yet the last. That his work should be collected and published every decade or so over the span of more than thirty years thus far shows that Gardner Dozois’ short stories can stand the test of time. Even so, most of you know him, still, only as an editor. This new volume provides an occasion, once again, to reintroduce him as a writer, one of the best we have.\n\nMy initiation into the ritual of introducing Dozois short-story collections came in 1977—a geological eon ago, as time is reckoned in science-fiction publishing. A quick demonstration of that point: for nearly twenty years, 1986–2005, Gardner was editor of the top magazine in the field, Asimov’s Science Fiction. During his incumbency he won an astonishing fourteen Hugo awards as Best Editor, a record that has never been matched and very likely never will be. But when Gardner’s first story collection, The Visible Man, was published, Asimov’s, which today seems like such a venerable magazine, was barely an issue or two old, and the Dozois editorship was still nearly a decade in the future, though he was on the masthead of the first issue with the title of associate editor.\n\nThe Visible Man was Gardner’s first published book of fiction, containing a dozen stories that had been written over a period of seven years. Four of those twelve stories—A Dream at Noonday, A Special Kind of Morning, A Kingdom by the Sea, and Chains of the Sea—are back among us this time around, as strong and impressive as they were when first published all those decades ago. (I can testify to that: I was the editor who originally published two of them.)\n\nMost of what I said in my introduction to that initial Dozois collection is still appropriate to a consideration of Gardner’s virtues and achievements as a writer, and I will repeat it here, as I did in my second Dozois introduction, since there’s no reason for rephrasing what was perfectly well stated back then. But two of my statements do require significant updating, and it would be best to deal with those first.\n\nOne had to do with Dozois’ physical appearance. In that 1977 introduction I described my first meeting with him, seven years previously, and spoke of the Gardner Dozois of March 1971, perhaps somewhat unkindly, as a weird-looking apparition. At that time, I said, he was a gaunt young man just under six feet tall with a vast cascade of shoulder-length blond hair of an eerie voluminous sort covering most of his face, a strange bushy beard . . . the glint of inquisitive eyes behind big steel-rimmed glasses, and—am I imagining this?—a bulky and grotesquely dilapidated raccoon coat. I mean, weird, man.\n\nThis description was already somewhat out of date in 1977, for I noted then that he is no longer gaunt, not even remotely, nor was his general appearance quite as weird, although he still affected some quaint elements of hippie garb and a penchant for shagginess.\n\nA further update is needed here. The twenty-first-century version of Gardner not only continues not to be gaunt, but indeed is rather less so than he was even in 1977. Indeed, here in the full maturity of his years—he’s getting to be a senior citizen now, as so many of us who dedicated our youth to science fiction are—he cuts quite a conspicuous figure indeed.\n\nBut hippie garb and shaggy hair are most definitely not his style any more. Perhaps under the influence of Susan Casper, Gardner’s jolly and loving wife of these many years past, he dresses now as modern adults do, even unto a coat and (sometimes) a tie. The effect is magisterial and commanding. Nor is he an uncouth, hairy, hippified being these days. He had his beard and hair trimmed quite neatly and expertly somewhere back in the 1980s, so I believe, has he has had it done again with fair frequency since then. From humble beginnings he has become the very model of sartorial elegance in our field, a man to study and emulate.\n\nThe other aspect of my 1977 introduction that needs emendation now is the statement that because he produces his fiction so painfully and slowly, he does a little editing on the side in order to help make ends meet. I observed then that he was dabbling in anthology-making and also serving as first reader for the newly established Isaac Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine.\n\nOf course Gardner’s editorial career can no longer be dismissed as a little something that he does on the side. His two decades in charge of Asimov’s established him forever as one of the great magazine editors of science fiction’s history, a major shaper of modern sf fully worthy of being classed with those three titans of earlier years, John Campbell, Horace Gold, and Anthony Boucher. Not content with that task alone, he has produced since 1984 the monumental annual anthology called The Year’s Best Science Fiction, which is in its third decade now and constitutes in its many-volumed totality the definitive archive of the contemporary science-fiction story. And he has done dozens of stand-alone anthologies besides, comprising an awesome list that each year is extended by another impressive volume or three.\n\nBut, as I said in my second Dozois introduction (to the 1992 collection Geodesic Dreams, from which Dinner Party, Disciples, Morning Child, and The Peacemaker are carried over), it is Gardner the writer with whom we are concerned here; and if writing has taken second place to editing in his career over the thirty-four years since his first short story collection appeared, that does not mean that writing is in any way a secondary sort of activity for him. Editing a monthly magazine that receives scores of submissions from hopeful writers every week was, of course, a time-consuming job; but I think that even if Dozois had not been for so many years the editor of Asimov’s he would have produced a fictional oeuvre not very much more extensive than the one he has given us. He is simply not a prolific writer. His stories are carefully considered and elegantly wrought, sentence by sentence: a thankless job, some might say, in a field where for the most part basic story-telling has always been valued more highly than literary craftsmanship. But he has no choice but to work the way he does, and those of us who are sensitive to the values of Dozois’ fiction are much the richer for it.\n\nNot that Dozois the writer has gone unrewarded. His first published story, The Empty Man, was a nominee in 1966 for the award that science-fiction writers annually give their peers: the Nebula. Nearly every year thereafter, all through the 1970s and early 1980s, his stories were prominent features of the Nebula ballot. The Visible Man was a contender in 1975; Strangers, his first and, I think, only science-fiction novel, was nominated in l978; Disciples was a nominee in 1981; and so forth. His stories had regularly been reaching the ballot for the Hugo (the award given by readers) also; A Special Kind of Morning was a nominee in 1972; A Kingdom by the Sea made the ballot in 1973; the novella Chains of the Sea was on the ballot in 1974; Strangers in its original shorter form had been a nominee in 1975. By 1982, Dozois had achieved enough nominations (without winning any awards) to place him second in the roster of the most consistent Hugo and Nebula award losers in Mike Ashley’s statistical compilation, The Illustrated Book of Science Fiction Lists: Dozois had collected four Hugo nominations and six Nebula nominations, but no trophies.\n\nThen things changed, though. His story The Peacemaker won the Nebula in 1983 as Best Short Story, and the following year Dozois picked up a second Nebula in that category for Morning Child. Only the Hugo for fiction has continued to elude him; the preferences of the Hugo voters are weighted, usually, toward basic storytelling qualities, and it is the common fate of s-f writers whose great strength is stylistic to receive frequent nominations but few awards.\n\nNot that Dozois is merely a stylist. His fiction, as you will see, is passionate, powerfully committed stuff. But he deals in deep and eternal matters of the human heart, and in the complexities and disappointments of life in a human society. You will see that here in the older stories brought forward from those first two collections, and in the more recent ones—Community, When the Great Days Came, Fairy Tale, and the others that have been added to make up this volume.\n\nThis is what I had to say in 1977 about the particular qualities of Dozois’ fiction that I think are most worthy of praise, and which still, I think, provides the best summation of my feelings about it. Let us consider this paragraph from one of his earliest stories, written when he was scarcely old enough to vote:\n\nDid y’ever hear the one about the old man and the sea? Halt a minute, lordling; stop and listen. It’s a fine story, full of balance and point and social pith; short and direct. It’s not mine. Mine are long and rambling and parenthetical and they corrode the moral fiber right out of a man. Come to think, I won’t tell you that one after all. A man of my age has a right to prefer his own material, and let the critics be damned. I’ve a prejudice now for webs of my own weaving.\n\nAllow me to invite your attention to the rhythms of the prose, the balancing of clauses, the use of alliteration, metaphor, and irony, the tough, elegant sinews of the vocabulary. It is a paragraph of splendid construction, a specimen of prose that shows honorable descent from Chaucer and Shakespeare, Pope and Dryden, Defoe and Dickens, the prose of a man who knows what he wants to say and says it eloquently and effectively. It is the opening paragraph of A Special Kind of Morning, which Dozois wrote in 1970 and which I occupied, not by any accident, the lead position and place of honor in the first number of New Dimensions, the anthology series that I was editing in that era. Many science-fiction writers, including a lot of the great ones, are content to be mere storytellers, using whatever assemblages of words may be handy to convey their meanings.\n\nDozois is a storyteller too, and no mere one, either—A Special Kind of Morning is a vigorous and violent tale of war with a structural underpinning worthy of Sophocles—but he is concerned as much with the way he tells his stories as with the events he is describing.\n\nOr here, this paragraph from Chains of the Sea:\n\nOne day the aliens landed, just as everyone always said they would. They fell out of a guileless blue sky and into the middle of a clear, cold November day, four of them, four alien ships drifting down like the snow that had been threatening to fall all week. America was just shouldering its way into daylight as they made planetfall, so they landed there: one in the Delaware Valley, about fifteen miles north of Philadelphia, one in Ohio, one in a desolate region of Colorado, and one—for whatever reason—in a cane field outside of Caracas, Venezuela. To those who actually saw them come down, the ships seemed to fall rather than to descend under any intelligent control: a black nailhead suddenly tacked to the sky, coming all at once from nowhere, with no transition, like a Fortean rock squeezed from a high appearing-point, hanging way up there and winking intolerably bright in the sunlight; and then gravity takes hold of it, visibly, and it begins to fall, far away and dream-slow at first, swelling larger, growing huge, unbelievably big, a mountain hurled at the earth, falling with terrifying speed, rolling in the air, tumbling end over end, overhead, coming down—and then it is sitting peacefully on the ground; it has not crashed, and although it didn’t slow and it didn’t stop, there it is, and not even a snowflake could have settled onto the frozen mud more lightly.\n\nProse, yes. Actual prose. America is shouldering its way into daylight. The alien spaceship descends like a black nailhead suddenly tacked to the sky. The sense of invasion is conveyed through an accretion of concrete detail, of vivid and immediate simile and metaphor and physical description. Melville understood these things, and Joyce, and Faulkner. So did Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, and in our own field Theodore Sturgeon and Cyril Kornbluth and Henry Kuttner. The power of that passage depends on a respect for language and grammar, a sense of the structure of the sentence and the paragraph, and a keen perception of sensory data. Gardner Dozois is as skilled a worker in prose as there is in science fiction. His marvelous ear and eye provide much, though not all, of the explanation of his success as an editor; and these stories collected here will tell you how considerable a writer he has been over the past three and a half decades as well.\n\nThe name, by the way, is pronounced Do-zwah. It’s French-Canadian in origin. Most of the readers of the 1977 collection needed to be told that. Today, I think, the name of this writer is more familiar to us. May his acclaim continue to grow for years to come.\n\n—Robert Silverberg\n\nFebruary, 2011\n\n• Counterfactual •\n\nIf we reach the Blue Ridge Mountains, we can hold out for twenty years.\n\n—General Robert E. Lee\n\nCliff’s fountain pen rolled across the pull-out writing shelf again, and he sighed and reached out to grab it before it tumbled to the floor. The small inkbottle kept marching down the shelf too, juddering with each vibration of the car.\n\nWriting on a train wasn’t easy, especially on a line where the rail-bed had been insufficiently maintained for decades. Even forming legible words was a challenge, with the jarring of the undercarriage or a sudden jerk all too likely to turn a letter into an indecipherable splat or to produce a startled, rising line across the page, as if the ink were trying to escape the mundane limitations of the paper.\n\nScenery was a distraction too. Cliff had always loved landscapes, and he had to wage a constant battle against the urge to just sit there and look out the window, where, at the moment, pale armies of fir trees were sliding slowly by, while the sky guttered toward a winter dusk in washes of plum and ash and sullen red. But he’d be sharing this room tonight with three other reporters, which meant lights-out early and a night wasted listening to them fart and snore, so if he was going to get any writing done on the new Counterfactual he was working on for McClure’s, it’d better be now, while his roommates were down in the bar with the rest of the boys.\n\nCliff opened his notebook, smoothed it, and bent over the page:\n\nGeneral Robert E. Lee put his hands on the small of his back and stretched, trying to shake some of the tension out of his aching spine. He had never been so tired, feeling every one of his fifty-eight years sitting on his shoulders like bars of lead.\n\nFor days, days that had stretched into a unending nightmare of pain and fatigue, he had struggled to stay awake, to stay erect in the saddle, as they executed a fighting retreat from the trenches and earthworks of Petersburg westward along the Appomattox River toward Lynchburg, Grant’s Army of the James, which outnumbered his own forces four to one, snapping at their heels every step of the way. Thousands of his men had died along the way, and Lee almost envied the fallen—at least they could stop. But Lee couldn’t stop. He knew that all eyes were on him, that it was up to him to put on a show of being indefatigable and imperturbable, tall in the saddle, regal, calm, and totally in command. His example and the pride it inspired, and the love and respect the men felt for him, was all that was keeping his ragged and starving army going. No matter how exhausted he was, no matter how bleak and defeated were his inner thoughts, no matter how hopeless he knew his position to be, no matter how much his chest ached (as it had been aching increasingly for days), he couldn’t let it show.\n\nThey had stopped for the night in the woods near Appomattox Court House, too tired to even pitch tents. There had been almost nothing to eat, even for the staff officers. Now his staff huddled close to him in the darkness, as if they depended on him for light and warmth as much or more than the low-burning bivouac fire, ragged, worn-out men in tattered uniforms, sprawled on blankets spread on the grass or sitting on saddles thrown over tree-stumps, without even chairs or camp-stools anymore. Lee could see their eyes, gleaming wetly in the firelight, as well as feel them. Every eye was on him still.\n\nThe barking of rifles had started up again from General Gordon’s rear-guard on the road behind them when the courier arrived. He was thin as a skeleton, like Death himself come to call. He saluted and handed Lee a sealed communiqué. Sir, from General Grant.\n\nLee held the note warily, as if it was a snake. He knew what it was: another message from General Grant, politely suggesting that he surrender his army.\n\nThe question was, what was he going to say in return?\n\nThe car jolted, shuddered, and jerked again while momentum equalized itself along the length of the train, and Cliff lifted his pen from the paper, waiting for the ride to steady again. What was he going to say in return? That was the problem.\n\nHe had an arresting central image, one that had come to him whole: Robert F. Lee surrendering the Army of Northern Virginia to General Ulysses S. Grant, the soldiers lined up somberly along a country road, heads down, some of the Confederates openly in tears, Lee handing his sword to Grant while a light rain fell, both men looking solemn and grim . . . How to justify it, though? Counterfactuals had become increasingly popular in recent years—perhaps because the public had been denied the opportunity to play soldier during the Great War—until now they were now almost respectable as pulp stories went, and you could make decent money selling them. But in writing Counterfactuals, you had to provide some kind of tipping-point, some event that would have changed everything that came after—and it had to be at least superficially plausible, or the fans, armchair historians all, would tear you to pieces. Having the Confederates win the War was a common enough trope in the genre, and a number of stories had been written about how Lee had won at Gettysburg or had pushed on out of Virginia to attack and burn Washington when he had the chance, forcing capitulation on a terrified Union, but Cliff was after something more subtle—a tale where the Confederates still lost the War, but lost it in a different way, with different consequences as a result. It was hard to see what would have motivated Lee to surrender, though. True, he was nearly at the end of his rope, his men exhausted and starving, being closely harried by Union forces who were chasing him relentlessly West —but in the real world, none of that had brought him to the point of seriously contemplating surrender. In fact, it was at that very point when he’d said that he was determined to fight to the last, and told his officers and men that We must all determine to die at our posts. Didn’t sound much like somebody who was ready to throw in the towel.\n\nThen, just when things looked blackest, he had narrowly avoided a closing Union trap by breaking past Phil Sheridan at Appomattox Court House, and kept on going until he reached the Blue Ridge Mountains, there to break his army up into smaller units that melted into the wilderness, setting the stage for decades of bitterly fought guerilla war, a war of terror and ambush that was still smoldering to this day. It was hard to see what would have made Lee surrender, when he didn’t contemplate it even in the hour of his most extreme need. Especially as he knew that he could expect few compromises in the matter of surrender and little or no mercy from the implacable President Johnson . . .\n\nHe was spinning his wheels. Time for a drink.\n\nOutside, the sun had finally disappeared below the horizon, leaving only a spreading red bruise behind. The darkening sky was slate-gray now, and hard little flakes of snow were squeezing themselves out of it, like dandruff sprinkled across felt. He hoped that the weather didn’t work itself into a real blizzard, one that might hold them up on the way back. Like everyone else, he wanted to get the ceremony over with and get back home before Christmas—even though all he really had to look forward to was a turkey sandwich at a Horn & Hardart’s and an evening drinking in a journalist’s hangout with many of the same people he was already sharing a train with in the first place.\n\nCliff stored his notebook in his carpetbag, and pushed out into the corridor, which was rocking violently from side-to-side, like a ship in a high sea, as the track-bed roughened. He made his way unsteadily along the corridor, bracing himself against the wall. Freezing needles of winter cold stabbed at him between the cars, and then stale air and the smell of human sweat swallowed him as he crossed into one of the coach cars, which was crowded with passengers, pinch-faced civilians in threadbare clothes, including whole families trying to sleep sitting up in the uncomfortable wooden seats. Babies were crying, women were crooning to them, couples were fighting, someone was playing a Mexican song on a beat-up old guitar, and four Texans in the stereotypical but seemingly obligatory Stetsons—Texans were being seen around more frequently these days, now that relations had been normalized with the Republic of Texas—were playing poker on one of the seats, with onlookers standing in the aisles and whooping with every turn of the cards.\n\nThere were three more coach cars to push your way through, and Cliff was glad to get beyond them into the alcoves between the cars, even though the cold air nipped at him each time. He never had liked noise and crowds, which was one reason why he’d always preferred small towns to the big cities. With things the way the were, though, the big cities like Chicago and Minneapolis were where the work was, and so he had no choice but to live there, as long as the Minneapolis Star paid his bills.\n\nEven out here, between the cars, you could smell the tobacco stink coming from the next compartment, and when he opened the door and stepped into the bar car, tobacco smoke hung in such a thick yellow cloud that you could barely see. Most of the newsmen on the train were in here, standing around the bar or sitting grouped on stools around the little tables. Like Cliff, most of them had shunned the dining car and brought bags of sandwiches from Chicago, to save their meager expense-account money for the bar.\n\nCliff was hailed with the usual derisive, mildly insulting greetings, and two of the boys squeezed apart to make room for him at the bar. He was well-enough liked by the other newsmen, although his hobby of writing Counterfactuals and Westerns, even the occasional Air War or Weird Fantasy, marked him out as a bit strange. Half of these guys probably had an unfinished draft of the Great American Novel stashed away in a drawer somewhere, but in public you were supposed to give lip-service to the idea that to a real newsman, the only kind of writing that mattered was journalism.\n\nHey, Cliff, John said. Finish another masterpiece?\n\nAw, he was probably just jerking-off, Staubach said.\n\nCliff smiled tolerantly and bought a round. He was already several drinks behind. The wunderkind from the Chicago Tribune—he was supposed to be nineteen, but to Cliff it didn’t look like he could be more than thirteen—was trying to get an argument about The Gathering Clouds of War in Europe going with Bill, a big amiable Michigan Swede who rarely paid any attention to anything outside of the box-scores on the sports page, unless it was a racing form. The United States will never get involved in a foreign war, the kid was saying, in his surprisingly deep voice. Bryant kept us out of the Great War, and Hoover will keep us out of this one, too. He was short and pudgy, pasty-faced, with a sullen, cynical, seen-it-all air unusual in one so young. A few of the boys had held the fact that he was a New York Jew against him for awhile, but he was basically good-natured behind his gruff exterior, and smart as a whip, with just the kind of savage black humor that reporters liked, and so most of them had warmed to him.\n\nHe was trying to get a rise out of Bill, who had been incautious enough to express mild Interventionist sentiments a few times in the past, but Bill wasn’t rising to the bait. Guess England and Germany will just have to take care of de Gaulle without our help, Bill said amiably. They’re up to it, I guess.\n\nWe’ve got enough problems of our own without worrying about de Gaulle, John threw in.\n\nFuck DeGauile and the horse he fucking rode in on, Staubach said. Who’s got the cards?\n\nLanguage, gentlemen! old Matthews said sternly. They all jeered at him, but they acquiesced, Staubach rephrasing his question to Okay, who’s got the frigging cards? Although he was as erect and natty as ever, impeccably dressed, looking every inch the distinguished senior correspondent, Matthews had been drinking even harder lately than reporters usually drank, and was already a bit glassy-eyed. The kid was supposed to be his assistant, but everybody knew that he’d been writing his column for him, and doing a better job of it than Matthews ever had.\n\nJohn had the cards, but they had to wait through another couple of rounds for one of the little tables to open up, as the more prosperous passengers, or those who were more finicky about their food, drifted off to the dining car up front. Crowded in here, Cliff commented. Where are all the politicians, though? You’d think they’d be nine-deep around the bar.\n\nAw, they got a bar of their own, coupla cars up, Staubach said.\n\nGot the first three cars, all to themselves, Bill threw in, with a grin. And a sergeant with a carbine on the platform outside, to make sure Lindbergh and the rest of them don’t get bothered by the hoi poloi.\n\nSure, little do they care that the poor bastard has to freeze his nuts off all the way to Montgomery, John said, which drew another admonishment of Language! from Matthews, although, as he was already more than half-fried, it was clear that his heart wasn’t in it anymore. The bartender—who, on a train like this, traveling through the Occupied Territories, was likely to be a soldier in civilian clothes, with a carbine of his own tucked under the bar—grinned at them over Matthews’s head.\n\nAt last a table opened up, and they settled in for their usual nickel-and-dime game of draw. Mathews kept fumbling with his cards, having trouble holding them in a proper fan, forgetting whose bet it was, and changing his mind about how many cards he wanted, and soon was the big loser—as big as it got in this penny ante game, anyway. Every time the kid lost a hand, he would curse with an inventive fluency that was almost Shakespearian, and that kept the rest of them chuckling. Since he never deigned to use the common four-letter words, even Matthews couldn’t really complain, although he grumbled about it. Bill played with his usual quiet competency and was soon ahead, although Cliff managed to hold his own and split a number of pots with him.\n\nAfter about an hour and a half of this, the smoke and the noise, and the fact that Matthews was no longer able to keep from dropping his cards every time he picked them up, and was getting pissy about it, made Cliff deal himself out.\n\nGoing back to the room, he said, \"see if I can get a couple of pages done before the rest of you guys show up.\n\nCan’t keep Wild West Weekly waiting, Bill said.\n\nAw, he’s just going to jerk-off again, Staubach mumbled, peering at his cards.\n\nCliff waved at them and walked away, moving a little more unsteadily than was entirely justified by the lurching of the car. Truth was, left to his own devices, Cliff wasn’t that heavy a drinker—but if you were going to be accepted by the boys, you had to drink with them, and reporters prided themselves on their ability to put it away, another way in which the kid—who seemed to have a hollow trunk, as well as two hollow legs—fit right in in spite of his youth. Cliff could feel that he was at the edge of his ability to toss it back without becoming knee-walking drunk, though, which would lose him respect with the boys, so it was time to call it a night.\n\nThere was snow crusted on the footplates between the cars now, although it didn’t seem to be snowing anymore outside. Cliff decided that he’d better clear his head if he was going to get any writing done, and walked back through the now-darkened coach cars and the sleeping cars to the observation platform on the back of the rear car.\n\nIt was bitterly cold outside, his breath puffing out in tattered plumes, but the snow had stopped, and the black clouds overhead had momentarily parted, revealing the fat pale moon. They were still moving through thick forest, the snow-shrouded ghosts of the trees gleaming like bones in the darkness, but now the ground on one side of the track fell steeply away, opening the world up to space and distance and the dimly perceived black bulks of nearby hills. There was a fast little mountain stream down there, winding along at the bottom of the slope, and in the moonlight he could see the cold white rills it made as it broke around streambed rocks.\n\nThe train slowed while going up the next long incline, and a dark figure broke from the trees, darted forward, and sprang onto the observation platform, grabbing the railing. As Cliff flinched back in shock, the figure threw a leg over the railing and pulled itself up. It paused, sitting on the top rail, one leg over, and looked at Cliff. It was a man, thin, clean-shaven, with a large nose and close-cropped hair bristling across a bullet-head, clutching a bindle in one hand. As Cliff gaped, the man smiled jauntily, said, Evenin’, sport!, and put one finger to his lips in a shushing gesture. Then he swung his other leg over the railing, hopped down to the platform, and sauntered by Cliff, giving him a broad wink as he passed.\n\nUp close, even by moonlight, you could tell that his clothes were patched and much-mended, but they seemed reasonably clean, and although he exuded a brief whiff of sweat and unwashed armpits and sour breath as he passed, it wasn’t too strong or too rank. He couldn’t have been on the bum for too long, Cliff thought, or at least he must have been finding work frequently enough to enable him to keep himself moderately clean. The tramp disappeared into the car without a backwards glance, presumably to lose himself among the coach-class passengers or find a water-closet or a storage cubical to hide in for the night. There were thousands of such ragged men on the road these days, drifting from place to place, looking for work or a handout, especially down here in the Occupied Territories; the economy was bad enough in the States, but down here, whole regions had never really recovered from the War in the first place, the subsequent decades of guerilla war and large-scale terrorism—with whole armies of unreconstructed rebels still on the loose and lurking in the hills, many of them by now composed of the children and grandchildren of the original soldiers—tending to discourage economic growth . . . especially with raiders knocking down new factories or businesses as fast as they sprang up, to discourage collaboration with the occupying forces.\n\nCliff knew that he really should report the tramp to the conductor, but it was difficult to work up enough indignation to bother, and in the end he decided not to even try. It was hard to blame him for wanting to be inside the train, where it was warm, rather than out there in the freezing night.\n\nUp ahead, around a long curve, you could see the engine itself now, puffing out bursts of fire-shot black smoke like some great, stertorously gasping iron beast. The smoke plume wrapped itself back around the observation platform, making him cough and filling his mouth with the ashen taste of cinders, and that, plus the fact that he was beginning to shiver, told him that it was time to go back inside himself. If his head wasn’t clear by now, it wasn’t going to be.\n\nWhen Cliff got back to their compartment, though, it became obvious that it didn’t matter whether his head was clear or not; he wasn’t going to get any more writing done tonight. The conductor had already rearranged the compartment into its sleeping configuration, folding away the benches and lowering two bunks from each opposing wall, one stacked above the other. Somewhat surprisingly, his roommates were already back from the bar. Matthews, in fact, was already soddenly asleep on one of the lower bunks, gurgling and snoring, still fully clothed, although Bill was fussing with him, trying to get him undressed, with little success. Cliff gathered that the old man had passed out in the bar, or come near to it, and his compatriots had hauled him back to the roomette. Even out here, you could smell the booze coming off of him.\n\nWith the bunks folded down, there was hardly space enough for Bill and the kid to stand in the tiny compartment, and Cliff had to hover in the doorway, half out in the corridor, waiting for someone to make room for him. The kid at last got impatient with Bill’s efforts to undress Matthews and bumped him aside, saying harshly Oh, leave the poor old pfumpt alone. With a curious tenderness that belayed the gruffness of his tone, he took off the old man’s shoes and stowed them under his bunk, and loosened his tie. He’ll just have to sleep in his clothes for once like the rest of us, instead of those stupid woolen pajamas.\n\nAs if to demonstrate, Bill climbed into the other bottom bunk—fully dressed except for his shoes; it was a good idea to keep your wallet in your pocket, too, since sneak-thieves were known to riffle through bags left on the floor in a compartment while the occupants slept—and put his hat over his eyes. Cliff slid inside, now that some floor space had opened-up, and closed the door on the corridor.\n\nThey had come down out of the hills by now, and stopped at a tiny station for no readily apparent reason. There was a small town out there, two or three streets of two-story storefronts laid out parallel to the tracks, some dilapidated old wooden houses with big overgrown yards set further back. The storefronts carried faded signs that said things like Hudson’s Hickory House or Brown Furniture Company, but none of them looked like they’d been open for awhile, and several had boarded-up windows. Nothing was moving out there except a dog pissing on a lamp pole.\n\nWhat a dump! the kid said, turning to look at Cliff. Up close like this, he had a habit of partially covering his mouth with his hand when he spoke; he was embarrassed about his teeth, which he never brushed, and were green. No wonder all the colored folks moved up North.\n\nGetting lynched and shot and burned-out by Lee’s Boys probably had something to do with it too, Bill said dryly, lifting his hat for a second. Turn off the light. I want to get some sleep.\n\nThe kid vaulted up into the bunk above Matthews. Cliff took his shoes off, stuffed his carpetbag into his bunk to use as a pillow, shut off the light, and climbed into the other upper in the dark, nearly falling when the car lurched as the train started moving again.\n\nCliff lay awake in the darkness for awhile, feeling oddly apprehensive and jittery for no particular reason he could identify, listening to the snoring and moaning of his roommates. He tried picturing himself back on his grandfather’s hill farm near the confluence of the Wisconsin and the Mississippi, playing fetch with his old buff-colored coon dog, and eventually the steady swaying movement of the car rocked him to sleep.\n\nEven so, he’d wake up for a moment every time the motion of the train changed, slowing down or speeding up with a jerk and a lurch, opening his eyes to see, through the uncurtained top of the window, trees rushing by, the roofs of houses, bright lights on tall poles, more trees, and then his eyes would close, and he’d sleep again, the wailing of the train’s whistle and the rhythmical clatter of its wheels weaving themselves through his dreams.\n\nBy morning, they had outrun the winter. Here, it was still fall, no snow on the ground, browning multi-colored leaves still clinging to the hardwood trees. Further south still, on the Gulf Coast or at least in Florida, it was probably still summer, palm trees swaying in balmy breezes, but they weren’t going that far. This was the last leg of their journey, with only a couple of hours left until they reached Montgomery.\n\nThe room steward brought them a pot of coffee. Sensitized by the kid’s remarks of the previous evening, Cliff noticed that he was a Mediterranean immigrant of some sort—Italian, Greek; recent enough to still have a heavy accent—where before the War, he almost certainly would have been colored. It wasn’t true that there were no colored people left in the Occupied Territories, of course—there were still families holding out here and there. But decades of large-scale terrorism had chased millions of them to the big cities of the North, where they had encountered other problems to replace the ones they’d left behind, and most of the medium-level jobs went to more recent (and reasonably white) immigrants like the room steward. Now the Open Door that had let people like the steward into the country was slamming closed as immigration policies were tightened, leaving millions of European refugees with nowhere to go. As someone whose father had immigrated from Prague only a generation before, Cliff sympathized with all of them, and with the exiled colored folk as well, unwelcome in either the South or North.\n\nBill slipped his shoes on and ducked out to fetch a bunch of doughnuts from the dining car. They ate while taking turns going to the WC at the end of the sleeper for sponge baths and to change into fresh clothes, although old Matthews was so glazed and hung-over that the kid had to guide him there and back, holding him by one arm. Bill teased him about this unmercifully, although he wasn’t quite mean enough to ask the kid if he’d had to help Matthews bathe. He certainly had to help him dress, though, while Bill jeered, and Matthews, lost in his own world, stared at nothing anybody else could see. He clearly didn’t have long to go before he reached the end of his rope, Cliff realized. Odds were that the kid would have his job before then anyway.\n\nOutside, rundown white clapboard houses with incongruously large porches were slipping by, as well as burnt-out factories, cut banks of red clay, goats grazing in hilly yards, an occasional glimpse of a sluggish brown river. For the last half-hour, they crawled by a huge Army base, home of one of the occupying divisions, although little was visible beyond the high walls and barbed wire except the red roofs of the barracks, a water tower, a big industrial crane of some sort. There were guard-towers every few yards, with machine-gun emplacements at the top, giving the whole complex the look of a prison. Scrub woods, weed-overgrown lots, and heaps of rusting scrap metal for the next few minutes, and then the outlying freight yards for the Montgomery station began to roll past.\n\nMontgomery was still a big city for this part of the world. It had been in Yankee hands since the end of the War, and although it had suffered several major raids in subsequent years from unreconstructed Confederate forces, and had been shelled by terrorists more than once, it was still in pretty good shape. There were still a few bombed-out buildings visible in the center of town, but most of them were busily being repaired, and the sounds of construction—hammering, workmen shouting, buzz-saws whining—were a constant here. Outside the train for the first time in more than a day, Cliff wished he’d brought a heavier coat; it wasn’t as cold here as it had been up the track, in the hill country, but it was still brisk, and the pregnant gray clouds that were sliding by overhead promised rain that he hoped would hold off until after the ceremony. The air smelled of dust and ozone.\n\nHe caught a glimpse of the vice president going by, his handsome features looking strained and a bit grim; one of the youngest vice presidents in history, Lindbergh hadn’t been given a lot to do after his charm, good looks, and charisma had helped Herbert Hoover win the election, except to be trotted out on ceremonial occasions like this one that were important but not quite important enough to fetch the president out of the White House. He was accompanied by his son, a somber, silent little boy dressed like a miniature adult in suit and tie, and by the usual crowd of handlers and hangers-on, as well as by John Foster Dulles, Huey Long, Charles Curtis, and the rest of the senatorial party, and their people. All of the dignitaries were hustled into long black limousines and whisked away, the star reporters and big-name columnists—one of whom once would have been Matthews—scurrying after them, off to arrange interviews with local officials and whichever of the senators they could catch before they disappeared into backroom bars somewhere.\n\nAfter the ceremony, there’d be the usual photo-op for clutch-and-grin shots of Lindbergh shaking hands with the outgoing territorial governor, Lindbergh and the pro-tem state governor about to take office, Lindbergh and the mayor, Lindbergh and the mayor’s big-breasted sister, and so on, and then, hopefully before it started pouring, they’d all rush back to the train station to file their stories via telegraph (there were no trunk lines through the Occupied Territories; it was difficult enough to keep the telegraph lines up). They’d all try to come up with some twist or angle on the same dry story, of course (Cliff hoped to get some pithy quotes from Huey Long, who’d been born in the Occupied Territories before moving North, carpetbag in hand, to seek his fortune, and who was a usefully Colorful Character, always good for a line or two of copy), and they they’d all pile back in the train and head back to Chicago, to be off to somewhere else a day or a week later. That was a reporter’s life.\n\nIn the meantime, most of the newsmen crossed the tracks and headed for a café across the street from the station. It was just a dingy old storefront, with cracked and patched windows, the calendars on the walls the only decorations, but it was warm inside and smelled invitingly of cooking food. The pancakes and eggs weren’t bad, either, although it was probably better not to know what animal the bacon had come"
