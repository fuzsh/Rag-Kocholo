It is a long book, coming in at thirteen hundred pages and will probably be one of the longest books you’ve ever read. The novel gives a detailed and fairly historically accurate depiction of Japan in the year 1600. Clavell shows us a culture obsessed with honor and duty while also being brutally violent and cruel.\n\nThe story begins when English privateer John Blackthorne sails into a Japanese harbor with a wounded ship and a starving crew, of which only a few remain alive from their arduous journey across half the world. Blackthorne and crew are taken captive and thrown into a pit, unable to understand the Japanese language or the cruelty of their treatment. What follows is the tale of Blackthorne learning an entirely new culture, language, morality, and way of life. A stranger in a strange land who has no choice but to adapt to their ways, or die. \n\nBlackthorne comes to a Japan that is on the cusp of war and upheaval. He is used as a pawn by the daimyos, the lords of Japan, in their political maneuverings. He gets tortured and abused, tossed about with no control over his life, given great wealth and status, falls in love, and yearns for a time when he can get control over his ship back. \n\nShogun, because of its huge length, takes effort to read, but it is a book that should be read by all adults. It gives a great insight into Japanese culture and history, as well as Spanish and Portuguese colonial history. The story never feels slow and sets a forward pace. There is action, romance, and intrigue. The characters are deep and interesting, some you will come to love and some come to hate. Definitely a recommended read.\".",
