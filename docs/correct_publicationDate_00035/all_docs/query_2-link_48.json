        "text": "The Hugo Awards are the most famous prizes handed out annually at the World Science Fiction Convention… but they are by no means the only ones. The Hugo ceremonies also include the presentation of two “Not A Hugo” awards, the Lodestar for YA novels and the best new writer award (the John W. Campbell Award from 1973 until last month, subsequently renamed). In years past the Big Heart Award (which has undergone quite a bit of renaming itself) and the First Fandom Awards were also presented on Hugo night. In days now long forgotten there was also the Gandalf… and more recently there have been the Retr0-Hugos, though those traditionally have a separate ceremony of their own.\n\nBut the rules also allow each year’s concom to give a special committee award, if they choose to. This year, the Dublin concom chose to… and to my surprise and delight, they gave the award to my wife Parris and myself.\n\nJames Bacon presented the award to us at Dublin’s closing ceremonies. We were deeply touched.\n\nIn the spirit of the Alfies, the trophy is made from an old automobile hood ornament. Though I am damned if I know what model car it came from… it is certainly very different from the sleek 50s rockets and jets that we cannibalize for the Alfies. Makes no matter. It’s cool looking, and we love what it represents.\n\nParris has often told the story of walking into her first con, the 1974 worldcon in Washington DC, and thinking, “At last, I’ve found my people.” I started a few years before her, attending my first cons in 1971, but I had the same feeling.\n\nWe’ve both found a family in fandom, a warm and welcoming community that has become a huge part of our lives. And we both believe in giving back, in paying it forward as RAH once urged us all to do. Also, we’re both descended from Irish immigrants (the Bradys for me, the Moynihans for Parris), so getting this award at an Irish worldcon was especially meaningful.\n\nThanks, James. Thanks, Dublin. Thanks, fandom.\n\nFandom IS a way of life.\n\nCurrent Mood: happy\n\nThe annual presentation of the Hugo Awards is always one of the high points of worldcon. I have been attending the Hugo ceremony since my very first worldcon in 1971. The awards were presented at a dinner back then, and I could not afford a ticket (they were priced outrageously, at something like seven bucks), so I watched the proceedings from a balcony, standing. Robert Silverberg presided, and it was all incredibly exciting.\n\nFast forward to this year’s Hugo Awards in Dublin. They had their own excitements, perhaps more than any year since 2015 in Spokane, the Year of the Puppies (and, more happily, the Alfies). Let’s just say they were… fraught, with some amazing high points and a few low ones. Of course, your view of which points were high and which were low may vary from mine.\n\nThere were many worthy winners, to be sure… and as ever, many losers that were also rocket-worthy. Since I feel more like Thumper than Alice Roosevelt Longworth today, let me focus on my favorite parts.\n\nLike Charles Vess. The artist category had some amazing talents nominated this year, and I was seated right next to one, the incredible John Picacio. But John was applauding just as loudly as me when Vess won for Best Professional Artist. A very well deserved win for an artist not previously honored. And then, just moments later, Charles returned to the stage to collect the Hugo for Best Art Book as well, for his illustrated edition of Ursula K. Le Guin’s Earthsea stories. A double win!!! Lots of people win Hugos every year, but winning two in a single night is a rare accomplishment (I did it myself in 1980, the second person to do so, and it remains one of the high points of my career). And with Charles Vess, it really could not have happened to a nicer guy. I’ve had the pleasure of working with Vess in the past… he illustrated the limited edition of A STORM OF SWORDS… and he really is as sweet, genial, and pleasant as he appears, in addition to being enormously gifted. Nice guys DON’T always finish last, kids. I am hoping to be able to work with Charles Vess again, soon… I have just the project in mind. But we shall see.\n\nI will never be able to work with Gardner Dozois again, sadly… but Gardner’s victory as Best Professional Editor (Short Form) was the other highlight of the evening for me… and for many, many, many others who loved Gardner, had the privilege of being edited by him, or the simple joy of knowing him. I have edited a lot of anthologies of my own over the decades, but I’ve never enjoyed doing any of them so much as I enjoyed the ones I did with Gargy: SONGS OF THE DYING EARTH, WARRIORS, DANGEROUS WOMEN, ROGUES, SONGS OF LOVE & DEATH, DOWN THESE STRANGE STREETS, OLD MARS, OLD VENUS. We wanted to do more, but alas, it was not to be. Gardner left us all too soon, and a lot of laughter and love left the world when he did.\n\nBut on Hugo night, when his name was read out one last time, a bit of it returned, just for a moment. His son Christopher Casper was on hand to accept the award for him… and just as Gargy would have, he said the award really belonged to the writers. Gardner said pretty much the same thing every time he won a Hugo, and he won a lot of them… deservedly.\n\nI am not a believer in any afterlife, and I don’t think that Gardner was either… so as nice as it would be to think that he was looking down on us from the Secret Pro Party in the Sky, I can’t. But the award certainly meant the world to Christopher, to me, to all of Gardner’s other friends, and to the myriads of writers, the generations of writers, who filled the pages of ASIMOV’S during Gardner’s tenure there, who learned from him at Clarion and other workshops, who were fished out of one slush pile or another by the pre-eminent editor of his times (I was one of those). No one knew our genre better, no one discovered more new talent, and no one had a better eye for a good story… or a better sense of how to make a flawed story work… than Gardner Dozois. And no award that was handed out in Dublin last month was more well deserved than Gardner’s last Hugo.\n\nI also want to say a word or two in praise of Michael Scott and Afua Richardson, the hosts and presenters on Hugo night, who kept the ceremony moving at a nice pace under sometimes trying circumstances. Scott was eloquent and informative, and Richardson provided one of the most moving moments of the night when she spoke of the influence that Nichelle Nichols had upon her life and career. Afua also sang beautifully and played the flute.\n\nAll of which was tremendously intimidating. Next year worldcon is in New Zealand and I’m the Toastmaster, so it will be be my task to present the Hugos. Afua is a helluva hard act to follow. You really don’t want to hear me sing. Maybe I should start taking flute lessons….\n\nCurrent Mood: contemplative\n\nAugust went by in a blur, and most of it was spent on the road. London, Dublin, Belfast. Great cities, great times, but it is good to be home in Santa Fe. By the end of any long trip, my green chile addiction kicks in and I need a fix.\n\nI do not travel with a computer, so I returned to the usual one thousand unanswered emails. Thankfully, a lot of them were spam or junk mail, so I was able to get through them quickly.\n\nDublin is a lovely city, and worldcon was fun as always. James Bacon and his team did a smashing job, although the convention facilities were not equal to the size of the crowds, which caused some problems and a lot of lines. I did a couple of signings there, but not a lot of programming. But the two panels I did do, both with Parris, were very special, and I think the audience felt that as well. I do miss some of the pleasures that I used to take for granted at worldcons, like being able to walk the dealer’s room and browse new books, or sit in the bar for hours with friends coming and going and everyone buying rounds… but sadly, none of that seems possible for me any longer. Too many people wanting signatures or selfies. All very nice, most very polite, but I hate refusing anyone, and after a while it just wears me out.\n\nI was able to enjoy more of that at Eurocon/ Titancon the following weekend, in Belfast. A much smaller con in a smaller city, maybe that’s the answer. Peadar and Pat made a great toastmaster team. I had not been to Belfast since we were shooting the GAME OF THRONES pilot, and it was fascinating the extent to which the show has permeated the city. Castle Ward has its own Night’s Watch, the GOT Exhibit down by the Titanic Museum is just stunning… and everywhere I went, strangers came up to thank me for their jobs and tell me how the show has changed the city and their lives. That was very gratifying.\n\nI just hope Brexit does not screw it all up… but I fear it might. Belfast deserves better.\n\nLoved our time in London too.\n\nOh, and everywhere I went they gave me awards. That was also very nice.\n\nI will have more to say about that, and many other things, in subsequent posts. Right now, I am still trying to bounce back from jetlag. Later, friends.\n\nCurrent Mood: tired\n\nMemorial Day started as a day of remembrance, originally for soldiers slain in the Civil War. In more recent decades it has come to mark the beginning a summer, a holiday celebrated in thousands of back yards across the nation with hot dogs and potato salads. In the science fiction community, it has also become a traditional date for conventions, taking advantage of the three-day weekends. There are a dozen or more Memorial Day cons around these days… but some of them go way back.\n\nIt was at one of those conventions that I first met Gardner Dozois: Disclave 1971, in Washington D.C. Gargy (unbeknownest to me at the time) was the assistant editor at GALAXY who had found my story “The Hero” in the slush pile and passed it along to Ejler Jakobsson with a recommendation to buy. That became my first professional sale. A few months later, when I walked into Disclave, the first con I ever attended, Gardner was the first person I met. He was working the registration desk. “Hey,” he said. “I know you. I fished you out of the slush pile.”\n\nHe went on to become one of my oldest and dearest friends. We never lived in the same city, oddly, not even the same time zone… but we hung out together at worldcon every year, and sometimes at other cons as well, we workshopped together, taught together, talked together on the phone and by letter (those papery things we exchanged before email), won awards together, lost awards together, founded the Hugo Losers Party together (Kansas City, 1976), edited books together… and laughed together, that above all. Gardner was a brilliant writer (albeit very very slow — yes, even slower than I am) and one of the greatest editors our genre has ever produced, but he was also a very funny man, a joy to spend time with.\n\nHe died a year ago, on May 27th. To my shock — we had spoken on the phone only three days before, and he was the same old Gardner, full of jokes and plans for what he’d do when he got out of the hospital — and dismay. A year has come and gone, and I still find it hard to accept that I will never see him again, still have days when I think, “I should give Gargy a call, it’s been a while,” before I remember. I fear, given the date of his death, that Memorial Day weekend is always going to be a day of sadness for me from now on. (FWIW, Gardner was also a veteran, having served in the army during the Vietnam era, though in Germany rather than Nam).\n\nSome of you may never have known Gargy, except as a byline on ASIMOV’S and BEST OF THE YEAR and our crossgenre titles, WARRIORS and ROGUES and DANGEROUS WOMEN. Here, to give you a taste of the man, is a YouTube of the panel I did with Gardner and Howard Waldrop a few years ago at Capclave, the D.C. area con that succeeded Disclave after the… ahem… unfortunate incident. There’s no subject for this panel, no big issue to discuss, just three old friends telling stories and having fun.\n\nI love that someone taped it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvdsmhQYTyc\n\nThat’s a great memory for me. But there are so many more. And maybe the best times were back in the 70s, when we were both “Young Turks” (yes, people really called us that) and Rising Stars, just starting out, sleeping on floors and sharing rooms and rides at cons, scrounging meals off editors, with none of us having a pot to piss in.\n\nThose were the days, my friend. We thought they’d never end.\n\nMiss you, Gargy.\n\nCurrent Mood: sad\n\nI was surprised last night when Air New Zealand went to the internet to invite me down for a visit… to help me finish my book.\n\nI cannot say I was not tempted. New Zealand is a beautiful place. As it happens, I have already visited there a number of times. I’ve been to Auckland and Wellington and Christchurch and Rotoroa… and Hobbiton, of course. I’ve gone whale watching (we never saw a whale, but there were hundreds of dusky dolphins), checked out the Te Papa, the Weta Workshop, the aquarium in Auckland, and a cool automobile museum somewhere near Wellington. From Rotoroa I took a helicopter out to White Island, with its boiling mud pools and lovely lake of sulfuric acid. (With Hobbiton and Mordor on the same island, you really ought to change your name to Middle Earth). I’ve been to a few hangis too, and my minions have a video of me attempting to do a haka that they periodically use to blackmail me.\n\nIn short, I love New Zealand. You don’t need to convince me.\n\nAnd as it happens, I already have plans to return. In the summer of 2020, Wellington is hosting the World Science Fiction Convention, the oldest and most important con in the SF/ fantasy calendar, and they’ve asked me to serve as Toastmaster for the Hugo Awards. Writers, fans, and artists from all over the world will be headed down to check out all of your wonders. I hope lots of you Kiwis will join us.\n\nwww.conzealand.nz\n\nOf course, I was especially moved by your offer to bring me to New Zealand “on us.” How wonderfully generous. As it happens, I do have enough money to make it to New Zealand on my own… but there are many American writers, fans, and artists who do not. If you’d care to fly, say, twenty or thirty or fifty of them to Wellington in place of me, I have no doubt they would instantly accept, and fall in love with Middle Earth.. er, New Zealand… just as I have. And you have such big planes, I’m sure you could squeeze them in.\n\nAs for finishing my book… I fear that New Zealand would distract me entirely too much. Best leave me here in Westeros for the nonce. But I tell you this — if I don’t have THE WINDS OF WINTER in hand when I arrive in New Zealand for worldcon, you have here my formal written permission to imprison me in a small cabin on White Island, overlooking that lake of sulfuric acid, until I’m done. Just so long as the acrid fumes do not screw up my old DOS word processor, I’ll be fine.\n\nCurrent Mood: amused\n\nI have seen here and there that some people are suggesting A SONG OF ICE & FIRE (by that name, or as GAME OF THRONES) as a possible nominee for the new(ish) Best Series category of the Hugo Awards. It fits worldcon’s very broad definition of a series, I agree… but as I said below in my post about FIRE & BLOOD, I don’t consider A SONG OF ICE & FIRE a series, and even it was, FIRE & BLOOD is not really part of it. More a Related Work, the category where it fits best.\n\nWILD CARDS, however, IS a series by anyone’s definition, and is definitely eligible for nomination.\n\nAnd for what it is worth, WILD CARDS had a hell of a year in 2018.\n\nWe published not one, not two, but three new original mosaic novels in the series: LOW CHICAGO came out in June and TEXAS HOLD ‘EM in November, both in the US, while KNAVES OVER QUEENS was a June release in the UK. I don’t know any other contending series that put out three new books last year. And while I am admittedly far from objective, those three books rank among the strongest volumes in the history of the series. I am very proud of them, and the fans seemed to love them too.\n\nThat’s not all, however. We re-released one of the old books too: ONE-EYED JACKS, volume eight from the original series, was released in August, after decades of being out of print. But it was not a straight reprint. We also added two brand new stories to the original text, a Magpie story by Kevin Andrew Murphy and a tale of Lady Black from Carrie Vaughn.\n\nIn addition, we had three brand-new stand-alone Wild Cards stories published over on Tor.com:\n\n— “EverNight,” by Victor Milan, published in February,\n\n— “The Flight of Morpho Girl,” by Caroline Spector and Bradley Denton, published in April,\n\n— “Fitting In,” by Max Gladstone, published in November.\n\nThat’s a huge amount of original Wild Cards content. If you haven’t tried any of it, you should. There’s some great stuff there. I am a lucky editor, and I’ve assembled an amazing team of writers in Wild Cards.\n\nAnd 2018 was our thirty-first year. We now have twenty-seven volumes in print, with three more in the pipeline… and probably a lot more to come, especially if the TV shows take off on Hulu. No other series comes close.\n\nI hope the Hugo nominators will agree.\n\nCurrent Mood: hopeful\n\nI had a big new Westeros book published last year (official publication date November 20, 2018) — FIRE & BLOOD, covering the history of the Targaryen kings from Aegon’s Conquest to the regency of Aegon III. It’s been doing rather well, thank you. Debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and is still in the top ten two months later. And just last week, we got a great review in KIRKUS, a notoriously tough journal.\n\nThe question of its Hugo eligibility is… well, trickier than usual.\n\nFIRE & BLOOD is eligible, certainly. But what category does it belong in?\n\nThere’s Best Novel, the “Big One” A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, A FEAST FOR CROWS, and A STORM OF SWORDS were all nominated for the Best Novel Hugo in years past (they all lost, to be sure, but never mind). In all of the promotional interviews I did leading up to the book’s release, however, I took pains to stress that FIRE & BLOOD was not a novel but rather a work of imaginary history (I used to say “fake history,” but some of my readers objected). I did not want anyone buying the book under the misapprehension that it was the latest volume in A SONG OF ICE & FIRE. After saying over and over again “this is not a novel,” it would be rather disingenuous of me to accept a Hugo (should it win, which I must admit is rather unlikely) or even a nomination in the Best Novel category.\n\nAlas, there is no Hugo category for “Best Imaginary History.”\n\nIt has been pointed out to me that the publication of FIRE & BLOOD makes me eligible for nomination in the new (relatively) Best Series category. Well, yes, I suppose. It depends on one’s definition of what constitutes a series. Worldcon’s definition is considerably broader than my own, for what it’s worth. Many SF writers have set their stories against a common background or “future history,” a term originated by Heinlein and popularized by Campbell. My own Thousand Worlds stories fit that template, but I don’t consider them a series. They share a background, but that’s all; except for the Tuf stories, there are no recurring characters, and the tales are set hundreds of years and hundreds of light years apart. (The Haviland Tuf stories, a subset of my Thousand Worlds, ARE a series, as I define the term). At the other extreme, you have what I’ll call “mega-novels,” stories spread across many books because of length. Tolkien’s LORD OF THE RINGS was not a series, as I see it, but one long novel published in three volumes.\n\nThose are my definitions, however. Not worldcon’s. The Hugo rules are much looser, and would seem to include future histories, mega-novels, and true series all in the same Best Series category.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I do not consider A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE to be a series. It’s one story. A huge complicated story, admittedly, one that will take seven volumes to tell (once I finish the last two). And in any case, FIRE & BLOOD is not strictly speaking a part of A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE. It’s imaginary history set hundreds of years before any of the characters in SONG were born. Yes, I suppose if you bundle FIRE & BLOOD, the five ASOI&F novels, and the three Dunk & Eggs novellas (collected as A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS) together, you have a series of sorts. I wouldn’t even know what to call it. The Westeros series? The Seven Kingdoms series? Not GAME OF THRONES or ICE & FIRE, certainly. So…\n\nI don’t know.\n\nSo… if not Best Novel, and not Best Series, where would FIRE & BLOOD fit on the Hugo ballot? If anywhere?\n\nMy suggestion: Best Related Work.\n\nThat seems to be the best description of what the book actually is. It’s an imaginary history, related to five published ICE & FIRE novels, but not a novel and not a part of that story. A WORLD OF ICE & FIRE, the concordance we published several years ago, was its closest precursor. That volume got some nominations in Best Related Work, though it did not come close to making the final five. But there’s a precedent of sorts, so…\n\nIf you read and enjoyed FIRE & BLOOD and would like to nominate it for a Hugo, I would urge you to consider Related Work rather than Novel or Series. (If you haven’t read it yet, hey, you can still get autographed copies from the bookshop at the Jean Cocteau Cinema).\n\nAnd while I am the subject of the Best Related Work Hugo, let me make a recommendation that has nothing whatsoever to do with my own work (though my name is mentioned once, fwiw): ASTOUNDING, by Alec Nevala-Lee, an amazing and engrossing history of John W. Campbell Jr and his authors, Isaac Asimov, L. Ron Hubbard, and Robert A. Heinlein. Insightful, entertaining, and compulsively readable, it brings Campbell and his era back to life. I thought I knew a lot about Astounding, Campbell, and his authors, but Nevala-Lee goes way way deeper than any previous history I’ve read, and his book is full of stuff I never knew. Of course, I’d love to have my own book nominated (I value the Hugo more than any other award), but I suspect that ASTOUNDING will win the rocket in the end. It certainly deserves to.\n\nCurrent Mood: confused\n\nIt’s August, and that means that worldcon is coming around once again. (In a properly ordered universe, worldcon would be coming on Labor Day weekend but sadly that seems to be a lost cause since Dragoncon stole those dates).\n\nThis year’s gathering is in San Jose, California. It ought to be called ConJose II, but it’s not. I like my worldcons to have names, not numbers, however, so I refuse to accede to this new twitch of numbering cons instead of naming them. The SanJose folks keep insisting that this worldcon is not ConJose II, though. So be it. In the tradition of my Not A Blog, and of course the famous John W. Campbell Award (Not A Hugo), I shall henceforth refer to this year’s gathering as Not ConJose II.\n\nI have cut way down on the number of cons I attend, due to the press of work, but there’s no way I’d miss a worldcon, by any name. I’ve only missed one in the last thirty years. Dragoncon and San Diego Comicon and GenCon and many other cons are now much bigger, but worldcon remains the original, and the best, the heart of the fannish community. Worldcon is like a family reunion. And yes, like any large family, we have our share of drunken uncles, loony cousins, and snot-nosed kids… but still, family is family. I’ll be there for the whole con. I hope to see many of you in SanJose. Worldcon is great time for getting together with old friends and making new ones.\n\nI know that some of you will be hoping to get your books autographed at the con. There will be several opportunities for that.\n\nMy week will start on Tuesday, August 14, with a special fundraiser on behalf of LOCUS, an evening with John Picacio. That event is not an actual part of the con, so tickets will be sold separately. I will not be signing at the fundraiser, no… but we will have hundreds of pre-signed books available for purchase at the event.\n\nhttps://foxrwc.showare.com/eventperformances.asp?evt=210\n\nI also have three scheduled signings at Not ConJose II itself. Friday at noon and Sunday at 1pm, I will be signing in the official autograph area. The lines will be capped, however; there’s a limit to how many books I can sign in an hour. (No, my hand doesn’t fall off. It’s my lower back that protests). Sorry, I can’t do personalizations or inscriptions, and we have a limit of one book per person. Mind you, if the lines are short, I will sometimes loosen the rules and sign a second book, etc. Don’t count on that, though; my lines have not been short in years. Oh, and yes, I will sign things other than books. Games, cards, replica swords, photographs, program books, interesting body parts…. but still, only one item per person, and no personalizations. And I don’t sign babies, pets, or books written by other authors.\n\nBesides these two general signings, we also have the Wild Cards signing, scheduled for Saturday morning at 10am in the dealer’s room. That’s a mass signing. Melinda Snodgrass, Caroline Spector, Marko Kloos, Mary Anne Mohanraj, Kevin Andrew Murphy, and several other Wild Cards writers and creators will be joining me, to deface your books with their illegible scrawls. But at that event we will be signing ONLY Wild Cards books, so please don’t bring copies of any of my other works… those you can get signed at the general signings.\n\nI do prefer to limit my autographing to these four scheduled events. I want to enjoy worldcon like everyone else, without having to scrawl my way through it. So please do not approach me before or after panels, at the Hugos, in the corridors, at the parties, while I’m having dinner (or breakfast, or lunch), or in the restrooms to ask for an autograph. Your understanding would be much appreciated.\n\nAside from signing things, what am I doing at Not ConJoseII? you may ask.\n\nAt 5pm on Friday I will be part of the Gardner Dozois Memorial. A sad event, but I think we’ll have some laughs as well. Gardner was the funniest man in our field for half a century, he’d want to hear us laughing.\n\nThere’s also to be a Wild Cards panel, though I am not sure just when. The present time is a conflict for me. Depending on where the panel gets moved, I may or may not be on it. But there will be a Wild Cards panel regardless.\n\nOh, and keep your eyes on Thursday. We’re looking at doing a presentation and trailer screening for the new NIGHTFLYERS television series that debuts this fall. Details are still being worked out When we have more definite news, I will let you know.\n\nAnd that’s it, so far as my public participation in Not ConJoseII is concerned. But of course, I will be there all weekend, wandering the dealer’s room, drinking in the bar, visiting the art show… and, of course, hitting the parties. That’s what worldcon is all about.\n\nCurrent Mood: busy"
