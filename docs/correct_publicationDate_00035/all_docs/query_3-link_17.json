        "text": "Advertisement\n\nJack Vance is now 93 years old, and has retired from writing. He has been celebrated in the SF and Fantasy (and to a lesser extent, Mystery) fields for years. But it seems that his star is again ascending, signaled by such things as an ongoing series of story collections edited by Jonathan Strahan and Terry Dowling, by the publication of his memoirs (simultaneously with this book, and from the same publisher), and even by an admiring profile in the New York Times Magazine this past July. And of course also by this book, a collection of stories set in Vance's most famous milieu, the Dying Earth, by a wide variety of writers, nearly all of whom tell a story of their magical encounter with Vance's fiction at an early age.\n\nVance is a writer whose influence on the field has been quite noticeable. The Dying Earth itself is an obvious inspiration for such a major work as Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun. One might add less significant but still worthwhile work also set in what is either explicitly the Dying Earth (Michael Shea's authorized sequel A Quest for Simbilis) or what seems closely derived from same (Damien Broderick's Sorceror's World). Countless other writers have used similar milieus, some quite openly, as with Matthew Hughes, who explicitly sets his fantasy novels in the age just prior to that of The Dying Earth. (Hughes also has developed a prose style that is clearly Vance-derived -- and, though he does not equal Vance's skill, his work is quite enjoyable.) Indeed, besides Hughes, others of the contributors to this book are Vance's heirs to some degree or another: Robert Silverberg's Majipoor novels are set on a large planet that obviously harkens back to Vance's Big Planet, while Kage Baker's fantasy novels (beginning with The Anvil of the World) have a distinctly Vancean flavor as well.\n\nSongs of the Dying Earth is, first story to last, very enjoyable. However it is never quite brilliant, and I believe that is precisely because the writers are all working in another writer's world. (Not that that is a bar to brilliance -- Orson Scott Card's \"The Originist,\" to name just one example, is a magnificent story set in Isaac Asimov's Foundation future.) Still, this is 600 plus pages of entertaining work... well worth the money.\n\nThere's no point going over all the stories... I'll mention some highlights. Several of the writers seem to be trying to mimic Vance's style to a degree, with varying degrees of success. Perhaps the most interesting of the stories in this vein is one that seems more a blend of the writer's style with Vance's -- Lucius Shepard's \"Sylgarmo's Proclamation,\" perhaps my favorite piece here. I tend to find Shepard's prose a bit overwrought. By contrast, one of the sometimes unappreciated aspects of Vance's writing is that despite its reputation for ornateness, his sentences are clear and crisp, even as the words may be unfamiliar and the tone ironic. To my mind, Shepard, while still writing in his own voice, modulated his style in a Vancean direction in \"Sylgarmo's Proclamation,\" to very good effect. The story itself is fine -- as the Sun appears ready to finally \"quit the sky\" a certain Thiago is approached by certain individuals desiring revenge on Cugel the Clever, and he is induced to guide them to a remote tower to confront the him.\n\nI also greatly enjoyed the longest of these stories, Dan Simmons's \"The Guiding Nose of Ulfänt Banderõz.\" Shrue the Diabolist and a group of travelers (including Derwe Coreme, who appears as well in Shepard's story) try to reunite the title magician's library, which seems to be in two universes -- and in so doing forestall the final expiration of the Sun. A couple of the shorter stories have a different tone -- reflecting their authors more than Vance, while still properly hommages to the master: thus, Howard Waldrop's \"Frogskin Cap,\" which shows us how Tybalt became the last Curator of the Museum of Man, and Neil Gaiman's \"A Question of Incuriosity,\" which intriguingly links our own time with that of the Dying Earth.\n\nOther highlights: Elizabeth Moon's \"An Incident in Uskvesk,\" an entertaining story, sort of a caper piece, about a dwarf and roach racing, of all things. Kage Baker's \"The Green Bird\" is another Cugel story, and very true to the spirit of the originals, as Cugel is shown again to be quite clever, but not as clever as he thinks he is. And finally I'll mention Elizabeth Hand's \"The Return of the Fire Witch,\" in which the title character impugns a fellow witch to help her get even with the royal family that had exiled her.\n\nIt's a big book, and there are many further stories. We meet many of Jack Vance's familiar characters, and many new ones; we revisit many familiar locales, and some new ones, and we encounter again some of Vance's amusing fauna, such as Deodands and Twk people. The stories, as I have said, entertain almost to a one. It might be that leisurely reading is best, as there is some repetition of theme, style, and setting -- but it will be entertaining reading."
