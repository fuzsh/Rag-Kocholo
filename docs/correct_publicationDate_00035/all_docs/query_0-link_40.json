Dozois is perhaps best known for his several years of service at the helm of Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, as well as for the many anthologies of short science fiction which he has edited, alone and with others. He is also a writer, however, and has won the prestigious Nebula Award for his own short science fiction stories, \"The Peacemaker\" and \"Morning Child.\" Dozois wrote a novel, Strangers, which appeared in 1978. According to a writer for the fourth edition of the St. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers, in Strangers, \"Dozois presents Joseph Faber, a human from Earth with an alien lover named Liraun.\" The writer goes on to explain that the couple is \"shunned by the non-human Cian and the human trade community,\" and that \"in this tremendously sad story, Dozois develops the theme of alienation, and the impossibility of ever knowing another person—hence the title Strangers.\" The writer concluded: \"This very moving novel is one of the forgotten and ignored classics of the 1970s.\" Many of Dozois's own short science fiction stories appeared in the 1992 collection Geodesic Dreams. This volume prompted a Publishers Weekly reviewer to label the author and editor \"one of the genre's most exciting writers.\"\n\nDozois has also won many awards for his work as an editor. Alone and with others such as Jack Dann, Mike Resnick, and Sheila Williams, he has edited collections of similarly-themed stories culled from various issues of Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine. These titles include Future Earths: Under South American Skies, which according to a Publishers Weekly critic, \"transports readers to South American latitudes that are as exotic and exciting as the farthest stars\"; and Modern Classics of Fantasy, which prompted Roland Green in Booklist to announce that \"as an introduction to modern American fantasy, this book could hardly be surpassed.\" Though Dozois possesses many editorial credits of this type, he is even more strongly associated with his yearly collections, The Year's Best Science Fiction, which he began editing in 1984. Reviewers of these volumes frequently use superlatives to describe them, and they typically include tales by such science fiction greats as Nancy Kress, Ian R. MacLeod, Ursula K. LeGuin, Ben Bova, and Robert Silverberg, as well as others by rising stars in the genre. As J. Stephen Bolhafner concluded in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, \"There is no one source that will give you as good a feel for the possibilities of the science fiction genre, and how those possibilities were fulfilled last year, than this annual collection.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nSt. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers, 4th edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBooklist, December 1, 1996, Roland Green, review of Modern Classics of Fantasy, p. 643.\n\nLocus, December, 1997, interview with Gardner Dozois; July, 2002, Gary K.
