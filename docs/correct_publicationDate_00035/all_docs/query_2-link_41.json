        "text": "Who Goes There?\n\nJoyce Carol Oates is the kind of author who quite possibly would never have appeared in the genre magazines if not for F&SF, what with its classy exterior and appeal with non-genre writers. Indeed Oates is one of the most celebrated living non-genre writers, having won the National Book Award for her novel them, as well as the O. Henry Award multiple times for her short fiction. More relevant to this blog is that a surprisingly large portion of her output is horror, especially at short length. She’s been nominated for the Bram Stoker Award multiple times and even won the Stoker for her non-supernatural horror novel Zombie. Even perhaps her most controversial novel, Blonde, whilst ostensibly historical fiction, could be classified as horror. She’s one of only two female contributors to the seminal horror anthology Dark Forces. “In Shock” is one of Oates’s horror short stories, and is arguably supernatural, although it doesn’t so much delve into the supernatural as strongly allude to it.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the June 2000 issue of F&SF, which is on the Archive. Despite getting a Stoker nomination, this story doesn’t seem to have been reprinted anywhere, at least if ISFDB is being accurate; with a mostly non-genre author like Oates it can be hard to tell.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nRachael is a divorcee in her mid-thirties who has lost a husband as well as a child. She got married to L_ (we’re only told the first letter of his name, as seems to be the case with all the men in Rachael’s life) and got pregnant when she was about 25, which in those days was not unusual. Unfortunately Rachael miscarried some months into her pregnancy and her relationship with L_ deteriorated—not that their relationship would’ve necessarily worked out had the child lived. Anyway, it’s been about a decade since then and she at least tries to think she’s moved on from all that. “She was a poet and a translator and she traveled a good deal and she’d ceased grieving for what was lost, and irretrievable, as she’d ceased being a woman, a wife, a mother-to-be.” Despite the third-person narration telling us Rachael had moved on, this is pretty obviously not true; if anything her past trauma seems to be the only thing she’s capable of thinking about, if dips into her stream of consciousness are anything to go by. Stream-of-consciousness narration is a pretty unusual technique in the realm of genre fiction, but it’s something Oates has a penchant for; more specifically it very much reads as Modernist in the Faulkner mode, in that we have italicized and unpunctuated bursts of thought that come and go without warning. The result is a bodyless and relatively sober narrator clashing with a delirious internal monologue. Get ready for a lot of sentence fragments.\n\nThis is essentially a story about a woman who’s become trapped in her own past. Rachael’s sense of identity has been stripped by her trauma to the point where she doesn’t even perceive herself as really a woman (a kind of insecurity that’s sadly a real-life phenomenon for women who have had miscarriages), such that her gender becomes almost arbitrary. The irony is that because she has lost so much faith in her value as a woman her gender has become a fixation; she doesn’t believe in her own womanhood, yet can’t stop thinking about it. This all comes to a head when she sees a preteen boy bicycling in the wake of a storm, the boy narrowly avoiding crashing because of tree debris, and she sees the boy about to bike over a pole wire that’s been knocked out, such that if the boy made contact with it he could be electrocuted and killed. Rachael stops this would-be accident, but in the process is electrocuted herself and knocked unconscious. She’s taken to the hospital where she’s told she’s lucky to be in alive, only coming out of it with some bruises and a case of shock. She’s told she had gone into shock, but the symptoms should wear off. Little does she know these symptoms are about to get much worse. The most disconcerting thing is that she asks hospital staff if there was a boy at the scene, only to be told there was no boy and no bike; yet she’s convinced she must’ve seen him. It was such a vivid sight, yet nobody who was around recalls there being a boy.\n\nThere are a few plausible options here, although Oates doesn’t give us an easy answer that would indicate any of them. It’s possible that Rachael had experienced a vivid visual hallucination and had imagined the boy; that the boy is a ghost, maybe even a manifestation of the Rachael’s unborn child (the boy is about as old as the child would’ve been); or that Rachael really did see a boy, save him, but then died in the process, in which case we have a nightmarish afterlife scenario. At the very least the boy is obviously meant to represent the child Rachael had lost symbolically. The accident is also undoubtedly a turning point in Rachael’s life, since she’s recovering from shock and the world around her seems to have gotten stranger since before the accident. Her trauma, which previously was kept internal, has been driven into the outside world, either literally or as a result of her mental illness. She meets up with some elderly neighbors of hers, the Chathams, asking if they’d seen the boy that day, and of course Mrs. Chatham says she didn’t. Mr. Chatham is an invalid, groaning loudly in another room, but Mrs. Chatham ignores this, as if her husband were not casually in pain. “How was it possible that Mrs. Chatham didn’t hear him?” Even by the standards of the elderly, Mrs. Chatham is an odd one, in that she’s oddly detached from everything. She might be a manifestation of what Rachael could become in a few decades: a jaded old lady.\n\n(Safe to say that despite having just turned 86 [happy birthday] Oates is very much not jaded. Have you seen her Twitter?)\n\n“In Shock” starts as realistic, if also Modernist and Faulkneresque as mentioned before, but after the accident it takes a sharp turn towards the mythological. On top of the mystery of the boy Rachael can’t stop thinking about Greek mythology, especially Hades and Cerberus, that three-headed hound who gatekept the underworld. This is what I mean by the story alluding to the supernatural without every unambiguously entering that territory, because of course we never see Hades or enter that gate which Cerberus is protecting; but what we do get is the next best thing. Modern industry, coal and electricity, become symbols of a kind of underworld in the wake of Rachael’s accident, such that she starts imagining herself as living in a kind of purgatory. She’s also into comparative literature and said to be very well-read (not that L_ gave her credit for it), so it makes sense that she would turn to literature as a way of coping with her trauma. There’s another character, Morris B_ (often called just B_), an older man and a professor of antiquity whom Rachael very much likes, possibly even loves. Despite having known each other for years they never entered a relationship, in what you might call a near miss. When they meet again following the accident Rachael is reluctant to tell B_ what had happened to her, and is also repulsed by what she now realizes is his aging body, his skin “appeared finely cracked like the glaze of ancient pottery, and a starburst of a lurid red birthmark was newly visible through his thinning hair.” She almost can’t stand the sight of him. What should be a nice reunion, to take her mind off what she’s just been through, has become rotten.\n\nA possible point of inspiration for this story, although it’s never brought up in the text and I can’t even guarantee Oates has seen it, is the cult horror movie Carnival of Souls. Indeed “In Shock” almost feels like a remake of that movie, although I can’t guarantee this is the case and in all likelihood there’s no correspondence between the two. For those of you who aren’t into micro-budget indie horror movies from the ’60s, Carnival of Souls is about a woman who goes joy-riding with her friends when their car falls off a bridge and she emerges as the sole survivor. She moves, takes up playing the organ for local churches, gets a new apartment, but finds that ghosts are now following her seemingly everywhere she goes. We get many stories about places that are haunted, but only rarely do we get people who are haunted. Rachael, like the doomed heroine of Carnival of Souls, is herself haunted—by symbols if not actual ghosts. She meets up with a friend, Thea, who of course is also an academic, along with Thea’s daughter Cecie, who is also Rachael’s goddaughter. The meeting goes horribly wrong when Rachael sees (or thinks she sees) horrific scars on Cecie’s neck and is understandably (at least from her perspective) panicked about this, only for Thea to deny the scars are even there and kick Rachael out of the house. The true horror of this scene lies not in the child’s possible injury but in Rachael experiencing that which every person living with mental illness must endure: not being believed. The supernatural is more symbolic than literal, a stand-in for some sort of mental distress, like the seemingly unkillable dog in Faulkner’s “The Hound” being a stand-in for the protagonist’s guilt.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nThis is a hard story to spoil since it ends inconclusively; any of semblance of a plot sort of evaporates by the end of it. This is not exactly a negative criticism. I’m not sure how you’re supposed to end this kind of story without giving an answer that would inevitably undermine the mysteriousness of it. Why do you think David Lynch presented us a mystery in Mulholland Drive and then proceeded to never solve it? Joyce probably doesn’t intend for us to solve the mystery but rather to give us an experience—a glimpse into the mind of someone following a near-death experience. I know what that’s like. In March this year I had an accident wherein I seemed to have choked on peanut butter (of all things) and passed out in the kitchen. My throat had cleared but I lost consciousness and landed flat on my face. I must’ve been out for only a minute or less but I had these dreams that were horribly vivid, and which seemed to last much longer than the allotted time. I was driven to the ER and spent a few hours there, where doctors found that aside from the injury to my face (pretty nearly lost a tooth there) and very low blood pressure I was fine to go home. I was, of course, also delirious. I remember almost nothing from that night. I don’t even remember being driven to the ER. I feel like I’ve not been quite the same since then. But then who is, after something like that. It’s that transformative state, of being violently thrown out of normalcy, that the story captures.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nSorry if this seemed less like a review and more like an autobiographical tangent, but for what it’s worth I think Oates would approve of the digressions; after all, they do somewhat relate to the story. Sometimes the story is not really the point; sometimes what matters more is what you bring to the story. Again, apologies I missed this month’s editorial, but luckily I already know what I’ll be writing about next month so keep an eye out for that. As for the Oates, it’s an evocative short story that straddles the line between the psychological and the supernatural, understandably inspiring the Rob Alexander cover for that issue of F&SF. I do sometimes get the impression with Oates’s writing that it can be experimental for the sake of itself, but that’s not the case here.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nDespite having lived an incredibly long life (she was born in 1925 and died in 2019), Katherine MacLean wasn’t the most prolific of writers. She only wrote five novels, only two of which are solo efforts, and one of those is a fix-up. On the short fiction front she didn’t write a whole lot more, although she did have a streak in the ’50s; about half her short fiction was published that decade. MacLean was one of the few lady writers to appear regularly in Astounding (she even debuted there), but like a lot of other writers she hopped on the Galaxy bandwagon, appearing in that magazine’s first issue. “Pictures Don’t Lie” is a prototypical Galaxy-type story, and not unlike another early Galaxy story I reviewed recently, Philip K. Dick’s “The Defenders,” it’s founded on a Big Twist™. Unlike Dick’s story, however, MacLean’s remains effective even when taking the twist into account. Also like the Dick it was adapted for radio as an X Minus One episode, and has even been adapted elsewhere, including an EC Comics adaptation. It’s one of her most reprinted stories for a good reason.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the August 1951 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It was reprinted in Invaders of Earth (ed. Groff Conklin), The Great SF Stories #13 (ed. Isaac Asimov and Martin H. Greenberg), The PRentice Hall Anthology of Science Fiction and Fantasy (ed. Garyn G. Roberts), as well as the MacLean collection The Diploids. It’s also fallen out of copyright and is on Project Gutenberg.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nJoseph R. Nathen is a radio decoder for the American military, which during the Cold War would mean having a job that could potentially involve the difference between a frozen conflict and a hot one. But Nathen has found something a lot more incredible than signals from the other side of the Iron Curtain: he’s found signals of non-human intelligent life. “Squawking,” as he calls it, which needs to be slowed down, but the squawking is certainly not human, yet at the same time can be understood. Radio gives way to TV and it didn’t take long for Nathen to get a TV signal of the alien ship. He wanted pictures. “Pictures are understandable in any language,” he says. Nathen ends up being right about this—but also tragically wrong. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. There are only three real characters in this story: Nathen, a journalist named Jacob Luke who’s mostly referred to as the Times man (which Times?), and Nathen’s correspondent on the alien ship, nicknamed Bud. There are a few other characters, mostly journalists who are only called by the outlets they work for (the Herald, the News, and so on), and the dialogue is almost entirely expositional; good thing Nathen is fluent in Expositionese. If this story has a flaw that would turn some readers off it’s that it seems in love with its own attempts at explaining its premise—so dense in exposition as to be hard to digest.\n\n(The X Minus One adaptation does a pretty good job of streamlining the narrative, by giving us a solid viewpoint character [with the Times man] but also massively dialing back the scientific explanation for how the humans and aliens are able to communicate.)\n\nNathen had used the TV line to send the aliens the Rite of Spring segment of Fantasia, which the aliens not only received in a couple weeks but apparently enjoyed. At first this sounds like a match made in heaven with regards to first contacts: the aliens are not only able to respond back but can communicate, and according to Nathen their planet is “Earth-like.” The aliens seem to be humanoid, and the Earth team is able to receive TV images of the aliens on the ship. The question then remains: What could go wrong? There are a few warning signs, but the humans are unable to make heads or tails of what these abnormalities could mean. For one, the aliens move at a deliriously fast speed. “Something about the way they move…” As Nathen explains, while the images themselves are clear, the speed at which these images are relayed is hard to gauge. “When I turn the tape faster, they’re all rushing, and you begin to wonder why their clothes don’t stream behind them, why the doors close so quickly and yet you can’t hear them slam, why things fall so fast. If I turn it slower, they all seem to be swimming.” Something isn’t right. But still, the aliens intend to land on Earth, right outside the military base where the story’s happening—and soon.\n\nThe twist of this story is telegraphed pretty hard, but only with hindsight. I had the good fortune of not knowing the twist beforehand, so I was left with the genuine question of what the catch is—because there has to be a catch with a story like this. MacLean is clever here in that she turns the screw at just the right pace so that if you’re fast enough you can anticipate the twist, but there’s a good chance you won’t; but then you might reread the story and give yourself a pat on the back for taking note of what now reads as obvious foreshadowing. The title is ironic. It borders on postmodern—not in literary technique, obviously, but in how it shows that objective reality, or rather our notion of it, can be untrustworthy. Our perception of reality is based on our senses. The humans and aliens have differently calibrated perceptions and as such they don’t perceive the same space in the same way. When the alien ship comes to Earth the humans don’t see any sign of it by the landing pad, and Bud says the ship can’t see the humans anywhere despite surely having landed on Earth. The atmosphere, Bud says, is too thick—much thicker and soupier than Nathen said. The humans posit that the aliens might’ve landed on Venus by accident (this was when Venus was thought of as a gaseous swamp and not a hellworld), but this can’t be the case. Something has gone wrong, but they don’t know what.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nThe aliens are on Earth alright, and they’re even somewhere near the landing zone—but the humans can’t see the aliens. Bud says that the ship has come under attack and that the humans have to find the ship fast if there’s hope of saving them. It’s there that Nathen and the Times man realize the missing piece of the puzzle—and at the same time realize it’s probably too late to save the ship. It’s one of those great “we’re fucked” moments in old-timey SF, a real sense of having passed the point of no return, like locking your doors after your house has already been robbed, or realizing that one girl you liked had a crush on you as well and you only realize this years after the fact. MacLean gives us a real zinger of a final line, which encapsulates the bizarre tragedy of the situation, for why the humans can’t see the ship—at least not with the naked eye: “We’ll need a magnifying glass for that.” The aliens move at such an odd speed and the atmosphere around them is so thick because they are, in fact, microscopic. The pictures didn’t lie, but they didn’t tell the whole story either. The humans thought they had made contact with likeminded aliens when in fact they were giants who had made contact with beings even smaller than ants, and neither side could figure this out until it was too late. This is how you do a twist ending.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\n“Pictures Don’t Lie” is basically a tragedy, not caused by technology but aided by it. Even by the early ’50s there’ve been a ton of first contact narratives, such that it would take a bit of ingenuity to write a story of this type that’s truly memorable. MacLean was still very young, and early in her career at this point, but she did have that touch of ingenuity. More impressively t’s a story that raises questions about the utility of the brand-spanking-new technology called television, about how such technology might contribute to first contact with aliens—and how even with this new tech something could go wrong. It’s also a question of size and perspective. We always imagine aliens like how they appear in Star Trek, humanoids that happen to be the same size as humans. MacLean posits we might find life on another planet—or possibly in a grain of sand.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nI don’t often get the chance to talk about authors not totally embedded in the realm of genre SF, which makes someone like Jonathan Lethem a bit of a treat. Lethem is nowadays known as a “literary” writer, with non-SF works like Motherless Brooklyn and The Fortress of Solitude gaining him a foothold in the literary crowd, if not exactly the mainstream. But unlike some other writers who started out writing genre who then tried distancing themselves from genre trappings, Lethem never forgot his roots. Indeed for someone who’s not primarily known as an SF writer, at least half of Lethem’s novels are SF, including his first four novels. He’s also unabashedly a Philip K. Dick fan, even going to far as to edit Dick’s Exegesis for book publication. Today’s story was published the same year as Lethem’s debut novel, Gun, with Occasional Music, and like that novel it wears its Dick influence on its sleeve—not in a bad way, of course.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the Spring 1994 issue of Crank!, which is on the Archive. It’s been reprinted only once, in the anthology The Best of Crank! (ed. Bryan Cholfin). Much of Lethem’s short fiction has not been collected outside of anthologies, so this is not unusual.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThis is a cautionary tales of sorts, about a salesman and an artist. The salesman is Pete Flost, and he sells robotic puppets to schoolkids. After school the kids swarm out like bugs and Flost, along with the competition, stands by with his trunk of merchandise. The puppets sell for very cheap, since they’re aimed at children—but that’s not where the money comes from. “Clients paid Desani and Sons large figures to equip the puppets with advertising programs, aimed at the buyers’ parents.” Flost works for Desani and Sons, who in turn work for advertisers. When in doubt, turn to ads. Flost has a digital wristband telling him his bank information; so do the kids. (Where do they get their money from? I would assume allowance.) The kids, like their adult counterparts, are fickle; they’re quickly learning how to think in a capitalist environment. Much to Flost’s dismay the turnout for his merchandise is underwhelming, and to make matters worse he then has to pay a ticket for speeding. Tellingly we’re not even told Flost’s name for the first few pages; he’s just “the salesman,” and indeed he’ll mostly be called that throughout the story. He’s a salesman down on his luck, and as a cog in the machine he’s not much more than that.\n\nWe cut to the artist, Zigmund Figment, who’s kind of a fraud, or as we say in a post-Hans Zimmer post-James Patterson post-Drake world, someone who makes art… with some uncredited help. That’s not the point. The irony is that despite being a salesman who sells “banal commercial narrative dolls” for a living, Flost is not a cynic; he means well. Meanwhile Figment is ruthlessly cynical—opportunistic, sure, but he also has open contempt for his own customers. It’s during a heated discussion with one of these customers that a random idea pops into Figment’s head: that he could make a killing selling something as cheap as disposable as those dolls. “There could be something there.” The dolls, acting alive but being non-sentient, are characters with their own programmed narratives, set to deactivate permanently after a 24-hour cycle. But suppose the character of one of these dolls was based on a person? And that’s how Figment comes into contact with Desani and Sons, and more specifically how he teams up with Flost—to use the salesman’s likeness for a doll Figment has in mind. The puppet salesman will serve as the basis for a salesman puppet.\n\nOn the one hand, this is a very Philip K. Dick story; it’s the kind of story he might’ve written had he lived through the Reagan years. I don’t mean this as a bad thing, even if it does smack of derivativeness. Lethem would move away from this heightened satirical brand of SF as he got older, and it’s not hard to see why; but also in some ways (though it pains me to say this as a fellow Dickhead) Lethem is a better writer than Dick. His sentences are less stilted and he’s able to pack almost a novel’s worth of detail into just a few pages, such that you could probably write a whole short story about just the dolls, but here they’re merely an accessory to the larger narrative. Dick was arguably the greatest critic of American capitalism among genre SF writers in his time, and Lethem continues this ruthlessness by presenting a shadowy and greedy landscape that lacks any semblance of spirituality—a film noir world without a detective. Flost is by no means a hero, but then Figment isn’t what you’d call a villain either; he’s merely a business-minded fellow who wants to take advantage of the system he was born into. He’s disgusted with the system (and with himself, really) but feels he has no power to change it. When Flost asks him why he’d wanna make a salesman puppet, Figment replies, “I’m looking for a medium that metaphorizes the temporal, presold, infantilizing, reflexive qualities of contemporary artistic expression, my own especially.” He knows it’s all a game.\n\n“Mood Bender” is loose on plot but tight on character and substance; what it lacks in cohesion of events it makes up for in the density of its world and the sheer existential dread of its characters. Figment is a scumbag, casually rude to restaurant staff so he can get a discount, that sort of thing, but he’s also the man with the vision. That Figment is the assertive one of the two while Flost is weak-willed (a bit of a Willy Loman figure) speaks bleakly of both of them. Being an “artist” but not someone who wants to put in all the hours of work and solitude to make his art, Figment also hooks up with Ben Iffman, a friend of Flost’s and a designer for the puppets. “It wasn’t that Iffman’s designs necessarily sold more than anyone else’s, but handling them meant something to the salesman.” The problem is that this arrangement ends up working too well. Iffman catches on to Figment’s idea so fast he starts selling his puppets to the same clientele before Figment’s own plan can come to fruition. Without Iffman, and with his sales declining, Flost loses his job at Desani and Sons (although they don’t word it like that), and Figment for his troubles gets beat at his own game. As is typical of Lethem, the best laid plans of mice and men come to naught.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nLethem asks a scary question: Are we somehow product? And if we’re product then does that mean we can be replaced? On his last day with Desani and Sons Flost is treated more like faulty machinery than a flesh-and-blood person who has to pay rent. Figment, who really always treated his art as both product and extensions of himself, gets what you might call his just desserts when people stop buying his shit. In the last stretch of the story, after both men have fallen from grace and been relegated to vagrancy, we see a robot priest—not sentient, but merely a machine that spouts pre-programmed platitudes. We have killed God—not with philosophy or even with machinery, but with dollars. The world in-story is in very bad shape. The only real refuge from this might be cold sleep, which curiously serves a similar function in Gun, with Occasional Music, as a kind of debtor’s prison. Run out of money and struggling to find a job? How about you slip into a coma. By the end of the story we’ve come back to the place we started at, with the schoolkids, only now Flost and Figment are drunkards poking fun at their own dashed hopes of success. Did I mention this is bleak?\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nThis is a good enough story that Lethem could’ve sold it to a higher-paying market—but then how many outlets published post-cyberpunk material like this in 1994? Lethem appeared in Asimov’s several times, but not in this case. Omni was on its way out. Interzone is British. There weren’t many markets for short SF at the time, which might be one reason Lethem hasn’t written much short SF; and when it came to novels he would eventually get to writing non-SF work, although the noir aspect very much remained. “Mood Bender” is short but brutal; it’s at times funny, but it’s by no means light reading. If you’re reading this then you’ve probably already ready some Lethem, but if not then it’s a good place to start.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nWe last covered Greg Egan with his 2002 quantum computing novella “Singleton,” which was very typical Egan; now we have something more atypical. Egan is one of the quintessential transhumanist writers in SF and one of the leading figures of the post-cyberpunk era in the ’90s; but “Oceanic” is not cyberpunk at all. Here we have a coming-of-age story on an alien planet, about a young man’s crisis of faith through both religion and sex, apparently inspired by Egan’s own disillusionment with Christianity in his youth as recounted in his autobiographical essay “Born Again, Briefly,” which I highly recommend reading as a kind of double feature with “Oceanic.” Indeed despite the exotic locale this reads as one of Egan’s most personal works, and while it isn’t cyberpunk it does manage to veer back into some go-to Egan themes. The gambit paid off, as it remains Egan’s single most decorated story, having won the Hugo for Best Novella as well as placed first in the Locus and Asimov’s readers’ polls for that year. It might also be my favorite Egan story I’ve read so far.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the August 1998 issue of Asimov’s Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. Gardner Dozois liked this story so much he bought it for Asimov’s, but then reprinted it in The Year’s Best Science Fiction: Sixteenth Annual Collection and The Best of the Best Volume 2: 20 Years of the Year’s Best Short Science Fiction Novels. It’s in the Egan collection Oceanic, and of course it’s also in The Best of Greg Egan. You can read it free online at Egan’s site, so you don’t have an excuse!\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nSometimes when I’m reviewing a story I feel like I’m struggling to come up with things to say about it, but with “Oceanic” there’s no such problem—especially if you know how autobiographical it is. But first some context. We’re on the planet Covenant, over a thousand years after humanoids (I say “humanoids” because it doesn’t look like normal humans had come to the planet in the first place), and we follow Martin, who as narrator is writing what you might call a fictional memoir, recounting from the time he was about ten to when he was deep in his twenties. Martin and his family are “Freelanders,” in that they live on the vast waters of the planet, unlike the “Firmlanders” who live primarily on land. Martin’s family are Transitional, that is to say mildly religious, but Martin’s older brother, Daniel, joins the Deep Church, a fundamentalist sect, when he’s fifteen (David being five years Martin’s senior). Daniel tries to convert Martin, and in a scene ripped straight from Egan’s own life (his older brother having split from their Anglican family and converted to Catholicism as a teenager), the two kneel by Martin’s bed one night and pray to Beatrice, the Christ-like figure of the religion. But Martin hasn’t really been converted yet. “I wasn’t sure that I wanted Beatrice to change my mind, and I was afraid that this display of fervour might actually persuade Her.” The practice starts as more out of respect for Daniel than believing his faith, but Martin will soon go through a rite of passage that will turn him into a firm believer—for a while. This is all told with melancholy hindsight.\n\n“Oceanic” is a coming-of-age narrative, or a bildungsroman, about a boy crossing the shadow-line (to steal Conrad) into maturity—a crossing that tends to be not one experience but several key turning points. The first major turning point for Martin is arguably not kneeling with Daniel that one night, but taking part in the Drowning, a ritual in which someone is submerged in the depths of Covenant’s waters—so far down that it would seem suicidal, and yet this near-death experience is euphoric, at least if the person accepts Beatrice in their heart. Martin is Drowned one day, with Daniel as his second, and this experience in the depths, by his lonesome, makes him feel like he’s somehow become one with Beatrice. A switch gets flipped inside his head. Getting Drowned is something only the Deep Church people do, as others see it as dangerous and an aberration, something fundamentalists do; but his Drowning causes a religious awakening in Martin. As he struggles in the depths he recounts the story of Beatrice and the “Angels” as written in the Scriptures. This is where things gets pretty strange, and dense, in the sense that Egan seems to have developed a whole origin story for the people of this planet—one that is clearly adjacent to Christianity, although there’s a transhumanist twist that’s more implied than explained. While submerged, Martin takes in a gulp of the seawater, and at this moment light floods his vision, leaving “a violet afterimage” once it recedes and Daniel brings him back to the surface, the Drowning successful.\n\nThe irony is that after this point Martin and Daniel’s relationship weakens, granted that part of this is to be expected given their age gap. Martin gets involved with Daniel’s Prayer Group, but soon grows tired of it. “What did I have in common with them, really?” The brothers grow apart. Daniel gets married young to a fellow Deep Church person named Agnes and the two lead a boring, traditional life thereafter. Some years pass and now Martin’s a teenager. It’s at this point that I should probably mention the eccentric biology of the humans in this story. Something I noticed only after the fact is that Egan refrains from giving physical descriptions of characters really, and this could be for a few reasons, but one reason I can think of is that the characters are physically androgynous—they, in fact, have physical traits of both male and female, and even functioning sex organs that would normally be unique to either. They’re true hermaphrodites, “women and men were made indistinguishable in the sight of God.” What gender someone identifies as really does come down to their self-perception rather than their sex. I’m bringing this up now because it’ll soften the blow for when we get to what is perhaps the most important scene in the story—and also the most unusual. When Daniel gets married Martin meets up with one of Agnes’s cousins, Lena, a Firmlander who nonetheless is very interested in the way Freelanders live. The two hit it off and enter a sort of casual relationship, and it doesn’t take long for sex to enter the picture.\n\nSo, in a bildungsroman, it’s not uncommon for the protagonist’s first sexual experience to serve as a turning point in the narrative, as a euphoric or traumatic experience. One’s first time is rarely all that. I myself didn’t lose my virginity till I was 21, and it was with someone I was not in a relationship with; it was a one-time thing, but the important thing is that we were nice to each other and there was certainly no pain in it. A lot of people aren’t so lucky. Poor Martin over here has one of the strangest first times possible—not because the sex with Lena goes wrong exactly but because there’s a certain part of the exchange nobody had thought to warn him about in advance. Remember how I said that the people of Covenant are hermaphrodites? Not only that, but the penis is apparently detachable. If sex happens between someone with a penis and someone with a vagina there’s a literal exchange of “the bridge,” so that after he climaxes inside Lena Martin finds, to his horror, that Lena now has his cock and that Martin, with blood on his groin, finds that a pussy has formed where his cock once was. (There’s no mention of testicles that I can recall—and no, don’t ask me to go back through to see if there is. I would have to think then that the testes are internal, somehow, but still functional. For better or worse Egan doesn’t go into great detail as to how the anatomy of these future humans could function. The effect is akin to one of Dali’s paintings, or one of the more nightmarish scenes in a Buñuel film.) Eventually Martin and Lena have sex a second time so that Martin can get his dick back; but the relationship has done sour because of that first time and they seemingly never talk again.\n\nA lot is happening, so let’s rewind the film and take this step by step. We’re never outright told this I believe, but it’s implied pretty heavily, even early on, that the humans on Covenant are the descendants of the so-called Angels, who apparently had foregone flesh-and-blood bodies but then decided to build organic yet artificial bodies for themselves so that they could experience bodily pleasures and even mortality again. The Angels, being basically noncorporeal, are now spoken of as if they were literal angels, the “present” of the story being so far into our future that even the far future of the Angels is spoken of as if it were ancient history or myth. Egan has gone out of his to imagine a future humanity that in some ways is not so different from us, but then there’s the biology of these people. Martin losing his virginity is a traumatic event for more than one reason: it gives him gender dysphoria, makes him feel ashamed because he’s had not only had sex while unmarried but lost his “bridge” in the process, and it’s the first time in his life where the hard reality of biology shakes his faith. I probably should’ve also mentioned “Oceanic” nearly made the shortlist for the Tiptree Award. Now, transphobes might read this story and be repulsed by its implications, because it becomes obvious that, as is regularly the case with Egan’s fiction, biology is framed as tyrannical. Martin and his kind are not beholden to biology but victims of it. (I saw someone theorize that Greg Egan is actually a woman, and while it’s true we’ve never seen or heard Egan, I find this a bit far-fetched.) Indeed Martin deciding to study microbiology, under an affable but ultimately dead-end professor named Barat, will prove to make him only more miserable.\n\nSomething I’ve had to do in writing this review is go back through “Oceanic” and reread some passages, which I’m not prone to doing for these—in no small part because I know with certainty there are details I had missed on my first reading. On the one hand you could try boiling this story down to a “religion sucks” narrative, but that really would not be doing the world Egan has built justice, nor would it encapsulate the thematic depths. Granted that showing “Oceanic” to a transphobic Christian would disgruntle them, it’s more a dramatization of Egan’s own coming of age; this is his Go Tell It on the Mountain. A mild criticism I have of Egan’s writing is that when it comes to first-person narrators they tend to have more or less the same voice, which I have to take to some extent as Egan’s own voice: brooding, seemingly teetering on the line between macho and a little feminine, a sort of overly sensitive film noir detective cadence. Martin might be the most Egan-ish of Egan narrators, and yet rather than distract me this ended up being more of an asset than a negative—indeed Martin being the quintessential Egan narrator might well be the whole point. The result is that despite not having anything to do (at least directly, though it’s very much part of the backstory) with computing or quantum uncertainty, “Oceanic” manages to be thematically kin with Egan’s other work, even if on the surface it seems to hark to a kind of old-school planetary science fiction. As someone who’s not very literate in computer science (like most people) I thus found it accessible by Egan’s standards.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nAs he ages Martin distances himself more from organized religion—first from the Deep Church and even the Transitionals, increasingly finding fault and hypocrisy in the arguments of theologians. Among his own scientific colleagues he finds himself siding more with the earnest atheists than with whom he sees as weak-willed believers. “Theology aside, the whole dynamics of the group was starting to get under my skin; maybe I’d be better off spending my time in the lab, impressing Barat with my dedication to his pointless fucking microbes.” And then tragedy strikes. Martin’s mom comes down with a severe illness, and by the time he gets to hospital she has already died. Daniel was there, but this ends up being the final straw for Martin’s perception of him, for according to Daniel’s own faith their mother is destined for Hell since she was never drowned; but upon confronting him about this bit of theology Martin finds that his fundamentalist older brother has softened—for his own sake if nobody else’s. “There was no truth in anything he said, anything he believed. It was all just an expression of his own needs.” By this point Martin has become one of those devout but rebelliously individualistic religious people, but even his personal faith has been eroding, slowly but surely. “The God of the gaps,” to use an edgy atheist phrase. What breaks the camel’s back turns out to be Martin’s own work in the microbes of Covenant’s oceans.\n\nSo, to make a long story short, the microbes in the planet’s water have this hallucinatory fucky-wucky effect if taken into one’s body in concentrated form. The humans on Covenant have adapted to these microbes in moderation, but it’s still dangerous to interact with too much, which would explain the religious experiences had by those who have Drowned. Martin’s religiousus experience, which he had kept close to his heart all these years even as his understanding of the natural world expanded, has a scientific explanation: he saw some freaky shit because he had inhaled a concentrated amount of these microbes. It’s like the SFnal version of how people who suffer from epilepsy are prone to having “religious” visions—or indeed people with schizophrenia who claim to be in touch with the divine. Biology has its way with Martin; it caresses him, withers him, takes the moon and the sun from him, takes what is in front of him and even behind from him, and at the end of the day it takes God from him.\n\nI was lucky: I’d been born in an era of moderation. I hadn’t killed in the name of Beatrice. I hadn’t suffered for my faith. I had no doubt that I’d been far happier for the last fifteen years than I would have been if I’d told Daniel to throw his rope and weights overboard without me.\n\nBut that didn’t change the fact that the heart of it all had been a lie.\n\nAt age 25 Martin becomes an atheist, incidentally around the same age when Egan gave up his own faith. This is not a victory for atheism or any dumb bullshit like that, but rather a melancholy crossing of the shadow-line, from youth to manhood. Something is lost and gained, at the same time, like a passing of the torch. While “Oceanic” is by no means Egan’s first “mature” story (he had already written Permutation City and Disapora at this point, not to mention some pretty great short fiction), it’s a reflection on the artist (or the scientist, who anyway is adjacent to the artist) coming into his own. Maturity is not sunshine and rainbows.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nI ended up reading “Born Again, Briefly” after I had read “Oceanic” but before starting this review, which turned out to be a good idea since it helped explain the strong personal touch of this story. It’s also a bit of a mind-bender, but not for the reasons typically associated with Egan, in that you don’t have to be an amateur computer programmer to understand the point he’s trying to make. Still, it’s a dense novella that almost demands a second reading, for pleasure but also so one can soak in all the details. Egan could’ve gone farther with the gender aspect, but for 1998 it’s still pretty wild and forward-thinking. People forget that even in 1998, which for some of you was not that long ago, queer representation in SF was very… mixed. And also nearly always evidently from a cishet perspective. With that in mind, “Oceanic” has aged pretty gracefully; it also happens to be a story people new to Egan can read without issue.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nCordwainer Smith had such a colorful life that you could probably make a movie out of it. Where to even start? Real name Paul Linebarger, Smith was born to American missionaries who often traveled around the globe, such that Smith went from school to school and didn’t have much time to make any friends in his youth. Of all the places he visited China seemed to leave by far the biggest impression, with his father even being involved in Chinese politics in the early 20th century. Smith was Sun Yat-sen’s godson, although Sun Yat-sen died when Smith would’ve been only twelve. The Christianity of both his parents and godfather would also have an influence on Smith’s work, although he was by no means didactic about it. He came up with the name “Cordwainer Smith” to create a thick degree of separation between his life working in government and his SF writing. While he’s now most known for his SF, Smith (as Linebarger) wrote the first major text on psychological warfare, literally titled Psychological Warfare, as well as non-fiction works on East-Asian geopolitics. Under the pseudonym “Felix C. Forrest” (a reference to his Chinese name) he also wrote espionage novels, although good luck finding those nowadays.\n\nSmith was one of the most idiosyncratic writers of his era, inside or outside of SF, and one has to wonder what more he could’ve done during the height of the New Wave (he died in 1966). His first SF story as an adult, “Scanners Live in Vain,” was published in 1950, but Smith wouldn’t get consistently published until the last half-dozen or so years of his life, in no small part thanks to Frederik Pohl. From circa 1961 onward Pohl had first dibs on Smith’s fiction, such that “Drunkboat” is one of the few Smith stories from this era to not be published in any of Pohl’s magazines—which means he must’ve rejected it. I can see why: it’s kind of a hot mess. But it’s the kind of noble failure that showcases a unique talent, and the individual components are very much worth your interest.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the October 1963 issue of Amazing Stories, which is on the Archive. It’s been reprinted quite a few times, in The 9th Annual of the Year’s Best SF (ed. Judith Merril), Amazing Stories: 60 Years of the Best Science Fiction (ed. Isaac Asimov and Martin H. Greenberg), and the heckin’ chonker The Science Fiction Century (ed. David G. Hartwell). Of course it’s also in The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith. Now, it’s come to my attention that most of Smith’s work has fallen out of copyright—in Canada. This story is on the Canadian version of Project Gutenberg. I’m not advising you do this, but if you (as a non-Canadian) were to use a VPN and disguise yourself as one of the filthy, unwashed denizens of Toronto…\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThis is a hard story to spoil, if only because Smith spoils it for us, right at the beginning. We’re told that Artyr Rambo (yes, that is his name) was a man looking for his beloved, Elizabeth, apparently separately by many light-years, and he would do anything to get to her, including hopping aboard a rocket ship “of an ancient design” with the letters IOM (Instrumentality of Mankind) on its side and jaunting his way over to the hospital where she’s being kept. We know from the start that Rambo succeeds, that he and Elizabeth are reunited, and that Rambo himself has since gone down as a legend. The story, as such, is written like an oral telling of something ancient, mythical, and probably fabricated, but which serves an inspirational purpose. We know how this story starts and ends, but without context and without what will turn out to be a frenzied middle that will take a fair bit of explaining. Rambo winds up naked and unconscious, but apparently alive, just outside the Old Main Hospital where Elizabeth is being kept—or rather her body is. (Death does not have the same ramifications at this point in the Instrumentality history as it does for us.) How he got there, without his rocket ship anywhere in sight, is the mystery that will drive the plot. But of course I’ve already mentioned “jaunting”…\n\n“Drunkboat” starts basically as a hospital drama, with the doctors trying to get the comatose Rambo to response—then later realizing that trying to get a response from him may leave everyone worse off. One of the doctors, Grosbeck, even suggests killing Rambo once it becomes clear that there’s something monstrously wrong with the patient, but Vomact, the chief doctor, vetoes the decision. This will have disastrous consequences short-term, but his survival will turn Rambo into a legend and so revolutionize space flight. (Smith also adds in parenthetical asides, like this one, telling us about things that haven’t happens in-story yet, or things Rambo would not have known about at the time.) So there’s a problem. Rambo is comatose and yet seems to have powers beyond human understanding; he’s able to do things by some external force, which will eventually spark the story’s climax. (But aren’t I getting ahead of myself again?) A lot of damage could’ve been prevented had Rambo stayed conscious and been able to tell the doctors what he wanted. “Not till much later did people understand what Rambo had been trying to do—crossing sixty mere meters to reach his Elizabeth when he had already jumped an un-count of light-years to return to her.” Rambo, unbeknownst to everyone at the hospital, was a guinea pig for Crudelta, one of the Lords of the Instrumentality, and he was a test subject for discovering “space-three”—a test that proved to be, if anything, too successful. Space-three (it’s written a few different ways, but I’m calling it that for consistency’s sake) is a word that comes up in several Instrumentality stories, but here we actually get something like an explanation.\n\nYou may think this is all a bit confusing. It is. Smith crams a lot of his future history into this novelette, such that it feels longer than it is, if only by virtue of feeling overstuffed. We’re told, mostly in a casual way, that this is a distant future where humanity has spread across many planets, being ruled by the Instrumentality which is a technocratic aristocracy (or an aristocratic technocracy), complete with computers and robots. The underpeople, a coalition of half-human half-animal genetically engineered humanoids made for slave labor, are only mentioned in passing in “Drunkboat,” and if you were to read just this story you wouldn’t know that the underpeople are arguably the most important factor in Smith’s future history. You wouldn’t even know what the underpeople are just from reading “Drunkboat.” On the one hand this makes Smith’s writing hard to make sense of at times, and is a problem not unique to this story but rather something that makes the barrier of entry for Smith’s writing a rather high one; but then I love how there are details on the margins of the story that hint as a much larger universe—so large that a couple dozen short stories and novellas, plus a novel, Smith couldn’t “finish” the future history. He gives the impression of something impossibly distant in our future, yet something so old in his future that Rambo’s story is told like one of Homer’s epics. It doesn’t work totally here, but you have to admire the ambition.\n\nReading “Drunkboat,” the only example in SF it reminded me of that would’ve predated the story is one of the most influential and experimental of all ’50s SF novels: Alfred Bester’s The Stars My Destination. Granted that Rambo is not a snarling brute like Bester’s Gully Foyle, but still he causes a lot of damage (including a dozen people killed “irrevocably,” their bodies being vaporized and so irretrievable) in the name of a rather self-centered goal: getting back with Elizabeth. There’s also the question of jaunting, Bester’s word for teleporting across space in his novel that I’ll use here; Smith has a different word for it, but it’s basically the same thing. I’m not sure if Smith had read Bester’s novel, but he likely did, and who can blame him? Bester’s novel and the Instrumentality future history do share a fair bit in common: they see humanity using spaceships (and later teleporting) to conquer the stars, and yet the aristocracy is maybe more powerful than ever before. Corruption is everywhere. Human life is treated callously. In Smith’s world slavery has come back in a big way. Both robots and the underpeople are treated as expendable. There’s a pessimism (but also a Christian-coded hope of liberation) in Smith’s world that might’ve been off-putting in the ’50s (hence him struggling to find outlets then), but which anticipated the New Wave. I’m a lot more interested in the world of the story than the story itself. Maybe the story is not really the point.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nIf “Drunkboat” had a fatal flaw, other than being cluttered, it’s that it switches gears abruptly a couple times, such that I’m not sure what I would classify it as other than SF generally. I said before it starts as a hospital drama, but then suddenly (and I think unconvincingly) it turns into proto-military SF before finally turning into sort of a courtroom drama. I would have less of a problem with this trajectory if the story was longer, possibly novella-length, but as is it’s a jumble wherein the components are easy to lose track of. It doesn’t help either that Rambo, the protagonist, is unconscious for most of the story. Granted, Frankenstein’s monster didn’t talk much either. Crudelta is a curious villain (if you can call him that), but he only really gets a chance to shine in the last stretch. Elizabeth barely even qualifies as a character, and when she gets a case of killed-and-then-revived amnesia (in-story a person getting killed and then brought back may as well be a different person since they get amnesia and are likely to form a different personality) it’s more like something inconvenient that Rambo has to get used to rather than tragic. (After reading a fair bit of Smith I do have to wonder if he was only capable of writing women as either shrewish, aloof, or submissive.) It’s implied that Crudelta will not face punishment for his inhuman treatment of Rambo, but that’s not really a criticism. After all, Rambo doesn’t have too much to complain about, for he has come back a demigod who can start a literal war with just his manipulation of space-three.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nThe problem I encountered with “Drunkboat” was I found it a lot more fun to think about than to read. This is less a functioning self-contained story and more a neat bit of world-building that happens to have a really tangled plot at its center. If this is your first Instrumentality story then there are small details here that Smith doesn’t elaborate on and which will probably not make any sense to you. Even after having read a decent portion of Smith’s fiction (there isn’t a whole lot of it), my brain still ached a bit by the end. And yet I have to recommend “Drunkboat” as a curiosity. For both better and worse, nobody in the pre-New Wave days wrote like Cordwainer Smith, such that even his failures are worth it.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nJames Patrick Kelly and John Kessel have been friends and collaborators for about forty years at this point, although they started very much apart, and each man when taken on his own is a very different beast from the other. They’ve also been at times associated with the cyberpunk movement, but neither can really be called a cyberpunk author—especially Kessel, who by 1984 had already won a Nebula for the existential nightmare (and tribute to Melville) that is “Another Orphan.” As for Kelly, I had written about his similarly anxiety-inducing cyberpunk fable “Rat” for Young People Read Old SFF. It’s been long enough since I’ve written about either. “Friend” was their first collaboration, and it would be quickly followed by the novel Freedom Beach. Kelly and Kessel gave themselves a challenge with today’s story, which was to write a personal drama aboard a luxury space cruiser with a first-person narrator. For reasons I’ll get into it’s surprising the story works as well as it does, and that Kelly and Kessel—still early in their careers—managed to bring out the best in each other.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the January 1984 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. To my shock it has been reprinted only once in English—in The Year’s Best Science Fiction, Second Annual Collection (ed. Gardner Dozois).\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nJake is a Friend on the Le Corbusier, a space cruiser. A Friend is a bit of an odd job—an amalgamation of counselor and security. “During a starcrossing, a Friend has sole responsibility for the safety of his passengers; no one, not the ship’s crew, its captain, or even the president of IPT may interfere.” Which sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, and indeed Jake is telling his story with a good deal of hindsight, after his “great loss.” In the future, it has become commonplace to travel between the stars, although it still takes a lot of money and there are still risks involved. Some get to stay conscious onboard as the ship jumps through space, but others are put in cryosleep—sometimes as a form of punishment—and those in cryo are not guaranteed to survive the voyage. The following story could be considered something of a love triangle, between Jake, Leila Jahiz, and Phillip Goodson. Leila is an aspiring ballet dancer while Goodson is VP of IPT and, once upon a time, was Jake’s superior as a Friend. Mind you that being a higher-up at IPT is no joke, considering they have a monopoly on commercial space flight. Jake always hated Goodson, which may or may not color how Our Hero™ frames Goodson in his narration. Maybe it would be unfair to call Jake an unreliable narrator, but without getting into spoilers too soon it might be in his interest to make himself look less bad in his own story.\n\nSo there’s the problem of “hitchhiking” during a starcrossing, which is basically someone who doesn’t have the money to rent space on the ship hitching with someone who does. To be fair, cold sleep is somewhat dangerous, so it’s not an appetizing alternative. The dilemma here is simple: Leila wants to hitch with Goodson and use his position to help her get into the dance troupe of her choosing—which of course means the best of the best. Leila, according to Jake anyway, is not so conventionally attractive, nor does she have the magic touch expected of the top dancers; but she’s tenacious, and despite his comments on her appearance Jake still very much has a thing for her when they meet a second time. They had previously met about a decade prior, when Leila was a teen hopeful and Jake was just starting his work as a counselor, before he had even become a Friend. The two had an affair while Leila was Jake’s client, which is—bad. “I had no intention of falling in love with her,” but he did, and upon seeing each other again those feelings have returned. Now, it’s not unusual for a Friend to have sex with crossers, but it’s supposed to be done as a way to keep people happy on the ship and is done with those who aren’t looking to hitchhike. Jake even gets hit on by an underage dancer, although thankfully he seems to turn her down—or at least it looks that way.\n\nOn the night I read “Friend” I went to bed thinking randomly about what it had reminded me of, because initially I couldn’t put my finger on it. Then it occurred to me that, coincidental or not, it reads like early John Varley. I mean this in a good way. Varley was one of the best new SFF writers to debut in the ’70s and his Eight Worlds stories especially are still a lot of fun to read, although the catch is that his stuff could get a little too horny. Leila is sleeping her way up the ladder, which to her credit is a fact she makes no attempt to hide. (Something that just occurred to me as I’m writing this is that the phrase “to blow off” means “to fuck” basically, in the context of the story. Some future-history jargon?) Again, if the two hadn’t known each other beforehand it wouldn’t even be unusual for Jake to Leila to have sex on the ship. A rival dancer, Brenda, goes to Jake for a quick fuck more than once, in fact—not because she finds Jake attractive particularly but because she needs to “blow off” steam, having not gained Goodson’s favor. And Jake, seeing that this is probably for the best, goes along with her. “As I had expected, Brenda was not so much interested in me as in saving face, and a brief affair with the Friend offered her an acceptable means.” Brenda did this in the hopes of catching Goodson’s attention, maybe making him jealous; but the move doesn’t seem to have paid off, as neither Leila nor Goodson confronts her about it. It does stir gossip on the ship, which Jake was expecting. “The community of crossers is small, and boredom is its greatest enemy.” It’s a tricky situation, when you’re stuck babysitting a bunch of rich assholes and sometimes you’re called on to do things that would normally be considered very unprofessional.\n\nTwo things really struck me about this story: its pacing and the uniformity + believability of Jake’s voice as a narrator. F&SF and ISFDB count “Friend” as a novelette, but it must barely count because it’s only about fourteen magazine pages and feels even shorter than that. Even so, despite couching the drama in a far-off location and having to do some legwork to flesh out the world, it’s a neatly self-contained narrative. Despite the brevity the three main characters are written as being flawed, but not two-dimensional, although Goodson is written (or perhaps thought of) as without redeeming qualities: he’s a real asshole, despite his name. As for Jake, it’s a minor miracle Kelly and Kessel were able to not only imagine such a character but write him consistently. I have not collaborated with a fellow author in… let’s say a very long time. So I’m not sure how one would go about co-writing a story, especially in the late Cretaceous pre-internet age. I’m curious as to who wrote what, because despite his evident internal conflict Jake has a consistent voice and the other characters are vividly drawn. Did one focus on dialogue while the other on narration? It’s an effective character drama that shows both men in control of their abilities, which is not something that can often be said of collaborations. The tragedy of the situation is maybe predictable, but it’s still heartbreaking; this is not even lessened by the foreknowledge that Jake will lose—has, in fact, already lost.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nSo, perhaps predictably, Jake and Leila have sex. “This was not the political coupling that I had had with Brenda,” he admits. This is personal. The two still want each other, but Leila wants to reach the top even more than she wants to be with Jake—not that Jake really minds that. The real problem is now he has a conflict of interest, because as a Friend he should report Leila for conspiring to hitchhike—only doing so would not only ruin her chances at success but likely ruin their friendship. Jake thinks Goodson must be putting him up to something, and he’s not totally wrong about this—only he ends up being wrong in a way he failed to expect. Goodson more or less tricks Jake into ratting out Leila, a fact he realizes too late. The truth is that Goodson doesn’t give a shit about Leila, both as a person and a dancer, and was only using her to get back at Jake. Jake was hoping to hurt Goodson but he ends up hurting someone he actually likes, although he tries his best to keep the fact that he’s the rat from Leila; whether or not she ever finds out is left ambiguous. So Jake quits his job after the voyage, in shame. It’s not a complete loss. Over the next ten years he starts his own company, becomes successful at that, and Leila even gets into the prestigious dance troupe she always wanted—even if it happened several years later than she had hoped. But the two have not spoken in years, and it’s only at the very end, when Jake goes to see one of Leila’s performances for the first time, that there’s a ray of hope for him. Now that’s a good bittersweet ending.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\n“Friend” could’ve certainly been printed in Asimov’s; it might’ve been submitted there first, who’s to say. In a way you can sense this is a borderline space opera that was written following John Varley’s influence on the field, and during that era when Hollywood studios were still scrambling for the next Star Wars; but while it may strike some as retrograde now I’d actually say it has aged more gracefully than most. “Friend” works as well as it does, I suspect, because at heart Kelly and Kessel are humanists. The story is certainly SFnal enough, but ultimately it’s a story with human characters who are by no means cardboard cutouts. Given that this was considered major enough to be the cover story of the F&SF issue it first appeared in, I’m a little dismayed it hasn’t been reprinted more.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nJack Vance is one of the most influential 20th century SFF writers, and also not read nearly as much as you’d think. If the Goodreads numbers are to be believed. Vance debuted in 1945 but did not have his first major work published until 1950, with the novel (or collection of linked stories) The Dying Earth, one of the most important works of fantasy of all time. I do very much recommend The Dying Earth: it’s very short, and yet is packed with what would become Vance’s trademark baroque prose, his sarcastic sense of humor, and his seemingly limitless invention. Vance wrote the stories that make up The Dying Earth in the mid-’40s, but could not get them published for some time, and indeed these stories read like nothing else in American fantasy at the time—not even Vance’s SF from the same period. You may read, for instance, Big Planet and not suspect that the same guy wrote bejeweled far-future fantasy, if going off the prose style (or rather the lack of it) and nothing else. I had covered Big Planet last May, as a much-needed reread, but for this May I reached for one of Vance’s lesser known novels, one which is sort of a B-side to Big Planet.\n\nBig Planet and Planet of the Damned were published mere months apart, and it’s likely they were also written in close succession. Unfortunately, as I had just implied, while Big Planet is the hit single, a real breakthrough for Vance as a world-builder, Planet of the Damned is the lower-effort B-side that smells of “second verse, same as the first.” But it’s not entirely lesser than its big (haha) brother, for there are a couple things Planet of the Damned at least tries to do better. Unfortunately this is not quite enough. Vance can either be pretty interesting or pretty dull (and honestly you have no way of knowing in advance), and this is a case of the latter.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the December 1952 issue of Space Stories, which is on the Archive. The publication of this novel is rather convoluted. The first book version is actually an abridgment, I assume so it could share one half of an Ace Double with Big Planet (that version of Big Planet was also shortened from the magazine version), and it was retitled Slaves of the Klau. We would eventually get a complete reprint of the magazine version, but it still kept the latter title. To make matters more confusing, Vance would revise it and retitle it again, this time as Gold and Iron, which is the version now in print. Have you lost track of it yet?\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nHumanity has come into contact with the Lekthwans, who have taken to sort of colonizing Earth benevolently, with the tradeoff being that humanity has gotten access to advanced Lekthwan technology. The Lekthwans themselves are basically humans but with golden skin, and by Earth standards are said to be conventionally attractive; it’s more their way of thinking that makes them alien, rather than their looks. The Lekthwans are sort of like proto-Vulcans, in that they see humans are lesser humanoids, given to irrationality and emotions and all those pesky things. At the very least the Lekthwans still have a sense of opulence, and they have their own conception of fun—which can’t be said for the other dominant humanoid race in the galaxy, the Klau. “The Klau are completely practical. Everything is planned for exact use, whether it makes people happy or not. There is no gaiety on the Klau worlds,” so a Lekthwan in the beginning tells us. Roy Barch is a grizzled tough guy working for Lekthwans on Earth who also happens to pine for his alien boss’s daughter, Komeitk Lelianr, who seems to take an interest in the human but who also makes it clear that said interest is not romantic. The opening section of the novel almost reads like a romance drama, and indeed bizarrely the novel could be considered a love story.\n\nBarch and “Ellen” (the human name he gives Komeitk Lelianr) are the obligatory man-woman couple at the novel’s center, which on its own would’ve been pretty standard for early ’50s SF, but to Vance’s credit he does add a twist or two that doesn’t strictly have to do with the fact that Barch has a boner for a gold-skinned space babe. Vance is not known for his female characters, but while I’m on the side of listing positives, Ellen has to be one of Vance’s more clearly defined and assertive women, even if it shouldn’t come as a surprise how she’ll ultimately feel about Barch. Ellen is aloof and condescending in the manner typical of her race, but unlike a lot of ’50s SF women she isn’t given to screaming or shrewish rantings, nor is she a pulpy action heroine in the making; rather, uncharacteristically for the time, she comes off as the Eeyore to Barch’s Winnie the Pooh. (That’s a weird comparison, but I hope you get my meaning here.) She’s cold, even fatalistic—not because she’s cowardly but because she thinks that’s just the way the world works. When Barch takes Ellen on a “date” she more or less berates him for thinking of her as something to be gained, as opposed to someone he might share his life with. “You may feel passion, but you feel no love,” she says. And initially she might be right on that. Their relationship is one that evolves organically—or at least more so than most attempts at romance from this period of genre SF.\n\nWhen the Klau raid Earth, killing most of the people around Our Heroes™ and taking the two as slaves to the labor planet Magarak, Ellen basically accepts it as her lot in life. The Klau hate the Lekthwans with a passion, but in their haste they seemed to confuse Ellen for a human, hence (probably) why she was taken prisoner. So Barch has to be the assertive one. Let’s talk about Roy Barch, or rather let’s not, since there isn’t much that can be said about him that doesn’t have to do with his relationship with Ellen or indeed his tenuous relationships with other aliens on Magarak. Barch is… more conventionally written, although that’s in the context of genre SF at the time; compared to some other Vance protagonists he’s rather unconventional. Vance’s heroes (or more often anti-heroes) tend to use their wit to get out of sticky situations, lacking the means to intimidate physically, whereas while Barch is by no means stupid, he’s certainly the brawn of the pair. He has suddenly found himself in a hostile environment, having escaped from a prison ship and taken refuge, along with Ellen, in a cave called Big Hole where other refugees hide out; and unlike someone like Cugel the Clever, Barch will have to twist some arms. And he has to deal with difference races with different cultural attitudes. “Thirteen different races, thirty-one different brains; thirteen basic mental patterns, thirty-one sub-varieties. An idea which aroused one would leave another indifferent.” Much of the novel will be concerned with this division.\n\nI brought it up before, but unfortunately I’ll have to bring it up again since the two novels were written and published so close together, and are both planetary adventures; but Planet of the Damned sadly lacks what made Big Planet captivating, even given that novel’s flaws. In the slightly earlier novel we’re introduced to a planet with an eccentric gravitational pull, size, and geological makeup, and so we’re introduced to some eccentric locations, wildlife, and human societies. The locale is the point of the damn thing, never mind that the plot is just a string of events with a dwindling party of stock characters. Magarak is nowhere near as interesting as Big Planet, in part because Vance spends far less time describing it, which makes me wonder where much of the wordage for either novel goes. If Big Planet is maybe 60,000 words then Planet of the Damned is maybe 50,000 words or just under that. (I’m referring again to the magazine versions.) The shorter novel feels longer somehow. It took me a few days to get through Big Planet while I’d say it took me about a week to read Planet of the Damned, and I suspect it was more of a slog because there was less to chew on. Similarly to Big Planet, Planet of the Damned has a random-events plot in which there is not subplot to speak of and in which the end goal is pretty simple: get the hell back to Earth. I’ve noticed that Vance tends to structure his novels episodically, with a single overarching plot or a series of plots rather than the traditional plot-plus-subplots method.\n\nAgain, all the aliens are some flavor of humanoid, and there isn’t much in the way of encountering non-humanoid life. We get that Magarak is a shithole but we aren’t given much insight into its ecosystem or how humanoids have adapted to it. Now, you may recall there are side characters in Big Planet, some of whom are fairly memorable; the same can’t be said of the side characters in this novel. Vance implies depth and diversity with the ensemble, but we get next to no time with these characters as individuals. Clef presents himself as the closest the novel has to a flesh-and-blood antagonist, but he gets killed off rather early on. Consider that the motley crew of Big Hole at one point gets boiled down to a list:\n\nThere were the three Splangs, Tick, Chevrr, Chevrr’s small dark woman; there was Kerbol and his dour gray mate; Flatface and his two quarreling bald half-breeds; the Calbyssinians, whose sex still remained mysterious; Pedratz, taffy-colored and smelling like a bull; Sl, the double-goer; Lkandeli Szet, the musician; the six silent Modoks; five Byathids; Moses, the dwarf; the handsome youth Moranko; the cat-like Griffits, who had silently asserted rights to the first two of Clef’s women; there was [Roy Barch] and Komeitk Lelianr.\n\nBut to bring the positive vibes back, there is at least the hinting of diversity, which is something Vance can be quite good at. Vance himself was a conservative, a fact which can rear its head in his fiction at times, but he was open to depicting people and societies with values very different from his and with a minimum of judgment—or at least a minimum of sarcasm. Vance can be dryly funny, and while there are a few jokes I noticed here it’s still less humorous than more characteristic Vance material. Vance’s trademark ornate language is also absent here, as also happened with Big Planet, replaced with a much more unassuming and unadorned prose style that could be charitably called “standard ’50s SF prose.” Vance had already written The Dying Earth at this point, so it’d be inaccurate to call the blandness of style here the result of a young writer finding his voice; rather it seems like Vance is trying to pass off as a robust but disposable pulp writer.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nBig Planet takes place a few weeks if I remember right, whereas the plot of Planet of the Damned unravels over the course of months—and then years. The good news is that Barch and his comrades are able to construct a ship out of basically scrap metal that can get some of them off the planet, but the bad news is that at some point (I’m not sure when this would’ve happened) Barch and Ellen had sex and now she’s pregnant with his child. Apparently humans and Lekthwans are genetically similar enough that they can crossbreed; this is a bit of hand-waving, but at least it’s explained in-story as something that can happen. (At one point early on Ellen becomes a willing concubine for Clef, and it’s implied they also have sex, but due to Clef being Klau the child be his—so we’re told.) I wanna take a moment to applaud Vance for going just slightly past what would’ve been the norm with this, since it would’ve been uncommon for human characters to actually have sexual relations with aliens at this point in SF writing. There would’ve been a fair bit of titillation, but it was mostly a “look, but don’t touch” deal. This revelation pushes a wedge between Barch and Ellen and by the climax they have parted ways, and when Barch leaves the planet he doesn’t know where his not-quite-girlfriend is. Had the story ended at this point, with the slaves successfully rebelling against the Klau on Magarak, it would’ve been a perfectly bittersweet ending.\n\nWhen Barch eventually returns to Earth he finds that he has become a sort of John Brown figure, a symbol of rebellion against the Klau; in that way he has become something of a celebrity. Unfortunately it’s also time now to reunite with Ellen, whom he has not seen in five years—and by extension his son, whom he has never seen before. “The child was a boy, and his skin was a pale clear gold. Komeitk Lelianr was quieter, thoughtful, though she looked a little older.” Barch and Ellen weren’t really a couple up to this point; there was always something in the way, either Ellen’s reluctance to treat Barch as an equal or simply bad circumstances. I would consider Planet of the Damned rather bland and depressingly average overall, but I do really like this ending. There’s this inversion where the main couple partake in what we think of as intimacy, but it’s only long after that initial encounter that they start to care enough about each other that they’re willing to take a big risk by raising their child together. It’s an interesting inversion of the traditional romance arc and it’s a good deal more mature than what most of the rest of the novel would lead you to believe. I would describe the ending as consciously optimistic, and that while he does phone it in for chunks of the novel, Vance does something kind of exceptional in the last handful of pages. I wonder if he had thought of the ending first and tried coming up with a serviceable plot that would get him from point A to point B.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nThere’s some debate as to what counts as Vance’s first novel, since The Dying Earth is more of a short story collection, and The Five Gold Bands is more of a novella by modern standards (though for the sake of this site I’m counting it as a “complete novel”). Big Planet would then be Vance’s first “true” novel, in which case Planet of the Damned would be the sophomore slump. If you were a genre reader in the ’50s you could be reading much worse, but also there’s not much one can get from Planet of the Damned past a space adventure which even at the time must’ve seemed surface-level. It doesn’t show Vance as the unique voice that he was, nor does it build on the intricacies of Big Planet. A minor shame.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nAliette de Bodard was born in the US, but raised in France to Vietnamese parents, such that French is her first language but she writes her fiction in English. This cultural mix perhaps inspired one of the most unique alternate/future histories to come about in the past couple decades. Her defining series, of which today’s story is a part, shows us an altered human history in which the Chinese discovered America before a certain Italian son of a bitch could get there, with the Americas changing in major ways politically and sociologically. “The Jaguar House, in Shadow” was de Bodard’s first story to garner a Hugo nomination, and indeed shows a leap forward in ambition, especially in terms of its structure. The story’s back-and-forth narrative ends up being a double-edged sword, but it remains an effective tale of friendship, betrayal, and revenge.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the July 2010 issue of Asimov’s Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It has since been reprinted in English twice, in Nebula Awards Showcase 2012 (ed. James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel), and the de Bodard collection Of Wars, and Memories, and Starlight.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nWe start with a scene all in italics, and we’re not told who the viewpoint character is other than that it’s “she.” (Mind you all three of the main characters are women.) The beginning reminded me of the opium-induced haze at the start of Once Upon a Time in America, although in this case it’s magic mushrooms rather than opium, “teonanácatl.” We then flash back… then flash back again… then flash forward… then flash back… then forward again. That’s how it generally goes. We’re quickly faced with this story unique quality, for both good and ill, which is the jumping back and forth along a timeline, tracing the friendship between three friends and members of the Jaguar House: Onalli, Xochitl, and Tecipiani. Some stories in the Xuya universe are space opera, but this one is not: we’re firmly set on Earth, more specifically in Mexico—a Mexico that is quite different from what we now recognize. The actual year in which the story takes place is vague, and at first you might even think it’s some fantasy realm, with the mentioning of Houses, warriors, and some real cloak-and-dagger espionage; but also there are computers, and even nanomachines. Evidently true artificial intelligence has not come about yet, although Xochitl does speculate on it at one point, in perhaps the single most memorable passage in the story and one which seems deliberately to foreshadow the spacefaring antics of stories happening later in the timeline:\n\nXochitl wonders what kind of intelligence computers will develop, when they finally breach the gap between automated tasks and genuine sentience—all that research done in military units north of the border, eyeing the enemy to the south.\n\nThey’ll be like us, she thinks. They’ll reach for their equivalent of clubs or knives, claiming it’s just to protect themselves; and it won’t be long until they sink it into somebody’s chest.\n\nJust like us.\n\nThe Jaguar House is one of what used to be several Houses in the region, each of which had fallen for one reason or another. This is a land of “true Mexica” meeting with would-be colonizers—not Europeans but south-east Asians, “though Onalli, who’s half and half, could almost pass for Asian herself.” The perspective shifts back and forth between Onalli and Xochitl, and at the same time we’re jumping between flashbacks, which makes it a challenge to discuss the story’s plot. I have to admit I also occasionally got Onalli and Xochitl confused, which is not helped by the two women not having easily distinguishable personalities. Going into “The Jaguar House, in Shadow,” I was expecting a novelette since that’s what this issue of Asimov’s classifies it as (by the way, the page number in the table of contents is wrong), but if it’s a novelette then it barely counts. Granted, these are a dense dozen or so magazine pages, but if anything I would’ve preferred if de Bodard had made it into a heartier novelette. Not every scene gets proper breathing space and the main characters are not given equal attention, although in the case of Tecipiani the ambiguity of her thoughts and feelings seems to have been intentional. “Tecipiani does what she believes in; but you’re never sure what she’s truly thinking,” Xochitl thinks.\n\nThe three start as knights of the House, but Tecipiani gets promoted to commander, to where she is giving her friends orders. Worse yet, there’s been tension brewing within the House—talks of rebellion against the Revered Speaker, who’s said to have become corrupt. Xochitl is involved in this would-be rebellion, with tragic results. Onalli is torn, ultimately, between two friends, one of whom is likely to be killed, the other quickly becoming little more than a stranger to her. It’s a good conflict, and could’ve feasibly worked in a medieval fantasy setting; but de Bodard is equally interested in the world these characters inhabit, which is decidedly science fiction. This is very much a “What if?” scenario. “What if the Puritans never landed in what is now New England? What if the colonial Chinese set up camp in the Americas ahead of even the Spanish? How much would technological development change? Who would be in charge?” It’s not wish-fulfillment. The Americas are not necessarily better off in Chinese hands, nor worse; but the differences would be profound. Maybe humanity really will start conquering the stars, but then maybe the problems of feudalism and oligarchy would remain. At one point, in a rather throwaway passage, there’s mention of “revivalists” among the pure Mexica who believe in human sacrifice, something which would be unthinkable in our timeline. It’s this sort of detail that keeps bringing me back to de Bodard’s Xuya stories.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nWe’ve deduced by now that Tecipiani is the one in the beginning and ending scenes with the magic mushrooms—the one who turned her back on her friends in the name of realpolitik. We don’t know what happened with Onalli, after she had fled with a dying Xochitl in her arms. The story ends on a sign of uncertainty in everything, except for guilt. Tecipiani is unsure if the betrayal was worth it. The question lingering at the end is one of emotional loyalty, but also one of political loyalty: the state versus the individual. Which is more valuable, stability or freedom? Tecipiani’s mindset is that by keeping the Jaguar House afloat she can avert the bad ends that befell the other Houses, but in-story we’re not given much evidence to believe society would suddenly turn dystopic if the Jaguar House were to fall—i.e., if a vestige of “law and order” were to give way to anarchy. I could be biased, but if anything I saw the implication that the Jaguar House deserves to fall—that it has somehow become rotten from the inside, ready to sink into a swamp, like the House of Usher. The beginning is finally given context and at the same time the anachronic points of the story finally meet, like two ends of a circle. It’s at times confusing, but I have to say the climactic confrontation and the very end are well done.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nDe Bodard would’ve been 25 or 26 when she wrote this one, still very early in her career, and while it shows the roughness of a young writer finding her voice it’s also an intriguing and emotionally effective thriller that would’ve introduced readers to a world decidedly different from ours, but not necessarily utopian or dystopian—just different. Even at this early point de Bodard’s control of mood and worldbuilding has to be admired. Her blending of SF and fantasy elements reminds me of Jack Vance on a good day. And speaking of Vance… he’s due next.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nPhilip K. Dick is arguably both the funniest and scariest writer to emerge from the early ’50s genre SF boom. He wanted to write full-time for a living, and as a result he wrote at a mile a minute; he would wrote some 120 short stories, about a quarter of which would be published in 1953 alone. “The Defenders” is one of those stories. I’ll say upfront that this is not top-tier Dick, although it is curious for a few reasons and I do have to recommend it. For one, this was the first Dick story to make the cover of a magazine, hence the memorable Ed Emshwiller illustration. It’s also one of only two Dick stories to get adapted for the SF radio series X Minus One, the other being the bone-chilling (and darkly humorous) “Colony.” “The Defenders” and “Colony” were published in Galaxy Science Fiction, which had partnered with X Minus One such that the latter often adapted stories from the former’s pages. Despite being so prolific in the ’50s, Dick only appeared in Galaxy a handful of times while H. L. Gold was editor, apparently because (as often happened with Gold) the two did not get along. Gold had a reputation for meddling with authors’ manuscripts, and indeed there’s a sense of meddling with today’s story. Gold shouldn’t feel too bad, though: Dick would appear in Astounding only a single time.\n\nAnother couple things. “The Defenders” reads like a companion piece to “Second Variety,” which I reviewed a minute ago. Both stories cover basically the same topic, and given that they were published five months or so apart it’s safe to say Dick wrote them in close succession; but apart from having similar premises they’re very different stories. More importantly is that Dick would cannibalize the premise and twist of “The Defenders” for the much later novel The Penultimate Truth, and if you know the twist of that novel then you can safely guess the twist of this story. I won’t say what the twist is here, but it’s not hard to figure out.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the January 1953 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. “The Defenders” wouldn’t see book publication until Invasion of the Robots (ed. Roger Elwood). Other anthology appearances include There Will Be War (ed. John F. Carr and Jerry Pournelle), Battlefields Beyond Tomorrow: Science Fiction War Stories (ed. Martin H. Greenberg and Charles G. Waugh), and Sense of Wonder: A Century of Science Fiction (ed. Leigh Ronald Grossman). It’s also in *checks notes* every other Dick collection you can think of. To make things even better, it’s fallen out of copyright, so you can read it on Project Gutenberg here.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThe Cold War went hot eight years ago, with Americans and Soviets having since burrowed underground, hunkering in shelters while the robots, “leadys,” continue to fight the good fight on the surface. The humans would do the fighting themselves, but nuclear fallout from the war’s beginning has rendered the surface uninhabitable—we know this because of newsreel footage and newspaper photos taken of the surface, the leadys keeping humanity updated on a war that seemingly has no end point. “Nobody wanted to live this way, but it was necessary.” Don Taylor is part of his bunker’s military personnel, although despite being in touch with the top brass the higher-ups don’t have a better idea of what’s going on aboveground than Taylor does. (I should probably take a moment to mention that Taylor’s wife, Mary, is in the classic Dick mold, in that she’s rather shrewish. Do not do a drinking challenge where you take a shot every time Dick writes a miserable couple wherein the husband has to put up with his unpleasant wife or ex-wife. What do you mean Dick was already divorced once at this point?) The higher-ups sometimes interrogate leadys to get a more direct line to what’s going on above, but this only goes so far. Nobody, at least on this side, has been to the surface in eight years.\n\nThe leadys are the most curious part of the story that isn’t the twist, being shown in the Emshwiller cover. They’re called “leadys” because their lead shells protect them from the radiation on the surface, although they have to be decontaminated every time one is brought underground. It’s also unclear just how they work in the ethical sense, since they’re programmed to not knowingly harm humans—or at least humans on the right side of the conflict, depending. This raises the question of what exactly the leadys are good for, aside from maybe fighting other leadys. Dick seems to conform to Asimov’s three laws of robotics, but he doesn’t delve deep into the matter. The humans bring down a leady for questioning one day and find, to their surprise, that the leady is not radioactive, nor does its chassis have the intense heat of radiation. Don and his superiors figure something must be up, although they can’t be sure what, since as far as they’ve been torn war continues to wage on the surface. But then why no radiation? It’ll be risky, but it looks like humans will be going to the surface for the first time since the war went hot—in leaded clothing, of course. Taylor, his superiors, and a platoon of men plan to go up, but a team of leadys tries to stop them—a fruitless effort, given that the leadys are programmed to not kill humans and so have no way to keep them from going through the Tube.\n\nIt’s hard to discuss “The Defenders” without also discussing the twist, but I do wanna point out a couple other things. As is typical of Dick’s early work (with exceptions), the characters aren’t really characters in the Shakespearian sense so much as they exist because the narrative demands human players. Moss and Franks, Taylor’s superiors, are basically interchangeable. Past their immediate circumstances we get to learn nothing about these people. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Dick would become far more ambitious in psychoanalyzing his characters later on, but even at this very early stage there are a few Dick hallmarks that are comforting for the returning fan, sure, but they also serve a purpose. We know life underground is miserable because despite being in a position of authority, Taylor’s life still kinda sucks. The standard Dick protagonist leads an unfulfilled and claustrophobic existence, and this applies even to characters with power, as if to show the hollowness of wanting to acquire power for the sake of itself. Also, as is typical of Dick, the prose is often beige and economical. “The Defenders” just barely qualifies as a novelette, and it feels even shorter than that. Again, not a bad thing. I would’ve had a worse time with this story, given its setup-twist nature, had it overstayed its welcome. I also wanna say the X Minus One adaptation is perfectly decent, much like the source material; it mostly sticks to the short story, with ultimately inconsequential deviations.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nIn one of his books of genre criticism (I forget which one), James Blish lists “The Defenders” as an example of a story whose very existence hinges on its twist, although he doesn’t elaborate on this particular story. He’s undoubtedly accurate with the call, though. If you read early Galaxy you’ll come across a lot of great short SF—indeed some of the best of its kind, certainly in the context of the early ’50s. There were also a lot of setup-punchline stories, and while these weren’t necessarily bad, they could be tiring. Robert Sheckley made a name for himself at the outset with this type of story, but even then it’s clear that he eventually got tired of the routine. Dick could also fall into this trap, and “The Defenders” might be the most setup-punchline of his story; no wonder it would be printed in Galaxy, with Gold having a fondness (really too fond) for just this type of story. And if you know The Penultimate Truth then you already knew what was coming. It turns out the war had basically been over for almost as long as the humans had been living underground. The leadys had been working on reconstructing the surface world whilst feeding the humans (on both sides) false information. That’s right, fake news was a thing in the ’50s! On the one hand this is very much a Dick idea, one he would even return to later; but the execution and implication tell me that either this twist was half-baked or Dick originally had something else in mind but changed it (or maybe Gold changed it) for the sake of appearing in Galaxy.\n\nTo elaborate, if there’s one thing Dick does unconvincingly in my experience it’s a happy ending. I’m thinking of Eye in the Sky, arguably the best of his ’50s novels, which while still being an entertaining and mind-bending read, has a tacked-on happy ending that fails to convince. The leadys destroy the Tube and prevent the team of humans from returning underground, leaving them to cooperate with the Soviets for what will probably be several years. “The working out of daily problems of existence will teach you how to get along in the same world,” the top leady says. This is all swell, but it also assumes the leadys really do have the humans’ best interests at heart, which strikes me as fundamentally uncharacteristic for Dick. Contrast this with “Second Variety,” in which the Cold War goes hot, there’s a nuclear holocaust, but the robots are more sinister there. In “The Defenders” the leadys are like a benevolent dictatorship, or Plato’s philosopher king wrapped in iron. You can see what the problem is. This is really out of step with Dick’s generally ambivalent attitude toward robots and automation at large; it’s like he tried to write an Asimov or Simak robot story. And yet it must be said that the twist on its own is good enough that you could do a lot more with it, so it’s unsurprising that Dick would cannibalize it. Still, I found myself feeling underwhelmed by the reveal.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nWhen Dick started out writing professionally he submitted to seemingly every market in the early ’50s, and with a few exceptions he appeared in nearly every genre magazine that would’ve been active in 1953. Sometimes he phoned it in and sometimes you get the feeling the Philip K. Dick we recognize was still in utero. “The Defenders” is very early Dick and feels less Dick-y than the stories previously covered, and of the three it’s easily my least favorite. I recommend it still, but more as a sign of the time and place in which it was written than as a sign of Dick’s genius; for that I’d point towards “Second Variety,” which as I said earlier starts out very similarly to “The Defenders” but goes in a much darker direction. “The Defenders” is an indicative Cold War SF story that happens to have been written by someone who would move on to bigger and better things—something seasoned Dickheads would not find so impressive.\n\nSee you next time."
