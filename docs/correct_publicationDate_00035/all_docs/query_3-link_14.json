        "text": "Who are the STRANGERS AMONG US?\n\nWe are your fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, friends and lovers. We staff your stores, cross your streets, and study in your schools, invisible among you. We are your outcasts and underdogs, and often, your unsung heroes.\n\nNineteen science fiction and fantasy authors tackle the division between mental health and mental illness; how the interplay between our minds’ quirks and the diverse societies and cultures we live in can set us apart, or must be concealed, or become unlikely strengths.\n\nWe find troubles with Irish fay, a North Korean cosmonaut’s fear of flying, an aging maid dealing with politics of revenge, a mute boy and an army of darkness, a sister reaching out at the edge of a black hole, the dog and the sleepwalker, and many more.\n\nAfter all, what harm can be done . . .\n\nWe recognize that not everyone has the resources to buy this anthology, Strangers Among Us: Tales of the Underdogs and Outcasts. Since mental health is such an important subject, please help us to reach as many readers as possible. Our dream is to have every library in the world having this anthology available for its library users.\n\nWe realize that library worldwide has limited budget, so we offer perpetual licensing of our e-book to libraries through Overdrive (i.e. we do not restrict the number of times an ebook can be lent in order not to force libraries to repurchase the same ebook over and over). Also available through cloudLibrary (Bibliotheca)\n\nOne easy way you can help us is to submit or suggest this title to your local library (if this book resonates with you). It takes only a few minutes to complete online.\n\nWhat you need for the library:\n\nTitle: Strangers Among Us: Tales of the Underdogs and Outcasts\n\nAuthor: Edited by Susan Forest and Lucas K. Law\n\nISBN:9780993969645 (HC), 9780993969607 (PB), 9780993969614 (eBook)\n\nPublisher: Laksa Media Groups Inc.\n\nNotes/Comments: The anthology (dealing with mental health/mental illness) has been recommended by Library Journal, Kirkus Reviews, School Library Journal, Locus, and Foreword Reviews. Also available through Overdrive and cloudLibrary (eBook: 9780993969614)\n\nHelp Us to Change the World, One Book at A Time"
