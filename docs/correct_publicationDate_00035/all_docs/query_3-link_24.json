        "text": "More stuff from the archive regarding Vernor Vinge though, in this case, he’s just a small part of a big anthology.\n\nRaw Feed (2002): Explorers: SF Adventures to Far Horizons, ed. Gardner Dozois, 2000.\n\n“Preface”, Gardner Dozois — Brief look at the theme of exploration stories in world literature and exploration stories in sf. Dozois notes that the theme wanes and blooms in interest amongst writers. Ironically, when real space exploration, at least of the manned variety, was winding down, space exploration stories in sf were picking up. They used the new scientific findings for romantic and adventure stories set in space like the old planetary romances used uncontradicted speculations.\n\n“The Sentinel”, Arthur C. Clarke — This is at least the second time I’ve read this story which I did not remembered being set in 1996.\n\n“Moonwalk”, H. B. Fyfe — A man against nature tale that reminded me strongly of Jack London, particularly his “Building a Fire”, and the true story of mountain man John Colter. This 1952 story has the sole survivor of a lunar tractor accident walking away from it, trying to find help from his fellow explorers far away before his oxygen gives out. (His wife is one of the members of the lunar base.) Fyfe even throws in some grandiose descriptions of the lunar landscape.\n\n“Grandpa”, James H. Schmitz — The only other time I’ve read this story is about 25 years ago, but I remembered most of it. It’s still a clever story of the unraveling-a-deadly-secret-of-an-alien-ecosystem variety. It does, however, make me want to read more of Schmitz. He strikes me as just as clever at working out alien ecosystems.\n\n“The Red Hills of Summer”, Edgar Pangborn — This is the first Pangborn I’ve read, and I can see why he’s a neglected favorite of critics and writers. It’s not that the plot of this story — a survey team exploring a planet for possible colonization by people fleeing an Earth contaminated by atomic warfare — is that remarkable. It’s the characterization of the narrator and his beloved Miranda, the fairly well-worked out alien ecosystem and especially the evocative, moody prose with such phrases as “the snarling statistics of mortality” and “the shadow of private unhappiness” that makes it special. I’ll probably seek out more Pangborn including West of the Sun which is an expansion of this story.\n\n“The Longest Voyage”, Poul Anderson — This is at least the third time I’ve read this excellent Anderson story. I noticed two additional things this time. First was the use of names that had analogous resonances with place names important to explorers in the Age of Magellan (the obvious inspiration for this story). Thus the Aureate Cities suggest El Dorado and the island empire of Hisagazi sounds rather Japanese. I also found it interesting that self-described “nineteenth century liberal” (at least that was the way Anderson described himself in the 1990s — I don’t know if his politics were the same in 1960 when this story was published) has the society of his space traveler Val Nira sound very much like a rationalistic, centrally-planned techno utopia: a leisured republic whose rulers are chosen by exam and where criminals are cured via therapeutic means and war is unknown. Thus the story’s end, when protagonist Rovic destroys Val Nira’s ship so that the people of his world will not only be denied the great knowledge of starfaring humans elsewhere (Rovic’s world is basically a lost colony on its way up from barbarism) but also gain the purpose and self-respect of discovering that knowledge themselves, just might be seen as a commentary by Anderson on the demoralizing consequences of the welfare state.\n\n“Hot Planet”, Hal Clement — An enjoyable 1963 hard sf story (what else, from Clement?) about exploring a volcanic Mercury. As Dozois notes, science has invalidated the whole story with new data about Mercury, but, at the time, this was a scientifically accurate sf story.\n\n“Drunkboat”, Cordwainer Smith — This 1963 story from Smith exhibits his usual linguistic playfulness and odd structure. It’s quite a while before we even figure out what Rambo is supposed to have done; the story’s beginning is about the possible motives and credits for Rambo’s accomplishment but not what it is. It’s plot — a man forced by circumstances to develop a sort of teleportation — reminded me of Alfred Bester’s earlier The Stars My Destination. This is the first of Smith’s stories that actually explain what the Instrumentality is: self-organizing aristocrats who govern themselves and others by a strict code which still allows a lot of flexibility (and a lot of potential to be put to death for violating its spirit). The code is:\n\nWatch, but do not govern; stop war but do not wage it; protect, but do not control; and first, survive!\n\nThe “robotic telepathy” and open and secret communications nets of the Two Minutes’ War also seem to me to be a sort of proto-cyberpunk motif (like parts of The Stars My Destination) and also prefigure, a bit, the secret programs in Vernor Vinge’s A Deepness in the Sky. (July 24, 2002)\n\n“Becalmed in Hell”, Larry Niven — An ok story. I mostly liked it for the hard sf description of Venus and the idea (I don’t know how new it was in 1965, the date of the story’s publication) of a cyborg spaceship pilot (specifically, just a stripped brain and spinal column) and, particularly, the idea that such a cyborg might have psychosomatic problems with his interface with the ship. Niven does a nice job with the dialogue between the narrator and the pilot, keeping its conflict controlled, terse, and understated as befits a crew in tight quarters who must work together.\n\n“Nine Hundred Grandmothers”, R. A. Lafferty — As is typical, I’m given to understand, with Lafferty, this strange, entertaining story of a quest for immortality is perhaps a morality tale, perhaps satire, and a cross between a fairy tale and sf.\n\n“The Keys to December”, Roger Zelazny — Zelazny, I’m reminded yet again, was a master story teller who used so many styles in his stories, and here he shows the influence of his wide reading in poetry (a concluding paragraph that is a slight restating of the first). I liked a lot of things in this story besides its style. (Its Catform protagonists designed to work on a world destroyed by a nova possibly influenced William Barton’s When We Were Real.) It’s of the subgenre (like George R. R. Martin’s “Sandkings” and Barry B. Longyear’s “Adagio”) of a man becoming a god to aliens. Protagonist Jarry Dark, after the violent death of his lover Sanza, accepts the glories and duties of being a god to the Redforms. Eventually, he accepts a contract with them much like pagan gods of old did with their followers. He turns on his own kind to slow the terraforming of December because he owes the Redforms, becoming sentient and toolmaking (partly because of the quick altering of December’s climate and partly because the altercation between Dark, Sanza, and a large, native predator put the idea of tool using into the head of an advanced Redform), for keeping his memory alive and singing his name. That’s the only purpose in his life after Sanza’s death. I also liked the moral dilemma of the Catforms, physically alienated from any habitat in the universe, possibly killing off a sentient race to gain a homeland.\n\n“Vaster Than Empires and More Slow”, Ursula K. Le Guin — The title comes after the line in Andrew Marvell’s poem “To His Coy Mistress” that mentions “vegetable love”, and its penultimate paragraph also quotes the poem. I actually liked this story quite a bit, a first in Le Guin’s work that I’ve read. I liked the idea of planetary survey teams being composed of neurotics and crazy people, albeit crazy people who can tolerate each other’s quirks. All, that is, except for empath Sensor Osden, who picks up people’s instinctive wariness to strangers and feeds it back making them increasingly suspicious, wary, and hateful toward him. I liked this take on empathy rather than on the more usual one of cursed empath who just feels the world’s pain or has to escape society (though there is some of that here). However, Le Guin’s liberalism does show up a bit with the implication, by Tomiko’s thoughts about dealing with Osden at story’s end, that the Other can always be met and tamed with love rather than the possibility that, sometimes the Other must be fought.\n\n“A Meeting With Medusa”, Arthur C. Clarke — I thoroughly enjoyed this trip through Jupiter’s atmosphere and the look at its imagined ecosystem the second time I read it. In this story, Clarke has whirling lights in the atmosphere of Jupiter which are explicitly said to be like the “Wheels of Poseidon” sighted in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. These underwater whirling lights are mentioned in Charles Fort’s The Book of the Damned (Clarke mentions one of the same incidents cited by Fort.)\n\n“The Man Who Walked Home”, James Tiptree, Jr. — I’ve always thought, in my brief exposure to her work, that Tiptree was an overrated writer, and this story does nothing to change that opinion. The middle part of the story, a post-apocalypse tale spanning centuries and telling of the yearly appearance of a time traveler (moving backwards in time) was interesting. However, Tiptree throws on an overly long ending and beginning told from the point of view of the time traveler. The beginning was needlessly obscure and too long. Presumably it was there to hook the reader through mystification. The ending viewpoint was ok but still too long. Fortunately, unless it’s the obscure and, I suppose, presumptively cute dialogue with Serli, Laban, and Mira (I suspect many writers and critics like Tiptree for her alleged subtlety which is really obscureness much of the time), the story is spares us any of Tiptree’s usual feminist themes.\n\n“Long Shot”, Vernor Vinge — An involving story of an artificial intelligence shepherding, over centuries, a load of frozen human embryos to a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri. If Vinge’s intent was to suspensefully hide the nature of the cargo, he failed since it was fairly obvious (we’re told the mission is dispatched from a desperate Earth). However, this sort of story works on its many details and tone, and Vinge had a firm command of each. Computer scientist Vinge interestingly has the probe split its mind into three parts to catch possible processing errors. I don’t know if this technique was as yet untried in the real world of 1972, year of the story’s publication, or not.\n\n“In the Hall of the Martian Kings”, John Varley — This is the first time I’ve read this classic tale. Dozois, in his introductory notes, says the story may well have led, after its publication in 1977, to the rebirth of the Martian sf story. The engineered plastic plants and “animals” remind one of later nanotechnology stories (particularly Kevin Anderson’s and Doug Beason’s Assemblers of Infinity), but this story was from the seventies when genetic engineering, with some technical rigor behind it, was becoming a major theme, and, as Gregory Benford has pointed out, genetic engineering may eventually give us most of what nanotechnology promises. Other noticeable — and annoying aspects — of seventies’ sf show up. The forced colonists of Mars go through nearly all the possible (except, it’s interesting to note, male homosexuality) sexual combinations — which is perhaps realistic except for the time span of about a week. The latter may be partially the influence of Robert A. Heinlein who Varley admires. And Varley himself was one of the writers responsible for putting strong women and sex into a lot of influential seventies’ sf. The story does make it fairly clear that the aliens who have created this elaborate Martian ecosystem have visited Earth in man’s early prehistory. (An alternate explanation for the ecosystem is given though.) However, it is left rather unclear whether they live on Mars or just set the ecosystem up to provide for man when he arrives. I also thought what incidents Varley chose to depict in the approximately twelve-year span of his story was interesting (basically a few key incidents until it is found out that the Martian plants provide oxygen and then skipping ahead to the arrival of an expedition from Earth).\n\n“Ginungagap”, Michael Swanwick — This 1980 story, either Swanwick’s first or second published story (Dozois’ introductory notes on this are a bit unclear), was published in something called TriQuarterly 49 which, if memory serves me right, is a literary magazine. Like James P. Hogan’s “Assassin” and, to a lesser extent, Aldris Budrys’ Rogue Moon and Clifford D. Simak’s Goblin Reservation, this story takes the philosophical issues of identity involved in transporting humans via a matter transporter (here the information about an organisms is broken into a long-chain polymer molecule which is sent through a wormhole — Swanwick carefully does not describe the mechanisms for converting the encoded information into a body; a separate transmission is done to cover the electrolyte balance in the original body). The situation, humans not knowing if they can trust an alien race enough to send a human through their matter transmitter, also reminded me of the wary alien-human meeting in Murray Leinster’s “First Contact”. Dozois notes that this story can be seen as a precursor cyberpunk story. here’s some truth to that in that the story is set in a world of highly competitive jobs and dominated by corporations where the consequences of information theory (including, of course, treating humans as just a type of bundled information) is present. However, the tone of “high-tech, low-life” (as the famous description of cyberpunk goes) is not there. I liked how protagonist Abigail Vanderhoeks extracts herself from a dangerous situation on Mars: she pores cryogenic oxygen on her arm and deliberately shatters it. Also noteworthy was the extremely calculating and manipulative character of Paul Girard. He is always considering ploys and counterploys to see what the alien “spiders” are up to. Part of that is manipulating Abigail with words and sexual desire. He sort of falls of love with her. Yet he can’t stop himself from using his real concern that her traveling and being reassembled in the matter transmission will result in her real death as a way of testing her suitability for the final step. The story never does really answer the central question of whether the Abigail at story’s end is the same Abigail (as she maintains with her “weak body image”) or an identical but different Abigail (as Paul believes — he explicitly tells the Abigail at the end that the old Abigail is dead).\n\n“Exploring Fossil Canyon“, Kim Stanley Robinson — This is the second time I’ve read this story from Robinson’s Mars cycle (this one takes place on a terraformed Mars but not the one of Robinson’s Mars trilogy). Once again, I was impressed by Robinson’s use of scientific principles and nomenclature as metaphors and characterization devices. This time, I realized, when protagonist Eileen Monday thought about all the literary tales set on Mars, the line about “no plastic windmill-creatures” is an allusion to John Varley’s “In the Hall of the Martian Kings”.\n\n“Promises to Keep“, Jack McDevitt — A melancholy story from McDevitt about the disastrous return of an expedition to Callisto and how one crewmember, a journalist bent on getting a Pulitzer Prize for her artful reporting about the expedition, sacrifices herself in despair so that the rest of the survivors will have enough air to return to Earth or, alternately, puts on a very good act that will make her a martyr and promote a rescue expedition and future space exploration developments. The question still isn’t resolved at story’s end when the narrator, a member of the expedition, is about to return to space to rescue her — if she’s still alive after more than six years.\n\n“Lieserl“, Stephen Baxter — Slight story about a woman engineered to live in the sun (after her physical death, her mind is transferred into a habitat in the sun’s photosphere) and see what’s gone wrong with it. (This may be part of Baxter’s Xeelee sequence since it’s said someone is “killing” the sun, and, I believe, some alien in that universe has the power to do that.) I really wasn’t that moved by the character’s central plight: aging a year every day. The exact reason for the speed of her aging wasn’t made clear.\n\n“Crossing Chao Meng Fu“, G. David Nordley — This is a genuine sense-of-wonder story about an expedition to cross an icy plain in a permanently shaded crater on Mercury. No life is found there, no alien artifact. The expedition could be done by robot, but the explorers want to go because it’s there, exploring reality instead of seeing the world mediated by a videoscreen. The poet-literature professor narrator unexpectedly finds an ancient exploring spirit awakened in his overweight, out of shape body. He also proves to have an unexpectedly quick mind in emergencies and very useful powers of observation. He mainly goes on the expedition to get himself a spot on a possible future expedition to Miranda. His prose is self-deprecating and realistic, exactly what you would expect a man in his situation, discovering unknown desires (including for a fellow explorer) and depths in the wilderness. There is an odd interlude with one woman describing her circumcision and inability to have normal sex. Nordley is unimpressed with the idea of protecting “primitive cultures from ‘western interference'”\n\n“Wang’s Carpets”, Greg Egan — Another austere existential story from Egan. This seems to be either set in the same future as his novel Diaspora or an excerpt from that novel. I believe he once described that novel as “space opera for ais”. Well, if it’s space opera, it’s a peculiarly Eganesque one, a story where it is not racial extinction or alien menace that is battled but ennui. The central conflict of the story is nothing less than man’s purpose in a godless universe; more specifically, it deals with the concept of anthrocosmology (also used in his novel Distress). In a future of human consciousnesses edited and cloned and placed in machine bodies and synthetic bodies and an endless quantity of virtual realities (one character is said to have been “scanned” into machinehood back in the 21st century), posthumans have established “polises”. Some communities have embraced the anthrocosmological idea that the universe exists as the result of human thought. These same communities usually see little wrong with embracing life in virtual realities and bodies of their choosing. The man group in this story are their ideological opponents. They try to maintain their ties to the physical universe and seek intelligent aliens that will refute the anthrocosmological principle. They eventually find the strange alien life known, eventually (after a 20th century mathematician) as Wang’s Carpets. At first, they just appear to be primitive life inhabiting the ocean of a world where the ecosystem never evolved the variety to generate lots of internal selection pressure. Then it turns out that the Carpets are very sophisticated and living computers whose complexly folded shapes allow them to inhabit sixteen dimensions (Egan, in narrative sleight-of-hand, doesn’t even attempt to offer an explanation as to why the Carpets get to seemingly violate/bend the laws of physics to inhabit so many more dimensions than the posthumans — I think that’s a flaw in his otherwise quite hard sf tale). The story ends on an ambiguous note. As the story explicitly says, the question of anthrocosmology’s validity is unanswered. Intelligent alien life has been found, but it is uncommunitive and has sealed itself off (floating in the oceans of its world) from the physical world into virtual worlds created by its vast computations.\n\n“A Dance to Strange Musics”, Gregory Benford — This is the second time I’ve read this story, and I still think it’s a classic sf story, the second to last paragraph is one of the best I’ve read in sf. After reading Greg Egan’s “Wang’s Carpets” right before, I can’t help wondering how much that story influenced this one published three years later. (Dozois is a perceptive enough editor that he must have noticed the similarities, but he doesn’t comment on them.) Both stories deal with man’s first discovery of life outside of the solar system, lifeforms that happen to make up giant biological computing facilities. Benford’s tale has the advantage on several points. His story is more action-filled and told in cleaner, less opaque terminology (Egan’s tale reminds me of something a modern Olaf Stapledon might have chosen to write if he wanted to do a closeup story on part of one of his vast timelines. It’s philosophically interesting. But it’s not easy going or action filled.). Benford’s ecosystem is more elaborate, interesting (powered by piezoelectric forces generated by the orbital forces in the Alpha Centauri system rather than sunlight), and realistic (no resorting to multiple dimensions like Egan, just the physical laws of our known three dimensions). Both stories feature the utter alienness of the lifeforms. Benford’s explorers are not posthuman. They are flesh and blood like us, but, after too closely studying the intelligences on Shiva, they allow themselves to be absorbed (or, perhaps, imitate) its group mind. The second expedition to Shiva is horrified by this, wants to understand how they were suborned and submerged and merged, but eventually they realize that to study the problem too closely is to risk the same fate. Egan’s explorers are already posthuman and have something like the groupmind of Shiva’s inhabitants. They want to know the next step in man’s development should be. Benford’s explorers cannot even approach the question that closely without being swallowed by the alien. Egan’s explorers have their ultimate question unanswered. Benford’s explorers, those of the second expedition, leave feeling diminished. Benford quotes the famous line about not gazing into the abyss because it gazes back at you. n alternate version of the story is entitled “A Pit Which Has No Bottom”."
