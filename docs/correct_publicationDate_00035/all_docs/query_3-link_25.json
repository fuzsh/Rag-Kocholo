        "text": "What I'm Reading: Foundation\n\nIt's Leap Day, so I am going to give you an extra post. First, as I mentioned here, I read Foundation by Isaac Asimov for a staff meeting assignment. We were asked to read the first book in a science fiction series and then talk about who would read the book.\n\nI picked Foundation for a few reasons:\n\nI don't usually read \"hard\" space set science fiction. I much prefer dystopian or apocalyptic sf, sf set on earth, or slightly lighter and more character centered sf like Orson Scott Card or Connie Willis. Reading Foundation offered me an opportunity to explore an unfamiliar subgenre.\n\nIf I was going to read an unfamiliar subgenre of sf, at least I could try to read one I knew was universally considered a classic. In fact, I asked my favorite sf reading patron, Mr. Smith (his real name, not a pseudonym) for a recommendation of a \"hard science fiction novel set in space that is also the start of a series.\" He first suggested Dune, which I had read many years ago, but then the Foundation series was his next suggestion.\n\nThe Foundation series is also a great example of a general problem with series in sf-- it is sometimes very difficult to identify \"The First\" book in a series. Especially with older, classic series, the order in which the author first wrote and published them is not the current official order. For example, Foundation was written as a trilogy with it being the first one. However, there is also a companion trilogy, prequels and post scripts to the series now. So there is always a question as to which is the first book. In this case, since Foundation started it all, I chose to read that novel and then made sure to mention this issue in my book talk to the staff.\n\nSo that is why I read it. But what did I think? Therein lies yet another problem. There are so many reviews and opinions about this classic novel that I am a bit gun shy about adding my novice opinion to the pile; but I think if I set up the context of how this review can be used to help a patron today, my words can be of use to another reader.\n\nI am offering this review not as a statement on the quality of this novel, but rather as a comment upon what type of reader, walking into the library in 2012 would be most interested in this book.\n\nThe plot here is fairly simple, but it becomes complex in its execution. From the book's flap:\n\nFor twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. But only Hari Sheldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future—to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save mankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire—both scientists and scholars—and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the Galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for a fututre generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.\n\nBut soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. Mankind's last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and be overrun—or fight them and be destroyed.\n\nNow on to how the story is told and its overall appeal. This story is told in 5 parts, but since this book is the first in a trilogy, these 5 parts are only the beginning of the story and this particular volume is very open ended. Also, to complicate matters, the characters are told often that they are only half of \"The Foundation.\" Seldon has set up another society at the exact opposite of the universe too. So there is another trilogy telling their story too. A reader needs to be okay with this going in. It is easy to trust Asimov and just go along for the ride since the book is widely considered \"great.\"\n\nAlthough this novel is set in space way in the future in a completely foreign (to the reader) setting, there is still a lot which is familiar to a reader on earth in 2012. The main story line revolves around the idea of religion. In this case, the religion which Seldon has passed down is one based in science, but its followers are committed to it (and him) for 1,000 years. We only see the first 100 or so in this book. Characters within the story spend time talking about the religion and contemplating how much of it they believe. Some are hard core, others less so. Some true believers, others skeptics.\n\nAnother key topic here is politics. This novel may take place in space on planets which do not exist, but the politics at play and the politicians involved are shockingly similar to the here and now.\n\nSo already this book tackles religion and politics. This is dangerous territory, but also very thought provoking. Whether you enjoy the story itself or not, you cannot deny that this novel forces you to think long and hard about your own beliefs and politics.\n\nLet's move on to more of the pacing and style though. Since each section picks up years after the one before it, the main characters change and the point of view shifts. This complex style allows the reader to see the changes to the Foundation over a time greater than the span of any one man's life. We are also able to see what has been left behind of the people we followed in previous sections.\n\nThis is part of why the story is fairly brisk for being so thought-provoking. With the switching points of view and the skips forward in time, the story moves. Also, the chapters are short and the sections are not very long, which also keeps it moving briskly.\n\nBut, a side effect of this compelling pace is that the story was definitely plot centered as opposed to character centered. There were interesting characters, but I did not feel like they were fleshed out enough to my liking. I would have liked a few chapters just for building the characters. But with the plot front and center what you do gets is action, adventure, interesting philosophical discussions about philosophy, politics, religion, civilizations, and the behavior of man, and suspense at the Seldon predicted \"crisis points.\" There is plenty of interplanetary travel too.\n\nFoundation is an excellent choice for any reader who enjoys hard science fiction which follows the adventures of humans in outer space. But it is also a good introduction to this type of book for a new reader who also enjoys some of the other appeal factors I mentioned in the paragraphs above.\n\nOne final limiter I should mention, there are not really any women in this story. I am not a reader who normally cares about this but even I noticed the lack of female characters. If you want to see men and women, this is not the book for you.\n\nPersonally, I am very glad I read Foundation. I am okay with NOT finishing the trilogy though. I am still not a fan of hard science fiction, but there is plenty of sf that I do love.\n\nThree Words That Describe This Book: shifting points of view, great world-building, compelling action\n\nReadalikes: Since Asimov is classic author, I wanted to begin with similar authors first. I would suggest Arthur C. Clarke and Philip K. Dick.\n\nFor readers who want the space setting and adventure but with a more character centered touch, you cannot go wrong with Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series. And like the Foundation series, there is also a companion series here too-- Ender's Shadow.\n\nFor those who want more sf which also couples religion with the end of civilization setting, Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower series is a great choice. This one begins with an Earth setting and has less of an emphasis on the \"hard\" science and more of a focus on the ideas.\n\nFor those who want a series which focuses on the politics try the Honor Harrington series by David Weber.\n\nOther series I think are similar to the Foundation series are Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy, or Larry Niven's Ringworld series.\n\nScience Fiction is the Literature of Change\n\nIn preparation for an RA staff meeting tomorrow during which each member of our staff will be book talking a SF title, I came across this post about the current state of the genre.\n\nClick through, but then go and listen to the longer and more detailed Guardian Books podcast, Science Fiction Now and Tomorrow to which the post refers.\n\nFor our meeting, the staff was specifically asked to choose a first book in an established SF series that we had never read before. I am embarrassed to admit it but I had never read my choice, Foundation by Isaac Asimov.\n\nNow, there is a whole different discussion to be had about whether Foundation is actually still considered the first one in this series or not, and I will get into that later when I post my review/notes for our meeting, but reading Foundation and listening to the above podcast in tandem has been quite enlightening.\n\nOne of the arguments the podcast makes is that the pace of technological change has been so fast for the last 60 years or so, that SF is one of the best ways for the average person to cope with this real life blur of change. Reading Foundation with a 21st century lens, this point was very clear to me.\n\nI am also currently listening a wonderful new voice in Science Fiction, Ernest Cline, and his critically acclaimed debut novel, Ready Player One which is set in a science fiction future, but also looks back fondly on the technology, science fiction, and fantasy of the 1980s, the years of my youth. I cannot stress how wonderful listening to this book has been, and I am only about halfway through.\n\nYou would think the two novels would be very distinct being written decades apart. In fact, while their tone and subjects are very different, it is surprising how much the two books share. I have enjoyed the paring and it has really made me think about SF past, present and future. In fact, it made me think that another good RA training exercise would be to read a 20th century SF classic alongside a 21st century offering to compare and contrast.\n\nI have SF on the brain these days. Look for more detail on all of this in the coming weeks. I will have reviews of both Foundation and Ready Player One, as well as some notes from what my co-workers share in our staff meeting tomorrow. And count on the fact that I will be throwing in some general observations about the past, present, and future of SF.\n\nBut whether or not you have SF on the brain, at the very least go check out the podcast and get a sense of the current state of the genre. Also, take a look at this post from last week when I talked about the Locus Magazine Recommended Reading List for 2011 (Ready Player One is listed there).\n\nOne final note: the department meeting tomorrow is also a part of our larger attempt to explore some of the genres with which we as a staff are less confident. I will let you know how it goes and what area we decided to take on next.\n\nWhat I'm Reading: The Art of Fielding\n\nWell, while I am making good progress on my New Year's resolution to read 2 new romance authors this year, I am quite far behind on my resolution to keep up on my reviews. Of the 6 books I have finished reading in 2012 (with 2 more that I have to finish in the next week for work), I have only written 2 reviews so far. So I am 4 (about to be 6) behind already!!\n\nI will only be getting further behind, so today I am going to buck up and get going. Also, I have a bunch of boring paperwork to complete today, so writing a review will be a nice procrastination option.\n\nAs I mentioned at the end of this post, I saved the consensus best book of 2011 to read to start 2012. I really did enjoy The Art of Fielding by Chad Harbach, but I feel like it is cheating for me to read and review. Why? It had so many elements that I like if only one of them appears in a book, but this one literally had everything but a circus (one of my other favorite frames; click here to see more on that) and if it had been set in NJ instead of WI, I might have exploded with happiness.\n\nSeriously, here is a cross-referenced list of the things I love to see in any book which are all in play in The Art of Fielding:\n\nBaseball\n\nLiberal Arts College Setting\n\nMoby Dick references\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson references (this one is even key to the final dramatic moments)\n\nMy actual alma matter shows up and is made fun of, but in a fair way. It made me laugh.\n\nBook within a book frame. (The Art of Fielding is a book that the characters in the book refer to often.)\n\nThe Art of Fielding also features some of my favorite story telling techniques:\n\nTold as a \"slice of life\"-- The novel is one year in the life of 5 characters. You learn a bit about their life before this pivotal year and nothing about what happens after, but you are wrapped up in every detail of the year in which the book takes place.\n\nTold from multiple charcaters points of view. The story bounces back and forth between 5 protagonists.\n\nInteresting but extremely flawed characters. Each of the 5 protagonists is a good person deep down, but they all have a serious flaw that propels the story along. In the end they mostly redeem themselves and come to terms with their flaws, but as a reader you are not sure that these flaws are completely overcome.\n\nSo all of this being said, I am a bit freaked out by Harbach. Does he know me? Are we similar people? I don't know the answers here, but I am not going to complain. That being said, I will again say I might not be the best person to take advice from on this book. I was predisposed to love it.\n\nNow more general appeal comments. This is subtle storytelling. You are meant to dive in and experience this novel. You live with the characters, get wrapped up in their problems, and come to feel like they are your friends. They all hit some pretty low points during the course of the book, but manage to pull themselves out (for the most part).\n\nAs a result of these low points, there are some darker moments in this novel. There is one particualrly darkly humorous scene towards the end, but overall, the novel was realistic, thought provoking, bittersweet, and hopeful.\n\nThis is not the best book I ever read, but it was extremely well executed (it is hard to believe this is a first novel) and compelling. I was happy to spend a few days immersed in the world of Westish College. I was sad to finish the book because I so enjoyed my time reading it, but I felt like the ending while open, was satisfying. All things do not turn out well, nor do all turn out badly. I will definitely read Harbach's next book.\n\nNotice I haven't said much about the plot here. This is on purpose. The plot itself is not the issue. How the story is told will determine whether you like it or not. Plus, this book has been reviewed to death in the last few months, so if you just want a basic plot, go here.\n\nThree Words That Describe This Book: slice of life, multiple points of view, character driven\n\nReadalikes: The first book I thought of was another one of 2011's best, Swamplandia! because it shares all three of the story telling techniques I mentioned above. Click here for my full review of Swamplandia!.\n\nMany reviewers have called The Art of Fielding Franzen-lite. I agree completely. In Harbach's novel the characters are more likable, less annoying, and the story more nuanced. Click here for my review of Freedom by Franzen for more.\n\nThe backlist title I most thought of while reading The Art of Fielding was Richard Russo's Straight Man. The protagonist here is the Chairperson of the English Department at a liberal arts college. He reminded me so much of the Westish College President who is one of the 5 narrators of The Art of Fielding. Another good campus life/politics novel is Moo by Jane Smiley. I have read both the Russo and Smiley, but years before I started this blog. Both are worth a trip to your local library to check out. Interestingly, both authors are masters at writing quintessentially \"American\" novels that are critically acclaimed yet accessible. I think Harbach can be placed in their cannon for now. I hope he stays there and becomes as reliable as these 2 have been over their long careers.\n\nUnderworld by Don DeLillo is another suggestion. It too uses baseball as a frame without being a \"baseball novel.\" There is a fluctuating point of view in Underworld, but the story is much broader in scope. In Underwold, the story is that of the last 50 years of the 20th century, while in The Art of Fielding, we are following one academic year.\n\nMonsters of Templeton by Laura Groff could be another suggestion. From my original review:\n\nWillie Upton returns to her home town of Templeton to recover from a disastrous relationship with her graduate professor. Willie, is a direct descendant (on both sides!?!) of the town's founder. Here Templeton is a stand-in for Cooperstown, NY complete with a James Fenimore Cooper stand-in and a \"baseball history museum.\" But Templeton has something the real Cooperstown does not, a sea-monster, long a part of town folklore, rising to the surface of the lake, dead, in the opening pages of the novel. What follows is a complex novel in which Willie searches through the town's historical documents for the identity of her father. Goff has the dead speak, giving them entire chapters of monologue, and she incorporates some of Cooper's more famous characters into the story.\n\nI think if you are okay with the speculative elements here, the tone, characterizations, and style are very similar.\n\nI mentioned Moby Dick above. If you feel you did not get the Moby Dick references, a quick look at Nathaniel Phlibrick's compelling and fun Why Read Moby Dick? will clear it all up for you.\n\nReader Profile and Response With Examples\n\nThe first assignment I have the students do each semester is for them to create their own Reader Profile. They have to think about what they like to read and why.\n\nThey start by identifying 3 books they like and why, and then, equally as important, they need to think about 3 books they did not enjoy and why. Then they have to use the language of appeal (which I already spent the first few weeks teaching them) to describe all 6 books.\n\nFrom these lists, they are asked to write their profile. They consider what the books have in common, grouping these by appeal, such as a preferred pacing or character centered books vs plot driven ones. They use titles and/or authors to support their opinions.\n\nThe focus is on the whys.\n\nThe idea behind this assignment is that it helps to build their foundation as a readers advisor. I honestly believe that you cannot help another person to find a book they will enjoy reading unless you understand why you like to read what you like to read. I know that is wordy, but think about it. If you cannot articulate why you like certain books and dislike others, how can you expect your patrons to be able to do it.\n\nI know this by experience. I resisted physically writing down my reader profile for many years, but then about 6 years ago, I finally did it. Here is mine. It is old by this point, and could use some tweaking, but you get the point.\n\nI hope that by writing their profile, the students can see how unique their habits, quirks, and tastes are. This will allow them to be more respectful of the preferences of others later. It will also help them to coax this information out of their patrons when they are working together.\n\nSince this is for a class, I extend the learning opportunity further. After each student writes a profile, they blindly exchange them with each other. Thus giving each of them the opportunity to start helping another \"patron\" immediately.\n\nThis multi-week assignment finished up last week which each student presenting their patron and the titles they would suggest to him or her. After grading all of the assignments, I like to share the best pair with you to see how it all works.\n\nSo from this semester, here is Laura's profile and Katie's response to her.\n\nIf you ever wondered how we readers' advisors turn your reading preferences into a list of suggested titles, read Laura's likes and then Katie's explanation as to how you use the resources to get results.\n\nI feel like I am lifting the curtain to reveal the secrets behind our work. But if it helps you to help a few more readers, it is all worth it.\n\nIf you decide to write your own reader profile, let me know how it goes.\n\nTrending: Literary Mixtapes\n\nReaders of this blog know that I am a big fan of \"whole collection\" readers' advisory. First defined by Neal Wyatt here in 2006, \"It makes connections that extend beyond appeal-only considerations and includes the entire collection, not just fiction or books, when working with readers.\"\n\nThis means that when we are helping leisure, we need to do more than just give them readalike reading options. We need to also consider \"watchalikes\" or \"listenalikes\" too.\n\nReaders have no problem making the connections to books they like with movies or TV shows. In fact, they have been doing this longer than we professionals have. But with music, things are slightly trickier. Both the patrons and librarians are not already making these bridges intuitively, but that does not mean there aren't people out there trying.\n\nOf course if you take a book like Bel Canto by Ann Patchett which has an overt musical frame, it is easy to make these connections. But in most cases, making the connection from a song to a book is not that easy.\n\nHowever, over the course 2011 and now into 2012, there is a trend involving authors and book lovers alike; a trend I will generally refer to as \"Literary Mixtapes.\" (name taken from Flavorwire, see below)\n\nLast year, Jodi Picoult inserted herself into this discussion in her classically non-subtle style by writing the novel, Sing You Home, which features a music therapist. Picoult wrote songs for you, the reader, to listen to during certain parts of the book. Yes, the book comes with a CD.\n\nHowever, a larger trend than individual songs meant to be listened to while reading certain chapters is the book soundtrack. This would be most likened to a movie soundtrack. I first encountered a discussion of this phenomenon in January Magazine, which links to this essay in The Atlantic:\n\nThere is a long-held belief about cinema: \"There never was a silent film.\" From the early days, when moving images fascinated viewers in their mute spectacle, musical accompaniment drowned out the incessant whirring of the projector machine. Sound brought cinema's haunting figures into being, amplifying their moods and heightening the intensity of the action.\n\nReading, however, is silent by design. Unless readers add their own accompaniment. On any given public transit commute, one might find an audience of readers trying to do just that, headphones in, books open, providing soundtracks to literature. Mark Cameron noticed this on his daily ferry rides, and as he selected his own music-reading pairings, found himself choosing songs that emotionally corresponded to the words on the page. When he told his brother, the two started cooking up an idea for \"a more cinematic-type experience\" for reading, says Paul Cameron, who is now the CEO of the company they co-founded, Booktrack.\n\nOver the course of about three years, the Cameron brothers set up a service to provide movie-like soundtracks for digital books, five of which are available now for download onto an iPhone or iPad. More titles will appear on Booktrack's virtual shelves in the coming weeks and months, and will eventually be accessible for Android, computers, and other e-reading devices. They'll be offering selected titles for free, but most will cost between $1 and $4.\n\nClick here for the full essay.\n\nOne of the books that is discussed in The Atlantic essay is The Last Werewolf by Glen Duncan. You can go to the webpage which has a link to the soundtrack here. When I read this novel, I noticed the blurb on the cover which told me about the soundtrack and where to go to listen to it. This one one of the first book's I have seen that had a soundtrack created before the book came out and the publisher used it in promotional materials for the novel.\n\nBut it is not just author produced or sanctioned music that is being paired with a book. Many book lovers are out there making lists or even \"mixtapes\" to be paired with their reading materials.\n\nBack in September, Lit Lists ran this list of the Ten Best Songs Based on Books. But my favorite is Flavorwire's running series of Literary Mixtapes which take a literary character and make them a mix tape of music, like you would for a new girlfriend or boyfriend. Their newest one is a mix tape for Jo March. Click here to see them all.\n\nThis pairing of books and music is really gathering steam. Keep an eye out for more, and start thinking about how you can incorporate music into your patrons', or your own, reading.\n\nYou can also click here for the \"Trending\" archive.\n\nFootball Reads\n\nYou all have no choice but to indulge me today since I am a bit preoccupied. You see, I am a NY Giants fan and the past few weeks have been a whirlwind of emotions.\n\nKnowing it would be tough to concentrate on much else, I have rearranged my work schedule so that I am off work from now until Monday morning.\n\nI have to say, living in Chicago, it is fun to be the only Giants fan that my friends know. (Although I have made a few calls back to NJ this week.) Everyone is so excited for me. I appreciate the support. But right now, I need to distract myself to get through the next couple of days. I have a feeling I will have the cleanest house on the block come kick-off time Sunday night.\n\nToday I have a few football related reads to help you to enjoy the big game. Now, I know that the list of football reads is nowhere near as long as that for baseball books. In fact, although I enjoy football slightly more than baseball, overall, I much prefer baseball framed fiction and nonfiction. That is not to say that there aren't great football books though.\n\nI should begin with my fantasy football team, which is named, The Paper Lions after the book by the same name by the late, great George Plimpton. From the Amazon review:\n\nThrough the course of a long and distinguished career in letters, George Plimpton has crafted an art form from participatory journalism, and Paper Lion is his big touchdown. In the mid-'60s, Plimpton joined the Detroit Lions at their preseason camp as a 36-year-old rookie quarterback wannabe, and stuck with the club through an intra-squad game before the paying public a month later. What resulted is one of the funniest and most insightful books ever written on the game; 30 years later it remains a major model of what was then blossoming into New Journalism. Plimpton's breezy style wonderfully captures the pressures and tensions rookies confront in trying to make it, the hijinks that pervade the atmosphere when 60 high-strung guys are forced to live together in close quarters, and the host of rites and rituals with which football loves to coat itself. Of course, Plimpton didn't make it as a football hero; he barely accounts himself with dignity on the field, which is just as well. You don't have to be a lion when you've got a typewriter that can roar.\n\nThis really is a classic piece of sports writing, period. If it is just great sportswriting you are looking for, I would also suggest The Best American Sport Writing of the Century edited by another late, great, David Halberstam.\n\nIn the spirit of Plimpton, journalist Stefan Fatsis tried out to be a kicker for the Denver Broncos a handful of years ago. The resulting book, A Few Seconds of Panic was quite enjoyable. Click here and scroll down to read my review from August, 2008.\n\nA few other football themed reads I would recommend are:\n\nFriday Night Lights by H. G. Bissinger. This is a classic in YA literature. But as good as the book is, the movie and especially the wonderful TV series are even better.\n\nThe Blind Side was quite popular as a movie, but Michael Lewis' book of the same name is extremely enlightening for fans of the game. He chronicles how the Left Tackle position has become integral to the professional game.\n\nBarnes and Noble has their own list of the best Super Bowl books.\n\nFor fiction fans, Harlen Coben's mystery series following the sports agent Byron Molitar began with the football themed Deal Breaker.\n\nAnd then there are all of these books. Remember when I said \"indulge me\" above? If you click through you will see that I wasn't kidding.\n\nI'll be back on Monday, win lose or draw. Go Big Blue!"
