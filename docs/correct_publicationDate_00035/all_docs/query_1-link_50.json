        "text": "Recommended by Kirkus Reviews, Library Journal, and School Library Journal.\n\nThere's a delicate balance between mental health and mental illness.\n\nWho are the STRANGERS AMONG US?\n\nWe are your fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, friends and lovers. We staff your stores, cross your streets, and study in your schools, invisible among you. We are your outcasts and underdogs, and often, your unsung heroes.\n\nNineteen science fiction and fantasy authors tackle the division between mental health and mental illness; how the interplay between our minds' quirks and the diverse societies and cultures we live in can set us apart, or must be concealed, or become unlikely strengths.\n\nWe find troubles with Irish fay, a North Korean cosmonaut's fear of flying, an aging maid dealing with politics of revenge, a mute boy and an army of darkness, a sister reaching out at the edge of a black hole, the dog and the sleepwalker, and many more.\n\nAfter all, what harm can be done.\n\nAUTHORS: Kelley Armstrong, Suzanne Church, A.M. Dellamonica, Gemma Files, James Alan Gardner, Bev Geddes, Erika Holt, Tyler Keevil, Rich Larson, Derwin Mak, Mahtab Narsimhan, Sherry Peters, Ursula Pflug, Robert Runté, Lorina Stephens, Amanda Sun, Hayden Trenholm, Edward Willett, A.C. Wise\n\nIntroduction by Julie E. Czerneda\n\nEdited by Susan Forest and Lucas K. Law\n\nPraise for Strangers Among Us\n\n\"Strangers Among Us . . . is important, shining a much-needed spotlight on issues that get far too little attention. A wonderful anthology, one of the major SF&F books of the year. Bravo!\" — Robert J. Sawyer, Hugo Award-winning author of Quantum Night\n\n\"Stories do a masterful job of knitting legitimate and painful mental illnesses to characters who still retain agency and power.\" — Kirkus Reviews\n\n\"Mental illness is an exciting theme for an anthology, leaving plenty of room for variety.\" — Library Journal\n\n\"These stories address such varied subjects as agoraphobia, depression, schizophrenia, autism, anxiety, and addiction . . . readers who have mental illnesses may find themselves somewhere in these pages and as a result may no longer feel so alone or isolated.\" — School Library Journal\n\n\"A solid effort, a mixed SF/fantasy original anthology, with a number of entertaining stories to be found within its pages.\" — Locus (Gardner Dozois)\n\n\"The stories in Strangers Among Us are as varied in tone and approach as their authors. The power of the collection derives from this variety; while each story can be read in isolation, the assemblage of outsiders feels, on a whole, exultant. There is, indeed, strength in numbers, when each individual is accorded space and respect.\" —Quill & Quire\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\n2017 Aurora (Canadian SF&F) Award Winner\n\n2017 Alberta Book Publishers Award Winner (Speculative Fiction Book of the Year)\n\n2016 Foreword INDIES Finalist (Anthologies)\n\nOne honorable mention in The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2017 (ed. by John Joseph Adams and Charles Yu)\n\nSix honorable mentions in The Year's Best Science Fiction: Thirty-Fourth Annual Collection (ed. by Gardner Dozois)"
