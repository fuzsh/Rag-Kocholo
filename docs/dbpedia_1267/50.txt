Nosy Bé is the center for the production of perfume essence from the ylang-ylang tree.

Hellville, the islands main town and port, is situated in a sheltered bay and named after a former French governor, Admiral de Hell. The town features old colonial buildings and small boutiques. At the quayside, vendors display linens and wood carvings.

A major highlight of any visit to Nosy Be is a trip to Nosy Komba, the tiny island known for its lemur reserve. These arboreal primates, with large eyes, soft fur and long curling tails, have lived here for centuries.
