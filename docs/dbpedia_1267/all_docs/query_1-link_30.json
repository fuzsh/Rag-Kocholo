        "text": "Happy Saturday from Palm Beach! Lots of grandparent time recently‚Ä¶I‚Äôm here for my BF‚Äôs grandma‚Äôs 90th birthday.\n\nHarriett is a hyper-intellectual and superfan of\n\n(an excellent newsletter on U.S. history / politics, if you don‚Äôt already subscribe). Nothing gets past her. Which is how I hope to be when I‚Äôm 90 (with some meme fluency thrown in). üòâ\n\nI‚Äôve only been to Palm Beach once before, and am oh-so-inspired by the chic older women strolling around the city. I even flagged down a woman yesterday to see where she got her gorgeous textured white blazer. ‚ÄúLoro Piana,‚Äù she coolly replied, though I was hoping for H&M or Zara. I should have known‚Ä¶\n\nIf you‚Äôre new around here‚Äîwelcome to the weekly r.e.p.o.r.t c.a.r.d! It‚Äôs a weekly grab bag of the ideas, things, and people that I‚Äôm loving. Check out the first, second, and third, and fourth issues. It‚Äôs a fun, light addition to the VARSITY READER fold.\n\nLet‚Äôs dive in!\n\nWithout further ado‚Ä¶\n\nReading: This Atlantic article about why Tupperware is failing is a great one. A bit of a history lesson into Tupperware parties, too!\n\nRecent books I‚Äôve loved: the thriller about an anonymous forum for NYC moms that becomes unmasked, the non-fiction book about a frat drug ring at the College of Charleston, the memoir by a ma√Ætre d' at NYC‚Äôs top restaurants, and the memoir by a personal assistant to a private equity magnate.\n\nEating: I‚Äôm trying to get more protein in my diet. Who isn‚Äôt? But will I ever become a bodybuilder who chokes down grilled chicken for every meal? Absolutely not. Two delicious foods that have helped me get more protein in my diet:\n\nThese insanely good protein bars. They taste like a Milky Way, and I can‚Äôt shut up about the them. I‚Äôve tried the brownie batter, cookie dough, churro, and coconut flavors, and they‚Äôre all a 10/10.\n\nThis protein powder. I don‚Äôt love protein powders and find them all to be chalky and gross. I‚Äôve tried many‚Äîand this chocolate peanut butter flavor is by far the best one I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs a go-to for snacks / breakfast. I will even mix it into my yogurt sometimes.\n\nObsessing: Last week, I shared my obsession with this perfect $15 tee. Well-fitting with the perfect amount of slouch, this tee took me through my travels in Greece and London. And I‚Äôm currently wearing it as I eat lunch in Palm Beach and endure the 90-degree heat. I have in black & white, and it‚Äôs a true wardrobe workhorse!\n\nSecondly, black & white bathing suits. They are chic, timeless, and complimented by the surliest of relatives. I love this STAUD black & white suit I snagged over the summer, but it‚Äôs sadly sold out everywhere. My mom is in the market for one and wanted me to find her something similar‚Äîso I‚Äôm bringing my research to you as well.\n\nMost similar: This $110 option (pictured). I love the halter neck, criss-cross detailing, and extended size range (up to 20/22). Another option‚Äîthis $115 number that‚Äôs a bit simpler. If you prefer a square neck to a v-neck, this $185 option is gorgeous.\n\nSimilar, but a little funkier: This $148 option mimics my original STAUD buy with the side cut-out. I love the waist-tie detail‚Äîwould look adorable paired with white cover-up pants.\n\nOptions under $50: I love this $24.99 option! I saw it in-store earlier in the week, and the material felt luxe. Plus, the backside is full-coverage (a rarity these days!), and there‚Äôs extended sizing up to 4X.\n\nAs the final recommendation, this $32.99 pick. I‚Äôve purchased swimwear from this brand before and it holds up‚Ä¶four seasons later! Classic and a bit funky.\n\nRecommending: If you‚Äôre a beauty fiend, you‚Äôre in for a treat with\n\n‚Äôs new Substack . Julia is a friend of mine from NYU‚Äîwe were actually lab partners freshman year. She has since forged a career as a beauty marketer *and* shares her obsessively curated beauty finds on Instagram. I swear by her picks (she first introduced me to my beloved compression & lymphatic drainage leggings!) The first two issues spotlighted Julia‚Äôs favorite beauty spots in NYC and LA, and I know future editions will be just as juicy. Highly recommend subscribing!\n\nTreating: Has anyone ever tried a Russian manicure?! I‚Äôve been on Russian manicure TikTok before, but haven‚Äôt made the plunge myself. But then the other day, I met a woman and was *completely* transfixed by her nails. It had been three weeks since her Russian manicure, and her nails still looked perfect‚Äîvirtually no growth. They‚Äôre pricey ($150 for a manicure that lasts 4 - 5 weeks), but I‚Äôm curious to try!\n\nCutting: Mean girls. Per last week‚Äôs edition, life is too short!\n\nAdmiring: I‚Äôm all for easy, throw-on-and-go dresses in the summer. And this adorable $80 white terry polo dress perfectly fits the bill. I‚Äôm excited to wear as a cover-up and as a mini dress with sandals.\n\nReferring: If you haven‚Äôt already seen the Brandy Melville documentary (titled BRANDY HELLVILLE), you‚Äôre in for a treat. I was always very skeptical of the retailer‚Äôs one-size-fits-all sizing (which really meant all sizes‚Ä¶up to a 4), but as it turns out, the company is up to way more shady sh*t. I love a good corporate expos√©, and this one delivers. You can watch on HBO Max.\n\nDaring: I‚Äôm daring to‚Ä¶try running every now and then. I barely made my 6AM flight to Palm Beach and had exactly three minutes to sprint from security to my gate (which was far away). I made it with seconds to spare and it felt like I was reaching Kipchoge-level speed‚Äîand I was pretty winded for a good ten minutes. I work out regularly and lift heavy weights, but have always despised running. Especially after spending a week in Greece with my grandparents, I realized that hey, I won‚Äôt always be able to sprint! So if you see me gasping for air around Central Park, you can remind me why I decided to endure something I deeply hate. üòâ\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nA networking tip no one talks about, part 2\n\nA networking tip no one talks about, part 1\n\nHow to drown out naysayers when trying something new\n\nThe perfect white shirt\n\nMy favorite Upper East Side spots\n\nThe professional no-no I hear every day (and an easy reframe)\n\nA personal plug\n\nIf you need one-to-one support with your career or content strategy, reach out.
