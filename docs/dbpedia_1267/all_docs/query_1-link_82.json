We are in Nosy Be, Madagascar Island, very much loved by dive enthusiasts and lovers of pristine beaches and the enchanting lifestyle \"mora mora\" (in lowland \"piano\").

Apart from the turquoise water of the water, in addition to the nicest candor of the beaches, there is a submerged world. Literally. The depths of Cayo Largo deserve more than one visit. We would dive every day. Here, even the less experienced ones will have fun: the corals are already visible at modest heights so you do not have to go deep enough to re-look your eyes with the beauty of the reef. It is understood that the backdrops are a strong point of the place because of the presence of more than 30 dive sites: there is nothing but diving and discovering. Find out what? Colorful fish, corals, wrecks, underwater caves, walls covered with gorgonias and colorful sponges."
