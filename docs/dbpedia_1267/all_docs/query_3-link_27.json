        "text": "Malmö, Sweden – July 23, 2020 – SHIN JARDBO announces the launch of a crowdfunding campaign for the first of its kind sustainable & hypoallergenic travel towel suitable for all skin types with a uniquely soft touch. The campaign started on July 22 and ends on Aug 22.\n\nThe towel is made from 100% Raw Silk, a completely natural material as functional as the most advanced synthetic materials, yet much more beneficial for humans and nature. The fabric production and dying are OEKO-TEX STANDARD 100 certified.\n\nRaw Silk is non-toxic and famed for its hypoallergenic properties. It does not irritate sensitive skin and might be the most agreeable towel for people with dry skin, eczema, or other allergies. Raw Silk is also anti-bacterial by nature that helps the towel stay fresh for longer.\n\nThe most popular travel towels today use synthetic materials such as Microfibre, making them lightweight and have the advantage of quick drying properties. The problem is when used and washed, these types of towels release tiny pieces of plastic fibres and toxic substances into nature, and they do not biodegrade. These microplastics can be found in the oceans, rivers, and marine animals.\n\nUnlike Microfibre or Cotton towels, Raw Silk towel production is very water and energy saving and does not release toxins into the environment. SHIN JARDBO towel biodegrades seamlessly back into nature after its lifetime. Moreover, Raw Silk is made from the leftovers in ordinary silk production and thus contributes to zero-waste production.\n\nThe towel is super lightweight, fast-drying, and does not cause smells or odors because of its natural anti-bacterial properties. Raw Silk fabric has good absorbency by nature and it just improves with time. Easy and handy not only to bring on far away adventures but also to enjoy an active everyday lifestyle.\n\nCreated by Sweden-based couple Lan Shin and Martin Jardbo, the product derives from Martin’s childhood reluctance to wear clothes made of synthetic materials as he found them itchy and uncomfortable. The product is designed to convey more with less, the absolute essential elements with strong usability.\n\nAvailable in 3 colours; Chili Oil / Ensign Blue / Grapemist, and 3 sizes; Standard / Bantam / Face & Hand. The Standard size (largest size) can function as a beach towel and can be folded like a pocketbook but a lot lighter at 140g. The towel loop is longer than usual to improve the convenience of use, and the care label is printed on the towel instead of being attached.\n\nSHIN JARDBO travel towel is available to pre-order on Indiegogo with an initial goal of Kr 60,000 (Approx. $6,526). Perks include an Early Bird STANDARD Towel for Kr 380 (Approx. $41), saving 21% off the MSRP and free delivery worldwide.\n\nCampaign page found: https://igg.me/at/shinjardbo\n\nPress kit available at: https://shinjardbo.com/pages/press-kit"
