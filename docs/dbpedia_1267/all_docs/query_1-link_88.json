        "text": "Nosy Bé is the center for the production of perfume essence from the ylang-ylang tree.\n\nHellville, the islands main town and port, is situated in a sheltered bay and named after a former French governor, Admiral de Hell. The town features old colonial buildings and small boutiques. At the quayside, vendors display linens and wood carvings.\n\nA major highlight of any visit to Nosy Be is a trip to Nosy Komba, the tiny island known for its lemur reserve. These arboreal primates, with large eyes, soft fur and long curling tails, have lived here for centuries.\n\nPier Information. The ship is scheduled to anchor off Hellville. Guests will be taken ashore via the ships tenders. The center of town is within walking distance. Taxis are generally available at the pier should you wish to go farther afield. Be sure to negotiate the price before setting out. Englishaspeaking taxi drivers are in short supply."
