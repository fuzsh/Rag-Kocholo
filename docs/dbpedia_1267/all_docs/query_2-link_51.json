        "text": "AUTHENTICITY\n\nRenovated in 2022, the Vanila Hotel & Spa welcomes you to an authentic place showcasing Malagasy culture in the heart of Nosy Be, the island of perfumes; its surrounding islets, its exotic fauna and flora come together to make this setting a well-preserved paradise. The hotel has 2 swimming pools with a breathtaking view of Nosy Sakatia, an access to the beach, a spa, a restaurant and many other facilities thought and designed especially for your well-being in order to make your stay unforgettable.\n\nNATURE\n\nBetween palm trees, ravinala and other endemic plants of Madagascar, the Vanila Hotel & Spa welcomes you in a green setting. With typical Malagasy architecture, this 3-star hotel (international standards) is located in a lush tropical park that fits perfectly into the original landscape of the island of perfumes and which will guarantee you a total change of scenery.\n\nDISCOVERY\n\nMadagascar is one of the last places in the world to have kept its authenticity with its unique way of life, its varied landscapes, its endemic fauna and flora. Adventure, escape, intimacy, diversity… So many words could describe Madagascar, but the real experience does not pass through words, but through feelings. We say \"Feel the Sound's\", an expression that can only be understood by the few people who have already experienced a trip to Madagascar. Our goal is to offer sensations and emotions more than simple activities in Nosy Be and its surroundings.\n\nGarden room\n\nOur garden rooms of 36m2 max. all have a private terrace overlooking the tropical garden. All our rooms are air-conditioned and have a safe, a telephone line, a TV and a mini-bar. Access to the spa and breakfasts are included.\n\n36 m²\n\n4 personnes\n\nWi-Fi"
