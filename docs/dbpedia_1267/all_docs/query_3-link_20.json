        "text": "When Danish filmmaker Lea Glob first met Apolonia Sokol in 2009, she appeared to be leading a storybook life. The talented Apolonia was born in an underground theatre in Paris and grew up in an artist community — the ultimate bohemian life. In her 20s, she studied at the Beaux-Arts de Paris, one of the most prestigious art academies in Europe. Over the years, Lea kept returning to film Apolonia as the latter sought her place in the art world, grappling with the agonies and joys of womanhood, the relationships with others and her own body and creation. The result is a fascinating portrait of the young woman’s trying voyage into the art world. Apolonia is confident in her talent, but her path is not always an easy one to tread. Life is not a storybook, and Apolonia learns that women painters have to make more sacrifices and overcome greater obstacles than their male counterparts. This also applied to the friend she lived with for a long time, Oksana Shachko, one of the founders of the feminist action group Femen. Apolonia’s resilience is put to the test. As time passes and a special bond grows between Apolonia and Lea, we witness a film being born and a painter rising to fame. 13 years on, the two women continue to reflect on each other’s paths in this mesmerizing film about art, love, motherhood, sexuality, representation, and how to succeed in a world dominated by patriarchy, capitalism and war, without losing oneself.Director Lea Glob (Olmo & the Seagull) joins us for a conversation on how and why her first meeting with Apolonia propelled them both on this complex and meaningful journey, how she navigated the line between director and subject during the 13-year long duration of the project, the impact that Oksana had on Apolonia, and where are Apolonia and Lea today.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-1-12-24%20-%20Glob%20-%20Apolonia%20Apolonia.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: instagram.com/apolonia_apolonia_film\n\nTo watch: mubi.com/apolonia-apolonia\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Lea Glob graduated as a director from The National Film School of Denmark in 2011 with the short film MEETING MY FATHER- KASPER TOPHAT about the directors’ involuntary journey into a stranger than fiction story of her own origins. Glob co-directed OLMO & THE SEAGULL with Petra Costa in 2014. It premiered at Locarno where it won the Young Jury Prize. It also won the Best Nordic Dox Award at CPH:DOX, Best Documentary at the Rio Film Festival, Best Documentary at the Cairo Film Festival, and Best Narrative at the RiverRun International film festival, among others. In 2016 Glob co-directed the feature documentary VENUS together with Mette Carla Albrechtsen about sexuality from a female perspective, which became a moment to share thoughts on sexuality and identity, in an attempt to formulate a language and reclaim the female body. The film premiered in IDFA’s First Appearance Competition and won the audience award in IndieLisboa IIFF. All along those years Glob followed the story of Apolonia Sokol, creating a sort of double sided portrait of the artist as a young woman. APOLONIA, APOLONIA is the director’s first documentary feature as a solo-director.\n\nAbout the subject – Apolonia Sokol was born in 1988 in Paris, Apolonia Sokol is a French figurative painter of Danish and Polish descent. After graduating from the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris, she moved to the United States and settled in New York where she worked in Dan Colen’s studio. She later moved to Los Angeles where she befriended other artists and painters with whom she started an ongoing conversation on figurative painting. Sokol is known for her political stance on the art of portraiture, claiming the need to use it as a tool of empowerment and deconstruction of marginalization and domination. That is why she addresses multiple issues such as feminisms, queerness, women’s representation throughout art history and body politics in general.

It begins with the sudden death of the husband of Nawal, a young Arab woman. The tragedy leaves her and her daughter without rights or property under Islamic law—and at the mercy of male relatives. Both her own brother and brother-in-law at first show sympathy. But soon it’s clear that any whiff of assertion—I paid for half this house; I will keep my job; I will raise my daughter as I see fit—is met with the forces of patriarchy. Amjad Al Rasheed’s gripping, taut debut INSHALLAH A BOY immerses us in the tangled impossibilities for a woman who simply wants to keep her home and protect her daughter, without a husband or male heir to legitimize her. Her acts of resistance (including necessary deception) enmesh multiple players in a complex web of risk and hope – reminiscent of Asghar Farhadi’s masterpiece A SEPARATION – as we root and fear for her at every turn. Director/Co-writer Amjad Al Rasheed stops by to talk about the inspiration for his multi-faceted, finding his lead actor Mouna Hawa to play Nawal and the superb supporting cast as well as the pride tken from the wide recognition the film has received from the Cannes Film Festival and other prestigious film festivals from around the world.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-1-12-24%20Rasheed%20-%20Inshallah.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nUS Premiere Friday, January 12 at Film Forum in NYC\n\nTo watch go to: greenwichentertainment.com/inshallah-a-boy\n\nINSHALLAH A BOY is the first film from Jordan ever selected for the Cannes Film Festival, where it took home two prizes.

Exciting, galvanizing…A gripping social drama about systemic oppression…” – Jessica Kiang, Variety\n\n“The film strongly evokes a flattering comparison to Asghar Farhadi’s Iranian efforts, especially A SEPARATION and THE SALESMAN: a top-to-bottom accounting of a repressive society laden with class antagonism.” – David Katz, Cineuropa\n\n“The acting is superb, and the pacing is remarkable. But most importantly, the look into women’s rights, morality, and normalized societal oppression speaks volumes about its country and the road to freedom.” – Abhishek Sharma, Film Threat\n\n“A sort of soft-faced tyrany abounds – from the manipulations Rifqi uses in a bid to get Nawal to agree to everything, to the acquiescent response of her brother, who though broadly sympathetic is unwilling to fight her corner.” – Amber Wilkinson, Eye for Film\n\n“Al Rasheed presents Nawal’s dilemma as Jobian: we’re asked to wonder if her faith will hold firm as her desperation grows. Thrills come from seeing how close she will walk to the precipice. The pleasure of watching is not in wondering if she’ll overcome, but how.” – Rory O’Connor, The Film Stage\n\nDonald Trump’s longtime adviser, Roger Stone maneuvers in and out of Danish filmmaker Christoffer Guldbrandsen’s grasp in this jaw-dropping portrait of a puppet master tangled in his own strings. A STORM FORETOLD – ROGER STONE AND DIE follows the revered right-wing powerbroker, his influential journey back to the era of President Nixon, a legacy inked onto his own back. In a film marked by unparalleled access, Christoffer Guldbrandsen captures the tumultuous final months of the Trump administration, centering on the heart of power and climaxing with the unprecedented storming of Congress. Guldbrandsen finds himself amidst the chaos as Trump supporters converge on Washington, witnessing firsthand Roger Stone’s strategic retreat from his hotel suite as the ‘Stop the Steal’ campaign spirals into a riot. A STORM FORETOLD – ROGER STONE AND DIE unfolds the narrative of a once-established political party metamorphosing into an anti-democratic movement, where impassioned rhetoric evolves into tangible violence. Director Christoffer Guldbrandsen (Stealing Africa) joins us for a conversation on that amazing level of access was able to attain, getting to know the Trump movement from the ultimate insider and how he sees the future of American politics.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-1-5-24%20Guldbrandsen%20-%20Storm%20Foretold.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor the latest updates go to: astormforetoldfilm.com\n\nFor screenings go to: abramorama.com/a-storm-foretold\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Christoffer Guldbrandsens’ work is inspired by the observational style of the direct cinema movement. He trained as a journalist in Denmark and the United Kingdom, and his work has won the Peabody Award in the US and The Danish Art Council’s Grant. Guldbrandsen penetrates closed and secretive milieus like no other, from where he draws the material for his documentary dramas. His films are characterized by an expressive realism in structure, form, and content. With understated but effective means, he lets the characters, and the dramas unfold before the audience naturally. His breakthrough film, The Road to Europe (2003), was an observational doc- thriller about the enlargement of the European Union, that created an international stir when it revealed that Germany would never let Turkey into the EU. Russian President Vladimir Putin was also upset by the film, publicly protesting, he had been recorded during a private conversation. Guldbrandsen’s observational film about the rise and fall of the new political party New Alliance, has become a satirical landmark documentary – and an inspiration for the drama hit-series “Borgen.” A mainstay in Guldbrandsen’s films is his ability to turn complicated subject matter into cinema. He highlights the often banal, unassuming actions that reveal essential character traits and emotions of humans in high-tension situations. In a striking visual style and with a sense for sharply drawn characters, Guldbrandsen delivers dramas from the political reality among the winners and losers of power. In addition to his film work, Guldbrandsen has served as CEO for The Why Foundation, Commissioning Editor and Executive Editor for DR – The Danish Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nfacebook.com/AStormForetold\n\nfacebook.com/christoffer.guldbrandsen\n\nfacebook.com/Abramorama\n\ntwitter.com/cguld\n\ninstagram.com/christoffer_guldbrandsen\n\ninstagram.com/abramorama\n\n100% on RottenTomatoes\n\n“Entertaining, at times jaw-dropping, yet deeply dismaying…” – Jessica Kiang, Variety\n\n“A riveting nonfiction film that “platforms” a controversial figure and then goes on to hang him with his own words” – Stephen Silver, The SS Ben Hecht\n\n“Even more disturbing is how entertaining all this can be, Stone often appearing humorously genial…The film is unsettling in more ways than one.” – Laura Clifford, Reeling Reviews\n\n“Provocative, enraging, timely and illuminating.” – Avi Offer, NYC Movie Guru\n\nMAN ON THE RUN follows the enigmatic Low Taek Jho—known to most as Jho Low–a mysterious businessman and playboy. Working with former Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia, Low orchestrated a scheme to exploit 1MDB, a sovereign wealth fund established in 2009 with the noble purpose of benefiting the people of Malaysia. In 2015, the intrepid journalist Clare Rewcastle-Brown receives leaked financial documents, setting off a global investigation that uncovers a staggering amount of money being funneled into international bank accounts to fuel Low’s extravagant lifestyle. He now faces charges of money laundering and a slew of other offenses related to the multibillion-dollar scandal and is wanted by international authorities.

Growing up, he focused his lens on his family and close friends, and as a young man, he recorded precious moments with the people and places he encountered on his travels, striving to live a life of love and seek out universal human connection. The deeply personal and poignant HBO documentary feature DANIEL chronicles his mission to pursue an epic adventure, Daniel visits war zones to sacred sites, including a Mayan burial ground in a cave in Mexico. He would often take a keepsake from each location as a reminder of his connection to the earth. But Daniel’s world travels abruptly end when he must return home to Vancouver because of health reasons. While undergoing treatment, he is haunted by the memory of an ancient Mayan curse and goes on a quest to put things back where they belong before he runs out of time. Crafted from over 1,400 hours of vérité-style footage shot in 42 countries across four continents, DANIEL is an unflinching self-portrait of a young man with an insatiable curiosity and a boundless desire to understand the world and his place in it.

The film tracks the rise and collaborations of a group of legendary studio musicians through the 1970s and onward, chronicling their illustrious partnerships and their formidable record of hit-making. While The Wrecking Crew followed the first wave of studio musicians in the 60s, IMMEDIATE FAMILY reveals the machinery behind the booming era of the singer-songwriter, when the talents of these four musicians were in furious demand. Known for their long, illustrious careers backing up such Hall-of-Fame artists such as James Taylor, Keith Richards, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Carole King, Stevie Nicks and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, guitarists Danny Kortchmar and Waddy Wachtel, drummer Russ Kunkel, and bassist Leland Sklar have come together, along with guitarist Steve Postell, to perform their own songs as The IMMEDIATE FAMILY band that can legitimately be called a supergroup. The foundations of their enduring friendship, formed on the road and in studios, is recalled with dynamite clarity —reminisced with fondness through intimate interviews with the guys themselves, as well as the memories of some of rock’s most iconic voices. IMMEDIATE FAMILY is a backstage tour spanning multiple eras of musical history. Director Denny Tedesco (Wrecking Crew) joins us to talk about his joyous and entertaining bookend toWrecking Crew and how he initially resisted any film follow-up until he came to realize that Danny Kortchmar, Waddy Wachtel, Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar, and Steve Postell were in fact today’s worthy successors to his dad and the hit-making musicians he brought to our attention in 2008.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-12-15-23%20Tedesco%20-%20Immediate%20family.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: immediatefamilyfilm.com\n\nIn theaters on December 15\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Denny Tedesco grew up in Los Angeles.

The stories originate at the intersection of race, climate, and socio-economic gentrification and examines the assumptions regarding who matters—and who doesn’t—and about land and who controls it. As rising seas threaten Miami’s luxurious beachfront, wealthy property owners are pushing inland to higher ground. The historically black neighborhood of Liberty City, which has been ignored by developers and policy-makers alike, for generations is 12 feet above sea level, has now becomes more attractive to the wealthy with each rising tide. At the heart of Liberty City is the Liberty Square housing projects, the first segregated public housing project in the South. New Liberty Square: a $300 million mixed income development. The dramatic changes happening in Miami’s Liberty Square are a looking glass for contemporary issues of wide-scale significance: the affordable housing crisis, the impact of systemic racism and climate gentrification. Miami is experiencing sea level rise before the rest of the country. What is happening in Liberty Square is a prescient story of what is to come, and strategies put to the test here are being closely observed by the rest of the world. Director / Producer Katja Esson (Ferry Tales, Poetry of Resilience) joins us for a conversation on how she came to know about the history and looming fate of Liberty Square, why ringing the bell on relationship between rising sea levels, systemic racism, affordable housing and Climate Gentrification should scare the hell out of every community in here in America and beyond.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-11-17-23%20Esson%20-%20Razing%20Liberty%20Square.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: razinglibertysquare.org/thefilm\n\nBroadcast Premiere January 29, Independent Lens/PBS\n\nThe history of Liberty Square – Despite its eclectic mix of cultures, Miami is one of the most racially segregated cities in the United States (remnants of the 6-foot-high ‘race wall’ are still visible today). Liberty Square and the surrounding Liberty City that grew up around it were a cultural hot-spot for famous black entertainers and public figures. Barred from the whites-only beach hotels, where they consistently sold out performances, world-class celebrities like Sammy Davis Jr., Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald and Lena Horne had to stay in Liberty City hotels like the Hampton House. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered the first version of his “I Have a Dream” speech there and Malcolm X threw a victory party for Cassius Clay after he beat Sonny Liston in 1965.\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Katja Esson ( Director/Producer ) is an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker based in Miami.

RADIOACTIVE: THE WOMEN OF THREE MILE ISLAND is an award-winning film about the 1979 Three Mile Island meltdown – the worst commercial nuclear accident in U.S. history – and its aftermath. It uncovers the never-before-told stories of four intrepid homemakers, Linda Braasch, Joyce Corradi, Beth Drazba and Paula Kinney, who take their local community’s case against the plant operator all the way to the Supreme Court – and a young female journalist who’s caught in the radioactive crossfire. RADIOACTIVE features activist and actor Jane Fonda, whose film,The China Syndrome (a fictional account of a nuclear meltdown), opened 12 days before the real disaster in Pennsylvania. RADIOACTIVE also breaks the story of a radical new health study that may finally expose the truth of the meltdown. For over forty years, the nuclear industry has done everything in their power to cover up their criminal actions, claiming, as they always do, “No one was harmed and nothing significant happened.” Director, producer and writer Heidi Hutner joins us for a conversation on the devastation caused by the reactor meltdown, the cover-up, the dogged determination by a small group of extraordinary people to the unvarnished truth, the dire consequences of the lies and malfeasance that occurred on March 28, 1979 and why it matters today and tomorrow.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-12-8-23%20Hutner%20-%20Radioactive.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: radioactivethefilm.com\n\nLos Angeles Theatrical Run – Friday, Dec 8 – Thursday, Dec 14 at Laemmle’s Royal\n\nSTREAMING: RADIOACTIVE will drop on Apple+ and Prime on March 12, 2024.\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Heidi Hutner,Award-WinningDirector, Writer, and Producer, is an award-winning Professor of Environmental Humanities and Gender Studies at Stony Brook University, and a scholar of nuclear and environmental history, literature, film, and ecofeminism.

Banding together for the sake of their survival, they elect ‘Young-tak’ as their Resident Delegate. Under his leadership, they strictly ban entry by outsiders and draw up a new set of Resident Regulations. Thanks to this, in contrast to the hellish nightmare outside, Hwang Gung Apartments stands as a safe and peaceful utopia for its residents.

Filmed almost as if a Vermeer or Rembrandt painting, the camera is never intrusive, never mechanical. Rather, the images move as the smoke – lingering, wafting, suspended briefly before disappearing and reappearing. With an authentic voice and authority born of their own heritage, inspired by her South-East Estonian culture of Võromaa and Setomaa, and the profound teachings of her Võro granny, filmmaker Anna Hints has created a transformative experience of being human within a female body, showing women “as they are” with great emotional veracity and deep empathy. In the darkness of a smoke sauna, women share their innermost secrets and intimate experiences, washing off the shame trapped in their bodies and regaining their strength through a sense of communion. Women share their innermost secrets and intimate experiences inside an Estonian smoke sauna. Cleansing their bodies and baring their souls, they embrace the healing power of sisterhood. Anna Hints’ Sundance-winning documentary celebrates the centuries-old smoke sauna tradition, recognized on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The impact of SMOKE SAUNA SISTERHOOD on the communities represented in the film has been profound. Viewers have connected emotionally with the stories, finding solidarity and empowerment in the shared experiences of these brave women. Director Anna Hints joins us for a conversation on what brought her to documenting this sacred space where women give birth, wash the dead, and express their vulnerability, found self-acceptance, and a collective empowerment for generations to come..\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-11-24-23%20Hints%20-%20Smoke%20Sauna.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: greenwichentertainment.com/smoke-sauna-sister\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Anna Hints is an Estonian film director with a background in contemporary art and experimental folk music.

For the film’s brief running time, there’s an emotional osmosis at play, in both sauna and cinema alike.” – Wendy Ide, Observer (UK)\n\n“This is a film that weaves a spell, the camera resting often not on the woman talking but on the person listening to her, thereby creating the impression of a universal experience of women.” – Cath Clarke, Guardian\n\n“Hypnotic, intimate and blisteringly honest.

She is prepared to end her life after failing to get over the suicide of her bullied son years before. As she teeters on the brink of committing suicide, she encounters a mysterious young girl (newcomer Sofía García) caked in mud and dirt. Everything changes when Lucía appears. It is quickly revealed that the young girl has telekinetic powers and might be the harbinger of the apocalyptic prophecy that exists within town legend. Despite Lucia’s penchant for violence, María José feels an instant kinship with the girl because, like her late son, she has dwarfism — and the two of them face off against the vitriolic community who want to nip the potential hellscape in the bud. With the enigmatic girl by her side, María José faces the corrupt community, overloaded with sadistic secrets and immoral lies that triggers strange events and a series of horrific deaths among the local population.

When Inger announces her struggles with mental health to the group, the sisters are faced with pity from some and downright discrimination from others. On arrival in Paris, it soon becomes clear that Inger has a hidden agenda concerning a figure from her past, ultimately involving the entire group in her hunt for answers. The film stars Sofie Gråbøl (star of the hit Danish drama series, “The Killing”) and Lena Maria Christensen.

This film focuses on the flock of cherry-headed conures (and a lonely blue-headed one named Connor) who flock around the Telegraph Hill region of the city and their closest human companion, Mark Bittner. Through his own words, we learn of his life as a frustrated, homeless musician and how he came to live in the area where he decided to explore the nature around him.

Parrot “stars” include Connor, a lonely blue-crowned conure, ostracized by the cherry heads; Picasso and Sophie, an affectionate pair who love to cuddle; Pushkin, a single father who raises three babies on his own; and Mingus, who bebops to Mark’s guitar music.\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Pelican Media Executive Director Judy Irving is a Sundance-and-Emmy-Award-winning filmmaker whose theatrical credits include The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill, a feature documentary about the relationship between a homeless street musician and a flock of wild parrots in San Francisco, Pelican Dreams, about California brown pelicans and the people who know them best, Dark Circle, a personal film about the links between nuclear power and weapons, and Cold Refuge, about how swimming in open water mitigates life’s challenges. In 2015 Judy was elected to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences Documentary Branch. Wild Parrotswas a “Top Ten Film of the Year” (National Film Critics’ Poll), was the highest-rated program on the national PBS series “Independent Lens,” and is now in international distribution. Pelican Dreams screened in over 100 theaters and later streamed by Netflix. Dark Circle, which won the Grand Prize at Sundance and a National Emmy, was re-mastered in HD and re-released by First Run Features. Cold Refuge has just begun its flight to festivals and eventual distribution. Judy spent childhood summers on the North Fork of Long Island, and came to love birds thanks to her grandfather. She graduated from Connecticut College with a degree in Psychology and worked as a freelance journalist in Montreal before hitchhiking across the continent and living on a handmade raft-house in British Columbia. Later, she received her Masters in Film and Broadcasting from Stanford University, and a Guggenheim Fellowship in Film. Her documentary film career has taken her to Alaska, Japan, Russia, Nepal, and Zimbabwe, with peace and the environment as her main areas of interest. Somehow, birds seem to show up in every movie. Judy’s six-film documentary series about the San Francisco Bay Area’s wildlife and open space led to her interest in the wild parrot flock flying the city’s north waterfront, and her habit of swimming year-round in the Bay led to her most recent documentary, Cold Refuge.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nfacebook.com/Mark Bittner\n\nfacebook.com/wildparrotsoftelegraphhill\n\ninstagram.com/thewildparrotsoftelegraphhill\n\n95% on RottenTomatoes\n\n“An absolute delight and nothing like the wimpy nature film its title suggests.

Blow, New York Times columnist and best-selling author of “The Devil You Know: A Black Power Manifesto,” sets off across the country on a personal journey to test his theory on Black Liberation, which involves a daring strategy for Black Americans to move to the southern states to control southern legislatures and gain greater political power. Conversing with politicians, historians, community activists, colleagues, friends, and family members, Blow challenges Black Americans to disrupt the status quo by affecting change at the polls through reverse migration and gain control over states that already have the highest percentages of Black residents. Co-directors Llewellyn M. Smith and Sam Pollard’s thought provoking feature documentary SOUTH TO BLACK POWER also takes us on a journey through Blow’s personal story, from his childhood in Louisiana to his relentless commitment to racial justice, revealing the hard-won truths that illuminate his vision for the future. As the returns from the midterm elections roll in, Blow watches, acknowledging the gains, but also reflects on the possibility that a historic political transformation in the South might not come in his lifetime. Co-directors Llewellyn M. Smith and Sam Pollard join us for a conversation on the conflicted history of The Great Migration, the lack of substantive political and economic progress for Black Americans everywhere, and how Charles Blow’s provocative proposal to re-populate a handful of Southern states with enough Black voters to propel a seismic political shift in power towards a more equitable America.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-11-24-23%20Pollard%20%26%20Smith%20-%20South%20to%20Black%20Power.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: hbo.com/south-to-black-power\n\nThe HBO Original documentary SOUTH TO BLACK POWER, a This Machine production, directed by Peabody and Emmy®-winning filmmaker Sam Pollard (HBO’s “Hostages,” “Black Art: In the Absence of Light”) and Peabody winner Llewellyn M.

Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Through interviews with people on the street and songs recorded to memorialize JFK in the mid-1960s, the film explores the impact of the assassination on issues in today’s world, from lingering conspiracy theories to the proliferation of gun violence, homelessness, and the scourge of K2. Personal narratives are juxtaposed with the sentiments articulated in blues, gospel, norteño, and calypso recordings to haunting affect. Especially poignant is the account of Mary Ann Moorman, who returns to the assassination site fifty years later and details the making of her Polaroid photograph of the fatal head shot that killed JFK as the motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza. This resonant new film by Alan Govenar confronts ways we come to terms with the past through the power of storytelling, image-making, and a songbook that is largely unknown. Award winning filmmaker Alan Govenar (The Beat Hotel, Tattoo Uprising) joins us to talk about how the Kennedy legend continues to hold sway over people born long after his traumatizing public execution, the power of song in framing the Kennedy legacy, getting Mary Ann Moorman to participate in the making of this film and the impact of poverty and homelessness on the social fabric of a fraying society wracked by violence.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-11-17-23%20Govenar%20-%20Down%20in%20Dalls%20Town.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: firstrunfeatures.com/downindallastown\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Alan Govenar is an award-winning writer, poet, playwright, photographer, and filmmaker.

As a schoolboy aged 14, Nick Broomfield met Brian Jones, by chance, on a train. Brian was at the height of his success, with the world at his feet, yet just six years later he would be dead. THE STONES & BRIAN JONES looks at the relationships and rivalries within The Rolling Stones in those formative years. It explores the iconoclastic freedom and exuberance of the 60s, a time of social conflict and sexual turmoil which reflects on where we are today. Featuring revealing interviews with all the main players and unseen archive released for the first time, THE STONES & BRIAN JONES explores the creative musical genius of Jones, key to the success of the band, and uncovers how the founder of what became the greatest rock & roll band in the world was left behind in the shadows of history. Director / Producer / Writer / Narrator Nick Broomfield (Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer, Kurt and Courtney) joins us for a conversation on meeting Brian Jones, connecting with his middle class sensibility, telling much of the story through the women in his life, and Brian’s love of American Blues artist’s and their music.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-11-17-23%20Broomfield%20-%20Stomes%20%26%20Brian%20Jones.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: magpictures.com/thestonesandbrianjones\n\nThe Stones and Brian Jones is now available on VOD\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Nick Broomfield studied Law at Cardiff, and Political Science at Essex University, he then went onto study film at the National Film School, under Professor Colin Young. Nick first got interested aged 15 when discovering his love for photography on a foreign exchange visit in France. “A great way to strike up conversations, and a great excuse to ask questions about the World around you”. He made his first film ‘Who Cares’ about Slum Clearance in Liverpool, while at university, by borrowing a wind up Bolex camera, and shooting it on short ends. Professor Colin Young at the NFS had a great influence on his work encouraging participant observation, as well as introducing him to the lovely and most talented Joan Churchill. Together Joan and Nick made several films, ‘Juvenille Liaison’, Tattooed Tears’, ‘Soldier Girls’, ‘Lily Tomlin’, and more recently ‘Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer’. They also have a son together. Nick was originally influenced by the observational style of Fred Wiseman, and Robert Leacock and Pennebaker, before moving on largely by accident to the more idiosyncratic style for which he is better known. While making ‘Driving me Crazy’ in 1988 a film hopelessly out of control, Nick decided to place himself and the producer of the film in the story, as a way of making sense of the event. This experiment led to a sense of greater freedom, from the confines of observational cinema, and led to a more investigative and experimental type of filmmaking. ie ‘The Leader, the Driver and the Drivers Wife’, ‘Aileen Wuornos’, ‘Kurt and Courtney’ and ‘Biggie and Tupac’. Nick Broomfield is the recipient of the following awards amongst others, Sundance first prize, British Academy Award, Prix Italia, Dupont Peabody Award, Grierson Award, Hague Peace Prize, Amnesty International Doen Award.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nfacebook.com/MagnoliaPictures\n\nfacebook.com/nick.broomfield.7\n\ntwitter.com/MagnoliaPics\n\ntwitter.com/nickbroomfield1\n\ninstagram.com/magnoliapics\n\ninstagram.com/nickbroomfield\n\n100% on RottenTomatoes\n\n“A surprisingly poignant study of the Rolling Stones co-founder…” – Sheri Linden, Hollywood Reporter\n\n“Indeed, Broomfield has created the definitive documentary on the early days of the Rolling Stones; even more crucially, he has shown both how the Stones became THE STONES and the cost of that success.” – Christopher Schobert, The Film Stage\n\n“A brilliant exploration of the tortured soul of the founder of the Rolling Stones.” – James Verniere, Boston Herald\n\n“… An absorbing film which aims to restore Jones to his rightful place as a central figure in the story of The Rolling Stones.” – Anita Singh, Daily Telegraph (UK)\n\n“All told, “The Stones and Brian Jones” recaptures a wild time, the price at least one man paid and some of the collateral damage done in the process.” – Bob Strauss, San Francisco Chronicle\n\nThe Hite Report, a groundbreaking study of the intimate experiences of women, remains one of the bestselling books of all time since its publication in 1976. Drawn from anonymous survey responses, the book challenged restrictive conceptions of sex and opened a dialogue in popular culture around women’s pleasure. Its charismatic author, Shere Hite, a feminist sex researcher and former model, became the public messenger of women’s secret confessions. With each subsequent bestseller, she engaged television titans in unforgettably explicit debates about sexuality while suffering the backlash her controversial findings provoked. But few remember Shere Hite today. What led to her erasure? Digging into exclusive archives, as well as Hite’s personal journals and the original survey responses, filmmaker Nicole Newnham (Crip Camp, The Revolutionary Optimists) transports viewers back to a time of great societal transformation around sexuality. Her revelatory portrait is a re-discovery of a pioneer who has had an unmistakable influence on current conversations about gender, sexuality, and bodily autonomy, as well as a timely, cautionary tale of what too often happens to women who dare speak out.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-11-17-23%20Newnham%20-%20Shere%20Hite.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: ifcfilms.com/the-disappearance-of-shere-hite\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Nicole Newnham is an Oscar-nominated, Emmy-winning documentary producer and director, five-time Sundance Film Festival alumnus and six-time Emmy nominee.

Responding to patients, family members and hospital staff who are experiencing spiritual and emotional distress, chaplains sit at bedsides, helping people to deepen connections with themselves, one another, and a world beyond this one. A STILL SMALL VOICE follows Mati, a chaplain completing a year-long residency at New York City’s Mount Sinai Hospital, as she learns to provide spiritual care to people confronting profound life changes. Following his acclaimed 2019 film MIDNIGHT FAMILY, director Luke Lorentzen digs into Mati’s spiritual work as an entry point to explore how we seek meaning in suffering, uncertainty, and grief. Through Mati’s experiences with her patients, her struggle with professional burnout, and her own spiritual questioning, we gain new perspectives on how meaningful connection can be and how painful its absence is.
