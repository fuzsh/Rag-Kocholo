        "text": "🚨 GUYS… I’M HIRING! So, as you all know I moved back to Dubai in January and this time we’re on a roll! No partying, No distractions, No dating apps… Just focusing on work and preparing for all the cool projects on the horizon. (Which I’ll document and tell you more about when the time is right) 🤐 But now, help is needed! 🫵🤓 I’m a little stretched, with my brain bouncing around from project to project. So I’m on the look out for a social media assistant / content creator to come on board and give me a fresh perspective! To begin with, your main role will be helping me build and grow the social presence of a luxury ladies salon in Dubai ✨ You’ll be on-site, creating content, working with influencers and hopefully plugging my “salon life” knowledge gap (which I must say… spending a lot of time in a ladies salon has really opened my eyes) 👀🤣 But that’s only the beginning… There’s lots of other cool projects on the horizon to get involved in as well 👀 So yeah, if you’re interested or know anyone that might be, then please send me a DM 📲 And if you could like, share, comment etc to give this a little LinkedIn push that would be appreciated 🙏 *Applicants must be based in Dubai 🇦🇪 Have a great week!

Last week’s sales were no different. Hermès outperformed expectations as enthusiasm for its iconic Kelly and Birkin bags continues to mount, with many customers willing to buy deeply into the brand across categories. Ultra-luxe, so-called “quiet luxury” propositions outperformed for Italian companies, too: Zegna’s first-quarter sales climbed by 11 percent while Brunello Cucinelli surged 18 percent, defying predictions for a slowdown across the market. Meanwhile, Kering confirmed its forecast for a 10 percent year-on-year drop in first-quarter sales, and warned investors first-half profits would likely fall by 40 to 45 percent. “Gucci is not in the sweet spot for positioning — it’s seen as not enough high-end, not enough affordable,” chief financial officer Armelle Poulou said.
