Whether the\n\ncommodity is as basic as sugar, as dubious as opium or as mundane as the humble potato, when investigated closely it will be found to have had widespread ramifications and to have touched on many aspects of life in divers cultures. Indigo is one such commodity, cropping up in many fields of science and the arts: agriculture, economics, botany and chemistry, trade and industry, ethnography, costume, furnishings, the applied arts and even medicine and cosmetics. But in addition to the intriguing history of the subject, the aesthetic and technical aspects are often quite extra¬ ordinary. Its unique production methods with their spiritual associations, and the beauty of the colours produced on a wide range of textiles, have lent an aura of mystique which still lingers on today. And the universal adoption of indigo-blue jeans has united cultures worldwide. Until recently, most textile and carpet experts have focused their attention on weaving, embroidery and design. Even though colour is usually the first thing to strike the eye, and is the most definable and dominating aspect of a textile’s beauty, the means of producing colour Lengths of indigo-dyed cotton\n\nand creating coloured fibres have often been taken for granted. The skills\n\nhanging in the courtyard at\n\nof the weaver or embroiderer are indeed a source of wonder, but so too\n\nBayt Muhammad Ali Abud, Zabid, Yemen in 1983.\n\nare the transformations wrought by the dyer. And an understanding of the\n\nIndigo\n\nmanner in which colours have been obtained, processed and applied to all types of fibres throughout history increases the appreciation of textiles as well as being essential for the conservation of historic pieces. The choice of dyes and the status of dyers can help to illuminate the story of many cultures (particularly those with no written documentation). The colours used on textiles and artefacts, their social significance and the scope of their trade, are part and parcel of a people's overall history. It is only during the twentieth century that synthetic dyestuffs, invented in the second half of the previous century, became widely available. Before that, for well over four millennia, all dyestuffs were made from natural ingredients found mostly in the plant kingdom, with the exception of the important red insect dyes (kermes, cochineal and lac), some metallic oxides and the renowned shellfish purple dye. It is a strange fact that green, the colour of plants, is the one dye colour not obtainable from them. Innumerable plants yield yellow and brown dyes. These, along with the reds and blacks, belong to various groupings classifiable by their chemical structure. Indigo and its close relation shellfish purple are chemically in a class apart. They form the extra¬ ordinary ‘indigoid’ group, whose production methods are so intriguing that they still tantalize today’s organic chemists. The word indigo refers to the blue colouring matter extracted from the leaves of various plants including woad. Thanks to its unusual chemical make-up, indigo can be treated both as a dyestuff, in which case cloth or yarn is immersed in the dye vat, or as a blue pigment (sometimes referred to as ‘indigotin’) for paints and inks. European writers have tended to distinguish between imported indigo dyestuff made from tropical or subtropical indigo plants and that produced from home-grown woad plants, referring to the latter quite simply as ‘woad’. Elijah Bemiss, for example, observed in 1815: ‘We are not furnished but two drugs that give a permanent blue, and they are, indigo and woad.’1 The reason for distinguishing the two is that traditional processing of woad leaves produced a low indigo yield suitable for dyeing absorbent wool fibres, whereas the foreign indigo plants yielded much higher concentrations which were ideal for dyeing the less absorbent vegetable fibres such as cotton and flax. But chemically speaking all produce the same indigo blue. No other dyestuff has been valued by mankind so widely and for so long. One of the world’s oldest dyes, it remains the last natural dye used in places that have embraced synthetic dyes for every other colour. One of the eternal mysteries relating to dyeing with indigo is how did it all begin? This question can never be fully answered. Until recently a view prevailed that many textile technologies, including that of indigo dyeing,\n\n2\n\nFranco-Flemish tapestry, c.1500, of\n\nThe Hunt of the Unicorn. Here the unicorn dips his horn into the stream to rid it of poison. Silk, wool and silver-gilt threads (3.68 x 3.78m).\n\nIntroduction - The Myth and the Magic\n\nIndigo\n\ndispersed outwards from India, the ‘home’ of textiles. The influence of Indian techniques in general can hardly be overestimated, but it is now accepted that in the distant past people discovered how to dye fibres blue with the various indigo plants independently at different times and in different places, even in those which later embraced from elsewhere new species and more efficient production methods to meet an expanding demand. Given that dyeing with indigo is a complex procedure, and that different plant sources require different treatments before they wall yield their dye, it is remarkable how many civilizations appear to have discov¬ ered the secrets on their own. Perhaps some damaged indigo leaves were soaked with stale urine or ash liquid left over from a wood fire; both could have coloured fibres blue under favourable conditions. The puzzling origins of indigo are embedded in numerous ancient legends, suggesting a role in indigenous textile cultures stretching back over several thousand years. Southeast Asian mythology, for example, is full of indigo stories.2 In Liberia a tale is told of the way post-menopausal women gained from the High God the secret of blue dyeing with indigo thanks to a seeress who broke off a piece of blue sky to eat (after which the sky was pulled up high out of reach).3 Even allowing for changing visual perceptions over the centuries, all the discoverers of indigo dyestuff must surely have been amazed and delighted by its colour, for most available hues in the ancient world are related to the earth palette. Cave painters, for example, were limited to mineral pigments of red, ochre, brown, black and white. The rareness of blue dyes compared with yellows is echoed in the vegetable kingdom at large. Blue flowers are much less common than yellow for example, and edible blue substances are almost non-existent. So finding that nature could produce a colourfast blue dyestuff by a process akin to alchemy must have been an extraordinary revelation, whose impact is hard to imagine in today’s multi¬ coloured world. Once discovered there was certainly no looking back. Now that natural indigo plants are only grown on a small scale, whether for the traditional practitioner, the hobby dyer or for modest commercial revival, it is hard to envisage the extent of the indigo industry in the past, or the effects it has had on all kinds of social, cultural, political and more concrete aspects of community life.

As a\n\nChina, 1995.\n\ncommodity traded between the continents by land and sea, indigo pro¬ duced a substantial income for the countries dealing in it long before it featured as a hugely profitable field for colonial exploitation. Many aspects of life, including lasting monuments such as the fine woad\n\n4\n\nIntroduction - The Myth and the Magic\n\nmerchants’ houses which dominate the elegant centre of French Toulouse, many grand buildings in Calcutta, and a school and library in America’s Georgetown have profited from woad or indigo wealth. Income from woad grown on their estates even contributed to the fortune of the Spencer ancestors of the late Diana, Princess of Wales.4 The catch phrase ‘universal’ has frequently been applied to indigo, and with just cause. Not only do indigo-bearing plants grow in most corners of the globe, in both tropical, subtropical and temperate climates, but the dyestuff extracted from them has a unique chemistry which renders it compatible with every type of natural fibre, both animal and vegetable, unlike other natural dyes. Indigo is one of the most colourfast of natural dyes, well demonstrated by the countless medieval and Renaissance tapestries exposed to daylight over the centuries, whose former green foliage has reverted to blue due to a process known as ‘preferential fading’ or, unflatteringly, as ‘blue disease’. Yellows are by nature notoriously fugitive and most other colours tend to become duller as they fade. Indigo blue always retains its beautiful hue even if it grows paler, hence the only original colour of the Bayeux tapestry that remains true is the indigo blue of its woad-dyed wools. Perhaps most importantly of all, the range of colours relying on indigo was enormous, as it was required for much of the spectrum as well as blue. Purple dyes are scarce in nature, and most blacks were unsatisfactory, based as they were on corrosive metallic compounds; but indigo, in combination with yellow, red and brown dyes, could provide these shades and greens.5 The medieval European dyer used woad in the creation of most colours, and even in the early eighteenth century a German text declares of woad that ‘the Colour ... is always good and the best and most necessary Ingredient for Dying [sic], since ‘tis used in the Composition of most Dyes, which can neither be rendered good or lasting without it’.6 Late nineteenth century European dye manuals still describe the indigo/woad vat as essential for ‘bottoming’ cloth,7 and dyers worldwide have considered that a final dyeing with indigo would generally make fabrics more colourfast and longer lasting. One Indian dye book describes the production of endless subtle colours ranging from ‘regal purple’ to the ‘colour of kidney beans’ and ‘light canary’, all of them made in Gujarat from indigo combinations.8 There is no other dyestuff with such a comprehensive application. The double attraction of indigo as a clothing dye has always been a combination of practicality and widespread availability. We talk of patches of blue sky being the size of‘Dutchman’s trousers’and refer to ‘blue-collar workers’ because the standard dress for the working people of Europe, as of China, Japan and many other countries, was tailored from cloth dyed in\n\n5\n\nIndigo\n\nindigo. In many societies the native word for indigo still refers primarily to the substance, rather than to its colour. This was also the case in the West before Sir Isaac Newton, in 1672, fused his theories on musical and colour harmony by introducing orange and indigo to the five more prominent colours of the spectrum (a decision that has aroused much controversy).9 However, over the centuries indigo has accumulated layers of significance and symbolism, although there may be a tendency in the West to exag¬ gerate or even misinterpret these aspects. Some symbolic associations do indeed relate to its actual colour, but many others arose out of its chemical mysteries and durability. Any country woman could gather plant material from the surrounding countryside, boil it up with some wool and a pinch of alum and produce warm earthy shades with varying degrees of fastness. But the only way she could obtain colourfast blue yarn or cloth was by resorting to the specialist, who guarded his or her secrets well. Even where people did learn to use indigo plants at a domestic level, they had to acquire a particular expertise to ensure satisfactory results, for indigo dye behaves in a remarkable, sometimes seemingly capricious, way. This is a main reason why indigo became a special, and often expensive, dye around which many myths, superstitions and religious rituals evolved over the centuries. These will be covered in subsequent chapters, as will medicinal, cosmetic, artistic and other usages (from Classical times to the present), which frequently intertwined with indigo’s other qualities to enhance its esteem and mystique. In many cultures indigo blue has of course been equally valued for aesthetic reasons, and continues to be so, although here too its symbolism can be as mystifying as the dye bath itself. It echoes the infinite richness of the sea, the midnight sky, the shadowy d usk and early dawn, and represents the elusive seventh colour of the rainbow which some people simply cannot see. In the medieval and Byzantine worlds blue was associated with divinity and humility, and in India with infinity and the capricious god Krishna. Many see it as a spiritual or reassuring colour, standing for loyalty, as opposed to yellow, the colour of cowards. Although indigo represented happiness for the craftsman William Morris, for many it evokes ‘the blues’, both in mood and in music. ‘Mood Indigo’, Duke Ellington’s immortal song, provokes a sense of blue melancholy also expressed by Goethe, Picasso and others. Some societies, including Islamic and Indonesian, which consider indigo ‘dark’, or ‘black’, have linked indigo directly with ‘black magic’. In addition to serving as trade goods and gifts, textiles have always been used as a channel for cultural and religious expression, particularly in ethnic communities with no written language. Consequently the producers of special textiles, often women, have been able to gain\n\n6\n\nBedouin tribal rug of Jordan (detail).\n\nIntroduction - The Myth and the Magic\n\neconomic, social or even political power thanks to the expertise required to make them.10 Indigo, with certain other dyes, has played a major part in the production of textiles imbued with symbolic power. Garments which included dark indigo-dyed threads, indicating wealth and therefore, by extension, prestige, were used for important burials in, for instance, Ancient Egypt, Palestine, Mali and Peru. No one knows when indigodyed cloth first became involved in mourning rituals in cultures as far apart as those of West Africa and Indonesia, but clearly the transform¬ ations intrinsic to the dye vat were perceived as reflecting the spiritually Sharada Utsava pecchava\n\ntransforming rites of passage of life itself.

Specific indigo-dyed textiles, such as the turban, have long been used as a mark of initiation, reward or status. On the other hand some, such as faded blue work clothes, have been chosen deliberately as an anti¬ establishment political statement: most notably, in their earlier days, blue denim jeans, the most widespread and enduring post-war sartorial statement. Whatever its associations, indigo blue is cool and relaxing, counter¬ balancing the warm end of the spectrum. It contrasts with certain other colours to impressive effect; in textiles the red/blue and blue/white combinations in particular have always been popular. What could be more harmonious than the blend of madder reds with indigo blues on many central Asian tribal rugs or the morinda reds and indigo blues of an Indonesian ikat? The fashion for blue and white, expressed famously in porcelain, could also be indulged, thanks to indigo, in textiles. There could be few more striking sights than a tall Nigerian woman enveloped in a boldly patterned blue-and-white adire cloth or a Japanese woman in an ikat kimono. Not only is its colour satisfying, but the singular chemistry of indigo’s dyeing processes, whether using natural or synthetic indigo, allies exceptionally well with many popular textile-patterning techniques,\n\n7\n\nIndigo\n\nWoman and her baby wearing an indigo stitch-resist wrap of an 'old African' design, standing beside a field of guinea com.

And even when it ages indigo retains, again thanks to its special chemistry, its inimitable blue. The Japanese cultural appreciation of the aesthetics of age places great value on the special qualities of faded indigo11 — as does anyone who wears blue jeans. And it is the Japanese, whose culture manages to combine modern high technology with traditional material culture, who elevate indigo growers and dyers to the status of ‘national living treasure’. Even with the huge range of synthetic dyestuffs available to the industry today, the fashion pages continue to extol the unique and timeless attractions of indigo-dyed clothing. To fulfil this constant demand the manufacturers of synthetic indigo, produced in a different way from all other modern dyes, play a major part in the continuing story' of indigo. As the chemical company Zeneca’s promotional literature puts it: ‘Indigo continues to survive and flourish in the face of severe competition from today’s most sophisticated dyestuffs as it continues to play a unique role in serving a textile market that is both ancient and modern, linking technologies that are centuries apart.’ For the researcher there is an abundance of information on certain aspects of indigo production, particularly concerning its commercial exploitation in the colonial period, but a paucity of sources, or even downright misinformation, on others. For example, botanical identifica¬ tion often needs revising, apart from the ongoing re-classification of plant species which applies directly to some of the indigo-bearing genera. Dye processes have sometimes been recorded by those unfamiliar with the unusual chemistry of the indigo vat so that, to give a specific example, mordants are often assumed to be required, as they are for most dyes, even though a defining feature of indigo dye is that no mordant is needed. Furthermore, indigo dyers the world over have been reluctant to yield up their hard-earned secrets to outsiders, for fear of rivals or of the wrath of malevolent spirits. Historical revisionism can be disquieting too. Julius Caesar’s lines about the Ancient Britons painting themselves with woad to appear fierce in battle are much quoted, but the translation of vitrum as ‘woad’is questioned by some. Marco Polo is a much-cited source for the first detailed description of the production of indigo in north-west India, yet one scholar has recently suggested that the famous Venetian traveller actually composed his so-called ‘travels’ from a compendium of existing written sources.12 If his descriptions of indigo production were indeed relayed at first remove, they must lose some of their edge. As the world’s interest in natural dyestuffs increases, and historical examples are more rigorously scrutinized, more information emerges to revise and extend our knowledge. The story of indigo, in its various guises, will surely never end.\n\n9\n\nchapter two\n\n[Send] a man cunning to work in gold\n\n. .\n\n. and in ipuryle, and crimson, and blue\n\n(king SOLOMON TO THE KING OF TYRE)\n\nFrom Antiquity to the Middle Ases I\n\nndigo has had an exceptionally long innings in the fields of industry and commerce. The last two millennia of indigo’s economic history are neatly\n\nencapsulated in its names. The word indigo itself derives from the Greek indikon, Latinized indicum, originally meaning a substance from India, indicating the import of indigo pigment by the Graeco-Roman world. The Sanskrit word nila, meaning dark blue, spread from India eastwards into Southeast Asia and westwards to the Near and Middle East, probably both through pre-Islamic trading routes and with the subsequent trade diffusion of the product in the Islamic era.1 The Arabs conveyed their word nil, or, with the definite article, an-nil, further west in the course of their conquests across northern Africa and into southern Spain. Subsequently the Spanish and Portuguese transmitted the words anil and anilera to Central and South America in the sixteenth century. In that century, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, a British Act of Parliament referred to indigo as ‘nele, alias blew Inde’, while European travellers’ and merchants’ reports interchange neel/anyle with indico. In the seventeenth century indigo became the common name, but a reminder of indigo’s etymological history survives into modern times with the word for a class of dye, Stained glass window of woad dyers in the medieval Barfusserkirche, Erfurt, Germany.\n\n‘aniline’, so named because indigo formed the basis of the first dyestuff to °\n\nJ\n\nbe chemically synthesized (see the Glossary).\n\nii\n\nIndigo\n\nThis chapter will look at the evidence of the earliest uses of indigo dye produced from tropical and subtropical indigo plants as well as from temper¬ ate woad plants, and will consider its widespread importance during Europe’s Middle Ages and equivalent periods elsewhere before the wholesale changes brought about by European colonial expansion. Specific uses in a wide variety of textiles throughout history will be covered in Chapter Seven. Inevitably the further back in time that dyestuffs are traced, the more reliance has to be placed on archaeological sources, and unfortunately organic substances (such as vegetable dyes and the materials they coloured) are the most perishable. Nevertheless, more systematic examination of textile finds and of botanical specimens is gradually fitting together more parts of the jigsaw.2 Although the dating of fragments is a different issue from identifying dyestuffs found in them, the two aspects can sometimes throw light on each other. Accurate dating remains a particular minefield, often requiring revision as new evidence emerges. There is always the danger that archaeological excavations will create false emphases, based as they often are on areas with elaborate burial customs and where arid or anaerobic climatic conditions have favoured the preservation of artefacts. Furthermore, the survival of dyed fibres depends not only on surrounding conditions but also on the ageing effects of the various dye ingredients themselves. This arbitrary selectivity was until recently often reinforced by a tendency among archaeologists to undervalue, or even discard, textile finds, and among textile historians to take colours for granted without exploring their source. Archaeological evidence is sometimes underpinned by early written sources or visual material such as wall paintings, but certain aspects are bound to be speculative and there is still much to discover. Excavated fragments reveal that indigo dyestuff, from whatever plant source, was already in use by the third millennium\n\nbc.\n\nIn general the iden¬\n\ntity of dyestuffs used on ancient artefacts cannot be deduced by colour, as this alters owing to changes over time, and in any case dyes were often combined to create particular colours. Where indigo was used alone, however, it does retain its blue hue, even if it fades, and its presence can be simply established by scientific analysis. But despite increasingly sophisticated analytical equipment and methods, dye chemists are unable to identify the plant species used on dyed fibres (or even to distinguish natural from synthetic indigo, although carbon-14 techniques are getting close). In future more maybe learnt by examining other compounds, including contaminants, present in a sampled The botanical source can, however, sometimes be guessed at by the provenance and date of a sample or by the analysis of other natural dyestuffs present whose dating and provenance are known.\n\n12\n\nFrom Antiquity to the Middle Ages\n\nThe ancient world Decorative bodily adornment has its roots in earliest history. At some stage different prehistoric peoples invented the weaving loom, and they coloured woven cloth and other materials by applying to their surfaces pigments (with a binding medium) and other substances which were not generally colourfast. The harder skill was also acquired of actually dyeing threads, which involves creating a chemical bond between fibre and colouring substance in solution. Dyed threads could then be inserted into weavings for more permanent decorative effect than could be achieved with surface pigments. Considering the complexities of dyeing with the indigo-bearing plants it is remarkable to find its early use by very diverse and geographically separate civilizations.\n\nEgypt In Ancient Egypt, where blue colours were revered, many archaeological textile frag¬ ments have been preserved thanks to the dry climate, sterile sand and local burial customs. The country’s woven textiles were widely esteemed, and weavers began to insert rare blue stripes into the borders of plain linen mummy cloths from the Fifth Dynasty (c.2400\n\nbc),\n\nprobably because\n\nonly indigo dye is well absorbed by flax fibres.

There is much speculation about the source of the indigo dyestuff used for Egyptian and other early eastern Mediterranean textiles.5 Indigo dye made from indigofera species could conceivably have been amongst the luxury goods traded northwards up the Red Sea from Punt or from southern Arabia, possibly even by the third millennium\n\nbc.6\n\nSouthern\n\nArabia, with its incense revenues and pivotal trading position straddling the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea and East Africa, was a wealthy region\n\n*3\n\nIndigo\n\nwhose renowned spice and textile trade could have included indigo, either locally produced or transported from further East. But even if this was the case, its import costs would probably have excluded its use in Egyptian dye vats. It is botanically possible that local indigofera species could have been used for blue dye by the Ancient Egyptians, but it is most likely that they made use of the woad plant, Isatis tinctoria L., indigenous in parts of north Africa as well as in Europe and western Asia, even though it is much less efficient as a source of indigo dye than the tropical and subtropical indigo plants, particularly for dyeing cellulosic fibres. Hieroglyphic inscriptions, such as those at the largely Ptolemaic temple of Dendera,7 which show the Egyptians’ appreciation of several different shades of blue, mention plants producing a blue colour resembling lapis lazuli, but botanical identification remains hazy.8 Whichever dye source was used, the Egyptian dyer was clearly highly skilled long before the appearance of written evidence from Hellenistic Egypt in the form of second-to-third-century ad Greek papyri, particularly the Holmiensis, or ‘Stockholm’, papyrus which describes harvesting and dyeing with woad.9 A urine fermentation method was employed (see p.124), adding local soapwort (still being used by Omani indigo dyers in the 1980s), and often overdyeing with madder or lichen dye to imitate the shellfish purple so highly sought after by this time. (Even today people of Oaxaca in Mexico will taste purple-dyed fabric to ensure they are not being palmed off with an indigo and red fake.)10\n\nShellfish purple It would be absurd to discuss indigo in the ancient world, particularly the eastern Mediterranean, without mentioning the closely related shell¬ fish dye which was extracted from species belonging to the Muricidae and Thaididae families. This was famously used by aristocratic Phoenicians, Romans and Byzantines, hence the common epithet ‘Royal’, ‘Imperial’ or ‘Tyrian’ (for Tyre produced the best quality). Purple dye became the trade¬ mark of the Phoenicians. It reached its apogee as a status symbol during the Roman and Byzantine empires before its relegation to the sidelines of dye history following the Turkish conquest of Constantinople in 1453. Thereafter knowledge of its production methods vanished. No one knows whether the technology for indigo dyeing preceded that for shellfish purple or vice versa, as both seem to date back to the third millennium\n\nBC.U\n\nDespite shellfish being of animal origin, as opposed to the vegetable indigo, the chemical composition of the extracted dyestuffs differs by just one or two bromine atoms12 and until fairly recently they were sometimes confused, as indigo is the basic component of both. For instance, ancient\n\n14\n\nFrom Antiquity to the Middle Ages\n\nindigo-dyed textiles which had been rinsed in sea water or buried in saline soil (both of which contain bromine) have sometimes been mistakenly analyzed as dyed with shellfish purple. Moreover plant indigo itself can appear purplish due to the presence of natural red indirubin (see p.132). References to dyed textiles in the Old Testament are ambiguous, as they do not describe precise colours or dye substances. However, it is generally accepted that the Hebrew word argaman refers to a reddish-purple colour while tekhelet was used for blue or blue-purple, although standard translations of the Hebrew are imprecise. The exact shades may never be known since, despite all the literary references, extant textile samples are rare. Shellfish purple residue has, however, been found on potsherds of Ancient Israel thought to have formed clay dye vessels.13 Dyed textiles had great significance in Jewish religious ritual. Hebrew law, for example, prescribed the wearing of tekhelet fringes and tassels, which are presumed to have been dyed with shellfish purple. The main attraction in biblical times was probably not so much colour as prestige relating to its animal origins and its high cost. Even today, for those of orthodox Jewish faith, investigation into this mysterious dyestuff often has a religious rather than an aesthetic motivation. Pliny gives an incomplete account of production in Roman times14 and Vitruvius notes the effects of sea temperature on the final colour.15 Dyeing methods, climatic conditions and seasons would certainly have affected the outcome, but it is generally accepted that in the Mediterranean the main reddish species were Murex brandaris and Purpura haemastoma while the hermaphrodite Murex trunculus produced the bluer hues. Indeed, as well as purple this mollusc apparently contains pure indigo.16 Some scientists have suggested that this may be due to a sex change, the bluer colours being produced during the masculine phase. (Dare one suggest this as a possible origin of the expression ‘blue for a boy, pink for a girl’?) Huge quantities of shellfish had to be killed (about 10,000 to obtain one gram of dye) in order to extract from the tiny hypobranchial glands enough of the photo-sensitive whitish secretion containing the precursor to purple. Beaches in Tyre and Sidon as well as Crete are still piled with heaps of left-over shell deposits. (In Central America, where the ancient practice of shellfish purple dyeing still survives today, the glands of Purpura patula are ‘milked’ without harming the whelks, and used directly on yarn wetted in sea water.)17 Shellfish purple dyers, like those for indigo, needed specialist knowledge. Many dye chemists today are experimenting with purple shell¬ fish,18 but no one has yet established the precise process by which the ancients used this elusive dye. Moreover, emulating the scale of their dyeing operations is inconceivable today.\n\n15\n\nIndigo\n\nAncient Israel and Palestine Archaeological textile fragments, and warnings in the Talmud (the fundamental body of Jewish laws and traditions codified around ad\n\n200)\n\nagainst counterfeit shellfish purple, reveal that a fake purple colour was created by combining indigo with a red dye, usually madder. These two, used both separately and combined, are in any case the main dyes found on textiles of Ancient Israel and Palestine, and indigo was also combined with other dyes to produce greens and blacks. Indigo makes its appearance here from the end of the second millennium\n\nbc;\n\nas in Egypt, it is the only\n\ncolour found on the earliest dyed linen fragments. Examples from Kuntillet Ajrud, thought to be Iron Age, already feature indigo, but it becomes much more common on later finds, of wool as well as of linen. This is especially the case from around the beginning of the Classical/early Christian period, in such finds as those from the desert sites of Masada, Qumran and the Cave of Letters (where madder and insect red, saffron and tannins have also been identified).19 Symbolic geometric patterns in blue decorate scraps of the linen wrappers used to encase the urns which contained the Dead Sea scrolls.\n\nSemite women of the Aamu tribe of southern Palestine.

In theory blue dye (from woad) could have been used as early as around 6000\n\nBC\n\nin\n\nthe Near East, for evidence at the early Neolithic site of Qatalhoyiik in southern Anatolia suggests knowledge of dyes at that time.20 Coloured textiles of the third millen¬ nium\n\nbc\n\nhave been found in Anatolia. Babylonian texts of\n\nthe early second millennium from the palace halls of Mari on the Euphrates mention ‘garments dyed in blue’, and the Part of a cuneiform tablet, c.6oo bc, from Ancient Babylonia, which gives the world's earliest written instruc¬\n\ntextual evidence is supported by numerous fragments of wall paintings depicting several shades of blue.21 At a later date in the region there is ample evidence of the use of indigo,\n\ntions for wool dyeing, including indigo recipes.\n\nincluding traces of indigo pigment decorating a Roman parade shield discovered at Dura Europos, just upstream from Mari. Indigo resist-dyed cotton and the more usual woollen dyed yarns for the pile textiles have also been found among the thousands of specimens, dated late second century bc\n\nto fifth century ad, excavated in the at-Tar burial caves of south-western\n\nIraq, a Silk Road trading centre.22 Analyses of first-to-third-century ad textile fragments found in tombs at Palmyra further north-west, reveal shellfish purple, an indigo/kermes (red) combination and plain indigo.23 The most exciting recent development concerning early dye history is the discovery in 1993 in the British Museum of another section of a neoBabylonian cuneiform tablet, dated to the seventh century bc. Joining the two clay fragments together enabled about half of a seventy line text to be deciphered. This unique tablet contains the first known recipes for dyeing wool.24 Of particular interest are the recipes for both base colours and colour mixes. One clearly describes indigo dyeing, with its characteristic repeated dippings and airings necessary to produce ‘lapis-coloured wool’ (■uqnatu), but does not mention the dye source (Indian indigo may have reached Mesopotamia by this time).25 Other recipes describe overdyeing to produce reddish and bluish purples (using the words argamannu and takiltu — the similarity with the Hebrew terms is striking). Yemen has a long history of dyeing with indigo and also as a centre for the East-West luxury goods trade.26 These may have included dyed textiles long before the Christian era. There are tantalizing references to ‘blue cloth’ in the Bible — for example, Ezekiel 27: 24 describes ‘blue clothes and broidered work’ being traded by merchants of Sheba and elsewhere in the sixth century bc, but not the origin of the cloth nor the dyes used. When indigo was used in Yemen the source would have been local or imported dye from species of indigofera as woad does not grow there.\n\n17\n\nIndigo\n\nCentral, southern and eastern Asia Much of Asia has a humid, tropical climate destructive to organic materials. But this is not the case to the north in central Asia, where, in the Altai Mountains in 1949, was discovered the sensational Pazyrykrug, preserved in ice since its burial in the fourth or third century bc. It is the oldest and most impressive example of pile weaving. Although of unknown provenance, the quality of its weaving and design details suggests an urban context. The wide bands surrounding the central field depict horsemen, deer and griffins in the contrasting crimson of ‘Polish’ cochineal and soft indigo blue.27 In other places religious beliefs and attitudes have discouraged burial and the preservation of used clothing. Both this factor and a seasonal high humidity apply in India, the subcontinent that has exerted the greatest influ¬ ence on the history of textiles worldwide. Finds from the important Indus valley site of Mohenjo Daro indicate that by the second millennium\n\nbc\n\nIndian textile technologies were already highly developed. It is probable that indigo-dyeing skills had developed by then too, but early samples of Indian dyed textiles are rare and none exists to confirm the use of indigo.28 Evidence for its use in India before the medieval period is therefore based on written sources. These include Classical texts like the famous Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, written by an anonymous trader in Egypt in the first century ad.29 As India was the linchpin of early trade both eastwards and westwards, and her people were so highly accomplished in the textile arts, much technical know-how would have filtered along the trading routes, and subsequently her trade textiles were to have an enormous impact globally. China, too, has always been renowned for the quality and colouring of its textiles, particularly of silk, which were widely traded along the legen¬ dary Silk Road linking it to the West from the second century silk fragments from the third millennium\n\nbc\n\nbc.\n\nWoven\n\nhave been found, and tombs\n\nand cave burials have yielded many fine examples from the first millennium bc\n\nonwards 30 which reveal a sophisticated variety of textile techniques.31\n\nThere are many specimens of multi-coloured textiles from the Han period (206\n\nbc—AD\n\n220) in the world’s museums.32 A famous\n\nconcentration of archaeological finds from this period and later comes from the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas at Dunhuang, an important trading centre on the border between Gansu and Xinjiang provinces, where the Silk Road divided into a northern and southern route. The caves were re-discovered by Sir Marc Aurel Stein at the beginning of the twentieth century. Among artefacts recovered were many textile pieces, spanning the Han to Tang\n\n18\n\n(ad\n\n618-906)\n\nNine fragments found by the archaeologist Marc Aurel Stein in a military fort near Dunhuang in western China.

In addition to using dyed threads for embroidery and woven patterns, reserve-dyed techniques such as clamp-, paste-, wax- and tie-resists (see Chapter Six) were practised from the first centuries\n\nad,\n\noften dyed with indigo.33 As for Southeast Asia, Indian Indigofera tinctoria seems to have been introduced to the drier parts of the Indonesian archipelago around the end of the first millennium\n\nbc,\n\nalong\n\nwith the Sanskrit word for indigo, nilad4 There is plenty of evidence for textile production generally in the area earlier than this, as well as trade with southern China and the Indian subcontinent which\n\nDetail from the Pazyryk carpet,\n\nintensified towards the end of the first millennium\n\nfourth or third century bc.\n\nbc.\n\nAlthough textile\n\nDye analysis has revealed\n\nremains are scarce for the early period, a variety of fibres and woven textiles appear to have been in use.

Central and South America, most famously Peru, were no exception. Of paramount importance economically for trade and local use, textiles had great social, political and religious significance.37 The dyed textiles found in Peruvian graves at Paracas, Nazca, Chancay and elsewhere have, like those of Ancient Egypt, been exceptionally well preserved thanks to the arid coastal climate.

The vivid red obtained from the cochineal insect led the field, but indigo was among the vegetable dyes used on the astonishing woven, embroidered, tie-dyed and otherwise ornamented examples still surviving. As indigo was mysterious, powerful and less common it was often chosen to emphasize prestigious symbols.38 Jumping ahead to complete this geographical survey, the later Inca are said to have valued textiles above gold, and sixteenth-century Spanish chroniclers marvelled at the quality of Inca and Aztec weaving and dyeing.39 Few mountain Inca samples survive, due to the damp climate, but one excavated woman’s grave, now in the Museo Amano in Lima, contained a workbox with spindle and balls of dyed cotton badly faded apart from those dyed in strong indigo blue.40Unusual post-Conquest Peruvian tapestries include Spanish designs in the traditional coastal colour scheme.41 In Central America, too, sixteenth-century Spanish historians noted the local importance of fine textiles as gifts at festivals and weddings and to signify rank.42 Here, as in Ancient Egypt, blue was generally a revered colour. The Aztecs also used indigo as medicine, and are responsible for the common name in the region for the ‘blue herb’, iquilite.43 The Mayans mixed indigo with a rare clay mineral to produce ‘Maya Blue’ paint, widely used for painting on murals, sculptures and ceramics, as well as textiles.44\n\n22\n\nFrom Antiquity to the Middle Ages\n\nEurope Archaeological textiles from Europe are fairly rare, as their survival has depended upon special conditions such as peat bog deposits. Enough discoveries have emerged though to show that Europe’s neolithic ancestors were producing textiles in the fourth millennium\n\nbc,\n\nfirst using vegetable\n\nfibres and later wool. Textiles dyed blue with indigo from woad appear in the early Iron Age (c.700\n\nbc).45\n\nDating from the first centuries\n\nad\n\nare many\n\nimportant north European finds such as the famous ‘Thorsberg mantle’ from Germany, which was checked in shades of blue, and from Denmark garments of blue or blue-and-red check weaves.46 Woad has also been detected on ‘Roman’ Iron Age textiles from Polish cemeteries.47 Although archaeoPeruvian tapestry (detail), post-\n\nbotanical evidence of woad in northern Europe has existed for some time,48\n\nConquest, probably seventeenth\n\nit was only in 1992 that evidence from Iron Age England came to light49 to\n\ncentury.

The Classical authors, with their passion for recording information, were the first to attempt to understand the origins of the indigo pigment imported from India to the Mediterranean as a luxury item for painting, cosmetic and medicinal use. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea records trade in indikon across the Indian Ocean. As indigo was traded in hard stone-like lumps, a common misconception (which persisted in some parts of Europe even into the eighteenth century!) that it was a mineral is understandable. However, in the first century ad Dioscorides, the Greek pharmacologist and botanist,50 and his (Roman) contemporary Pliny the Elder,51 apparently realized the vegetable nature of indigo, describing it as froth exuding from ‘Indian reeds’. Pliny also mentions a ‘second kind’ of indigo, the purplish scum floating on a dye vat, presumably of woad or even of shellfish purple. It can be assumed that in Pliny’s day the Romans used native woad for blue dyeing, for with imported indigo pigment at twenty denarii a pound, around fifteen times the average daily wage, the several pounds required for a dye vat would have been prohibitive even if they had known how to use it.52 Pliny, like Vitruvius a century before,53 notes the use of indigo pigment for fresco paintings, and warns of a counterfeit product made from pigeons’ dung or chalk stained with woad but detectable, he writes, with a simple burning test.54\n\n23\n\nIndigo\n\nChild's tunic, wool with tapestry-woven ornamentation. Egypt, nine-tenth century ad.\n\nBy the second century ad the Romans appear to have encouraged the cultivation in their empire of oriental indigo plants as well as woad. There was such flourishing trade with India that maybe technologies, too, were shared. In Roman Palestine, according to Forbes, indigo was known as indaco or kallainos (a word which may have derived from Sanskrit).” This suggests indigofera as the source, for woad was known by its Greek name, Isatis.56 In Egypt the dyeing industry was well organized by the Romans. An excavated Roman dye workshop at Athribis (near Sohag in Upper Egypt, still an indigo centre in the twentieth century) contained sixteen dye vats, most stained blue with woad/indigo.57 Textiles found at many Roman sites reveal a varied knowledge of techniques and colours, although their prove¬ nance is hard to establish. At one, a late first or second century ad Roman desert fortress site on the caravan route linking the Red Sea and the Nile, fragments even include resist-dyed indigo-blue wool.58 At the Nubian site of Qasr Ibrim, indigo was the main dye used on some exceptional late Roman temple furnishings made of cotton.59 Many spectacular tapestrywoven and resist-dyed hangings, of wool and of linen, were produced during the overlapping late Roman and early Christian eras.60 Most of the resist-dyed pieces were found at the famous linen-weaving centre of Akhmirn (near today’s Sohag), the majority dyed with indigo blue. Concentrated tropical indigo would more easily have dyed hangings of linen and cotton than woad, but the dye source is uncertain.\n\nThe Artemis indigo resist-dyed linen hanging (detail).

The Vikings traded in exotic textiles from the Near East to feed Europe’s developing taste, as well as introducing their own high quality textiles. Many excavated Viking samples have been analyzed for dyes at York in the north of England, an impor¬ tant Viking centre.61 It is clear from these that the use of woad was widespread, and that blue was a common colour for clothes for the living, as well as being associated, according to Icelandic sagas, with the goddess of death.62\n\nNear East In the Near East the highlights of the early Christian era are the wonderful Egyptian textiles, mainly dating from the third to ninth centuries, known as ‘Coptic’ or ‘Late Antique’ (or, more vaguely, ‘Post-Pharaonic’). Earlier examples have been mentioned above, but haphazard nineteenth-century excavations have caused havoc with chronology. Coptic weavers were famed for their skills, and thousands of dyed examples survive, mainly tunics, in which the predominant colours are blues of all shades, reds and purples. For the purples and blacks indigo was combined with madder,63 and more rarely with kermes, lac or Armenian cochineal, and for green with yellow weld. Shellfish purple, a Coptic dictionary definition being ‘genuine purple’, is rarely found, so perhaps some of the orders for ‘purple cloth’ noted in Coptic texts meant the vegetable purple combination. Nevertheless, when the value of money was fluctuating, shellfish purpledyed wool could be a preferred form of investment, dowry or legacy. Contemporaneously with ‘Coptic’textiles many luxurious silks were being produced in the Near and Middle East, most notably in the Byzantine and Sassanian Empires; in the sixth century the latter stretched from Western Iraq to Central Asia. The few magnificent Sassanian woven silks that survive have mainly indigo in their designs.64 Dating to the same period is a woollen flat-weave carpet fragment with red and blue woven designs excavated in Persian Khorasan, where the oldest evidence of a Persian pile carpet was also found.65\n\n25\n\nIndigo\n\nFar East In the Far East fine dyed silks were produced in abundance, as already noted for China. Indigo was also widely used to dye bast fibres and cotton as cultivation of the latter spread slowly eastwards from the Indus valley. It is thought that the indigo plant and ways to use it probably came to Japan from China by way of Korean artisans together with Buddhism, in about the fifth century ad. The influence of Chinese cosmology with its complex systems of colour coding, and the indigenous Japanese reverence towards the natural world, created a highly developed appreciation of the intricate subtleties and significances of colour in that country.66 Thousands of textiles of the Nara period\n\n(ad\n\n646—794), produced both locally in Japan\n\nand in China, have been preserved in the unique Shoso-in repository in Nara thanks to careful packaging in sturdy wooden chests. Indigo features both in these sumptuous Nara woven silk textiles and in resist-dyed cloths which used the three ancient techniques (known collectively as sankechi) of wax-resist, clamp-resist and tie-dyeing.67 In subsequent centuries the use of indigo in Japan increased enormously.\n\nAfrica Sub-Saharan Africa is famous for exotic clothing and weaving, but its climate could hardly be less favourable to the preservation of textiles. Studies by Boser-Sarivaxevanis of the development of textile techniques suggest that knowledge of indigo dyeing, which goes hand-in-hand with cotton production, probably diffused from three main centres, one in the old ‘Ghana Empire’ (which collapsed in the eleventh century) of Upper Senegal, and the other two in Nigeria — the south-western Yoruba region and (later) the northern Hausa region.68 But there was almost no concrete evidence of early weaving and clothing until an archaeological expedition to the Dogon region of Mali between 1964 and 1974 made some sensational finds.69 The Dogon people’s unique villages, way of life, myths, carvings and extraordinary festivals have been the subject of much anthropological study. Their predecessors, the now vanished Tellem people, also lived in the strange Bandiagara escarpment, and deposited their dead with their clothing, textiles and other perishable artefacts in burial caves still visible high up the almost vertical cliffs. After each burial the mouths of the caves were re-sealed, thus protecting the contents from the humid\n\n26\n\nFrom Antiquity to the Middle Ages\n\nclimate. The Dutch team excavated many caves and found around 500 garments and textile fragments dating from the eleventh to sixteenth century ad (when the Tellem appear to have died out), making them the earliest known textiles from sub-Saharan Africa. Most are of cotton, some of wool. The majority of the cotton textiles are coloured in different shades of indigo. The woollen textiles have green, yellow, blue and red decora¬ tions, the green being an indigo/yellow combination.70 This discovery proved that by the eleventh century weaving and indigo dyeing, including tie-and-dye resist, had reached a very high standard in West Africa. Weaving techniques and designs show a marked similarity with those still in use there today, some designated for burials, including many blue-and-white striped patterns, usually weft faced.\n\nEurope and the Orient Much of indigo’s story during medieval times revolves around two pivots. One is Europe’s wool and cloth industry with its appetite for woad, the other is the increasing importance of tropical indigo in the East. Both have two main aspects: the production of the dyestuff and its application in the textile industry. For both the scale of trade is awesome. Until the later sixteenth century imported indigo pigment remained an expensive luxury in northern Europe, largely reserved for paints and inks. All the obstacles and expenses attendant on the long, hazardous journeys by caravan or sea made it an exotic commodity like pepper, other dyestuffs and mordants, medicines and perfumes, which all formed part of the overall spice trade. Across much of Asia, where textile manufacture was the main industry, indigo was a mainstay. As the Islamic empire expanded from the seventh century ad,\n\nso,\n\ntoo, did centres of commerce and manufacture, and\n\nfrom the early fifteenth century Ottoman control afforded protection to traders in their empire. Large quantities of textiles and dye materials changed hands in the great markets and ports of the Near and Middle East such as Baghdad, Kabul, Aden, Mosul, Damascus, Aleppo, Beirut, Alexandretta, Fu s tat/C air o, Alexandria, Bursa, Antalya and Constantinople. Political unrest affected variously the popularity of the Silk Roads and the more southerly routes. Merchants from many different backgrounds were involved, not least Jews and Muslims (the latter also being redoubtable Unusual indigo-dyed cotton coif\n\nsailors plying the Indian Ocean). They traded in indigo and dyed textiles\n\n(23 x 19cm), eleventh-twelfth\n\nfrom India, the Far East, Afghanistan, Persia, Syria, Palestine, Tunisia and\n\ncentury ad, the earliest known West\n\nMorocco, while Venetian and Genoese merchants almost monopolized\n\nAfrican textile decorated with the tie-and-dye resisttechnique.

Such goods, being of light weight but high\n\nMali in the 1960s, where men wear similar coifs today.\n\nvalue, were tailor-made for carriage on camel caravans, which could be\n\nIndigo\n\nmade up of thousands of camels. Letters from traders in the Levant describe the eager anticipation when a caravan was due to arrive in a city such as Aleppo. We also learn of the trading impasse caused when camels ‘are very skant to be gotten’ due to the extreme heat, as an English merchant resident in ‘Babylon’ in 1583 complains in a letter to London.71 After such long and difficult journeys, the excitement when oriental wares finally reached the European markets must have been almost tangible. Prices for indigo dyestuff fluctuated greatly, but were often double those of other luxury goods. Despite the high price, the most sought-after of all types on sale was what European medieval documents refer to as ‘Baghdad’ indigo.72 Baghdad was the biggest marketing centre for products made else¬ where in the area, including north-western India and Persian Kirman, whose renowned indigo gave rise to a Persian term rang-i kirmani, ‘colour of Kirman’, for indigo. As early as the mid-thirteenth century dyers of Islamic Spain, thanks to Arab influence, were already aufait with the eastern indigo — or ‘Indian woad’ —vat, which was more concentrated and alkaline than that of woad, and was used for dyeing linens or ‘fustians’ of mixed cotton and linen.73 A statute of 1322 shows that woad and indigo vats co-existed in Valencia, but provided that the two dyes should never be combined. As for Italy, no sooner had Italian dyers begun dye experiments with tropical indigo than a Florentine wool corporation’s statute of 1317 forbade the practice.74 However, by the early fifteenth century here, too, the indigo vat for dyeing linens was permitted alongside the woad vat for wools.\n\nExpansion of indigo cultivation In the medieval Islamic period indigo began to be cultivated on an expanding scale as landowners profited from new ideas and technologies, many probably emanating from India, and from the urban markets. India continued to be a main producer. Marco Polo (possibly at second hand) and others record the main centres as Koulam in the far south and the north-western state of Gujarat,75 with its port of Cambay being the largest entrepot for indigo. From the ninth century many Arab geographers refer to the abundance of indigo under cultivation in the Arab world too.76 Its westward progression seems to have spread from India via Kabul and southern Persia (Kerman and Hormuz were famous for indigo)77 to the Jordan valley (where it was a major crop until the early nineteenth century), to the oases of Upper Egypt, and across north Africa to the Draa valley in southern Morocco. Berber caravans carried indigo to lands south of the Sahara.78 Meanwhile, Yemen was always a famous centre, and the Muslims had also introduced indigo cultivation to Cyprus and Sicily, where the dyers were, as was usually the case elsewhere, Jewish.\n\n28\n\nCotton plainweave ikat fragment dyed in indigo and the yellowish dye known locally as wars (Flemingia grahamiana\n\nFrom Antiquity to the Middle Ages\n\nWight and Arn.), with inked Kufic inscription and applied gold leaf. Yemen, tenth century.\n\nIslamic luxury textiles Under the Islamic caliphates the habit of bestowing textiles as tribute or reward, most notably elaborate costumes featuring inscriptions and known as tiraz, stimulated a vast expansion in a textile system inaugurated in Sassanian and Byzantine imperial workshops. Thousands of tiraz fragments survive, including unusual Yemen ikat pieces dyed with indigo and wars, a popular yellowish dye.79 Textiles had both enormous signifi¬ cance and value in Islamic life. They were subject to endless nuances of value and meaning, some codified in complex sartorial laws. Trade in Islamic luxury textiles was far-flung, reaching China and western Europe, where many common textile terms derive from Arabic or Persian.80 European churches filled their treasuries with oriental textiles, including the fine silks for which Byzantium was distinguished until its fall to the Turks in 1453.81 The European nobility, too, were eager customers for sumptuous foreign silks and brocades. Considering the constant need for dyes to colour all clothing and furnishings, it is not surprising that quality dyestuffs were expensive and that some rulers actively supported their dye-houses. The main dyes apart from indigo were: madder, kermes, brazilwood and, later, lac for reds; saffron, curcuma (turmeric) and safflower (producing also orange and red) for yellows; and gall nuts and sumac as mordants for tannin black.82 Combinations of these dyes created an infinite variety of colours, indigo featuring especially in greens, blacks and purples. The use of genuine shellfish purple was strictly controlled under Byzantine law. As the tiraz system waned, Europe’s own textile industry was on the ascendant from the thirteenth century, with an increasing appetite of its own for raw materials, dyestuffs and mordants.\n\nUtilitarian textiles including Indian block-printed trade cloth It is impossible to tell when dyed clothing became the customary wear of common people, but medieval archaeological textiles provide a clue. Innumerable textile fragments have been excavated, often from rubbish dumps, at Fustat (old Cairo), the Bed Sea port of Quseir al-Qadim and other Islamic sites (often on earlier Christian and Roman foundations) in Egypt.83 An extensive range of textile types and techniques was used, but clearly many fabrics were utilitarian or barter goods, and indigo was commonly used to dye them. Not only are there thousands of fragments of local manufacture, mostly of linen - Egypt’s basic fibre at that time dated before 1100, but there are also many of textiles imported from far away. Of particular interest are a large group of‘Fustat fragments’ sold by nineteenth-century dealers in Cairo, which are clearly of Indian origin and should more correctly be called ‘Indian block-printed trade cloth’.84\n\n29\n\nModern block-printed cotton cloth (detail) dyed in synthetic indigo and alizarin red, resembling medieval Indian trade cloths.

Their provenance is almost certainly north-western India. The fragments are of cotton, mainly resist-printed and dyed in indigo, or mordant-printed and dyed red, or a combination of the two. Many of their designs bear a striking resemblance to those still found on hand-blocked textiles of north-west India.\n\nWoad in Europe While indigo was on centre stage in the textile industries of the Orient, woad was still firmly in Europe’s spotlight. Although for many the word ‘woad’ con¬ veys hackneyed images of blue-faced Ancient Britons, as a commodity it was of such economic importance throughout the European Middle Ages that it has easily merited a book of its own, Jamieson Hurry’s 1930s’ classic The Woad Plant and its Dye.86 Its main predecessor, with its well-known plates (see pp.56 and 93), is the German monograph of 1752 by Daniel Schreber.87 Woad, as already mentioned, was Europe’s truly universal dye, used for all blues but also as a ‘top’ or ‘bottom’ dye for most other colours.88 As one Elizabethan put it: ‘No colour in broadcloth or kersey will well be made to endure without woad,’89 and a textile historian has noted that ‘in medieval draperies, woad-indigo served as the essential foundation . . . for creating a wide range of other colours’ (including so-called ‘scarlets’).90 The secrets of the medieval dyer, recorded in many documents and guild regulations, are increasingly being confirmed and extended by chemical analysis. Such was his skill that he was able to reproduce small nuances of hue. Beautiful greens, known in Britain as Saxon, Lincoln and Kendal greens, were made by combining woad with yellow from weld or from dyer’s broom (Genista tinctoria L.) — hence the plants’ common names, ‘dyer’s greenweed’, ‘dyers’ woad’ and ‘woadwaxen’. A further yellow widely used on the continent came from saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria L.). Purples, pinks, violets, mulberries and scarlets came from woad combined with madder or kermes reds, or even lichen purple.91 It was needed, too, to make russet, tawny and Medieval Indian block-printed resist-\n\ngrey colours, as well as the best blacks. The highly coveted black known in\n\ndyed cotton trade textile (fragment)\n\nthe Mediterranean textile centres as hruneta (brownish) black was made from\n\nwith unusual animal designs in light and dark indigo blue. Radiocarbon\n\nwoad and madder. To ensure the blue shade was dark enough before proceed¬\n\ndated to ad 895 +/- 75 years.\n\ning to the madder stage, the quality was strictly regulated by guild statutes. Generally forbidden, especially for dyeing fine wool, were inferior negre blacks made from corrosive plant tannin/iron mordant mixtures.92 Finally, woad alone could, under certain dyeing conditions, yield greens or even, with the addition of alum, pinks.93\n\n3°\n\n•\n\nJx\n\n*§ ifi\n\nIndigo\n\nMap showing the trade routes of woad and chief districts of production in medieval Europe.\n\nfopposite above] Woad merchants with a bulging sack of woad balls.

Govern¬ ments also gained greatly by imposing heavy taxes at every stage. A poem by Chaucer, harking back to a pastoral age unspoilt by greed and industrialism, laments the harmful dyeing industry with its three staples, madder, weld and woad: No mader, welde, orwoode [woad] no litestere [dyer] Ne knew; the flees was of his former hewe.94 Regions most renowned for woad produc¬ tion were in France, Germany, Italy and, later, in England.95 Spain’s central regions grew woad,96 but a good deal more had to be imported. Much woad trade was handled by Spanish merchants, particularly from Burgos,97 and imported tropical indigo was also available in the Muslim south. France was Europe’s greatest producer of woad, called there pastel or guede (or, further north, vouede).98 In addition to local consumption, exports, particularly to Britain and Flanders, were huge, although political events like the Hundred Years’ War caused fluctuations. The main woad districts were Normandy, Picardy and Languedoc.99 Although yields were lower in the north, cultivation and trade was still extensive, notably around Caen, Bayeux and Amiens. Late thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century city records and customs accounts show that Amiens merchants traded enthusiastically in Picardy woad. The industry was tightly regulated. A typical by-law of even the small town of Corbie, near Amiens, admonishes:\n\nWoad balls in a basket from the margin\n\nNo merchant shall huy or sell woad at the market ofCorhie or in the\n\nof the land book of the Archbishop of\n\noutskirts of the town until the sacrament hell has rung, nor on other days\n\nCambrai, which lists agricultural\n\nuntil the collector of tolls or his agent shall have struck the beam and\n\ncommodities and tax dues, dated August 1275.\n\nthus given the signal.100\n\n33\n\nPage of woad samples from Erfurt, Thuringia, Germany, 1585. Prospective purchasers gathered in the market to test woad qualities by passing damp fingers over woad balls and smearing them onto sheets of paper.\n\nIt was in the Languedoc region of southern France, renowned for its woollen cloth industry, that woad reigned supreme. One writer on Languedoc commented that ‘woad . . . hath made that country the happiest and richest in Europe’.101 Its appellation as the pays de cocagne — land of the woad ball — even came to mean exceptionally profitable land anywhere. The prosperous woad merchants, particularly of Albi and Toulouse, were often landowners too, overseeing every aspect of woad production and trade.102 They displayed their affluence in opulent houses, many of which still stand today in the old centre of Toulouse. One merchant, the immigrant Castillian Jean de Bernuy, was so credit-worthy that he could even stand as the main guarantor of the sum required for the ransom for King Francis I after his capture by Charles V of Spain. France’s southern cloth industry consumed much Languedoc woad, but large quantities of it were transported overland to major ports like Bayonne and Narbonne. The rest travelled by barge along the Garonne from Toulouse to Bordeaux, which profited greatly from its export, often on Italian vessels, to Flanders, the Low Countries, Italy and above all to Spain and Britain, both in turn major exporters of wool and cloth to Europe.103 Major goods exported alongside the annual 200,000 bales of woad were madder dye, alum mordant and, of course, wine. Such was the importance of woad that even in times of war unarmed ships were permitted to enter port to load it. In Germany the economic prosperity of the districts of Jiilich and Thuringia was also founded largely on the woad industry.104 In its heyday woad provided a third of the income of Thuringia (the other noted prod¬ ucts being wine, hops and wheat). Most visible relics of the local industry of at least 300 villages are the quantities of woad mill stones still scattered around the countryside.105 The wealth woad generated is largely respon¬ sible for the beautiful medieval city of Erfurt, including its university, at the heart of Thuringia’s five Waidstadte, or woad towns — the others being Gotha, Langensalza, Ternstedt and Arnstadt. Prosperous woad merchants proudly called themselves Waidherrn, ‘gentlemen of woad’.106 In Erfurt today you can pass their grand houses whose wide entrances were constructed to accommodate large wagons, and stroll down the Waadgasse, where woad was weighed and ‘assayed’, i.e. officially tested. In churches in the city a carved keystone, a stained glass window (see p.io), and a tomb¬ stone all commemorate the woad industry.\n\n34\n\nFrom Antiquity to the Middle Ages\n\nLand register (detail) of 1640 showing a woad mill in the centre near a village church. Erfurt district, Germany.\n\nThe German woad industry was strictly regulated at every stage and heavily taxed. As early as 1250 duties known as ‘woad pennies' were being levied at Erfurt, and companies were formed to provide the capital necessary to trade in woad. Particularly complex ordinances directed the farmers, ‘refiners’ and merchants who handled ‘green’ (unfermented) and ‘couched’ (fermented) woad.107 Under the protection and organization of the Hanseatic League, formed in the thirteenth century, German merchants, as well as French, exported their woad to many parts of Europe, including Antwerp, England, Hungary, Poland and Italy. Italy’s flourishing textile industry, especially in Florence, had such an insatiable demand for woad, called there guado, that home production had to be supplemented from France and Germany, hence her early adoption of oriental indigo imported by Venetian merchants. However, several regions profited greatly from woad cultivation, notably Tuscany,\n\n35\n\nIndigo\n\nLombardy and Piedmont, and many large millstones have been preserved.108 As the Florentine cloth industry was renowned for its high standards, much attention was paid to quality control at all stages, not least for woad, the major dyestuff. It had to be stored in a great central woad hall where it could be thoroughly inspected and costed before sale.109 Italian merchants, centred on Venice, dominated much of the European maritime trade in woad, just as they did the oriental spice trade, which included indigo pigment, in the eastern Mediterranean. The principal route from Venice went via Genoa, Narbonne and Bordeaux to Britain, the Low Countries, and north-west Europe. In the fourteenth century much woad, and ash for the vats, was exchanged by Genoese merchants in England’s south coast port of Southampton for wool and woollen cloth, for at this period Britain’s own woad production was not all that significant. In southern England woad was being cultivated from Anglo-Saxon times, as many names with the word ‘wad’in them testify;110 but Britain nevertheless relied greatly on imported dyestuff until the later sixteenth century, especially as her textile industry developed. Before the fourteenth century vast quantities of English wool and undyed cloth were sent across the channel to be dyed, woven and finished on the continent by artisans, notably Flemish, with superior skills. From 1330 Edward III encouraged Flemish dyers, fullers and weavers to bring their expertise to England; the English cloth industry improved and expanded greatly and with it the need for dyes and mordants.111 As elsewhere, shipping manifests, port records, city ordinances and other documents paint a vivid picture of woad’s importance in the textile industry.112 It was so valuable, second only to wine, that it was often bequeathed as property in wills.113 Between the thirteenth and the sixteenth centuries in particular it was in constant demand, along with allied dyeing materials and linen. Its trade brought great wealth and status to the merchants who monopolized it.114 A city like Winchester, a staple town strategically placed between the wool-producing regions of southern England and the key ports of London and Southampton, was a major trading and industrial centre. In a fascinating account of its dyeing industry in Survey of Medieval Winchester the author states: Of all the cloth-manufacturing trades that of the dyer. . . was probably the one which required the greatest capital investment and the highest degree of entrepreneurial expertise. Before the later fourteenth century the Winchester dyers appear to have been the wealthiest of the cloth¬ working craftsmen.115\n\n36\n\nFrom Antiquity to the Middle Ages\n\nLike the wool merchants, dyers held prominent civic positions.

The rivalry between the routes they used and the Cape route inevitably intensified.41 The safety of either route was always unpredictable: at sea piracy and shipwreck, and on land raids on caravans, were a constant\n\nt (f\n\nthreat and caused wild fluctuations in the selling prices of Asian goods. As the seventeenth century advanced, the Cape route became better established to the point where goods brought to Europe that way were cheaper than goods brought on the\n\n.\\ '*s\n\nLevantine route. This would have curious consequences for European trade in the Levant in certain special commodities, in particular indigo. From their foundation the Levant companies were much concerned with indigo. Correspondence between ‘factors’ (agents) of these companies in Aleppo and their headquarters in Europe in the final decades of the sixteenth century frequently empha¬ sized the importance of indigo, and its exceptionally high value pound for pound compared with nearly all other ‘spices’. It was usually sold by the ‘churle’ (Italian zurli, i.e. cowhide bundle), packed two\n\nQazwin manuscript, Persia,\n\nto a chest. Although dyestuffs, as already noted, were generally lumped\n\nsixteenth century, illustrating (top right) the indigo plant.\n\ntogether under the generic term ‘spices’, indigo and sometimes lac (or its Spanish American replacement, cochineal) were often itemized separately in agents’reports and bills of lading.42 A Venetian consul, for example, in an overview of Syria’s trade, records that ‘many nations from many divers parts bring hither a vast array of very rich commodities, spices, silk, indigo, cotton, cloth made of wool, silk and gold, and infinite other things’.43 From the end of the sixteenth century the raising of heavier duties by the Ottomans on the dye trade gave further impetus to the European shipping companies to engage in the long sea route to the East. In 1599 alarming news reached Aleppo that six Dutch ships had arrived in Holland from the East Indies laden with oriental goods. To Levant companies this sounded ‘catastrophic’.44 However, once they learnt that the Dutch were concentrating on pepper and cloves they breathed a deep sigh of relief, merchants’ correspondence declaring that as long as the Dutch did not carry much indigo, nutmeg or silk the Levant trade would be little harmed. One letter tells of the cargo of the Hector, as she prepares to sail from the Levant to London at the end of that year:\n\n\\\n\n..A \\\n\n,/\n\nResist-printed linen indienne,\n\nIndigo\n\ndyed in indigo.

By 1630 the Cape routes had reduced transport costs to such an extent that Indian indigo could now be brought to Europe by East India companies, re-exported from there to Levantine markets by the Levant companies, and sold or bartered at a lower price than indigo brought over¬ land.46 In England’s case, this saved an undesirable drain on the country’s bullion. (The EIC’s original aim of obtaining oriental spices by bartering surplus English woollen broadcloth had proved unsuccessful, but at least the ability to re-export such suitable goods as Indian indigo reduced the irWr\n\n*iif ! .a,\n\ndrain on England’s currency.)47 In the following century the English Levant company was officially prohibited for fifty years from exporting any bullion from England, which put it at a disadvantage vis-a-vis its French and Dutch rivals, who had more flexibility. The English government did at least designate certain colonial products, including indigo, ‘money goods’, which could be exchanged for local currency if necessary.48 The French, with their large supplies of West Indian indigo and sugar, were particularly enthusiastic about the re-export trade. From the mid1680s West Indian indigo was the most ‘interesting’ of all commodities arriving at the ports of Bordeaux and Marseilles.49 A hundred years later a French traveller reported that France had the greatest trade to Syria of any European nation. Re-exported indigo was still one of her top commodities traded there, although by then overtaken by cochineal.50 It must not be forgotten, with so much talk of trade criss-crossing the Mediterranean and the Middle East, that untold quantities of dyestuffs were being used locally throughout the Ottoman Empire and beyond, to produce everyday and luxury textiles, including tribal rugs and the finest court carpets. Of the general consumption of dyes in Anatolia, for example, one historian of Ottoman archives notes that: ‘Among the dyes employed by sixteenth century Anatolian dyers, indigo was most frequently referred to in contemporary documents. It was an expensive raw material.’51 Natural indigo, and its synthetic successor, continued to be a major import into Ottoman ports into the twentieth century.\n\nIndigo\n\nEurope's quest to understand the new dyestuffs In the second half of the sixteenth century, while Cape trade was in its infancy, there was a general impetus in Europe not only, as we saw in the last chapter, to seek fresh sources of woad but also to improve dyeing skills at home by finding out more about the intriguing new dyestuffs appearing on the markets. Nations competed both for access to, and understanding of, indigo and logwood, which were increasingly being sought as alterna¬ tives to woad. There was a dawning realization that indigo was better than woad, but there was a long period of experimentation with dye plants and methods, and of considerable confusion about them.52 Attempts were made by the Spanish in the 1550s and the English in the 1580s — both keen to bypass the French product — to acclimatize woad to the New World of the Americas. Yet in the same period chroniclers and traders from both nations were expressing interest in a native indigo plant being used by the American Indians,53 and even engaging in some trade in ‘annele (which is a kind of thing to dye blew withall)’,54 but were uncertain exactly how the dye was used. However, it was not long before indigo’s potential was realized. In 1558 the Spanish king expressed keen interest in the prospects for indigo, and soon afterwards the Spanish were intro¬ ducing new species of indigofera into their American colonies and rapidly developed highly productive manufacturing methods. England’s quest for new ideas are exemplified in Hakluyt’s Principall Navigations. He stressed that English cloth would not find ready markets abroad nor would problems of unemployment be solved, unless home dyers sharpened up their skills: For that England hath the hest wool, and cloth of the world, and for that the cloths of the Realme have no good vent if good dying he not added: therefore it is much to he wished, that the dying offorren Countreies were seene, to the end that the arte of dying may he brought into the Realme in greatest excellencie;for thereof willfollowe honour to the Realme, and greate and ample vent of our clothes; and of the vente of clothes, will followe the setting of our poore in worke, in all degrees of labour in clothing and dying.55 To this end in 1579 Hakluyt dispatches Morgan Hubblethorne, a master dyer, to Persia on a mission to find out how the Persian dyers achieve such excellent results. He also instructs him to keep his eyes open en route: You must have great care to have knowledge of the materials of all the Countreies that you shall passe through, that maybe used in dying, be they hearbes, weedes, barkes, gummes, earths, or what els soever.’ The instructions continue:\n\n54\n\nIndigo's Heyday, the Downfall of Woad and Salvation by Denim\n\nIn Persia you shall finde carpets of coarse thrommed wooll, the hest of the worlde, and excellently coloured: those cities and townes you must repaire to, and you must use meanes to learne all the order of the dying of those thrommes, which are so died, as neither raine, wine, nor yet vineger, can staine: and if you may attaine to that cunning, you shall not neede tofeare dying of cloth, for if the colour holde in yarne, and thromme, it will holde much better in clothe ... For that in Persia they have great colouring of silkes, it behoves you to learne that also.\n\nHubblethorne is also encouraged to seek out Chinese dyers in Persia and in particular to investigate indigo plants and production methods: You shalle finde Anyle there, if you can procure the herbe, that it is made of either by seede, or by plant, to carry into England, you may doe well to endevour to enrich your countrey with the same; but withall learne you the making of the Anyle, and if you can get the hearbe, you may sende the same drye into England, for possibly it groweth here already.\n\nThe belief that such indigo might grow in England demonstrates the haziness of knowledge about foreign dyestuffs at that time, as does a further instruction to look for logwood in Persia: ‘Learne you there to fixe, and make sure the colour to be given by loggewood: so shalle we not neede to buy oade [woad] so deere, to the enriching of our enemies.’ Hakluyt’s hopes of finding logwood in Persia and using it as well as indigo to replace woad were false on two counts. Firstly, logwood only grew in America, as the Spanish had recently discovered. Secondly, the blues it produced were not colourfast (although mordanting methods did later improve). It did, however, make a black so valuable in commerce that it was the cause of many conflicts between the Spanish and the English in Central America, and even resulted in the creation of British Honduras (Belize) — but that is another dyestuff story!56\n\nThe woad war The producers of woad would hardly have supported Hakluyt’s efforts on behalf of indigo. While European merchants were battling on several fronts to corner the market in exotic commodities, including the tropical dyestuffs, all those with vested interests in woad fought back on its behalf. The indigo versus woad battle was fierce and prolonged, in some places lasting well into the eighteenth century. Landowners and local merchants, especially on the European continent, were in confrontation with all the\n\n55\n\nIndigo\n\ncompanies eagerly expanding their trading interests in Asia and, later, the West Indies. The woad producers’ horror at the prospect of losing their livelihoods foreshadowed that of the expatriate indigo planters in India at the very end of the nineteenth century, equally alarmed by the new threat of synthetic indigo. The rearguard tactics of both were doomed. Protectionist edicts were issued from the end of the sixteenth century throughout Europe in support of home-grown woad, and a deliberate smear campaign gave imported indigo a bad press. Dyers, moreover, were ignorant about exactly how to use the new dye, which needed different handling from woad, including the use of corrosive vitriol or arsenic. It was also confused with logwood, whose ‘false indigo’ blue was unstable. In France the landowning plutocracy of Languedoc had grown fat on woad profits and had little difficulty in persuading the government, which gained much tax revenue from woad, to ban the import of indigo in 1598. Eleven years later the king issued a draconian edict which actually sentenced to death anyone found using ‘the deceitful and injurious dye called inde\\57 Later in the century the virtues of indigo were inevitably recognized, notably by the French minister Colbert in 1669, but French dyers were not all officially free to use imported indigo as they wished until 1737. Other European countries followed suit. In Germany, despite the\n\nIllustration of a German woad\n\ndamage inflicted on its agricultural economy by the Thirty Years’War in ,1\n\nr\n\n, 1\n\nir\n\nr.i\n\n.\n\n,,\n\ni.\n\ni\n\n,\n\nthe hrst halt of the seventeenth century, the woad industry remained an important source of wealth. From 1577, and for over one hundred years thereafter, various imperial and local prohibitions were announced banning indigo, ‘the devil’s dye’, on the grounds that it was ‘pernicious, dec"
