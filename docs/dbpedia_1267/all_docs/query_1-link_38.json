        "text": "Azamara Journey\n\nA luxurious boutique hotel at sea, the Azamara Journey® is a mid-sized ship with a deck plan that’s intimate but never crowded, and offers everything modern voyagers are looking for—plus some unexpected extras.\n\nRe-imagined staterooms include modern amenities, furnishings, and European linens. Plus the ship features a large number of staterooms and suites with balconies, perfect for starting your day with fresh sea air and stunning views.\n\nAcross the fleet, our authentic service goes beyond the expectations of even the most well-traveled cruisers. Friendly and approachable, our staff are attentive, and happy to offer everything from poolside service to recommendations for your on-shore exploration. After all, we love sailing the world just as much as you do!\n\nAdd to all of that world-class dining options, spa experiences to relax and refresh, and all-new entertainment offerings, you’ve got an onboard experience that’s matched only by the immersive cultural encounters we’ve got in store on shore.\n\nYou’ll be hard-pressed to find such a collection of limited production, small label and rare vintage wines anywhere on the high seas! And with vintages from France to California, and Argentina to South Africa, you’re sure to find a wine to suit your palate and your journey. Our knowledgeable sommeliers can help you pick the perfect wines for your evening meal.\n\nComfortable and stylish, Mosaic is the place where you’ll find your favorite coffee drinks, just the way you like. Try our Nespresso specialty coffee (for a fee). Slip into a comfortable seat and sip for a while. The perfect place to start (or end) your day, no matter where you are in the world. This just might become your favorite area on the ship.\n\nOur onboard coffee corner may very well become your favorite nook on the ship. And with elegant and comfortable furniture, it's bound to be one of the the most stylish places, too. You'll find all your favorite coffee drinks and you can order them just the way you like. We recommend that you slip right into a comfortable seat and sip for a while—you never know who'll walk by.\n\nThe idea of the Living Room is just that. It’s the perfect space for guests throughout the day and evening to engage in lively conversations, take in interesting speakers, peruse art, play a game of cards, enjoy a cup of tea or coffee, wines & tapas, delightful music, or simply relax with a good book.\n\nCard Room & In Touch\n\nOn the starboard side of the Living Room, guests will find the Card Room for those who love a round of Bridge or other games. Four computers and interactive table tops are available for guest use during the voyage.​\n\nThis library is one of the quiet jewels of Azamara, a peaceful and beautifully appointed space for reading or relaxing after dinner. Browse the collection and feel free to borrow the library books. Or simply relax in the tranquil atmosphere. But the library goes beyond just paper, they have interactive digital tabletops so you can make your own postcards and post to social media to share your adventures with the folks back home. The library is also home to their impressive Inspiration Center—a digital way to explore the world with Azamara and gain inspiration for your next voyage.\n\nThe Drawing Room turns into a gorgeous dining room on the evening of the elegant Best of the Best dinner for Owner’s Suite guests.\n\nTen AzAmazing Years!\n\nTen years ago, we launched AzAmazing Celebrations as an experiential way for our guests to dive deeper into cultures and traditions around the world. This year, we expanded our portfolio beyond evening events and began offering new, day celebrations onboard and onshore.\n\nUnforgettable Performances\n\nTo honor our 10th anniversary, we added over 35 new celebrations in the most spectacular ports. Be captivated by the rich history of the Amazon in an enriching performance in Manaus or travel back to the Renaissance era in Livorno for an exclusive showing of La Traviata. No matter the voyage, these unparalleled experiences will be the highlight of your trip.\n\nThis One's On Us\n\nBest of all, AzAmazing Celebrations are included, with our compliments, on all cruises except transatlantic crossings and voyages that are less than seven nights long. Reserve your seat by accessing the Shore Excursions section of your reservation at no additional cost.\n\nOur playbill features a variety of amazing performances to keep you entertained while onboard. Sit back and enjoy your evenings on a high note with our onboard entertainment.\n\nClub Crooner\n\nStep into a swanky nightclub as the great songs of the most magnificent artists come alive on stage. From classic crooners such as Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, to current songbirds such as Natalie Cole and Michael Bublé, there’s a song for every time and everyone. Enjoy a beverage, sit back, and be serenaded by the melodies of our lives with CLUB CROONER!\n\nWanderlust\n\nGet ready to be transported to the world’s most beloved travel destinations in one exhilarating night. As we explore all four seasons in a new city, travel along with our dynamic Signature Singers & Dancers as they sing and dance their way through an eclectic mix of music from around the world. Come and experience WANDERLUST\n\nAnd the Beat Goes On\n\nJoin your Signature Singers and Dancers as they commemorate the greatest hits of all time in And the Beat Goes On. The night celebrates a wide variety of musical genres while exploring the influence of mainstream media in honoring the iconic cultural trends throughout the years. Featuring music from The Beatles, Earth Wind and Fire, Journey, Madonna, Ricky Martin, Katy Perry and much more. We will be sure to have you singing and dancing all night long in AND THE BEAT GOES ON!\n\nSix Strings\n\nThe guitars are tuned, the amps are cranked up and the microphones are hot as Azamara prepares you for a night of energetic dancing, powerful vocals and iconic guitar riffs in Six Strings. The evening guarantees a Good Time with ultimate nostalgia as our Signature Singers and Dancers celebrate the most renowned classic rock artists such as Aerosmith, The Beatles, Pat Benatar, The Rolling Stones, Queen and more.
