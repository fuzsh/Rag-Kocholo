        "text": "The documentary premieres April 9 on Max\n\nThe trailer for the new Max documentary Brandy Hellville & the Cult of Fast Fashion has been released and fashion experts, insiders and former employees aren't sugar-coating their stories about teen fashion brand Brandy Melville.\n\nBrandy Melville's social media campaigns featured images of teenage girls wearing the clothing — taken by other teenage girls. However, experts in the film said that the campaign was deceiving.\n\n\"Behind the curtain, no one has any idea that this man with sneakers and sweatpants on was running the Instagram that all these teenage girls are like, fanning over,\" said one participant in the film's trailer.\n\nDespite the brand's claim of being inclusive of all sizes and types of girls, participants say that the typical \"Brandy girl\" hired to model and work on the floor of the brick-and-mortar stores was a \"skinny white girl,\" per the trailer.\n\nCompany executives allegedly relegated people of color working overseas in their factories to stockroom jobs.\n\nBut the bad alleged behavior of the leaders at Brandy Melville went beyond discrimination, experts in the documentary said.\n\nBrandy Hellvile will also expose text messages sent by company executives and practices they supported that were allegedly sexually exploitative.\n\nPlus the film's producers, award-winning siblings and documentarians Simon and Johnathan Chinn, examine the negative impact of \"fast fashion\" on the environment and self-esteem of young women.\n\n\"Fast fashion brands convince you to buy so much because they convince you that you are not enough,\" one person said in the trailer.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"Brandy Melville tapped into the worst impulses of being a teenage girl,\" someone else declared.\n\nThe controversial \"fast fashion\" model of business involves producing clothing incredibly quickly to capitalize on the trends of the moment and convincing customers they need to buy styles before they disappear.\n\nThe allegedly cheap, deceptive practice negatively impacts the environment of the places where factories are located. Brandy Melville's factories are located overseas and changing the everyday lives of citizens, subjects in the film said.\n\nFilmmakers traveled to Accra, Ghana, to expose the extremely negative impact \"fast fashion\" is having on the environment.\n\nBrandy Melville did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nBrandy Hellville & The Cult of Fast Fashion will be available to stream on Max April 9.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
