        "text": "All requirements stated below apply at the time of embarkation. Infants sailing on board a Norwegian Cruise Line vessel must be at least six months of age. However, for voyages that have three or more consecutive days at sea, the infant must be at least 12 months old.\n\nWhen on board, a minor is defined as an individual under 18 years of age at the time of embarkation. A young adult is defined as an individual between the ages of 18 and 20. Please note that this does not relate to child pricing, where the age is 2-17 years old.\n\nCompany policy states that on itineraries that include a port in the United States of America, Canada or China, guests under 21 years of age must be accompanied in the same, connecting, or side by side stateroom by a guest who is 21 years of age or older at the time of embarkation (staterooms opposite of each other are not applicable under this policy). For all other cruises, this regulation applies to all guests under 18 years of age with the exception of guests who are citizens of the United States of America, Canada or China. For guests under the age of 18 travelling with an accompanying adult, who is not the minor‚Äôs parent or legal guardian, a Parent/Guardian Release Form (available here: www.ncl.eu/ParentGuardianForm) that authorises the minor‚Äôs travel and further authorises medical treatment in case of an emergency must be given to a Norwegian Cruise Line representative at the pier during check-in. Failure to present the completed form at embarkation may result in boarding being denied, with no refund provided.\n\nOn cruises that include a Canadian port, guests under 18 travelling with a single parent have to provide a letter of approval (preferably notarised) from the parent not travelling. Note that two people under the age of 21 may travel together in the same stateroom if they are a married couple and provide proof of marriage to a Norwegian Cruise Line representative at the pier before embarkation.\n\nChildren under 16 years of age are not allowed to enter the fitness centre. The minimum age for use of the Casino and the Thermal Spa (sauna, steam room, hot tubs) is 18. Some bars and lounges on board Norwegian Epic and Breakaway (Plus)-Class ships, for example Spice H2O, are adult only (18 and over). Lifeguards monitor the family pools during scheduled pool hours. However it is strongly recommended that all children under 12 have adult supervision at all times. The safety of all children (up to the age of 18) is the responsibility of their parent(s) or other accompanying adult(s) irrespective of whether a lifeguard is on duty.\n\nFor safety reasons, children must not be left unattended on board when their parents or other accompanying adults go ashore.\n\nNorwegian welcomes guests with special needs. The information you are provided with about your holiday (which may be on their website, in their brochures or elsewhere) before you make your booking will include a general indication of the suitability of the holiday for someone with reduced mobility. However, reduced mobility of course means different things to different individuals as they fully appreciate that individual capabilities, restrictions and requirements will vary considerably. If you suffer from reduced mobility or any medical condition or disability which may affect your holiday, please give them full details before booking so that they can provide you with precise information as to the suitability of the holiday taking into account your specific needs. Guests who have significant mobility impairments should travel with someone who will take responsibility for any assistance needed during the cruise and in the event of an emergency. Any assistance provided by Norwegian Cruise Line, its team members or service providers does not form part of the contracted services unless agreed differently in writing or where required by legal regulations (for example, in accordance with EU regulation 1107/2006 dated 5 July 2006 on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air and EU regulation 1177/2010 dated 24 November 2010 concerning the rights of passengers when travelling by sea). Any special requirements which they have accepted will be specifically confirmed as accepted on your confirmation invoice. Unless and until specifically confirmed as accepted, all special requests and requirements are subject to availability and do not form part of the contracted services.\n\nThey have a limited number of staterooms per ship that are wheelchair accessible with grab rails in the bathrooms, lower sinks and toilets, shower seats, raised beds, adjustable hanging rods in wardrobes, tilting mirrors and extra wide doors for easy access.\n\nIf you do use a wheelchair, you must bring your own and it must be collapsible. If you do not wish to bring your own wheelchair on board, please contact their U.S.-based supplier Scooteround on 001 (888) 441 7575 to arrange delivery of one to the ship. All wheelchairs and scooters must be stored in your stateroom; they cannot be left in the hallway or any other public area. To ensure the safety of our guests and crew, wheelchairs may not be used to transfer from the ship to a tender. Guests in wheelchairs may consequently not be able to participate in certain activities or shore excursions in tender ports. Norwegian Cruise Line can only accept certain types of wheelchairs on board. Please see www.ncl.eu/about/accessible-cruising for further information. All guests who require medical equipment to be brought on board must advise Norwegian Cruise Line before sailing. Failure to do so may result in equipment not being cleared before departure.\n\nFor hearing-/ vision-impaired guests, they have a limited number of staterooms with vibrating alarm clocks and a flashing light system alerting guests to fire alarms. For the vision-impaired, we allow registered guide dogs on all Norwegian Cruise Line ships (airline and international quarantine restrictions may apply and should be checked before booking your cruise).\n\nGuests who need oxygen or require oxygen therapy are welcome on all Norwegian Cruise Line ships; however, you must supply your own oxygen. U.S.-based Special Needs at Sea is the only company allowed to deliver and supply oxygen to Norwegian Cruise Line ships. Let them know at the time of booking that you'll be bringing oxygen on board, then contact Special Needs at Sea at 001 954 585 0575 to arrange delivery to the ship.\n\nAny physical challenge or medical condition that requires special treatment or attention must be reported to Norwegian Cruise Line at the time of booking. For certain conditions they ask for medical declaration and liability forms. Due to unpredictable circumstances at sea, Norwegian Cruise Line must reserve the right to refuse or revoke passage to anyone who, based upon objective standards, is in a physical or mental condition that jeopardises the safe operation of the vessel, who poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others or who may require care beyond that which Norwegian Cruise Line can provide.\n\nFor guests with diabetes, refrigerators suitable for storing insulin are available in all staterooms except Studios (category T1 and T8).\n\nIf you are on a low calorie diet, breakfast, lunch and dinner menus feature low calorie, haute cuisine dishes. Sugar-free and fat-free desserts are also available. Gluten-free, lactose-free, sodium-free, Kosher and dairy-free diets can also be catered for and must be requested at least two months before your cruise. For further information see www.ncl.eu.\n\nWhen it comes to what to wear, you can go resort casual or get decked-out and look your best - it's your call. Feel Free to wear what you like. Norwegian even have special \"Dress-Up or Not Night.\" It's the perfect opportunity to get your portrait taken with your family, that special someone or even with the ship's Captain.\n\nCruise Casual: the Freedom of Freestyle Cruising\n\nDress cruise casual anytime during the day, in the buffet and in most speciality restaurants. For women, it includes summer and casual dresses, skirts, regular or capri pants, shorts, jeans and tops. Khakis, jeans, shorts and casual shirts are fine for men. Swimwear is acceptable at the buffet and outdoor restaurant, but a shirt or a cover-up and footwear are required.\n\nBe sure to pack a sweater - the air conditioning can be chilly. Kids 12 and under are welcome to wear nice shorts in all our restaurants.\n\nPlease Note: Norwegian wants you to be comfortable, but tank tops for men, flip flops, baseball caps, visors and jeans that are overly faded, with holes or tears and worn below the hips are not permitted in main dining rooms or speciality restaurants.\n\nAll Decked-out: Smart Casual\n\nDress smart casual in our more formal dining room or in our more upscale speciality restaurants. For women, it includes slacks or jeans, dresses, skirts and tops. For men, it's jeans or slacks with a collared shirt and closed-toed shoes. Kids 12 and under are welcome to wear nice shorts in all our restaurants.\n\nReady for Adventure: Shore Excursions\n\nThink about the shore excursions you'll be taking and pack accordingly, including comfy walking shoes. For kids and adults it's good to pack a pair of closed-toed shoes. You can check within the specific shore excursion for more information.\n\nSpecial Events: Theme Nights and Parties\n\nOur newest event, Norwegian's Night Out, is the perfect opportunity to get dressed up for an evening of cocktails, fine dining and great entertainment. You may also want to pack an all-white ensemble for the iconic White Hot Party.\n\nClimate change is one of the defining issues of our time. How governments, organisations and individuals choose to respond to it will have lasting effects for not only our lifetime, but future generations. Knowing this, Norwegian Cruise Line believes it is their obligation as leaders in the cruise industry to do their part and help mitigate actions that may influence changes to the climate on a large scale. They are always focused on continuous improvement and are ready to explore new opportunities as their fleet grows.\n\nEmission Abatement\n\nOne innovative technology their ships use to decrease exhaust emissions is the Exhaust Gas Cleaning System (EGCS). This technology reduces the amount of sulphur oxide and particulate matter emitted from the ship by cleaning, or scrubbing, the emissions before being released from the stack. Ships equipped with this technology are able to reduce SOx emissions by up to 99 percent. As of December 2020, the following ships have been equipped with this technology: Norwegian Bliss, Norwegian Encore, Norwegian Epic, Norwegian Escape, Norwegian Gem, Norwegian Jade, Norwegian Jewel, Norwegian Joy, Norwegian Pearl, Norwegian Sun and Pride of America.\n\nWhilst in port, Norwegian cruise ships continue to generate their own power, providing heat, air conditioning, lighting and hot water for guests and crew, similar to a hotel.\n\nA small number of ports around the world have installed infrastructure for cruise ships to connect to the onshore electrical power grid to supply much of the power needed when the ship is docked. This is known as Cold-Ironing, which can reduce emissions from a ship whilst docked. Out of the 450-plus ports we visit, less than 1% are equipped with this technology. As of December 2020, Norwegian Bliss, Norwegian Encore, Norwegian Epic, Norwegian Jewel, Norwegian Joy and Norwegian Star are equipped with cold-ironing capabilities.\n\nEnergy Savings\n\nData is collected from all Norwegian ships to track the largest energy consumers on board and to assist in establishing Key Performance Indicators to identify where energy efficiency improvements can be made. Their goal is to focus on the large energy consumers and explore solutions to optimise operations and lower consumption.\n\nShipboard Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP)\n\nThe SEEMP is a ship-specific plan that focuses on improving energy efficiency. Norwegian does so through improving voyage planning, speed optimisation or operating engines on their most economic loads, optimisation of the air conditioning system and improving their ships' hydrodynamic capabilities by upgrading the propulsion systems with more efficient propellers. Onboard energy management meetings are also held quarterly to discuss energy conservation projects, tracking energy efficiency initiatives and future projects.\n\nOne of the most successful programmes implemented on their ships is Wasted Heat Recovery (WHR). This process works by recovering heat from the engines and transferring it to freshwater piping, which allows them to utilise a free source of energy for improving water production and saving fuel.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line is confident that you will enjoy your Freestyle Cruising experience and that their entire crew will provide you with the standard of service for which they are known. A discretionary service charge will be automatically added per guest per day (for guests three years and older) to your shipboard account for all staterooms: all ships US$ 16 per guest per day (for guests 3 years and older) for Studios, Inside, Oceanview and Balcony Staterooms. For Club Balcony Suites, the service charge will be US$ 18 per guest per day (for guests 3 years and older) and for Suites and The Haven Suites as well as the Concierge staterooms, the service charge will be US$ 20 per guest per day (for guests 3 years and older). This charge will be shared amongst those staff members, including the restaurant staff, stateroom stewards and other behind-the scenes staff who provide services that enhance your overall cruise experience.\n\nThese service charges can be paid in advance of your cruise. If you have any concerns about the service you receive during your cruise, please let Norwegian's on-board Guest Services Desk staff know right away, so they can address any issues in a timely manner. In the unlikely event that they can't resolve your issue, you can have the service charge adjusted on board. Where your service charge has been pre-paid before departure, refunds are not available on board and you must apply for a refund, if applicable, after you return home by writing to their Guest Relations department.\n\nCertain staff positions (e.g., concierge, butler, youth programme staff and beverage service) provide service on an individual basis to only some guests and do not benefit from the overall service charge. Norwegian encourages those guests to acknowledge good service from these staff members with appropriate gratuities.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 20% gratuity and spa service charge added for all spa and salon services, as well as a 20% gratuity and beverage service charge added for all beverage purchases and a 20% gratuity and speciality service charge added to all speciality restaurant dining and entertainment based dining e.g. Cirque Dreams¬Æ and Dinner (does not apply to Free at Sea dining and drinks packages).\n\nAs the health and well-being of Norwegian's guests and crew is of the utmost importance, indoor public areas, with the exception of the cigar lounges and the casino, throughout all Norwegian ships are smoke-free. Dedicated outdoor areas are assigned to smoking.\n\nIndoor Areas\n\nCigar Lounge: Cigar smoking is permitted in the designated cigar lounge. Cigarettes, pipe, electronic cigarettes and vapour smoking devices are not permitted in the cigar lounge. Cigar and pipe smoking on board Norwegian Sky, Norwegian Sun, Norwegian Star and Pride of America is permitted only in designated outdoor areas as there is no cigar lounge onboard.\n\nCasino: Norwegian Bliss, Norwegian Joy and Norwegian Encore have a designated smoking room within the Casino. On all other ships, active Casino players may smoke cigarettes, electronic cigarettes and vapour smoking devices in the Casino during gaming hours. Cigar and pipe smoking is not permitted in the Casino.\n\nStaterooms: Guests are not permitted to smoke cigarettes, cigars, pipe, electronic cigarettes and vapour devices in their staterooms or on their balconies. Smoking inside your stateroom or on your balcony will result in a $250 USD cleaning charge added to your onboard account. If cigarette burns on furniture, linens, towels or carpeting are detected; guests will be advised and charged for the damages. Guests in the Garden Villas may smoke in their private garden and on their private sun decks.\n\nOutdoor Areas\n\nSmoking, including cigars, pipe, electronic cigarettes and vapour smoking devices, is not permitted in or near venues serving food, the jogging track, outdoor sporting venues, children's pool areas, Vibe Beach Club, Posh Beach Club or The Waterfront.\n\nThe Haven: On ships with The Haven complex, smoking is not permitted in The Haven courtyard area, but is permitted in The Haven Sun Deck area (forward) on Breakaway Class and Breakaway Plus Class.\n\nOn Breakaway and Breakaway Plus Class ships and Norwegian Epic:\n\nOn Norwegian Breakaway, Norwegian Getaway and Norwegian Epic, cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe smoking and vapour smoking devices are permitted on deck 15 mid-ship, port side (limited area) and Spice H2O, starboard side.\n\nOn Norwegian Escape, cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe smoking and vapour smoking devices are permitted on deck 16 mid-ship, port side (limited area) and Spice H2O, starboard side.\n\nOn Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Joy, cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe smoking and vapour smoking devices are permitted at Spice H2O, starboard side.\n\nOn Norwegian Encore, cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe smoking and vapour smoking devices are permitted in the Smoking Room on Deck 8, portside.\n\nOn Jewel and Star Class ships and Norwegian Spirit:\n\nThe designated smoking areas for cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe smoking and vapour smoking devices are permitted on deck 13 forward port side.\n\nOn Norwegian Sky and Norwegian Sun:\n\nThe designated smoking areas for cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe smoking and vapour smoking devices are permitted on deck 12 forward by the entire bar. During inclement weather, deck 11 forward port side by the towel station is the temporary alternative location.\n\nOn Pride of America:\n\nThe designated smoking area for cigarettes, cigars, pipe, electronic cigarettes and vapour smoking devices are permitted at Waikiki bar on deck 13 aft.\n\nOnboard Production\n\nOnboard Norwegian vessels, water is primarily used by their guests and crew in their staterooms for showers, bathtubs and sinks but is also used for galleys, laundry, pools, whirlpools, spas and cleaning public spaces. Norwegian Cruise Line have focused their efforts on increasing water production on board with sophisticated plants that use seawater as the source, which reduces the need for the bunkering of fresh water. This is particularly important in countries where fresh water is limited and best reserved for local communities.\n\nReverse Osmosis (RO) produces fresh and technical water from seawater using high-pressure pumps and sophisticated water filters and treatment components.\n\nEvaporators produce fresh water from seawater utilising heat sources such as Exhaust Gas Boilers, Oil Fired Boilers or Wasted Heat recovered from the main engine high-temperature cooling system.\n\nBunkered Water is potable water acquired in port for use on board.\n\nWastewater Treatment Systems\n\nTo treat wastewater onboard, all Norwegian ships are equipped with Advanced Wastewater Purification systems (AWPs). Wastewater is run through these systems and treated prior to discharge, resulting in effluent that meets or exceeds international regulations and many municipal wastewater facility standards. Norwegian's newest ships are equipped with the leading AWP technology that meets the stringent Baltic Standards. Every ship's wastewater is tested quarterly by a third-party, and their environmental officers also conduct weekly water quality tests to ensure they continue to meet all standards.\n\nBilge Water\n\nWastewater collected in machinery and engine spaces is known as bilge water. Collected bilge water is held in storage tanks and can only be discharged after meeting international, national and company regulations. To ensure compliance, all ships are equipped with an automatic stopping device and an oil content metre, which work to confirm the ship's compliance. This equipment will analyse and record the oil content of the bilge. If the bilge water does not meet these requirements, discharging is automatically stopped and the bilge water is recirculated until these standards are met. The remaining bilge water that cannot be discharged is collected and landed ashore to an approved vendor.\n\nBallast Water\n\nTo operate safely and comfortably, ships perform an operation known as ballasting, which helps to ensure trim, stability and structural integrity. Filling ballast tanks with ocean water helps stabilise ships, providing comfort to guests and crew. As water is discharged or as fuel is consumed, ships take on seawater to assist with stabilisation. During this operation, some species are able to \"hitch a ride\" on ships and transfer to many areas of the world, including areas where they are non-native or invasive. Treating ballast water before release removes tiny organisms that may have been picked up in transit in order to safeguard local ecosystems."
