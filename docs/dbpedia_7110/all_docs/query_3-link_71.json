        "text": "The question that you would ask, if there was no Jeff out there is:\n\nIf I were to ask the opposite omniscient being about if Heaven is real, what would he say?\n\nGod would answer:\n\nWhatever the Devil would say, which is a lie.\n\nThe Devil would answer:\n\nThe opposite of what God would answer, hence, a lie.\n\nSo:\n\nThe correct answer is the opposite of the given answer.\n\nThis works so far without Jeff and is the classic solution of the Jeff-less problem. To work around Jeff, there is a boolean operator that is handy in cryptography to add confusion:\n\nXOR\n\nMix the question with something that only you and an omniscient being know:\n\nDoes my gmail password has an odd number of lowercase letters?\n\nSo what you should ask is:\n\nIf I were to ask the opposite omniscient being about if Heaven is real XOR my gmail password has an odd number of lowercase letters, what would he say?\n\nHence, the given answer:\n\nIs the correct answer if your password has an odd number of lowercase letters and the opposite of the the correct answer if your password has an even number of lowercase letters.\n\nYou\n\nhold firmly in your mind either the question \"If I asked you whether heaven is real, would you say yes?\" or the question \"If I asked you whether heaven is real, would you say no?\", choosing between them as randomly as you are able\n\nand then\n\nask: \"What is the answer to the question I was thinking about immediately before asking you this question?\".\n\nThen\n\nif your question was the \"would you say yes?\" question, then -- supposing for the moment that heaven is real -- God would say yes if asked whether heaven is real and will truthfully say so, whereas the Devil would say no if asked whether heaven is real and will falsely say he'd say yes; if heaven is not real then God would say no and hence will say no, whereas the Devil would say yes and hence will say no.\n\nBut\n\nJeff, who unlike God and the Devil does not know what you have been thinking, will have no way to learn anything from the answer since he has no idea what question it is answering.\n\nAsk the being:\n\nIs the boolean operation true: “Is heaven real” XOR “You are God” XOR “Is my middle name James”?\n\nThis makes use of a logical operation that helps us negate the truth of a statement. Some examples:\n\nThe operation is called \"XOR\". We can use it as follows:\n\nA XOR True = NOT A\n\nA XOR False = A\n\nLet's start with a simple question we can build upon:\n\nIs the statement true: “Is heaven real”?\n\nLet A be the answer to this question. God will answer A, truthfully. The Devil will lie and answer NOT A. Since we don't know the identity of the being, whether we hear a \"yes\" or \"no\" doesn't tell us anything about Heaven.\n\nSo let's simplify the lying problem:\n\nIf God says \"yes\" but the Devil says \"no\", we don't know which is lying. This means their answer should be conditioned on their own identity. Let's add XOR \"You are God\" to our question.\n\nOur boolean operation is now “Is heaven real” XOR \"You are God\".\n\n- God will answer A XOR True = NOT A\n\n- The Devil will answer (NOT A) XOR False = NOT A\n\nThe answer is unanimous. If either being says \"yes\", Heaven is not real. If either says \"no\", Heaven is real.\n\nUnfortunately, Jeff has all the information we have, and learns whether Heaven is real. Let's take care of that:\n\nWe add a personal question into the mix. For example: \"My middle name is James\". Our true middle name is only known to us and the omniscient being. So if we add XOR \"My middle name is James\" to our equation, there are 2 possibilities:\n\n- Our middle name IS James, which means we negate the entire equation.\n\n- Our middle name ISN'T James, which means we interpret the answer as before.\n\nWe know our middle name, so we know if we need to flip the being's answer. Jeff doesn't know, so the answer is useless to him."
