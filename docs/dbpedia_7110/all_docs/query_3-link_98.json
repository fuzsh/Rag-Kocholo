        "text": "Want to make sure your calls and messages can’t be intercepted? A new luxury phone promises to encrypt them all. The catch? It costs $4,000 - and you’ll need at least two of them.\n\nXOR is the rebirth of a concept that died with the demise of Vertu, a luxury smartphone brand that was liquidated in 2017. Hutch Hutchison, who was part of that Vertu team, is the co-owner and head of design at XOR, and he says the company has learned from Vertu’s mistakes. Namely, it won’t be trying to keep up with Apple and Samsung.\n\nConsequently, XOR’s debut Titanium handset is about as simple - technology wise - as phones come. There’s no touchscreen, no app store, no games. It’s an old-fashioned keypad phone wrapped in high-quality titanium and leather. It’s not designed to replace your everyday smartphone, says Hutchison, but to complement it.\n\nThe XOR Titanium is, according to Hutchison, “something that aspires to be in that select group of objects that feel personal, say something about you and that you treasure.” It’s a “little wingman,” he adds, a phone that will “look after you.”\n\nEncrypting calls\n\nOne of the ways in which the phone will “look after you” is by encrypting calls and messages. There is a substantial catch here, however: it can only encrypt calls and messages to other XOR handsets. That makes it a brutally expensive alternative to WhatsApp.\n\nThe XOR phone uses 256-bit AES encryption which provides end-to-end encryption of calls and messages, even over the GSM network, which is notoriously insecure - to the point where Microsoft recently warned not to use text messages for two-factor authentication.\n\nThe phone will use “a unique contact system and a series of secure one-time passwords” and that “conversations and data content will be safeguarded with the ability to delete data via the remote secret key”. Unlike WhatsApp, the encryption is hardware based, implemented in the encryption module in the chipset.\n\nUsers can choose whether or not to encrypt calls or messages, and the phone even has a unique ringtone to alert users when they are receiving an encrypted call and that you “might want to step away from anyone else,” when answering it, according to Hutchison. All very James Bond.\n\nOne other unusual feature is that the phone is fitted with an air-quality sensor. The phone checks on the ambient air quality every hour, with notifications if there’s a problem. Hutchison isn’t quite sure what the sensor is actually detecting, although he mentions both pollutants and strange chemicals.\n\nMystery owners\n\nPrecisely how the air-quality sensor works isn’t the only mystery surrounding XOR. The English start-up company was “founded by a small group of entrepreneurs”, according to Hutchison. “I’m afraid I can’t disclose who they are and what they do.”\n\nThe U.K. Companies House records for XOR UK Corporation Ltd, the company’s official name, lists only two directors: Hutchison and Lei Yan. Yan was previously a director of Vertu and the new company’s registered address is the same as Vertu’s, suggesting a strong link with the now defunct firm.\n\nHutchison says Vertu went wrong when that company’s owners failed to listen to him and tried to keep pace with Apple and Android smartphones, instead of focusing on the build quality of the handset itself. “The day a smartphone was made was the end of Vertu,” he says.\n\nXOR also won’t be bothering with one of Vertu’s more eyebrow raising features - a human concierge on 24-hour call. “Things like concierge services are no longer relevant,” Hutchison claims.\n\nThe Titanium phone\n\nAs for the Titanium handset itself, it has a traditional keypad and menus are navigated using a four-way directional pad. The screen is tiny by modern standards, more akin to an old-school cell phone.\n\nThe underside is convex shaped so that it’s “comfortable in the hand”, the corners are curved so they don’t dig into your fingers, and the buttons are concave so that they don’t take the impact of any drop. The smart-looking handset is clad in titanium and leather, and will come in four different styles. Each of them will cost £3,000 ($4,000), which is a price that Hutchison insists is a price “that a normal person can aspire to”.\n\n“This isn’t the phone for everyone, it is exclusive in that sense of the word, but it’s something you can aspire to have rather than something for somebody else,” he explains.\n\nIt will go on sale in January, although Hutchison isn’t yet sure from where. Let’s hope it’s not revealed by encrypted message."
