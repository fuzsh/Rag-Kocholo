        "text": "You probably know Dodge as the maker of American automobiles like the Challenger, Durango, and Hornet. However, Dodge is actually owned by Stellantis NV (STLA 0.32%), a multinational corporation. Stellantis is a publicly traded company that's listed on the New York Stock Exchange, along with Euronext Milan and Euronext Paris exchanges. That means anyone can become part owner of Dodge and the other vehicle brands that Stellantis owns by buying its stock.\n\nIn this article, we'll explain who owns Dodge. We'll cover parent company Stellantis' largest shareholders, as well as who serves on its board of directors. We'll also walk you through the steps you need to take if you want to invest in Dodge.\n\nOverview\n\nWho owns Dodge?\n\nDodge began as a machine shop founded by brothers John and Horace Dodge in Detroit in 1901. The business grew to become the largest machine shop in Detroit and formed a partnership with Ford Motor Co. (F 0.48%) in 1903. But just over a decade later, the Dodge brothers parted ways with Ford and decided to build their own vehicle.\n\nThe first Dodge vehicles were introduced in 1914. By 1919, Dodge was producing more than 100,000 vehicles per year. In 1928, the Chrysler Corp. acquired Dodge.\n\nIn the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Italian automaker Fiat acquired a major stake in Chrysler that it gradually increased over several years. In 2014, Fiat completed the acquisition and formed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). FCA later merged with Peugeot Invest and formed a new entity called Stellantis in 2021.\n\nToday, Stellantis owns multiple major auto brands, including Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler, Ram, Fiat, Opel, Maserati, Citroen, and Peugeot. The company trades on the New York Stock Exchange and is a top automotive stock. It recently began selling electric vehicles in the U.S. after selling EVs in European markets for several years.\n\nLargest shareholders\n\nWho are the largest shareholders?\n\nStellantis is the sole owner of Dodge and the other brands in its portfolio.

Since Stellantis is publicly traded, you can easily buy shares if you follow these steps:\n\n1. Open a brokerage account. Opening a brokerage account online takes just a few minutes through most major financial institutions. You'll need to provide a few pieces of information, like your name, email, address, date of birth, and Social Security number. Once you open the account, you'll need to transfer money to start trading.\n\n2. Set a budget. Next, determine how much you want to invest. But Stellantis (or any other individual stock) shouldn't be your only investment. You need to spread out your risk by investing across many different companies. The Motley Fool recommends building a portfolio of at least 25 stocks. If you don't want to handpick 25 stocks, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a good shortcut since you typically get exposure to hundreds of stocks with a single investment.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nHow to Invest in Project Omega\n\nProject Omega is a rumored Elon Musk project that aims to combine AI and renewable energy.

A limit order means you buy at a specified price.\n\n3. Do your homework. Consider your reasons for investing in Dodge before you buy Stellantis stock. Maybe you love your Dodge vehicle, which is as good a reason as any to consider investing. But take time to look through investor presentations and read up on the risks of automaker and auto parts stocks before you become an investor.\n\n4. Place your order. Your final step is to place an order once you've decided to invest your money. You'll need to enter the stock ticker for Stellantis, STLA. Then, you'll indicate either the number of shares you're buying or the dollar value you want to buy. You'll also need to choose between a market order (executes right away regardless of price) or a limit order (executes only at a specified price) before you place your order.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho owns Dodge: FAQ\n\nWho is the current owner of Dodge?\n\nangle-down angle-up\n\nDodge is owned by Stellantis NV, a publicly traded multinational automaker that was formed in 2021 after a series of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nDoes GM still own Dodge?\n\nangle-down angle-up\n\nDodge was never owned by GM.
