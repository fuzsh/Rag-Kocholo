Just as his company expanded, so did his leadership style. He realized that to truly scale, he needed to transition away from day-to-day operations, and he did so by forming an amazing executive team to manage those details. The key takeaway? Growth demands growth. How are you embracing the evolution of your business? How are you preparing to evolve your role to achieve the bigger picture?
