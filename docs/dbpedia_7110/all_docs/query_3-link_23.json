        "text": "Italy’s billionaire Agnelli family has acquired a 15% stake in Dutch conglomerate Philips The transaction is worth roughly $2.6bn and hopes to back the group's effort to shift away from consumer electronics to healthcare following a costly product recall. Once best known for producing branded lightbulbs, Philips is shifting from electronics towards health technology. Koninklijke Philips NV has various solutions under its arsenal such as diagnostic imaging, enterprise diagnostics informatics, monitoring and analytics, therapeutic care and population health management. The holding company, Exor N.V. can increase its stake to 20% and gain a seat on the board. Another big move in the health technology sector! #healthcare #healthtech #healthtechnology #medtech #philips\n\nAgnelli, The Italian multi-industry family business, has bought a 15% stake in the Amsterdam based Philips Company. Exor, Agnelli’s holding company bought a $2.8 billion worth of shares in Philips company in order to diversify its portfolio. It would like to diversify risk and have part of its portfolio allocated to the healthcare sector. The Dutch conglomerate Philips has shifted its activity away from electronics and towards health care and has suffered losses due to product recall. Most probably such event has enabled Exor to buy Philips’ shares at a deep discount and consequently gain exposure into the healthcare sector. Exor plans to take a seat in the board of directors and play a major role in formulating Philips company’s strategy. It is quite a well-studied move to buy Philips at a deep discount and at the late stage of its product recall. #Agnelli#Philips#recall#markets#economy\n\n*ICYMI* Olympus Unveils New Core Values Aligned with its MedTech Goals Olympus Corporation recently refreshed Our Core Values, which guide and align us toward a global leadership position in the MedTech space.

The Dutch conglomerate had posted losses after a massive recall of breathing devices and other challenges dampened sales and investor enthusiasm. That prompted Jakobs to cut thousands of jobs soon after stepping up in October of 2022. He approved a deal to settle economic loss claims related to the recall for about $429 million the following year. While Jakobs continues to deal with a decline in orders and other challenges, including a recall last month of some 150 MRI scanners at risk of exploding, he’s had success in turning the 133-year-old company around. Comparable sales for Royal Philips were up 11% in the third quarter to €4.5 billion, or roughly $5 billion, and the company made €224 million in income from operations after losing more than €1.5 billion a year earlier. Having cut jobs and streamlined the organization, he’s focused on accelerating the company’s growth in tech, from informatics and image-guided therapy to personal care. He’s excited by the potential of AI to not only improve his products but also expand access to more people, especially in underserved areas. Then again, few shifts are easy in healthcare. #ceo #ceomindset #ceolife\n\nThis month, our colleagues, Bob Barre, Marijn Kastelein and Remmelt Tempelman together with our managing director Bert Bruning, visited the Philips’ Healthcare Campus in #Best and witnessed firsthand the remarkable impact of their solutions. By leveraging the latest technologies and insights, Philips aims to accelerate the pace of innovation, ultimately improving the quality of care and outcomes for individuals and communities. During the visit, our colleagues discussed future business opportunities and joint financing solutions after a renewed meet & greet with Philips Direct Export Netherlands and Philips Medical Capital. Philips has established a longstanding collaboration with Atradius Dutch State Business to facilitate #healthcare financing transactions globally. Through our #ECA Financing Structure, cross-border healthcare providers can gain access to financing solutions, enabling the purchase of Philips medical equipment. Bob Barre: \"Philips' dedication to meaningful innovation left a lasting impression. Their focus on connected healthcare can empower hospitals and clinics with advanced technology for precise diagnosis and personalized treatment, facilitating patient recovery. However, it is clear to us that financial barriers can often become a decisive factor for exports in this industry despite the high demand for advancing technology. The synergy between Philips Medical Systems, and Atradius DSB can overcome these challenges, ensuring seamless deployment of healthcare financing solutions. We take the opportunity to thank and Jeroen Van Pol, Marija van der Vliet, Pascal Munsters, Rutger Spreij and Kursad Terzi, from Philips, for the gracious hospitality, insightful discussions, and for the enthusiasm in providing us with a glimpse into their technological advancements.
