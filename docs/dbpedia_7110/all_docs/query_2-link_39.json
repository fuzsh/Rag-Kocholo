        "text": "LONDON — The Italian investment company Exor raised the ante on Tuesday in its competing bid for the reinsurer PartnerRe, saying it was willing to pay $6.8 billion in cash.\n\nEarlier this month, PartnerRe’s board rejected Exor’s prior offer and said it was committed to its merger with Axis Capital Holdings.\n\nOn Tuesday, Exor, which is controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy, said that it had delivered an “irrevocable and binding offer” to PartnerRe’s board in which it would offer $137.50 a share in cash for PartnerRe, valuing the company at $6.8 billion. It wants PartnerRe’s directors to recommend that shareholders accept the deal.\n\n“Exor’s binding offer clearly delivers superior and certain value for PartnerRe shareholders, and provides a more attractive outcome for the company’s employees and clients,” John Elkann, the Exor chairman and chief executive, said in a news release.\n\n“We hope the PartnerRe Board agrees and does the right thing. In any event, we believe PartnerRe shareholders deserve the opportunity to choose our offer and, in order to do so, we urge them to vote against the inferior Axis transaction.”\n\nAfter the market closed on Tuesday, PartnerRe said it would review the revised Exor offer. “PartnerRe will have no further comment on Exor’s proposal until the board has completed its review,” it said in a statement.\n\nExor also said on Tuesday that it was PartnerRe’s largest shareholder with a 9.32 percent stake in the reinsurer.\n\nIn rejecting its prior, unsolicited offer of $130 a share, Partner Re said that Exor never expressed a willingness to increase its bid and that offer undervalued the company.\n\nOn Tuesday, Exor said it believed that PartnerRe’s directors had conducted a “flawed” review process to date and had “mischaracterized the nature of its discussions.”\n\nPartnerRe and Axis, which are both based in Bermuda, agreed in January to a so-called merger of equals that would create a new player in the specialized field of reinsurance with a combined market capitalization of more than $11 billion.\n\nEarlier this month, they revised the deal and said PartnerRe’s shareholders would receive a one-time special dividend of $11.50 a common share, in addition to shares in the combined company.\n\nShares of PartnerRe closed at $133.44 in trading in New York on Monday, while the shares of Axis closed at $55.10 in trading in New York on Monday."
