        "text": "UPDATE (June 1, 2017): Alongside the Forum, Bloomberg is establishing the Bloomberg Global Business Council, a select group of 10-20 global business leaders committed to high-impact business leadership. These CEOs are selected as a result of their legacy of leadership, their vision for a better world, and their principled interest in the important role that business plays in shaping global affairs. Co-chaired by Bob Steel, Partner and CEO of Perella Weinberg Partners and noted government leader and David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-CEO of the Carlyle Group, the Council will help shape the questions and substance of the Forum.\n\nBloomberg today announced the Global Business Forum, a gathering in New York of global business and government leaders to discuss plans for growth and opportunity around the world. The one-day event will occur in New York City on Wednesday, September 20th, 2017, in partnership with the Alibaba Group; Dangote Industries Limited; EXOR, the holding company controlled by the Agnelli family; and MiSK, the philanthropic foundation of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Global Business Forum will convene heads of state, government ministers, CEOs and NGOs in constructive conversations on global business, serving as a platform for business and government across large and emerging economies that are expected to work together to inspire and support economic prosperity. Attendees are expected to represent every region in the world and all major global economies.\n\n“This is a critical moment for the world’s economy. Recent events around the world have challenged the principles that have governed commerce for the past several decades. In transitional times like these, I believe business and government must work together to solve the issues affecting us all,” said Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and 108th Mayor of New York City.\n\nJack Ma, Executive Chairman of Alibaba Group, added: “Global trade has lifted hundreds of millions of people around the world out of poverty, but there’s more that we can do. Alibaba is proud to partner with Bloomberg, Dangote Industries Limited, EXOR, and MiSK to help make globalization more inclusive, enabling young people, small businesses, and developing countries around the world to share in its benefits.”\n\nAliko Dangote, President and Chief Executive of Dangote Industries Limited, stated: “As leaders across global business, it’s critical that we come together to determine the future of the world’s economic order and create an environment that reflects the new realities of globalization. We started this conversation at last year’s U.S.-Africa Business Forum, and look forward to broadening the dialogue with Bloomberg, Alibaba Group, EXOR, and MiSK.”\n\nJohn Elkann, Chairman and CEO of EXOR, said: “These times of extraordinary political, cultural and technological change are also highly disruptive and unsettling for many. As long-term owners of major global businesses we at EXOR are optimistic about man’s capacity to innovate to improve society for all. But this requires great clarity of vision and resolve. So we enthusiastically support the Global Business Forum that gathers leaders from many walks of life, from all around the world to identify smart, practical solutions to the great challenges of our time.”\n\nBader Al Asaker, Secretary-General of the MiSK Foundation, said: “MiSK is a leading not-for-profit that develops practical programmes to empower our citizens to become active participants in the Saudi and wider global economy. We also work with global partners across the NGO, corporate and governmental sectors to help facilitate important forums such as these. Co-hosting this conference in New York will serve to strengthen global collaboration and the exchange of ideas on how to navigate the manifold challenges and opportunities in the rapidly changing global economy. We hope all participants will draw benefits from the event.”\n\nTopics for exploration include trade, the future of globalization and the emergence of new economic leadership on the global stage, the drivers of and threats to global growth, the role of business in a fragmented global economy, and minimizing global disruption from automation.\n\nThe event will occur at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Additional details about the program and participants will be announced at a future date."
