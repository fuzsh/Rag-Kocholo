        "text": "Former British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has added to his collection of jobs with a new role as chairman of a partners council that will oversee European holding company Exor, the Times reported Friday.\n\nOsborne, who stepped down from parliament in May 2017, is also the editor of London’s Evening Standard, an adviser to U.S. fund manager BlackRock (a one-day-a-week advisory post that earns him £650,000 a year) and chairman of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. He holds a number of academic roles, including at Stanford University in California, and is listed as a speaker at elite speakers’ agency Washington Speakers Bureau.\n\nOsborne is now set to chair the newly formed partners council of Exor, the listed holding company of Italy’s wealthy Agnelli family, which owns the professional Italian football club Juventus and carmakers Fiat and Ferrari.\n\nThe partners council will also include Brazilian investor Jorge Paulo Lemann and Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris.\n\n“I am delighted to have been asked to chair this impressive panel of business leaders,” Osborne said. “They bring a wealth of experience from different industries and geographies. I look forward to chairing discussions that I am sure will provide useful insights and ideas for Exor and its companies.”\n\nExor’s chief executive John Elkann, the grandson of Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli, said Osborne’s personal experience and perspective will bring “his unique knowledge and viewpoint to the council’s work.”"
