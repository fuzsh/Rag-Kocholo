        "text": "As critical figureheads, Chief Executive Officers play a key role in how corporations are perceived by the public, and so it's vital that organizations keep their fingers on the pulse of CEO-focused media.\n\nIn collaboration with .companion, a data consultancy and KPI expert, Meltwater presents the 2022 CEO Echo; a monthly media intelligence analysis of CEOs heading up some of the world's largest brands. The ranking leverages Meltwater's media intelligence capabilities and automated analysis by the .companion bot to offer readers highlights and benchmarks across the following areas:\n\nTotal CEO Digital Footprint\n\nCEO Communication Excellence\n\nCEO Social Excellence\n\nCEO Responsibility Excellence\n\nCEO Investor Excellence\n\nContents\n\nMay 2022 CEO Echo rankings\n\nTotal Digital Footprint\n\nCommunication Excellence\n\nSocial Excellence\n\nResponsibility Excellence\n\nInvestor Excellence\n\nSource Information\n\nPrevious CEO Echo results\n\nMay 2022 CEO Echo rankings\n\n13% less CEO mentions\n\nLast month, the .companion CEO metrics bot found 13% less CEO mentions than the average of the previous month. Overall, 54% of mentions captured by the CEO Echo were generated by editorial online content, while social media generated 46%. In May, CEO Echo content saw engagement drop by 81%. 49% of all CEO mentions were related to financial news, meaning they simply referred to company figures that are often required to be disclosed by law. In contrast, the context of 51% of mentions was linked to corporate agendas. Overall, the tonality of mentions was equally positive as it was negative.\n\nHerbert Diess, Volkswagen CEO, dominates with 9% CEO Echo coverage\n\nWhat role does a CEO play in a company's overall corporate messaging, whether voluntary or involuntary? The CEO Digital Footprint aims to answer this question.\n\nIn May, Herbert Diess, Volkswagen's CEO, received the highest amount of media coverage. His share of voice totaled 9.4%, the largest footprint of all top board members. In second place was Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel, with 5.5%, and Bernard Looney, CEO of BP, took the third spot with 4.1% share of all mentions. 73% of conversations around Diess' echo were not related to company financials, and thus were below average for agenda-driving topics and content. 46% of Volkswagen's CEO echo came from editorial media and 54% from social media. Content that mentioned Diess generated 147 interactions (clicks, shares, likes) per mention. This shows that audiences are highly engaged and made Diess the 27th most engaged CEO in the ranking. In total, mentions for Herbert Diess were more positive than negative. We can assume this had a corresponding impact on his overall reputation.\n\nCommunication Excellence\n\nWuestenrot & Wuerembergische’s CEO, Jürgen Albert Junker, takes the number 1 spot\n\nTwo common goals widely shared by media teams are communicating key messages and building a favorable reputation, both of which rely heavily on editorial mentions. The Communication Excellence ranking analyses and aggregates media volume (removing financial report listings).\n\nJürgen Albert Junker, CEO of Wuestenrot & Wuerembergische, was ranked first in May. Outside of the paywall, 83% of his digital echo discussed the CEO in stories beyond financial figures. Stories generated 348 engagements per mention, signifying readers are highly interested. Furthermore, coverage was significantly more negative than positive. As a result, the response to Wuestenrot & Wuerembergische’s CEO CEO received 6.4 points. Anna Maria Braun, CEO of B.Braun came in second place with a score of 3.7 and R Mupita, CEO of MTN Group, took third place with a Communicaton Excellence score of 3.6 points.\n\nSocial Excellence\n\nJohn Elkann, EXOR/Ferrari’s CEO, wins first place\n\nThese days, simply having a social media profile is not enough. If you want to have an impact on opinion leaders outside of editorial offices, or on consumers and digital elites who are not easily accessible through the mass media, you have to be mentioned frequently on social media. The Social Excellence Index answers whether a company's attempts at this have been successful.\n\nLast month, John Elkann, CEO of EXOR/Ferrari, topped the ranking with a Social Excellence score of 3.6 points. 73% of the conversation came from social media and his engagement was somewhat indifferent with 7 interactions per mention. Moreover, the sentiments of his mentions were 49% positive, meaning Elkann was well ahead of runners-up Stefan Hartung, CEO of Bosch, with 2.6 points and Safra A. Catz, CEO of Oracle, who placed third with 2.5 points.\n\nResponsibility Excellence\n\nAndré Frei, CEO of Partners Group Holding, has the highest number of mentions surrounding social responsibility\n\nThe .companion metrics bot also determines whether CEOs appear in the digital media as leaders in the context of the UN's sustainable development goals, e.g. in the context of social responsibility or climate and environmental protection. Our Responsibility Index shows how well this has been achieved. For this index, the metrics bot only analyses mentions related to sustainability-related topics.\n\nIn May, André Frei, CEO of Partners Group Holding, saluted us from first place in the responsibility ranking, with 100% of Partners Group Holding CEO's mentions related to social responsibility topics. His engagement rate was 637 which can be considered highly engaged. The tonality of media conversations was significantly more positive than negative. Overall, Frei’s Responsibility Index came to 8.2 points. Jan Michael Mrosik, CEO of Knorr-Bremse, followed in second place with 5.3 points, and Oliver Schuster, CEO of Vossloh, in third place with 4.2 points.\n\nInvestor Excellence\n\nCisco Systems's CEO, Chuck Robbins takes the number 1 spot for the financial echo\n\nCEO mentions in the context of balance sheet figures offer little scope for setting content-related agendas but are crucial for building investor confidence. In this environment, the metrics bot determines which CEOs were mentioned from a financial standpoint, forming an index for investor communication.\n\nIn May, the .companion metrics bot identified Cisco Systems's CEO, Chuck Robbins, as the top communicator for investors after he achieved 7.5 points. 84% of his mentions were related to the financial environment, which is 1.4 times this month's average. His readership was highly interested, indicated by an engagement rate of 1087.0, and he experienced more negative than positive comments. He is followed in second and third place by André Frei, CEO of Partners Group Holding, with 4.9 points, and Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of Klarna (3.7 points).\n\nSource Information\n\nMedia conversations were tracked and analyzed globally with the help of the market-leading monitoring tool, Meltwater\n\nAll content is in German and/or English and publicly accessible across websites, forums, and social media\n\nThe text and content of the CEO Echo are generated automatically by the .companion metrics bot\n\nAll Excellence index values are based on three criteria:\n\n1.
