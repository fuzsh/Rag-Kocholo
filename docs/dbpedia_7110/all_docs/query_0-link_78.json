Especially in these difficult times, we greatly value EXOR's commitment to Via's vision of a dynamic, data-driven public mobility system that provides more cost-effective and equitable transport to communities everywhere. During this emergency period, we are proud to apply our technology and operational expertise to assist cities with optimizing transit networks, transporting essential workers, and delivering goods and services to individuals in need.\"\n\nCommenting on the investment, John Elkann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EXOR said: \"At this uniquely challenging moment it is more important than ever to work determinedly for the innovative and sustainable future beyond these difficult days.
