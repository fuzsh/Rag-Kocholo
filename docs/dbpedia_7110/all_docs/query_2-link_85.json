        "text": "Round-up of the weekly news and developments from the global (re)insurance market with stories from Covéa, AXA XL, Fidelis and more.\n\nCovéa to acquire PartnerRe from EXOR\n\nFrench insurer Covéa have reached an agreement with holding company EXOR over the sale of Bermuda based reinsurer PartnerRe which is wholly owned by EXOR. They have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) under the terms that EXOR would receive a total cash consideration of $90bn plus a cash dividend of $50mn to be paid before closing.\n\nIn 2016, EXOR acquired Partner Re for a cash total of $6.72bn representing roughly a 30% profit for the company. Since then EXOR has worked closely with the company to strengthen and develop the company’s business and expanding its presence in Life and Health reinsurance.\n\nIn a recent press release, EXOR explains PartnerRe’s operating performance since 2016 has enabled it to pay EXOR a total of $661mn in dividends and to increase its book value to common shareholders by $510mn to $6.57bn. The firm notes that this was achieved despite the recent challenges witnessed across the reinsurance industry.\n\nIncluding dividends received since 2016, the aggregate cash return to EXOR following completion of the proposed transaction will amount to $3 billion.\n\nThe proposed transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this year, subject to customary closing conditions, antitrust, regulatory and other approvals.\n\nJohn Elkann, chairman and CEO at EXOR, commented: “PartnerRe today is a stronger company, with a more complete and efficient business. We have now been presented with an outstanding chance for PartnerRe to further strengthen its competitive advantage while providing important new opportunities for its people under Covéa’s ownership. We are proud to have fulfilled EXOR’s purpose of building another great company and are grateful to PartnerRe’s Board, leadership and people for all they have done to make this possible.”\n\nEmmanuel Clarke, the CEO of PartnerRe, added: “Over the past four years, under EXOR’s ownership, we have strengthened PartnerRe’s position as a global, diversified reinsurer, thanks to a continuous focus on enhancing our client and broker franchise, our underwriting and investments portfolios and our operational efficiency. And I’m confident we are in a very good position to further evolve under our new ownership.”\n\nThierry Derez, chairman and CEO of Covéa, said: “This acquisition project comes at a time when the insurance sector is undergoing fundamental transformation, with emergence of new risks and new lifestyles, and increasing new participants entering insurance markets. It perfectly fits our growth strategy, our ability to adapt, the necessary complementarity of expertises and the importance of risks mutualization on a global basis. It would consolidate the future of PartnerRe and our mutual Group, serving the interests of our members and clients, as well as of our employees and partners.”\n\nPeter O’Neill promoted to UK head of downstream and power at AXA XL\n\nAXA XL insurance announced the promotion of Peter O’Neill to UK head of downstream and power succeeding Peter Welton, who was promoted to UK head of energy in October 2019.\n\nIn his new role, he will manage all aspects of the underwriting operations in the UK for downstream energy and power, ensuring strategic profitable growth and the development of the business.\n\nO’Neill joined AXA XL as an energy underwriter in June 2014 and prior to that he worked at AON in 2010 where he was selected for the company’s Impact Programme.\n\nWelton, UK head of energy at AXA XL, commented: “I am delighted that Peter will be taking on this role and have every confidence that his high level of technical expertise and knowledge will further strengthen our UK Energy business. His promotion is also a testament to the depth of talent we have here at AXA XL.”\n\nEverest Re Bermuda appoints Chris Downey to take over as CEO\n\nEverest Re group announced Chris Downey will be appointed as managing director and CEO of Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda) Ltd, succeeding Sanjoy Mukherjee who will return to his full-time duties as general counsel and corporate secretary of Everest Re, effective 1 April 2020.\n\nMukherjee initially joined Everest in 2000 and became executive vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary in 2005 before taking on the additional roles of managing director and CEO in 2016.\n\nWhilst assuming his additional responsibilities, Downey will continue his current role as chief underwriting officer of the reinsurance division at Everest. Mukherjee and Downey will work closely together over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nJuan C.

D&F is an area where significant capacity has been removed from the market allowing a pricing correction and creating a strong demand for new participants. We are very focused on being responsive to brokers and clients and believe Michael is the right person to lead the continued growth of this product line for us.”\n\nRichard Holden, executive head of reinsurance said: “We feel this is the right time to enter the Direct and Facultative market, utilising Bermuda and London brokers to access business. Michael brings 15 years of industry experience and market relations to Fidelis and we look forward to building another long-term class of business to complement our existing lines within the Fidelis group.”\n\nDavern added: “I am excited to join Fidelis, at a time when Fidelis can offer a solution for brokers’ and clients’ need for capacity. Given their reputation for client service and that they have a true underwriting philosophy at their core I look forward to growing the Direct & Facultative property book and contributing to Fidelis’ ongoing success.”\n\nAXA XL expands underwriting team in France\n\nAXA XL insurance, a division of AXA has announced the appointment of Stéphane Vauterin as underwriting manager, International Financial Lines for France, based in Paris.\n\nVauterin brings more than 2 decades of insurance experience and joins AXA XL from Zurich where he held numerous financial services and underwriting positions.\n\nJulien Guénot, country leader, France at AXA XL Insurance, commented: “As a major provider of financial lines insurance globally, we support our French clients with a full suite of specialised solutions from Directors and Officers insurance to Mergers and Acquisitions and Cyber.”\n\nAdding: “The recent increase in Directors and Officers claims, particularly in the large corporate segment, led to tension in that market. French clients and their brokers are, as a result, turning to insurers to help them navigate these developments.”\n\nSimona Fumagalli, underwriting manager, International Financial Lines – Europe at AXA XL, said: “Directors and officers of international companies face heightened risks as claims against them have spiked, driven by a combination of regulatory activity, third-party litigation funding, collective redress action in European Union, #MeToo and recessionary threat.
