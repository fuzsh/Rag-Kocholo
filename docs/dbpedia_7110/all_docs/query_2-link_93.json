Depending on the issue, it can actually be resolved at the controller without needing to send a person up to look at the fan or drive Itself.\"The 700 Series is a 7-inch liquid crystal display (LCD) touchscreen and is the largest controller that Hunter Industrial has to offer. Able to manage up to 30 fans at once, the 700 Series also features building management system (BMS) integration with an optional gateway, scheduling, zoning, password protection and fan diagnostics directly from the screen.The new standard controller for Hunter Industrial’s Titan Series fan is the 430 Series.
