        "text": "NEWS UPDATE, MARCH 24, 2020\n\nCNH Industrial, Suzanne Heywood has been appointed Acting Chief Executive Officer following the resignation of former CEO, Hubertus Mühlhäuser. Heywood will lead the business «through this current unprecedented period and until a new permanent CEO has been identified by means of a thorough search process», the group points out in a press release in the early morning of Monday 23th March 2020.\n\nMühlhäuser took the position of CEO in September 2018 and has managed the group through the massive internal reorganisation announced in early 2019. In September 2019, CNH Industrial’s 2020 – 2024 business plan was presented, which envisages the separation of CNH Industrial into two companies, both listed on the stock exchange, with Iveco and FPT separated from the group. A few days ago, CNH Industrial announced that, in light of the supply chain constrains caused by the COVID-19 emergency in Europe, it is suspending the majority of its European assembly operations for a two week period.\n\nCNH Industrial. Suzanne Heywood and her role within the Group\n\nSuzanne Heywood, who is also Managing Director of Exor, CNH Industrial’s largest shareholder, has been Chair of CNH Industrial since July 2018. Prior to joining Exor, she was a Senior Partner at McKinsey & Company where she led the firm’s Global Organization Design business prior to which she worked in the UK Treasury.\n\nHeywood is also a Board Member of the Economist and a Non-Executive Director of Chanel. In her combined role, she will chair the Group’s Global Executive Committee to provide the business with leadership during the coming months.\n\nCNH Industrial towards the spin-off\n\nThe Board also confirmed its continued strong support for the Group’s ‘Transform 2 Win’ strategy devised under the leadership of Mr. Mühlhäuser, including the spin-off of CNH Industrial’s ‘On-Highway’ assets (commercial vehicles and powertrain segments) that will be listed alongside the group’s ‘Off-Highway’ assets (agriculture, construction and specialty segments).\n\nThe resulting distinct world-leading businesses will each focus on creating value in their respective areas of activity."
