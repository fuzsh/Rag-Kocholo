Defined Terms 67\n\nAGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER\n\nThis Agreement and Plan of Merger (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of August 2, 2015, by and among Exor N.V., a Dutch public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) (“Parent”), Pillar Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), PartnerRe Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company (“PRE” ), and solely with respect to Sections ‎4.01 to ‎4.05, ‎6.13 and ‎Section 9.13 , EXOR S.p.A., a società per azioni organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy (“Parent Guarantor”). PRE, Parent, Merger Sub, and solely with respect to Sections ‎4.01 to ‎4.05, ‎6.13 and ‎Section 9.13, Parent Guarantor, are collectively referred to herein as the “parties.”\n\nW I T N E S S E T H:\n\nWHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (the “Parent Board”), the Board of Directors of Merger Sub (the “Merger Sub Board”) and the Board of Directors of PRE (the “PRE Board”) have determined that a business combination between Merger Sub and PRE is in the best interest of their respective companies and accordingly have determined to effect a business combination upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;\n\nWHEREAS, it is proposed that Merger Sub will merge with and into PRE (the “Merger”) with PRE continuing as the surviving company in the Merger (the “Surviving Company”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and a statutory merger agreement in a form to be agreed between the parties (the “Statutory Merger Agreement”), and in accordance with the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the “Companies Act”);\n\nWHEREAS, the Parent Board, the Merger Sub Board and the PRE Board have unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger is advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent, Merger Sub and PRE, respectively; and (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement and the Transactions;\n\nWHEREAS, that certain Agreement and Plan of Amalgamation dated as of January 25, 2015 as amended (the “AXIS Agreement”) between AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (“AXIS”) and PRE has been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement by PRE; and\n\nWHEREAS, in connection with such termination pursuant to an agreement dated as of the date hereof between AXIS and PRE (the “AXIS Termination Agreement”), PRE has agreed to pay to AXIS in cash $315,000,000 (the “AXIS Termination Fee”) in full satisfaction of all of PRE’s remaining obligations under the AXIS Agreement.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:\n\nArticle 1\n\nThe Merger\n\nSection 1.01. The Merger; Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, Merger Sub and PRE will cause an application for registration of the Surviving Company (the “Merger Application”) to be prepared, executed and delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda (the “Registrar”) as provided under S.108 of the Companies Act on or prior to the Closing Date and will cause the Merger to become effective pursuant to the Companies Act. The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance of a certificate of merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) by the Registrar or such other time as the Certificate of Merger may provide. The parties agree that they will request the Registrar provide in the Certificate of Merger that the Effective Time will be 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date (the “Effective Time”).\n\nSection 1.02. Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place at the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul, Weiss”), 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date (the “Closing Date”) that is the third Business Day after the day on which the last of those conditions (other than any conditions set forth in ‎Article 7 that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) is satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement, or at such other place and time or on such other date as Parent and PRE may agree in writing. When any condition is first satisfied after 11:00 a.m. New York City time on any day, that condition shall be deemed to have been first satisfied at 8:00 a.m. New York City time on the immediately succeeding Business Day for purposes hereof.\n\nSection 1.03. Effects of the Merger. As of the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall merge with and into PRE and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Surviving Company shall continue as the Surviving Company after the Merger. The parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes of Bermuda Law: (x) the Merger shall be effected so as to constitute an “merger” in accordance with S.104H of the Companies Act; and (y) the Surviving Company shall be deemed to be a “surviving company” as such term is understood under the Companies Act. Under the Companies Act, from and after the Effective Time: (a) the merger of Merger Sub with and into PRE and the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in the Surviving Company shall become effective; (b) the property of each of Merger Sub and PRE shall become the property of the Surviving Company; (c) Surviving Company shall continue to be liable for the obligations and liabilities of each of Merger Sub and PRE; (d) any existing cause of action, claim or liability to prosecution shall be unaffected; (e) a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding pending by or against Merger Sub or PRE may be continued to be prosecuted by or against Surviving Company; and (f) a conviction against, or ruling, order or judgment in favor of or against, Merger Sub or PRE may be enforced by or against Surviving Company.\n\n2\n\nSection 1.04. Surviving Company Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws.\n\n(a) The memorandum of association of PRE immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the memorandum of association of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or pursuant to applicable law; and\n\n(b) The bye-laws of the Surviving Company shall be in the form of the bye-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or pursuant to applicable law.\n\nSection 1.05. Governance; Directors and Officers.\n\n(a) The parties shall take all actions necessary to cause the Merger Sub Board at the Effective Time to constitute the full Surviving Company board of directors from and after the Effective Time to serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the Surviving Company.\n\n(b) The parties shall take all actions necessary to cause the officers of PRE at the Effective Time to constitute the officers of the Surviving Company from and after the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the Surviving Company.\n\nArticle 2\n\nConversion of Securities\n\nSection 2.01. Effect on Share Capital. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any share capital of Merger Sub or PRE:\n\n(a) Cancellation of Treasury Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each common share of PRE, par value $1.00 per share (a “PRE Common Share”) that is owned by PRE, Parent or by any respective Subsidiary or Affiliate of PRE or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Excluded Shares”) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no PRE Consideration shall be delivered in respect of the Excluded Shares.\n\n(b) Conversion of PRE Common Shares. Each PRE Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares) shall automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $137.50 without interest thereon (the “PRE Consideration”). As of the Effective Time, all PRE Common Shares shall be cancelled automatically and shall cease to exist and the holders of PRE Common Shares (the “PRE Shareholders”) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such PRE Common Shares, except: (i) in the case of the PRE Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares), the right to receive the PRE Consideration in accordance with ‎Section 2.02, and (ii) in the case of the PRE Dissenting\n\n3\n\nShares that are PRE Common Shares, the right to receive the excess, if any, of the fair value thereof as determined in accordance with (and subject to the terms and conditions of) ‎Section 2.02(f) over the PRE Consideration.\n\n(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Shares. Each common share of Merger Sub, par value $1.00 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable common share of the Surviving Company, par value $1.00 per share.\n\n(d) Certain Adjustments. The PRE Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully and equitably the effect of any share split, reverse share split, share consolidation, share subdivision, share bonus issue, share dividend (including any dividend or similar distribution of securities convertible into PRE Common Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event that occurs between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time with respect to PRE Common Shares in order to provide the PRE Shareholders with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement prior to any such event; provided, that nothing in this ‎Section 2.01(d) shall be construed to permit PRE to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement or the Statutory Merger Agreement.\n\n(e) Intentionally Left Blank.\n\n(f) Shares of PRE Dissenting Holders. At the Effective Time any PRE Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled, and unless otherwise required by applicable Law, be converted into the right to receive the PRE Consideration as described in ‎Section 2.01(b) or, as the case may be, the preferred shares of the Surviving Company as described in ‎Section 2.01(g) and any PRE Dissenting Holders, in the event that the Appraised Fair Value of a PRE Dissenting Share is greater than the PRE Consideration or, as the case may be, the value of their preferred shares of the Surviving Company described in ‎Section 2.01(g), be entitled to receive such difference from the Surviving Company by payment within thirty (30) days after such Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal procedure. PRE shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of (A) any demands for appraisal of PRE Dissenting Shares or withdrawals of such demands received by PRE and (B) to the extent that PRE has Knowledge, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the PRE Dissenting Shares; and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with PRE in, and to be regularly consulted by PRE with respect to, any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any written demands for appraisal under the Companies Act.\n\n(g) Preferred Shares. Each of the PRE Preferred Shares issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as preferred shares of the Surviving Company (“Surviving Company Preferred Shares”) and shall be entitled to the same dividend and other relative rights, preferences, limitations and restrictions as are now provided by the respective certificate of designation, preferences and rights of such PRE Preferred Shares.\n\n4\n\nSection 2.02. Payment Procedures.\n\n(a) Paying Agent. At least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent reasonably acceptable to PRE (the “Paying Agent”) for the purpose of acting as the paying agent for the payments to be made in respect of the share certificates registered in the name of a PRE Shareholder and representing PRE Common Shares (each, a “PRE Certificate”) or PRE Common Shares registered in the register of shareholders of PRE (the “PRE Share Register”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Uncertificated PRE Common Shares”).\n\n(b) Payment Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in accordance with this ‎Article 2 sufficient funds for the payment of the aggregate PRE Consideration to be paid in respect of the PRE Certificates and Uncertificated PRE Common Shares, together with the aggregate PRE Option Payments and PRE SAR Payments payable pursuant to this Agreement (except to the extent that Parent determines to make any such PRE Option Payments or PRE SAR Payments to employees through the payroll of the Surviving Company). The PRE Consideration and other amounts so deposited pursuant to this ‎Section 2.02(b) are hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund.” No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of the respective holders of the PRE Certificates and Uncertificated PRE Common Shares on cash amounts payable from the Payment Fund pursuant to this ‎Section 2.02.\n\n(c) Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Payment Fund as directed by the Surviving Company; provided, that such investments shall be in either direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed by, the United States of America or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by an internationally recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be promptly paid to the Surviving Company and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Sections ‎2.01(b) and ‎(d) shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Company. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, the Surviving Company shall promptly replace or restore the cash to the Payment Fund so as to ensure that there is sufficient cash for the Paying Agent to make all such payments.\n\n(d) Payment Procedures. As promptly as practicable (but in no event later than five Business Days) following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to: (1) each PRE Shareholder of record of PRE Common Shares converted pursuant to ‎Section 2.01(b): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in form and substance as the parties may reasonably specify at least three Business Days prior to the Effective Time, including that delivery shall be effective upon the proper delivery of the PRE Certificates or, in the case of Uncertificated PRE Common Shares, pursuant to customary provisions with respect to delivery of an “agent’s” message in accordance with the instructions set forth therein), and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of PRE Certificates or Uncertificated PRE Common Shares in exchange for the PRE Consideration. Following the Effective Time, upon surrender of title to the PRE Common Shares previously held by a PRE Shareholder in accordance with this ‎Section\n\n5\n\n2.02, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, a PRE Shareholder shall be entitled to receive the PRE Consideration in exchange therefor, and any PRE Certificate so surrendered shall be marked as cancelled immediately. In the event that the PRE Consideration is to be paid to a Person that is not registered in the transfer records of PRE, the PRE Consideration may be issued to such Person if: (i) the PRE Certificate representing such PRE Common Shares (if any) is presented to the Paying Agent; (ii) all documents so required to evidence and effect such transfer that are reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Company are presented to the Paying Agent; and (iii) evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Company is presented confirming that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.\n\n(e) Intentionally Left Blank.\n\n(f) No Further Rights in PRE Common Shares. All PRE Consideration paid upon the surrender of title to PRE Common Shares in accordance with the terms of this ‎Article 2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such PRE Common Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the PRE Share Register shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company of the PRE Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any outstanding PRE Common Shares are presented to the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent, such PRE Common Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged for PRE Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the provisions set forth, in this ‎Article 2.\n\n(g) Intentionally Left Blank.\n\n(h) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any PRE Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed PRE Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming to be the holder thereof, the PRE Consideration payable pursuant to this ‎Article 2 in respect thereof; provided, that the Surviving Company may, in its reasonable discretion, require such Person to either deliver a bond in such sum as the Surviving Company may reasonably direct or otherwise indemnify the Surviving Company in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Company against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent with respect to the PRE Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.\n\n(i) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the respective PRE Shareholders for 180 days following the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand. Any respective holder of PRE Common Shares who has not theretofore complied with this ‎Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of their respective PRE Consideration.\n\n6\n\n(j) No Liability. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, any PRE Consideration that remains undistributed to any PRE Shareholder shall be delivered to and become the property of the Surviving Company on the Business Day immediately prior to the day that such property is required to be delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Neither the Surviving Company nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any PRE Shareholder for any such property delivered to the Surviving Company or to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.\n\n(k) Withholding Rights. The Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any PRE Consideration or other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any PRE Shareholder such amounts as may be required under the Code or any other provision of applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and are paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the PRE Shareholder in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.\n\nSection 2.03. Treatment of Equity Awards.\n\n(a) Treatment of PRE Options. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase PRE Common Shares under any PRE Share Plan (each, a “PRE Option”), whether vested or unvested, shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable grant or award agreement and PRE Share Plan and, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon, equal to the product of (i) the total number of PRE Common Shares subject to such PRE Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the PRE Consideration over the exercise price per PRE Common Share of such cancelled PRE Option, less applicable withholding taxes (such excess amounts payable hereunder, the “PRE Option Payments”). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the product obtained by such calculation with respect to a PRE Option is zero or a negative number, then such PRE Option shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled without consideration, and such PRE Option shall have no further force or effect\n\n(b) Treatment of PRE Share Appreciation Rights. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding share appreciation right under any PRE Share Plan (each, a “PRE SAR”), whether vested or unvested, shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable grant or award agreement and PRE Share Plan and, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon, equal to the product of (i) the total number of PRE Common Shares subject to such PRE SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the PRE Consideration over the exercise price per PRE Common Share of such cancelled PRE SAR, less applicable withholding taxes (such amounts payable hereunder, the “PRE SAR Payments”).
