        "text": "The Board of CNH Industrial N.V. reached a unanimous decision and accepted the resignation of Hubertus Mühlhäuser as chief executive officer, who has left the Group with immediate effect. The Board thanked Mühlhäuser for his dedicated leadership, service and numerous contributions during his tenure.\n\nThe Board announced that it has appointed Suzanne Heywood as acting chief executive officer, in addition to her role as chair of the Board, to lead the business through this current unprecedented period and until a new permanent CEO has been identified by means of a thorough search process.\n\nHeywood, who is also managing director of Exor, CNH Industrial’s largest shareholder, has been chair of CNH Industrial since July 2018. Prior to joining Exor, she was a senior partner at McKinsey & Co. where she led the firm’s Global Organization Design business prior to which she worked in the UK Treasury. Heywood is also a board member of the Economist and a non-executive director of Chanel. In her combined role, she will chair the Group’s Global Executive Committee to provide the business with leadership during the coming months.\n\nHeywood commented: “The Board and our entire leadership are united in our determination to ensure that CNH Industrial emerges even stronger from the huge challenges of the days, weeks and months ahead. Above all, my thanks go to our exceptional people, wherever they are, as they apply their outstanding skills, strengths and knowhow to this purpose. And it goes without saying that their health and safety will be our priority as together we work our way through to more normal times.”"
