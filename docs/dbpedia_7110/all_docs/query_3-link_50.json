        "text": "We uncovered a malvertising campaign where the threat actor hijacks social media pages, renames them to mimic popular AI photo editors, then posts malicious links to fake websites.\n\nBy: Jaromir Horejsi Read time: ( words)\n\nSave to Folio\n\nOverview\n\nIn this blog entry, we examine how threat actors hijack social media pages, rename them to resemble a legitimate AI photo editor, then post malicious links to fake websites, which are boosted via paid ads.\n\nThe attackers use spam messages with phishing links to steal admin credentials. These links lead to fake account protection pages that trick users into providing their login information.\n\nOnce the attacker gains control of the page, ads are posted promoting the AI photo editor, leading victims to download an endpoint management utility disguised as the photo editor.\n\nThe ITarian software is used to execute additional payloads like Lumma Stealer, which exfiltrates sensitive data such as cryptocurrency wallet files, browser data, and password manager databases.\n\nCybercriminals are exploiting the popularity of AI tools by using them as lures for malicious activities, which includes phishing scams, deepfakes, and automated attacks.\n\nWe discovered a malvertising campaign involving a threat actor that steals social media pages (typically related to photography), changing their names to make them seem connected to popular AI photo editors. The threat actor then creates malicious posts with links to fake websites made to resemble the actual website of the legitimate photo editor. To increase traffic, the perpetrator then boosts the malicious posts via paid ads.\n\nThe abuse of paid Facebook promotions for malicious activities is not new. In 2023, we published two blog posts on profile stealers, which were implemented either as browser extensions or standalone applications.\n\nWhen victims open the malicious websites, they are tricked into visiting the download section and installing the package, which is — as expected — not a photo editor, but a legitimate endpoint management utility using a malicious configuration. After successful installation, this utility allows for remote device management. The attacker can then abuse the tool’s features to download and execute credential stealers, which ultimately leads to the exfiltration of sensitive data and credentials.\n\nTechnical analysis\n\nSpamming the Facebook page with fake complaint and terms of violations messages\n\nTo gain control of the target social media page, the threat actor will first send messages to the administrator containing phishing links, which can either be direct links or personalized link pages (linkup.top, bio.link, s.id, and linkbio.co, among others). Sometimes these links abuse Facebook’s open redirect URL, >, to seem more legitimate.\n\nThe sender of the message will typically use an empty profile with randomly generated usernames followed by a few digits.\n\nPhishing website for collecting victim credentials\n\nIf operators of the targeted Facebook pages click on the personalized links, they are presented with a screen similar to those shown below.\n\nClicking on the “Verify Your Information Here” links lead to a fake account protection page, which in several subsequent steps, asks users for the information necessary to log in and take over their account, such as their phone number, email address, birthday, and password.\n\nAfter the target provides all the needed information, the attacker then steals their profile and starts posting malicious ads.\n\nCreating malicious posts and promoting them via paid advertisements\n\nAfter taking control of the Facebook pages, the threat actor will start posting advertisements that links to the fake AI photo editor domain. In this case, the name of the legitimate photo editor being abused is Evoto.\n\nFake photo editor web page\n\nThe fake photo editor web page looks very similar to the original one, which helps in tricking the victim into thinking that they are downloading a photo editor. The reality however, is that they are actually downloading and installing an endpoint management software.\n\nInterestingly enough, the JavaScript responsible for downloading the package contains statistics in a variable called download_count. At the time of writing this report, there are approximately 16,000 hits for Windows binary and 1,200 hits for the MacOS version (which only redirects to apple.com and does not return any binary).\n\nAbusing ITarian remote monitoring and management software\n\nWhen victims execute the installation MSI package (disguised as a photo editor installer), their devices are immediately enrolled for management, giving the threat actor full access to remotely control the device.\n\nAs shown in the link from Figure 9, the downloaded file is an ITarian installer. ITarian is a free endpoint management software. Threat actor signs up for a free account, registers a subdomain (seen in the subdomain itstrq in Figures 9 and 10), and creates an installation MSI package. This installation package needs to be distributed to victims for installation.\n\nInterestingly, the MSI package itself does not contain any malicious components. It does not even contain any file with a malicious configuration. Instead, we get the installer file name format: em_<token>_installer.msi. When querying https://mdmsupport.comodo.com/enroll/resolve/token/<token>, we receive the malicious enrollment configuration.\n\nWhen the device is successfully enrolled for remote management, a few scheduled tasks are executed. The scheduled tasks are of the Python_Procedure type and contain\n\n1) A simple downloader in Python to download and execute an additional payload.\n\nOf note is the user agent value “Magic Browser”. The additional payload is typically Lumma Stealer and its binary is usually encrypted with PackLab Crypter.\n\n2) A simple script to exclude disk C: from being scanned with Microsoft Defender.\n\nThe script modifies Windows Defender settings by calling Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath.\n\nLumma Stealer as the final payload\n\nThe final payload is Lumma Stealer, which has its initial C&C communication characterized by two consecutive POST requests to the /api URL path with the x-www-form-urlencoded content type. The first request content is act=life, followed by the second requests content, “act=recive_message&ver=<version>&lid=<id>&j=” (sic!), which returns a Base64 encoded stealer configuration.\n\nThe first 32 bytes of the debased buffer is a XOR key, while the remaining bytes are the encrypted configuration. The decrypted configuration is in JSON format and lists everything the stealer is supposed to steal.\n\nTactic Technique ID Initial access Phishing: Spearphishing Link T1566.002 Resource Development Compromise Accounts: Social Media Accounts T1586.001 Execution User Execution T1204 Defense Evasion Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information T1140 Defense Evasion Impair Defenses T1562 Defense Evasion Obfuscated Files or Information T1027 Credential Access Credential Access T1056 Credential Access OS Credential Dumping T1003 Discovery File and Directory Discovery T1083 Discovery System Information Discovery T1082 Discovery Browser Information Discovery T1217 Collection Archive Collected Data T1560 Collection Automated Collection T1119 Collection Data from Local System T1005 Collection Input Capture T1056 Command and Control Data Encoding T1132 Command and Control Data Obfuscation T1001 Command and Control Encrypted Channel T1573 Command and Control Remote Access Software T1219 Exfiltration Automated Exfiltration T1020 Exfiltration Exfiltration Over C2 Channel T1041 Impact Financial Theft T1657\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nThe indicators of compromise for this entry can be found here.\n\nMeanwhile, the decrypted config file can be found here.\n\nTags\n\nAuthors\n\nJaromir Horejsi\n\nThreat Researcher"
