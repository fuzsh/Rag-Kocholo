        "text": "EXOR, one of Europe’s leading listed investment companies -controlled by the Agnelli Family and with a NAV (Net Asset Value) of $14 billion–, has this month closed the sale of its entire shareholding in Cushman & Wakefield to DTZ, a company owned by an investor group composed of TPG, PAG and OTPP.\n\nCushman & Wakefield and DTZ will now merge to create one of the world’s largest real estate services companies in a transaction that establishes a total enterprise value for Cushman & Wakefield of $2.042 billion. The deal generates net proceeds of $ 1.278 billion in respect of EXOR’s 75% shareholding in Cushman & Wakefield, representing a capital gain for EXOR of approximately $ 722 million.\n\nDTZ owners, TPG Capital, PAG Asia Capital and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, have made clear their commitment to investing in the combined company’s future growth as well as retaining and capitalising upon Cushman & Wakefield’s outstanding senior management and brokerage talent.\n\nUnder the leadership of Cushman & Wakefield CEO, Ed Forst, in 2014 the company delivered record results in terms of revenues and margins, with commissions and service fee revenues of $2.1 billion, Adjusted EBITDA of $175.4 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.4%. When EXOR acquired its controlling stake in Cushman & Wakefield in March 2007, commissions and service fee revenues were $1.5 billion, EBITDA stood at $116 million and the firm’s EBITDA margin was 7.6%."
