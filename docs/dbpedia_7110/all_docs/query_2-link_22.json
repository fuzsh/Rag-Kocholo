He has 30 years of experience in the luxury and retail industry and has held senior positions throughout his career, including CEO and Brand President at footwear brand Stuart Weitzman (Tapestry Group) and CEO at Salvatore Ferragamo and Furla, where he drove the global growth of the brands.\n\nDonald Kohler, a seasoned executive with considerable knowledge of the international fashion industry who has held key positions such as President of Burberry Americas, Chief Executive Officer Americas & Chief Retail Officer at Ferragamo and President of Ann Taylor Group, has been appointed to succeed Eraldo Poletto as Diesel CEO for North America.\n\nDiesel extends its sincere thanks to Massimo Piombini and wishes Eraldo Poletto and Donald Kohler the best of luck as they navigate these exciting times the company has been experiencing since creative director Glenn Martens joined Diesel.\n\nCalvin Klein Appoints Jonathan Bottomley as Global Chief Marketing Officer\n\nCalvin Klein announced the appointment of Jonathan Bottomley as Global Chief Marketing Officer, Effective June 6, 2022.\n\nIn this role, he will report to Trish Donnelly, CEO, PVH Americas & Calvin Klein Global, and will oversee all aspects of the Consumer Marketing Organization.\n\nMr. Bottomley joins Calvin Klein from Boll & Branch, an L-Catterton portfolio company, where he served as CMO. Previously, he served as Global CMO for Ralph Lauren, where he led all brand strategy, marketing, creative and consumer experience activities across channels and geographies. Mr. Bottomley has also been Chief Strategy Officer for some of the world’s top agencies, including BBH in London and Virtue, the creative arm of Vice Media in New York.\n\nTrish Donnelly, CEO, PVH Americas & Calvin Klein Global, said, “Jonathan is a highly experienced and transformational marketing leader.

Earlier this year, adidas announced the first wide-sweeping, equitable and inclusive NIL network reaching more than 50,000 eligible student-athletes across 23 sports and all genders at 109 D1 universities.\n\nThis announcement moves the brand into the next phase of its NIL program as adidas begins to welcome individual student-athletes as brand ambassadors, the first group of whom will be women competing in multiple different sports. As part of her multi-year contract with adidas, Rose will proudly represent the 3-Stripes both on and off the course in all competition, training, and other play outside her university team obligations. She will also feature in brand marketing campaigns promoting the newest products in golf apparel and footwear.\n\n“adidas has been a major part of some of my biggest wins as an amateur, so this is an exciting moment for me,” said Zhang. “I’m most comfortable wearing the 3-Stripes on the course and can’t wait for what’s ahead.”\n\nFor more than two years, Zhang has held the top spot in women’s amateur golf. She’s a two-time AJGA Player of the Year (2019, 2020) and has represented the United States on the Junior Solheim Cup (2017, 2019), Junior Ryder Cup (2018) and Curtis Cup (2021) teams, all of which were victorious. Perhaps her biggest triumph to date, at just 17 years old, Rose became the first woman in history to win the U.S. Women’s Amateur (2020) before winning the U.S. Girls’ Junior (2021).\n\n“We are happy to officially welcome Rose to the adidas family,” said Rupert Campbell, president of adidas North America. “Rose embodies a winning Impossible is Nothing attitude on the golf course and we’re excited to start this new chapter of working with student-athletes.”\n\nThis week marks Rose’s fourth consecutive start at the U.S. Women’s Open , having qualified as an amateur for every championship since 2019.\n\n“Rose is an extraordinary athlete , a class-act both on and off the golf course and is determined to be the best in the world every single day,” said Tim McNulty, global director of sports marketing, adidas Golf. “Having Rose join team adidas is something we’ve been looking forward to for quite some time, and we look forward to supporting her as she continues to make her mark on women’s golf around the world.”\n\nWhile Rose is the first student-athlete to sign a NIL endorsement agreement with adidas, this is just the start. The brand will share more soon about the first wave of Rose’s fellow individual women student-athletes who are joining team adidas and how adidas is investing in equality initiatives aimed at increasing awareness and representation to make sport accessible to all.\n\nKaren Katz to become interim CEO at Intermix\n\nBeginning June 7th, Karen Katz, Intermix Board Member, will become interim CEO.
