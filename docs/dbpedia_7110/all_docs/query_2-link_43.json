(NYSE: CNHI / MI: CNHI) announces that it has appointed Suzanne Heywood as Acting Chief Executive Officer, in addition to her role as Chair of the Board, to lead the business through this current unprecedented period and until a new permanent CEO has been identified by means of a thorough search process.\n\nThe Board reached its unanimous decision and accepted the resignation of Hubertus Mühlhäuser as Chief Executive Officer, who has left the Group with immediate effect. The Board thanks Mr. Mühlhäuser for his dedicated leadership, service and numerous contributions during his tenure.\n\nSuzanne Heywood, who is also Managing Director of Exor, CNH Industrial’s largest shareholder, has been Chair of CNH Industrial since July 2018. Prior to joining Exor, she was a Senior Partner at McKinsey & Company where she led the firm’s Global Organization Design business prior to which she worked in the UK Treasury. Suzanne Heywood is also a Board Member of the Economist and a Non-Executive Director of Chanel.\n\nIn her combined role, she will chair the Group’s Global Executive Committee to provide the business with leadership during the coming months.\n\nMeeting under her leadership, the Board also unanimously agreed on the appointment of Oddone Incisa as Chief Financial Officer, in addition to his current role as President, Financial Services. Mr. Incisa began his career with the Fiat Group in 1997 at Fiat Bank in Germany, and in 2001 was named Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Banco Fiat, Brazil. In 2003 he was appointed Head of Financial Planning & Analysis, Fidis Retail and FGA Capital, Italy, and in 2008 was nominated CFO, CNH Capital, based in the U.S. From 2011 to 2013 Mr. Incisa held the position of Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, FGA Capital (now FCA Bank)."
