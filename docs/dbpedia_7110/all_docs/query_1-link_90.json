        "text": "The journey to Industry 4.0 accelerated over the past year as industrial organizations recognized the need to do more with less. Despite residual challenges, including disrupted supply chains and worker shortages, factory digitization presents a massive opportunity for manufacturers to optimize efficiency and even surpass previous years’ KPIs. Technologies like artificial intelligence, real-time data analytics and the Industrial Internet of Things open a vast number of application opportunities to lower maintenance costs, reduce disruptions, improve quality control and more. When these solutions are based upon standards with open architectures, it further lowers the barrier to entry for small and mid-sized organizations, while making it easier for large organizations to scale across many facilities. Finally, as the promise of on-premise 5G networks becomes a reality, manufactures are presented with even more paths on the journey to Industry 4.0.\n\nIn this discussion, Intel and partners, John Deere and EXOR International, will discuss the current industry landscape, key considerations and best practices for digitization efforts and the anticipated impact 5G will have on the industry.\n\nExor\n\nBlog: EXOR 5G Smart Factory\n\nPeering into the future, a stable 5G network in 2025 will also aid widespread adoption of Industrie 5.0 whereby a complementary balance between human and machine contributions is achieved. Today, industrial stakeholders must make do with the 16th release of 5G, which still delivers lower latency, high bandwidth, and deterministic Wi-Fi to its end users. The features it currently delivers can be used to implement predictive maintenance strategies, plant optimization plans, and other data-driven strategies within the average factory floor.\n\nEXOR Industrial Automation - Hardware and Software solutions\n\nExor International provides products and services that support the growing need for intelligence in industrial automation markets during the rapid, ongoing digital transformation and streamlining of nearly every industrial process in nearly every factory on the planet.\n\nThese systems must meet the needs of the individual customer and respect \"man and the environment\", our slogan is \"Technology for life\".\n\nDisseminating the culture of quality, environmental aspects and safety obligations within the company through appropriate training actions, safeguarding the work environment and worker safety.\n\nIntel\n\nSolution Brief: Cyclone V SoC-Based EXOR eXware 707 Series Gateway\n\nIndusty 4.0 and Smart Factories are driven by data. Intel® FPGA based Industrial IoT Gateways from EXOR provide the device and cloud connectivity, data consolidation, and edge analytics required to realize data and drive the evolution of industy. This solution can be used to reduce energy consumption with equipment monitoring, increase uptime through predictive maintenance, and improve productivity with insight-driven decisions, among many other applications. Read this solution brief to learn more about EXOR's Industrial IoT Gateways.\n\nBlog: How EXOR Forged an Industry 4.0 Edge and Cloud Infrastructure Out of More than 200 Industrial Automation Protocols\n\nExor International provides products and services that support the growing need for intelligence in industrial automation markets during the rapid, ongoing digital transformation and streamlining of nearly every industrial process in nearly every factory on the planet.\n\nPaving the Way for Smart Factories\n\nIntel, EXOR Int’l and Telecom Italia collaborate to demonstrate benefits of on-premise 5G private network alongside AI.\n\nJohn Deere\n\nJohn Deere US\n\nWe run to create new ways of thinking and develop new ways of doing. Not to disrupt the status quo, but to evolve customer-focused solutions that move their jobs forward in ways that are easier and more profitable"
