        "meta_description": "The share capital of Ferrari amounted to €2,573 thousand, comprising 193,923,499 common shares and 63,349,112 special voting shares, all with nominal value of €0.01 per share, as at December 31, 2020. At the same date, Ferrari held 9,175,609 common shares and 2,190 special voting shares in treasury.",

        "text": "(1) The percentages of share capital set out in this table are calculated as the ratio of (i) the aggregate number of outstanding common shares beneficially owned by the shareholder to (ii) the total number of outstanding common shares (net of treasury shares) of Ferrari. These percentages may slightly differ from the percentages of share capital included in the public register held by the AFM of all notifications made pursuant to the disclosure obligations under chapter 5.3 of the Dutch Act on financial supervision (Wet op het financieel toezicht; the “AFS”), inter alia, because any shares held in treasury by Ferrari are included in the relevant denominators for purposes of the AFS disclosure obligations.\n\n(2) Each of Exor and Trust Piero Ferrari participate in the loyalty voting program of Ferrari. As of February 9, 2024, Exor owned 44,435,280 special voting shares and Trust Piero Ferrari owned 18,892,160 special voting shares. Therefore, the voting power of Exor and Trust Piero Ferrari in Ferrari is higher than the percentage of common shares beneficially held as presented in this table.\n\n(3) Based on filings with the SEC (Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13G filed on February 13, 2024, File No. 005-89223), BlackRock, Inc. is a parent holding company or control person in accordance with Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(ii)(G) and, out of the common shares beneficially owned as set forth in the table, it has sole voting power over 10,278,339 common shares.\n\n(4) The percentages of voting rights set out in this table may slightly differ from the percentages of share capital and voting rights included in the public register held by the AFM of all notifications made pursuant to the disclosure obligations under chapter 5.3 of the Dutch Act on financial supervision (the “AFS”), inter alia, because any shares held in treasury by Ferrari are included in the relevant denominators for purposes of the AFS disclosure obligations, although such treasury shares cannot be regarded to be part of Ferrari’s “outstanding share capital” and therefore have not been taken into consideration for the calculations of the percentages of share capital and voting rights set out in this table."
