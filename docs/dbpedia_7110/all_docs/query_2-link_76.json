        "text": "Pearson has sold its 50% stake in the Economist Group, publisher of the Economist, to existing shareholders for £469m in cash.\n\nThe deal, a fait accompli following Pearson’s sale of the Financial Times to Nikkei for £844m last month, will see a major change in the power structure of the major shareholders that control the Economist Group.\n\nExor, the investment company led by the 39-year-old Fiat heir John Elkann, has paid £287m to increase its stake from 4.7% to 43.4% and become the single largest shareholder in the Economist Group.\n\nElkann, who is already on the publisher’s board, will also have the right to select six of the 13-strong board members.\n\nA spokesman for the company said no immediate changes in the composition of the board are planned.\n\n“By increasing our investment in the Economist we are delighted to affirm our role as one of the group’s long-term supportive shareholders, along with the Cadbury, Layton, Rothschild and Schroder families and other individual stable investors,” said Elkann.\n\nPearson has also sold part of its stake to the Economist Group directly, 5.04m ordinary shares for £182m, which it is using to give all existing shareholders a 25% increase in their existing holding.\n\nThis means that the Rothschild family, now the second biggest shareholder in the Economist, will see its stake rise from 21% to 25%.\n\nThe overall deal includes an amendment to the group’s articles that will mean that there is a 20% voting cap for any individual shareholder, designed to safeguard the independence of the company and the editorial independence of the Economist.\n\n“We have been blessed over many years to have had in the Financial Times and subsequently Pearson, a shareholder that understood and supported the ethos of the group,” said Rupert Pennant-Rea, chairman of the Economist Group.\n\n“With their decision to sell, the board’s priority was to secure the independence of the ownership of the group and the continued editorial independence of the Economist. The strength of the group’s balance sheet meant that we could reorganise our shares so as to reinforce our editorial independence and benefit our shareholders. The transaction has the full support of the board, the trustees and the current editor of the Economist as well as her surviving predecessors.”\n\nPennant-Rea welcomed the willingness of Exor, a shareholder for six years, to cap its voting rights at 20%.\n\nHe said that the deal will be funded by the sale of the Economist complex, three buildings in London’s St James’s Street valued at more than £150m, with the publisher’s editorial operations moving to new offices to give more space “for our digital ambitions and the needs of a 21st century media company”.\n\nThe Economist Group’s commercial operations are in Canary Wharf. There are no plans to co-locate editorial operations there.\n\nElkann, who also sits on the board of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, used the deal announcement to publicly give his support the Economist’s top management, editor-in-chief Zanny Minton Beddoes and group chief executive Chris Stibbs.\n\n“We are convinced of the huge potential that still lies ahead and particularly in the Economist’s ability to seize the many development opportunities linked to the digitisation of the media industry, under the leadership of Zanny Minton Beddoes and Chris Stibb,” he said.\n\nThe editorial values of the Economist will continue to be overseen by its four independent trustees.\n\nElkann is the grandson of Gianni Agnelli and oversees the family empire which has interests including Fiat Chrysler, Juventus football club and the publishers of Corriere della Sera, a leading Italian daily newspaper, and Turin daily La Stampa.\n\nPearson said that the divestment of its last newspaper asset meant that it was now focused on education.\n\n“Pearson is proud to have been a part of the Economist’s success over the past 58 years, and our shareholders have benefited greatly from its growth,” said Pearson chief executive John Fallon. “Pearson is now 100% focused on our global education strategy. The world of education is changing rapidly and we see great opportunity to grow our business through increasing access to high quality learning globally.”"
