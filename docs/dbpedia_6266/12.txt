William Monroe Trotter School (Elementary)

35 Humboldt Avenue, Dorchester

Built 1969

William Monroe Trotter (1872-1934), a political leader and civil rights activist, was born on an Ohio farm. When he was still an infant, his family moved to Boston. He grew up in Hyde Park, where he was valedictorian of the class of 1886. Trotter graduated from Harvard in 1895 and received his Master’s Degree one year later. He was the founder and editor of the Boston black newspaper The Guardian and committed his life to the struggle for civil and political rights for his people. His home still stands on Jones Hill.

This school is included in this website because Trotter lived in Dorchester for a portion of his life.
