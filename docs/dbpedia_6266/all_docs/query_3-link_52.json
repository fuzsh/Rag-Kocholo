        "text": "In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that racial segregation was not discrimination and could continue as long as both groups were treated equally. This decision meant that state-level civil rights laws no longer offered African Americans any protection from segregation, discrimination, and disenfranchisement.\n\nAs federal civil rights deteriorated, Black Bostonians fought back. They created the Racial Protective League to fight against lynching and joined the Afro-American Council to mobilize Blacks across the country around racial violence and weakened civil rights. William Monroe Trotter founded the National Equal Rights League, which fought against segregation, disenfranchisement, and lynching. Black Bostonians also joined W.E.B. DuBois (1868-1963) in the Niagara Movement, which revived the radical abolitionist spirit in a militant assault on Jim Crow legislation, lynching, and employment discrimination.\n\nAfter the Niagara Movement’s collapse, many joined African Americans and white progressives in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The National Equal Rights League lives on today in the form of the Boston Equal Rights League, which continues the Attucks Day tradition in Boston.\n\nIn 1915, D.W. Griffith released his racist film The Birth of a Nation, which celebrated white Southern violence against formerly enslaved people at the end of the Civil War. The movie glorified the violent end of Reconstruction and led directly to the creation of the new Ku Klux Klan.\n\nTrotter and the National Equal Rights League (NERL) organized local protests against the film in collaboration with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Trotter rallied support by invoking Crispus Attucks, since his presence at the Boston Massacre indicated that Black and Native people were present at the real “birth of the nation.” Despite the protests, Boston Mayor Michael Curley (1874-1958) allowed an uncensored version of the film to be shown at the Tremont Theater, where Trotter was arrested for protesting the film.\n\nWILLIAM MONROE TROTTERPhotographer unknown\n\nDate unknown\n\nPhotograph\n\nReproduction\n\nClick image to view larger.\n\nBorn in Ohio but raised in Boston’s Hyde Park neighborhood, William Monroe Trotter grew up in the heart of Boston’s abolitionist community. His family included former slaves and operatives on the Underground Railroad. William Cooper Nell was a family friend. Trotter grew up hearing stories about Crispus Attucks and other soldiers of color in the Revolution.\n\nHis father, James Monroe Trotter (1842-1892), was a prominent figure in the African American community. James Trotter was a Lieutenant of the 55th Massachusetts Regiment during the Civil War and served as Recorder of Deeds during the first administration of President Grover Cleveland (1837-1908). During the 1888 dedication of the Boston Massacre Monument, James Trotter was one of the distinguished speakers."
