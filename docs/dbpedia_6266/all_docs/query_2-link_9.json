        "text": "652 - HISTORY OF PICKAWAY COUNTY\n\n(RETURN TO THE TITLE PAGE)\n\nGEORGE W. HITLER. Pickaway County is noted for its many men of substance and reliability and for its rich agricultural districts. Among the old and prominent families settled in the vicinity of Circleville that of Hitler takes a leading place. A prominent representative of this old Pennsylvania family, which has been established here for several generations, is George W. Hitler, who owns a fine stock farm of 150 acres, in Wayne township, on the Darby Plains. Mr. Hitler was born on April 29, 1845, in Circleville township, Pickaway County, Ohio, and is a son of George and Hannah (Ludwig) Hitler.\n\nThe paternal grandparents of George W. Hitler were George and Susannah (Gay) Hitler, the former of whom was a native of Maryland and the latter probably of Franklin County. Pennsylvania. In 1793 the grandparents removed from Franklin to Somerset County, Pennsylvania, and there George Hitler, father of our subject, was born on September 27, 1798. In the year following the family emigrated to Ohio. In those days such a journey was equal in adventure and anxious expectation to one which the traveler now plans around the globe. It is a matter of record that the Hitler wagon, which contained the family and their most cherished possessions, was the second one to enter the Scioto Valley. The country was but sparsely settled, the present busy city of Chillicothe being then represented by only a couple of log houses. Mr. Hitler settled for a time in rich bottom lands which proved wonderfully fertile but were subject to overflow, and it was not until 1804 that he located permanently in Washington township, Pickaway County, in which township both he and his wife died.\n\nIn 1819 George and Jacob Hitler, brothers, and sons of the above named pioneer, bought a quarter section of land in the southern part of Washington township and for many years they raised wheat here, ground it and shipped it in flatboats to New Orleans, the first trip being made by Jacob Hitler in 1819. During the succeeding to years the brothers carried on a profitable business. In its operation the brothers displayed excellent business faculty and superior judgment. The result of this and other business ventures made them both wealthy men. George Hitler acquired 1,000 acres of land. He was noted for his honesty and integrity and for the interest he took in all that pertained to the welfare of his family, his community and his State. He survived until 1884.\n\nGeorge W. Hitler, subject of this sketch, remained at home until he reached his majority, assisting his father on the home farm and in the meantime securing a fair district school education. After his marriage, in 1878, he took charge of the farm of 157 acres, and until 1890 he made it his home. In 1890 he erected his fine residence at Circleville. He is considered one of Pickaway County's substantial men in every sense of the word.\n\nIn 1878 Mr. Hitler was married to Ida Lutz, who was born in Circleville township, Pickaway County, Ohio, and is a daughter of Eli Lutz and a granddaughter of Jacob Lutz, who came to Pickaway County as a pioneer from Pennsylvania. Mrs. Hitler died April\n\nAND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS - 653\n\n6, 1892, survived by three children, viz.: I Bertha, Gay L. and Mary. Bertha is the wife of Gilbert Teegardin, a pharmacist of Circleville: they have one daughter--Evelyn.\n\nGay L. Hitler, the only surviving son of George W. Hitler, was born in Circleville township, Pickaway County, Ohio, in 1882. He was educated at Circleville and graduated at the Everts High School in 1901, spent 1901-02 at Kenyon College and then entered the dental department of the University of Cincinnati. He was graduated there in 1905, with his degree of D. D. S., and after several months of practice at Bucyrus, settled at Circleville, in October, 1905. On November 3, 1905, Dr. Hitler was married to Mabel Long, who is a (laughter of L. M. Long, of Circleville. The Doctor retains his fraternity memberships at college and university, still belonging to the Beta Theta Phi, at Kenyon College, and the Delta Sigma Delta, at the University of Cincinnati. He is also a member of the Elks.\n\nTHOMAS MONTGOMERY, owner of a good farm of 83 acres in Walnut township, is one of the old, substantial residents of his section of the county. He was born in Perry County, Ohio, April 1, 1845, and is a son of Rev. Joshua and Susan (Tanner) Montgomery, both natives of Maryland, who there reached mature years and were married. Later Rev. Joshua Montgomery and his wife came to Perry County, Ohio, and subsequently became residents of Pickaway County. In 1861 they settled in Pickaway township, but the following year moved into Walnut township. Mr. Montgomery was one of the best known clergymen of the United Brethren denomination in Ohio, his pastorate taking him into all parts of the State. He died in Franklin County, Ohio, in 1872, having moved thither in 1865; his wife survived him about eight years.\n\nThomas Montgomery has been self-supporting since he was nine years of age. Since early boyhood he has depended solely upon himself for advancement, and his continuousprogress and present independence are therefore all the more commendable. Since 1862 he has been a resident of Walnut township, with the exception of that period in his youth when he went to the front in the service of the Union. In 1885 he visited Oregon. California and other Western States, and in 1886 he took a trip to Washington, D. C., and visited Baltimore and the famous battleground of Gettysburg. He has never married and now rents the farm upon which he lives and which he purchased of Clayton Weaver in 1902.\n\nNOAH WOOLEVER, who owns a valuable farm of 228 acres in Pickaway township, was born in Laurel town-ship, Hocking County, Ohio, May 16, 1846, and is a son of John and Sarah (Rush) Woolever.\n\nJohn Woolever was born in Warren County, New Jersey, and his father, Philip Woolever, was also born there, of German parentage. John Woolever married Sarah Rush, who was born and reared in Warren County, New Jersey, in which State her grandparents. who were natives of Germany, had settled prior to the Revolutionary War. In 1837 John Woolever and wife came to Hocking County, Ohio, accompanied by Mr. Woolever's aged father,. and their daughter, Catherine. John Woolever entered 120 acres of land and on this homestead our subject was born, the fifth child in a family of 12. Nine of these reached maturity and eight still survive, Noah being the eldest of these. Both parents died in Hocking County.\n\nNoah Woolever was 17 years old when he left the home farm in the fall of 1863. He went to work for a distant cousin, who was a resident .of Pickaway County, and remained on the latter's farm until 1865, when he returned to Hocking County and the home farm. One year later he married and then settled on his father-in-law's plate, on which he farmed for three years. In 1869 he returned to Pickaway township, taking the Simon Holderman farm, on which he lived for two years and then\n\n654 -HISTORY OF PICKAWAY COUNTY\n\nmoved to Circleville township and spent 18 years operating either the Jacob Valentine or the John C. Weaver farms.\n\nIn 1896 Mr. Woolever purchased a farm of 140 acres in Pickaway township and moved upon it and in 1903 he purchased 88 acres more. This property Mr. Woolever continued to improve as long as he resided upon it, making additions to the house, adding farm buildings, etc.., and putting the land under a fine state of cultivation. On March 1, 1906, he purchased six acres of improved land in Circleville township and took possession of his new home on April 18. It is a very desirable tract and. includes a good orchard and a commodious frame residence and barn.\n\nOn November 6, 1866, in Hocking County, Mr. Woolever was married to Mary A. Souders, a daughter of Noah Souders. She died in Pickaway township, July 5, 1905. She was the beloved mother of the following children : Clara B., who resides with her father; Cora Lucetta, who married F. M. Shook, of Urbana, Ohio, and has five children; Elsworth G., residing in Cleveland, who travels for the United States Biscuit Company; Hattie A., who married C. B. Shook, of Columbus and has three children; Mattie, who married Scott Scothorn, resides in Ashville and has four children ; and Effie L., who married T. M. Glick, and .with her husband resides on the farm in Pickaway township owned by Mr. Woolever. Mr. Woolever is a member of the Mystic Circle. He is a man who made his own way iii the world and secured independence and a competency through his own industry and good management. He is a highly respected citizen.\n\nJOSEPH S. SMITH, president of the Ohio Cereal Company, of Circleville, a stockholder in the Third National Bank and one of the leading stockmen in this section of the State, was born at Circleville, in 1861, and is a son of Edward Smith, who was one of the early settlers and extensive farmers of Pickaway County, coming here at an early day from Canada with his parents.\n\nMr. Smith was educated at Circleville and at the University of Notre Dame, where he remained four years. Upon his return home, he assisted his father until he became a farmer and stock-raiser on his own account, residing meanwhile at home. He then became a member of the firm of J. S. Smith & Brothers, in the manufacture of corn meal. In 1893-94 the company built a mill for the manufacture of flour and meal and handled all kinds of grain and feed. This enterprise was carried on under the business style of the Smith. Mill Company until it was consolidated with the milling concern known as the Crites Brothers Company, the new company being incorporated under the name of the Ohio Cereal Company. Joseph S. Smith became the president of this new company, which is one-of the prospering concerns of Circleville.\n\nWith his two brothers, Mr. Smith forms the Ideal Stock Food Company, which manufactures the \"Ideal\" stock and poultry condition powders from a formula invented by Mr. Smith. It is, as its name indicates, an ideal remedy, originated by Mr. Smith through his long years of practical experience in the raising of fine blooded horses. He is connected with the Third National Bank of Circleville and .he owns one of the finest and best-stocked farms in Pickaway County. It contains 600 acres and is largely devoted to the breeding of fine trotting horses and thoroughbred Shorthorn cattle. He bred \"Sunnyside,\" an animal which has a record of 2:15. His fine stallion \"Wiltwood,\" has a record of 2 :29 1/2 ; he is a son of \"Wilton,\" whose record is 2:19 1/4. A disastrous fire burned two of his finest barns and in the conflagration 18 of his finest horses perished. His stock is known for its excellence all over the State and many of his animals have distinguished themselves on the track.\n\nIn 1890 Mr. Smith was married to Mary M. Corcoran, who is a daughter of Thomas Corcoran, who was superintendent of the Sunday Creek and the Congo coal companies. Mr. and Mrs. Smith .have the following children : Mary (a student at St. Mary's, Shepard, Ohio), Edward L., Sarah E., Margaret I., Thomas Paul, Frances Louise and Rose Victoria. The family belong to St. Joseph's Catholic Church.\n\nAND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS - 655\n\nABRAHAM JEFFERSON WILLIAMS, one of the large owners of land and extensive farmers and stock-raisers of Pickaway County, resides on a tract of 400 acres, which is about. evenly divided by the Jackson and Muhlenberg township line and is situated on the Florence Chapel turnpike. He was born in Marion County, Ohio, April 23, 1850, and is a son of Abraham Jefferson Williams and a grandson of David Williams.\n\nDavid Williams was born in Virginia and in young manhood removed to Franklin County, Ohio, where he subsequently died. That farm is now owned by Henry Williams, who is a cousin of our subject, and a son of Benjamin Williams.\n\nAbraham Jefferson Williams, father of our subject, was born in Franklin County, Ohio, June 11, 1812, and lived there until after he was married and his two oldest children were born, when he moved to Marion County, where he died September 15, 1849, a few months before the birth of our subject. He owned 826 acres of land in Marion township, all in one body and in addition had 85 acres in timber. His family still own 826 acres in Marion County. He married Emma Trimble, who was born at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and died May 24. 1852, in Marion County, at the age of 39 years. During a visit at Chillicothe, she met Mr. Williams and they were married shortly afterward. Her parents were Robert and Maria Thimble. There were children born to this union, namely: Maria, born March 8, 1840, in Franklin County, who married Ira Uhler, a merchant at Marion, where he died June 6, 1891, survived by his widow and three sons and one daughter; Margaret, born in Franklin County, November 28, 1843, who is now a widow residing at Myerstown, Pennsylvania--one of her two children is living; Mary E., born November 26, 1846, who resides with her brother; Sarah Elizabeth, born in Marion County, October 21, 1848, who re-sides also in the old home with her brother; and Abraham Jefferson.\n\nAbraham J. Williams was two years old when he became an orphan, and, with his two sisters,. Mary E. and Sarah Elizabeth, were brought to the present farm by an uncle and aunt, Felix and Mary (Williams) Renick. The uncle died October 29, 1883, aged 70 years, 10 months and 23 days, leaving this fine estate to the three children, he and his wife owning the farm jointly and having no children of their own. Mr. Renick and brother had bought the farm in partnership and Felix Renick's wife had later purchased his brother's interest. It is one of the fine estates of this locality, one generously endowed by Nature, fertile and watered by Darby Creek, which bounds it on the south and west. Mr. Williams devotes the whole of his time and attention to farming and stock-raising.\n\nMr. Williams has been a Republican all his life. He is a member and one of the trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Jackson township, which is located within a mile and a quarter of his home. With his sisters he is universally respected and esteemed throughout the neighborhood. All are single and have a wide and pleasant social circle.\n\nR. G. McCOY, president of the Esmeralda Canning Company, of Circleville, and president and treasurer of the McCoy Canning Company, of Urbana, Ohio, is very prominently identified with the business interests of Pickaway County. He was born in Ross County, Ohio, in 1851.\n\nMr. McCoy was reared in Ross County and was educated in the common schools. He continued to reside on a farm there until 1884, when he came to Jackson township, Pickaway County, and rented the Turney farm for a period of 15 years. At the end of 12 years he moved to Circleville, but he continued to operate the farm for three years longer.\n\nMr. McCoy is a man of business enterprise He was one of the organizers and purchasers, with Mrs. Turney and J. M. Dunlap, of the business of the C. E. Sears Canning Company, which they operated until 1903, when Mr. McCoy sold his interest. In the spring of 1904\n\n656 - HISTORY OF PICKAWAY COUNTY\n\nthe Esmeralda Canning Company was organized and incorporated, under the laws of the State of Ohio, with a capital stock of $100,000, with R. G. McCoy as president ; James I. Smith as vice-president; Edward E. Smith as treasurer and Boyd Trout as secretary. The company built a fine plant for the canning of corn and tomatoes, with a capacity to turn out 150,000 cases or 300,000 dozen cans each season. In the year just passed the cannery was run to its full capacity. The company raises from one-half to two-thirds of their vegetables and the business is conducted on lines which insure the utmost excellence in all their output. Mr. McCoy organized the McCoy Canning Company at Urbana, Ohio, with a capital stock of $100,000 and he is president and treasurer of the same. The plant is run under the same sanitary conditions as the one at Circleville and the products are their own advertisements. Mr. McCoy continues his interest in farming.\n\nIn 1876 Mr. McCoy was married to Emma F. Richhart, of Ross County, Ohio. They are members of the Presbyterian Church at Circleville.\n\nFRED C. CLARK, who is coroner of Pickaway County and also conducts an undertaking business at Circleville, was born at Cincinnati, Ohio, but was only a child when his parents removed to Columbus, where he was reared.\n\nAfter completing the high school course at Columbus, Mr. Clark then studied the art and science of embalming for four years, his instructor being Dr. Carl L. Barnes: Then for two years Mr. Clark followed railroading on the Norfolk & Western Railway, after which he was employed as bookkeeper for one year by the Anti-Saloon League. From this position he went into the employ of Richard E. Jones, a very prominent undertaker and assisted him as embalmer for seven years:\n\nOn August 23, 1900, Mr. Clark came to Circleville and became associated with the undertaking house of H. H. Albaugh. In 1902 he was elected coroner of Pickaway County by a majority of 1,300 votes, receiving more than any other candidate on the ticket. Again, in 1904, he led the ticket and has continued to fill the office ever since. He is a member of the Ohio State embalmers examining board and holds license No. 1044 as a practicing embalmer in the State of Ohio.\n\nFraternally Mr. Clark is an Elk, an Odd Fellow and a member of the Daughters of Rebekah. Socially he is prominent in the Circleville Athletic Club. He belongs to the Presbyterian Church.\n\nELIJAH DELONG, one of the representative and substantial citizens of Salt Creek township, who resides on a finely-developed farm of 103 1/2 acres--the old pioneer homestead--located in section 35, belongs to a family which came to. this section when forests covered a .great part of it and Indians were still numerous. Mr. Delong was born on this farm, on April 16, 1844, and is a son of Isaac and Catherine (Haynes) Delong.\n\nIt is probable that the Delong family originated in France and possibly its first settlers in America belonged to that great body of Huguenot refugees, who later became thoroughly American and from whom have come many useful and distinguished citizens. Andrew Delong, the grandfather of our subject, was born in Pennsylvania and removed to Ohio in 1830, settling on the farm which is now occupied by his grandson, Elijah. Isaac Delong, father of Elijah, was 17 years of age at the time of. the removal to Ohio; and spent the rest of his life here, dying May 2, 1887, .in his 73rd year. He took an active part in the township's agricultural development and was a worthy and highly respected citizen. He belonged to the Reformed Church and subscribed to its rules of life. He married Catherine Haynes, who lived until July' 20, 1903, being then in her 90th year. Of their six children, the survivors are : Leah, wife of George Withrow, of Polk County, Missouri; Elijah, of this sketch; Susan, wife of Samuel Karshner, of Hocking County, Ohio; and Jane, wife\n\nPAGE 656 - BLANK\n\nPAGE 657 - PICTURE OF EDWARD TIFFIN TOOTLE\n\nAND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS - 659\n\nof John Hoffman, of Livingston County, Missouri. The mother of this family belonged to the Lutheran Church and lived to be one of its oldest members in this section.\n\nElijah Delong has devoted the larger part of his life to general farming and stock-raising, since he completed his schooling in the schools of Salt Creek township. With the exception of about 12 years spent in Piatt County, Illinois, during three years of which he was a county commissioner and 11 years a school trustee, Mr. Delong has spent his life on the old homestead. In addition to this farm of 103 1/2 acres, he owns l00 acres in Ross County, 80 acres of this having been entered from the government by his grandfather, Andrew Delong, in 1830.\n\nIn 1866 Mr. Delong was married (first) to Dillie Wiggins, of Hocking County, Ohio, and two of their four children still survive, viz.: Nelson, of Hocking County, and Nina, wife of Thomas Mettler, of Laurelville, Ohio. In August, 1896, Mr. Delong was married (second) to Lillie Lutz, who is a daughter of George and Sarah E. (Critz) Lutz, and a granddaughter of the late Hon. Samuel Lutz, a pioneer and prominent citizen of Salt Creek township.\n\nGeorge Lutz, father of Mrs. Delong, is a well-known farmer and stock-raiser, whose farm is located in section 34, Salt Creek township. He was born in Salt Creek township, April 26, 1831, and is a son of Samuel and Elizabeth (Fetherolf) Lutz, and a grandson of Jacob Lutz, the founder of the family in Ohio. Samuel Lutz was born in 'Pennsylvania and was 14 years old when he accompanied his father to Salt Creek township, among the very earliest settlers. He was one of the early surveyors and did a great deal in this line in Pickaway and other counties. He laid out the town of McArthur, the county seat of Vinton County. His death occurred some years ago. He was a worthy member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church at Whisler. In his young manhood he served as a soldier in the War of 1812 and in middle life was elected several times as a member of the Ohio State Legislature. He reached the unusual age of 102 years. On June 7, 1855, George Lutz married Sarah E. Critz, who was a daughter of the late John S. Critz, who was a well-known justice of the peace and prominent citizen of Salt Creek township, and Mrs. Delong is a daughter of this marriage.\n\nMr. Delong and wife both belong to the Reformed Church, in which he has been a deacon for many years. He is an upright, honest, public-spirited citizen who commands the respect and enjoys the esteem and confidence of a large body of his fellow-citizens.\n\nEDWARD TIFFIN TOOTLE, one of the largest landowners and most prosperous farmers of the county, whose portrait accompanies this sketch, has resided on his homestead in Wayne township for a period of 35 years. His family estate in this township now consists of 465 acres; the remainder of the 700 acres of which he is owner lies in Deerfield and South Union townships, Ross County. The land is in two distinct farms--one in Pickaway and the other in Ross County. The home place has been in the possession of the Tootle family since 1857.\n\nThe old Tootle farm in Ross County is about seven miles southwest of the present home of our subject, and was settled by the grandfather, Thomas B. Tootle, who migrated from Maryland in 1805. He was accompanied by his father, Thomas Tootle, his mother and his younger brothers-- John, Stewart and James. The father entered the land which is still held in the name of Edward Tiffin Tootle, but Thomas B., the eldest son, increased and improved it and became one of the wealthy and influential farmers of this section of the State. The great-great-grandfather of our subject, Nathan Tootle, came from England and settled in Maryland. He fought with the patriots in the Revolutionary War.\n\nJohn, the second son of Thomas Tootle, did not become well known in Ohio, but traveled overland to Missouri while it was yet a frontier State of the great Western plains, es-\n\n660 - HISTORY OF PICKAWAY COUNTY\n\ntablished a trading post, became a millionaire and died at St. Joseph. In that old, conservative, wealthy city many of his descendants still reside, now the owners of banks and mines and numbered among the affluent people of the place. Stewart, the third son, was a farmer in Ross County, where he married. He also removed to Missouri, but after his departure from Ohio, in 1850, all trace of him and his was lost. James, the fourth son of the family, lived out his life of single blessedness in Ross County, where he died at an advanced age.\n\nThomas B. Tootle, the oldest son, and the grandfather of our subject, married Mary Ann Rector, daughter of Spencer Rector. Her mother was Mary Tiffin,. a sister of Edwin Tiffin, the first Governor of the State of Ohio; it is from this distinguished family that Edward Tiffin Tootle derives his middle name. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas B. Tootle had the following children: John ; James, the father of Edward T.; Isaac and Amos. Thomas B. Tootle was a soldier in the War of 1812.\n\nJames Tootle, the father, was born in Ross County, Ohio, August 11, 1814; was reared and educated in that county, and married Mary Clarkson, daughter of Major Clarkson, who served in the War of 1812--\"Major\" was his given name. Five children were born to Mr. and Mrs. James Tootle, namely : Milton Jackson, who resides in Monroe township; Edward Tiffin, the subject of this sketch; Eliza, the only daughter, residing on a farm in Ross County, who is the widow of Stewart Morrow ; Monroe, who resided in Ross County, married, raised a family and died at the age of about 40 years--his widow still lives in that county; and Douglas, who is married and lives in Ross County.\n\nEdward T. Tootle, our immediate subject, is a native of Ross County, this State, where he was born June 10, 1842. There he was educated. and reached manhood, and in that county, also, he married Sarah Belle Fulton, immediately commencing domestic life on the farm which is still his homestead: At that time the land was nearly' all covered with timber and very wet--almost a swamp--its only improvement being a rough, round-log cabin of one room. Mr. Tootle cleared the timber from the land, drained it with thousands of rods of tile and transformed the log house into a comfortable dwelling, it being now one of the best frame residences in the township. In 1891, especially, he made many improvements, so that now his family enjoy all the modern conveniences of country life. The five children born to Mr. and Mrs. Edward T. Tootle are all living, and are as follows : Leroy; Martha; Bessie, who married Robert Parrett, a farmer residing near Greenfield, Ross County, and has two children--Elizabeth and Margaret; Mary and James R. The mother of the family died in 1883.\n\nBesides superintending his extensive farming and landed interests with energy and ability, Mr. Tootle has for many years been prominent in the conduct of township affairs. He has been particularly interested in educational matters, having continuously served upon the Board of Education since 1886. He has also been a justice of the peace for two terms, or a period of six years, and at various times has filled the office of township trustee. In politics he is a Democrat. In Masonry, Mr. Tootle is .a Knight Templar, and altogether is a citizen of high standing and unassailable character.\n\nOSCAR ELLSWORTH BUMGARNER, who is engaged in stock-raising and dairying in Harrison township; was born September 24, 1865, in Pike County, Ohio, and is a son of Joseph and Mary Bumgarner.\n\nJoseph Bumgarner, who was born and reared in Pike County, was a son of Abraham and Jane Bumgarner, who were natives of Ohio and residents of Pike County. Joseph Bumgarner, was a farmer all his life and died in the fall of 1903 at the age of 65 years. His wife, the mother of our subject, died in 1894, aged 51 years.\n\nMr. Bumgarner was reared on his father's farm in Pike County and received a common-school education. He lived for three years\n\nAND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS - 661\n\nin Wayne County, Iowa, whither his parents moved, and then returned to Pike County. Mr. Bumgarner has always been engaged in agricultural pursuits. In the spring of 1895 he moved to the Zwicker farm on Lover's Lane near Circleville, where he resided for one year. In 1896 he moved to the James H. Valentine farm of about 125 acres, two miles north of Ashville in Harrison township, which he has since been engaged in operating. He is especially interested in stock-raising and dairying. He keeps 13 head of horses and from 10 to 12 milch cows.\n\nMr. Bumgarner was married in the fall of 1892 to Kate Vogel, a daughter of Martin Vogel, of Pike County, Ohio. Four children have blessed their union, namely : Walter O., Dorsey L., Albert Harold and Orville E., all of whom are living at home.\n\nS. H. EVANS. For many years the late S. H. Evans was one of the prominent farmers and highly respected citizens of Pickaway township. He belonged to one of the old pioneer families of this section which increased and flourished in that favored part of the Scioto Valley known as the Pickaway Plains. There he was born in 1859.\n\nMr. Evans enjoyed educational advantages in his native locality, in the schools at Circleville and later in a business college at Columbus. His life was mainly devoted to agricultural pursuits and his death took place on the homestead farm of 300 acres, in 1894. This farm is one of the best improved farms and one of the most valuable on the Pickaway Plains.\n\nMr. Evans was married in 1886 to Alice Niles, daughter of O. E. Niles, who is one of the most prominent pioneer citizens of Circleville. Mrs. Evans still survives and resides on her beautiful farm in Pickaway township.\n\nMr. Evans stood very high in public esteem. In all important matters concerning the township his will and judgment were always more or less consulted and his death was a distinct loss to his family and community.\n\nJOHN HIATT, who owns and operates a valuable farm of 73 acres in Salt Creek township, in the vicinity of Tarlton, is one of the reliable, representative citizens of this section. He was born in Hocking County, Ohio, February 19, 1839, and is a son of Ezra and Mary (Poling) Hiatt.\n\nIn Hocking County the Hiatt family is a well-known one, having been settled there for several generations. The paternal grandmother of our subject was a very remarkable woman. She had been educated in Eastern schools, was capable and became a perfect type of a brave, efficient pioneer woman in what was then the far west. Her memory and that of many events of her long life which extended almost over a century, is preserved by the families of other old settlers of that county, who learned to know her value in the hardships and sometimes the tragedies which fell upon pioneer neighborhoods.\n\nUntil he was 17 years old, John Hiatt lived in Hocking County, where he obtained his education in the district schools. He then came to Pickaway County and followed farming until the outbreak of the Civil War. On July 17, 1861, Mr. Hiatt enlisted in Company A, 27th Reg., Ohio Vol. Inf., which became a part of the Western Army, operating at that time in Missouri. On November 6, 1861, Mr. Hiatt was made a prisoner, in Jackson County, Missouri.

Mr. Hiatt engaged in farming and stock-raising for about 18 years. In 1884 he returned to Pickaway County, and, with the exception of a very short period of residence in Ross County, has resided ever since in Salt Creek township. In addition to his good farm, he has other real estate, and, although an entirely self-made man, is one of the substantial and successful ones of this section of the county.\n\nMr. Hiatt is a member of Groce Post G. A. R., at Circleville, where the memorable days of the Civil War are frequently recalled by those who were participants. In political sentiment he is a Republican. For many years he has been a worthy member of the Methodist Episcopal Church and is a trustee and a class leader in the church at Tarlton.\n\nANDREW METZGER, president of the Board of County Commissioners, of Pickaway County, is one of the leading farmers and stock-raisers of this section and owns a large and productive farm in Wayne township. \" He was born in Pickaway County, in 1841, and is a son of Benjamin and Mary (Zeimer) Metzger.\n\nJohn Metzger, the paternal grandfather of Mr. Metzger, came from Pennsylvania at a very early day and settled in Washington township, Pickaway County, Ohio, where the family has been prominent for many years as agriculturists. The father of our subject, was born in Washington township in 18o8 and died in June, 1868.\n\nAndrew Metzger was reared and educated in Washington township, where he continued to live until 1875, when he took up his residence in Wayne township, where he has been prominent both as a farmer and stock-raiser, and also in political life. For some 20 years he served as trustee of Wayne township and in the fall of 1902 he was chosen a member of the Board of County. Commissioners. Public approval of his services was shown when he was reelected to the office in 1905 and made president of the board. He is a very well known man and commands the respect and confidence of his fellow-citizens.\n\nOn February 27, 1873, Mr. Metzger was married to Mary Elizabeth Haswell, a daughter of Joseph Haswell, who was an old settler of Pickaway County. Mr. and Mrs. Metzger have two children living, viz.: Benjamin, engaged in farming in Jackson township, who married Stella Adkins and has two children--Esta and Walter; and Joseph, a farmer in Wayne township, who married Leota Zurmely, and has one son--Andrew. William, the second son of our subject, was born in 1876 and died in 1887.\n\nJOHN WESLEY LANE, a leading citizen and prosperous farmer of Scioto township, residing one and a half miles west of Commercial Point on his valuable farm of 105 acres, was born June 25, 1861, in the vicinity of his present home, and is a son of James M. and Lucinda (Wheeler) Lane.\n\nJohn Wesley Lane, the paternal grandfather, whose honored name our subject bears, was born in Virginia and there married Sarah. McCord. Both families crossed the mountains in covered wagons and came to the vicinity of Commercial Point, being among the very early pioneers in this section. The grandparents lived to be 88 years of age.\n\nJohn Wesley Lane is one of a family of eight children born to his parents, namely : Benjamin Franklin, deceased; John W., of this sketch; Emma Jane, wife of James R. Borror, of Franklin County ; James Edwin, a resident of Toronto, Canada; William A., deceased; and Horatio Nelson.\n\nFor the past 15 years Mr. Lane has resided upon his present farm, which was improved when he purchased it. It was formerly known as the Coontz farm. He carries on general farming and dairying, keeping a large herd of Jersey cows and selling his milk and butter at Columbus. Since leaving school, he has been continuously engaged in agricultural pursuits and is ranked with the township's most successful men.\n\nAND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS - 663\n\nMr. Lane was married on December 27, 1883, to Sarah F. Peterson, who is a daughter of Thomas and Caroline Peterson, the former of whom was born in Franklin and the latter in Pickaway County. They have two sons and four daughters, viz.: Lucy May and Leah Blanche who were educated in the township schools; Pearl Marie, Carrie Wanda, Horace M. and John Lawrence, all at home.\n\nMr. Lane, like his father and grandfather, has always been identified with the Democratic party. He served two years as township assessor and then declined to serve longer. For a number of years he has been a member of the School Board, both under the old and the new law. He is an honorable, upright man and a representative citizen of his township and community. The family belong to the Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nCHARLES T. NEFF, who is known as an expert horseshoer and who has conducted a general black-smithing business at Darbyville for the past six years, was born in Darby township, Pickaway County, Ohio, August 28, 1871, and is a son of Nathaniel and Samantha (Thornton) Neff.\n\nThe grandparents of our subject were George Enoch and Pauline Neff, who came to Darby township, Pickaway County, at a very early day, about 1845, and lived and died in Darby township. They had seven children, Nathaniel being the third in order of birth. He was reared and married in Darby township, but in 1878 moved to Muhlenberg township. He and his wife still reside on their farm near Pherson.\n\nThe children of Nathaniel and Samantha Neff were: William, of Monroe township; Charles T., of this sketch; Homer, of Monroe township; Laura, wife of Willard Whiteside, of Darby township ; Elmer, of Monroe township; and George, who is still in school.\n\nCharles T. Neff was seven years old when his parents settled in Muhlenberg township. He remained at home, assisting on the farmand attending school until he was 17 years old, when he went to Pherson and learned the blacksmith's trade with J. J. McLaughlin, with whom he remained at work for 11 years, being his employer's right hand man. He then started into business for himself at Darbyville and enjoys a large trade. He owns his home and his shop and is looked upon as one of the town's successful business men.\n\nOn February 27, 1896, Mr. Neff was united in marriage with Mary Kern, who was born in Deerfield township, Ross County, Ohio, and is a daughter of Philip and Magdalene Kern, the former of whom was born in Germany and the latter in Ohio. The four children born to Mr. and Mrs. Neff are: Charles K., Philip, Maria M. and Francis E. The family belong to the Lutheran Church at Lick Run.\n\nPolitically Mr. Neff is a Republican and the esteem and confidence with which he is regarded by his fellow-citizens has been shown by his election as a member of the Village Council and as a member of the School Board.\n\nCOL. SAMUEL ASBURY MOORE was born in Circleville, Pickaway County, Ohio, November 1, 1816, and died October 3, 1902, on the same lot where he was born 86 years before. William Moore, his father, had purchased the land from which the town was platted in 181o, six years previous to Colonel Moore's birth. Few people live to the age of 86 with all their faculties practically unimpaired, and fewer still at that age enter the final darkness from the very locality where they first saw the light of earth.\n\nAs the town was only six years his senior, Colonel Moore and Circleville were children together. At an early age he became an important part of its life, doing much, and in many ways, to assist its growth and healthful prosperity. He was engaged in various mercantile pursuits, and for two terms served as clerk of the courts of Pickaway County. It was while in the service of the county that he\n\n664 - HISTORY OF PICKAWAY COUNTY\n\nclaimed to have learned his accurate business methods, for which he was noted and which were a primary source of his success in life.\n\nIn 1839 Colonel Moore was married to Harriet Melissa Short, by whom he had a son and a daughter. His first wife died in 1842, and in 1843 he was united to Harriet Maria Doane. They became the parents of four sons and one daughter, and in 1874 the second Mrs. Moore died, four of her children having preceded her. In 1885, their last child, Edward Doane Moore, also passed to the great beyond.\n\nColonel Moore was not only the most prominent and public-spirited citizen of Circleville, but one of the most active and enterprising men of Pickaway County--universally respected, honored and admired, and by intimate association inspiring a deep feeling of affection and love. After passing the meridian of life and, from a successful business career, amply providing for the wants of old age, he retired from the world's activities and devoted himself to such reading and recreation as gratified his good taste and pleased his sound judgment. His well selected library attested to the broadness of his studies and the thorough cultivation of his mind.\n\nIn politics Colonel Moore was either Whig or Republican. At the time of his death he was the oldest subscriber to the Union Herald, formerly the Olive Branch, the oldest Republican newspaper in the county. Before the Civil War he was an Abolitionist, and many colored slaves, fleeing from their Southern masters to Canada, were helped along the \"Underground Railroad\" by his good advice and better money. And his treatment of the black fugitive was in line with his attitude toward his home community. He was a good talker --even a brilliant conversationalist-- and his advice was given and highly valued ; but his assistance did not end at this stage. He gave of his time, his energies and his substance, in the furtherance of enterprises which promised to advance the community in material or moral life. He therefore touched men on all sides, and also many kinds of men, with the result that all classes of the community, besides the immediate circle of his friends, felt that his death was a personal and a permanent bereavement.\n\nEDWARD DOANE MOORE, D. D. S., was born in Circleville, this county, and was here reared and educated. After graduating from its High School, he was for some time a student at Kenyon College, and later pursued a course in a Philadelphia dental college from which he obtained his degree of D. D. S. It was in the '60's that he returned to Circleville to practice his profession, associating himself for that purpose with Dr. E. C. Clarke.\n\nIn 1869 Dr. Edward Doane Moore was married to Fannie M. Stribling, a daughter of Dr. Magnus Stribling, and afterwards located at Eureka, Kansas, where, besides establishing a lucrative professional business, he engaged in banking. After a residence of about two years there, on account of the age of his father, Colonel Moore, he returned to Circleville to look after the latter's business interests. Among the enterprises which he owned and conducted from that time until his death in 1885 was the artificial gas plant.\n\nDr. and Mrs. Edward Doane Moore were the parents of three children : Archie Moore, who died when a small child, while they were residents of Kansas; Mabel Rose, the wife of Percy A. Walling, an attorney of Circleville and the son of Ansel T. Walling, ex-Congressman from this district; and Howard B. Moore, also a lawyer of this city.\n\nHOWARD BENFORD MOORE, LL. B., is a native of Circleville, where he was born in the year 1876. He was reared in the city, passed through its common and high schools, and graduated from Hobart College, Geneva, New York, with the degree A. B. Leaving that institution. in 1899, he entered Harvard Law School, where, in 1902, he obtained his degree of Bachelor of Laws. For more than a year thereafter he was engaged in the practice of his profession at Knoxville, Tennessee. On account of ill health he then returned to Circleville, where he has since successfully continued his professional work, besides holding the position of secretary of the Circleville Light & Power Company.\n\nMr. Moore is an influential Republican of\n\nAND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS - 665\n\nhis section of the county, and at the last election was the candidate of his party for the office of prosecuting attorney. Fraternally he is a member of the Elks, and a Kappa Alpha, of Hobart College. He is also actively identified with the work of St. Philip's Protestant Episcopal Church, of which he is a member of the board of vestrymen and secretary.\n\nHARVEY REICHELDERFER, whose well-cultivated farm of 143 acres is situated in Salt Creek township, was born in this township, April 4, 1852, and is a son of Joseph and Sarah (Mowery) Reichelderfer.\n\nThe Reichelderfer family was established in Pickaway County, Ohio, by Joseph Reichelderfer, the grandfather, who brought his family from Berks County, Pennsylvania. He was one of the early settlers of Salt Creek township, where the rest of his life was spent. His son, also named Joseph Reichelderfer, the father of our subject, was born in Berks County, Pennsylvania, and was seven years old when he accompanied his parents to Salt Creek township, where he grew to manhood and assisted his father in developing the pioneer farm. Both were men of substantial character, exemplary in life and honorable in all business transactions. They were members of the German Lutheran Church. The children of Joseph and Sarah (Mowery) Reichelderfer were seven in number, and of these four survive, namely : Harvey; Eli, of Salt Creek township, whose sketch appears else-where in this work; Sarah E., wife of Otis Harman, of Salt Creek township; and Mary J., wife of Joseph Crawford, of Nodaway County, Missouri.\n\nHarvey Reichelderfer was reared on his father's farm and obtained his education in -the district schools of Salt Creek township. With thorough home training, he developed into an excellent fanner and has devoted the greater part of his life to agriculture. His farm is managed carefully and intelligently and each year sees it under a little better state of cultivation and with added improvements.\n\nOn October 10, 1876, Mr. Reichelderfer was married to Flora B. Clendening, who was born in Fairfield County, Ohio, and is a daughter of Joseph Clendening, now a resident of Salt Creek township. The children born to this marriage were : Mary M., Bertha (deceased), Nellie G., Earl E. and Olive B.\n\nPolitically Mr. Reichelderfer has always been an adherent of the Democratic party. As one of the responsible, intelligent men of his community, he has been frequently elected school director of District No. 3 and has performed the duties of the office to the best interests of all concerned. His judgment is often consulted in township affairs. He belongs to the United Evangelical Association and has been a trustee of Pleasant View Church. Mrs. Reichelderfer is a member of the Dresbach United Brethren Church, as are all of the children. The whole family is one for which friendship and esteem is entertained throughout their neighborhood.\n\nFRED LEWIS ALBRIGHT, one of the leading citizens and representative farmers of Monroe township, who owns a magnificent farm of 36o acres of rich land here, was born in Mecklenberg, Germany, and is a son of John and Mary Albright.\n\nThe life history of Mr. Albright is as interesting as a story of fiction. It began in a little German village which belonged to one of the large landowners of that section of the country, in which his peasant parents lived as had their parents before them, happy and contented. It is very probable that when they learned that their son had an ambition to leave the confines of his native hamlet, that their parental fears saw only his ultimate ruin. The time came, however, when they not only felt satisfied with what he had done in his youth, but were happy to join him in his prosperity, far from their old home, and in their old age were cared for and provided for by his filial bounty. The father died in 1895 and the mother two years later.\n\nMr. Albright was not the only child born\n\n666 - HISTORY OF PICKAWAY COUNTY\n\nto his parents, nor the only one to come to America. Lena, born in Germany, was there married to John Bagro, with whom she came to Ohio, where he died; she now lives at Columbus. Anna married John Martin, in America, and lives at Columbus. Augusta married Valentine Brigold and they live in Missouri. Rebecca married Joseph Long and they live at Columbus. Minnie married Frank Debold and they live on a farm near New Holland in Pickaway County.\n\nAs intimated, Fred Lewis Albright was born of poor parents and had no future to look to except what he could provide for himself. He was industrious and as soon as he was able to work found employment with neighboring farmers who tilled small farms and were not able to pay very much for the assistance they received. In the local schools the youth was afforded an excellent education in his own language, a gift every German boy receives from his government, and probably because he was more intelligent than many of his companions he was more ambitious. For a long time he had entertained a determination to leave Germany and seek his fortune across the Atlantic. His opportunity came about the time of the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, when he was 19 years of age. He enlisted the sympathy of an uncle who lent him enough money to pay his passage to America, and one night he slipped away from the sleeping little village and started, alone and but poorly equipped, to take his chances with thousands of other emigrants entering the United States.\n\nThat Mr. Albright should have succeeded so well when he had so much to contend with, is nothing less than remarkable. When he landed in New York, in November, 1871, he could speak no English and but a small portion of his borrowed capital remained. He had heard that there were many Germans settled at Columbus. Ohio, and he made that city his objective point and arrived, tired, footsore, and hungry, at the Snyder House, Columbus, on Saturday night, December 7, 1871. He had just five cents in his pocket. The proprietor of the hostelry was a German and he kindly took care of his young countryman until Monday morning and then encouraged him to start out through Pickaway County and seek work with the farmers. This advice Mr. Albright followed and on the second day was employed by Peter Hall, a farmer of Madison township. He remained with this worthy farmer for four years or more and then went into business for himself, renting a farm from a Mr. Conklin, which he operated for three years.\n\nIn the meantime the young German's thrift and industry had brought about results. Some of the first money he earned he sent to his father and mother to provide for their passage to this country. They joined him in 1875 and the mother kept house for him for some 10 years. Later he rented the David Brobst farm. After living on this place for five years, he married, after which he continued to reside on the farm for five more years. In 1888 he rented his present farm which was then owned by John Schook, and after operating it for four years purchased it in 1892.\n\nWhen Mr. Albright first came to his farm lie found a log house here which he repaired so that it served as a home for the family until 1903, when he built what is one of the finest, most complete modern homes in all the rural regions of Pickaway County. It is substantially constructed of seasoned timbers, contains 15 rooms, has hot and cold water throughout and is lighted by 21 acetylene gas lights. A cement cellar extends under the whole of the house. Mr. Albright spent fully $4,000 in the building of this beautiful home, and he has equipped it with everything to make it comfortable. In order to accommodate his crops and herds, his stock and machinery, Mr. Albright has provided a great deal of barn room and has built a new barn every year since he completed his fine house, having more barn space for the acreage than any other farmer in the county.\n\nMr. Albright at present writing has l00 acres devoted to grass, 100 to corn and over 100 to wheat. To give plenty of space to his stock, he has a pasture of 50 acres. He raises thoroughbred horses, cattle and hogs. He owns some imported horses, one in particular for which he paid at the rate of $1 per pound.\n\nPAGE 667 - BLANK\n\nPAGE 668 - MR AND MRS JOHN H. SARK AND FAMILY\n\nAND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS - 669\n\nIn the raising of stock as in everything else he does, Mr. Albright is thorough. He has always believed that what was worth doing at all was worth doing well. He has never spared himself, having worked hard from the time he landed in Pickaway County, and naturally is of the opinion that persistent industry, combined with perfect honesty, will be pretty certain to bring about satisfactory results. He did not receive much encouragement from those who wished him well when he first purchased his present farm, but his foresight proved better than theirs. His farm is now considered the finest land in Monroe township and if put on the market would command the highest price. He has every reason to be proud of his success since he became an American citizen. One of his first cares was to relieve himself from the debt he owed his uncle, along with the filial treatment of his parents as noted above, and in subsequent business transactions he has always sustained his reputation for unblemished integrity.\n\nIn 1885 Mr. Albright was married to Adda Longenbaugh, who is a daughter of Enos and Samantha (Allen) (Glick) Longenbaugh, the Longenbaugh family having been established in Ohio by immigrants from Pennsylvania. Mrs. Albright's parents were born in Pickaway County and now reside at Ashville, where the father is a blacksmith. The children of Mr. and Mrs. Longenbaugh were : Emma, now deceased, who was the wife of Elmer Brinker; Edward, deceased at the age of 23 years; Lula, deceased at the age of 14 years; and Adda (Mrs. Albright), who was born August 2o, 1865.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Albright have two children, viz.: Grace, born in September, 1886; and John, born October 3, 1888.\n\nMr. Albright has never been a very active politician, but has always taken a great deal of interest in educational matters and in all movements relating to local improvements. He is now serving as one of the directors of his school district. The road along which he. lives was named for him on account of the vigorous fight he made to have it put through ; it is one of the most traveled highways in the township and one of the greatest conveniences the farmers enjoy. Mr. Albright has been a Mason for many years and has attained to the rank of Knight Templar. Few citizens of the western section of Pickaway County are better known or more thoroughly respected than he.\n\nJOHN H. SARK. one of Walnut township's representative farmers, residing on his valuable farm of 121 acres, situated in section 17. Walnut township, was born in Circleville township. Pickaway County, Ohio, April 27, 1863, and is a son of Isaac and Mary (Marburger) Sark. The paternal grandfather of our subject was born in England and died in Berks County, Pennsylvania.\n\nIsaac Sark was born in Berks County, Pennsylvania, and came in young manhood to Pickaway County. Later he married Mary Marburger, who was also born in Berks County. Pennsylvania, and was a daughter of George Marburger, a native of Berks County, Pennsylvania, who walked from Pennsylvania to Fairfield County, Ohio, located land in Amanda township and there died at the remarkable age of 101 years and six months. Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Sark had a family of five children born to them, the eldest of whom died in infancy. The four children that grew to maturity are as follows : John H.; Samuel M., superintendent of the schools of Darby township, who married Mary B. Thomas ; William, of Scioto township, who married Julia Burton ; and Charles, of Walnut township, who married Florence Martin. After the death of Isaac Sark, his widow married George A. Kashner, a resident of Circleville.\n\nJohn H. Sark was taken to Indiana in childhood and lived there for some 18 months and. then was brought back to Walnut township. He was educated in the schools of districts 1 and 4, and spent two winters at St. Paul, Madison township. This completed his educational opportunities, His life has always been an agricultural one. For the first eight years of individual effort, he received only his board and clothes. In the meantime, however, he had\n\n670 - HISTORY OF PICKAWAY COUNTY\n\nbecome a practical farmer and when he was ready to purchase land of his own he had saved the capital and possessed the judgment to secure good farming property. In 1892 he bought 90 acres of William Peters and in March, 1905, he added 31 acres, purchased of Josiah Ward. In addition to operating his own land, he rents 290 acres of James Ward. He bears the reputation of being one of the careful and successful farmers of his locality. He is a self-made man in every essential, having honestly earned through industry all he possesses. Neither inheritance nor speculation have had anything to do with his accumulation of a competency or with his securing the esteem and confidence of his fellow citizens.\n\nMr. Sark was married in 1886 to Ann Markwood, a daughter of James Markwood, and they have six children, namely : Claude, Clara, Arthur, Leonard, Howard and Guy. Mr. Sark is giving his children all the advantages in his power, these being far in excess of those of his own youth. A group picture of the Sark family accompanies this sketch.\n\nPolitically Mr. Sark is a Republican and is a member of the executive party organization in Walnut township. While ever ready to further the political aspirations of his friends, he has never consented to hold office himself. He belongs to the Grange, having joined this body in 1881, when but 18 years of age, and he has always been interested in its work. For 16 years he has been a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and belongs to the affiliated society known as Daughters of Rebekah. He is a Mason and belongs to the Circleville Commandery. Mr. Sark also enjoys membership in the Knights of Pythias and the Modern Woodmen of America.\n\nCHARLES EDGAR BLAKELEY, owner and proprietor of the only undertaking establishment in Ashville, was born at Quincy, Logan County, Ohio, on October 7, 1878, and is a son of George Henry and Elizabeth (Berdett) (Patton) Blakeley. He is of Scotch-Irish descent. His paternal grandparentscame from the North of Ireland early in the last century.\n\nGeorge Henry Blakeley was born October 10, 1851, in Franklin County, Ohio, but spent the greater part of his life in Logan County, and is at present a resident of Columbus, Ohio. His wife was born December 5, 1844 and died December 19, 1882. They had two children : Charles Edgar, of this sketch; and William Henry, born February 9, 1882, who is a resident of Columbus, Ohio.\n\nCharles E. Blakeley attended the public schools of. Columbus, Ohio, leaving when 17 years old to enter the undertaking establishment of John J. Mank, a funeral director of Columbus. He afterwards went to work for H. A.

M., at Circleville, and of Palmetto Lodge, Knights of Pythias, at Ashville.\n\nAMOS DUNKEL, a prominent farmer and representative citizen of Pickaway County, who owns a valuable farm of 294 acres of fertile land in Washington and' Circleville townships, was born September 25, 1827, in what was then Washington but is now Circleville township. His parents were Jacob and Mary (Markel) Dunkel, both natives of Berks County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Dunkel family in Ohio dates back to 1802, at which. time John Dunkel, the. grand-\n\nAND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS - 671\n\nfather of Amos Dunkel, entered land in Pickaway County, being a resident then of Pennsylvania. He proposed to settle on this land but the illness of his father prevented and he remained in Pennsylvania until the War of 1812, in which he took part. After its settlement in 1815, John Dunkel came to his land, bringing with him his son Jacob, who was then a boy of 15 years, his birth having taken place in Pennsylvania,. February 28, 1800. John Dunkel settled in Salt Creek township but did not live long enough to develop the land he had owned so many years. He was buried in Salt Creek township.\n\nJacob Dunkel was married in Salt Creek township, Pickaway County, to Mary Markel and then removed to Washington township, now Circleville township, and here he lived until his death in 1881. He was a well-known and respected citizen. His wife died in 1861.\n\nAmos Dunkel was reared in his native country and was educated in the district schools. He was trained to be a practical farmer and agricultural pursuits have claimed his attention all his life. After his marriage in 1852, he moved to his farm in the eastern part of Washington township, which was (then the property of his father-in-law, Isaac Stout. He lived on that place for four years and then moved on a farm in Circleville township now occupied by his son, where he remained for 23 years. In 1879 he moved to his present farm in section 16, Washington township. His land is thus divided : One farm, of 184 acres, on which he lives, is in section 16, Washington township; another farm of 51 acres, is situated on the east side of the township, on the county line; and a third tract, of 60 acres, is situated in Circleville township. Mr. Dunkel has taken a great deal of pride in his fine properties and has put valuable improvements on them. Almost all the old buildings have been removed and a commodious frame house and substantial barn and other buildings have taken their place. This is one of the representative homes of the locality, where thrift and good management are apparent.\n\nIn 1852 Mr. Dunkel was married to Catherine Stout, daughter of Isaac Stout, and they have had 10 children, viz.: Isaac, who resides with his family on his father's Circleville township farm; Malinda, who resides at home; Mary, who married Allen Boyer and lives on the farm owned by Mr. Dunkel in Washington township; William, who died aged three years ; Amos, who lives with his family on the farm on which his father was born ; Abraham, who died in infancy; Thomas, who lives on his farm of 84 acres in Allen County, Indiana; and Catherine, who married Lewis Hann and lives in Circleville.\n\nMr. Dunkel has been a life-long Democrat but he has never been anxious for office, consenting, however, to serve one term as trustee of Washington township. He is one of the most highly respected men of the locality.\n\nGEORGE W.

The grandfather, Bernhard Gephart, died a short time prior to the migration of the family to Pickaway County, which was before the year 1825. The American genealogy of the family antedates the Revolution, many of its members being identified with that historic period. They were both industrious and patriotic, the two traits being inseparable in those times when the struggle for independence was so largely dependent on the faithfulness of individual exertion, and when the sloth of the community was its deadly enemy. At an early day various members of the family settled in the Old Dominion, and for many years prior to 1825 Bernhard Gephart was a stockman and a distiller at Martinsburg, Berkeley County, Virginia (now West Virginia). He married Sarah Faulk and they became the parents of the following children -- Abram, George, Emanuel, John, David, Catherine, Betsy (Hargrave), Nancy (Sunderman), Susan and Ann Maria (neither of whom married), and Rebecca (Ellsworth).\n\nOf the above family of 11 children, only Abram, the oldest, came to Deer Creek township, Pickaway County, Abram Gephart, with his family located in Circleville prior to 1825 and a few years after the town had been platted. Being a carpenter by trade he found employment from the first, and lived and labored in Circleville until near his death in 1857, at the age of 53 years. About six months before his decease, he settled on a farm in Deer Creek township. The immediate cause of his death was convulsions brought on by drinking water while overheated.\n\nMrs. Abram Gephart, the mother of our subject, was born on the day that Circleville was laid out--September 10, 1810. Valentine Keller, her father, was the owner of a section of land now included in the site of the town, and his father-in-law owned an adjoining section. For many years Mr. Keffer was not only extensively interested in the real estate of the locality but wielded a strong influence in the public legislation of his section, serving with great credit in the State Legislature for a period of 20 years. Mr. and Mrs. Abram Gephart were the parents of the following four children : Martha Ann, who died after having reached years of maturity; Charles Wesley; George W.; and Mary F., who married Wesley Hayes--both are now deceased.\n\nGeorge W. Gephart was 13 years of age when his father came to Deer Creek township, where he passed the last few months of his life. The boy continued to reside upon the family homestead for the remainder of the year following his father's death, when he decided to do a man's work in the world, and bound himself to a neighboring farmer until he should reach his majority. But the outbreak of the Civil War disarranged his plans, as it did those of a nation, and in November, 1861, he enlisted in Company E, 73rd Reg., Ohio Vol. Inf. Until after the battle of Gettysburg his regiment was attached to the Army of the Potomac. Besides Gettysburg he participated in the first battle of Bull Run, Cedar Mountain, Chancellorsville and Fredericksburg. Mr. Gephart was wounded at Gettysburg and confined to the hospital until ,the first of the following year. On account of his injuries and long confinement, he was unable thereafter to do field duty, and until his term of enlistment expired was chiefly engaged in guarding prisoners of war.\n\nAfter being honorably discharged from military service, Mr. Gephart returned to this\n\nAND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS - 673\n\ncounty, and, after being variously employed for two years, rented a farm. Subsequently he purchased a tract of land near Darbyville, and after selling this, in 1877, he purchased the 86 acres in Deer Creek township, which has since been the family homestead. It has been thoroughly improved and cultivated, in every respect, and its location is especially favorable, as three sides of the tract are bounded by pikes. Mr. Gephart as an agriculturist has confined himself to general farming, but he has taken a creditable part in township affairs, having been trustee for a number of years and having held other local offices.\n\nIn March, 1870, George W. Gephart was married to Nancy Buzick, a native of this county and a daughter of William and Ellen (Beall) Buzick, her father being a resident of Monroe township. Mr. and Mrs. Gephart have had five children, as follows : Charles W., residing in Deer Creek township, who married Lydia Tarbill and has one child--Elmer Irving; Edward E., a resident of Ross County, who married Emma Henry and has two children--Mabel Edna and Everett Henry; William F., a graduate of Ohio Northern University and the Ohio State University, who married Theo May Walston and for a number of years has been engaged in teaching; Thomas Benton, also a teacher, and George C., the two last named living at home.\n\nMr. Gephart is a stanch member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, having served as trustee in the local body. Fraternally he is identified with Heber Lodge, No. 501, F. & A. M., and in politics holds an independent attitude. In a word, he is a man descended from good, industrious pioneer stock and now stands as a patriot, a worthy husband and father, and a moral and useful member of the community in which he has so long upheld an honorable name.\n\nFLOYD S. GARDNER, one of Whisler's most highly esteemed residents, and an honored survivor of the Civil War, owns a valuable farm of 40 acres in Salt Creek township, Pickaway County.

For many years he engaged as a carpenter and building contractor and erected many of the residences and barns which still stand as evidences of his honest work through . Pickaway and adjacent counties. On May 2, 1864, he enlisted as a private for service in the Civil War, entering Company K, 155th Reg., Ohio Vol. Inf., in answer to the call for 100-day volunteers.

The young patriot served under Sherman and Thomas, and participated in the siege of Atlanta, being discharged at Hilton Head Island, about 70 miles off the South Carolina coast, opposite Charleston. He received his final papers of honorable discharge from the service at Columbus.\n\nOne of the most signal services which Mr. Peters performed for the government was in connection with the capture of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy. He is the only man in Pickaway County who is identified with that historic episode. He is one of 33 soldiers. from Ohio who succeeded in entering the Rebel lines during the Civil War. Dressed as a Confederate soldier, he entered the lines of the enemy and spent 12 days getting information as a spy. Although he expected nothing for his services, beyond the valued thanks of his superiors, in consideration of the dangerous character of his mission and its value in effecting the capture he received $293 as his share of the reward.\n\nAfter the war, Mr. Peters returned to Walnut township and settled on the farm which his parents had bought while he was, at the front and which he still occupies. He was first married, October 28, 1868, to Emma Swope, of Fairfield County, by whom he had two children; Anna, who became the wife of Oliver Waddell and lives in Fayette County, this State; and Alice, who married George Barr, of Fairfield County, and has three children--Robert, Albert and Anna.

He is a member of the old-school Baptist Church, the pulpit of which he has repeatedly occupied within the past 20 years. A group picture of the Peters family accompanies this sketch.\n\nCAPT. MARCUS B. RADCLIFFE, a representative agriculturist of Pickaway township, who is also an honored veteran of the Civil War, owns a fine farm of 400 acres, which is most excellently improved. He was born in Deer Creek township, Pickaway County, Ohio, January 10, 1840, and is a son ,of Benjamin and Sarah (Florence) Radcliffe.\n\nBenjamin Radcliffe, the father, was born in 1794, in Kentucky, and died in 1869, in Pickaway County, Ohio. He accompanied his widowed mother and the other members of the family to Ohio in 18o6, a home being established in Muhlenberg township, Pickaway County.

He married Sarah Florence, who was born in Virginia, and their three surviving children are: John, who is a resident of Washington Court House, Ohio; Matilda B., who resides at Southwest City, Missouri, the widow of the late Dr. B. F. Smith, of Southwest City, but formerly of Williamsport, Ohio; and Marcus B.\n\nMarcus B. Radcliffe was reared on his father's farm and was educated in the public schools of Deer Creek township. The opening of the Civil War brought a new element into the life of this farmer boy as it did to others and the second year of the war found him a private in Company A, 114th Reg., Ohio Vol. Inf., ready to risk his life in the service of his country. His promotion was rapid, won by valorous deeds and personal bravery through the Vicksburg campaign, the Red River campaign and through Texas and Western Louisiana. He first served as sergeant, then as 2nd lieutenant, next as 1st lieutenant and finally, in December, 1864, shortly before he was honorably discharged, was commissioned captain of Company A by Governor David Tod. All of his service was in this company. Although exposed to dangers of every kind and taking part in all the most hazardous undertakings of his regiment, as shown by his promotions, he was able to return to his home, practically uninjured.\n\nAfter his return to peaceful pursuits, Mr. Radcliffe resumed farming in Pickaway County. On July 29, 1869, he was united in marriage with Lizzie Crouse, who was born in Ross County, Ohio, December 25, 1840, and is a daughter of Nelson and Sophia (Wilson) Crouse.\n\nNelson Crouse was born November 14, 1808, in Ross County, Ohio, where the family had settled at an early day. His father, Hon. David Crouse, represented Ross County in the State Legislature for two terms and was also a man of business prominence. It. was David Crouse who established the first paper manufacturing mill in this section, locating it six miles north of Chillicothe. Nelson Crouse died September 4, 1848. He had served as county commissioner of Pickaway County and it was during his service that the old Court House was built. Mrs. Crouse was born in Pennsylvania and died in Pickaway County, August 26, 1886. Mrs. Radcliffe was three months old when she was brought to Picka-\n\nAND REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS - 681\n\nway County and her father settled on the farm which is now her home.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Radcliffe have two children, viz.: Eva T., who is the wife of Frank R. Cox, of Lancaster, Ohio, and Frank C., of Pickaway township. The latter served in the Spanish-American War, with the rank of sergeant-major in the Fourth Regiment, Ohio Infantry, U. S. Volunteers, in Puerto Rico, adding to the family's military laurels.\n\nFor many years Mr. Radcliffe has commanded the respect and enjoyed the esteem of the veterans making up John H. Groce Post, No. 156, G. A. R., at Circleville and he has been a most useful member. He is the only surviving member of the Loyal Legion, in Pickaway County, and he belongs also to the soldiers' relief committee. Another philanthropic object has long claimed his attention, the Children's Home, of Pickaway County, of which he is a trustee. He belongs to the fraternal orders of Odd Fellows and Knights of Pythias.. Both he and his wife are members of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nWILLIAM GILL, who resides on the fine old farm in Salt Creek township, on which he was born, on November 8, 1832, has been identified with the agricultural interests of this section all his life. His parents were Hon. William and Nancy (Winship) Gill.\n\nThe Gill family is of old Virginia stock and Scotch-Irish extraction. H. William Gill, our subject's father, was born in Virginia, possibly about 1798. He was an officer in the War of 1812 and *as captain of a company which was entrusted with the escort of a party of British prisoners to Chillicothe, from the frontier. It was during this trip that he first met the lady who later became his wife--Nancy Winship. She was a daughter of Winn Winship, who entered a large- body of land from the government, and embodied in this tract was the farm on which our subject was born and which he still occupies. After marriage, about 1817, William Gill settled in what is now Salt Creek township and here the larger portion of his subsequent life was passed. He became a very prominent man in both township and county, and served for many years in the office of justice of the peace and for a protracted period was associate judge of Pickaway County and was always given the title of \"Judge.\" A few years before his demise, he moved to Circleville, where his long and useful life came to a close on January 29, 1861. He was a stanch Democrat of the old school and on many occasions was proffered the support of his party for offices of great responsibility. His three children were : William,. of this sketch; Winn W., deceased; and Martha, deceased, who was the wife of John T. Jacobs.\n\nWilliam Gill was reared on the old homestead and his education was secured in the public schools of Salt Creek township and at an academy at Kingston. His choice of occupation being farming, he remained on the family estate, which contains 295 acres. It is all under an excellent state of cultivation and he is classed among the best farmers of the southeastern section of the county.\n\nMr. Gill was married March 23, 1854, to Lucy Cushing, who was born in Kentucky, and is a daughter of Henry Cushing, who was a native of Massachusetts. The Cushing family is one of age and distinction in New England. A branch settled very early in Ohio and, there is reason to believe that Varnum Cushing, an uncle of Mrs. Gill, was the second white child. born in the State. Varnum Cushing long resided in Zanesville. Henry Cushing was an early settler in Pickaway County, but died in Clermont County.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Gill have had six children, namely : Martha, wife of L. C. McPherson, of Allegheny, Pennsylvania ; Anna B., at home; Mary W., wife of Lemuel C. Steely, of Pickaway township; William H., of Cincinnati ; Alice, of Columbus ; and George, at home.\n\nMr. Gill has been a lifelong Democrat but has never been willing to accept the cares of office.
