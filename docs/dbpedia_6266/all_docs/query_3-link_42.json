        "text": "Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-12) this week was presented the William Monroe Trotter Award by the Woodrow Wilson Center. The William Monroe Trotter Leadership Award was established by the Wilson Center to symbolically reject Wilson’s legacy of racism and segregation, and to recognize the critical role that African Americans have played in foreign policy and national security of the United States.\n\n“I am deeply honored to be the recipient of an award named after William Monroe Trotter. Monroe Trotter was many things. A scholar. A journalist. An activist. But above all else, Monroe Trotter was known as a fighter. A descendent of those enslaved at Monticello, he spent his life fighting the systems of power that kept Black people oppressed, and he never, never backed down from advocating for the principle of basic equality and human dignity, here at home or around the world,\" said Congresswoman Lee. \" It is never too soon and never too late to do what is right. It is not too late to ensure our foreign policy and the public servants who execute it are part of a legacy worthy of Monroe Trotter and all the civil rights fighters who devoted themselves to a more just future for our nation. I am grateful for the work that the Wilson Center, continues to do to support human rights everywhere.\"\n\n\"William Monroe Trotter's life and legacy help us remember the full history of our country. He overcame barriers and fought to make the ideals of our Nation a reality—not just for some but for all. Like its namesake, this award recognizes pioneers of change and champions of justice,\" wrote Vice President Kamala Harris. \"[...]Congresswoman Lee, thank you for your dedication to advancing racial justice and advocating for underserved communities. I am grateful for your commitment to equity and tireless efforts to build a brighter future for generations to come.\"\n\nFor full text of VP Harris' letter, click here.\n\nThe William Monroe Trotter Leadership Award was established by the Wilson Center to recognize the critical role that African Americans have played in the formulation, implementation, and analysis of United States foreign policy and national security. It is named after William Monroe Trotter (1872 – 1934), a graduate of Harvard University, civil rights leader, editor of the Boston-based Guardian newspaper, and co-founder of the Niagara Movement (a precursor to the NAACP). In 1914 Trotter famously confronted President Woodrow Wilson over his administration’s policies that expanded segregation of the federal civil service. Until his death in 1934, Trotter also campaigned against the film Birth of a Nation, fought for the equal treatment of African American soldiers, presented demands for civil rights in France after World War I, and fought for federal anti-lynching legislation.\n\nL-R: Representative Jim Clyburn (SC-6), Representative Barbara Lee (CA-12)"
