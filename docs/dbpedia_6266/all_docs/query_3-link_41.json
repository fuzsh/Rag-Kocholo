        "text": "Letitia Hemings Monroe, born abt 1806\n\nJames Hemings Monroe Trotter was so named by his mother for a reason; and we suspect her reasoning was that she was descended from President James Monroe. In those days, long before the modern welfare generations toward nothingness, ... mothers held dear their \"hope chests\" they were \"somebody\" and names mattered in choosing one for children. It is almost inconceivable that Sarah (Sally) Hemings, her sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles and cousins at Monticello, ... would not know or disclose to Madison and his siblings and cousins the existence of Thenia Hemings.\n\nContrary to means and methods described by most historians, slaves in the ante-bellum south were not uncaring about \"the least of us\" in distant locations, ... including Africa and Mississippi where tens of thousands of slaves in Virginia had known relatives \"sold down river where the cotton was high and life never easy\" ... excepting in a Al Jolson song fest.\n\nAl Jolson and hundreds of other Black and White entertainers were able to profit from the well-known antidotes and popularity of Black minstrels on the Mississippi and Ohio River boats. Many of them, especially Louis Armstrong were legendary even during their lifetimes,\n\n... including Bill Robinson (a Virginia born Robinson) in their ability to entertain crowds with dance and song and get paid to do so. But, down river before New Orleans situated majestically at the mouth of the river, ... very few of the ex-slaves and sons and daughters of ex-slaves were living happily in the Mississippi River Delta. There is no record of Al Jolson, the Gershwin brothers or others who wrote and sang about it, ... ever spent a day or night there.\n\nWhatever the case might have been, the below extract from Wikipedia differs from our speculation that James Monroe was descended from Thenia Hemings, went to Ross and Pike Counties Ohio because he had relatives there, and met and married Virginia Isaacs who was one of those distant cousins. In fact, throughout most of the 19th century, it was not at all uncommon for Black or White 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th cousins to marry rather than risk of mating with complete strangers.\n\nMany slaves in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi had for at least two generations sought to learn about their relatives back in Virginia, ... where living was tough but cotton was not king and masters far less greedy and not likely to work men and women to their deaths.\n\nMany of the Virginia born slaves sold to ruthless planters in the rich black soil of the Mississippi delta, ... did not survive the march there nor the brutal conditions often imposed by White masters often migrated from Virginia. It is a chapter in Virginia's cultural history often ignored. Without Virginia, ... there would not have been much of what occurred from the loins of many Virginians like Robert E. Lee who claimed otherwise.\n\nIndeed, the Randolph children at Monticello had relatives in Mississippi and other states that visited often, played and talked to Hemings offspring. And, even the great man himself in pillow talk with Sally Hemings would no doubt have given her an honest answer about the where-abouts of her sister Thenia. Most historians have chose to believe that African-American names follow no pattern excepting that after slavery ended most chose to use names of their slave masters to establish their identity.\n\nAnd, such may have been true in certain parts of the south where cowardly, old and feeble slaves remained; but, those leaving bondage prior to and during the Civil War had no such illusions about who they were. They almost certainly knew who their mother's said fathers were, good or bad.\n\nThe issue for us is that so many young men like James, and fewer mothers such as Letitia were obviously not inferior type human beings depicted in Uncle Tom's Cabin, ... but rather of superior human behavior by any modern measure."
