        "text": "Historic African American Civil Rights Timeline: Civil War and Aftermath\n\nMay 16-18, 1860\n\nRepublican Party holds its nominating convention in Chicago. It nominates Abraham Lincoln as its presidential candidate. The Party platform opposes the future expansion of slavery into the new western territories.[1]\n\nNovember 6, 1860\n\nAbraham Lincoln is elected the Sixteenth President of the United States, Hannibal Hamlin, Vice President. They are elected from the Republican Party. They receive 1,866,452 votes and win in 17 of 33 states. Lincoln is elected President by a minority of only 40% of the popular vote.[2]\n\nDecember 4, 1860\n\nPresident James Buchanan gives report on the State of the Union. About the abolition of slavery, he states, “The long-continued and intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of slavery in the Southern states has at length produced its natural effects.” He counsels against secession by declaring “The election of any one of our fellow-citizens to the office of President does not of itself afford just cause for dissolving the Union.”[3]\n\nDecember 10, 1860\n\nPresident-Elect Lincoln writes, “Let there be no compromise on the question of extending slavery. If there be, all our labor is lost, and, ere long, must be done again… The tug has to come & better now, than any time hereafter.”[4]\n\nDecember 22, 1860\n\nLincoln writes to Alexander H. Stephens, the future vice-president of the Confederacy: “You think slavery is right and ought to be extended; while we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted. That I suppose is the rub. It certainly is the only substantial difference between us.”[5]\n\n1861\n\nA slave girl, Harriet Jacobs, publishes influential slave narrative, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.\n\nJanuary 12, 1861\n\nAn amendment protecting slavery is adopted in the Congress. It fails, however, to be ratified by the states. Senator Seward of New York says, in speech before the Senate, “The alarm is appalling; for the Union is not more the body than liberty is the soul of the nation… A continuance…”[6]\n\nFebruary 1, 1861\n\nThe state of Texas votes in the capital in Austin, 166 to 7, to leave the Union.[7]\n\nPresident elect Lincoln writes to Secretary of State designate Seward. He refuses to compromise on the extension of slavery into the territories: “I say now, however, as I have all the while said, that on the territorial question---that is, the question of extending slavery under the national auspices,---I am inflexible. I am for no compromise which assists or permits the extension of the institution on soil owned by the nation. And any trick by which the nation is to acquire territory, and then allow some local authority to spread slavery over it, is as obnoxious as any other. / I take it that to effect some such result as this, and to put us again on the high-road to a slave empire is the object of all these proposed compromises. I am against it.”[8]\n\nFebruary 4-9, 1861\n\nSeven of the southern states that seceded meet in Montgomery, Alabama, and adopt provisional confederate constitution on February 9. They elect Senator Jefferson Davis as provisional president.[9]\n\nFebruary 18, 1861\n\nJefferson Davis describes slavery as “necessary to self-preservation” in his inaugural address as President of the Confederacy.[10]\n\nMarch 1861\n\nThe vice president of the Confederacy, Alexander Stephens, states that his government “rested upon the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man, that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is a natural and normal condition… our new Government, is the first in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.”\n\nMarch 2, 1861\n\nThe United States Congress passes a proposed constitutional amendment that the U.S. government would not “abolish or interfere…with the domestic institutions” of the states. This amendment is not ratified.[11]\n\nMarch 4, 1861\n\nAbraham Lincoln is inaugurated, in Washington City, as President of the United States. He states, in his inaugural address, “I hold, that in contemplation of universal law, and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual. …It follows from these views that no State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union,--that resolves and ordnances to that effect are legally void;… I therefore consider that in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken; and, to the extent of my ability, I shall take care,… that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States. … In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority. … One section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended. … I have no purpose… to interfere with the institution of slavery… In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you. You can have no conflict, without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to ‘preserve, protect and defend’ it.”[12]\n\nApril 12, 1861\n\nStart of the Civil War in the United States. Confederate Army begins the shelling of the U.S. Army garrison at Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina.\n\nApril 15, 1861\n\nLincoln calls for 75,000 troops to enlist for three months. Black men who seek to volunteer for the Union Army are turned back.[13]\n\nApril 17, 1861\n\nGeneral Benjamin F. Butler is replaced as commander of the Union Department of Virginia, headquartered at Fortress Monroe.[14]\n\nMay 22, 1861\n\nUnion General Benjamin F. Butler assumes command of Fortress Monroe on the James River in Virginia, near Norfolk.[15]\n\nMay 23, 1861\n\nThree enslaved individuals escape to Fortress Monroe. Butler gives them sanctuary and refuses to return them to their owners. He refuses to abide by the Federal Fugitive Slave Act. Butler asserts that it did not apply because it “did not affect a foreign country, which Virginia claimed to be.”[16]\n\nVirginia votes three to one to approve secession from the Union.[17]\n\nMay 24, 1861\n\nUnion General Benjamin F. Butler declares fugitive slaves to be “contraband of war.” Fugitive slaves who escape to Fort Monroe, Virginia, are put to work for the Union.[18]\n\nFederal troops enter and occupy Alexandria, Virginia.[19]\n\nMay 27, 1861\n\nForty-seven escaped slaves arrive at Fortress Monroe. They call it “Freedom Fort.” General Butler puts them to work. He requests a decision from Washington regarding his actions. Lincoln approves of General Butler’s policy, calling it “Butler’s fugitive slave law.”[20]\n\nJune 4, 1861\n\nSouthern newspapers recommend that slaves be utilized in Confederate fortification, in lieu of state volunteer forces.[21]\n\nJuly 22, 1861\n\nThe Union is shocked over its defeat at Bull Run. Major General George B. McClellan is given command of the Army.[22]\n\nThe United States Senate declares that the war was being fought “to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and to preserve the Union,” and that “this war is not waged… for any purpose… of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions… [of the] southern states.” Congress thus declares that the principle war aim is to preserve the Union. Lincoln supports the resolution. It passes the House 117 to 2, and the Senate, on July 25, 30 to July 23, 1864\n\nThe Louisiana State Constitutional Convention adopts measure that will abolish slavery in the state.[23]\n\nJuly 30, 1861\n\nMore than 850 enslaved individual escape to Fortress Monroe.[24]\n\nGeneral Benjamin Butler seeks to declare escaped slaves freed. He writes to Secretary of War Cameron, “In a loyal State I would put down a servile insurrection. In a state of rebellion I would confiscate that which was used to oppose my arms, and take all that property, which constituted the wealth of that State, and furnished the means by which the war is prosecuted, besides being the cause of the war; and if, in so doing, it should be objected that human beings were brought to the free enjoyment of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, such objection might not require much consideration.”[25]\n\nAugust 1861\n\nDaniel R. Goodloe, an abolitionist and correspondent for the New York Times, writes Emancipation and the War: Compensation Essential to Peace and Civilization.[26]\n\nAugust 6, 1861\n\nThe U.S. Congress passes the First Confiscation Act. This act authorizes the freeing of slaves in areas of Union Army occupation and where slaves have been employed to support the Confederate military.[27]\n\nAugust 8, 1861\n\nSecretary of War Simeon Cameron writes General Butler regarding federal policy toward returning slaves who have entered Union lines. Butler determines that escaped slaves from Confederate states would not be returned.[28]\n\nAugust 16, 1861\n\nLincoln declares that the people of the Confederate states “are in a state of insurrection against the United States, and that all commercial intercourse” between Union and Confederates states is illegal.[29]\n\nAugust 30, 1861\n\nMajor General John C. Frémont invokes martial law within his military command in Missouri. Further, he issues a proclamation that frees slaves within his military jurisdiction. He confiscates the property of “those who shall take up arms against the United States” and declares that “their slaves, if any they have, are hereby declared free men.” Northern abolitionists support the order. He has no authorization to issue these orders. On September 11, Lincoln overrules his decisions. Frémont refuses to comply, and is ordered by the President to nullify his orders. Frémont is then reassigned.[30]\n\nSeptember 2, 1861\n\nPresident Lincoln requests that General Frémont “modify” his emancipation proclamation of August 30, 1861. Lincoln declares it “will alarm our Southern Union friends, and turn them against us—perhaps ruin our rather fair prospects for Kentucky.”[31] Lincoln is fearful of losing Kentucky to the Confederacy.\n\nSeptember 10, 1861\n\nMrs. John C. Frémont meets with President Lincoln in order to persuade him to support General Frémont’s emancipation and confiscation proclamation of August 30.[32]\n\nSeptember 17, 1861\n\nAn old friend of Lincoln, Orville H. Browning, writes to the President regarding his approval of General John C. Frémont’s proclamation freeing enslaved individuals in his jurisdiction in Missouri. He writes that the proclamation had “the unqualified approval of every true friend of the Government … I do not know of an exception.”[33]\n\nSeptember 22, 1861\n\nPresident Lincoln replies to Orville H. Browning letter of September 17, 1861. Lincoln explains his lack of support for General Frémont’s action regarding freeing of enslaved individuals in his department. Lincoln writes, “Yours of the 17th is just received; and coming from you, I confess it astonishes me. That you should object to my adhering to a law, which you had assisted in making, and presenting to me, less than a month before, is odd enough. But this is a very small part. Genl. Fremont's proclamation, as to confiscation of property, and the liberation of slaves, is purely political, and not within the range of military law, or necessity.”[34] Lincoln further explains that to support Frémont’s order would jeopardize Kentucky and Missouri loyalty to the Union. He states: “I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game. Kentucky gone, we can not hold Missouri, nor, as I think, Maryland. These all against us, and the job on our hands is too large for us. We would as well consent to separation at once, including the surrender of this capitol.”[35]\n\nSeptember 23, 1861\n\nJohn L. Scripps, a Lincoln biographer, writes the President, “‘This nation cannot endure part slave and part free.’ … To you sir has been accorded a higher privilege than was ever before vouchsafed to man. The success of free institutions rests with you. The destiny not alone of four millions of enslaved men and women, but of the great American people … is committed to your keeping. You must either make yourself the great central figure of our American history for all time to come, or your name will go down to posterity as one who … proved himself unequal to the grand trust.”[36]\n\nSeptember 25, 1861\n\nSecretary of the Navy, Gideon Wells, authorizes the enlistment of Black slaves into the U.S. Navy.\n\nOctober 1, 1861\n\nSenator Charles Sumner declares his support for emancipation of enslaved individuals at a state Republican convention.[37]\n\nOctober 14, 1861\n\nTo prevent subversion of the Union cause, President Lincoln authorizes General Winfield Scott to suspend the right of writ of habeas corpus between Bangor, Maine, and Washington, DC.[38]\n\nNovember 1861\n\nPresident Lincoln proposes plan for gradual, compensated emancipation of slaves in Delaware, which would be supported by the federal government. Lincoln drafts two bills to be entered into the state legislature. The bills, however, are not introduced. Slavery remains in Delaware until the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in December 1865.[39]\n\nNovember 2, 1861\n\nMajor General John C. Frémont is removed from his command of the Western Department. Major General Hunter is placed in temporary command.[40]\n\nNovember 6, 1861\n\nJefferson Davis is elected without opposition as President of the Confederate States. Members of the Confederate Congress are also selected.[41]\n\nNovember 15, 1861\n\nHistorian George Bancroft writes President Lincoln that “Divine Providence” caused the war to “root out social slavery.” Lincoln writes back that it “does not escape my attention, and with which I must deal in all due caution, and with the best judgment I can bring to it.”[42]\n\nNovember 28, 1861\n\nFederal authorities order the confiscation of all crops in Port Royal Sound area. Formerly enslaved individuals are to be utilized in harvesting them and to work on Union Army installations and defensive works.[43]\n\nThe North celebrates a Day of Thanksgiving.[44]\n\nDecember 1861\n\nPetitions, resolutions and bills to abolish slavery in states “in rebellion” are introduced into the United States Congress. Thomas Eliot, of Massachusetts, submits a resolution asking Lincoln, under the War Powers provision of the Constitution, to free enslaved individuals in the rebellious states. Congressman Owen Lovejoy calls for allowing Blacks to serve in the Union Army. Additionally, there are resolutions to repeal the Fugitive Slave Act.[45]\n\nDecember 3, 1861\n\nPresident Lincoln sends annual message to Congress. He writes, “…A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. … The Union must be preserved, and hence, all indispensable means must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable.”[46] Lincoln recommends official program of compensated emancipation and colonization of individuals freed from slavery.[47]\n\n1862\n\nTreaty signed between United States and Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade (African Slave Trade Treaty Act).\n\nJanuary 1862\n\nThe United States Congress continues the debate on emancipating enslaved individuals, colonization, and compensation of slaveholders. Radical Republicans continue to submit petitions and bills to this effect.[48]\n\nJanuary 13, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln announces his nomination of Edwin M. Stanton as the new Secretary of War. Stanton is an opponent of slavery.[49]\n\nJanuary 15, 1862\n\nThe United States Senate confirms the appointment of Edwin M. Stanton as Secretary of War.[50]\n\nMarch 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln writes to newspaper editor and abolitionist Horace Greeley that the primary war aim of the United States is saving the Union, and “not either to save or destroy slavery.”\n\nMarch 6, 1862\n\nAbraham Lincoln sends message to the U.S. Congress proposing a plan of gradual, compensated emancipation in the loyal slave states. It states, “I recommend the adoption of a Joint Resolution by your honorable bodies which shall be substantially as follows: ‘Resolved that the United States ought to co-operate with any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such state pecuniary aid, to be used by such state in it's discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences public and private, produced by such change of system.’” [51] The proposal is very quickly approved by Congress. Many of the New York papers endorse the proposal. Lincoln makes the goal of ending slavery in the United States an official policy. The abolitionist community also enthusiastically supports the proposal.[52]\n\nMarch 9, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln discusses possible conference on gradual compensated emancipation with Congressman Blair.[53]\n\nPresident Lincoln comments to Congressman Henry Raymond on the subject of the cost of compensated emancipation: “My dear Sir: I am grateful to the New-York Journals, and not less so to the Times than to others, for their kind notices of the late special Message to Congress. Your paper, however, intimates that the proposition, though well-intentioned, must fail on the score of expense. I do hope you will reconsider this. Have you noticed the facts that less than one half-day's cost of this war would pay for all the slaves in Delaware, at four hundred dollars per head?---that eighty-seven days cost of this war would pay for all in Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Kentucky, and Missouri at the same price? Were those states to take the step, do you doubt that it would shorten the war more than eighty-seven days, and thus be an actual saving of expense. Please look at these things, and consider whether there should not be another article in the Times?”[54]\n\nMarch 13, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln approves an act of the Congress that prohibits Union Army commanders from returning captured or fugitive slaves to their owners (except for loyal slave states). It supersedes the Fugitive Slave Act.[55]\n\nMarch 24, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln writes to editor of the New York Tribune and abolitionist Horace Greeley regarding his support of gradual, compensated emancipation: “I am grateful for the generous sentiments and purposes expressed towards the administration. Of course I am anxious to see the policy proposed in the late special message, go forward; but you have advocated it from the first, so that I need to say little to you on the subject. If I were to suggest anything it would be that as the North are already for the measure, we should urge it persuasively, and not menacingly, upon the South. I am a little uneasy about the abolishment of slavery in this District, not but I would be glad to see it abolished, but as to the time and manner of doing it. If some one or more of the border-states would move fast, I should greatly prefer it; but if this can not be in a reasonable time, I would like the bill to have the three main features---gradual---compensation---and vote of the people---I do not talk to members of congress on the subject, except when they ask me. I am not prepared to make any suggestion about confiscation. I may drop you a line hereafter.”[56]\n\nHorace Greeley, publisher of the New York Tribune, agrees to endorse gradual compensated emancipation of slaves.[57]\n\nUnited States Congress debates issue of compensated emancipation.[58]\n\nLate March 1862\n\nLincoln discusses his proposal for gradual compensated emancipation with abolitionist leader Wendell Phillips. Lincoln tells Phillips, “the negro who has once touched the hem of the government’s garment shall never again be a slave.”[59]\n\nApril 2, 1862\n\nOn Lincoln’s recommendation, U.S. Senate passes resolution calling for gradual compensated abolition of slavery.[60]\n\nApril 3, 1862\n\nUnion General David Dard Hunter requests permission from the Army to recruit Black men from the South Carolina Sea Islands for service in the military. The War Department does not respond, and he begins recruiting Black soldiers on his own authority.\n\nApril 5, 1862\n\nThe Union Army, under General McClellan, begins setting up siege lines in front of Yorktown, Virginia.[61]\n\nLincoln supports bill abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia.[62]\n\nApril 6-7, 1862\n\nBattle of Pittsburg Landing (Shiloh), Tennessee. It is a limited Union victory, with 13,047 Union casualties, 10,694 Confederate.[63]\n\nApril 7, 1862\n\nUnited States House of Representatives appoints a Committee on Emancipation and Colonization of Blacks.[64]\n\nLincoln signs treaty with England for the Suppression of the International African Slave Trade. He transmits the treaty to the Senate for ratification on April 10, 1862.[65] The treaty is ratified unanimously by the upper house on April 24, 1862.[66]\n\nApril 10, 1862\n\nUnited States Congress announces it will cooperate with any state in the gradual emancipation of its slaves (House Resolution 48).[67]\n\nLincoln proclaims a Day of Thanksgiving by Union forces.\n\nApril 11, 1862\n\nUnion Major General David D. Hunter, commander of the Department of the South, issues order freeing slaves who come into his lines.[68]\n\nAfter much debate, United States Congress passes bill abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia.[69]\n\nFall of Fort Pulaski on the Savannah River near the Port of Savannah, Georgia. This is a significant Union success.[70]\n\nApril 13, 1862\n\nRepresentatives from the Freedman’s Association call on Lincoln to give Blacks abandoned plantations at Port Royal, South Carolina.[71]\n\nApril 16, 1862\n\nLincoln signs law, “An Act for the Release of Certain Persons Held to Service, or Labor in the District of Columbia,” passed by United States Congress, providing for immediate, compensated emancipation of slaves in the District of Columbia. It is the first Federal law giving enslaved individuals immediate emancipation. It ends slavery as an institution; it is not a measure to enforce the Confiscation Act. More than 3,000 enslaved individuals are freed. Approximately $900,000 is paid to the former slaveholders by the Federal government. Congress soon repeals the Black Codes of the District. Many enslaved individuals in the areas surrounding Washington will soon escape to freedom there. [72]\n\nApril 25, 1862\n\nUnion Navy under Admiral Farragut arrives at New Orleans, capturing the city. New Orleans’ waterfront is burned by city population. The Mississippi River is opened.[73]\n\nMay 9, 1862\n\nMajor General David D. Hunter, an abolitionist, issues General Order No. 11, freeing slaves in his Department in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. He does it without presidential authority. It affects more than 900,000 African Americans. He also authorizes his officers to enlist Black volunteers.[74]\n\nMay 19, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln nullifies orders of Union Major General Hunter that freed slaves in states of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.[75] He writes “that neither General Hunter, nor any other commander, or person, has been authorized by the Government of the United States to make proclamations declaring the slaves of any State free.”[76]\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives approves resolution that will prohibit slavery from all Federal territories, without compensation to slaveholders.[77]\n\nMay 20, 1862\n\nLincoln signs the Homestead Act, enacted by Congress. It is an important anti-slavery program. It makes 160 acres of public land available to citizens who have not carried arms against the United States.[78]\n\nMay 31 – June 1, 1862\n\nBattle of Seven Pines, or Fair Oaks, Virginia.[79]\n\nJune 5, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln approves congressional bill to appoint commissioners and establish relations with Haiti and Liberia. These are the first Black-led governments to be recognized by the United States Congress.[80]\n\nJune 9, 1862\n\nThe U.S. Senate approves of a resolution that will prohibit slavery from all federal territories. This is without compensation to former slave holders.[81]\n\nLincoln signs bill prohibiting slavery from all federal territories into law.\n\nJune 19, 1862\n\nThe U.S. Congress approves of a resolution that will prohibit slavery from all federal territories. This is without compensation to former slave holders.[82]\n\nJune 20, 1862\n\nDelegation of Progressive Friends (Quakers) visits with Lincoln at the White House. They present him a memorial opposing slavery. Their petition expresses their “desire that he might… free the slaves and thus save the nation from destruction.” Lincoln replies that he believes that slavery is wrong, and that he “had sometime thought that perhaps he might be an instrument in God's hands of accomplishing a great work and he certainly was not unwilling to be.”[83]\n\nJuly 7, 1862\n\nLincoln meets with Major General McClellan at Army of the Potomac headquarters at Harrison’s Landing, Virginia. McClellan attempts to advise the president on military and political policy. He recommends against “forcible abolition of slavery.”[84]\n\nJuly 11-12, 1862\n\nAfter much debate, the United States Congress approves the Second Confiscation Act. It signals a major shift in Union policy toward the freeing of enslaved individuals who enter Union lines or are in occupied Union territory.[85]\n\nJuly 12, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln asks senators and congressmen from the four Union border states to support gradual, compensated emancipation. On July 14, the political leaders from these states reject Lincoln’s plan.[86]\n\nPresident Lincoln appoints a United States Consul General for Haiti.[87]\n\nJuly 13, 1862\n\nLincoln discusses plans for general emancipation of slaves with cabinet members William H. Seward and Gideon Welles. [88] Welles recalls Lincoln saying that “It was a military necessity absolutely essential for the salvation of the Union,” and “that emancipation in Rebel areas must precede that in the border, not the other way around.”\n\nJuly 14, 1862\n\nLincoln sends Congress draft of a bill to give Federal compensation to states who emancipate their slaves. Congress does not act on this proposal.[89]\n\nJuly 17, 1862\n\nCongress enacts the Second Confiscation Act. It is called “An Act to Suppress Insurrection, and to Punish Treason and Rebellion, to Seize and Confiscate Property of Rebels and for Other Purposes.” This act grants freedom to slaves whose masters participated in the secession.[90]\n\nCongress passes the Militia Act. This act allows the U.S. Armed Forces to give employment to Blacks “in any military or naval service for which they may be found competent.” Slaves who worked for the U.S. military are to be declared free.[91]\n\nJuly 22, 1862\n\nAbraham Lincoln submits a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation to his cabinet, to be effective July 1, 1863. It declares that on January 1, 1863, “All persons held as slaves within any state or states [in Confederate control] shall then, thenceforward, and forever, be free.” Abolition was to be immediate and with no compensation to the slaveholders. The Secretary of War calls for it to be issued immediately. Secretary of State Seward advises Lincoln not to issue it until after a major victory in the war.[92]\n\nLincoln issues executive order authorizing, “1. Military commanders may seize and use real property in rebel States for military purposes. 2. Military and naval commanders may employ as laborers persons of African descent, giving them reasonable wages for their labors. 3. Accounts of property of all kinds taken from owners shall be kept as basis for proper compensation.”[93]\n\nJuly 25, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln promulgates the Confiscation Act of Congress.[94]\n\nJuly 28, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln writes to prominent New Orleans citizen Cuthbert Bullitt, who protested Union General John W. Phelps’ aid to enslaved individuals who came to Union lines. “Mr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of master and slave is disturbed by the presence of our Army; and he considers it particularly vexatious that this, in part, is done under cover of an act of Congress, while constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of military necessity. The truth is, that what is done, and omitted, about slaves, is done and omitted on the same military necessity. It is a military necessity to have men and money; and we can get neither, in sufficient numbers, or amounts, if we keep from, or drive from, our lines, slaves coming to them. Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction; nor of my efforts to hold it within bounds till he, and such as he shall have time to help themselves.”[95]\n\nJuly 31, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln writes to August Belmont regarding ending of slavery and its effects. “Broken eggs cannot be mended; but Louisiana has nothing to do now but to take her place in the Union as it was, barring the already broken eggs. The sooner she does so, the smaller will be the amount of that which will be past mending. This government cannot much longer play a game in which it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing. Those enemies must understand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the government, and if they fail still come back into the Union unhurt. If they expect in any contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I join with the writer in saying, ‘Now is the time.’”[96]\n\nAugust 2, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln discusses emancipation with cabinet members.[97]\n\nAugust 3, 1862\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, in cabinet meeting, called for: “1. Assuring freedom to Negroes in seceded states on condition of loyalty; 2. Organizing best of them into military companies; 3. Providing for cultivation of plantations by remaining ones.”[98]\n\nAugust 4, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln is offered two African American regiments from Indiana for the Union Army. He agrees only to use them as laborers, not as soldiers.[99]\n\nPresident Lincoln calls for 300,000 volunteers for service in the military for a term of nine months.[100]\n\nAugust 14, 1862\n\nLincoln meets with African leaders at the White House. This is the first time that an American president meets with Black community leaders in a public meeting. He recommends that they support colonization of African Americans in Central America or in Africa. They reject this proposed plan. He tells them, “But for your race among us there could not be war… It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.”[101]\n\nAugust 19, 1862\n\nHorace Greeley’s anti-slavery New York Tribune editorial, “A Prayer of the Twenty Millions,” is read by President Lincoln. It calls into question Lincoln’s policy on slavery and the war: “We complain that the Union cause has suffered…from mistaken deference to Rebel Slavery.” [102]\n\nAugust 21, 1862\n\nConfederate President Jefferson Davis declares that Union Major General David D. Hunter and Brigadier General John W. Phelps are acting as criminals because they are enlisting slaves for the Federal Army. He directs that if taken, they should be held as felons. General Phelps resigns from the Army the same day.[103]\n\nAugust 22, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln responds to Horace Greeley’s editorial, “A Prayer of Twenty Millions,” which had called for immediate emancipation of slaves. Lincoln writes, “My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and it is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. / I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men every where could be free.” (See Appendix for full text.)[104]\n\nAugust 25, 1862\n\nMajor General Rufus Saxton, Union Commander of the Southern Department, is authorized by the War Department to arm and train 5,000 former slaves for use as guards of captured plantations and settlements in the South Carolina Sea Islands.[105]\n\nAugust 26, 1862\n\nLincoln states his plans to enforce the Confiscation Acts recently passed by Congress.[106]\n\nSeptember 2, 1862\n\nLincoln writes “Meditation on the Devine Will.” He ponders: “In great contests each party claims the act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be wrong. God can not be for and against the same thing at the same time.”[107]\n\nSeptember 13, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln replies to delegation from Chicago advocating for national emancipation of slaves. He states, “It is my earnest desire to know the will of Providence in this matter. And if I can learn what it is I will do it! ... I view the matter as a practical war measure, to be decided upon according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion.”[108]\n\nSeptember 15, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln rejects offer of service of three African American regiments from Massachusetts and Rhode Island.[109]\n\nSeptember 17, 1862\n\nUnion victory at Antietam, in Maryland. Lee’s Maryland Campaign is ended. The Union suffers the largest number of casualties in a single day of fighting in the Civil War, with 2,010 killed, 9,416 wounded and 1,043 missing, totaling 12,469 out of 75,000 soldiers.[110]\n\nPresident Lincoln completes second draft of preliminary emancipation proclamation at the Soldier’s Home.[111]\n\nSeptember 20, 1862\n\nLincoln continues to work on his text of the preliminary emancipation proclamation.[112]\n\nSeptember 22, 1862\n\nUnited States President Abraham Lincoln announces preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. It declares that “on the first day of January in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred sixty-three, all persons held as slaves, within any state, or designated part of a state, the people whereof shall be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.” The Proclamation further states (as summarized by Miers): “President will designate states in rebellion on Jan. 1. Army and navy personnel are prohibited by Act of March 13, 1862, from returning fugitive slaves. The act to suppress insurrection, approved July 17, 1862, provides that: 1. Escaped slaves and those in territory occupied by forces of U.S. shall be free. 2. Run-away slaves will not be delivered up except for crime or claim of lawful owner under oath that he has not borne arms against government. Executive will recommend that loyal citizens be compensated for all losses by acts of U.S., including loss of slaves.”[113] Lincoln calls on Congress to approve legislation for compensated emancipation of slaves.[114]\n\nSeptember 24, 1862\n\nCrowd gathers at the presidential executive mansion in honor of the issuing of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln declares, “What I did, I did after full deliberation, and under a very heavy and solemn sense of responsibility. I can only trust in God I have made no mistake.”[115]\n\nFourteen Northern governors meeting in Altoona, Pennsylvania, approve of the Emancipation Proclamation.[116]\n\nLincoln issues proclamation suspending the writ of habeas corpus. “Now, therefore, be it ordered, first, that during the existing insurrection and as a necessary measure for suppressing the same, all Rebels and Insurgents, their aiders and abettors within the United States, and all persons discouraging volunteer enlistments, resisting militia drafts, or guilty of any disloyal practice, affording aid and comfort to Rebels against the authority of the United States, shall be subject to martial law and liable to trial and punishment by Courts Martial or Military Commission; Second. That the Writ of Habeas Corpus is suspended in respect to all persons arrested, or who are now, or hereafter during the rebellion shall be, imprisoned in any fort, camp, arsenal, military prison, or other place of confinement by any military authority or by the sentence of any Court Martial or Military Commission.” [117]\n\nSeptember 25, 1862\n\nPresident Lincoln meets with Henry Ward Beecher and General Association of Congregational Churches of New York City to present resolutions regarding his Emancipation Proclamation.[118]\n\nSeptember 28, 1862\n\nLincoln discusses public opinion of preliminary Emancipation Proclamation with Vice President Hannibal Hamlin. It is “not very satisfactory.” “The North responds to the proclamation sufficiently in breath; but breath alone kills no rebels.”[119]\n\nOctober 1, 1862\n\nThe Richmond Whig reported its opinion on Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation: “It is a dash of the pen to destroy four thousand millions of our property, and is as much a bid for the slaves to rise in insurrection, with the assurance of aid from the whole military and naval power of the United States.”[120]\n\nOctober 11, 1862\n\nConfederate Congress amends the draft exemption law. It exempts Southern owners or overseers of more than 20 slaves from military service.[121]\n\nOctober 26, 1862\n\nOf the war, Lincoln writes, “If I had had my way, this war would never have been commenced; … but we find it still continues; and we must believe that He permits it for some wise purpose of his own, mysterious and unknown to us.”[122] On his opinion of divine will, Lincoln writes, “The will of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be wrong. God can not be for, and against the same thing at the same time. … By his mere quiet power, on the minds of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.”[123]\n\nNovember 4, 1862\n\nMidterm elections are held. Democrats gain Congressional seats in New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Republicans, however, hold majority in Congress with wins in New England, Michigan and California.[124]\n\nNovember 13, 1862\n\nLincoln tasks U.S. Attorney General Edward Bates with the enforcement of the Provision of Federal Confiscation (“An Act to Suppress Insurrection, to Punish Treason and Rebellion”).[125]\n\nNovember 21, 1862\n\nLincoln meets with unconditional Union Kentuckians to discuss issue of emancipation. The New York Times reports, “He said that he would rather die than take back a word of the Proclamation of Freedom…”[126]\n\nNovember 29, 1862\n\nU.S. Attorney General issues ruling that freedmen born in the U.S. are legally American citizens.[127]\n\nDecember 1, 1862\n\nThird Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress.\n\nAbraham Lincoln sends annual message to Congress continuing to support compensated emancipation. Lincoln states, “Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity, and perpetuate both indefinitely? … The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall our selves, and then we shall save our country. / Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We---even we here---hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free---honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best, hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just---a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless. / December 1, 1862. ABRAHAM LINCOLN”[128]\n\nDecember 13, 1862\n\nUnion Army is defeated in major battle at Fredericksburg, Virginia. There are 12,655 Union and 5,390 Confederate casualties.

Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. It lobbies for the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to grant African Americans the right to vote. It collects 400,000 signatures in a petition presented to the Congress.\n\nJanuary 1, 1863\n\nOn New Year’s Day at noon, in the cabinet room, United States President Abraham Lincoln signs Emancipation Proclamation. It goes into effect, freeing slaves in states that have seceded and are part of the Confederacy. Most slaves in “border states” are freed by state action. It states: “That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.”[135]\n\nJanuary 7, 1863\n\nThe Richmond Enquirer states that the Emancipation Proclamation is “The most startling political crime, the most stupid political blunder, yet known in American history. … Southern people have now only to choose between victory and death.”[136]\n\nJanuary 8, 1863\n\nPresident Lincoln writes to Major General McClernand, defending the Emancipation Proclamation, “…it must stand. As to the states not included in it, of course they can have their rights in the Union as of old.”[137]\n\nJanuary 12, 1863\n\nCongressman Thaddeus Stevens introduces bill calling for the enlistment of 150,000 African American soldiers in the Union Army.[138]\n\nJanuary 19, 1863\n\nPresident Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation is debated in the Confederate Congress.[139]\n\nFebruary 1863\n\nAnti-slavery and abolitionist congressman Thaddeus Stevens gets a bill through Congress authorizing the enlistment of 150,000 United States colored soldiers.[140]\n\nMarch 3, 1863\n\nPresident Lincoln calls for an act by Congress, which will be the first federal draft. It is called “An Act for enrolling and calling out the National Forces, and for other purposes.” Male citizens between 20 and 40 are eligible. 162,535 men are drafted during the war, about six percent of the total number of men who serve in the Union forces.[141]\n\nMarch 4, 1863\n\nThe United States Congress adjourns.\n\nMarch 16, 1863\n\nThe American Freedmen’s Inquiry Commission (AFIC) is created within the War Department by Secretary of War Edwin M.

In my opinion the country now needs no specific thing so much as some man of your ability, and position, to go to this work. When I speak of your position, I mean that of an eminent citizen of a slave-state, and himself a slave-holder. The colored population is the great available and yet unavailed of, force for restoring the Union. The bare sight of fifty thousand armed, and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi, would end the rebellion at once. And who doubts that we can present that sight, if we but take hold in earnest? If you have been thinking of it please do not dismiss the thought.”[145]\n\nMarch 31, 1863\n\nPresident Lincoln writes General David D. Hunter: “I am glad I am glad to see the accounts of your colored force at Jacksonville, Florida. I see the enemy are driving at them fiercely, as is to be expected. It is important to the enemy that such a force shall not take shape, and grow, and thrive, in the South; and in precisely the same proportion, it is important to us that it shall. Hence the utmost caution and vigilance is necessary on our part. The enemy will make extra efforts to destroy them; and we should do the same to preserve and increase them.”[146]\n\nApril 2, 1863\n\nPresident Lincoln meets noted abolitionist journalist Jane Grey Swisshelm at the White House.[147]\n\nApril 15, 1863\n\nLincoln meets with Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts on the subject of influencing policy regarding slavery, which would positively influence England toward the Union. Lincoln drafts this resolution: “Whereas, while heretofore, States, and Nations, have tolerated slavery, recently, for the first in the world, an attempt has been made to construct a new Nation, upon the basis of, and with the primary, and fundamental object to maintain, enlarge, and perpetuate human slavery, therefore, Resolved, That no such embryo State should ever be recognized by, or admitted into, the family of christian and civilized nations; and that all ch[r]istian and civilized men everywhere should, by all lawful means, resist to the utmost, such recognition or admission.”[148]\n\nPresident Lincoln meets U.S. Senator Charles Sumner in the White House regarding slavery and British attitudes toward the Union.[149]\n\nApril 20, 1863\n\nPresident Lincoln issues proclamation declaring the State of West Virginia will be admitted to the Union.[150]\n\nMay 1-4, 1863\n\nBattle of Chancellorsville (Second Fredericksburg; Salem Church), Virginia.

Grant.[160]\n\nJuly 7, 1863\n\nLincoln addresses a large crowd at the White House. “I do most sincerely thank Almighty God for the occasion on which you have called. How long ago is it?---eighty odd years---since on the Fourth of July for the first time in the history of the world a nation by its representatives, assembled and declared as a self-evident truth that ‘all men are created equal.’ … Gentlemen, this is a glorious theme, and the occasion for a speech, but I am not prepared to make one worthy of the occasion.”[161]\n\nJuly 13-17, 1863\n\nNew York City draft riots. Fires break out throughout the city. A Black church and orphanage are burned. Blacks are the primary targets of mobs. It is estimated that a thousand people are killed or wounded.

It states “that for every soldier of the United States killed in violation of the laws of war, a rebel soldiers shall be executed; and for every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor on the public works.”[167]\n\nAugust 5, 1863\n\nLincoln writes Union General Nathaniel Banks. He declares he is “an anti-slavery man… For my part I think I shall not, in any event, retract the Emancipation Proclamation; nor, as executive, even return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.”[168]\n\nAugust 6, 1863\n\nThe north observes Day of Thanksgiving for its victories in the war.[169]\n\nAugust 9, 1863\n\nLincoln writes General Grant that colored troops are “a resource which, if vigorously applied now, will soon close the contest.”[170]\n\nAugust 10, 1863\n\nFrederick Douglass meets with President Lincoln in the White House to discuss recruiting of African American troops.[171]\n\nAugust 26, 1863\n\nLincoln sends letter to J. C. Conkling discussing peace and the emancipation of slaves. “There are those who are dissatisfied with me. To such I would say: You desire peace; and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we attain it? … If you are not for force, nor yet for dissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise. I do not believe any compromise, embracing the maintenance of the Union, is now possible. All I learn, leads to a directly opposite belief. The strength of the rebellion, is its military—its army.”[172]\n\nSeptember 2, 1863\n\nLincoln meets with Secretary of Treasury Salmon P. Chase regarding enforcing the Emancipation Proclamation in the areas of Louisiana and Virginia.[173]\n\nSeptember 11, 1863\n\nPresident Lincoln asks governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson to establish loyal state government.[174]\n\nSeptember 15, 1863\n\nPresident Lincoln suspends the writ of habeas corpus for persons held by Union military and civil authorities.[175]\n\nSeptember 19-20, 1863\n\nBattle of Chickamauga, southeast of Chattanooga, Tennessee.

It would pardon individuals who “directly or by implication, participated in the existing rebellion.”[182]\n\nLincoln issues annual message to Congress. He states that emancipation is having a favorable effect. The message states, in part: “The preliminary emancipation proclamation, issued in September, was running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year. A month later the final proclamation came, including the announcement that colored men of suitable condition would be received into the war service. The policy of emancipation, and of employing black soldiers, gave to the future a new aspect, about which hope, and fear, and doubt contended in uncertain conflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil administration, the general government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and that if it should, the crisis of the contest would then be presented. It came, and as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and doubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take another review.”[183]\n\nDecember 17, 1863\n\nPresident Lincoln sends plan to Congress to create a Federal Bureau of Emancipation, as proposed by the Freedmen’s Aid Society.[184]\n\nDecember 20, 1863\n\nPresident Lincoln tells Henry C.

Hewson, of Missouri, proposes a thirteenth amendment to the constitution to abolish slavery.[187]\n\nJanuary 23, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln proposes plan to have plantation owners honor the freedom of their former slaves and hire them back with fair wages. He states, “I should regard such cases with great favor, and should, as the principle, treat them precisely as I would treat the same number of free white people in the same relation and condition.”[188]\n\nFebruary 22, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln is endorsed for re-election by the Republican National Convention.[189]\n\nFebruary 24, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln approves an act of Congress to compensate Union (border state) slave owners whose slaves enlist in the U.S. Army.

J. Creswell, Representative from Maryland, regarding gradual emancipation of slaves from the state. He states, “My wish is that all who are for emancipation in any form, shall co-operate, all treating all respectfully, and all adopting and acting upon the major opinion, when fairly ascertained.”[193]\n\nMarch 9, 1864\n\nGeneral Grant is officially commissioned as Lieutenant General in the Regular Army. Lincoln remarks, “The nation’s appreciation of what you have done, and it’s reliance upon you for what remains to do, in the existing great struggle, are now presented with this commission, constituting you Lieutenant General in the Army of the United States.”[194]\n\nMarch 10, 1864\n\nLieutenant General Grant is given command of the Armies of the United States.[195]\n\nMarch 12, 1864\n\nMajor General Henry Halleck is appointed Chief of Staff of the Union Army.[196]\n\nMajor General William T. Sherman is assigned to command the Military Division of the Mississippi. He will command the Departments of the Arkansas, Cumberland, Ohio and Tennessee.[197]\n\nMarch 13, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln writes Governor Michael Hahn of Louisiana, “I congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as the first-free-state Governor of Louisiana. Now you are about to have a Convention which, among other things, will probably define the elective franchise. I barely suggest for your private consideration, whether some of the colored people may not be let in—as, for instance, the very intelligent, and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks. They would probably help, in some trying time to come, to keep the jewel of liberty within the family of freedom.”[198]\n\nMarch 16, 1864\n\nPro-Union voters in Arkansas ratify state constitution that formally abolishes slavery.[199]\n\nMarch 17, 1864\n\nLincoln writes to Maryland Congressman John A.

It would aid much to end the rebellion.”[200]\n\nMarch 22, 1864\n\nLincoln writes, “I never knew a man who wished to be himself a slave. Consider if you know any good thing, that no man desires for himself.”[201]\n\nMarch 25, 1864\n\nAbolitionist and political leader Owen Lovejoy dies. He supported the abolition of slavery as a United States Congressman.\n\nApril 4, 1864\n\nPresident Lincoln writes to Albert G. Hodges, a Kentucky newspaper editor, “I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel. And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling. … And I aver that, to this day, I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on slavery. … I did understand however, that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me the duty of preserving, by every indispensable means, that government—that nation—of which that constitution was the organic law. … When, in March, and May, and July 1862 I made earnest, and successive appeals to the border states to favor compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation, and arming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure. They declined the proposition; and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it, the Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I chose the latter.”[202]\n\nApril 5, 1864\n\nLincoln acknowledges petition of “the children of the United States; that the President will free all slave children.” The petition was given to Lincoln by Mrs. Horace Mann. Lincoln writes, “The petition of persons under eighteen, praying that I would free all slave children, and the heading of which petition it appears you wrote, was handed me a few days since by Senator Sumner. Please tell these little people I am very glad their young hearts are so full of just and generous sympathy, and that, while I have not the power to grant all they ask, I trust they will remember that God has, and that, as it seems, He wills to do it. Yours truly A.

We cannot have free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forego or postpone a national election, it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us… [The election] had demonstrated that a people’s government can sustain a national election in the midst of a great civil war.”[255]\n\nNovember 14-15, 1864\n\nGeneral W.

He states that Sherman’s March to the Sea is “the most remarkable feature of military operations.” Lincoln urges the House of Representatives to pass the “proposed amendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United States,” which had passed the Senate, and as it is to so go, may we not agree that the sooner the better.” [259]\n\nSalmon P.

Garfield states, “Mr. Speaker, we shall never know why slavery dies so hard in this Republic and in this Hall, till we know why sin outlives disaster, and Satan is immortal…” Radical Republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens regards slavery as “the worst institution upon earth, one which is a disgrace to man and would be an annoyance to the infernal spirits.”[269]\n\nGeneral Sherman and Secretary of War Stanton, along with Acting Adjutant General of the Army Brevet Brigadier General E. D. Townsend, meet with a group of 20 prominent African American clergymen and community leaders. Reverend Garrison Frazier, a 67-year old former pastor of the Third African Baptist Church, is asked to be the spokesman for the group. Sherman is asked to leave the room and is greatly offended by this. Stanton inquires about Sherman’s treatment of the African American community: “State what is the feeling of the colored people toward General Sherman, and how far do you regard his sentiments and actions as friendly to their rights and interests, or otherwise?” Frazier replies: “We looked upon General Sherman, prior to his arrival, as a man, in the providence of God, specially set aside to accomplish this work, and we unanimously felt inexpressible gratitude to him, looking upon him as a man who should be honored for the faithful performance of his duty. Some of us called upon him immediately upon his arrival, and it is probable he did not meet the secretary with more courtesy than he did us. His conduct and deportment toward us characterized him as a friend and gentleman. We have confidence in General Sherman, and think what concerns us could not be in better hands. This is our opinion now, for the short acquaintance and intercourse we have had.”[270]\n\nJanuary 16, 1865\n\nGeneral Sherman issues Special Field Order No. 15. It provides for the confiscation of 400,000 acres of land along the Atlantic coast of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. The order was issued to deal with the thousands of African American refugees who had joined Sherman’s march and were recently freed from slavery in the Savannah area. The order reads, in part: “I. The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned rice-fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the St. John’s River, Florida, are reserved and set apart for the settlement of the negroes now made free by the acts of war and the proclamation of the President of the United States. / II. At Beaufort, Hilton Head, Savannah, Fernandina, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville the blacks may remain in their chosen or accustomed vocations; but on the islands, and in the settlements hereafter to be established, no white person whatever, unless military officers and soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside, and the sole and exclusive management of affairs will be left to the freed people themselves, subject only to the United States military authority, and the acts of Congress. By the laws of war and orders of the President of the United States, the negro is free, and must be dealt with as such.”\n\nThe Field Order and its provisions were revoked by President Johnson’s administration.\n\nJanuary 19, 1865\n\nGeneral William T.

Section 2. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” It sends the Amendment to the states for ratification.

Andrew Johnson is sworn in as the new Vice President. In his speech, he declares about slavery: “One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war…” He further stated, Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword…” He concludes his speech by saying: “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.”[292]\n\nFor the first time, thousands of African Americans attend the inauguration.
