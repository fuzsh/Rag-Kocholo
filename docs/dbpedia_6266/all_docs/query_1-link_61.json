        "text": "William Monroe Trotter, who edited the Boston-based black weekly newspaper The Guardian in the first three decades of the 20th century, shows up in the biographies of his contemporaries as a gadfly: radical, outspoken and indefatigable.\n\nIn books about Booker T. Washington, Trotter makes inevitable appearances as one of the so-called Great Accommodationist’s most relentless critics, sarcastically asking whether the only things black Americans could expect from Washington’s prominence were “the rope and the torch.”\n\nEven W.E.B. Du Bois, who himself became increasingly disillusioned with Washington, deemed Trotter both an irritant and an inspiration. The Guardian editor, Du Bois wrote, was “a clean-hearted, utterly unselfish man whom I admired despite his dogged and unreasoning prejudices.”\n\nThat man comes through in “Black Radical,” Kerri K. Greenidge’s spirited biography, an ardent and mostly approving account of Trotter’s life that nevertheless conveys the more vexing elements of his personality. Trotter could be arrogant and cavalier; such traits undoubtedly energized his radicalism, but they could also blunt its actual effects. As Du Bois diplomatically put it, Trotter was “too intense and sturdy to loan himself to that compromise which is the basis of all real organization.”\n\nThis is the first major biography of Trotter in half a century. Stephen Fox’s 1970 book, “The Guardian of Boston,” was a crisp narration of Trotter’s story; Greenidge, a historian at Tufts University, is as interested in Trotter’s context in the post-Reconstruction North as she is in the man himself. She wants to reclaim his underappreciated legacy for the current moment, too: “There are lessons yet to be learned from his imperfect, yet sincere, battle for racial justice.”\n\nTrotter was born in 1872 and grew up comfortable in Boston’s Hyde Park. His father, James Trotter, was born enslaved but later acquired considerable wealth, owing to some savvy real estate investments and a highly paid government post in the Grover Cleveland administration.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
