        "text": "William Trotter, wearing a suit and tie in the portrait above, was a businessman, journalist, and activist. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard in 1895, the first African American to graduate with that honor. In 1901 he founded the Boston Guardian newspaper, which quickly became one of the most important newspapers of the national Black Press. The first issue of the Guardian appeared on November 9, 1901, and Trotter promised its readers “an organ which is to voice intelligently the needs and aspirations of the colored American.” In addition he wrote, “We have come to protest forever against being proscribed or shut off in any caste from equal rights with other citizens, and shall remain forever on the firing line at any and all times in defence of such rights.” On the Guardian masthead Trotter called the paper “America’s greatest race journal.”\n\nTrotter advocated for a radical Black Liberation long before Malcolm X. Some of his activism included leading national protests against screenings of the film The Birth of a Nation. Along with leaders like W.E.B. Du Bois, Trotter was one of the founders of the Niagara Movement that contributed to the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In a widely publicized meeting with President Woodrow Wilson, he protested against the introduction of segregation in the federal workplace.\n\nHe died on his birthday, on April 7, 1934. During this period, Trotter was facing a loss of standing among activists, and the Guardian was facing major financial problems. When Trotter was worried or troubled he would go up on the roof of his apartment building and pace back and forth with his eyes closed, talking to himself. While pacing on his 62nd birthday, Trotter — accidentally or deliberately — walked off the roof and fell to his death.\n\nOriginally purchased by the University in 1921, Trotter House opened for operation on November 15, 1971. Trotter House immediately took advantage of its 3 stories and 15 rooms, hosting a wide array of programming. At Trotter House, Black students could find lunches, art workshops, new student orientations, academic and career counseling, a chess clinic, and parties and dances, to name just a few."
