The reported fact that she ran away with her children to Cincinnati, Ohio from slave-owner Richard S. Trotter in Mississippi indicates kinship existed between her and saviors in Ohio wherein lived Madison Hemings' Uncle John Hemings and his offspring.\n\nExcepting perhaps in a Hollywood movie, ... women, even White ones, then or now do not undertake a hazardous journey such as escaping from Mississippi unless believing they were going to a better time and place. It is possible but more likely the Underground Railway that embraced her included relatives who knew of her existence, ... and perhaps worked or arranged for passage on one of the hundreds of steamboats going up and down the Mississippi River using many thousands of Black men to shovel coal into the steam engines and provide other labor intensive services including the loading and unloading of cargo.\n\nFamily Group RecordFamilySearch Ancestral File v4.19Search Results | Download GEDCOM | Print\n\nHusband's NameRichard S TROTTER (AFN:L9XP-5V) Born: Abt. 1816Place: <Grand Gulf, Vicksburg, Mississippi>Died: Place: Vicksburg, MississippiFather: Mother: Wife's NameLetitia (AFN:L9XP-62) Born: Abt. 1820Place: <Grand Gulf, Vicksburg, Mississippi>Father: Mother: Children1.
