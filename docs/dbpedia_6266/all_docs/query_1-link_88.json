        "text": "Additional points of interest in greater Boston:\n\nWilliam Stanley Braithwaite (1878 – 1962): Braithwaite was born in Boston and was an African-American literary critic for the Boston Transcript. He lived on Phillips Street in Boston’s Beacon Hill, but the address is unknown and the family appears to have lived there only briefly before they moved to Newport, RI.\n\nEugene Gordon (1891 – 1972): Gordon was born in Florida and moved to Boston during the 1910s. He fought in World War One and became a writer for the Boston Post in 1919. In 1928, he founded The Saturday Evening Quill, a magazine of New Negro poetry, short stories, and articles by African-American writers in greater Boston, including Dorothy West and Helene Johnson, cousins who eventually joined the younger generation of Harlem Renaissance writers. The Quill was not published in Boston but in Cambridge.\n\nHelene Johnson / Dorothy West: The women were cousins who grew up in Boston and became famous writers during the Harlem Renaissance. At her death in 1998, West was the last surviving writer of that Era, whose short stories were republished while she was living at her family home on Martha’s Vineyard. West and her cousins lived at 478 Brookline Avenue in Brookline.\n\nMaude Cuney Hare: Maude Cuney Hare (1874 – 1936): Hare’s Negro Musicians and Their Music (1936) is a considered a foundational text of African-American musicology. Hare graduated from the New England Conservatory of Music in the 1890s. She lived most of her life in Boston. Her house is located at 43 Sheridan Street in Roxbury.\n\nPauline Hopkins (1859 – 1930): Hopkins was the most prolific African American woman writer of her era, and she published the Colored American in Boston from 1900 to 1904. Since the Colored American’s publishing office is located on the Literary Trail already, and since Hopkins lived in Cambridge, not Boston proper, she is included in the write-up for the Colored American Magazine."
