        "text": "FOUR\n\nWilliam Monroe Trotter\n\nBostonian\n\nWILLIAM MONROE TROTTER was above all else a product of the Boston racial environment: he was born, raised, educated, and married there and rarely left. Intellectually he descended from various strands of abolitionist thought, but he devised his own strategy to win equality for African-Americans during the high tide of white racism. Because the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had a more appropriate method for winning full legal equality, and perhaps because he never wrote a book, Trotter’s importance within national African-American politics is sometimes overlooked. He is best known for the 1903 meeting at which he challenged Booker Washington, the “Boston Riot”; and in a certain sense he can be seen as the bridge over which W. E. B. Du Bois passed to the founding of the Niagara movement. In Boston he was the central leader of the African-American community from 1904 to about 1915, and is perhaps the single most important figure in all of Boston’s African-American history.\n\nTrotter’s father James was born a slave in Mississippi. His family arrived in Cincinnati around 1854 (whether by escape or manumission is not clear) and the free James Monroe Trotter joined the 55th Massachusetts Civil War regiment, serving under N. P. Hallowell and George Garrison, son of William Lloyd Garrison. As a soldier, James Trotter was a leader in the fight for equal pay for African-American troops. After the war he moved to Boston. Virginia Isaacs Trotter, William Monroe’s mother, returned to Ohio for health reasons in 1872 to deliver her only son. Two daughters, Maude and Bessie, were born later. The elder Trotter worked at the post office, and after suffering racial discrimination at the hands of the Republican patronage machine, he turned to the Democrats. During the first Grover Cleveland administration, he rose to the highest appointed post open to African-Ameri cans, recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. At the end of Cleveland’s first term, James Trotter returned to Boston and began a prosperous real estate business.1\n\nWilliam Monroe Trotter was an outstanding student, popular with his classmates in the mostly white Hyde Park section, and possessed of a strong religious inclination that he exercised in an integrated Baptist church. Trotter attended Harvard, where he won scholarships and was the first African-American elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He cheered the athletic teams enthusiastically, joined the Wendell Phillips Club, and was president of the Total Abstinence League. He took a wide range of courses, studying with teachers Francis Peabody, Edward Cummings, Albert Bushnell Hart, and Oswald Garrison Villard. He graduated magna cum laude in 1895, having had a positive and happy experience.2\n\nTrotter took a succession of jobs after college, planning to enter his late father’s business. In 1899 he married Geraldine Pindell, whose uncle had participated in the movement to desegregate the Boston public schools in the 1850s; they were happily married and Geraldine was her husband’s main collaborator on the newspaper they would help to found, the Guardian, until her death in 1918. The Trotters joined social clubs and helped to organize the Boston Literary and Historical Association in 1901. Trotter’s correspondence with his white classmate John A. Fairlie shows much of his sensibility around this time. He writes somewhat condescendingly of playing tennis with his country cousins in Ohio on their large farm. After graduation he eagerly sought tickets for Harvard football games and attended reunions with his white friends. Joining a white real estate firm in 1899 Trotter prospered and acquired various properties in his own name. His sister Maude was married in 1907 to Dr. Charles G. Steward, son of Chaplain Theophilus Steward of the 25th Infantry. According to the Boston Herald, “The bride wore a gown of imported embroidered Swiss en train”; the leading lights of Boston’s black upper class brought expensive gifts.3 Trotter inherited culture, wealth, and racial pride.\n\nYet, Trotter sensed the contradictary nature of his situation. On the one hand, he was born into comfort, was blessed with remarkable gifts of intelligence and self-discipline, had married a woman of similar temperament, and had a promising financial career. On the other hand, he was conscious of the prejudice he faced at home and of the national deterioration of race relations that grew increasingly more ominous. Offered a job as a teacher in Washington, D.C., after graduation, Trotter declined, explaining to Fairlie his preference for a business career, but protesting also that “the place is too far South and the school a separate one.” He recognized that there would be obstacles in business as well: “I should prefer to take my chances in an established firm but there is in the way of high preferment for me one large impediment that other men do not have to hinder them.”4\n\nAs Stephen R. Fox accurately observes in his biography of Trotter, the combination of renascent racism nationally, the influences of his father, Harvard, and the militant group among the Boston elite pushed Trotter in the direction of political activism. Along with William H. Scott, a minister from nearby Woburn, and George W. Forbes, a writer who worked at the public library, Trotter participated in the Massachusetts Racial Protective Association. In his first address before this group, he spoke against the policies of Booker Washington. With these new friends, he began to publish the Boston Guardian, whose first issue appeared 9 November 1901.5\n\nThis truncated summary of Trotter’s early career may be usefully compared and contrasted to that of the preeminent leader of the protest tradition, Trotter’s brief ally and later antagonist, William Edward Burghardt Du Bois. Like Trotter, Du Bois was gifted, Massachusetts-born, exposed to white playmates as a boy, and educated at Harvard. Du Bois had even courted Geraldine Pindell. Du Bois, however, as he later revealed in several striking literary passages, was earlier troubled by “the veil” drawn by whites against Negroes, and he grappled more intensely with the problem of the “duality” of the African-American identity. Unlike Trotter, he was not born a Bostonian, nor to a father well-connected to the white world. Unlike Trotter, he made his way south to study at Fisk and teach in isolated rural schools, and later at Atlanta University. He admired Booker Washington throughout his formative years. Four years Trotter’s senior, he did not publicly break with Washington until 1903, with the thoughtful volume, The Souls of Black Folk.6\n\nDu Bois’s early career, with a rich experience of the North and South, allowed him a better appreciation of the national relation of forces between black and white. A key to Trotter’s political outlook is that he apparently never set foot in the states of the Confederacy. Although the Guardian reported every lynching, Jim Crow law, disfranchisement measure, and racist utterance by southern white politicians, it necessarily recorded these developments by clipping the national press. In a sense, Trotter was covering a foreign country. Welcoming conventioneers to his National Independent Political League’s Boston meeting in August 1911, the Guardian banner enthused, “Welcome to the Home of Abolition,” a place “where it is no crime to be black.” Trotter urged his guests to “breathe Boston air, spend a short time in its atmosphere, and you will be proud that you are an American citizen.”7 No doubt, a visit to the many shrines honoring the abolitionist heroes could be inspiring. Conversely, exclusive respiration of such a rarefied atmosphere could be limiting. After Trotter’s second confrontation with President Woodrow Wilson in 1915, he made a midwestern speaking tour, organized by his ally Ida B. Wells-Barnett. “I thought that he needed to get out in this part of the country and see that the world didn’t revolve around Boston as a hub,” Wells-Barnett noted.8\n\nIf Trotter lived in a rapidly changing and increasingly multinational Boston, his imagination was rooted in its abolitionist past. African-Americans nationally regarded Boston with special reverence; even Booker Washington celebrated the abolitionists as heroes. Trotter esteemed the lives of the abolitionists as a rebuke to the commercial spirit of his own age. He sponsored commemorations of their centennials in an almost religious spirit. As the leader of the Boston militants, he was keeper of the flame, a secular priest in a holy city.\n\nTrotter borrowed from the distinct strands of the antislavery impulse. Very early he fashioned his own strategy to win civil rights. He never wrote a book or even a pamphlet, but his métier was the editorial and the indignation meeting. As Fox notes, Trotter was the only African-American editor to make a lifelong career of producing a weekly newspaper and leading a national protest group. In this choice of career, William Lloyd Garrison was the obvious role model.9\n\nUltimately he drove away every strong-willed person with whom he collaborated. “You are finding that it is impossible to work permanently with Mr. Trotter, unless he does the commanding; he is not well balanced enough. . . . He is a splendid fellow in many ways: self-sacrificing and honest, at the same time we cannot afford to let him go ahead and have his own way.”10 Thus Du Bois advised Bishop Alexander Walters of New York, who was then working with Trotter to establish the Negro-American Political League (NAPL). One need not adduce the many harsh judgments of him by his opponents to establish this case. He should have been able to treat with respect militants like Clement Morgan or Butler Wilson with whom he disagreed. This was his tragic flaw: a sectarianism that personalized even tactical political disagreements.\n\nAN INDEPENDENT IN POLITICS\n\nFrom men like his father, and the editor Timothy Thomas Fortune, he adopted a stance of political independence. Exercise of the suffrage was the linchpin of Trotter’s strategy, and the names of his various organizations reflected this: New England Suffrage League, Negro-American Political League, National Independent Political League. On the national level, Trot ter supported Theodore Roosevelt with reservations in 1904 (the reservation being that he dump Booker Washington as political adviser). In 1908, the Guardian campaigned for Ohio Republican Joseph Benjamin Foraker, then fell just short of endorsing Democrat William Jennings Bryan after the Republican convention. After his 1912 endorsement of Woodrow Wilson, Trotter returned to the Republicans in 1916 and 1920.11 This particular electoral peregrination was not entirely unique in that all Progressive Era presidents betrayed preelection promises to African-Americans, causing some uncertainty about traditional Republican loyalty. What made Trotter unusual, however, was that he elevated these tactical choices to the level of principle. “Any [Secretary of War William Howard] Taft Negro Is Blood Guilty of Disfranchisement by Taft’s Own Speeches,” a 1908 Guardian headline declared, and beneath it, “The Race Traitor’s Column” named names.12\n\nTrotter’s electoral strategy overestimated the race’s power to win its demands through the ballot. “Can Control Presidency,” a May 1904 Guardian headline declared. “Negroes of North Hold Balance of Power in Next Presidential Election Says New York Sun . . . Chance to Force Demands.” The Sun article included a table showing the margin of Republican victory in 1900 in California, Connecticut, Indiana, New York, and New Jersey, and contrasted it to the eligible African-American electorate in those states. If these voters threatened to bolt and vote Democratic, the Republicans would have no choice but to act on the civil rights agenda. By and large, African-American voters stayed with the Republicans throughout this period, shifting only during the 1910 midterm election, along with the white electorate. However, it is unlikely that the electoral card could have been played with much effect on a national level by the nation’s small number of enfranchised northern African-Americans. Not until the 1920s did black voters figure into the plans of some big-city machines, and Boston, with its small community, was not one of these.13\n\nThis strategy was made more strict by Trotter’s corollary belief that no member of his organization could hold a responsible position in a political party. For this reason, Trotter demanded that Virginia’s James H. Hayes resign the presidency of the National Negro Suffrage League in 1904, because he was a member of the Republican national convention.14 By this logic, Trotter would have banned from membership his father, a Democratic officeholder, or Frederick Douglass. This early dispute with Hayes was a Rosetta stone that explained the pattern of Trotter’s career. The important turning point in Trotter’s life was his disruption of the Massachusetts branch of the Niagara movement in 1907. This was the national movement founded by Du Bois that stood for the full civil rights agenda. Trotter had no impor tant political differences with Du Bois or Clement G. Morgan, his rival for Massachusetts leadership, yet he clashed with them over minor issues. Trotter and Morgan were among the six New England founding members of Niagara in 1905 and had been closely allied since the Boston Riot of July 1903, after which Morgan represented Trotter in court. In July 1906, Trotter argued with Morgan, who was a good friend of Du Bois, over several issues. He opposed the admission of women to the Niagara movement, in particular Maria Baldwin and Mrs. Archibald Grimké. He distorted a Morgan speech that was printed in the Guardian. Finally, Trotter opposed the reelection of Massachusetts Governor Curtis Guild, whom Morgan supported.15\n\nDu Bois traveled to Boston in February 1906 and June 1907 to try to reconcile the two men. Trotter agreed to work harmoniously with Morgan and then fired off a letter full of recrimination as soon as Du Bois returned to Atlanta in 1907. In June, the Boston group organized a fundraising play for a challenge to a Virginia Jim Crow law. George Forbes, a Guardian founder who broke with Trotter under pressure from Booker Washington, worked energetically on the play. To this Trotter also objected. He and his supporters did not help organize the Niagara movement’s 1907 meeting in Boston, but Forbes and his wife did.16\n\nThe Guardian did promote that convention, but with its own particular slant. Trotter ran larger articles boosting his favorite local Republican, Senator Winthrop Murray Crane, and bashing Morgan’s favorite, Curtis Guild, who had urged the Massachusetts legislature to fund the segregated Jamestown, Virginia, tercentenary exposition. Eight hundred people attended the public meeting, over which Du Bois presided. It was addressed by Niagara movement stalwarts like New Haven attorney George W. Crawford, the Baptist Reverend Dr. Charles S. Morris of New York, and New York school principal William L. Bulkeley. Trotter and his allies, except the nonsectarian Reverdy Ransom, were notably absent from the speakers’ list.17\n\nIn the aftermath of the convention, Du Bois attempted to address further organizational questions raised by Trotter. Trotter charged that nonmembers of the movement had voted for officers and the election was thus invalid. Du Bois staged another election in Massachusetts and tried to establish who was actually on the membership rolls. In Du Bois’s opinion, an exceedingly scrupulous election was then held; the Forbeses and Grimkés were accepted as associate members, and remaining matters in dispute were to be laid before the executive committee. Du Bois concluded: “Is this movement a great movement which invites co-operation from all the race or is it a small clique which is using the movement to settle personal debts and its petty animosities? . . . Finally, I regret to say that while no one has defended Mr. Trotter more than I have or believes more than I do in the worth of his work and the great sacrifices that he has made, nevertheless I am reluctantly compelled to believe that Mr. Trotter is a burden to the Niagara Movement at present.”18 Trotter never worked with Du Bois again, and he went on to build the Negro-American Political League with New York’s Bishop Alexander Walters and J. Milton Waldron of Washington, D.C., as allies. Trotter had allowed a series of minor tactical questions to separate himself from Du Bois, who adroitly identified the underlying conceptual differences between the two approaches. Trotter had never been wholly loyal to Niagara anyway, keeping his Suffrage League going during Niagara’s tenuous existence.\n\nWorking from his Boston base and armed with the Guardian, Trotter simply saw himself as the center of the national movement. A few months after the Niagara movement left town in 1907, Trotter organized a centennial celebration in honor of the martyred abolitionist Elijah Lovejoy. Twelve hundred people came to Faneuil Hall to press for a congressional resolution outlawing the Jim Crow railroad car in interstate travel. William Lloyd Garrison Jr. and future NAACP leader Mary White Ovington spoke, Trotter read a bill drawn up by Albert E. Pillsbury, and Moorfield Storey and Thomas Wentworth Higginson sent letters of support. The meeting was held under the auspices of the New England Suffrage League without a mention of Clement Morgan or the Niagara movement; by any measure the meeting was a success. Trotter was back at Faneuil Hall in March 1908 with a meeting of equal size, this time threatening to bolt the Republican Party if Secretary of War William Howard Taft was the nominee. The long list of speakers comprised African-American ministers, some attorneys, and Trotter.19\n\nThis meeting provided the momentum for a Philadelphia conference that founded the Negro-American Political League in April 1908. Trotter portrayed this event as a complete vindication, claiming a total of four thousand participants at two rallies. One article described in vivid detail an enthusiastic gathering of two thousand that overflowed the packed church. William H. Scott, Trotter, and Bishop Walters presided, and Trotter ally Reverend Byron Gunner, now of Hillburn, New York; nominal chairman J. Milton Waldron; and James Hayes of the Suffrage League delivered the speeches. The new organization pledged itself above all to prevent the nomination of Roosevelt or Taft.20\n\nWalters was nervous about the convention before it began and appealed to Du Bois to come to Philadelphia to counter Trotter’s influence: “As I told you before, the initiative for the Philadelphia meeting was taken by Messrs. Trotter and Scott and not by myself, I joined in with them with the hope that we might be able to unite all the forces, but I have since discovered that it is utterly impossible to work with Mr. Trotter.” Du Bois was through with Trotter and would not come. In the aftermath, both were disconcerted by the convention’s outcome. “The convention was a success, in point of numbers and as a sentiment maker: the personnel of the convention was quite representative at least enough so as to disarm the ridicule which the [conservative] New York Age had prepared in advance to give it. Hundreds were turned away at the door each evening,” Walters reported. Du Bois observed that the convention had simply built a rival organization, further fracturing the race to no apparent purpose.21\n\nTrotter fought with Niagara’s more potent successor, the NAACP, when after a scheduling mix-up Trotter and the association’s Clement Morgan planned separate centennial celebrations for Charles Sumner. The New York office urged Morgan to cancel his meeting but Morgan persisted. Trotter organized a series of meetings on 5 and 6 January 1911, under the auspices of the New England Suffrage League in cooperation with the National Independent Political League, succesor to the NAPL. Five years after the Brownsville incident of 1906, when President Theodore Roosevelt summarily discharged a battallion of African-American soldiers, Trotter was relentlessly firing away at Roosevelt’s faction in the Republican Party. Trotter’s evening meetings drew a combined total of 2,200, and were addressed by Democratic Governor Eugene N. Foss; Albert E. Pillsbury; Mayor John F. Fitzgerald; George Downing, the son of an African-American friend of Sumner’s; Professor Charles Zueblein; Dr. A. A. Berle, a Methodist bishop; and a host of African-American ministers headed by Reverdy Ransom. Governor Foss struck the partisan theme that Trotter desired: Charles Sumner’s successor in the Senate, Henry Cabot Lodge (a Roosevelt man) was unworthy of his predecessor. There were daytime celebrations as well, and Trotter had reason to be pleased with the outcome.22\n\nMorgan, on the other hand, stumbled badly. His featured speaker was ex-governor Curtis Guild, who painted an unflattering portrait of Sumner before a mostly African-American audience. Abolitionist veteran Frank Sanborn and African-American civil rights lawyer Butler Wilson answered Guild from the rostrum. Trotter turned this tense encounter into grist for his vengeful mill, pointing out in his paper that Lodge himself had been invited to speak; that Lodge’s agent had paid for the hall rental; and that some endorsers of the meeting had had their names used without being notified. Trotter covered the NAACP’s New York commemoration favorably, but in Boston the damage to the community’s unity was serious.23\n\nThis sequence of events from 1905 to 1910 reveals much about Trotter’s national strategy and his self-perception. Simply put, Trotter conceived him self to be at center stage in the North, and he was not entirely without reason. It was he who had challenged Booker Washington in 1901 and set in motion the train of events that led to the Niagara League. He had built large public protests in Philadelphia and Boston, and had allies in Washington and New York. As a Bostonian, Trotter had access to a tradition that New Yorkers or Atlantans, despite the size of those communities, could not match. By mobilizing militant sentiment, it is not surprising that he could challenge Du Bois and regard himself as the real leader of the movement.\n\nTrotter boldly called for protest meetings because he believed that mass action inspired people. Although he stressed the value of suffrage, he never argued that electoral politics was sufficient by itself to effect full equality. Like Garrison and Douglass, he was an activist who thrived on indignation meetings to rouse the conscience of the nation. Almost as a counterpoint to this approach, Trotter showed very little interest in legal challenges or legislative maneuvering to win the day. There is little coverage in the Guardian of lawsuits. By contrast, Butler Wilson and Clement Morgan, the African-American leaders of the Boston NAACP, were both attorneys. Trotter did have legal allies: Edgar Benjamin and Emery T. Morris were the outstanding ones, but his chief Boston supporters tended to be ministers. As we shall see in more detail later, Trotter was deeply rooted in Boston’s black community and its antislavery tradition.\n\nWith this understanding, it is easier to appreciate how Trotter misjudged the potential of the NAACP when it appeared in the 1909–11 period. Trotter attended the New York meeting that presaged the NAACP and he contributed rancorously to the debate over the platform. He advocated adding a phrase on Jim Crow transportation, and more explicit language on lynching, but displayed a skeptical attitude. He was not among the twelve African-Americans on the original Committee of Forty that came out of the meeting. Toward the NAACP nationally he was wary. When the association’s 1911 meeting was scheduled for Boston, the Guardian welcomed it as a white civil rights organization that colored people should support.24\n\nTrotter pointed with local pride to the prominence of Bostonians in the association such as Moorfield Storey, Albert Pillsbury, Maria Baldwin, Francis Jackson Garrison, Horace Bumstead, Archibald Grimké, and, nominally, himself. He editorialized that “such a movement has great power, at least in means, brains, and influence. Its effectiveness depends on the principles the movement espouses, its consistency and the number of white Americans it can win to its program.” He urged his readers to participate and help give direction. “This is the home of abolition, of equal rights. It leads in these principles the rest of the country. Reaction is setting in. Any compromise in Boston will doubly damage the cause. . . . Let’s all attend.” Eight hundred people came, and Trotter praised the harmonious atmosphere. In a significant editorial, titled “A Great, Important Movement,” Trotter regretted that association leader Moorfield Storey had a kind word for Booker Washington and feared that “the wide open door policy of membership pursued has its dangers.” However, “we should all wish it success and take part in making it of great benefit to race and country.”25\n\nTrotter rejected his own advice. As soon as the delegates left town, he announced plans for the convention of the National Independent Political League (NIPL; successor to the Negro-American Political League), to be held in Boston in August. His colleagues in this endeavor included Bishop Walters, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, and local supporters the Reverend M. A. N. Shaw, Emery Morris, I. D. Barnett, M. Cravath Simpson, and writer Pauline Hopkins. Trotter saw two civil rights organizations: a colored one that he led, and a white one. As Fox suggests, a combination of Trotter’s belief in the need for a black-led group, and his own inability to work in a team with equals kept him away from the NAACP.26\n\nOne further dimension of great import also separated the NAACP from the NIPL: their programs. The NAACP was a response not only to the resurgence of racism, but also to the burgeoning progressive reform movements of the day. The white association leaders in particular were concerned about the lack of interest in the Negro shown by Progressives, but they also were influenced by the nonpartisan spirit of the reformers. The association itself did not endorse candidates and adopted “pressure group” tactics. White and middle-class in leadership, its tone was earnest but reasoned, rather than militant. The very topic of the 1911 conference, “Race Discrimination: Its Relation to Segregation, Peonage, Violations of Property and Labor Rights, and Its Ultimate Results,” sounded like the title of an academic paper. Its plan of work for 1911 was to study Negro schools, organize a national legal redress committee, establish a bureau of information, publish the Crisis, hold mass meetings, form local groups, campaign to reapportion Congress, study national aid to education, and make foreign propaganda. While there existed varying points of view about membership and organization, the association aimed to be broadly based and racially integrated.27\n\nThe National Independent Political League, by contrast, planned to participate in the elections as the main part of its strategy. Condemning both parties, it resolved to “vote only for congressmen and other candidates for office who pledge themselves to advocate the following measures,” including opposition to disfranchisement, peonage, Jim Crow cars, and support for equal education, national legislation against lynching, and the restoration of the discharged Brownsville soldiers. If the NIPL’s agenda overlapped somewhat with the association’s, it did have a different focus. Notably absent from its plans was legal defense or initiative. This may have been for lack of funds, or because Trotter felt the legal field was best left to the more high-powered and mostly white lawyers in the NAACP’s camp.28\n\nDuring the year, Guardian reports on Boston branch meetings of the NIPL showed the organization’s concerns. The national convention would “advise the race as to the position it should take in the presidential campaign of 1912 and lay plans for the enfranchisement of our people in states where they are disfranchised.” At an August meeting in Boston, New Yorker A. W. Whaley described a black revolt in the Republican Party when African-American applicants for clerkships were turned down. Only when the applicants threatened to vote for the Democrats did they get their jobs. The implication for national political strategy was clear. African-Americans had to play off one party against the other.29\n\nThe August 1911 NIPL convention was poorly attended and had a narrow speakers’ list. Not even the outrage over a Coatesville, Pennsylvania, lynching could swell the delegate size to over 150. Out-of-town orators included Waldron, Walters, S. L. Carrothers, and old ally Byron Gunner. The local speakers were Edward Everett Brown, representing Mayor John F. Fitzgerald; Albert Pillsbury, and Frank Sanborn. J. R. Clifford, an editor from West Virginia, was elected president. This weak showing revealed that the initiative had passed to the NAACP.30\n\nThese two national gatherings, both held in Boston and separated by half a year, may be seen as turning points in the relation between the two groups. Over the next few years, the counterposed strategies of the NIPL and the NAACP would be tested in practice. The failure of Trotter’s organization cannot be traced simply to his difficult personality, although that was a factor. Certainly, Trotter was overmatched by the wealth and access to power that the white leaders of the NAACP possessed. However, over the next decade, African-Americans would flood into the NAACP and take its leadership, bypassing Trotter. The main problem was that Trotter’s strategy led to a dead end.\n\nThe NIPL emerged from its desultory 1911 convention and wound up arguing for Taft against Roosevelt during the Republican campaign. This was the same Taft whose supporters Trotter characterized as race traitors in 1908, and the same Taft that Republican loyalist Booker T. Washington was backing. When Roosevelt formed the Progressive Party after the Republican convention, some civil rights leaders favored Roosevelt. Among those was J. R. Clifford, president of the NIPL. At a July 1912 meeting, therefore, the NIPL split. While individual NAACP leaders made their own presidential choices in 1912, the nonpartisan organization did not divide. Trotter, leading one of two groups claiming to be the NIPL, now turned to Democratic presidential candidate Woodrow Wilson. While the NAACP moved forward, the NIPL fragmented over which white presidential candidate to support.31\n\nTrotter’s group campaigned seriously for Wilson. One week after the inauguration Trotter wired the new president his congratulations. “As editor of the Guardian, which alone of the few national Negro newspapers unqualifiedly supported you, as President of the New England Suffrage League which endorsed you from a racial viewpoint, as corresponding secretary of the National Independent Political League . . . I did my utmost to further your election among the colored voters. . . . I greatly desire to have your confidence, and to know and be granted the privilege of consultation on your general policy where we are concerned.”32\n\nAlmost immediately after taking office, President Wilson presided over the segregation of the federal bureaucracy. His decision affirmed Jim Crow as federal policy. Trotter organized two delegations to Wilson, in 1913 and 1914, which brought no changes. Their first meeting was formally correct and Trotter reported it with cautious optimism. In the second meeting Trotter cut off a presidential monologue defending segregation as a boon to the Negro. “We didn’t come here as wards of the state,” Trotter interjected. Protesting that he had been branded as a race traitor for supporting Wilson (the shoe was now on the other foot), Trotter voiced his disillusionment. “Two years ago you were thought to be a second Abraham Lincoln,” he lamented. Wilson was aghast at Trotter’s bold manner, reprimanded him while complimenting the other delegates, and curtailed the interview. Trotter then gave his version of the supposedly confidential discussion to the press, further angering Wilson. If ever there was a case of defeat in victory, Trotter’s strategy had led to precisely that. The great irony of his career was that he wound up trying to play Booker Washington to Wilson’s Theodore Roosevelt.33\n\nThe effect of Trotter’s second interview upon his notoriety was spectacular. The story appeared in the leading national newspapers and in some Boston dailies elbowed aside the news of World War I and the conflict in Mexico. “President Rebukes Boston Spokesman,” the Boston Globe announced at the top of page one, placing Trotter’s picture there for probably the first time.34\n\nTrotter tried to capitalize on his new fame. The National Independent Equal Rights League (NIERL; successor to the NIPL) organized a midwestern speaking tour for him, during which he addressed sizable audiences. However, he could not convert these audiences into recruits. Trotter had no talent for building a national organization. Even if he had, it is not clear what that organization could now project. The NIERL replaced the NIPL because the latter organization’s support for Wilson was an embarrassment, but Trotter never offered a new strategy or acknowledged the failure of the old one. It should be recalled as well that Wilson was Trotter’s second presidential disillusionment. He had backed the winner in 1904 and got Roosevelt and Brownsville, but this time Trotter was notorious as a former Wilson man.35\n\nThus, with no viable strategy to counterpose to the NAACP, toward which Trotter remained neutral, the remainder of his career consisted of a series of isolated episodes. He returned from his Midwest tour to campaign against the film The Birth of a Nation when it opened in Boston. He participated in a series of local battles against discrimination in alliance with, but separate from, the NAACP. There was no space on the national stage for two distinct civil rights groups.\n\nRacial Politics, World War, Labor, and Black Nationalism\n\nThe death of Booker T. Washington in 1915, the American entry into World War I, the development of a northern black working class and the new rise of nationalism, including black nationalism, presented separate but related opportunities for Trotter to recast his policies. In all four instances he remained an isolated individual, going his own way. The death of his beloved wife and collaborator in 1918 only increased his solitude. Bypassed by larger events to which he could not respond creatively, Trotter apparently jumped (he may have simply fallen) to his death in 1934 on his sixty-second birthday.36\n\nTrotter deliberately stayed away from the summer 1916 Amenia Conference organized by the NAACP’s Joel Spingarn in the aftermath of Washington’s death. While the conference produced no new united organization of Bookerites and militants, it did clear the air and produce a spirit of harmony among race leaders. Trotter aimed simply to recruit to his own (renamed) National Equal Rights League, while a diverse group of Tuskegeans and Niagara men produced joint resolutions and attempted to bury past differences. In a sense, Trotter lost his reason for being with the death of Washington; it was opposition to accommodationist policies that had called the Guardian into print. Now he no longer had his opponent.37\n\nAmerican entry into the world war provoked a limited opposition by a small group of African-Americans. By a large majority, race leaders supported the war effort and hoped that prejudice would be retarded by the enthusiastic participation of African-Americans in the military. Most leaders agreed to abjure the struggle during the national emergency. Emmet J. Scott served as a special assistant to the secretary of war, essentially charged with organizing African-American support. Under Du Bois’s editorship, the Crisis agreed that the special demands of African-Americans could wait. The influential Chicago Defender and the New York Age led almost the entire African-American press along this line.38\n\nTrotter was a reluctant supporter of the war. The Guardian dispelled false rumors of pro-Germanism among Negroes and avowed the loyalty of the colored soldier. Unlike other African-American editors, however, he called for the government to fulfill its part of the bargain and grant civil rights. He argued that other aggrieved groups pursued a similar policy. On this issue, Trotter’s unique Boston location brought him in touch with another influence that his fellow race leaders did not encounter so directly. “White People Use War as Chance to Secure Redress and Benefits,” a Guardian headline announced over a story about Irish-American ambivalence regarding the war. “English Moved by Reluctance of Irish-Americans to Enlist Here,” ran the next headline. If there was only a germ of truth in this last pronouncement, Trotter was not loath to utilize it. In an editorial, he argued that Negro enlistment should be tied to the demand for justice at home. As the war effort unfolded, Trotter attacked the separate officer training for colored officers that some individual leaders of the NAACP accepted.39\n\nThis reaction to the war might have brought Trotter into sympathetic co-operation with either those NAACP leaders who opposed the war, or the new young militants like Chandler Owen and A. Philip Randolph who declared their opposition in the Messenger. Trotter did sponsor a meeting for Randolph in Boston and Randolph said he “was the only Negro who had the guts to join us on the platform.” Trotter had shown some openness to socialist ideas earlier in his career, having invited an African-American socialist to address the Boston Literary and Historical Society. Trotter did invite Randolph to participate in a delegation to President Calvin Coolidge in 1925. Unlike Randolph, however, Trotter did not take an interest in the labor movement. Here again, Trotter was probably influenced by his Boston environment. The number of African-American railroad workers, or white radical workers, was too small to attract him, unlike the situation in New York or Chicago. In addition, Trotter was a Harvard man and Randolph a poor migrant from Florida who had worked in kitchens and studied at City College. Trotter paid little heed to the labor movement.40\n\nThe last famous episode of Trotter’s career was his heroic, quixotic journey to Paris for the National Equal Rights League to represent the cause of African-Americans at the 1919 peace conference. The Wilson administration denied passports to nine NERL representatives but Trotter made his way overseas under an assumed name as a cook’s assistant. Arriving in Paris ille gally, hungry, penniless, and in rags, he nevertheless deluged the conference with requests for an audience. Ignored, he published articles in the French press on the true condition of African-Americans. When he returned to the United States, he addressed huge audiences in New York and Washington. Then, irony of ironies, he testified before Henry Cabot Lodge’s Foreign Relations Committee against the treaty brought home by President Woodrow Wilson. The Guardian had lambasted Lodge for his defense of the Brownsville dismissals, but Wilson was the bigger enemy now. Again, Trotter was unable to turn the notoriety of his exploits into a viable organization. This was Trotter’s last moment of national attention.”41\n\nDuring the 1917–20 period, Trotter developed a new theme in response to the nationalism unleashed by the war. He began to see oppression in international perspective, and to understand the similarities among other dispossessed groups. It was only natural that the ambivalent reaction of Boston’s Irish-American population to the peace treaty should cause Trotter to do this. As early as 1915, a representative of the Irish National League began speaking at his meetings. After the war, the Guardian covered the Irish-American opposition to the peace terms, pressing the lessons of the Irish struggle on its own constituency.42\n\nOn the other hand, Trotter was skeptical about Pan-Africanism and black nationalism. He held to the traditional stance derived from antebellum opposition to colonization schemes fostered by whites to banish African-Americans from America. He stressed the Americanism of his people, to whom he referred as “colored Americans,” “Negroes,” or “Negro-Americans.” In 1911 he answered a Boston Transcript editorial that wondered at the failure of American Negroes to “civilize” Liberia. He replied that “the colored people here, some of whose very distant relatives were natives of Africa, are Americans, not Africans, not anything else.” He stayed away from Du Bois’s Pan-Africanist conference in Paris in 1919. When Marcus Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association and its “back to Africa” campaign began, the Guardian publicly and deliberately dropped the term “Negro” from its columns.43\n\nYet, if Trotter was an integrationist, there is a sense in which he could also be seen as a nationalist. In his insistence upon African-American leadership of the struggle for equality, he foreshadowed the militant organizations of the 1950s and 1960s that bypassed the NAACP. Trotter accepted white members of his organization—the Reverend William Brigham was his lone conspicuous white follower—but the leadership was to be in African-American hands.\n\nLEADER OF BOSTON’S AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY\n\nMonroe Trotter played a powerful role on the national stage between 1903 and 1911, when the NAACP began to bypass his political organization. After that, his national influence was episodic. In Boston, he was the leader of the community at least through the struggle against The Birth of a Nation in 1915. Unlike the African-American leaders of the Boston NAACP, he earned his living in and depended upon the community for support, as subscribers to and advertisers in his paper. He had crucial backing from the clergy. The Guardian championed the cause of local African-Americans and reported on a range of issues important to them. Time and again he built spirited protests in Boston against the oppression of the race in the South. He participated vigorously in local politics, hoping to influence white leaders to act on behalf of the African-American community.\n\nTrotter made an inauspicious start in his relations with the community by promulgating the confrontation with Booker Washington. In Boston, the balance of forces between the two camps may be gauged by the audience at two meetings. Two thousand people came to hear Washington at the AME Zion Church, but not more than a handful of people took part in the disruption. After Trotter’s trial and monthlong confinement, he drew some two hundred people to a meeting celebrating his release.44\n\nRegardless of the politics of the two antagonists, it is likely that Trotter’s tactics only hurt his cause. He might have attempted a dignified and thoughtful critique of Washington’s policy from the floor, in the spirit of Du Bois’s Souls of Black Folk. Had he tried and failed, he would have shown up the controlling and repressive side of Washington’s behavior. That he chose to disrupt the meeting with catcalls showed the difference between him and Du Bois, who was ignorant of the event before the fact and disapproved of the tactics afterward.45\n\nThe white Boston press predictably painted Washington as the victim of an unruly assailant who demonstrated all the emotional qualities of an unstable race, which the wise leader was trying to raise up. The day before, Washington’s picture appeared in several newspapers that reported his speech at the nearby Weymouth “Town Day” celebration. Pictured along with the town fathers, Washington paid homage to a locale that had bravely sent its young men forth to the Civil War and its young women south to teach during Reconstruction.46\n\nThis harmonious scene contrasted sharply with the following day’s report of razors, police, tumult, and arrest among “a people quick in anger,” as the Globe reporter put it. After a description of the conflict, Washington’s reason able speech was reported at length. Urging the Bostonians to learn from thrifty Italian bootblacks who saved their money to go into business for themselves, he held up the wealthy tailor J. H. Lewis as “a great example of what we can do.” Washington even gave an anticlerical twist to this appeal to the Horatio Alger myth: “If the colored people of Boston owned as many shoe factories as they owned churches, I suspect that the race in this city would be advanced immensely.” He reminded his audience that he did not counterpose higher education to industrial education. According to the Boston Globe, Washington received a mighty ovation.47 Reaction quotations in the Globe and Boston Herald naturally favored Washington heavily. The Herald report began: “One of the most disgraceful scenes ever witnessed in Boston was the deliberate attempt of a few opponents of Booker T. Washington to break up the mass meeting.” Edward Everett Brown, an African-American attorney who was on the platform, probably spoke for a wide sector of the community when he said, “Before we can gain the respect of the Anglo-Saxon, we must merit their regard by our own actions.” The Boston Transcript weighed in with a similar account.48 This negative press coverage could only have alarmed and embarrassed black Bostonians, regardless of their opinions of Washington’s policy of accommodation.\n\nThe Washington confrontation also marked a turning point for Trotter in his relations with neo-abolitionists. The Garrison family turned sharply against Trotter, with Francis Jackson Garrison communicating his support immediately to Washington. Others, such as Albert E. Pillsbury, Moorfield Storey, and Richard P. Hallowell, were working in secret with Washington on civil rights cases and/or contributing articles to the pro-Washington Colored American Magazine.49\n\nDespite this controversial beginning, Trotter took leadership in the community for at least the next decade. The Guardian undoubtedly was crucial to his success. The newspaper functioned as a tribune of the people. While it focused on national politics, it also covered the Boston scene to the best abilities of its tiny staff. Sometimes this meant just clipping the Boston press and inserting hortatory headlines; sometimes the Trotters simply covered the activities of their own circle. The Guardian denounced police or popular brutality against colored people, maneuvered in local politics, followed deeper issues as they were presented to the Boston Literary and Historical Society, and reported the deeds of outstanding local African-Americans. Like any small-town editor in search of sales, Trotter printed an enormous number of names of ordinary people going about their quiet lives.\n\nThe Guardian criticized police brutality and racist violence episodically. In general, the Guardian praised Boston as a model of what the nation should be. However, Trotter was cognizant of police brutality and the concomitant image of the Negro as criminal promoted by the newspapers. The very first issue ran a small article attacking the Dorchester Beacon, which demanded a more severe penalty for a colored man who had killed a policeman. The Guardian pointed out that the policeman was off duty, out of uniform, and had attacked the man, who proved to be an imbecile. When a Boston patrolman assaulted and arrested an interracial couple, the Guardian demanded that the officer be disciplined. Years later, the Guardian chastised the police for failing to pursue several incidents in which white thugs, rumored to be a gang called “the Forty Thieves,” assaulted colored people. To offset reports of Negro criminality, the Guardian countered the hypocrisy of white newspapers by prominently and regularly reprinting reports of white crime with headlines calling attention to the race of the criminals.50\n\nIn local politics, Trotter campaigned for candidates who promised friendliness to the race, regardless of party. The Guardian rarely editorialized on nonracial issues such as the tariff, municipal reform, trust regulation, or foreign policy. This allowed him to support such diverse politicians as Republican Winthrop Murray Crane, and Democrat John F. Fitzgerald.\n\nTrotter first opposed Crane’s appointment to fill the Senate seat vacated by the death of anti-imperialist Republican George Frisbee Hoar. With a touch of condescension, Trotter dismissed Crane “even though he is a great friend of the race, although he has on occasion disappointed us,” as a poor orator. When Senator Crane resisted the Roosevelt-Lodge-Taft wing of the party after the Brownsville incident, Trotter began to champion his cause. Lodge induced Trotter’s disfavor when he gratuitously criticized the African-American regiment. Crane worked in the Senate to facilitate an inquiry into the affair, and Trotter began promoting him for president. He supported Crane’s reelection by the legislature in 1912, even though Crane had gone over to the Taft side (which Trotter himself did briefly), explaining that “the only way to have friends in politics is to establish the fact that you will support a friend when he is attacked.” If the race turned its back on Crane, “no white man will ever stand up for us in Congress.”51\n\nOn the Democratic side, John F. Fitzgerald was the municipal candidate who most consistently sought black votes as a way of tipping the balance in the factional jungle of party politics. As mayor he did not have to do much to win Trotter’s favor. At Trotter’s request, Fitzgerald lowered the city flags to half-staff in commemoration of the poet John Greenleaf Whittier’s centennial. He appointed Edward Everett Brown to the highest city post occupied by an African-American to that date, assistant health commissioner. At a Faneuil Hall election rally, the highlight of six addressed by the mayor in one day, Fitzgerald condemned the dismissal of the Brownsville troops. Trotter was conspicuously absent from a platform that included Brown, who had testified against him after the Boston Riot, and Archibald H. Grimké, who was working for Alexander’s Magazine. Nevertheless, the Guardian covered the meeting enthusiastically. When Republican George Hibbard ousted Fitzgerald, the Guardian noted with derision that his first act was to fire Brown.52 Trotter was generally in the Democratic camp between 1906 and 1914, from Brownsville to the second Wilson interview.\n\nThere is a certain amount of pathos in the energy Trotter extended in these electoral contests. The stakes for African-Americans were small, and in most cases merely symbolic. Such traditional patronage boons as jobs in municipal departments were not even on the agenda in this period. Treatment of African-Americans merited little attention from either politicians or the press. The very parsimony of the promises of white politicians suggests how counterproductive it was for Trotter to allow party loyalties to separate him from Clement Morgan or Butler Wilson, who were steadfast Republicans.\n\nTrotter placed his stamp on the consciousness of the community by acting as high priest of its secular ritual: the Faneuil Hall indignation meeting. Trotter himself usually spoke only briefly at these events, which suggests that his oratorical powers were pale in comparison with the more practiced skills of the clergy. These meetings were organized thematically around a particular outrage, electoral opportunity, or centennial observation. Prominent whites usually spoke along with African-American community leaders to largely black audiences. The meetings were generally well attended and spirited. The Guardian would advertise their coming weeks in advance and report them effusively, while the white press would dutifully record the event on inside pages.\n\nOne typical meeting, held in May 1902, called for the passage of the Crumpacker Resolution to reduce the congressional representation of those states that disfranchised African-American voters. A speaker from South Carolina denounced a recent lynching there. Trotter used the occasion for a factional attack on Booker Washington. The Reverend William Scott of Woburn, speaking for the Massachusetts Racial Protective Association, read messages of support from the Reverend Johnson W. Hill, a Trotter ally; E. D. Crumpacker of Indiana, sponsor of the resolution; Governor Crane; former governor George S. Boutwell; Moorfield Storey; and others. Edward Everett Brown, Archibald Grimké, Massachusetts Congressman William H. Moody, and former governor John Quincy Adams Brackett spoke. Edwin B. Jourdain of New Bedford presented a resolution that called on the administration to protect the civil and political rights of Negroes, and asked the colored voters of Massachusetts to support only candidates who backed the bill.53\n\nBoutwell and Brackett shared the platform two years later when the Boston Suffrage League attacked Republican backsliding on Negro suffrage. The Guardian boasted that it was a “monster mass meeting.” Clement Morgan was in the chair, and Butler Wilson, the Reverend Francis H. Rowley, and the Reverend Byron Gunner of Newport, Rhode Island, spoke. This meeting showed that within a year of the Boston Riot, Trotter had recaptured the initiative and could still stage significant meetings attracting prominent speakers and large audiences.54\n\nIn 1905, Trotter celebrated William Lloyd Garrison’s centennial, despite the hostility that he had engendered among the abolitionist’s children. The Bookerites had the upper hand in that Garrison’s descendants were in their camp. Trotter tried to effect at least a truce, seeking a photo of Garrison père from fils Francis Jackson, who extracted a promise of nonsectarianism from Trotter. “Trotter is inviting [William H.] Lewis to speak as a token of his non-partisanship,” Francis Garrison reported to his nephew Oswald Garrison Villard, along with the news of Butler Wilson’s inclination to boycott both sides. Wilson was to preside over a united meeting on 10 December at the Joy Street Church, which Garrison decided to address after some hesitation. The moderate group gathered at the AME Zion Church to hear Fanny Villard, Frank Sanborn, Moorfield Storey, Archibald Grimké, James H. Wolff, the commander of the Massachusetts Grand Army of the Republic (who was African-American), and a Tuskegee representative. Trotter held ceremonies at the Garrison gravesite and statue, and at St. Monica’s Home for Sick Colored Women. He sponsored two meetings at Faneuil Hall, which heard Garrison family members, Boston Transcript editor E. H. Clement, Boston Herald editor William Allen, and a host of others. Reverdy Ransom was the keynote speaker, and the Guardian reported all events in glowing terms.55\n\nThese meetings, along with others like the 1907 Elijah Lovejoy and 1911 Sumner celebrations, showed that Trotter had important allies in the African-American community and could build successful community gatherings. White supporters of civil rights generally tried not to take sides, and even after the NAACP’s founding they did not universally disdain Trotter’s invitations to speak. Moorfield Storey, for example, was particularly sensitive to Trotter’s authority in the black community and urged New York NAACP leaders in 1911 not to attack him.56 During the 1915 fight against Birth of a Nation, Trotter was the one who mobilized the community, while the NAACP leaders handled the legal representation before Mayor James Michael Curley, Governor David I. Walsh, and others. That episode will be discussed in the following chapter, and shows that black Bostonians still looked to Trotter for leadership. In other cities, African-Americans were turning to the NAACP, or, a few years later, to nationalism.\n\nWhile Trotter had needlessly antagonized many people in both the Bookerite and NAACP camps, he had also made and kept many close allies among the African-American clergy, some attorneys, women’s club leaders and fraternal lodge men. The church leaders were the most important of this group. Time and again, the Reverends William Scott of Woburn, Reverdy Ransom of the Charles Street AME Church, M. A. N. Shaw of the Twelfth Baptist, Byron Gunner of distant Newport, Rhode Island, and Johnson W. Hill spoke on Trotter’s behalf, and probably mobilized their parishioners. Women’s club leaders like M. Cravath Simpson and Elks leader Alfred P. Russell probably also brought their sisters and brothers.57 The movement that Trotter led was rooted in the community, and from it his inspiration sprung.\n\nTrotter’s local supporters were activists who made their way to Boston, usually from the South, and were probably overawed by Trotter’s Harvard background, driving energy, and principled politics. If they were not necessarily his intellectual equals, neither were they his lieutenants or creations. As community ministers they were talented individuals in their own right.\n\nScott, Trotter’s most loyal supporter, was born a slave in Faquier Co., Virginia, in 1848, ran away during the Civil War and attached himself to the Twelfth Massachusetts Regiment as a quartermaster’s boy. After the war he was ordained as a Baptist minister and pastored in Virginia, then Lawrence and Woburn, Massachusetts. Along with George Forbes, he and Trotter founded the Guardian, and he appeared at Trotter’s side as a key ally until Scott’s death in 1910.58\n\nJohnson W. Hill, another Virginian, studied in his home state and then at Harvard, Brown, and Newton Theological. In 1898 he became the pastor at the Twelfth Baptist Church, Trotter’s favorite venue after Faneuil Hall. He was with Trotter at the Booker Washington confrontation and on the platform at many Trotter meetings.59\n\nMathew Arnold N. Shaw took over at Twelfth Baptist, perhaps after Hill became a medical doctor in 1908, and his name appeared frequently in the Guardian until his death in 1924. In 1919, for example, the Guardian devoted much of its front page to a Shaw speech calling for self-defense against lynching, contrasting Shaw’s address to a more cautious one by Du Bois. Byron Gunner was born in Marion, Alabama, in 1857, educated at Talladega and Oberlin, and became a Congregational minister at Hillburn, New York. For a while he was president of Trotter’s National Equal Rights League.60\n\nProbably the best orator among Trotter’s supporters was Reverdy C. Ran som. Ransom was born in 1861 in Ohio, educated at Oberlin and Wilberforce, and held challenging posts as an AME minister in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Chicago before coming to New Bedford, and then to Boston in 1905. He was the keynote speaker at the Garrison memorial and other meetings.61\n\nTaken as a group, these ministers generally came from lower socioeconomic origins than the Boston elite African-American community leaders. The activists with whom Trotter could not work included people like attorneys Clement Morgan, Archibald Grimké, and Butler Wilson. These three had abilities equal to Trotter’s and important ties to white people. George Forbes and William Henry Lewis, southern migrants of humble origin like Trotter’s allies, worked briefly with Trotter, but had professions that carried them away from the community—Forbes as a librarian and literary man, Lewis as an attorney. Neither those people who gravitated toward Booker Washington (like Grimké for a few years between 1904 and 1906) nor those who like Wilson, Morgan, or later Grimké, joined the NAACP, were so rooted in the community as Trotter’s clerical supporters.62"
