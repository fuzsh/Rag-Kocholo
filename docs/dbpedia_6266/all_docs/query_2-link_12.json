His father was James Wilson Baldridge, and his mother, Margaret McVey. For further information as to his ancestry, we refer to the sketch herein of his brother, James W. Baldridge.\n\nOur subject spent his boyhood on his father's farm, (now his,) and received a common school education. On Nov. 3, 1881, he was married to Mary Emma, daughter of James and Elizabeth McCutcheon, of Manchester, Ohio. they have five children: Delos, Delva, Florence, Blanchard, and John, all of great promise. In his political views, Mr. Baldridge is a Republican. He is one of the thoroughly reliable men of Wayne Township. He is observant of everything in the community and is remarkably energetic. He is prompt in all his engagements and honest in all his dealings with others. He has never sought a place in, and would not become a part of, the administration of public affairs, but he exerts a strong and beneficial interest in his community. He is deeply interested in public education and is an earnest advocate and supporter of whatever is for the good of the public. He is a member of the United Presbyterian Church of Cherry Fork, and a ruling elder therein. He performs his duty in that office with the same zeal and earnestness which he gives to all he does. As a farmer, he is a model for all of the name. He makes farming an honor, a pleasure, and a success. He is always ready to give any good cause a helping hand. He is a man of strong convictions and of the strictest fidelity in every relation of life. He is respected as a man, esteemed as a citizen, admired as a farmer, and relied upon as a true Christian. No one in his community stands any higher than he, and no one is more deserving of such estimation.\n\nSource: History of Adams County, Ohio from its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time - by Nelson W.

Stivers - 1900 ~ Page 697 SAMUEL TURNER BALDRIDGE was born Feb. 17, 1824, in Wayne Township, Adams County, Ohio, and lived there all his life with the exception of a year and a half in Brown County. His father was born in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, in 1873, and his mother, Mary McGary, was a daughter of William McGary, a Revolutionary soldier, and one of the first settlers of Adams County.\n\nHe was married Oct. 23, 1845, first to Phoebe Patton, a daughter of Thomas Patton, a native of Rockbridge County, Virginia, who settled on the West Fork of Brush Creek. Of this marriage there were three children: Mrs. Mary J. Foutts, of Elsmere, Missouri; Thomas Albert, who died at the age of two years, and an infant. His first wife died Aug. 3, 1850. He married for a second wife, in1861, Sarah Russel. Her mother was a Puntenney, of Stout's Run. His son, Taylor R., is a well known physician and surgeon in Dayton. His second son, by his second marriage, Talma E., after having completed his studies as a physician and married, died suddenly in the year 1896.\n\nOur subject has been an elder in the U. P. Church at Cherry Fork for thirty years and has been Clerk of Wayne Township for twenty-four years. He was a Free Soiler during the existence of that party and afterwards a Republican. He died the eighth of June, A. D. 1899.\n\nMr. Baldridge had taken quite an interest in this work and had anticipated much pleasure in its publication, but he was never to read its pages. Those who knew him best say that his passing was the beautiful completion of a finished work. His hold on this world was greatly loosened by the sorrow on account of the untimely death of his son, Talma. His life was a finished example of purity, fidelity and piety. He was a true friend, a wise counsellor, an unselfish man, and a noble citizen. He left a memory which his family, his church, and his community can reflect upon with pleasure and pride.

Stivers - 1900 ~ Page 681 REV. WILLIAM BALDRIDGE. The Reverend William Baldridge was born in Lancaster County, Penn., Feb. 26, 1761. His parents were from Ireland and members of the Irish Covenanter Church. The year after his birth they removed to the banks of the Catawba River in Lincoln County, N. C., where he resided until 1776, when he joined a cavalry company and served as a soldier during the Revolutionary War. Of this period of his life, the most interesting of all, we have no record, but from the course of his afterlife, we known that he did his duty as a soldier, conscientiously, and faithfully. He did not consider that in his seven years' service to his country, he had done more than his duty or that he deserved any special commendation therefor. After returning from the war, he prepared for college under the instructions of Rev. Robert Finley, and attended Dickinson College in Carlisle, Penn., where he graduated in 1790 at the head of a class of twelve. Immediately after his graduation, he took up the study of theology, privately, with the Rev. Alexander Dobbins and studied under him one year. The second year of his theological studies he pursued under the Reverend Doctor Nesbit, of Carlisle, Pa. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Pennsylvania, Associate Reformed, in 1792, and ordained by the same Presbytery in 1793. On July 17, 1792, he was married to Rebecca Agnew. She was born Dec. 12, 1772.\n\nOn Oct. 8, 1793, he accepted a call to two churches in Rockbridge County, Virginia. One of them was a mile from the Natural Bridge. It has long since disappeared, the building destroyed and the congregation dissolved. He labored as regular pastor of these two churches, both Associate Reformed, until 1803 when his pastoral relation to them was dissolved, but what was an anomaly in Presbyterian practice, he remained their stated supply until 1809, when he removed to Adams County, Ohio, to accept a call as pastor to the Cherry Fork and West Fork congregations. In 1797, he was moderator of his synod and delivered an important judicial decision in a case before that body. During his residence in Virginia, he was twice offered the presidency of Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, but declined each time on the ground that it was his duty, as he saw it, to remain in the pastoral work. From 1803 to 1809, many of his congregation had emigrated from Virginia and located in Adams County, Ohio, at either Cherry Fork or West Fork. These former parishioners of his secured his call to the two churches of the two localities. During his residence in Virginia, he had been a faithful and acceptable pastor and had endeared himself to his people, and while there, the following children were born to him and his devoted wife: James R., May 22, 1793; Alexander H., Jan. 13, 1795; John Y., Dec. 20, 1796; William S., May 1, 1799; Samuel C., and Rebecca G., twins, Feb. 18, 1801; David A., May 25, 1803; Wade, Aug. 25, 1805; Agnew, Dec. 5, 1807. With these eight boys and one girl and his wife, he made the journey overland to Ohio, in June 1809, and locating at Cherry Fork at the age of 49. He spent the remainder of his life there. The following children were born to him and his wife, Rebecca, in Ohio: Joseph G., June 16, 1810; Ebenezer W., Aug. 1, 1812; William, Aug. 17, 1814; Mary Jane, Oct. 26, 1817, at whose birth the mother died. This daughter, Mrs. Mary Jane Waller, a widow, is now living with her daughter, Mrs. Julia Tappan, at Avondale, Ohio, the last survivor of her brothers and sisters.\n\nOn May 16, 1820, Rev. William Baldridge married Mrs. Mary Logan Anderson, a widow, and by her became the father of two children, Benjamin L., born Feb. 9, 1821, and Nancy M., Oct. 18, 1822. His daughter, Rebecca, married Joseph Riggs, Dec. 8, 1819, a very prominent citizen of southern Ohio, and by him became the mother of a numerous family of sons and daughters, the former of whom and their descendants have distinguished themselves in financial circles, in the ministry, at the bar and on the bench. Of the Reverend Baldridge's sons, Samuel C. and Benjamin L. became ministers of Alexander H., Agnew and Ebenezer W. became physicians. Of the literary works of the Rev. Baldridge, we have but three sermons which were published in the Associate Reformed Pulpit. These indicate that he was a fine sermonizer. But he especially excelled in pastoral work. Heknew all the members of his congregation, and all their children by name, and knew their peculiarities. He made his pastoral visits regularly in each family and gave religious instructions in such manner as to make it attractive, and to fasten it to remain in the minds of those he visited. The Rev. Marion Morrison, now residing at Mission Creek, Nebraska, relates an incident of one of his visits to his father's, Judge Morrison's house, in which he heard a conversation between an older brother and the Rev. Baldridge, in which the latter sought to induce his brother to take a college education with a view of entering the ministry. This conversation so impressed young Morrison, then eight years of age, that he, in consequence thereof, took a college education and entered the ministry where he has labored successfully all his life. The Rev. Baldridge died in the midst of his labors on Oct. 26, 1830.\n\nSixty-nine years having elapsed since his death, oblivion has claimed much that we would like to know of him, but the fact that he held but two pastorates in his lifetime; that he resigned the first and that death alone removed him from the other, speaks well of him as a minister. Sixteen years in the same churches in Rockbridge County, Virginia, and twenty-one in Adams County, Ohio, covered his ministerial work. He preached well in the pulpit and cared well and effectually for his people in their homes. The fact that Cherry Fork church grw and prospered during and after his labors in it speaks well for his work. The fact that for years last and that today the church at Cherry Fork is large and prosperous; that its influence is well recognized in the county and in its Presbytery and Synod; that it has sent out so many grand men and women to other parts of the country, is largely due to the labors of the Rev. William Baldridge between 1809 and 1830. He took the church four years after its organization and builded it for twenty-one years.\n\nBut while he was an efficient pastor, teacher and guide in the churches for thirty-seven years, he did something even greater than that. He reared a family of twelve sons and two daughters to be godly men and women, to be good citizens and to take honorable and prominent places in the world's work. Moreover, he laid the foundations of character in his sons and daughters, so deep, so wide, so strong in piety and moral truth that after seventy years, his descendants are men and women of the same stamp of moral worth, high character and sterling piety that he bore himself. Could he have done better as a life work than herein related? We think not. He performed his work so well and so thoroughly that it will last so long as descendants of his survive to illustrate and exemplify it. He sleeps in an unknown and unmarked grave in the Cherry Fork Cemetery.\n\nSource: History of Adams County, Ohio from its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time - by Nelson W. Evans and Emmons B. Stivers - West Union, Ohio - Published by E. B. Stivers - 1900 ~ Page 506 MICHAEL BALDWIN was a very marked and memorable member of our earliest bar. He came of a Connecticut family of note. One brother, Henry Baldwin, of Pennsylvania, was one of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States; another, a wealthy planter of Tennessee; a third lived in Connecticut.\n\nMichael was admitted to practice here in 1799, and at once forced recognition of his energy, learning and sparkling intellectual gifts; and almost as speedily developed his uncontrollable love of liquor, fun and frolic. He soon distanced all competitors for legal business save William Creighton, Jr., whose patient industry still retained him the larger and by- far more lucrative practice. As between the two, it was the race between the hare and the tortoise again, and with the same inevitable result. One of the malicious stories of that day was, that certain other lawyers became so jealous of Baldwin's popularity and business success, that they encouraged the latter's passion for drink, so that his career might be shortened as much as possible.\n\nIn 1803, '4. '5, and '6, Baldwin, notwithstanding his dissipation, did a large amount of work. But from the latter date, there is a rapid decadence of his practice apparent in the records of the Court, and by 1808, his name but rarely appears, save only as defendant in suits for tavern bills, borrowed money, and applications for the benefit of the insolvent law. We learn from Safford's \"Life of Herman Blennerhasset\" that Baldwin bad been the United States Marshal for the State of Ohio, and that he was much embittered against President Jefferson for depriving him of that office. Aaron Burr advised Blennerhasset to retain Judge Jacob Burnett, of Cincinnati, and Baldwin, for the defense of both themselves in the trials for high treason, which they expected to undergo before the courts of Ohio, but which trials never took place. In a letter written to his wife, under date of Dec. 17, 1807. Blennerhasset says: \"I have retained Baldwin and Burnett. The latter will be a host with the decent part of the citizens of Ohio; and the former a giant of influence with the rabble, whom he properly styles his 'bloodhounds.' \"\n\nIt is very suggestive of the character of Baldwin, that at almost every term of his practice we find this entry upon the journal: \"Ordered that Michael Baldwin, one of the attorneys of this Court, be fined ten dollars for contempt of Court, and be committed to jail until the fine be paid.\" Poor, brilliant, boisterous, drunken, rollicking Mike! By reason of commitments for contempt of court and capiases for debt, he became familiar indeed, with the inside of the old jail which stood at the northwest corner of Second and Walnut Streets.\n\nHe was a member of the Constitutional Convention and tradition asserts that he wrote almost the entirety of the first Constitution of Ohio in the bar-room of William Keys' tavern, using a wine keg for his seat, and the head of a barrel of whiskey for his desk. A queer origination, truly, for the organic law of such an empire as Ohio grew to be, before that Constitution was superseded!\n\nHe was Speaker of the House of Representative in1803, 1804 and 1805. Fond of gambling, of course, for he seems to have had all the modern accomplishments. It is told that he opened a game of vingt et un for the benefit of such members as craved excitement. Baldwin, being baker and dealer, of course, won all their money and most of their watches. The party broke up and went to their several rooms, drunk, long after the \"wee sma' hours\" of the night.\n\nMike, used to such life, was in the Speaker's chair, on time, next morning, rapped the House to order, and proceeded with business. A call of the House was soon demanded, and the fact made officially apparent that there was no quorum present. The Speaker sent out the Sergeant-at-Arms for absentees, and that officer, in the course of an hour or two, filed into the hall and in front of the Speaker's chair, some dozen or more of the half-asleep, and only partially sobered, gamesters of the nigh before. Thereupon Baldwin rose, and with dignified severity of manner, began to reprimand them for their negligence of the trusts reposed in them by their constituents, and reminded them of the great cost per diem to the infant State, of the sessions of the General Assembly, etc., until one of the party of culprits broke abruptly in upon the harrangue, with the exclamation, \"Hold on now, Mr. Speaker! how the hell can we know what time it is, when you have got all our watches!\"\n\nAt the June Term, 1804, the tavern-keeper, William Keys, sued Baldwin upon an account which aggregated twenty-five pounds, thirteen shillings, ten pence, a copy of which account is filed. Every item in it, save three, was for drinks in one form or another - brandy, spirits raw, bowls of toddy, punch, treats to the club, etc. The three exceptional items of suppers for himself, for which he was charged one shilling and six pence for each. But with each supper there appears a charge of three schillings for a pint and a half of brandy - a proportion of drink to meat which strongly reminds one of the bill rendered by Dame Quickley to Sir John Falstaff.\n\n\"Drinks for the Club\" were undoubtedly Mike's treats to the \"Bloodhounds,\" an organization of the rough and fighting men of that day, which Baldwin had gotten up and which he controlled. The \"Bloodhounds\" did his electioneering and fighting for him; and more than once delivered him from the jail by breaking in the door, or tearing an end out of that structure.\n\nHis brothers twice attempted to relieve him from the embarrassments of his debts, and for that purpose, sent him bags of coin amounting to a considerable sum. On these occasions, it is said he hired a negro for porter of the money, and went around to his creditors seritim, allowing each one irrespective of the amount of his account, to have one grab into the open-mouthed bag until it was gone.\n\nHis name appears in the records of the court for the last time in the early part of 1811, and he undoubtedly died soon thereafter.\n\nHis widow survived him for many years, and when not less than seventy years old, contracted a second marriage with Adam Stewart, of this county. An old citizen, speaking to us of \"Kitty Baldwin\" in her prime, remarked, \"I tell you, she was the proudest widow that ever walked the streets of Chillicothe.\n\nSource: History of Adams County, Ohio from its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time - by Nelson W.

Stivers - 1900 ~ Page 508 NELSON BARRERE was born near Newmarket, Highland County, Ohio, Apr. 1, 1808, and was the seventh of twelve children. His father was George W. Barrere, a very prominent citizen of Highland County. He was a deputy surveyor, justice of the peace, member of the Ohio senate nine years and an associate judge of Highland County for fourteen years. He was in the Indian War, 1791-1795. Was in St. Clair\\s defeat and Wayne's victory. He was also in the War of 1812 at Hull's surrender, and was in every public enterprise in Highland County until his death in 1839. His son, Nelson, lived on the farm until eighteen years of age and attended school in the matters. He spent a year in the Hillsboro High School and in 1827 entered the freshman class at Augusta College. He graduated from there in 1830, finishing a four years' course in three and a half years.\n\nIn 1831, he began the study of law in Hillsboro with Judge John W. Price and was admitted to the bar on Dec. 23, 1833. He opened an office in Hillsboro and remained there nine months. He located in West Union in 1834, forming a partnership with Samuel Brush. This partnership continued for a year. He remained in West Union eleven years altogether and had a large and lucrative practice. He had the confidence of the people. He represented Adams County in the lower house of the legislature at the thirty-sixth legislative session from Dec. 4, 1837, to Mar. 4, 1838. In 1846 he removed his residence to Highland County and continued there until his death. In the thirty-seventh congress, he represented the sixth district, composed of Adams, Clermont, Brown and Highland counties from Mar. 4, 1851, to Mar. 4, 1853. In 1853 he was the Whig candidate for governor but was defeated receiving 85,817 votes, while his competitor, William Medill, received 147,663. When the Whig party dissolved, he went over to the Democratic party, in which he remained during the remainder of his life, but during the Civil War, he supported the Republican administration. In 1870, he was a candidate for congress on the Democratic ticket, but was defeated. He was the Democratic candidate from Highland County for member of the constitutional convention in 1875 and was defeated by one vote. He never married. He continued in the active practice of the law until his death, which occurred Aug. 20, 1883.\n\nIn Adams County, during his residence there, he was very popular. He was always conspicuous for his public spirit. As a lawyer he was energetic and industrious. He was a safe and reliable counsellor and an eloquent and successful advocate. He was always agreeable and courteous in his manners. In West Union, he formed many warm friendships, and he, Joseph Allen Wilson, Davis Darlinton and others had a club at Darlinton's store, to which they resorted of evenings and spent many pleasant hours. Joseph Wes Lafferty and John Fisher, of Cedar Mills, were two of his most particular friends in Adams County.\n\nSource: History of Adams County, Ohio from its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time - by Nelson W. Evans and Emmons B. Stivers - West Union, Ohio - Published by E. B. Stivers - 1900 ~ Page 310 LEVIN BELT was a practicing lawyer in Chillicothe, under the Territorial Government. He was born in England, but the date of his birth has not been preserved. He was admitted to practice law, and took the oath of office at Washington, Adams County, Mar. 2, 1802. He was the first prosecuting attorney of Ross County, and was allowed from $15 to $50 per term for his services. In June, 1804, he was elected presiding judge of the second circuit, in place of Wylliss Silliman, resigned. He served until February, 1805, when Robert F. Slaughter was elected to succeed him. On Jan. 9, 1807, Robert F. Slaughter was removed by impeachment, and Levin Belt was elected and succeeded him Feb. 7, 1807. He served until February 10, 1810, when he was succeeded by John Thompson. It is said he was a reasonably good and satisfactory judge of the common pleas, but that he failed as a practitioner at the bar. From the bench he descended to the mayoralty of Chillicothe, and in that office and that of justice of the peace, he served many years. while he was a justice of the peace, there was a statute in force forbidding licensed attorneys to appear before justices of the peace. Soon after this, Mr. Richard Douglas, an attorney of Chillicothe, appeared before him to argue a motion to dismiss a case. Squire Belt said, \"Dick, Dick, don't you know the law? You must not appear before me. Get behind me and make your speech.\" Douglas complied with his order, and got behind the justice and made his speech.\n\nMr. Belt was tall, broad-shouldered, muscular, without surplus flesh, dark brown hair sprinkled only with gray, and somewhat ruddy complexion. His presence as a justice in the exercise of his office was awe-inspiring. He removed from Chillicothe to Washington City in 1828, and died there soon after. The first case submitted to him in Muskingum County in 1804 was Samuel Connar, plaintiff, against James Sprague, defendant, in slander. Damages claimed, $500. Verdict for the plaintiff, $300.\n\nSource: History of Adams County, Ohio - by Nelson W. Evans and Emmons B. Stivers  West Union, Ohio - Published by E. B.

He died Aug. 13, 1813, in the army and is buried at Urbana. His widow was married June 1, 1815, to Col. Samuel R. Wood, by whom she had five children, Mrs. Rev. Lock, of Illinois; Mrs. Herdman, of Iowa; David Wood, of Newport, Ky., and Frank Wood, of Urbana, Ohio. David, the brother of our subject, who married a daughter of Rev. John Meek, lived and died in West Union. He, his father, General Bradford and his mother, Barbara Grimes, are buried in the stone enclosure in Branson's field just north of the village cemetery at West Union. General David Bradford was one of the most important factors in the early settlement of Adams County. He owned a number of lots in the town of Washington and resided there while it flourished, and when it collapsed he went to West Union. When West Union was located he bought lots 10, 11, 18, 19, 65, and 75 at the opening sale. He built the Bradford House in 1804 and, from that time until his death, kept tavern there. He was Country Treasurer of Adams County from June 6, 1800, until June 6, 1832. As he died in 1834 at the age of sixty-nine, he very nearly had the treasurer's office for life. In 1804, he was made a Quartermaster General of the militia. He was a very popular man, and form holding the County Treasurership so long without any complaint, must have been a very honest one, but we must get back to our subject, his grand-son, Samuel G. Bradford. He clerked in an iron store in Cincinnati when he was about nineteen years of age for James M. Baldridge. When he was twenty years of age, he returned to West Union. He was married here on Nov. 6, 1834, to Amanda M. T. Tapp. By her, he had six children, Francis A. wife of Henry B. Woodrow, of Cincinnati; James H. Bradford of Winchester; Jennie, the wife of Gabriel McClatchy; Matilda, who died a young woman; Harriet, widow of Capt. George Collings, of Indianola, Iowa, and Samuel N. Bradford, who lives in West Union. In the same year, he succeeded to the management of Bradford's Tavern, now the Downing Hose. He conducted it until 1840, when he leased it. He contributed $200 to the erection of the Maysville and Zanesville Turnpike. In 1835, he took a drove of horses to Mississippi and sold them. On his return, he purchased the George Darling farm, formerly owned by Major Finley and moved there. His wife died May 2, 1847. In 1849, he returned to West Union and engaged in the tannery business with Edwards Darlinton.\n\nOn Oct. 29, 1850, he was married to Miss Sarah W. Smashea who survives him. He continued the tannery business until 1851, when he drove a notion wagon through the country until 1853. From that date until 1863, he traveled and sold tinware for A. F. Shriver at Manchester. In 1864, he went into the sutler business with Thomas Ellison and remained with him until the end of the war. Then he went to Mississippi and raised cotton until 1868. After that, he engaged in the grocery business at West Union with his son, Samuel N. Bradford. After continuing that business for a short time, he took the mail contract between West Union and Winchester and drove a hack on it for four years. After that he conducted a livery stable in West Union until his death which occurred Nov. 29, 1890.\n\nIn politics, he was a Whig and afterward a Republican. He was a large, fine looking man in old age, and in youth, he was handsome. He was genial and companionable. He was always ready to do a kind act for a friend. He was esteemed highly by all who knew him as a good man and upright citizen. What characterized him above his fellow men was his love of children and of horses. When surrounded by children and encouraging their amusement, he was never happier. He was always pleased to have good horses and to be looking after them. He was in his feelings and in his thoughts a relic of the older time in which he was always delighted to dwell. He passed away in peaceful sleep - \"as one who wraps the drapery of his couch about him and lies down to pleasant dreams.\n\nSource: History of Adams County, Ohio from its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time - by Nelson W.

He is a son of Purnel Brittingham and Mary Bryan, whose maiden name was Cartwright, a daughter of Rev. Andrew Cartwright, a celebrated divine in early days in Adams County. Purnel Brittingham was of Scotch descent, born 1782, and died in 1872. He was a soldier in the War of 1812. The subject of our sketch worked as a farm hand in Ross County, Ohio, in his youth, and in 1862, volunteered in the Seventh Ohio Cavalry, Col. Israel Garrard, and served until the close of the war, taking part in every important battle in which his regiment engaged.\n\nIn 1850, he was married to Mary E. Trotter, daughter of James Trotter, of near West Union. After the war, he kept a small store at Killinstown, and in 1868 conducted a general store at Clayton, moving to Manchester in 1870, where for twenty years he has been in the hotel business. During this time he has handled live stock and produce, and for six seasons sold lightning rods throughout the country. He is at present interested in the buying and shipping of leaf tobacco.\n\nIn 1884, he was nominated on the Democratic ticket for the office of Sheriff of Adams county, but was defeated by a few votes through the treachery of some persons who should have been his staunch supporters if fidelity to party and party principles count for aught. By his energy and integrity he has acquired a competency to support himself and wife in their declining years.\n\nSource: History of Adams County, Ohio from its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time - by Nelson W. Evans and Emmons B. Stivers - West Union, Ohio - Published by E. B. Stivers - 1900 ~ Page 684 JACOB NEWTON BROWN, son of James and Maria Brown, was born in Adams County, Ohio, on the banks of the Cherry Fork about two miles eastwardly from the town of North Liberty, on Oct. 19, 1828.\n\nHe received a common school education and for a while taught in the county schools. He afterward embarked in the mercantile business in North Liberty in a small building adjoining the site now occupied by Kleinknecht Bros. In 1860 he erected the commodious building now occupied by this firm. He was doing business in this house during the Civil War and at the time when the Confederate General, John Morgan, and his troops passed through on their their famous raid. They broke into his store, robbed and despoiled his goods, stole his horses, etc. He formed a partnership with Wm. McVey, and after continuing same for several years, he sold his interest in the store and bought the North liberty Flour Mills. He successfully operated these mills until 1876, when he exchanged them, together with his handsome brick residence and a farm lying northeast of the town, for a large tract of Arkansas land. He then became connected with the Southern Immigration business and as agent of the Little Rock & Ft. Smith R. R., and afterward as Immigration Agent of the Cincinnati Southern R. R., which place he held at the time of his death. In 1881, in connection with J. Frank, in Cincinnati, he established an office in Chattanooga, Tenn., which he afterward sold to his son C. V. Brown and S. W. Divine, but retained his office in Cincinnati in connection with the Cincinnati Southern R. R. He was one of the pioneers in Southern Immigration work, and hundreds of Northern families now living in the South were located through his influence. He was indefatigable in his efforts to promote Southern immigration.\n\nHe retained his residence at North Liberty until about 1883, when he removed his family to Cincinnati and there resided until his death, Jan, 27, 1892. He was a consistent member of the Presbyterian Church and a man of strong convictions, always on the side of right, and an upright and worthy citizen in every way.\n\nIn 1852, he married Sarah McCutcheon of near Manchester in this county and seven children were born to them, to-wit: Nancy J., now the wife of Dr. E. M. Gaston, of Tranquility; Maria M., wife of S. G. Glasgow, of North Liberty; Ella, wife of William Kennedy, living near Youngsville; Mary E., deceased; Ida V., wife of William Kleinknecht, of North Liberty, and C. V. and B. G. Brown, of Chattanooga, Tennessee. His widow, Sarah Brown, died in North Liberty on Aug. 3, 1899.\n\nJacob N. Brown was in many respects a remarkable man, but the world never knew of it from him, and what he had achieved would never have been known except the writer of these lines discovered it in a business way. When Mr. Brown left North Liberty, he had a mountain of debt which he was earning and of which the public or the world had no idea. To the world he was and had been a success, but to retrieve his losses, he went away from the home of his lifetime, went into a new and untried business and made large sums of money. He paid off his entire indebtedness with interest and died without the world ever knowing that he had almost been overtaken by financial disaster. There is not one man in a thousand who would have undertaken, and not one man in ten thousand who would have succeeded in paying the immense debt he owed, but he did it and the world never knew and has not known it until the publication of this book, and it would not now be made public but that the lesson of his life was most valuable and might encourage some one overwhelmed with adversity to bear it without murmuring and to conquer it with that power of will and tireless energy which overcomes all difficulties. Mr. Brown never knew that the writer was informed of his financial condition, but the writer knew why he left North Liberty and went elsewhere to work with that remarkable application which characterized him and the end he had in view, and therefore takes pleasure in making this tribute to his manly qualities. In all the years in which he was working to discharge his great debt, he supported and educated his large family, lived honorably in the world and took prompt care of every current obligation. In all that time, he never complained of or alluded to his burden, and to the world he was the same as if he had not owed a dollar and had thousands ahead. How many men can do that? How many men have done that? It is the aggregate of such lives as that of Jacob N. Brown which makes our people the most energetic on the face of the earth.\n\nSource: History of Adams County, Ohio from its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time - by Nelson W. Evans and Emmons B.
