        "text": "In the wake of Plessy v. Ferguson and increasing racial terror in the South, tens of thousands of Black people made their way North to Boston during the period known as the Great Migration.\n\nMigrants traveling to Boston frequently took one of the trains heading up the East Coast. Considering this path helps answer the question why Boston received a smaller influx of southern Blacks during the Great Migration. Some migrants may have ended their journeys at one of these other northern cities prior to Boston. Additionally, the journey cost African Americans weeks of wages, and frequently these individuals sold everything they owned prior to making the trip. When they arrived in Boston, many southern Black migrants moved to Roxbury. Since this Boston neighborhood had a well established Black community, southern migrants received support from local churches and groups to establish their new life and form their own close-knit communities. Organizations such as the Boston Branch of the NAACP and the Boston Urban League frequently provided programs for new southern migrants and helped them find jobs. (Abbreviated version of the National Park Service article on the Great Migration in Boston)\n\nIn addition to the activism of these organizations, Boston continued to be a hub for Black political thought. Several Black political publications flourished in Boston, including The Women's Era, The Guardian, and The Colored American Magazine. The likes of W. E. B. DuBois hailed from nearby Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and continued frequent conversations with Black activists in the Boston area.\n\nOn This Page:\n\nTimeline of the Great Migration era in Boston\n\nRelated primary sources and research projects\n\nRelated nonfiction books\n\nImage Above: Painting number 40 of the 60 in Jacob Lawrence's The Migration Series.

The Boston Guardian was first published in Boston, Massachusetts in 1901 by William Monroe Trotter and George Forbes, former publisher of the Boston Courant and a reference librarian at the Boston Public Library. Trotter was the editor of the newspaper from its beginnings until his death in 1934. It was a weekly publication, coming out on Saturdays, that was aimed primarily at Boston's African American community, though eventually it had significant readership across the United States. This collection has been digitized by the Boston Public Library.\n\nTimeline courtesy of The City of Boston"
