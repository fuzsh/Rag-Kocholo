        "text": "The papers of Freeman Henry Morris Murray, author, lecturer, editor and printer, span the period 1883-1916 and total 1 linear foot.\n\nThe collection centers on The Horizon: a Journal of the Color Line, of which Murray was editor, and his book, Emancipation and the Freed in American Sculpture. In the materials relating to both publications, there is correspondence with notables such as W.E.B. DuBois, Meta Warwick Fuller, and William Monroe Trotter.\n\nThe papers also contain corrected typescripts of some of Murray's writings, as well as clippings from his newspaper columns, ''The Cynic Says'' and \"Chips from the Quarry\". Other items of interest are materials related to the Niagara Movement including a group photograph of the wives of the men who organized the first conference.\n\nComplementing his business activities are the personal papers of Freeman H.M. Murray. These materials include financial papers as well as 13 diaries belonging to Murray and one diary belonging to his wife, Laura Hamilton Murray."
