        "text": "\n\nheres my 2cents on Mentor. Never used Cadence. IHMO, Mentor is very\n\nexpensive\n\nand can be difficult to use. The other drawback to Mentor is\n\nit only runs under UNIX. Why is this a issue? Because in my opinon being\n\nable to work out of my home is important and I have a PC at home not\n\na Sun workstation. Mentor does have a new tool called Personal\n\nArchitect that runs on a PC, but it was developed by a third party(which\n\nI understand Mentor now owns) and from what I hear there are issues with\n\nworking with other Mentor tools. Infact you need utilities to translate\n\nfiles back and forth.\n\nIf I remember correctly, there was an artical in EE Times announcing\n\nCadence\n\nsupports both Sun and NT. I'm sure there are issues with Candence, ever\n\ntool\n\nseems to have them.\n\nI also own Orcad Capture and Layout. I've just finshed a 12 layer board\n\nand I did it for $5k.\n\nWe use Mentor here at work. I think the reason has more to do with the\n\nfact that\n\nwe look at the price tag and say \"if it cost a lot it must be good.\"\n\nPlus, since\n\nUNIX was developed here at Bell Labs we believe its the only real\n\noperating\n\nsystem.\n\nFredrick Ackourey wrote:\n\n>\n\n> We are in the process of choosing a high end cad/eda system.

But will you really have the time to\n\nset up all the simulation models you need for this?\n\nas a university we have a very complex computer infrastructure,\n\ntherefore we require software written with some common rules of \"good\"\n\nprogramming praxis in mind. This means, despite Cadence is mainly an\n\nX-application it relies on many specific environmental settings that\n\ninteract badly with other software products. Presumably a stand-alone\n\nsolution would be more stable.\n\nThe Cadence hotline is really good. Unfortunately they can't change the\n\nprogram on the fly.\n\nconclusions:\n\nif your designs are not very high-speed (i.e. you don't need to extract\n\ntransmission-line models from layout and other funny things) or very\n\nsophisticated (e.g. many many layers, complicated MCM-builups, etc.)\n\nwhere you need the configurability of a _big_ tool) look for one of\n\nthose nice NT programs (e.g. CadStar, Protel, OrCad,...). And if you go\n\nfor Cadence or Mentor be sure you find some smart guys who install this\n\nstuff and keep it running...\n\nunfortunately, i need all this high-speed and MCM stuff, so i've the\n\npleasure of spending my time with Cadence...\n\ncheers\n\n- andy\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAndreas Thiel\n\nElectronics Laboratory | Institut fuer Elektronik\n\nETH Zurich | ETH Zuerich\n\nGloriastrasse 35 | Gloriastrasse 35\n\nCH-8092 Zurich | CH-8092 Zuerich\n\nSwitzerland |\n\nPhone: ++41 1 63 26658 | Tel.: (01) 63 26658\n\nFAX: ++41 1 63 21210 | FAX.: (01) 63 21210\n\ne-mail: th...@ife.ee.ethz.ch\n\nWWW-homepage: http://www.ife.ee.ethz.ch/~thiel/\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAndreas Thiel <th...@ife.ee.ethz.ch> wrote in article\n\n<334B87...@ife.ee.ethz.ch>...\n\n> Fredrick Ackourey wrote:\n\n> >\n\n> > We are in the process of choosing a high end cad/eda system.

I\n\nvery much agree with Andreas' sentiments!\n\nOf course, there were plenty of other people who did take the course and\n\nslugged through Mentor. But I had far more time to engage in more noble\n\ntasks, such as eating pizza.\n\nMentor is definitely a cool package, however.\n\n---Joel Kolstad\n\n\n\nWell Fred, in general I only have about 15 minutes a month to wade\n\nthrough newsgroups. I posted the findings of my companies (One of the\n\nFortune 500) benchmark here in December. We did full blown benchmarks\n\n(except where noted) of:\n\nMentor Graphics\n\nCadence (Benchmark Refused)\n\nZuken-Redac\n\nHarris EDA (5+ yrs current use)\n\nPADs\n\nVeribest (Wholly owned sub. of Intergraph)\n\nEssentially I agree with the comments that I have seen posted by others\n\nup to this point. Our final decision was with Veribest. Their router\n\nscreams and isn't owned by a competitor (Mentor's router is Cooper Chyan\n\ncurrently under buyout by Cadence.). The system runs on NT which means\n\nI can buy three times the stations for the same money. I am !very!\n\nimpressed with the several facets of the company that I have dealt with;\n\nsales, marketing, training organization, management, customer support,\n\nand \"outside services\".\n\nThis system deserves a THOROUGH evaluation by ALL companies interested\n\nin CAD systems that are more than toys.\n\nWhile my opinion is stated here, it is not necessarily that of my\n\ncompanies; but we are buying over sixteen seats.\n\nS\n\nOh God if I had only known ....\n\nWe use Mentor for design captire and PCB Layout (after about 2 years, I\n\ncan finally route a card, we have 2 full time designers but the engineers\n\nwant to route as well)\n\nThe tool is very expensive for the value it provides.\n\nTo add any features is very expensive.\n\nTo fix almost any problem in using the tool requires the purchase of new\n\nfeatures (LMS, printer drivers, etc.)\n\nWe hired a consultant from the UK (not on Mentor's payroll so he wouldn't\n\ntry to sell us anything) to help us sort the thing out. Key points:\n\n1. You must decide upfront how you want your design process to flow\n\n2. THEN pick a tool to help you achieve that.\n\nThe tool does have nice features ( design checking, auto-router, auto\n\nrenumbering, large desings etc.) but is loaded with bugs (that you will\n\neventually learn to work around - try auto routing a single-sided card -\n\nHa HA HA HA!)\n\nIn order to \"obtain the full benefit\" from the system - YOU WILL HAVE TO\n\nHIRE MORE PEOPLE TO SUPPORT IT THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE. This includes at\n\nleast a Librarian (high level) and a library entry / checking person. This\n\nis quite confusing to management since they will have to dish out at least\n\n$250,000 for 2 layout seats and 10 Design Architect licenses.\n\nIf I had to do it over - I would look into PC-based tools like Design\n\nCenter.\n\nMy Opinion\n\nSteve"
