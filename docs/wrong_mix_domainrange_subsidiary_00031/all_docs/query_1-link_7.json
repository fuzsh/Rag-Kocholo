        "text": "Valuation ratio Description The company P/E ratio The P/E ratio tells analyst how much an investor in common stock pays per dollar of current earnings. Cadence Design Systems Inc. P/E ratio decreased from 2020 to 2021 but then increased from 2021 to 2022 not reaching 2020 level. P/OP ratio Because P/E ratio is calculated using net income, the ratio can be sensitive to nonrecurring earnings and capital structure, analysts may use price to operating profit. Cadence Design Systems Inc. P/OP ratio decreased from 2020 to 2021 and from 2021 to 2022. P/S ratio An rationale for the P/S ratio is that sales, as the top line in an income statement, are generally less subject to distortion or manipulation than other fundamentals such as EPS or book value. Sales are also more stable than earnings and never negative. Cadence Design Systems Inc. P/S ratio decreased from 2020 to 2021 but then increased from 2021 to 2022 exceeding 2020 level."
