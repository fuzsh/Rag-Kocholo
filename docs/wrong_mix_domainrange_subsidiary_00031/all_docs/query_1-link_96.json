        "text": "Introducing Cockpit\n\nCockpit is a web-based graphical interface for servers, intended for everyone, especially those who are:\n\nnew to Linux (including Windows admins)\n\nfamiliar with Linux and want an easy, graphical way to administer servers\n\nexpert admins who mainly use other tools but want an overview on individual systems\n\nThanks to Cockpit intentionally using system APIs and commands, a whole team of admins can manage a system in the way they prefer, including the command line and utilities right alongside Cockpit.\n\nTake a look\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words. Click a thumbnail to see screenshots of Cockpit in action.\n\nSimple to use\n\nCockpit makes Linux discoverable. You don’t have to remember commands at a command-line.\n\nSee your server in a web browser and perform system tasks with a mouse. It’s easy to start containers, administer storage, configure networks, and inspect logs. Basically, you can think of Cockpit like a graphical “desktop interface”, but for individual servers.\n\nCompatible with your existing workflows\n\nHave a favorite app or command line tool that you use on your servers? Keep using the command line, Ansible, and your other favorite tools and add Cockpit to the mix with no issues.\n\nCockpit uses the same system tooling you would use from the command line. You can switch back and forth between Cockpit and whatever else you like. Cockpit even has a built-in terminal, which is useful when you connect from a non-Linux device.\n\nIntegrated\n\nCockpit uses APIs that already exist on the system. It doesn’t reinvent subsystems or add a layer of its own tooling.\n\nBy default, Cockpit uses your system’s normal user logins and privileges. Network-wide logins are also supported through single-sign-on and other authentication techniques.\n\nCockpit itself doesn’t eat resources or even run in the background when you’re not using it. It runs on demand, thanks to systemd socket activation.\n\nExtendable\n\nCockpit also supports a large list of optional and third-party applications.\n\nUsing Cockpit\n\nHere’s a subset of tasks you can perform on each host running Cockpit:\n\nInspect and change network settings\n\nConfigure a firewall\n\nManage storage (including RAID and LUKS partitions)\n\nCreate and manage virtual machines\n\nDownload and run containers\n\nBrowse and search system logs\n\nInspect a system’s hardware\n\nUpgrade software\n\nKeep tabs on performance\n\nManage user accounts\n\nInspect and interact with systemd-based services\n\nUse a terminal on a remote server in your local web browser\n\nSwitch between multiple Cockpit servers\n\nExtend Cockpit’s functionality by installing a growing list of apps and add-ons\n\nWrite your own custom modules to make Cockpit do anything you want\n\nAlso troubleshoot and fix pesky problems with ease:\n\nDiagnose network issues\n\nSpot and react to misbehaving virtual machines\n\nExamine SELinux logs and fix common violations in a click\n\nInspect detailed metrics that correlate CPU load, memory usage, network activity, and storage performance with the system’s journal\n\nMore features appear in Cockpit every release.\n\nDesigned & tested\n\nCockpit’s design keeps your goals in mind. We test Cockpit with usability studies to make it work the way you’d expect and adjust accordingly. As a result, Cockpit gets easier to use all the time.\n\nAll code changes have tests which must pass before merging, to ensure stability.\n\nFree & free\n\nCockpit is free to use and available under the GNU LGPL.\n\nCockpit works (nearly) everywhere\n\nYou can install Cockpit on the major distributions, including:\n\nOnce Cockpit is up and running, you can access systems from all major web browsers on any operating system (including Windows, MacOS, and Android).\n\nRelease schedule\n\nCockpit has a time-based release cadence, with new versions appearing every two weeks.\n\nGet started"
