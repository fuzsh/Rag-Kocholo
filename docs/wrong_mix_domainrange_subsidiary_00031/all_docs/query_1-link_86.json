EDA software automates the chip design process, enhancing design accuracy, productivity, and complexity in a full-flow end-to-end solution. Cadence offers a portfolio of design IP, as well as system design and analysis products, which enable system-level analysis and verification solutions. Cadence’s comprehensive portfolio is benefiting from a mutual convergence of semiconductor companies moving up-stack toward systems-like companies, and systems companies moving down-stack toward in-house semiconductor design. The resulting expansion in EDA customers, alongside secular digitalization of various end markets, benefits EDA vendors like Cadence.\n\nRating\n\nPrice Target\n\nLowering target price to $327.00\n\nCADENCE DESIGN SYS INC has an Investment Rating of HOLD; a target price of $327.000000; an Industry Subrating of High; a Management Subrating of Medium; a Safety Subrating of Medium; a Financial Strength Subrating of Medium; a Growth Subrating of Medium; and a Value Subrating of Medium.\n\nRating\n\nPrice Target\n\nLowering target price to $331.00\n\nCADENCE DESIGN SYS INC has an Investment Rating of HOLD; a target price of $331.000000; an Industry Subrating of High; a Management Subrating of Medium; a Safety Subrating of Medium; a Financial Strength Subrating of Medium; a Growth Subrating of Medium; and a Value Subrating of Medium.\n\nRating\n\nPrice Target\n\nRaising target price to $333.00\n\nCADENCE DESIGN SYS INC has an Investment Rating of HOLD; a target price of $333.000000; an Industry Subrating of High; a Management Subrating of Medium; a Safety Subrating of Medium; a Financial Strength Subrating of Medium; a Growth Subrating of Medium; and a Value Subrating of Medium.\n\nRating\n\nPrice Target\n\nPeople Also Watch\n\nSNPS Synopsys, Inc.\n\n588.33\n\n+0.11%\n\nANSS ANSYS, Inc.\n\n320.08\n\n+0.45%\n\nKLAC KLA Corporation\n\n807.66\n\n-0.23%\n\nANET Arista Networks, Inc.\n\n346.65\n\n+1.29%\n\nADSK Autodesk, Inc.\n\n246.23\n\n+0.40%\n\nLRCX Lam Research Corporation\n\n959.69\n\n-1.78%\n\nFTNT Fortinet, Inc.\n\n57.94\n\n-0.87%\n\nTER Teradyne, Inc.\n\n152.27\n\n-1.42%\n\nNOW ServiceNow, Inc.\n\n765.52\n\n+1.19%\n\nMCHP Microchip Technology Incorporated\n\n89.71\n\n-3.66%\n\nMPWR Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.\n\n846.41\n\n-1.28%\n\nINTU Intuit Inc.\n\n637.10\n\n-1.15%\n\nADI Analog Devices, Inc.\n\n230.32\n\n-4.05%\n\nCPRT Copart, Inc.\n\n52.32\n\n-0.40%\n\nQRVO Qorvo, Inc.\n\n125.14\n\n-0.28%\n\nIDXX IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\n470.41\n\n-1.03%"
