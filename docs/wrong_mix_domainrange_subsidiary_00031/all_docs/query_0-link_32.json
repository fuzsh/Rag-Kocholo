        "text": "Within minutes of my first meeting with Cadence, my stress level reduced. I was taken through the steps I required and were thorough and precise to my needs. They then sent me information and forms, and phoned me to see if I needed further assistance or had any questions. I would highly recommend Cadenceâ so helpful during a stressful and tough time.\n\nJames S.\n\nA dedicated hour on the phone with Carly and I was well on way to settling my husbands affairs. A website where I could access letters etc. was amazing. Would highly recommend the services of Cadence Aftercare.\n\nMarilyn D.\n\nThis service was super helpful. When I didn't know where to start with my Dad's estate, my advisor walked us through step by step in a friendly and helpful way. The system is personalized and very user-friendly, and gave me confidence as I moved through what could have been a complicated and overwhelming process. I'm thrilled!\n\nAnonymous\n\nI feel so much better. At least I have made a start thanks to Cadence and each of you with your kind communication and understanding when needed.\n\nElsie W.\n\nCadence has been so helpful and professional in dealing with the estate of my mother. They responded immediately and we felt that they always went the extra mile for us. Thank you!\n\nAldine P.\n\nI found the quality of the on-line support very good and the Process support document provided me with useful items that I was unaware of. Thank you!\n\nPaul K.\n\nAs Cadence does not provide legal services, they are able to connect me as the lawyer with ideal clients. I absolutely love that the team at Cadence and I share the same passion for guiding people through this difficult time.\n\nKrista E.\n\nYou were able to tell me what needed to be addressed in order, gave me unlimited support following the loss of my mother. You've been so very much help and word everything delicately to assist in the executor roadmap!\n\nBonnie H.\n\nThey were there when I was ready to deal with the business aspect of my mother's death. I cannot say enough positive things about how much Cadence helped me through the most difficult time in my life. I highly recommend this service.\n\nChristine L.\n\nAn included service of my funeral home was a connection to Cadence, where I met my advisor. She assisted me with going through all the steps as an Executor and provided me with a structure to work from.\n\nCarolyn J.\n\nWhen my mom passed away in Sept 2021, I was not only shocked and grieving, but very worried about what to do next. My dad is almost blind and hard of hearing and in his grief was no help to me at all. I will always be grateful for the help the team at Cadence gave me and for their kindness. I highly recommend their services to anyone in this trying situation.\n\nTerry B.\n\nCadence is an extension of our service to families, it has been a real win-win partnership. By simplifying the paperwork and details of estate documentation, they save the family so much time and stress. We highly recommend their services.\n\nMorgan E.\n\nIt has long been a disappointment of mine that we well serve so many aspects of a clientâs financial life, yet upon death, we had limited abilities to take away the volume of tasks and the executorsâ frustration. Cadence has delivered a solution by designing a user-friendly portal to manage tasks combined with an empathetic, efficient process and suite of services. Cadence is an easy way to differentiate ourselves, while reminding clients how much we care.\n\nJohn Davis, Blackburn Davis Financial"
