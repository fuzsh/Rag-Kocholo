        "text": "Updated September 18, 2023\n\nThe 50 Best Private Day Schools in the United States ; 1. Trinity School - New York, New York ; 2. The Bests School New York City, NY ; 3. The Trinity School\n\nAre you ready to discover your college program?\n\nI want my\n\nIn\n\nFocusing on\n\nPrivate High Schools Across America\n\nPrivate day schools are popular options for families seeking a high-quality education. Students receive a world-class education while maintaining their residence with their families. A great private day school—that is, a private high school without boarding facilities—will challenge students to achieve not only academic success, but personal success as well. (Compare our articles The 50 Best Public High Schools in the U.S. and The 50 Best Colleges in the U.S.)\n\nThe rankings below have been compiled on the basis of a number of factors. In terms of academic excellence, the schools on the following list maintain a superior level of instruction, quality relationships with top-tier colleges, and additional academic awards and honors. The majority of students who attend these day schools attend Ivy League universities or the colleges just underneath the Ivies in college ranking materials.\n\nBecause diversity of the student body is integral to preparing students for living and working in a connected, global society, we factor this into our criteria for the rankings. The diversity of a student population, as well as opportunities to connect to the world, are telling factors of a school’s commitment to preparing its students for the world outside of the school environment.\n\nThe third aspect assessed for this listing consists of intangible factors, such as innovative degree programs in the arts, current student satisfaction with their high school, quality and experience of the faculty, or modern lab or athletic facilities. Also, we have striven for as much geographical diversity as is consistent with our other criteria.\n\nNote about boarding schools: Schools that receive day students along with boarding students will be included in a follow-up article on boarding schools. This article focuses on private high schools that do not provide boarding facilities.\n\nNote about tuition: The tuition price comes from the most current figure posted on the school’s websites. Most of the numbers listed are exclusive of textbooks, lunches, and other fees.\n\nNote about alumni/alumnae: In some cases, notable persons who attended a school, but did not graduate, are also listed.\n\n1.
