        "text": "My apologies for the radio silence lately. It has been a huge year personally and professionally with a lot of change, many challenges and some big plans finally starting to coalesce. One aspect of this has been our efforts bringing Genius ReFi to life.\n\nGenius Refi is a global collaboration space and news site for researchers, entrepreneurs, investors and industry, with a focus on new ventures deploying regenerative science.\n\nOnly around 20-30% of initial science research proposals in universities worldwide actually get funded and only a small proportion of this gets commercialised. Here in New Zealand, compared to other OECD nations, we are doing about half the typical public investment in research science and technology (RS&T) within our underfunded universities. A lot of research is not making it out of the lab at a time when we need to be delivering a great many more solutions for emissions reduction, food sufficiency, environmental regeneration, renewable energy, disease and much more.\n\nSo Genius ReFi was born to validate whether or not we could build a (global) community of interest and collaboration space around these needs. Phase 1 is simply a collection of short but inspirational global news stories from me about science research being translated into regenerative products and services. Sitting on our little islands in the South West Pacific, we sometimes forget that 99.8% of business actually takes place outside our shores. So it is good to get insights into what other economies are doing with their RS&T settings whilst receiving inspiration from tech ventures that are out there doing it!\n\nThere is another element to this. Increasing the convergence of researchers, entrepreneurs, investors and industry. Because most published science is closed source and researchers are often not entrepreneurs themselves, we don’t know how many commercial opportunities have been missed in the past. In the future some areas of science research are likely to become more open and decentralised. Imagine if could leverage this and deliver 10X the amount of regenerative science as scalable, viable businesses that have a regenerative effect on our world. There’s never been a more important task for humanity.\n\nPaul Spence is a commentator, researcher and a part-time university commerce and management lecturer.

Indicative of this malaise are multiple failing infrastructures, over-stretched health services,Â decaying school buildings and unsafe civic spaces throughout the country. Stopping the rot will require raising our ambition as a nation and improving productivity through a higher value economy.\n\nFor too long our economic performance has been linked to an over-dependence on relatively low value commodities and tourism. As part of its quickfire raffle of “first 100 days” opportunities, the government is looking to “deliberately disrupt the system” by fast tracking gold mines, open-cast coal mining, property developments and bigger dairy farms, to name a few. Unfortunately these kinds of projects mostly lock us into even greater dependence on low value commodity based industries that do not generate the returns required to substantially lift productivity. But doesn’t this help us improve our gross domestic product (GDP)? Yes it does, but the benefits are not shared equitably, with returns often heading directly offshore.\n\nMulti-factor productivity (MFP), on the other hand, represents residual economic growth due to factors (other than labour or capital) such as technological advancements, improved management practices, and a better-skilled workforce. MFP illustrates how successful a nation is at innovating and transforming resources into high value outputs. Over the last two decades or so New Zealand performed terribly compared to other OECD nations on this measure. Arguably, MFP is also the slice of the economic pie that allows governments to steadily improve the quality of public services and investment, as real wealth increases and tax receipts grow. Clearly we are heading in the opposite direction at present.\n\nQuidnet Ventures managing director Mark Bregman illustrated the situation in a recent article discussing the innovation gap. We need to move to an “abundance mindset” and get over our hangups such as misplaced nationalism and the current reluctance of research institutions to back science that has commercial potential, he asserts. Important because one of the keys to creating high value economic returns lies in homegrown research that has future commercial potential. But getting these projects off the ground has always been problematic for a number of reasons, including funding constraints, institutional bureaucracy and lack of entrepreneurial mindset. How we approach science commercialisation must change.\n\nWith the nebulus “Te Paerangi – Future Pathways” report now mercifully euthanised by the Science Minister a new plan for research, science and technology now needs to be found. This time a sensible discussion about commercialisation must be included. To this end, the freshly minted Science System Advisory Group and University Advisory Group have been tasked with delivering a new strategic plan for transforming the science and university sectors. This will include (yet another) review of the performance based research fund (PBRF), the contentious pot of public funding that tends to favour larger universities with greater output, rather than promoting innovation or supporting the most important areas of research for society.\n\nBut none of this will matter unless we eliminate the institutional and financial roadblocks that are preventing research getting out of the lab and into the commercial sphere. The current model is simply not working at sufficient scale or speed.\n\nLike all good researchers, we are testing some hypotheses around disrupting the status quo and creating more value for entrepreneurial science researchers.

The cover art for that album features images of three musicians depicted as a glitchy digital display, alluding to the concept of the human mind taking on a digital persona. Rather prescient when you consider that digital music required a stage full of computing power and miles of spaghetti wiring at the time and that this was almost 15 years before public internet arose. Artificial intelligence existed only in the fertile imaginations of authors such as Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke and their readers. So what does the future hold for digital ghosts and how do we get our timing right in what is today a rapidly evolving field?\n\nFast forward to 2017 and I was about to experience a brief rock star moment of my own as I spent the most terrifying five minutes of my life presenting to an audience of corporate bigwigs and various supporters. The kernel of that pitch was that machine based technologies would become integral to utilities services management. Nobody got the point and thanks to the conservative nature of the energy industry incumbents, who were sponsoring our accelerator, the project sank without a trace. We had many”learnings” along the way as a team however and I’m glad I participated.\n\nOnly six years later, AI is rapidly embedding in almost every sector and obscene sums are being invested in companies providing a vast array of offerings. For starters the venture capital industry itself is being disrupted by artificial intelligence. Deployment of capital into AI is growing faster than almost every other technology sector right now, according to industry monitor Carta. Notwithstanding some concerns over governance, AI looks set to play an increasing role in our lives.\n\nTiming is a big part of building a successful venture. Sometimes timing is even the most significant factor, regardless of the quality of the team or the idea. I’ve got the timing wrong on more than a few occasions in my life. Ideas alone are worthless without good execution and a bit of good luck as well. In most cases, failing fast is the best possible outcome. If AI really is the ghost in the machine and the timing is right now, I wonder if it will help us be more effective entrepreneurs, govern more wisely and be better guardians of the planet?\n\nPaul Spence is a commentator, researcher and serial entrepreneur, a previous co-founder of a successful New Zealand based global technology venture, co-founder and director of Creative Forest, principal at GeniusNet Research & SondXF and an advisor at ThincLab.

Our last chance to set in place a paradigmatic shift in policies governing the way we treat our planet and thereby setting an example to other nations. Instead, the topic of environment has been almost entirely absent from debate. That says as much about voters as it does about the candidates vying for our attention of course. But we need to lift our heads and focus on the real opportunities, generating better outcomes for everyone, whilst avoiding setting fire to our own home.\n\nScrolling back through social media activity from the various political parties in the lead up to the election, it is clear that climate change and the environment are not at the forefront of political discourse. That is unsurprising given that polling has “cost of living” as the number one concern for voters. The difficulty is that inflationary cost pressures on households are largely outside of the control of any government whereas parliamentarians can influence how we treat the environment. Moreover, arguably less progressive nations are now surging ahead of us. It is not sufficient simply to state there is a “climate emergency”. Action is also required.\n\nMost disappointing this election is that the New Zealand “Green” Party have ironically chosen to focus on almost everything EXCEPT the environment. Envy taxes, rent controls, income support. So having achieved very little for the environment alongside Labour, the current strategy now seems squarely aimed at eating Labour’s base. At the same time, Green policy is underwritten by divisive identity politics and other failed ideologies from the 20th Century aimed at producing dull, classless societies where thought and discourse is dictated by the State and elites in government control and distribute wealth, rather than individuals. They are completely missing the point.\n\nIn fact, what politicians across the spectrum all seem to be missing is our profound failure to meaningfully participate in the emerging global transition economy, a project worth more than US $100 Trilion over the next 25 years. It’s very simple. If we want to address social equity and care for an ageing population, we must generate greater economic wealth. Carbon transition alongside biodiversity regeneration will be one of the largest economic opportunities of our lifetime and good for the planet. Peering at our navels and invoking a victim mentality is not the kind of leadership needed right now.\n\nA supporter of The Opportunities Party this election, Paul Spence is a commentator, researcher and serial entrepreneur, a previous co-founder of a successful New Zealand based global technology venture, co-founder and director of Creative Forest, principal at GeniusNet Research & SondXF and an advisor at ThincLab.

It’s no secret that the city has confronted numerous challenges over the last decade or so. From devastating earthquakes to wildfires and a mass shooting. One could be forgiven for thinking that the place was on its knees. But it’s not. As the central city was being rebuilt, a core group of activators played a pivotal role through charting a course with innovation and collaboration at its core. Now the city is thriving. What if we germinated that approach into central government?\n\nA number of the aforementioned group were present at the recent discussion event. Not the least of these was Raj Manji, who convened the session. As a former Christchurch City Councillor and tireless advocate for the city, Manji is no stranger to the challenges of navigating government processes in difficult times. He’s also a global thinker who takes action and attracts smart people with fresh ideas into his sphere of influence.\n\nThese are attributes that seem sadly lacking in many of our current politicians, including those who are likely to be in charge once the face of government changes in October. As The Opportunities Party (TOP) leader, Manji has a real shot at securing the Ilam seat at the general election. This would be a game changer because, under MMP, successful electorate winners get to “tag and drag” along some of their party list candidates. Potentially this means TOP could play a huge part in shaping the next government.\n\nWhy is this significant? It’s pretty clear that our current government has run its course and the wheels are falling off the proverbial wagon. Not a week passes where there isn’t either a dramatic exit or a revelation of bad behaviour by Ministers or coalition partner MPs. The present incumbents performed admirably during the pandemic, but the world has now moved on. History has also shown that governing parties very rarely secure three consecutive terms in New Zealand. For its part, the Opposition, whilst more disciplined than before, seem unable to generate intelligent policy or outline a coherent plan. Political change of some form is undoubtedly on the way. The question is – how do we optimise that change?\n\nBy standing up and supporting TOP I’m putting a stake in the ground in an effort to facilitate an optimal outcome. We desperately need fresh thinking and evidence based policy driven by responsible adults. If TOP fails to win a place at the table, we face the possibility of an unstable coalition underwritten by dogma and driven by the smug, sneering faces of the more extremist minor parties. Parties that do not necessarily have the interests of ALL New Zealanders at heart. This would be disastrous at this pivotal moment in history when society must act collectively to confront significant global issues.\n\nPaul Spence is a commentator, researcher and serial entrepreneur, a previous co-founder of a successful New Zealand based global technology venture, co-founder and director of Creative Forest, principal at GeniusNet Research & SondXF and an advisor at ThincLab.

It wasn’t long before somebody popped the “diversity question” into the conversation, complaining that women, migrants and people of colour can’t get help with their startups and do not get a fair hearing from investors in New Zealand. If that is true, I want to do something about it!\n\nFor those of you who don’t know me, I’ve been active in the NZ tech community for around 20 years and I’ve seen a lot of bullshitters come and go. I’ve started three companies. One was a great success that we bootstrapped and exited in 2019, another tanked during acceleration and another one ticks along and generates a bit of cash here and there. So I’ve been around the block a few times – as they say.\n\nBITE ME! – Building In The Ecosystem for Migrant Entrepreneurs!\n\nAt present I’m a part-time advisor at University of Canterbury incubator ThincLab. I’ve worked with a huge diversity of founders. Young students, women founders, Maori. Founders from all over the world. Germany, Iran, Pakistan, India, Japan, Ukraine, China, United States, France… the list goes on. I’ve especially enjoyed working with founders who identify as neuro-diverse. We certainly have an amazingly diverse group of founders here in Canterbury. Perhaps it is not the case elsewhere?\n\nIn startup land it’s important to look beyond our tiny isolated little islands from the outset. A lot of Kiwi founders don’t get this. So diverse founders and especially skilled migrant entrepreneurs bring huge value to our ecosystem. I’ve even started companies with a few of them. So it grinds my gears when I hear people complaining about the “lack of diversity” in our startup ecosystem.\n\nSupporting our skilled migrant entrepreneurs is the fastest way to grow an even more diverse ecosystem, whilst building high value, scalable startups that contribute tangible economic value.\n\nTake a look at We Love Local for example, a corporate gift box provider founded by my friends from Mauritius and Germany. They’ve been growing fast and have received multi-award recognition for their business which was started from scratch only a few years ago. How about Swallowing Technologies. Migrant female founder from academia commercialising her research globally. Caterway, my friends from Japan and Ukraine serving the corporate catering market.\n\nSo I’m putting my money where my mouth is by offering a free advisory session.\n\nIf you are a New Zealand based e-commerce, cleantech, foodtech, edtech or fintech (especially fintech) migrant founder struggling to make connections, recently arrived or just need some objective feedback on your project. Pitch me! I don’t care if you have lizard skin and shoot purple streamers from your arse. I’ve seen it all, trust me! What I do care about is your ability to execute, sharp intelligence, that you have technical skills and have some kind of workable business model. Oh and a sense of humour and a willingness to listen would definitely be useful.\n\nLet’s talk and see where it leads. Reach me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\n\nIf I can’t help – I will probably know someone else who can.\n\nPaul Spence is a commentator and serial entrepreneur, a previous co-founder of a successful New Zealand based global technology venture, co-founder and director of Creative Forest, principal at GeniusNet Research & SondXF and an advisor at ThincLab.

Breakthrough Victoria will focus on life sciences, agri-food, cleantech and digital technologies in a push to reboot the state’s post-Covid economy. The package includes $100 million for co-funding platform services such as research facilities and commercialisation advisory.\n\nIt was with this in mind that I attended the Startup Council roadshow event in Christchurch recently with fire in my belly. For context, the New Zealand government invests a grand total of $2.5 million per annum to support incubation and acceleration across the entire country. In June 2022 the existing successful “founder incubators” were all de-funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and the funding was handed over to an elite collection of service providers outside of the universities. In 2020 funding for “deep tech incubation” was allocated to a group of foreign controlled entities. There is currently no central government funding for incubation within a New Zealand university.\n\nThe newly formed Startup Council sprung out of some policy initiatives developed collaboratively during the first lock-down through Global Entrepreneurship Network New Zealand, to which I actively contributed. The self-selected Council is comprised mostly of representatives from the investment community, but also includes a serial technology entrepreneur and an accelerator operator. The Council has direct communication with government Ministers.\n\nThat last point is important because for a long time our startup ecosystem did not have a voice in government. Over the years we have been reliant on pleading a case to gatekeepers at MBIE who seem to have little or no global context for decision making. Up until recently, the government focus has been upon kick-starting the venture investment sector. This ignores the issue of curating a pipeline of deal flow however. Translational research does not magically become investment ready without a lot of background support.\n\nNot investing in our startup ecosystem is not just an existential problem for those of us that work with founders. It is also an impediment to progress in meeting our carbon zero commitments. In 2021 around US $1 Trillion in capital poured into funds targeting investment into environment, social and governance (ESG) focused projects and ventures, including cleantech, sustainable food and renewable energy. Areas in which we already have capability. Investment is expected to grow to $4 Trillion per annum, as the global economy decouples from carbon. If New Zealand is to have a chance to participate, we need to be building sound innovation infrastructure right now, especially within universities!\n\nThe cold, hard reality is that (up until now at least) the government has not seen the value in supporting a vibrant startup ecosystem. This is despite the fact that our neighbours across Asia-Pacific have literally invested hundreds of millions over decades. If nothing changes and with the world open for business again, it will be no surprise if some of our scientist entrepreneurs and tech startup founders start looking towards the West Island. Or perhaps even further afield.\n\nPaul Spence is a commentator and serial entrepreneur, a previous co-founder of a successful New Zealand based global technology venture, co-founder and director of Creative Forest, principal at GeniusNet Research & SondXF and an advisor at ThincLab.

I really want to play my part to reduce emissions, so I’m in the market for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). I’ve also been doing a couple of papers at our local university for interest recently and have just completed a marketing course at Masters level. So I’m up to speed with marketing tactics and sneaky selling strategies. This is where the fun begins.\n\nI headed into town to work my way around a few car sales yards – just to see how I would be treated as a potential customer. Here’s what I found.\n\n1. KIA – The receptionist introduced me to a very young salesman who looked like he had better things to do. I asked if he could take me out for a short drive and introduce me to the vehicle I was interested in. No, that was not possible. But please sign this $5,000 waiver and feel free to take her out for a spin yourself. I asked a basic question about whether the vehicle had anti-skid. He said he needed to go check on this. Really? Aren’t you selling these vehicles? I was also informed there was a 6 month waiting list. Slightly bemused, I signed my life away. After a 2 minute familiarisation, he left me to it. 5/10\n\n2. Subaru – Bubbly young lady waltzed up to me. Very positive attitude, but admits that Subaru do not offer what I seek and not likely to in the future (they do in the U.S.). Things got better though. She asked if I’d considered a Peugeot. I had not. Her colleague under the same roof looked after the franchise, so she kindly took me over and introduced me to him. 7/10\n\n3. Peugeot – We had a good discussion about European vehicles and the sales chap mentioned that he would have a demonstrator vehicle arriving next month that would fit my needs. He gave me a business card and showed me where to find useful info on their website. At all times he showed an interest in the customer needs and was looking to find a solution for me. Not bad. 8/10\n\n4. Hyundai – I currently drive a Hyundai. It has been a wonderful vehicle with minimal running costs. I also love that Hyundai is sponsoring the Pinnacle Programme that offers scholarship opportunities to high achieving students. The current television campaign is the best ad on tv in my humble opinion. I dearly want to love Hyundai – but they keep disappointing. At last year’s service, the car groomer conspired with a rude receptionist to turn the stereo volume to maximum, resulting in an ear blasting when I turned the key. Funny joke. So it was with some trepidation that I set foot on their car yard. I need not have worried. The salesman completely ignored me whilst having an animated discussion on his mobile phone. 1/10\n\nMy point is this. There was a time when sales people knew their products and they knew the art of converting leads into actual sales. As a customer, I want to feel valued and respected, no matter where I am in the pipeline. From walk-in to first sale to post-sale service. Sales people used to build lifelong relationships with customers who would often return for their next purchase. What went wrong? Attention deficit?\n\nI’m not sure if this is a localised cultural problem, but service ethic no longer seems to be part of our business DNA here in New Zealand. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve walked into a shop or cafe this year where the young staff were either chatting amongst themselves or texting their friends on phones whilst completely ignoring customers. Since when has this ever been acceptable? It reflects badly on business owners who are failing to train teams in customer service and also failing to monitor performance. At a time when businesses are desperately trying to recover from sales lost during the pandemic – why are sellers failing at that most fundamental task called customer service?\n\nOh… and I still haven’t found my PHEV. Any suggestions?\n\nPaul Spence is a commentator and serial entrepreneur, a recently exited co-founder of a New Zealand based technology venture, a co-founder and director of Creative Forest, principal at GeniusNet Research and an advisor at ThincLab.

This week’s result from the Food, Fibre & Agritech Supernode Challenge suggests we have reasons to be optimistic.\n\nDuring the last few weeks it has been my great pleasure to be mentoring some of the teams involved in the 2022 Food, Fibre and Agritech Supernode Challenge accelerator programme, in my capacity as an advisor with ThincLab Canterbury. The Challenge, supported by ChristchurchNZ, KiwiNet and the Canterbury Mayoral Forum seeks to uncover innovative ideas with commercalisation potential from across research and business. Notably environmental sustainability has been a key theme that we asked applicants to address. 36 applications were whittled down to 24 participating teams, of which 12 finalists were selected.\n\nCanterbury has a long and rich association with agricultural and is home to two universities and numerous land based research institutions. So there is no shortage of talent on offer. It has been an absolute thrill to see our young skilled migrants strongly represented among the participants in this programme. For many of them it has been a steep learning curve stepping out of the research lab and grappling with the fundamentals of business for the first time. But in every case they have grasped the opportunity and run with it.\n\nChallenge overall winners Mahnaz Shaverdi and Associate Professor Ken Morison are food process engineering researchers from the University of Canterbury with big plans for turning plain old pea protein into a more desirable food source. Shaverdi moved from Iran with the aim of studying and raising her young family in New Zealand and Morison is a research engineer who returned to work in the dairy industry after completing his doctorate at Imperial College in London. Commercialisation of their research is timely. Plant-based ingredients are one of the fastest growing food categories globally, as witnessed through the recent investment by Khosla Ventures in Canterbury plant protein processor Leaft Foods.\n\nSome commentators have been worrying lately that our technology startup ecosystem lacks diversity. But at a time when the world needs many bright minds to be working on solving a myriad of social, economic and environmental problems that confront us, it is exciting to know that our skilled migrants are making an increasingly significant contribution. This is a success story that we rarely hear about and that needs to be told more often. I’m sure Sir Paul Callaghan would be encouraged by this progress.\n\nPaul Spence is a commentator and serial entrepreneur, a recently exited co-founder of a New Zealand based technology venture, a co-founder and director of Creative Forest, principal at GeniusNet Research and an advisor at ThincLab.

A wealthy and privileged, angry man arrogantly displaying his lack of respect for a long established institution and the faithful community that had blindly supported him. No, I’m not referring to the infamous Oscars night incident, I’m talking about Grant Dalton’s acceptance of an offer from the city of Barcelona to host and fund the 2024 Americas Cup yacht race.\n\nIn 2017 a glowingly optimistic report from the Ministry for Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) estimated that delivery of the Americas Cup event would bring in $600 million to $1 billion in benefits to the New Zealand economy. A more recent post-event report estimated that less than half of the $348 million public investment was returned in economic benefits during the 2021 event. The New Zealand government share of the funding was $133 million.\n\nIn fairness nobody forecast that the event would fall amidst a global disease pandemic. It is a testament to local organisers (and the success of the government’s pandemic response) that the event ran at all in fact. It is claimed that 68 million global viewers watched the televised component of the event and almost 39,000 (mostly domestic) visitors provided a much needed boost to the Auckland regional economy. But the taxpayer investment in the event came with no guarantees that Team New Zealand would opt for the 2024 challenge to be held in New Zealand and despite a further $99 million offered by the New Zealand government, hard man Dalton predictably followed the big money elsewhere.\n\nThat’s a shame for Auckland. But in light of some commentators complaining about the elitist nature of the sport, perhaps it is not worth throwing more good money after bad. In the meantime, about the same time the report on outcomes of their $133 million stake was being released by MBIE, the Ministry was also taking a decision to actually reduce their $3 million annual investment in the local innovation ecosystem. Founder incubators will be disestablished from June this year and it is already known that some will receive no further government funding.\n\nFounder incubators were once at the heart of the innovation ecosystem, providing a basis for entrepreneur capability building, a channel for investment flows and a pipeline of high tech startups that added long term, high value jobs to our economy. Not as glamorous as yacht races or movies, but creating sustainable value that persisted long after the initial public investment. Last month I explained how our neighbours and competitors across Asia-Pacific have begun to reap the rewards of long term ecosystem investment amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWhich brings me back to the $99 million already budgeted for the 2024 Americas Cup investment. Would it not be more valuable to now allocate those funds towards developing our local innovation ecosystem? New Zealand is finally beginning to gain some traction in attracting foreign startup investors and we have a wealth of homegrown entrepreneurial talent ready to take on meaty global problems in areas such as climate, food and health. We need to capitalise on this opportunity as quickly as possible. Surely it is now time to invest in creating sustainable economic opportunities, rather than one off vanity events?\n\nPaul Spence is a commentator and serial entrepreneur, a recently exited co-founder of a New Zealand based technology venture, a co-founder and director of Creative Forest, principal at GeniusNet Research and an advisor at ThincLab.
