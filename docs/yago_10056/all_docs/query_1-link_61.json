        "text": "The 2011 South-By-Southwest Festival kicks off today, with a slate of films that includes some of the most hotly anticipated movies of the year.\n\nMel Gibson's \"The Beaver,\" which many feared would never see the light of day after all of the actor's personal and legal troubles, will finally make its world premiere on Wednesday night. In it Gibson stars as a man struggling with depression, who finally finds a way to communicate with the people around him: via a beaver hand puppet. It'll be interesting to see the reaction to the film, but we won't really know what Gibson's future looks until the masses get a chance to vote with their dollars.\n\n\"Source Code,\" starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a soldier who must keep reliving the last eight minutes of another man's life until he can stop the deadly bombing that killed him and countless others, also makes its debut. It's directed by Duncan Jones (aka Zowie Bowie), whose last film was the critically-acclaimed \"Moon.\"\n\nAmong the other films on offer are the alien chase comedy \"Paul,\" starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost; \"Super,\" a very dark comedy starring Rainn Wilson as a regular guy who turns himself in a super hero to rescue his wife from a drug dealer; and \"Win Win,\" a very funny and touching film starring Paul Giamatti as a lawyer/wrestling coach whose life becomes entangled with that of a client's estranged grandson.\n\nAnd it wouldn't be SXSW without a healthy dose of the rock music, with bands like the Foo Fighters and Le Tigre being among those starring in documentaries.
