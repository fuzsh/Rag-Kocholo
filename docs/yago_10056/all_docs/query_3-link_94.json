        "text": "Love Plus One\n\nGrace (Debra Messing) rejects an ex-boyfriend's (guest star Jeremy Piven, \"Cupid\") suggestion that she participate with him and his girlfriend (guest star Maria Pitillo, NBC's \"Providence\") in a romantic escapade but when she confides in Will (Eric McCormack) and Karen (Megan Mullally) - who falls down laughing at the prospect - the conservative Grace considers throwing caution to the wind. Meanwhile, Will tries to help a newly employed Jack (Sean Hayes) meet a customer (guest star Patrick Dempsey, \"Scream 3\") at a clothing store by prompting him with witty lines like a latter-day Cyrano de Bergerac.\n\nDrew Gets Married\n\nDrew returns disheveled and frustrated after a convention in Las Vegas. After losing his luggage and all of his money, a waitress named Diane took pity on him and they went out for drinks. She took Drew to a rock and roll chapel to get married and he went through with it, thinking it was a drunken prank. Unfortunately, the ceremony was legal. Diane admits she needed to get re-married in order to keep custody of her two kids. She convinces Drew to pose as her husband for a week to fool the social worker."
