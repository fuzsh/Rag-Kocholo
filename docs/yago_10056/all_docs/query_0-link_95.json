        "text": "In 2002, well before the current wave of verite style comedy had hit around the world, director Michael Dowse and writer-stars David Lawrence and Paul Spence created a cult sensation with FUBAR. The foul mouthed, moc doc style comedy about a pair of Canadian headbangers - one of whom is afflicted with 'nut cancer' - premiered at Sundance before becoming a true cult hit at home and around the globe. And now they're back.\n\nFUBAR II will open the Midnight Madness program at the Toronto International Film Festival and here's an excerpt of programmer Colin Geddes' description:\n\nIt is time to once again \"Turn up the good, turn down the suck,\" as headbanger relics and lifelong friends Dean (Paul Spence) and Terry (Dave Lawrence) are re-united for more mullet mayhem in Fubar II. Director Michael Dowse has returned to the world of his 2002 instant cult hit to check in on the lives of this motley pair of metalheads in Alberta, only to find that Old Lady Responsibility is tugging on their ears and dragging them into the world of respectable employment and domesticity.\n\nFollowing a celebration of Dean's five years of being nut-cancer free, which turns into a fiery eviction party, the boys realize they're weary of constantly trying to give'r while barely scraping by. When their old buddy and party leader, Tron (Andrew Sparacino), promises to hook them up with jobs on the pipelines in Fort McMurray, they jump into their '86 Cutlass Supreme - the trunk precariously overloaded with a flat of Pilsner - and head to the Mac in search of sweet cash...\n\nTIFF has just posted a first look at FUBAR II over on their Facebook page and you can also check it out below."
