        "text": "Dean Murdoch & Nightseeker :: Giv’r till it hurts\n\nby Sheldon Birnie\n\nDean Murdoch (aka Paul Spence) is one of the deadliest dudes to ever pick up a bass guitar, shotgun a Pilsner, and just fuckin’ giv’r shit. Made (in)famous by his role in Fubar and Fubar 2: Balls to the Wall, Deaner has since moved on from the Mac and kept his heavy metal band Nighseeker rocking from coast to coast. The Deaner and Nightseeker are hitting Winnipeg and Brandon on October 25 and 26. Gettin’ ready to giv’r, Stylus caught up with the Deaner, over the phone, as he was finishing a bag of chips earlier this week. Here’s how our conversation went down.\n\n[Editor’s Note: The following post is probably NSFW, and certainly contains deadly references to partying hard and giv’n’r to the fuckin’ max. You have been warned.]\n\nNova :: Midnight, Midnight and the beauty & frustration of Winnipeg\n\nby Darcy Penner\n\nOf the many ways one usually expects a band to form (from the ashes of previous bands, high school friends jamming with beer stolen from their parents, the side-project that was only supposed to be about fun, etc.), Nova’s inception has a unique flare to it: a release for workaholics bonded by their love of, and commitment to, Winnipeg. That, and two-thirds of the band didn’t really play their instruments. Continue reading “Nova :: Midnight, Midnight and the beauty & frustration of Winnipeg”\n\nWeekenders 10/17 – 10/24\n\nAnother busy weekend here in Winnipeg. What are YOU doing with your time? Continue reading “Weekenders 10/17 – 10/24”\n\nHillbilly Highway – Carly Dow rolling solo\n\nby Sheldon Birnie\n\nWinnipeg folk fanatics undoubtedly know Carly Dow from her prior performances around Winnipeg with a variety of acts over the years, most notably Bog River. But after a couple solid years with the boys in Bog River, releasing a full-length and touring out west and back, the band recently called it a day. Now Carly Dow is stepping out onto the stage on her own again, with a big gig at the Folk Exchange on October 20th. Continue reading “Hillbilly Highway – Carly Dow rolling solo”\n\nThe Be Good Tanyas – A Collection\n\nThis new career spanning collection from Vancouver’s The Be Good Tanyas is a nice overview of the ladies’ work from 2000 through 2006, and also includes four previously unreleased tunes for the diehard fans. Continue reading “The Be Good Tanyas – A Collection”\n\nMadchild – Dopesick\n\nShane Bunting, aka Madchild, has been through some difficult times these past five years. The heavily autobiographical 16 track solo LP Dope Sick largely chronicles his battle with drug addiction. Continue reading “Madchild – Dopesick”\n\nRae Spoon – First Prairie Grass Fire\n\nFirst Prairie Grass Fire provides an honest look at growing up in Calgary and experiencing Hell from all sides. Difference is publicly ridiculed and at home considered sinful, there is no safe place but in song. Continue reading “Rae Spoon – First Prairie Grass Fire”\n\nWeekenders 10/11 – 10/14\n\nphoto: Darcy Finley Photography\n\nWhat’s up around Winnipeg this weekend? Aren’t you glad you asked! Continue reading “Weekenders 10/11 – 10/14”\n\nHillbilly Highway – Dylan rumbles through Boomerville\n\nby Sheldon Birnie\n\nI hit the Bob Dylan show at the MTS Centre last week when he cruised into town on the Hillbilly Highway, and I’m sure glad I did. It’s the third time I’ve seen ol’ Bob, and it was possibly the best performance I’ve seen him churn out in the nine years that span those three dates, and certainly more enjoyable than Dylan’s last Winnipeg date, back around 2009.
