        "text": "I met up with Dave Lawrence and Paul Spence—who you will almost immediately recognize as Terry and Deaner—about halfway into a long press day at Edmonton’s Matrix Hotel. They’d been up doing radio morning shows since 7am, getting into character for TV appearances most of the morning, and I was the last chat before lunch. That, combined with the just-broken-into case of Pil sitting on the counter, probably explains the general looseness of the conversation.\n\nWell, so, how’s the day going?\n\nDavid Lawrence [to Spence]: You look like Freddie Mercury, man.\n\nPaul Spence [stretching out on a desk]: I am Freddie Mercury, with this jacket. [it was leather, though more ‘high school punk’ than ‘gay icon’]\n\nDL: Borat shouldn’t be playing Freddie Mercury, you should.\n\nPS: Is Borat playing Freddie Mercury?\n\nDL: Yeah.\n\nPS: Huh. Yeah, well, anyway, pretty good, now that the Pilsners are here. I shotgunned a beer on K97, and then all of the sudden the beers dried up, and that was, like, 8.\n\nDL: Now he’s happy again.\n\nPS: Well, yeah. I don’t mind drinking beer in the morning, as long as I can have another one. Though I can also not drink beer in the morning, too.\n\nDo you guys carry the Pilsner around with you for these kinds of things?\n\nPS: No, that’s the problem. That’s what I’m realizing: if you leave it up to someone else, it’s not really their problem, so it’s just like ‘Yeah yeah yeah, we’re working on it.’ Meanwhile, a couple hours go by, your beer buzz drops and you’re doing five TV interviews and I can feel the mini, baby two-beer hangover creeping in.\n\nDo people get the context of Pilsner everywhere else? Does that translate?\n\nDL: There’s a lot of people who ask if we invented it for the film.\n\nPS: The cool thing though is that pilsner is a type of beer, so when you say ‘Let’s have a pilsner’ in Ontario or whatever, they at least kind of know what you’re talking about. We didn’t really pick it for that purpose—we were drinking Pilsner anyway when we wrote the first ten pages in our basement in Calgary in 2000. That’s what fuelled the first part of it. Dave—you look half-dead man.\n\nDL: I’m listening to you go. I’m listening.\n\nPS: Hey, check out those jeans: Dave got those in Toronto. Di-e-sel.\n\nDL: Have you been wearing yours?\n\nPS: Nah, they don’t fit.\n\nDL: Are they too big?\n\nPS: Yeah, they’re too big. Or, well, they’re too long.\n\nI hear you can get those hemmed.\n\nPS: I’m waiting for that, yeah. Because, I mean, baggy jeans—just not cool, man.\n\nAnyway, to go back to your basement drinking Pilsner, initially where did this all come from? Where these characters you guys were working on, or did you have the story first?\n\nDL: The characters started at the Loose Moose Theatre.\n\nPS: It all started with Terry.\n\nDL: It all started with Terry for sure. I was improvising a character for, like, five years, and then we decided to make a film out of it.\n\nPS: Yeah. Meanwhile, I would do a headbanger character every once in a while.\n\nDL: Every Halloween.\n\nPS: Yeah. This was back in the day, in the ’90s, where you could get a pair of super sweet hightops like these, a tight RATT or whatever t-shirt and stuff at Value Village for a dollar. You add in a cheap wig and you have a headbanger costume for like ten bucks. It was never Dean, though, it was just a funny headbanger guy. Then I kind of modelled Dean off Terry.\n\nDL: We used to do theatresports, all the different games, and then it was, ‘what happens if headbangers do theatresports?’ and the audience really liked it. That’s sort of where it really started. Then we did this late-night variety talk show called Hot Nuts and Popcorn—we actually did a run of it here at the Fringe festival—and Terry was the Paul Schafer character. From there, I met Mike [Dowse, director and co-writer] on his first film, and on the set I told him I wanted to make a fake documentary about this character.\n\nSo, coming back for number two—Fort McMurray just seems like a really natural fit for these guys.\n\nDL: Yeah, I think the whole time with the script, we really wanted to just stay true to these characters. From the first pass, we wanted to figure out what would really happen with these guys. And Fort McMurray was a no-brainer. Every banger out there wants a quick fix to get rich, and that’s the stigma of Fort McMurray: people come from all over Canada to make quick money.\n\nPS: Dave and I both worked up in Fort St. John on the pipeline, so—well, there’s two types of writing. You can try to be creative and really inventive and that kind of thing, or you can write what you know. In the context of these characters, writing what you know really works the best. Fort McMurray is really the hot spot of these things, and how funny would it be to sort of have that juxtaposition of these two meatheads out in Fort McMurray, where there’s a lot of other meatheads.\n\nDL: Which isn’t to say that—like, there’s a lot of guys in Fort McMurray who work hard at these jobs, and it is a good place to make some money.\n\nPS: I was sitting beside a guy on the plane who lives in Edmonton and works up there, and he was just kind of a white collar guy, but it’s a tough town to work in whether you’re in the office or the oil patch. You have to deal with that town, and it’s so isolated—you have to have a certain tolerance for …\n\nDL: Well, yeah, even if it’s just partying. I mean, are you just going to sit in your hotel room for six months?\n\nPS: You’re actually going to go out and get drinking and hanging out with the population. People seem to have a good time up there.\n\nDL: Yeah, but you can tell it’s a lonesome place, too. People are up for the money, they’re not up there because the town is booming with culture or anything. Not to say that there’s not that there, but you have to go find it. There’s other sorts of things …\n\nPS: That Irish Pub we went to was pretty alright.\n\nDL: It was Saint Patty’s day.\n\nPS: Well, yeah. But—and there’s this secretive, curious thing about the Newfie club up there. We tried to get into it twice, and both times there’s guys at the door who wouldn’t let us in. They’d say it was closed.\n\nDL: And then we left and they opened it up again. Apparently that’s the real place to be, but it’s hard to get in.\n\nPS: Obviously, we couldn’t get in. But yeah, we just wanted to see what it’s like, and there’s just these big guys who are like ‘This isn’t a bar.’\n\nDL: These aren’t the droids you’re looking for.\n\nPS: I’m still very curious what’s behind that door.\n\nDL: That being said, I wish we could have had more Newfoundlanders in our film. There’s one token Newfie guy, but there’s a big scene up there.\n\nPS: It’s tough, though, because you’re trying to make a film and be true to the reality of the place, but you’re working in the realm of like—well, they have to be actors and follow everything else. We wanted the band to be Newfoundlander musicians who played awesome electric guitar, and I searched and searched, on YouTube and posting things everywhere, but there just wasn’t a guy from Newfoundland who actually plays awesome heavy metal in northern Alberta. So we ended up just getting some dudes who could play. But that Newfoundland thing—like, when I worked up in Fort St. John, that was the thing: my two best friends were from Newfounland, and they kind of kept me sane. Rod and Chet Davis. They were like 22 and 27, I think, and I was 18, so they were kind of my window to the world, these guys who came from Kipperidge Farm, Newfoundland. The smallest place in the universe. And it was like, ‘What do you want to do today?’ and they said ‘We’re going out drinking.’ And that was the plan. They just got on a snowmobile, brought a giant, massive thing of rum, and we went into the woods with a gun. And that was our day off from the pipeline. We didn’t even see any animals, we were just shooting at stuff, getting wasted and driving around on a snowmobile. And I was like, ‘Okay, so this is fun.’\n\nDL: That sounds super fun.\n\nPS: Don’t get me wrong, it was fun. I never would have done that in a million years: on my day off, I wouldn’t have got on a snowmobile, driven into the woods with a gun and a 40 of rum, right? That was my introduction to how people party up north.\n\nThat’s interesting, because this is actually the first representation of a pretty important, big thing in the province and the country in any way. I know it’s a comedy, but …\n\nPS: Yeah, I totally agree.\n\nDL: What’s the big thing, though?\n\nPS: Fort McMurray.\n\nYeah. Besides some environmental documentaries, no one has ever really gone up there and try to explore just how people are living.\n\nPS: Yeah, not in a finger-wagging documentary type of thing, there’s never been a film that has beautifully shot the oil sands and the byproduct of things. It looks really good, but it also looks really bad. Strange juxtaposition.\n\nDL: It’s like out of Blade Runner or something. But yeah, another reporter was asking if we were trying to make a poignant statement about the environment or blue collar labour and different class systems and all that, but, like, not really. The characters decided that, and there’s no statement, that’s just what’s happening.\n\nPS: Terry and Dean are the kind of guys who, if the jobs are there, they don’t give a fuck …\n\nDL: Fuck all the ducks.\n\nPS: Yeah. They don’t care if Shell Canada is this that or the other, as long as they get their paycheque and live there lives. Is that a statement on the characters being bad people? I don’t think so. It’s ultimately up to the companies to be responsible.\n\nDL: It’s the same as the first film, though. People will read into stuff much deeper than you ever intended. We’re just trying to tell a story, and from that story people will glean whatever they want, and I’m sure people will read in deeper than we ever meant. I’m sure. Terry and Dean represent humans and the world is so …\n\nRight. Waiting for Godot.\n\nDL: I’ve actually been wanting to do Waiting for Godot with these characters—I did the first act a while back. And it’s perfect: just waiting outside a 7-11, [in his Terry voice] ‘Well, nothing to be done.’ ‘How did you came to come around to that opinion?’\n\nWell, even if it’s not that kind of deep, in both films, there are these moments of sweetness that you wouldn’t really associate with these guys. Like, the joke at the funeral in the first one, and here that moment of recognition about who the actual father is—these pretty tender sort of bits. Is it hard to bring that out of these guys, or does that just flow from who they are?\n\nDL: I think it flows pretty good, because they’re not the types that will get deeply emotional about anything, so to have a tender moment that’s kind of how bangers address it. Like [quiet nod]—just kind of pushing through or powering through those deep moments in a light way. They’d never expose themselves or be vulnerable. It’s not that difficult to show them shotgunning at a grave or joking at a funeral, because they have this pride in themselves that will never allow them to every be emotionally vulnerable. So stuff like that, it’s like, ‘Why don’t you come home for christmas?’ ‘Okay.’ There’s nothing more to be said. These characters do lend themsevles to more serious stuff, because they’re impenetrable to any emotional thing.\n\nThe other thing is, these guys some like really distinctly Albertan characters to me. So how does that translate elsewhere?\n\nDL: Well, a lot of people say that, yeah, they’re so Albertan. But you go to places in Ontario or BC or Nova Scotia, and you get so many people saying, ‘I went to high school with these guys.’ That’s a common thing. There was a guy exactly like this in high school.\n\nPS: I think it’s just kind of like the rebel. The banger is this weird non-rebel rebel, particularly in a small town, where any person who’s slightly different, their differences get exaggerated by the fact everyone else is not like that. How many people are really into metal in a smalltown, whether that’s Alberta or Ontario or Saskatchewan. You’re the one guy who listens to MegaDeath and has long hair, so you stick out. Everyone has that memory of the guy who stuck out. I went to school in Calgary, and it was a pretty big school, but there was a couple guys like that. I don’t think it’s necessarily Albertan—or, like, Albertans identify with them because we’re from here, but if we had the movie in Toronto or Pickering, they would have said, ‘Oh, you’re so Ontario.’ It’s a universality of these Canadian kind of hosers.\n\nDL: Or Australia or wherever. There’s bangers everywhere, they just might look a bit different.\n\nPS: Although I think the Canadianess, why people can identify with them, is that they’re generally speaking nice people. They’re opinionated and certainly kind of backwards, but they’re not mean or evil guys. You can see the guy kicking the shit out of some guy’s truck, but you could also see him lending you a cigarette after you got beat up.\n\nDL: Or after he beat you up.\n\nPS: Yeah, like, you’re kind of scared of them, but they’re not evil or anything."
