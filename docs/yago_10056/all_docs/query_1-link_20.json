So it was a challenge because they have such a strong, triangle-like dynamic, and it was my worst fear that I would screw that up.\n\n“And also, just trying to blend into their world because, you know, the fans really are there for them.\n\n“But they rolled me into some really wild stuff and I just dived in.”\n\nOn top of this, TNT FUBAR currently runs on Trailer Park Boys’ online SwearNet.com, with a new season coming out soon.\n\n“The premise of that show is Terry and Trish are trying to get custody of their kid Deano back, just so they can get the child tax credit,” Lawrence laughs.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“With Shanks,” who first appeared Age of Computer, “we’re going banger family.”\n\nOK, if you’re still following all these paths, it’s time to talk about the wider MC-Fu multiverse — namely a little Toronto-filmed Netflix series called, ahem, Fubar — starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nLawrence says he didn’t want to share his franchise’s name and have the Internet searches messed. “But then my lawyer’s like, ‘Dave, Skydance and Netflix are worth $8-billion — do you have lots of extra houses and boats?’ And he suggested that instead of trying to fight them, that I negotiate with them. And so we have a co-existence agreement.\n\n“But I had no choice,” Lawrence stresses. “I tried to say no, but my lawyer said they would have just buried me in legal, so now he’s going to be buying me ten speeds for the rest of my life, basically.”\n\nBack to the OG FUBAR, one of its best characters was reluctant party machine Tron, played by Calgary actor and musician Andrew Sparacino — who died in Nanaimo last April.\n\n“It was quite upsetting,” says Lawrence. “He struggled with addiction for so long.\n\n“Even now I’m listening to some of his recordings. When he went into rehab he said he’d only go if I got him an eight-track recorder and some instruments.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Probably as talented guy as I’ve ever met.\n\n“He was known for Tron, but he really was a wordsmith, his vocabulary and lexicon were incredible, a real gift for poetry and rapping.”\n\nAll these random highs and lows wheel us back to Sunday’s chaotic FUBAR Live, currently touring western Canada, which gets back to the roots of where FUBAR originated.\n\n“My training sort of started in the Theatresports realm where we would do competitive improv,” Lawrence says of Calgary’s Loose Moose Theatre in the ’90s. “After a few years of it some friends of mine were like, ‘What if our Theatresports team were just headbangers?’ and we tried to stay in character the whole time.\n\n“Headbangers doing drama is pretty funny, because they’re not good at it,” Lawrence laughs.\n\n“They’re kind of jam-packed with pride,” he says of the cultural species he’s been riffing off for almost a quarter century. “Even if they’re totally wrong, they’re quite clever and will scurry out of situations.\n\n“Let’s say they don’t have a driver’s licence,” he suggests, “they’ll talk about how fast they are on the ten-speed, and how they don’t even want a car.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“If a banger can’t drive,” Lawrence laughs, “he’ll really convince himself he doesn’t want to.”\n\nThe two of us share our metal heroes — he’s an AC/DC and Maiden lifer — and if that particular subset of humans is disappearing, replaced by millions of new ways to self-identify.\n\n“I think they’ve thinned out,” says Lawrence. “But even with Stranger Things and Metallica making a big comeback, you see kids rocking the T-shirts.\n\n“And if you follow the bands, they’re still around.\n\n“And you know,” he says, there’s still 18-year-old roofers and painters, discovering drugs and trying to avoid jobs.\n\n“Some of them are a little less classic look with the jean jacket and leather, but the attitude is still there.”\n\nfgriwkowsky@postmedia.com\n\n@fisheyefoto\n\nPREVIEW\n\nFUBAR Live Just Give’r Western Canada Tour\n\nWhere Union Hall\n\nWhen 7 p.m. Sunday\n\nTickets $33.35 or $18.20 two for one at unionhall.ca\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
