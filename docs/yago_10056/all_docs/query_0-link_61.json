In fact, it was coming out within weeks of Spence’s own record, which he was releasing as Dean (the Deaner) Murdoch, the fictional bass player made famous by the mockumentary Fubar.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nFubar's Deaner saves humanity with new Nightseeker record Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nSo Spence requested an interview with Shearer, who stayed in character the whole time. The resulting piece, which appeared on the Vice website last month, was headlined “Spinal Tap Bassist Derek Smalls Reveals His Cure for Erectile Dysfunction.” Like most musicians, Spence is an obsessive fan of Rob Reiner’s 1984 comedy classic This is Spinal Tap, which follows a disastrous tour by the fictional British heavy metal band.\n\nNear the end of the interview, he told Shearer/Smalls about his own upcoming album: Nightseeker’s 3069: A Space-Rock Sex Odyssey.\n\n“It was totally surreal,” says Spence, in an interview from his home in Montreal. “I mentioned it to him and told him that he was always my favourite in Spinal Tap as a bass player. I said ‘Well, what do you think of the band Nightseeker?’ He just kind of rolled with it, he’s such a great improviser.”\n\nIt led to long-haired, moustachioed heavy-metal bass player Derek Smalls singing the praises of a new album by long-haired, moustachioed heavy-metal bass player Dean Murdoch.\n\n“I can’t wait for more Night. Waiter, bring me more night, please. I dig it,” Smalls offered, which is now quoted in the promotional material for Nightseeker’s opus.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAs film scholars know, This is Spinal Tap spearheaded the mockumentary sub-genre and was at least indirectly responsible for films such as Fubar, Michael Dowse’s Calgary-shot, no-budget masterpiece that chronicled the dim-witted adventures of Cowtown metalheads Dean Murdoch and Terry Cahill (David Lawrence). They were characters that Calgary natives Spence and Lawrence created as teenagers on the stage of Loose Moose Theatre, the pioneering improv company that also nurtured comic talents such as the Kids in the Hall alumni Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney.\n\nFubar became a sensation at the Sundance Film Festival in 2002, attracting enough of a cult following to justify a sequel, 2010’s Fubar: Balls to the Wall, and most recently a television series for Viceland that found Dean and Terry discovering the Internet and other computer magic for the first time after fleeing the Fort McMurray fires. But while the main premise of last year’s eight-episode Fubar: Age of Computer was certainly amusing, Spence thought it was a little thin to carry the show. So he also brought Dean’s fledgeling music career as a falsetto-voiced bass player front and centre, which led him to write a bunch of songs for Nightseeker.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I didn’t see enough in Terry and Dean meet the Internet,” Spence says. “To me, there wasn’t enough motivation to getting the story going again without something new, which to me was the band because we had never really explored that angle in either of two movies. Sure enough, that for me was the most fun aspect. All of a sudden we were writing songs and now we have enough for an actual record.”\n\nWhile the songs on 3069: A Space-Rock Sex Odyssey may not be quite as self-consciously goofy as those found on Spinal Tap’s 1992 record, Break Like the Wind, they do share some common ground with the Tap. Specifically, it’s performed by musicians with stellar skills. Musical incompetence isn’t particularly funny. As with Spinal Tap, much of the humour comes from the fact that fairly silly songs are presented with full-on musical ability and studio polish.\n\n“We were so fortunate to have a little bit of a budget,” Spence says. “You listen to our record and, in many ways, I’d like to think you’re blown away by the production values. It’s not four guys in a garage with a two-track recorder. It sounds really big, that’s what I was going for. That’s why we didn’t do a record until now because we wanted to do it right.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn an interview with Postmedia, Spence spends a good 10 minutes describing the meticulously detailed concept behind Nightseeker’s ambitious concept album. It involves the Deaner’s interstellar adventures that begin with him as the sole survivor of a worldwide apocalypse. He soon discovers that the Earth was destroyed by underground-dwelling Amazon women as retribution for humanity’s less-than-respectful treatment of the planet.\n\n“So Dean satisfies them all sexually, the whole tribe, and then they set him on fire anyway,” Spence says. “They are chanting ‘Survivor! Survivor!’ So certain doom is upon him, this is now chapter three, and he calls upon the Nightseeker, which is a creature that can do your bidding. But the upshot is that you have to surrender him your soul.”\n\nThe tale eventually involves a dragon and a magical axe — i.e. the Deaner’s bass guitar — and Dean ascending to godlike status and confronting a “Space Goddess Priestess,” who he also beds and convinces to save mankind. Or something like that.\n\nAll of this is wrapped in glorious, Queen-like multiple-tracked vocals, thunderingly fast rhythms and complex guitar riffs. The music is not inauthentic or a joke for Spence, who says he became a fan of heavy metal while putting together the soundtrack for the original Fubar film.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Once you get past that the first layer of hard-rock from the ’80s and ’90s — Metallica, Aerosmith, Guns N’ Roses — there’s a whole bunch of other stuff behind it,” he says. “I was like a garage-rock nerd, I’d shun stuff that was popular if it was on the radio just for the fact it wasn’t unknown and cool. I slowly came to realize that not only was this stuff good, but I really, really identified with it. Headbangers, when we first made Fubar, were totally parodied. None of us was (a) headbanger. We saw them from miles away, these guys with long hair, moustaches had muscle cars. We were nothing like them. We were suburban punk-rock listening kids and they were a joke. But the more I listened to it, the more I realized I was totally in tune with what rockers were doing and they were having way more fun than anybody else.”\n\nSo Nightseeker is now described as a “non-fictional band of fictional character Dean from Fubar.” Still, there are no plans at the moment for a whirlwind tour. On Saturday, the four-piece Nightseeker will play an album release party at Toronto’s iconic Horseshoe Tavern and some Western Canada dates may eventually happen.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn 2013, Spence embarked on a three-week, cross-country tour with the band as the Deaner. He stayed in character for all shows, as he did for press interviews.\n\nHe learned his lesson: Three weeks as the Deaner is a long, tough haul.\n\n“When I say the word deadly, it really did seem like none of us were going to make it out alive,” he says. “The onus was on me to provide not only entertainment musically but also to be the party leader. The funny thing is, I could if I wanted to, leave. There’s nothing in my contract that stipulates I have to stick around. But once you’re there in the moment, you see how genuinely excited people are to see you and you see a lineup of people and all they want is a picture. Some want to shotgun a beer and go crazy, but most just want a picture and shake your hand.”\n\n“I can’t not hang out with them, I can’t not spend those extra two hours after a show drinking beers and just hanging out with people and getting their stories,” he says. “What I should have been doing, because I had another 20 shows to do, was sleeping somewhere getting ready for the next show. Instead, I was out all night.”\n\n3069: A Space-Rock Sex Odyssey will be released on April 20.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
