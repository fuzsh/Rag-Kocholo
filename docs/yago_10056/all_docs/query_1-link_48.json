        "text": "Characters from the Canadian cult classic FUBAR will jump from screen to stage at a performance in Red Deer next week.\n\nThree cast members from the world of FUBAR – Dave Lawrence as Terry Cahill, Terra Hazelton as Trish and North Darling as Shank – will bring the improvised comedy show FUBAR Live to Bo’s Bar and Stage on Monday, April 1.\n\nFUBAR, released in 2002, is a low-budget mockumentary that follows lifelong Alberta friends Terry Cahill and Dean Murdoch (played by Paul Spence) – on Dean’s last weekend before undergoing surgery for testicular cancer, the two metal-loving headbangers are joined by a film crew for a camping trip. In addition to starring as Terry, Lawrence served as the film’s writer.\n\nSince its release, the improv-driven film has garnered a cult following and spawned the sequel FUBAR 2: Balls to the Wall in 2010. A pair of spinoff series have been released as well: 2017’s FUBAR: Age of Computer and 2022’s TNT FUBAR.\n\nHazelton’s character Trish joined the FUBAR brand in the 2010 sequel and Darling’s character Shank debuted in the 2017 series. Lawrence, Hazelton and Darling all have improv backgrounds with Loose Moose Theatre in Calgary.\n\n“It’s fun to have that rush you get from not knowing what’s going to happen. It’s a lot of fun to keep the audience guessing. That’s where a lot of the fun comes from – every night is completely different,” Lawrence told The Advocate on Sunday.\n\nLawrence describes FUBAR Live as a play filled with improv and plenty of crowd interactions. The story is centred around his character Terry trying not to ruin Trish’s birthday.\n\nThe Red Deer show is part of a Western Canadian tour, which begins in Regina, Sask. on Thursday. The crew has done a handful of live shows in the past, but this is the first time they will be touring under the FUBAR brand.\n\n“We did a few short runs of A Very Terry Christmas at the Loose Moose Theatre,” Lawrence said.\n\n“That was in a proper theatre. This is really the first time we’re trying to bring a little more theatre to the bar. We used to do improv at the bar quite a bit with standup, but not as the FUBAR characters. This is really the first time we’re doing this.”\n\nLawrence said he’s excited to connect with fans of FUBAR at the upcoming live shows.\n\n“The fans of the film have usually seen it a few times so they feel like they have a connection with the characters,” he said.\n\n“People usually have a great story about the first time they saw the film or how it helped them at the right time. I know a few guys who were like, ‘I saw FUBAR and decided to get checked (for testicular cancer).’ … I’ve been told stories of people dealing with cancer and how out film came at the right time for them and gave them a good laugh.”\n\nMore than 20 years after the original film was released, Lawrence said he’s proud FUBAR has continued to resonate with people.\n\n“I feel like a lot of people know somebody they grew up with who was like Terry or they have an uncle like Terry. I used to think it was just in Alberta, but this culture exists all over the world. I spent some time in Australia and some people were like, ‘I know someone just like that.’ … I did a bit of work with the Trailer Park Boys and they knew people exactly like Terry too. It was cool to have a character everyone can relate to.”\n\nLawrence added that he feels lucky knowing FUBAR and his character Terry have had such staying power over the years.\n\n“If some back then told me, ‘Twenty years from now, you’re going to be improvising as this character still,’ I wouldn’t have believed them,” he said.\n\n“I knew at the time that it felt real because we were improvising. What we were doing didn’t feel like a typical movie.”\n\nFor more information or to purchase tickets, visit www.fubar-themovie.com."
