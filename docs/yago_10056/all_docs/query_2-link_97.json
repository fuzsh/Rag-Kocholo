Hazelton plays Trish, a strip club waitress with a heart of gold and Terry's love interest. Those familiar with the first Fubar film will know Sparacino — who played Terry and Dean's old friend and \"party leader\" Tron — a role that he reprises in the sequel. We talk Fubar 2, music, LARPing and World of Warcraft, and even have enough time to shotgun a few beers."
