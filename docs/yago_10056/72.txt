FUBAR 2 (also known as FUBAR: Balls to the Wall or FUBAR: Gods of Blunder) is a 2010 comedy film and the sequel to the 2002 cult film FUBAR. It was released on October 1, 2010 in Canada. It made its world premiere by opening the Midnight Madness program at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.

In Calgary, Terry (David Lawrence) and Dean (Paul Spence) are tired of barely scraping by on menial jobs. Recently evicted from their rented house, they are out of options until their old buddy and "party leader", Troy (better known as Tron) (Andrew Sparacino) gets them high-paying jobs laying oil pipeline in Fort McMurray.

While Terry quickly becomes a welcome member of the pipeline crew, Dean cannot take the pace of work and decides to injure himself for the Workersâ€™ compensation money with Tron's help, however he quickly finds that the money offered is much less than he had expected. Flush with money and confidence, Terry starts dating Trish (Terra Hazelton), a waitress at the local strip bar who has slept with every member of the pipeline crew at one time or another. When Terry quickly moves in with Trish, Dean does his best to save his friend from fading into a domestic lifestyle.
