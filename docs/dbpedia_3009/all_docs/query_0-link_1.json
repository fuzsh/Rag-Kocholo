        "text": "September–October 1922.\n\nTurkish nationalists under Mustapha Kemal were unhappy about the loss of territory to Greece under the Sèvres treaty of 1920. They expelled the Greeks from Smyrna by force in August 1922 and threatened to cross the Dardanelles. Britain feared for the security of the Straits. Lloyd George reinforced British positions in Chanak, thus blocking the Turks. Conflict was averted by an agreement settled on 11 October. Eastern Thrace and Adrianople were returned to Turkey in return for recognition of the neutral zones of the Dardanelles."
