After the analysis of the British Near Eastern policy throughout the 19th century up until the Chanak Crisis, the author concludes that the confrontation at Chanak was basically a continuation of the Eastern Question, which had revolved around the Anglo-Russian rivalry over the control of the Turkish Straits. While Britain pursued the closure of the Straits until the World War I to prevent Russia accessing to the Mediterranean, the British post-war strategy focused on ensuring the “freedom of the Straits.” The Turkish advance toward Chanak after the victory over Greeks, however, posed a great threat to British plans. In the face of hints of the cooperation between the Turkish Nationalists and Russia, the British government, therefore, took a decision to hold Chanak at the risk of military confrontation.",
