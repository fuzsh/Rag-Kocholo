        "text": "One way to approach the disaster that overtook Greece in 1922-3, the ‘Asia Minor Catastrophe’, is to browse the transcript of the so-called ‘Trial of the Six’ which took place in November 1922.Footnote 1 The Six were Dimitrios Gounaris, the chief of the Greek government for most of the period leading to the trial, and five of his colleagues: Petros Protopapadakis and Nikolaos Stratos, each of them prime minister for a short period; Nikolaos Theotokis, war minister; Georgios Baltatzis, foreign minister; and the sixth, Georgios Hatzianestis, commander of the Greek army in Asia Minor at the time of its collapse in August 1922. A book by the historian Thanasis Diamantopoulos explores the trial in some detail.Footnote 2 There is also a book by the writer Vasilis Vasilikos,Footnote 3 consisting of a memoir by his father Nikos of the army's arduous expedition deep into the interior of Asia Minor, in summer 1921, which was halted at the Sakarya river not far from Ankara. This book contains also a much abridged and controversial version of the proceedings of the Trial of the Six, written to be performed on stage. But readers should start with the full transcript of the trial, or Diamantopoulos’ book, rather than Vasilikos. These reveal the final reckoning with those whom the 1922 ‘revolution’ of Plastiras and others chose to regard as the guilty men, who must pay with their lives to expunge the shame of the army's defeat. The reckoning came on 15 November 1922 with the execution of the Six at Goudi in the Athens suburbs. The books I refer to focus on the responsibility of politicians for the disaster. They do not convey the pain of the many thousands of Greeks of Asia Minor uprooted from their homelands.\n\nThe ‘Asia Minor Disaster’ (or ‘Catastrophe') is the usual term for the collapse of the Greek army, its evacuation – or flight – to Greece, and the destruction of Smyrna, all of which took place in 1922. The disaster includes also the exchange of Greek and Turkish populations agreed at Lausanne in 1923. These events inflicted on Greece a trauma greater than any other in the life of the independent Greek state. The catastrophe did not come out of the blue. It had origins, and an afterlife. I shall present in this essay some of the ways in which the story has been presented by Greek and British historians. The Greek press has been particularly active in republishing works so as to reach a new generation."
