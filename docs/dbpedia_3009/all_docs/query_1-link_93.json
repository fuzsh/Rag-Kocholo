        "text": "The POD is in 1918. Lloyd George unknowingly misled the House of Commons in claiming that Haig's forces were stronger at the start of 1918 than they had been a year earlier – in fact the increase was in the number of labourers, most of them Chinese, Indians and black South Africans, and Haig had fewer infantry, holding a longer stretch of front. The prime minister had used incorrect information furnished by the War Department office headed by Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice. Maurice then made the spectacular public allegation that the War Cabinet had deliberately held soldiers back from the Western Front, and both Lloyd George and Bonar Law had lied to Parliament about it. Instead of going to the prime minister about the problem Maurice had waited and then broke King's Regulations by making a public attack. Lloyd George vigorously defended his position and won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. Meanwhile Asquith did not react (1).\n\nDuring the summer of 1918, Lloyd George secretly negotiated with Asquith. The two reconciled and decided to put their party above. Lloyd George and his wing would stand with the Liberal Party in the upcoming election (2).\n\n(1) IOTL, Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George, which further ripped apart the Liberal Party.\n\n(2) IOTL, Following confidential negotiations over the summer of 1918, it was agreed that certain candidates were to be offered the support of the prime minister and the leader of the Conservative Party at the next general election. To these candidates a letter, known as the Coalition Coupon, was sent, indicating the government's endorsement of their candidacy. 159 Liberal, 364 Conservative, 20 National Democratic and Labour, and 2 Coalition Labour candidates received the coupon. For this reason the election was sometimes known as the coupon election.\n\nIn the general election of December 1918, Asquith and Lloyd George led the Liberal Party. He did express that sentiment about reparations from Germany to pay the entire cost of the war, including pensions. He said that German industrial capacity \"will go a pretty long way\". We must have \"the uttermost farthing\", and \"shall search their pockets for it\".(1) As the campaign closed, he summarised his programme 2)\n\n1-Trial of the exiled Kaiser Wilhelm II;\n\n2-Punishment of those guilty of atrocities;\n\n3-Fullest indemnity from Germany;\n\n4-Britain for the British, socially and industrially;\n\n5-Rehabilitation of those broken in the war; and\n\n6-A happier country for all.\n\nThe election was fought not so much on the peace issue and what to do with Germany, although those themes played a role. More important was the voters' evaluation of Lloyd George in terms of what he had accomplished so far and what he promised for the future. His supporters emphasised that he had won the Great War. Against his strong record in social legislation, he himself called for making \"a country fit for heroes to live in\".\n\nHowever, the Conservatives was able to win many seats from the Asquithian wing of the Liberals, who was discredited due to their mishandling of war effort.\n\nIn the end, the Tories won 379 seats and gained the overall majority (IOTL, non-Coupon and Coupon Tories won a total of 379 seats). The Liberal Party won 183 seats, Labour won 57 seats (like OTL). In Ireland, Sinn Fein achieved a landslide victory over IPP (73), getting most of the latter's seats.\n\n(1): LG said this IOTL\n\n(2): This was LG's promised programme when he led the Coalition IOTL.\n\nVersailles 1919:\n\nBonar Law represented Britain at the Versailles Peace Conference, clashing with the French Prime Minister, Georges Clemenceau, the US President, Woodrow Wilson, and the Italian Prime Minister, Vittorio Orlando. Unlike Clemenceau and Orlando, Bonar Law on the whole stood on the side of generosity and moderation. He did not want to utterly destroy the German economy and political system&#8212;as Clemenceau demanded&#8212;with massive reparations. The economist John Maynard Keynes looked askance at Bonar Law's economic credentials in The Economic Consequences of the Peace, calling the Prime Minister a \"half-human visitor to our age from the hag-ridden magic and enchanted woods of Celtic antiquity\".\n\nBonar Law was also responsible for the pro-German shift in the peace conditions regarding borders of Poland. Instead of handing over Upper Silesia (2,073,000 people), and the southern part of East Prussia (720,000 people) to Poland as was planned before, the plebiscite was organised. Danzig (366,000 people) was organised as Free City of Danzig. Poles were grateful that he had saved that country from the Bolsheviks but were annoyed by his comment that Poles were \"children who gave trouble\". Asked how he had done at the peace conference, he commented, \"I think I did as well as might be expected, seated as I was between Jesus Christ [Wilson] and Napoleon Bonaparte [Clemenceau] (1).\n\n(1): These were said by Lloyd George IOTL\n\n(2): The Treaties of Saint Germain, Neuilly, Triannon, Sevres would happen like IOTL\n\n(3): Germany would face the same punishments as IOTL\n\nIrish War of Independence - Irish Civil War\n\nIn the December 1918 election, the Irish republican party Sinn Féin won a landslide victory in Ireland. On 21 January 1919 they formed a breakaway government (Dáil Éireann) and declared independence from Britain. Later that day, two members of the armed police force, the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), were shot dead in County Tipperary by IRA members acting on their own initiative. This is often seen as the beginning of the conflict. For much of 1919, IRA activity primarily involved capturing weapons and freeing republican prisoners. In September that year the British government outlawed the Dáil and Sinn Féin, and the conflict intensified thereafter. The IRA began ambushing RIC and British Army patrols, attacking their barracks and forcing isolated barracks to be abandoned. The British government bolstered the RIC with recruits from Britain—the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries—who became notorious for ill-discipline and reprisal attacks on civilians.\n\nWhile around 300 people had been killed in the conflict up to late 1920, there was a major escalation of violence in November that year. On Bloody Sunday, 21 November 1920, fourteen British intelligence operatives were assassinated in Dublin in the morning; then in the afternoon the RIC opened fire on a crowd at a football match in the city, killing fourteen civilians and wounding 65. A week later, seventeen Auxiliaries were killed by the IRA in an ambush at Kilmichael in County Cork. The British government declared martial law in much of southern Ireland. The centre of Cork City was burnt out by British forces in December 1920. Violence continued to escalate over the next seven months, when 1,000 people were killed and 4,500 republicans were interned. The fighting was heavily concentrated in Munster (particularly County Cork), Dublin and Belfast. These three locations saw over 75% of the conflict's fatalities. Violence in Ulster, especially Belfast, was notable for its sectarian character and its high number of Catholic civilian victims.\n\nBoth sides agreed to a truce on 11 July 1921. In May, Ireland had been partitioned by an Act of the British Parliament, which created Northern Ireland, despite the fact that County Fermanagh, Tyrone, Derry City and border regions had voted by a majority for nationalist candidates in the 1918 General Election. The post-ceasefire talks led to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921. This treaty ended British rule in 26 counties of Ireland and, after a ten-month transitional period overseen by a provisional government, the Irish Free State was created as a self-governing state with Dominion status on 6 December 1922. However, six north-eastern counties remained within the United Kingdom. After the ceasefire, political and sectarian violence between republicans (usually Catholics) and loyalists (usually Protestants) continued in Northern Ireland for many months.\n\nIn June 1922, disagreement among republicans over the Anglo-Irish Treaty led to an eleven-month civil war, which was won by the Pro-Treaty Force supported by British Government.\n\n(*): Bonar Law presided over the Government of Ireland Act 1920 which partitioned Ireland into Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland in May 1921 during the war of independence (this was done by Lloyd George IOTL). He soon afterwards began negotiations with IRA leaders to recognise their authority and to end a bloody conflict. This culminated in the Anglo-Irish Treaty signed in December 1921 with Irish leaders. Under it Southern Ireland, representing over a fifth of the United Kingdom's territory, seceded in 1922 to form the Irish Free State.\n\nHi I am back\n\nChanak Crisis:\n\nThe Turkish troops had recently defeated Greek forces and recaptured İzmir (Smyrna) on 9 September 1922 and were advancing on Constantinople in the neutral zone. In an interview published on Daily Mail, 15 September, leader of the Turkish national movement Mustafa Kemal Atatürk stated that: \"Our demands remain the same after our recent victory as they were before. We ask for Asia Minor, Thrace up to the river Maritsa and Constantinople... We must have our capital and I should in that case be obliged to march on Constantinople with my army, which will be an affair of only a few days. I must prefer to obtain possession by negotiation though, naturally I cannot wait indefinitely.\" The British Cabinet met in the same day and decided that British forces should maintain their positions. On the following day, in the absence of Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, certain Cabinet ministers issued a communiqué threatening Turkey with a declaration of war by Britain and the Dominions, on the grounds that Turkey had violated the Treaty of Sèvres. On 18 September, on his return to London, Balfour pointed out that this would enrage the Prime Minister of France, Raymond Poincaré, and left for Paris to attempt to smooth things over. Poincaré, however, had already ordered the withdrawal of the French detachment at Chanak but persuaded the Turks to respect the neutral zone. Balfour reached Paris on 20 September and, after several angry meetings with Poincaré, reached agreement to negotiate an armistice with the Turks.\n\nOn 23 September, the British Conservative cabinet, which was pro-Turk, decided to give East Thrace to the Turks, thus forcing Greeks to abandon it without a fight. This convinced Kemal to accept the opening of armistice talks and on 28 September he told the British that he had ordered his troops to avoid any incident at Chanak, nominating Mudanya as the venue for peace negotiations. The parties met there on 3 October and agreed to the terms of the Armistice of Mudanya on 11 October, two hours before British forces were due to attack.\n\nBritish and French forces were ultimately withdrawn from the neutral zone in summer 1923, following the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne.\n\nLeague of Nation (1919-1920)\n\nAt the start of the First World War the first schemes for international organisation to prevent future wars began to gain considerable public support, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, a British political scientist, coined the term \"League of Nations\" in 1914 and drafted a scheme for its organisation. Together with Lord Bryce, he played a leading role in the founding of the group of internationalist pacifists known as the Bryce Group, later the League of Nations Union. The group became steadily more influential among the public and as a pressure group within the then governing Liberal Party. In Dickinson's 1915 pamphlet After the War he wrote of his \"League of Peace\" as being essentially an organisation for arbitration and conciliation. He felt that the secret diplomacy of the early twentieth century had brought about war and thus could write that, \"the impossibility of war, I believe, would be increased in proportion as the issues of foreign policy should be known to and controlled by public opinion.\" The 'Proposals' of the Bryce Group were circulated widely, both in England and the US, where they had a profound influence on the nascent international movement.\n\nIn 1915, a similar body was set up in the United States by a group of like-minded individuals, including William Howard Taft. It was called the League to Enforce Peace and was substantially based on the proposals of the Bryce Group. It advocated the use of arbitration in conflict resolution and the imposition of sanctions on aggressive countries. However, none of these early organisations envisioned a continuously functioning body; with the exception of the Fabian Society in England, they maintained a legalistic approach that would limit the international body to a court of justice. The Fabians were the first to argue for a \"Council\" of states, necessarily the Great Powers, who would adjudicate world affairs, and for the creation of a permanent secretariat to enhance international co-operation across a range of activities.\n\nThe British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in early 1918, under the initiative of Lord Robert Cecil. The British committee was finally appointed in February 1918. It was led by Walter Phillimore (and became known as the Phillimore Committee), but also included Eyre Crowe, William Tyrrell, and Cecil Hurst. The recommendations of the so-called Phillimore Commission included the establishment of a \"Conference of Allied States\" that would arbitrate disputes and impose sanctions on offending states. The proposals were approved by the British government, and much of the commission's results were later incorporated into the Covenant of the League of Nations.\n\nAt the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Wilson, Cecil, and Smuts all put forward their draft proposals. After lengthy negotiations between the delegates, the Hurst-Miller draft was finally produced as a basis for the Covenant. After more negotiation and compromise, the delegates finally approved of the proposal to create the League of Nations (French: Société des Nations, German: Völkerbund) on 25 January 1919. The final Covenant of the League of Nations was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the Treaty of Versailles. On 28 June 1919, 44 states signed the Covenant, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the Triple Entente or joined it during the conflict.\n\nThe League would be made up of a General Assembly (representing all member states), an Executive Council (with membership limited to major powers), and a permanent secretariat. Member states were expected to \"respect and preserve as against external aggression\" the territorial integrity of other members and to disarm \"to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.\" All states were required to submit complaints for arbitration or judicial inquiry before going to war. The Executive Council would create a Permanent Court of International Justice to make judgements on the disputes.\n\nDespite Wilson's efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1919, the United States did not join. Opposition in the Senate, particularly from two Republican politicians, Henry Cabot Lodge and William Borah, and especially in regard to Article X of the Covenant, ensured that the United States would not ratify the agreement.\n\nThe League held its first council meeting in Paris on 16 January 1920, six days after the Versailles Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations came into force. On 1 November 1920, the headquarters of the League was moved from London to Geneva, where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920.\n\nThe human and material losses of the World War in Britain were enormous. They included 745,000 servicemen killed and 24,000 civilians, with 1.7 million wounded. The total of lost shipping came to 7.9 million tons (much of it replaced by new construction), and £7,500 million in financial costs to the Empire. Germany owed billions in reparations, but Britain in turn owed the U.S. billions in loan repayments. Britain owed money to the USA, and in turn was owed four times as much money by France, Italy and the other Allied powers, although under the Bonar Law government Balfour had promised that Britain would collect no more money from other Allies than she was required to repay the USA; the debt was hard to repay as trade (exports were needed to earn foreign currency) had not returned to prewar levels. Worse, on a trip to the USA, Stanley Baldwin, the inexperienced Chancellor of the Exchequer, agreed to repay £40 million per annum to the USA rather than the £25 million which the British government had thought feasible, and on his return announced the deal to the press when his ship docked at Southampton, before the Cabinet had had a chance to consider it.\n\nBritish economy, after booming throughout the war, began to suffer a serious slump due to the end of war orders. By 1921, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed as a result of the postwar economic downturn. The situation was exacerbated by the Geddes Axe, which substantially cut spending on various areas including defense, housing, education and health. The government was criticized heavily by both Liberal and Labour for failing to introduce necessary reforms and to relieve unemployment. Asquith, the Liberal Leader, declare that if his Party won the next election, he would fulfill the promise to make Britain ''A Land fit for Heroes''.\n\n1923 General Election:\n\nAusten Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin decided to turn towards a degree of protectionism which would remain a key party message during their lifetime. With the country facing growing unemployment in the wake of free trade imports driving down prices and profits, Chamberlain aimed to win a secured majority in the general election in December 1923 to seek a mandate to introduce protectionist tariffs which, he hoped, would drive down unemployment and spur an economic recovery. His proposal was strongly supported by Chancellor Baldwin.\n\nHe expected to unite his party but he divided it, for protectionism proved a divisive issue. Meanwhile, the Liberal and Labour Parties fought on a policy of maintaining free trade. The Liberals also criticized the Tories for allowing mass unemployment to exist, for failing to deliver ''Homes fit for Heroes'', and for failing to stand up against the Turks.\n\nAs a result, the Liberal Party had won the General Election with a minority. The results were:\n\nLiberal 259 seats 39.0% of the total vote 5,797,501 votes\n\nConservative 37.3% seats 32.6% of the total vote 5,542, 818 votes\n\nLabour 90 seats 17.8% of the total vote 2,646,328 votes\n\nOthers 19 seats 3.8% of the total vote 561,874 votes.\n\nThe Liberals did extremely well against the Conservatives in agricultural seats in England. A major reason for this was the large decline in agricultural prices from 1920. The price of wheat per hundred weight in 1923 was down by 59%, while that of barley was 58% less.\n\nTo the relief of many Liberals, Winston Churchill standing as a Liberal was defeated in the Labour held seat of Leicester West.\n\nHerbert Asquith became Prime Minister of a Liberal government. Here is a partial list of his cabinet.\n\nPrime Minister and Leader of the House of Commons: Herbert Asquith\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer: David Lloyd George\n\nForeign Secretary: Sir Edward Grey\n\nHome Secretary: Reginald McKenna\n\nPresident of the Board of Trade: Walter Runciman\n\nColonial and Dominions Secretary: Charles Frederick George Masterman\n\nWar Secretary: Richard Haldane\n\nIndia Secretary: The Marquess of Crewe\n\nPresident of the Board of Education: Herbert Fisher\n\nLloyd George was unofficially Deputy Prime Minister, though he did not have that actual title.\n\nThree ministries were founded soon after the government was formed: Agriculture, Health and Transport, which were held by George Lambert, Christopher Addison, and Sir Alfred Mond.\n\nThere was no urgent foreign policy crisis facing the new Liberal government when it took office. Its foreign policy was based on wholehearted support for the League of Nations in the tradition of Liberal internationalism. It wanted a prompt settlement of the German reparations question.\n\nThe Liberal Party had been anti-Turkish since the 1870s. In its manifesto for the 1923 general election (1) it declared:\n\n''It was not enough that we should abandon all for which we fought against Turkey in the war. By the shameless Treaty of Lausanne we have also surrendered all the securities for British commerce in Turkey which we enjoyed before the war''.\n\nI assume by \"all for which we fought against Turkey in the war\" is meant the partition of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThere was much support and sympathy among Liberals for the restoration of an independent Armenia in Anatolia, to which Turkey had agreed by the Treaty of Sevres in 1920. This treaty was annulled by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 which established the present day borders of Turkey in OTL.\n\nIn March 1924, Foreign Secretary Grey proposed to the League of Nations Council that a plebiscite be held in the area designated as independent Armenia by the Treaty of Sevres. He was not supported by any major power. France might have been been the most sympathetic and anti-Turkish, but that country was a signatory of the Treaty of Lausanne and Raymond Poincare who was Prime Minister of France then was still PM in February 1924.\n\nThe United States was not a member of the League of Nations and was not a signatory to the Treaty of Lausanne, though the United States had participated as an observer. The Wilson administration had backed the cause of Armenian independence, though Admiral Mark Bristol, the US High Commissioner in Constantinople from 1919 -1927, did everything in his power to combat the pro-Armenians in that administration. Charles Evans Hughes, Secretary of State from March 1921, had been a leading member of the American Committee for the Independence of Armenia (ACIA) but had resigned from that body in February 1921. His policy now was pragmatic accomodation with Turkey.\n\nThe British government's Armenian policy was also strongly supported by the British Armenia Committee.\n\nOn April 24, 1924 in a speech to the British Armenia Committee, the Prime Minister, Herbert Asquith, said that the British people will never forget the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by the Turks between 1915 and 1916, and their attempted destruction of Armenian culture and the Armenian nation, truly a crime against humanity. (1) He affirmed that the British government will do all that is practicable to ensure justice and freedom for the Armenian people. Aurora Mardiganian, an Armenian woman survivor of the massacres, and author of the book Ravished Armenia published in 1918, and a star of the film of the same name made in 1919, also spoke at the meeting.\n\nAsquith's speech was vehemently denounced by the Turkish government of Mustafa Kemal, which denied that there the government of the Ottoman Empire had authorised any massacres of Armenians or the destruction of Armenian culture. Turkey broke off diplomatic relations with Britain.\n\nBecause of the hundreds of thousands of Muslims in the British Empire - in India, Egypt, Mesopotamia and other countries, the British government stressed that its Armenian policy was not anti-Muslim. It also rejected any idea that it supported Greek claims to Turkish territory. However a House of Commons motion advocating that Constantinople be made into a free city under the protection of the League of Nations was signed by 71 Liberal MPs.\n\nWhile the government's Armenian policy was supported by Liberals, Labour and some Conservatives, most Conservatives opposed it. They accused the government of being unnecessarily antagnostic towards Turkey, which was a bulwark against Communist Russia. Also Britain needed to maintain good relations with Turkey for the sake of its oil reserves. These were denounced by Liberals as ''claptrap''.\n\n(1) The term genocide had not yet been coined.\n\nWinston Churchill resigned from the Liberal Party on January 18, 1924, the day after Asquith became Prime Minister because his Liberal government had the support of the Labour Party. He called it a base surrender to socialism. He said that he would be an anti-socialist independent, and that he would try to return to the House of Commons when a suitable seat becomes vacant in a by-election.\n\nThe second reading of the Representation of the People Bill took place in the House of Commons on February 8, 1924. The Representation of the People Act 1918 had given the vote to women aged 30 or over, who were eligible to vote in local government elections because they were ratepayers (local taxpayers) or the wives of local ratepayers. The new bill gave the vote to all women aged 21 or over on the same terms as men at the next general election.\n\nIt was supported by Liberals and Labour. The Conservative leadership was officially neutral. They were in favour of equal suffrage at age 21 in principle, but they argued that the change was too soon after the last one in 1918 and that it should be after agreement among all parties.\n\nHowever a sizeable number of Conservative MPs argued that women in their twenties were too young to be given the franchise. One called them flighty young ....... Sir William Bull (Hammersmith South), who was a member of the Speakers Conference in 1917 which accepted the principle of female franchise, thirty was the compromise age which was agreed to by women's suffrage organisations. Although they denied this version of the Conference, it was supported by other Conservative MPs.\n\nThe Second Reading was passed by a substantial majority. But while 67 Conservatives voted against, 51 voted in favour including Nancy Astor (Plymouth: Sutton) who gave what was generally regarded as the most brilliant speech in favour of the bill. Of course, the Liberals stressed the fact that only a minority of Conservative MPs had voted for giving women the vote at age 21 or over.\n\nIn the Committee Stage two Conservatives tabled an amendment to equalise the voting age at 25 for both men and women. But they received little support even from their own party.\n\nMeanwhile the Daily Mail was mounting a campaign against the bill and what it called the \"flapper vote\". It condemned the lack of principles of the Tory leaders.\n\nAfter the bill had received its Third Reading in the House of Commons it went to the Conservative dominated House of Lords. It received its Second Reading there in early May 1924. Enough Conservative Lords abstained to give it a majority. By the middle of the month it had received the royal assent and had become law."
