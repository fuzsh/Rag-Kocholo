        "text": "It took a full week after London declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 for the governments of all of the old dominions to decide to stand by Britain. In Australia and New Zealand there was no hesitation. Australia simply accepted that it was bound by the British declaration, just as it had been in 1914. New Zealand made its own declaration, but with so little hesitation that, because of the time difference, it actually became a belligerent before Britain. Prime Minister Savage of New Zealand summed up antipodean loyalty to the UK: ‘Where she goes we go. Where she stands we stand.’ In Ottawa, Prime Minister Mackenzie King insisted on consulting parliament, but support for Britain was so overwhelming that Canada declared war without a formal vote. In South Africa there was heated debate. Prime Minister Hertzog proposed neutrality, but Jan Smuts, the deputy prime minister, was able to build an alliance favouring involvement. The dominions’ declarations of war brought relief and satisfaction in London. Since the Chanak crisis of 1922, when it had become clear that Britain could no longer count on military aid from the dominions, the Commonwealth had been a moribund force in international politics.\n\nIn that dark, terrific, and also glorious hour we received from all parts of His Majesty’s Dominions, from the greatest to the smallest, from the strongest to the weakest, from the most modern to the most simple, the assurance that we would all go down or come through together. You will forgive me if … I rejoice in the soundness of our institutions and proclaim my faith in our destiny.\n\n(Winston Churchill)"
