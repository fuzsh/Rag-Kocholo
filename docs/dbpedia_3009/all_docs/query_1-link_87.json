This thesis examines Lloyd George's role in the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire during his time as British Prime Minister from 1916-1922. It analyzes Lloyd George's foreign policy towards the Ottoman Empire and how he worked closely with other leaders like Clemenceau and Wilson to determine the fate of the Empire after World War I. While economic and social forces have replaced the \"Great Man\" theory of history, the thesis argues that Lloyd George's influence in breaking up the Ottoman Empire cannot be ignored. It aims to establish the roles of both Lloyd George and the British state in forming policies to dissolve the Empire, using primary sources from British archives.",
