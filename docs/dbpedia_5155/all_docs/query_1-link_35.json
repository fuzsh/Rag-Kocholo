The committee meets this morning to receive testimony from the distinguished Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld; General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and General John Abizaid, Commander of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM), on progress in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the war on terrorism, and such other aspects as relative to your area of operations. The committee will also look in their insights on the ongoing crisis involving Israel, Hezbollah, Lebanon, and to some extent, Palestine. Secretary Rumsfeld, the committee appreciates the changes you have made in your schedule that you have outlined to me very carefully and we welcome you this morning. Last week, in an historic visit the prime minister of Iraq met with President Bush, addressed a joint session of Congress, and spoke with military personnel at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. I was privileged to be present at all of those events and I think it was an extremely important chapter in the ongoing developments in Iraq that he took that time to come over here. He demonstrated the resolve of the Iraqi people to build a free and stable country. During the meeting with military personnel and their families--and I witnessed this in a very passionate and sincere way, he conveyed to those military people present at Fort Belvoir and for broadcast to military people all over the United States and the world the gratefulness in the hearts of the Iraqi people for their sacrifices of life and limb and that of their families in order to enable the people of Iraq to gain a measure of democracy, elect their government, and share in the freedom that we all have in this country. In meetings with Prime Minister Maliki, President Bush reaffirmed America's commitment to support Iraq's constitutional democracy and to help Prime Minister Maliki's government succeed. On July 25, President Bush said: ``The Iraqi people want to succeed. They want to end this violence.'' The President also said that ``America will not abandon the Iraqi people.'' I am, however, gravely concerned by the recent spike in violence and sectarian attacks, and the instability in Baghdad and recent decisions to extend the deployment of 3,500 American troops in Iraq and to relocate additional American forces to reinforce Baghdad. Those were important decisions made by you, Mr. Secretary, General Abizaid, and you, Chairman Pace. I hope that you will share with us this morning the reasons for doing so. I do not question the seriousness of this situation, the need to do it, but we should have a very clear explanation, because we had, I regret to say, expectations, largely generated by certain reports of General Casey, about the hope to draw down our forces in the near future. That is a question I hope that we address this morning, because I do not like to see the hopes of the men and women of the Armed Forces raised and then have to be changed and the impact on their families and indeed the confusion that results here at home when those decisions have to be made. But we recognize the President has said, as the Secretary has said, that ground conditions vary and they must be the determining factor. Additionally, I have expressed concerns about the potential impact of events in Lebanon and Israel and their cascading effect on the wider Middle East region, and specifically on the United States and coalition forces serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. My concern is--and I have expressed this publicly--that Israel was wrongfully attacked by Hezbollah. No one disputes that whatsoever. They have an unequivocal right to defend themselves. No one disputes that. But as our Nation engages in this situation, and historically we have been an honest broker in that region, as our Nation engages in that conflict to try and resolve it, we must do so in a way to be mindful of the implications on our commitments in the Iraq theater. The messages we send by virtue of our support to try and bring about a cessation of this conflict are transmitted throughout the Muslim world straight up into Iraq. It is my fervent hope that our men and women serving in uniform and others in Iraq will not be put at greater personal risk as a consequence of the rhetoric that flows, the decisions that are made, in trying to resolve that conflict. I will have further to say about that in the question period. In the nearly 5 years since U.S. forces initiated operations to liberate Afghanistan from the brutal rule of the Taliban and to eliminate al Qaeda training bases and sanctuaries, there has been remarkable progress in Afghanistan on the political, economic, and security fronts. The Afghan people have spoken in favor of freedom and democracy and I am pleased that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is taking an increasing and very important role in Afghanistan, and you are to be commended, Mr. Secretary, for initiating that move together with General Jones, who has been a strong advocate of trying to achieve that goal. However, recent reports from Afghanistan show that the violence is on the rise. We will learn from you, I hope, your concern as to that area of responsibility (AOR), General, and what the future holds in the face of a resurgence of the Taliban forces. While some in the West take freedom and liberty for granted, Americans everywhere should remain so proud of the contributions of our service men and women deployed in harm's way. They are bringing the best hope for freedom and democracy to Iraq and Afghanistan after decades of cruel oppression and their sacrifices have enabled us here at home to fully enjoy the freedoms that we have. As the current conflict in Lebanon and Israel proceeds, there is obvious concern that the crisis could spark a wider war. The firebrand Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said, ``We, the unified Iraqi people, will stand with the Lebanese people to end the ominous trio of the United States, Israel, and Britain, which is terrorizing Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and other occupied nations.'' He also said that he was ready to go to Lebanon to defend it. Now, we all recognize that he is just a hothead and a firebrand, but he is a troublemaker and I hope, General Abizaid, you can give us some assessment of the courage and the will of the Iraqi people, under the leadership of the prime minister, to begin a step that must be achieved, and that is the disbanding of these private militias, notably Sadr's. Back to Osama bin Laden. His deputy issued a worldwide call for Muslims to rise up against Israel and join the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza, raising again the specter of an Islamic caliphate that I clearly remember General Abizaid discussed in testimony before the committee last year. We hope you will bring us up-to-date on the Osama bin Laden situation and the ongoing activities of our forces together with others trying to bring about this man being brought to justice or otherwise taken care of. In light of all these developments, the mission in Iraq and Afghanistan is even more critical and your time with us today is critical. General Pace and General Abizaid, I want to express our gratitude to both of you and the countless men and women that you represent, for your continued service and historic efforts of our Nation's military to bring freedom and liberty to Iraq, Afghanistan, and to preserve it here at home. Secretary Rumsfeld, once again the committee welcomes you. Now, just before the committee meeting started General Abizaid offered to meet with Senator Levin and myself, for information of the members of the committee, and he outlined the progress being made with the various reports examining the activities of the chain of command relative to certain incidents in Iraq. It is our understanding, General Abizaid, that those reports will soon be given to you. There is a convergence of the criminal investigation together with the chain of command investigation under General Chiarelli. It is now in the overall commander of the Marine Forces, General Zilmer, and then it comes to you, and it is your hope and expectation that, working with the Secretary, those reports can be made available to this committee early on in September. Senator Levin. STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARL LEVIN Senator Levin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this very important hearing, and thank you to all of our witnesses for being here this morning. The American service men and women in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other trouble spots around the world are performing their duties magnificently. We salute them and their families. We thank them for their unselfish service and devotion to our Nation. Despite their heroic efforts, the security situation in Iraq continues to worsen. Sectarian violence is not only on the rise, it has eclipsed the Sunni insurgency and the terrorism of al Qaeda in Iraq in terms of the toll it has taken and the threats to Iraq's chances of stability. Our military leadership has identified Baghdad as the key, what they call the center of gravity, to success or failure in Iraq. The highly vaunted recent plan to stabilize Baghdad has not worked, and we are going back to the drawing board and sending more U.S. troops to the Iraqi capital. We are having difficulty finding sufficient troops for that purpose. The fact that the Army's Stryker brigade that is being sent to Baghdad is being extended past its 12-month rotation date by another 3 to 4 months speaks volumes about how our military is overextended and unable to find other units ready for immediate reinforcement in Iraq. While there appears to be an immediate necessity for additional troops in Baghdad, more troops will not be the ultimate answer. Our military leadership has repeatedly said there is no military solution, that there must be a political solution in Iraq. Iraqis reaching the political compromises now is more important and more critical to defusing the violence and conflict in Iraq. That is why we need to clearly tell the Iraqi political leaders that our commitment to Iraq is not open- ended, that we will begin the phased redeployment of our troops by the end of the year and that they must make the political compromises necessary to avoid all-out civil war and defeat the insurgency. When General Casey was asked at a press conference recently whether he still believed that there would be fairly substantial troop reductions over the course of this year, he said, ``I think so.'' Marine Corps General Conway testified before us last week at his confirmation hearing to be the next Commandant that, ``I personally believe that you will have Iraqis who have started to look at us as occupiers and are resisting us in some instances, whereas they would not resist an Iraqi force doing precisely the same thing.'' He also testified that it is critical that the Iraqis understand that our presence is not open-ended and unlimited. The President has assured the Nation that as Iraqi forces stand up we will stand down. General Dempsey, our senior general responsible for the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces, has said publicly that, ``The Iraqi army will be built by the end of this calendar year'' and that their army would be, ``fully capable of recruiting, vetting, inducting, training, forming into units, putting them in barracks, and sending them out the gate to perform their missions.'' Congress has been told that over 70 percent of Iraqi combat battalions are capable of independent counterinsurgency operations or capable of taking the lead in those operations. The Iraqi security forces are standing up. We need to begin to stand down with a phased redeployment starting by the end of this year. It is time for the Iraqis to take greater responsibility for the security of their own country. It is time to do what the President repeatedly said he would do. Now that the Iraqis have done a significant amount of standing up their troops, surely by the end of this year we should begin to stand down some of our troops. Now, not only do the operations in the CENTCOM region have broad implications on the future of that region, they are also having a serious impact on our own military. Our ground forces--the Army and the Marine Corps--are under enormous strain due to several years of large-scale deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. This is because a large amount of equipment has been left in Iraq and because the remaining equipment has been subjected to large amounts of wear and tear, there is a lack of readiness for Army and Marine Corps units which have redeployed to their home bases. It is argued that our units are more capable now because of organizational changes and the infusion of technology and better equipment. But that is only true if the units actually have the equipment on hand, and only if what they have on hand is in a high state of maintenance so that they can train for their potential contingencies. Hypothetically, if 50 combat units could now do what 100 units could do in the past, that would be true only if those units are ready to do so. Over two- thirds of the Army's combat brigades are not in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Army's own statistics show that the vast majority of those are not in command, or in command and control--in other words, by the Army's own measurements are not ready to respond to those contingencies which they must be prepared to do by Department of Defense (DOD) war plans. Mr. Chairman, again I thank you for calling this hearing and I thank our witnesses, all of them, for making the arrangements which they had to make in order to be with us this morning. Chairman Warner. Thank you, Senator Levin. Secretary Rumsfeld. STATEMENT OF HON. DONALD RUMSFELD, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE; ACCOMPANIED BY GEN. PETER PACE, USMC, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF; AND GEN JOHN ABIZAID, USA, COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND Secretary Rumsfeld. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Thank you for the invitation to testify. Senator Clinton, thank you for seconding the motion. I know we all agree that the American people deserve a healthy, preferably constructive, exchange on matters that so directly affect the lives, their lives, their families' lives, and their country's security. I am joined by General Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and General John Abizaid, the Combatant Commander of the U.S. Central Command. We will be providing an update on the global struggle against violent extremists and certainly we will welcome questions. In the past few weeks, in terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and now by Hezbollah, we have seen the face of the early part of the 21st century. In this period of asymmetric warfare, irregular warfare, one side puts their men and women at risk in uniform and obeys the laws of war, while the other side uses them against us. One side does all it can to avoid civilian casualties while the other side uses civilians as shields and then skillfully orchestrates a public outcry when the other side accidentally kills civilians in their midst. One side is held to exacting standards of near-perfection; the other side is held to no standards and no accountability at all. This enemy has called Iraq the central front on the war on terrorism, while some on our side seem to argue that the outcome in Iraq is not part of that global war on terror. Sixteen years ago this week, Saddam Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait, killing civilians, unleashing environmental devastation, provoking a crisis that led to Iraqi attacks on Israel and threats to Saudi Arabia and others in the region. Last week, by contrast, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, the new Iraqi prime minister, who was elected by the Iraqi people under a constitution the Iraqi people wrote and ratified, came to the United States to thank the American people for their assistance in building a new future for the people of Iraq. He had spent 25 years in opposition to the Saddam Hussein regime, and before a joint session of Congress he noted that if terror were permitted to triumph in Iraq then the war on terror will never be won elsewhere. The enemy understands this as well. They are waging a psychological war of attrition, planning attacks to gain the maximum media coverage and the maximum public outcry. They want us to believe that perseverance by us is futile rather than necessary. They want us to focus on our casualties and losses, not on the people causing the casualties and losses. They want us to think about what will happen if our forces stay in Iraq, as opposed to the consequences if our forces were to leave prematurely. They want us to be divided because they know that when we are united they lose. They want us pointing fingers at each other rather than pointing fingers at them. I know there are calls in some quarters for withdrawal or arbitrary timelines for withdrawals. The enemies hear those words as well. We need to be realistic about the consequences. If we left Iraq prematurely, as the terrorists demand, the enemy would tell us to leave Afghanistan and then withdraw from the Middle East, and if we left the Middle East they would order us and all those who do not share their militant ideology to leave what they call the occupied Muslim lands from Spain to the Philippines. Then we would face not only the evil ideology of these violent extremists, but an enemy that will have grown accustomed to succeeding in telling free people everywhere what to do. We can persevere in Iraq or we can withdraw prematurely until they force us to make a stand nearer home. But make no mistake, they are not going to give up whether we acquiesce in their immediate demands or not. Decisions about conditions for a drawdown of our forces in Iraq are best based on the recommendations of the commanders in the field and the recommendations of the gentlemen sitting beside me. We should strive to think through how our words can be interpreted by our troops, by the people of Afghanistan and Iraq, by our 42 allies in our coalition in Afghanistan, and our 34 allies in our coalition in Iraq. We should consider how our words can be used by our deadly enemy. The war on terror is going to be a long struggle. It is not something we asked for, but neither is it something we can avoid. But I remain confident in our mission, in our commanders, in our troops, and in our cause. I remain confident in the good common sense of the American people. Americans did not cross oceans and settle the wilderness and build history's greatest democracy only to run away from a bunch of murderers and extremists who try to kill everyone that they cannot convert and to tear down what they could never build. Over the past few years, I have had the honor of meeting countless young men and women in uniform, all volunteers, who have answered our country's call. I remember a serviceman outside of Afghanistan who looked me in the eye and said, ``I cannot believe that we are being allowed to do something so important.'' Our troops represent the finest and the most professional troops in history. I think of these remarkable people every day. I know that everything we do in the DOD and what you do on this committee affects them and their wonderfully supportive families. Thank you. Chairman Warner. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. General Pace. General Pace. Mr. Chairman, Senator Levin, members of the committee: it truly is an honor to be before you today representing the incredible young men and women in your Armed Forces. Since September 11, 2001, over 1 million young men and women in uniform have served this country in the CENTCOM area of operations and they have done so with incredible bravery and sacrifice and performance that has made us all proud. Their families have served this Nation as well as anyone who has worn the uniform, especially those families today in the 172nd Stryker brigade whose loved ones are not coming home when they thought they would be coming home and who once again are sacrificing so that we might provide the strength needed on the battlefield. It is now almost 5 years since September 11, 2001, and the number of young men and women in our Armed Forces who have sacrificed their lives that we might live in freedom is approaching the number of Americans who were murdered on September 11, 2001, in New York, in Washington, DC, and in Pennsylvania. We have come a long way in Afghanistan. We have come a long way in Iraq and elsewhere in the war on terrorism. We have a long way to go. We are a Nation at war. Fortunately, most of our fellow citizens are not affected by this war every day. Some 2.4 million Americans--Active, National Guard, and Reserve--have the privilege of defending over 300 million of our fellow citizens and countless millions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Our enemy knows they cannot defeat us in battle. They do believe, however, that they can wear down our will as a Nation. They are wrong. How do I know they are wrong? First, this committee and this Congress continue to provide the resources we need to defend this Nation, and I thank you for that. Second, our service men and women are proud of what they are doing and they are reenlisting in record numbers to continue to have the privilege to do what we do for this Nation. Third, as the Secretary mentioned in his comments, the American people have in the past, are now, and will in the future respond to attacks on our way of life. For 230 years we have met the challenges. This will not be easy, this will not be quick, and this will not be without sacrifice. But we will persist and we will prevail. I look forward to answering your questions today and working together with you in the future to defend this Nation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Warner. Thank you, General. General Abizaid. General Abizaid. Thank you, Chairman Warner, Senator Levin, members of the committee. Thanks for the opportunity to testify today. A couple of days ago I returned from the Middle East. I have rarely seen it so unsettled or so volatile. There is an obvious struggle in the region between moderates and extremists that touches every aspect of life. Such extremism, whether state-sponsored by Iran or ideologically motivated by al Qaeda and its associated movements, remains a serious danger to global peace and stability. My duties took me to Iraq, Afghanistan, Central Asia, and elsewhere in the Arabian Gulf, where our troops continue to perform with great professional calm and determination under dangerous and difficult circumstances. Of course, over the past several weeks the media has been filled with images of war in Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine. Indeed, U.S. forces under CENTCOM helped evacuate nearly 15,000 Americans from Lebanon's war zone. While the media's eye often directs public attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, it is important to remember that U.S. and coalition forces serve throughout Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Horn of Africa, increasing regional states' capacity to battle extremism and keeping open the vital air and sea links of the region. In the broader struggle against extremism, we face complex and potentially intersecting problems. Our strategic imperatives are formidable. With the continuing help of our friends, we must focus on three strategic objectives: We must synchronize the appropriate diplomatic, economic, and military means to defeat al Qaeda and its associated movements; we must deter Iranian designs for regional hegemony, to include its sponsorship of terrorist organizations and its development of nuclear weapons; finally, we must find a comprehensive solution to the corrosive Arab-Israeli conflict. I fully recognize that each of these tasks is filled with danger and enormous difficulties. I also realize that trying to solve any of these problems will take a considerable amount of time and effort. But failure to apply coordinated regional and international pressure against these three problems will further encourage extremism and could eventually lead to a broader, even more dangerous conflict. The arming of independent militias and the subsequent undermining of state institutions by these militias is the curse of the region. In many ways, interconnectedness brought on by 21st century globalization has been turned to the advantage by non-state actors. Globalization brings with it great benefits, but it also accelerates the dissolution of sovereignty in weak or corroded states. If this century is to be dominated by non-state actors with no responsibility to the international community, we are in for even greater dangers. It should not be lost on us, for example, that Hezbollah fields greater and longer-range weapons than most regional armed forces. If left unchecked, it is possible to imagine chemical, biological, or even nuclear weapons being transferred to militias or terrorist organizations by a state actor. In the highly unsettled Middle East, the problem of extremist-sponsored terror and intimidation is complicated. But we must be willing to talk about al Qaeda's ideological designs and face the implications of revolutionary Iran's ambitions, so often and so clearly stated by its president. There is no doubt that these are dangerous times for the world, but there should also be no doubt that, with concerted international action and the application of our own substantial power, these dangers can be overcome. Iraq sits at the center of the broader regional problem. Al Qaeda and Shiite extremists form terrorist groups and death squads to challenge the new government and undermine confidence in a better future. Iran talks about stabilizing Iraq, but, just as in Lebanon, it arms, trains, and equips local extremist Shiite militias to do Iran's bidding. As the primary security problem in Iraq has shifted from a Sunni insurgency to sectarian violence, al Qaeda terrorists, insurgents, and Shiite militants compete to plunge the country into civil war. Prime Minister Maliki and his new government know what must be done and in 3 short months in office are responsibly tackling the complex and difficult problems of security and governance. Iraqi security forces in conjunction with coalition forces must bring Baghdad, the center of sectarian violence, under control. Illegal militias must be disbanded. National reconciliation must proceed. Death squad leaders must be brought to justice. It is a decisive time in Baghdad and it requires decisive Iraqi action with our clear support. Despite the many challenges, progress does continue to be made in Iraq and I am confident that there are still many more people in Iraq trying to hold that country together than there are trying to tear it apart. Our ongoing support of their efforts is essential for their success, especially as they assume more and more responsibility for their own security. I know the committee wants to focus these hearings on Iraq, but I close with the reminder that Iraq is only one part of a broader regional struggle underway, one which requires the wise application of all our resources. Our own troops along with NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) continue to operate in Afghanistan. Pakistani and Saudi forces are fighting extremists daily. Insurgencies, secular violence, and terror sponsored by Sunni and Shiite religious extremist groups are pervasive throughout the region. Fortunately, as in our own society, the vast majority of the people in the region do not want extremists to win. Our challenge is to help these moderate forces help themselves in the struggle. Afghanistan, Iraq, and the entire region remain dangerous and often deadly. Our continued involvement in shaping regional security forces and providing the framework for regional action against extremist groups is essential for our own safety and prosperity at home. Finally, we must be ever mindful of the sacrifice of our young men and women in uniform. Out of the over 1.5 million service personnel who have rotated through the CENTCOM region since September 11, 2001, over 3,000 have given their lives. We owe them and their families an enormous debt of gratitude. Today nearly 200,000 of our troops serve in harm's way. These are incredibly dedicated and resourceful professionals. Thank you for your continued support to these great Americans, who willingly fight for all of us. Thank you. Chairman Warner. Thank you very much, General, for a very incisive and important statement that you have just made. We are going to depart from our normal rotation here. Senator Levin and I both serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. They are now having a meeting and the Senator from Michigan has to go to that meeting. Therefore I will offer you the first opportunity to initiate questioning. Senator Levin. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your invariable courtesies. General Abizaid, when General Casey was asked at a press conference recently whether he still believed what he said last year, when he predicted that there would be troop reductions over the course of this year, he said that he still believes there will be such reductions this year. Do you personally share that view? General Abizaid. Senator, since the time that General Casey made that statement it is clear that the operational and the tactical situation in Baghdad is such that it requires additional security forces, both U.S. and Iraqi. I think the most important thing ahead of us throughout the remainder of this year is ensuring that the Baghdad security situation be brought under control. It is possible to imagine some reductions in forces, but I think the most important thing to imagine is Baghdad coming under the control of the Iraqi government. Senator Levin. When you say it is possible to imagine some reduction in forces, you mean this year? General Abizaid. It is possible, depending upon how things go in Baghdad and how Prime Minister Maliki and his government grab hold of the security situation. Senator Levin. Is it important that the Iraqis understand that our commitment is not open-ended? General Abizaid. Sir, I think they fully understand it is not open-ended. Senator Levin. Some of their statements have not reflected that full understanding. But in any event, would you agree that it is important that they do understand our commitment is not open-ended? General Abizaid. I believe they do understand it is not open-ended. They know our commitment and they know the necessity for over time to increase their capacity against the extremists. Senator Levin. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, the President has assured the Nation frequently that as Iraqi security forces stand up we will stand down. They have stood up. The majority of their combat battalions are capable now of independent counterinsurgency or capable of taking the lead in those operations. Should we not, at least by the end of this year, begin to do what the President said we would do? Since the security forces of Iraq have stood up in such significant measure, should we not begin to stand down as the President said we would? Secretary Rumsfeld. Senator, you are correct, the Iraqi security forces are now up to something like 275,000. They are headed towards 325,000 by the end of the year, unless the prime minister makes an adjustment in those numbers, which as a new government he has every right to do in a sovereign nation. I guess the issue of drawdown depends on what you think your base is. We were up at 160,000. Today--we have gotten as low as I think 127,000. Today we are at 135,000 or 133,000, and certainly everyone from the Iraqis, the troops, and the President would hope that those troops could be drawn down as conditions permit. The question, the only difference between the way you phrase it and the President phrases it as he ends by pointing out that he intends to succeed here and he believes that the determinant should be the conditions on the ground, as opposed to some timetable. I do think the point you raise, the core of what you are asking, is important. That is the tension that exists between having too many troops and having it feed an insurgency. I believe, as indicated by General Conway, and having too few so that you do not have a sufficient number to allow the security situation to permit the political and the economic activities to go forward. That is a fair tension that exists there, and it is an art, not a science. There is no guidebook that says how to do that. So clearly we would all hope that there could be drawdowns on those forces as the conditions permit. Senator Levin. Thank you. The press reported that Iraqi President Talabani said yesterday that the Iraqi government is confident that Iraqi troops will take over security duties for the entire country by the end of this year. Then he also reportedly said that the recent increase in violence by insurgents is ``the last arrows in their quivers.'' Now, that phrase is reminiscent of Vice President Cheney's claim a year ago that the insurgency was in its ``last throes.'' General Abizaid, does our intelligence on the insurgency provide any basis for the assertion that the recent surge in violence represents the last arrows in the insurgents' quivers? General Abizaid. Senator Levin, I think it is clear that the insurgency has a lot of resiliency. It is probably going to last for some time, even after U.S. forces depart and hand over security control completely to the Iraqis. The question for President Talabani, as I have discussed with him before, whether or not over time the Iraqis can control it, and I believe they will be able to. Senator Levin. You do not agree, then, that it is in its last throes or that they are shooting the last arrows? General Abizaid. I am making no comment about what he said about last arrows or last throes. Senator Levin. Why? General Abizaid. I do not see any reason to dispute what the President says. I know that I think it is a long-term problem for Iraq that they will be able to work through over time. Senator Levin. According to USA Today, the British Ambassador to Iraq, Mr. Patey, made the following assessment. Mr. Patey has warned that Iraq is descending towards civil war, and he said it is likely to split along ethnic lines. He is reported as predicting that Iraq's security situation could remain volatile for the next 10 years. Do you agree, General, with the Ambassador from Britain to Iraq that Iraq is sliding toward civil war? General Abizaid. I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I have seen it, in Baghdad in particular, and that if not stopped it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war. Senator Levin. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, thank you. My time is up. Thank you again for allowing me to go ahead here. Chairman Warner. I want to go back to, Secretary Rumsfeld, the observations I made in the opening statement. On July 17 at about 8 o'clock, I went to the floor of the Senate. The Senate was about to consider a resolution, an important resolution reaffirming our support for Israel. But I said the following. I said I was concerned that we should take into account America's broader interests in the region as we approach this resolution. I said specifically: ``America's operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have taken the lives of more than 2,500 American servicemen, over 20,000 still severely wounded, and over $436 billion of our taxpayers' money over these 3 years.'' That is an enormous investment of this country, and the credibility of our country in many respects rests on the conclusion of that conflict in such a way that the Iraqi government can exercise sovereignty and bring about a measure of freedom and democracy. We are committed to that and I stand strongly with our President to achieve that goal. America's participation with other nations in achieving a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis, I can think of no problem of greater significance than our resolve to not let Iran possess nuclear weapons. The stability of the Lebanese government, that must survive, that government, such that they can once again take an even stronger grip on that nation and govern it. There is a lot at stake with our relationships with other nations. In a region in which our distinguished witness General Abizaid, who spent much of your lifetime in that region, just said, rarely have I seen it so volatile. It is subject to the corrosive relationships coming out of the Arab-Israeli conflict. My concern is that as we go into this situation, and we have an obligation to try and work as an honest broker, I hope, in resolving the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, as we pursue that and as our actions are interpreted by the Muslim world--and I read some of the statements of the clerics recently, in the last few days--I do not want to see our forces put at greater personal risk, subject to greater intensity brought against them by the adversaries in Iraq. So my question to you, Mr. Secretary, as we take up our role, hopefully as an honest broker in this, are we mindful of the broader picture and the enormity of our investment in Iraq as we try to do what we can to bring about a cessation of the fighting in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah? Secretary Rumsfeld. Mr. Chairman, in the meetings that I have been in with the President and the Secretary of State and those that are intimately involved in the situation in Lebanon and Israel with respect to the Hezbollah, there is a sensitivity to the desire to not have our country or our interests or our forces put at greater risk as a result of what is taking place between Israel and Hezbollah. I think I would suggest that it be phrased slightly differently because there are risks, as you point out, but it is a matter of relative risks. There are also risks, if one thinks about it, that Iran is the principal sponsor of Hezbollah. Iran is seeking nuclear weapons, as you posed. Iran is the supplier of weapons to Hezbollah. The rockets that are heading into Israel by Hezbollah tend to be in a number of cases Iranian rockets. Clearly, to the extent that Iran were to achieve weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and with a history of a willingness to work intimately with a terrorist organization like Hezbollah, there is that risk as well. So there are a variety of risks that we face in that region and it is a difficult and delicate situation. As I indicated in my opening remarks, I do believe what we are seeing is really the face of the 21st century. The wars we are engaged in and we see are not wars between militaries only; they are wars, they are clashes between systems, political, economic, and military. They are being fought with asymmetric and irregular warfare, which is very much to the advantage of the attackers. Chairman Warner. Mr. Secretary, that situation in Iraq is fragile. We need only look at the Baghdad situation. Baghdad could literally tilt this thing if we fail to bring about a measure of security for those people, tilt it in a way that we could slide toward a civil war that General Abizaid recalled. General Pace, I go back to the resolution of October 16, 2002, which I participated in, and my good friend to the left, in drawing up that resolution for the Senate. It authorized the President of the United States to use the Armed Forces of the United States to: one, defend the national security of our country against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; two, enforce all relevant United Nations (U.N.) Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq. Many of those missions set out and envisioned by Congress when it gave this authority, namely the toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime, have been achieved. But in the words of General Abizaid, we are on the brink of a civil war. I do not have the exact words before me, but I was struck by General Chiarelli's statement the other day that in his 35 years of military training he had really never spent a day preparing for what faces him as our commander of forces in Iraq, sectarian violence, civil war. What is the mission of the United States today under this resolution if that situation erupts into a civil war? What are the missions of our forces? General Pace. Sir, I believe that we do have the possibility of that devolving to a civil war, but it does not have to be a fact. I believe that U.S. Armed Forces today can continue to do what we are doing, which is to help provide enough security inside of Iraq for the Iraqi government to provide governance and economic opportunity for their citizens. The weight of that opportunity rests with the Iraqi people. We can provide support. We can help provide security. But they must now decide about their sectarian violence. Shiite and Sunni are going to have to love their children more than they hate each other. If they do that and seize the opportunity that the international community has provided to them, then this will be what we want it to be, which is a success for ourselves and the Iraqi people. But the weight of that shift must be on the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government. Chairman Warner. I think we have to examine very carefully what Congress authorized the President to do in the context of a situation if we are faced with an all-out civil war, and whether we have to come back to Congress to get further indication of support. General Abizaid, I have had the privilege of knowing you for a long time and I really think you speak with remarkable candor and draw on an extraordinary career of professionalism. You spent 1 year of your career in Lebanon. Lebanon is a part of your AOR as CENTCOM. Do you agree with the premise that in this current conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, recognizing that Hezbollah attacked Israel, recognizing that Israel has a perfect right to defend itself, but in so executing their military campaign it is essential in my judgment the Lebanese government not be toppled as a consequence of the infrastructure that is being destroyed in the course of this war, and can they achieve in this military operation such degradation of Hezbollah, its command and control, its inventory of weapons, as to result in a situation whereby a multinational force can eventually come in, subject to some form of a ceasefire, and begin to shore up, stabilize that government, and allow it to take firm control over the entirety of all aspects of sovereignty of the nation of Lebanon? General Abizaid. Mr. Chairman, U.N. Resolution 1559 clearly calls for the disarmament of Hezbollah and the extension of Lebanese sovereignty all the way from its northern border to its southern border. Had that resolution been implemented or started to move towards implementation, the current problem would be much less severe than it has become. The Iranians who have armed Hezbollah with cruise missiles, antiship missiles, missiles that can reach as far as Haifa and beyond, have given Hezbollah a state-like existence and capacity that is unlike any other militia anywhere in the region. It is absolutely essential that the Lebanese government regain its sovereignty over its own territory. It will in my opinion need an international force to help it do that. There are ways that, in conjunction with the international community, Hezbollah can be disarmed over time and the Shiite people that participate in the political life of Hezbollah can be readily accommodated within the Lebanese body politic. The question as to whether or not the Israelis can degrade Hezbollah over time, degradation can take place. I think it is also very clear to say that over time the consensus of holding Lebanon together under external pressure starts to break down. It is very important that Lebanon stay together as a sovereign country. It is key to stability in the Middle East and it is essential that that take place, and the international community needs to move in that direction. Chairman Warner. Thank you very much, General. Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy. Thank you very much. General, just to first of all thank you, General Abizaid, General Pace, thank you very much for your service. Welcome, Secretary Rumsfeld. I think you can understand why it is so important for your presence here, given these range of issues that are front and center for the American people. Let me ask you, General Abizaid, if we have difficulty with 130,000 troops in Iraq trying to disarm the insurgency, how in the world do we think we are going to be able to get an international force that is going to disarm Hezbollah? General Abizaid. Senator, I think with the weight of the international community and the right rules of engagement and the right participation of the various parties concerned, that over time Hezbollah can be disarmed. Senator Kennedy. Just to come back to a point that the chairman had mentioned about the costs in Iraq, the $400 billion total, 2,579 have been killed, 19,000 wounded, 54 casualties from my own State of Massachusetts, 70 percent of these from improvised explosive devices (IEDs). We have been in Iraq for 40 months and 13 days. The Korean War, 37 months. World War I, 19 months. The Persian Gulf War, 3 months. World War II, 42 months--VE Day, 42 months for VE Day, 45 months for VJ Day. The Civil War was 48 months. We have been in there now for 40 months and 13 days, with the finest military that has ever been developed, in basically rather a third-rate military situation. How much more do we really expect our military can do? How much more can we demand of them when they are out there doing such a proud and noble job of serving our country? How much more can we demand? Why not is this demand for political accommodation, why is that not front and center, so that we can start to bring our Americans home with honor? General Abizaid. Senator, I think there is a demand for a combination of military, political, and diplomatic activity that moves towards a solution that brings Iraq toward stability. I think over time it becomes less military and more diplomatic and more political. I believe that this current government, that is a 4-year government, has that opportunity. Senator Kennedy. Mr. Secretary, just to continue, the exact words that General Chiarelli said just last week, ``Quite frankly, in 33 years in the United States Army I have never trained to stop a sectarian fight. This is something new.'' Now, we hear General Abizaid talk about the increase in sectarian violence. How are our troops trained to deal with sectarianism? We know that they were not trained as well as they should have been when they first went into Iraq. They were not trained at Abu Ghraib. How are they trained now with this new sectarianism? How are they trained not to take sides? Is this new addition of troops in Baghdad the beginning? Are we going to have to have more troops to deal with this? What are our troops told in Baghdad now to quell the violence in this sectarianism? How are they going to not get drawn into one side or the other with the escalation of the sectarian violence? What is in their background, what is in their training, what has been in their leadership, that would give them the ability to not be involved in this, to quell the violence and to eventually help President Maliki disarm and dismantle the militias? Secretary Rumsfeld. Senator, I think your point is a valid one, that ultimately the sectarian violence is going to be dealt with by Iraqis and it is going to be dealt with by Iraqi security forces as a part of the solution, but it is going to be dealt with through a reconciliation process, a political process that Prime Minister Maliki and others in the country are trying to design in a way that it will pull together elements within the country and thereby reduce sectarian violence. I would rather have either of the generals comment on the training, except to say that the situation in Iraq, with 18 provinces, is really quite different in different provinces. We have forces in most provinces and the training is different for the different circumstances that they face. One of the things that the DOD has done is have extensive lessons learned from what is taking place in Iraq and different parts of the country brought back to the Joint Forces Command, the National Training Center, and the troops are then being trained up carefully to assure that they have the best kind of training they can have for the circumstances that we believe at the time they are going to find in the areas they are going to be assigned to. Senator Kennedy. My time is just about up. General Abizaid, could you expand on this, are they getting in with the growth of the sectarian violence? How do our troops get in there, not get embroiled in the sectarian violence, whether your estimate--is this the beginning or is this the end of the increased numbers of troops that we are going to need over there? How is their background and training actually going to quell that sectarian violence that you have identified as escalating at the present time? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Abizaid. Senator Kennedy, the first line against sectarian violence is the Iraqi armed forces. The Iraqi armed forces know where the problem is coming from. They know how to deal with the problem. They can recognize it easier than our troops can. But I would also tell you that our forces do have the capability to precisely target the secular death squad structure that is responsible for this activity, and more and more over time we have become proficient at being able to attack the secular structure of al Qaeda and we intend to use that capability and intelligence activity that we have used before to target the militia death squads that we are seeing operate now in Baghdad with a certain degree of freedom. Senator Kennedy. Thank you. Chairman Warner. Thank you. For the record, this is General Chiarelli's full statement. It is July 27, 2006. He said, ``For the military, the plan is unchartered ground. Quite frankly, in 33 years in the United States Army I never trained to stop a sectarian fight,'' he said. ``This is something new.'' That is the quote to which I referred to and Senator Kennedy referred to. Senator McCain. Senator McCain. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses and I want to repeat at the outset my firm belief that we can and must win in Iraq and that the consequences of failure would be catastrophic. General Pace, you said there is a possibility of the situation in Iraq evolving into civil war, is that correct? General Pace. I did say that, yes, sir. Senator McCain. Did you anticipate this situation a year ago? General Pace. No, sir. Senator McCain. Did you, General Abizaid? General Abizaid. I believe that a year ago it was clear to see that sectarian tensions were increasing. That they would be this high, no. Senator McCain. General Abizaid, we are moving 7,500 troops into Baghdad, is that correct? General Abizaid. The number is closer to 3,500. Senator McCain. 3,500? General Abizaid. Plus military police that were going there for other duties, that are being used in the outer cordon areas, military policemen in particular. Senator McCain. Where are these troops coming from? General Abizaid. The troops, the Stryker brigade is coming down from Mosul. Senator McCain. From Mosul. Is the situation under control in Ramadi? General Abizaid. The situation in Ramadi is better than it was 2 months ago. Senator McCain. Is the situation under control in Ramadi? General Abizaid. I think the situation in Ramadi is workable. Senator McCain. The troops from Ramadi came from Fallujah, is that not correct? General Abizaid. I cannot say, Senator. Senator McCain. That is my information. What I worry about is we are playing a game of whack-a-mole here. We move troops. It flares up, we move troops there. We all know that Fallujah was allowed to become a base of operations and insurgency, so we had to go into Fallujah and fight one of the great battles in Marine Corps-Army history. Then when I was back there not too long ago, they said, we have big problems in Ramadi. Everybody knows we have big problems in Ramadi. I said: Where are you going to get the troops? We are going to have to move them from Fallujah. Now we are going to have to move troops into Baghdad from someplace else. It is very disturbing. If it is all up to the Iraqi military, General Abizaid, then I wonder why we have to move troops into Baghdad to intervene in what is clearly sectarian violence. General Abizaid. Senator, Iraqi troops are also being moved into Baghdad. The number of Iraqi troops in the Baghdad area are greater than our troops. We are in support with them in the main operational areas, and I believe that under the current circumstances that the Iraqi forces need to benefit from our command and control capabilities and the systems of a unit such as the Stryker brigade that has been moved to the south. Senator McCain. I would anticipate putting American troops into this very volatile situation means that American casualties will probably go up. General Abizaid. I think it is possible that in the period ahead of us in Baghdad that we will take increased casualties, it is possible. Senator McCain. The situation in southern Iraq. I was briefed by British military and others that there is a grave concern about Iranian penetration throughout southern Iraq. Is that a serious issue? General Abizaid. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Kudz force, intelligence agencies, arm, train, and equip what I would call rogue Shiite groups. Yes, it is a concern. Senator McCain. Is Basra in control of the militias? General Abizaid. I think that the militias have greater influence in Basra than they need to have, and that is why Prime Minister Maliki has appointed a military officer to go down there to get the security situation back under control. Senator McCain. Do you have confidence in the Iraqi Minister of Interior? General Abizaid. I do not know the Iraqi Minister of Interior the way I know the Defense Minister. I have no reason not to have confidence in him. Senator McCain. All the reports we have is that day after day, people are running around in police uniforms and army uniforms and they are actually militias and they are killing people. Story after story, they say when you see the people come in uniform it is an emergency, that people are going to be killed. Which brings us obviously to the state of the training, not of the Iraqi military, but of Iraqi police and law enforcement. Can you comment on that situation? General Abizaid. During the period after the national election when no governance formed, the interior ministry in particular did not develop its forces in the way that we had anticipated that they would or should. Military forces, on the other hand, continued to develop well. They have continued to perform well. But there is no doubt that police units, especially local police units, were infiltrated in Basra in particular, but elsewhere as well, by local militias and they put their allegiance to the militias ahead of their allegiance to the state. It is vital that we turn this around. Senator McCain. The cleric al-Sadr continues to be a major obstacle to progress in Iraq. I believe there is still an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Are we going to address that issue? General Abizaid. The issue will be addressed by the Iraqi government. Senator McCain. Not by us? General Abizaid. It will be addressed by the Iraqi government. Senator McCain. All of my colleagues are here, so I want to not take time. I just want to conclude. Secretary Rumsfeld, we passed an amendment on the National Defense Authorization Act, which I am confident will be accepted in conference, and that requires that operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, funding for it be included in the regular budgetary process. We are hearing story after story about mismanagement of funds, corruption, et cetera. We must have sufficient congressional oversight. I hope you are making plans to include the expenses involved in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the normal budgetary process and not as an ``emergency supplemental.'' I think you should be able at this time, after this many years involved in this conflict, be able to predict what those costs might be. I want to say again, we will have a showdown unless, both within this body and with the executive branch, we start going through the normal budgetary process to fund this conflict, which I think all of us agree we will be involved in for a long period of time. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Warner. I would like to have you respond, Mr. Secretary. Secretary Rumsfeld. We are aware of the amendment and needless to say we will comply with the law. From our standpoint, we can do it either way. It has been a matter that has been worked out generally over the years between the White House, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the leadership in Congress. The reality is that what we would have to do, as you suggested, would be to provide the best estimates that we can and projections and then make adjustments for them as time actually passed, and we would be happy to do that. Senator McCain. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Pace. Mr. Chairman. Chairman Warner. Yes, Chairman. General Pace. Can I make one clarification, so that the parents watching this do not believe that somehow their sons and daughters are not properly trained to handle the kind of violence that the sectarian violence is creating? What General Chiarelli said is exactly true, that we do not train to separate sectarian violence, and that is very much a responsibility of the politicians and, as we have talked about already, the Iraqi people need to do that. With regard to Lieutenant Pace, who is on patrol in Baghdad with his platoon, and the kind of violence that he is going to come across, regardless of if it is Sunni, Shiite, or whoever, if it is an armed group our soldiers and marines certainly are well-trained to handle that. So there is a difference between the kind of violence they have to handle and what would prevent that violence, and preventing that violence is very much the role of the political leaders in Iraq to solve, sir. Chairman Warner. That is the purpose of this hearing, to allow you and other witnesses to clarify these bullet statements that come before us and the American public. Thank you, Chairman Pace. Senator Reed. Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. General Abizaid, in your opinion is the Mahdi Army a terrorist organization with implicit at least support from the Iranian government? General Abizaid. In my opinion there are groups within the Mahdi Army that are under the pay of the Iranian government that are terrorist organizations. I am not sure I can say that is necessarily true about the entire organization. Senator Reed. As Senator McCain pointed out, there is an outstanding warrant for Muqtada al Sadr, who is the leader of the Mahdi Army. But his followers are prominent members of the Iraqi government; is that correct? General Abizaid. That is correct. Senator Reed. So when you say the Iraqi government will dispose of Sadr and the Mahdi Army, he in fact is part of that government. General Abizaid. I believe that the prime minister and his government will take the steps necessary to get the sectarian violence under control and do what has to be done against the death squads. Senator Reed. Do you have any sort of sense of the timing of this, particularly with respect to the Mahdi Army and to Sadr? General Abizaid. Again, I would not characterize the target as being either Sadr or the Mahdi Army. I would say there are elements within the Jesh-al-Mahdi that will be targeted because they are participating in death squad activities. Senator Reed. With the encouragement, the permission, the tolerance of Sadr? General Abizaid. I could not say whether there is a permission or tolerance or anything of Sadr. I can say that the prime minister knows and has been very forceful about saying that militias must be brought under control. He has a wide range of points that go all the way from direct military confrontation to agreement with various militias. Senator Reed. But we will not be involved in that process? It will be exclusively up to the prime minister and his security forces? General Abizaid. I would not say it would be exclusively the work of Iraqis. It is very clear that our forces in conjunction with the Iraqis will help target known death squad organizations. Senator Reed. Mr. Secretary, the Chief of Staff of the Army testified before the House Armed Services Committee on June 27 that $4.9 billion in funding that the Army requested for reset, which is the repair and replacement of equipment, was denied before the request was submitted to Congress. Did you deny this request or did the OMB deny the request? Secretary Rumsfeld. Senator, the normal process is that the Department is given a budget by the OMB, and we take that budget and work within the Department to try to fashion a budget that is balanced and makes sense. Then in the event there is from time to time a need to go back to the OMB or the President and request additional funds, we have done that. I do not know precisely what $4.9 billion, I think you said. Senator Reed. Mr. Secretary, did you go back to the President and ask for more funds because of the critical needs of the Army and the Marine Corps for reset? Secretary Rumsfeld. We have certainly gone to the President and the OMB and explained the need for reset and negotiated it extensively with the OMB. Regrettably, there have been cuts made by Congress every year in the defense budget. There have been not only reductions in our budget, there have been things that have been added in that we did not request that required us to take money from other things. Third, there have been things required of us that we were prevented from making savings. The net effect of it, if you look just today in the authorization and appropriation bills between the House and the Senate, it runs somewhere between $10, $15, or $20 billion, depending on how you calculate it. Senator Reed. So the White House did turn down your request for additional money for reset, yes or no? Secretary Rumsfeld. That would not be correct. Senator Reed. So you did not ask? Secretary Rumsfeld. I cannot say that, because we went through an extensive discussion and negotiation and we ended up with the budget we ended up with, which was then reduced by Congress. Senator Reed. Last Tuesday evening the Senate passed an appropriation for $13 billion of additional funding for reset. Is that money appropriate or is it in some way a waste of resources? Secretary Rumsfeld. It is clearly needed. Senator Reed. Why did you not ask the White House before they sent the request to Congress for that clearly needed money? Secretary Rumsfeld. We did talk to the White House about it and that is where the number came from, was from the DOD. Senator Reed. Mr. Secretary, what you are saying, I think, is either you asked for the money and they said no or you accepted a limit despite the needs that you recognized for reset. It is one or the other? Secretary Rumsfeld. You have lost me. At first you were talking about---- Senator Reed. I think you have lost everyone with this dialogue. Secretary Rumsfeld. First you were talking about $4.9 billion, I thought. Now you are talking about the $13 billion, $13.1 billion I think, and we have requested that of OMB and they have requested it of Congress and Congress has put it in the bill, as I understand it has. Senator Reed. When did you request the $13 billion, Mr. Secretary? Secretary Rumsfeld. Within the last period of months, weeks. Senator Reed. Weeks? Secretary Rumsfeld. Yes, weeks. Senator Reed. Days. Why did you not request the $13 billion when the budget was being prepared to be sent to Congress? Secretary Rumsfeld. When the budget was being prepared to be sent to Congress, it would have been January of last year for the budget that still has not been passed by Congress this year. For the supplemental it would have been late last year, not the beginning of last year but late last year, when those budgets are prepared. We gain knowledge every month that goes by, and it is very clear the Army has a reset problem. It is also clear that the $13 billion is needed. Senator Reed. Mr. Secretary, it is very clear that two- thirds of the Army operating force, Active-Duty and Reserve, is now reporting as unready. There is not a single nondeployed Army brigade combat team in the United States that is ready to deploy. The bottom line is that we have no ready strategic Reserve, and this is a stunning indictment of your leadership. Secretary Rumsfeld. I think it is an inaccurate statement. Senator Reed. How so? Have you seen the readiness reports, Mr. Secretary? Secretary Rumsfeld. I have. Senator Reed. It is inaccurate to say that the readiness reports of the Army do not indicate severe equipment shortages, leaving many brigades of the United States as nondeployable? Secretary Rumsfeld. If you will allow me a few minutes to respond, it is complicated, but I would be happy to do so. I stand with what I say. I think the characterization that you made is not accurate. It is complicated. If one sees a chart that shows a deterioration like this over a 5-, 6-, 7-, 10-year period, one has to assume that the readiness of the military, in this case the Army, has deteriorated. Now, the fact of the matter is if you begin with a standard, a requirement, that is X and then you show the beginning of the chart, and then at the end you have changed your requirement because you have decided you need different things, you have learned from the experiences of the last period of years and you have increased your requirements to 5X, and then you compare yourself against 5X, so if you have improved 300 percent--you were at 100 percent to begin, at 1X, and now you need 5X, you have decided your requirement is different, and you have improved 300 percent to get there, you are still short of that requirement. That is what shows the deterioration. The fact of the matter is the equipment that the military has today is vastly better today than it was 5 years ago. The readiness of our capabilities are--if you measure them against full spectrum, you can say they are not ready to do everything that anyone conceivably might need to do. On the other hand, if you ask the readiness of the forces with respect to what they are being asked to do, ask General Abizaid, are the forces over there capable of doing what they are doing, equipped and trained to do what they are doing, he will tell you yes. If you ask General Schoomaker, are the Armed Forces of the United States considerably better today, more capable, better equipped than they were 5 years ago, he will say yes. If you ask General Pace the question, is the United States today capable of doing, fulfilling the requirements that the country has put on them, the answer is yes. Senator Reed. Let me take that opportunity. General Pace, have you seen the last readiness---- Chairman Warner. Senator, wait a minute. Senator Reed. Excuse me. Chairman Warner. You are way over your time. Just a minute. We need to allow the witness to fully respond to your question. I think your question has been stated. We will have another round and you can pursue this at that time. But I have to accommodate other members. You are quite a bit over your time. Has the witness had the opportunity to fully reply to the question before him? Secretary Rumsfeld. I have. I think it would be useful just for the context if the Senator's last question could be responded to. Senator Reed. Mr. Chairman, would you allow me to ask my questions, rather than have the Secretary ask my questions for me? Chairman Warner. Well, now, Senator---- Senator Reed. If I have given up my time, then my time is gone. Chairman Warner. Just a minute. We allowed you to ask your question very fully. It was stated. It is in the record, I think with clarity, and the Secretary was responding. We will have a second round, at which time you can further pursue this important subject. I recognize the importance of the subject. Now, the Secretary has asked for General Pace to give his perspective in response to the Senator's question. General Pace. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Readiness is reflected in personnel, in training, and in equipment. Any time a unit comes back from any deployment, when I was battalion commander, the unit has people change out and therefore the personnel numbers go down. The training as a result of the unit coming back starts out anew into the new cycle. Equipment is taken from what has been used and put into depot maintenance. That is in normal peacetime. In wartime, we are using equipment at much greater rates. So where you have a notional unit that has 100 trucks and they deploy and they come back, and the trucks normally would be driven 1,000 miles in a year and they are driven 10,000 miles in combat, you have a larger number of those vehicles that end up being put into the depot maintenance, which for the unit that is home then reduces their readiness based on availability of equipment. The units that are forward have had not only the equipment that they went over with, but have been augmented thanks to Congress providing the funding. For example, our up-armored Humvees. The requirement globally when we started in September 2001 was about 2,000. That number now is up at 12,000. We have bought up to 12,000 and we have used them in combat, and now a number of those 12,000 are currently in depot maintenance waiting. So we are way over the 2,000 we started with. But now, because of maintenance, usage, and combat losses, we are below the 12,000 that folks are asking for today. So it is very difficult when you turn the kaleidoscope to see all the pieces and it does not allow itself to have a straight, easy answer. Fundamentally, the United States Army is much more capable today. Fundamentally, the Army that is fighting our war for us today deployed is in tremendous shape, personnel, training, and equipment-wise. But it is absolutely a fact that, for various budgetary reasons, some of which are a result of actions taken by Congress, that we do not have enough funding currently to provide for the repair of all of the equipment that currently sits at our depots waiting to be repaired. I believe that is where the dialogue is about how much money is needed. That $13.1 billion as I understand it, if approved by Congress, will in fact allow the Marine Corps and the Army to take the equipment that is currently stacked up at their depots, hire the workforce, and begin the process. But what has happened, when we have not had budgets and we have had continuing resolutions, some of the workforce has had to be let go. We cannot have the depots not know whether or not they are going to be able to have the funding long-term to hire people. We cannot go out and hire Mechanic Pace for 6 months and then let him go and expect to hire him back again. I would ask as we look at this, that we look at some kind of no-year funding that is focused on the backlog of equipment repair, that will allow the depots to consciously go out and hire people who can stay in the workforce long enough to get this work done. Thank you. Chairman Warner. The Senator from Rhode Island raises a very important question and we will further explore it in the course of this hearing. Mr. Secretary, I am going to seek to get documentation that I looked at where you did engage with OMB about the need for these funds. So I think that documentation will be put in this record. I am advised by the cloakroom that we have two back-to-back votes. It is my intention to go over quickly and vote in the first vote and, Senator McCain, I would ask that you chair because I am going to be absent for that vote. We will keep the hearing going, colleagues, as members come and go on these votes. Senator Inhofe. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do want to thank you for giving General Pace the opportunity to respond to that question. I think that was an excellent response. Let me just make a couple of observations if I might. I find it really interesting. I think most of the members of this committee have been to Iraq varying numbers of times. There are some of them who have not been at all. When you get the reaction, the response and the opinions that are formulated by those who have not been there, it is totally different than those who have really been there and understand first-hand what is going on. There is no better example of that than an article that was in the paper in USA Today just this morning, that said that only--without quoting a source, at least I did not see a source--of the 18 provinces, only one was able to be secured just with the Iraqis. On the other hand, Dr. Rubaire, who is a person I have known for quite some time, at the National Security Agency (NSA), said that right now 4 out of 18 are under the protection and security of Iraqi security forces, and there are 9 more that will be in a very short period of time, which is 13 out of 18. When you hear people who have not been there and depend on press reports, there is no way that they can get the resolve that our troops have. There is no way--I will share with you, General Pace, since this is up in the Marines' area, in Fallujah, an experience up there with this Dr. Madhi, that you have met many times I am sure. General Madhi was actually the brigade commander for Saddam Hussein. He hated Americans until he started embedded training with the marines, and he learned to love them so much that he said that when they rotated them out that they cried. He then renamed the Iraqi security forces at Fallujah the ``Fallujah Marines.'' Things like that that are going on, you can only get by being there and experiencing it. Now, I came back from my 11th trip to the CENTCOM AOR and I timed that trip so that it was right after Zarqawi saw his demise and after the new cabinet appointments were put into place. You hear a lot about Maliki and so forth and perhaps even Minister Jaseem, but when you sit down and spend quality time with them you get a different impression than you do by looking at the media here. Certainly Dr. Rubaie is the same way. Minister Jaseem at that time, General Pace, said, or maybe General Abizaid could respond to this, he said at that time that, of the 36 brigades, 17--we are talking about the Iraqi brigades now--17 were at level 2, or in other words were capable of autonomous operations, and of the 112 battalions 62 were at level 2. Now, this was 2 months ago. Do you agree with his assessment at that time of those who are trained and equipped, Iraqi security forces, and has that changed in the last 2 months? General Abizaid. Senator Inhofe, I think the best way to characterize where the Iraqis are doing well has to do with their units that are in the lead, in the lead in the security structure in whatever area that has been assigned to them. In October 2004--of 2005, 1 division, 4 brigades, and 23 battalions of the Iraqi armed forces were in the lead in their sectors. Today it is 4 divisions, 21 brigades, and 77 battalions. That is a pretty impressive gain. I think it is really important for people to understand that, while there are a lot of very important warning signals that cannot be lost to us about where sectarian violence is heading in Baghdad, the most important point that we have to keep in mind is that the army is holding together and that the government is committed to bringing the sectarian violence under control. So the question is, am I optimistic whether or not Iraqi forces with our support, with the backing of the Iraqi government, can prevent the slide to civil war? My answer is yes, I am optimistic that that slide can be prevented. Senator Inhofe. That is consistent with what we get from the other side. I like these hearings here where we get it from you, but also to go over there and see what they have to say about it. I have to say this, that I was incredibly impressed. We all are familiar with Maliki, but Minister Jaseem and this Dr. Rubaie, someone I had known some time before, they are very optimistic about their level of professionalism. When you talk to the troops, getting back up to Fallujah--I was up there during the elections, knowing that they were actually risking their lives. They were just rejoicing at that time. Asking them the question, do you see the time in the future where you are going to be able to take over your own security, they just very enthusiastically say it is. General Abizaid. Senator Inhofe, if I may, I just want to say, the Iraqi soldiers are fighting, they are taking casualties. They are fighting for their nation. They are trying to get the sectarian violence and the insurgency under control. They deserve an enormous amount of our respect and support. So I think sometimes we seem to think that we are the only forces there. We are not. There are 220,000 plus Iraqis that are out there fighting and doing a pretty good job. Yes, there are some problems within their organizations, but they are maturing and they are doing better, and they will continue to do better. Senator Inhofe. They are committed. I happened to be in Saddam's home town when the training area was bombed by the terrorists. About 40 of them, 41 I think it was, were either killed or very seriously injured. Those families, those 40 families, resupplied a member of their family to replace the one that was killed. This is the type of thing, the stories that you do not hear. I know my time has expired, but for the record, Senator McCain, I would like to ask them to give us some information. According to Chiarelli and several others, including the Iraqis, probably one of the most serious problems, even though it does not have a lot of sex appeal to it, is the logistics, both civilian and military, and the problem of the organizational structure to distribute simple equipment and supplies is not there. I would like to get your opinions as to what we are trying to do to correct the problem of logistical problems. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information referred to follows:] Over the past year, Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I), in conjunction with Iraqi counterparts, developed two detailed and concise action plans to improve logistics and Iraqi self- sustainment. The first action plan for the Ministry of Defense was finalized and approved 4 October 2006. The second action for the Ministry of Interior was approved 6 November 2006. These plans outline synchronized and deliberate processes for the generation of Iraqi logistics capabilities and sequential procedures for transferring those capabilities to Iraqi oversight, funding, management, and control. MNSTC-I is approaching the development of Iraqi logistics sustainment along three parallel avenues. First, MNSTC-I is assisting the Iraqi ministries in the development of their own capabilities to sustain themselves and transferring to them those responsibilities as we mentor them through difficulties. This course of action is best exemplified by the Iraqi ministries' assumption of life support and feeding responsibilities. Second, MNSTC-I is coaching the ministries through the more complex tasks that they are capable of self-performing using Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case funded contracts. These contracts allow the Iraqis to oversee, train, and control commodity and functional areas while we provide a safety net of experienced, established, and honest workforces to maintain sustainment while increasing their capabilities. This course is best experienced by the Iraqi assumption of ammunition and maintenance responsibilities. Third, MNSTC-I is teaching higher order complex and skilled logistics functions such as forecasting, budgeting, and contracting. This is best exemplified by our lead in the joint partnership of developing the military depot and police maintenance capabilities for complex repair and the Iraqi support command contracting and commodity management skills required to sustain a national logistics system. Recognizing the importance of logistics, the MNSTC-I commander has identified 2007 as the year of logistics and leaders. MNSTC-I is working diligently to train logisticians for every level of the Iraqi Military and Civil Security Forces. The military training mission is training individuals at every level of the logistics system from the service company to the depot level. The Civil Security Forces are utilizing the training opportunities offered by the police ``re- bluing'' initiative and local civilian logistics capabilities to expand the effectiveness of their sustainment processes. Both the military and police force training teams, located at every level of the Iraqi chain of command from the ministry to the small unit level, have been focused or assisting the Iraqis in self-sustainment and process improvement. The MNSTC-I commander has tasked every leader in MNSTC-I to transition from leading logistics from the front, to leading side-by-side with our Iraqi partners, and ultimately to assisting from behind as the Iraqis assume greater responsibility in the planning, execution, and improvement of their logistics system. Using self-performance, increased Iraqi participation, and FMS reinforcement for complex task development, MNSTC-I has an aggressive and achievable plan to transition logistics to Iraqi oversight and management by the end of 2007. Senator McCain [presiding]. Senator Ben Nelson. Senator Ben Nelson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, thank you, gentlemen, for being here. Today I think your testimony in response to questions has been very helpful. In connection with the number of Iraqi troops who are combat capable, out of the 250,000-plus security forces that are there, is there any estimate of the number who would be combat capable? General Abizaid. Senator, for the record, the number of trained Iraqi police, border security, and Iraqi military forces, the number is closer to 275,000. The combat capability within the army, I think again the best measure are those units that are in the lead, which are 4 brigades--4 divisions, 21 brigades, and 77 battalions. But there is a very detailed list of what unit is at what level, that we can certainly provide to you. Senator Ben Nelson. That would be very helpful. [The information referred to follows:] [Deleted.] General Abizaid. They are much improved and they continue to improve every month. Senator Ben Nelson. Which is part of the emphasis on standing their military up so that we can stand ours down. The faster and the more capable they are, hopefully then there should be some sort of connection with the reduction of our Armed Forces as a result of that. In terms of the police, let us say the municipal police, do we know what percentage or what number of the total number you would look at as being, not combat or capably trained, but honest and as part of the overall government, as opposed to a militia? General Abizaid. It is a difficult question to answer. There are some places where the local police are exceptionally efficient and very honest, very capable. There are other areas where we know that they have been infiltrated by various militias, such as in Basra, where the government and the British forces that are down there are doing their best to stand down those units, retrain them, and bring them on line in a credible and capable manner. As far as the national police forces are concerned, in Baghdad it is clear that there are a number of battalions-- again, without my notes in front of me I would take it for the record, but there are battalions that need to be stood down and retrained, and Generals Casey and Dempsey are working to do that now. [The information referred to follows:] [Deleted.] Senator Ben Nelson. Do we know whether approximately 50 percent or 30 percent? General Abizaid. I would say it is probably 30 percent. Senator Ben Nelson. 30 percent. General Abizaid. That is national police, which is separate and distinct from---- Senator Ben Nelson. Municipal and-or the military. I think the debate about whether we have a date for withdrawal or there is an open-ended commitment--hopefully the debate will continue. But I wonder about an approach that is different than setting a date for withdrawal and to close any question about whether it is an open-ended commitment, would be better approached on setting conditions for staying with the prime minister, with the Iraqi government. In other words, there is a lot of slippage on how we have standing up to stand down in terms of their military versus our military because things change on the ground. But do we have some idea of what our conditions for staying are? Is there a tipping point in terms of their ability or inability to get to a certain level so that they can deal with sectarian violence on their own or the Sunni insurgency, to govern themselves, but also to secure themselves? I guess I would feel more comfortable if we could establish some sort of metrics to know what it takes in terms of percentage, numbers, and what it will take in terms of time so that we can say that they are capable of not only governing themselves with the elected government, but also in terms of securing themselves so they can govern themselves. I do not know who would like to take that question, but I throw it out to all three of you. General Abizaid. Senator, the government has been in existence now for 3 months. They have a lot of work to do to cement their capability to govern. It is a very difficult thing to bring in a new government under these conditions of sectarian violence and insurgency. I think it is very important for people to understand, while there may be a military metric to units in the Iraqi army that are equipped and trained and them taking over certain battle space, there is also a very important political aspect to this reduction of sectarian violence, which is the various communities getting together and agreeing upon ways to reduce the sectarian violence themselves. It is important that there be a national reconciliation effort and it is important that there be agreed-upon measures to move forward with various militias that are operating outside of government control. I think a combination of those things will lead to less violence over time, establish the role of the national government in Iraq, and allow us to bring our level of forces down as appropriate. Secretary Rumsfeld. Senator Nelson, I would just add that the U.S. Ambassador and General Casey have established a committee or a commission with the new Iraqi government and the national security officials in that government to address the very issues that you are raising as to what are the things that need to be done, because, as General Abizaid correctly points out, they reach well beyond military capabilities. Senator Ben Nelson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your answers. Senator McCain. Senator Thune. Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General, General, Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here and for your responses to the questions. I would like to ask General Abizaid a question. I talked to a soldier last week who has had two deployments to Iraq and raised the question about whether or not the objectives and the goals that we have in Iraq are aligned with the goals that the Iraqi people have, and that they are not. One of the reasons--it seems to me at least if we are going to get control of the sectarian situation there the Iraqi people have to buy into what is happening in Iraq. His suggestion was that they have not. I know that when we have traveled to Iraq--and I was there a couple of months back with Senator McCain's delegation--we hear from, obviously, the commanders and we talk with some of our troops. In most cases we do not have a lot of interaction with the Iraqi people. But I am just wondering if you could comment about the overall--the interaction that we have with the Iraqi people, our troops on the ground over there, the temperature in terms of their willingness to be a part of a national unity government, a democratic Iraq, and that sort of thing, relative to what we are trying to accomplish there. This was one soldier who says he visits with these folks all the time and thinks that their interests and their objectives and goals are not aligned with what ours are over there. General Abizaid. There are certainly people in Iraq that do not want Iraq to come together as an independent state. There are terrorist groups that have views that they want Iraq to descend into a state of anarchy and chaos so they can establish safe havens for terrorism in the region. But I think that as I go around and I talk to Iraqi military officers, Iraqi government officials, and people throughout the country--and I think General Casey certainly would echo this--the majority of the people want Iraq to come together as a free and independent nation that is capable of being a meaningful member of the community of nations in that part of the world, that is not dominated by either Iranians or dominated by Sunni extremist groups. I believe that they know they have to fight in order to achieve that. Secretary Rumsfeld. I think it ought not to be surprising, Senator, that an American soldier would visit with Iraqis and see that they do have a different perspective. They live in a different part of the world, they have a different history, and it is fully understandable. On the other hand, 12 million of them went out and voted, and they went out and fashioned a constitution and then ratified it. It is there for the world to see. They have been voting in increasing numbers. So while you are right and General Abizaid is certainly right that there are Baathists who want to take back the country, there are Shiite who would like to dominate it to the detriment of the Sunnis, the fact of the matter is that 12 million Iraqis went out and voted for that constitution, and that is not nothing. It is something important. Senator Thune. I appreciate General Abizaid's comment, which I have heard you make previously as well, that the forces that want to hold the country together and see it succeed outnumber and are greater than those that want to see it fail. But I just wanted to get your assessment of the on-the-ground, average Iraqi on the street type of view of what is happening there, because it seems to me at least that that is a key component in starting to turn over information on some of the bad guys who are committing the violence there and really making this thing work. One other question has to do again with the borders and how are we doing with respect to Iran and Syria? Foreign arms serve as the lifeblood of the insurgent groups. Does the Iraqi government see that as a threat to their sovereignty and are they stepping up and doing some of the work to protect the borders and make sure that a lot of the arms that are coming in are cut off? What is your assessment of that? I have asked a lot of questions of your colleagues who have been in front of this committee about IEDs, for example, and where are they getting the materials to make these IEDs. It seems at least a lot of that is coming from some of these other countries. I know it is impossible, with the length of the borders and everything else, to completely shut it off, but are there efforts being made to regulate and control the materials that are coming in that are being used to inflict casualties on our troops? General Abizaid. Yes, Senator, there is a lot of effort building a border force. The border force is effective in some areas, less effective in others. The Iraqi armed forces also back up the border forces. The Syrian border remains the primary conduit for foreign fighters. I think those numbers remain less than 100 or so that are transitting back and forth. The vast majority of the munitions that are used inside Iraq come from inside Iraq. There are certainly smuggling routes that Iranian Revolutionary Guard Kudz Force people are using to bring in IEDs into the south and into some of the northern portions of Iraq, that have been used, and it is clear that that has taken place. Senator Thune. Were those weapons caches that were discovered this last week, has it been determined whether those were leftovers from the previous regime or are those that have come in, that have flooded in from other countries? General Abizaid. Sir, I would have to see the specific report. There are weapons caches found every day. Senator Thune. All right. General Pace. Sir, to help with that number, we have had 420,000 tons of ammunition captured and destroyed in some over 14,000 locations in theater. So it is a huge cache location, and we find them every day. Senator Thune. Thank you. I thank you for your outstanding service to our country. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Senator McCain. Senator Clinton. Senator Clinton. Thank you very much, Senator McCain. Mr. Secretary, we are glad you are here. In your opening statement you referenced the common sense of Americans. I think it is fair to say that that collective common sense overwhelmingly does not either understand or approve of the way you and the administration are handling Iraq and Afghanistan. Under your leadership there have been numerous errors in judgment that have led us to where we are in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have a full-fledged insurgency and full-blown sectarian conflict in Iraq. Now, whether you label it a civil war or not, it certainly has created a situation of extreme violence and the continuing loss of life among our troops and of the Iraqis. You did not go into Iraq with enough troops to establish law and order. You disbanded the entire Iraqi army. Now we are trying to recreate it. You did not do enough planning for what is called phase 4 and rejected all the planning that had been done previously to maintain stability after the regime was overthrown. You underestimated the nature and strength of the insurgency, the sectarian violence, and the spread of Iranian influence. Last year Congress passed the United States Policy in Iraq Act, which I strongly supported. This law declares 2006 to be a year of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. However, we appear to be moving in the opposite direction, with the number of U.S. troops in Iraq scheduled to increase, not decrease. That is the only way I think you can fairly consider the decision with respect to 172nd Stryker brigade. So, Mr. Chairman, as we return to our States for the August recess, our constituents have a lot of questions and concer"
