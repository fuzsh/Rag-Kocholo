        "meta_description": "Paul Wilson discusses his English translation of former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel's book \"To the Castle and Back\" in an event sponsored by the Library's John W. Kluge Center and the Embassy of the Czech Republic. A considerable amount of Havel's memoir was written at the Library of Congress, while the former Czech president held the Chair of Modern Culture in the Kluge Center.  Havel, a writer, dissident and statesman, played an important role in the profound changes that occurred in Central Europe during the final decades of the 20th century. He became a powerful intellectual and political force for the re-establishment of democratic principles and institutions. Known in his native Prague for his theatrical productions and imprisoned for his anticommunist views, Havel emerged on the international stage in 1989 as the elected president of Czechoslovakia and, in 1993, as president of the newly-formed Czech Republic.  In the book, Havel writes about his transition from playwright to politician and the challenges of governing a young democracy. He also shares his thoughts on the future of the European Union, the reach of the American superpower and the role of national identity in today's world. He explains why he has come to believe the war in Iraq is a fiasco, and he discusses the reverberations from his initial support of the invasion.",
