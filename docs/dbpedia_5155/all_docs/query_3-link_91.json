        "text": "Cantwell family\n\nThe ancestor of the Cantwell family was a Norman knight, the son of Herluin de Conterville, who accomponied William the Conqueror to England and fought along his side in Battle of Hastings in 1066. He was rewarded with the Earldom of Kent, and his descendents changed the name to Kent de Ville, Kentwell, and eventually Cantwell.\n\nWhen Strongbow invaded Ireland in 1170, one of his Knights was Hugh Cantwell. Next year Strongbow was crowned King Richard of Leinster, and Hugh received a large grant of lands in the neighborhood of Thurles, the Devilsbit and Templemore. His descendents became widespread in Ireland during the following centuries. The Cantwells early possessions included a large property in the county of Kilkenny, on which stood the castles of Cantwell's Court and of Stroan and Cloghscreg in the immediate neighborhood of Kilfane. In Kilfane Church there is a stone effigy of a Cantwell, believed to be that of Sir Thomas (1260-1320).\n\nAmongst the Cantwells mentioned in early documents appear the names of John, Archbishop of Cashel (1450-1484) - Oliver, Bishop of Ossory (1487-1527) who built the \"great bridge\" at Kilkenny - Thomas, Dean of St. Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny, he surrendered the convent to the crown in 1539. In addition there are numerous references to Cantwell landowners, witnesses, soldiers and rogues. ....... continue"
