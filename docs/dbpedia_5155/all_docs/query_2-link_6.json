        "text": "LEIGH SALES, PRESENTER: Going to work might feel like a daily battle, but for some leaders, they're literally putting their lives and those of their staff on the line. Major General John Cantwell commanded Australian forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and he rose to prominence when he released a book in 2013 about his struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder. Now, he's written a new book called Leadership in Action to inspire leaders to apply the lessons he learned on the frontline of battle to civilian workplaces. I sat down with John Cantwell in Sydney.\n\nJohn Cantwell, good to see you.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL, FORMER ARMY COMMANDER: It's great to see you, Leigh.\n\nLEIGH SALES: You write in your book about one of the most challenging leadership experiences that you faced, which was in the 1991 Gulf War, when you were commanding a single armoured personnel carrier with two young British soldiers in their early-20s. Just paint that picture and set the scene for us.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: Yeah, that was a formative experience. I was about halfway through my career. I was early-30s. I ranked major, middle ranking, on exchange with the Brits and ended up in the first Gulf war. And we were in a really bad situation. We'd been in combat nonstop for a couple of days and we were taking a pounding, stuck inside this little armoured box, a metal container. And, you know, while all hell was breaking loose outside. But we needed to get radio communications. And at a brief time when the artillery had moved away, I said to the guys, \"Boys, we've gotta get the big antenna up,\" which was a thing we assembled. That was stored up on the roof. It meant we had to get outside. I said, \"We've gotta get outside and put this bigger antenna up.\" And they essentially said \"No\" in a muted way.\n\nLEIGH SALES: And how could you tell they were saying \"No\" when ... ? You say it was a muted way.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: Um, well, um, one of the young guys basically said, you know, \"Get stuffed. That's stupid. We'll get killed.\" And the other guy just refused to respond. But I understood their fear, 'cause I was damn scared as well. It's not like in the movies where, you know, Clint Eastwood says, \"Follow me, men,\" and they all go. It's not like that. You've got to overcome your own fear and you have to lead. And I remember having that flashing word before my eyes: lead, lead. Come on, these guys need leadership now. And so I gave 'em a little pep talk which was pretty crappy, but, you know, it got the message across. I explained why it was important, what was expected of them, how proud I was of them for what they had done and, \"Now I need you to do something else, I need you to follow me. And I'm gonna get out that door at the back of the armoured vehicle and gonna go outside and you damn well better be behind me.\" And when I went outside and flopped down on the ground, I spent a very uncomfortable 30 seconds or so alone in in the darkness with artillery booming away wondering was I going be on my own. They joined me and we got on with the job.\n\nLEIGH SALES: I presume that you had spent a period of time with those men demonstrating qualities and building your leadership credentials such that in that moment they were able to trust in you.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: I think so.\n\nLEIGH SALES: What sort of things had you done over time to develop that sort of a relationship?\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: Well, I try to be a real human being. You know, I'm the officer, they were the soldiers. But you can communicate and relate to people in ways that show you have some humanity. You're not just some mandarin who issues orders.\n\nLEIGH SALES: How do you strike the balance between, as a leader, showing your humanity, yet retaining authority? 'Because at the end of the day, when you're the leader, you're not one of the gang; you're the boss.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: You can't allow yourself to be mates with everybody. In fact, that's a recipe for a failed leadership. There is a time where you have to step back and sometimes you have to have a bit of mongrel in you. You've got to make hard decisions. You've got to sometimes deal with people who have disappointed you, failed the team, let themselves and others down. You've got to sometimes be the disciplinarian. But as a general approach, if you're able to open up a little bit, communicate, show you actually care about the people you're trying to lead, ask about their family. If they're not well, give them the afternoon off and don't worry about docking their pay, for God's sake. You know, the loyalty you'll get back from a few hours' lost work is more than compensated.\n\nLEIGH SALES: Are fear and intimidation ever useful motivators or tools in a leader's kit?\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: If you try to bully people into doing something, if you make them scared of you, if you impose consequences that are punishing, well you might get compliance, but you won't get loyalty. If you show people that you care about them, if you genuinely care about them as people, not just as some commodity. The person working for you isn't like, you know, ink for the printer or office furniture; they're a real human being. And they come to work with worries about kids and their mortgage and the bill they just got in the mail and work is just one of the things in their lives. Well you've got to deal with that whole complex person. And if you recognise that and give them things that would make them admire what you're trying to do or attach loyalty to you and the company by showing them that you believe in them, by giving them opportunities to excel, by training them better, by forgiving them their mistakes, helping them learn to overcome their fears and concerns, help them learn to be leaders themselves, you get loyalty back and it's gold. It's gold! Because people who are loyal will do things that they would otherwise not do. They will choose to do what you want; you don't have to tell them to do it. It's a really, really powerful idea.\n\nLEIGH SALES: Just a couple of questions about military issues that were things that you were involved with during your career. You mentioned Afghanistan earlier. You're a former commander of forces in Afghanistan. How do you rate the stability and security of that country now?\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: It's not promising, is it? We've recently seen a downturn in the security situation in Uruzgan Province, where we were responsible. Chief of Police has been murdered. Things are going backwards. And I feared this would be the case. It doesn't diminish the value of the sacrifice that was made, but I just wonder whether 41 Australian lives was a fair price to pay for what was achieved and when you're given the prospects of long-term happiness in Afghanistan are pretty low, it is a point of some sadness for me.\n\nLEIGH SALES: How about the strategy that we're pursuing currently in Iraq against Islamic State. Do you think that that's the right strategy?\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: I think the strategy is about as far as we would want to go. I would be horrified to see Australian ground troops going back into a combat role in Iraq. We just don't need to go there. Iraq was never gonna be a successful experiment. Air campaign, sure. Relatively low risk. It can be effective in toppling or taking parts out of their command and control, but it's not gonna win the game. The only ones who are gonna win that game are the Iraqis and we need to stay right out of it.\n\nLEIGH SALES: Well thank you very much for your time today.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: It's been wonderful. Thanks, Leigh."
