        "text": "Retired Major General John Cantwell has been scathing of former defence ministers and questioned whether the Afghanistan mission was worth the 38 lives lost.\n\nBut there wasn't much of that on Wednesday when the former army chief Peter Leahy launched the major general's new book, Exit Wounds, in the timber-panelled dining room of Canberra's Royal Military College.\n\nMost of the talk was about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - the debilitating mental condition Major General Cantwell suffered for 20 years and which cut short his 38-year military career when he was in the running to be the next army chief.\n\nHe ended up in a psychiatric ward.\n\n\"I have no mortgage on pain or hurt and sadness associated with losing friends and soldiers and colleagues,\" Major General Cantwell said.\n\n\"I have got no mortgage on the effects of PTSD. It's a prevalent and deeply troubling complaint. It is wounding by stealth. You can't see where the injury goes in, but you can certainly feel its effects.\"\n\nMajor General Cantwell's book tells the story of how he joined the army as a private in 1974, rose through the ranks and served in the 1991 Gulf war and again in Iraq following the 2003 invasion.\n\nIn 2010, he commanded all Australian troops in the Middle East. Ten Australian soldiers died in Afghanistan on his watch, and he personally farewelled each of them in the morgue at the Australian base in the United Arab Emirates on route back home.\n\nHe still questions the human cost of the Afghanistan mission.\n\n\"There is no doubt the courage and endurance and remarkable skills of our soldiers and sailors and airmen have produced good results in our little part of Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\n\"What I do say, though, is the human cost has been terrible. When one compares the loss of a human life, the life of so many, 38 Australians, and compare that against what we have achieved, it is a very very high price to pay.\n\nDefence force chief General David Hurley said defence had done a lot of work to address PTSD.\n\nBut for some the stigma remains, with soldiers reluctant to come forward because of fears their careers will suffer.\n\n\"What I really felt we needed, and John provided an answer there, was for someone of seniority and significant experience to come forward and say, `Hey, it's okay to be open about this,'\" General Hurley told reporters.\n\n\"The support is there. You need to reach out. Sometimes we can't get in unless you have reached out.\"\n\n(Exit Wounds: One Australian's War on Terror by Major General John Cantwell with Greg Bearup, Melbourne University Press).\n\nÂ© AAP 2024"
