        "text": "Used with permission from the Port Carbon Citizen’s Committee\n\nAs published in “A Lifetime of Memories” publication\n\nPort Carbon Sesquicentennial\n\nFrom the files of Mr. Burt Bensinger\n\nKeyed by Sandy Palokas\n\nEdited and expanded by Mark T. Major\n\nThe founding of what is now Port Carbon is most often credited to Abraham Pott, the son of John Pott for whom the City of Pottsville is named. Early historians note though, that William Morris and Ludwig Stitzel were two of the earliest settlers of the community before Pott acquired a large section of the area from his father.\n\nMore important than the argument of who first founded Port Carbon, is the story behind why this site evolved as a community. The early settlers of the town recognized the value of two primary aspects of the town’s location. Inspired by the fact that it was situated near rich anthracite coal deposits and that a navigable stream was formed at this site, the founders easily applied an appropriate name to this pre-boom town community. As a shipping point for anthracite coal, which in chemical composition is almost pure carbon, Port Carbon was a logical name. Other histories note that Middleport and Carbontown were two early names for the town, yet it was Port Carbon that has stood for more than 170 years.\n\nThe early history of Port Carbon is veiled in obscurity, but a more definitive account of the first 50 years of the settlement is written by Barbara Bensinger Welch, a Port Carbon native. Tradition declared that the greater part of the site of the town was a vast swamp, fringed with a heavy growth of timber before 1800. This seems to be borne out by the fact that during the 1890s – 1910s, while excavating certain streets for laying water and other pipes, heavy logs, the remains of one-time corduroy roads, were encountered. These timbers were discovered in a fair state of preservation. Evidence of such roads were found on Coal, Jackson, Pike, Market and Pottsville streets, the roads at that time being much lower than at present. With the Schuylkill River and Mill Creek flowing through the borough and with innumerable springs on every side, this swamp notion seems very practicable.\n\nA strong spring located in the playground of the former public elementary school near Pine and North Streets, was referred to as a place where many of the older residents secured their water supply. A stream ran from this spring down across Cherry Street and then the property at 130 Pike Street formerly owned by Asher Stevens and later, Dr Ashelman. This stream crossed Pike Street and emptied into Mill Creek at Canal Street. This swampy section of the town was reclaimed via the building of a sewer, which drained the entire plot.\n\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF PORT CARBON\n\nThe Earliest Settlers\n\nThe name of the first settler in what is now Port Carbon is not definite. Again tradition says before the year 1807 a man named Ludwig Stitzel, a carpenter, emigrated into the Mill Creek Valley and erected a saw mill near where the Yuengling Brewery stands today. He also is credited with erecting a log house near the sawmill, near the northeast corner of Fourth and Market Streets and it is suggested that Stitzel’s Mill was situated along the Mill Creek across from this site. In 1811, tradition has it, there was a maple sugar camp in the Mill Creek Valley, but its exact location is unknown.\n\nAnother story is that Shadrock Lord and Philip Faust came to the section about the same time as Mr. Stitzel, and were among the early settlers. Mr. Faust, it is said, was the sawyer at Stitzel’s sawmill, the former being succeeded as sawyer by George Hilbert. Early homes of this character were located in Black Valley and on First Street, opposite the home originally occupied by the Washington Lawrence and the Lawrence Major family at 335 First Street. Other early homes were located near the junction of Jackson and Pottsville Sts., and in the area of the former Mirawal plant a short distance north of the railroad cut through Salem Hill.\n\nPottsville Founder Owned Port Carbon\n\nIn 1821, John Pott, erected a sawmill in the Schuylkill Valley, near where the depot stood on the Tamaqua branch of the Reading Railroad. A log house was also erected near the mill, which was occupied by the sawyer, John Pott at this time seems to have been the sole owner of all the lands now embracing Port Carbon. That there was coal in this section is borne out by records which show that in the above year (1821) Messrs. Thomas S. Ridgway and Clayton Earl purchased an acre of ground from Pott lying along the Schuylkill River for a landing at which to load boats with coal when the canal should be completed to Port Carbon. This plot was just east of where Mill Creek empties into the Schuylkill River and opposite the Miller Playground. As the canal was not opened to Port Carbon until 1828, these two men were convinced the town was destined to some day become an important coal shipping point.\n\nIn 1826, several saw mills dotted the settlement, but the village lacked shape or designated streets. Sawed timber and logs cut from the hillside during the winter, were dragged to the riverbank where they were made into rafts to await the spring freshets, and then conducted down the river to Reading and other points. While this rafting was a hazardous undertaking, hardy pioneers were ready to undertake the task.\n\nWild Beasts Inhabited Hills.\n\nBy way of digression from the story of Port Carbon, it is handed down that in the early days of the village, game and wild beasts roamed the mountains. Mrs. Bailey, called “Granny” Bailey, was an early settler near Pottsville and often told interested hearers of a narrow escape she, with her husband and several friends had from being devoured by timber wolves in the Schuylkill Valley.\n\nAt the time Mr. and Mrs. Bailey lived in Pottsville. They had several friends living in the vicinity of Tuscarora whom they visited one winter’s day while there was excellent sleighing. The trip to Tuscarora was made without incident, but they were detained in making the homeward trip until after nightfall. They had gone but a few miles when the entire party was horrified to discover they were being followed by a pack of yelping wolves. The driver urged his team to the limit, but the deep snow impeded their speed, and the wolves gained on them. When the latter came within a short distance of the sleigh a bear robe with which the women of the party covered themselves was thrown to the hungry beasts. This checked their speed but momentarily as they fought for fragments of the skin. Soon they were tearing down the road after the now thoroughly frightened and desperate party. One of the women had a baby in her arms and for a brief period those in the sleigh debated whether they should not, to save their own lives, throw the child to the frenzied beasts. This sacrifice was not necessary, however as the sleighing party came to a settler’s home somewhere between New Philadelphia and Cumbola. Having heard the howling beasts and the driver yelling at his horses, the man appeared on the road, and fired a few, well directed shots that scattered the wolves to the mountains. Saved from a most horrible death, the party proceeded on its way home without further molestation or scares. Mrs. Bailey often related this story and the memories of the night’s wild excitement invariably caused the aged lady to shudder.\n\nSon of John Pott Credited as Founder\n\nIn those early days, Port Carbon was simply a collection of crude dwellings, yet comfortable and convenient for the hardy pioneers. In 1826, Abraham Pott purchased 630 acres of land from his father, which included the site of Port Carbon and surrounding territory. Abraham erected a frame house on East Washington St.. It was located along the Schuylkill River, along the northbound side of Route 209 leading to Tamaqua. He also erected five tenement houses on the opposite side of the road in the same vicinity. In addition, he erected a sawmill near the centre of the town, along Mill Creek, between what is now Pottsville and Washington streets and Jackson and Pike streets. This made the third saw mill for the settlement. Mr. Pott also began laying out lots and roads, including what are now known as Coal, Pike, Jackson, First and Washington streets, as well as roads one leading over Sharp Mountain, eastward into the Tumbling Run valley.\n\nFirst Land Sold Cheap\n\nIn 1828 Abraham Pott sold to Messrs. Jacob W. Seitzinger and William Wetherill, thirty-four acres of land in Port Carbon for $45 per acre, which the new owners laid out in building lots. This tract was located along both sides of Jackson St., from near Coal St. north. Early in the 1830’s the new owners erected a row of three stone houses on the plot nearly opposite to the Beddall (or recently Steinert’s) mansion on the corner of Jackson and Rose Avenue. In front of this row they also dug a well, the pump in which supplied the immediate neighborhood with water until the Pottsville Water Co, ran its mains into the town. Each of the three houses was provided with a cellar kitchen, and these latter were nearly on the level with the corduroy road which ran along the front now Jackson street. Today the street is fully five feet higher than the entrance to the basements referred to. When water mains were laid along this street the trench diggers were compelled to cut through the logs which comprised the corduroy road. Behind these houses was also at one time a fine spring, which in the early 1880’s was permitted to partly fill up.\n\nFirst Log Homes Decayed\n\nAlmost directly in the rear of the row of dwellings referred to, but on the opposite side of the tracts where the railroad bed runs from the Salem Hill Cut to Jackson Street, Samuel Seitzinger erected in the early 1820’s a frame dwelling house, which is standing today and is still occupied. Samuel Seitzinger was the father of Jeremiah Seitzinger, a blacksmith who for may years was employed at the Franklin Iron Works. The latter was one of the oldest Odd Fellows in Pennsylvania.\n\nNear this frame house stood a log house, spoken of previously and for many years occupied by Jacob Hunt and family. This building has fallen to decay, it having been erected in the early 1820’s. North of this was erected, near the junction of Jackson and Pottsville streets, and close to Salem Hill, about the same time, another log house was for many years occupied by Michael Hinkle and family.\n\nWhat was known as the brick row, near the railroad bed on Jackson Street, was erected soon after the stone row further south was built. These brick houses were erected by the Kentucky Bank, which for a time conducted a banking and real estate business at the upper end of the house. Lawrence Whitney conducted this bank. Abraham Pott in the later 1800s erected a log house on west side of Coal Street, midway between Krebs Alley and the bend in Coal Street above North.\n\nFirst Children Born\n\nIt may be of interest here to note that the first children born in Port Carbon village were Leah Hilbert and Elizabeth Pott. The former upon reaching womanhood married a Mr. Hess. Upon his death she was united in marriage to a Mr. Newton. To the latter union a daughter, Ella, was born, who became the wife of Edward Wintersteen, who with several others of his crew, among them engineer Joseph Ziegler, was killed in a locomotive boiler explosion just north of St. Clair while going up the Frackville grade.\n\nElizabeth Pott, the daughter of Abraham Pott, upon reaching womanhood, became the wife of Benjamin Eshelman, who became a coal operator and whose family for a time lived on Pike Street. Some of the descendants of the Abraham Pott family still reside in the county.\n\nWhere Villages Got Their Name.\n\nIn making the sale of 34 acres to Messrs. Seitzinger and Wetherill, Abraham Pott reserved an acre of ground along the river and creek front for a coal wharf, and back of this proposed wharf there were soon erected a number of dwellings. As this made the second acre reserved along the riverfront for coal wharves, that section of the village became known as Acretown.\n\nLawtontown, which comprises the northeastern section of Port Carbon, takes its name from William Lawton, who laid out building lots in 1829. Mr. Lawton purchased the tract from the Kentucky Bank, which was a big landowner in that section at the time. Lawton came to Port Carbon early in 1829 and erected an office building on First Street. The building stood at the corner of First and Lyon Streets on what was the Reynolds family property. Lawton had a somewhat crude way of marking off the lots on a map. He had a large map prepared, giving every lot in numbers and those sold he marked in red ink. In one corner of the map he had written: “Every lot marked in red ink has been sold and paid for.” This map he gave to the late Washington H. Lawrence. Unfortunately this map was destroyed by fire in July of 2000.\n\nThe section of Port Carbon along Jackson Street near the Mirawal Building was called the Salem Hill Settlement. Later in the 19th Century this section of town earned the name of Mechanicsville owing to the large number of mechanics who lived in that section of town. In January of 1914, Mechanicsville became its own community when residents in that section petitioned the state to become a new borough.\n\nRhoades Town, or Rhoades addition to Port Carbon was developed beginning in 1829 by Daniel Rhoades. This section of town is roughly the section from Mill Street eastward to the East Norwegian Township border and is bounded to the south by Palo Alto Borough. Irishtown earned its name in the 1840s and 50s due to the heavy concentration of Irish Settlers along Valley Street. The Black Valley was that section which runs from the Schuylkill River northward along Wood Street to Valley Street. This section was developed as an important mining area and the village of Belmont sprung up here in the mid 19th Century. Dutchtown is another name that has faded from usage by Port Carbon residents, but it was a so named because of the large number of Pennsylvania Dutch residents who settled in the area of fourth street between Commerce an Chestnut Streets.\n\nGraytown is that section of the borough that is also a part of East Norwegian Township. This section is located at the lower end of Schoentown along Fifth Street and was named after Robert Gray who laid out the village at the beginning of the 20th Century. Schoentown was named after Phillip Schoen an early resident of Port Carbon. Originally called Schoenville, this section of town evolved as an addition to Port Carbon as early as 1908 and was settled by a large number of Lithuanian Immigrants. Prior to this it was generally known as Dr. George Brown’s farm.\n\nCoal Company Scares Residents\n\nIn 1889 quite a scare was caused to a number of Lawtontown residents who had purchased lots from Mr. Lawton. The Alliance Coal Company sent a representative to inform quite a few residents they were squatters on the company’s property the latter having purchased the mineral rights under the lots. As many had failed to have deeds made out or recorded, there was nothing to show – at least at the courthouse—that the lots had been purchased. Finally the old map given to Mr. Lawrence by Mr. Lawton was produced, and the company convinced that it had moved hastily. The map settled all difficulty and deeds were later placed on record.\n\nAmong the first houses erected in Lawton’s Addition, and what later was designated by the high sounding name of Quality Hill, was that occupied by the Major family. Strange as it may appear, with timber and saw mills turning out prepared lumber in the vicinity, the timber used in the house referred to was all brought to Port Carbon in a boat from Chester County by Joseph Radcliffe, a boatman, who erected the house. The lumber was all squared and ready to be fitted together when it reached Port Carbon,\n\nAbraham Pott laid out the section of the borough known as Irishtown 1829. He sold half of this tract to Burd Patterson and Joseph Swift. John and Robert Young laid out part of Mechanicsville in 1826 on lands belonging to them.\n\nTHE CANAL AND EARLY COAL MINING OPERATIONS\n\nThe First Discovery of Coal . . .\n\n. . . in the vicinity of Port Carbon is somewhat obscure. In the 1760s, surveyors discovered anthracite coal in the vicinity of Pottsville and Minersville. The survey team was plotting the course of the King’s Highway from Reading to Sunbury. Local legend also notes that frontiersman Necho Allen discovered Anthracite Coal on Broad Mountain in 1790. Tradition has it that its existence in the Port Carbon area was known previous to 1800. According to some early histories, William Morris, who owned a tract of land in the vicinity of what is now Port Carbon, discovered what was considered a vein of first class coal in 1800. Imbued with the spirit of progress and hoping to successfully introduce the new fuel, he had a lot of it prepared, loaded on a wagon and taken to Phila. He was, however, doomed to disappointment, as his every effort failed to induce the Quaker City residents to give the new fuel a fair and unprejudiced trial.\n\nCanal Carried Coal\n\nAs early as 1822, the early pioneers had boated coal down the Schuylkill River to Philadelphia. Among them, were Ridgeway, Earl and Abraham Pott. Some of the earliest coal mined by Pott and shipped down river, came from what was called the Tunnel Vein just south of the hill along the road to Pottsville. The coal was taken by team to Mount Carbon and then placed on flat boats, 12 feet by 20 feet in size.\n\nIn the year 1827 the work of extending the Schuylkill canal from Mr. Carbon to Port Carbon was begun and completed the following year. At the time the extension was begun, there was a coal wharf at Mt. Carbon near where the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad sidings are situated, and this was later extended northward toward Pottsville. At Young’s Landing (near the intersection of Route 209 and Anderson Street), another coal wharf was erected later between the highway and the Schuylkill River.\n\nMany Coal Wharves Erected\n\nThe canal was opened to a short distance above the bridge spanning the Schuylkill River between Port Carbon and Palo Alto. Just east of the concrete bridge erected by the P & R railway company over the river, and over which the trains passed to St. Clair and beyond, a dam was erected, as well as one at Young’s Landing. The dam above the railroad bridge was provided with locks, and formed a large basin in which boats remained until loaded at Port Carbon. The old stone lock-house is no longer standing, but the remains of the (Thomas) Firth dock can still be seen from Route 209. The erection of coal wharves kept pace with the construction of the canal. One wharf was erected along the Schuylkill River between Coal Street and the River and was extended to the mouth of Mill Creek behind the Heritage Bank Branch on Coal Street. Another landing was also erected west of the bridge connecting Port Carbon and Palo Alto. When the canal was first constructed into Port Carbon, no towpath was provided and boatman were compelled to “pole” their boats between the terminus and Young’s Landing, the towpath being constructed later. The first boats to use the new waterway were of small capacity compared with those of today, their capacity ranging from 20 to 30 and later from 60 to 70 tons. Above the terminus of the canal at Port Carbon along the Route 209 heading to Tamaqua, another dam was built but this was for the purpose of preventing refuse from the river flowing into the canal.\n\nNew Canal Main Shipping Point\n\nThe opening of the canal to Port Carbon created a new era in the history of the village. While mining and the preparation of coal for market were in a primitive state, the village was a busy place, and was regarded as the main shipping point for anthracite coal. The early coal shipped was dug in what is now known as Black Valley, Bear Ridge, Belmont and other small operations on the outskirts of the village as far east as what was known as Belfast Colliery. Much of this was brought to the Port Carbon wharves in wagons. In 1830 Port Carbon had a population of about 900 souls.\n\nAbraham Pott Constructed First Railroad in 1827\n\nRealizing the need for transporting coal from the mines to the head of navigation, Abraham Pott, built a railroad from the wharves at Port Carbon to Black Valley in 1827. Pott’s railroad was one half mile in length. This was a somewhat primitive structure with rails of heavy timber and strap iron nailed to the top on which the cars ran. The wooden cars held from a ton to a ton and a half, had bottom dumps, and were pulled to and from the mines at Black Valley by horses and mules. In 1829, Mr. Pott erected another railway of the same character from Port Carbon a distance of about four miles up the Mill Creek valley, with small lateral lines to reach the various mine workings. In order to avoid a long detour around the eastern end of Salem Hill, Charles Ellet dug a tunnel through this hill. The entrance from the north was a short distance east of the present cut which was dug when the steam road entered the town. Later all of these primitive rail lines were extended, the one from Black Valley continued as far as Tuscarora.\n\nSalem Hill Mining Operations\n\nIn 1829 Abraham Pott opened a drift into Salem Hill, at a point just north of the railroad cut, and worked the same for several years. From this drift, he built a railroad to connect with the coal docks. About six years later, Mr. Pott having abandoned the drift, Messrs. Hewes, Baber & Co—John G. Hewes and Charles Baber being the principal men in the company—began work at the abandoned drift and sank a slope.\n\nIn 1834 one of the openings in the Salem Hill was sunk just east of the railroad cut on the southern edge of town. This mine was opened on a 230 acre tract of the Robert McDermott estate. The tunnel was worked for four years. Mr. Charles Ellet opened a slope on the north side of this hill below the water level for a distance of 300 feet using a pump made at the Haywood and Snyder shops in Pottsville. This pump was operated by an engine from the same shops, the engine doing both the hoisting and the pumping, a novelty for those days. Charles Ellet, who later gained fame in the mid west as a suspension bridge designer, also opened a tunnel through the Salem Hill at this point. The railroad cars that were loaded up the Mill Creek Valley, passed through this tunnel in the days before the railroad cut was made.\n\nIn those early days of mining the Salem Hill mines, a fair quality of coal was procured and for about sixteen years, or until about 1849, the firm continued working the slope. About this time they began to be hampered with water, which came in faster than the machinery of these days could handle. Seeing no way of taking care of the rapidly accumulating water, the company in 1849 abandoned the workings. In the abandoned slope, fifteen wagons loaded with coal were left behind, so hurriedly was the place closed, and the cars were, in 1914, still buried. The tools and machinery were also abandoned. This was the only colliery opened and successfully operated within the borough limits.\n\nIn the late 1890’s James Penman organized a company and opened a slope in Mechanicsville, or at that time, the West Ward of the borough. A breaker was erected and all the necessary modern machinery introduced, but the venture proved a failure. In the early half of the 20th Century, the Salem Hill Breaker was constructed. The Salem Hill area was mined into the early 1960s but again, with a reduced demand for anthracite the operation was forced to close. The Salem Hill Breaker was destroyed by fire in July of 1985. The silt from the Salem Hill operations can still be viewed today as much of the waste from this breaker was used to fill what was once the Schuylkill Canal running westward from the Firth Dock remains. The culm and overburden bank north of Route 209 between Port Carbon and Pottsville stands as a monument to the Salem Hill mine.\n\nCoal Broken at Wharves\n\nIn the early days, anthracite was brought to the wharves in large lumps. Here it was broken with sledgehammers and screened through large circular screens turned by hand. This coal was, however, not weighed before being loaded into boats. Receiving their cargo the boats proceeded as far as Mt. Carbon where there was a lock equipped with scales. Here the weight of both boat and cargo were taken and a duplicate of the weight given to the captain of the boat. The latter then proceeded on to Fairmount (Philadelphia) where there was another lock provided with a scale, and the second weighing took place. This second weighing was done as a checking against the captain of the boat selling coal to lock tenders while en-route to Philadelphia and from exchanging fuel with storekeepers for provisions.\n\nShortage of Coal Discovered\n\nMr. John H. Lime, who for many years was connected with the shipment of coal at Port Carbon and Schuylkill Haven, told an interesting story of a boatman who invariably reached Fairmount about four tons of coal short of that recorded at Mt. Carbon. The boatman could not explain the shortage beyond blaming the weigh masters. Finally Mr. Lime’s father, who was also connected with coal shipping, accidentally discovered the reason for the invariable shortage. One day, shortly after the boatman in question had left Port Carbon with a cargo while walking along the canal between the head of navigation to Schuylkill Haven, he noted a boat tied up a short distance below Mr. Carbon and also saw a man removing coal with a wheelbarrow and dumping it along the roadside a short distance away. Cautiously approaching the busy worker Mr. Lime was surprised to see the man whose cargo always showed a difference at the two weighing points was the one using the wheelbarrow. Reaching the boat unobserved Mr. Lime waited until the man appeared with a barrow load, and quietly remarked, “Well,” calling the man by his first name, “this is where and how your cargo always loses weight, is it?” Being caught in the act the boatman could do no better than admit Mr. Lime’s question told the truth. It had been the boatman’s custom to unload what he thought was about four tons, some for his own winter use, while the surplus was disposed of to neighbors at considerable below the market price of the fuel. This ended the shortage business for all time, with this one man, at least.\n\nBoats Built and Repaired at Home\n\nWith the coming of the canal and the boats came boat yards, where boats were built and repaired. The first to open up such an industry at the head of navigation is not fully known today. A Mr. Shappel, father of the late Wm. Shappel, of Port Carbon, early in the history of the canal, conducted a yard near the John L. Miller Playground, west of the bridge spanning the Schuylkill river at what was then the Franklin Iron Works and is now the former site of J. Robert Bazley’s.\n\nSamuel Gray conducted another yard along the Schuylkill west of the bridge connecting Port Carbon and Palo Alto,. At this yard the two last boats were built at the end of navigation. This was in 1857. Phillip and David Paul were also early canal boat builders in Port Carbon.\n\nBoats Brought Back Supplies\n\nThe majority of the boatmen of the early days brought return cargoes back to Port Carbon. These consisted of merchandise and other necessities which the times demanded. In this manner the trip was made doubly remunerative. Merchants at Port Carbon and other points would give boat captains orders for needful supplies when the outward trips were made and the orders would be filled on the return trip.\n\nBoats from the Union canal which branched off from Reading to the west through Berks, Lebanon and Dauphin counties brought cargoes of grain to Port Carbon which were disposed of at a grist mill which stood over the Schuylkill River to the east of Mill Street (hence the street name). Conrad Straub and Lawrence F. Whitney erected this mill in 1838. Later the mill was conducted by Adams & Co. (Daniel and Wm. Adams and C.B. Dietrich). Later the firm was changed to Loose and Adams (Daniel), and the last firm to conduct the mill was Grim and Medlar-Jonathan Grim and George Medlar. Later the property was sold to two gentlemen from Pottsville, who permitted it to lie idle for a time until it was completely destroyed by fire in May 1893.\n\nModern Sized Coal Produced\n\nThe sizes of coal prepared for market at the Port Carbon docks were broken, egg, stove and nut, the latter being the smallest. About sixty, to seventy boats were engaged in coal transportation between Port Carbon and tidewater until 1845-46, when the canal was widened and deepened. This resulted in larger boats, with capacities of from 150 to 175 tons of coal, while the number engaging in the transportation business was also largely increased.\n\nFirst Iron Bridge Brought from Philadelphia\n\nReference has previously been made to boats upon their return trip bringing merchandise to Port Carbon. It may be of interest to note that the first iron bridge erected in Port Carbon was brought there by boat from Pencoyd, near Phila., by John P. Bailey. It was erected over Mill Creek at Coal Street in 1836, and did service until the turn of the 20th Century, when it was condemned and replaced by a more substantial and wider structure. The electric railway company and the borough of Port Carbon paid for this bridge. That bridge was replaced in the 1980s.\n\nHeavy Rains Routinely Cause Damage\n\nIn 1831 and again in 1841 much damage was done in the village as well as to the canal by heavy freshets. The greater part of the town was inundated and many private properties suffered severe damages. Among the heavy losers then was Abraham Pott, the practical founder of the town. In 1850 the town again suffered heavily from high water, many fences and outbuildings having been washed away and garden plots destroyed. In 1888, 1913 and in 1924 the swollen river flooded the town. In September of 1924 the river washed away the Pottsville Street Bridge along with the Rose Avenue footbridge. Dr. Ashelman’s cellar was flooded on Pike Street. The flood hit in 1936 and again in 1972 with Hurricane Agnes and Port Carbon’s downtown suffered greatly from flood waters.\n\nOf these floods many of this generation’s residents recall the early season Hurricane that wreaked havoc throughout eastern Pennsylvania in June of 1972. After two days of rain, the Mill Creek and Schuylkill River swelled and crested. The floodwaters filled the streets and basements along Jackson, South Coal, Washington, Commerce, Canal and Pottsville Streets. The flood destroyed the footbridge on Rose Avenue while other bridges were threatened with a similar fate. The greatest damage to the borough was via the water filled basements in the flood-ravaged part of town. Heroic members of the Goodwill Fire Company, worked feverishly to help the town recover from Hurricane Agnes, which caused several million dollars in damage locally.\n\nTroubles Experienced in Early Days.\n\nWhile the coal business constantly increased and the primitive wooden railways were extended and new ones constructed, and new coal measures were opened, Port Carbon was not without its troubles. While there was work for all who wished it about the mines, railroads and the coal wharves, few there were who laid anything aside for the proverbial “rainy day.”\n\nThe saloons, with which the town was amply supplied, became the scenes of drinking bouts with not a few fistic encounters, and there were many “bullies” and reputed “bad men”, such as have always infested every new country or mining field, and the older residents tell of some bitter fights among rival factions. In the early days of Schuylkill River navigation, a gang of thieves preyed upon the canal traffic. From Philadelphia to Port Carbon, this criminal gang was known as the Schuylkill Rangers. By the end of the Civil War era, these river pirates were eradicated by a determined citizenry who grew intolerant and more vigilant along the canal towns between here and tidewater in Philadelphia.\n\nCanal Abandoned\n\nIn 1850 the canal basin at Port Carbon, extending from the dam-breast running from the ruins at Firth Dock through the Miller Playground to just beyond the Mill Street Bridge, was practically abandoned. This was done because of the expense of keeping the basin clear of debris and coal dirt which in those dams found its way in the river whenever there were heavy rains and freshets. While this end of the canal was abandoned as well as the coal wharves, a few boats continued to come into Port Carbon with merchandise brought from Philadelphia and New York for local merchants. Gradually the basin fell prey to the ravages of time, and the sound of the boatman’s horn in Port Carbon became a memory.\n\nShortly after the abandonment of the Port Carbon basin new stone coal docks were erected at Palo Alto just west of the present line of the railway leading to Frackville. These docks became very busy marts during the boating season and gave employment a number of men, as there was a constant demand for coal. In 1856 these docks were entirely completed and used as the head of navigation. Below or westward from these stone docks, trestling was erected at which boats were also loaded. These docks and trestling were used in the loading of boats up until the time the canal was abandoned from Schuylkill Haven north, in 1870. By November of 1888, the local newspaper suggested that measures be taken to fill the old canal between Port Carbon and Palo Alto. The filling of the canal occurred slowly over time, but it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the majority of the canal dock near Port Carbon was almost completely filled in. The stone walls of these docks are still discernable from Route 209, and the masonry gives the impression that the Schuylkill Navigation Company was built to survive many generations. A Pennsylvania Historical Marker was erected near this point in 1999, thanks to Bob Bryden, who worked feverishly to clear the dock area of overgrowth and bring recognition to the importance of the Schuylkill Canal at this location.\n\nSome Pioneers of Canal Boats\n\nA complete roster of the boatmen who plied the canal and had their homes in Port Carbon would undoubtedly prove most interesting, but to secure such a list is an impossibility at this late day. Among some, of those mentioned as having boats on the canal are Robert Wheeler, Thos. McGrath, Patrick Cauley, John P. Bailey, John W. Slattery, John P. McCord, Sr., John Dolan, Thomas and Michael Connelly, Patrick Mullen, Edward Mullen, Edward and Peter Blunt, William and Dennis Buckley, Michael and Thomas O’Brien, Edward McDonald, John McDonald, Patrick and Timothy Keough, Dennis and Owen Flannery, Perie Condon, Valentine Hartman, Thos. Burns, Michael Crowley, Maurice Woods, Matthew, Michael and Edward Burke, John Condon, John Carey, Wm. H. Carey, Michael Flannery, James F. Harrison, John Ryan and Robert Gunsel.\n\nPORT CARBON DEVELOPS INTO A BOROUGH\n\nVillage Incorporated\n\nThe village of Port Carbon was incorporated into a borough by a special act of the Legislature approved by Governor William Bigler on the 23rd of April, 1852. This Act, after defining the boundary lines of the proposed borough, practically the lines as they were before the withdrawal of Mechanicsville, provided for an election to be held at the public house of George Dougherty on the first Monday of June following the passage of the Act. This election was for the selection of Chief Burgess, nine Councilmen, a Town Clerk, two Justices of the Peace, High Constable, one Assessor and two Assistant Assessors. The Act also provided that annually thereafter on the first Monday of February an election be held to choose a Chief Burgess, three Councilmen, Town Clerk, Assessor and two assistant assessors. Council was further directed, after the first election, to meet on the first Wednesday after said election and divide into three lots of three each, one trio to serve one year, another two years and the third three years.\n\nThe Act further provided that any person elected to a borough office and refusing to serve made himself liable to a fine of $10, although no person should be compelled to serve more than one year. The Chief Burgess, president of Council and borough treasurer were by the Act designated as a board of tax appeal. Provision was also made for the election annually of three borough auditors.\n\nFirst Election\n\nIn accordance with the above Act the first election was held on June 7, 1852, at the place designated. The election officers were: Judge, Milton Boone; inspector, Leonard Mertz and Geo. D. Lub. The election resulted in the choice of the following:\n\nChief Burgess, Ross Bull.\n\nCouncilmen, T.H. Wintersteen, John E. Wootten, Milton Boone, Daniel Knittle, Philip Steinbach, Obadiah Reed, Jos. Snyder, John Illingsworth and Jacob Lime.\n\nTown Clerk, Henry Shissler\n\nHigh Constable, Solomon Seligman\n\nAuditors, Jacob Fister, Leonard Mertz and John Groves\n\nAssessor, John C. Lewis\n\nAssistant Assessors, Charles Baber and Adam Herzog\n\nThe first meeting of the new council was held in Odd Fellows’ Hall in an upper story of the building once occupied by John C. McKenna, on Coal Street, the election returns received and rules of order for the government of the body adopted. The Burgess at that time acted as president of council.\n\nIn the act incorporating the village of Port Carbon into a borough, it was provided the Chief Burgess should serve as president of Borough Council. This practice prevailed until 1872, when a supplemental act was passed by the legislature repealing that section designating the Chief Burgess as council’s presiding officer, and providing that council meet the first Monday after the annual borough election and choose its own presiding officer.\n\nPolice Force Organized\n\nThat the town felt the need of an ample police force in those early days is shown by the fact that at a meeting of Council held June 16, following organization, the Chief Burgess named the following as a police force: John Hadesty, Joseph Bowe, Wm. Bright, John Glenn, Samuel Bridgehouse, Bryan Mullen, Robert Smith, Jesse Raudenbush, William Wolffinger, William Dicus, Moses Robinson, Jeremiah Foster, Daniel Devine, John Cooper, Wm. Ecker, Johnson Brown, James Hegins, Joshua Siegfried, Eli Shively, Richard Jones, Walter L. Chillson, Daniel Wintersteen, Solomon Seligman, John Groves, Joseph Lawton, Levi Hilbert, Michael Weand, Philip Huber, Wm. Borger, Uriah Gane, Elias Keller and Frank Bachman. This is by far a larger police force than the town has had ever since, but how they governed the welfare of the town is not stated.\n\nBorough Building Constructed\n\nThe Council held its meetings following the first, in the schoolhouse, situated on Washington Street, for some time. At a meeting held July 21, 1853, Daniel Knittle, T.H. Wintersteen, John L. Hadesty, Phillip Steinnbach, George H. Fisher and Uriah Gane were named as a committee to secure a site for the erection of a borough building. This committee chose a site fronting on Pike street and extending back along Washington street to Mill Creek as a borough building lot, and on that site a stone borough building was erected, the second story being used as a meeting place for Borough Council up until the erection of the new building at the corner of Pike and Washington streets in 1879. The old borough building was used as a lockup and storehouse for supplies on the first floor. Some of the more mature residents of Port Carbon remember this building as the library and later Girl Scout building, which was demolished in 1968 to make way for a new firehouse.\n\nThe new borough building was constructed of brick, and occupied on the first floor by the Good Will Hose Company with their apparatus and as a general meeting room. The second floor was divided off into two large rooms, the front being used as a Borough Council chamber and the rear room as a parlor by the Good Will Hose Co. Contractor John Conrad erected this building using bricks from Asher Stevens’ brickyard near Jackson Street. This building was utilized as Borough Council Chambers until the Presbyterian Church was converted into Borough Hall in the 1970s.\n\nEarly Hotels and Saloons\n\nThe first hotel opened in Port Carbon village was located at the northeast corner of Pike and Coal streets in 1829 by a man named Barney Taylor, who came to the place as a carpenter. William H. Carey occupied this corner with a general store. Tradition says that the first actual storekeeper in the village was one Samuel Christman who opened a general merchandise business in Acretown, in 1832.\n\nAmong the early additional hotels opened was what is now known as the Port Carbon House on Jackson street. A man named Keener, and then Fred Trachte conducted this hotel. Later Michael Weand became proprietor. This hotel was for a long time the stopping place for farmers, who came from the lower end of the county and even from Berks County, with produce. It was the scene also of horse and carrel sales in its early days. Near this hotel at one time in the early days of the town, stood a brick building which was used as a soap factory. On Jackson St. Charles Newton conducted another hotel in the early 1870s, but the building was later converted into dwelling house.\n\nOn the corner below Coal and Jackson streets, Owen Eagan for many years conducted a hotel, this being one of the early places of the kind in the town. He also for a long time conducted a bottling establishment at this place and had several teams on the road. Upon his death the property fell to his sister, Mrs. Lamey, who later sold it to the late Frederick Leffler. A Mr. Frederick Leffler bought this property and later tore down the old buildings and built a new hotel, which he operated up until the time of his death, when his son, Albert F. conducted it for a time, later selling out to Charles Diehl. The place was called the Exchange Hotel.\n\nAnother of the early hotels was Anthracite Hall, on East Washington St., later known as the George Holder home. It is located on the road leading to Tamaqua and is the last house in Port Carbon, going east. The place was conducted by John Grooves, Mr. Holder’s father-in-law, and was one of the popular places among the boatmen and early miners.\n\nThe Mt. Vernon House, at Pike and East Washington St., was another popular place in the early days. The early proprietors were George Dougherty and John Condon. Later Richard Holihan purchased the property, and his widow, Rose later conducted the place.\n\nAt the corner of Acre and Laing Streets Mrs. Mary Burke conducted a saloon. This was one of the popular places among the boatmen and miners as there was a handball court connected with it, when many spirited fames were played. This was a prominent meeting place for sports from every section up the Schuylkill Valley. The Cantwell family too, operated a hotel and bar on Pike Street between Coal and Valley Street.\n\nWhere Peter Bassler conducted his general store on Coal St., near the Mill Creek Bridge, Bartholomew, better known as “Bart” O’Reagan conducted a wholesale liquor store during the 1860s and 70s. Later he became proprietor of a saloon located in the basement of the brick building erected by Uriah Gane at the corner of Pike and Coal Sts. When the Emerald Hall was erected in 1896, at the corner of Pike and Coal Sts., Andrew Hillard opened a saloon in the building. Joseph Eisenach conducted the Pike Street House for a number of years, and William Spencer conducted the Hotel Spencer.\n\nFighting Scenes Were Common\n\nAs in the great majority of the mining and boating towns of the early days the bar rooms of the Port Carbon hotels were the scenes of many fights. Every section had its champion and when the latter same to town and became slightly “lit up” he was always ready for a scrap and was generally accommodated. These were not “bad men” as they scorned carrying a knife or gun, depending solely upon their brawn and muscle and their knowledge of the science of the manly art to carry them through. They became fighters and heroes in the communities because their friends compelled them to. During the first half of the 20th Century, this art became a regular sport, but bouts involving local “professionals” were held at Charlton’s Hall in Pottsville, at Lakeside and other venues around the county.\n\nSteam Railways Enter Town\n\nIn June 1843 the first steam railway was built into the town, being an extension of the Reading lines from Pottsville to Middleport, and known as the Pottsville and Tuscarora railroad. Its advent put new impetus into the coal business in the Schuylkill Valley, as transportation facilities were thus added which far exceeded those provided by the old wooden rail system and horse drawn cars. Shortly after this line was completed a weigh scales for the weighing of coal brought down the valley was erected opposite the Valley Station where the coal was weighed as the cards passed over the scales at a slow speed and the weight recorded in an office on the opposite side of the road from the passenger depot which stood on Commerce Street between Jackson and Pottsville Streets.\n\nFirst Weigh Master Jesse Turner\n\nJesse Turner was the first weigh master in the early days of the railroad, a position he held for many years, when he was made tolls collector and was succeeded as weigh master by the late Jacob Wentz who held the position until the scales were abandoned. Mr. Wentz was then made station master and ticket agent at the Valley depot which he held until the time of his retirement.\n\nThe later George W, Wintersteen was well known among the coal operators of the Schuylkill Valley at this time, as he was engaged in the business of selling the coal produced by the individual mine operators to the Schuylkill navigation Company. John Lime was also at one time station agent at this point and also held a position as shopper at Tuscarora.\n\nMill Creek Railway Built\n\nIn 1846 a branch of railway line was extended from the line above referred to from what is known as Mill Creek Jet to St. Clair, known as the Mill Creek railway. The most difficult part of the line was the cutting of a roadway through Salem Hill, which in those days was considered quite an undertaking. This line added another feeder to the coal docks at Port Carbon and put new life in the coal mining business in the Mill Creek Valley. Opposite to where the depot stood on Commerce Street, another weigh scales was located where coal coming from the mines farther up was weighed. The weigh master at this point was George Hadesty who held the position until the scales were transferred to St. Clair.\n\nThe Saint Clair Railroad Yard / Industrial Park\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th Century the rail line passing through Port Carbon was one of the busiest branches of the Reading system, as the greater part of the coal mined in the Mahanoy Valley was shipped over the Mahanoy Plane, down the Frackville grade into the Saint Clair yard. The Saint Clair yard became the largest and most important rail yard in the country when it was developed in the 1910s. This yard employed scores of Port Carbon residents, including Emmanuel Templin, who was appointed as one of its earliest yardmasters. The Saint Clair Railroad yard, complete with a modern roundhouse and turntable, replaced the Reading’s Palo Alto Yard as the primary transshipment point for the region’s anthracite coal wealth.\n\nThe Saint Clair yard served the region until the early 1960s when a drop in the demand for anthracite forced the company to reduce and later close its operations. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Reading’s Saint Clair Yard, with support buildings, several miles of track and roundhouse were demolished to make way for a new industrial development park. Today this park employs a new generation of Port Carbonites as the Borough moves into the 21st Century. The industrial park, with its newest tenant, the Yuengling Brewery, signals the return of the railroad.\n\nPost Office Opened\n\nIn 1829 the first post office was established in the village, but its exact location is somewhat vague. Mails at that time came to the village but twice a week. The first postmaster was a man named Elisha Warne. At a later date, the Dr. Gwinner residence on Pike Street served as a drug store and post office in the first few decades of the 20th Century. The present Post Office was constructed in the 1950s adjacent to Mill Creek on Washington Street.\n\nElectric Railway Entered Town\n\nOn February 25, 1891, the borough council passed an ordinance granting the then Pottsville Electric Railway Co. the right of way to enter the borough. During the following summer the line was build from Palo Alto into the town by way of Coal St., to Pike, thence north on Pike to H.E. Paul’s marble yard, at Pike and Market Sts., which for several years was the terminus. Later council granted the right of way for an extension of this line north on Market St., to the borough limits and thence on to St. Clair. After this line was completed another ordinance was passed granting the right of way on Pike and East Washington streets, for the construction of the Tamaqua division. In all these grants, the borough was most liberal, the residents anxious to secure all transportation facilities possible. In the early days of the trolley era, the horses of town were often troubled by the new mode of transportation. On one occasion that first year, a horse standing in front of James Connor’s Hotel, became frightened by the electric car and broke a pair of hitching shafts. In a few years, the trolley and later the automobile, encouraged the eventual disappearance of horses from the streets of town.\n\nOrdinances were later introduced asking the right of way on Pottsville Street through Mechanicsville and into Pottsville, and also for a line on First and other streets to run also over what is known as Belmont Hill into Five Points. These later proposals never did transpire, since the borough already developed ample traveling facilities in almost every direction.\n\nThe Trolley remained a popular means of transportation up into the 1920s. Unfortunately for trolley fans, their popularity was replaced by another means of mass transportation when jitneys and bus service replaced the trolley across Schuylkill County. The trolley company ended service in Schuylkill County in 1931. For many years afterward, the trolley rails could be seen along Coal and Pike Streets in the Borough, but layers of macadam and asphalt have covered these vestiges of an earlier era. The East Penn Transportation Company and later the Schuylkill Transportation System replaced the trolley with bus service through Port Carbon.\n\nDr. Brown’s Farm\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th Century, one of the show places about Port Carbon, was Dr. George W. Brown’s farm, to the northeast of the borough where Schoentown is today. Dr. Brown came to Port Carbon in 1844, from White Creek Valley, and soon established a large practice, having for a number of years been the doctor for the Reading Railway Co. He always took a keen delight in agriculture and high bred horses and cows. He established the farm and conducted it successfully, placing the soil in the most productive condition possible and raising most bounteous crops. He was an ardent admirer of Jersey cattle and was the first to introduce that breed in this section. He purchased some of the finest pedigree stock, and erected a large new barn on the farm for housing his fancy cattle. He spared neither money nor labor in securing the best results, and paid what was at the time considered fabulous price for pedigreed sires for his herd. The farm was kept in the best of condition, all stables scrupulously clean and healthy, and milk form the Brown dairy was always in demand. The farm and stables were one of the show places about the town and were visited by hundreds of people annually. As the years of a most active practice began to demand a slow own in his physical activities Dr. Brown gradually turned the management of his farm over to others and later it passed into other hands.\n\nDr. Brown built his mansion at the northwest corner of Jackson and Washington Streets in the summer of 1847. In August 1882 a large barn, which stood in the rear of the doctor’s home, was destroyed by fire. The barn had just been filled with a new crop of hay, and the cause of the fire has always remained a mystery, although some attributed it to the heating of the new crops. All the crops in the barn at the time were destroyed, as were also about eighteen hogs, which were housed in the rear of the main building. Several fire companies from Pottsville came over to Port Caron to assist in quenching the flames but little or nothing could be done, as by the time the firemen reached the scene the entire structure was in flames. The horses in the barn at the time were all saved, as was the harness and several wagons.\n\nDr. Brown died in 1890, honored and regretted by a wide circle of friends, especially among the medical fraternity. Dr. Brown laid out what was known as Midvale, or Brown’s cemetery, on the northeast outskirts of the borough in Schoentown. In those days the site was considered an ideal plot and many lots were been disposed of and burials made in the place. Brown also laid out a road leading northeast through what is now Schoentown, toward Tamaqua. Along this road in a hollow a short distance beyond Schoentown was a stone bridge of crude structure. This became known as Peddler’s bridge, tradition having it that a wandering peddler was murdered here in the early days of the highway, his body being found lying along the road. The perpetrator of the crime was never apprehended.\n\nGood Will Fire Company\n\nThe Good Will Fire Company was organized in 1879, although previous to this date there was a company in existence known as the Rough and Ready Fire Company. Its apparatus was an old style hand pump which the present organization very much regrets was not preserved as a relic of early days. The Good Will organized by electing William McQuade, President, Michael Fitzpatrick, Vice President, Thomas Beddall Secretary, George Medlar corresponding secretary, Thomas Garis Treasurer. One of the first acts of the Hose Company was the purchase of what was then considered the most modern and up to date fire equipment, a four wheeled crab, at a total cost of $1,000. Upon the presentation of the hose carriage on Thanksgiving Day, November 27, 1879, the firemen held their first parade. George Dougherty was the first foreman of the company.\n\nIn 1888, a new firehouse was constructed at the corner of Washington and Pike Streets in the Borough. This building was used for both the firehouse and Borough Council Chambers. During that same year, on August 29th, the fire company was incorporated. But it wasn’t until 1934 that the company’s name was officially changed to the goodwill Fire Company No. 1 In 1916, the fire company purchased their first Waterous Pumper at a cost of $6,500. Two years later in 1918, the first siren was installed on the roof of the firehouse.\n\nOver the years, the Good Will Hose Company continued to make improvements in terms of modernizing their fire fighting ability. In 1922 the first chemical truck was purchased at a cost of $2,300. This truck was replaced with a new chemical truck in 1934 at a cost of $1,140 and the trade-in. In 1937 and again in 1952 additional equipment upgrades were made.\n\nDuring the 1950s, fire companies from across the county recognized the value of creating an association of firefighters, and it was then that the Schuylkill County Volunteer Firemen’s Association was formed. Goodwill Fire Company joined this organization in 1955. Another development in the 1950s was the formation of a Ladies Auxiliary. This organization was formed on November 5, 1959 and the first officers were, Ethel DeLong, President, Edna Miles, Vice President, Marian Krater, Secretary, and Alma Mohl Treasurer.\n\nThe need for expanded facility for the company’s fire trucks emerged during the 1960s and as a result, a new engine house was built adjacent to the firehouse in the summer of 1969. The new engine room provided three bays for the company’s trucks. This building was expanded in 1975 with the addition of a social room on the second floor. On the anniversary of the Company’s 100th year, Goodwill hosted the 25th Annual Schuylkill County Volunteer Firemen’s Convention.\n\nBUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\n\nEarly Industries\n\nMention has been previously made of the early sawmills erected in the town, and of their work. In the early days of Port Carbon, Abraham Pott erected a steam sawmill in Black Valley to cut the timber, which grew in abundance in that section. Pott is also credited with having been the first steam engine set up and used north of Reading. With this engine and boiler Mr. Pott experimented for a time with coal as fuel. While failure greeted his efforts he was not dismayed. The difficulty seemed to devise some means of getting air through the mass of coal in the boiler and caring for the ashes. After repeated experiments Mr. Pott succeeded in devising a grate, which brought the desired results, and from then on coal was the fuel used here, and through his experiments and success others began to utilize coal for heating and steam purposes.\n\nFirst Brickyard Opened\n\nIn 1831 Mr. Pott opened a brickyard on the plot lying between Mill Creek and Salem Hill, which was conducted by him for a number of years. W.E.Womelsdorf also conducted a brickyard near the junction of Jackson and Coal streets, while to the east of this Jos. H. Beir and Charles Baber conduct another yard.\n\nMr. Asher Stevens operated the last brick yard in the borough. This yard was located between Jackson Street and Salem Hill. Here many thousands of bricks were burned, but as new machinery was demanded in the advance in brick making and as Mr. Stevens felt that increasing age demanded a slow down in his activities, he returned from brick manufacturing and erected a large ice house close to Salem Hill and alongside a dam (known later as Steven’s or Stevie’s Dam) formed by the removal of clay. Here he conducted the ice business for a number of years, and upon his retirement, his two sons, James E. and Oliver succeeded to the business, which they conducted until the ice house was destroyed by fire.\n\nBlacksmiths, Foundries and Industry\n\nBenjamin Haywood, about 1832, erected a blacksmith shop in the vicinity of where the Franklin Iron Works and later James Robert Bazley’s operation stood on Mill Street, and equipped it with lathes and other machinery for the turning of axles for the wooden mine cars then used in the transportation of coal from the mines to the Port Carbon docks.\n\nTobias Wintersteen, about 1839 erected a foundry and machine shop between what was the Franklin Iron Works and the Schuylkill Valley railroad. Mr. Wintersteen conducted this foundry successfully for a number of years. Mr. Wintersteen, owing to business reverses later, returned, and in the late 1870’s the building was torn down.\n\nAnother foundry and machine shop was established by Alfred brook in 1842. This shop was burned down and after it was rebuilt in 1863 by Robert Allison and Francis Bannan. This foundry was named the Franklin Iron Works and covered four acres operated by Allison. His sons Charles and Frank took over this business from their father. The Franklin Iron Works manufactured pumps, mining drills, iron castings, grates and operated a general machine manufacturing business.\n\nFrom 1900-1913, John Cathers owned and operated the business, which was purchased by the Coxe Traveling Grate Company. The site of the Franklin Iron Works changed hands several times until J. Robert Bazley purchased the site in 1931. From there Bazely formed one of the region’s most notable construction firms in eastern Pennsylvania. Bazley is noted for a his work on a number of highway projects most notably the laying of what is now Route 61 from Port Clinton to Pottsville, and also sections of the Northeast Extension of the PA Turnpike in Carbon County and Interstate 81 in Schuylkill County. The Bazley Shops along Mill and Main Streets stand as a landmark along the Schuylkill River on the eastern edge of the Borough.\n\nMills Added Gradually\n\nIn 1860 Charles Baber established a saw and planning mill for the manufacture of doors, window sashes and general building material, on a site a short distance west of where the Schuylkill Valley station stood near Main Street. This he conducted for some years and the plan was a busy one the year through. Later Mr. Baber retired and disposed of the business to Messrs. Weed & Colborn, who conducted the plant for a time, when it was abandoned and permitted to fall to decay.\n\nIn 1865 Zaccur Boyer of Pottsville erected a rolling mill on a plot along Main Street near where Liberty Oil is today, and along the Schuylkill Valley railroad. Later Mr. Boyer added an iron furnace and successfully conducted both until about 1878 when the Reading Coal and Iron Co. purchased the two plants, which were for a short time were conducted by the Atkins Brothers of Pottsville. The latter soon retired when the P. & R. Co. had the furnace remodeled, a man named Bennett introducing several late patents for the manufacture of pig iron. Another planning mill, saw mill and general carpenter ship was also conducted by the late Peter J. O’Neil.\n\nAnother of the early industries was the coach-making and general wheel-wright shop conducted by Garrett A. Burke, on Coal street near Jackson.\n\nBrewery, Marble Yard, Brass Foundry and Newspaper Among Early Industries\n\nWhile not within the borough limits at the time, as the borough was not organized until 1852, it may be of interest to state that in 1831 a man named A.Y. Moore erected and conducted a beer brewery along the road to Pottsville, between Young’s Landing and the present site of Port Carbon. How long this place was conducted no one can tell.\n\nIn 1885 H.E. Paul opened the first marble yard in Port Carbon, it being located on Pottsville St., along Mill Creek, at the western end of the bridge spanning that stream. In 1893 Mr. Paul moved to the junction of Pike and Market streets, where he and his son Harry operated the business. The Paul family marble work can best be viewed in the cemeteries of town.\n\nAmong the first stores in Port Carbon was Gwinner’s Bakery Shop, which was located at the corner of Pike and Coal Streets where Mulhall’s garage stood. On the corner of Pike and Psecond Streets at the site recently known as Brown and Dowling’s, Ross Bull owned a shoe shop. Bull also served as an amateur dentist, though he merely pulled teeth, he did not fill them or manufacture new ones.\n\nDaniel Knittle had a furniture store on South Coal Street and in a small room in the back of the shop he made chairs. For a brief time in the 1830s and around the turn of the 20th Century newspapers were published in Port Carbon, but only for a very short period. On Coal Street near its intersection with Jackson, E. W. DeWitt operated a brass foundry near the beginning of the 20th Century.\n\nRobert Allison and the First Car Purchased in the United States\n\nDuring a visit to Cleveland Ohio, Robert Allison of Port Carbon accompanied Alexander Winton on a drive through that city in one of Winton’s horseless carriages. Allison, an English born industrialist from Port Carbon, decided that he would purchase one of these contraptions, which in fact help to save Winton from declaring bankruptcy and saving America’s fledgling automobile industry in its earliest of days. This famous automobile was manufactured by the Winton Motor Carriage Company of Cleveland, Ohio. Allison bought the car for $1000 and in March of 1898, Winton’s famous car arrived by rail in Pottsville. After great effort, the car was started and Allison drove the car down Coal Street in Pottsville to Mauch Chunk and then to Port Carbon. History notes that Robert Allison of Port Carbon Pennsylvania purchased the first commercially produced automobile in the United States, thus garnering him a place in American history forever. Over the years, Allison purchased additional Wintons from the Cleveland manufacturer. He is also credited with having made the first auto trade-in in history. The first car purchased by Allison is now on display at the Crawford Auto – Aviation Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nHenry L. Miller and the Textiles Industry\n\nOf most recent memory, the most recognizable local industry during the 20th Century, was textile manufacturing. Upon locating at Port Carbon in 1904, Henry L. Miller opened an underwear manufacturing business in Port Carbon. Up until 1914, Miller operated his knitting mill on First Street near Grand, but soon after constructed a new brick factory style building on South Coal Street. This business grew over the century and reached its peak during the 1940s and 1950s when all of the country’s industrial might was tested by the rigors of World War. Henry Miller died in 1936 and John J. Miller succeeded his father in the running of the family business, and when the men returned from the war only to find fewer coal mining jobs, it was the textiles, the Miller family business that provided labor and jobs to the families of Port Carbon and surrounding communities. During the 1950s unemployment exceeded 20%, yet the majority of jobs were found by mostly the women who worked not only at H. L. Miller and Son’s plant, but also at a number of other textile mills in Schuylkill County.\n\nThe Miller family operated the business in Port Carbon for more than 90 years and contributed generously to the livelihood of its residents. Unfortunately a number of factors forced the family to close the plants in Port Carbon and later Schuylkill Haven. Changes in Environmental Protection laws during the 1970s forced expenditures aimed toward reducing the pollution of the Schuylkill River. The struggle of Union Labor in the garment industry too, caused increased overhead via higher wages thereby reducing the company’s competitive edge against foreign made clothing. But the killing blow for local textiles manufacturing came with the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which facilitated free trade with Canada and Mexico. NAFTA led to the movement of the American textiles industry overseas and across the border where workers could manufacture clothing at a reduced cost to business owners in under developed countries of Central America. The Miller Group could no longer afford to pay decent wages AND remain competitive in the garment industry and they were forced to close their doors, thereby putting an end to an industry, which helped clothe the soldiers of World War II and Korea.\n\nThe D.G. Yuengling and Sons Brewery\n\nIn the 1830s a small brewing operation was conducted in what is now the Borough limits of Port Carbon somewhere along Route 209 between here and Pottsville. With the exception of a brief mention in the history books, there is little information on Port Carbon’s first brewery. In 1998, Richard Yuengling Jr. announced plans to construct a new brewery in what was once the lower Saint Clair rail yard on the northwestern border of the borough with East Norwegian Township. In 2001 the new Yuengling Brewery brewed its first barrel of the popular Yuengling Lager, marking the opening of a new industry for Port Carbon that, based on past reputation, will surely last well into the 21st Century.\n\nWater Introduced Into Borough\n\nThe Yuengling Brewery of course could not make beer without water. And fortunately for the Yuengling family, Schuylkill County possesses some of the world’s best water. The same water that will be used to blend with the hops, grains and barleys of the brew master’s craft, has been drawn from the same aquifers that have supplied the residents of Port Carbon with water since the earliest days of the community.\n\nPrevious to 1880 the borough depended upon wells and springs for its water supply. In that year the Pottsville Water Company extended its lines into the town through an arrangement with the Borough council whereby the borough should have charge of the so-called water works, collect all water rents, make all repairs and extensions and pay the company so much annually. This plan was continued until about the year 1904, when the water company became dissatisfied with the local management, and took back the so-called works, paying the borough for whatever improvements and extensions it had made during the life of agreement. Today the Schuylkill County Municipal Authority has charge of water service for the borough and draws the community’s water from a number of dams situated north of Saint Clair on Broad Mountain.\n\nWanted Their Own Water Works\n\nPrevious to the introduction of the water from Pottsville the Port Carbon borough council had discussed the establishment of its own water works,. Dr. George W. Brown, a member of the borough council was an ardent advocate of this plan. He conducted what was called Brown’s farm and on this land, in what is Schoentown, were a number of never failing springs of pure water. The plan advocated was for the borough to secure possession of these springs and erect a dam in the valley just below, or south of what was called Peddler’s Bridge. This plan would have provided an ample supply for the borough for years to come, the greater part of the town lying in such a position that the water could have been supplied by gravity, while pumping would have been necessary for but a very small portion.\n\nWhile Dr. Brown urged this plan upon the borough, his fellow councilmen balked at the first expense, but there were confident folk who thought that had his plan been adopted, the borough would have derived a nice revenue from its water works.\n\nAbout 1906 in the same valley, but a considerable distance below where Dr. Brown proposed to erect his dam, the later Father Joseph J. O’Connell, then priest at St. Stephen’s Catholic church, built a swimming pool for the boys of Port Carbon. He bore every expense and the youth of town, as well as the older generation, were provided with a bathing place supplied with clean and health giving water, and at a point removed from the gaze of passers-by. This pool was kept up until Father O’Connell was transferred to Bethlehem, since which time the dam breast has been partly washed away and the remainder is falling to decay. During the summer seasons, hundreds visited the place to take a swim and Father O’Connell say to it that the best order always prevailed and that none entered into danger.\n\nEight Bridges in Borough\n\nThe long bridge which spanned the Schuylkill Valley railroad and the Schuylkill River between Palo Alto and Port Carbon, and which the electric railway crossed to enter the latter borough was first erected in 1872. This bridge stood until some time in the late 90’s when a more modern structure was erected, the old bridge having been declared unsafe for the heavy traffic. This was a county bridge, although the railway company exercised supervision over that part spanning its tracks. When the bridge was first erected a vast amount of filling in was necessary at the Port Carbon end, and the high embankment required many car loads of material to bring it to the proper level. Previous to this bridge being erected, the one at the Franklin Iron Works on Mill Street was the only means of communication between the two boroughs. Port Carbon had earned the reputation for being a borough of bridges, there being eight (two pedestrian) within the borough spanning Mill Creek and the Schuylkill river. In the 1910s five of those bridges were iron structures.\n\nSOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF PORT CARBON\n\nSocial Halls of the Borough\n\nThe two leading halls in the borough were the Odd Fellows’ at First and Washington streets and E.B.A. hall at Coal and Pike Streets, the latter building having been erected by the Emerald Beneficial Association in 1896. While the latter was under construction and the framework had been partly completed, a tornado passed through the borough late one night, and leveled the structure to the ground. This misfortune proved of considerable loss to the contractor. The EBA Hall was soon after rebuilt but was again destroyed, this time by fire on January 11th, 1919. This fire destroyed many of the nearby structures as well. This hall served the community as a meeting place, saloon and for entertainment as basketball games were played there in the 1910s.\n\nOdd Fellows’ Hall, which stood at the northwest corner of Cherry and Washington Streets was formerly known as Citizens’ Hall. The building was originally a schoolhouse, but when the new school building was erected near North and Pine Street, it was abandoned and purchased by the late Geo. W. Wintersteen. In 1872 the Citizens’ Hall Association was organized as a stock company, its capital stock being $600. The shares were sold among private individuals and the Knights of Pythias and Odd Fellows’ lodges. Later this association purchased the school building from Mr. Wintersteen, and tore down the building to the basement floor. On this foundation the association erected a two-story frame structure, including an auditorium on the first floor. The basement was fitted up as a living room for the janitor. This venture never proved very profitable although at first small dividends were paid, but in later years the association barely met expenses. About 1904, Schuylkill Lodge No, 27, I.O.F. which was a heavy stockholder, purchased the hall.\n\nUpon securing control the Odd Fellows at once began making a number of improvements to both the lodge room and the main auditorium, as well as the basement in which was installed a reading and pool room for the Three Link Club. A kitchen with everything necessary for holding a banquet was also installed a new entrance opened at the eastern end leading directly to the stairway running to the lodge room. Other improvements were also made making it one of the most convenient halls in the smaller boroughs of the county.\n\nThe Odd Fellows Association eventually merged with other local lodges and the ownership of the building changed hands several times during the 20th Century. In the 1920s, a Movie Theatre was opened in the ground floor of this building. The Ritz Theater operated up until the 1950s. In the 1960s this building was converted into a textiles manufacturing operation and was used in that capacity until the building was destroyed by fire in the evening of February 24th 1974. At the time of the fire, the building was operated as Angela Sportswear, and it is believed that an act of arson led to this historic building’s destruction.\n\nIn the earlier days there were other fraternal and civic halls in the town, one on the third floor of the Gane building, which stood at Coal and Pike streets.\n\nLodges of Port Carbon\n\nOne of the oldest lodges in Port Carbon is Schuylkill Lodge No. 27, I.O.O.F. At a very early period a lodge of this order was organized in the town, but after several reverses it forfeited its charter. The original Schuylkill Lodge was instituted in June 1836. The first officers were: N.G., Isaac Holden; V.G. Abraham Pott; secretary, Edward H. Hancock; assistant secretary, James H. Holden; treasurer, John C. Flanagan,. This lodge for a time was successful but early in 1844 reverses again came and in June of that year the charter was again surrendered. Two years later, on September 14, 1846, the charter was again restored, the lodge reopened. The officers chosen at the second restoration were: N.G. Joseph Snyder; V.G., Daniel Hillegas; secretary, Lewis Heilner, assistant secretary, Nathan Strause; treasurer, Samuel Seligman. While the lodge had its reverses it maintained its existence and in 1914 had a membership of 199 in good standing and a large list of Past Grands. The first meeting place was in a room in the building owned by John C. McKenna, on Coal St. Later the lodge secured stock in Citizens’ Hall as is discussed earlier.\n\nKnights of Pythias\n\nIn 1868 Golden Rule Lodge No. 43, Knights of Pythias, was instituted in Port Carbon, with thirteen charter members. The lodge for a time met with success, and at one time had fair membership. Its first officers were: V/P/. Jacob Wentz; W.C. Isaiah Cartwright; V.P. , Wm. H. Fry; R.S., Wm. D Dresher; F.S. Wm. B. Kane; W.B. Jeremiah Seitzinger; G. , Emanuel Templin; I.S., Banks Bowe; A.S.. A/. Morgan. Its first meeting place was in Gane’s Hall, Coal and Pike Sts., but in 1873, having secured an interest in Citizens’ Hall the meeting place was changed. The lodge moved along until late in the 1902 when interest in it began to lag, the older members died off and little effort was made to secure new members. Later the charter was surrendered and Isaiah Cartwright was named to wind up the affairs of the organization.\n\nTemperance Division Organized\n\nPort Carbon’s earlier residents always took an interest in temperance and as early as 1846 a division of the Sons of Temperance was instituted in the town. The division at one time had a good size membership and accomplished a good service. In the 70’s interest in the organization began to lag and in 1877 it was disbanded. The Ross Bull and Daniel Wintersteen were leading exponents of the temperance cause.\n\nAncient Order of Hibernians\n\nThe Ancient Order of Hibernians was organized in Port Carbon initially in the late 1860s. The local AOH was made up of Irish Americans from the Port Carbon and Palo Alto vicinity and met at a number of places locally including at Condon’s Saloon which was located on the corner of East Washington and Main Street, where a bar has been operated for as long as most Port Carbon residents can remember. This original organization was disbanded in 1875 when the Roman Catholic Church and public pressure forced the repeal of the charters for AOH Divisions in Schuylkill and Carbon Counties. This repeal of charters was directly related to the activities of the noted Molly Maguires who were reportedly members of the AOH and who were bent on revenge toward the coal companies, the police and harsh mine bosses during the 1860s and 1870s. The AOH reorganized in Port Carbon in the 1880s once the furor of the Molly Maguire era had subsided. In Port Carbon the AOH remained active well into the 1920s, but because of reduced numbers in membership the local Division ceased to exist. Local A.O.H. members belong to the John F. Kennedy Division AOH headquartered in Pottsville.\n\nPort Carbon Rotary\n\nOn February 18, 1947, the Port Carbon Rotary was organized when the first meeting was held at the H.L. Miller Cafeteria. Present at that first meeting, Henry R. Konrad, Townsend Minier, James Powers, Carl J. Weigand, Chester Cooper, Adam Polcrack, John Miller, Robert Rowland. Admitted during the first month of the organization were Harry Cooley, Kenneth Reynolds, Arthur R. Klinger, Arthur W. Wilkinson, Harold Bensinger, Martin Peelman, Stewart Schradley, George W. Bensinger, Edward J. Donahue, James M. Kirk, Clarence Morgan, Allan Simpson, Edward B. DeWitt and John Mattis. Rotary International issued the charter on April 23, 1947 and Silver Creek Rotary of New Philadelphia sponsored the club.\n\nThe first officers of the club were: President: Konrad, Vice President: Minier, Secretary: Powers, Treasurer: Weigand, Sergeant at Arms: Cooper and Directors: John Miller, Rev. Adam Polcrack and Robert Rowland. Weekly meetings were scheduled for Tuesdays, 6:15 p.m. at the H.L. Miller Cafeteria. Meetings were later held at the Port Carbon Legion, Longo’s Restaurant, Pine View Acres and the Port Carbon Banquet Hall.\n\nThe organization sponsored a “Rotary Anns” organization in 1965 when Ralph “Jim” Reynolds served as president. At that time, women were not permitted in the Rotary Club. The Rotary-Anns assisted in the success of the club and held their meetings regularly as luncheons at the homes of members. Today, women are welcomed into the Rotary organization and are a vital part of the group.\n\nFor more than fifty years, Port Carbon Rotary compiled an enviable record of achievement and has been active in every phase of community betterment. Port Carbon Rotary’s participation has touched the lives of many. In the 1950’s, club members erected a band shell at the Miller Playground. In addition to the band shell, the club supported the Citizens Committee, which opened the concession stand at the playground and sponsors the annual Fourth of July Baby Parade. Members also worked to build a picnic pavilion at the playground. In 1966, the Port Carbon Rotary worked to restore the Soldiers Memorial on Monument Hill. A re-dedication service was held as part of the annual Fourth of July festivities that same year.\n\nMany Rotarians served on Port Carbon Borough Council, and when funds were scarce in the 1950’s, they refused their salary so that it could be put to “better use.” Members played a significant role in getting free home delivery of mail, securing a doctor for the town and protecting our school children. In the early 1980s, the club purchased 6 headphones/tape recorders for use at the Port Carbon Library and held a Bike-a-thon to raise money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n\nGirl Scout troops and little league teams receive the support of the Port Carbon Rotary. In recent years, the club addressed drug awareness through baseball clinics by the Reading Phillies. And every year, the club awards prizes for best Christmas lighted houses in Port Carbon, Palo Alto and Mechanicsville. In the spring, the club sponsors an Easter Egg Hunt for the children. Port Carbon Rotary assists in promoting community drives, the ambulance, the American Red Cross and the distribution of food baskets for the needy. To raise funds for charities and projects, Port Carbon Rotary hosted “A Night at the Races” events, Antique Car Shows and community “Block Parties”.\n\nThe Port Carbon Rotary established a program to recognize outstanding scholarship in the community. Essay contests were sponsored in the past, and during the school year, seniors at Pottsville Area High School and Nativity B.V.M. are invited to weekly meetings as student guests and honored for academic achievement. Annually, the Club presents a scholarship to a deserving graduate from the Port Carbon/Palo Alto area.\n\nThe Port Carbon Rotary Club actively serves its community. Rotarians from diverse professions regularly gather together, enjoying fellowship and exploring additional ways to improve the community. For more than half a century, this Club has dedicated itself to the motto of Rotary International — “Service Above Self” — and will be guided by that principle as it begins the Twenty-First century.\n\nThe Schools\n\nAbraham Pott built the first schoolhouse erected in Port Carbon, as previously stated in what is now the center of the Lutheran Church Cemetery. Christopher Young taught in this the first school in 1829. In 1838 a school was built on what was the site of the Odd Fellows Hall on Washington Street. This school was used up until the erection of a three-story structure, with six rooms in 1870. This structure stood in what was the playground of the former Elementary School (now an apartment complex fronting on Cherry Street). In the 1840s, Dr. Brown established a private school for his children of several other people in town. This school was located on the present site of the Goodwill Fire Company Parking lot on Washington Street.\n\nAmong some of the old teachers who taught in the old hall building were a Mr. Rossiter, Mr. Dimmick, Mr. Orlando Tiffany, Miss Phoebe Heebner, Jesse Newlin and Miss Robinson, who later became the wife of the late Joseph H. Beir. Miss Robinson came to Pottsville from Milton and for a time attended the Pottsville Academy when she was elected a teacher at Port Carbon, being the first woman teacher elected in the town.\n\nThat school building erected in 1870, cost $17,000. On this site, Jeremiah Boone, in 1844 opened a large lumberyard, which covered the school lot and also that occupied by the residence erected by the late Jesse Newlin, for a number of years county superintendent. Mr. Boone, and his son Thomas, conducted this yard for a number of years, until shortly before the school district purchased the site. Messrs. Buechley and Philip Steinbach were the contractors who put up the building. All the lumber used in the structure was cut in the forest near Brockton, up the Schuylkill Valley, and the logs hauled down on trucks to the Charles Baber saw and planing mill, where it was fashioned into window and door frames and other building material.\n\nFirst School Principal\n\nThe first principal of the new building was the late George W. Weiss, who held that position until 1877, when he was elected County Superintendent, succeeding the late Jesse Newlin. The succeeding principals in the first 40 years were: Jacob H. Major, whose descendants still reside in Port Carbon and environs, H.H. Brownmiller, of Orwigsburg; Charles Moyer also formerly of Orwigsburg; Geo. W. Channell, and M.E. Stein. The schools of the borough were always maintained at a high standard and occupied a prominent place in the county’s educational system.\n\nA New School for the 20th Century\n\nThe 1870 school building had served its purpose for more than 40 years when the citizens of Port Carbon determined to build a new schoolhouse. One of the problems cited with the old school was that the very narrow staircase was viewed as a fire hazard. In 1915 the school was replaced by a more modern structure complete with thirteen class rooms, a library, gymnasium, lavatories, a dispensary, store room, clock tower and classroom space for the elementary grades. With the consolidation of the school districts in and around Pottsville, the utility of this school was reduced. By 1970, only grades Kindergarten through fourth grades attended school here while the older students were bused to Pottsville. One of the fond memories of the older boys who attended Port Carbon Elementary School in those latter years, was the ringing of the bell marking the time for the opening of school or to signal the end of recess. The access to the bell tower was found on the second floor classroom facing Pine Street. This building served as the Elementary School until the Pottsville Area School District consolidated all elementary schools at the John S. Clarke Elementary School in Pottsville on January 4th, 1982. The school was converted into an apartment building in the 1980s.\n\nPort Carbon High School\n\nSoldiers Memorial High School was constructed in 1931 on Cherry Street adjacent to the elementary school. In June of 1932, the first senior class graduated in Port Carbon. Prior to this, the students went to Port Carbon for three years and finished their final year at Pottsville High School. The Port Carbon high school featured a library, principal’s office, auditorium, girls and boy’s locker room, health room, a laboratory and seven classrooms.\n\nFor many years, Port Carbon High School boasted of a number of popular and successful sports teams specifically in basketball and to a lesser degree, baseball. These sports teams were for the most part coached by Tabby Howells, a popular schoolteacher in the Port Carbon School district. The Port Carbon High School served the community for 24 years, until the Port Carbon School Board agreed to make the move toward jointure, or the consolidation of small community school districts. The P.C.H.S. Class of 1955 was the last of the graduating classes wholly from Port Carbon public school. The trend begun with the high school ended in 1982 when, with the opening of John S. Clarke Elementary School in Pottsville, all of the public school age children attended classes in Pottsville instead of their hometown.\n\nPort Carbon Library\n\nThe first Port Carbon Library was organized in 1941 in the former borough jail located on Washington Street. The library operated here for several years until it was relocated in the Port Carbon Elementary School on the first floor facing Pine Street. From here it was moved to the other end of the school with its entrance on Cherry Street near Washington. The Library was finally reorganized at its present location in (YEAR????) in the former Dewitt’s Hardware Store on Pike Street between Pine and Coal.\n\nSt. Stephen’s Catholic Church and Parochial School\n\nThis church was organized as a mission about 1840, and remained as such until 1847, being supplied with pastors from St. Patrick’s Church, Pottsville. Saint Stephen’s Parish was established July 17th, 1847 by Bishop, now Saint John Neuman. The parish at that time consisted of Port Carbon, much of Palo Alto, Lower Mill Creek, part of Upper Mill Creek, Belmont, Bear Ridge, Eagle Hill, Cumbola, New Philadelphia, Silver Creek, Middleport and a number of coal mining villages in between. The first priest stationed at the church was Rev. Daniel Magorian, who came to Port Carbon in 1847.\n\nThe church building is greatly due to the voluntary labor of its older members, who gave their efforts free of cost in order to have a place of worship. It was erected about 1847. Later a stone dwelling house adjoining the church on the west was purchased as a residence for the priest and was first occupied by Father Magorian. Father Magorian was a well known figure about town in the earlier days, being an exceedingly large man and generally using a one horse gig in making his visits to his parishioners in the parish.\n\nThe original cemetery stood on the site next to the original Mission House. One of the first things Father Magorian did, was buy land for a cemetery at the eastern end of Coal Street. At that time the early burials were removed to the new cemetery between Coal and First Streets. Father Magorian was pastor of the church until 1877, when on account of age, he was succeeded by Rev. J.C. McEnroe. Father Magorian came to Port Carbon from Milton and spent his remaining days there, being buried in the old cemetery. Following Father McEnroe came Father O’Rouke, who was succeeded by Father Moran.\n\nFather Moran made many improvements to the church property. In 1886, with the assistance of the Sisters Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, he established the parochial school of the parish, erecting a fine new and commodious building adjoining the early parochial residence. With the establishment of the parochial school a home was necessary for the teachers. Under Father Moran’s pastorate a new parochial residence was erected. Ignatius Knowles erected the residence.\n\nFollowing Father Moran came Father McGovern. During Father O’Connell’s pastorate, many improvements were made to the church property, including the installation of the stained glass windows in 1901. Father O’Connell was responsible for the construction of a new four room school building which was expanded in later years. He also purchased the land and laid out the new cemetery, just east of the original plot.\n\nFather O’ Connell was one of the prime movers in the erection of the soldiers’ monument on Monument Hill.\n\nFather O’Connell was followed in the pastorate by Father Joseph Whitaker, Rev. Msgr. Charles Kavanaugh, and Father Daniel Daly. Father Daly continued to add classrooms to the school in 1920 and a few years later, had expanded the facilities into a high school.\n\nFather Bernard Farley and Father Joseph Herley succeeded Father Daly in the pastorate. And during Father Farley’s time, Saint Stephens Celebrated its 100th Anniversary in Port Carbon. Father John McNamara, became the Pastor in 1964 and since that time has made a number of improvements to the church and the school.\n\nMethodist Church\n\nAs early as 1836 the residents of Port Carbon who had previously affiliated with the Methodist denomination organized a class. This met at the home of the late Daniel Wintersteen, on Valley St., whose daughter, Delila, became an active member. In 1844, Rev. J.C. Thomas organized the first congregation. The records show that among the organizers were Ross Bull, Tobias H. Wintersteen, David Oliver, Wm. Berger, Jos. Burnham, Jos. H. Beir, Daniel Oliver, James Buery, Robert Jackson, Joseph Thomas, Wm. Sims, John Sims, David J. Myers, and John Headley together with their wives. Previous to the organization the class also met at various homes of members and were occasionally supplied by ministers from Pottsville. A Sunday school was also organized the same year as the congregation, the first superintendent having been David Oliver. The late Ross Bull was also for a long time superintendent, as well as class leader and director of the choir. The present superintendent is Ambrose Stevens. The first church building was erected at the corner of Pike and Washington Sts. In 1845 and was dedicated a year later. This was a stone structure and served until 1869, when it was ton down and the present brick structure erected. Many able pastors have served the congregation, which today is prosperous and has a large Sunday school and an able choir, of which Wm. H. Garis is the director. The present pastor is the Rev. J.L. Guernsey (1914-1916).\n\nGrace United Evangelical Church\n\nWhat is now called Grace United Evangelical church, the house of worship being located on Pike St., near Market, sprung from a class of that denomination, a man named Philip Dreher being the class leader. Meetings were held at the homes of the members when there was occasional preaching by visiting preachers. In 1848 the Rev. John Neitz organized the first congregation, which for a time worshipped in a hall used by the Odd Fellows, in the McKenna building on Coal St. A Sunday school was also organized a year later John Medlar being the first superintendent. Among the members at the organization were Mr. and Mrs. Obadiah Reed, Mr. and Mrs. Philip May., Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Knittle, Mr. and Mrs. Philip Dreher, Mr. and Mrs. John Medlar, Mr. and Mrs. Philip Hoover and others. The first church erected was a wooden structure at the junction of Washington and First streets. The building contacted an auditorium and a basement in which the Sunday school held its sessions. The congregation moved along successfully and peaceably until the memorable split in the Evangelical Association between the Dubs and the Esher factions. With three exceptions the Port Carbon congregation cast its lot with the Dubs faction. The exceptions were Obadiah Reed, Daniel Knittle and Solomon Hertzog, now all deceased. The church property at that time was deeded to the local congregation—that is, the deed the church held so read. Finally the question of which faction was entitled to hold possession of the church property got into the courts and the Esherites won title to the Port Carbon property. The Dubs faction, however, was not dismayed, but determined to maintain an organization. Rev. I. Max Longsdorf was at that time pastor of the Port Carbon congregation and remained with it during the ensuing struggle.\n\nLutheran\n\nWhat is today known as St. Paul’s Lutheran Church, located on Coal St. was organized in 1840 as New Jerusalem church, by members of the Lutheran and Reformed denominations, later becoming known as St. Paul’s Lutheran and Reformed church.\n\nPrevious to the organization, Messrs. Pott, Swift, and Patterson of Pottsville, dedicated a plot of ground to the citizens of Port Carbon for a public school site and graveyard. This plot consisted of what is now the old section of the burying ground. The citizens not accepting the school plot, Mr. Pott secured sole control of the grant and at his own expense erected a school building. This structure was located in the center of the cemetery beyond the site where the steps lead up to where the third church building stood until 1929. The Lutherans and Reformed congregations purchased the original building and adjoining land the year they organized, and dedicated it to Christian worship. Rev. William G. Mennig was the first Lutheran pastor and Rev. David Hassinger the first Reformed pastor.\n\nAs the town’s population grew and the church membership increased, a new church building became necessary, and on October 5, 1851, the cornerstone of a second church building was laid facing onto Coal Street opposite Apple Alley, the first building being later torn down. This second building was dedicated in 1853. the plot dedicated as a burying ground filling up, the two congregations in 1863 purchased additional ground from Mr. Pott for burial purposes.\n\nIn 1875 the Lutheran and Reformed Congregations separated into two congregations, the Reformed membership disposing of all their interests in the property to the Lutheran congregation.. The first Lutheran pastor after the separation was Rev. Mr. Singmaster.\n\nIn 1892 the Lutheran congregation withdrew from the East Pennsylvania Synod and united with the General Lutheran Conference. The first pastor under the new allegiance was Rev. Geo. M. Brock, who assumed the pastorate in 1892, remaining until the latter part of 1893. The second pastor was Rev. Mr. Becker, and in June 1895, Rev. Charles W. Eberwein assumed the pastorate.\n\nRev. Mr. Eberwein rapidly increased the membership, had a number of improvements made to the graveyard and in 1898 the third church edifice was erected. Under the pastorate of Rev. Eberwein a handsome parsonage was erected on Coal Street. The congregation under Pastor Eberwein outgrew its house of worship on North Coal Street and purchased a large lot on Coal St., near Pike and Cherry where the present church was built in 1928-1929. The present church was dedicated on April 27th, 1930 with Pastor Charles Eberwein presiding. In 1940, the Henry L. Miller Family donated the funds for the Carollonic Bells which were installed in the Bell Tower. After the passing of Pastor Eberwein, Pastor Adam Polcrack served the congregation for more than 20 years. Pastor Polcrack was followed by Rev. Carl Borger, who became the Pastor of Saint Paul’s Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1966. Pastor Borger served St. Paul’s for 26 years, retiring in 1992.\n\nPresbyterian\n\nThe Presbyterian congregation of Port Carbon was organized on August 7, 1833, by the adoption of a constitution and the election of a board of trustees. This board was composed of Jesse Turner, William Bosbyshell, Abraham Heebner, James Lime, Lawrence Whitney, George Hadesty, Henry Porter, E.S. Warner and Nathaniel Davis. The church building at the corner of First and Grand Sts., was erected in 1834, a stone structure, which was later weather boarded and painted white, a color it has retained to the present. The first elders were E.S. Warne, Henry Foster and J.J. Foster. The cemetery adjoining the church was established in 1833.\n\nThe first pastor was Rev. Sylvanus Haight, who filed the pulpit two years. In 1836 Rev. W. Sellers assumed the pastorate, he being followed by Rev. Robert McCartee, who remained until 1849. During the following year several pastors served the congregation. In 1850 Rev. T.H. Wardlaw was chosen to the pulpit, he being followed by Rev. A.M. Lowrey. From 1853 until 1877 Rev. Silas A. Davenport occupied the pulpit. He was followed in 1878 by Rev. S. Henry Bell, who served until 1882,. Rev. J.P.McCaskie came next. Rev. Archie A. Murphy was next chosen pastor and served until 1890. Rev. Henry Tolsin followed and remained until 1893. In 1894 Rev. James W. Boal succeeded to the pulpit remaining until 1904, when owing to ill health, he resigned, Rev. Henry C. Sperbeck was next chosen and remained until "
