        "text": "CHRIS UHLMANN: Well taking up on what Tony Blair just said. As Iraq is shattered by yet another conflict it's worth reviewing its recent history.\n\nThe United States stopped short of invading Iraq in the early 1990s after driving out the forces of Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.\n\nBut in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks the United States claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that were a security threat.\n\nIt invaded in 2003, toppled the dictator and spent seven years trying to stabilise the country.\n\nAustralia lent its support in both the first and second Gulf Wars.\n\nMajor General John Cantwell was deployed to both. And in 2006 he was director of strategic operations with the multi-national forces in Iraq.\n\nWelcome to AM.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: Thanks very much, Chris.\n\nCHRIS UHLMANN: John Cantwell, is it reasonable for people now to ask whether toppling Saddam Hussein was in the long run, one of the most misguided military expeditions in history?\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: It's certainly a legitimate question, and it was interesting to hear Tony Blair quickly brushing over that issue and asking us all to focus on the current events on the future, which I would if I was him.\n\nHe was one of the leaders that led us down that very, very bad pathway where we knocked over a government and a country on the basis of very poor intelligence and political blinkers, and led to a terrible and extended and very, very deadly war. You have to ask why did we do that, given the current circumstances.\n\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Just looking at one of the things that Tony Blair has said. He said \"We underestimated about Iraq, Afghanistan and the whole of the region, was that once we removed the dictatorship then out comes this tribal, ethnic and, above all, religious tension\". Why would you not have seen that at the outset?\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: I don't know the answer to that and I wish that our political leaders had had that foresight. It now seems so obvious that the... Even if you accept for a moment that the weapons of mass destruction threat was real - and we now know that was completely false - it begs the question why didn't they understand the importance of these tribal and religious lines that guide so much of what goes on in that part of the world.\n\nAnd you have to ask the question, if we had just left Iraq alone would Saddam Hussein still be there, would he have lasted, what would have changed that was in anyway comparable to the violence and death that has followed the invasion?\n\nCHRIS UHLMANN: And sectarian tension is shot through that region's entire history.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: It is of course and everything about this is on the sectarian lines, and this is the major problem in Iraq at the moment. The Iraqi government is Shia-led, Shia-biased and in the Sunni population - the minority population of Iraq - feel quite legitimately that they've been persecuted and held back and denied opportunities. And there's no wonder that organisations like ISIS are able to inflame the Sunni component of that country in the north and the other parts of the country and take advantage of that in these recent advances.\n\nCHRIS UHLMANN: And one of the things that strategic thinkers should have known about when you topple a strong man, and the most recent example before Iraq would have been Yugoslavia, is that you leave a power vacuum and into that power vacuum stepped Iran.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: Well Iran has always had a great interest in what goes on across the border. Iran of course is now a strong ally of the Shia-dominated Maliki government and are already talking about assisting, as they would describe it, by providing advisors and even troops.\n\nThey've always interfered in what's going on in Iraq. They did so from the mid-2000s and were a constant problem for the coalition in that time. And they will be just loving this. It provides an opportunity for them to meddle further in the affairs across the border in Iraq.\n\nCHRIS UHLMANN: And the Gulf states, which were our allies in the first and second Gulf wars, are funding these Sunni extremists?\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: Well that appears to be the case. Much of this money though is coming- that directly supports the ISIS fighters is coming straight from Syria where they've gained so much of their experience, their heavy weaponry and the like have all come from Syria.\n\nSo that's the major concern. The other player in all of this is within Iraq and that's the Kurds, who are also likely to benefit from this terrible situation in a way that they've been wanting for years and years. We may well see the permanent arrangement of a separate Kurdish state, which will inflame the Turks. So the ramifications for this are quite, quite wide.\n\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Apart from the search for weapons of mass destruction, one of the key ideas that was driving the war in Iraq, was that it was against terror. Now al-Qaeda didn't exist in Iraq before 2003, now the most extreme of the extremists exist there.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: Yes, another irony of the whole business. Had- As I said, had Iraq been left to its devices, al-Qaeda would not have flourished in the way it did. We may well have had to fight them somewhere else, who can say, but it is, it's just a tragedy from start to finish and we are seeing yet another unfolding of that tragedy.\n\nI believe that this will eventually be resolved in the near weeks, but we won't see Iraq collapse, but what we are likely to see is a hardening of the hatreds and the distrust between Sunnis and Shia.\n\nWe'll see an advancement of Kurdish interests to the detriment of the unity of the country and the rest of the region will continue to meddle and then fund and upset the organisations that support their own interests in Iraq.\n\nIt's a very, very ugly scene.\n\nCHRIS UHLMANN: And what do you make now of calls that the US go back and that Australia perhaps support them?\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: I think it would be absolute folly for Australia to go back into Iraq. And I'd be very surprised if the US seriously gets involved. The worry if they do employ air strikes, which they may be tempted to do if the situation worsens, is that would probably be perceived by the Sunnis as further evidence of them being suppressed by a government that's backed by the West - a Shia government backed by the west.\n\nIt would produce other long term and unforeseen consequences and if we've learned nothing from Iraq, it is that we cannot take short sighted action without thinking it through in detail and at great length and a further intervention now I think would be a very big mistake.\n\nCHRIS UHLMANN: And finally, the greatest irony of course is if the United States was to go in and fight there it would be fighting on the side of Iran.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: Well, it may well find itself in a coalition of ideas and intentions with Iran, which would be very bizarre indeed. Although the US has been trying to build a rapprochement with Iran - and maybe this is one way of doing it but goodness, it's an ugly and brutal way to do it. The best thing would be to just stay out of it.\n\nCHRIS UHLMANN: Major General John Cantwell, thank you.\n\nJOHN CANTWELL: You're most welcome."
