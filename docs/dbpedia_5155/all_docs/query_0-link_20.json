        "text": "Ford Madox Ford's great novel The Good Soldier begins: ''This is the saddest story I have ever heard.'' Major-General John Cantwell's own story of a good soldier runs it close. You get to the end of this memoir of his fighting days and you hope, you pray, you twitch for the man revealed.\n\nCantwell has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder since 1991, when he saw active service in Iraq during the Gulf War. In relative historical terms, that war was a cakewalk; the Iraqi army collapsed and was butchered. But Cantwell, on secondment to the British Army, and out in no-man's land, felt extreme fear and supped full of horrors. All his life since then he has been haunted by the vision of a hand sticking up out of the sand of an Iraqi soldier who had been buried alive.\n\nBeyond that, however - and this kind of compulsion seems to have been an abiding reflex of Cantwell's - he went out of his way to confront the appalling. His vehicle comes across a destroyed Iraqi tank and the dismembered remains of its crew. Cantwell walks across and, out of the sight of the two young Englishmen who are his own crew, he seeks out and fits up and lays down the separated heads with the appropriate, mutilated torsos. There is something sacramental about this. But we also ask: ''Was it a good idea?''\n\nLater, in Afghanistan, Cantwell is wholly understanding of a young Australian soldier who tearfully pleads he cannot help in gathering the body parts of a comrade who has just been blown to bits by an improvised explosive device.\n\nExit Wounds is a first-class military memoir - vivid, generous in its tributes to comrades and allies, unsparing in its depiction of the face, and the arse, of battle. What, however, becomes most intriguing are several unasked, unanswered questions. Without a trace of self-promotion, Cantwell emerges as a most compassionate, hard-working military commander. Yet he doesn't ask what it is about himself that he can't leave his horrors well enough alone. He comes back from Iraq in 1991 afflicted with depression and nightmares. He is a sick man, though neither properly diagnosed nor treated. He has the PTSD sufferer's greatest support - an understanding and endlessly patient partner - but he is desperate to go back to war, and he badgers his superiors to let him go to Baghdad in 2006 and to Afghanistan in 2010. He must know he is inevitably heaping more fuel on his horrors, and he duly comes back more of a wreck each time.\n\nSignificantly, his account of his tour in Afghanistan dispenses with the accounts of the administration, the liaisons and so on that occupy many of the pages on 1991 and 2006. His account of that last experience is simply a series of chapters devoted to the death, or deaths, of young Australians under his command, and therefore under his care. He speaks to each dead young soldier in his coffin. Guilt and remorse are piled upon nightmare and depression.\n\nWhy this compulsion? Professional ambition might be part of it. A sense of duty another. But there seems something more intrinsic to Cantwell's pathology. He enjoys - he takes huge satisfaction from - other jobs in the army, but something in him craves putting his hand into the flame again.\n\nThe other insistent question is how a man with such a debilitating, barely treated anxiety condition can continue to function efficiently. How could he progress within 15 years from major to major-general while prey to such a storm of nightmare, sleeplessness and depression? But we don't go there. Probably, we need someone other than Cantwell to tell us that.\n\nNor - and rightly so - does Cantwell go beyond his own experience and extrapolate about other professionals whose business is dealing with the butchery of human flesh by assorted metal objects. But any half-conscious reader asks how police and ambulance and emergency workers, through the long repetitions of a career, can live with what they witness and handle.\n\nThis is a valuable book, and a limited number of books are valuable in this way. A reader wakes up with a start to the fearful price some people pay for the continuing care and protection of the rest of us. As for putting those people in harm's way lightly and unadvisedly â€¦ just don't go there.\n\nGerard Windsor is the author of All Day Long the Noise of Battle: An Australian Attack in Vietnam.\n\nEXIT WOUNDS\n\nMajor-General John Cantwell, with Greg Bearup"
