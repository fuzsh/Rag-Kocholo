        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nSEATTLE, Sept. 18 — Even as Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington has faced frequent criticism for having voted for the war in Iraq, her re-election campaign appears to be benefiting from a cold dose of pragmatism among many of her fellow Democrats.\n\nAfter looking east to Connecticut, where another supporter of the war, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, lost the Democratic primary last month, many Democrats here say attacking Ms. Cantwell in Tuesday’s primary seems flat-out foolish because it could benefit the well-financed Republican challenger in November.\n\n“Those people were looking for a reason to vote for her anyway,” said Hong Tran, an antiwar advocate running against Ms. Cantwell who has stayed in the primary race despite polling in the low single digits and raising about $40,000.\n\nCathy Allen, a longtime Democratic consultant here who is not involved directly in the race, said, “If anything, what you would succeed in is poking yourself in the eye.”\n\nAfter all, unlike in Connecticut, the question here is not whether another Democrat will unseat Ms. Cantwell. Instead, the wild card is whether antiwar opponents will peel away enough support to leave her vulnerable to the Republican opponent, Mike McGavick, a former insurance executive who recently put $2 million of his own money into his campaign.\n\nWith a practical eye on that very different political reality, Ms. Cantwell and many of her antiwar critics have moved closer to each other, and the senator’s lead over Mr. McGavick has increased to double digits in some polls.\n\nIf the primary in Connecticut proved the power of the war issue among Democrats, it has not necessarily been a template for other prominent races in which Democrats have been criticized for their war stance.\n\n“People are not saying ‘Throw the bums out’ in these other races,” said James H. Dean, chairman of Democracy for America, the national coalition that played a crucial role in Ned Lamont’s victory in the Connecticut primary.\n\n“In Connecticut,” Mr. Dean said, “we didn’t have to worry about a Republican becoming a senator.”\n\nMr. Lamont had voter demographics, liberal bloggers and a strong grass-roots operation on his side. And he had money, putting $4 million of his own into his campaign.\n\nHere in Washington, the two most prominent antiwar candidates still running against Ms. Cantwell are polling in the low single digits and have little money. One, Aaron Dixon, is a former Black Panther who is running as the Green Party nominee in the general election in November on an antiwar platform. The other is Ms. Tran, a lawyer for a nonprofit organization who said that if she lost she would vote for Ms. Cantwell.\n\nMs. Cantwell, who was first elected in 2000 by just 2,229 votes, has strong union support and has won praise from environmentalists for helping to fight oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nWith Washington’s history of close elections, both national parties consider the race critical and plan to spend time and money here this fall.\n\nThe war is far from the only campaign issue. Democrats and outside analysts say Mr. McGavick has stumbled in discussing events in his past, while some Republicans say Ms. Cantwell has had a recent rise in the polls largely because she ran new television advertisements when Mr. McGavick was off the air.\n\nMs. Cantwell had $5.1 million in her campaign account at the end of August, compared with about $2.8 million for Mr. McGavick, including his own money.\n\nThe first lady, Barbara Bush, campaigned over the summer for Mr. McGavick, as have Republicans including Senators Bill Frist of Tennessee and John McCain of Arizona. Former President Bill Clinton and other Democrats have campaigned on behalf of Ms. Cantwell.\n\nAsked whether Ms. Cantwell had changed her position on the war, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said: “No, I think people have become more familiar with her position. And unlike Joe Lieberman, she has not been afraid to criticize the president on the war.”\n\nStill, Ms. Cantwell has made a clear effort to offset antiwar opposition.\n\n“ ‘Do you really want a Republican representing Washington?’ That’s the question she’s asking,” said Chad Lupkes, a Washington coordinator for Democracy for America.\n\nIn July, Ms. Cantwell hired two of her potential Democratic primary challengers, both critics of the war, to work on her campaign. The move drew charges from both sides that she was paying off opponents; one of those hired, Mark Wilson, is paid $8,000 a month. The other person hired was Dal LaMagna.\n\nMr. Wilson, now a Cantwell campaign outreach director, did not respond to a request for an interview. Mr. Lupkes said Mr. Wilson was far from a sellout. He said it had been “critical” for Mr. Wilson to join the Cantwell campaign.\n\n“The progressives really want to learn how the system works,” Mr. Lupkes said. “You’ve got a bunch of people who say that the war is their top, only issue. Those people are fools. They’re going to vote for Aaron Dixon. Maybe 5 percent of the vote goes for him?”\n\nMs. Cantwell has made other overtures to antiwar voters. On Aug. 9, the day after Mr. Lamont won in Connecticut, she was among many Democrats nationwide who congratulated the new nominee. Six days after that, she released a statement on her campaign blog about her initial vote in favor of authorizing the war in Iraq: “If I knew then everything that I know today and the Republican leadership still brought it up for a vote, I would have voted no.”\n\nThe comments echoed those of other Democrats in Washington who voted for the war, but for Ms. Cantwell they were new.\n\nMichael Meehan, her campaign strategist, said the comments did not reflect a shift in her position. Rather than playing “a hypothetical game of looking backwards,” Mr. Meehan said, the senator “thinks it was more important to say, ‘How are you going to hold them accountable now?’ ”\n\nMs. Cantwell, in a brief interview after attending a Labor Day picnic with union members in Chehalis, about 85 miles southwest of Seattle, said her position on the war had not changed this year but that campaigning during the August break had helped her clarify her stance with voters.\n\nShe said she supported a Senate resolution in November calling for 2006 to be a “period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty.” She backed a Democratic plan in June calling for troops to start coming home this year. And in July, she sponsored a measure with Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware that said no permanent American military bases would be established in Iraq.\n\nMr. McGavick, who has largely echoed Ms. Cantwell’s views on the war, has been on the defensive himself recently.\n\nLast month, his voluntary acknowledgment that he had been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol in Maryland more than a decade ago backfired somewhat after The Herald of Everett, Wash., reported that he had not disclosed all the details of the arrest. The newspaper reported that Mr. McGavick had also run a red light, had been handcuffed and had fallen asleep at the police station.\n\n“I fully disclosed everything I remembered, period,” Mr. McGavick said in an interview.\n\nMr. McGavick and Ms. Cantwell disagree on several national issues. Mr. McGavick has accused the senator of helping kill a Senate bill that would have increased the federal minimum wage, while Ms. Cantwell has said the bill would have cut incomes for workers who earn tips. Mr. McGavick supports letting some workers invest in voluntary private accounts as part of Social Security, an idea Ms. Cantwell opposes.\n\nRepublicans have portrayed Ms. Cantwell as a tax-and-spend liberal, while Democrats have cast him as a cheerleader for President Bush.\n\nBeyond specific policy differences, Mr. McGavick said his campaign was centered on “the need for civility and the need for common sense and problem solving.”\n\n“That’s what has gotten me this far,” he said, “and that’s what will carry me on to victory.”\n\nHe acknowledged that dissent among Democrats could help him. “They’re not going to take votes from me,” he said.\n\nMs. Cantwell drew criticism from Republicans, too, after The Associated Press reported that she once lent $15,000 to $50,000 to Ron Dotzauer, a lobbyist and political consultant, and later helped steer federal money to his clients. The senator’s staff has said there is no connection between the loan and the federal spending.\n\nBut with the senator and some of her antiwar critics now appearing less divided, said Mark A. Smith, an associate professor of political science at the University of Washington, Mr. McGavick may need to sharpen his message.\n\n“I think he’s almost hoping for self-immolation on the Democratic side,” Mr. Smith said. “That seemed like a pretty decent strategy three or four months ago. I don’t think that looks like such a decent strategy now.”"
