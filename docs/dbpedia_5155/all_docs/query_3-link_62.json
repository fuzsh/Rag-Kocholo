        "text": "Maria Cantwell (born October 13, 1958, Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.) is an American politician who was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 2000 and began representing Washington the following year. She previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives (1993–95).\n\nCantwell was born in Indianapolis, the daughter of a construction worker who was active in politics. With the help of Pell Grants, she attended Miami University of Ohio, where she earned a bachelor’s degree (1980) in public administration. She was the first member of her family to graduate from college. Cantwell briefly studied at the university’s branch in Luxembourg before returning to Ohio to work on the gubernatorial campaign of former Cincinnati mayor and television personality Jerry Springer. Following Springer’s defeat, she moved to Seattle to work on Sen. Alan Cranston’s unsuccessful 1984 presidential bid.\n\nCantwell then worked in public relations before running for the Washington state House of Representatives in 1986. She won a seat and was reelected, serving from 1987 until 1993. In 1992 she successfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives, taking office the following year. She served a single term before being defeated in a reelection bid in 1994. In the aftermath, Cantwell worked for a Seattle-based Internet company, Progressive Networks (later RealNetworks), serving as vice president for consumer products. In 2000 she mounted a campaign against longtime U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton and unseated him by the narrowest of margins, winning 48.7 percent of the vote against Gorton’s 48.6 percent. She entered the Senate in 2001."
