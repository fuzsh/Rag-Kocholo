Although I wasn’t physically dragged to the bus that I caught in a small Eastern Washington town, it was painful in other ways. I recall my mom crying for hours and unwilling to accompany me to the bus to Spokane. Oh yes, I had choices: Go to Canada or go to jail.\n\nI went from Spokane to California and then back to Fort Lewis for combat training for Vietnam. We were all draftees, and I was assigned the position of squad leader. To this day I don’t know why. Not only was I responsible for my life but for the lives of my squad. Off we went to war in September 1966.\n\nAfter a week in combat, I asked myself why we were in another people’s land, killing mothers, fathers, grandparents and, worst of all, children. I have never been able to justify that. To this day that haunts me. So, my focus of the war changed from “killing the enemy” to getting my squad and myself home in one piece. Unfortunately, that never happened.\n\nWhen my year was up, I flew to California, was issued brand-new uniforms and put on a plane to Seattle. Upon arrival, my parents, two sisters and their husbands greeted me at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Hugs and tears flowed. We drove to my sister’s home in Renton for the night before returning home to my small Eastern Washington town. My nephew, in his teens, greeted me and asked, “How many did you kill?” I had to walk outside to regain my composure. I never answered his question.\n\nHere we are 55 years later. A lot has happened over the years. I never see the casualty numbers in the media. I guess the 58,000 American soldiers killed in the war plus some 1,626 still missing don’t mean much today. Nor do the estimated 2 million Vietnamese civilians, or the 275,000 to 310,000 Cambodians or 20,000 to 62,000 Laotians. Always wondered how they celebrate veterans day in those countries.\n\nYes, I am a bitter old man, one who has never shared my experiences in Vietnam with anyone, including my family. No one wins wars. Times were different in Iraq and Afghanistan, as the U.S. soldiers were volunteers. But the results were the same. No one won. Were those wars worth it?\n\nSo come Nov. 11, I may be thanked for my service. To this day I don’t know how to respond. Probably nod my head and walk away.\n\nDenny Wagenman\n\nMilitary service: The ghosts of Vietnam\n\nNov. 18, 2022\n\nThe Seattle Times\n\nBy John Humnicky, Woodinville\n\nI read the guest essay by Denny Wagenman about his reluctance to be “proud” of his tour in Vietnam in 1966. I share the same feelings about this war as Wagenman. Although my “conscripted” tour in Vietnam wasn’t until 1971, I asked the same questions that Wagenman outlined in his essay. Why were we in another people’s country killing fathers, mothers, grandparents and children? Apparently, nothing much changed between 1966 and 1971. There were no heroics, no charges of the light brigade and no obvious displays of valor or sacrifice. All there seemed to be was an attitude of making it out alive and in one piece.\n\nNow, 52 years later, I still dwell upon these questions. I do not feel “proud” of what we accomplished in Vietnam. When I came home through Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, I was jeered at, yelled at and spat at for being a “baby killer.” When people thank me today for my service, I’m like Wagenman: I nod and walk away.\n\nJohn Humnicky, Woodinville\n\n41 Senate Republicans Voted Against Veterans' Healthcare\n\nJuly 2022\n\nA bill aimed at protecting veterans exposed to toxic materials during their service was shut down yesterday in the Senate, in a 55 to 42 vote that failed to meet the 60-vote threshold necessary to advance the legislation.\n\nThe new legislation would expand care to 3.5 million veterans who were exposed to burn pits, adding 23 toxic and burn pit exposure-related illnesses to the VA database.\n\nThe bill would also expand support for Vietnam-era veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange in places like American Samoa, Cambodia, Guam, Johnston Atoll, Laos and Thailand.\n\nWhat's killing Staff Sergeant Wesley Black?\n\nThe VA doesn't want to talk about it\n\nThe unseen toll of traumatic brain injuries\n\nVietnamese children and the effects of Agent Orange\n\nWasn't just the Veterans that had a knife shoved in their backs and twisted around.\n\nYep, still wondering why I bother to go church; I truly want to understand how any mainline churches can support these grubbers, they are nothing to be proud of or write home about.\n\nThese are the 41 Republican Senators who voted against the bill:\n\nMitch McConnell & Rand Paul, Kentucky ; Jim Inhofe & James Lankford, Oklahoma; John A. Barrasso & Cynthia Lummis, Wyoming; Marsha Blackburn & Bill Hagerty, Tennessee; Roy Blunt & Josh Hawley, Missouri; Mike Crapo & Jim Risch, Idaho; Mike Braun & Todd Young, Indiana; Richard Burr & Thom Tillis, North Carolina; Bill Cassidy & John Neely Kennedy, Louisiana; Deb Fischer & Ben Sasse, Nebraska; John Cornyn & Ted Cruz, Texas; Cindy Hyde-Smith & Roger Wicker, Mississippi; Mike Rounds & John Thune, South Dakota; Richard Shelby & Tommy Tuberville, Alabama; Mike Lee & Mitt Romney, Utah; Tom Cotton, Arkansas; Kevin Cramer, North Dakota; Steve Daines, Montana; Joni Ernst, Iowa; Ron Johnson, Wisconsin; Roger Marshall, Kansas; Rob Portman, Ohio; Rick Scott, Florida; Tim Scott, South Carolina; Dan Sullivan, Alaska; Patrick Toomey, Pennsylvania\n\nJon Stewart, the former talk show host who's become a high-profile veterans advocate, lambasted the Republican senators in a furious, expletive-laden speech.\n\nStewart noted at one point that the lawmakers being addressed were likely indoors enjoying air conditioning, ignoring the veterans — at least one of whom was wearing an oxygen tube — braving the scorching heat for over an hour to try to make their point.\n\n\"You don't support the troops,\" he said. \"You support the war machine.\"\n\nThis site accepts no outside money and has been online since 2004.\n\nIf you run across an ad getting to this site do not open;\n\nThere are no sanctioned ads on this site\n\nSite contains over 400 articles and runs over 4000 pages.\n\nHave been questioning the wisdom of running up these kinds of debts,\n\ndeficits and interest payments dating back to the spring of 1992.\n\nIf you have questions may this site help some in your search for answers.\n\nEditor: Insanity Rules.org"
