        "text": "by Sheldon Rocha Leal\n\nOn the 16th of August Madonna Veronica Louise Ciccone, better known by her first name, turned 65. Although her birthday is not one of the milestones people usually celebrate (50s, 60s, 70s etc), the year 2023 is very significant in the history of the singer and Pop music in general, as she celebrates 40 years in the business. It has been a tumultuous year for a woman considered a pioneer in modern Popular music and culture. An entertainer who has opened up the doors for many aspiring recording artists and has broken down barriers for people aspiring to break into the industry. The year started off with an appearance at the Grammy Awards and much fanfare surrounding the announcement of her first world tour since 2020. “The Celebration Tour” would be a retrospective of her 40 year career, featuring a promotional video with some of her influential friends like Lil’ Wayne, Diplo, Jack Black and Amy Schumer.\n\nTicket sales for the show were healthy and additional dates were added for a total of 78 shows. Furthermore, Madonna released recordings with The Weeknd, Sam Smith and Christine and The Queens. “Popular” with The Weeknd and Playboi Carti from the “The Idol” television series was well received, but “Vulgar” with Sam Smith received a lukewarm reception. Auditions and rehearsals for the show commenced with many progress videos posted on social media. One month prior to the commencement of the tour Madonna was hospitalised with a serious bacterial infection, placing her in ICU for five days, resulting in the postponement of the North American leg of the show. Madonna seems to be on the mend, with pictures of the singer published earlier this month, saw her celebrating her birthday in Lisbon with her family.\n\nIn recent years Madonna has come under attack by some in the media and on social platforms. These attacks include body shaming, ageist and misogynistic statements, with some saying the singer has lost her touch and is no longer relevant in the new music dispensation. The truth is Madonna is just doing what she has always done. She is a pioneer, maverick and über disruptor and all that she has done in recent years is totally on brand. The Queen of Pop has never answered to anyone or stood down when she feels that she is doing the right thing. She has been criticised by the Catholic Church, members of the Hindu faith, Islam and Judaism and been banned on many platforms for challenging boundaries.\n\nBut what has made the singer, who in her own words in the “In Bed With Madonna” documentary conveyed that she does not consider herself the best singer or dancer, one of the greatest recording artists of all time? The start of her career gave no indication of the trajectory of her eventual success as she was not an instant success. Her first and second singles “Everybody” and “Burning Up” did not even chart on the mainstream chart and at best placed at No3 on the US dance charts. Her third single “Holiday” placed at No16 on the Billboard Hot 100, but took pole position on the US Dance charts. It was only on her 4th attempt, “Lucky Star”, that she managed to crack the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. There would be only one other single release from her debut album, “Borderline”, which peaked at No10.\n\nWith the release of her sophomore album, “Like A Virgin”, in 1984 we started getting an idea of the qualities that would eventually result in the New York singer being hailed The Queen of Pop. Madonna‘s brand is a convergence of Fashion, Photography, Art, Theatre, Cinema, Music and social commentary. On the “Like A Virgin” album we see Madonna experimenting with a Marilyn Monroe persona on the “Material Girl” music video, with a scene inspired from the 1953 movie “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes”. The title track challenges gender norms, with the singer tackling a topic a woman wouldn’t have broached in a song in the 1980s, virginity. This James Dean(esque), “Rebel Without A Cause” persona resulted in mass popular culture appeal and cemented Madonna’s status as an industry icon.\n\nThe Madonna brand has always been clearly carefully considered, researched and put together. No detail is overlooked and although Warner Bros. initially prevented her from exploring the full extent of her creativity and art, this soon changed, resulting in many controversies along the way. Madonna emerged in the 1980s out of a community of artists that did what she does to this day. They were a congregation of creatives that all hung together and drew inspiration from each other, which is always what happens when creators gather. Madonna brushed shoulders with Andy Warhol, Keith Harring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, members of The Factory crowd. Part of this crew included designers, musicians, actors, models, artists, photographers and celebrities. People like David Bowie, Betsey Johnson, Jerry Hall, Halston, Liza Minnelli, Edie Sedgwick and Mick Jagger.\n\nOver the years Madonna has sought out influences from various spheres of the art world, including cinematic masterpieces. For her performance of “Keep It Together”, inspired by the Funk band Sly And The Family Stone, on the “Blond Ambition World Tour” (1990), she referenced the 1971 Stanley Kubrick movie “A Clockwork Orange”. Three years later on her “Girl Show World Tour” (1993) for her performance of “Like A Virgin” she channeled Marlene Dietrich’s performance of “Falling In Love Again (Can’t Help It)” from the 1930 movie “Der Blaue Engel”. Her 1990 “Justify My Love” music video was inspired by the 1963 Jacques Demy directed movie “Bay Of Angels” and “Express Yourself” (1989) channeled the iconic 1927 silent movie “Metropolis”. Two of the music videos from the “Erotica” album, “Deeper & Deeper” and the title track, were inspired by movies created by Andy Warhol at The Factory. In “Deeper & Deeper” Madonna even channels Warhol’s muse Edie Sedgwick.\n\nFor her 1998 releases Madonna drew inspiration from “The English Patient” (1996) directed by Anthony Minghella for the “Frozen” music video and “Koyaanisqatsi” (1982) directed by Godfrey Reggio for the “Ray Of Light” short film. “The Power of Good-Bye”, from the same era, drew inspiration from two movies, “The Thomas Crown Affair” (1968) directed by Norman Jewison and “Humoresque” (1946) directed by Jean Negulesco. In “Nothing Really Matters” (1998) Madonna sought inspiration from a book released in 1997, “Memoirs of a Geisha”. Finally for the “Turn Up The Radio” music video, released in 2012, inspiration was derived from the “Nights of Cambria” (1957) directed by Federico Fellini.\n\nBesides referencing the cinematic world in her projects, she has also be involved in various movie productions, acting in 27 movies and directing two. Although critics have slated her performances, she has worked with some of the industry’s greatest players. In 1986 she co-started with her then husband Sean Penn in a movie titled “Shanghai Surprise”, produced by former Beatle George Harrison and featuring music by Michael Kamen. “Bloodhounds of Broadway” (1989) saw Madonna take a role next to Randy Quaid, Matt Dillon and Jennifer Grey. In “Dick Tracy” (1990) the diva basically played herself in a remake of the famous comic book, featuring performances by Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Dick Van Dyke, James Caan and William Forsythe. The roles kept on coming in and in 1992 Madonna appeared in the Penny Marshall directed biopic “A League of their Own”, featuring performances by Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Rosie O’Donnell.\n\nIn 1993 “Body Of Evidence” was released which saw Madonna perform next to Willem Defoe, Joe Mantegna and Julianne Moore. This was followed by a minor role in a Spike Lee directed movie titled “Girl 6”. Her next role is probably her most critically acclaimed, “Evita”. Her Golden Globe winning performance was directed by Alan Parker, with music written by Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sir Tim Rice. Performers included Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce and Jimmy Nail. In “The Next Best Thing” (2000) the Queen of Pop appeared next to Rupert Everett, Benjamin Bratt, Neil Patrick Harris and Lynn Redgrave. Madonna finally got to be a Bond Girl in 2002 in the 20th instalment of the series in the movie titled “Die Another Day”, which featured Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry, John Cleese and Dame Judy Dench. She then tried her hand at directing and producing movies and released two productions, “Filth and Wisdom” (2008) and “W.E” (2011).\n\nMadonna is a trained dancer and even received a scholarship to study dance at the University of Michigan. She eventually dropped out of university and moved to New York, studying under the iconic choreographer Martha Graham. The Queen of Pop went on to pay tribute to her former dance teacher in the “Medellín” (2019) music video. Dance has, therefore, always been an important part of the Material Girl’s brand. In one of Madonna’s most successful hits, “Vogue” (1990), she pays tribute to a famous dance form which derived from the LGBT community in the New York “House Ball” scene. The video was choreographed by Vogueing masters José Gutierez Xtravaganza and Luis Xtravaganza.\n\nIn the 2005 “Hung Up” music video the Queen pays tribute to dance forms popularised in “Saturday Night Fever” (1977), “Grease” (1978) and “Perfect” (1985). Although not a dance form, in 2006’s “Jump” video Madonna drew inspiration from a form of martial arts called “parkour” and even featured one of its masters in the music video, Sébastien Foucan. Other dance greats that have inspired the singer have been cited and mentioned in songs like “Vogue” and “Hollywood” (2003): Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Mae West, Jean Harlow (although the latter two are not known as dancers). She even wore Mae West’s 25 carat ring and bracelet featured in the 1928 film “She Done Him Wrong” in the “Hollywood” music video.\n\nIn the “Like A Prayer” music video Madonna wears a slip dress original designed for the actress Natalie Wood as an undergarment. For Madonna’s “Girlie Show World Tour” (1993) she employed the services of the legendary dancer Gene Kelly as a choreographer. Furthermore, Madonna has worked with some of the greatest choreographers of our time on her various shows: Jamies King, Sébastien Ramirez, Vincent Paterson, Megan Lawson, Alex Magno, Jamal Sims and Laurieann Gibson. A show nowadays can consist of up to 25 choreographers, as in the “Sticky & Sweet World Tour” each dealing with different aspects of dance (tap, Latin, boxing, martial arts, Hip-Hop etc…). This excludes that dance cast, which can number a similar total, as in the 2012 “MDNA World Tour”.\n\nAs someone from the Factory Scene and a person Andy Warhol called his daughter, Madonna’s visual aesthetic has always been very strong and the Art world has made a major impact on that image. The Material Girl is an avid art collector owning art by some of history’s greatest artists including Frida Kahlo, Pablo Picasso, Marilyn Minter, Salvador Dali, Damien Hirst, Tamara de Lempicka and Ferdinand Léger. In 2015 her art collection was valued at over $100million and is considered by Artnet a blue-chip collection. She has also initiated various art projects including the “X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS” instillation with iconic photographer Steven Klein in 2003, as well as the “Art For Freedom” project in 2013. The highly controversial “Sex” coffee table book, released in 1992, which inspired the “Erotica” album, was a project with another legendary photographer, Steven Meisel.\n\nIn a quest to sanitise her image after the fall out of the “Erotica” era, Madonna released the “Bedtime Stories” album in 1994. The video for the title track was inspired by female Surrealist artists including Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo and even Frida Kahlo. Her album covers have additionally been photographed by some of the world’s greatest photographers. This includes album cover artwork by Herb Ritts for “True Blue” (1986) and “Like A Prayer” (1989), Patrick Demarchelier for “Bedtime Stories” (1994), Mario Testino for “Ray Of Light”(1997) and Jean Baptiste Modino for “Music” (2000). The 14th century Polish artwork “The Black Madonna of Częstochowa” inspired the “Hard Candy” album cover in 2008. Finally, Mert and Marcus were responsible for the “MDNA” (2012) as well as the “The Rebel Heart” (2015) album covers.\n\nMadonna has always been closely associated with the fashion world. Jean Paul Gaultier, Donatella and Gianni Versace and Dolce & Gabbana were and are close friends of the singer, including her in various marketing and advertising campaigns. In 2008 Steven Meisel shot the Queen of Pop for the Louis Vuitton 2009 Spring/Summer collection, followed by a collection of sunglasses she designed for Dolce & Gabbana in 2010. She has been Anna Wintour’s guest at eight Met Gala evenings and is one of the most featured celebrities on the cover of Vogue. Another of Madonna’s famous fashion designer friends is Stella McCartney, who designed her wedding dress when she got married to the famous British movie director Guy Ritchie in 2000. It does without saying that someone with as much fashion clout as Madonna cannot go on tour with costumes designed by just anybody.\n\nJean Paul Gaultier designed costumes for Madonna’s “Blond Ambitions” (1990), “Confessions” (2006), and “MDNA” (2012) world tours. Dolce & Gabbana designed the 1993 “Girlie Show World Tour” wardrobe as well as some looks for the “Sticky & Sweet Tour” (2008). Since 2006’s “Drowned World Tour” famous constumer Arianne Phillips has been involved in every Madonna show barring “Madam X” (2019). Stella McCartney provided looks for two Madonna shows, “The Re-Invention” (2004) and “Sticky & Sweet” tours and so did Jeremy Scott who worked on the latter and the “MDNA Tour”. Karl Lagerfeld, working for Chanel, designed some of the looks for “The Re-Invention Tour”, whilst Alexander Wang provided pieces for the “MDNA” and “Rebel Heart” (2015) tours.\n\nMiu Miu were involved in the “Sticky & Sweet” and “Rebel Heart” tours, whilst Riccardo Tisci, working for Givenchy, provided costumes for the former tour. Lastly Gucci, Prada, Moschino and Swarovski contributed costumes and accessories for the “Rebel Heart Tour”. Designer label involvement extends to her album cover looks as well as music videos. Versace provided the look for the Madonna compilation album “Something To Remember” (1995). For the 2008 music video “Give It 2 Me” Madonna sported outfits by Chanel and Roberto Cavalli, whilst featuring the future creative director of Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams. In the “Give Me All Your Luvin’” (2012) music video she rocked looks by Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana, Yves Saint Laurent and Prada. Designs by Christian Dior and Givenchy featured in her “Living For Love” (2014) music video and Balmain dressed Madonna for the “Turn Up The Radio” music video in 2012.\n\nThe Madonna sound has evolved over the years, from early Punk/Disco, to 1950s Rock ‘n Roll, Gospel, R&B, Pop, Rock, Folk, Country, Hip-Hop, Funk, Neo-Soul and Electronica. In recent years she has also explored World Music sounds, as heard on the 2019 “Madam X” album. In order to achieve this diversity of sound she has worked with some of the top producers/songwriters in the world, and collaborated with some of the world’s greatest talent. In the 1980s she worked with the Disco legend Nile Rogers of Chic on her sophomore album release “Like A Virgin” (1984). On the “Like A Prayer” (1989) album she collaborated with Prince and Richard Marx made an appearance on her “True Blue” album in 1986. On the latter album Michael Jackson collaborator Siedah Garrett made appareances as a backing vocalist on 5 of the 9 tracks. In the late 1990s and going into the 2000s she worked with some of the world’s greatest electronic music producers including William Orbit, Mirwais, Martin Solveig, Diplo, Avicii and Stuart Price.\n\nHer links to the urban music world have always been a mainstay. It’s where she started her career and where she seems most comfortable. She has worked with some of the Hip-Hop world’s greatest talent including Timbaland, Kanye West, Missy Elliot, Chance The Rapper, Nicky Minaj, MIA, Lil’ Wayne, The Neptunes and Pharrell Williams, Swae Lee, Quavo and Cardi B. For her “Bedtime Stories” album she worked with power R&B producers Babyface, Dallas Austin, Nellee Hooper and Dave Hall and even featured a song written by the Icelandic trip-hop artist Björk. The Gospel music legend Andraé Crouch was featured and arranged the choir on the “Like A Prayer” (1989) single and in 2015 Alicia Keys appeared on the “Rebel Heart” album. Lenny Kravitz co-wrote and featured on her 1990 No1 hit “Justify My Love”. Justin Timberlake featured on her “Hard Candy” album in 2008 and she featured on Ricky Martin’s 1999 album “Ricky Martin”. Additionally she has collaborated with Dua Lipa, Maluma, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Massive Attack, Britney Spears and Saucy Santana.\n\nThrough it all Madonna has not shied away from difficult topics or challenging the status quo. In “Material Girl” (1985) she spoke about materiality and in “Papa Don’t Preach” (1986) abortion was the tackled theme. “Like A Prayer” speaks about concepts of racism and integration, while “Express Yourself” saw Madonna pushing the feminist agenda, which she has done various times. “Erotica” (1992) was about sexual liberation and women taking control of their sexuality. In the “Secret” (1994) music video Madonna once again explores racial harmony and in “Human Nature” sexual liberation. Celebrity culture and obsession are tackled in “Drowned World/Substitute for Love” (1998) and “Hollywood” (2003).\n\n“American Life” (2003) controversially criticised George W Bush’s invasion of Iraq and in the “Music” (2000) video Madonna reverses the role of women in society, as a gender that also has agency. Furthermore, Madonna tackled the scourge of the AIDS pandemic and LGBTQA+ rights on her tracks “Why’s It So Hard” and “In This Life”, both from the “Erotica” album. Religion is a popular topic in Madonna songs and she has offended a few faiths over the years including Catholics with the “Like A Prayer” album and the Hindu nation with a track on the “Ray of Light” (1998) album. She has used religious iconography extensively in her music and aesthetic and this has been problematic. With the song “The Beast Within” (1990), which is a remix of “Justify My Love”, she attacks Saddam Hussein and the Jewish nation were offended with some seemingly anti-Semitic language in the remix. For her efforts Madonna claims to have been excommunicated by the Catholic Church on three occasions.\n\nMadonna and her contemporaries pushed the boundaries of what was deemed acceptable, enabling generations that came after them to be liberated and “Express” themselves in the manner in which they saw fit. For this she along with her cohort received major backlash and criticism. But without a Madonna there would be no Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera. There would certainly be no space in the business for artists like Sam Smith, Saucy Santana, Troye Sivan or Kim Petras, who are doing what Madonna did in the 1980s, but with less scrutiny and criticism. The Madonna brand is supported with an interrogation of and reference to various art forms, as illustrated above, dance, photography, fashion, art and diverse musical and cinematic influences, whilst considering the world view.\n\nTo this day she is still combating systemic norms and challenging society’s experience and conception of what a person and artist can do, with the same level of criticism she received at the beginning of her career. Although not popular right now, these are seeds that she is sewing that may not germinate for decades, just as she did in the 1980s and 1990s. Viewing Troye Sivan’s 2023 “Rush” music video, this was made abundantly clear to me. A video of this nature, produced by Madonna in the late 1980s or 1990s, such as “Erotica”, “Justify My Love” or “Like A Prayer”, would have been banned and vilified, yet Troye’s video has barely raised an eyebrow. It’s an indication of how Madonna, with her cultivated brand and sound has moved popular culture forward and contributed to making society a place that embraces a plethora of tastes and vantage points. Here’s to another 40 years in the business…Madonna The Great."
