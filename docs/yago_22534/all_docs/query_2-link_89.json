This series attempts to untangle his web of deception to find out how and why he wreaked havoc over so many people’s lives.\n\nEpisode one begins in his home town, Northwich, where Sirin meets some of his earliest victims - Andrea Yuile, Amber and Amy Bailey. They tell Sirin how he infiltrated their lives and talk about the horrendous fallout of what he did."
