        "text": "Gracie Abrams has just added her name to summer 2024’s stacked music slate. Amid incoming new music from Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, and more, the young singer-songwriter has announced her new album called The Secret of Us, arriving in June.\n\nThe album follows up her acclaimed 2023 debut Good Riddance, which skyrocketed her to Gen Z fame thanks to her astute, intimate songwriting, bolstered by the soft-pop production of The National’s Aaron Dessner. Since then, she opened for Taylor Swift (who made her own contribution to Abrams’ new record), embarked on her own world-wide romp, and has clearly been busy working on new music all the while — and thankfully, we won’t have to wait too long for to hear it. Below, read on for everything we know so far about the project.\n\nWhat is Gracie Abrams’ new album called & when is it out?\n\nAbrams’ sophomore record will be called The Secret of Us, and arrive June 21.\n\nWhat songs will be on the album?\n\nAbrams released lead single “Risk” on May 1. The yearning, brisk guitar track arrived with an intimate music video directed by her best friend and collaborator, Audrey Hobert.\n\nSee the album’s full tracklist, which includes a feature from Taylor Swift, below.\n\nFelt Good About You\n\nRisk\n\nBlowing Smoke\n\nI Love You, I’m Sorry\n\nus (feat. Taylor Swift)\n\nLet It Happen\n\nTough Love\n\nI Knew It, I Know You\n\nGave You I Gave You I\n\nNormal Thing\n\nGood Luck Charlie\n\nFree Now\n\nClose To You\n\nWho did she work with for the album?\n\nLike her excellent debut Good Riddance, the upcoming album was largely created with The National’s Aaron Dessner, who “produced the sh*t out of it,” according to the singer.\n\nTaylor Swift is also on the record as its sole feature (not coincidentally, she and Abrams have Dessner as an overlapping collaborator). The pop star will guest on “us,” the fifth track of the record — which all Swifties will know is a meaningful (and devastating) number.\n\nWhat are the themes of the record?\n\nBased off the broken-hearted lyrics available online for the unreleased songs Abrams have already performed live, it seems The Secret of Us will be another collection of lovelorn tracks traversing themes of unrequited love, missed connections, and breakups.\n\nThat being said, Abrams said she had “real, true fun writing this album” with the “occasional tears” — which we’re taking to mean happy-but-sad bops are incoming."
