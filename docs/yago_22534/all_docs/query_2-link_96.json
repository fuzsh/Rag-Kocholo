        "text": "The idea came from a member of Parton's team, who suggested a song vault could be an engaging marketing tool for Dollywood's DreamMore Resort. The team member asked that she create a song specifically for the occasion, Taste of Country reported.\n\n\"It would be a song that will never be heard until 30 years from the time we opened the resort. They said, 'You'll be long dead,'\" Parton wrote, referring to her team members.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, maybe not. I'll be 99. I've seen people live to be older than that,\" she added. \"So I wrote this song, and I can't say what it is.\"\n\nThe song, which was recorded onto a CD, was nestled into a chestnut wood box built by her Uncle Bill. The locked box contains a CD player inside and currently sits behind a glass display case.\n\nParton was told to keep the song a secret and that the box couldn't be opened until 2045, Taste of Country reported.\n\n\"That's like burying one of my kids, putting it on ice or something, and I won't be around to see it brought back to life,\" wrote Parton.\n\n\"It's just burning me up inside that I have to leave it in there. Hopefully, it will play and the whole thing ain't rotted,\" added Parton, who is the godmother of Miley Cyrus.\n\nRelated stories\n\nParton noted that the request was odd given the extended wait, but said she'd do everything in her power to be there.\n\n\"Anyway, it's kind of weird or strange that they would ask me to write this mystery song,\" she adds. \"I don't know if I want to live to be 100 or not. But you never know. I might, and if I do, I'm going to be at that opening,\" wrote Parton.\n\nParton, whose marriage to Carl Dean has lasted 54 years, has made a reputation for being a masterful singer and artist.\n\nHer songs \"Jolene\" and \"9 to 5\" emerged as country classics, while her songwriting skills helped create the legendary ballad, \"And I Will Always Love You.\"\n\nHer latest movie, \"Christmas on the Square,\" debuted on Netflix in November."
