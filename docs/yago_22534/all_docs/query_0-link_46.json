You know I'm buying this disc for the live CD, too\n\nThat's the only reason i'm buying this set, someone burned me the documentry on dvd so i've already seen it.\n\nI didn't find the documentry that interesting, aside from a few moments. The live footage had really bad editing too, nothing as professional as Truth or Dare.\n\nVC, you're going to be pressing that stop button 3 minutes through the movie when she starts discussing god with Stuart.\n\njayaredee\n\nDavidEye said:\n\nShe's finally releasing the \"American Life\" video (Director's Cut).Better late than never,huh?\n\nJayardee...have you seen the Director's Cut of that video? It's really intense!\n\nYes i've seen it, and I think it really drives a point home. Had she released the video back in 2003 it probably would have been banned from MTV as usual so pulling it didn't really make much the difference.\n\nThe video really makes my stomach turn.\n\nAnd i really thought the video was a done deal, i never expected it to be released.\n\nDavidEye\n\njayaredee said:\n\nDavidEye said:\n\nShe's finally releasing the \"American Life\" video (Director's Cut).Better late than never,huh?\n\nJayardee...have you seen the Director's Cut of that video?

And what the hell is \"I Love New York\" doing in there? Maybe that is a way of slipping it in to remind people of COADF, which this has nothing to do with. This seems like a good set of stuff, but probably should have been released before COADF. This might just kill any momentuem COADF had, although \"Get Together\" is supposed to be released the same day. Maybe people will pick up this CD/DVD along with \"Get Together\"?\n\nVinnyM27\n\njayaredee said:\n\nDavidEye said:\n\nShe's finally releasing the \"American Life\" video (Director's Cut).Better late than never,huh?\n\nJayardee...have you seen the Director's Cut of that video?

I still wish she would have done something better than the flag hag video she ended up releasing.\n\nVinnyM27\n\nDavidEye said:\n\njayaredee said:\n\nYes i've seen it, and I think it really drives a point home.

I was confused by the listing of Hollywood as a \"remix\" - I assume that means she did a remix of it live?\n\nit was a dub version of the Jacques Lu Count mix that was done on the tour as a video montage featuring Tarot Cards and the Dancers... Madonna was changing costumes\n\nYou CANNOT use the name of God, or religion, to justify acts of violence, to hurt, to hate, to discriminate- Madonna\n\nauthentic power is service- Pope Francis"
