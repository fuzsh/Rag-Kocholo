        "text": "The first rule is Trust yourself. You have to dig deep, deep down and ask yourself who do you want to be. Not what, but who. I’m not talking about what your parents or teachers may want you to be but figuring out who you want to be. Figure out what makes you happy, no matter how crazy it may sound to the other people. Rule number one is trust yourself no matter what anyone else thinks;\n\nAnd rule number two is Break the rules. We have so many rules in life about everything I say break the rules. Not the law, but the rules. It is impossible to be a maverick or a true original if you are too well behaved to ever break the rules. You have to think outside of the box, that is what I believe. After all, what is the point of being on this Earth if all you want to do is be liked by everyone and avoid trouble? The only way that I ever got anyplace is to break some of the rules;\n\nWhich of course brings me to rule number three: Don’t be afraid to fail. Anything I have ever attempted, I was always willing to fail. No, you can’t always win, but don’t be afraid of making decisions. You can’t be paralyzed by fear of failure or you will never push yourself. You keep pushing because you believe in yourself and in your vision, and you know it is the right thing to do. Success will come, so don’t be afraid to fail;\n\nWhich brings me to rule number four which is Don’t listen to the nay-sayers. I mean, how many times have you heard that ‘you can’t do this,’ or ‘you can’t do that’ if it’s never been done before? I love it when someone says that no one has ever done this before because when I do it, that means that I’m the first one that has done it. So pay no attention to the people who say ‘it can’t be done’. I never listen that you can’t, I always listen to myself and say yes, you can;\n\nThat brings me to rule number 5 which is the most important rule of all: Work your butt off. Live leaving no stone unturned. Muhammad Ali, one of my great heroes, had a great line in the 70′s when he was asked how many sit-ups he did and he said ‘I don’t count my sit-ups I only start counting when it starts hurting. When I feel pain that’s when I start counting, because that’s when it really counts.’ That’s what makes you a champion, that’s the way it is with everything. No pain, no gain, simple. If you’re partying, horsing around, someone out there at the same time is working hard. Someone is getting smarter and someone is winning, just remember that. Now if you want to win, there’s absolutely no way around hard, hard work. None of my rules find success will work unless you do. I’ve always figured that if there is 24 hours in a day, you sleep 6 hours, you have 18 hours left. Now I know that some of you sleep 8 hours or 9 hours well then just sleep faster I would recommend;\n\nThat takes me to rule number six, which is Always give back. Whatever path that you take in your lives you must always find time to give something back. Give something back to your community, to your state, or to your country. Let me tell you something, reaching out and helping people will bring you more satisfaction than anything else you have ever done."
