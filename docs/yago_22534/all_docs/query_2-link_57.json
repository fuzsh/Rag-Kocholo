        "text": "Gracie Abrams‘ new album is a secret no more. That’s because the 24-year-old rising pop star announced Monday (April 29) that her sophomore record, The Secret of Us, is arriving this summer, led by the single “Risk,” which drops later this week.\n\nThe “I Miss You, I’m Sorry” singer broke the news with a post on social media, unveiling the project’s cover — an up-close headshot of Abrams with “The Secret of Us” scrawled in yellow font at the top. “the album that I made with some of my favorite people (!!!!!!!!!!) is yours JUNE 21 and the first single 💛RISK💛 comes out on MAY 1!” she wrote in her caption.\n\n“We had real, true fun writing this album,” Abrams continued, confirming that her frequent collaborator, The National’s Aaron Dessner, produced the LP. “There were also the occasional tears … The music is yours in basically five seconds and we cannot wait. I. Love. You.”\n\nThe announcement comes a little over a year after the songwriter dropped her long-awaited debut album, Good Riddance, which debuted at No. 52 on the Billboard 200. Featuring singles “Block Me Out” and “I Know It Won’t Work,” the project was also produced by Dessner, and the duo later recorded live acoustic performances of tracks on the album together for a special edition vinyl.\n\nThe Secret of Us will also follow a successful run of Eras Tour shows supporting Taylor Swift, a gig Abrams will resume this fall when the “Anti-Hero” singer circles back for a brief second U.S. leg. In November, the “21” artist was nominated for her first Grammy in the best new artist category, which went to Victoria Monét. Shortly afterward, Abrams teamed up with fellow nominee Noah Kahan for a remix of his Stick Season track “Everywhere, Everything,” making her Billboard Hot 100 debut at No. 79.\n\nSee Abrams’ album announcement below."
