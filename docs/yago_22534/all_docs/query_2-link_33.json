        "text": "As someone who’s been an overly dramatic, hopeless romantic for the last 24 years, I’m pretty sure Gracie Abrams just wrote an entire album for me. The rising singer-songwriter officially kicked off sad girl summer this past Friday with the release of her sophomore album, The Secret Of Us, and I am so here for it. Capturing the highs and lows of being just a girl in your early 20s, it feels as though Gracie has taken a peek at my journal, or more accurately, the PowerPoint presentations I make for my therapist. From heartache, to friendship, to the anxiety-inducing feelings of having a crush on someone, she portrays every emotion with her signature vulnerability that resonates with her ever-growing fanbase, myself included.\n\nIt’s been a whirlwind the last couple of years for Gracie Abrams. In 2023 alone, she released her debut full-length record, Good Riddance, headlined a sold out tour, scooped up a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, and opened for Taylor Swift on her blockbuster Eras Tour. On The Secret Of Us, her growth as an artist is clear as day. She completely shuts down critics of her “whisper singing,” and showcases a newfound maturity in her songwriting on top of it. There’s absolutely no filter and that’s what makes it great. It quite literally sounds like the stream of consciousness running through your head while writing in a diary; thoughts straight from your brain to the page, and completely confident in the fact that no one else will ever know this is what you were really thinking. On the lead single, “Risk,” Gracie perfectly describes the, let’s be honest, horrifying feeling you initially have when you develop a crush on someone. “God, I’m actually invested,” is the sinking realization that you like someone, it’s that feeling that brings you back to embarrassing middle school crushes. “Why aren’t you here in my bedroom? / Hopelessly boring without you,” she goes on to sing in the bridge, like you can barely remember what life was like before you started liking this person. Complete with chugging wine and stomping on a birthday cake, the song’s accompanying music video shows Gracie going through the wide range of emotions a new romance can cause—which usually involves briefly losing your mind, something I unfortunately know all too well. Anyone else ever look their crush up on LinkedIn?\n\nDespite Abrams teasing to fans that The Secret Of Us was going to be a happy album, “Risk” is actually one of the only tracks about a new romance. The album opens with “Felt Good About You,” in which she literally says “I felt good about you ’til I didn’t,” so apparently the risk wasn’t worth taking after all. The album has an overarching theme of feeling more invested in someone than they are in you, and the painful emotions that come along with that realization. On “Blowing Smoke” she sings, “Tell mе if she takes you far / Far enough away from all the baggage you’ve been carrying / Up another hill to all the girls who’ll help you bury it,” recounting a lover who will simply move onto someone else instead of owning up to their problematic behavior. She’s brutally honest and cunning. My personal favorite from the track has to be “If she’s got a pulse, she meets your standards now,” because it really is the ultimate f*ck you and I stand by it. These emotions carry over in a more melancholic way on “Gave You I Gave You I,” with Gracie point blank singing, “You got bored and I felt usеd, now I’m all sad about it.” Reminiscent of Taylor Swift’s Red & The Tortured Poets Department, the track explores the emotions that come along with feeling like someone meant more to you than you did to them. And as a lover girl through and through, it definitely cut deep.\n\nWhile “Risk” is a depiction of the excitement of a new romance, “Let It Happen” is the flip side. It’s the angry emotions of thinking, “How dare you make me feel this way?” With lines like “Knowing that you’re probably out somewhere / While I’m in my underwear / Eating through my feelings, I’m still reeling, but it’s fine,” Gracie perfectly captures that feeling of not being able to believe someone could be so blissfully unaware of just how distraught you are by your feelings for them. She understands just how delusional a crush can make you, and honestly it feels great to know someone finally gets me. Abrams is much more animated than on previous albums, and that’s what makes this album so special. Her unfiltered lyricism is refreshing. In another more extroverted track “Tough Love,” Gracie sings about leaving a relationship that’s no longer right for you. It’s sure to be a breakup anthem for heartbroken people around the world. In fact, I’ve already quoted “No chance I waste my twenties on random men / Not one of them is cooler than all my friends” in my daily life. Because sometimes you really need to remind yourself, and others, that no man is ever really worth it.\n\nIf there’s one thing I love, it’s when artists reference their old songs in new ones. When Gracie first teased “I Love You, I’m Sorry,” on her Instagram, I was certain it would be a standout for me. After all, I’ve been listening to “I miss you, I’m sorry” whenever a man has mildly upset me since its release in 2020. However on “I Love You, I’m Sorry” Gracie takes more of a guiltier approach, admitting to some faults of her own. As someone who suffers from main character syndrome, “Trust me, I know it’s always about me” is such a real thing to say.\n\nIn what has quickly become a fan favorite on the album, Gracie collaborated with longtime idol Taylor Swift on their track, “us.” Produced by Aaron Dessner, the track is extremely Evermore-coded, right down to the folk-sounding guitar at the beginning that gives “willow” in the best way possible. Swift’s influence on the track is apparent, especially in the lyrics. There’s only one artist that has me Googling song lyrics, or who Robert Bly was, and that is Ms. Taylor Swift. There are also very few songs that have my jaw literally dropping at first listen, and when their voices seamlessly blend into each other during the bridge? I was truly on the floor. It’s not really surprising there was a fire in Taylor’s apartment while they were writing it, that bridge would have had me distracted too. It’s the collab I’ve always dreamed of but never thought I’d actually get. One of my favorite Track 5s for sure—IYKYK.\n\nAnd speaking of things Gracie stans never thought they’d get to hear, she decided to finally give the people what they want and release “Close To You.” I cannot express just how much I needed this song. I’ve listened to that 2016 teaser more times than I can count, and while I was certain she’d never release it, I’m so glad she did. And after listening to it about 500 times these past couple of weeks, I can’t believe she’s been keeping it from us this long. It’s my “Supercut” for the summer of 2024. It’s the only song I’ve been listening to on my hot girl walks. Having it on full blast isn’t enough, I need it injected into my veins. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a lyric that conveys girlhood just like “I burn for you / And you don’t even know my name.” It captures that euphoric feeling of having a new crush, and as a true delusional girl, I’ve never resonated with a song more.\n\n@pokemonmasterzo\n\nReplying to @gracie abrams POP GIRL SUMMER 2024 #closetoyou #gracieabrams #thesecretofus #fyp\n\n♬ Close To You – Gracie Abrams\n\nIn short, as someone who has quite literally never gotten over a single thing in her entire life, this album is my kryptonite. The vulnerability and realness shines through, and it’s honestly comforting to know that someone else thinks this way. Gracie Abrams is a girl’s girl on the rise, and I can’t wait to see what she has in store for us next.\n\nLike what you saw? Here’s more:"
