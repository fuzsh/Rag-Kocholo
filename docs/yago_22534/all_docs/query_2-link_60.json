        "text": "See thousands of secrets in San Diego at The Museum of Us\n\nDamian and Luis are two of the Visitor Experience Associates who scan your anonymous postcards submitted at the Museum. They shared these thoughts with me about reading your secrets.\n\nYou’ll never know what you’ll get when scanning a secret. From funny and scandalous, to ones about emotional and physical trauma. A child’s secret crush to an adult’s life story or comedy. PostSecret really does make you put into perspective what’s going on with people from all over. We can sympathize, laugh together, and perhaps even see other’s secrets in ourselves or loved ones.\n\n-Damian Sales\n\nThe PostSecret Exhibition here at the ‘Museum of Us’ has visitors from all around the world who come and share their secrets for strangers to read and form a type of connection. I feel a great amount of empathy because I know how hard it is to share secrets with anyone. It has been a pleasure to spend time reading people’s secrets and build a form of connection with you all.\n\n-Luis Ayala Castillo\n\nHey Frank,\n\nTwelve years ago I mailed in my license plate with the message “I don’t know where my home is” scrawled on the front. I had just dropped out of college and moved across the country to live with my dad.\n\nA lot has changed since then, but some things haven’t. My life imploded (again) and I found myself back in my dad’s house; I changed careers, graduated college, and went to grad school. But that secret has followed me for a decade, often featured on the website or exhibits. It popped up a few weeks ago and I thought “nothing has changed, I’m still just that lost kid” and then I realized how wrong I was.\n\nI’m not sure that I feel any more at home here now than I did back then, but something has changed. I found home in myself. Finally the skin that I live in feels like enough. Thank you for being a place of growth, love, and acceptance for all these years.\n\n-E\n\n~~~\n\nHey E-\n\nI know your secret well, it has been exhibited from the Smithsonian in Washington DC, to the Museum of Us (currently) in California. Like so many of the secrets I think we try to imagine the circumstances behind it, or project our lives onto it. So it’s really cool to hear from you over a decade later to learn the story (so far) behind your secret.\n\nRecently, we had your license plate professionally photographed. Soon it will be part of a large online exhibition of ‘naked mail’ (that’s what the post office calls it). I’ll include the photo below, along with a postcard that arrived recently that I feel speaks to your story.\n\nIt feels poetic that you wrote and mailed your secret on a license plate. Twelve years ago you started this long journey that gave you license to redefine your home – and your story.\n\nYour secret definitely has a home, so glad you found yours.\n\n-Frank\n\nTo: “frank” <frank@postsecret.com>\n\n—-Email Message—–\n\nDear Frank-\n\nI was at your book reading at Booksmith on Haight street for ‘A Lifetime of Secrets’. It was absolutely wonderful. You signed my book and at that point I had only flipped through the pages.\n\nWell, I sat down to read the book tonight and was overcome with shock, surprise and emotion when I saw my secret. It is written in red sharpie and reads: “I was adopted. I’ve seen pictures of my birth mother but not of my birth father. I am terrified that he will recognize me on the street one day. Every time I see a guy who looks about 35 I look for common features between us. It didn’t used to bother me but somehow it has turned into my greatest fear. I’m only 18 but I’m afraid this will plague me the rest of my life…”\n\nI immediately started to cry. The amazing thing is. I was at your book reading last night with my birth father, Eric (you signed his book to Meghan). I met him last April, and I couldn’t be more happy to have met him, and my birth mother. He was the one who told me about your book reading.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nThank You, to everyone in the PostSecret community who has donated their money or time to suicide prevention. As someone who has answered those phones on the overnight shift, I can tell you, There Is Hope And There Is Help.\n\nIn the early aughts, Frank Warren ran a medical document delivery business in Germantown, Maryland. It was a monotonous job, involving daily trips to government offices to copy thousands of pages of journal articles for pharmaceutical companies, law firms, and non-profits. By his early forties, he had a house in a nice subdivision, a wife, a young daughter, and a dog. His family fostered children for a few weeks or months, and he felt a sense of purpose in helping kids who were suffering acute crises in their own homes. From the outside, things appeared to be going better than well. But inside, something was missing: A sense of adventure, or at least a little fun. An outlet to explore the weirder, darker, and more imaginative parts of his interior world. He’d never been one for small talk, preferring instead to launch into deep discussions, even with people he barely knew. He wondered if he could create a place like that outside of everyday conversation, a place full of awe, anguish, and urgency.\n\nIn the fall of 2004, Frank came up with an idea for a project. After he finished delivering documents for the day, he’d drive through the darkened streets of Washington, D.C., with stacks of self-addressed postcards—three thousand in total. At metro stops, he’d approach strangers. “Hi,” he’d say. “I’m Frank. And I collect secrets.” Some people shrugged him off, or told him they didn’t have any secrets. Surely, Frank thought, those people had the best ones. Others were amused, or intrigued. They took cards and, following instructions he’d left next to the address, decorated them, wrote down secrets they’d never told anyone before, and mailed them back to Frank. All the secrets were anonymous.\n\nInitially, Frank received about one hundred postcards back. They told stories of infidelity, longing, abuse. Some were erotic. Some were funny. He displayed them at a local art exhibition and included an anonymous secret of his own. After the exhibition ended, though, the postcards kept coming. By 2024, Frank would have more than a million.\n\nContinue Reading. . ."
