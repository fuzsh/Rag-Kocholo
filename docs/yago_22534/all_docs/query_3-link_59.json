        "text": "Meet the trailblazers who left a mark on music\n\nSunday 8 March marks International Women’s Day, and while here at Magic we support and champion women every day of the year, we’re reflecting on the women who have made an unforgettable impact on the music industry.\n\nFrom blazing a trail for songwriters, to championing female voices and creating entertainment empires, these are just some of the female artists who have changed the game, set the bar higher and left an indelible mark on music.\n\nMadonna\n\nThe “Queen of Pop”’s four decade career has seen her produce fourteen studio albums, win seven Grammy’s and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. She also just so happens to be the best-selling female recording artist of all time.\n\nSince releasing her debut album in 1983, Madonna’s cultural legacy is still alive in the music industry, with countless artists from Britney Spears to Adele claiming they were influenced by her. Madonna is known for continuously reinventing herself, bringing a fresh sound to each album. She paved the way for other female artists in the pop industry and busted boundaries both lyrically and visually, by discussing religion, sex and politics in her music.\n\nAside from music, her role in the 1996 film Evita earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, she founded Maverick entertainment company and Maverick Records in 1992 and founded charities Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and Raising Malawi in 2006.\n\nElla Fitzgerald\n\nWith an astonishing 200 albums to her name, 14 Grammy Awards and over 40 million albums sold, Ella Fitzgerald sufficiently earned her title, \"First Lady of Song.\" She smashed through barriers as a woman of color during the civil rights era, and became the first African-American woman to win multiple Grammys at the inaugural Awards ceremony in 1958.\n\nFamed for her intonation, and a \"horn-like\" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing, Fitzgerald created music unlike any other. Her collaborations with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and The Ink Spots produced some of her best-known songs such as \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", \"Cheek to Cheek\", \"Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall\", and \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\".\n\nFitzgerald was also the first African-American woman to perform during the Super Bowl Halftime Show in 1972. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and in 1990, she became an honorary Doctor of Music at Harvard University. Fitzgerald also appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century.\n\nMariah Carey\n\nWhile her smash festive song, ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ secured her place in infamy, Mariah Carey’s legacy is much greater than one Christmas hit. She writes the majority of her songs, and paved the way for other female songwriters. Until a few years ago, she had written more Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 songs than any other woman.\n\nNoted for her five-octave vocal range and signature use of the whistle register, Mariah Carey is hailed as being one of the pioneers of pop and contemporary R & B music by embraced hip hop in the early stages in her career, collaborating with rappers such as Puff Daddy, Snoop Dogg, JAY-Z, and more. Carey also influenced many of today's biggest superstars including Beyoncé and Ariana Grande.\n\nCarey has sold over 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She is the second-best-selling female artist in the United States, with 66.5 million certified albums and has won five Grammy Awards. Additionally, she won the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival for her role in Precious in 2009.\n\nJanet Jackson\n\nThe youngest child of the Jackson family, Janet Jackson appeared on television first in 1976, before signing with A & M records in 1982. But it wasn’t until the release of her third and fourth albums, Control (1986) and Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989) respectively, that she became a pop icon.\n\nIn 1991, Jackson signed the first of two record-breaking multimillion-dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest-paid artists in the industry. Having sold over 100 million records, Jackson is one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nHer collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap and industrial beats, which led to crossover success in popular music. Jackson holds the record for the most consecutive top-ten entries on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart by a female artist with 18. She was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nHaving sold more than 50 million albums worldwide, Swift is the highest-earning female musician of the 2010s. With 10 Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, six Guinness world records at thirty years old, her impact is undeniable. At fourteen, Swift was the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house and her debut album was the longest-charting album of the 2000s in the United States. Her sophomore album, Fearless, a pop crossover hit, was the US's best-selling album of 2009 and certified diamond. The album helped Swift become the youngest Album of the Year winner.\n\nAs a songwriter, Swift has been honored by the Songwriters Hall of Fame and was included in Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time list in 2015.

With her seventh album, Lover (2019), she became the second woman to achieve six consecutive number-one albums on the Billboard 200.\n\nAside from her chart success, Taylor has been an advocate for fair compensation in the new world of streaming. When she removed her music from select services, demanding they change their compensation policies, it brought about real change. For her most recent albums, Swift hand-selected fans to come to her home, to hear her new music first, taking fan interaction to a new level.\n\nBeyoncé\n\nBeyoncé has been nominated for a Grammy over 60 times, taking home 22 of them over the last 17 years, and is the second most-winningest woman (second to bluegrass artist Alison Krauss who has 27 Grammy wins to her name and is the second biggest winner of any gender, tied with Quincy Jones). She rose to fame as part of the band Destiny's Child's, before venturing into a solo career. Her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.

She also has been inducted into 15 different Hall of Fames, and is tied with Bruce Springsteen for the most Grammy noms overall (they are both in 10th place).\n\nCiting her professions as singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, actress, author, businesswoman, and humanitarian, she is a highly successful, influential and game-changing figure for women in the music industry.

Houston’s cover became one of the best-selling singles of all time. As an actress, she has starred in films such as 9 to 5 (1980) and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982), for which she earned Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress.\n\nCher\n\nCommonly referred to by the media as the Goddess of Pop, Cher has embodied female autonomy in a male-dominated industry.
