        "text": "In celebration of the 40th anniversary of Singers Showcase—the longest running concert series in the history of Berklee College of Music—this powerful interdisciplinary student production will pay homage to four boundary-breaking decades of music from one of the most iconic, visionary, and influential figures in popular music history—Madonna. As the bestselling female recording artist of all time, Madonna continues to leave an indelible mark on the world through her pioneering contributions to contemporary music, fashion, dance, music videos, film, popular culture, activism, and humanitarian leadership.\n\nThis one-of-a-kind program showcases the craft and artistry of over 120 Berklee students from 30 countries, including vocalists, instrumentalists, arrangers, conductors, dancers, choreographers, track producers, EDI artists, and visual designers, who have each earned their coveted spot from hundreds of student auditions. Against an immersive backdrop of original VJ art and iconography from Madonna’s chameleonic career, the cast will share their eclectic blend of artistry, styles, cultures, and inspired live interpretations of Madonna's greatest hits across her phenomenal reign as the \"Queen of Pop and Reinvention.”\n\nSongs to be performed include “Music,” “Express Yourself,” “Into the Groove,” “Like a Virgin,” “Borderline,” “Vogue,” ”Frozen,” “Material Girl,“ “Like a Prayer,” “Open Your Heart,” “Papa Don’t Preach,” “Dress You Up,” “Don't Cry For Me Argentina,” \"4 Minutes,\" “Crazy for You,” “Hung Up,” “La Isla Bonita,” “Take a Bow,” \"Popular,\" and “Holiday,” to name a few.\n\nThe concert includes an exciting collaboration with a world-class choreographic team of guest dance faculty from Boston Conservatory at Berklee, who will coach the students and help to recreate and reimagine some of Madonna’s signature dance sequences from her celebrated tours and tightly choreographed music videos. Collectively, the team has served as choreographers and creative directors for a who’s who of major artists and brand commercials, and as in-demand professional dancers for countless music videos, world tours, and prestigious dance companies.\n\nThe show will also feature legendary drummer and recent Zildjian Hall of Fame inductee Omar Hakim, who will appear as a special guest performing with the student ensemble. Hakim has toured and recorded with Madonnna, Sting, David Bowie, Kate Bush, and Miles Davis, among many others. Attendees will also enjoy a pre-concert media exhibit from the Berklee Archives, to highlight key elements of Singers Showcase’s innovative 40-year history on campus.\n\nAchieving levels of power, control, and independence that were nearly unprecedented for a woman in the entertainment industry, Madonna revolutionized how female artists were marketed and promoted, bringing in a new era of female empowerment and self-expression through art. Propelled by her talent, work ethic, and larger-than-life stage presence, she fearlessly experimented with various musical styles and pushed creative boundaries, allowing her to stay relevant and continue to evolve as an artist. Throughout her career, Madonna has leveraged her immense popularity and global platform for good, breaking down social barriers, challenging the public perception of gender roles and sexuality, and serving as an outspoken advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights, HIV/AIDS awareness, and political causes.\n\nSince 1983, Singers Showcase has offered Berklee's vocal students, initially among the smallest cohorts with around 120 students, expanded opportunities to audition and perform. Today, voice principals account for the largest instrumental group at Berklee. Alumni Susan Tedeschi, Paula Cole, Lalah Hathaway, Robin McKelle, Jackie Foster, Grace Kinstler, and Qveen Herby all performed in this show while they were students. Over the last 40 years, Singers Showcase has evolved into one of the most highly subscribed and popular productions at the institution. With an unwavering commitment to performing arts excellence and the power of music to bring people together, the series seeks to represent the full breadth, depth, and diversity of our incredible student body, and feature a wealth of instrumentation, majors, and creative specializations across the entire Berklee curriculum. The concert is produced by Maureen McMullan ‘09.\n\nSingers Showcase 40th Anniversary Special: Holiday—Four Decades of Madonna is dedicated to the late Lee and Susan Berk, Larry Monroe, Rob Rose, Orville Wright, Ken Zambello, Richard Evans, Dennis Montgomery III, Donna McElroy, Walter Beasley, Winston Maccow, Nancy Marshall, Tom Stein, Tom Riley, Roger Brown, and all of the brilliant producers, musicians, and educators who served on the Yo Team over the years.\n\nProgram Information"
