        "text": "Apparantly we need to hear The Beast Within, but not Nothing Fails!Ã‚Â\n\nI suppose it does serve to showcase the almost hilarious theatrical teasing with her fans (myself included).Ã‚Â But apart from reving up your adrenaline actually being there, I think on CD Nothing Fails would have sounded so wonderful.Ã‚Â Even my tag-along friend at the time, who isn't a supporter, dug it highly indeed.Ã‚Â\n\nOh, but what a joy to hear the disarming, life-affirming 'indie' I Love New York.\n\nI haven't watched all of the DVD yet, but it seems like it's just an extended version of the documentary with some added unaired scenes as extras.\n\nThe live CD is 'live' from what I can tell, except for the rock version of \"I Love New York.\"\n\nThe CD is or was recorded live but \"Vogue\" is a lip synch jobby and most people think \"Nobody Knows Me\", \"Die Another Day\" and the rap from \"American Life\" were mimed too. \"The Beast Within\" and \"Hollywood Remix\" were played as an intro and interlude while Madame was off stage so they're not really live or mimed. Bit of a shame they're on here while \"Frozen\" and other proper live songs were left off.\n\nIt's a great little CD though the whole thing makes me ache for the Reinvention Tour DVD proper.\n\nSteve said:\n\nI haven't watched all of the DVD yet, but it seems like it's just an extended version of the documentary with some added unaired scenes as extras.\n\nYep, extended scenes, some extra scenes and all the songs in full, rather than the 2 minute clips they used on the MTV airing.\n\nAdem said:\n\nSteve said:\n\nI haven't watched all of the DVD yet, but it seems like it's just an extended version of the documentary with some added unaired scenes as extras.\n\nYep, extended scenes, some extra scenes and all the songs in full, rather than the 2 minute clips they used on the MTV airing.\n\nI'm sure mine doesn't have the songs in full - Vogue misses a verse. Sigh.\n\ndisco_joe said:\n\nAdem said:\n\nSteve said:\n\nI haven't watched all of the DVD yet, but it seems like it's just an extended version of the documentary with some added unaired scenes as extras.\n\nYep, extended scenes, some extra scenes and all the songs in full, rather than the 2 minute clips they used on the MTV airing.\n\nI'm sure mine doesn't have the songs in full - Vogue misses a verse. Sigh.\n\nThe songs are in full on the CD.\n\nIt's only fitting IGTTYAS ends in a giant shamozzle seeing it's been a giant balls ups from day one. At least it leaves the way clear now for a proper Reinvention Tour DVD (which, contractually, couldn't be released until the Secret doco had been released).\n\nI am guessing there are no additional subtitles for say, Greek?\n\nI h o p e and p r a y we do get the proper RIT DVD, I had such a great time when I saw the show in Paris, that I only remember it as being 5 minutes long. And Jean Paul Belmondo, J.P.Gaultier, Indra and that Baywatch hot guy distracted me a lot.\n\nAdditional scenes are pretty good stuff, esp the birthday party (love how she goes around fucking everyone with the blowup doll) and the voice lesson (she can sing!).\n\nDon't like how the DVD is chaptered by city and not song. Dont' like how the DVD still has song edits.\n\nCD is a mixed bag - does she even sing on Hollywood at all? Like A Prayer is meh, but Holiday, Mother and Father and American Life all add something new.\n\nImagine will never be heard by me again. Yuck."
