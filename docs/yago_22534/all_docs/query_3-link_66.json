        "text": "When Madonna walked onto the stage in London this weekend to launch her Celebrations tour, 20,000 ticketholders were projecting four decades of fantasies onto pop’s most iconic performer.\n\nI know the word ‘icon’ gets tossed around like a pom pom in the pop world. But Madonna is surely the one surviving performer who deserves the title. It comes from the Greek, eikos, meaning a symbol for a greater power, a channel of veneration. Unlike younger stars who spill their messy, human vulnerabilities in Netflix documentaries, Madonna remains (for good and ill) an electric, enigmatic conduit through which every individual fan can access their vital inner deity: strong, sexual and wildly autonomous.\n\nOne of my favourite books about her is Kay Turner’s “I Dream of Madonna: Women’s Dreams of the Goddess of Pop” (1993) in which the star slips into the unconscious imaginations of normal women and meets them as a friend, lover or – in one case – police officer.\n\n“Sometimes I feel guilty because I feel like I travel through people,” Madonna once said. “That’s true of a lot of ambitious people. You take what you can and then move on. If someone can’t go with me – whether it’s a physical or emotional move – I feel sad. But that’s part of the tragedy of love.” This is certainly the experience of those who recall meeting the brilliant, beautiful, unstoppable “unapologetic bitch” in the flesh.\n\n“She was spoilt from the beginning. She was the oldest girl and the one considered our parents’ favourite. That, combined with the fact she was really aggressive and wanted her way, and got it, made her a spoilt kid. But she was good-hearted. She liked to take care of the bunch.”\n\nChristopher Ciccone, brother\n\n“She was a smart girl, always motivated. Brilliant. Manipulative, I guess so. Yes. But you knew she would survive. You knew she would never be weak. And you were glad about that.”\n\nJoan, stepmother\n\n“I saw her in Godspell, and I remember that when the audience stood for the curtain call, she was crying. A sense of acceptance, I think now that this is what she most appreciated, most craved.”\n\nClara Bonnell, classmate\n\n“In high school, Madonna was a non-conformist. Unlike other girls, she didn’t shave her armpits, and neither did her sister Melanie. That was considered pretty weird. It didn’t stop her from raising her arms high while cheering, even when she wore a sleeveless uniform. And it certainly didn’t stop her from being popular with the boys.”\n\nTanis Rozelle, classmate\n\n“She kept to herself, but she was also a cheerleader, so she seemed to have two sides to her personality. She took herself more seriously than most of us did at that age. She read more than the average high school student.”\n\nWyn Cooper, classmate\n\n“I guess my immediate impression of her was a combination of fascination and intimidation. She was beautiful. Articulate. Very, very thin.... She embarked on what seemed to be a calculated campaign to be my friend. I resisted at first but she won me over. She was determined to break down whatever limits and boundaries I put up. I felt she was being real with me when she would reveal herself in vulnerable ways. But in the back of my mind, I would always think: Maybe not.[...]“\n\nWhitley Setrakian, university roommate\n\n“Madonna used to come here and act all crazy and giddy and dance around. She was the centre of attention. She didn’t drink, she was just the life of the party. She was a cool chick. She had beautiful eyes. I remember her eyes – God, they were beautiful.”\n\nRandy Frank, co-owner of Menjo’s Club in Detroit\n\n“One time our Afro dance instructor asked for dancers to perform in a church. During our rehearsal the first thing Madonna does is walk up to the pulpit, pick up the microphone and… start singing at the top of her lungs ‘Good Golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball.’ We were all laughing and the teacher went ballistic. ‘Get down from there, that’s sacrilegious!’ She loved being the centre of attention.”\n\nLinda Alaniz, fellow dance student\n\n“She came in wearing this T-shirt that was torn all the way down the back. And she had this enormous safety pin – it must have been a foot long – holding it together. I thought if she doesn’t poke her partner’s eye out she’ll do something with her dancing one day… Madonna had the power, the intensity, to go beyond mere physical performance into something far more exciting.”\n\nPearl Lang, on her 1978 audition for the Pearl Lang Company\n\n“In the 80s before she was famous, I used to go dancing with Madonna at Danceteria. Madonna had the most vicious body odour. It was like she had not showered in a week. She was a great dancer, but I tried not to get too close to her or I would literally pass out. It was that bad. It was total skank.”\n\nJanice Dickinson, former model\n\n“Keith (Haring) said that when Madonna was sleeping on his couch, the stories he could write about people she had sex with…”\n\nAndy Warhol\n\n“She was very flirtatious. She knew I was a gay woman. She was a street-savvy kid who’d pick up someone to go home with if she was hungry and needed a meal. That’s how she survived.”\n\nCamille Barbone, first manager\n\n“We had no money and we were sleeping on milk crates. She wasn’t a home-maker,”\n\nSteve Bray, boyfriend and collaborator from the early 1980s\n\n“I said I wanted her to meet with me in the hospital. I had my barber come in and shave me – I didn’t want her to think she’d be signing a contract with someone who would be dead in six months. Let me tell you, she was so anxious to do a deal that she couldn’t have cared if I was lying in my coffin.”\n\nSeymour Stein, President of Warner’s Sire Record\n\n“I was impressed by her fearlessness when we first met [in 1983] because I’m filled with fears… She calls me Mom sometimes, I’m completely maternal, very protective toward Madonna. She’s strong in a lot of ways. But I know a lot of it is just a front. I try to teach her things the way mothers want to teach their children about life: patience, empathy and calm. And humour. Sometimes I just remind her: ‘Let’s not take any of this too seriously.’”\n\nLiz Rosenberg, publicist\n\n“I was running late to get back to the Rockefeller Centre to interview Madonna [in 1985]. When I got there I had a bit of a clash with Peter Ikin from the record label because I was late, so I apologised and said ‘Who the f*** is Madonna anyway?’ And then this head poked around the corner and said ‘I’m Madonna. And what the f*** is a Molly?’”\n\nMolly Meldrum, Australian music critic\n\n“Self-confidence. That’s what first struck me about Madonna. She was relatively unknown when we were casting Desperately Seeking Susan. She arrived in a taxi at the casting office, but without money to pay for the ride. She hurried into the office and asked a girl at a desk for money to pay the taxi. I remember everyone commenting on what a cheeky thing that was to do. I don’t know if she ever paid the girl back, but when I heard the story, it fitted the free-spirited character of Susan perfectly.”\n\nSusan Seidelman, Director of Desperately Seeking Susan\n\n“I had watched the Lucky Star video over and over again. That’s how we all fell in love with her. We bonded over broken hearts and relationships. I got a lot of late-night calls about Jellybean. She’d always call me at 3 a.m. when I had 5 a.m. calls.”\n\nRoseanna Arquette, Desperately Seeking Susan Co-star\n\n“I had no idea Madonna was white because [her then-boyfriend and collaborator] Jellybean [Benitez] was Puerto Rican so I just assumed Madonna was Puerto Rican. When he came out, I was like ‘Wow, that’s Jellybean’s girlfriend, holy cow’… I went backstage and started talking to her and according to Madonna she made her mind up right there on the spot that I was the guy she wanted to work with just from that chance meeting.”\n\n“We finished the session. She was feeling a little bit insecure because I wasn’t hitting on her. She said ‘Nile, do you think I’m sexy?’ I went: ‘Madonna, of course. You’re one of the sexiest women on the planet.’ She said, ‘Well then why don’t you wanna f*** me?’ I said, ‘Because I’m your producer’. She said: ‘Well that didn’t stop any of the other ones.’”\n\nNile Rodgers, American record producer and guitarist\n\n“She looked like a bag lady,” says friend Tommy Quinn when he met up with her in the back booth of an Italian restaurant after the naked pictures came out. “So how do you like my outfit?” she asked him, “I’m a millionaire but this is what I have to wear in public just so that I can have some peace and quiet.’”\n\nTommy Quinn, New York studio musician\n\n“When Madonna first called me in 1989, it was two days before my ready-to-wear show, and I thought my assistant was joking. I was a big fan. She knew what she wanted – a pinstripe suit, the feminine corsetry. Madonna likes my clothes because they combine the masculine and the feminine. I love Madonna. She’s the only woman I ever asked to marry me. She said no, of course, but every time she asks me to work on her shows, I can’t say no.”\n\nJean Paul Gaultier, French fashion designer\n\n“From the moment I met her, I could tell she had a razor-sharp focus. She knew what she wanted even if she wasn’t sure of all the steps to get there. When we had wardrobe fittings for Express Yourself, Vogue or photoshoots, I would bring along clothes from my closet as well as vintage rentals, and it would be like girls playing dress-up with black lace and corsets, or a showgirl outfit. She never wanted to buy designer clothes. Dressing up was a way of acting out her dreams and who she wanted to play, whether it was the man in a suit, the seductress, the innocent girl or the vixen.”\n\nMarlene Stewart, Costume designer, 1985-1991\n\n“I will tell you the first time we ever met, we were both in this club in L.A. and it was very like being at the school canteen. Basically, somebody came over to my table and said ‘Madonna would really like to meet you’... (I thought) that’d be nice, cheeky cow. I proceeded to follow this woman over to Madonna’s table where she was talking to Kevin Bacon at the time and I stood there and she just ignored me, which is kind of what you do at school when you fancy someone isn’t it? You pretend not to like them. She didn’t try to seduce me, no... I didn’t stand there for very long!”\n\nGeorge Michael, Singer-songwriter and record producer\n\n“She came backstage at my show and we really hit it off. Before that she was someone I knew through Sean [Penn]. I was always fascinated by her. When I would see Sean at a party and she was there, she would give me the evil eye, like, she thought maybe Sean and I were f___ing. But we weren’t.”\n\nSandra Bernhard, American actress and comedian\n\n“She just was so rude to everybody. It seems to me that she’s got so much...She acts like a spoiled brat all the time.”\n\nCher, after inviting Madonna over to a dinner party in the 1980s\n\n“When I was putting the tour together, I was choreographing Like a Prayer and I wanted a move where the male dancers would lift her up. She was very pro-women’s rights and said, ‘I don’t want to be lifted up like some girl.’ I said, ‘No, Madonna, you’re not going to be lifted up like a girl, you’re going to be lifted up like a queen.’ She turned around and said, ‘Lift me, boys!’”\n\nVincent Paterson, director and choreographer\n\n“We were at the Hit Factory [studio in New York] once and I walked in on her on the lav – she hadn’t locked it. She’s doing a No 2 and I’m like: ‘Oh God, I’m so sorry.’ She said: ‘William, look, I was brought up in a family of six kids with one loo, so don’t sweat it.’ She’s a fabulous producer. When it says ‘produced by Madonna and William Orbit’, people don’t always give her the credit for that. But she’s as responsible as me.”\n\nWilliam Orbit, Producer of Ray of Light 1998\n\n“She told me she wanted white florals, and she loved the ‘addiction’ accord I created [a blend of vanilla, caramel and amber]. She needed the latest versions delivered by 2 p.m. on a Friday afternoon so she could evaluate them over the weekend at her horse farm in the Hamptons. Security always magically appeared behind me when I would ring the bell as if they knew I was coming.”\n\nPerfumer Stephen Nilsen, who created her first perfume\n\n“Disgusting,”\n\nDonald Trump, on her habit of chewing gum\n\n“Madonna came up and snatched the glasses off his face and threw them across the room. ‘Tonight, you’re going to be normal like the rest of us,’ she shouted. Madonna said that when they first met, Michael would stare at her breasts so hard that she took his hands and put them on her. He said, ‘Oh, no, you can’t do that.’”\n\nJamie Foster Brown, owner of Sister 2 Sister magazine, at a birthday party for Michael Jackson\n\n“I think most people would be really excited to realize how human she is you know because her persona is a whole different thing. It has a lot of razzle-dazzle about her. And I think that while a lot of people like that it also pushes you back a little bit. So I think that they would be really quite amazed that they can really just drop their shoulders and have a cheeseburger with her”\n\nCarlton Wilborn, dancer\n\n“She just sort of came in breezily, very late and had a clipboard in her hand. [She] said, ‘Yeah. Benedict Cumberbatch… is that really your name?’ And I went, ‘Yes it is, Madonna.’ I didn’t get the part.”\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch, on auditioning for an unspecified role\n\n“She treats us like family. She invites us to her house and we have movie nights and stuff like that. If we’re out with her and she wants us to dance, we’re going to dance,”\n\nAndrew ‘Drew Dollaz’ Boyce, a flex dancer from Brooklyn who performed on the MDNA tour\n\n“At 17 I had sat down with David Bowie downstairs at the Embassy Club. At 18 I had dined at La Couple with Andy Warhol and Bianca Jagger… yet everything was a pale imitation of the impact Madonna had... there was an energy field around her, like a wave, that swept everyone up as it crashed into the room. [She had a] tenderness and warmth that made your skin bump… She was raucous, but poised, elegant but common… She was mesmerising. She oozed sex and demanded a sexual response from everyone. It didn’t matter if you were gay. By the end of the meal I was in love.”\n\nRupert Everett, on first meeting her in 1985\n\n“She was a very young mid-Western girl with an accent and chewing gum in her mouth… She greeted us warmly, we offered her a small gift we had brought from France (Chanel perfume). She thanked us and we started to work.”\n\nPhotographer Xavier Martin, working on the set of True Blue 1986\n\n“You want the truth? It was a pain in the ass. Because we were doing a comedy movie, she hasn’t got a sense of humour.”\n\nGeorge Harrison, on working with Madonna on Shanghai Surprise\n\n“I was nervous being at the audition and when she walked in I did not recognize her. She had short hair and small-rimmed glasses and she was wearing a suit! Then I heard her voice and knew it was her. She was very serious and I felt that she wanted to get the auditions over with right away and get on with the rehearsals. A few days later we were standing side by side in front of the bathroom mirror putting on our makeup up having girl talk. Then that night, we were riding in her Limo to visit Billy Idol at his concert when her music came on the radio. It was a moment I will never forget.”\n\nDonna De Lory, backing singer 1987-2006\n\n“We met [in 1994] for an in-depth interview at her house in Miami, for the cover of The Face magazine. She was, of course, nothing like the character I’d invented. She was smarter, quieter, more thoughtful, very well-read and living in a relaxed but elegant home surrounded by beautiful art. At one point I tried to explain the [inspirational] role she had played in my life and say thank you, but it all came out a little weird and stalker-ish. I quickly changed the subject, and she seemed relieved.”\n\nSheryl Garrett, journalist\n\n“She was Madonna. We wondered if we were going to be able to talk to her. Was she going to have an entourage? Were they going to put up walls around her where she stands? But she was so game. She was a trooper,”\n\nGeena Davis, on shooting A League of Their Own\n\n“The guy next door says, ‘Was that Madonna going into your house yesterday?’ I said, ‘No, it’s just my friend.’ ‘Nice car,’ he said. And I said, ‘She really does well for herself.’… She has this thing where she can turn the microphone on, open her mouth and one of those melodies comes out and you go: ‘Blimey! That’s how you’ve done it!’”Madonna is a great enabler of creative freedom.\n\n“We had developed a shorthand on tour, so in the studio we didn’t need to over-communicate. The best way to explain our collaboration is how the record says ‘produced by Madonna/Price’, and that’s not because she is just putting her name there. She is as much a visionary as anyone else – I mean, she is the visionary on the record! When she sees the seed of something, she envisions it from beginning to end in a moment. It’s then a case of creating an environment to make it happen.”\n\nStuart Price, on recording the 2005 album Confessions with her\n\n“She gave me a pair of heels for the first time. Every number I’ve done with her, she always asks me: ‘Are you okay dancing with this? How do you feel?’ She would, like, go on her knees and fix your shoe.”\n\nSofia Boutella, dancer on the Confessions tour\n\n“Madonna’s the only humungous artist I ever worked with who sat with me in the studio. [She was] 100,000 percent involved. Did not leave the studio until it was done. I mean, her children even came by after school.”\n\nNiki Minaj, working on MDNA\n\n“I didn’t know what the hell was going on, I was terrible. I danced terribly… We all watch people perform on these stages and like they make it look like it’s just so natural and normal. Even the way they’re like dancing, running, walking down the stage. I’m like, ‘I don’t, do I skip?’ And then all of a sudden you find yourself like you’re standing on this thing, and then she hands you a banana, and right before that she’d like pushed me over and humped me. So I open it up and I start to peel it and eat the banana, and then all of a sudden I start lowering down on this little electronic elevator disappearing on the stage just like eating this banana.”\n\nAnderson Cooper, CNN host, on being pulled on stage with Madonna during her 2015 Rebel Heart tour\n\n“I felt like being around a woman that strong made me feel stronger. But then she has this really soft side, once you get to know her, and once she kind of trusts you and sees you, the real you, then it’s beautiful. It kind of changed my life..”\n\nMozella, Rebel Heart co-songwriter\n\n“She makes me feel lazy every time we work together. She only sleeps four hours a day and runs around like a crazy person.”\n\nDiplo, producer of “Bitch I’m Madonna”\n\n“I met my real-life IDOL Madonna. I can’t even believe I performed at her [Oscars afterparty] event and it was the most meaningful performance ever. She was everything I thought she would be a Liberal Kick ass feminist bitch. I’m soo happy.”\n\nCardi B, rapper\n\n“Almost four decades since I first saw her perform [in Camden in 1982], people continue to ask me ‘has Madonna changed?’ My reply is always the same. A firm ‘no’. Pretty much from day one, she was the same as she is now: very opinionated, smart, she knew what she wanted. She was confident, she was ambitious and an absolute perfectionist – just as she is today. Back then, as now, the look and the dancing – everything came from her.\n\n“I think with people the best art always comes from themselves without someone having to tell them what to do. She had an aura about her from the very beginning that radiated an energy force that would not be swept aside. She had buckets of self-belief – while still appreciating a bit of reassurance following those early performances – and gave off the air of someone who was in charge of every aspect of her career. Would she have made it today as she did back then? Of course she would. Madonna was always going to be a star, whatever era her career was born in.”\n\nBarbara Charone, publicist"
