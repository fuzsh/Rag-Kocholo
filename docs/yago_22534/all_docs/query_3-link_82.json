        "text": "It’s been 42 years since Madonna arrived on the scene with a post-disco anthem inviting everybody to “get up and do your thing.”\n\nDecades later, in an interview with Rolling Stone, the global pop icon looked back on the thrill of hearing “Everybody” for the first time on the radio in 1982.\n\n“I was living on the Upper West Side, 99th and Riverside, and about 7:00 at night I had the radio on in my bedroom, on WKTU, and I heard 'Everybody',” she recalled. “I said 'Oh, my God, that's me coming out of that box.’”\n\nShe’s spent plenty of time coming out of that box since “Everybody” as the undisputed Queen of Pop.\n\nSpoiler: It was fire: What it was like when Madonna brought the Virgin Tour to Phoenix\n\nShe holds the record for the most appearances at No. 1 on Billboard’s dance charts and remains the most successful solo artist in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 (second only to the Beatles).\n\nAs Slant summed up the power of her legacy in 2020, “By every objective measure, she’s the most successful singles artist of all time.”\n\nAnd she’s managed to do it while pushing the envelope, both musically and lyrically, as an artist whose most inspired work could feel ahead of its time on arrival without sounding dated decades later.\n\nWith Madonna out there celebrating her own standing as an icon for the ages on the aptly titled Celebration Tour, we’re counting down her most enduring moments as the most successful singles artist of all time. If you've got tickets to her Phoenix show, here's our ultimate guide to Madonna's concert at Footprint Center.\n\n35. 'Hollywood' (2003)\n\nChirping birds and a haunting acoustic-guitar riff set the tone for “Hollywood” before the beat kicks in, topped by squelchy bass, as Madonna reflects on the city of dreams. “Everybody comes to Hollywood,” she begins with a sigh. “They wanna make it in the neighborhood / They like the smell of it in Hollywood / How could it hurt you when it looks so good?”\n\nIt ends with a pitch-shifting rap encouraging the listener to “push the button / don't push the button / Trip the station / Change the channel.” The second single released from “American Life,” it became the first Madonna single not to crack the Hot 100 since “Burning Up,” a song released in 1983 before her mainstream breakthrough.\n\n34. 'Everybody' (1983)\n\nThis was Madonna’s first single, a synth-driven, Prince-flavored dance track that took the future star to No. 3 on Billboard’s dance charts for obvious reasons (while bubbling under Billboard’s Hot 100 for reasons less obvious). This is classic early ’80s dance pop with Madonna heavy-breathing her way through an opening monologue that doesn’t sound at all like an invitation to dance and sing.\n\n“I know you’ve been waiting,” she purrs. “Yeah. I’ve been watching you. Yeah. I know you wanna get up.” The vocal that follows is blessed with the youthful exuberance it takes to sell that call to dance and sing and do your thing. This is the song that got Madonna signed to Sire Records.\n\n33. 'Oh Father' (1989)\n\nThe fourth single released from “Like a Prayer,” “Oh Father” displayed a more serious side of Madonna than casual listeners were expecting at the time, which may explain it running out of steam at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIt's one of Madonna's most vulnerable moments, a heartbreaking portrait of life with a father whose anger she feared as a child with lush baroque-pop orchestration underscoring the raw emotion of her vocals.\n\n“It’s funny that way,\" she begins. \"You can get used to the tears and the pain / What a child will believe / You never loved me.”\n\nThe chorus hook is more empowering, the grown child singing, “You can’t hurt me now / I got away from you / I never thought I would / You can’t make me cry / You once had the power / I never felt so good about myself.”\n\n32. 'This Used to Be My Playground' (1992)\n\nMadonna wrote this melancholy ballad with Shep Pettibone for “A League of Our Own,” a Penny Marshall baseball film that starred Madonna. Contractual obligations kept it off the movie soundtrack but it topped the Billboard Hot 100, effectively breaking her tie with Whitney Houston to become the female artist with the most chart-topping entries on the Hot 100 at the time.\n\nIt’s a gorgeous record, the haunting string arrangement underscoring the emotion in her vocals as she wanders her old neighborhood, clearly saddened by the realization that she’ll never be that kid again. “This used to be the place I ran to whenever I was in need of a friend,” she sings. “Why did it have to end?”\n\nThe vulnerability of her delivery is what makes it resonate, although the universal nature of those feelings gets her halfway there.\n\n31. 'What It Feels Like for a Girl' (2001)\n\nThis bittersweet feminist anthem begins with a dialogue sample from the 1993 film “The Cement Garden,” Charlotte Gainsbourg reflects on gender identity with “Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short, wear shirts and boots, because it's okay to be a boy. But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading 'cause you think that being a girl is degrading. But secretly you'd love to know what it's like, wouldn't you?”\n\nThe song that follows featured Madonna reflecting on the expectations versus the reality of what it feels like for a girl while venting her frustration with the double standard she’s been forced to deal with through it all. “When you open up your mouth to speak, could you be a little weak?” she asks. And “When you're trying hard to be your best, could you be a little less?”\n\n30. 'Burning Up' (1983)\n\nThis song hit the streets just a month after “Beat It,” and considering the sonic similarities, it would be tempting to hear it as a shameless bid at cashing in on Michael Jackson’s winning blend of heavy rock guitar and early ’80s dance beats but for one thing: She recorded it before she could've heard that Jackson song.\n\nThe guitar sound is actually heavier on “Burning Up,” Madonna’s second single, which finds the personality that would go on to help define the decade fully formed — playful, assertive and sexy, burning up for love while leaving no doubt as to who would be calling the shots in that relationship. This single peaked at No. 3 on Billboard’s dance chart but failed to make the Hot 100.\n\nMadonna concert: The Queen of Pop brought 'the good, the bad, the sexy' to Phoenix\n\n29. 'Drowned World/Substitute for Love' (1998)\n\nWritten and produced by Madonna and William Orbit, this atmospheric trip-hop ballad eased listeners into “Ray of Light,” a transformative album released in 1998 in the wake of two life-altering experiences, the vocal lessons she took to prepare for her role in “Evita” and the birth to her daughter, Lourdes.\n\nYou can’t escape the impact both experiences had on “Drowned World/Substitute for Love,” which topped the charts in Spain but was never released as a single in the States.\n\nAs she told Rolling Stone, “The whole idea of giving birth and being responsible for another life put me in a different place.” In the opening verse, she shares a revelation she’s had about living the life of Madonna all those years. “I traded fame for love without a second thought,” she sings. “It all became a silly game / Some things cannot be bought.”\n\n28. 'Cherish' (1989)\n\nThis doo-wop-flavored throwback to the golden age of girl groups is among the lighter moments to be found on “Like a Prayer,” a fourth Madonna album understandably received at the time as a huge artistic stride for the voice of “Material Girl.”\n\nBut “Cherish wears its playful effervescence like a crown as Madonna invests the unabashedly romantic lyrics (“Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side”) with all the youthful innocence and joy at her disposal. Rhyming “Romeo and Juliet” with “they never felt this way, I bet” is genius. And the hooks are undeniable.\n\nI have no reason to suspect this song was written in response to someone asking “Should we write another ‘True Blue?’” Nor would I be shocked to learn that that’s exactly how it happened. “Cherish” peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 as the third Top 5 single released from “Like A Prayer.”\n\n27. 'Secret' (1994)\n\nThe lead single from “Bedtime Stories” is a soulful ballad that sets the tone with acoustic guitar before Madonna grabs the spotlight with her understated pout in the opening line. “Things haven’t been the same,” she tells him, “since you came into my li-hife.” Her baby’s got a secret and she likes it, purring, “Something’s coming over me.”\n\nIt’s a sexy performance with sympathetic backing, the hip-hop-flavored R&B groove moving the single along without turning it into a dance song. The vocals and arrangement are Madonna at her soulful best. “Secrets” is actually closer in sophisticated spirit to something Sade would have done. But with a more insistent beat.\n\nThis single peaked at No. 3 on Billboard’s Hot 100 while topping the dance chart.\n\n26. 'Who’s That Girl?' (1987)\n\nFrom the soundtrack to a screwball comedy/box-office bomb of the same name with Madonna’s name above the title, “Who’s That Girl?” was written for the 1987 film, originally titled “Slammer,” with lyrics loosely based on the character Madonna plays.\n\nIt was her second consecutive single to feature lyrics partly sung in Spanish as well as Spanish-flavored instrumental backing, making it an obvious successor to the same year’s “La Isla Bonita.” This one topped the Hot 100 but somehow stalled at No. 44 on Billboard’s dance chart (this despite a beat that dares you not to dance). The production couldn’t be more ’80s, but it wears its ‘80s well.\n\n25. 'Human Nature' (1995)\n\nThis was written as an answer song to the critical drubbing she took in response to the more sexually explicit turn she took on 1992’s “Erotica,” which more than lived up to the promise of its title and an accompanying coffee table book of photos titled “Sex.”\n\nOn “Human Nature,” she uses her sexiest whisper to brilliant effect. After setting the tone with a whispered mantra of “Express yourself / don’t repress yourself,” she signs off with a series of withering whispered asides, from “I’m not sorry” and “Would it sound better if I were a man?” to “You’re the problem” and “Why don’t you just deal with it?”\n\nRiding a rubbery bass groove on a bed of jazzy, atmospheric trip-hop beats, Madonna addresses her critics in no uncertain terms. “Did I say something wrong?” she asks. “Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex.” This is Madonna at her most unapologetically defiant, “breakin' all the rules I didn't make.” And it is a glorious thing to behold.\n\nIt only got to No. 46 on Billboard’s Hot 100, but 30 years later, it remains one of her most inspired moments as a musical provocateur.\n\n24. 'Erotica' (1992)\n\nPicking up where “Justify My Love” left off, “Erotica” is kinky art-pop with Madonna purring filthy spoken come-ons on an atmospheric bed of sound where trip-hop, hip-hop and samples of Kool & the Gang’s “Jungle Boogie” and Lebanese singer Fairuz come together and grind.\n\nIt starts with the sound of a needle hitting vinyl, followed by bass, percussion and eventually Madonna, who says “My name is Dita,” then asks, “If I take you from behind, push myself into your mind when you least expect it, will you try and reject it?”\n\nEven by Madonna's standards, this was pretty kinky stuff for 1992. And yet, it was certified gold after topping the dance charts and peaking at No. 3 on Billboard’s Hot 100. It may have helped that the chorus, inviting listeners to “put your hands all over my body,” was a good deal catchier than “Justify My Love.”\n\n23. 'Angel' (1985)\n\nLike many of her greatest '80s hits, this single was produced by Chic’s Nile Rodgers and it shows. That pizzicato hook — a blend of synthesizer and guitar — is undeniable. And Madonna’s delivery is great, from the yearning she brings to the chorus to that playful laugh she drops in out of nowhere for whatever reason.\n\n“I believe that dreams come true,” she sings, “’cause you came when I wished for you.” An unabashedly romantic ode to crushing hard enough to figure out the person who’s making you swoon is a heavenly being, “Angel” peaked at No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot 100, topped the dance charts and was certified gold.\n\n22. 'Take a Bow' (1994)\n\nThis Babyface collaboration brought the “Bedtime Stories” album to a fitting close. It's practically a lullaby, Madonna’s soulful melody supported by a dreamy string arrangement as she paraphrases Shakespeare (“All the world is a stage, and everyone has their part”) while sending the one who took her love for granted packing with “The show is over, say goodbye.”\n\nIt’s as breathtaking a ballad as Madonna ever managed, alternating lines with her collaborator on a track with a distinctly Asian flavor. As Babyface told Rolling Stone, \"She came to me for lush ballads, so that's where we went.” “Take a Bow” spent seven weeks at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100, a personal best for a woman with 12 chart-topping singles to her credit.\n\n21. 'Dress You Up' (1985)\n\nThe final single from her landmark second album, “Like a Virgin,” “Dress You Up” adds slinky funk guitar to a pulsating synth groove — Nile Rodgers effectively leaving his musical fingerprints all over the recording — while Madonna promises to “dress you up in my love, all over your body” with a girlish charm that does its best to fool you into thinking there’s no sexual innuendo to be found here.\n\nIn retrospect, it’s kind of funny that it earned a spot on Tipper Gore’s infamous “Filthy Fifteen,” a pearl-clutching countdown of the era’s most objectionable pop songs. The chart that ultimately mattered was the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 5, largely fueled by Madonna’s euphoric delivery and Rodgers’ fantastic production.\n\n20. 'Lucky Star' (1983)\n\nShe sounds so young and innocent, setting the tone with a youthful chirp of “You must be my lucky star ’cause you shine on me wherever you are / I just think of you and I start to glow / And I need your light, and baby you know.”\n\nThe closest she comes to sexual innuendo here is “Shine your heavenly body tonight.” But sometimes a sassy delivery, a slinky post-Chic disco groove and some shimmery synths are all it takes to launch a proper pop sensation.\n\nThe opening track on her first album, written by Madonna, made it all the way to No. 4 on Billboard’s Hot 100 — her first Top 5 appearance! — while topping the dance charts and inspiring a nation of Madonna wannabes when its iconic video blew up on MTV.\n\n19. 'Don't Tell Me' (2001)\n\nThe unnaturally edited, stop-start acoustic guitar loop that opens this record is the kind of hook that either gives a song its character or drives a person mad. In this case, it's a bit of each. After 23 years, it still feels like a digital glitch. But therein lies the charm of that opening hook in the hands of Mirwas, whose otherworldly production here is absolutely brilliant.\n\nMeanwhile, Madonna progresses from rhyming “Don’t tell me to stop” with “Tell the rain not to drop” to images as dark as “Tell the bed not to lay / Like the open mouth of a grave, yeah / Not to stare up at me / Like a calf down on its knees.” The second single from “Music,” topped the dance charts and peaked at No. 4 on Billboard’s Hot 100.\n\n18. 'Frozen' (1998)\n\nThe “Ray of Light” album was a huge departure for Madonna, and “Frozen” heralded the new Madonna as the album’s lead-off single. It’s an atmospheric, cinematic triumph of electro-tinged balladry with melancholy strings as breathtaking as Sigur Ros’ finest work — no, really — and Madonna wisely undersells the emotion as she shares her feelings for a man whose heart is frozen.\n\nShe knows we can tell she’s unhappy. There’s no need to overdo it. And the fact that the track itself, produced by William Orbit, mirrors the chill of the lyrics is a nice touch. This one topped the U.S. dance charts and became the first Madonna single to debut at No. 1 in the U.K. while peaking at No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100.\n\n17. 'La Isla Bonita' (1987)\n\nMadonna explored her love of Latin culture on her final single from “True Blue,” a third album that, by that point, had already sent three songs to No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100. This one peaked at No. 4 but managed to inspire yet another Lady Gaga single, “Alejandro.”\n\n“Last night I dreamt of San Pedro,” Madonna begins on a track that makes excellent use of both Cuban percussion and Spanish guitar.\n\nMadonna’s writing partner Patrick Leonard pitched an early version of this track to Michael Jackson. When Jackson said he wasn’t feeling it, he tried Madonna, who came up with the lyrics, complete with a scene-setting nod to a tropical paradise that doesn’t actually exist, in tribute to what she’s referred to as \"the beauty and mystery of Latin American people.”\n\nMadonna 2024 setlist: Every song she played at Phoenix concert on her Celebration tour\n\n16. 'Express Yourself' (1989)\n\nSomeone young enough to not be that familiar with Madonna hearing this song for the first time might mistake it for a shameless knockoff of the Lady Gaga anthem, “Born This Way.” But Madonna was too busy ruling the pop charts to bother with time travel back in the ’80s.\n\nA horn-driven funk track Madonna and co-producer Stephen Bray conceived as a musical tribute to Sly and the Family Stone (mission accomplished!), this female empowerment anthem encourages listeners to demand some R-E-S-P-E-C-T in their relationships. “Satin sheets are very romantic,” she admits. But then, she turns around and asks, “What happens when you're not in bed?”\n\nThis single peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100, topped the dance charts and went on to be certified gold.\n\n15. 'Open Your Heart' (1986)\n\nA euphoric dance groove fueled by funk guitar riffs offsets moody chords and melancholy lyrics in the verses, where Madonna pines, “I see you on the street and you walk on by / You make me wanna hang my head down and cry.”\n\nBy the second verse, she sounds more like a stalker, but she isn’t giving up, spending her choruses pleading, “Open your heart to me / I hold the lock and you hold the key” (when the metaphor clearly works better if she holds the key).\n\nThis was her third chart-topping entry on the Billboard Hot 100 from the “True Blue” album.\n\n14. 'Vogue' (1990)\n\n“What are you lookin’ AT?,” she demands at the top of an anthem extolling the virtue of striking a pose while getting into the groove of a pulsating house beat.\n\nThe concept was inspired by a dance craze sweeping the gay ballroom scene in New York City at the time. As Madonna would recall years later in an interview with Rolling Stone, “I was going to Sound Factory and checking out these dancers who were all doing this new style of dancing called 'voguing.'”\n\nThe track she arrived at is classic Madonna, from the way it steals its best ideas from gay culture to the way she tells you “let your body move to the music” when she knows your body has no choice while channeling the best escapist fantasies of classic disco. “I know a place where you can get away,” she sings. “It's called a dance floor. And here's what it's for.”\n\nShe also name-drops classic heroes of Old Hollywood in a mid-song rap of sorts that finds her rhyming “Greta Garbo and Monroe” with “Dietrich and DiMaggio.” It topped the Hot 100 and the dance charts, preparing the world for the disco revival to come.\n\n13. 'Holiday' (1983)\n\nMadonna’s mainstream breakthrough, “Holiday” was written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens-Crowder for their own post-disco group, Pure Energy, whose label didn’t want it. Mary Wilson, Phyllis Hyman and the Ritchie Family also passed on “Holiday” before producer Jellybean Benitez brought it to Madonna, who plays cowbell on the record.\n\nThe percussion here is Latin disco, the keyboard sound is early Prince and the vocals are classic Madonna, channeling disco euphoria while dreaming of a holiday. “Just one day out of life,” she sighs, “It would be so nice.”\n\nThe production hasn’t aged as well as, say, “Into the Groove,” but the melody? That’s timeless. Initially released as the B-side of the “Lucky Star” 12-inch, “Holiday” peaked at No. 16 on the Hot 100 (her first of 33 consecutive Top 40 singles) and became the first of 50 songs to top the dance charts for Madonna.\n\n12. 'Papa Don't Preach' (1986)\n\nThis was seen as huge artistic growth in 1986, the voice of “Like a Virgin” taking on the issue of teen pregnancy, telling her father “I’ve made up my mind / I’m keepin’ my baby / I’m gonna keep my baby” on a richly orchestrated dance track with dramatic string and an acoustic guitar solo.\n\nThere’s more soul than we’d come to expect from Madonna by that point in her raspier-than-usual delivery, which underscores the urgency of the proceedings as she pleads her case.\n\nThe second single from the “True Blue” album, it became Madonna’s fourth chart-topping entry on the Billboard Hot 100. Not everybody liked it, though. Pope John Paul II, who felt having a child outside the \"sanctity of marriage\" was immoral, urged Italian Catholics to boycott her concerts.\n\n11. 'Material Girl' (1984)\n\nThis playful romp, complete with chirpy hiccups, was sniffed at as crass and materialistic by critics waiting for another reason to resist Madonna's mania in 1984.\n\nBut there’s nothing about this performance to suggest that you’re supposed to take it at face value, least of all the deadpan backing vocals robotically chanting “Live. Ing. In a Material World” over Nile Rodgers' industrial robo-funk groove.\n\nSatire is rarely served this sassy. And Madonna nails the character, setting the tone with “Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me / I think they’re OK / If they don’t give me proper credit / I just walk away.” It’s weird to think that anyone could hear that hiccupping wink of a delivery as a straight-faced celebration of consumerism.\n\nThis song peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 while topping the dance charts (even though it feels more like a pop hit than a dance song). Madonna has said it’s her least favorite song she's recorded, in part because so many journalists who never understood the record have taken to calling her the Material Girl.\n\n10. 'Hung Up' (2005)\n\nEvery so often, Madonna releases an album that’s clearly meant to reassert the singer’s club roots. And 2005’s “Confessions on a Dance Floor” wasn’t shy about announcing its intentions.\n\nThe first single out of the box, “Hung Up” was retro-tastic disco gold, riding a pulsating sample of ABBA’s “Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)” to No. 1 in no fewer than 41 countries, which the “Guinness Book of World Records” confirmed as a new world record two years later.\n\nAlthough it did not top the Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 7, \"Hung Up\" took her back to No. 1 on Billboard’s dance chart. Which of course it topped the dance charts! She’s at the top of her game as a disco diva here, obsessively waiting night and day for the call that never comes because she’s that hung up after setting the tone with a ticking clock.\n\nAnd yes, the wordplay would appear to be intentional. But really, it’s the groove that ultimately matters here. And the groove is amazing.\n\n9. 'Live to Tell' (1986)\n\nAnother classic early ballad, this one turned up in a Sean Penn movie. Who thought that would end well?\n\nBringing the drama without the requisite intensity her former husband would have brought to the proceedings, Madonna broods her way convincingly through the ominous production, leaving the details to the listener’s imagination while making it clear that something bad could definitely happen if she doesn’t watch her step. “If I live to tell” is a pretty dark concept.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone years later, Madonna reflected on the inspiration for the song, which topped the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\"Sometimes when I'm writing songs, I'm just channeling,\" she said. \"I could say that 'Live to Tell' was about my childhood, my relationship with my parents, my father and my stepmother. But maybe not. It could be about something in an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, or a story that I heard once.”\n\n8. 'Ray of Light' (1998)\n\nAnother huge artistic stride, this single was seen as Madonna reclaiming her spot on the front lines of the dance-pop revolution, bringing in producer William Orbit for a clattering gem of a track with elements of techno, trance and electronic dance. You’d never know it was based on an understated psychedelic folk song from the early ‘70s by the British folk duo Curtiss Muldoon.\n\nAfter easing into the proceedings with an atmospheric intro, this track is all forward momentum, with Madonna out front cooing lines as enigmatic as “Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder / Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun.”\n\nReasserting her cultural relevance with a pulsating dance beat while reflecting her own spiritual awakening as she explored Kabbalah, it effortlessly topped the dance charts, peaked at No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and was certified gold.\n\n7. 'Music' (2000)\n\nIf “Ray of Light” was Madonna reclaiming her spot on the front lines of the dance-pop revolution, this was her getting back into the groove with a smile-inducing throwback to the Golden Age of Disco. A vocoder-sized Madonna voice straight outta Funkytown keeps popping up to wonder “Do you like to boogie woogie?” Which, of course, you do or you wouldn’t still be reading.\n\nThere’s even a utopian political agenda. “Music makes the people come together / music mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel.” How disco is that?\n\nProduced by Mirwais, whose thumping electro-funk beats are filtered through a wall of futuristic synth lines and digital echoes of Kraftwerk’s “Trans-Europe Express,” “Music” topped the dance charts and the Hot 100, going platinum while bringing her into the 2000s.\n\n6. 'Like a Virgin' (1983)\n\nPeople throw around the word “iconic” way too often. They should save it for special occasions. Like this. To anyone who lived through “Like a Virgin” in the ’80s, there can be no single that causes more colorful flashbacks to that first wave of Madonna mania than this.\n\nStrutting along to a throbbing funk riff clearly cribbed from Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” (she even yelps like Michael), it features young Madonna at her chirpiest, cooing pitched-up lines about how she’d been had and was sad but “you made me feel shiny and new, like a virgin.”\n\nThere’s a reason uptight parents of the ’80s were less than thrilled at the thought of their preteen daughters being wannabes, as Madonna fans were labeled in the media. Of course, compared to “Justify My Love,” it does feel pretty virginal.\n\nMadonna spoke to Rolling Stone a few years after “Like a Virgin” spent six weeks at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 as her first chart-topping hit.\n\n\"I was surprised with how people reacted to 'Like a Virgin,'\" she recalled. \"When I did the song, to me, I was singing about how something made me feel a certain way ― brand-new and fresh ― and everyone else interpreted it as, 'I don't want to be a virgin anymore. (Expletive) my brains out!' That's not what I sang at all.\"\n\n5. 'Crazy For You' (1985)\n\nHer first big ballad has hung on to its standing as her best big ballad, a soaring emotional prom theme for the ages that somehow breathes new life into a premise as cliched as spying someone hot across a crowded dance floor and moving in for the kill.\n\nIt’s the sexual longing she brings to the delivery that makes it work, especially the chorus hook (“I’m crazy for you / Touch me once and you’ll know it’s true / I never wanted anyone like this / It’s all brand new / You’ll feel it in my kiss / I’m crazy for you”).\n\nFeatured in the Matthew Modine high-school wrestling romance “Vision Quest,” it followed “Like a Virgin” to the top of Billboard’s Hot 100 to become her second No. 1.\n\n4. 'Justify My Love' (1990)\n\n“I’m open and ready for you to justify my love.” This art-pop classic from the pen of Lenny Kravitz and Ingrid Chavez with additional lyrics by Madonna is primarily a nonstop string of hot, wet whispers with Madonna breathing heavy on the mike while sharing her erotic fantasies as spoken-word performance art that’s nothing like a virgin.\n\n“I wanna run naked in a rainstorm,” she purrs, “make love in a train cross country / You put this in me, so now what? So now what?!” And this is all set to a minimal trip-hop beat (with a slight hint of G-funk) and an atmospheric keyboard wash over a pulsating bassline.\n\nIt’s her artiest pop-culture triumph and her sexiest performance, topping Billboard’s Hot 100 and the dance charts on the way to going platinum, despite the fact that MTV refused to air the erotically charged video, which the standards committee rejected as too hot for community standards.\n\n3. 'Borderline' (1984)\n\nHands down the best song on Madonna’s self-titled debut, it features the same girlish pout as her other early hits, but she invests that girlish pout with way more soul on “Borderline.”\n\nAnd it’s all in the service of sexual longing, causing flashbacks to the girl-group era with “Just try to understand / I’ve given all I can ’cause you got the best of me,” then following through with the sexual innuendos of a chorus hook about how “you just keep on pushing my love over the borderline.”\n\nBrilliantly produced by Reggie Lucas, a Miles Davis sideman who famously worked on the song with Madonna in Jean-Michael Basquiat’s apartment while Madonna was apartment-sitting, “Borderline” hit No. 10 on Billboard’s Hot 100 ― a Madonna first! ― and went on to become her first gold single.\n\n2. 'Into the Groove' (1985)\n\n“Into the Groove” has become the definitive Madonna dance song, on which any number of subsequent Madonna dance songs would be based without approaching the disco inferno ignited by this one. And it goes beyond the groove. That spoken intro is classic Madonna — “And you can dance. For inspiration. Come on (come on, come on, come on). I’m waiting.”\n\nBut the youthful passion she invests in her delivery is what ultimately elevates this track as Madonna locks the doors at night, where no one else can see, to get into the groove alone before admitting she's tired of dancing alone, a hint of desperation in her voice as she demands, “Tonight, I want to dance with someone else.”\n\nTaken from the soundtrack to director Susan Seidelman’s “Desperately Seeking Susan,” the box-office smash that first suggested she could act, it somehow never hit the Hot 100, but it sure did top the dance charts, going on to be certified gold with Billboard naming it Dance Single of the Decade.\n\n1. 'Like a Prayer' (1989)\n\nMadonna had long since established herself as a pop sensation when this song hit the streets and dared you not to take her seriously as an artist.\n\nShe eases you in with an aching, ethereal opening — “Life is a mystery / Everyone must stand alone / I hear you call my name and it feels like home” — backed by a choir and church organ. Then, the beat takes over.\n\nBut it keeps returning to the gospel-flavored ache of that opening, eventually bringing the church to the dance floor on the song’s triumphant climax, effectively blurring the lines between the pleasures of the flesh and the euphoria of spiritual awakening.\n\nThe Vatican condemned the video, which featured the stigmata-rocking superstar engaged in dirty thoughts about a saint, causing Pepsi to cancel its sponsorship deal. And face it, if you were the Vatican, you would’ve done the same thing. Despite the controversy, the greatest of Madonna’s greatest hits topped Billboard’s Hot 100 and became her first platinum single.\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.
