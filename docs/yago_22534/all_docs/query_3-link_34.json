        "text": "By the year 2000, there were no more pages in the pop star rulebook for Madonna to rip up. At no point in her nearly two-decade career had her star begun to dull; 1992’s Erotica was, by Madonna standards, a flop, but it still peaked at No. 2 and spawned two top 10 hits. She followed it up with 1994’s R&B-influenced Bedtime Stories and its single “Take a Bow,” which stayed atop the Hot 100 for seven weeks. With 1998’s Ray of Light, she claimed to be stepping away from the trappings of pop star life—and still, somehow, wound up more famous and more influential than ever.\n\nMadonna’s pivot on Ray of Light was wildly successful, her Britpop-suffused entry into the world of Eastern spirituality and clean living cannily marrying the tastes of a culture as interested in Pure Moods as Oasis. As a rebrand—from the bratty transgression of her early career to a serene, anti-individualist earth mother—it was almost too successful. For the first time, Madonna was up in the clouds, presiding over her pop kingdom from afar, seemingly uninterested in the vagaries of the modern landscape. Although Ray of Light produced three undeniable hits—its title track, the steely, lovelorn “Frozen,” and all-timer power ballad “The Power of Good-Bye”—the reserved persona necessitated by Madonna’s more self-serious music had also stamped out some of her sense of fun.\n\nNo matter: As ever, Madonna had more cards to play. On 2000’s Music, the wise, newly magnanimous superstar came back down to earth and, naturally, the club. Capitalizing on the gargantuan success of Ray of Light, Music managed to maintain Madonna’s newly mature image while reinjecting her sound with fun and freedom. It wasn’t a reinvention, exactly. Instead, Madonna proved that she could be a 42-year-old mother of two and still be as sexy, silly, and provocative as she’d always been. “There’s nothing sexier than a mother—Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeiffer, I mean, those women are sexy,” she told People in March 2000. “I’m in better shape than I was at 20.”\n\nOn Music, Madonna presented her vision of global heartland music. The cowboy getup she wore throughout this era isn’t tied to any overarching country influence; instead, think of it as a (slightly gaudy) symbol of humility, an indication that this record is something real and vital. This was an album designed to unite the disparate tastes of America and Europe, to act as a bridge between teen pop and sophisti-pop, the mainstream and the underground. Across Music, Madonna infused French touch with the sleazy grind of R&B, reinterpreted Americana through the lens of Timbaland and Aaliyah’s warped pop experiments, and put her spin on the clean, heartfelt ballads that the Titanic soundtrack had pulled to the top of the charts. An album comprised entirely of earnest balladry and heaving club tracks, it became one of Madonna’s final world-beating successes—a flexing of artistic muscle that holds its own alongside her most electrifying, epoch-defining records. “The world is in the doldrums musically. It’s all so generic and homogenized,” she told Billboard at the time. “If this record happens, it might mean that people are ready for something different.”\n\nThe success of Ray of Light had energized Madonna, but a tight filming schedule for her 2000 rom-com flop The Next Best Thing put plans for a tour on hold. In the interim, she fell in love with the British director Guy Ritchie and by early 2000 was pregnant and living in the UK part-time to be closer to him. London’s voracious paparazzi overwhelmed her, but she felt inspired by the city’s “cool, creative vibe” and decided to retreat to the studio.\n\nInitially, Madonna had planned to work once again with William Orbit, the British producer whose dual interest in Britpop and frosty underground electronic music colored Ray of Light. But as was the case with Babyface after Bedtime Stories, she found that her new music with Orbit was too reminiscent of what had come before. “I knew that I didn’t want to repeat myself,” she told an interviewer. “After I wrote about nine songs, I decided that there was too much of a similarity to the last record, so I threw out everything and started all over again.”\n\nHer salvation came in the form of a relative unknown: Mirwais Ahmadzaï, a French producer whom Guy Oseary, Madonna’s manager and chairman of her Maverick label imprint, was considering signing. Mirwais’ demo tracks were funky and hypnotic, descendants of Daft Punk’s club squelch with a grungier edge. Madonna was so enamored with them that two songs—“Paradise (Not for Me)” and “Impressive Instant”—made their way onto Music practically wholesale. With Mirwais’ manager acting as translator, the pair began work together at Notting Hill’s Sarm Studios. Mirwais ended up producing six of Music’s 10 songs, with Orbit working on another three.\n\nAside from pulling her back into the underground, Mirwais solved another problem for Madonna. By 2000, teen pop had fully taken hold of the charts. Artists like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and the Backstreet Boys were now fixtures of the same tabloids and TV stations that had fixated on Madonna; the embodied, self-made brand of womanhood she had been selling in the ’80s had given way to music that was sugary-sweet and unashamedly infantile in its presentation. Madonna hated teen pop—she complained to Rolling Stone how “depressing” it was that teenagers were the only people buying records, leaving artists like “Massive Attack, or Tricky, or Goldie” with “no outlet for any of their music”—and, to her, Mirwais presented an electrifying, grown-up alternative to the treble-heavy confections populating the radio.\n\n“Music,” the album’s opener and lead single, provides an instant palate cleanser. Its opening line—a pitched-down Madonna cooing, “Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on. I wanna dance with my baby”—sets the terms: These songs are for dancing with people, not for them. “...Baby One More Time” may have been perfect for practiced choreography, but it lacked groove and grit. Here, Madonna announced, was something to make you move.\n\nMusic is a wonky, maximalist record—a far cry from the sleek and limpid techno of Ray of Light. For the first time in her career, Madonna told Tatler, she had given herself license to relax: “OK, you don’t have to win any races.” The absence of internal pressure opened space to experiment and get downright strange. Mirwais filled the songs on Music with bizarre, avant-garde touches: On “Music,” Madonna’s vocal is frequently stacked out of time, as if the song is playing over itself; a vocodered voice asking “Do you like to boogie-woogie?” is as present as Madonna herself. “I like to singy-singy-singy/Like a bird on a wingy-wingy-wingy,” she trills deliriously on “Impressive Instant.” Unlike the records she made before or after, Music is absent concept; it feels guided by first thought, and is often intentionally ridiculous in a way few (or no) other Madonna records are.\n\nMirwais, more than any producer Madonna had worked with before, was interested in the voice as an instrument to be manipulated and remolded. On “Impressive Instant” and “Paradise (Not for Me),” his vocoder makes Madonna sound like an alien diva, alternately nasal and mischievous and disturbingly disembodied. She had heard Mirwais’ Auto-Tune work—he claims his 2000 solo cut “Naïve Song” was the “1st electro track with Auto-Tune FX on vocals”—and asked to use the effect on Music; the resulting ballad, “Nobody’s Perfect,” is ghostly and forlorn, its self-lacerating lyrics made more piercing by the vocal processing. At the time, Auto-Tune was best known as the “Cher effect” and synonymous with euphoric dance pop. Its inverted application on “Nobody’s Perfect” presaged Radiohead’s use of the technique on 2001’s Amnesiac and the wounded android pop ballads of the 2010s. But Mirwais also recognized when to hold back, and on the steadfast and optimistic “I Deserve It,” the vocals are totally dry. Madonna has never been a particularly soul-baring lyricist, and Mirwais’ detail-oriented production allowed for clean emotional delineation between each song: one alienated and upsetting, the other expressing personal affirmation.\n\nOther songs feel like the perfect synthesis of dozens of disparate strands of ’90s pop. “Don’t Tell Me,” the album’s most indelible song and one of Madonna’s best-ever singles, plays like Sheryl Crow’s “Strong Enough” as remixed by Timbaland. A guitar part loops and rewinds, occasionally halting to give way to a grand, glacial string break, à la Moby’s Play. (Madonna had hoped to work with Moby on what would become Music, but plans never came to fruition.) “Don’t Tell Me” began as a demo by Joe Henry, a cult singer-songwriter married to Madonna’s sister Melanie. Henry had written the song “in 25 minutes” in order to test the gear in his new studio; when he played the demo for his wife, she told him she could hear Madonna singing it. Madonna overhauled the track completely, turning it from a noirish, Tom Waits-style tango into something rhythmic, defiant, and contemporary. Although she barely changed Henry’s original lyrics, they play like commentary on her reception in popular culture at the turn of the century. From the moment she turned 40, the media had hungered for signs of Madonna’s imminent irrelevance, but in the song’s simple terms, she refuted any idea that she should be going into middle age quietly: “Don’t tell me to stop/Tell the rain not to drop/Tell the wind not to blow.”\n\nShe was rebellious as ever, but the shift that had occurred on Ray of Light wasn’t just a pose: Madonna was a more benevolent figure now than she had been in the early part of her career. Although she occasionally rolled her eyes at the mention of Britney, she saw her younger self reflected in the new generation of female pop stars, and recognized an opportunity to support them. While promoting Music, she sometimes wore T-shirts that read “Britney Spears” in rhinestones, and used interviews to decry Spears’ treatment in the media. While recording, Madonna said, she’d thought about her own place in the world, at one point realizing that, as she put it to Interview, “Smart, sassy girls who accomplish a lot and have their own cash and are independent are really frightening to men. I felt like ‘Why didn’t somebody tell me? Why didn’t somebody warn me?’”\n\nMusic codifies that warning. Although much of the record is about love and hedonism, another thread runs through songs such as “Amazing” and “Runaway Lover”: the idea that women will often be left high and dry by men, and by the world at large. The apotheosis of this theme arrives during “What It Feels Like for a Girl,” Music’s emotional climax. Produced by Guy Sigsworth, “What It Feels Like for a Girl” is something like Madonna’s take on a Dido ballad, with plush synths wrapped around the album’s purest, most traditional hook. It is a beautiful yet slightly baffling song: For every lyric that’s cutting and totally earnest (“When you open up your mouth to speak/Could you be a little weak?”) there’s a mention of “tight blue jeans” or “lips as sweet as candy.” Then again, it’s not a song of empowerment so much as a plea. Madonna wrote it while in the process of moving to London and hiding her pregnancy, fed up with the fact that she was the one having to make accommodations in her relationship. The lyrics are universal, but still hard to separate from the memory of the brazen, armored pop star who debuted in 1982, so consciously invulnerable to the standards of the world around her.\n\nOn Music, along with Ray of Light and Music’s maligned, arguably misunderstood follow-up American Life, Madonna was at her most analytical and most reflective. She has never written a memoir; these three records do as good a job as any book would, exploring her relationship with her parents, her children, and American culture at large. On “Gone,” Music’s final track, she seemingly makes a pact for the future: “Selling out is not my thing,” she sings. “Turn to stone/Lose my faith/I’ll be gone before it happens.” It was a promise she couldn’t keep. Twenty-three years later, she’s only rarely reached the same artistic heights (2005’s Confessions on a Dance Floor being a notable exception) and was never again as commercially successful: Music sold 4 million copies in its first 10 days of release, and its title track became Madonna’s final Hot 100 No. 1 to date. As the definitive end of an imperial phase, though, Music stands as a document of Madonna’s artistry at its wildest and most free."
