        "text": "Madonna keyboardist Ric’key Pageot agrees. “It has been in the setlist in every world tour I’ve done with her since 2008,” Pageot said at rehearsals for the Madame X tour. “When that song drops, the crowd always goes nuts.”\n\nPageot also noted the way the song builds. “The production was ahead of its time. Each drum sound is introduced layer by layer, starting with the snaps, then the high toms building anticipation. Once that iconic beat drops with that classic TR-909 kick, snare, and hi-hat, it just pounds your chest.”\n\nFinally, there is the song’s now-legendary spoken section—a spontaneous late-game addition. “We wrote down a whole bunch of names of movie stars and that’s how the rap came up,” Pettibone told Billboard. The singer’s recitation has become one of the early ’90s most iconic pop music moments."
