        "text": "Gracie Abrams will follow-up her debut album, Good Riddance, with a sophomore effort, The Secret of Us, set to arrive June 21.\n\nAbrams announced the album and shared the ostensible cover art on Instagram, describing The Secret of Us as “the album that I made with some of my favorite people” (followed by a whole bunch of exclamation points). She added that “Aaron produced the shit out of it” — likely referring to the National’s Aaron Dessner, who helmed Good Riddance — and noted that Abby (ostensibly her cousin and the subject of Abrams’ 2022 holiday demo, “Abby”) photographed the cover.\n\n“We had real, true fun writing this album,” Abrams wrote. “There were also the occasional tears.”\n\nThe first single from The Secret of Us will be “Risk,” which is set to arrive May 1. Abrams said she wrote “Risk” with her best friend/collaborator Audrey Hobert “on our couch at home,” adding: “The music is yours in basically five seconds and we cannot wait. I. Love. You.”\n\nTrending\n\nGood Riddance arrived last February, following Abrams’ two EPs, 2020’s Minor — which featured her breakthrough single, “I Miss You, I’m Sorry” — and 2021’s This Is What It Feels Like. She then spent much of last summer opening for Taylor Swift during the North American leg of the Eras Tour and earned a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist."
