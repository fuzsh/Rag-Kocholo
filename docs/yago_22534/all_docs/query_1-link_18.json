        "text": "1.\n\nRhythm of the Ride 04:33\n\nI had a dream that everyone around me Knew me right from the start And I found the secret hidden in the stars Stay strong my love And I used to think if the world around me Changed I’d get a brand new start That if I went down south I’d make it happen Stay strong my love Say goodbye I know It’s the rhythm of the ride And I know It will be just fine So stay strong my love I know it seems we’re outside of the garden Hearts that have been hardened, closed Into the sea, letting go of gravity Stay strong, my love And I found the key was buried in belief The belly of the beast, the war And if you feel like you might lose the battle Stay strong my love Say goodbye It’s the rhythm of the ride And I know It will be just fine I’d -be just fine So stay strong my love Cause I Rule the night And everything around me that’s still trying to hide Unspotted from the world Say goodbye I know It’s the rhythm of the ride And I know It will be just fine So stay strong my love Cause I Rule the night And everything around me that’s still trying to hide Unspotted from the world\n\n2.\n\nI Choose Me 04:30\n\nIt comes full circle now Things that we left behind The sparks are lifting up, yeah I know that even before it Even when I was lost I had to play the part Say You Will Lift me up if we fall Say Goodbye To the way that we were And I give all of my life To live in paradise I see that it’s the only way And I never before Thought I would Be so strange In this world Say You Will Lift me up if we fall Say Goodbye To the way that we were Everyone says they want to change The steps I walk the roads I take And I’m begging you to grow Instead, I choose me Can’t hide Say You Will Lift me up if we fall Say Goodbye To the way that we were Say you will I choose me\n\n3.\n\nLast Day of August 05:26\n\nI had a dream that I was lost before this weekend Sitting by the fire Dreaming ‘bout love and harmony On the last day of the universe I was taken by surprise and I don’t even know the reason why it happened Not just another day Never know what can happen I had a feeling it was gone before its season Whispering lady Singing about love harmony Came at a cost and I was tossed out of Eden Taken by desire Learning ‘bout love and harmony On the last day of the universe I was taken by surprise and I don’t even know the reason why it happened Not just another day Never know what can happen I was in fear I felt alone In the empty space now In my heart In my soul I was that place now On the last day of the universe I was taken by surprise and I don’t even know the reason why it happened I had a dream that I was lost before this weekend Sitting by the fire Dreaming ‘bout love and harmony On the last day of the universe I was taken by surprise and I don’t even know the reason why it happened\n\n4.\n\nWinter Solstice 04:22\n\nWinter’s coming white with snow And I don’t want to be left behind Seasons they change from the rain to the fire Into the woods where I find my home And I don’t want to know just where the wind goes I don’t want to know How it breathes I don’t want to know Fields are frozen with the cold Bringing stillness to my bones Birds they fly free and the bears go to sleep Into the woods where I find my home And I don’t want to know just where the fear goes I don’t want to know How it breathes I don’t want to know\n\n5.\n\nLies Fade Away 03:45\n\nWhen everything seems to go right There is no reason for a fight I’m laying in the green grass Waiting for fate to take flight When everything else falls apart When everything feels so wrong The hours they are moving on Destroying everything you’ve got Time moves on and earth decays Seasons change When it all feels the same Let the lies fade away Design in disarray The wheels keeps turning on For some the time is lost Take my hand and we can go far Deep into the forest trees I’ll take you to the fountain We’ll live for an eternity Time moves on and earth decays Seasons change When it all feels the same Let the lies fade away I know it’s not too far Time moves on and earth decays Seasons change And if you feel like I feel I want to know what is real I want to know what is real\n\n6.\n\nLive Without You 02:50\n\nThe only thing to stop you now are shadows of above I know when we first met it felt like California Love Summertime, fruit on the vine, I couldn’t get enough I had needs to fill, and that was your thrill, yeah you fit me like a glove But how do I live without you How do I know what’s true How do I be without you Oh give me a reason to stay Insides the only way to find your way out of the dark But these thoughts of you, what will my thumbs do, if we are ever torn apart Believe in me, I’ll take you back to start The screen, it thinks, it knows just who you are But how do I live without you How do I know what’s true How do I be without you Oh give me a reason to stay My whole worlds about you Why do I feel this way Oh how do I be without you Oh give me a reason to stay\n\n7.\n\nRight Stuff 03:19\n\nWalk Down There’s no way around Hope you find what you’re looking for Find the key Open your mind Manage your thoughts I will be there I’ll be your friend I’ll be your friend It’s the way that you feel inside Gave you a river but it’s all run dry Like an ocean looking for a tide It’s in and out and side to side When we go out tonight And the starts are shining bright When you get that look in your eye Yeah lets go, yeah lets go, yeah lets go You’ve got the right stuff baby Yeah it’s the right stuff that you’ve got Even when the clouds blow in from the sea I Still see you in the dark Fall Down It’s the way your found Hope you find what your looking for Find the tree A ladder to climb Above your thoughts Beyond your fears I‘ll be your friend I’ll be your friend It’s the way that you feel inside Gave you a river but it’s all run dry Like an ocean looking for a tide It’s in and out and side to side When we go out tonight And the starts are shining bright When you get that look in your eye Yeah lets go, yeah lets go, yeah lets go You’ve got the right stuff baby Yeah it’s the right stuff that you’ve got Even when the clouds blow in from the sea I Still see you in the dark Gave you a river but it’s all run dry Like an ocean looking for a tide It’s in and out and side to side\n\n8.\n\nDead Sea 04:43\n\nOut in the desert Under the palm trees I feel your gaze Swimming in a dead Sea Persimmon forest Secrets are spoken I’ve been invited Swimming in a dead Sea Half moon it hangs on the horizon Faces in disguise sometimes I lay back down and go to sleep In this heart of mine Mirages Echoes of my thoughts They tempt me to the other side I know it’s never far away In this heart of mine Out in the desert Under the palm trees I feel your gaze Swimming in a dead Sea Persimmon forest Secrets are spoken I feel the warm breeze Swimming in a dead Sea Desire comes out of the darkness Bright flame with a dark wick shines Always together intertwined In this part of me Four hundred layers, enemies Will scatter from the one who sings End this entangled energy In this heart of mine, my love Out in the desert Under the palm trees I feel your gaze Swimming in a dead Sea Persimmon forest Secrets are spoken I hear you laughing Swimming in a dead Sea Out in the desert Under the palm trees I feel your gaze Swimming in a dead Sea Persimmon forest Secrets are spoken Frankincense and Myrrh Swimming in a dead Sea Out in the desert I find myself Out in the ocean Swimming in a dead sea Let it ride, let it be, oh let it in\n\n9.\n\nDiamond in the Cold 04:17\n\nWill you be the one that I call at night Cause when it’s dark I see your light I bet I could even try To see the good inside Keep me honest till you’re here I remember what was far away You’re a diamond in the cold Will you recognize your fire If I whisper your name once or twice If I never look there’s nothing more to find And I knew I could get by With the wool over my eyes You were once on my side When it feels like you are far away You’re a diamond in the cold Will you recognize your fire\n\nI watched you put your black tie on Like you’ve been wearing it without a care for all these years I heard you singing songs aloud With curtains closed, you thought you were all by yourself But who do you think you are, hiding thoughts in to the shadows Who do you think you are, huh? If I’d ever seen your face before I know I would remember The future still remains unknown, what we are shown And how do you know what’s real With that dark veil over your eyes I’ll find the best of you somewhere in time Somewhere in time You think that being lost inside the darkness will keep you safe from being swallowed whole So busy living paralyzed A pioneer, the price you pay for power stolen Who do you think you are Writing books that rule your own mind Who do you think you are huh? If I’d ever seen your face before I know I would remember The future still remains unknown, what we are shown And how do you know what’s real With that dark veil over your eyes I’ll find the best of you somewhere in time Shoot your stares, your arrow, to another beating heart I can see right through you You can pay for no rain on your wedding day I can see right through you If I’d ever seen your face before I know I would remember The future still remains unknown, what we are shown And how do you know what’s real? With that dark veil over your eyes I’ll find the best of you somewhere in time Somewhere in time\n\n11.\n\nThe Yellow Dress 07:00"
