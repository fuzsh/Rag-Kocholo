        "text": "At midnight on Friday, December 3, Joshua Bassett dropped three new tracks, titled “Crisis,” “Secret,” and “Set Me Free.” The trilogy of songs move in a progression, with two of the songs—“Crisis'' and “Secret”—seemingly revealing all of the juicy details about the fallout of his relationship with Olivia Rodrigo. While Joshua and Olivia have never confirmed a romantic relationship, it’s largely believed that Olivia’s debut single, “drivers license,” is a powerful ode to their breakup and Joshua’s single, “Lie Lie Lie,” is a direct response to the song’s release.\n\nIn “Secret,” Joshua sings about knowing the real truth, promising someone “your secret’s safe with me.” Listeners can’t help but speculate that this “secret” he’s keeping belongs to Olivia. If you’re curious yourself, scroll down below for a lyric breakdown of Joshua Bassett’s latest pop ballad.\n\nLyrics provided by Genius.\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nPulled into your driveway again\n\nWe kissed, but it felt different\n\nI shoulda seen it comin', mm-mm-mm-mm\n\nSwore that you only had a crush\n\nYou told me that you would cut him off\n\nI shoulda seen it comin' then, mm-mm-mm-mm\n\nMy friends all warned me I should run for the hills\n\nBut I defended you still\n\n'Cause I knew rumors could kill, oh (Ooh)\n\nThe track starts off with a supposedly direct callout to Olivia’s “drivers license,” which, in case you missed it, is rumored to be all about Joshua. “Drivers license” has repeated references to driving around, with Olivia singing at one point: “‘Cause you were so excited for me / To finally drive up to your house.” The house in question, of course, is believed to be Joshua’s.\n\nBut then he expresses frustration over the song’s subject having a “crush” on someone else. He continues, “You told me that you would cut him off / I shoulda seen it comin’ then.” This seems to suggest that whoever he’s singing about lied to him, and might have even been unfaithful.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOh, your secret's safe with me\n\nAnd him, and all of our friends you told\n\nOh, you don't even know, I know\n\nDon't worry, 'cause I'm keepin' my mouth closed\n\nYeah, your secret's safe with me\n\nAnd him, and everyone else who knows\n\nDarlin', how could you be so cold?\n\nDon't worry, 'cause I'm keepin' my mouth closed\n\nYeah, your sеcret's safe with me\n\nIn the chorus, he continues to dig into the lie he’s been told about this other guy, claiming that he’ll keep quiet. But he hints that others outside the situation know about this secret too: “Oh, your secret’s safe with me / And him, and all of our friends you told.”\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nI rеally hope you had your fun, good for you foolin' everyone\n\nYou had me tricked for sixteen months\n\nOh, your smoke and mirrors had me hypnotized\n\nRight in front of my eyes\n\nWell, I heard the truth last night\n\nIs the first line of this second verse calling out “good 4 u,” Olivia’s breakup anthem? “I really hope you had your fun, good for you foolin’ everyone.”\n\nJoshua then sings, “You had me tricked for sixteen months.” OK, let’s do some math. High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, which Joshua and Olivia starred in, premiered in November 2019. Olivia’s debut single, “drivers license,” was released in January 2021. Maybe Olivia and Joshua started getting close leading up to the HSMTMTS premiere, in October 2019. Fast forward sixteen months from October 2019 and boom, we’re in January 2021—“drivers license” is released.\n\nThis is, of course, all speculative, but something to think about.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYour secret's safe with me\n\nAnd him, and all of our friends you told\n\nOh, you don't even know, I know\n\nDon't worry, 'cause I'm keepin' my mouth closed\n\nYeah, your secret's safe with me\n\nAnd him, and everyone else who knows\n\nDarlin', how could you be so cold?\n\nDon't worry, 'cause I'm keepin' my mouth closed\n\n[Bridge]\n\nWhen your \"Woe is me\" stops workin'\n\nI bet your songs won't sound the same\n\nThe truth you can't deny changed everything\n\nOh, you can't hide behind what's clear as day\n\nIn the bridge, Joshua appears to call out “Sour”—Olivia’s album that’s devoted to their relationship and breakup—with those first two lines: “When your ‘Woe is me’ stops workin’ / I bet your songs won’t sound the same.”"
