The singer claimed she was \"madly in love with him\" despite him treating her like \"s***.\" One fan posted a video of the confession to X, captioned, \"Madonna spilling hot tea.\"\n\n\"I'm just saying, you did, you dogged me, bro,\" Madonna said. \"It's ok, I understand. You were just a boy. But I hope you've grown up by now.\n\n\"I am publicly shaming you. Did I say your name yet? His name is Dallas Austin.\"\n\nAt the time, Madonna was 35, and Austin was 23. Austin is known for producing hit songs such as The Boy is Mine by Brandy and Monica and Creep by TLC.\n\nMadonna also told how obsessed she was with Austin to the point of performing witchcraft.\n\n\"I am telling you, I was so in love with him that I had this house in Miami, and I studied with this Santeria.
