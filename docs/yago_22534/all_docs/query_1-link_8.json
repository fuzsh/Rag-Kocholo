        "text": "The singer and songwriter Yebba has a story she tells about the moment she realized she was fated to pursue a career in music.\n\nIt was the summer after her freshman year of college, and she was working at a warehouse, taking apart laptops. She’d started posting clips of her singing to Instagram, and they were beginning to get traction around the internet. One day after work, she was jogging alongside a bean field near her childhood home in Arkansas, and thinking about what the future might entail, when it happened.\n\nIn a recent video interview, she was reflexively self-aware about how this might sound. “I’m just going to put it in the way that I know how to say it, because I don’t really talk in churchy language as much anymore,” she said, her eyes wandering around her room before making direct contact. “But I really did feel the Lord say, from my stomach, ‘I do want you to be a singer.’ And I had this moment where I just stopped running, and I sat down and prayed, just laying in the dirt.”\n\nWhat followed was not unique among singers who’ve broken out in the digital era. Virality brought surprise attention from established stars like Missy Elliott and Timbaland, which led to invitations to collaborate with other established stars and move to New York, where dreams are made of, as the song goes. But what Yebba, now 26, did next is unusual: She didn’t rush out a debut album with a phalanx of young writers and producers. She waited.\n\nAfter around five years of focusing on her mental health, navigating the pitfalls of the music industry and recording take after take until listening back to her singing was no longer what she called “very embarrassing,” she will release her debut LP, “Dawn,” on Friday. And the spiritual connection that guided Yebba to her career has helped her take her time, regardless of how many people have said “hurry up.”\n\n“I just don’t give a damn,” she said of the expectations placed on her as her career has slowly taken shape. Over two interviews Yebba spoke with consideration and purpose, often pausing for several seconds to collect a thought. Occasionally, she would tear up when the conversation turned serious, only to crack a joke a moment later. At one point, she showed off some of the art hanging in her Chelsea apartment: an abstract painting by the artist Sean Shrum, and a green print she jokingly brushed off as “a basic bitch purchase from Anthropologie.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
