        "text": "Who better than Madonna to talk about her own career? While Elton John was involved in the making of Rocketman as a producer, the singer takes it one step further. Rather than leaving another in charge, the seven Grammy and thirty MTV award-winning artist is taking the reigns as the director and co-writer of a biopic dedicated to herself. Madonna has always been part of the media landscape and has not hesitated to reveal herself to the general public more than once, now she finally feels ready to share her \"incredible journey\". In a statement posted on the artist's website she believes that music will always be at the center of her film because without music Madonna would not be Madonna.\n\nA cathartic project\n\nEccentric, sulfurous, rebellious ... Madonna has known many labels which served her career and which she has had no trouble playing. But behind the glitter curtain hides a personality that few really know. For the artist, getting involved in this biopic is necessary. On Instagram, she explains that she wants to “convey the incredible journey that life has taken me on as an artist, a musician, a dancer—a human being, trying to make her way in this world.” To write the script, she goes back to her own music archives using old cassettes and old recordings. Her arrival in New York with $35 in her pocket, her tough encounters, the pangs of fame ... if music is the main element of the film, Madonna also wants to share darker episodes of her life that continue to haunt her.\n\nThe casting\n\nWith an explosive and perfectionist personality that no longer surprises anyone, Madonna does not intend to lead this large-scale project alone. On the contrary, she has surrounded herself with a five-star team, starting with a renowned screenwriter: Diablo Cody, who won the 2008 Oscar for the film Juno with Ellen Page. Alongside him, producer Amy Pascal also joins the project. Known for the last Spider-Man or the Little Women of Greta Gerwig, Amy Pascal had already worked with Madonna in A League of Their Own in 1992. As a reminder, this is not Madonna's first attempt at cinema. She began a successful acting career in 1985 in Desperately Seeking Susan, followed by accolades in 1996 when she received the Golden Globe for Best Actress for her role as Eva Perón in Evita. Since then, the multitalented artist has starred in numerous feature films and directed and co-wrote WE, her first film in 2011. Although the biopic on her own life is a high-flying exercise, Madonna seems to have the support of the industry since Universal Pictures is already vouching for its success. Although for now the project is in the writing stage, the big question that everyone is asking remains: who will be chosen by Madonna herself to play the artist in the cinema? According to the latest news, Julia Garner (Inventing Anna), Barbie Ferreira and Sydney Sweeney (Euphoria) have all passed the casting. To be continued."
