        "text": "\"Electric Touch\" is a long-awaited duet with Fall Out Boy.\n\nWritten by: Taylor Swift\n\nProduced by: Aaron Dessner, Taylor Swift\n\nLore: Broadly speaking, \"Electric Touch\" seems to describe the excitement and anxiety before going on a first date.\n\nThematically, it compliments \"Begin Again,\" the closing track on the next album Swift would write, \"Red.\"\n\nHere, Swift looks to the future, telling herself that despite her past heartbreaks, \"all it takes is to get it right just one time.\" In \"Begin Again,\" her theory is proven correct: \"I've been spending the last eight months / Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end / But on a Wednesday in a caf√© / I watched it begin again.\"\n\n\"Electric Touch\" also includes a lot of Swift's favorite imagery, scenes that reappear many times throughout her discography: a car in the driveway (\"Treacherous,\" \"Style\"), a metaphorical ghost town (\"My Tears Ricochet,\" \"Anti-Hero\"), a rain-soaked rendezvous (\"Sparks Fly,\" \"How You Get the Girl,\" \"Me!\"), and a specific time of night (\"Mine,\" \"Enchanted,\" \"Last Kiss,\" \"I Bet You Think About Me,\" \"I Wish You Would\").\n\nTrivia: Swift has a long history as a Fall Out Boy fan, starting when she performed an acoustic cover of \"Sugar, We're Going Down\" on the Speak Now World Tour. She told the crowd that she became obsessed with the song during her freshman year of high school, driving around with her best friend, Abigail.\n\nA few years later, Swift enlisted Fall Out Boy's frontman Patrick Stump for a surprise cameo during the Red Tour. They also performed together at the 2013 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\n\nThen, in a 2019 interview with Rolling Stone, Swift cited the emo-rock band as one of her biggest inspirations.\n\n\"I love Fall Out Boy so much. Their songwriting really influenced me, lyrically, maybe more than anyone else,\" she said. \"They take a phrase and they twist it. 'Loaded God complex / Cock it and pull it'? When I heard that, I was like, 'I'm dreaming.'\"\n\nBest lyrics: \"I've gotten used to no one calling my phone / I've grown accustomed to sleeping alone / Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right / Just one time, just one time.\"\n\n\"When Emma Falls In Love\" may have (probably) been inspired by Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin.\n\nWritten by: Taylor Swift\n\nProduced by: Aaron Dessner, Taylor Swift\n\nLore: To our knowledge, Emma Stone is the most prominent Emma in Swift's life.\n\nThe two met in 2008 and became fast friends. In fact, Stone was one of the few lucky people that heard \"Speak Now\" before its original release.\n\nWe know that Swift wrote most of \"Speak Now\" between 2008 and 2010. During that timeline, Stone split from Teddy Geiger, her partner of two years, and met Kieran Culkin on the set of the superhero comedy \"Paper Man,\" in which they played a couple.\n\nRumors of a real-life romance between Stone and Culkin began swirling in early 2010. They never publicly confirmed their relationship, but reportedly went their separate ways in 2011 when Stone was filming \"The Amazing Spider-Man.\"\n\nFans even resurfaced old interview footage of Swift saying that if she could be one other person for a day, it would be Stone, whom she described as \"one of my really, really good friends.\" (In the song, Swift sings, \"Sometimes I wish I was her.\")\n\nTrivia: Swift and Stone remain close to this day. In fact, the \"Easy A\" actor was recently spotted dancing her heart out at the opening night of the Eras Tour.\n\n\"I was lucky 'cause we've been friends for a really long time,\" Stone told Vanity Fair. \"I've known her since we were 17 and 18, so she hooked me up, which was very nice 'cause I know those tickets are impossible to get.\"\n\nShe also called Swift a \"wonderful friend.\"\n\nBest lyrics: \"She's the kind of book that you can't put down / Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town.\"\n\n\"I Can See You\" may have a music video coming soon.\n\nWritten by: Taylor Swift\n\nProduced by: Jack Antonoff, Taylor Swift\n\nLore: In \"I Can See You,\" Swift posits that love worth chasing is also worth keeping a secret. She will revisit this theme many times, especially throughout \"1989\" and \"Reputation.\"\n\nLyrics like \"What would you do if they never found us out?\" and \"Passed me a note saying, 'Meet me tonight' / Then we kissed and you know I won't ever tell\" recall songs like \"I Know Places,\" \"Delicate,\" \"Dancing With Our Hands Tied,\" and \"Illicit Affairs.\"\n\nTrivia: Based on Spotify playlist placements, \"I Can See You\" is being promoted as the lead single for \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version).\"\n\nBack in April, Swift was spotted filming a music video in London with Joey King, who previously starred in the 2010 music video for \"Mean,\" another \"Speak Now\" single.\n\nAccording to reports, the shoot was inspired by 2022's \"The Batman\" and includes a scene with Swift pulling off a heist; in \"I Can See You,\" Swift refers to herself as \"a secret mission.\"\n\nThe music video has yet to materialize. Could it be coming soon?\n\nBest lyrics: \"They keep watchful eyes on us / So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet / You won't believe half the things I see inside my head / Wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet.\"\n\n\"Castles Crumbling,\" featuring Hayley Williams, recalls Swift's infamous incident with Kanye West at the VMAs.\n\nWritten by: Taylor Swift\n\nProduced by: Jack Antonoff, Taylor Swift\n\nLore: On top of its semantic connection to the opening lyric of \"Call It What You Want\" (\"My castle crumbled overnight\"), \"Castles Crumbling\" is the newest addition to Swift's collection of self-loathing songs, joining the likes of \"The Archer,\" \"Mirrorball,\" \"Nothing New,\" and \"Anti-Hero.\"\n\nIn the bridge, Swift refers to herself as a \"monster,\" echoing the image she paints of herself in \"Anti-Hero\" (\"Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby / And I'm a monster on the hill\").\n\nThe song is particularly reminiscent of \"Nothing New,\" a vault track from the \"Red\" era. Both songs feature a female singer and close friend. Both songs are self-written by Swift as she grapples with a particular kind of self-doubt, caused by the glare of a spotlight in her eyes.\n\nIn the first verse of \"Castles Crumbling,\" Swift sings: \"Once, I had an empire in a golden age / I was held up so high, I used to be great / They used to cheer when they saw my face / Now, I fear I have fallen from grace.\"\n\nThis scene may refer to the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) interrupted Swift's acceptance speech and insulted her onstage.\n\nIn the Netflix documentary \"Miss Americana,\" Swift revealed that she misinterpreted the crowd's anger with Ye and assumed they were booing her.\n\n\"For someone who based her whole belief system on getting everyone to clap for you, the whole crowd booing is a pretty informative experience,\" Swift said, adding that she was \"living for the approval of strangers\" from a very young age.\n\nIn the physical booklet for \"Speak Now,\" she refers to this as \"the mic-grab seen around the world.\"\n\n\"I had the nagging sense that in the most intense moments of my life, I had frozen. I had said nothing publicly,\" she wrote. \"I still don't know if it was out of instinct, not wanting to seem impolite, or just overwhelming fear. But I made sure to say it in all these songs.\"\n\nTrivia: Swift's incident with Ye also inspired the \"Speak Now\" track \"Innocent.\" She returned to the VMAs in 2010 to perform the song.\n\n\"It's OK, life is a tough crowd / 32 and still growing up now,\" she sings.\n\nSerendipitously, Swift was 32 when she recorded \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version).\"\n\nBest lyrics: \"Power went to my head and I couldn't stop / Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off / And here I sit alone behind walls of regret / Falling down like promises that I never kept.\"\n\n\"Foolish One\" is about making stupid mistakes when you're 19.\n\nWritten by: Taylor Swift\n\nProduced by: Aaron Dessner, Taylor Swift\n\nLore: \"Foolish One\" is a self-aware song about Swift's own romanticism. She reminds herself not to place trust in someone who doesn't deserve it.\n\n\"The voices say, 'You are not the exception / You will never learn your lesson,'\" she sings.\n\nEven though \"Foolish One\" wasn't released until now, Swift references this very lyric in the \"Red\" track \"Girl at Home\" (\"Honey, I am no one's exception / This, I have previously learned\").\n\nShe also refers to her romantic situation as \"delicate\" in the second verse. Years later, she would turn this concept into an entire song.\n\nTrivia: Swift eventually forgave herself for being \"foolish\" and making mistakes in her youth.\n\n\"It's good to mess up and learn from it and take risks,\" she wrote for Elle in 2019. \"It's especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That's GOOD. We'll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace.\"\n\n\"No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now,\" she continued. \"That's not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you'll learn from it. Then you'll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it's fine; do you, you're searching.\"\n\nBest lyrics: \"'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings / I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring / And you will say you had the best of intentions / And maybe I will finally learn my lesson.\"\n\n\"Timeless\" has connections to other songs like \"Mine,\" \"Starlight,\" and \"Majorie.\"\n\nWritten by: Taylor Swift\n\nProduced by: Jack Antonoff, Taylor Swift\n\nLore: \"Timeless,\" the closing track on \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version),\" plays like a companion to \"Mine,\" the album's famous opener. (In \"Timeless,\" she even uses the word \"mine\" six times.)\n\nBoth songs toy with the concept of fate, acting as bookends for the album. In \"Mine,\" Swift paints a picture of the future she could share with her muse, falling in love and sharing a home together.\n\n\"This is a situation where a guy that I just barely knew put his arm around me by the water, and I saw the entire relationship flash before my eyes, almost like a weird science-fiction movie,\" she told Yahoo! Music at the time.\n\n\"Timeless\" is a similar kind of escapist fantasy. Swift imagines her relationship in different historical contexts ‚Äî a crowded street in 1944, a school dance in 1958, a foreign land in the 16th century ‚Äî and concludes they still would've fallen in love, whatever the circumstances.\n\nSwift would revisit this time-traveling conceit in songs like \"Starlight,\" which was inspired by an old photo she saw of Ethel and Robert Kennedy as teenagers, and \"Ivy,\" which fans theorize was inspired by Emily Dickinson and Sue Gilbert.\n\n\"Timeless\" also seems to share a connection with a previous vault track, \"When Emma Falls In Love.\"\n\nIn the former, Swift sings about a special kind of love, \"the kind you don't put down.\" In the latter, she describes Emma in the same terms: \"She's the kind of book that you can't put down.\"\n\nTrivia: The official lyric video for \"Timeless\" includes photos of Swift's grandparents, Majorie and Robert Finlay.\n\nHer grandmother, an opera singer who died in 2003, also served as the inspiration for the beloved \"Evermore\" track, \"Majorie.\"\n\nBest lyrics: \"That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs / Story of a romance torn apart by fate / Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did / And I'd die for you in the same way, if I first saw your face / In the 1500s off in a foreign land / And I was forced to marry another man / You still would've been mine.\""
