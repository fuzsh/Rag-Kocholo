        "text": "There's a rumour that she's working with Stuart Price again and this is according to someone with a history of getting things spot on. Good news if true because if the core of the album is Price songs then it'll be excellent as they create magic together..of course he won't be the only producer though so it'll be interesting to see what else happens\n\nYes...something i loved about their team ups....i mean Price was in her band in 2001 onwards so he has really branched out with M from there...it is the fact that he and M really had so much fun working on Confessions and it was a massive break out...while Confessios is its own masterstroke i do not want a COADF 2.0....but rather would be awesome to see where the pair take it all next...i do actually hope this is true as Orbit kinda got stuck in a rut i believe....but M and Price really does intrigue me.\n\nAgain hopefully it will stem into new areas :cool:\n\n0\n\nYou know i do too hope this rumour is a true one because this will work for so many reasons.\n\nI mean it fits the \"three times charm\" kinda rule Pat Leonard (TB, LAP, ROL), Bray (LAV, TB, LAP), Pettibone (YCD, TIC, Erotica), Orbit (ROL, Music, MDNA), Mirwais (Music, AL, COAF) so Price (AL, COADF...Album 13??)\n\nAlso Price really brought Madonna out of a rut where American politics was against her and she wanted to really branch out....and sonically COADF was a phenomenal parallel to the Drowned World era/AL era and ever since the break of the past 5 years from Price he has worked with The Killers on a very Stadium Rock feel and Alternative Dance feel....and due to his phenomenal work with M he has also worked with Scissor Sisters, Kylie and Take That as well as Brandon Flowers solo material...and with Battle Born it seems Price has got his groove back again....and i really feel its time he really motivated M again and she pushed his sound further too....making a distinctive new Madonna SOund as well as a new direction and sound for Pop music.\n\nI am so ready or that\n\n0\n\nYes, I think it's great if she works with Stuart. From watching I'm Going to Tell you a Secret, they had great chemistry and a fun relationship together. I don't know if she's had the same great relationship with her recent producers.\n\nYES! I love that in the Doc film too...M and Price mixing in the studio is sublime to see...and like she said...they were like the odd couple when they did sessions in his house\n\nIts that kinda brotherly sisterly kinship that really works with Madonna i feel like when she worked with Leonard and previously on ROL with Orbit...with Price that really shines through and you could hear on COADF the fun they had and the idea of going crazy with ideas for sounds and styles and lyrics and vocals etc....its that vibe i feel we will need again with the pair again\n\nBeautiful. I look forward to confirmed news soon...i feel this is a definite direction to head though without retreading the same ground as Confessions but man the idea of Bluesy Rock meets Alternative Dance and Stadium Sonics man i feel we are very much ready for this...the wheel to move forward :cool:\n\n0"
