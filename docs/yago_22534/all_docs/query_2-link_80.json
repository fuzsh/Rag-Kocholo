I do! I love him, I love him! And I don't care what you think.\n\nI love him for the man he wants to be, and I love him for the man that he almost is.\n\nI love him, Laurel. I love him! I love him.\n\nShe'll let you in her house\n\nIf you come knocking late at night\n\nShe'll let you in her mouth\n\nIf the words you say are right\n\nIf you pay the price\n\nShe'll let you deep inside\n\nBut there's a secret garden she hides\n\n[Rod Tidwell:]\n\nYou gotta be fair to her. She loves you. If you don't love her, you got to tell her.\n\nShe'll let you in her car\n\nTo go driving 'round\n\nShe'll let you into the parts of herself\n\nThat'll bring you down\n\nShe'll let you in her heart\n\nIf you got a hammer and a vise\n\nBut into her secret garden, don't think twice\n\n[Jerry Maguire:]\n\nWhat if we got married? If I said that, would you stay?\n\n[Dorothy Boyd:]\n\nOh no. Don't do that. Don't say that unless…\n\nYou've gone a million miles\n\n[Dorothy Boyd:]\n\nWell… Say it if you want to.\n\nHow far'd you get\n\n[Jerry Maguire:]\n\nWill you marry me?\n\nTo that place where you can't remember\n\n[Jerry Maguire:]\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAnd you can't forget\n\n[Dorothy Boyd:]\n\nLaurel? We're getting married!\n\nShe'll lead you down a path\n\nThere'll be tenderness in the air\n\nShe'll let you come just far enough\n\nSo you know she's really there\n\nAnd she'll look at you and smile\n\nAnd her eyes will say\n\nShe's got a secret garden\n\nWhere everything you want\n\nWhere everything you need\n\nWill always stay a million miles away\n\n[priest:]\n\nDo you, Jerry McGuire, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? And do you…\n\n[Dorothy Boyd:]\n\nNo, not now, sweetheart.\n\n[priest:]\n\nDorothy Boyd take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? I now pronounce you husband and wife.\n\n[Dorothy Boyd:]\n\nI pretended that proposal by the car was real, and it might have just been a hypothetical.\n\nI did this. And at least I can do something about it now.\n\n[Jerry Maguire:]\n\nSo this break is a breakup?\n\nIt's…\n\n[Dorothy Boyd:]\n\nCome on, Jerry. You know this isn't easy for me.\n\n[Jerry Maguire:]\n\nKay. Okay.\n\nIf this is where it has to end then this is where it has to end.\n\nI'm not letting you get rid of me.\n\nHow about that?\n\nI miss my wife.\n\nI love you.\n\nYou complete me.\n\nAnd I'm just, I…\n\n[Dorothy Boyd:]\n\nShut up. Just shut up.\n\nYou had me at hello.\n\nYou had me at hello."
