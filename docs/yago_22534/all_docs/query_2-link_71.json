        "text": "A true-crime docuseries has left Brits 'traumatised' - and hungry for justice.\n\nCan I Tell You a Secret? launched on Netflix last week (February 21), and follows the story of one of the UK's most prolific cyberstalkers. The two-part series profiles three victims subjected to relentless harassment by Matthew Hardy - who used fake social media profiles to 'spread relationship-ending lies about them'.\n\nSome of Hardy's victims were so frightened by his psychological warfare they slept with weapons to feel safe, and although he was prosecuted by the police for his actions - it took more than a decade to get him jailed. The Netflix show, based on Sirin Kale's investigation for The Guardian, dives into the victims' dragging path to justice and has sparked national outrage.\n\n\"Three women's lives are changed forever when a prolific stalker infiltrates their social media accounts. And they're only a fraction of his many victims,\" the show's description reads. \"In the face of mounting evidence and an ever-growing number of victims, how did Hardy manage to get away with his crimes for over a decade?\"\n\nUpon watching the show, which quickly climbed to the top of Netflix's charts, hundreds of social media users were left terrified. \"Can I Tell You a Secret? on Netflix is haunting, and highlights the endemic of police failing female victims of crime,\" one person wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter ).\n\nAnother commented: \"It's absolutely terrifying, I'm only one episode in but it's CRAZY.\" While a third added: \"This Can I Tell You a Secret? documentary is terrifying. As someone who uses social media to share a lot of my life, it really has frightened me into what I do and don't share going forward.\"\n\nWant the latest Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video news?

It is thought that between 2011 and 2022, the man stalked more than 62 women.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Hardy would message women with the opening line \"Can I tell you a secret?\" before claiming to have private information about their life - such as adultery or talking behind a friend's back. If the woman blocked the anonymous messenger, they'd received 'incessant calls from someone breathing down the phone'.\n\nThe stalker then spread lies about the victims to friends, family and colleagues - and would also pose as the victim while having sexually explicit conversations. Hardy even stole initial photographs of one victim - and caused women to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety. In January 2022, he was sentenced to nine years in prison for five counts of stalking."
