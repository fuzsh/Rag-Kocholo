10 years ago today, Madonna released her first live album, one which shares its title – and, indeed, its music – from a documentary about her music which had been released nine months earlier.

It might be surprising to some that it took Madonna so many years into her career to release a live album, but when you consider how prolific she’s always been as a recording artist, it’s not like she ever needed one to fill the void between studio albums. Plus, I’m Going to Tell You a Secret was a relatively low-impact affair in terms of its release, since – as noted – the songs had already been recorded and mixed for the behind-the-scenes documentary about her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour.

I’m Going to Tell You a Secret definitely captures Madonna at a very precise moment in her musical career, leaning heavily on her more recent material – “American Life,” “Die Another Day,” and “Music” are but three tracks which leap to mind on that front – while offering a limited number of classic tracks. Not that there are any complaints about the decision to include “Vogue,” “Like a Prayer,” “Into the Groove,” and “Holiday” in the mix, but it’s definitely not what you would call a full-fledged greatest-hits set. Additionally, the latter two tracks have been arranged in a new fashion, making them fit better into the overall feel of the show, so it’s clear that Madonna was making a statement: this is who I am now. The end result of this statement, however, was a success, with Rolling Stone making note of how the performance revealed Madonna to be a better singer than one might have realized without having heard her in concert.
