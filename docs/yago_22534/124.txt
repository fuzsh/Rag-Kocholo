Madonna is about to tell you 2 secrets. The first one is that her tour documentary will be officially released on June 20 as a CD+DVD set. While the DVD features the full tour documentary and exclusive bonus footage, the CD brings you some of the live songs performed during the show in studio quality. Madonna's second secret is that she wants some lucky ICONers to get this new release before the rest of the world!

Want to receive the I'm Going To Tell You A Secret CD+DVD at home and before its official release date?* Ok, here is the deal: Send us a picture of you or of you and your friends taken at one of the Re-Invention shows and e-mail it with your full member info (including your name, mailing address and member username) to icon@moov-u-mail.com before 10 AM (PST) on Wed, June 14th. Only 1 picture per entry please.
