        "text": "The ranks of first-time feature film directors, a category long dominated by film school fledglings and young music-video auteurs, are being infiltrated by a new demographic: the middle-aged cinephile.\n\n\"When I started 10 years ago, all the first-time directors were 24 or 25,\" said Gill Holland, 40, a Manhattan-based producer. \"But this year, four of the six films I've produced are directed by first-timers over 40. Investors want the director to bring substance to the table.\"\n\nMr. Holland's projects include \"Mentor,\" starring Rutger Hauer and directed by David Langlitz, 52, the principal trombonist for the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and \"Sweet Land,\" starring Ned Beatty and directed by Ali Selim, 44, (at left, center, with the actors Alan Cumming and Alex Kingston). (Both films were scheduled to play last week at the Hamptons International Film Festival.) Mr. Selim said he could not have made his film 20 years ago. \"It's a gentle story about deep love and the stewardship of your ethnic identity,\" he said. \"I only understand those issues now.\"\n\nMiddle age gave Lucile Hadzihalilovic, 44, a French film editor and the filmmaking partner of the controversial director Gaspar No√©, enough confidence to command a set. \"I really hate conflict, \" she said. \"I had to learn to fight with people.\" Her film, \"Innocence,\" a subtly erotic parable about girls at boarding school, opens today at Cinema Village in Manhattan.\n\nFilm stock may well be wasted on the young. \"I'm glad I didn't get a chance to make movies in my 20's or 30's because I was a very bad writer,\" said Paul Haggis, 52, the screenwriter and director of \"Crash,\" which was released last spring. \"You get one shot.\"\n\nAndrew Wagner, 42, who is self-distributing his first feature film, \"The Talent Given Us,\" is philosophical about his deferred debut. \"When you're young, you're in search of your identity,\" he said. \"Now I want to be part of the dialogue that brings meaning to people's lives.\"\n\nELLEN MAGUIRE"
