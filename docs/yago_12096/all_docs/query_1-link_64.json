        "text": "Ali Selim was tapped to direct Secret InvasionâMarvelâs six-episode limited series on Disney+âprecisely because of his work on spycraft historical fiction. But it seems like his focus on the âgroundedâ world of Secret Invasion meant that he didnât think much about the superheroes flying around in the rest of the MCU.\n\nTalking to The Hollywood Reporter, Selim admits that he wasnât really concerned with what Fury would be doing in The Marvels, the November film that will feature the Marvels Khan, Danvers, and Rambeau. âItâs just simply, âWhere do you need [Fury]? You need him here? Great.â And then we write into that. So that kind of stuff is very simple because itâs all above my pay grade.â\n\nHe also states that Marvelâs process for writing and working on these kinds of projects is âvery different fromâ what heâs experienced before. The studio goes âafter story until it is clear, thrilling and emotional, and to be on that ride with them was instructive and rewarding.â\n\nÂ"
