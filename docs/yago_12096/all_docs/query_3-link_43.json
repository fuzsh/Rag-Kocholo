        "text": "Le Tour de Pants, with Ali Selim\n\n23rd TDF: International Premiere\n\nWhen Alexi Grewal won gold in the 1984 Olympics, it wasn't because he was wearing spandex. However, after the photo finish, bike shops across the USA were flooded with new faces frantic to buy the miracle material shorts. Filmmaker Ali Selim was one of the only few keen enough to understand why Grewal actually won.\n\nScreening Schedule\n\nNo physical screenings scheduled.\n\nDirection: Lewie & Noah Kloster\n\nScript: Ali Selim\n\nProduction: Tall Glass with Ice Productions\n\nProducers: Lewie & Noah Kloster\n\nNarration: Lewie & Noah Kloster\n\nFormat: Digital File\n\nColor: Color\n\nProduction Country: USA\n\nProduction Year: 2020\n\nDuration: 4΄\n\nContact: Tall Glass with Ice Productions\n\nAnimation: Lewie & Noah Kloster\n\nLewie & Noah Kloster\n\nLewie and Noah Kloster are a brother animation / directing duo. Born and raised in the frozen north of the midwestern United States, old Hollywood films became their primary form of education. Their mother would often help them play hooky from school in order to watch an upcoming film on Turner Classic Movies. Robert Osbourne and Ben Mankowitz became their teachers. Their favorite were those by Stanley Donen, Karl Freund, Howard Hawks, and films like Night of the Hunter, The Cabinet of Dr. Kaligari, and Peewee’s Big Adventure.\n\nWithout budgets, animation was the only way they were able to match the size, scale, and scope of their favorite imposing filmmakers. Retreating to how animation felt before the digital age claimed king over the medium, cardboard, construction paper, cotton balls, and magic markers fill their studio to its brim. Since moving to New York City in 2013, everyday real life people have become their subjects. The city has plenty to offer. Accompanied by their dual perspectives, they are constantly digging for contemporary stories that fit within their frenzied tactile animated worlds.\n\nFilmography\n\n2016 Legal Smuggling, with Christine Choy (short)\n\n2017 Devil in a Fancy Dress (short)\n\n2018 Slinging Hash, with Laurie Lindeen (short)\n\n2019 Stick ’Em Up, with Adam Lucas (short)\n\n2020 Le Tour de Pants, with Ali Selim (short)\n\n2020 Shots in the Dark, with David Godlis (short)\n\n2020 That Time I Went to Jail (short)\n\n2021 Stranger than Rotterdam, with Sara Driver (short)"
