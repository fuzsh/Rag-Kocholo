        "text": "After Film London mentioning that production has begun this month on Marvel’s Secret Invasion series, it looks like the big project has nabbed a film industry veteran to handle the show’s extensive visual effects.\n\nThe Ronin has learned that visual effects supervisor John Moffatt has joined the series. Moffatt is best known for strictly film work with some impressive credits such as Harry Potter & The Half-Blood Prince, Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows 1-2, Wonder Woman 1984, Life, The Brothers Grimsby, and Snow White & The Huntsman.\n\nThe impressive cast consists of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ben Mendelsohn as Skrull Leader Talos, Oscar-winner Olivia Colman (The Favourite, Hot Fuzz, The Crown), four-time Emmy nominee Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones, Solo: A Star Wars Story), Kingsley Ben-Adir (One Night In Miami, Peaky Blinders) said to be playing a villain, and most recent addition to the Marvel series is character actor Christopher McDonald (Hacks, Happy Gilmore).\n\nThis would again suggest that Secret Invasion might be a bit bigger than previous Disney+ shows.\n\nSecret Invasion is a big event in Marvel Comics, where it’s revealed that Skrulls have quietly replaced various leaders and even superheroes in a bid to invade Earth. As with other MCU adaptations, it’s assumed that the studio will have its own take on the source material for the live-action incarnation.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see if they’ll indeed reveal that beloved characters were Skrulls the entire time or during the events of Infinity War/Endgame, which may or may not ruffle feathers depending on who they pick for that.\n\nWe previously confirmed Secret Invasion’s crew would include production designer Frank Walsh (Lost In Space) and cinematographer SylvaineDufaux (Solo: A Star Wars Story, Future Man).\n\nKyle Bradstreet (Mr. Robot) is the MCU show’s head writer with directors Thomas Bezhucha (Let Him Go) and Ali Selim (The Looming Tower) shooting episodes.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson has already confirmed on Instagram that he’s shot scenes for Nia DaCosta’s The Marvels (currently in production at Longcross Studios), which further illustrates the expected cross-pollination between the casts given their similar shooting schedules and proximity as both are filming in the London area.\n\nSecret Invasion is aiming to be ready for release on Disney+ sometime in 2022.\n\nWe recently confirmed Marvel Studios’ big crossover event series Secret Invasion’s crew would include production designer Frank Walsh (Lost In Space) and cinematographer SylvaineDufaux (Solo: A Star Wars Story, Future Man).\n\nThere is word from Film London that production has indeed started this month on Secret Invasion.\n\nThe impressive cast consists of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ben Mendelsohn as Skrull Leader Talos, Oscar-winner Olivia Colman (The Favourite, Hot Fuzz, The Crown), four-time Emmy nominee Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones, Solo: A Star Wars Story), Kingsley Ben-Adir (One Night In Miami, Peaky Blinders) said to be playing a villain, and most recent addition to the Marvel series is character actor Christopher McDonald (Hacks, Happy Gilmore).\n\nThe show’s head writer is Kyle Bradstreet with directors Thomas Bezhucha (Let Him Go) and Ali Selim (The Looming Tower) shooting episodes.\n\nAlso, we have some updates concerning the reshoots for Hawkeye.\n\nHollywood North Buzz is relaying information from Production Weekly that claims that the Hawkeye series (working title Anchor Point) will be doing some brief reshoots in Toronto, where Jeremy Renner is filming his other series Mayor of Kingstown.\n\nThe Ronin can confirm this information along with adding our own that directors Rhys Thomas and new addition Tim Roche (It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, Silicon Valley) will be involved with the two days of filming that kick-off today. Roche has been an editor on WandaVision and Hawkeye, but has directing experience on sitcoms.\n\nBert and Bertie are also part of the show’s directing team.\n\nJoining Renner includes actors such as Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Brian D’Arcy James, Vera Farmiga, Fra Fee, Tony Dalton, Zahn McClarnon, and newcomer Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez aka Echo (getting her own spinoff series).\n\nThe six-episode MCU series originally wrapped filming back in April with a crew that includes production designer Maya Shimoguchi (The Matrix Resurrections, War For The Planet of Apes), cinematographer Eric Steelberg (Ghostbusters: Afterlife) and Heidi Moneymaker (Guardians of The Galaxy Vol.3) as the show’s stunt coordinator.\n\nHawkeye will debut on Disney+ starting November 24 and Secret Invasion should be ready in late 2022.\n\nSOURCE: FILM LONDON & HOLLYWOOD NORTH BUZZ\n\nMarvel Studios is pumping out a multitude of Disney+ shows with a heap of new ones that are likely going to be announced before the end of the year. Next on the docket to go into production is Marvel’s big Skrull event, Secret Invasion, and we have a tiny production update to share.\n\nThe Ronin is hearing that with production expected to begin this month (under the working title Jambalaya) it won’t be just filming in the London area as a portion may spend time in Scotland.\n\nHowever, where in Scotland hasn’t been revealed or for how long.\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first Marvel Studios has shot projects there. Scotland was previously used for the box office juggernauts Avengers: Infinity War with scenes filmed in Edinburgh and St. Abbs doubling for Norway in Avengers: Endgame.\n\nWe first revealed back in June that French-Canadian cinematographer Sylvaine Dufaux (Future Man) has been added to Secret Invasion’s production team. Dufaux also did various camera/director of photography work on films such as Solo: A Star Wars Story, Source Code, The Fountain, Destin Daniel Cretton’s The Glass Castle, X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse, John Wick: Chapter 2, and The United States vs. Billie Holiday.\n\nThe crossover event’s impressive cast already consists of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ben Mendelsohn as Skrull leader Talos, Oscar-winner Olivia Colman (The Favourite, Hot Fuzz, The Crown), four-time Emmy nominee Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones, Solo: A Star Wars Story), Kingsley Ben-Adir (One Night In Miami, Peaky Blinders) said to be playing a villain, and most recent addition to the Marvel series is character actor Christopher McDonald (Hacks, Happy Gilmore).\n\nThe show’s head writer is Kyle Bradstreet with directors Thomas Bezhucha (Let Him Go) and Ali Selim (The Looming Tower) shooting episodes.\n\nThere is some expectation that the series will have a connection to The Marvels and might end up have cross-pollination between the two projects’ casts, but this has yet to be confirmed.\n\nSecret Invasion alongside Moon Knight and She-Hulk are aiming for a release on Disney+ in 2022."
