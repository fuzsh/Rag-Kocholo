        "text": "‘Secret Invasion’ is coming soon to Disney+, a series based on the popular comic book storyline where the shape-shifting species the Skrulls invade Earth. This is also the first Marvel TV series in MCU’s Phase Five.\n\nThe official synopsis for ‘Secret Invasion’ is:\n\n“In Secret Invasion, set in the present-day MCU, Fury learns of a clandestine invasion of Earth by a faction of shapeshifting Skrulls. Fury joins his allies, including Everett Ross, Maria Hill, and the Skrull Talos, who has made a life for himself on Earth.”\n\nThe series is directed by Ali Selim, who directed all six episodes. ‘Secret Invasion’ will premiere on Disney+ on June 21st, 2023.\n\n‘Secret Invasion’ stars Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ben Mendelsohn as Talos, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Martin Freeman as Everett Ross, Emilia Clarke as G’iah, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Gravik, Olivia Colman as Sonya Falsworth, and Don Cheadle as James “Rhodey” Rhodes.\n\nMoviefone recently had the pleasure of attending the global virtual press conference for ‘Secret Invasion’. Talent and filmmakers in attendance were Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige, producer Jonathan Schwartz, director Ali Selim, Samuel L Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Cobie Smulders, Emilia Clarke, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Olivia Colman, and Don Cheadle.\n\nHere are 10 things we learned from the ‘Secret Invasion’ virtual press conference:\n\n1. Where does ‘Secret Invasion’ take place in the MCU timeline?\n\nProducer Jonathan Schwartz elaborated on how the show fits into MCU’s phase 5 and where it lands in the MCU timeline.\n\nJonathan Schwartz: It is present day MCU, that's what we’re calling it. It exists basically along that timeline, along the timeline that the show's coming out in. Post ‘She-Hulk’, post Blip, right at this exact present day in the MCU. I think that’s all I can say.\n\n2. How the Idea for the ‘Secret Invasion’ Series Came About And How It Differs From The Comics\n\nKevin Feige recounts the first time he visited the idea of taking the ‘Secret Invasion’ storyline and turning it into a series.\n\nKevin Feige: I think if you really go back, it did start on ‘Captain Marvel’, even if it wasn’t a ‘Secret Invasion’ idea yet. I think it was the idea that there was more to do with this relationship and with these two characters, with Nick and with Talos. Then the Disney+ doors opened up, and we got the opportunity to play in more genres and expand the sandbox of what we can do. That made ‘Secret Invasion’ by itself a story that had great source material behind it and was a comic event that a lot of people knew and responded to, and was a very cool genre specifically for these two characters. I think that’s what really brought the show to life.\n\nHe also touches on how the series will differ from the comic book.\n\nKevin Feige: We knew we weren't going to have every character in the Marvel Universe the way it is in the comics. It really was to focus on Sam Jackson and really to focus on this ensemble that you see here today in that, as we said, political thriller aspect to it. We had an amazing group of writers and our amazing director who helped to shepherd it all.\n\nAs for which upcoming MCU projects ‘Secret Invasion’ will lead into such as ‘Armor Wars’ or ‘The Marvels’:\n\nKevin Feige: You’ve named some of them. Yes. I mean, the repercussions will be felt in coming projects.\n\n3. What inspired them to make ‘Secret Invasion’ as a darker, grittier spy-thriller show?\n\nKevin Feige: Jonathan came into my office a number of years ago, when we were thinking about what kinds of shows to do on Disney+, and he came in with this idea of translating the great ‘Secret Invasion’ storyline from the comics into a darker, grittier spy show, which we hadn’t done. We love to do different genres for everything. This was an attempt to really dive back into things we touched upon in ‘Winter Soldier’, but hadn’t in a while. Really delving into the tone of a spy show and seeing a very different dynamic between Fury and Talos than we had seen in our 90s buddy action movie, ‘Captain Marvel.’\n\n4. The Current State Of Nick Fury In ‘Secret Invasion’\n\nNick Fury has been involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since the beginning - from ‘Iron Man’ in 2008. Fury has been through thick and thin with the Avengers and Thanos’ snap. Samuel L. Jackson talks about where his character is in this series.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson: This is my second appearance post-snap, and he’s been gone for a while. He is a little tired, a little vulnerable, but he's coming back to Earth because he’s been summoned, and we’ll see what happens. He's got a bad knee now, and he's not so happy.\n\nThrough the series, the audience will get the chance to learn more about Nicky Fury, the actor mentions that the more we find out about him, the more we’ll like him.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson: We get new information. We go to his house. You got to watch to find out if I live in a condo or a real house, and see if I have a yard. That stuff. What furniture does Nick Fury have? Does he have an island in his kitchen? Can he cook?\n\n5. What is Rhodey’s relationship like with Nick Fury in the series?\n\nJames “Rhodey” Rhodes (played by Don Cheadle) will appear in the series. The actor talks about what Rhodey has been up to and his relationship with Nick Fury.\n\nDon Cheadle: I think we’re just finding out what’s happening with Rhodey as this series goes on. He’s in a different role. We see him as more of a political animal than we have in the past. He’s been more of the military man, but now he’s in some ways the right hand of the President and the special envoy in that regard. But I think what I’m looking forward to is just seeing more, getting under the hood of who he is, and seeing how this relationship, not only with Nick Fury but the other cast members evolves. Again, as Ben (Mendelsohn) said, no spoilers, but it’s going to be some fun stuff.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson chimes in about never having any in-depth scenes with Cheadle until this series.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson: We’ve been waiting to do this for years and years and years. It was wonderful to do and to have that little abrasive thing happen there. It’s great and nice to know that we have that relationship, or I assumed it was that.\n\nDon Cheadle: I’ve known Sam for a long time and we’ve spent a lot of time talking about what it would be like to work together, looking for projects to do together. The central relationship between myself and Sam, and this was very important to me, and I was very glad to be brought on. I don’t think it was originally conceived that Rhodey was going to be in this, but when it came to me and Sam called, I was really excited about leaning into it. Also, being in a show like this that’s really a departure from what I have been in as far as the genre goes. It’s really an opportunity to act and really lean into some human stuff, which was also a lot of fun. As Emilia said, as Olivia said, as Kingsley said, as Ben said, this is a great cast. Ali was a great director, a great leader. It was just all upside, and I was very happy to look into who Rhodey is and to probe that more and find out what really makes him tick.\n\nRelated Article: TV Review: 'Secret Invasion'\n\n6. Maria Hill returns in ‘Secret Invasion’\n\nCobie Smulders reprises her role as agent Maria Hill in the spy-thriller series, and talks about Maria’s relationship with Fury and what it’s like to work with Samuel L. Jackson\n\nCobie Smulders: Working with Sam is my favorite thing, it’s true. It was really exciting to come back. But speaking again about strain, I think the relationship is quite strained because she’s been calling, and he hasn’t been answering.\n\nThe actress touches on how Maria Hill was also affected by the Blip and how that affected her state-of-mind.\n\nCobie Smulders: I think Maria Hill came back and someone else was sitting in her desk, and immediately kicked them out and got to work. I think there was just a mountain of cases to get to, which is a part of her resentment toward Fury because he was not around.\n\nJackson added:\n\nSamuel L Jackson: Well, yeah, it definitely has a mental health effect on you, and it causes a different rift between you and the people that you’ve been around or people that you’re supposed to be close to. I mean, like I said, I hadn’t been returning her calls. There are a few other people that I hadn’t been calling back either.\n\n7. Who is Sonya Falsworth?\n\nOlivia Colman joins the cast of ‘Secret Invasion’ as Sonya Falsworth. The actress talks about being a part of the MCU, who Sonya is, and her dynamic with Nick Fury.\n\nOlivia Colman: After every Marvel film that landed in cinemas, I phoned my agent and said, “Please, could I be in a Marvel movie.” Finally, either she got fed up of me calling her, or it happened. It wasn’t why ‘Secret Invasion’? ‘Secret Invasion’ called, and without any mention of the word “Marvel” I went, “Yes, please.” That’s why. I had an absolute ball and it lived up to everything that I was hoping for.\n\nOn the dynamic between Sonya and Nick Fury:\n\nOlivia Colman: I was just so excited to meet Samuel L. Jackson. They have a lovely friendship, although she does quite like to bully you with her heavies. It doesn’t strike me as much of a friendship, but they’ve got history. They trust each other, which I think I’m allowed to say.\n\nColeman talks a little more about who Sonya is:\n\nOlivia Colman: Sonya works for MI6. She likes wearing red and she’s quite funny and she’s potentially a little bit not that nice sometimes.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson adds:\n\nSamuel L. Jackson: And possibly the most dangerous woman in the UK. She lives in a dark corner of the UK and nobody can access it.\n\n8. Emilia Clarke on working with Ben Mendelsohn\n\nAnother newcomer to the MCU is Emilia Clarke, who is no stranger to major franchises and being tight-lipped on spoilers. The actress talks about her experience working with Ben Mendelsohn, given the relationship between the two characters.\n\nEmilia Clarke: I just love Ben. I love working with Ben. It was so much fun. It was really easy because obviously, we are playing. There’s tension all over the shop, but there is obviously a deep familiarity, shorthand and knowledge of each other that it’s just so easy and free acting with Ben, and it was just gorgeous.\n\nMendelsohn remained cryptic on where we find Talos in the series, but he touches on the current mindset of Talos and his relationship with Nick Fury.\n\nBen Mendelsohn: We’re finding Talos in a difficult time. It’s a bad time. By the way, (Nick Fury) up there? We could have used him. I’m just saying he’s been away a bit, the mate, you know?\n\n9. Who is Gravik?\n\nPlayed by Kingsley Ben-Adir, Gravik is a Skrull and an original character created for the series. The actor talks about exploring this brand-new character.\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir: I think we had many conversations for hours at the beginning. I guess like Gravik, I didn’t really trust why anything was coming to me, but he just felt like a part that I hadn’t been approached for before. There was an opportunity to do something a little bit different with this one. I just wanted to make him as unsentimental as possible. There’s something interesting about how much he hates Nick, and that was really enticing.\n\n10. ‘Secret Invasion’ is not just a superhero story\n\nDirector Ali Selim talks about the inspiration for the tone of the show\n\nAli Selim: Well, I think it’s a very human show. It’s the Nick Fury story. He’s a human. He does have his own version of superpowers, but they’re not like superhero superpowers. It’s a story about him putting his feet back on the ground once again after some time. I like that because I like human stories that come from the heart, and are human-scaled and reach for a universal appeal rather than the reverse of that. I liked the espionage political thriller element, and we went back to look at ‘The Third Man’ and ‘The Conversation’ and things like that, that are very grounded, real and human. I hope that we brought enough of that to create the tone. Then, without a spoiler alert, I think there is a point in the story where Nick Fury realizes this is his own battle, and he becomes a classic American Western hero. The tone shifted in the later episodes to Nick Fury as John Wayne.\n\nDirector Ali Selim speaks more about how the series delves into human emotions and the personal and inner life of Nick Fury.\n\nAli Selim: Well, I think it’s the script which was brilliantly written. I think it’s the fact that it’s the Nick Fury story rather than a superhero story. I think it’s the fact that it really tried to delve into very simple human emotions like trust and suspicion, and the personal life of Nick Fury and the inner life of Nick Fury. It’s very different than people flying through the air.\n\nSamuel L Jackson: See, but I don’t think it’s just a Nick Fury story because we got all these other interesting people that are flowing around through it. It’s a Gravik story, it’s Emilia’s story, and it’s Olivia’s story. It’s all these people that are being introduced that make you want to say, well, I want to go home with them too and see what’s happening.\n\n‘Secret Invasion’ premieres with its first episode on Disney+ on June 21, 2023.\n\nOther Movies Similar to ‘Secret Invasion’:\n\n'Iron Man' (2008)\n\n'Iron Man 2' (2010)\n\n'Iron Man 3' (2013)\n\n‘The Avengers' (2012)\n\n‘Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2015)\n\n'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018)\n\n'Black Panther' (2018)\n\n'Captain Marvel' (2019)\n\n‘Avengers: Endgame' (2019)\n\n'Spider-Man: Far from Home' (2019)\n\n'Black Widow' (2021)\n\n'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' (2022)"
