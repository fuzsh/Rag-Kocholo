        "text": "Synopsis & Film Details\n\nInge arrives in Minnesota in 1920 to marry a young Norwegian farmer named Olaf. Her German heritage and lack of official immigration papers make her an object of suspicion in the small town, and she and Olaf are forbidden to marry. Based on Will Weaver’s short story “A Gravestone Made of Wheat” and shot on location in Southern Minnesota, Sweet Land is that rare independent feature that uses painterly images and understated performances to tell a universal story of love and discovery. David Tumblety’s glorious magic-hour cinematography recalls classic American art cinema like Days of Heaven, transforming Southern Minnesota’s farm country into an elegiac metaphor for memory, family, and history. Featuring supporting performances by veteran performers Ned Beatty, Paul Sand, and Lois Smith, Sweet Land is the story of immigrant America, made by the son of first-generation immigrants themselves.*\n\nDirected by Ali Salem\n\nUSA, 2006; PG, 110 min., 35mm\n\nShort Film\n\nMaestro*\n\nMaestro sits in front of a dressing room mirror, and carefully prepares for his grand show.\n\nOscar nominee for Best Animated Short.\n\nDirected by Geza M.
