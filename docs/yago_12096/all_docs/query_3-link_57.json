        "text": "Marvel Studios' Secret Invasion EP & director Ali Selim discusses using AI for the intro - which may not have been a good thing.\n\nLess than a day after hitting Disney+ screens, Marvel Studios' Samuel L. Jackson & Ben Mendelsohn-starring Secret Invasion is already creating a buzz on social media – just not for the reason that Marvel probably wanted. And we're not exactly sure that director & executive producer Ali Selim actually helped matters any. By the time the opening sequence had rolled, there were a lot of viewers left wondering if AI (artificial intelligence) was used to create it. Speaking with Polygon, Selim confirmed that the intro was designed by Method Studios using AI – and that it fits perfectly with the shape-shifting vibe of the streaming series. \"When we reached out to the AI vendors, that was part of it — it just came right out of the shape-shifting, Skrull world identity, you know? Who did this? Who is this?\" Selim explained. But then? Well, it got a little problematic…\n\nIn the same article, it reads that Selim says that he doesn't \"really understand\" how AI works but was intrigued by the idea of how the technology could be used to enhance the paranoia vibe of the show. And that's what folks are taking issues with, arguing that if Selim had a better understanding of how AI worked, then he would realize that it functions by amalgamating (some would say that's a fact way of saying \"stealing\") other artists' works to create a metaphorical \"Frankenstein's Monster\" – without giving those artists due credit & compensation. As for how they approached Method Studios about what they wanted, Selim added, \"We would talk to them about ideas and themes and words, and then the computer would go off and do something. And then we could change it a little bit by using words, and it would change.\"\n\nMarvel Studios' Secret Invasion: A Preview\n\nFor a look at what's still to come, here's that sneak preview for Marvel Studios & Disney+'s Secret Invasion – followed by the previously-released behind-the-scenes featurette and the official trailer & series overview (with the series opener now streaming):\n\nEarlier, director Ali Selim and producer Jonathan Schwartz shared how Captain America: The Winter Soldier proved that the powered-down, espionage side of the MCU could be popular with the fans and how that helped give the series a boost. \"The first conversations I had [with Marvel] were, 'Nobody flies in the air in the show,'\" Selim shared. \"I realized, 'Yeah, they're doing something very different, and that's exciting.'\" Schwartz adds that the upcoming series has the added bonus of being able to take a deeper dive into who Fury is as a person. \"'The Winter Soldier' certainly gave us a lot of confidence that we could tell a story in that space that felt more like a paranoid thriller. 'Secret Invasion' takes that a step further, and you really get to dig into Nick. It becomes much more character-focused in a way that I really love,\" he added.\n\nIn Marvel Studios' new series \"Secret Invasion,\" set in the present day MCU, Nick Fury learns of a clandestine invasion of Earth by a faction of shapeshifting Skrulls. Fury joins his allies, including Everett Ross, Maria Hill and the Skrull Talos, who has made a life for himself on Earth. Together they race against time to thwart an imminent Skrull invasion and save humanity.\n\nMarvel Studios' Secret Invasion stars Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Cobie Smulders, Martin Freeman, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Charlayne Woodard, Killian Scott, Samuel Adewunmi, Dermot Mulroney, Christopher McDonald, and Katie Finneran, with Emilia Clarke, Olivia Colman, and Don Cheadle. Ali Selim directs the series and executive-produces, along with fellow executive producers Jackson, Kevin Feige, Jonathan Schwartz, Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Brad Winderbaum, Kyle Bradstreet, and Brian Tucker. Bradstreet is also the head writer, and Jennifer L. Booth, Allana Williams, and Brant Englestein serve as co-executive producers."
