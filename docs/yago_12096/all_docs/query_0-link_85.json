        "text": "ABOUT THIS REVIEWER – POSTED ONOCTOBER 16, 2020\n\nSweet Land, the musical (St. Paul, MN)\n\nStories of America have been mined for musical gold many times. In Sweet Land, the musical, that gold takes on a hue of wheat. The setting is Park Rapids, Minnesota. A married couple is packing up the remains of a farm home. Lars’ grandmother had died two years earlier. Mementos from the past such as a photograph and a letter dated July, 1920 are the catalyst to a trip back in time.\n\nOlaf Torvik (Robert Berdahl) was farming his land alone. He was introduced to Inge Altenberg (Ann Michels) through relatives back in Europe. From a written letter, she came to America at his asking carrying a gramophone and speaking not a word of English. After landing here, she jumps on a train to the middle of the country for a new life.\n\nThis musical had its world premier in 2017. The History Theatre is streaming that production this month. The timing is ideal. As our nation clashes over immigration policy, the themes of this show resonate loudly. Sweet Land is a sweet little show that takes time to reveal goodness and grace within people. Sweet Land also addresses hardship and conflict before healing.\n\nA violinist is center stage as the jittery strings underscore tension. World War I is over. In 1917, Germans represented the largest single ethnic group in Minnesota. German Americans were evaluated for their patriotic attitudes supported by a network of spies from the newly created Minnesota Commission of Public Safety. Into this world arrives Inge, a German.\n\nOlaf and Inge had agreed to marry but the church cannot sanction such a union. The priest does not know her and she has no references. Even the Judge will not marry them, saying “Why did she leave Germany? She is not one of us.” While all of this sounds like dour melodrama, there is a lightness to the storytelling which keeps the show in the zone of entertaining and heartwarming. The struggles are real but our ability to consider them is refreshingly pleasant. Both actors have great chemistry in addition to fully formed characterizations. The whole cast and the musicians were additive to enjoying this piece.\n\nThe book was written by Perrin Post and Laurie Flanigan Hegge. Words create vivid imagery such as “tired, bedraggled, covered in dust.” The characters and situations are often humorous. When Olaf shoots a pheasant, he tries to hand it over to Inge. “You shoot, you pluck,” she retorts. My favorite outburst written into the book was the “Nein” speech.\n\nThe plentiful songs in Sweet Land were written by Laurie Flanigan Hegge (lyrics) and Dina Maccabee (music). There are nice nods to music and expressions from the period. I thought I heard a few flashes of the scores for Thoroughly Modern Millie and Brokeback Mountainburied in there. The dissonant tones of the score were very effective.\n\nThis musical was directed by Perrin Post. For a small scale show, many transitions were particularly fluid such as a kitchen scene evolving into a porch scene. The technical elements, particularly the lighting (Mike Grogan) and sound effects (C Andrew Mayer), were noticeably excellent. The neighbor’s tractor ride can only be described as Green Acres realness with overalls instead of a suit and tie.\n\nQuite a few themes emerge from this small tale of two people and the rural farming community that surrounds them. What does it mean to really care about your fellow citizens? What assumptions do we make about people based upon their race or background? Is it properly called apple pie or is it really strudel?\n\nThe vilification of immigrants and also those who seem different than us remains a core American value, sadly. Sometimes it is therapeutic to step back and listen. People on both sides of a war might not simply be blind followers of their governments or political parties. The search for personal happiness and fulfillment is deftly explored in Sweet Land, the musical. Let’s hope America can find its way there too.\n\nSweet Land, the musical is streaming through October 22, 2020 from History Theatre at Home. You can choose the level of your ticket price.\n\nwww.historytheatre.com\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLAKESHORE REGIONAL NEWS: Door County, Kewaunee County, Manitowoc County, and Sheboygan County\n\nWarren Gerds/Critic at Large: Door County theater alum part of ambitious ‘Sweet Land’\n\nCRITIC AT LARGE\n\nLaurie Flanigan Hegge\n\nby: Warren Gerds, Contact me at warren.gerds@wearegreenbay.com. Watch for my on-air Critic at Large editions every Sunday morning during the 6-7:30 broadcast on WFRV-TV, Channel 5.Posted: Oct 9, 2020 / 12:01 AM CDT / Updated: Oct 8, 2020 / 04:33 PM CDT\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (WFRV) – Book and lyrics.\n\nThe story and the words in a musical.\n\nThat’s what Laurie Flanigan Hegge does.\n\nShe is a special kind of wordsmith.\n\nThree times she has been associated in that role for shows of Northern Sky Theater of Door County – “Loose Lips Sink Ships,” “See Jane Vote” and “Boxcar.”\n\nEach of those musicals has a bit more grip than usual for Northern Sky shows.\n\nHaving a lot more grip is “Sweet Land,” about which Laurie Flanigan Hegge contacted me because that musical will be available online today, Oct. 9, to Oct. 22.\n\n“I know you and your readership are familiar with my work at Northern Sky, and might be excited to see this project,” she wrote by email. “Bonus: My hubby Jon Hegge, another Northern Sky and Door Shakespeare alum, is in this show!”\n\nLaurie Flannigan Hegge provides a perspective on the world of writing original musicals in the Midwest for two theater companies.\n\nAlso in this piece, I will give my reviewer’s take on “Sweet Land.”\n\nFor “Loose Lips Sink Ships” (2001) Laurie Flanigan Hegge teamed with Jacinda Duffin to co-write the book and lyrics and composer James Kaplan to tell the story of the lives and loves surrounding the shipyards of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, during World War II.\n\nFor “See Jane Vote” (2006), Laurie Flanigan Hegge teamed with composer James Kaplan to turn back the clock to 1913 for the story of a woman’s pursuit of the right to vote (still seven years away by federal law) in the Wisconsin town of Liberty Grove.\n\nFor “Boxcar” (2018), Laurie Flannigan Hegge teamed with composer James Valcq for the tale of a boy and two hobos in the tough times of the 1930s in Wisconsin. The musical “says something about people who came before us who had to get by,” my review said at the time.\n\nBy 2018, Laurie Flanigan Hegge had already been part of “Sweet Land,” presented by History Theatre of Saint Paul, Minnesota. The world premiere was in 2017. For History Theatre, Laurie Flanigan Hegge’s other collaborations are “Dirty Business,” “Hormel Girls” and “20 Days to Find a Wife.”\n\n“Sweet Land” has resurfaced because of the coronavirus COVID-19. Like so many companies, History Theatre is looking for new avenues to remain valid. Thus, online showings of “Sweet Land.” Info: historytheater.com.\n\n“With our industry closed down, this is one of the only ways that audiences can see our work and support the artists and the theaters they love,” Laurie Flannigan Hegge writes.\n\n***\n\nLooking at “Sweet Land” separately.\n\nIt is a story of love with fascinating snags.\n\nAction starts with a flashback. On a farm in Minnesota, a man of today envisions his grandparents in 1920. Through a whisp of theater, the man becomes his grandfather of Scandinavian heritage, Olaf Torvik.\n\nOlaf is a bachelor farmer. Arriving is his bride, Inge Altenberg, who has kept house for Olaf’s parents back home in Norway.\n\nSnag: Inge is German, and the just-ended World War I leaves deep bitterness toward Germans.\n\nOlaf is asked, “German! What are you thinking?” Olaf has a bachelor’s answer: “I’m thinking I need a wife.”\n\nSnag: Even though they have just met, Olaf and Inge intend to marry, and they go to the church. The pastor says, “She is not one of us.” The marriage must wait.\n\nSnag: A possibility is a civil ceremony. The judge echoes the pastor. The marriage must wait.\n\nSnag: Inge wants to move in with Olaf. Olaf says no because of propriety. Inge explodes and unleashes a barrage of anger, in German, that translates to her calling Olaf a coward.\n\nAnd so the story gains traction. Ahead is fun – a baseball game, a dance and the zesty neighbors, Frandsen and his wife Brownie. Also ahead is an impending SNAG – a foreclosure.\n\n“Sweet Land” is a window on complexities that engulfed a past generation. Losses of loved ones in the war are part of the difficulties.\n\nFlashes of elevated artistry stand out in the production. A discordant violin infuses tension in some scenes. A dance sequence starts as a variant square dance that flows into a kind of folk dance with accordion that flows into an artful duo dance with cello. Later, Inge will dance barefoot in a form of impressionistic ballet. A scene with an auctioneer feeds on his rhythm, with the crowd creating an a cappella angst.\n\nAs the always-optimistic Inge, Ann Michels covers the waterfront in characterization – loving, teasing, aching, mocking, challenging and more. And the rest of the company fills the bill, with musicians doubling in acting roles.\n\nCast (*-Actors Equity Association)\n\nInge Altenberg – Ann Michels*\n\nLars Torvik, Olaf Torvik – Robert Berdahl*\n\nNeighbor, Alvin Frandsen – Jon Andrew Hegge*\n\nNeighbor, Brownie Frandsen – Tinia Moulder*\n\nNeighbor, Pastor Sorenson – Michael Gruber*\n\nGail Torvik, Esther Larson, Olaf’s Mother – Norah Long*\n\nNeighbor, Station Agent, Judge, Harold – James Ramlet\n\nNeighbor, Amundson, Clerk, Auctioneer, guitar – Matt Riehle\n\nNeighbor, Nelson, piano, accordion – Jason Hansen\n\nNeighbor, Anna, violin – Colleen Bertsch\n\nNeighbor, Larson, cello – Randall Davidson\n\nNeighbor, bass – Josh Ackerley\n\nNeighbor, Train Conductor, woodwinds, guitar – Dylan Younger\n\nRunning time: Two hours, 40 minutes\n\nCreative: Playwright/director – Perrin Post; playwright/lyricist – Laurie Flanigan Hegge; composer – Dina Maccabee; choreographer – Joe Chavala; musical arranger – Robert Elhai\n\nInfo: historytheatre.com/at-home/sweet-land\n\nAn overall impression is “Sweet Land” is a tapestry. Like so many musicals, it makes the story in combination with music, movement and human expressive nuance all the denser. A weakness may be the resolution of the problem in the story is akin to “It’s a Wonderful Life,” but the piece has many riches.\n\n***\n\nWhat Northern Sky Theater of Door County and History Theatre of Minnesota do are kind of/sort of in the same ballpark.\n\n“Sweet Land” is longer by twice what Northern Sky Theater presents, and its tone is more dramatic by twice, too. But both are populist theater.\n\nTaking an opportunity, I asked Laurie Flanigan Hegge questions by email, and her responses are illuminating.\n\nWhy “Sweet Land”? Is it from you? From someone else’s idea? Either way, what motivated it?\n\nMy collaborator Perrin Post originated this project. She fell in love with the movie and got the rights from filmmaker Ali Selim, who wrote and directed the film, and author Will Weaver, who wrote the short story “A Gravestone Made of Wheat,” which inspired the film. Perrin brought me into the project. We talk about that in this conversation if you want more about the origin story: https://www.facebook.com/HistoryTheatre/videos/2649305358720844.\n\nHow is working on a musical for History Theatre the same as/different than for Northern Sky Theater?\n\nHere’s something different: This was my first time working on an adaptation, and so from that perspective it was different than anything I’ve done for Northern Sky. “Sweet Land” was in process for a while before it was decided that it would premiere at the History Theatre. But still, there were a lot of similarities, because there were actors attached to the project from the beginning, like the lead, Ann Michels, and much like my experience writing for a specific company at Northern Sky, we wrote this with Ann in mind. “Sweet Land” went through a long development process, which included two workshops before History Theatre became attached, and two wonderful workshops with History Theatre after they became attached, as well as a Rough Cuts workshop with Nautilus Music-Theater in St. Paul. Perrin directed the History Theatre production, and the upcoming stream was captured with three cameras, so it’s a really quality recording. It’s fitting that it should have premiered at the History Theatre, which is now my artistic home much like Northern Sky was my artistic home for many wonderful years.\n\nWriting for the summer stage at Northern Sky means there are certain limitations. It must be one act, for example, and you’re writing with a company of actors in mind. There are similar limitations when writing an adaptation; a lot of decisions were made for us because we agreed to keep certain aspects of the story when we secured the rights. The interesting thing is, that can be very freeing. I love the Northern Sky audience. Writing specifically for the Northern Sky audience requires a handle of what will tickle kids and grandparents at the same time. I like to write for the Northern Sky audience with my heart on my sleeve, because that’s what (co-founder) Fred Alley did, and I learned so much from him. I think that’s probably why I was so attracted to “Sweet Land.” The story is all about heart, about love and loss and fear and faith, and finally: hope. Northern Sky taught me that there’s nothing corny about having a heart, and it taught me about what it means to be part of a community, which is a big theme in “Sweet Land.”\n\nWorking at Northern Sky also ingrained in me a sense of play. That translates to an invitation to never take myself too seriously – and I like it when my characters don’t take themselves too seriously, either. One of the delightful things in “Sweet Land” is that the musicians on stage become animals in a barn at one point. Anything is possible when you are having fun and feel you have permission to play. Speaking of musicians on stage, perhaps that’s the biggest influence Northern Sky has had on me. I love seeing actors on stage with a guitar in their hands. I’m sure Perrin had the idea to have the musicians be fully incorporated into the acting ensemble before I ever joined the “Sweet Land” team, and that’s probably one of the biggest things that attracted me to the project. We did it all the time at Northern Sky back in the day, and it’s so fun. The “Sweet Land” orchestra double as ensemble members. No small feat when you hear the score.\n\nI was really happy to be part of an all-women writing team on this project. Dina Maccabee’s score is extraordinary. Dina has no relationship to Northern Sky, yet I think the Northern Sky audience will immediately connect with her. You can find out more about Dina at http://www.dinamaccabee.com. Robert Elhai orchestrated. Robert was Tony-nominated for his orchestrations for Broadway’s “The Lion King” and orchestrates blockbuster Hollywood movies – check out his IMDB if you want your jaw to drop – and he’s an amazing composer in his own right. He was my collaborator on a recent History Theatre commission, “Dirty Business.”\n\nAnything you would like to add, please do.\n\nOne thread through all of this is my husband, Jon Hegge, who I’ve been lucky to collaborate with since my first workshop of “Loose Lips Sink Ships” at Northern Sky in 2000. Our daughter wasn’t 2 yet when he appeared onstage with me in my next Northern Sky play, “See Jane Vote,” and he just directed “Boxcar” for me in 2018 at Northern Sky. We work together a lot in the Twin Cities. He was recently in “Dirty Business” and plays Frandsen in “Sweet Land,” the role Alan Cumming plays in the movie. He’s my secret weapon – the first one to read a lyric and the most reliable barometer as to whether anyone else should read it or whether I should go back to my desk for a little while.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nContact: In-Fin Tuan, 651-292-4328 pr@historytheatre.com\n\nHistory Theatre at Home streaming Sweet Land, the Musical Experience the poignant, lyrical celebration of land, love online\n\nSAINT PAUL, MN (July 14, 2020) – History Theatre at Home is proud to present Sweet Land, the musical from the writing team of Perrin Post (book), Laurie Flanigan Hegge (lyrics and book), and Dina Maccabee (music). This moving new musical will be available to stream online October 9-22. For details, visit historytheatre.com.\n\nThe musical is based upon the the movie “Sweet Land,” a beloved indie feature by filmmaker Ali Selim, which was in turn inspired by A Gravestone Made of Wheat, a short story by award-winning Minnesota author Will Weaver. The musical’s touching love story follows Inge Altenberg, a German immigrant who, in the wake of WW I, arrives in Minnesota to marry a Norwegian bachelor, sight unseen, and is ostracized by the community. The critically acclaimed musical has been called “…a thoroughly human story of enduring love…,” “…a beautiful story of love, community, and connection to the land…,” and “…a heart-warming and heart-winning piece of musical theater.”\n\n“The story of Sweet Land belongs to all of us,” said Hegge. “Our ancestries may be different, but each of us has a story about where, how, and why our families came to be. Many of our families were considered ‘other’ at some point. We want to believe we are loving and accepting when welcoming outsiders into our communities. The truth is, we often fall short.”\n\n“In 1917, Germans represented the single largest ethnic group in Minnesota. With the outbreak of World War I, the environment towards German Americans turned deeply hostile. Suddenly, loyalties were questioned, civil liberties suspended. A network of spies informed the newly-formed Minnesota Commission of Public Safety on the ‘patriotic attitudes’ of recent immigrants. Fear was institutionalized. This is the world that Inge stepped into when she arrived at Olaf Torvik’s farm.”\n\nThis stream is a closed-captioned recording of the innovative 2017 world premiere production directed by Perrin Post with musical direction by Jason Hansen and choreography by Joe Chvala at the History Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota. The production stars Ann Michels as Inge Altenberg and features an ensemble cast of thirteen actors and musicians.\n\nPost is also known for her work as Artistic Director and Producer with Buffalo Gal Productions, where she created such hits as Broadway’s Legendary Ladies, Monsters, Witches & Freaks, and Vixens. Hegge’s work includes her WWII spy musical Dirty Business, a collaboration with Robert Elhai which premiered at History Theatre in 2019, as well as Hormel Girls and 20 Days to Find a Wife at History Theatre and Loose Lips Sink Ships, See Jane Vote and Boxcar at Northern Sky Theater in Door County. She serves as the Twin Cities Regional Representative for the Dramatists Guild. Composer and violinist Maccabee has been an Artist-in-Residence at Headland Center for the Arts in Sausalito, CA and Byrdcliffe Colony in Woodstock, NY. Her most recent instrumental album, Land So Sweet, was created as a companion piece to Sweet Land, the Musical and features Dina on fiddle in collaboration with multi-instrumentalist and Sweet Land film composer Mark Orton.

Post (who also directs the musical) recalls being so touched by the movie that she wrote a note to Selim, who shared it with Weaver. “I still don’t know why they chose me except that I was passionate about it and really cared about this simple and quiet story.”\n\n“Inge and Olaf’s union was more than a piece of paper—it was more about the love in their hearts. When she arrives in Park Rapids, Inge doesn’t speak English, but this musical gives us the opportunity to hear her thoughts. A musical will stop, take a moment in time and elaborate, and give us a brilliant opportunity to really listen to the story,” shares Ann Michels, who plays Inge. Maccabee’s lush and haunting music helps to transform the sweeping fields of Southern Minnesota farm country into a reflective symbol for memory, family and history.\n\nIn addition to Ann Michels, the cast includes Robert Berdahl, Tinia Moulder, Jon Andrew Hegge, Michael Gruber, Norah Long, James Ramlet, Matt Riehle and musicians fully integrated into the acting ensemble: Colleen Bertsch, Randall Davidson, Josh Ackerley, Jason Hansen (music direction) and Dylan Younger.
