        "text": "“Secret Invasion” is done. Whether or not people will look back fondly on this chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is unknown at this time. (Early reaction to the finale would seem as if fans weren’t not overly excited about how it ended, to be honest.) But the MCU is a monolithic entity that can withstand the odd blunder (or several, if you consider the last couple of years of releases), and fans will always look toward the future. Will that future include some of the characters who debuted in “Secret Invasion?” Well, if the director of the series gets his way, possibly.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Secret Invasion’: Ali Selim Talks About The Controversial Decisions To Kill 2 Fan-Favorite Characters\n\nSpeaking in an upcoming episode of The Playlist’s Bingeworthy podcast, director Ali Selim, the filmmaker behind “Secret Invasion,” talked about what he would like to do in the future, if Marvel Studios calls him up. It appears that Selim would love to continue the story of a couple of the characters who were introduced in his most recent series.\n\nBut before he talked about that, Selim also explained how he came to be the only filmmaker involved in “Secret Invasion.” Typically, Marvel Studios series include multiple directors, as is the case with nearly every TV series. However, outside of a few of the early Marvel series, it’s increasingly rare to see just one person behind the camera. Well, Selim said that it was originally supposed to be that way.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Secret Invasion’ Director Ali Selim Thinks Rhodey’s Been A Skrull Since Marvel’s ‘Civil War’\n\n“When I came on, there were two of us,” said Selim. “I was going to do [episodes] four, five, six, and my friend, Tom Bezucha, was going to do [episodes] one, two, three. And then he prepped for a while, but then we got into scheduling constraints for him or something, because I think the show got delayed a couple of times and he had to depart for the new season of ‘Fargo.’ So, he had to depart for that. And it was great for me. I think maybe a little bit ill-timed for Marvel, and so I was part of the scramble to fill those episodes.”\n\nAs for the future, Selim would very much like to continue his work with Marvel Studios. And if he is asked what he’d like to do next, he has two characters in mind already.\n\n“If I were lucky enough to receive the call, I would say let’s call Olivia Colman and Emilia Clarke,” he said. “I just think there’s a really strong story in that, you know? Is that ‘Secret Invasion’ Season 2? Is that something unto itself? I just think those two are incredible actors and those two incredible characters could really take us somewhere.”\n\nFor those who didn’t watch the series, without getting into spoilers, both Colman and Clarke had characters with interesting pasts who factored into the overall plot of “Secret Invasion” very well. In the case of Clarke, with the final episode reveals about her character, there are folks who are excited (and somewhat confused) about what her story might be in the MCU moving forward.\n\n“Secret Invasion” is available to stream on Disney+.\n\n– Additional reporting by Mike DeAngelo"
