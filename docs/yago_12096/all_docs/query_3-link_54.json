        "text": "Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury has found himself in quite an intense situation in Marvel’s Secret Invasion series! In Episode 2 Fury appears to have lost most of his allies, and things are getting really messy, especially after Fury learns that Talos brought the remainder of the Skrulls to Earth after he and Captain Marvel didn’t fulfill their promise to find them a new home.\n\nWe don’t know how many Skulls are on Earth now, but it could very well be millions. Fury finds himself insanely frustrated with the situation, and he goes to James “Rhodey” Rhodes (Don Cheadle) for help. During the meeting, Rhodey suggests bringing in the Avengers to help solve the problem, but Fury believes that would be a bad idea and a dangerous move, as the Skrull species can not only impersonate them, they can likely take over their minds and duplicate their powers. Yeah, that wouldn’t be good.\n\nFury is hoping Rhodey will have his back as he embarks on his mission to fix this huge mess, but Rhodey isn’t going to do that. In fact, he ends up firing Fury! As you might imagine, Fury was pissed, and he’s going to do what he’s going to do regardless.\n\nOne of the most shocking moments in the episode comes at the end when Fury returns home after his brutally rough day. As the scene plays out before Fury enters the house, audiences see a Skrull woman preparing dinner in the kitchen. This is the same Skrull woman that we saw in the 1995 flashback at the beginning of the episode in which she introduces Fury to Gravik.\n\nNow, as Fury enters the house and rounds the corner, the Skrull woman has changed into a human form. It’s revealed that this is his wife, Priscilla Fury. But maybe… it’s not? It’s unclear whether or not Fury is aware that his wife is a Skrull. Director Ali Selim recently talked about this aspect of the episode in an interview with Deadline. The creative team wanted to leave audiences questioning this reveal. He said:\n\n“In the script, he knows. And when we shot it, it was interesting that maybe he didn’t know. We ultimately edited it in a way that made people feel like, ‘I wonder if he knows or not.’ I can’t tease anything forward about his wife. The conversation in the lobby after the premiere the other night was, ‘Does he know she’s a Skrull? Or does he not?’ And I think either way works.”\n\nSo, we don’t know for sure if they stuck to the script. Selim went on to say that it will become clear soon what they decided to do here with Fury’s wife. Either way, it does present complications. If Fury doesn’t know that his wife is a Skrull, then the infiltration is much closer to home than he thinks. Then, if he does know, it could affect Fury’s plan to stop Gravik. Selim said:\n\n“I think his wife is a support and a complication, and I think you will learn interesting things about their relationship…going forward. But ultimately, that is the personal issue that he needs to confront to make this make sense to him.”\n\nWhen teasing the rest of the season on how the story will unfold for Fury, the filmmaker said:\n\n“The mission is external and it’s internal. I think that Nick Fury has to vanquish a villain, and the reason he has to vanquish that villain is that he created that villain through his promise. That’s what makes it personal. I think that also is what makes this a more human Marvel story and a more dark psychological Marvel story.”\n\nSo far I’ve been enjoying Secret Invasion. we’re only a couple of episodes in and I hope that the story continues to be engaging. What are your thoughts!?"
