        "text": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is continuing its streak of disappointing releases, and the director of Secret Invasion, the latest installment in MCU, is now defending his project. According to reports, the Samuel L. Jackson starrer failed to impress fans and the finale episode garnered a record-low score on Rotten Tomatoes. Originally set to be co-directed by two filmmakers, the departure of Thomas Bezucha left Ali Selim as the sole director.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAli Selim, known for his works in Criminal Minds and Manhunt, also serves as the executive producer for Secret Invasion. The show, centered around Jackson’s character, Nick Fury, has received criticism for its sluggish pacing, lackluster plot, and disappointing action sequences.\n\nAlso Read: “The burnout for Marvel is real”: Secret Invasion Now Has the Distinction of Being the 2nd Lowest Viewed MCU Show Premiere\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMCU Director Ali Selim’s Views on Bad Reviews\n\nIn a recent interview with Variety, the director of the MCU series addressed the show’s negative reception by saying, “I don’t read reviews.” Ali Selim has a different perspective on creating a show for an audience:\n\n“For me, I view all the storytelling work I do as a dialogue with an audience. When the show is finished and put up on the screen, that’s my half of the dialogue. And the audience then starts their half of the response to it.”\n\nThe Looming Tower director further stated that while he finds the audience’s response valuable, he doesn’t know how to “answer the question.”\n\nAlso Read: “F**k you”: Marvel Studios’ Tone-deaf Secret Invasion Post Has MCU Fans Declare War\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirector Blames Fan Expectations For The Bad Reception\n\nSelim also expresses that he is not bothered by the mixed response and shares his views on the expectations of the MCU fanbase:\n\n“If you had unanimously good reviews, every movie would gross $10 billion, trillion dollars, right? [Projects] resonate with different people at different times for different reasons, and Marvel has a very devoted — even rabid — fan base who have expectations and when their expectations aren’t fulfilled, they move in the other direction; they give it a thumbs down.”\n\nHowever, the Hand of God director’s most concerning statement might not sit well with the fans or the Marvel Studios executives.\n\nAlso Read: Secret Invasion’s Gargantuan Production Cost Shatters Ceilings – Only 2 Other MCU Shows Had a Bigger Budget\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAli Selim’s Statement Concerns The MCU Fandom\n\nDespite not reading the reviews or feeling bad about them, Ali Selim goes on to say that he actually “feels great about the response”. This may indicate that he personally feels satisfied with the project:\n\n“I don’t know — is it our job to fulfill their expectations? Or to tell the story that we’re telling? So, it’s a tricky thing. I would love it if everybody loved it, but I also don’t have that expectation myself, so I feel great about the response to it.”\n\nAlso Read: After Secret Invasion That Had Nearly More Budget Than Oppenheimer And Barbie Combined, Emilia Clarke Has Now Starred In 3 Mega Failure Franchises\n\nWhile fans are eager to hear from Marvel Studios, it remains to be seen how Secret Invasion will affect the MCU going forward. The show is not essential viewing, but it does set up some important plot threads for future projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can catch all 6 episodes of the MCU series on Disney+."
