The film, which took him fifteen years to finance, was shot in 2005 around Chippewa County, Minnesota.[citation needed] It starred Alan Cumming, Ned Beatty, Elizabeth Reaser, Alex Kingston and John Heard. The film was the recipient of the 2005 Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature Film at the 13th Annual Hamptons International Film Festival, the 2006 Florida Film Festival: Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature, and the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards: Best First Feature.\n\nHis narrative film Emperor of the Air (1996), based on Ethan Canin's story of the same name, was awarded the top prize at Worldfest and the D.
