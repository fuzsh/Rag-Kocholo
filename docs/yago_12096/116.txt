Writer and director Ali Selim invited long-time collaborator Tom Lieberman to help him develop his feature film debut, Sweet Land. The film, co-produced with featured player Alan Cumming, is rich with period detail set in multiple historical contexts, creating a considerable challenge for a low-budget independent film. Even so, Sweet Land received many honors, including the Film Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature, and placement on the annual “Top 10” lists of numerous publications, including The Los Angeles Times, The Village Voice and Entertainment Weekly.
