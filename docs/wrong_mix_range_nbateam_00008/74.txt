Rasheed Wallace had a very successful NBA career that was highlighted by four all-star appearances and winning an NBA title with the Detroit Pistons. He'll now be joining Penny Hardaway's staff at Memphis as an assistant coach.

“Coach Sheed” has a nice ring to it as Hardaway continues to build a solid staff with many familiar names including the former Pistons all-star.

Mike Miller, a former sharpshooter who won it all with LeBron James and the Miami Heat, was on Hardaway's staff with Memphis as well before leaving in 2020 to be closer to his family.

Adding Wallace to the staff at Memphis is a good get for Hardaway. Wallace served as an assistant coach for the Pistons in 2013 and most recently was the head coach at Jordan High School in Durham, North Carolina.

Wallace averaged 14.4 points and 6.7 rebounds per game throughout his NBA career. He was known for his aggressive style and trash talking that often got him into trouble with the league. He had two all-star appearances with the Blazers and two with the Pistons.
