MIAMI – Rasheed Wallace is doubtful for tonight’s

Pistons-Miami Heat game because of a sore left foot.

Wallace stayed at the team hotel in the team’s morning

shootaround. He was injured during Pistons’ 95-93

victory over Chicago Sunday when Bulls forward P.J.

Brown accidentally stepped on his foot.

X-rays taken on Tuesday came back negative but Wallace

hasn’t practiced all week.

Coach Flip Saunders said second-year forward Jason

Maxiell would probably start if Wallace can’t play.
