        "text": "There’s a really great feature about Arvydas Sabonis on Grantland today, but we couldn’t get through it without laughing about Bill Walton’s take on a Rasheed Wallace-Sabonis conflict, during which Walton was broadcasting the game on national television: “In the following season, Wallace threw the towel at Sabonis during a timeout of a game against the Lakers. Sabonis had accidentally smacked Wallace’s face earlier when he collided in the post with O’Neal. … Walton, who was broadcasting the game nationally, still feels remorse over the incident. ‘It was one of the lowest moments of my life,’ he said. ‘If I was any kind of a man, I would have got up from that broadcast table and walked across the court and punched Rasheed Wallace in the nose. But I let Sabonis and the game of basketball and the human race down that day.'”"
