        "text": "Rasheed Wallace on Joel Embiid playing Olympics: 'Sit your ass down'\n\nRasheed Wallace: What the Sixers should have done is sit his ass down, go and get that rest. ‘This is the Olympics…’ No, sit down dog. Like you just got all this bread bro. No disrespect to the Olympics and Olympic Games, all that, but hey man, to me in this world, hey this NBA title is more important than you know getting that gold medal. Yo, go ahead and rest up. If I were the Sixers, oh man I definitely would have protested that with him. You are our main catalyst. I could see it if you were our backup center, or if you were a backup guard, or even a starting guard where we got let’s say bringing a Tyrese Maxey off the bench or something like that. Oh yeah go ahead, but we ain’t got nobody to back you up, bro. You are the team, you are it. When people think of the Philadelphia 76ers we think of Joel Embiid. Well, we think of Allen Iverson first, but then Joel Embiid. Man no, sit down. He doesn’t look healthy.\n\nRasheed Wallace to Draymond Green on Warriors vs. 2000s Pistons: Y'all were too f****** little\n\nRasheed Wallace: .@Draymond Green …first and foremost this isn’t a beef, Draymond is my lil bro who I am proud of so no matter what we say it will never be personal so don’t try to blow this up cause we both know how cats do!!! Dray you already know how we got down on that squad!! Don’t matter the rules yours or ours …. y’all as a team were too fuckin little… you can ask more than half ya teammates (who we played against) on that roster… and we can keep it with that year b/c no way yall could fuck with any of us in our prime… at any point I can come on ya show or you can come visit mines and we can go thru the roster man for man coach for coach …."
