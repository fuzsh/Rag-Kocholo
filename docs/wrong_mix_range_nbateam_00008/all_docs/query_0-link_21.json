        "text": "Biography[]\n\nRasheed Abdul Wallace (born September 17, 1974 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is a professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association. He currently plays power forward for the Detroit Pistons. At 2.10 m (6 ft 11 in) and 104 kg (230 pounds), Wallace plays power forward or center depending on the opposition.\n\nOriginally selected out of the University of North Carolina by the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) in the 1995 NBA Draft, Wallace was named to the All-Rookie second team following his first season. Following the same season he and Harvey Grant were traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Rod Strickland and Kevin Duckworth. He had a career high 42 points against the Denver Nuggets in 2001 and was a key member of the Blazers team that made it to the Western Conference Finals that same year. Wallace had a career best 19.4 points per game in 2002 for the Blazers.\n\nIn 2004 Rasheed Wallace helped power the Detroit Pistons to the NBA title and obtained his first championship ring, or \"ship\" as Rasheed would say. In Detroit, Wallace has become known for selfless team play and integrated with Ben Wallace to form the core of the Pistons' smothering defensive game.\n\nEarly Years[]\n\nRasheed was named after Harun al-Rashid, the famous Abbasid caliph during their Golden Age. Rasheed began his basketball career in Philadelphia and attended Simon Gratz High School. Rasheed was named USA Today High School Player of the Year after the 1992-93 season and was selected first team All America by Basketball Times. Despite limited playing time of just 19 minutes per game, Rasheed still managed to average 16 points, 15 rebounds and 7 blocks during his senior year. In addition to basketball, Rasheed also ran track and high jumped as a teenager.\n\nCollege[]\n\nUniversity of North Carolina then-coach Dean Smith lured Rasheed to Chapel Hill, North Carolina for his college years. Smith was a revered mentor to Wallace as he was to Wallace's eventual Detroit coach Larry Brown; Rasheed has indicated that this North Carolina bond with Brown helped Wallace adjust quickly to the Piston system. During his time at Carolina, Rasheed had tremendous success in the national spotlight. Named a second-team All-American by the AP his second year, Rasheed ranks as the leading career field goal shooter in Atlantic Coast Conference history with a .635 percentage.\n\nRasheed helped lead the Tar Heels to the NCAA Final Four in 1995. Rasheed left North Carolina to enter the 1995 NBA Draft after his sophomore season. Wallace was selected in the 1st round, the 4th pick draft pick overall by the Washington Bullets.\n\nNBA career[]\n\nWashington[]\n\nAs a rookie in Washington, Rasheed played in 65 games, of which he started 51. While mostly playing power forward, he also gained experience in the center position although being physically overmatched. Wallace was selected to the rookie team for the All-Star Weekend. Later that year, he fractured his left thumb during a game against Orlando and could not return until the following year.\n\nPortland[]\n\nAfter the season, Rasheed was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, a move that proved beneficial for both sides. He led the Blazers in scoring 12 times, and also ranked third in the league in field goal percentage. Unfortunately, just as his season was gaining momentum, Rasheed again broke his left thumb—ironically in a game against the Bullets—and was forced to miss the next month of the season, but he returned in time for a strong performance in the first round playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite the Blazers losing the series, Wallace's play was a bright spot that gave Blazer fans something to look forward to in 97-98.\n\nRasheed's next season was one of many highs. The young superstar signed a long term contract to stay with the Portland Trail Blazers. Rasheed was showcased as the team's all-around player on a club with many specialists. Rasheed began extending himself into the community more than ever, most notably with his Rasheed Wallace Foundation, but his career suffered from numerous missteps on and off the court. Wallace was also suspended by the NBA for seven games for threatening an official on an arena loading dock after a home game. That was the league's longest suspension for something that didn't involve physical contact or substance abuse.\n\nRasheed led the Trail Blazers to the Western Conference Finals in 1999 and 2000, losing to the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers, respectively. Both teams would go on to win the NBA Finals. The 2000 series against the Lakers was most noted for the Blazers blowing a 13 point lead going into the fourth quarter of game 7. Wallace would never again experience that level of success with Portland.\n\nDetroit[]\n\nAfter some mediocre years, Rasheed was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, who after one game dealt him to the Detroit Pistons in a three-way trade. He established himself as a regular starter. Detroit fans are so taken with Rasheed they chant 'SHEED' when he touches the ball—the result is a loud, low murmur. After falling behind against the Indiana Pacers in the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals, Rasheed stated boldly in an interview that \"We will win game 2\", a promise he helped fulfill, starting the popular phrase \"Guaransheed\". He helped them win an unexpected NBA title, beating the heavily favored Lakers 4 games to 1. After the championship season, he paid for replica WWE World Heavyweight Championship belts to be made for each of his teammates and presented them as gifts when the next season's training started.\n\nIn the off-season following the Piston's championship win, Rasheed Wallace signed a 5-year, $57 million contract to remain in Detroit.\n\nThroughout the 2004-05 season, Wallace often carried the belt into his locker before games to inspire the Pistons' title defense. He had several notable moments in the playoffs. After the second-round elimination of the Pacers, Rasheed played his best series of the postseason in the Eastern Conference finals against the top-seeded Miami Heat. After falling behind again, he again \"guaranteed success\". He shot a 50 percent field goal percentage and averaged 14.5 points a game in the series' seven games, and saved his hottest-shooting night for the decisive Game 7. Against the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals, Rasheed's tenacious defense and clutch shooting helped the Pistons to split the series 3-3, but in the last game, the Pistons lost 81-74.\n\nOn February 9, 2006, Wallace was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference.\n\nPlayer Profile[]\n\nAs of 2006, Wallace is one of the most versatile power forwards in today's game. He is a legitimate two-way threat, being tough on defense and potent on offense.\n\nOn defense, Wallace has established himself as a smothering post presence, playing with great intensity and forming one of the great defensive frontcourts with Ben Wallace. Because of his height, athleticism and long arms, Rasheed is considered notoriously hard to post up against. He has established himself as a perennial NBA All-Defensive Team candidate.\n\nOn offense, he is capable of making almost any play, from a slam dunk to a long 3-point jump shot. Earlier in his career, he had mostly been a low post weapon, with an arsenal of moves reminiscent of another low post artist, Hakeem Olajuwon, but later added a solid midrange shot and even extended his range beyond the arc. Rasheed Wallace has credited his years at North Carolina in becoming a technically and fundamentally sound player.\n\nDetractors point out his relatively weak rebounding (his lifetime average of 6.9 is not considered remarkable for a power forward). Moreover, critics point out that with his talent, Wallace should be a legitimate superstar and franchise player like Tim Duncan or Kevin Garnett, not \"just\" a remarkable player, and question his desire to really make 100% of his potential.\n\nHowever, as of 2006, Wallace has established himself as one of the premier power forwards in the game. He also leads the NBA in technical fouls every season.\n\nControversy[]\n\nWallace is a controversial player. Earlier in his career he regularly led the NBA in technical fouls and earned a bad reputation amongst referees as a result of problems on and off the court (which is why he was often booed during away games). He seldomly spoke with the media, aside from generally commenting, \"It was a good game. Both teams played hard.\" He often boisterously yells \"The ball don't lie\" when opponents miss a free throw, if he feels that there shouldn't have been a foul called. This is sometimes misunderstood by other players and fans.\n\nWallace's missteps off the court included marijuana possession, use of abusive language, and driving without a driver's license [1] [2] [3].\n\nIt must be noted, however, that Wallace has vastly improved his behavior on and off the court since joining the Pistons. Wallace's teammates have nearly universally praised his presence in the locker room, and his image has been rehabilitated somewhat since coming to Detroit. In addition, Wallace participates in various community activities. The Rasheed A. Wallace Foundation [4] was established in 1997 to assist in the recreational and educational development of youth in Philadelphia, PA, Portland, OR, Durham, NC, and other selected communities. However, Wallace still led the league in technical fouls during the 2005-06 season with 16 and was suspended for one game because of that total.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nRasheed and Fatima Wallace have four children: a son and daughter together, in addition to a son each from previous relationships.\n\nOwns a record label.\n\nIs a fan of the Philadelphia Flyers and Philadelphia Phillies, but not the Philadelphia Eagles. He roots instead for the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nRasheed Wallace almost missed the start of a game after forgetting to set his clock forward one hour for Daylight Savings Time.\n\nTransactions[]\n\nJune 28, 1995: Drafted by the Washington Bullets in the 1st round (4th overall) in 1995.\n\nJuly 15, 1996: Washington Bullets traded Mitchell Butler and Rasheed Wallace to the Portland Trail Blazers for Rod Strickland and Harvey Grant.\n\nFebruary 9, 2004: Portland Trail Blazers traded Rasheed Wallace and Wesley Person to the Atlanta Hawks for Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Theo Ratliff and Dan Dickau.\n\nFebruary 19, 2004: In a three-way trade: The Detroit Pistons acquired Rasheed Wallace from the Atlanta Hawks and Mike James from the Boston Celtics; the Hawks acquired Zeljko Rebraca, Bob Sura, a first-round draft pick from the Pistons, and Chris Mills from the Celtics; the Celtics acquired Lindsey Hunter, Chucky Atkins and a first-round draft pick from the Pistons.\n\nJuly 8, 2009: Signed as an unrestricted free agent by the Boston Celtics.\n\nStatistics[]\n\nTotals[]\n\nSeason Team G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 1996 WSB 65 51 1788 275 565 .487 27 82 .329 78 120 .650 93 210 303 85 42 54 103 206 655 1997 POR 62 56 1892 380 681 .558 9 33 .273 169 265 .638 122 297 419 74 48 59 114 198 938 1998 POR 77 77 2896 466 875 .533 8 39 .205 184 278 .662 132 346 478 195 75 88 167 268 1124 1999 POR 49 18 1414 242 476 .508 13 31 .419 131 179 .732 57 184 241 60 48 54 80 175 628 2000 POR 81 77 2845 542 1045 .519 8 50 .160 233 331 .704 129 437 566 142 87 107 157 216 1325 2001 POR 77 75 2940 590 1178 .501 52 162 .321 245 320 .766 147 455 602 212 90 135 158 206 1477 2002 POR 79 79 2963 603 1287 .469 114 317 .360 201 274 .734 136 509 645 152 101 101 131 212 1521 2003 POR 74 74 2684 515 1094 .471 110 307 .358 200 272 .735 113 435 548 153 70 77 140 223 1340 2004 POR 45 44 1675 296 669 .442 59 173 .341 115 155 .742 69 229 298 114 36 72 87 131 766 2004 ATL 1 1 42 8 24 .333 1 6 .167 3 3 1.000 1 5 6 2 1 5 3 0 20 2004 DET 22 21 673 121 281 .431 22 69 .319 38 54 .704 32 123 155 40 24 45 29 59 302 2004 Total 68 66 2390 425 974 .436 82 248 .331 156 212 .736 102 357 459 156 61 122 119 190 1088 2005 DET 79 79 2687 467 1062 .440 75 236 .318 136 195 .697 174 470 644 142 65 115 127 236 1145 2006 DET 80 80 2780 459 1067 .430 155 434 .357 136 183 .743 90 457 547 182 82 130 85 232 1209 2007 DET 75 72 2419 357 843 .423 104 296 .351 108 137 .788 90 453 543 127 75 118 94 225 926 2008 DET 77 76 2346 376 870 .432 112 315 .356 115 150 .767 84 427 511 137 91 129 86 213 979 2009 DET 66 63 2123 302 720 .419 113 319 .354 78 101 .772 56 434 490 91 62 86 59 197 795 Career 1009 943 34167 5999 12737 .471 982 2869 .342 2170 3017 .719 1525 5471 6996 1908 997 1375 1620 2997 15150\n\nPer Game[]\n\nSeason Team G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 1996 WSB 65 51 27.5 4.2 8.7 .487 0.4 1.3 .329 1.2 1.8 .650 1.4 3.2 4.7 1.3 0.6 0.8 1.6 3.2 10.1 1997 POR 62 56 30.5 6.1 11.0 .558 0.1 0.5 .273 2.7 4.3 .638 2.0 4.8 6.8 1.2 0.8 1.0 1.8 3.2 15.1 1998 POR 77 77 37.6 6.1 11.4 .533 0.1 0.5 .205 2.4 3.6 .662 1.7 4.5 6.5 2.5 1.0 1.1 2.2 3.5 14.6 1999 POR 49 18 28.9 4.9 9.7 .508 0.3 0.6 .419 2.7 3.7 .732 1.2 3.8 4.9 1.2 1.0 1.1 1.6 3.6 12.8 2000 POR 81 77 35.1 6.7 12.9 .519 0.1 0.6 .160 2.9 4.1 .704 1.6 5.4 7.0 1.8 1.1 1.3 1.9 2.7 16.4 2001 POR 77 75 38.2 7.7 15.3 .501 0.7 2.1 .321 3.2 4.2 .766 1.9 5.9 7.8 2.8 1.2 1.8 2.1 2.7 19.2 2002 POR 79 79 37.5 7.6 16.3 .469 1.4 4.0 .360 2.5 3.5 .734 1.7 6.4 8.2 1.9 1.3 1.3 1.7 2.7 19.3 2003 POR 74 74 36.3 7.0 14.8 .471 1.5 4.1 .358 2.7 3.7 .735 1.5 5.9 7.4 2.1 0.9 1.0 1.9 3.0 18.1 2004 POR 45 44 37.2 6.6 14.9 .442 1.3 3.8 .341 2.6 3.4 .742 1.5 5.1 6.6 2.5 0.8 1.6 1.9 2.9 17.0 2004 ATL 1 1 42.0 8.0 24.0 .333 1.0 6.0 .167 3.0 3.0 1.000 1.0 5.0 6.0 2.0 1.0 5.0 3.0 0.0 20.0 2004 DET 22 21 30.6 5.5 12.8 .431 1.0 3.1 .319 1.7 2.5 .704 1.5 5.6 7.0 1.8 1.1 2.0 1.3 2.7 13.7 2004 Total 68 66 35.1 6.3 14.3 .436 1.2 3.6 .331 2.3 3.1 .736 1.5 5.3 6.8 2.3 0.9 1.8 1.8 2.8 16.0 2005 DET 79 79 34.0 5.9 13.4 .440 0.9 3.0 .318 1.7 2.5 .697 2.2 5.9 8.2 1.8 0.8 1.5 1.6 3.0 14.5 2006 DET 80 80 34.8 5.7 13.3 .430 1.9 5.4 .357 1.7 2.3 .743 1.1 5.7 6.8 2.3 1.0 1.6 1.1 2.9 15.1 2007 DET 75 72 32.3 4.8 11.2 .423 1.4 3.9 .351 1.4 1.8 .788 1.2 6.0 7.2 1.7 1.0 1.6 1.3 3.0 12.3 2008 DET 77 76 30.5 4.9 11.3 .432 1.5 4.1 .356 1.5 1.9 .767 1.1 5.5 6.6 1.8 1.2 1.7 1.1 2.8 12.7 2009 DET 66 63 32.2 4.6 10.9 .419 1.7 4.8 .354 1.2 1.5 .772 0.8 6.6 7.4 1.4 0.9 1.3 0.9 3.0 12.0 Career 1009 943 33.9 5.9 12.6 .471 1.0 2.8 .342 2.2 3.0 .719 1.5 5.4 6.9 1.9 1.0 1.4 1.6 3.0 15.0\n\nAwards and Accomplishments[]\n\nSee also[]\n\n[]\n\nRasheed Wallace Fansite\n\nWeb Directory[]\n\nNBA player file\n\nOfficial Homepage\n\nNeed 4 Sheed.com - Downloads Fansite\n\nA fansite\n\nThe Rasheed Wallace Foundation\n\nSI.com - Pro Basketball - Rasheed Wallace Player Page\n\nStatistics[]\n\nNews, Opinion, and Rumors[]"
