        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. | Dwyane Wade scored 39 points, Udonis Haslem hit a short jumper with 6.3 seconds left and the Miami Heat beat the short-handed Detroit Pistons, 101-96, on Sunday.\n\nWade also blocked two shots in the final 30 seconds, helping fifth-place Miami stretch its lead over Detroit to three games in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\nRodney Stuckey scored 24 points and Antonio McDyess had 16 points and 14 rebounds for the seventh-place Pistons.\n\nDetroit led for most of the game despite missing three key players - Richard Hamilton (groin), Rasheed Wallace (calf) and Allen Iverson (back). Iverson has missed 13 straight games, while Wallace has been out for seven and Hamilton four.\n\nOther Games Sunday:\n\nTHUNDER 97, TIMBERWOLVES 90: Kevin Durant scored 30 points, Jeff Green added 17 and Oklahoma City beat the lethargic Minnesota Timberwolves. Durant has scored more than 20 points in 16 of his last 17 games for the Thunder, who improved to 7-5 in their last 12 games.\n\nRAPTORS 100, CLIPPERS 76: Chris Bosh had 16 points and 13 rebounds, Shawn Marion added 14 points and 13 boards and the Toronto Raptors beat the Los Angeles Clippers. Jose Calderon scored 15 points and Joey Graham added 13 for the Raptors, who have won five of six against the Clippers.\n\nROCKETS 87, SPURS 85: Luis Scola dropped in the winning layup with 11.2 seconds left after a bullet pass from Yao Ming, and the Houston Rockets rallied in the fourth to wrest first place in the division from the San Antonio Spurs. Ron Artest scored 24 as Houston won its fifth straight to reclaim the top spot in the division for the first time since Christmas Day. Tim Duncan scored 23 points for the Spurs, who watched its longtime grip as the No. 2 team in West disappear when Matt Bonner's 3-pointer at the buzzer clanked off the rim. Scola finished with 19 points and 17 rebounds.\n\nCAVALIERS 96, NETS 88: LeBron James had 30 points and 11 rebounds, and Cleveland won its ninth straight game to tie a franchise record with its 57th victory. Zydrunas Ilgauskas added 18 points and became the career leader in blocked shots for the Cavaliers, who improved the NBA's best record to 57-13. Vince Carter had 25 points and nine rebounds, but without injured All-Star point guard Devin Harris the Nets simply lacked the firepower to hang with the NBA's toughest defensive team. New Jersey had its two-game winning streak snapped and fell two games behind Chicago for the eighth and final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference."
