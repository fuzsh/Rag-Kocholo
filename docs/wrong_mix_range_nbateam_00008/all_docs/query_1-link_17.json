        "text": "Chris Trotman/Getty Images\n\nSure, those Miami Heat have won 22 straight games, but they have it easy.\n\nThat's pretty much the sentiment from Tracy McGrady, a former NBA player who recently took his talents over to the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nThe 33-year-old offered his opinion on the Heat's latest winning streak to ESPN's Chris Broussard. It makes sense because McGrady was part of the 2007-08 Houston Rockets team that won 22 straight games.\n\nAs for the current streak, he isn't impressed:\n\nI'm enjoying watching because of the unknown. But the way we did it was a lot harder. Having Yao [Ming] go out [due to injury] around the 12th game and Dikembe [Mutombo] filling his role was huge for our team. And we didn't have three guys making $100 million.\n\nYou see, back in his day, NBA players were forced to attain winning streaks through tremendous toil and hardship. Oh, and they did it in the snow, while walking uphill, both ways.\n\nMcGrady might come across as nothing more than an old grump if he didn't actually have a teeny-weeny point here.\n\nAs Broussard reminds us, that particular Rockets team wasn't exactly star-studded. You can take a look at the underwhelming marvel at Basketball Reference.\n\nThe Rockets won 12 straight games before losing Yao Ming to a broken left foot. At that time, a 41-year-old Dikembe Mutombo stepped up and helped the team win 10 more games.\n\nFine, they had to go through some turmoil. But that doesn't mean the Heat's streak isn't just as amazing.\n\nNot that people will stop asking players for their thoughts on the victories. Paul Pierce and Jason Terry recently sounded off on the streak, via Complex.\n\nPierce offered this salty sentiment: \"I really don't even care. I hope they lose every game the rest of the season. I just worry about what this team does.\"\n\nTerry was not amused, either, and offered, \"Not really impressed with it or anything that they do.\"\n\nEven Broussard asked Kobe Bryant his thoughts on the Heat winning, to which he replied, via text, \"Did you really ask me that?? Lol.\"\n\nThe only people happy the Heat are winning are relegated to the Miami area. It seems any other current and former players will find reason to dismiss it entirely.\n\nThat concludes your \"no duh\" report of the day."
