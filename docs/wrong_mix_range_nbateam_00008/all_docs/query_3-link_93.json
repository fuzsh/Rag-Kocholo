        "text": "Three people have been charged in the deadly May 10 shooting of a man in Greenville.\n\nAccording to Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez, Makiyy Randolph, 21, of Paterson, and two juveniles, have been arrested in connection with the shooting, which left 24-year-old Rasheed Wallace of Jersey City dead.\n\nA resident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that at approximately 10 p.m., Wallace, who was at the wheel of a car, was shot the head in front of 28 Pearsall Ave. The car subsequently crashed into parked cars nearby.\n\nResponding to a report of shots fired in the area of Pearsall Avenue and Garfield Avenue, responding officers found Wallace with an apparent gunshot wound to the upper body. He was taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead a short time later. The Regional Medical Examiner’s Office determined the shooting to be a homicide.\n\nRandolph is charged with Murder, Felony Murder, Robbery, Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, Possession of a Weapon for an Unlawful Purpose, and Unlawful Possession of a Weapon.\n\nRandolph was arrested on July 12 on Gates Avenue in Jersey City after a brief foot pursuit. He was additionally charged with Obstruction and Resisting Arrest by Flight. He is currently being detained at the Hudson County Correctional Facility.\n\nA 14-year-old female and a 16-year-old male are charged as juveniles with Murder, Felony Murder, Robbery, Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, Possession of a Weapon for an Unlawful Purpose, and Unlawful Possession of a Weapon. Both juveniles were arrested at the Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office in Secaucus on July 11. Because of the confidentiality of juvenile proceedings, authorities are releasing no further information."
