        "text": "Dwyane Wade of course won three championships with the franchise over the course of his Hall of Fame career, but recently, he stopped by good friend Carmel0 Anthony’s 7PM In Brooklyn podcast to break down why the most enjoyable season of his career was actually the first. “My rookie year, there wasn’t any expectations,” said Wade, via 7pm In Brooklyn with Carmelo Anthony on YouTube. “We were just hooping, we were terrible. We started 0 – 7, we were terrible. So roll the ball out, let’s just go have fun, right. You’re making a name for yourself, you’re living your dream out for the first time, the road trips are new, going to these hotels was exciting. The first year for me was the funnest year I played in the NBA, then I got Shaq in my second year and it became business. Quickly, you got to win now, it changed everything for me. I didn’t get five years to be a young guy, I had to get right to it, right away. So my first year when it was Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, Brian Grant, Eddie Jones, and we made a run and being in the playoffs and all that, we were just out here having fun.”\n\nBob Whitsitt: Well, I could second guess every deal. There’s always something I can do better. There’s no question about it. I think the one thing I fought for at the time, and I was overruled, and I don’t mean that in the wrong way… at the end of the day, I’m an employee, I do the best I can do but owners ultimately make the final decision on everything. But I drafted a player in the first round in Portland. It was the 1996 draft, Jermaine O’Neal. He didn’t bloom quite as quickly as Kobe did. They were the same draft but he was blooming and I knew he was gonna be a really good player. Around 1999 or 2000, somewhere in there, maybe 2001, we were in a situation where we were going to lose Brian Grant to unrestricted free agency and the owner just didn’t want to give him a new seven-year contract at the max because he has some injury history and I didn’t disagree with that. I wish we could have kept Brian but I just couldn’t talk them into a three- or four-year contract, which is as far as the owner was willing to go. He was able to get a seven-year max from Miami, so we knew we were going to lose him.\n\nMiami could offer three first-round picks along with Lowry as the primary matching salary. The Lakers would probably ask for Tyler Herro. That would be the sticking point in negotiations. The last time the Lakers and Heat made a trade of this magnitude, the Lakers tried a similar staredown involving Dwyane Wade and blinked. They ultimately sent Shaquille O’Neal to the Heat for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler and Brian Grant. It’s hard not to draw parallels to that trade when speculating about this one. Both deals began with an aging legend growing frustrated as the Lakers prioritized the future over the present.\n\nWhitsitt: When Jermaine was a free agent, I was able to get him to re-sign. And I did make a commitment that if he didn’t get a fair shake … I’d try to move [him] somewhere where [he] could get some playing time. Dunleavy: I have Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace and Brian Grant—three guys that are right there, as far as All-Stars in this league. And I’m expected to win every single game. Whitsitt: For whatever reason, Mike did not like Jermaine and just didn’t want to play him, didn’t want to develop him. He had some personality issues with him. Pippen: At some point, I saw where he broke Jermaine’s spirit."
