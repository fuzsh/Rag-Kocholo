        "text": "Before we get into this lengthy list of missing legends in the NBA 2K series, let's first acknowledge the franchise's nearly unrivaled respect to the history of the sport it emulates. Perhaps no other sports gaming franchise (Madden, MLB The Show, FIFA, PES, NBA Live, EA UFC, F1) pays homage to classic players and teams like NBA 2K.\n\nIt must be a 2K thing because the WWE 2K series is the only thing close when it comes to including legends, arenas, etc.\n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, there are still a healthy list of players from the past who should be included in the NBA 2K series but aren't, based on the near final build that I played a week ago.\n\nThere are licensing issues preventing 2K from including some of the more obvious players on the list. Others, 2K may not have gotten around to contacting. In any case, I believe I've put together perhaps the most comprehensive list of missing legends for the 2K franchise.\n\nI have 100 players listed here. I won't make a case, or attempt to explain the absence for all of them. Instead, I'll focus on the Top 10, and then simply list the other 90.\n\nCharles Barkley\n\nI'd have to say Sir Charles is the single biggest missing piece on this front. In case you don't know the story, Barkley was briefly included in the game as a part of the Dream Team in NBA 2K13.\n\n2K ran it back with Barkley as a member of the Dream Team again for NBA 2K17:\n\nReportedly, this temporary deal was brokered by Jay Z. However, Barkley still refuses to allow his likeness to be used in 2K permanently until the publisher donates $1 million to the NBA Alumni Association.\n\nIt appears there is something of a disconnect between the two sides as it doesn't appear as though 2K is against spending to secure valuable licenses. However, if it will cost 2K an additional $1 million on top of what they are already paying out in licensing fees just to add the former 76ers and Suns great, I can understand the issue.\n\nHopefully, one day we'll see Barkley added as a classic player for the 92-93 Phoenix Suns, a retro 76ers squad as well as the All-Time teams for both franchises, and finally as the third member of the NBA on TNT-like show that is in game with Shaquille O'Neal, Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith.\n\nReggie Miller\n\nLike Barkley, Miller is one of the most requested Hall-of-Famers not included in 2K. Miller says he hasn't been offered proper compensation for his likeness as of yet, and that explains his absence.\n\nEssentially, Miller doesn't need the money and thus doesn't have to accept the going rate for a player of his caliber, or the scale that has been established between 2K and other retired stars. Miller doesn't appear to have much interest in the gaming space, thus there is no pressure or desire to work things out just for the sake of being in the game.\n\nThe \"it would be cool to be in the game\" factor isn't present here.\n\nManu Ginobili\n\nThis is a new one, and I think there is a perfectly good explanation for Manu's absence. Ginobili just retired and while 2K obviously had license to use him in the game while he was a member of the NBA Player's Association, he is now retired which requires a separate deal.\n\nI haven't spoken with anyone about this, but I'm assuming that's why he's not in the roster screens that I've seen. I wouldn't be surprised if he were added in an early patch, or at the latest, for NBA 2K21.\n\nRasheed Wallace\n\nWallace hasn't been in an NBA 2K game since he retired in 2013. I don't know for sure, but his omission is likely similar to the Miller situation.\n\nDavid West\n\nI believe West and Ginobili are in the same boat.\n\nJosh Smith\n\nThe absence of this former Atlanta Hawks star is a little peculiar. Since leaving the Hawks he's gone in and out of the league with his most recent stint in 2018 with the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nHe deserves to be on the All-Time Atlanta Hawks if you look at some of the players who are currently on that roster.\n\nTayshaun Prince\n\nAlong with Wallace and Ginobili, Prince is one of the biggest omissions from a classic team included in the game. The 03-04 Detroit Pistons squad just isn't complete without Prince and Wallace.\n\nPrince used to be in the game, but hasn't been added since he retired.\n\nRon Artest\n\nNo matter which name 2K uses, the game needs Artest aka Metta World Peace. He was one of the greatest defensive players of all-time, and just prior to the Malice in the Palace incident, he'd become one of the best all-around players.\n\nHe should be on the All-Time Pacers squad.\n\nHal Greer\n\nOf all of the great players from the 1950s and 60s, the absence of Greer is the most glaring. He is one of the greatest scoring guards in history, an NBA champion and Hall-of-Famer.\n\nI'm not sure why he's not in the game because there is a head made for him within the 2K files on PC.\n\nHopefully, Greer gets in this year. With 2K20 allowing guards to be more impacting, he could be a force in MyTeam and on the All-Time 76ers team.\n\nAlvin Robertson\n\nFor years, Robertson's reputation as a man, not just a player, has been stained by a heinous and false accusation. Robertson spent parts of a five-year span in prison and/or fighting these charges. While he was exonerated of all charges stemming from the accusations, the stigma attached to his name may never go away.\n\nRobertson hasn't been a saint. He has some other legal issues in his past, but many of the legends who are in the game have some blemishes as well. With this most serious and inhumane charge lifted from him, it's a good time to consider adding him to an All-Time Spurs squad.\n\nRobertson is arguably the greatest on-ball defender in NBA history, and one of the most prolific in registering steals. As a player, he'd be a great addition to the game.\n\nHere is the rest of the list. Some of the players may be in MyTeam, but they should also be playable in offline modes.\n\nDan Roundfield\n\nZelmo Beaty\n\nJohn Drew\n\nEd Macauley\n\nAnthony Mason\n\nNorm Van Lier\n\nChet Walker\n\nKirk Hinrich\n\nMo Williams\n\nRoy Tarpley\n\nByron Beck\n\nRalph Simpson\n\nLarry Jones\n\nLarry Foust\n\nBailey Howell\n\nGeorge Yardley\n\nGene Shue\n\nPaul Arizin\n\nNeil Johnston\n\nJoe Fulks\n\nLamar Odom\n\nTom Gola\n\nGuy Rodgers\n\nRobert Reid\n\nAllen Leavell\n\nMel Daniels\n\nRoger Brown\n\nBob Netolicky\n\nFreddie Lewis\n\nBilly Knight\n\nBill Keller\n\nAndrew Bynum\n\nRandy Smith\n\nBob Kaufmann\n\nSwen Nater\n\nLoy Vaught\n\nBenoit Benjamin\n\nVern Mikkelsen\n\nChris Bosh\n\nSlater Martin\n\nTony Allen\n\nMike Miller\n\nStromile Swift\n\nLorenzen Wright\n\nOJ Mayo\n\nJames Jones\n\nBill Melchionni\n\nBilly Paultz\n\nBrian Taylor\n\nJohn Williamson\n\nSam Mitchell\n\nMicheal Williams\n\nAnthony Peeler\n\nNikola Pekovic\n\nJamaal Magloire\n\nRyan Anderson\n\nJarrett Jack\n\nHarry Gallatin\n\nCarl Braun\n\nDick McGuire\n\nWillie Naulls\n\nGus Williams\n\nNick Collison\n\nLarry Costello\n\nPaul Seymour\n\nSidney Wicks\n\nBob Davies\n\nJack Twyman\n\nBobby Wanzer\n\nArnie Risen\n\nMaurice Stokes\n\nSam Lacey\n\nJack Coleman\n\nJohn Beasley\n\nMatt Bonner\n\nMalik Rose\n\nAndrea Bargnani\n\nMorris Peterson\n\nMehmet Okur\n\nGus Johnson\n\nJuwan Howard\n\nWalt Bellamy\n\nKevin Loughery\n\nJeff Ruland\n\nGreg Ballard\n\nKenny Walker\n\nHarold Miner\n\nRichard Dumas\n\nBen Gordon\n\nDolph Schayes\n\nAre there any players that I left out?
