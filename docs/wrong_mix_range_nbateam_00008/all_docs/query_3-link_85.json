        "text": "Matt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: A tall, long, and talented player who is one of the best overall power forwards in the game. Has good enough size and strength to slide up to the center spot periodically. Isnt as athletic as he once was, but has retained his mobility and most of his explosiveness. Proven to be equally effective from the inside as the outside. Can present matchup problems. Put up incredible numbers at UNC under Dean Smith who developed him into a star by his sophomore year in 1995. Plays with a lot of heart, but lets his fierce competitiveness get the better of him at times. Well known for his propensity to receive technical fouls. Very outspoken. A three-time All-Star, whose addition allowed the Pistons to win the NBA Championship in 2004.\n\nOffense: Immensely talented inside-outside threat. Gets most of his offense by posting up, but spots up on the perimeter pretty frequently as well. Very high consistent release. Capable from hitting shots all the way out past the three point line. Tremendously consistent from that range for his size and skill set. Great post game. Likes to turn over his right shoulder to his reliable hook shot. Tough to spot due to his mixture of length and physicality. Wont dribble to score. No reason to guard his drive on the perimeter. Needs to be recognized when trailing plays. Lights out when unguarded. Very good midrange game as well. Capable of hitting turnarounds and fade aways with impressive range. Sets very solid screens. Can roll to the rim or pop out to the outside. Great hands. Good offensive rebounder. May not score as much as he used to, but hes still as dangerous and efficient as he was in his prime.\n\nDefense: Detroits best post defender. Makes everyone else look better when hes on the floor. Quickness and experience make him one of the best help side defenders in the game. Always rotates to meet penetration. Goes straight up on jump shooters. Capable of defending the post one-on-one without help. Doesnt fall for fakes. Gives his man a ton of contact when he tries to back down. Plays with a lot of heart. Sure handed. Great timing when blocking and going for strips. Gets steals by reaching in on midrange shooter and swiping the ball. Good area rebounder. Will hack some shooters, but gives smart fouls for the most part. Physical traits, basketball IQ, and defensive mentality make him a great asset to have on this end."
