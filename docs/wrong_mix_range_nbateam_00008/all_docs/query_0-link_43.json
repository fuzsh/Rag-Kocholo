        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. - The Detroit Pistons showed the Miami Heat that their many moves might not make a difference.\n\nChauncey Billups scored 30 and Richard Hamilton had 25 points and a season-high nine assists Thursday night leading Detroit past the Heat 106-101 in a rematch of the last season's Eastern Conference finals.\n\nIn their first matchup since the Pistons won at Miami in Game 7 of the series, Detroit used clutch shots and key defensive plays in the final minutes to pull away in the close game.\n\nDetroit has won a season-high nine straight games. The Pistons are an NBA-best 24-3, with a 27-game record that trails just two teams in NBA history.\n\nDwyane Wade had 33 points, Shaquille O'Neal scored 26 and Jason Williams chipped in with 20 points for the Heat, who had won seven of nine games.\n\nMiami added players through free agency and trades in the offseason, and Pat Riley replaced Stan Van Gundy as coach earlier this month.\n\nThe Pistons have had the same starting five for nearly two years, a span that includes one NBA title and falling just short of a repeat.\n\nDetroit's Rasheed Wallace scored 21 points and Tayshaun Prince added 13.\n\nThe Pistons, off to the best start in franchise history, have won 13 games in December for the first time and have lost only once this month.\n\nFollowing 17 lead changes and 15 ties, Rasheed Wallace's 3-pointer gave Detroit an 83-74 lead with 10:49 left.\n\nMiami then scored seven straight points to pull within two, a deficit the Heat had four more times in the fourth quarter before Williams' steal and basket made it 95-all with 4:11 to go.\n\nAfter two more ties, Billups' layup and Rasheed Wallace's fourth 3-pointer put the Pistons ahead 104-99 with 1:04 remaining.\n\nDetroit sealed the win on the next two possessions when Prince forced Wade into an errant shot, and Ben Wallace tipped the ball away from O'Neal.\n\nNUGGETS:\n\nMarcus Camby, the NBA's leading rebounder, underwent surgery Thursday on his right broken pinkie, the latest in a long list of injuries that have hampered Denver.\n\nHe'll be out at least one to two weeks, possibly longer.\n\nSONICS:\n\nSeattle forward Danny Fortson was suspended for two games without pay Thursday for berating a referee and failing to promptly leave the court after an ejection.\n\nROCKETS:\n\nHouston signed guard John Lucas III and forward Josh Davis on Thursday, and waived swingman Stephen Graham.\n\nLucas is the son of former NBA player and coach John Lucas, who was the first pick of the 1976 draft by the Rockets.\n\nThe league granted the Rockets a 16th player on their roster because of injuries.\n\nLucas III averaged 15.1 points in 14 games for Tulsa of the NBDL after being cut by the Minnesota Timberwolves earlier this season.\n\nHis father played 14 years for six teams before coaching at San Antonio, Philadelphia and Cleveland.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 Davis saw limited action in four games for the Milwaukee Bucks earlier this season. He averaged 2.8 points and 7.8 minutes in 42 games with the Philadelphia 76ers last season.\n\nDavis was the MVP of the CBA in 2003, when he averaged 18.7 points and 9.6 rebounds.\n\nGraham signed with the Rockets on Dec. 10 and averaged 2.8 points and 1.2 rebounds in six games."
