        "text": "Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nThe Miami Heat aren't in need of major changes, nor should they be with Miami Thrice on the job (or whatever we're calling LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh these days).\n\nBut in recent losses to the Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Lakers with Chris Bosh out of the lineup, they did prove to be thin on the front line.\n\nEnter Rasheed Wallace.\n\nWait a second, did you just write Rasheed Wallace?\n\nThat's right. The retired power forward recently worked out with the team, according to Chris Tomasson of FOX Sports.\n\nA source close to the situation confirmed Rasheed Wallace has worked out with Heat, but source said he hasn't decided if he'll play again.’\n\n— Chris Tomasson (@christomasson) March 7, 2012\n\nWith Bosh out of the lineup, the team was crushed in the paint by the Jazz (outscored 52-38) and clearly couldn't compete against the Lakers' big men on the block.\n\nUdonis Haslem and Joel Anthony would still share the majority of the minutes with Bosh at the center and power forward positions, but adding a veteran presence like Wallace would give them one more body to bang down low in the playoffs, which are always more physical than the regular season.\n\nAnd hey, Wallace still has the ability to step outside on occasion and hit a perimeter shot, adding another dimension to the Heat's offense, even if a limited one.\n\nAnd he'll come pretty cheap.\n\nIn other words, this is a no-risk, solid-return type of move, and if Wallace wants to play, the Heat would be wise to give him that opportunity with them."
