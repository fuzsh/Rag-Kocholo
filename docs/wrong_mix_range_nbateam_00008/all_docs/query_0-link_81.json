        "text": "The 2001 Portland Trail Blazers, a team later nicknamed the “Jail Blazers” for their on-court antics, were known for their volatility. But a lesser-known incident from that era highlights the simmering tension even amongst teammates.\n\nDuring a game in early 2001, center Arvydas Sabonis, known for his European flair, took a hit from Shaquille O’Neal and went down in a dramatic flop. Unfortunately, his flailing arm inadvertently connected with teammate Rasheed Wallace’s face.\n\nWallace, a notoriously fiery competitor, reacted with immediate anger. He stormed off the court, grabbed a towel on the bench, and flung it at Sabonis’ face. Shouting threats, Wallace reportedly yelled,\n\n“I’ll f**k you up!”\n\nThe normally calm Sabonis surprised everyone with his response. In a low, chilling voice, he reportedly uttered,\n\n“I will kill him.”\n\nThe “I will kill him” quote may not be the most remembered moment from the Jail Blazers era, but it serves as a reminder of the team’s unpredictable nature."
