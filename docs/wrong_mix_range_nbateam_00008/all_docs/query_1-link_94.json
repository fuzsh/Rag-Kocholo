        "text": "After getting blasted for a rough foul on Patty Mills, Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green is at it again during their game against the Orlando Magic. And if this trend continues, he’s going to break a record no one in the NBA would want to have.\n\nDuring a game between the Warriors and Magic, Green found himself arguing with Ray Acosta, one of the assigned referees, after getting called for a personal foul. A few minutes later, All-Star guard Stephen Curry was called for a shooting foul just as Orlando star Paolo Banchero was driving to the basket, prompting the forward to come in his defense by yelling at the referee.\n\nAcosta didn’t take Green’s reaction lightly and issued the Warriors star with a technical foul. Instead of being deterred, he continued shouting in the referees face before his teammates and members of the coaching staff led him away. From there, Acosta gave Green another technical foul, ejecting the All-Star forward from the game in the process.\n\nFortunately, the Warriors went home with the 101-93 win against Orlando. Andrew Wiggins led the team with 23 points and six rebounds while Stephen Curry dropped 17 points and 10 assists. The Magic, on the other hand, had Cole Anthony came off the bench to tally 26 points and seven rebounds.\n\nGolden State Warriors Star Draymond Green On Course to Beating Rasheed Wallace’s Record of Most Ejections in NBA History\n\nIt’s no secret Green is a magnet for controversy whenever he plays a game. And if a tweet from Ball Is Life on X is to be believed, there’s a chance the Warriors star might break a record no one wants in the NBA sooner than later.\n\n“Most ejections in NBA history\n\n29: Rasheed Wallace\n\n21: Draymond Green\n\n17: Dwight Howard\n\n16: Charles Barkley & Anthony Mason\n\n14: Shaq & Boogie Cousins,” as per Ball Is Life.\n\nAs it stands, Green is only eight games away from becoming the NBA’s all-time leader in ejections. If he doesn’t want that record, the Warriors forward must be more patient in the coming weeks.\n\nGreen’s antics have come at the most unfortunate time. Hopefully, he gets it together to give Golden State a better chance of making the playoffs.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
