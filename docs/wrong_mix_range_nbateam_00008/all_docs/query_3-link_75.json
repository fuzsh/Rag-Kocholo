        "text": "After a playing career that spanned multiple decades, Rasheed Wallace is one of the most recognizable figures in the basketball world. Nearly a decade after playing in his final NBA game, Wallace is now building a reputation for his work on the sidelines as a coach.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Wallace is expected to be appointed as an assistant coach for the Lakers, the first reported hire for newly-minted head coach Darvin Ham, with whom Wallace has a longstanding relationship.\n\nWallace is reportedly set to join the Lakers staff after spending a season as an assistant coach under head coach Penny Hardaway at the University of Memphis.\n\nIn addition to a big personality, Wallace brings a unique feel for the game as a 16-year NBA veteran. With Wallace also comes a few years of coaching experience, allowing him to get to this point.\n\nLAKERS: Why Lakers hired Darvin Ham | Lakers 2022 offseason outlook\n\nWhat is Wallace's coaching background and what does he bring to the Lakers? Here is how Wallace got here today.\n\nRasheed Wallace coaching history\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nShortly after retiring in 2013, Wallace was named an assistant coach of player development for the Pistons.\n\nWallace worked for the Pistons during the 2013-14 season as part of the staff assembled by head coach Maurice Cheeks. After Cheeks was fired midway through the 2013-14 season, Wallace did not return for the 2014-15 season as Stan Van Gundy hired his own staff.\n\nJordan High School (N.C.)\n\nIn 2019, Wallace was hired as the head coach of Charles E. Jordan High School in Durham, N.C., located less than 15 minutes from Chapel Hill, where he starred at the University of North Carolina.\n\nUniversity of Memphis\n\nFrom high school to college.\n\nIn 2021, Wallace was hired to join Hardaway's staff at the University of Memphis. It was at Memphis where he would also be reunited with his former head coach Larry Brown, who was also an assistant on Hardaway's staff.\n\nDue to health and safety reasons related to COVID-19, Wallace transitioned into a remote role with the Tigers in January of 2022, but Hardaway made sure to emphasize that Wallace was \"still part of who we are. He’s still a coach, even though we’re saying he’s in a consultant’s role.\"\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nShortly after Ham was hired as the Lakers head coach, reports surfaced that Wallace would be joining his former teammate in Los Angeles.\n\nWallace, a four-time All-Star, is a voice that can resonate with the Lakers star trio of LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook.\n\nThough slightly taken out of context, Wallace has spoken on LeBron's game before and witnessed James' dominance firsthand over the 51 times they went head-to-head in their respective careers.\n\nAs a transcendent stretch big man, Wallace can also connect with Davis. Just last year, Wallace spoke highly of Davis as a key to LA's success.\n\nAs for Westbrook, Wallace wasn't shy about his feelings on the former MVP, going as far as calling him the best player in the world ahead of the 2021 Play-In Tournament.\n\nThe Lakers were 33-49 during the 2021-22 season, but very rarely did they have the trio of James, Davis and Westbrook on the floor together.\n\nProvided no major moves are made this offseason, having a voice like Wallace's in the locker room could be a major step towards LA's trio figuring out how to play with one another.\n\nRasheed Wallace bio, career stats in NBA\n\nWallace's NBA career spanned 16 seasons with six franchises. After the Bullets drafted Wallace with the No. 4 overall pick in the 1995 NBA Draft following a standout college career at UNC, Wallace played one season in Washington DC before being traded to the Portland Trail Blazers. It was in Portland that Wallace blossomed into a star, making back-to-back All-Star teams in 2000 and 2001.\n\nDuring his rise to star status in Portland, Wallace also evolved into one of the NBA's best-known agitators. He famously got whistled for 41 technical fouls in the 2000-01 season, an all-time record that still stands today. Wallace played with his heart on his sleeve on both ends of the floor, a hard-nosed reputation that served him well when the Detroit Pistons traded for him midway through the 2003-04 season.\n\nThat trade pushed the Pistons over the top as the addition of Wallace catapulted them to the 2004 NBA title. Wallace spent six seasons in Detroit before one final season with the Celtics in 2009-10. After a two-year retirement, Wallace briefly returned, playing 21 games for the Knicks in 2012-13."
