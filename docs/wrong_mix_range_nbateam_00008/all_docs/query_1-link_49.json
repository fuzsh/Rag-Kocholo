        "text": "A couple of days ago, Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green refuted Rasheed Wallace for saying the 2004 Detroit Pistons can beat the 2017 iteration of the Dubs. Turns out, former Dubs star Andre Iguodala has something to say on the matter as well.\n\nIn February 2004, Wallace joined the Pistons through a three-team trade involving the Atlanta Hawks and the Boston Celtics. His arrival proved to be timely, as the 6’11” big man played a vital role in helping the Pistons reach the NBA Finals that same year. They went on to defeat the star-studded Los Angeles Lakers, featuring Shaquille O’Neal, Karl Malone, Gary Payton, and the late Kobe Bryant, to secure the championship.\n\nWallace continued to be a formidable force in Detroit for five more seasons before concluding his career with stints for the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks. Throughout his career, he established himself as one of the most physically dominant power forwards in NBA history.\n\nOn the other hand, Green played a pivotal role in introducing a position-less style of basketball to the NBA. Combined with the outside shooting prowess of All-Star point guard Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors revolutionized the sport and captured four championships in the process. Green’s versatility and contributions were instrumental in the team’s success.\n\nAndre Iguodala Says 2004 Detroit Pistons Would Have Been 2017 Golden State Warriors Toughest Opponents\n\nUnlike Warriors’ forward Draymond Green, who clapped back at Wallace, Iguodala shares a similar take but with a slightly different twist. This can be seen in a video shared by NBA Central on X.\n\nThe 2017 Warriors featured a prime Kevin Durant in his first year with the team. With him elevating the Dubs’ Death Lineup, they were able to secure a ring that year and proved to be one of the most dominant teams in NBA history.\n\nAs much as both sides have gone back and forth on the issue, there’ll be no way to find out who’s the real winner. In any case, this hypothetical showdown is clearly one for the ages.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
