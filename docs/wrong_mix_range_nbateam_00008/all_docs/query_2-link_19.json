        "text": "The two were very close, and throughout Wallace's career, Jackie would always urge him to keep his cool.\n\nHis performances at Simon Gratz lured many big-name college coaches, but North Carolina's Dean Smith won him over and the 6-foot-11 big man joined the Tar Heels in their quest for a repeat in 1993.\n\nIn 1993-94, his freshman season at UNC, Wallace averaged 9.5 points and 6.6. rebounds in a little more than 20 minutes per game.\n\nIn his sophomore and final season in a Tar Heel uniform, his numbers jumped to 16.6 points and 8.2 boards in 30 minutes per game.\n\nWallace and the Tar Heels upended Duke at Cameron Indoor on Feb. 2, 1995 in what was arguably one of the greatest games in the history of their rivalry. UNC edged the Blue Devils 102-100 in double-overtime (the 202 total points are still the most ever scored in a Duke-UNC game). A dunking exhibition by Jerry Stackhouse and Wallace in the first half helped the Tar Heels take a 17-point lead, but Duke rallied before falling short in the second overtime.\n\nA foul by Kentucky's Andre Riddick incited a maelstrom between the two teams later that season. Riddick's foul was followed by a Wallace elbow, which was followed by a Riddick attempt to choke Wallace, which was followed by both taking the bench.\n\nBut he fractured his thumb later that season and didn't return until the next year. Luckily, he was still able to root on his teammates and ...\n\nWallace was traded to the Trail Blazers after his rookie season and spent seven and a half seasons in Portland, racking up two All-Star nods, two conference finals appearances and one Christmas tree shopping adventure with Scottie Pippen and Erick Barkley.\n\nRasheed had championship belts made for the Pistons after they won the 2004 NBA title. Clearly, he was rather fond of his homemade accessory because he took it everywhere the following year, including Flyers games and the 2005 Eastern Conference finals against the Heat, whom Detroit beat before losing to the Spurs in the Finals."
