        "text": "Employment income - In general, all compensation provided by an employer is considered employment income and is included in the employee’s overall taxable income. However, if properly documented, certain reimbursements for necessary business-related expenses are not subject to tax.\n\nBoth residents and non-residents who remain in Switzerland for employment purposes are subject to tax on employment income. In general, residents are not subject to withholding tax on employment income. Residents with certain types of work permits, however, and most non-residents are subject to withholding tax on employment income.\n\nSelf-employment and business income - Self-employment and business income is included in overall taxable income. A partnership is not taxed as a separate entity; rather, the respective shares of partnership profit are included in the taxable income of each partner. All necessary expenses incurred in operating a business or profession are tax-deductible. Self-employed individuals may carry forward business losses if these losses cannot be offset against other taxable income. No carry backs are allowed for self-employed individuals.\n\nNon-residents may deduct necessary expenses incurred in operating a business or profession and in the maintenance and operation of rental property.\n\nDirectors’ fees - For residents, directors’ fees received from a Swiss company are included in the taxpayer’s overall taxable income. Directors’ fees remitted from a foreign country are generally included in a resident’s overall taxable income, unless an applicable double tax treaty provides otherwise.\n\nFor non-residents, directors’ fees received from a Swiss company are subject to withholding tax (at a rate of 25% in the Cantons of Geneva and Zurich) and social security contributions (unless the terms of an applicable totalisation agreement specify otherwise).\n\nInvestment income - A withholding tax of 35% is levied on dividends; on interest from publicly offered bonds, from debentures and from other instruments of indebtedness issued by Swiss residents; and on bank interest (in excess of CHF 200 per year), but not on normal loans. For Swiss residents, withholding tax is fully recoverable.\n\nFor non-residents, withholding tax is a final tax, unless the terms of an applicable double tax treaty specify otherwise.\n\nDividends received are taxed as ordinary income. However, if the recipient of a dividend owns at least 10% of the share capital of the payer company, only 70% of the dividend is taxable for the purpose of the federal income tax. Some cantons have adopted similar rules.\n\nRental income and royalties, as well as licensing, management and technical assistance fees, are not subject to withholding tax. With certain exceptions, they are included in taxable income and are taxed by the federal government, cantons and municipalities.\n\nTaxation of employer-provided stock options - Under federal law, equity-based compensation schemes are taxed at vesting (restricted stock units), at exercise (stock options that are not tradable or restricted) or at grant (tradable and unrestricted stock options, and free shares). The cantons also apply this rule.\n\nIn addition, the equity gain is allocated to Switzerland on the basis of the number of workdays performed in Switzerland during the vesting period.\n\nIncome derived from equity is taxed together with other income at ordinary tax rates. In addition, social taxes are levied on equity income.\n\nThe subsequent sale of the shares triggers no further tax consequences because private capital gains are exempt from tax in Switzerland.\n\nFederal income tax - Resident aliens and Swiss citizens who were resident or domiciled abroad for the past 10 years may qualify for a special tax concession called lump-sum taxation if they do not engage in any employment or carry on a business in Switzerland. Activities outside Switzerland are not taken into consideration. The lump-sum tax is imposed on income imputed from the living expenses of taxpayers and their families (for example, by a multiple of rental value). The amount of lump-sum tax may not be less than the tax that would be payable on the sum of:\n\nIncome from Swiss real property\n\nIncome from Swiss investments\n\nIncome from any other property located in Switzerland\n\nIncome from Swiss-source patents, copyrights and similar property rights\n\nPensions or annuities paid from Swiss sources\n\nForeign income, if treaty exemption is claimed\n\nCantonal income taxes - Several cantons allow a non-working resident to elect lump-sum taxation instead of regular income tax.\n\nIn certain cantons, lump-sum taxation is granted for only a limited number of years. In many cantons, eligibility for lump-sum taxation and the method of calculating the tax payable are negotiated individually with the tax authorities rather than statutorily determined."
