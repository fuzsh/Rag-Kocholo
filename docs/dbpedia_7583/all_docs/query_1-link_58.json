        "meta_description": "Abstract. The ice phase in mixed-phase clouds has a pivotal role in global precipitation formation as well as for Earth's radiative budget. Above 235âK, sparse particles with the special ability to initiate ice formation, ice-nucleating particles (INPs), are responsible for primary ice formation within these clouds. Mineral dust has been found to be one of the most abundant INPs in the atmosphere at temperatures colder than 258âK. However, the extent of the abundance and distribution of INPs remains largely unknown. To better constrain and quantify the impact of mineral dust on ice nucleation, we investigate the frequency of Saharan dust events (SDEs) and their contribution to the INP number concentration at 243âK and at a saturation ratio with respect to liquid water (Sw) of 1.04 at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch (JFJ; 3580âmâa.s.l.) from February to December 2020. Using the single-scattering albedo ÃngstrÃ¶m exponent retrieved from a nephelometer and an Aethalometer, satellite-retrieved dust mass concentrations, simulated tropospheric residence times, and the attenuated backscatter signal from a ceilometer as proxies, we detected 26 SDEs, which in total contributed to 17â% of the time span analyzed. We found every SDE to show an increase in median INP concentrations compared to those of all non-SDE periods; however, they were not always statistically significant. Median INP concentrations of individual SDEs spread between 1.7 and 161âINPâstdâLâ1 and thus 2Â orders of magnitude. In the entire period analyzed, 74.7âÂ±â0.2â% of all INPs were measured during SDEs. Based on satellite-retrieved dust mass concentrations, we argue that mineral dust is also present at JFJ outside of SDEs but at much lower concentrations, thus still contributing to the INP population. We estimate that 97â% of all INPs active in the immersion mode at 243âK and Sw=1.04 at JFJ are dust particles. Overall, we found INP number concentrations to follow a leptokurtic lognormal frequency distribution. We found the INP number concentrations during SDEs to correlate with the ceilometer backscatter signals from a ceilometer located 4.5âkm north of JFJ and 1510âm lower in altitude, thus scanning the air masses at the same altitude as JFJ. Using the European ceilometer network allows us to study the atmospheric pathway of mineral dust plumes over a large domain, which we demonstrate in two case studies. These studies showed that mineral dust plumes form ice crystals at cirrus altitudes, which then sediment to lower altitudes. Upon sublimation in dryer air layers, the residual particles are left potentially pre-activated. Future improvements to the sampling lines of INP counters are required to study whether these particles are indeed pre-activated, leading to larger INP number concentrations than reported here.",

        "text": "Sixty-threeâÂ±7â% of global precipitation is initiated via the ice phase (Heymsfield etÂ al.,Â 2020), predominately over land and in the midlatitudes (MÃ¼lmenstÃ¤dt etÂ al.,Â 2015). The co-existence of ice and metastable supercooled liquid water in a cloud is important for precipitation formation, as ice crystals grow efficiently at the expense of evaporating cloud droplets due to the lower equilibrium saturation vapor pressure over ice than over liquid water below 273âK (Wegener,Â 1911; Bergeron,Â 1935; Findeisen,Â 1938; Koop and Mahowald,Â 2013). Mixed-phase clouds, containing both the liquid and the ice phases, are topics of ongoing research to better constrain precipitation formation in climate and weather models. Clouds also have a special relevance to Earthâs climate. Not only do clouds cover 68â% of Earth's surface (Stubenrauch etÂ al.,Â 2013) but the phase of a cloud also strongly influences its radiative properties (e.g.,Â Sun and Shine,Â 1994; Lohmann and Feichter,Â 2005), emphasizing the need to adequately simulate cloud glaciation in climate models. Mixed-phase clouds theoretically can exist between 273 and â¼235âK. Depending on the measurement location, inÂ situ measurements revealed that only approximately half of the clouds contain the liquid phase when at 253 to 258âK, while the warmer clouds are mostly ice free (e.g.,Â Korolev etÂ al.,Â 2003; Verheggen etÂ al.,Â 2007; Kanitz etÂ al.,Â 2011). Below 235âK, cloud droplets freeze homogeneously. The stochastic process of solid cluster formation within the suspended liquid at atmospheric relevant sizes and timescales statistically favors the formation of stable ice clusters at these low temperatures. Between 273 and â¼235âK, heterogeneous nucleation on ice-nucleating particles (INPs) is responsible for the primary ice formation within clouds (Vali,Â 1985; Vali etÂ al.,Â 2015). However, the abundance, sources, and nature of INPs remain poorly understood (Murray etÂ al.,Â 2021).\n\nDifferent atmospheric particles can act as INPs, depending on the ambient temperature and water vapor saturation. Mineral dust particles are a major constituent of atmospheric aerosols, and dust plumes are transported over long distances between continents (Prospero,Â 1999). Transport of Saharan dust to Europe and the alpine region is a frequent phenomenon driven by the latitudinal movement of the prevailing large-scale circulation, including the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Furthermore, the North Atlantic Oscillation was found to modulate the mean occurrence of these weather patterns and, hence, Saharan dust transport to Europe (Moulin etÂ al.,Â 1997). Height-resolved global distribution lidar measurements showed that spring is the season with most dust plumes in the northern midlatitudes, with highest dust mass found in summer between 2000 and 3000âmâa.s.l. and in winter between 1000 and 2000âmâa.s.l. (Liu etÂ al.,Â 2008). Wegener (1911) had the hypothesis of minerals being an important INP species, which, subsequently, were studied in more detail in multiple field (e.g.,Â Sassen etÂ al.,Â 2003; Schrod etÂ al.,Â 2017,Â and references therein) and laboratory studies (e.g.,Â Mason and Maybank,Â 1958; Field etÂ al.,Â 2006; Welti etÂ al.,Â 2009; Boose etÂ al.,Â 2016c). In these studies, mineral dust showed the ability to be ice active in the deposition or immersion mode with concentrations exceeding 500 to 1000âINPâstdâLâ1 at 236.6 to 248âK (DeMott etÂ al.,Â 2003, 2009; Bi etÂ al.,Â 2019). Zhao etÂ al. (2021) studied the global contributions to INP concentrations at 248âK using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) and found dust over the terrestrial midlatitudes to be the dominating INP species by 1 to 2Â orders of magnitude higher INP number concentrations at 248âK compared to marine organic aerosols. In general, the contribution of different INP species is expected to vary depending on the implementation of the INP parameterization in the model and aerosol representations in the model. Mineral dust has been found to be the most abundant INP species in the atmosphere at temperatures colder than 258âK (Hoose and MÃ¶hler,Â 2012; Murray etÂ al.,Â 2012); however, the contribution of mineral dust to the total INP population remains unknown. Studies were conducted at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch (JFJ), a mountaintop station often located in the lower free troposphere, to assess, amongst others, the INP concentrations during Saharan dust events (SDEs). Chou etÂ al. (2011) showed that the INP number concentration can increase by 1 to 2Â orders of magnitude during an SDE, indicating that SDEs have different intensities. Conen etÂ al. (2015) studied the INP concentrations at JFJ over 1Â year with an offline technique and found a weak influence of Saharan dust events on the INP concentration at 265 K. Lacher etÂ al. (2018a) analyzed data from nine individual field campaigns from winter, spring, and summer in the years 2014â2017 and quantified the INP concentrations at 241â242âK and at a saturation ratio with respect to liquid water of Sw=1.04. Yet, these field campaigns with a duration of up to 6 weeks were targeted specifically for periods with SDEs, therefore potentially introducing a bias to the overall quantification. In addition, satellite-retrieved dust measurements demonstrate that the presence of atmospheric dust is not a binary phenomena, as the term SDE would imply, but in fact the dust concentrations show a strong temporal and spatial variation (e.g.,Â Voss and Evan,Â 2020).\n\nIn this work, we investigate and quantify the INP concentrations at 243âK and Sw=1.04 (immersion freezing). These conditions were chosen to align with previous INP measurements at JFJ between 2014 and 2017 (Boose etÂ al.,Â 2016a; Lacher etÂ al.,Â 2018a). Ice formation in stratiform mixed-phase clouds is frequently observed close to the cloud top where temperatures around 243âK are common lower-bound cloud-top temperatures of mixed-phase clouds in central Europe (e.g.,Â BÃ¼hl etÂ al.,Â 2016). In addition, 243âK is the warmest temperature where the instrumentâs signal-to-noise ratio allows for statistically acceptable data analysis when the sampling site is located in a remote region such as mountaintop stations or the Arctic without using an aerosol concentrator. There is an uncertainty in relative humidity and variation in the vertical position of the particles within the aerosol layer in the chamber (DeMott etÂ al.,Â 2015; Brunner and Kanji,Â 2021), amounting to Sw+0.007 and â0.009 and Â±1.11âK at 243âK as well as a set Sw of 1.04. To ensure that the entire sample layer experiences Sw>1.0, a nominal Sw=1.04 was chosen. All INP concentrations were measured at JFJ during all SDEs between 7Â February and 31Â DecemberÂ 2020. During this time, continuous high-resolution (20âmin) online INP measurements were performed for the first time at JFJ. Because the data are not tied to single field campaigns in active SDE seasons, it also includes measurements in seasons where SDEs are infrequent. This allows us to analyze whether all SDEs show an increased INP number concentration, as previous studies imply (Chou etÂ al.,Â 2011; Boose etÂ al.,Â 2016b; Lacher etÂ al.,Â 2018a). Furthermore, the classification of SDEs is based on four distinct tracers (see Sect.Â 2.2) and analyzed with regard to the type of air mass present at the site, i.e., free tropospheric air or boundary layer intrusions (see Sect.Â 2.4). Our data indicate that signals from light detection and ranging (lidar) ceilometers can be used to infer INP concentrations, as reported in other studies using depolarization channel lidars (Mamouri and Ansmann,Â 2015; Ansmann etÂ al.,Â 2019). In contrast to Mamouri and Ansmann (2015) and Ansmann etÂ al. (2019), the topographic setup of the present study allowed for the ceilometer to scan the same altitude that the INP concentrations were measured at. Estimating the INP concentrations from the ceilometer backscatter signals from all ceilometer stations across Europe allows us to track (and backtrack) the aerosol masses with enhanced INP concentrations and look into their atmospheric pathway, which we demonstrate in a case study. Finally, the contribution of (Saharan) dust to the INP concentration is estimated.\n\n2.1âSite description\n\nThe Sphinx Observatory at JFJ is located on a saddle between Mt. MÃ¶nch and Mt. Jungfrau in the Swiss Alps (46.330ââN, 7.590ââE) at an altitude of 3580âmâa.s.l. (see Fig.Â 1). Due to its altitude, the site experiences free tropospheric (FT) air masses, mainly in winter and during nighttime, as well as boundary layer intrusions (BLIs), predominantly in summer and during daytime (Collaud Coen etÂ al.,Â 2011; Herrmann etÂ al.,Â 2015). The local wind directions measured at the Jungfraujoch are strongly driven by the topography around the Jungfraujoch and are not representative for the larger-scale wind direction at this altitude level (see Fig.Â A1 in the Appendix and, for example, Ketterer etÂ al.,Â 2014). The principal local wind directions between February and December 2020 were 320â (NW) for 62â%, and 150ââ(SE) for 27â% of the time, while calm wind situations below 1âmâsâ1 had a frequency of 11â%. To the northwest, there is a steep drop of more than 1500âm, whereas to the southeast the elevation decreases steadily over the Aletsch glacier. JFJ has hosted long-term aerosol measurements for more than 30Â years and served as a platform for many previous studies to investigate physical, chemical, and optical aerosol properties as well as aerosolâcloud interactions and cloud characteristics (see, for example,Â Bukowiecki etÂ al.,Â 2016). There is no appreciable natural source of mineral dust in proximity of the site. Potential local sources of arable dust are isolated agricultural fields 15âkm north of JFJ.\n\n2.2âClassification of SDEs\n\nIn a first step, SDEs were identified using four distinct tracers: the ceilometers in close proximity of JFJ (at Kleine Scheidegg, KSE), the single-scattering albedo Ã ngstrÃ¶m exponent (Î±SSA) measured at JFJ, dust retrieved from satellite remote sensing generated using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (dustCAMS), and FLEXPART particle residence times over the Saharan region. The methodology of all tracers is introduced in the upcoming dedicated subsections. If all tracers show a signal, the event is classified as high-confidence Saharan dust event (hcSDE). If at least one of the tracers shows a signal but not all tracers agree, then the event is classified as a low-confidence Saharan dust event (lcSDE). The beginning and end of each SDE reflect the beginning and end of the onset of the earliest tracer or the decay of the latest tracer, respectively. If none of the tracers shows a signal, the event is classified as non-Saharan dust event (non-SDE). Only after the classification of SDEs are the INP measurements at JFJ analyzed.\n\n2.2.1âCeilometer\n\nThe Lufft CHMÂ 15kÂ Nimbus ceilometer is operated by MeteoSwiss at KSE (46.547ââN, 7.985ââE; 2070âmâa.s.l.), 4.5âkm north of JFJ and 1510âm lower in altitude (see Fig.Â 1). With a 5ââzenith angle, it also scans the air mass at the same altitude as JFJ, retrieving information about the vertical and temporal evolution of aerosol plumes at these altitudes with a temporal resolution of 5âmin. More detailed information about the ceilometer and the site can be found in Hervo etÂ al. (2016). The ceilometer data are qualitatively analyzed for aerosol plumes. If an aerosol plume was detected above the planetary boundary layer (PBL), the period for which the plume is observed between 3200â4000âmâa.s.l. is marked as an SDE. In the case when the signal was strongly attenuated by clouds or precipitation such that a potential signal from an aerosol plume was masked, i.e., the attenuated backscatter was >10âmâ1âsrâ1, the corresponding period is labeled as âcloud/precipitationâ, and no SDE signal was retrieved until the signal is restored. If an aerosol plume was visible before and after periods with clouds or precipitation with a total durationâ<12âh, the total period including the periods with clouds or precipitation was marked as an SDE. The data are accessed using the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA;Â Met Office,Â 2021).\n\n2.2.2âSingle-scattering albedo Ã ngstrÃ¶m exponent\n\nThe single-scattering albedo Ã ngstrÃ¶m exponent (Î±SSA) is an indicator of aerosol optical properties, which change during the presence of SDEs. CollaudÂ Coen etÂ al. (2004) observed that the exponent of the single-scattering albedo during SDEs decreases with wavelength, which counteracts the usual increasing trend. This was attributed to the different chemical composition of the mineral aerosol particles and their larger size. Î±SSA is retrieved from a nephelometer (Airphoton, IN101) and an Aethalometer (Magee Scientific, AE33) according to CollaudÂ Coen etÂ al. (2004). Both instruments are run at the Sphinx Observatory on JFJ. An SDE is detected if the Î±SSA is negative for more than 6 consecutive hours. This is longer than the previously used 4âh in CollaudÂ Coen etÂ al. (2004) in order to decrease the number of false or suspicious signals due to construction work at JFJ (see below).\n\n2.2.3âDust from CAMS\n\nThe daily Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) air quality forecast retrieves, amongst others, an hourly-updated dust product with a horizontal resolution of 0.1â and covers the European domain (25.0ââW to 45.0ââE, 30.0 to 72.0ââN). It is based on an ensemble of nine state-of-the-art numerical air quality models developed in Europe: CHIMERE, EMEP, EURAD-IM, LOTOS-EUROS, MATCH, MOCAGE, SILAM, DEHM, and GEM-AQ (Giusti,Â 2021). Gueymard and Yang (2020) performed a worldwide validation of the aerosol optical depth and Ã ngstrÃ¶m exponent from CAMS and MERRA-2 with ground-based AERONET stations over the period 2003â2017. They found the root-mean-square error to vary in the range 0.031â0.268 for the aerosol optical depth in CAMS and 0.382 for the Ã ngstrÃ¶m exponent. O'Sullivan etÂ al. (2020) compared CAMS to inÂ situ and remote sensing measurements and found dust aerosol optical depth predictions to be generally in good agreement but observed a low bias. The vertical location was at a lower altitude in CAMS than in observations, and CAMS underpredicted the coarse-mode dust while overpredicting fine-mode dust.\n\nIn this work the CAMS data are generated using Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service information (2020). It is important to note that neither the European Commission nor ECMWF is responsible for any use that may be made of the Copernicus information or data it contains. For the classification of SDEs, we used the dust reanalysis data from CAMS (dustCAMS) at 1000âm above the surface in hourly resolution and units of Âµgâmâ3, accessed via the Copernicus Atmosphere Data Store. The altitude 1000âm above surface was chosen to be closest to the real altitude of JFJ and accounting for the smoothed surface elevations in the model domain due to the coarse grid spacing. The data were extracted for the closest grid point (46.55ââN, 7.95ââE) to the coordinates of JFJ.\n\nThe dustCAMS concentrations show dust to be always present at JFJ, thus requiring a threshold above which dustCAMS shows a positive SDE signal. This threshold can be set arbitrarily, resulting in fewer or more SDEs. Conventionally, dust events at JFJ were defined by the Î±SSA signal (e.g.,Â CollaudÂ Coen etÂ al.,Â 2004; Lacher etÂ al.,Â 2018b). We choose the following procedure to tune the threshold to best agree with the onset and decay of the Î±SSA signal. According to Ott (1990), when pollutants are measured at a point away from their sources within the troposphere, the observed frequency distribution of a given pollutant concentration is lognormally distributed because of the successive random dilution by large- and small-scale dynamics. This also applies to the dustCAMS concentrations at JFJ, as illustrated in Fig.Â 2. A Gaussian fit to the logarithm of the dustCAMS concentrations allows us to calculate standard thresholds used in statistics, like the third quartile plus 1.5 times the inter quartile range (Q3â+â1.5âIQR), a metric regularly used for whiskers in box plots. We found that the mean plus 1.5 times standard deviation (Î¼+1.5Ï) agrees best with historic SDE signals in Î±SSA and can be used as a general threshold for dustCAMS concentrations above which an SDE is indicated. In this study, the threshold for an SDE signal translates to dustCAMSâ¥Î¼+1.5Ï=2.36 âÂµgâmâ3.\n\n2.2.4âFLEXPART\n\nThe Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM) FLEXPART (FLEXPART, Version 9.1_EMPA;Â Stohl etÂ al.,Â 2005) is used to estimate the surface residence times over the Sahara of air parcels arriving at JFJ. The Sahara is here defined as composing the countries Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan, and Tunisia. FLEXPART was driven by operational HRES (High-Resolution Forecast) analysis/forecast fields obtained from the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) with a 3âh temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 0.2ââÃâ0.2â over the Alpine domain and 1ââÃâ1â elsewhere. Simulations were done in receptor-oriented backward mode for an inert air tracer, releasing 50â000 particles every 3âh at the location of Jungfraujoch (3100âmâa.s.l. to account for smoothed topography) and tracing these back for 10âd in the atmosphere. Surface residence times (given in units time divided by local air density) were evaluated along the backward simulation and cumulated for the areas mentioned above. We note that due to the use of an inert tracer and the lack of a dust activation indicator in the potential Saharan source regions, the FLEXPART residence time indicator can only give a qualitative indication of dust transport to JFJ. A signal for an SDE is present if the density-weighted particle residence time exceeds background noise levels (here 100âsâm3âkgâ1).\n\n2.3âINP measurements\n\nThe INP concentrations were measured with an autonomous continuous-flow diffusion chamber, the automated Horizontal Ice Nucleation Chamber (HINC-Auto;Â Brunner and Kanji,Â 2021), at T=243.15âK and Sw=1.04 at the Sphinx Observatory on JFJ. All INP concentrations are in units ofâINPâstdâLâ1 (per standard liter, normalized to T=273.15âK and an atmospheric pressure of p=1013.25âhPa). Ambient air is sampled using a heated total aerosol inlet (293.15âK;Â Weingartner etÂ al.,Â 1999), which also feeds other aerosol measurements (a condensation particle counter (CPC), a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), an optical aerosol spectrometer (OAS, FIDAS 200, Palas GmbH, Germany), two nephelometers, two filter-based absorption photometers, and a particle mass monitor). Due to the low-volume flow of HINC-Auto and the sampling line geometry, particle survival measurements using an optical particle counter (MetOne GT-526S) and an OAS showed limitations when sampling particles d>2.5âÂµm (see Appendix A1 for detailed information), despite the fact that no impactor was used upstream of HINC-Auto. According to particle size distribution measurements from the OAS, particles with d>2.5âÂµm contributed during the investigated SDE periods on average to 35â% to the overall particle surface area (see Fig.Â A2 for an example of particle size distributions during an SDE). This is a noteworthy limitation, as studies have reported a majority of INPs at T>248âK to be supermicron particles (e.g.,Â Mason etÂ al.,Â 2016; Creamean etÂ al.,Â 2018; Gong etÂ al.,Â 2020); for a constant ice-active fraction, INP concentrations scale with total particle surface area for a given temperature (e.g.,Â Connolly etÂ al.,Â 2009; Niemand etÂ al.,Â 2012). However, instrument comparisons typically report substantially larger discrepancies between individual instruments than 35â% (e.g., seeÂ Hiranuma etÂ al.,Â 2015; DeMott etÂ al.,Â 2018).\n\nINPs are detected if particles with an optical diameter of â¥4.0âÂµm are counted at the chamber exit. Only particles with a diameterâ<â2.5âÂµm are sampled by the chamber, and the maximum expected size of a droplet that activated on a 2.5âÂµm particle is well below 4âÂµm. Therefore, the method is robust as only ice crystals grow past the set size threshold of 4âÂµm in the set conditions. The frequency of the INP measurements is every 20âmin (15âmin sampling plus 5âmin background), corresponding to N=19â561 measurements between 7Â February and 31Â DecemberÂ 2020. See Brunner and Kanji (2021) for more information on the sampling and derivation of the INP concentrations. During the investigated time period, construction work was undergoing in the tunnels of JFJ, as described in Bukowiecki etÂ al. (2021). In case of local pollution, high-frequency fluctuations in particle concentrations were observed (e.g., in the CPC measurements). To filter periods of local pollution, the following two methods were applied. Firstly, the smallest optical particle counter (OPC) size bin of HINC-Auto (0.3âÂµm) was analyzed with regard to fluctuations. A typical INP measurement includes 180 OPC sequences of 5âs each. For each 5âs sequence, the cumulative number of particles with a optical size of â¥0.3âÂµm is counted. If the count of a 5âs sequence is 30â% higher than the average count of all 180 sequences, the corresponding INP measurement is flagged. Secondly, fluctuations in the CPC measurements at JFJ were analyzed. If the 1âmin average concentration changed by more than 40âparticlesâcmâ3 from the previous 1âmin average, the current and the subsequent 5âmin of measurements were flagged. These thresholds were chosen based on a qualitative assessment of the fluctuations in the OPC and CPC measurements. All INP measurements containing flagged CPC periods were flagged as well. Applying both methods is estimated to conservatively flag potentially polluted INP measurements and leads to Nunflagged=14â216 (72â%) measurements unaffected by local pollution.\n\nFalse-positive counts can arise in HINC-Auto. Frost grows on the chamber walls, breaks off, and is detected at the outlet as ice. This happens irrespective of whether ambient or particle-free air is sampled with HINC-Auto. Thus, to correct the measured INP concentrations, the number of frost particles is measured separately and subtracted from the uncorrected INP measurements. This is done by sampling particle-free air for a period of 5âmin before and after an ambient air measurement. During these periods, the number of false-positive frost particles is counted and time-proportional subtracted from the ambient air measurement in between. The recorded false-positive counts per unit time follow a Poisson distribution. Therefore, in a fraction of cases more or fewer false-positive counts per unit time are recorded during the particle-free measurements than during the ambient air measurement. This results in fluctuations of the measured INP concentrations even if the true atmospheric INP number concentration were to remain constant. The standard deviation of the resulting probability density function corresponds to the stated counting uncertainty of Â±â1Ï, which is provided with INP concentrations stated in the present work. This counting uncertainty is also considered to be the 1Ï limit of detection (1ÏÂ LOD) for a single data point. However, in the present work all background-corrected INP concentrations are retained, including positive values below the 1ÏÂ LOD and negative values. This approach ensures that the random noise in background-corrected INP values caused by subtracting the mean frost particle counts does not introduce a systematic bias in mean or median values, which would occur if data below the 1ÏÂ LOD were discarded.\n\n2.4âClassification of air mass\n\nThe decay of radon-222 (222Rn) is measured at JFJ according to Griffiths etÂ al. (2014). 222Rn is a tracer of BLI at high-altitude sites, as there are no substantial sources of 222Rn in the FT. 222Rn is formed by the decay of naturally occurring radioisotopes in minerals. If the surrounding rock at a mountain site is covered by snow and ice, as is mostly the case at JFJ, the formed 222Rn is inhibited from mixing into the ambient air, leading to low 222Rn concentrations when the site is experiencing FT air masses. On the other hand, 222Rn is released relatively homogeneously in time and space from soils and gets well-mixed within the PBL, leading to higher 222Rn concentrations at JFJ during periods of BLI from air with contact to bare soil. Further information can be found in Griffiths etÂ al. (2014).\n\nWhen looking at remote sensing data of the PBL over alpine terrain (e.g.,Â Nyeki etÂ al.,Â 2000), the air masses present at the site are not binary (either FT or BLI), but the PBL can gradually get mixed with FT air (Henne etÂ al.,Â 2004). Consequently, setting a binary threshold does not resemble an atmospheric process or represent the recorded data. Therefore, we use an approach where each 222Rn concentration corresponds to a probability of the sampled air to be of free tropospheric origin (as explained below). For this, the 222Rn concentrations at JFJ were analyzed between 1Â JanuaryÂ 2009 and 31Â DecemberÂ 2020, as shown in Fig.Â 3. Founded on the theory where the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere follows a lognormal distribution (Ott,Â 1990), two normal distributions were fitted so that the sum of them closely reproduces the observed bimodal distribution of the logarithm of the 222Rn concentrations. One distribution corresponds to 222Rn concentrations found in the FT (fit parameter: Î¼FT=-0.139 âBq/stdâm3, ÏFT=0.239âBq/stdâm3) and the other distribution to the concentrations measured during BLI (fit parameter: Î¼BLI=0.403âBq/stdâm3, ÏBLI=0.238âBq/stdâm3).\n\nBesides 222Rn, the total number concentration of particles with diameters larger than dâ¥90ânm (N90) is another tracer for BLI (Herrmann etÂ al.,Â 2015). The threshold above which the air mass is likely boundary layer intruded is N90â¥â100â150âcmâ3, depending on the season (Herrmann etÂ al.,Â 2015). Ceilometer measurements can also be used to infer the top of the continuous aerosol layer, which indicates the top of the planetary boundary layer (Poltera etÂ al.,Â 2017) and, subsequently, whether JFJ is within the PBL. However, this method has not been used in the present study. A further tracer of BLI is the ratio of total reactive nitrogen (NOy) to carbon monoxide (CO) according to Zanis etÂ al. (2007). Both NOy and CO are emitted from anthropogenic sources; however, NOy reacts and decays on the order of days, while CO can be considered inert within the same time period. Consequently, the ratio of NOy to CO decreases with increasing aging time, leading to smaller ratios found in the FT compared to BLI (Zanis etÂ al.,Â 2007). CO is continuously measured with a cavity ring-down spectrometer at JFJ (Zellweger etÂ al.,Â 2019). NOy was measured until March 2020 with a chemiluminescence detector after conversion to NO on a heated gold catalyst (573âK) in the presence of CO as a reducing agent (Pandey Deolal etÂ al.,Â 2012). An analysis of 222Rn, N90, and NOyâ/ âCO data collected at JFJ between 1Â January 2017 and 31Â December 2018 showed for N90â¥100âcmâ3 to be indicative of BLI, but concentrations of N90<â100âcmâ3 to not always be indicative for FT air masses, as indicated by 222Rn and the NOyâ/ âCO ratio (see Fig.Â A3 in the Appendix). Therefore, in the present study a sigmoid function forces periods with concentrations of N90 above a smooth threshold (to cover the seasonal variations of the threshold) to have a low probability to be sampled within the FT, even if the 222Rn criterion indicates FT, but allows for periods with concentrations below the smooth threshold to be either FT or BLI depending on the 222Rn concentration. The threshold midpoint (N90,âTH) and smoothing, using the slope factor k (here N90,TH=120 âcmâ3 and k=0.1), have been chosen to best agree with season-specific thresholds found in the literature (Herrmann etÂ al.,Â 2015). The probability of the sampled air to be of free tropospheric origin (PFT) is according to Eq.Â (1):\n\n(1) P FT = PDF FT ( 222 Rn ) PDF FT ( 222 Rn ) + PDF BLI ( 222 Rn ) 1 1 + e k ( N 90 - N 90 , TH ) ,\n\nwhere PDF is the probability density function with the FT or BLI fit parameters, respectively, according to\n\n(2) PDF FT ( 222 Rn ) = 1 Ï FT 2 Ï e - 1 2 log 10 222 Rn - Î¼ FT Ï FT 2 .\n\nIn the present study, NOyâ/ âCO was not used because NOy measurements were discontinued at JFJ in March 2020.\n\nFigureÂ 4 shows an example of an SDE with all introduced tracers, the air mass type, and the INP concentration. In Fig.Â 4b, the attenuated backscatter of the ceilometer at KSE showed an increase from background levels to â¼1âmâ1âsrâ1 at altitudes similar to JFJ after midnight on 10Â July, indicating the presence of an aerosol plume. At 11:00âUTC, the signal of the aerosol plume was attenuated by the low-level clouds during the remaining period of the plume event. Î±SSA decreased to below zero with decreasing wavelength after 02:00âUTC on 10Â July (Fig.Â 4c). The signal becomes less separated with Î±SSA above zero at 15:00âUTC and noisy after midnight of 11Â July, indicating the end of the SDE according to this tracer. dustCAMS mass concentrations exceeded the threshold concentrations on 9Â July at 23:00âUTC, as shown in Fig.Â 4d, peaking at 03:00âUTC of 10Â July with 19.6âÂµgâmâ3, followed by a decay, until falling below the threshold at 20:00âUTC. FLEXPART particle surface residence times in Fig.Â 4e indicate between 03:00âUTC on 10Â July and 05:00âUTC on 11Â July that the air mass is expected to have had ground contact over the Saharan domain. Following all four tracers showing a signal, the SDE was classified as hcSDE. The INP concentrations show an increase from background INP concentrations on 9Â July at 23:00âUTC (Fig.Â 4a) to concentrations above 200âINPâstdâLâ1, followed by lower concentrations coinciding with Î±SSA relaxing back to values above zero for 1âh. After a brief, second increase in INP concentrations, a decline to background levels at midnight of 7Â July followed. No tracer shows an identical onset and decline as observed in the INP concentrations; however, Î±SSA was the closest. The BLI air masses were present during the SDE, with 222Rn initially at FT levels at 04:00âUTC on 10Â July, followed by a rapid change to BLI levels. At the end of the SDE, N90 indicated FT conditions, while 222Rn still pointed to BLI, resulting in the air mass being classified as BLI.\n\n2.5âParticulate matter measurements\n\nThe mass concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters below 2.5âÂµm (PM2.5) and below 10âÂµm (PM10) are continuously recorded with a white light optical aerosol spectrometer (Fidas 200, Palas GmbH, Germany). The data are provided with a temporal resolution of 10âmin, with each data point reflecting the average particulate matter over the past 10âmin. The spectrometer measures the intensity of single particles at an angle between 85 and 95â and infers the particle diameter solving the inverse Mie problem. The sensitivity of the spectrometer is checked six times per year with calibration dust.\n\n2.6âCALIOP\n\nTo assess the atmospheric transport of dust and the presence and retrieved phase of nearby clouds in the case study (see Sect.Â 3.3), post-processed lidar data from the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instruments of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellites was used. CALIPSO is part of the NASA A-Train constellation (Stephens etÂ al.,Â 2002), which was launched in 2006 to a sun-synchronous polar orbit with 98.2â inclination at an altitude of 705âkm (Winker etÂ al.,Â 2009). The data were accessed via https://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/products/lidar/browse_images/exp_index.php?d=2020 (last access: 10 April 2021).\n\nIn the investigated time period between 7Â February and 31Â DecemberÂ 2020, 26âSDEs were detected (based on the classification described in Sect.Â 2.2), consisting of 14âhcSDEs and 12âlcSDEs (see TableÂ A1 in the Appendix for more details), with a total duration of 55âd 20âh, which corresponds to 17â% of the overall investigated time period. The median INP concentrations of the individual event medians was 15.3âÂ±â1.2âINPâstdâLâ1. Analogously, the medians of all single-event 25â% and 75â% quartile INP concentrations were 9.1âÂ±â1.1 and 32.4âÂ±â1.4âINPâstdâLâ1, respectively (event-based; see TablesÂ 1 and A1 for more detail), generally 1Â order of magnitude higher than the median INP concentration of 1.1âÂ±â1.0âINPâstdâLâ1 during periods without SDEs (non-SDE). All SDE quartiles except the 25â% quartile exceed the 95th percentile during non-SDE conditions. The median of all INP concentrations during all SDEs combined increases to 22.5âÂ±â1.4âINPâstdâLâ1, rendering the longer dust events generally to contain more ice-active particles. This median concentration is consistent with previously reported values at JFJ of 26.1âINPâstdâLâ1 (Lacher etÂ al.,Â 2018a). The 75th and 95th percentile concentrations during all SDE periods were 68.7âÂ±â1.5 and 308.1âÂ±â1.4âINPâstdâLâ1, respectively, which is 3Â times lower than what Lacher etÂ al. (2018a) observed at JFJ, and the highest concentrations measured were half as high as those measured in the Saharan air layer in Tenerife (1274 vs. 2500âINPâstdâLâ1 inÂ Boose etÂ al.,Â 2016b). Given the proximity of Tenerife to the Sahara compared to JFJ, the difference in peak INP concentrations is to be expected. None of the SDEs was, at least partially, without BLI. In former studies, SDEs were reported to be occurring in the FT only (Lacher etÂ al.,Â 2018a); however, our results indicate that FT conditions (PFTâ¥50â%) made up 14.5â% of the total SDEÂ time, compared to non-SDE periods, where FT conditions prevailed for 40.5â% of the time. A smaller FT fraction during SDE periods versus non-SDE periods is expected because of the seasonality of SDEs, with few events in winter, when also FT conditions prevail. The observed INP concentrations during SDEs were lower in FT conditions compared to periods with BLI with median concentrations of 17.3âÂ±â1.1 and 23.7âÂ±â1.5âINPâstdâLâ1, respectively; however, they did not significantly differ, as the median INP concentrations of one class does not exceed the interquartile range INP concentrations of the other class and vice versa. Noteworthy are the reported negative INP concentrations due to the low signal-to-noise ratio for the 25th percentile of the overall non-SDE periods. With an uncertainty of Â±â1.0âINPâstdâLâ1, the 25th percentile is within the instrument's noise and, therefore, can statistically not be distinguished from 0âINPâstdâLâ1 with the equipment used.\n\nSouthwesterly wind directions occurred relatively more frequently during SDEs than during non-SDE periods (see Fig.Â A1 for more details). However, if the wind direction during SDE periods is compared to non-SDE periods of identical duration a week prior to each SDE, they are comparable, postulating a seasonal feature rather than a connection to the dust events.\n\n3.1âInfluence of SDEs on INP concentrations\n\nFigureÂ 5 shows box plots of the measured INP concentrations for all of the 26âSDEs, classified either as hcSDE or as lcSDE, compared to the box plot of measured INP concentrations during all non-SDE periods. Every SDE shows elevated levels of INP concentrations compared to the non-SDE periods, rendering every SDE to carry a higher INP loading than what is present during non-SDE periods. However, the concentration of INPs varies across SDEs, as the SDE with the lowest INP concentration (medianâ=1.7âINPâstdâLâ1) is close to the median of background INP concentration and 2Â orders of magnitude smaller than the median of the SDE with the highest INP concentration (median = 161âINPâstdâLâ1). Three SDEs (12â% of all SDEs) showed median INP concentrations above 100âINPâstdâLâ1.\n\nThe 12âlcSDEs accounted for 33â% of the total SDE duration and showed a lower median INP concentration of 13.1âINPâstdâLâ1 compared to 28.5âINPâstdâLâ1 for the 14âhcSDEs. This reflects that lcSDEs have the tendency of showing lower INP concentrations than hcSDEs, yet the SDE with the lowest 95th percentile of 7.1âINPâstdâLâ1 was a hcSDE in May, while the SDE with the highest 95th percentile of 881.1âINPâstdâLâ1 was an lcSDE in June. Therefore, increased INP concentrations can be expected if at least one of the mentioned four tracers shows an SDE signal. Furthermore, all tracers showing a signal is not indicative for highest INP concentrations to be expected. As the Î±SSA is the tracer with least correspondence to the other SDE tracers, this is specially relevant for sites where the presence of dust events is inferred from the Î±SSA alone, as has been done in previous studies at JFJ (Chou etÂ al.,Â 2011; Boose etÂ al.,Â 2016a; Lacher etÂ al.,Â 2018a).\n\nFigureÂ 6a shows the histogram of observed INP concentrations. The observed concentrations during SDEs are responsible for all INP concentrations above 102âINPâstdâLâ1. If a lognormal curve is fitted to all INP concentrations (blue dashed line in Fig.Â 6a; fit parameter: Î¼=100.517âINPâstdâL-1=3.3 âINPâstdâLâ1 and Ï=100.516âINPâstdâL-1=3.3 âINPâstdâLâ1), both tails of the measurements (black line) are symmetric and above the fitted curve. Therefore, the frequency distribution of all INP concentrations shows a leptokurtic lognormal distribution, which is consistent with the theory by Ott (1990) and other studies (e.g.,Â Welti etÂ al.,Â 2018; Schrod etÂ al.,Â 2020). If the fitted curve is compared to the frequency distribution of all non-SDE INP concentrations (pink line), the non-SDE INP concentrations show a distinctly less symmetric lognormal distribution, as the high concentration tail above 10âINPâstdâLâ1 falls below the fitted curve, while the low concentration tail remains above the fitted curve. This could mean that the kind of INPs detected during SDE also contributes to the overall INP population during non-SDE periods, but chemical analysis would be necessary to categorically conclude this. After all, SDEs are operationally defined periods, where dust concentrations become so dominant that their signature can be more clearly measured, and the properties of dust particles outweigh competing effects from other aerosol species (e.g., absorption, back- and forward-scattering characteristics).\n\n3.2âThe contribution of dust to the INP concentration at 243âK\n\nHINC-Auto samples an approximately constant volume flow of ambient air, and counts the number of INPs after exposure to the set temperature and supersaturated saturation ratio within the chamber. The ratio of INPs detected during all SDEs to all INPs detected during the entire analyzed period is calculated to quantify the contribution of Saharan dust, including a 1Ï limit of detection (LOD) to express the uncertainty involved:\n\n(3) â INP during SDEs Â± LOD â total INP Â± LOD = 90938 Â± 90.4 INP 121691 Â± 265.1 INP = 74.7 Â± 0.2 % .\n\nThus, 74.7âÂ±â0.2â% of all INPs were detected during SDEs. Whether this is because of the ice nucleation activity of the mineral dust or because of biogenic material content, as proposed by other studies (e.g., seeÂ O'Sullivan etÂ al.,Â 2016; Augustin-Bauditz etÂ al.,Â 2016), is outside of the scope of this study. Biogenic material on the dust particles as the predominant cause of the ice nucleation activity of the particles would have two main implications. Firstly, the underlying mechanism leading to ice nucleation might differ, as proteins and other macromolecules could induce the ice nucleation as compared to topological mineral surface features, such as cracks and pores. Secondly, it would raise the question of the source of the dust particles containing ice-active biogenic material to be potentially from dried lake beds in desert regions or agricultural regions that are not differentiated in this work. In addition, a contribution of arable dust cannot be ruled out; however, during the 26âSDEs the modeled FLEXPART particle surface residence times indicated in 24 cases that the air mass had robust surface contact in the Sahara, and in the other two cases, they had weak surface contact. The median INP concentration during SDE periods with FT air masses is 17.3âINPâstdâLâ1, while with BLI it is 23.7âINPâstdâLâ1. If we assume arable dust to show a substantially larger signal within the well-mixed PBL than in the FT, we could attribute the difference between median INP concentrations in FT SDE periods and BLI SDE periods to be because of arable dust, which is 6.4âINPâstdâLâ1. There were three SDEs detected with lower concentrations than 6.4âINPâstdâLâ1: one with a signal in Î±SSA, one without, and one where the nephelometer was offline. If during SDE periods the median contribution of arable dust was 6.4âINPâstdâLâ1, then this should be also similar during non-SDE periods. However, the median INP concentration during non-SDE periods was only 1.1âINPâstdâLâ1. We do not see any indications of why during SDEs the contribution of arable dust should be substantially larger than during non-SDE periods. If at all, we expect arable dust would contribute to BLI INP concentrations during non-SDE periods. It is fair to assume for background INPs present during non-SDE to be also present during SDE. Assuming a constant concentration over time, background INPs would contribute as little as 0.5â% to the INP population during SDEs.\n\nSince SDEs consist only of the high concentration tail of the lognormal distribution of dust in the atmosphere after successive random dilution by large- and small-scale dynamics, also visible in the dustCAMS frequency distribution in Fig.Â 6b, it is likely that ice-active dust is also present outside of SDE periods but in smaller concentrations. For the following assessment, we assume that a constant massÂ fraction of all dust carried to JFJ will act as INPs. This is a bold simplification; for example, Boose etÂ al. (2016b) found INP concentrations to vary within a factor of 7 for the same dust mass concentration; however, it provides a rough estimate of the contribution of dust to the INP concentration at T=243âK and Sw=1.04 at JFJ. The variable dustCAMS will be used as a proxy for the ambient dust mass concentration. The ratio of dustCAMS advected to JFJ during all SDEs to all advected dust to JFJ during the entire analyzed period is\n\n(4) â dust CAMS Â during SDEs â total dust CAMS = 9538 Âµ g 12466 Âµ g = 76.5 % .\n\nA literature search did not yield information about the uncertainty of dustCAMS. If 76.5â% of the dust is responsible for 74.2âÂ±â0.2â% of the INPs (74.7âÂ±â0.2â%â0.5â%) and 23.5â% of all dustCAMS was advected to JFJ during non-SDE periods, we estimate that about 23â% of the INPs measured during non-SDE periods were dust-related with our assumption that a constant mass fraction of dust acts as INPs. Therefore, the total contribution of dust to the INP population measured at JFJ at T=243âK and saturation ratio of Sw=1.04 is estimated to be 74â%â+â23â%âââ97â%. Note, during non-SDE periods, dust contributed 23/25.3 â%âââ91â% to the overall INP population. To validate the stated contribution in future studies or investigate the presence of biogenic material causing the ice activity, we propose to separate INPs from the bulk aerosol population to analyze the chemical composition of the INPs as well as to study the surface using scanning electron microscopy. However, to our knowledge, such equipment to separate INPs has not been used in a continuous annual study. Detailed suggestions of how this can be achieved in a long-term automated study by modifying HINC-Auto is presented elsewhere (Brunner,Â 2021) and is beyond the scope of the current article.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that there is substantial uncertainty involved in the stated fraction, as the assumption of a constant ice-active mass fraction in all dust particles changes with dust type (e.g.,Â Hoose and MÃ¶hler,Â 2012,Â and references therein). Also, the uncertainty of dustCAMS at low concentrations is expected to be significant but remains unquantified. Furthermore, the statement is only applicable for the stated location, temperature of T=243âK and saturation ratio of Sw=1.04. At warmer temperatures mineral dust shows a lower ice activity (e.g.,Â Eastwood etÂ al.,Â 2008,Â and references therein) and subsequently plays a lesser role at JFJ such that other species become the dominant population. This is consistent with observations by Conen etÂ al. (2015), where INPs active at 265âK showed a correlation with ambient temperature and during SDEs were on the same order of magnitude as during non-SDE periods. This is expected, as at 265âK the dominant type of INP is different than at 243âK (e.g., biological vs. mineral dust). Also, at measurement locations further away from the dust source than JFJ is or locations closer to local sources in the PBL, the contribution of dust on the total INP population can be expected to be much smaller.\n\nThis raises the question of whether the INP concentrations at JFJ can be inferred meaningfully from dustCAMS. FigureÂ 7 shows the dustCAMS mass concentration at the time of every INP measurement with the corresponding INP concentrations and PM10 concentrations. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of Ï=0.509 indicates that there is a correlation between the dustCAMS and INP concentrations; however, the R2=0.276 indicates there is only a weak linear correlation. This does not come as a surprise, as the INP concentration is a particle number concentration per volume of air that tends to scale with particle surface area (âr2) for an identical INP type or air mass dominated by a certain INP species or with the number concentration of viable dust particles, while dustCAMS provides a mass concentration (âr3). Given that the distribution of the dust particles during the SDEs is not lognormal (see Fig.Â 6b) suggests that the size of dust particles varies; thus, the number concentrations will not scale with dust mass. Therefore, dustCAMS is also compared to PM10, which both are in units of mass per volume of air. Interestingly, with Ï=0.543 and R2=0.273 the pattern does not change much, indicating the level of uncertainty within dustCAMS. A comparison of the observed PM10 with the PM10 from CAMS showed a similar agreement with Ï = 0.491 and R2=0.265 and better agreement with Ï = 0.591 and R2=0.336 if only concentrations above 1âÂµgâmâ3 are considered. As the relative measurement uncertainty in lower INP concentrations and presumably also in low dustCAMS concentrations increases, a higher degree of correlation would be expected at high concentrations, which is, however, not the case. This analysis strengthens the caveats of our earlier conclusion regarding the dust contribution to INP concentrations at JFJ.\n\n3.3âBacktracking SDEs with the European ceilometer network\n\nFigureÂ 8a shows the INP concentrations measured during a classified SDE in spring, peaking at 419âINPâstdâLâ1. FigureÂ 8b shows the ceilometer attenuated backscatter signal at KSE, with the increased attenuated backscatter due to the dust particles up to 5000âmâa.s.l., and in Fig.Â 8c the attenuated backscatter evaluated at similar altitudes as JFJ, with filtered ceilometer measurements when a cloud was below or at the same altitude as JFJ. Similar altitudes at KSE rather than the exact altitude of JFJ were chosen as, depending on the wind direction, orographic lifting or subsidence is to be expected between KSE and JFJ. Furthermore, eddies forming on the leeward side of the mountain ridge can induce mixing of air masses from higher or lower altitude to JFJ, depending on wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric stability. The similar trends in observed INP concentrations and attenuated backscatter are not just a feature of the SDE on 16â17Â April but across all investigated data where the ceilometer signal is not attenuated by clouds or precipitation. Another example is provided in Fig.Â A4, where it becomes apparent that the observed INP concentration does not always best agree with the backscatter signal retrieved at the altitude of JFJ but sometimes rather with the signal retrieved at a lower or higher altitude. This also changes over time as the wind situation changes throughout the day (e.g., seeÂ Ketterer etÂ al.,Â 2014).\n\nFigureÂ 9 shows the observed relation between the INP concentration and the attenuated backscatter of three classified dust events. With Spearman's rank correlation coefficients ranging between 0.517â¤Ïâ¤0.815 , there is a correlation between the two quantities. As both INP concentration and the backscatter coefficient scale to a first approximation with the cumulative surface of the ambient particles, a linear fit can be applied. If a linear fit is applied to the logarithm of both quantities, including all altitude levels, the slopes of the fitted curves are very similar, but the offsets differ, resulting in a factor of up to 4.5 different INP concentrations for the same attenuated backscatter. Considering the limiting factors, like the 4.4âkm distance between the measuring sites; the lifting and subsidence depending on the synoptic situation, modified by the orography; and the analysis of the attenuated backscatter signal rather than the corrected backscatter signal, we consider the agreement such that it allows us to use the signals of the ceilometer network to study the spatiotemporal evolution of INP concentrations and investigate their atmospheric pathways. For this purpose, a fit was computed for all data (SDEâ+ânon-SDE) where the ceilometer signal is not attenuated by clouds or precipitation (Ï=0.63):\n\n(5) INP 243 K Â conc. = 10 2.062 log 10 ( ABSc ) + 2.81 ,\n\nwhere INP243âK conc. is the INP concentration at T=243âK and Sw=1.04âinâINPâstdâLâ1, and ABSc is the attenuated backscatter (in mâ1âsrâ1). We propose the fit in future work to be validated at other locations where ceilometer data are available. As previously shown, the INP concentrations at JFJ are dominated by mineral dust particles, which renders the obtained fit likely to only be valid for when mineral dust is the dominant species amongst the INP population.\n\nThe ceilometer at KSE often showed upstream virga prior to dust plumes arriving at JFJ. These virga are starting at an altitude above 5000âmâa.s.l. and appear to be connected to dust plumes (see Fig.Â 8b). To illustrate this, two dust events were analyzed in more detail. FigureÂ 10a shows a map of the dust concentration from CAMS on 9Â February 2020, 06:00âUTC, with the location of three ceilometer stations: Freiburg (FRE) in southern Germany, KSE, and Saint-Auban (StA) in the south of France. An anticyclone with a surface pressure of 1030âhPa at sea level centered over Serbia extended to the Alps, while a weak cold front with core above Iceland passed Germany. FigureÂ 10b correspondingly shows the CAMS dust concentration on 16Â AprilÂ 2020, 06:00âUTC, with the ceilometer stations Deuselbach (DEU) in the western part of Germany and KSE, where an anticyclone with a center over Croatia extended to central France and Germany with a surface pressure of 1020âhPa at sea level.\n\nFigureÂ 11 shows the ceilometers StA, KSE, and FRE between 7â10Â February. On 8Â February, at 23:29âUTC, INP concentrations exceeded background concentrations, indicating the onset of an SDE, and it peaked on 9Â February at 02:59âUTC with 42âINPâstdâLâ1. The corresponding signal can be seen in the attenuated backscatter at KSE during the same period, initially at an altitude between 3500 and 4600âmâa.s.l. and descending over time. A faint signature of the plume is visible before 8Â February, 23:30âUTC, at the altitude range between 4500 and 5500âmâa.s.l. and going back until 8Â February, 13:00âUTC, where it connects to signatures from sedimenting hydrometeors with equal upper and lower limits. These hydrometeors in turn appear to have sedimented from 11â400âmâa.s.l., forming a virga. Analogous behaviors in the signals of the plume with each corresponding virga are also visible in the ceilometers StA and FRE (see Fig.Â 11); however, the signature of the plume is more distinct. Radio soundings at Payerne, 84âkm northwest of KSE, observed on 8Â February, at 00:00âUTC at 11â400âmâa.s.l., with a temperature of 217âK and saturation ratio with respect to liquid water and ice of Sw=0.39 and Si=0.68, respectively, were well below the saturation ratio needed for the homogeneous nucleation of solution droplets of â¼Si=1.52 at 217âK (Koop etÂ al.,Â 2000). The tropopause was above 11â650âmâa.s.l. according to radio soundings. Ice saturation was detected between 8850 and 8880âmâa.s.l. and between 10â200 and 11â200âmâa.s.l. Below 7790âmâa.s.l., the saturation dropped from Siâ¥0.8 to Siâ¤0.15. This raises the hypothesis of whether the ice-active particles nucleated the ice clouds at altitudes above 7790âmâa.s.l., with subsequent sedimentation of the ice crystals to below 7790âmâa.s.l., where they sublimated leaving behind dry INPs. These INPs further sedimented, however, due to the lower mass, at a much smaller rate. Thus, signals of the plume appear, in the ceilometer, more elongated after sublimation (e.g., in FRE at 13:00âUTC on 8Â February) compared to prior in the virga. What opposes this hypothesis is the fact, that no Saharan dust plume can be observed in the ceilometer measurements at altitudes above 7790âmâa.s.l.\n\nFigureÂ 12 shows another example of the observed pattern, with the ceilometers KSE and DEU. The simultaneous ceilometer and INP measurements at KSE and at JFJ, respectively, which are shown in Fig.Â 12a, indicate that the Saharan dust plume on 16â17Â April contains INP number concentrations above 100âINPâstdâLâ1; however, no connection between the Saharan dust plume and a virga is apparent. The Saharan dust plume can be tracked north to other ceilometer locations, such as DEU, following the outline of the dust plume in Fig.Â 10b. At DEU, shown in Fig.Â 12b, the lower end of the virga and the onset of the dust plume are colocated as before in the case study from 8Â February. However, also in this case no signal of the Saharan dust plume is apparent above 5500âmâa.s.l. The sounding at Idar-Oberstein from the Deutscher Wetterdienst (15âkm east of DEU) reported a tropopause at 10â200âmâa.s.l. and ice supersaturation between 8370 and 10â370âmâa.s.l. Below 8370âmâa.s.l., there was a steady decrease from ice saturation to Si=0.17 at 5100âmâa.s.l. A three-dimensional kinematic backward trajectories analysis was carried out using LAGRANTO (Wernli and Davies,Â 1997), with wind fields from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) HRES model with a horizontal resolution of 0.1ââÃâ0.1â. The analysis showed trajectories to originate from the Sahara within Algeria, where they were close to the surface (â¤300âm above ground) on 14Â April, followed by an ascent to 300âhPa (â¼9000âmâa.s.l.) above KSE. Observations from the CALIOP lidar aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite show large amounts of dust over Algeria up to 6000âmâa.s.l. on 14Â April. On 15Â April, CALIPSO did not pass over the area west of Sardinia, where the backward trajectories would predict the location of the air mass containing the Saharan dust. On 16Â April at 12:30âUTC, CALIOP retrieved an aerosol signature between 11â000 and 13â000âmâa.s.l. over central Italy (43.3ââN, 12.7ââE), surrounded by cirrus clouds, but it could not identify the type of aerosol. Assessing all presented data, the hypothesized pathway of mineral dust being lifted to cirrus altitudes â where it nucleates ice to form cirrus clouds and sediments within the ice crystals to lower altitudes, where after iceÂ sublimation the dust is left as residuals â is plausible yet remains to be proven at this point. We plan on addressing the hypothesis in future work. Such a transport pathway poses some relevant implications for atmospheric processes. First, the simulated backward trajectory analysis will not well reproduce the history and thus the origin of the particles, as models backtrack air parcels and not particles, which are subject to varying settling velocities when ice is nucleating and growing on them. And secondly, after sublimation of the surrounding ice, the residual mineral dust particles can be pre-activated, e.g., by retaining pore ice due to the inverse Kelvin effect (Marcolli,Â 2014). If the pre-activated particles are again exposed to ice supersaturated conditions, spontaneous ice crystal growth can occur at much lower Si than with other INPs (David etÂ al.,Â 2019). To capture and study this effect, design adaptations need to be implemented in our sampling equipment in upcoming studies, as the pore ice sublimates or melts in the heated and dried sampling lines upstream of the INP counter used here. We attempted such a measurement of the number concentration of pre-activated particles in this way, using a supercooled diffusion dryer at JFJ before directly sampling the ambient particles with HINC-Auto, in addition to sampling with a reference chamber with the standard heated inlet. Nevertheless, we were unable to reach any reliable conclusions. In part, due to the clogging of the inlet from frost build-up, the conditions along the trajectory of the potentially pre-activated particles had to be precisely adjusted, such that neither particle sedimentation due to activation nor pore ice sublimation occurs. Furthermore, the set conditions do not affect all pore sizes similarly, and poreÂ ice can melt if the pore ice shrinks below the critical size of an ice embryo within the pore with a constrained width. In summary, there were too many parameters that needed to be simultaneously and meticulously controlled.\n\nAnsmann, A., Mamouri, R.-E., BÃ¼hl, J., Seifert, P., Engelmann, R., Hofer, J., Nisantzi, A., Atkinson, J.
