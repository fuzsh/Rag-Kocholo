        "text": "EU/EFTA nationals (i.e. EU citizens as well as citizens of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, due to BREXIT this applies to UK nationals only until 31.12.2020) benefit from the Agreement on the Free Movement of People, and therefore have a legal right to obtain a work permit based on a signed Swiss employment contract. They receive their work permit upon registration at their local community office of their domicile in Switzerland.\n\nEU/EFTA nationals on assignment to Switzerland (no Swiss employment contract) for more than 90 days per calendar year are not covered by the Agreement on the Free Movement of People. A work permit application has to be approved in advance.\n\nThe Swiss salary levels have to be respected and additionally all assignment related costs for accommodation, food and travel have to be covered by the employer. The applicable Swiss salary level has to be individually calculated depending on several parameters such as education, age, professional experience or responsibilities. The processing time with the authorities amounts to around 3-6 weeks.\n\nSwitzerland is a country with an efficient and established banking system. Current account services are available through the major banks, the Post Office Bank, Cantonal Banks, and private banks. For more information about setting up a Swiss bank account, refer to the websites of any of the major banks in Switzerland, including:\n\nCredit Suisse\n\nUBS\n\nPost Finance\n\nAll invoices in Switzerland are required to be issues on a standard payment form (einzahlung/versement/versamento), regardless of who issues the invoice. Payment can then be made in cash at the post office (assuming you bring the payment slip), at your bank, at your bank’s automated bank machine, or via your bank’s online banking system.\n\nIt is possible to arrange for housing individually through resources available to the public. There are still listings in the local or regional newspapers, but more often information is nowadays available on the internet. By subscribing to various dedicated websites, vacancies can be found, but information may be limited as properties are not always advertised on the internet due to the short vacant period between renters. Acting quickly is highly recommendable as properties are usually rented in a short amount of time.\n\nAlternatively, the services of a real estate or relocation agent can be used to help review housing options. The biggest benefit of using an agent is the fact that agents often have access to properties before they are listed on the open market. The agent can also assist in prioritising a specific rental application above other applications, although the final decision is always made by the landlord (there is no requirement for the landlord to accept the first application for a rental property). When determining the overall cost of the rental property, it should be considered whether any charges are included in the monthly rent, such as utilities, cable television, etc. It is standard for landlords to request a security deposit of up to three months rent.\n\nThe purchase of property can take time and will also affect an individual’s tax situation (see our separate section on the tax issues related to real estate). The advice of a qualified real estate professional should be sought when purchasing a property in Switzerland, as they can explain the various fees that will be due upon purchase, including transfer taxes, notary fees, and land register fees (approximately 6-7% of the purchase price should be budgeted for these fees).\n\nThe Bilateral Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons provides that, effective 1 June 2002, an EU/EFTA national holding a residence permit and resident in Switzerland enjoys the same rights as Swiss citizens with regard to the purchase of real estate. In addition, C permit holders, regardless of nationality, have the same rights as Swiss citizens to purchase real estate. Those individuals can acquire real estate in Switzerland such as a principal residence or a second home, a holiday home, land to build on, or an investment in a property.\n\nEU nationals and cross-border workers (irrespective of nationality) who are not resident in Switzerland may acquire real estate if necessary for their gainful activity. Otherwise, the acquisition of a second residence or of holiday accommodation requires the granting of authorisation from the local authorities.\n\nIndividuals are required to pay at least 20% of the purchase price of a personal-use primary property as a down payment (i.e. the maximum amount of the mortgage is 80%). Generally, two mortgages are set up and the main one does not require amortisation of capital. Individuals can also use their pension capital (2nd and 3rd pillar) to finance the purchase of real estate in Switzerland, but only for a principal residence.\n\nPurchasing property in Switzerland may have significant impact upon an individual’s tax position. Fiscal advice should therefore be sought prior to any property purchase.\n\nIndividuals are often required to organise their utilities by arranging the services with the relevant company. In some cases, e.g. apartments in the city center, the arrangement of utilities can happen relatively quickly. However, it can take more time in an older home or for residents in rural locations, depending on the amount of work involved.\n\nThe telephone system in Switzerland is managed by Swisscom. To have a telephone line installed or connected an individual will need to contact them. After registering with Swisscom, a different service provider can be chosen from a variety of companies.\n\nThere is a wide range of internet service providers, which vary by geographic location. Some will also provide telephone options.\n\nThe public utility system (i.e. electricity, water) is usually managed by the cantons and the process will vary from canton to canton, as well as from city to city. As with Swisscom, one should expect to pay a deposit to have the services turned on and to register an individual account. Some utility companies will invoice based on estimated usage (usually from the preceding tenant) and will then adjust for the actual usage once a year or upon the closing of an individual’s account.\n\nTelevision signal systems vary from country to country, even within Europe, so an imported television may not receive a signal in Switzerland.\n\nFew basic channels can be received with an aerial only, but a satellite or cable hook-up is needed to access anything more than this basic service. It is possible to receive US and UK television broadcasts either via self-set up or through the local satellite dealers, although a supplemental fee is due for this service.\n\nEvery Swiss household is obliged to pay a television and/or radio license fee that is centrally collected through a company called SERAFE. All individuals whether they own a functioning radio or television or not are required to register with SERAFE upon arrival in Switzerland.\n\nPublic schools are funded by the cantons through tax revenue, so there are no additional fees for schooling at public schools. Children living in Switzerland are required to attend an educational institution, either private or public, from age 6 or 7. The compulsory education usually starts at the age of 4 and lasts for 11 years.\n\nThe public school system in Switzerland is divided into the following sections:\n\nNursery school (Kindergarden): for ages 4 to 6, usually two years before entering primary school. This school is mandatory in most cantons.\n\nPrimary school: for ages 6 to 12. Primary school encompasses grades one through six.\n\nSecondary school: for ages 12 to 15. Secondary school is designed to prepare the child for the post‑secondary schooling. Compulsory education is completed when graduating from secondary school.\n\nPost-secondary school: for ages 15 and up. Post‑secondary school can be a high school or an apprenticeship of 3 to 4 years, depending on the career plans of the student.\n\nThe public education system in Switzerland has a reputation for high quality and tough standards. Upon arrival in Switzerland, individuals wishing to register their children in public schools are required to contact the cantonal education department and will be required to provide them with a copy of a work/residence permit and proof of health and accident insurance for the child.\n\nIndividuals are required to have a valid driver’s licence to drive in Switzerland. Foreigners who are living in Switzerland are allowed to drive for up to one year on their home country driving licence or an international driving licence, assuming they meet the minimum legal driving age of 18 years old (21 for large trucks). To obtain a Swiss driver’s licence, an individual will have to apply at the local motor vehicle division with the following items:\n\nCompleted application to exchange their foreign licence for a Swiss licence.\n\nThe original foreign driver’s licence for exchange or for the authorities to stamp as “invalid in Switzerland”.\n\nA certificate from a Swiss certified optician that the eye examination has been passed, which costs about CHF 25 (the motor vehicle department can provide a list of certified opticians in a specific area).\n\nOne colour passport-sized picture.\n\nA copy of the Swiss permit (the actual permit must be brought along when applying for the licence).\n\nIn most cases, home country or international driving licences can be converted to a Swiss licence within the first year in Switzerland without taking an examination or practical driving test. Individuals from certain countries may be required to pass a practical driving test, but not the written exam.\n\nIndividuals who fail to convert the licence to a Swiss licence within one year from their arrival will have to take both the written and practical exams to obtain their Swiss licence.\n\nAn individual must have a residence permit (or at least the permit number) before they can purchase a car in Switzerland. Purchasing a car from a dealer is the simplest approach, as the dealer will usually take care of all registration items. However, it is possible to purchase from a private individual, with many listings being available on the internet.\n\nCars are required to pass a strict mechanical evaluation by the motor vehicle department on a periodic basis (usually every 2-5 years, depending on the age of the car). Any mechanical problems that are discovered must be corrected, and the vehicle re-examined by the motor vehicle department, within a short period of time. When purchasing a car in Switzerland, the buyer should question when the car last underwent this mechanical evaluation.\n\nAfter any purchase, an individual will need to obtain a licence plate and a “circulation permit”, as well as to take out insurance through a private insurer before the car can be driven in Switzerland. Proof of insurance and the grey “circulation permit” are the first things the police will ask for upon any traffic control.\n\nA car can be imported into Switzerland, provided the following documents are available:\n\nProof of car insurance by an insurance company registered in Switzerland;\n\nAn expert report with the official customs stamp and/or additional customs authorisation;\n\nThe date the vehicle was first registered from the original registration card;\n\nTechnical data of the vehicle, such as engine size, weight, and maximum speed; and\n\nAn antipollution maintenance card established in Switzerland after the proper tests have been completed.\n\nThere is an exemption under Swiss law that allows an individual to import their personal car without taxes or duties as part of their move to Switzerland, provided that they have owned the vehicle for six months prior to the move to Switzerland and they continue to own the vehicle 12 months after arrival in Switzerland\n\nOtherwise, Swiss VAT (7.7%) and car tax (4%) – both calculated on the car’s value – are payable upon importation of a car. Custom duties may also be charged, depending on the country of construction (not the country where the car was purchased) and the weight of the car. It may be possible to reclaim VAT paid in the country of purchase in certain circumstances.\n\nIn addition, the car will have to undergo a technical evaluation (as discussed above) and may require additional updates to be compatible with the Swiss system, such as ensuring the speedometer shows kilometres.\n\nFor any travel on the motorway, an annual (calendar year) highway sticker needs to be purchased. These stickers are available at the border crossings and most petrol stations for currently CHF 40. The speed limit on the highway is 120km/h unless posted otherwise, whereas the speed limit in towns is generally 50km/h.\n\nDrivers should pay attention for photo radars, both in the cities and on the motorways. Drivers caught exceeding the limit will receive a traffic ticket.\n\nAll passengers are required to wear their seatbelts. Drivers generally travel in the right lane unless passing another car. If a car behind flashes their lights or puts on their turn signal, it is a sign that they would like to pass. Swiss drivers will not honk the horn unless it is an emergency or someone has made a serious traffic error (as it is generally against traffic regulations to use the horn).\n\nEmployment contracts in Switzerland are subject to a trial period, which may vary depending on the employment contract. Once the trial period has passed, the employment contract may be cancelled if proper notice is given as follows (according to the dispositiv provisions of Swiss labour law):\n\nUp to one year of service: one month’s notice (at the end of a month).\n\nAs of the second year of service and up to the completion of the ninth year of service: two month’s notice (at the end of a month).\n\nAs of the tenth year of service and later: three month’s notice (at the end of the month).\n\nThe individual employment contract or a company policy might stipulate a different notice period, but it may not be less than one month.\n\nTermination of the employment contract should be communicated via registered mail by either party. A letter notifying the intention to end the contract must reach the employer or the employee by the last working day of the month for the notice to be effective for that month.\n\nThe notice period begins after the receipt of this letter and the salary continues to be paid during the notice period according to the employment contract. The final salary payment should include a prorated 13th monthly salary (if a 13th month salary payment is part of the employment contract) and any residual vacation balance should be taken during the notice period or paid in full.\n\nSwiss social security contributions are mandatory for residents of Switzerland (except for minors), unless covered by a valid exemption through continued membership in the home country’s system. In this case a Certificate of Coverage must be obtained from the authorities in the home country through the home country employer. The Swiss social security system is based on a three-pillar system as follows:\n\nPillar I (state pension): The first pillar consists of old‑age and survivor’s insurance, as well as invalidity insurance and a pension intended to cover the employee’s basic living costs upon retirement. Pillar I contributions are mandatory for both salaried employees and self‑employed individuals.\n\nPillar II (occupational pension scheme): The second pillar includes the same benefits as Pillar I and, together with Pillar I, should amount to at least 60% of the beneficiary’s last income and allow pensioners to maintain the standard of living to which they are accustomed. Pillar II contributions are mandatory for salaried workers only.\n\nPillar III (private pension scheme): The third pillar represents an additional savings plan for individuals to meet their further retirement needs and is optional for all individuals, although it offers tax benefits that may not be available with other forms of savings.\n\nThe social security contribution rates applicable for 2020 are summarised in the Health Insurance section.\n\nSwiss social security contributions are tax deductible (employee contributions) or tax‑free (employer contributions). Contributions to foreign social security schemes are treated in the same way to the extent that these foreign contributions are similar or at least comparable to the Swiss social security contributions.\n\nYou can find more information on the OASI webpage.\n\nResident individuals are in principle subject to Swiss taxation on their worldwide income and wealth. Domestic legislation, however, allows the following items to be exempted with progression from Swiss taxation:\n\nincome deriving from and the value attributable to foreign real estate; and\n\nself‑employed income deriving from and assets attributable to a foreign place of business or permanent establishment; and\n\nincome attributable to equity based incentive schemes that has been earned prior to taking up Swiss tax residency.\n\nFurther income and wealth items might be exempted with progression based on international legislation (i.e. double tax treaties).\n\nAny items (income or wealth) exempted with progression will be taken into account in order to determine the applicable tax rate (i.e. progression impact), but will not be subject to Swiss taxation.\n\nThe Swiss income tax basis is rather broad. Taxable income includes active (e.g. income from any gainful activity as well as pension income) and passive (e.g. interest, dividends, rental income) income. The most important exception from this general rule relates to capital gains on privately held movable assets (e.g. shares and bonds) that in general remain tax‑free. Capital gains on business assets are subject to ordinary income tax while capital gains on properties located in Switzerland are normally taxed separately from any other income at a special cantonal (and sometimes communal) capital gains tax.\n\nOnly 70% of the gross dividends deriving from qualified shareholdings (i.e. taxpayers owning 10% or more of the company’s capital) are taxed at the federal level. Most cantons provide similar (or even slightly higher) exemptions for such qualified dividends on the cantonal tax level.\n\nSubject to wealth tax are basically all of an individual’s assets with the exception of pension entitlements (Swiss and foreign) and household goods (e.g. furniture, clothes etc.). The taxable assets would for example include bank balances, securities of any kind and other investments, real estate (the value of foreign real estate is exempted with progression), cars, boats and planes as well as precious metals or art. In general, the fair market value of all the assets as at the end of the tax period (31 December or the date that an individual breaks Swiss tax residency) is subject to Swiss wealth tax. Only Swiss real estate is taxed on the normally lower tax value as determined by the cantonal tax authorities where the property is located. Any outstanding liabilities (e.g. mortgages, student loans, car loans, outstanding credit card balances) at the end of the tax period can be deducted from the value of the assets so that only the net wealth is subject to taxation.\n\nIndividuals qualifying as Expatriates for tax purposes can claim additional deductions or be reimbursed tax‑free for certain assignment related allowances. In order to qualify as Expatriate and individual must be:\n\na foreign national (Swiss nationals cannot qualify as Expatriates);\n\nan executive or specialist; and\n\nbe assigned to Switzerland by a foreign employer for a period not exceeding five years.\n\nIndividuals qualifying as Expatriates can claim the following deductions or be reimbursed on a tax‑free basis for the following assignment related allowances:\n\nactual relocation costs (shipping of household goods and travel costs for Expatriate and any accompanying family members) at the start and the end of the assignment; and\n\nfees for international schools for children accompanying the Expatriate to Switzerland provided these children are unable to go to public schools due to language issues; and\n\nreasonable Swiss housing costs provided that the Expatriate keeps his or her former principal residence in the home country available during the Swiss assignment.\n\nDespite of various efforts to harmonise the interpretation of Expatriate qualification mentioned above there are still significant cantonal differences. Individuals who qualify as Expatriate in one canton might therefore not be recognised as Expatriate in a different canton. This has to be examined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn addition, there are significant inter‑cantonal differences with respect to the deductions (or tax‑free reimbursements) allowed. The term “reasonable” is for example not defined by the legislation resulting in different limitations in different cantons.\n\nIn some cantons it is possible (or even recommendable) to obtain binding rulings with respect to the Expatriate status for certain populations. These rulings that are binding for all employees living in the canton with which the ruling has been agreed aim to agree on more objective qualification conditions and clear definitions and limitations for additional deductions (or tax‑free reimbursements). In certain cantons (especially in Geneva) it might even be possible to agree on standard deductions that do not depend on the actual costs incurred.\n\nEmployees who are required to travel extensively can be reimbursed with a standard representation allowance for small expenses (up to CHF 50 per occasion) incurred during such business travel. These representation allowances must be agreed with the competent cantonal tax authorities and remain free of income tax and social security contributions. In return, the employees are typically unable to claim reimbursement of small business expenses up to CHF 50 per occasion.\n\nTo agree on representation allowances with the competent cantonal tax authorities mainly results in an administrative simplification for employer and employees to reimburse small business expenses. Especially in Geneva, representation allowances can, however, be an interesting tax planning tool because the amounts granted by the Geneva tax authorities (normally around 5% to 10% of compensation up to an annual maximum of CHF 100’000) are significantly higher than in other cantons (most other cantons would not grant allowances of more than CHF 24’000 per annum for top executives and lower amounts for lower level employees).\n\nThe remuneration paid by or on behalf of Swiss based employers to Swiss resident foreign employees not holding a permanent residence permit (= C permit) and not married to a Swiss spouse or C permit holder is subject to tax at source (i.e. withholding tax on wages). These Swiss resident taxpayers only can and must file a Swiss tax return if:\n\ntheir annual(ised ) gross remuneration exceeds a certain threshold (CHF 500’000 in Geneva and CHF 120’000 in all other cantons); or\n\nthey have other income and wealth exceeding a certain threshold that is determined by their canton of residence (e.g. CHF 2’500 of income or CHF 200’000 of wealth in the canton of Zurich).\n\nIn the first scenario (i.e. annual gross remuneration exceeding a certain threshold) the final individual tax liability will be determined on the tax return filed. The tax already withheld at source will be credited against this final liability and the taxpayer will either receive a refund or will have to pay an additional amount.\n\nIn the second scenario (i.e. other income and wealth exceeding a certain threshold) the tax withheld at source will remain the final tax liability on the employment income. The tax due on the additional income and/or wealth is determined based on the return filed and must be paid in addition.\n\nEmployees whose salary is subject to withholding tax and whose annual (or annualised) gross income does not exceed the cantonal threshold can apply to the competent cantonal tax authority (deadline: 31 March of the year following the tax year - no extension possible!). The application is only possible to correct a possibly incorrect gross salary, an incorrect withholding tax rate or an incorrect rate-determining income.\n\nIf a person subject to withholding tax wishes to claim deductions, this must be done via the tax return procedure. A distinction must be made here as to whether the person is resident in Switzerland for tax purposes or not:\n\nPersons who are resident in Switzerland for tax purposes can claim deductions without restrictions via the tax return procedure. It is important to note that once a person has opted for the tax return procedure, a tax return must be submitted every year thereafter.\n\nPersons who are not resident in Switzerland for tax purposes can only claim deductions if they fulfil the requirements of \"quasi residency\". In other words, more than 90% of the worldwide family income must be subject to Swiss taxation. The application and the review of whether a tax return can be submitted must be carried out each year.\n\nThe submitted tax return is binding in any case, even if it has negative consequences for the taxpayer.\n\nDue to the various procedures, different deadlines and processes must be taken into account.\n\nThe filing deadline for Swiss tax returns (for resident and non‑resident taxpayers) is in general 31 March of the year following the tax year. Since the deadline is set by cantonal legislation each canton must, however, be checked separately. Most cantons allow this deadline to be extended easily, but the length of the extension can differ from canton to canton.\n\nMarried couples are in general obliged to file a joint return declaring the income and wealth of both spouses and of any minor children (i.e. children younger than 18 years old). In return, they are taxed at a special tax rate for married couples (at the federal level) with a lower progression and are granted higher standard deductions and personal exemptions than single individuals. Some cantons provide partial splitting systems (and higher deductions/exemptions) in order to achieve equal (or at least similar) treatment between married couples and single individuals.\n\nSince the enactment of the Swiss legislation on the recognition of same-sex relationships as per 1 January 2007 registered same‑sex partners qualify as married couples for Swiss tax purposes.\n\nEach tax return is formally assessed by the competent cantonal (or communal) tax authorities. The assessment is a formal decision whether the return is accepted as filed or whether changes are imposed. The assessment can be appealed within 30 days upon receipt. Depending on the canton it can easily take 12‑18 months from the date the return has been filed until the final assessment is issued.\n\nNon‑resident taxpayers whose Swiss sourced income is subject to tax at source or any other Swiss income tax withholding are typically (irrespective of their nationality) not obliged to file a Swiss tax return. Whether they are able to file a return or a tariff correction (see the respective section for resident taxpayers) depends very much on the situation and the applicable cantonal rules and practices. This should therefore be checked carefully on a case‑by‑case basis.\n\nNon‑resident taxpayers owning real estate located in Switzerland are – on the other hand – normally obliged to file an annual Swiss tax return irrespective of whether rental income is generated or not. A review on a case-by-case basis will even be more important with regards to the change in the source tax legislation as per January 2021.\n\nThe lump sum taxation is a special tax status available to foreign nationals who:\n\ntake up residence in Switzerland for the first time ever or after an absence of at least 10 years; and\n\ndo not perform any gainful activity in Switzerland.\n\nIndividuals benefitting from this special tax regime are not subject to Swiss taxation on their worldwide income and net wealth, but based on their worldwide expenditure (living costs). The minimum taxable income and wealth is typically agreed with the competent cantonal tax authorities in a binding ruling upon application prior to taking up Swiss tax residency.\n\nThese minimums are compared annually to the Swiss sourced income and the foreign sourced income for which relief from foreign taxation is obtained based on a Swiss double tax treaty. The taxpayer is taxed on the higher of the two at the ordinary progressive Swiss income and wealth tax rates applicable in the specific canton and community of residence.\n\nSome cantons (e.g. Canton of Zurich, Schaffhausen, Basel-City, Basel Country and Appenzell Ausserrhoden) have abolished this special tax status and consequently do not offer lump sum taxation for individuals residing in these cantons.\n\nThis special tax status can be an attractive tax planning tool for wealthy foreign taxpayers who want to relocate to Switzerland.\n\nThere are no federal estate, inheritance or gift taxes, but basically all cantons (with the exception of the canton of Schwyz) levy these taxes. In a few cases, inheritance, property and gift taxes are also levied by the communes.\n\nAn individual becomes liable to Swiss inheritance or gift tax upon:\n\nInheriting assets from a person whose last residence was in Switzerland; or\n\nReceiving a gift from a donor resident in Switzerland; or\n\nReceiving real estate located in Switzerland either as a gift or as an inheritance. Liability to taxation does not depend on the nationality of the deceased or of the donor, nor on the place of residence of the heir or donor.\n\nTransfers (i.e. gift and inheritance) to spouses are exempted from inheritance and gift tax in all cantons while transfers to direct descendants (i.e. children, grand‑children) are exempted in most cantons.\n\nThe tax rate for other transfers is normally progressive and depends on the competent canton (and/or community), the relationship between the two parties and the amount or value transferred. The marginal tax rate can be in excess of 50% in some cantons.\n\nSwitzerland introduced a value added tax (VAT) in January 1995 that is similar to the tax charged by other European countries. Liechtenstein has taken over the Swiss VAT system and, thus, Switzerland and Liechtenstein form one VAT territory. The VAT rate for most purchases in Switzerland is currently 7.7%, although some items are taxed at a reduced rate (currently 2.5%).\n\nPrivate individuals resident in Switzerland or Liechtenstein have to declare Swiss acquisition VAT, if they acquire supplies from non Swiss VAT registered providers domiciled outside Switzerland/ Liechtenstein for more than CHF 10’000 in the calendar year. Such supplies can be lawyer’s fees, tax advisors fees, professional fees, transportation of goods or installation services related to a Swiss property. In case the threshold of CHF 10’000 is met within one year, the total amount incurred in that year has to be declared at the latest by 28 February of the following year to the Swiss / Liechtenstein Federal Tax Administration.\n\nSupplies provided be foreign businesses* not VAT registered in Switzerland are subject to acquisition VAT:\n\nLawyer's fees\n\nTax Advisors fees\n\nProfessional services\n\nFinancial Accounting and private account administration\n\nMobile phone subscription**\n\nElectronic services**\n\nAircraft or yacht management fees\n\nCleaning, construction, gardening of a Swiss property\n\nValuation of art work\n\nAdvisory work for interior architecture and interior-design\n\n*In case the services are provided on an employment relationship between the foreign provider and Swiss recipient no VAT applies\n\n**Relevant for years up to and including 2017\n\nNot impacted supplies\n\nSupplies of goods subject to import VAT, including car maintenance abroad\n\nServices linked to the place of the supplier, e.g. healing treatments, therapies, nursing, personal hygiene, marriage, family and life counselling, social services and social welfare services and child and youth care\n\nMedical care carried out by medical staff\n\nServices of travel agencies\n\nServices linked to the place where carried out, such as:\n\n-Entry to an event\n\n-Restaurant services\n\n-Passenger transportation\n\nServices taxable at the place where a property is located, such as:\n\n-Brokerage, management, survey and valuation of property\n\n-Services in connection with the preparation or creation of rights in rem\n\nServices in connection with the preparation or the coordination of construction services, such as architectural, engineering and construction supervision services\n\n-Surveillance of properties and buildings\n\n-Accommodation services\n\nCleaning, construction and gardening of a property abroad\n\nHousehold goods and any collections, animals or cars can be imported into Switzerland duty‑free at the time of the change of residency. The imported goods must have been used personally abroad for at least 6 months before the importation date and they have to be continued to be used thereafter. It is possible to import household effects within two years after the change of residency provided the conditions mentioned above are met.\n\nClearance of household effects must occur at the time of the change of residency (relocation of the goods) and within the opening hours of customs offices for merchandise. For the first importation, the completed application form 18.44 needs to be presented at the customs office. Immigrants from the 25 initial EU States as well as from Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein may prove the change of residency with an employment contract, lease or confirmation of notice of departure from the country of departure. If emigrating from a different country, an assurance of a Swiss residence permit has to be provided to the customs authorities.\n\nSwitzerland introduced a value added tax (VAT) in January 1995 that is similar to the tax charged by other European countries.

Interest payments made on debt‑claims issued by Swiss debtors are excluded from the EU source tax, as they are already subject to Swiss withholding tax at 35%. Indeed, all interest payments subject to Swiss withholding tax will be excluded from EU source tax. In addition, and provided EU source tax is due, a beneficial owner can avoid the tax withholding by expressly authorising his Swiss paying agent to report the interest payments to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration."
