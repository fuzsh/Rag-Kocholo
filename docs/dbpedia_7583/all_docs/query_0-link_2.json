        "text": "1) Zurich Hauptbahnhof (Central Railway Station)\n\nCalled Zurich HB for short, the central railway station is the largest in Switzerland. The city's central location in the continent has historically made it a railway hub. It currently serves over 2,000 trains per day, making it one of the busiest in the entire world.\n\nThe station is built near the old town part of Zurich, called the Altstadt, at the confluence of the Limmat and Sihl Rivers. The Sihl passes into a tunnel that runs through the station. Zurich HB is built on two levels, with ground level and below-ground level train platforms. The two levels are tied together via the ShopVille shopping mall.\n\nThe city's first rail station was built on this site in 1847, but several significant expansions and redesigns have occurred since then. It was originally the end of the Swiss Northern Railway, which linked to Baden. As more and more rail lines connected into Zurich, a new, larger station to accommodate all of the traffic was built in 1871.\n\nThe main entrance arches face the Bahnhofstrasse, with a monument to railway pioneer Alfred Escher in front. The building is neo-Renaissance with richly decorated atriums, restaurants, and lobbies. Various features of the station have been modernized over time, including the electrification of all rail lines in the early 1900s and computerized signaling control in the 1960s.\n\n2) Bahnhofstrasse (Station Street) (must see)\n\nBahnhofstrasse is Zurich's main shopping avenue. It is mostly pedestrian-only, with tram access to the city's transportation network. The streets are lined with luxury retailers and fine-dining restaurants.\n\nBahnhofstrasse begins at the Zurich HB central railway station, which fronts Bahnhofplatz, or \"Station Square.\" From there, it continues southwards until the shore of Lake Zurich at BÃ¼rkliplatz.\n\nAlong its route, the street passes through several famous Zurich town squares, including Paradeplatz. This is a notoriously expensive real estate zone, where you will find the Swiss banks headquartered.\n\nThe street was created at the same time that the central rail station, Zurich Hauptbahnhof, was created in the 1870s. It was built on the moats that protected the original fortified city of Zurich.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nBahnhofstrasse is the center of old Zurich. From this central avenue, Rennweg and Augustinergasse lead off into the picturesque city. Anything you might be looking for in the town is likely centered off of this area, including dining, shopping, arts and entertainment, and all of the main tourist attractions.\n\nTips:\n\nCity trams connect the street with the rest of town. Master the tram system, and you can get anywhere you need to go.\n\nEvery corner of the street has a special treat to uncover. Don't miss mulled wine or hot chocolates at the rooftop bars during the colder months or strolling the lakeside in the summer.\n\nIn addition to the luxury brand shops on the street, check out the ShopVille shopping center under the Zurich HB. Here you'll find less expensive treats and food for any budget.\n\nMost businesses are closed on Sundays, except in the train station and ShopVille.\n\n3) Urania Observatory\n\nThe observatory, or Urania Sternwarte, is named for the muse of astronomy from ancient Greece. The observatory's 50-meter (167-foot) tall tower catches your eye from nearly anywhere in Altstadt (Zurich's historic district). It was begun in 1899 and began service in 1907.\n\nInside the tower is a Carl Zeiss-designed, two-lens system refracting telescope, giving up to a 600-power magnification. The 5-meter long telescope is installed on a pillar foundation, which goes straight through the buildings to a vibration-free mount below. Although now well over a century old, the telescope is still considered a technical masterpiece. In 2007, for the observatory's centennial, the telescope was entirely restored by Carl Zeiss AG (the company named after Carl Zeiss) in Germany.\n\nNot only will you see the moon, planets of the Solar System, stars, nebulae, and galaxies, but you'll also be treated to a spectacular view of the city. Guided tours are available on Friday and Saturday evenings, and they host special events throughout the year. There's even a restaurant and bar on-site.\n\n4) Lindenhofplatz (Lindenhof Square) (must see)\n\nLindenhof is a hilltop park situated at the site of a Roman fortification, right in Altstadt on the banks of the Limmat. The Roman settlement here is known to go back to the second century, and the castle was used throughout the fifth and sixth centuries. A citadel was built on the hilltop in the fourth century, which had two-meter wide walls and ten towers. The castle was refurbished for Louis the German in the ninth century, but by the 13th, it had been abandoned, and the stones were being repurposed for other buildings in town.\n\nWhile the Romans get most of the credit for first settling the area, Lindenhof had been important for the town well before that. As far back as the Neolithic and Bronze Age, from 4,500 to 850 BC, settlements have been centered here. Back then, the Sihl flooded most of the lower land, making the elevated hill ideal for settlement.\n\nSince the 1700s, the area has been used as a public park. Bow and crossbow shooting was the primary draw in the early days.\n\nA large fountain in the park, known as the Hedwig Fountain, commemorates the 1292 siege of Zurich by Duke Albert I of German. During the siege, Zurich's women dressed in full battle gear and tricked the Duke into believing that the city was protected. In reality, all of the men of Zurich were away at the time at another battlefront. The fountain was built in 1912 by sculptor Gustav Siber.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nThe Lindenhof is a great spot to capture stunning pictures of Zurich. The elevation means getting a bird's eye view of the rivers and the lake. It's a quiet green space where you can pause in between your other adventures. There are playgrounds for the kids and a giant outdoor chess board for fun.\n\nTips:\n\nYou can see the second-century Roman tombstone, found on this site in 1747, that bears the earliest record of \"Turicum,\" which was Zurich's Roman name. It's on display at the Swiss National Museum. There is a copy on display in the Lindenhof.\n\nThere are numerous festivals and events held throughout the year; check with the tourism office to see if any are planned during your visit.\n\n5) St. Peterskirche (St. Peter's Church) (must see)\n\nSaint Peterskirche (Saint Peter's Church) was built in the 9th century, which makes it the oldest church in Zurich. It also boasts the fame of having the largest clock face in all of Europe, measuring 8.6 meters (28.3 feet) in diameter. This translates to a minute hand that is 5.7 meters long (18.8 feet)!\n\nThe church was significantly altered in the 13th century and again in the early 1700s. Up until 1911, a firewatcher manned the steeple. It was his job to look out the windows four times an hour to look for fires. If he spotted a fire, he was to sound an alarm and point to the direction of the fire with a flag. Apparently, this ended up being an effective strategy because, unlike many other European cities, Zurich never suffered any devastating fires.\n\nThe interior of the church features a Baroque nave and a Romanesque choir with some faded medieval murals including a glimpse of a saint. A fascinating sight to see inside Saint Peter's is the name of God in Hebrew above the pulpit, indicating the Reformation emphasis on the original biblical languages.\n\nOne interesting fact about the church is that it has split ownership. The City of Zurich owns the church tower, while Saint Peterâs parish of the Swiss Reformed Church owns the belfry and bells, as well as the staircase leading to the tower.\n\nTip:\n\nIt is very interesting up close, but it is more beautiful from across the river.\n\n6) FraumÃ¼nster (Church of Our Lady) (must see)\n\nAs you may have noticed, Zurichâs skyline is dotted with church spires; however, none are as remarkable as the slender blue spire of the FraumÃ¼nster. In 853 Emperor Ludwig founded a Benedictine convent on this site and his daughter became the first abbess of the convent. In 874 a basilica with a crypt was added. The crypt holds the relics of the martyred two Patron Saints of Zurich, Felix and Regula.\n\nThe present church on the site dates from the mid 13th century, but the crypt still remains beneath the church. Reformation closed the convent and in 1524, the last abbess donated the church and abbey to City of Zurich. All icons and religious imagery were destroyed.\n\nThe church underwent a remodel in the 1970, with the installation of beautiful stained glass windows by the famous Russian-French modernist artist Marc Chagall. The five windows are 10 meters high and each has its own color theme. On the northern side is the red-orange âProphetâ window. On the eastern side, the windows are named âJacobâ, âChristâ, and âZionâ, from left to right. The south wall piece is called âLawâ.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nReasonable entry fee and definitely worth stepping in to admire the lovely Marc Chagall stained glass windows.\n\nIncluded in the ticket is a very good audio guide that really brings the building and the 5 windows to life.\n\nTip:\n\nBe sure to bring Swiss francs as only cash is accepted.\n\nNO PHOTOS of the Marc Chagall windows allowed inside.\n\n7) GrossmÃ¼nster (Great Minster) (must see)\n\nThe Grossmunster Church stands proudly in Zurich, boasting a Romanesque architectural style and a rich historical background. Alongside the Fraumunster, Predigerkirche, and Saint Peterskirche, it forms one of the city's four major churches. Legend has it that the church's origins trace back to a commission by the Roman emperor Charles the Great, with construction beginning around 1100 and completion marked around 1220.\n\nNotably, the Grossmunster Church holds significance as the birthplace of the Swiss-German Reformation. In 1520, Huldrych Zwingli, a key figure in the Swiss Reformation movement, initiated reforms from his pastoral office within the church. Zwingli's debates, which he triumphed in before local authorities in 1523, led to the church's separation from papal authority.\n\nThe reforms spearheaded by Zwingli and later continued by Heinrich Bullinger left their mark on the church's interior. In 1524, iconoclastic actions saw the removal of religious imagery and the organ. These reforms went beyond aesthetics, impacting various aspects of religious practice including fasting traditions, the Mass, celibacy, and the use of church music. The Grossmunster Church thus stands as a pivotal site in the history of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nA statue of Emperor Charles the Great adorns the southern tower of the Grossmunster Church, commemorating his reign as Holy Roman Emperor from 771 to 814. Known for uniting much of Western and Central Europe, his legacy extends to language, with many European terms for \"king\" deriving from his name. The statue portrays Charles holding his sword, with his crown seemingly slipping from his head.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nFairly plain inside, but the sliced agate windows are some of the more interesting and colorful anywhere.\n\nThe old statue of Carolus Magnus is definitely worth seeing, and you can't miss the beautiful door as you go in.\n\nTip:\n\nA trip to the top of the tower is worth it if you can do 180+ steps straight up. The views are wonderful and you can stay as long as you wish.\n\n8) Kunsthaus Zurich (Museum of Art) (must see)\n\nThe Kunsthaus is one of the most important museums in Europe. The museum's collection is impressive and diverse, from pieces dating to the middle ages to contemporary with an emphasis on Swiss art through various periods. Some of the Swiss artists represented include Fussli, Hodler, Rist and Fischli. Works by Munch, Lipchitz, Van Gough, Picasso, and Giacometti are a draw as well. The museum also boasts a collection by Monet and another by Chagall.\n\nSpecial collections include Swiss Paintings, Swiss Realism, Zurich Concrete Art, and collections featuring paintings and sculptures by Bocklin, Segantini, Hodler, and Vallotton. The museum also has a good collection of video art that started in 1979, with the thought that video art is an independent and creative medium. Video artists represented include Acconci, Baldessari, Calle, Graham, Hill, Marclay, Paik and others. In addition to the permanent collection, the museum features temporary exhibits and a library with books focusing on modern art. An audio guide which highlights over 200 of the pieces in the collection is available.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nSuper modern with lots of unique perspectives! If you're a fan of modern art and appreciate surrealism and impressionism, this museum is a must.\n\nTip:\n\nFree entry to the main collection on Wednesdays, and you can also get an audio guide for no cost. Their library is open-access anytime.\n\nThe building might not look massive on the outside, but the collection is extensive, so make sure you leave at least 2-3 hours to visit.\n\n9) Kronenhalle Restaurant\n\nLocated in a Bellevue Square building built in 1862, the Kronenhalle Restaurant is probably Zurich's most famous eatery. Opened in 1924 by Hulda and Gottlieb Zumsteg, it quickly became the town's meeting place of writers and artists. Zurich's rich and famous have passed through ever since.\n\nIt's the sort of old-world continental dining experience that you would expect from Zurich. Surrounded by art and history, the impeccable service and outstanding food are nothing short of spectacular. Everything about this experience is about tradition.\n\nThe restaurant consists of three galleries. In the brasserie, you dine under chandeliers in their main dining area. The smaller Chagall Room was also the original dining area when the restaurant first opened in the 1920s. It is more intimate and private than the brasserie, and it's adorned with artwork by Pierre Bonnard and Marc Chagall. The Swiss Gallery is a smaller room decorated with all Swiss art.\n\nIt's quite hard to get a table in this must-dine restaurant. Book well in advance, or try your luck with your hotel's concierge."
