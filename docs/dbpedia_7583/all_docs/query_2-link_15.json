        "text": "All tax-resident individuals are taxed on their worldwide income and wealth. Non-tax-resident individuals are only taxed on Swiss sources of income and wealth.\n\nIncome taxes are levied at three different levels: at the federal level (which is the same all over Switzerland), at the cantonal level (which is the same within a certain canton and is based on the canton's own tax law and tax rates), and at the municipal level (municipalities follow the cantonal tax law, but are entitled to set their own communal tax rate within certain parameters). Income tax rates are progressive at the federal level and in most of the cantons. Some cantons have recently introduced flat rate taxation.\n\nAll income is taxed on the basis of the same tax return with generally the same tax rate (i.e. all income sources are added together), and from such total income all applicable deductions are subtracted. This results in an applicable tax rate that is levied on all taxable income. Based on applicable DTTs, the actual taxable income in Switzerland may differ from the tax rate determining income. Furthermore, dividend income from substantial participations may be taxed at a lower tax rate based on domestic federal and cantonal law.\n\nPersonal income tax rates\n\nDirect federal tax on income (for 2024)\n\nI - Single taxpayers\n\nTaxable income (CHF*) Tax on column 1 (CHF) Percentage on excess (%) Over Not over 0 15,000 - - 15,000 32,800 - 0.77 32,800 42,900 137.05 0.88 42,900 57,200 225.90 2.64 57,200 75,200 603.40 2.97 75,200 81,000 1,138.00 5.94 81,000 107,400 1,482.50 6.60 107,400 139,600 3,224.90 8.80 139,600 182,600 6.058.50 11.00 182,600 783,200 10,788.50 13.20 783,200 90,067.70 11.50\n\n* Swiss francs\n\nFor taxable income above CHF 783,300 the overall tax rate will be 11.5%.\n\nII - Married taxpayers and single taxpayers with minor children\n\nTaxable income (CHF) Tax on column 1\n\n(CHF) Percentage on excess (%) Over Not over 0 29,300 - - 29,300 52,700 - 1 52,700 60,500 234 2 60,500 78,100 390 3 78,100 93,600 918 4 93,600 107,200 1,538 5 107,200 119,000 2,218 6 119,000 128,800 2,926 7 128,800 136,600 3,612 8 136,600 142,300 4,236 9 142,300 146,300 4,749 10 146,300 148,300 5,149 11 148,300 150,300 5,369 12 150,300 928,600 5,609 13 928,600 106,788 11.5\n\nFor taxable income above CHF 928,600 the overall tax rate will be 11.5%.\n\nZurich cantonal tax (basic tax)\n\nIII - Single taxpayers (income taxes)\n\nTaxable income (CHF) Basic tax on column 1 (CHF) Percentage on excess (%) Over Not over 0 6,900 - 0 6,900 11,800 - 2 11,800 16,600 98 3 16,600 24,500 242 4 24,500 34,100 558 5 34,100 45,100 1,038 6 45,100 58,000 1,698 7 58,000 75,400 2,601 8 75,400 109,000 3,993 9 109,000 142,200 7,017 10 142,200 194,900 10,337 11 194,900 263,300 16,134 12 263,300 24,342 13\n\nIV - Married taxpayers and single taxpayers with minor children (income taxes)\n\nTaxable income (CHF) Basic tax on column 1 (CHF) Percentage on excess (%) Over Not over 0 13,900 - 0 13,900 20,200 - 2 20,200 28,200 126 3 28,200 37,900 366 4 37,900 49,000 754 5 49,000 63,300 1,309 6 63,300 95,100 2,167 7 95,100 127,000 4,393 8 127,000 174,900 6,945 9 174,900 232,100 11,256 10 232,100 294,200 16,974 11 294,200 365,800 23,807 12 365,800 32,399 13\n\nV - Calculation of effective taxes\n\nFor Zurich cantonal taxes, the above rates have to be multiplied with 0.98. For the additional municipal taxes, the above rate has to be multiplied by the respective municipal tax factor, which varies between 0.72 and 1.30 (City of Zurich: 1.19). For church tax the basic tax above is multiplied by the church tax factor, which is between 0.06 and 0.17.\n\nGeneva cantonal tax (basic tax)\n\nThe Geneva tax table is quite complex as it does not apply a tax bracket system. The tax rates are increasing continuously in small increments with each increase in income. The table below therefore only provides a general overview (for 2023).\n\nTaxable income (CHF) Tax Rate (%) From To 0 18,054 0.00 18,055 21,752 8.00 21,753 23,928 9.00 23,929 26,102 10.00 26,103 28,278 11.00 28,279 33,716 12.00 33,717 38,066 13.00 38,067 42,417 14.00 42,418 46,767 14.50 46,768 75,045 15.00 75,046 122,900 15.50 122,901 165,316 16.00 165,317 187,069 16.50 187,070 267,552 17.00 267,553 284,953 17.50 284,954 401,328 18.00 401.329 628,637 18.50 More than 628,637 19.00\n\nThe tax rate applicable to a married couple or individuals in a Swiss registered partnership is the rate applicable to 50% of their combined income (so-called 'splitting'). The tax rate applicable to single, widowed, divorced, or separated individuals living with a dependant (child or adult) is the rate applicable to 50% of the income.\n\nThe above tax rates are basically applicable to taxpayers filing a tax return. Effective cantonal income and wealth tax is determined by multiplying the basic tax by the multiplier applicable for the tax (calendar) year in question, and then by adding the supplementary tax on wealth.\n\nStarting from 2024, single, divorced, or separated parents will each benefit from a partial splitting (reduction of the tax rate; until then integral splitting attributed only to one parent) if they are both providing support with the other parent for the care, maintenance, and expenses for their children. Several conditions will apply.\n\nLocal income taxes\n\nGeneva communal tax\n\nEach commune of the canton of Geneva determines the multiplier applied on the cantonal tax rate and hence its communal tax rate autonomously depending on its financial needs. As result, the communal taxes can vary significantly. The communal taxes are, as mentioned above, a percentage of the cantonal taxes, and are levied in conjunction with the cantonal taxes. For example, the effective communal tax of the city of Geneva is 45.5% of basic cantonal tax. The highest communal tax rate is 51% of the basic cantonal tax and is levied in the communes of Chancy and Avully. On the contrary, the lowest communal tax rate is applicable in the communes of Genthod (25%), Cologny (27%), and Collonge-Bellerive or Vandoeuvres (both 29%).\n\nWithholding requirements for sales of property, dividends, interest and royalties\n\nIn general, interest and dividend income derived from Swiss sources is subject to a 35% withholding tax (WHT), which tax has to be withheld from the paying party (e.g. bank or Swiss company) and is directly deducted from the gross amount paid to the recipient. Based on the facts and circumstances, this tax may be credited towards the overall income tax liability in Switzerland or may be refunded.\n\nOn payments received for loans secured by a property located in Switzerland (without repayment amounts, e.g. mainly mortgage interest) a tax at source may be due if the creditor (individual or legal entity) is domiciled abroad. Tax at source has to be withheld by the payer of the interest. Applicable DTTs may cap or abolish the applicable cantonal tax rates."
