        "text": "Can foreigners buy property in Switzerland?\n\nSwitzerland has strict restrictions on foreigners buying property, so depending on your background, you may find your options limited. You can buy property in Switzerland if you:\n\nare an EU or EFTA national with a Swiss residence permit who resides in Switzerland\n\nhold a Swiss C Permit\n\nIn both cases, you have the same rights as a Swiss citizen to purchase property. You can buy investment properties, holiday homes, or commercial premises as well as a primary residence. If you hold a Swiss B Permit, you may also purchase a property, but only to live in.\n\nThose outside these categories, such as non-resident foreigners, foreign residents without a Swiss work permit (including those working for diplomatic missions, United Nations agencies, and CERN), or workers on short-term or seasonal work permits, may not be allowed to purchase property or may have to apply for a license to purchase.\n\nBe aware that licensing criteria vary from canton to canton. It typically favors applicants purchasing a primary residence who have been settled in the canton for five years or more. There are a number of consultancies that are able to help you understand the process of buying Swiss property, such as Cosmos Value.\n\nLife as a frontier worker: working in Switzerland and living elsewhere\n\nSwitzerland is a small country. Many of its major cities, including Geneva and Basel, are close enough to borders that it is possible to live in a neighboring country while working in Switzerland.\n\nProperty prices are typically cheaper across the border. If your work permit allows it, you may wish to consider becoming a frontier worker and buying property in France or getting a German property and a job in Switzerland.\n\nHow to buy real estate in Switzerland\n\nAfter you find your new home, you still must make an offer, find a mortgage, agree on the sale, and sign a contract.\n\nThis isn’t a process that moves quickly. In Switzerland, it is common for the process to last three months or more. When buying a home, you should budget 5% of the purchase price for fees and charges, including property transfer tax – which can be as much as 3% in some areas.\n\nChoosing a property in Switzerland\n\nIn Switzerland, asking for a professional survey of the property is uncommon. Builders may take a request for a survey as a negative comment on the quality of their work. However, as the seller is not required to notify you of any issues, a survey may give you advance warning of serious problems, particularly with older properties.\n\nYou can find a variety of property types in Switzerland, from large detached houses to apartments in contained blocks. Minergie operates the standard for sustainability and energy efficiency in newly-built homes, with between 10-25% of new buildings Minergie-certified in the last 20 years, depending on the region.\n\nYou might be familiar with paying a service charge for the maintenance of common areas if you live in an apartment. In Switzerland, however, even detached houses are likely to come with annual service charges for the maintenance of common areas such as car parks, boat docks, or private roads. For apartments, the cost can be around 1% of the purchase price each year.\n\nLocal property taxes in Switzerland vary enormously from commune to commune as well as from canton to canton. Ask about the level of taxation when shopping around for properties.\n\nGetting a Swiss mortgage\n\nBefore making an offer, you must apply for a mortgage from a bank. Mortgages can be arranged directly with lenders, but also with a mortgage broker that provides negotiation between the seller, the lender, and when required, signs the contract on the client’s behalf.\n\nWhen you apply, the lender assesses the value of the property you are considering and decides whether to offer you a mortgage. A 20% deposit is typically the minimum necessary, including at least 10% in cash.\n\nThere are no general assistance schemes in Switzerland to help with the costs of buying property. If you don’t have the minimum 20% to contribute towards a mortgage, you are unlikely to be able to buy a Swiss home. The only help available is to first-time buyers. Some mortgage providers offer lower interest rates to help people onto the property ladder.\n\nHousing\n\nSwiss mortgages\n\nRead more\n\nIf you need help navigating the mortgages available in Switzerland, it’s worth reaching out to an advisor such as:\n\nHYPOHAUS\n\nSwiss Prime International\n\nHYPOHAUS also provide an online mortgage calculator so you can find out which type of financing is best for you and how much you can borrow.\n\nMaking an offer on a home in Switzerland\n\nHow much you can borrow when taking out a mortgage may determine the offer you can make on a property. Once you decide on a bid, communicate this offer to the seller, either through your estate agent or directly. Estate agents in Switzerland typically work for the seller. This means you should take their claims with a pinch of salt.\n\nIf the offer is accepted, you may need to pay a deposit at this stage. If so, a notary holds this in escrow. You still need a written agreement covering the circumstances in which the deposit will be forfeit or returned.\n\nYou also must inform your mortgage provider that your offer was successful and complete any remaining paperwork with them. They then inform the notary that the method of payment is complete and the sale can go ahead.\n\nCompleting a real estate purchase in Switzerland\n\nIn Switzerland, a notary handles the property transfer. In many Swiss cantons, notaries are public officers working for both buyer and seller. The buyer may suggest a notary or you may wish to select one yourself.\n\nThe notary will typically:\n\nDraw up the contract;\n\nHold the buyer’s funds in escrow;\n\nComplete the official transfer of the property;\n\nRegister the change of ownership;\n\nEnsure that all legal formalities are complete;\n\nBe able to advise on the legitimacy and legality of a transaction.\n\nSale contracts in Switzerland\n\nA public notary usually draws up the sales contract. Indeed, in some cantons, this is required by law – and thus is fairly standard. However, if you are unfamiliar with the area or do not speak the local language, get your own legal representation to explain the details of the agreement. As the mortgage is agreed prior to the sale contract, your mortgage provider may check the contract for you, perhaps for free. Swiss law stipulates that the buyer and seller must be able to understand the local language or give power of attorney to a person that can sign on their behalf."
