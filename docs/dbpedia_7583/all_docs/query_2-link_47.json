        "text": "yuuka\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nFrom the Red Line\n\n·\n\n9 min read\n\n·\n\nJun 3, 2023\n\n--\n\nI was in Switzerland last month.\n\nOf course, this is a transportation blog, I’m not here to talk about the rosti or chocolate I’ve eaten. There will be mountains, though, but that’s part of the point.\n\nThe Swiss are famed for their public transport system. It’s possible to get anywhere on the country, even some of the remotest villages, purely by public transport. It’s not going to be frequent — such is the economic realities of serving a 50-person village — but it’s there and it works. And pretty well, too.\n\nNot Just Bikes isn’t the only person fawning over the Swiss. Our own political leaders in Singapore also hold the Swiss standard of living as one to uphold (for which much memes are made), so let’s take a look to see if there’s really any takeaways that can be had here.\n\nA nest of Cobras\n\nThe first thing that struck me on arrival was the extensive use of trams, like in many other European cities and countries; but Zurich probably takes this to an extreme. Switzerland, notably, didn’t really participate in the metro-building manias of the 1970s, compared to its neighbours France and Germany. Most notably, the only Swiss metro is in Lausanne for reasons that become obvious when you actually go there, and Zurich voters actually rejected grade separated infrastructure twice at the ballot box.\n\nWhat stood out when I arrived at Zurich Hauptbahnhof was the almost-total absence of city buses. Instead, there were a lot of trams, and a double-articulated trolleybus on route 31 — one of only two bus lines serving the Hauptbahnhof. Further examination of the ZVV’s network map shows a very extensive tram network in central Zurich, with suburban bus services terminating not at the Hauptbahnhof, but at other outer-city train stations (and in some cases, tram terminals such as Klusplatz). This means these suburban bus users have to change to the S-Bahn or the trams to get to wherever they need to go in Zurich proper. Unluckier ones may even need to make two or three transfers, even despite the relatively compact size of Zurich city.\n\nEven at the airport itself, tram line 10 travels between the airport and the Hauptbahnhof. But unless your final destination was along tram 10, why do that when the same ticket allows you to use S-Bahn, and in certain cases intercity trains, from the Zurich Airport train station?\n\nIn any case, the trams are no slouch. The old ones have character — there are several kinds of high floor Tram-2000 units, some of which even have new low-floor modules installed to add accessibility, and all of which can be coupled together to make up trainsets up to 43m long. Most of what I saw are also mid-2000s Cobra units, 36m long, and Zurich is also in the midst of receiving 43m long Bombardier Flexity trams. Put together, in theory, these can replace heavier forms of transit in terms of capacity.\n\nThe only issue is that the trams are slow. Really slow. Anecdotally speaking, I almost never saw a tram pass 40kph while running on city streets. Maybe they do reach their maximum speeds of 60kph in the tram tunnel or some of the newer light rail sections. If you ask me, this shouldn’t be a good thing; but the planning of the ZVV network essentially means most people try to get to their nearest S-Bahn station anyway for faster trips; trams are used here as a bus replacement, not a metro replacement.\n\nThough it might not be the trams’ fault alone, considering how city authorities have been rolling out 30kph speed limits in the name of noise reduction. Any peripheral benefit to active mobility from such a policy being a plus, albeit at the expense of public transport, of course.\n\nOut of the tunnels\n\nLeaving Zurich en route to other Swiss cities, the same avoidance of competition can also be seen. Most famously, at a national level, Swiss law allows the federal government to retain all control over what public transport services are provided. European coach operator Flixbus was denied the right to carry passengers domestically in Switzerland (take the trains instead). And when they were caught doing so anyway, they were fined heavily. Likewise, the same policies domestically mean there are no intercity buses, with the train network and its clock-face transfers deemed to be acceptable.\n\nI actually started my Swiss travels in Lausanne, the smallest city in the world to have a metro, but didn’t really spend a lot of time there. This is tangentially related to why they have a metro — the city itself is built on a hillside, and it probably says more about me that walking around the old town of Lausanne for half a day tired me out.\n\nOf course, there’s a bit of home here too — Line m2 of the Lausanne Metro is the only system outside of Singapore, as far as I’m aware, to use the Alstom Urbalis 300 train control system. In the greater social fabric its role also seems more similar to the NEL, being to transport passengers from outer suburbs to the central areas, so one might think that Line m2 is essentially the NEL’s spiritual “little brother”.\n\nWith the opening of Line m2, though, several regional bus services were amended to connect with m2 stations such as Sallaz and Croisettes instead of to Flon in the old town or the train station. Again, the NEL comparisons are apt — consider Sallaz and Croisettes as Serangoon and Sengkang/Punggol respectively.\n\nI must suspect that this is due to Swiss direct democracy — getting a megaproject like a metro built means providing benefits to as many people as possible in order to get them to vote for it. It means that people not living along the metro but still within the constituency have to be appeased — and tl chose to do that by not having the bus do the same job as the metro, reinvesting those bus resources into improving service for others and preserving the political capital.\n\nWe can possibly see the opposite in Zurich, where the U-Bahn was voted down twice because it couldn’t promise public transport improvements for everyone, but tram improvements and the implementation of the S-Bahn got through the electorate. There is no direct democracy in Singapore and not much of a need to appease local political forces, but the lessons of keeping good service available to as many people as possible still applies, in order to make public transport attractive.\n\nNetwork effect\n\nNo visit to Switzerland is complete without going up into the mountains, of course; but considering the weather, I happened to take an odd route up to Mount Rigi.\n\nThis particular trip, unlike the previous urban experiences, probably demonstrates best the Swiss approach to planning and infrastructure. Starting in Lucerne, I took a regional train for a few stops — officially not operated by the SBB-CFF-FFS, but by the Sudostbahn as an open access operator over SBB infrastructure, and they kind of sold it as a tourist train. Still, it makes regional stops, and people are expected to use this train as a regional train.\n\nThis is common in Switzerland where many of these railways don’t just survive on the tourist trade alone. Even the famous Bernina Express has a section for local passengers which can be used like any other local train in Switzerland. I later switched to a regional bus to get to Vitznau, where the Lake Lucerne boats stop anyway, and where I could join the Vitznau-Rigi Railway that would take me to near the top of Mount Rigi.\n\nOf course, if I didn’t want to take the Vitznau-Rigi Railway in particular, and I just wanted to get to the top of Mount Rigi, I could put that directly into the search query, giving me another route up through Arth-Goldau.\n\nBut how would you even achieve this level of coordination to make the transfers less of a hard pill to swallow? If my limited German abilities do me well here, Swiss law has the answer. By law, an obligation of timetable and real-time information sharing on any transport operator serving the public is imposed. This information is then compiled and placed into a database, that is available to all.\n\nAnd that means, as you have seen earlier in this post, means the SBB app is able to use this information source to pull information on services it has no control over, such as local bus services and the Rigi mountain railways. An extreme case is even the route to the Jungfraujoch. You leave SBB territory at Thun, pass over four separate railways (BLS AG, the Berner-Oberland-Bahn, the Wengernalpbahn (or the Eiger Express cable car), and the Jungfraubahn), before getting to the Jungfraujoch. Deutsche Bahn, the German railways, even run some through trains all the way to Interlaken Ost, so that’s a fifth company.\n\nHeck, if I so desired, I could even have started my query at the local public transport stops nearest to my accommodations, instead of finding the nearest train station or just keying in Zurich Hauptbahnhof or Bern railway station (I spent nights in both cities) as a default choice. And if I did that, I would have been able to see information on local public transport to get me to the major train station, in the SBB app.\n\nThe illusion of free choice\n\nThe biggest thing I’ve learnt from this trip is, what use is service coverage when we don’t talk about frequency? Despite the other issues that I’ve raised, this is the most fundamental of all. After I returned from Switzerland and found myself working more overtime, I got to the bus interchange to see this. I believe it’s self explanatory.\n\nIn Singapore you see people insisting that we ought to retain choice — to let people continue taking expressway buses when we build a train line, for example. But when this causes one mode of transport to neglect its role in the system, what can we do? Of course, one might argue that Service 973 has plenty of alternatives where it matters and low levels of demand where it doesn’t matter, but I might refer them to MP Gerald Giam and Service 228.\n\nIn Switzerland, they don’t care about retaining choice. After all, the choice is between public transport and private vehicle usage, not between modes of public transport. Distances between Swiss cities and the frequency of the intercity network basically makes it entirely possible that the fastest route might involve two or more InterRegio trains and switch at Olten or Arth-Goldau or something. And remember, there are no intercity buses. And on an urban level, there is integrated top-down urban transport planning — most notably in Zurich with the ZVV. In Zurich, there are no bus routes from Stadelhofen to Oerlikon in Zurich because you’re supposed to take the S-Bahn.\n\nConsequently, frequency is important — or at least providing the illusion of it through timed transfers at interchange points. Even small stations outside villages such as Kussnacht am Rigi qualify too — built to the standards of what the LTA would call a bus terminal here, and directly connected to the train station. There’s even a full bike rack in the below picture, pointing to how people use active mobility as part of a journey. Transfers are part and parcel of life in Switzerland.\n\nOf course, it is not just service planning alone. Data infrastructure has to be there to remove the fog of war and help passengers plan their journeys. It doesn’t have to be timetables, considering the density of Singapore public transport traffic. At the very least, we must allow people to leverage new data tools to plan transport; reducing the cognitive headache of route planning that makes people want direct routes and car replacement buses.\n\nThe long and short of it is that my trip to Switzerland has taught me that choice in public transport is only an illusion. The choice is between public transport and car use, and various modes must work together in order to provide an alternative that’s sufficiently attractive to private vehicle use.\n\nAnd without a doubt, thinking this way means the Swiss standard is an impressive one."
