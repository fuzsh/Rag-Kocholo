        "meta_description": "Abstract. The European Alps stretch over a range of climate zones which affect the spatial distribution of snow. Previous analyses of station observations of\nsnow were confined to regional analyses. Here, we present an Alpine-wide analysis of snow depth from six Alpine countries â Austria, France, Germany,\nItaly, Slovenia, and Switzerland â including altogether more than 2000 stations of which more than 800 were used for the trend assessment. Using a\nprincipal component analysis and k-means clustering, we identified five main modes of variability and five regions which match the climatic\nforcing zones: north and high Alpine, north-east, north-west, south-east, and south and high Alpine. Linear trends of monthly mean snow depth between\n1971 and 2019 showed decreases in snow depth for most stations from November to May. The average trend among all stations for seasonal (November to\nMay) mean snow depth was â8.4â% per decade, for seasonal maximum snow depth â5.6â% per decade, and for seasonal snow\ncover duration â5.6â% per decade. Stronger and more significant trends were observed for periods and elevations where the transition\nfrom snow to snow-free occurs, which is consistent with an enhanced albedo feedback. Additionally, regional trends differed substantially at the same\nelevation, which challenges the notion of generalizing results from one region to another or to the whole Alps. This study presents an analysis of\nstation snow depth series with the most comprehensive spatial coverage in the European Alps to date.",

        "text": "2.2âData sources\n\nThe acquisition of snow observation data was performed by using open data portals and by directly contacting data providers (see TableÂ 1 for an overview). For Austria, the Austrian Hydrographical Service (HZB, Hydrographisches ZentralbÃ¼ro) offers free downloads of their data for recent decades, and additional historical data at the seasonal scale were kindly provided by the HZB. For France, data were kindly provided by the national weather service MÃ©tÃ©o-France. This includes data collected as part of the collaborative network (rÃ©seau nivo-mÃ©tÃ©orologique) between MÃ©tÃ©o-France and mountain stakeholders (in particular Domaines Skiables de France, Association Nationale des Maires des Stations de Montagne, and l'Association Nationale des Directeurs de Pistes et de la SÃ©curitÃ© de Stations de Sports d'Hiver). For Germany, data were downloaded from the national weather service's (DWD, Deutscher Wetterdienst) open data portal using the R package rdwd. For Germany, only stations below 49ââN were downloaded. For Italy, the data were kindly provided by many regional authorities:\n\nfor the province of Bolzano, from the hydrographical office of Bolzano (BZ);\n\nfor Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG), from the regional weather observatory (OSMER, Osservatorio meteorologico regionale), which is part of the ARPA (Agenzia regionale per la protezione dell'ambiente) FVG and from where the data were collected and cleaned by the Servizio foreste e corpo forestale struttura stabile centrale per l'attivitÃ di prevenzione del rischio da valanga;\n\nfor Lombardy, from the ARPA Lombardia;\n\nfor Piedmont, from the ARPA Piemonte;\n\nfor the province of Trento, from Meteotrentino (TN) with some additional long-term series previously analysed (TN_TUM; Marcolini etÂ al., 2017a);\n\nfor the Aosta Valley (VDA), from the civil protection office (CF: Centro funzionale, Regione Valle d'Aosta) and from the avalanche office (AIBM: Assetto idrogeologico dei bacini montani, Regione Valle d'Aosta);\n\nfor Veneto, from the avalanche office (Centro valanghe di Arabba), which is part of the ARPA Veneto;\n\nand, finally, additional data for Piedmont and Aosta Valley from the Italian meteorological society (SMI, SocietÃ Meteorologica Italiana).\n\nFor Slovenia, data were kindly provided by the Slovenian Environmental Agency (ARSO, Agencija Republike Slovenije za okolje). For Switzerland, data were downloaded from the IDAWEB portal of the national weather service MeteoSwiss, and additional data were kindly provided by the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF. This dataset comprises the entire geographical range of the European Alps, yet we are aware of the existence of additional datasets (such as in the private sector or public but not yet digitized) which unfortunately were not included in this analysis and whose inclusion would be beneficial for even more robust results.\n\nThe data consist of daily measurements of snow depth (HS) and depth of snowfall (HN). The largest part of the data is manual measurements. Some automatic measurements were included in the dataset provided for France. For a few sites in the Aosta Valley in Italy, manual series were merged with automatic series. This was done in order to extend up to the present some records that were dismissed at the beginning of the last decade, and this was performed in close communication with the operating office. While the observers follow slightly different guidelines in each country or network, the observation modalities are remarkably similar, thus allowing a combination of the different sources. For more detailed information on the measuring modalities, we refer to the European Snow Booklet (Haberkorn, 2019). Values of HS and HN were rounded to full centimetres. The further processing, quality checking, and gap filling are described in AppendixÂ A. For all the following statistical analyses, the processed and gap-filled data were used.\n\nThe fraction of stations used from the MeteoSwiss data is very low compared to the other networks. The MeteoSwiss data contain a large number of stations from the manual precipitation network which is not dedicated to snow. Many stations contain an important data gap for the 1981â1997 period that rendered a large fraction of the stations unusable for this study.\n\nThe homogenization of series, which is the removal of non-climatic parts in the time series, such as, for example, those caused by instrumentation changes or station relocations, is a standard practice in long-term temperature and precipitation records (Auer etÂ al., 2007). Applying the same tools to snow depth is not straightforward. There is an ongoing discussion on the appropriate homogeneity tests and suitable observation frequency, such as daily, monthly, or seasonally (Marcolini etÂ al., 2017a, 2019; SchÃ¶ner etÂ al., 2019). An analysis of a dataset with parallel snow measurements indicates that snow cover duration and maximum snow depth are amongst the indicators least affected by inhomogeneities (Buchmann etÂ al., 2021). Current research has tried to extend existing approaches with new innovations (Resch etÂ al., 2020). Homogenization could improve the robustness of estimated trends, and be especially useful for areas with sparse observations, such as for elevations above 2000âm. Given the large extent of our dataset, it was not possible to apply a common homogenization framework for our study, and we leave this for future studies.\n\nDownload\n\n2.4âRegionalization\n\nAn empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, also called principal component analysis (PCA), was conducted to determine the common modes of spatial variability. PCAs are widely employed in climatological studies to evaluate spatial modes of variability (Storch and Zwiers, 1999). They have been employed for meteorological records in the European Alps (Auer etÂ al., 2007) and also for snow variables (LÃ³pez-Moreno etÂ al., 2020; Scherrer and Appenzeller, 2006; SchÃ¶ner etÂ al., 2019; Valt and Cianfarra, 2010). For the PCA, we used daily quality-checked and gap-filled data. However, the gap filling was only employed when enough confidence in the filled value could be expected (see AppendixÂ A for a detailed description), so some of the series still had gaps. Because the aim of this regionalization was to have a large spatial coverage, we did not want to exclude series with only a few missing values. Consequently, we used a modification of the PCA algorithm that allows for the use of data with gaps to estimate the principal components (Taylor etÂ al., 2013).\n\nThe PCA was applied to the daily data from December to April for the hydrological years 1981 to 2010. The period was chosen because it is long enough to provide a climatological reference (30Â years), and it is the period that has the largest number of stations available. A hydrological year is defined here as starting in October, and it is designated as the calendar year of the ending month (e.g. December 1998 to April 1999 belong to the hydrological year 1999). Only those stations were selected that had at least 70â% of daily data available in this period. Each series was scaled to zero mean and unit variance before applying the PCA.\n\nIn order to identify spatially homogeneous regions within the Alpine domain, we performed a k-means clustering on the estimated PCA matrix. We tested configurations with two to eight clusters with the PCA matrix and with two to eight principal components (PCs) as input. We also applied k-means clustering directly on scaled daily observations of snow depth for comparison. To identify the best number of clusters, we used the âelbow methodâ, average silhouette coefficients, and visual interpretation. For the elbow method, the fraction of explained variance is plotted against the number of clusters, and the elbow of this curve is the point where the increase in explained variance becomes marginal. This is a semi-objective method because an elbow cannot always be clearly identified. The silhouette is a measure of how well an observation fits into its own cluster vs. the others. For an observationÂ i in clusterÂ Ci, the silhouette coefficient is 1-a(i)/b(i) if a(i)<b(i), b(i)/a(i)-1 if a(i)>b(i) and 0 if a(i)=b(i), where a(i)Â is the mean distance betweenÂ i and all other points in the same cluster, and b(i)Â is the smallest mean distance of observationÂ i to all other clusters. Specifically, a(i)=1|Ci|-1âjÏµCi,iâ jd(i,j) and b(i)=minkâ i1|Ck|âjÏµCkd(i,j) , where d(ij) is the Euclidean distance between observations.\n\nThe optimal number of clusters varied between two and five depending on the input (observations or PCA matrix) and depending on the metric (elbow in variance explained or average silhouette coefficients). Additional PCs only explained less than 2.6â% of the variance. After looking at the clustering results on maps (see Fig.Â S1 in the Supplement), all two to five clusters are meaningful. They simply highlight different aspects of the snow depth spatial variability, such as the gradients along elevation, northâsouth, and westâeast. Finally, five clusters based on the PCA matrix were chosen because they provide the best trade-off between the semi-objective metrics and the patterns expected from the climatic drivers.\n\n2.5âTrend analysis\n\nFor the trend analysis, monthly and seasonal indices were used which are indicative for different aspects and times of the snow season: monthly mean HS for November to May, mean winter HS (December to February, DJF), mean spring HS (March to May, MAM), mean seasonal HS (November to May), maximum HS from November to May (maxHS), early season snow cover duration (SCD, November to February), late season SCD (March to May), and full season SCD (November to May). SCD was the number of days with HS above 1âcm (Brown and Petkova, 2007). Indices were calculated from the quality-checked and gap-filled daily snow depth observations if more than 90â% of the daily values in the respective period were available. Trends of all indices were calculated for the period 1971 to 2019 for stations with complete data in the period. For the monthly mean HS analysis only, April and May series displaying mean HS less than 1âcm in all years were discarded because these are insignificant snow amounts which divert attention from the other sites; series of the other months at the site were still included. The number of series available for each snow variable differs; the largest number of series is available for the monthly mean HS, less for the half-seasonal (3 to 4 months) indices, and the fewest for the full-season indices.\n\nTrend analysis was performed using generalized least squares (GLS) regression. GLS was used because it allows for changes in the variance to be accounted for (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000). This was employed because the monthly snow depth series exhibited a change in the interannual variability, especially at the end of the season when monthly snow depths approached zero. The regression formula was yt=Î²0+Î²1t+Ïµt , where yt is the value of the respective snow variable in year t (centred such that year 1971 becomes year 0), Î²0 and Î²1 are the estimated regression coefficients, and Ïµt is the normally distributed errors with mean zero. GLS allows for the variance to depend on the yearÂ t with Var(Ïµt)=Ï2â exp(2â Î³â t) , where Î³Â is a coefficient to be estimated in the inference procedure that indicates the change in variance associated toÂ t. The GLS regressions for monthly mean HS showed a significantly improved goodness of fit (pâ<â0.05, likelihood ratio test) for 40â% of all cases and, specifically for November, April, and May, even for more than 60â% when compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) that assumes a constant error variance. The significance of trends was assessed using a 95â% confidence level. For the fraction of the variance explained by the trend, we used the RÂ squared statistic. To determine the magnitude of the interannual variability after accounting for the trend, we used the standard deviation (SD) of the model residuals.\n\nAn alternative for dealing with such heteroscedastic data is to use the robust nonparametric TheilâSen trend estimator with the MannâKendall test for significance assessment. We systematically evaluated the differences in the estimated trend magnitudes and trend significance of the TheilâSen approach vs. the GLS model and found only negligible differences (Fig.Â S13 and TableÂ S10 in the Supplement); the mean difference between trend estimates was 0.02âcm per decade, the correlation between trend estimates was 0.96, and the agreement of significance based on a pÂ value threshold of 0.05 was 86â%.\n\nThe SCD variables are bounded counts which can pose problems to the assumption of standard linear regression with normally distributed errors. This was only problematic for very low- and very high-elevation sites which display many SCD values at the minimum or maximum. For MAM, this concerns series below 500âm and above 2000âm, while for NovemberâFebruary (NDJF) and NovemberâMay (NDJFMAM), this is problematic below 250âm and above 2500âm. Instead, for such count data, a probability distribution such as negative binomial would be more appropriate (Venables and Ripley, 2002). Compared to the Poisson distribution, the negative binomial family accounts for overdispersion. We evaluated the differences in trend estimates and trend significance between the negative binomial linear model and the GLS model. Since the negative binomial linear model gives relative estimates of trends, these were transformed to absolute decadal trends for comparison. Again, differences were negligible on average (Fig.Â S13 and TableÂ S10). Consequently, we applied the GLS model for all snow variables.\n\n2.6âAir temperature and precipitation data\n\nIn order to study the relationship of snow depth with temperature and precipitation, we extracted temperature and precipitation series for each station from available gridded products. While gridded datasets clearly have some shortcomings, e.g. comparisons with point observations need a cautious interpretation (Salzmann and Mearns, 2011), their strength is the spatial and temporal coverage.\n\nTwo types of products were considered. The first is a reanalysis, and the second is an observation-based spatial analysis. For the reanalysis, we used temperature and precipitation from the MESCAN-SURFEX dataset (Bazile etÂ al., 2017) which was produced during the UERRA (Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional Reanalyses) project and which is available via the Copernicus Data Store (CDS). It covers the period from January 1961 to July 2019 on a 5.5âkm grid. Precipitation is available as total daily sum and temperature at 6âh intervals (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00âUTC). For the observation-based data, we chose E-OBS v20.0e for mean daily temperature (Cornes etÂ al., 2018) and the Alpine precipitation grid dataset (EURO4M-APGD) for total daily precipitation (Isotta etÂ al., 2014; Isotta and Frei, 2013). E-OBS v20.0e spans the period from January 1950 to July 2019 on a 0.1â grid. APGD covers the period from January 1971 to December 2008 on a 5âkm grid. It should be noted that the observation-based precipitation grids do not account for undercatch, which can lead to uncertainties at high elevations and in winter (Prein and Gobiet, 2017).\n\nIn order to assign grid cells to stations for temperature and precipitation, we selected those grid cells which contain the stations. Consequently, some nearby stations could have the same series of temperature and precipitation. The daily (or 6âh for temperature from MESCAN-SURFEX) series were aggregated to monthly means for temperature and monthly sums for precipitation.\n\nThe gridded products have a reference orography that, in complex mountain terrain, can differ significantly from the elevation of the point observation, thus, for example, introducing biases in temperature. Hence, temperatures were adjusted using a constant lapse rate of 6.5ââCkm-1 .\n\nMonthly temperature and precipitation can be considered largely independent from one month to the next, while snow cover is a cumulative process across the snow season. Because of this, seasonal comparisons were performed with average seasonal temperature and precipitation for winter (December to February), spring (March to May), and the whole snow season (November to May). The time period 1981 to 2010 was used, which had the densest station coverage. Climatological averages were computed for all seasons using the quality-checked and gap-filled snow depth data. Since EURO4M-APGD ends in 2008, the time period 1981 to 2008 was used for the observation-based products. The paper contains results from the comparison with the reanalysis product (MESCAN-SURFEX), and the results from the observation-based products are shown in the Supplement as a sensitivity analysis.\n\n3.1âRegionalization of daily snow depths 1981 to 2010\n\nThe PCA of daily snow depth series yielded five main modes of spatial variability which explained in total 84â% of the variance in the period December to April from 1981 to 2010 (Fig.Â 3). The first PC explained 54.3â% of the variance and distinguished between high- to middle- and low-elevation stations (approximate threshold 500â1000âm; Fig.Â 4). It explained the variability in snow depth for stations above 1000âm and was probably also partly linked to the permanence (or permanent absence) of snow cover, which is also why some low-elevation sites presented similar loading to the high sites (a PC loading can be considered the correlation of the original series with the principal component). The second PC explained 11.9â% of the variance and was also linked to elevation, but it captured the variability below 1000â1500âm (Fig.Â 4). Consequently, PC1 and PC2 together captured the variability across the whole elevation range. The third PC explained 8.1â% of the variance and separated the stations into north and south of the main ridge. The fourth PC explained 6.0â% of the variance and separated the stations into east from west. The fifth PC explained 3.7â% of the variance and separated the south-eastern and north-western stations from the rest.\n\nSome gradients in the PC loading map (Fig.Â 3) could give the impression that data artefacts between the different data providers exist, such as at the AustrianâGerman border in PC2 and PC5 or at the FrenchâItalian border in PC3-5. However, this is caused by the fact that the administrative borders in the Alps are tied to topography and thus closely located near elevational borders (Fig.Â 1a). A version of Fig.Â 3 subdivided by data provider highlights clearly that the gradients were not associated with the administrative borders (Fig.Â S2 in the Supplement).\n\nThe PCA loadings from the five PCs were used as input for a clustering algorithm (k means) which divided the stations into five clusters or regions (Fig.Â 5). This yielded three regions in the north: north-west (NW) with a median elevation of 472âm (minâmax: 30â1510âm), which contained stations from south-western Germany, north-western Switzerland, a few from France, and a few from eastern Austria; north-east (NE) with a median elevation of 515âm (215â1188âm), which contained stations from south-eastern Germany and northern Austria; and north and high Alpine with a median elevation of 1050âm (482â2970âm), which contained stations mainly located in France, Switzerland, and Austria but also includes the high-elevation sites in Germany, such as in the Black and Bavarian forests. Two regions emerged south of the main ridge: south and high Alpine with a median elevation of 1530âm (588â2735âm), which contained stations from the southern French Alps, almost all of Italy, a few in southern Switzerland, and some in southern Austria and eastern Slovenia; and south-east (SE) with a median elevation of 420âm (55â1300âm), which contained almost all stations from Slovenia and parts of eastern Austria.\n\nConsequently, clusters NW, NE, and SE contained lower-elevation sites, while north and high Alpine and south and high Alpine contained the higher elevations. The spatial coverage of the stations in this study included low-elevation sites for Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Slovenia but not for France and Italy where the available stations were mostly high-elevation sites. For future analysis, it would be interesting to include more low-elevation sites from France and Italy and see whether a third cluster would emerge (as in the north) because the division into south and high Alpine and SE is surely also caused by the different station elevations.\n\nThe results from the clustering were obtained automatically, and no manual post-processing or modification of the cluster assignments was performed. Additionally, the only input into the clustering algorithm was daily snow depth series, and no information on location or elevation was included. Given this absence of location information in the clustering process, the estimated modes of variability and the resulting regions were very homogenous in space. However, in the clustering, some stations seemed off, such as the few north-west stations around Lugano in Switzerland, northern Italy, and on the Adriatic coast in Slovenia, as well as the SE stations in France, Switzerland, and northern Italy. This was not related to the PCA algorithm used that allowed gaps in data since the results looked almost identical to a standard PCA (see Figs.Â S3 andÂ S4 in the Supplement), in which the clustering agreed in 98.5â% of the stations, and the same stations seemed mis-clustered. Instead, this might be related to special local climatic conditions affecting snow cover or to the fact that these stations did not have any similar neighbours in the estimated clusters. For example, the five stations in Ticino, located in Switzerland south of the main ridge, are low-elevation stations that had no correspondence in the south and high Alpine cluster which is comprised of middle to high elevations. Thus, the next best clusters were the SE and NW which, however, did not fit well; these sites and all other seemingly mis-clustered stations had low silhouette values (Fig.Â B1), which is a measure of how well a point matches its cluster compared to the others. Low silhouette values were also found along the borders of the different clusters, especially between NW and NE, which implies a smoother transition between NW and NE compared to the northâsouth boundary.\n\nThe estimated modes of variability in snow are similar to previous estimates on climatic subregions in the Alps, as identified in the HISTALP project (Auer etÂ al., 2007) and which are underlaid in Fig.Â 5. The HISTALP regions were based on temperature, precipitation, air pressure, sunshine and cloudiness, and the division into north, south, east, and west matches what we found for snow depth. Since the four regions were a compromise between all variables, they do not match perfectly to what we found for snow depth because the individual atmospheric variables exert different controls on surface snow cover. While the northâsouth boundary is almost identical in the central-western part, the eastern part has large mismatches. However, if the single element boundary for precipitation was considered as a main factor (cf. Fig.Â 8 from Auer etÂ al., 2007), then the agreement with snow depth would be almost perfect. This finding confirms a consistent picture of the Alpine climate in which snow depth is strongly related to precipitation and air temperature patterns.\n\nThe amount of the variance explained in the PCA with five PCs (84â%) might seem surprisingly high given that snow cover is hypothesized to have a high spatial and temporal variability. The value is higher than recent estimates for the Swiss Alps, where the first three PCs explained 78â% of the snow cover (Scherrer and Appenzeller, 2006), or for Austria and Switzerland, where the first three PCs explained 70â% of the snow cover (SchÃ¶ner etÂ al., 2019). However, since we included here more stations and also stations from regions with different climatic influences, such as south of the main ridge, an increase in the amount of the explained variance could be expected.\n\n3.3âLong-term trends for the period 1971 to 2019\n\nTrends of monthly mean snow depth from November to May were mainly negative with some exceptions (Fig.Â 7 and TableÂ 2). Over all stations and all months, 85â% of the trends were negative and 15â% positive; 23â% were significantly negative and 0â% (only four stationâmonth combinations) significantly positive (for significance, pÂ values had to be less than 0.05). The percentage of significant negative trends was substantially higher in the spring months (March to May) and at lower elevations irrespective of region, and it could reach 40â%â70â% (see also TableÂ 2).\n\nIn the low-elevation regions (NE, NW, SE), snow depth was decreasing much stronger in the SE than in the NE or NW across all months. The mean trend of December snow depth below 1000âm in the NE was â0.7âcm per decade (all further trends in the same unit) and â0.8 in the SE, while in January, it was â0.5 in the NW, â0.6 in the NE, and â1.6 in the SE (TableÂ 2). In February, NE stations even had an increasing snow depth at +0.8, while in the NW and SE it decreased. At middle elevations (1000 to 2000âm), differences between north and south were even stronger and variable in amplitude during the snow season; in December, the mean trend in north and high Alpine (N&hA) stations was more strongly negative (â1.9) compared to south and high Alpine (S&hA) stations (â0.8), but for January and February, we observe the opposite behaviour with a less pronounced negative trend in N&hA (â1.6 and â2.2) compared to S&hA (â3.9 and â5.1).\n\nIn the spring months of March and April, trends in snow depth were again more negative in the south than north. For example, at middle elevations (1000 to 2000âm), the mean March snow depth trend was â3.9 in N&hA compared to â7.0 in S&hA, in April â5.7 compared to â6.6, and in May â1.4 compared to â2.7. Notably, stations in S&hA above 2000âm exhibited strong variability in trends, and there were stations with increasing snow depth in all months (November to May). While mean trends were positive until January (November 2.7, December 4.0, January 0.0), mean trends were negative otherwise (February â1.9, March â2.6, April â8.3, May â9.5).\n\n3.4âInterannual variability from 1971 to 2019\n\nComplementing the trend analysis, this section presents an evaluation of the interannual variability in snow depth series. FigureÂ 8 highlights that mean snow depth exhibited a strong interannual variability in the analysed period. Because of the large number of stations, only time series that average over all stations in 500âm elevation bands are shown; however, individual station behaviour was well represented by the 500âm averages; see also auxiliary plots in the repository (Matiu etÂ al., 2020). In the 1970s and 1980s, high snow depths were observed, followed by a period of extreme low snow depth in the 1990s. Since the 1990s, snow depths in winter have partly recovered, while in spring, snow depths have continued to decline. At the end of the snow season and for lower elevations, average snow depths approached zero, such as in April for 500 to 1000âm or in May for 1000 to 1500âm. The different regions showed similar large-scale patterns, and, for example, the 1990s drop can be seen across the whole Alps. Particular years, especially extreme ones, show concurrent behaviour, for example February 1986 or 2009. Otherwise, there is mixed coherence across regions, as can also be seen from looking at standardized anomalies (Fig.Â B2) instead of raw snow depth.\n\nThese patterns are generally in line with those presented in previous studies which showed high snow amounts in the 1960s and 1980s and negative anomalies in the 1970s and 1990s, i.e. snow-scarce winters, regime shifts, or breakpoints in that period in France, Switzerland, Italy, and the western and southern part of Austria, and a recovery afterwards (Durand etÂ al., 2009; Laternser and Schneebeli, 2003; Mallucci etÂ al., 2019, 2019; Marcolini etÂ al., 2017b; Marty, 2008; Micheletti, 2008; Scherrer etÂ al., 2013; SchÃ¶ner etÂ al., 2019; Valt and Cianfarra, 2010). In an Alpine-wide view, this temporal variability is also accompanied by a strong regional variability.\n\nIn order to put the trends from Sect.Â 3.3 in the context of interannual variability, we examined their relationship by looking at the ratio between the 1971 to 2019 trend and the SD of residuals (Fig.Â B3a). This gives an indication of the relative contribution of the trend to interannual variability. The highest ratios were observed in November to January below 1000âm, in March between 500 and 2000âm, in April between 0 and 2500âm, and in May between 1500 and 2500âm.\n\nAs expected from the high temporal variability in the snow depth series, the fraction of explained variance from the linear trends was low. The average R2 over models with significant trends (pâ<â0.05) was 10â%. However, R2 increased with elevation and in the last months of the snow season reached up to 32â%.\n\nFrom Fig.Â 8, a decrease in the variability in the snow depth series can be observed, especially at the end of the season and for lower elevations. This is confirmed by the large fraction of negative time coefficients for the error variance in April and May (TableÂ B2) in which approximately 40â%â80â% of the stations presented significantly decreasing variability depending on the region. Notable decreases in variability were also observed in November and in January for the NE, NW, and SE. Considerable significant increases in variability, on the other hand, were only observed in December for 27â% of the south and high Alpine series.\n\n3.5âSeasonal snow indices of snow depth and snow cover duration\n\nIn addition to the analysis of monthly mean snow depth from Sects.Â 3.3 andÂ 3.4, this section gives a summary of trends in seasonal indices of mean and maximum snow depth, as well as snow cover duration (TablesÂ 3 and 4; AppendixÂ C). The results of seasonal mean HS agree with the monthly analysis and show generally decreasing snow depths in winter up to 2000âm and in spring for all elevations. Maximum snow depth across the whole season (November to May) decreased stronger than mean snow depth; e.g. the average trend of mean HS for stations in the north (N&hA, NE, NW) between 1000 and 2000âm was â2.8 and â5.2âcm per decade for maximum HS, which corresponds to â6.2 and â4.2â% per decade, respectively. Again, stations in the south (S&hA, SE) had more negative trends, e.g. â4.1âcm per decade for mean HS and â9.8âcm per decade for maximum HS for the same elevations (1000 to 2000âm), which corresponds to â8.9 and â7.1â% per decade, respectively. Average relative trends below 1000âm were more negative than average trends between 1000 and 2000âm for meanHS (DJF and NDJFMAM) and all SCD indices but not that obviously for meanHS in MAM and maxHS.\n\nSeasonal SCD also decreased for almost all stations below 2000âm, while above no consistent or significant changes were observed. The average trend in November to May SCD over all stations below 1000âm was â4.5âd per decade in the north and â4.8 in the south, and over all stations between 1000 and 2000âm, it was â5.3 in the north and â7.0 in the south, respectively. The fact that above 2000âm no changes in SCD were observed might also be caused by our season definition (November to May), which is not always enough to capture the full season above 2000âm. In terms of relative changes, mean HS decreased stronger than maximum HS in our study, which is consistent with previous findings (Bach etÂ al., 2018). However, in terms of absolute trends, the opposite was true for our study; mean HS decreased less than maximum HS. Another potential explanation for these differences might be the fact that the study period in Bach etÂ al. (2018) starts 20Â years earlier than in our study, and their maxHS trends are influences by some extreme events at the start of their study period.\n\nIn addition, our changes per decade for maximum HS and SCD are clearly smaller than the ones found by Klein etÂ al. (2016) for a similar time period but a smaller number of stations in Switzerland. We were able to reproduce the exact estimates from Klein etÂ al. (2016) for the same sites and hereby found that the differences were caused mostly by the different period (1970â2015 vs. 1971â2019), which makes sense since 1970 was a snow-abundant year, as were the years after 2015 compared to before 2015. In the case of SCD, the different season length (Klein etÂ al., 2016, used the whole year, and we used only November to May) also had an impact, especially for the higher-elevation sites. This supports our introductory statement on the challenge of synthesizing different studies and on the requirement of a unified analysis.\n\nA3âGap filling\n\nMost series contained gaps ranging from some days up to whole seasons. In order to conduct climatological or trend analyses, gaps in the series needed to be filled. For this, we employed a spatial interpolation approach which is similar to the one used for temperature and precipitation records (see, e.g., Brunetti etÂ al., 2006; Crespi etÂ al., 2018; Golzio etÂ al., 2018). The approach is based on correlations between the series, and because snow strongly depends on elevation, we first performed a spatial analysis to identify which correlations can be expected depending on horizontal and vertical distances between stations. For this, pairwise correlations (Pearson) between the daily HS series were performed for December to April from 1981 to 2010 only if the series had at least 70â% valid data and only if each pair had at least 50â% of data in common. As expected, correlations decreased with both horizontal and vertical distance (Fig.Â A1), but correlations remained high even for large distances; e.g. correlations higher than 0.7 were found for vertical distances of up to 500âm (with less than 100âkm horizontal distance) or horizontal distances of up to 200âkm (with less than 250âm vertical distance). It should be noted that correlations can be high even if there are large differences in amounts or ratios between the series as long as the differences and ratios are constant across the range of values.\n\nThe chosen approach fills a gap based on finding neighbouring series that are highly correlated to the one with gaps. The gap-filling algorithm works as follows for each gap.\n\nFind temporally surrounding non-missing values in the gap series around the gap date (âwindow dataâ); see also Fig.Â A2a.\n\n1.1.\n\nTake 15âd before and after the gap. This results in 31âd of the year; e.g. for 16Â January, this would be 1 to 31Â January and for 1Â January, this would be 16Â December to 17Â January.\n\n1.2.\n\nRepeat step 1.1 for 10Â years before and after the gap. This results in 21Â years; e.g. for 1996, this would be 1986 to 2006.\n\n1.3.\n\nThis window data potentially contains 651 values (21ââ â31) but likely has missing values. If there are more than 150 non-missing values, continue to stepÂ 2. If there are less than 150 non-missing values, increase the day window by 5âd in both directions, and repeat fromÂ 1.1. If the day window has reached 45 in one direction (i.e. a total of 91âd) and still there are less than 150 non-missing dates, stop. Note that only the day window is increased, the year window fromÂ 1.2 stays constant at 10Â years before and after.\n\nPre-select potential reference series (Fig.Â A2b) based on the following criteria: vertical distance to gap series is below 500âm, horizontal distance is below 200âkm, and the value at the date of the gap is not missing.\n\nFor each potential reference series, do the following.\n\n3.1.\n\nIdentify dates with values available for both gap and reference series in the window identified in stepÂ 1 (Fig.Â A2c). Continue only if more than 80â% of the minimum 150 non-missing values (i.e. 120) are available in common.\n\n3.2.\n\nFor the common dates, calculate mean of gap series and mean of reference series, and calculate correlation between gap series and reference series. If all values of gap and reference series are zero, set the correlation to the minimum threshold (see stepÂ 4) plus 0.001 (in order to be able to fill also zero periods). If only one of the series has all zero values, i.e. either gap or reference but not both, set the correlation to zero.\n\n3.3.\n\nCalculate ratio between mean of gap series divided by mean of reference series. If the mean of the reference series (divisor) is zero, set the ratio to zero (in order to be able to fill also zero periods).\n\nSort potential reference series by correlation with gap series (from stepÂ 3.1). Remove all candidates with a correlation below 0.7. This threshold was chosen as it is used, for example, in the homogenization of snow depth (Marcolini etÂ al., 2017a).\n\nSelect the first five best correlated reference series or up to five, depending on how many are available.\n\nCalculate weights based on vertical distance. The weights are based on exponential decay with a halving distance of 250âm (âhalf-timeâ transformation of decay constant). This implies that the weights are halved every 250âm.\n\nFill the gap value with a weighted (stepÂ 6) average of the reference series values adjusted by the ratios between gap and reference series (stepÂ 3.3): HStgap=1nâi=1nwiâ HStrefiâ HSmeangapHSmeanrefi , where tÂ is the date of the gap, iÂ is the index of the reference series, nÂ is the number of the reference series 1â¦5, and wiÂ are the weights with âiwiâ=â1.\n\nThe filled value was rounded to the nearest integer value in centimetres. Since the method requires finding suitable reference stations, it was only performed for the period 1961 to 2020 because the station density was too low before. The gap filling was applied to all gaps in all series considering all available data; afterwards, thresholds were applied to select usable series (see end of this section).\n\nThe chosen limits of 200âkm horizontal distance and 500âm vertical distance might seem very high in the Alpine context with the complex topography. Since we were interested in larger-scale snow patterns and not local snow peculiarities, such large distances are justified. Moreover, the correlation threshold should exert control on selecting only stations that share the same snow cover evolution, and high correlations were found up to these horizontal and vertical limits (Fig.Â A1). On the other hand, a nearby station might also be a worse predictor than a more distant one, if, for example, it differs in its local climate.\n\nSince this gap-filling approach has not yet been used for snow depth, we performed a cross-validation analysis to identify the gap-filling errors. For this, we used data from November to May from the period 1981 to 2010. For each station and each year, 1Â month at a time was held out but only if at least 10âd were available. Thus, for each month, a maximum potential of â¼â900 values were cross-validated; however, the effective number was lower because of missing values and because not all gaps could be filled if no suitable reference stations were available. In order to test the effect of shorter period gaps, we also applied the cross-validation to subsets (to reduce computation time): (1)Â 100Â random samples of 1âd and (2)Â 20Â random samples of 5Â consecutive days. Then, the held-out values were filled using the above approach, and metrics were calculated based on the filled and held-out values. Metrics include the bias, the MAE (mean absolute error), the MAE for non-zero held-out values only, and a modified version of relative MAE. The relative MAE is based on the MAE for non-zero values only, and this non-zero MAE is divided by the average of the held-out non-zero values. This is then not a âtrueâ relative error which would divide each error by the true value, i.e. 1nâi=1n|yi-xixi| , but our modification is 1nâi=1n|yi-xi||xÂ¯| , where xÂ¯ Â is the average of allÂ xi. This was done to remove the large influence of errors close to zero which are not that relevant in this case. The metrics were only calculated if more than 50Â values were available per month and station (out of potentially â¼â900 for the month-long gaps and 100 for the 1 and 5âd gaps) in order to provide robust estimates.\n\nThe cross-validation showed that the gap filling has extremely little bias (TableÂ A1), with the overall average daily bias for the month-long gaps being â0.04âcm. Average daily MAE for filling whole months was 1.6âcm (averaged over stations located at 0â1000âm), 7.7âcm (1000â2000âm), and 22.0âcm (2000â3000âm). MAE was lower for 1 and 5âd long gaps compared to month-long gaps, but almost no differences were observed comparing 1 or 5âd, e.g. for the 1000â2000âm band. MAE for 1âd gaps was 6.2âcm and for 5âd gaps 6.4âcm compared to 7.7âcm for 1Â month gaps. The relative MAE of month-long gaps decreased with elevation from 39.4â% (0â1000âm) to 32.7â% (1000â2000âm) to 22.8â% (2000â3000âm). Additionally, there was also a seasonal dependence of MAE, while the bias remained largely constant across the season (Fig.Â A3). MAE below 2000âm peaked in February, while above 2000âm, MAE increased throughout the season. Relative MAE decreased with higher snow depths both temporally and with elevation; that is, relative MAE was lowest in February and at high elevations. It is to be expected that errors at the end of the season are related to the ablation scheme (i.e. local climatic and topographic characteristics that influence ablation) of the different stations; however, at this stage, we did not check this issue further.\n\nMoreover, we compared our proposed gap-filling approach to results from gap-filling snow depth series using simulations of the Crocus snow model for the French Alps. The Crocus simulations with meteorological forcing were performed independently of this study, but we found it useful to compare the two approachesÂ â albeit only exploratively. The observed snow depths with gaps were assimilated into the Crocus modelling scheme using SAFRAN reanalysis data as forcing (LÃ³pez-Moreno etÂ al., 2020). The two gap-filling approaches were compared only for existing gaps in the French Alps. This was intended as a preliminary companion evaluation, and no cross-validation was performed. Thus, there was no ground truth to evaluate the two gap-filling approaches with formal metrics, and we only performed a visual assessment (figures for comparison available in Matiu etÂ al., 2020). Time series of both gap-filling procedures looked remarkably similar even for reconstructions of complete missing seasons; the different snowfall events were visible in both, and snow depths averaged over multiple days were comparable. Differences emerged in the snow settling behaviour and for the spring snow melting periods. More information on this exercise is available from the authors on request.\n\nFor Switzerland, a comparison of gap-filling methods for HS was performed which aimed at reconstructing complete missing seasons and which included regression-based methods and snow models (Aschauer etÂ al., 2020). While our proposed method was not explicitly used in that comparison, it can be assumed to be similar to the regression-based and distance-weighted methods used there. The errors reported in their study (root mean squared error less than 20âcm) are in the same order of magnitude as those found in our cross-validation.\n\nAltogether, the above-mentioned points (the cross-validation results, the comparison to Crocus, and the preliminary findings of the Swiss study) convinced us that the gap-filling procedure is also suitable for reconstructing whole seasons and not only some intermediate gaps, considering the fact that we only used it to derive monthly means (see below) and did not use the daily values directly. Further research would be required to check the suitability of the daily reconstructions, in our opinion, also considering the temporal distance to the last existing observations. For the final analysis, all gap-filled data within the recording period was used, and we also allowed the period to be extended by up toÂ 5 years before the start or after the end of the recordings â but only if the total number of gap-filled observations was less than the number of observations without gap filling. The main reason for this extension was to have series covering the complete period until 2019 because some series stopped just a few years earlier. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated most of the statistical analysis also for the original data without gap filling and provide results in the Supplement; the estimated modes of variability matched (Fig.Â S12 in the Supplement), the magnitude and variability in monthly trends were similar, although significantly fewer stations were available (Fig.Â S10 in the Supplement), and finally the time series of 500âm average HS also showed similar behaviour (Fig.Â S11 in the Supplement). The gap filling was able to significantly increase the temporal availability, but its aim was not to fill all gaps. Gaps were not filled, for example, if no suitable reference station was found or if not enough common data were available."
