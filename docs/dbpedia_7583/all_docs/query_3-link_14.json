        "text": "At CEREGE (Aix-en-Provence, France) a HVE 5 MV AMS facility has been put in operation for measuring the long-lived cosmogenic radioisotopes 10 Be, 26 Al, 36 Cl, 41 Ca and 129 I. Characteristic to the AMS system is that isobaric background can be suppressed by means of the nuclear charge dependent energy loss in an absorber foil and subsequent energy selection by an electrostatic deflector. In case of 36 Cl analysis, this method suppresses 36 S by a factor of at least 200. As a consequence, high source output does not overload the detector by isobaric interference. Together with the high- resolution gas ionisation detector 36 Cl measurements at an energy as low as 30 MeV are supported. This can be readily achieved by gas stripping at 5 MV terminal voltage, thereby avoiding the use of cumbersome foil stripping. The performance of the AMS system is reviewed. 36 Cl/Cl ratios down to 410 -16 have been measured.\n\nThe suppression of interferences from atomic and molecular isobars is a key requirement for the extension of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to the analysis of new cosmogenic isotopes and for increasing the range of applications for small AMS systems. In earlier work, it was shown that unwanted isobars can be eliminated by anion-gas reactions (Litherland et al. 2007). Recently, a prototype system in which such reactions could be applied to ions from an AMS ion source, the Isobar Separator for Anions (ISA), was described (Eliades et al. 2009). This system decelerates the beam of rare anions from keV to eV energies, guides them through a single radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) gas cell, and re-accelerates them for further analysis in a 2.5MV AMS system. Tests of this system with Cl and S anions and NO2 gas showed a suppression of S with respect to Cl of over 6 orders of magnitude, with a transmission of ~30% for the Cl beam. In this work, results of the analysis of a range of stand..."
