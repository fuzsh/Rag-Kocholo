        "text": "You can file a joint application (also known as divorce by mutual consent) which includes:\n\nA written petition (letter or pre-printed form) signed by both spouses stating you want to divorce. You do not need to explain your reasons for wanting a divorce.\n\nA document specifying all the consequences of the divorce on which you have agreed (agreement on how to deal with the consequences of the divorce): liquidation of the marriage, distribution of the pension fund, child custody, maintenance payments, division of property, etc.\n\nThe court may also request other documents.\n\nAt the end of the procedure, the court grants the divorce and decides what the consequences will be for the two former spouses and the children. The court generally adopts the proposals made in the divorce agreement unless there are inconsistencies (if, for example, in haste, one spouse unwittingly gives up their pension claims acquired during the marriage) or if a provision is contrary to the interests of the children (if, for example, one spouse gives up their ex-spouseâs child support in order to have sole custody).\n\nYou can ask for a divorce even if your spouse does not agree, provided that you have lived separately for at least two years.\n\nIn exceptional cases, including domestic violence, you can also ask for a divorce before the two years have expired.\n\nThe court will inform you of the documents you need to submit. At the end of the procedure, the court grants the divorce and decides all the consequences, taking into account any points on which you and your spouse have been able to agree.\n\nThe duration of the divorce procedure varies. If you and your spouse agree on all the consequences of the divorce, the procedure generally takes three to four months. If, however, you are in dispute over one or more of the consequences of the divorce, the procedure can take up to several years."
