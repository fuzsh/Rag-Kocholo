But if you are someone who want to understand about the old times and want to enjoy the best traditional switzerlander food, then yes Zurich is the first place that you should explore since most major international carrier also fly via Zurich right? Zurich is separated by the old town and new town and you will know the difference with the cobblestone and the houses along the streets and by the water have the medieval architecture. Also do remember to visit the love lock bridge at muhlesteg which stretches across the Seine River where you will see many padlocks hang on the bridge railings to symbolise like locking if love for couples. Also all around Zurich, you will find many restaurants here serving traditional food like rosti, cheese fondues and amazing desserts but just a warning, eating out in Switzerland isn't gonna be cheap! #celebratewithtrip #switzerland #europe #zurich #oldtown #medieval #educational #historical"
