Many Swiss customs and traditions are unique to the country, from its folk music and alpine life to watchmaking expertise.\n\nSwiss music Perhaps the country's most famous musical instrument, the alphorn is quintessentially Swiss. Thanks to folklore and tourism, the rarely-used horn has received a recent revival to become a symbol of the country. Yodelling is another typically-Swiss style of music, originating from the need to call from mountain-to-mountain. This instantly recognisable type of singing is known the world over.\n\nSwiss watchmaking Swiss watches are renowned for their precise movements and intricate mechanical workings. The industry hit its stride in the 19th century and the country is home to famous watchmakers, including Rolex, Patek Phillip and TAG Heuer.\n\nLife on the Alp Alpine farming is thought to reach way back to 4,000 BC. Living on the pastures above the treeline has given birth to many a Swiss custom. Alpine cheese, a delicious treat unique to the country, is made from the milk of sheep, cows or goats that graze on the pastures of the Alps. The world-famous Heidi books written by Johnna Spyri helped to romanticise this idyllic, natural life.\n\nSwiss sports You may not have heard of them, but there are a few sports found only in Switzerland. Schwingen, Swiss wrestling, started as a way for herdsmen to pass the time. Now there are national Schwingen festivals where would-be champions test their might. Flag throwing is another traditional Swiss sport, typically accompanied by folk music at festivals. Starting as a tradition, there are now competitions for the title of the finest flag thrower. Hornussen looks like a combination of golf and baseball, but it's much more than that. Its history reaches back to the 16th century, originating as a way to get rid of spirits by hitting burning logs down into the valley. In the modern sport, two teams play against each other with wagers often being placed on the outcome by fans and players alike.\n\nSwiss traditions and culture\n\nSwitzerland is filled with amazing culture.
