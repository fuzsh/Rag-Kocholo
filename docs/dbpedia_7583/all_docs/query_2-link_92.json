        "text": "In Switzerland, a distinction is made between maintenance payments owed to a spouse and those owed to children. Children are entitled to parental support until they reach the age of 18 or complete a suitable education, while former spouses can only claim maintenance if the marriage had a “formative effect” (lebensprägend) on the spouse’s way of life. Courts decide this on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Federal Court has clarified important questions concerning maintenance law with a number of landmark rulings in 2020 and 2021, which in some cases changed previous practice: a marriage is no longer automatically considered to have had a formative impact on life if children were born of the marriage, the marriage lasted more than ten years or a spouse who is not gainfully employed reaches the age of 45.\n\nChild support is made up of financial and childcare allowance. The parent who is personally looking after a child can provide their share of maintenance as “support in kind,” while the other parent will pay a larger share of the financial support or even the full amount.\n\n“Marriage is no longer a life insurance policy for women,” announced the Swiss media in spring 2021, referring to recent decisions made by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court relating to alimony payments for divorcees.\n\nMaintenance payments, also called alimony, provide financial security for your spouse and children should you get divorced. When is there a claim to post-marital maintenance? When is there a claim to child maintenance? How high is a possible claim and how do recent rulings of the Federal Supreme Court affect the alimony claim for the spouse?\n\nThis article addresses precisely these questions.\n\nIn principle, the primacy of self-sufficiency applies. This basically means that spouses must provide for their own maintenance after divorce. Nevertheless, if a marriage is ruled as having had a formative effect on the spouse’s way of life, post-marital maintenance may be owed.\n\nBut what does formative effect mean? According to new case law, a marriage can be considered as having had a formative effect on a spouse’s life if, among other things, the spouse was not able to be financially independent during the marriage due to responsibilities associated with childcare or with running a joint household and, after the divorce, this person is no longer able to earn their own income or provide adequately for retirement – whether because of ongoing childcare duties or because they were absent from the labor market for too long. The competent court examines whether post-marital maintenance is owed against the background of the particular circumstances of the individual case.\n\nWhat, until now, have the criteria been for assessing whether a marriage had a formative effect on the spouse’s way of life?\n\nPrior to the recent change in federal court rulings on alimony law, the question of whether a marriage had a formative effect was answered according to the following principles:\n\nIf a person was not employed during the marriage and dependent on the spouse's income, and had reached the age of 45 at the time of divorce, this person was not expected to re-enter working life and was accordingly entitled to post-marital maintenance.\n\nIf the marriage lasted more than ten years or if children were born of the marriage (irrespective of the duration of the marriage), a claim to retain the previous marital standard of living was affirmed.\n\nUntil now, there has been no consistent method throughout Switzerland for calculating alimony payments, as this was partly dependent on different cantonal requirements.\n\nWhat has changed with respect to spousal support since November 2020?\n\nAs mentioned above, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court has introduced a series of successive decrees intended to modernize family law. Divorced spouses will thus be increasingly responsible for financing their own living expenses.\n\nWhile some decisions will continue to be made on a case-by-case basis, the court has specified that greater deliberation is now required before a marriage can be considered as having had a formative effect on life. The following was decided:\n\nThe meaning of the “age 45 rule” is changing. According to case law, it can now be assumed in principle that taking up or extending gainful employment is still reasonable even for spouses over 45 years of age.\n\nA marriage that has lasted 10 years or more is no longer automatically considered to have had a formative impact on life.\n\nEven if the couple has had one or more children together, this no longer automatically qualifies the marriage as having had a formative effect.\n\nAccording to the new legislation, a marriage can be viewed as having had a formative effect on life if one spouse has given up financial independence to provide for the household and look after the children, and can no longer return to their former occupation. But even then, the duration of the maintenance payment is suitably limited, and taking up gainful employment may still be reasonable even at an advanced age.\n\nIn principle, children have a right to support, regardless of their parents’ marital status. This applies until they are either of legal age or complete a degree or an apprenticeship, enabling them to begin employment.\n\nIf parents divorce, the question arises as to who is responsible for child support, to what degree, and how much the payments be."
