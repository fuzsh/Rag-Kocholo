This industrial plot of about 24.600 square meters meets the criteria. The disadvantage of the relatively small extent is the advantage of the great exploitability (about 370.000 cubic meters above-ground volume) compared. A railway connection proved in the end to be unrealizable.\n\nThe original function\n\nThey produced: milk, milk drinks, yogurt, kefir, cream, ice-cream, cream for coffee and milk powder.\n\nThe Milk intake and the main milk storage are located at or between the two processing trays. From the high-level main milk storage, the milk flows to the processing plants upstairs, the same applies to the components that come from the mixer to the yoghurt and ice-cream factory. The returned bottles are washed in the basement and fed to the bottling lines on the ground floor using vertical conveyors. The conditioned finished goods warehouses with their staging areas form the northern building head. The factory occupied around 350 employees. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nThe 230 m long and 117 m wide building was divided into 4 main sections:\n\nramp construction\n\ncold storage rack\n\nfabrication tract\n\ndrying and boiler house\n\nCurrent function\n\nToday, the conversion and construction of the former milk processing plant is managed by a university building for around 5.000 students, with rooms for fixed and temporary exhibitions as well as 100 rental apartments. The project comprises an 8-storey main building and a 22-storey building. The school building is used for Zurich University of Applied Sciences and Zurich University of Arts.\n\nTime of construction\n\nThey started to construct the building in September 1972. After a construction period of almost 5 years, the Toni dairy officially opened on 5 May 1977.\n\nAuthors\n\nFirst phase of construction (1975)\n\nArchitects: André E. Bosshard, Dipl.

At the end of the 19th century dairies or dairy cooperatives established milk centres near towns or cities. They covered the increasing demand of the cities for milk and helped absorb seasonal fluctuations in production and consumption.\n\nDuring the First World War, when milk became scarce, the federal government transferred responsibility to the regional milk associations (sections of the later Swiss milk producers) for supplying the population with drinking milk.\n\nAfter the war, they also took control and improved milk quality and built large dairies. The pasteurization of milk developed in 1949 and its low-cost sale in standard disposable packaging made that Drinking milk business interesting for supermarkets such as Migros and Coop. Large buildings such as the Toni Dairy Zurich or the new dairy in Ostermundigen were built. New yogurt brands like “Toni”, “Säntis” or “Emmi” gave the dairies profile, but also led to increased mutual competition. In the 1990s, the dairies expanded their palette with aesthetic and biotechnology-engineered lifestyle products to increase added value and recoup investment. Through mergers and specializations were simultaneously the production costs of the farms lowered.\n\nIn 1998, for example, the association of the dairies Bern, Basel, Vaud-Freiburg and Winterthur (ToniLait AG) with Appenzell-St. Gallen (Säntis Group) to Swiss Dairy Food AG (2002 liquidation and partial integration into the Emmi group). The structural change accelerated with the agrarian reforms in the 1990s: the former Association dairies became independent growth and profit-oriented companies, urged low milk prices and prevailed mostly. This pressure should coincide with the further integration of Switzerland into the European market and the intensification of international competition. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nHistory of the Zurich Dairy Association\n\nThe Zurich “Sennereiverband”, as a forerunner of the Dairy Association, organized a general day of milk on March 26, 1905 at the Casino in Winterthur. With a presentation at the rally, a fundamental wave should be raised in favour of the idea of ​​streamlining the dairy industry. On 1 October of the same year, the dairy association was already founded. Very soon it was realized that a long-term breakthrough is only possible if the association itself buys milk, builds dairies and trades and thus actively intervenes in the market.\n\nThe first dairy with an association office was set up in the leased premises of a brewery in Winterthur.\n\nIn 1917, the Assembly of Delegates approved the purchase of a building site in Winterthur, where, after overcoming war-related obstacles in 1921, the first dairy construction could be obtained. At the same time, solutions had to be sought in the city of Zurich. Because of the unclear station conditions, the association acquired two properties on the military road and set up these only provisionally. On October 1, 1919, the dairy was opened. The development, however, required rapid expansion of extensions to ensure the supply of milk to the growing city. The provisional became a permanent solution. More milk storage facilities, larger handling capacity, a large-scale grocery store, cold stores, and ice cream fabrication facilities under the FIRN brand in 1925 required space and new technical facilities.\n\nBut with that the tasks of the association were not exhausted. Through war economy measures he had to supply and regulate the city of Chur and the health resorts of Graubünden with milk. Thus, at the request of the Bünder authorities, another modern city dairy was built in Chur, which in 1921 began its purpose. 1931, the purchase of a property in Schaffhausen, in which a dairy was set up. This was followed by the expansion of a milk and butter center in Glarus and a first extension in Winterthur. New operating branches were taken over in 1938 with soft and box cheese production and in 1941 with the milk regulation and drying plant in Uster. These are just the most important stages of an almost stormy development, which can be traced back to successful activity, ever-increasing milk production and population growth.\n\nThree key facts forced the cooperative to make a big decision:\n\nThe Trockenwerk Uster and the Verbansmolkerei Zürich have developed from temporary to large-scale operations that no longer meet the hygienic and operational requirements.\n\nThe sharp increase in milk production inevitably led to ever greater capacity for raw milk intake, storage, fabrication and the balancing of weekend and seasonal peaks.\n\nThe official demands for reducing the guest worker’s share of the total workforce could only be achieved by automation. This in turn had to stand for reasons of congestion to the best possible concentration of investments.\n\nThese facts were already recognized. They prompted the management to do extensive preparatory work. Successful negotiations were held with the city authorities, which through a bartering process brought in the property on which Toni-Dairy Zurich stands today. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nHistory of the construction site\n\nOn May 11, 1924, the Förrlibuck stadium was first used by the Zurich football club Young Fellows.\n\nThe football stadium Förrlibuck, which in the meantime was taken over by the city of Zurich, fell victim to the construction of the Hardturm Viaduct, which is the extension of the Käferberg tunnel connects with the main station, Oerlikon and the station Altstetten. Through a land exchange with various properties at the military and Lagerstrasse acquired the Milchverband Winterthur from the city of Zurich between the railway viaduct and the Duttweilerstrasse located plot.\n\nAnd then as already written, in September 1972, the construction of the factory, which was designed to produce up to 1.000.000 l of milk per day, started.\n\nSummary of historical information\n\n1964 The Verbandsmolkerei Zürich acquires the area from the city of Zurich September1972 Start of construction of the Toni dairy May 1977 official opening of the Toni Dairy 1982 Introduction of the «Toni-glass» 1999 End of milk processing in the Toni Dairy 2000 – 2008 Cultural and commercial interim uses in the Toni areal 2003 A private design plan is provided by the Zurich local council approves and lays the foundation for the future possible uses 2005 The Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB) acquires the Toni dairy the bankrupt estate of Swiss Dairy Food May 2005 The government council publishes the location strategy for the Zurich universities 2005 Feasibility study for use by the universities 2005 – 2006 Project competition among seven general planners.

By bundling the reinforcement on strips of 1m in both directions, the client was left open to carry out ceiling openings of 1,5 m x 1,5 m in a fixed grid system. The main storey ceilings for 2 t/m2 payload are 52 cm thick. For the columns were used forged steel columns with round solid cross section (1700t load) used. They are designed as pendulum rods with articulated storage. The largest executed length is 7,36 m, the weight of a support is accordingly 10,3 t. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nTrockenwerk\n\nWith a height of 46 m from the upper edge of the floor slab it towers over the fabrication tract by 23 m.\n\nOn the first floor it is three-aisled with a length of 38m and a width of 56m. All other projectiles are constructed with a length of 26.5m with two naves. The storey heights are adapted to the special requirements of the operating equipment and therefore variable, with two main storey ceilings passing through from the factory floor. Because of the large concentrated individual loads (silos up to 180t) and the partially ceiling-field-sized recesses as a result of the silos penetrating several storeys, the flat-roof system was not suitable here.\n\nThe choice was a reinforced concrete frame construction with suspended ceilings. The structure consists of 11 6-storey frames, 2-perspektive 3 ships with wingspan of 12,2 / 12,65 / 12,2 m and frame distance of 5m.\n\nIn the area of ​​the lower driveway, a frame with 3m high transverse beams had to be intercepted. The horizontal wind and earthquake forces were introduced into the stair tower and windshield via 3 mostly continuous beam ceilings. Due to the frequent failure of beams due to large recesses resulted in free column heights up to 23 m. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nAccess ramp\n\nThe access ramp enables direct loading from the loading platform in the second main floor to the entire width of the front of the cold storage section for trucks with a total weight of up to 28 tons as well as the roof level for cars and trucks of up to 16 tons.\n\nThe lower ramp is for the most part connected to the pillars in a sturdy way. For those columns that are far from the fixed point, slide bearings were installed between the column head and the lower ramp.\n\nThe bridge superstructure of the upper and lower ramp, constructed in prestressed concrete, as well as the traffic level in front of the front facade of the cold storage section, is stretched 20 to 30 meters. Structurally, the lower and upper ramps are a spatially curved bar structure, while the transitional areas of the ramps to the middle traffic level represent a tensile structure.\n\nThe total length of the bridge is 285 m measured in the hard axis, the bridge area 2578 square meters. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nBuilding material, structure\n\nThe versatile program on the one hand and the available, relatively scarce property on the other hand led to a multi-storey compact solution (almost everything in one block).\n\nBuilding heights\n\nDue to the upper limit of a maximum of 20 m below the lower limit by the groundwater level, a three-storey division was chosen for the dairy tract. The storey height of 7,80 m allowed the installation of suspended prefabricated galleries, which on the one hand showed pedestrian passages separated from the operation and on the other hand the energy-product distribution in the 70-80 m wide working areas. Where the original floor height of 7,80 m was too large, the volume of construction was doubled by the insertion of a mezzanine (for example, in the laboratories, the administration and the cheese store).\n\nBuilding grid\n\nFor the dairy tract, a column grid of 10 x 10 m was chosen; the same was converted to 5 x 10 m in the main milk storage area and set to 5 x 12,5 m in the dry storage area. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nFoundation\n\nUnder soft surface layers lies in 1 – 4 m depth the low terrace rock of the Limmat-valley with 16 to 30 m strength, in which the building is substantiated.\n\nThe building runs in the groundwater flow of the Limmat-valley, whose level varies by about 3,4 m. (396 to 397 meters above sea level).\n\nThey had chosen a flat foundation with continuous bottom plate. Depending on building loads and support system, their thickness is 60 cm to 190 cm. The bottom plate with the end walls and retaining walls forms a so-called rigid insulation. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nFlooring\n\nThe mechanical stress caused by stackers, cans, the high point loads caused by large containers, the contact with water, steam, lactic acid and cleaning fluids places high demands on the floor structure.\n\nAll floors are designed with a slope. Most floor coverings which were not definitely lactic acid-endangered were made in reinforced concrete.\n\nTo shorten the drying time, vacuum concrete was chosen with good success, which could be completed in one operation. He brought thus the advantage of smaller construction strength and the saving of a work process. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nOutside walls / facade\n\nThe alu-trapezoidal sheet, mounted on horizontal steel wire, forms through continuous weather protection, regardless of the movement of the building. The metal surface in the untreated material is also low maintenance, self-cleaning and symbolizes the cleanliness of the food business. At the boiler house and the main milk storage this is at the same time the outer skin, at the drying plant a back-ventilated brick wall is added, again this two-layered solution in the manufacturing and cooling tract is supplemented by appropriate heat insulation. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nRoof with drivable surface\n\nFor the “normal” problem definition of a flat roof, the criterion of passability for PW and partly for trucks up to 16 t has been added.\n\nSince the load-bearing ceiling had to be packed both below (vapor barrier) and above (water insulation), it was created without a coating in vacuum concrete. To prevent water drains in the freezer area (about 3000 m2), the whole ceiling was tilted slightly (1%).\n\nThe waterproof skin was sealed in fields of 10 x 10 meters to locate later leaks. (Milchverband Winterthur 1977)\n\nTechnological facilities\n\nBecause of the use of the building it was full of technological facilities. First of all there is the massive ramp on the shorter side of the building. In the building itself were many machines, tanks and storages for producing vaper or store fresh water.\n\nThere was also a huge chimney, in front of the south façade of the building, but during the renovation it was demolished.\n\nGeneral condition and maintenance\n\nToday, because of the renovation, the structure is in a good condition. However, the condition of the construction was good before they even started the new project. The building wasn’t that old at all and overall they used new and stable materials.\n\nPhotos\n\nPlans\n\nGround floor plans\n\nSections\n\nRebuilding stages\n\n1977 – 2000: production of dairy\n\n2005 – 2009: cultural temporary use (clubs, music festivals, beach volleyball, skating)\n\nSince 2009: school building (university)\n\nBecause the factory building is only 43 years old, there was only one rebuilding stage.\n\nWhen the Toni factory was put into operation in 1977, it was considered the most modern dairy in Europe. Only 22 years later, it was closed due to overcapacity, and the facilities were sold to Eastern Europe. The company Swiss Dairy Food subsequently went bankrupt and the Bank of Zurich acquired the property in 2005. An appraisal revealed that a demolition would not have made sense. The Zurich City Council’s statement on the design plan for a change of use also confirmed this: the Toni site was rated as an anchor for the booming Zurich West, and its industrial appearance and volumetric of high-rise and low-rise buildings, ramps and robust supporting structures would have to be recognizable in the future stay.\n\nThe canton of Zurich commissioned a feasibility study to house part of its colleges. Before this was implemented in 2007, they wrote a study competition for the Toni-Areal, which was carried out in 2005/2006 and won by Zurich architects EM2N.\n\nAt the end of January 2009, Allreal started with demolition and rebuilding. After demolition of the round, 70 meters high industrial chimney was the adjacent to the Pfingstweidstrasse building supplemented by an extension and ten storeys increased. The main building became intermediate floors and five big, terraced atriums. These supply the inside rooms with daylight and will – as well as the roof garden – used as break and meeting zones. In addition, the whole building received a new facade. The new Toni area has around 2,400 rooms. Of these, around 2,000 rooms with different uses are attributable to the two universities of applied sciences alone. After successful completion of all necessary tests and controls, the first tenants moved into the residential buildings in April 2014 and at the end of April 2014 the canton took over their space.
