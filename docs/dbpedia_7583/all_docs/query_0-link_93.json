        "text": "Introduction\n\nWith increasing concerns about climate change, estimating the adaptive potential of forest trees has high societal and economic relevance. The capacity of many forest tree species to survive and reproduce across a broad geographical range is, at least partly, due to adaptation to local conditions (e.g. Aitken et al., 2008; Franks et al., 2014). There is growing evidence that adaptation can be important for enabling populations to persist under changing conditions, including climate change (Hoffmann & Sgrò, 2011). However, many populations are increasingly exposed to novel environmental conditions that are beyond the range to which they are adapted and/or outside of their physiological tolerance (Shaw & Etterson, 2012), and it is unclear how commonly and rapidly adaptations or plastic responses would arise in order to keep up with climate change (e.g. Franks et al., 2014).\n\nMany forest tree species have distribution ranges that expand over large geographic regions, which is, at least in the Northern Hemisphere, a result of recent population expansions after the Last Glacial Maximum (Hampe & Jump, 2011). Given the large effective population sizes, predominant outcrossing mode of reproduction, and moderate to high levels of genetic diversity, forest tree species have been able to adapt to local conditions, as reflected by ample empirical evidence of trait divergence patterns that are congruent with latitudinal and altitudinal climatic gradients (Savolainen et al., 2007; Alberto et al., 2013). However, since many of these gradients also coincide with recent population expansion, it can be difficult to tease apart neutral and selective processes underlying trait variation (e.g. Yeaman et al., 2016).\n\nAttempts to identify adaptive trait differentiation in forest trees have often relied on the long tradition of provenance trials, in which different populations from across the geographic range are tested in a common environment. Phenotypic data is often exploited using so-called QST – FST tests, which compare quantitative trait differentiation (QST) with genetic divergence inferred from neutral markers (FST) (Whitlock, 2008; Whitlock & Guillaume, 2009). A recent literature survey of forest trees suggests that most tree traits exhibit considerable heritable trait variation and that QST most often (69% of the studies)exceeds FST (Lind et al., 2018). However, a simple comparison between QST and FST has many shortcomings that have been criticized (e.g. reviewed in Leinonen et al. (2013)), and alternative solutions have been suggested (Chenoweth & Blows, 2008; Martin et al., 2008; Ovaskainen et al., 2011). The fundamental issue is that both QST and FST are random variables, i.e. the observed values are just a single realization of the evolutionary process. Even though Whitlock & Guillaume (2009) proposed an improved QST – FST test where QST is compared to a simulated distribution of FST, this test still does not fully account for the demographic relationships among the populations, because it is reduced to a single summary of the data, the FST. Further, the QST – FST test may also give misleading results because each trait is considered in isolation, and the signature of adaptive trait differentiation can be the result of selection at another trait if they are genetically correlated (e.g. Chenoweth & Blows, 2008). Ovaskainen et al. (2011) proposed an alternative method, which uses a statistically more powerful null hypothesis than the QST – FST tests: it accounts for drift distances among all populations (i.e. the coancestry matrix) to derive the null expectation of trait divergence. So far, however, only a handful of applications of this method have been published (e.g. De Kort et al., 2016).\n\nHere, we assess adaptive divergence at size, growth and phenology traits in silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), an ecologically and economically important European forest tree species. Indeed, recent dendrological (Vitali et al., 2017) and genecological (Frank et al., 2017a) evidence suggests silver fir to potentially be better adapted to future climatic conditions, notably to drought, than the other dominant conifer of European forests, Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.), which often co-occurs with silver fir. In this study, we concentrate on populations from ecologically diverse sites across Switzerland, including populations from core ranges (Pre-Alps, Central Plateau and Jura Mountains), but also marginal populations isolated by high mountain ranges. These alpine populations encompass the wet outer Alpine chain to the dry Central Alps across diverse soil types (Ellenberg, 1988). Silver fir populations in Switzerland are rather young, palynological and dynamic vegetation modeling suggest that the Swiss Alps were colonized by silver fir from south to north after the Last Glacial Maximum. The species most likely reached the southern slopes of the Alps between 10 and 9 kyr BP and the northern slopes between 8 and 5 kyr BP (Van der Knaap et al., 2005; Liepelt et al., 2009; Ruosch et al., 2016). Range-wide patterns of chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA variation (Liepelt et al., 2002) and isozyme data (Burga & Hussendörfer, 2001) from extant silver fir populations suggest that the Swiss Alps were colonized from a single ancestral refugial population situated in the Central and/or Northern Apennines, even though the potential contribution of eastern refugial populations cannot be excluded.\n\nThe potential for adaption can be the greatest in isolated populations and poor environmental conditions, however, gene flow from the core areas can easily counteract selection (Lenormand, 2002). Many other wind-pollinated conifer species have high levels of pollen-mediated gene flow (Petit & Hampe, 2006; Kremer et al., 2012). Thus, regardless of the heterogeneous environment across Switzerland, little adaptive trait differentiation is expected among the studied populations. Indeed, results of a large-scale common-garden experiment involving seedlings from 90 silver fir populations across Switzerland show that levels of population divergence are rather low, particularly when compared to those of Norway spruce from the same area (Frank et al., 2017b). For example, population divergence(QST) in seedling height for silver fir was 0.22 and in phenological traits ≤ 0.11. Nevertheless, Frank et al. (2017b) also found that QST values of these traits are much higher than population differentiation at isozyme loci (FST = 0.034) in a similar set of populations (Finkeldey et al., 2000) and speculated that population divergence might reflect adaptation to local environmental conditions. A further evidence for possible adaptation was that population differentiation in seedling height showed a regional pattern, i.e. seedlings from the Central Plateau were taller than those from the Alps, and environmental variables explained a large proportion of the trait differentiation (49%) (Frank et al., 2017b).\n\nHere, we revisit the phenotypic data obtained by Frank et al. (2017b) for a subset of 19 populations, complement it with modern genetic data, and assess to what extent the observed trait differentiation is due to selection. The goal of this study is three-fold. First, we test for adaptive trait divergence using the multi-trait test developed by Ovaskainen et al. (2011), thus we account for the full demography in devising the null expectation for trait divergence. Since, we have data from a relatively large number of populations and from a highly heterogeneous environment separated by potential barriers to gene flow, accounting for the likely complex and hierarchical population structure is essential. Further, the studied set of size, growth and phenology traits most likely do not evolve independently, thus the multi-trait approach is highly desirable to identify any correlated responses to selection. Second, we develop a set of downscaled historical climate variables and adopt soil data from Frank et al. (2017b) to test which one of them drives the adaptive divergence patterns using the methodology described in Karhunen et al. (2014). Third, we wish to advocate the methodology developed herein to leverage information that can be obtained from a common-garden trial for testing hypothesis about adaptive evolution. In particular, we contrast our results with the simple QST – FST, and propose two methodological improvements to evaluate the signature of selection in each population and a more powerful version of the H-test proposed by Karhunen et al. (2014).\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nStudy sites and sampling\n\nIn 2009, 90 silver fir stands were selected across Switzerland in the framework of a genecological study (Frank et al., 2017b). From each population, three mother trees were selected from an area with a relief as uniform as possible and with at least 100m distance between them. From this study, we selected a subset of 19 presumably allochthonous populations that represented the main geographic regions of Switzerland (Figure 1A), and re-visited them in 2013 and 2016. In spring 2013, needles were sampled from nine to ten adult trees, including the three mother trees, if they were found. In spring 2016, needles were sampled from an additional ten to twelve trees, always respecting a minimum distance of 100m between the newly or previously sampled trees. In total, 387 adult trees were used in this study, with at least 20 individuals per population. Needles were stored in plastic bags for a maximum of one week at 5°C before being freeze-dried and prepared for DNA extraction.\n\nGenetic data\n\nAll adult trees were genotyped at 374 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci originating from three different sources. First, we used SNPs discovered from 13 A. alba trees originating from Mont Ventoux (France) and the Black Forest (District Oberharmersbach, Germany). Transcriptomes were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 at IGA Technology Services (Udine, Italy). Transcriptome assembly and SNP detection was carried out with an in-house pipeline at IGA; see details in Roschanski et al. (2013). Previous SNP genotyping using KASP assays manufactured by LGC Genomics (Middlesex, United Kingdom) in French populations yielded 267 polymorphic loci situated in 175 different candidate genes (Roschanski et al., 2016). In this study, 220 of these loci were successfully genotyped using the same KASP assays. Second, we selected 110 new putatively neutral SNPs from the transcriptome assembly based on their Tajima’s D being between 2 and −2 and dN/dS between 0.9 and 1.1, low LD with the existing 224 SNPs (r2 < 0.1 and p-values > 0.05). ESTScan version 3.0.3 (Iseli et al., 1999) for Arabidopsis thaliana was used to predict coding DNA sequences for each contig from the transcriptome (Roschanski et al., 2013), then the SNPs detected by IGA were used to create pseudo-contigs on which the neutrality statistics were calculated. dN/dS was calculated with ‘polydNdS’1 based on (Thornton, 2003), and Tajima’s D with VariScan v2.0.3 (Vilella et al., 2005). Although all 110 SNPs passed initial in silico design tests, only 25 of these SNPs were successfully genotyped using KASP technology, most likely because the primer sequences were not specific enough (results not shown). Third, we selected 149 SNPs from Mosca et al. (2012), who discovered SNPs by resequencing 800 amplicons using PCR primer pairs from Pinus taeda in 12 Abies alba trees, and genotyped on a Golden Gate platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). We selected SNPs from this study that had less than 5% missing data. One hundred and twenty-nine of these SNPs were successfully genotyped with KASP. Both DNA extraction and all genotyping was performed using the all-inclusive service from LGC Genomics (Middlesex, United Kingdom).\n\nCommon garden experiment\n\nWe used published seedling phenotype data from the descendants of three mother trees from each of the 19 populations (Frank et al., 2017b), while correcting inconsistencies and outliers based on measurements taken in subsequent years (unpublished data of Andrea Kupferschmid). Here, we briefly summarize the protocol of the experiment relevant for silver fir. In April 2010, from each mother tree approximately 2000 seeds (subsequently called family) were sown directly into nursery beds and grown for two years at the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL in Birmensdorf, Switzerland (47°21′42″N, 8°27′22″E, 550 m a.s.l.). Families and populations were not replicated or randomized in the nursery. In spring 2012, at least 12 randomly selected viable seedlings per family with present terminal buds were transplanted to the open experimental field site. The field site was located at Brunnersberg, a former pasture on a south facing slope (20-24% incline) in the Swiss Jura Mountains (47°19′35″N, 7°36′42\"E, 1090 m a.s.l.). Seedlings were planted at 30 × 40 cm spacing in 10 blocks. Provenances, families and seedlings were randomized across blocks. Mortality during 2012 in the field was minor. Seedling height and diameter were measured in the autumn of 2012 and used in the analysis as a covariate to account for possible growth differences in the nursery.\n\nPhenotypic measurements used herein were performed during the growing season of 2013. Measurements of seedling Height (variable names capitalized hereafter) and Terminal and Lateral Bud Break started on 7 May 2013, when the first seedlings started to break buds, i.e. the membrane below bud scales was broken and the first green needles became visible. Observations of bud break dates continued twice a week until Growth Cessation, defined as the date when 95% of terminal leader height growth was achieved. Five to 17 height measures were recorded per seedling from which a Maximum Growth Rate was calculated as the first derivative of the growth curve (for simplicity, subsequently called Growth Rate). Growth Duration was calculated as time from Terminal Bud Break to Growth Cessation. Final seedling Height from ground surface to the uppermost bud base and stem Diameter at 2cm above ground surface were measured in autumn 2013. Finally, we also calculated the ratio Height/Diameter to test for trait divergence in growth allometry. For clarity, we call Height, Diameter, Height/Diameter size traits, Growth Rate and Duration growth traits, and Terminal/Lateral Bud Break and Growth Cessation (equivalent to bud set) phenology traits. All traits were normally distributed and correlated with one another to a varying extent (Figure S1).\n\nEnvironmental data\n\nWe used soil characteristics and downscaled historical climatic data to characterize environmental conditions in each population. Soil and geographic variables were adopted from Frank et al. (2017b), who established soil pits within a few meters of one of the mother trees (see list of variables used in Table S1). In order to obtain the closest representation of the climate of the period when the current populations were established, we used data from 1 January 1901 to 31 December 1978. The choice of this period was justified by two facts: (i) no observation-based climate data go back further in time, and (ii) starting from approximately 1980, the temperature time series are overwhelmed by the effect of global warming (Harris et al., 2014). We used statistical downscaling using the delta method (Hay et al., 2000) to obtain 1 km grid scale mean monthly temperature and precipitation fields for this period. The reference climatic data set was the 0.5° resolution CRU TS v. 4.01 data (20 September 2017 release, Harris et al. (2014)) available for the 1 January 1901 - 31 December 2016 period, while the downscaling was based on the overlapping period of 1 January 1979 - 31 December 2016 with the 1 km resolution CHELSA data (Karger et al., 2017).\n\nWe calculated several bioclimatic indices to characterize the environment for each site, including the 19 bioclimatic variables (Booth et al., 2014) implemented in the R package dismo (Hijmans et al., 2017), two potential evapotranspiration (PET) indices and four standardized precipitation - evapotranspiration index (SPEI) variables using the R package SPEI (Beguería & Vicente-Serrano, 2017), and two indicators of late frost (Table 1). Soil available water capacity (AWC) was obtained at a 250 m resolution from the Soilgrids data base (Hengl et al., 2017). Using temperature, precipitation and AWC, we calculated the self-calibrated Palmer’s drought severity index or scPDSI (Wells et al., 2004), and summarized to measures of drought severity and frequency across the full time series (Table 1). All climatic variables were considered as raw values or as deviations from the common garden environment in Brunnersberg (based on the CHELSA data for the period of 1 January 1979 - 31 December 2013). However, the two ways of calculating the climate led to the same conclusions (results not shown), so we present results with the raw variables only for ease of interpretation. To visualize the environmental differences between sites, we conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of all environmental variables of Tables 1 and S1, scaled and centered to make them comparable. The first PCA explained 32.6% of the variance and was dominated by temperature variables, and the second PCA axis explained 18.8% of the variance and was dominated by precipitation variables (Figure S2).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe used both single-trait and multi-trait approaches to test if the phenotypic divergence between populations is due to selection. First, we used a single-trait QST – FST test using the bootstrap procedure described in Whitlock & Guillaume (2009) implemented in the R package QstFstComp (Gilbert & Whitlock, 2015)2. We considered a one-tailed test, because we were interested in testing for adaptive divergence only, thus QST being significantly greater than FST. Second, we used single- and multi-trait versions of the test of adaptive divergence (S-test) developed by Ovaskainen et al. (2011) and implemented in the R package driftsel3. We estimated the coancestry matrix between all pairs of populations from variation in SNP allele frequencies based on the admixture F-model (AFM) using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm implemented in the R package RAFM4 (Karhunen & Ovaskainen, 2012). Thus, we assumed that contemporary populations evolved from a single ancestral population, which is likely a reasonable assumption for silver fir in Switzerland (Liepelt et al., 2002; Burga & Hussendörfer, 2001). Ten independent Markov chains of the AFM model reached slightly different local optima using a burn-in of 20,000 iterations followed by 10,000 iterations for estimation with a thinning interval of ten. Running longer chains (up to 50,000 iterations tested, results not shown) did not improve convergence to a common optimum, so we took the mean of the posterior means across the ten chains. Further, to gain more confidence in the estimated coancestry matrix, we compared the posterior mean coancestry matrix against that estimated using the Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in the software Structure v.2.3.4 Pritchard et al. (2000) (see Supporting Information for more details). Third, we used the H-test, developed by Karhunen et al. (2014), and a standardized version of it, subsequently referred to H*, to identify the potential environmental drivers of local adaptation. In the following paragraphs, we briefly summarize the rationale of the S-test, and its population-wise version, proposed herein, and the rationale of the proposed H* statistic.\n\nFollowing the notation of Ovaskainen et al. (2011), if we consider only additive effects, the vector of additive values of all traits for individual i is ai, and the matrix of additive vectors for all individuals is A = (ai)i. Then, the mean additive value of population X, , can be obtained as the mean of the additive values of all individuals in population X, and the matrix of additive vectors for all populations is AP = X. When populations are derived from a common ancestral population and the trait values are normally distributed, under drift, the matrix of population-level effects, AP, is expected to follow the multivariate normal distribution as where μ is the vector of expected additive trait means determined by the allele frequencies in the ancestral population, nP is the number of populations and Inp is an nP × nP identity matrix, GA is the ancestral variance-covariance matrix, θP is the population-to-population coancestry matrix, and ⊗ is the Kroenecker product. θP can be estimated assuming the admixture F-model, while μ, Ap, and GA can be co-estimated using the Bayesian mixed-effects animal model accounting for the family structure of the common garden (i.e. the pedigree) and θP(Ovaskainen et al., 2011). Then, the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix of the contemporary populations assuming no selection, G, can be estimated as G = 2GA(1 – θS), where θS is the mean within-population (or self) coancestry of all populations, thus the drift distance of the contemporary populations from the ancestral population. Here, we estimated the heritability of traits and the genetic correlation between trait pairs as the proportion of the observed phenotypic variance and covariances that are additive (i.e. using G) (Falconer & Mackay, 1996). The evidence for selection can be summarized using the S-statistic calculated as the Mahalanobis distance between AP and the distribution of equation 1. S = 0.5 indicates consistency with neutrality, S = 0 implies a match with purifying, and S = 1 with diversifying selection. Thus, S measures the overall signature of selection across all populations. In this study, we also test if any particular populations show a signature of selection. We propose that adaptive trait divergence at population X may be concluded if the 95% of the posterior distribution of is outside of the neutral envelop defined as μ ± . The neutral envelop can be uni- or multi-variate depending if one or multiple traits are studied. Our motivation for this population-wise evaluation of divergence is that a single S-statistic cannot distinguish between the two scenarios of many populations that are slightly diverged or a single/few populations that are diverged to a great extent.\n\nThe H-statistics measure if the distance between the populations’ mean additive trait values is more similar to the environmental distances than expected based on drift (Karhunen et al., 2014). The original H-test is based on the Mantel test statistic, i.e. the product moment between the distance matrices of environment and traits. As the covariance is not only influenced by the correlation between the matrices but also by the absolute values of trait differences, the original H-test may yield false positive results. In particular, in cases with strong evidence for selection, the H statistic can be high (i.e. close to 1) even when selection is uncorrelated with the tested environmental driver. For this reason, we propose the use of the H* statistic, which is the Pearson or standardized Mantel statistic, thus the H*-test can be viewed as a standardized version of the H-test. We note that the superiority of a standardized Mantel statistic has already been pointed out in the context of spatial distance matrices (Legendre & Fortin, 2010). The population-wise divergence test and the H*-test are now implemented in the most recent version of the R package driftsel5.\n\nResults\n\nPopulation structure and drift distances\n\nFST using the Whitlock & Guillaume (2009) approach was 0.0056 (95% confidence interval: 0.0051, 0.0061). The drift distances estimated with AFM indicated the presence of two main clusters that correspond to eastern and western populations (Figure 1B). The population POS did not belong to either of these groups, which is plausible given that it is situated south of a high mountain pass (the Bernina pass) close to the Italian border (Figure 1A). The coancestry matrix can also be used to obtain a coancestry-based estimate of FST, which was 0.0184 (95% credible interval: 0.0167, 0.0202) for the 19 populations. The comparison between AFM and Structure revealed similar results (see Supporting Information for more details).\n\nSingle-trait analysis\n\nSingle-trait tests of adaptive divergence in terms of QST – FST comparisons using the Whitlock & Guillaume (2009) approach and in terms of the S statistic from the Ovaskainen et al. (2011) method gave similar results (Table 2). Using either of the methods, the strongest signature of adaptive divergence was observed for seedling Height followed by four other traits with a strong evidence of selection; in decreasing order of evidence based on the S statistic: Lateral Bud Break, Terminal Bud Break, Diameter, and Growth Duration. The remaining three traits showed no or a weak signal of unusual trait differentiation using either of the approaches. For Growth Cessation and Height/Diameter the QST – FST test was marginally significant, while the S statistic was close to 0.5, consist with neutrality. For Growth Rate, there was no evidence of selection using either approach.\n\nThe population-wise S-tests revealed a signature of selection in several populations. Figure 2 shows, for each trait, how much each population diverged from the ancestral mean and if this divergence is more than expected by drift. These population-level estimates confirmed that Height diverged the most among populations (Figure 2B): eight out of 19 populations deviated from the neutral expectation with at least 95% posterior probability. All these eight populations evolved towards a higher mean height and no populations have been selected for reduced height. Although the deviation from the neutral expectation was not as strong for Diameter as for Height, the first seven tallest populations also diverged towards the largest Diameter (Figure 2A), suggesting co-evolution between Height and Diameter, and explaining the lack of unusual differentiation at Height/Diameter (Figure 2C). Evidence for trait divergence was also observed for a single population, SIR, for Growth Duration (Figure 2E) and Lateral Bud Break (Figure 2H). The SIR population evolved towards earlier bud break and longer growth duration than expected by drift alone. At the opposite end of the trait space, population VRG evolved towards late Terminal Bud Break and shorter Growth Duration, yet the evidence for divergence was not very strong in this single-trait test.\n\nMulti-trait analysis\n\nWe performed only two-trait analyses due to convergence problems with three or more traits (results not shown). We considered only one of the bud break traits in this pairwise analysis, Terminal Bud Break, because the two traits were very strongly correlated. The heritability values for a given trait were slightly different depending on the particular pairwise analysis because GA is different, and also θP is updated in the Bayesian animal model (Table S2). For most trait pairs the genetic correlations were small or negligible (Table S2) and agreed well with phenotypic correlations (Figure 3A). The highest phenotypic correlation (0.64) was observed between two size traits, Height and Diameter, yet their genetic correlation was half as much (0.32, Table S1). Ten populations showed evidence for adaptive co-divergence in Height and Diameter (Figure 4). In contrast, some unusually high genetic correlations (i.e. higher than the phenotypic equivalents) were observed between traits of different kind: between growth and phenology (Growth Duration and Terminal Bud Break, Growth Rate and Terminal Bud Break), and between size and phenology (Height/Diameter and Growth Cessation; Figure 3A). The S-statistics was high only for the first two trait pairs (Figure 3B), suggesting a correlated evolution at the three traits (Figure 5). In particular, two populations reached an important level of divergence in the opposite directions. These patters can be interpreted as contrasting life history strategies. SIR showed adaptive divergence for all three trait combinations, while MGY for Growth Duration vs Growth Rate (Figure 5). Thus, we can say that SIR and MGY follow a “start early and grow slow” strategy, i.e. they burst buds early and then grow for a long time at a low rate. At the other end of trait space, population VRG follows a or “start late and grow fast” strategy, i.e. bursts buds late, but then grows fast for a short period of time (Figure 5).\n\nEnvironmental drivers\n\nH and H* assess how much each environmental variable moves the Mantel statistic away from the neutral expectation (i.e. random association with the environment conditional on the drift distances). First, we tested the effect of the “global” environment, i.e. used all environmental variables listed in Tables 1 and S1 to calculate the environmental distance matrix. We repeated this analysis on the scaled and centered environmental variables, but they led to similar results, so only the analysis using the raw variables is reported. The “global” environment explained trait divergence for Diameter, Height and Growth Rate (Table 2). For traits for which S was close to 0.5, such as Height/Diameter and Growth Cessation, there were no associations with the environmental variables either. Similarly, for Bud Break traits and Growth Duration, H was also slightly smaller than S and H* was close to 0.5 (Table 2). However, using the “global” environment, we assume that all aspects of the environment are important for adaptation. Further such global environmental distance matrix is dominated by the effects of temperature, which explains the most variation in the environmental data (Figure S2). In reality, it is likely that for each particular trait a particular aspect of the environment matters more than other aspects, so we applied the H- and H* -tests for each environmental variable listed in Tables 1 and S1 separately. Since our objective was to prioritize the environmental variables, we did not correct for multiple testing. The H - and H*-statistics generally led to similar conclusions concerning the role of each environmental variable, but the H-statistic was inflated under a generally strong signal of selection, such as for Height (Figure S3).\n\nThe role of the environment in the divergence of Height and Diameter was most important among all traits (Table 2). Additionally, the environmental variables that had an H*-statistic higher than 0.95 for Height included all variables that fulfilled the same criterion for Diameter, suggesting that the same environmental cues matter for the evolution of both traits. Remarkably, all of these environmental variables were related to temperature and drought, but not precipitation per se. The most important environmental variables in the order of decreasing H*-statistic for Height were Thornthwaite’s mean annual evapotranspiration (PET.thorn), mean temperature of the warmest quarter (bio.10), isothermality (bio.3), annual mean temperature (bio.1), available water capacity (AWC), elevation, mean temperature of the coldest quarter (bio.11), maximum temperature of the warmest month (bio.5), minimum temperature of the coldest month (bio.6), mean diurnal range (bio.2), latitude and drought severity measured as the 1% quantile of the self-calibrated Palmer’s Drought Severity Index across the whole time series. To support the interpretation of these results, we performed a PCA of these environmental variables. We found that all populations that diverged towards a larger size in terms of Height and Diameter were situated at the warm, stable and humid side of the environmental space (Figure 6A). Finally, note that the precipitation-related variables (bio.12, bio.13, bio.14, bio.15, bio.18) had the lowest correlation with adaptive divergence for tree size (H*-statistics were below 0.5).\n\nDivergence at the two Growth traits and the two Bud Break traits also correlated with habitat differences: The most important environmental variables (H*≥0.85) largely overlapped for these traits and were most often related to precipitation (Figure 6B). Mean temperature of the wettest quarter (bio.8), precipitation seasonality (bio.15), precipitation of warmest quarter (bio.18), and mean diurnal range (bio.2) were omnipresent as environmental variables with the highest H*-statistics for the four traits. Again, the common habitat variables that explain adaptation for these traits is not surprising given the evidence for their correlated evolution (Figure 5). The PCA of these environmental variables illustrates that the drivers of the “start early and grow slow” strategy of SIR, and to some extent that of MGY and GRY, are low average precipitation, low of precipitation seasonality, and high temperature amplitude both at the annual and monthly levels (Figure 6B), reflecting the cold winters and hot and dry summers of the Rhône Valley. At the other end of the trait space, the climate of population VRG is characterized by ample winter precipitation, late snow and late frost, and low soil silt content, which could explain the late bud break and short but fast growth of this population (Figure 6B).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we found clear evidence of local adaptation at size, growth and phenology traits of seedlings originating from 19 silver fir populations from across Switzerland. Thus, our study relies on the common, and often supported (e.g. Cornelissen et al., 2003; Major et al., 2003), assumption that traits measured at seedlings predicts those at adult trees. Tree size (Height and Diameter) has been under strong selection in warm and humid areas of Switzerland (Central Plateau), where populations evolved towards a taller and larger stature (Figure 4 and 6). The role of selection on Height is further supported by the fact that the selection gradient is South-North (northern populations being taller), while the main demographic axis is East-West (Figure 1B). The annual development cycle of temperate trees likely results from an evolutionary trade-off between two opposing forces: maximizing the length of the vegetative season while avoiding late frost and summer drought. This life-history trade-off is particularly crucial in mountainous environments, where the length of the growing season is often limited. In this study, the timing, the rate, and the duration of growth have been under selection that allowed populations to evolve towards two extreme strategies that reflect adaptation to the amount and timing of precipitation (Figure 5 and 6). Populations of the Rhône Valley, especially SIR, but also MGY and GRY (Figure 1A), seem to persevere the conditions of this notoriously dry inner Alpine valley of Switzerland. Here, annual precipitation is low and falls mainly in winter, while high temperatures and drought are common during spring and summer. These populations are adapted to such climatic conditions through early bud break and slow growth during the dry but long vegetative season (Figure 5). We observed the opposite strategy in VRG, and to some extent in MUO. Both populations are situated in high-altitude mountain valleys (Figure 1A), where late snow delays the start of the vegetative season, but then growth is fastest in these populations (Figure 5).\n\nQuantitative genetic theory suggests that fitness-related traits are under strong selective pressure with stabilizing selection reducing genetic variation among individuals (e.g. Mousseau & Roff, 1987). As a result, it is often observed that heritability estimates are lower on morphological than on life-history traits (Visscher et al., 2008). In contrast, estimates of heritability from Frank et al. (2017b) using 90 Swiss populations of silver fir revealed the highest heritability for phenology and growth, and lowest for size. Further, our estimates of the heritability derived from the ancestral G-matrix also revealed the highest values for the two Bud Break traits, while the lowest for Height (Table S2). We may speculate that height has been under strong selection, thus its additive genetic variance has been reduced. The fitness advantage of being tall for trees are clear: Taller trees have access to more light, thus can have enhanced growth, and high stature facilitates the pollen and grain dispersion (Petit & Hampe, 2006). Further, artificial selection for height may also have affected these populations, further reducing the additive genetic variance. The populations that have been selected for being taller in this study (Figure 2B) are located in the geographic region that are the most easily accessible for foresters due to their low elevation and often flat terrain. Since tree height is a key trait from an economical point of view, and there has been a long history of management in this region (e.g. Bürgi & Schuler, 2003), we cannot exclude the possibility that there has been artificial selection in these populations.\n\nInterestingly, two traits, Height/Diameter and Growth Cessation, did not show evidence of adaptive divergence, but they were genetically correlated (0.25), while lacking any phenotypic correlation (0.04, Figure 3, Table S1). The allometric relationship between Height and Diameter has been extensively studied in forest trees because it determines the volume of the harvestable stem and carbon storage, and it is also associated with wood quality such as lignin and cellulose content (e.g. Chave et al., 2014). The fact that Growth Cessation did not show a signature of selection may seem surprising given the overwhelming evidence of adaptive clines for bud set (a proxy for growth cessation) in many species, including conifers (Alberto et al., 2013). The explanation may lie in the deterministic bud development of the Abies species (Cooke et al., 2012). They produce terminal buds during the summer at the tip of each leading branch shoot and remain dormant during the following winter. Each bud contains a preformed miniature of the terminal and lateral shoots with all the needles that will grow to branches and photosynthesizing needles, respectively, during the following growing season. Thus, given that the timing of the start (bud burst) and the rate (maximum growth rate and growth duration) of this developmental trait have been under selection (Figure 5), the timing of the end cannot be under selection. The positive genetic and negligible phenotypic correlation between Height/Diameter and Growth Cessation may indicate that the trees can only increase their height in relation to their diameter at the price of growing longer; however, the evolution of this developmental process is extremely constrained due to canalization.\n\nA long-standing hypothesis in evolutionary biology is that traits belonging to the same functional and/or developmental group are genetically more integrated than traits with different functions or developmental origins (Berg, 1960; Pigliucci & Preston, 2004). Several empirical studies found evidence that there is greater genetic and phenotypic character integration within suites of functionally or developmentally related traits than between them, e.g. between and within floral vs. vegetative traits in plants (Waitt & Levin, 1998; Baranzelli et al., 2014). In this study, we measured exclusively vegetative traits, but three kinds, related to size, growth, and phenology. Indeed, we found that the genetic correlations tended to be higher than phenotypic correlations between different trait kinds than within (Figure 3A), and in particular, between growth and phenology. These results suggest that at the physiological and molecular level, growth and phenology are strongly linked.\n\nOverall, our methodology proved more informative than classical QST – FST comparisons, even though the high number of populations leveraged the power of the classical test and led to similar global conclusions (Table 2). First, we were able to pinpoint which populations diverged from a supposed ancestral trait value (Figure 2). Second, the multi-trait analysis allowed us to identify life-history strategies that are under selection, and third, we were able to identify the selective environment. In particular, we found that the same environmental variables explained best the single-trait adaptive population differentiation at traits that were genetically correlated in the multi-trait analysis, which provides particularly strong evidence for the role of temperature and humidity in the evolution of tree size (Figure 6A) and the role of precipitation seasonality in the timing and mode of growth (Figure 6B).\n\nRecent evidence suggests a global increase in climate-driven forest decline that is primarily driven by a combination of rising temperatures and drought stress, so-called hot-drought, e.g. Allen et al. (2010). Such conditions foster detrimental agents such as pests (pathogens, herbivores) or physical disturbances such as storms (e.g. Csilléry et al., 2017). For Europe, the most recent IPCC report predicts an increase in temperature, along with a decrease in summer precipitation and an increase in winter precipitation (Stocker et al., 2014). Although there is abundant evidence of the past evolution of plants in response to climate, such as past range shifts during glaciations (e.g. Petit et al., 2003; Aitken et al., 2008), the question is the extent to which adaptive evolution can compensate the effects of rapid climate change. Silver fir may already be in danger in some areas of the Mediterranean, where die-back events have been documented (Cailleret et al., 2014), or in south-western Europe, where reduced growth patterns have been reported (Gazol et al., 2015). Yet, positive effects of climate warming have also been observed in temperate areas, where warming enhanced growth (Gazol et al., 2015). The predicted pace of climate change is much faster than it has been during the time since post-glacial expansion/re-colonization, thus assisted migration can provide a practical solution (Aitken & Bemmels, 2016). Based on our results, populations of the Rhône Valley may provide dry tolerant seed sources for future plantations in other parts of Switzerland."
