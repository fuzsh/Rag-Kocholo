        "text": "How is the Education System in Switzerland?\n\nThe education system in Switzerland is not only one of the best in Europe, but it is considered one of the top systems in the world. The small country continually ranks on annual Top 10 lists comparing education across the globe.\n\nEducation Facts in Switzerland\n\nHomeschooling is not common in Switzerland, and some cantons even outlaw it. If you plan to homeschool your child, be sure to check your individual canton laws.\n\nCantons encourage parental participation throughout primary and secondary school. Part of this participation includes supporting foreign families. Do not be surprised if Swiss nationals from your childâs school reach out to you.\n\nWhat is the Education Like in Switzerland?\n\nMuch like its healthcare system, education in Switzerland is decentralized. Education standards are set by each individual canton, and there are slight differences depending on if the canton is predominantly German, Italian, or French. That is why, if you move from one canton to another, the switch will require some adjustment on the studentâs part. Note that schools can vary widely when it comes to school calendar, education structure, teaching methods, and curriculum. However, no matter where you live in Switzerland, the quality of education here is high.\n\nOverall, the educational approach throughout the school system as a whole is focused on nurturing a childâs inherent abilities. In primary school, students are schooled together. After primary school, students are separated according to their academic abilities and interests. Most schools and cantons implement placement exams to do so.\n\nWhat are the School Systems Like in Switzerland?\n\nRequirements for compulsory schooling rests with each canton, and each municipality is responsible for organizing their own schools. This allows schools to tailor their school programs to meet the local needs of their community.\n\nCompulsory education in Switzerland lasts for nine to eleven years depending on the canton. In most cantons, children must begin primary school at age six. Primary school lasts eight years; however, only six of them are mandatory. Mandatory secondary education lasts for three years, but in some cantons it is four.\n\nCantons create their own school calendar, but the school year in Switzerland typically starts mid-August or September and ends in May or June. Schools typically follow twelve-week semester systems with two semesters per school year.\n\nSchool Ages in Switzerland\n\nAlthough school ages vary by canton and municipality, these are the general ages of students and their corresponding school years:\n\nKindergarten 4â6 years old Primary School 6â12 years old Lower Secondary 12â15 years old Upper Secondary 15â18 years old\n\nGrading System in Switzerland\n\nGrades in Switzerland are typically on a six-point scale with six being the highest possible grade.\n\n6 Excellent 5.5 Very good 5 Good 4.5 Satisfactory 4 Sufficient 3.5 Insufficient 3 Poor 2.5â1 Very poor\n\nSchool Hours\n\nPublic school costs are free and are funded by high tax rates. Your child should be allowed to enroll at any point during the school year, but rules may vary by canton. The most common documents you will need to enroll your child are:\n\nchildâs birth certificate\n\nproof of health and accident insurance\n\nresident permit\n\nMain Differences Between Public and Private Schools\n\nThe education standards between public and private schools are so similar that most Swiss nationals enroll their children in public schools. However, there, the classes are taught in the dominate language of the canton (German, French, Italian, or Romansh). So, if your child needs instruction in English or a different language, you should look into private or international schools.\n\nOther differences include the school cost: public schools are free, whereas private schools are expensive to attend: 9,000â30,000 CHF (9,090â30,300 USD) for day classes; 70,000â90,000 CHF (70,700â90,900 USD) for boarding school. Additionally, private schools also have smaller class sizes, while the average public-school class has around 20 students.\n\nDaycare and Kindergarten\n\nThere are plenty of daycare and kindergarten options for families living in Switzerland. Keep in mind that the names of schools, such as âdaycareâ and âkindergarten,â may change depending on the dominant language of the canton.\n\nDaycare\n\nDaycares in Switzerland are referred to as crÃ¨ches in French-speaking cantons and Krippe or KiTa in German ones. Daycares accept children before they turn one-year-old and all the way up until when they can begin kindergarten. These schools are mostly used by parents who need to go to work every day.\n\nFees for daycares are notoriously high in Switzerland. Depending on where you live, prices range around 60Â­â150 CHF (60â150 USD) per day. In the bigger cities, the prices will be even higher. It is not uncommon for Swiss families to spend nearly 30% of their income on childcare options. For families who cannot afford these prices, some cantonal authorities provide subsidized options for as low as 10 CHF (10 USD) per day. Some schools may even give discounts for siblings.\n\nTo enroll your child, parents should approach crÃ¨ches in person. Be aware that there are usually waiting lists. CrÃ¨chesÂ can be in an official building or run from a designated crÃ¨chesÂ workerâs home.\n\nNursery (Pre-school)\n\nNursery can be called pre-school as it comes before the compulsory school age. Children can attend nursery as young as four years of age, although some cantons may require your child be four years and nine months. Parents should apply in writing.\n\nSchools operate between 08:30â12:00, break for lunch, and return from 13:00â15:30. Nursery school programs are set by each canton, but curricula typically focus on cognitive and social development. At this age, the childâs performance is rarely assessed and there are no selection criteria.\n\nIs Nursery (Pre-school) Mandatory?\n\nMost Swiss cantons offer two years of preschool, but do not require children to attend. However, this varies by region and it is best to check with your specific cantonal authorities to be sure. In general, the majority of Swiss children attend at least one year of preschool, and over half attend two.\n\nKindergarten\n\nThe difference between kindergarten and pre-school is minimal when it comes to curricula or school age. The main distinction is that kindergarten is mandatory in some cantons as a part of primary education, while in others it is not. Requirements for how long a child must attend kindergarten also vary by canton, as some German-speaking cantons mandate a child enrolls in two years of kindergarten, but others require just one. Be sure to check your new homeâs educational department before you move.\n\nPrimary and Secondary Schools\n\nSome of the best primary and secondary schools in Switzerland are public schools. Nearly 95% of Swiss residents choose to send their children to public schools because they are free, and the education students receive is of extremely high caliber.\n\nPrimary School\n\nPrimary (or elementary) school begins with kindergarten and lasts for about sevenÂ­ to eight years depending on your canton. Kids are schooled together and learn general subject like math, writing, and literature.\n\nUpon graduation, students take an exam that determines their track for secondary education. The exam varies from canton to canton. Many parents opt for tutors or after-school courses to prepare for the exam because much of the test material is not covered in primary school.\n\nSecondary School\n\nThere are several factors that determine your childâs options for secondary school (also called high school). The first, and probably most important (and probably most predictable), is your canton. In Zurich, for example, a student has the option to enroll in standard secondary school or they can opt for langgymnasium. The standard secondary school will last three to four years and students can choose a learning specialty to focus on. Langgymnasium is for six years and prepares students for specialized careers.\n\nThroughout the country, secondary school is usually divided between upper and lower secondary. Again, students have many options when it comes to upper secondary because much of it depends on the canton as well as the studentâs personal interests and abilities. Students can choose between a more academically minded track or a vocational track, which usually entails an apprenticeship. Students are schooled in the dominate language of the canton and they learn two foreign languages as well, most commonly, the languages of the other cantons.\n\nUpper Secondary School\n\nIn upper secondary, students can also choose to attend a matura school. There are six types of matura schools that focus on different curricula:\n\nMath and Science (Matematisches und Naturwissenschaftliches Gymnasium)\n\nModern languages (Neusprachliches Gymnasium)\n\nClassical languages (Altsprachliches Gymnasium)\n\nSecondary School of Economics (Wirtschaftsgymnasium)\n\nSecondary Music and Art school (Musisches Gymnasium)\n\nSecondary School of Sports (Sportgymnasium)\n\nLike Zurichâs langgymnasium, these schools will require students pass an entrance exam. Like the exam at the end of primary school, this exam has a reputation for being extremely tough with material that is not often taught in school. If I child gets into one of these schools, they should be prepared to work hard as the schools have high academic standards in order to remain enrolled.\n\nAt the end of the schooling there will be a finishing exam, the matura, that all students are required to pass to graduate. The exam will vary by canton, but on average students can expect to be tested on the following:\n\nbasic subjects (math, various sciences, history, geography, arts)\n\nmajor subject depending on their concentration\n\nessay question\n\nfirst national language (depending on canton)\n\nsecond national language\n\nthird national language (typically either English, Latin, or Greek)\n\nFor the languages, students will also be tested on the literature of that language.\n\nInternational Schools\n\nSwitzerland is known for some of the best international schools in Europe. Although most of the schools have reputations for strict discipline, they are also known for their extremely high educational standards.\n\nSchools in Switzerland for International Students\n\nWhether you prefer a British school, American school, or even a Japanese education, the schools in Switzerland cover a large variety of languages and curricula for international students. German schools are the easiest to come by as are French schools, since French and German are two of the official languages of the country. You will find the greatest option for these schools in the French and German cantons. Religious schools are also possible such as Christian or Catholic schools.\n\nMost international schools promote a bilingual program, but some even have trilingual ones. If language learning is of particular importance to your child, this is worth looking into. Teaching methods from across the globe can also be found if you plan on only staying in Switzerland for a short while.\n\nInternational School Requirements and Admission\n\nSwitzerland has nearly 50 international schools spread throughout the country for you to choose from. Requirements vary and you can expect most to have waiting lists. While it is possible to enroll your student mid-year, it is more common to start at the beginning of the school year.\n\nGeneral requirements for international schools:\n\nprevious school records\n\nresidence permit\n\nhealth and accident insurance\n\nInternational school tuition fees average around 30,000â40,000 CHF (30,300â40,400 USD) per year. Fees may vary depending on the school and your childâs age.\n\nSome of Switzerlandâs Top International Schools\n\nTASIS The American School in Switzerland\n\nSurval Montreux\n\nLe RÃ©gent College\n\nInstitut auf dem Rosenberg"
