        "text": "Introduction\n\nContact tracing is a crucial public health measure for controlling the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2]. Traditionally, contact tracing involves interviewing all infected individuals (index cases) to systematically identify their close contacts. This aims at interrupting viral transmission chains by referring these close contacts to quarantine and SARS-CoV-2 testing [2–4]. However, such manual contact tracing (MCT) has inherent time delays, is resource intensive, and is limited by imperfect recall of encounters, especially those occurring briefly or by chance. Given the rapid SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the high proportion of asymptomatic cases, MCT alone is thus unlikely to be sufficiently effective [5, 6]. Digital proximity tracing (DPT) has been developed as a scalable complementary method to identify transmission chains that are likely to be missed or identified late by MCT [7, 8].\n\nDPT applications register proximity encounters between individuals using the app with the aim to identify individuals that may have been exposed to an index case. Different technologies and architectures for DPT exist, one of which is decentralized, privacy-preserving proximity tracing (DP-3T) using Bluetooth Low Energy signals [9, 10]. The Swiss DPT app, «SwissCovid», was one of the first to be launched in June 2020 and follows the DP-3T blueprint. In May 2021, SwissCovid had around 1.76 million active users, corresponding to 20.5% of the Swiss population [11]. Details on the design and implementation of SwissCovid are reported elsewhere [8, 12].\n\nDPT has three potential advantages over MCT [12]. First, the notification of exposed DPT app users is automatized once the index case has triggered the notification, leading to a potential speed advantage over MCT in interrupting transmission chains. Second, DPT still functions when MCT is at capacity due to high case numbers. Third, DPT has a wider reach than MCT because it does not rely on the infected individual’s recollection of his or her encounters. However, DPT apps are complex interventions involving multiple, sequential steps and specific actions by app users to exert their effect (notification cascade [13], Supplementary File 1). To date, the possible impact of DPT apps on pandemic mitigation is only partially understood. Some modeling studies reported that DPT, alone or in combination with MCT, can have an effect in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission [7, 14, 15]. However, they relied on several strong assumptions, indicating that DPT effectiveness strongly depends on population uptake and the timeliness of case identification and quarantining of contacts [16, 17]. Population-level data from the Isle of Wight [18] and more recently from England and Wales [19] provided evidence of the impact of the NHS COVID-19 app on SARS-CoV-2 incidence. In the latter analysis, Wymant et al. estimated that app notifications averted between approximately 200,00–900,000 cases between November and December 2020 [19].\n\nOnly few empirical analyses on the effectiveness of SwissCovid exist. Two studies identified factors associated with DPT app uptake and reasons for non-use [20], as well as challenges related to the implementation of SwissCovid in Switzerland [21]. Salathé et al. analyzed publicly available performance indicators for SwissCovid, such as number of app downloads and notification codes (CovidCodes) entered, and demonstrated proof-of-principle for the functioning of the app [22]. Furthermore, findings from a recent simulation study of the SwissCovid notification cascade in the Canton of Zurich suggest that DPT notifications may have led to an additional 5% of exposed persons entering quarantine in September 2020 [13].\n\nYet, critical questions pertaining to other conditions necessary for the functioning of DPT apps and their real-world impact remain unanswered. In particular, it is unclear whether the app indeed reduces the time between exposure and entering quarantine in close contacts. Using data from the Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort, this study had two main aims. First, we evaluated the adherence of SwissCovid app users with the recommended steps (i.e., uploading of CovidCodes by cases upon testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, and quarantine and testing by close contacts upon receiving an app notification). Second, we examined the effectiveness of SwissCovid by evaluating whether the time from exposure to quarantine differed between close contacts who have or have not received an app warning.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study of 261 close contacts and 393 cases (including 65 converted individuals) identified through routine contact tracing in the Canton of Zurich, we evaluated use of SwissCovid and whether it provides a time advantage over MCT. Our analysis showed that non-household contacts notified by the app started quarantine earlier than those not notified by the app. This provides important evidence that DPT apps have an impact on the timely interruption of transmissions chains.\n\nMost household contacts entered quarantine the same or the following day after exposure to a case in our study. This was expected, as they are easier to contact and are commonly informed directly by the case about their exposure. On the other hand, the contacting of non-household contacts through MCT is often more time-consuming and longer delays may be expected. We found evidence for a possible time advantage through the app in non-household setting, with app-notified contacts entering quarantine on average 1 day earlier than those not notified by the app. Considering that the testing delay (i.e., time from symptom onset to positive test) is 2.5 days on average in the Canton of Zurich [24], tracing delays and an overall reduced effectiveness of a contact tracing strategy are to be expected [14]. However, this does not explain differences between app notified and not app notified contacts. To explain this difference, we descriptively explored multiple hypotheses. We found that a higher percentage of app notified non-household contacts reported to have entered self-quarantine compared to those not notified by the app (47 vs. 31%). This finding supports the hypothesis that receiving an app notification may lead to a shorter time between exposure and quarantine. Although only 8 (19%) of 43 app notified contacts received the app warning before being reached by MCT, app notifications received after being called by contact tracers may not be without effect. For example, these notifications could have a reinforcing effect on the quarantine recommendations by MCT. We additionally explored alternative hypotheses that could explain our findings, such as confounding by case characteristics (e.g., more symptomatic cases or earlier testing among app users). However, we found no indication for systematic confounding in our descriptive analyses. Additionally, as the non-app notified group in our main analysis also included non-app users, our finding of a difference in time to quarantine may have potentially been influenced by better compliance of app users. Nonetheless, we found similar results after restricting our analysis to only app users.\n\nOur findings constitute the first evidence that DPT may be effective in reaching close contacts faster than MCT. Albeit small, such a time difference may be relevant in reducing transmission in the population. Ferretti et al. demonstrated in a modeling study that reducing the time to quarantine from 3 to 2 days had a substantial impact on reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, assuming that a large fraction of the population is using the app [7]. This emphasizes the need to focus on behavioral aspects of app uptake and use for the implementation of DPT, as well as to consider specific subgroups in its evaluation, such as distinguishing between different exposure settings.\n\nIn our study, participants were enrolled during a period when case numbers were comparatively low. One potential advantage of the app is that it may be even more effective in times when case numbers are high leading to capacity issues in MCT. However, this requires that app coverage is sufficient and an efficient process is in place to initiate the notification cascade [13, 22]. Thus, our findings may underestimate the effectiveness of the SwissCovid app in situations where MCT is overwhelmed. In addition, this analysis is restricted to close contacts that were identified by MCT, due to the design of the Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort study. However, another potential advantage of the app is in warning exposed individuals that were unknown to the case or about whom they had forgotten [7]. This setting is difficult to assess given the privacy-by-design principle implemented in the SwissCovid app and was not within the scope of this analysis. As a consequence, our analysis did not consider potential additional benefits arising in the context of such exposure events.\n\nA high percentage of participants reported using the app, exceeding previous estimates based on publicly available data and other population-based surveys [20, 22]. This difference may be explained by participants enrolled in the Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort study being better informed about COVID-19 and more compliant with preventive public health measures than non-participants. Based on our data, the generation and uploading of CovidCodes seemed efficient, which contrasts previous reports of an approximate 30% gap between generated and entered CovidCodes [22]. Nevertheless, some of the participants also reported significant delays in receiving the CovidCodes. Until recently, the SwissCovid notification cascade suffered a few bottlenecks relating to the CovidCode generation process. Prior to October 2020, issuance of the codes was linked to MCT. It relied on the contact tracers to clarify whether a case requires a code during the initial tracing call and relaying the information to another person responsible for issuing the codes. In parallel to the generation and sending of CovidCodes to the cases, the contact tracer would continue to call the contacts. As the app would take a few hours until it pushes the notifications, MCT would have in theory reached the close contact first. This may also be reflected in the relatively low proportion of close contacts being notified by the app before being reached by MCT. However, although most contacts were reached the same day, contact tracers sometimes had trouble reaching the contacts by phone, leading to time delays and providing the app with a time advantage over MCT. Additional steps have been taken to improve the efficiency of the processes necessary for reducing such delays. In October, the CovidCode generation process was separated from MCT and cases were able to personally request codes through text messages. Additionally, health service providers such as laboratories, pharmacies and testing centers were able to generate and issue CovidCodes to cases starting November 18, 2020 to ensure a more rapid initiation of the notification cascade. Since December 12, 2020, CovidCodes are generated and sent automatically through an online form completed by cases as the first step in MCT in the Canton of Zurich.\n\nSome further limitations of our study should be noted. Selection effects during enrollment may have led to a generally more health literate or compliant study population. However, such self-selection effects would not invalidate the proof-of-principle of our analysis but limit the transportability of our findings to the general population. Furthermore, despite consistent signals in our data, a causality between app notification and faster quarantine could not be unequivocally demonstrated. But the observation of a small subgroup of contacts who received the app notification and entered quarantine before being reached by MCT instills confidence that SwissCovid, in principle, achieves one of its main goals. Further studies are needed to quantify the impact of our findings on pandemic mitigation.\n\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a DPT app and leverages data from a population-based cohort study. While a more in-depth assessment of the exact sequence and timing of events related to the notification cascade may shed further light on the impact of SwissCovid on an individual level, our findings confirm the hypothesized benefit of DPT apps alarming non-household contacts earlier than MCT, thereby leading to earlier quarantine."
