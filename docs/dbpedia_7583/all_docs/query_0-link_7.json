        "text": "1) St. Peterskirche (St. Peter's Church) (must see)\n\nSaint Peterskirche (Saint Peter's Church) was built in the 9th century, which makes it the oldest church in Zurich. It also boasts the fame of having the largest clock face in all of Europe, measuring 8.6 meters (28.3 feet) in diameter. This translates to a minute hand that is 5.7 meters long (18.8 feet)!\n\nThe church was significantly altered in the 13th century and again in the early 1700s. Up until 1911, a firewatcher manned the steeple. It was his job to look out the windows four times an hour to look for fires. If he spotted a fire, he was to sound an alarm and point to the direction of the fire with a flag. Apparently, this ended up being an effective strategy because, unlike many other European cities, Zurich never suffered any devastating fires.\n\nThe interior of the church features a Baroque nave and a Romanesque choir with some faded medieval murals including a glimpse of a saint. A fascinating sight to see inside Saint Peter's is the name of God in Hebrew above the pulpit, indicating the Reformation emphasis on the original biblical languages.\n\nOne interesting fact about the church is that it has split ownership. The City of Zurich owns the church tower, while Saint Peter’s parish of the Swiss Reformed Church owns the belfry and bells, as well as the staircase leading to the tower.\n\nTip:\n\nIt is very interesting up close, but it is more beautiful from across the river.\n\n2) Fraumünster (Church of Our Lady) (must see)\n\nAs you may have noticed, Zurich’s skyline is dotted with church spires; however, none are as remarkable as the slender blue spire of the Fraumünster. In 853 Emperor Ludwig founded a Benedictine convent on this site and his daughter became the first abbess of the convent. In 874 a basilica with a crypt was added. The crypt holds the relics of the martyred two Patron Saints of Zurich, Felix and Regula.\n\nThe present church on the site dates from the mid 13th century, but the crypt still remains beneath the church. Reformation closed the convent and in 1524, the last abbess donated the church and abbey to City of Zurich. All icons and religious imagery were destroyed.\n\nThe church underwent a remodel in the 1970, with the installation of beautiful stained glass windows by the famous Russian-French modernist artist Marc Chagall. The five windows are 10 meters high and each has its own color theme. On the northern side is the red-orange “Prophet” window. On the eastern side, the windows are named “Jacob”, “Christ”, and “Zion”, from left to right. The south wall piece is called “Law”.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nReasonable entry fee and definitely worth stepping in to admire the lovely Marc Chagall stained glass windows.\n\nIncluded in the ticket is a very good audio guide that really brings the building and the 5 windows to life.\n\nTip:\n\nBe sure to bring Swiss francs as only cash is accepted.\n\nNO PHOTOS of the Marc Chagall windows allowed inside.\n\n3) Wasserkirche (Water Church)\n\nThe Water Church is another church with a long history in the city. The first mention of the church goes back to 1250. It was constructed on a small island in the Limmat River. The first church on the site was built in the 1100s and was reconstructed at various times. It was completely reconstructed in 1486.\n\nDuring the Reformation, the church was seen as a place of idolatry. The Reformation leader turned it into a secular use, specifically a library. In 1634 the church became the first public library in Zurich. In the 1800s, the island was connected to the riverbank. In 1917, the library that was housed in the church merged into the Central Library and the empty church became a place for storing crops.\n\nIn the 1940s, together with reconstruction work, some archaeological excavations took place. After the 1940s renovations were complete, the church building went back into religious use, specifically as the Evangelical-Reformed State Church of the Canton of Zurich.\n\nAside from its long history, the church is also known for standing on the site of where it is believed that two Patron Saints, Felix and Regula, were executed in the Middle Ages. Felix and Regula were siblings and members of a Roman military unit. Legend has it that Felix and Regula refused to particulate in the persecution of Christians. The Water Church site is where they were decapitated.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nHushed and intimate – a space for rest or meditation in the middle of an active day.\n\nThe Giacometti windows are a highlight, as is the crypt below.\n\n4) Grossmünster (Great Minster) (must see)\n\nThe Grossmunster Church stands proudly in Zurich, boasting a Romanesque architectural style and a rich historical background. Alongside the Fraumunster, Predigerkirche, and Saint Peterskirche, it forms one of the city's four major churches. Legend has it that the church's origins trace back to a commission by the Roman emperor Charles the Great, with construction beginning around 1100 and completion marked around 1220.\n\nNotably, the Grossmunster Church holds significance as the birthplace of the Swiss-German Reformation. In 1520, Huldrych Zwingli, a key figure in the Swiss Reformation movement, initiated reforms from his pastoral office within the church. Zwingli's debates, which he triumphed in before local authorities in 1523, led to the church's separation from papal authority.\n\nThe reforms spearheaded by Zwingli and later continued by Heinrich Bullinger left their mark on the church's interior. In 1524, iconoclastic actions saw the removal of religious imagery and the organ. These reforms went beyond aesthetics, impacting various aspects of religious practice including fasting traditions, the Mass, celibacy, and the use of church music. The Grossmunster Church thus stands as a pivotal site in the history of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nA statue of Emperor Charles the Great adorns the southern tower of the Grossmunster Church, commemorating his reign as Holy Roman Emperor from 771 to 814. Known for uniting much of Western and Central Europe, his legacy extends to language, with many European terms for \"king\" deriving from his name. The statue portrays Charles holding his sword, with his crown seemingly slipping from his head.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nFairly plain inside, but the sliced agate windows are some of the more interesting and colorful anywhere.\n\nThe old statue of Carolus Magnus is definitely worth seeing, and you can't miss the beautiful door as you go in.\n\nTip:\n\nA trip to the top of the tower is worth it if you can do 180+ steps straight up. The views are wonderful and you can stay as long as you wish."
