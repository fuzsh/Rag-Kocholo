        "text": "LOCATION:\n\nZürichbergstr. 221 , CH-8044 Zurich , Switzerland\n\nPhone: ++41 44 254 25 00\n\nURL: http://www.zoo.ch\n\nKEY WORDS\n\nEEP, high mountain\n\nANIMALS:\n\nFamily:Species:Common Name:Capacity: Felidae Uncia uncia snow leopard 1.1 with offspring or 1.2\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThe Himalayas serve as the uniting theme for the new exhibits which showcase Siberian tiger, Mongolian wolf, snow leopard, and red panda. The visitors are welcomed at an information plaza which is framed by stacked stone walls. Buddhist prayer flags are attached horizontally between four big stone piles. Theses symbols connect the exhibit to the culture of the region.\n\nOn the steep expanse, the enclosures were arranged according to the natural occurence of these high-mountain animals: Tiger and wolf below, red panda in the middle range, and snow leopard on top. Depending on precipitation, more or less clear water flows through the snow leopard enclosure, crosses the wolf enclosure next, and is finally received by the swimming pool of the tiger. Each enclosure displays a specific character introducing the visitors to the natural habitat of each animal species.\n\nOnly a few design elements were used to recreate the snow leopard habitat. The exhibit is dominated by rocks, scree, and cliffs and by the sparse vegetation typical for the region. A spattering of Himalaya birches, rhododendrons, knee pines and grasses support the image of a highland shaped by a harsh climate. The exhibit is fenced by three to four meters high shotcrete walls, as well as by 4 meters high fences with a one meter overhang, and glass and piano wires at the view points. The existing building was already in use as the snow leopard holding and was adapted.\n\nSIZE:\n\nThe total Himalaya Exhibit includes 7400m², with about 3250 m² for the public, 3450 m² for the outdoor exhibits, 230 m² for the buildings, and 470 m2 of miscellaneous areas.\n\nThe snow leopard enclosure includes an exhibit of about 700 m², a separate off-view enclosure of 180 m² and a shifting area of about 50 m². The holding building is about 70 m².\n\nSpace allocation in square metres:\n\nUse:Indoors:Outdoors:Total Exhibit: accessibletotalaccessibletotal animals visitors others total709301,000\n\nCOSTS:\n\nThe costs refer to the entire Himalaya area and include four exhibits.\n\nCHF 7,000,000 including 20% for design.\n\nOPENING DATE:\n\n11 April 2001\n\nDESIGN:\n\nBeginning: March 1997\n\nArchitect: Marc Ryf , Zurich\n\nCivil engineer: Peter Osterwalder , Oberneunforn\n\nElectrical engineer: Schmidiger + Rosasco AG , Zurich\n\nMedia, building services: Schudel + Schudel , Kollbrunn\n\nSite management, landscape architect: Vetsch, Nipkow Partner , Zurich\n\nCONSTRUCTION:\n\nBeginning: 21 April 1999\n\nHorticulture: A. + D. Berger, Kilchberg\n\nMetall works: Analp Metallbau AG, Zurich\n\nRockwork details: Bill Tolar, North Carolina, USA\n\nStatics: Diener AG, Zurich\n\nElektrical works: E. Burkhalter Ing. AG, Zurich\n\nMaster builder: K. Eicher, Bauunternehmung AG, Regensdorf\n\nRockwork: Laich SA, Avegno TI\n\nRockwork details: Mark Harney, New Hampshire,USA\n\nSanitary, Spenglerarbeiten, Bedachungen: Preisig AG, Zurich\n\nLOCAL CONDITIONS:\n\nThis is a climatic diagram for the closest weather station.\n\nPLANTS:\n\nAs the climatic conditions in Zurich are comparable to some height and vegetation strata in the Himalayas, plant species identical to the native habitat could be used, for example Himalaya birches, rhododendrons.\n\nSnow leopards live in the high mountain areas of the Himalayas. For that reason, the planting of the exhibit is sparse and dominated by small trees and dwarf and creeping bushes typical for alpine arid meadows.\n\nTo construct the rocky landscape, several trees were removed. Some were left to form the backdrop of the exhibit and augmented with birch trees and shrubs. Some of the brushes are protected by hot wire to prevent the animals hiding there. This way, the plants will stay dense and will continue to camouflage the fence that lies behind the plantings.\n\nThe plant list specifies the Latin names of the plants used for this exhibit.\n\nFEATURES DEDICATED TO ANIMALS:\n\nNiches and resting places for the animals are provided in the shotcrete rocks. In some locations, the rocks are very steep and challenging to climb. A rope is used to hang meat from one of the steep hills to offer an additional incentive for the animals to climb.\n\nOne of the drinkers in the exhibit is heated to prevent the water from freezing.\n\nSeveral metal boxes have electromagnetic locks and can be filled with food. The boxes are furnished with timed releases and open at different times of the day. This serves to enrich the animals which patrol the boxes regularly to get to the food.\n\nThe animals stay outside throughout the entire year, day and night, and are only confined to the holding areas during maintenance work in the exhibit. The outside holding areas and shifting cages are covered with mesh.\n\nFEATURES DEDICATED TO KEEPERS:\n\nThe holding building does not have a kitchen but has a heated break room for the keepers. It also holds two animal cages with two birthing dens each.\n\nNext to the exhibit are an off-view separation enclosure and a shifting area which connects to the two outside exhibits. The window into the separation enclosure is secured by mesh and does now offer a good view of the enclosure.\n\nTo provide a secure hold for the keepers on the steep terrain, four metal rings were embedded into the rock next to the entry gate.\n\nFEATURES DEDICATED TO VISITORS:\n\nTwo niches and a viewing platform offer the visitors views from different angles. The pathway to the two niches is wheelchair accessible; the platform is reached by stairs. None of the view points shows the entire enclosure, which lets the exhibit appear bigger and more natural.\n\nThe visitor areas are covered in rocks and visually connected to the animal exhibit. The bigger one of the niches is separated from the exhibit by piano wires and a low wood fence. Glass windows in different heights fulfill the same function at the smaller niche.\n\nThree heated rock caves and another heated resting place for the snow leopards are in comfortable view for the visitors. Additionally, a video monitor allows the visitor a view of the holding building when offspring is present. The feeding of the animals can be watched by the public when meat is secured by the rope on the cliff.\n\nINTERPRETATION:\n\nPaw prints on the pathway lead the visitors to the biggest view point. A panel depicts the habitat of the snow leopard. Signs with flaps explain the adaptations of the animals.\n\nMore about the biology and the individual animals, the visitors can learn from the typical Zoo Zurich signage. Among other things, the commonalities and differences between the house cat and the snow leopard are demonstrated. The signs inform the visitors about the dangers to the survival of the snow leopard, and the protection programs that the Zoo supports.\n\nMANAGEMENT:\n\nTwo separation enclosures of different sizes can be used as needed. The bigger one resembles in the design the public viewing exhibit. The holding building has four additional enclosures and a birthing den.\n\nThe animals are fed at irregular intervals and with changing amounts. The food is scattered over the entire area of the exhibit. The bigger pieces of meat can be hung from ropes to make them harder to reach for the animals.\n\nThe animals remain outside throughout the night. The holding area is not heated, with the exception of the break room for the keepers, and only used if an individual animal needs to be watched.\n\nRESEARCH:\n\nCONSERVATION:\n\nZoo Zuerich takes part in the EEP for snow leopards and supports the snow leopard fond in Mongolia. Also an employee in Kirgizstan is funded to advance the research and protection of the animals.\n\nLOCAL RESOURCES:\n\nThe construction of the rock and wood structures in the visitor areas were done by a local landscaper."
