        "text": "Road designations\n\nSo, if you are going on a trip and driving through Switzerland, you should know some important rules about the local road network. The system differs not only in terms of numbering from the network as it is known in country. There are also differences in terms of designations, speeds, and general traffic infrastructure. We have collected the most important information about the local infrastructure and created an overview with all details about the roads.\n\nThe Swiss road network explained\n\nWe mentioned earlier that there are several parties responsible for the country's road network in Switzerland. A large part of the responsibility still lies with the municipalities and cantons. However, since 1998, the Federal Roads Office (Astra) has also been considered an important authority for maintaining and expanding the national road network.\n\nIf you want to understand the system in Switzerland, you need to be aware of the following difference. As far as the country's transport infrastructure is concerned, a distinction is made between different types of roads. This means, for example, the motorways and motor roads that are part of the national road network, as well as cantonal road sections. The latter are, for the most part, shorter feeder roads to the motorways. We will cover the differences one by one later on in this article.\n\nHow many roads does Switzerland have?\n\nHow many roads there are in Switzerland in total is difficult to determine because of the different numbering and the division between national and cantonal roads. In addition, some stretches of roads are still under construction or not yet fully operational.\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that according to a survey in 2020, there are a total of 26 stretches of road that are officially considered national roads in the country.\n\nRoad Network Switzerland - Length & Infrastructure\n\nAs far as the length of all roads in Switzerland is concerned, the Federal Roads Office (Astra) has published the following data for the year 2022: The road network most recently consists of a network length of more than 84.600 kilometres. This means that the network covers one-third of the country's settlement area. Motorways occupy about 1500 kilometres, and cantonal roads about 17.200 kilometres. Compared with the road network, the Swiss rail network \"only\" covers about 5300 kilometres.\n\nIt is also impressive that the road network has grown by about 500 kilometres in the last year alone. This is an advance that illustrates why Switzerland's many routes are also able to hold their own in an international comparison.\n\nNational roads\n\nThe country's national roads include motorways, motor roads, and main roads. For a better overview, the routes were originally given an N number. Today, this designation is only used by the authorities and does not indicate which category the route in question belongs to. For this purpose, the A numbering of motorways and motor roads is used. In addition, they are subdivided into classes.\n\nCantonal roads\n\nAs you can already tell from the name, these routes lie under the responsibility of the respective canton. Among the cantonal roads, there are also motorways, motor roads, main roads, and secondary roads. For this reason, the distinction between the national roads is not always clear. Most of the routes are located near the centres of Bern, Zurich or Valais. One of the biggest differences between the national motorways and motor roads described above is that no vignette is required for the cantonal routes.\n\nSpeeds\n\nAn important piece of information about the road network is, of course, to pay attention to the speed limits on the motorways and motor roads. In contrast to country, a maximum speed limit on the motorways in Switzerland applies. This is 120 km/h for passenger car drivers - if not stated otherwise. On motor roads, the limit is 100 km/h. Outside of towns and municipalities, the maximum speed limit is 80 km/h, and inside built-up areas, the maximum speed limit is 50 km/h. For caravans or vehicles with trailers, other regulations may apply.\n\nObligation to pay tolls and have a vignette\n\nIn Switzerland, vignettes are compulsory on all national roads operated by the federal government. However, the principle behind this differs in some respects from what applies in surrounding countries.\n\nFor example, vignettes for different time periods are not available - in Switzerland, only a yearly vignette is available against payment of a flat fee (currently about 41 euros). Since 1 August 2023, it has been possible to buy the vignette for Switzerland digitally. Anyone who needs a vignette must visit the sales points near the border or pre-order it online via our platform.\n\nThere are currently only two places in Switzerland where a special toll is due. At the Great Saint Bernard and the Munt la Schera tunnel, additional fees are charged. With the revision of the system, this may change. For example, it is possible that a fee will soon have to be paid for the use of additional tunnels (for crossing the Alps). The neighbouring country of Austria, for example, with its special toll routes, could be considered a model for the changes."
