        "text": "Switzerland has four unevenly distributed languages and a wealth of dialects.\n\nGerman (62.6 %)\n\nGerman is by far the most widely spoken language in Switzerland: 19 of the country’s 26 cantons are predominantly (Swiss) German-speaking.\n\nFrench (22.9 %)\n\nFrench is spoken in the western part of the country, the \"Suisse Romande.\" Four cantons are French-speaking: Geneva, Jura, Neuchâtel and Vaud. Three cantons are bilingual: in Bern, Fribourg and Valais both French and German are spoken.\n\nItalian (8.2 %)\n\nItalian is spoken in Ticino and four southern valleys of Canton Graubünden.\n\nRhaeto-Rumantsch (0.5 %)\n\nRumantsch is spoken in the only trilingual canton, Graubünden. The other two languages spoken there are German and Italian. Rumantsch, like Italian and French, is a language with Latin roots. It is spoken by just 0.5% of the total Swiss population.\n\nOther languages (5.8 %)\n\nForeigners living in Switzerland also contribute to language diversity. There are more and more people in Switzerland whose mother tongue is not one of the four 'Swiss languages'."
