        "text": "The Zurich enclosure is a research facility – yet designed on principles that base on 18 years of meerkat observations combined with experience from meerkat keepers in several zoos. It intends to provide space for one meerkat group; according to Swiss regulations on animal welfare, the enclosure is spacious enough to hold 30 meerkats. However, the enclosure is also designed to accommodate species-specific behaviour that is as close as possible to natural conditions. For example:\n\nThe entire enclosure is filled with sand to allow for digging.\n\nIt contains logs and elevated spaces for sentinel behaviour; the inside area has ceiling windows.\n\nThere are three artificial burrows in the enclosure for the meerkats to rest and hide.\n\nThere are 5 heat lamps available for meerkats to keep warm also in winter.\n\nThe layout allows the separation of evicted females from the group while the dominant female is pregnant, thus reducing stress levels for the females and the group.\n\nThe chip-operated cat flaps between the indoor and outdoor areas allow for further separation in case this is needed.\n\nGeneral layout\n\nThe entire compound measures 266 square meters (approx. 320 square yards), and is divided into five main parts:"
