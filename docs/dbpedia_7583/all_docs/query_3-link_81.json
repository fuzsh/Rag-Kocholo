        "text": "The temperatures in this Swiss city largely differ from one another. The seasons are each fully operational and each one has its own charm. That’s why the best time is totally dependent on what you want out of the trip, but this Zurich itinerary will aid in your decision.\n\nThe thought of Switzerland is often attached to snow and icy conditions, but it doesn’t snow too much in Zurich contrary to widespread belief! The snow primarily occurs on Zurich’s backdrop – the Alps.\n\nIf you’re wondering when to visit Zurich in order to visit the snow in its surrounding mountains, the snow begins in late October and is at its deepest in mid-November. This makes November a great month to visit should you want to ski, but also because it is the least popular month to visit, with a very low tourism rate!\n\nThe Broke Backpacker is supported by you. Clicking through our links may earn us a small affiliate commission, and that's what allows us to keep producing free content 🙂 Learn more.\n\nSpring in Zurich (May), is often more celebrated than Summer and is usually the busiest time of year. Yet, a mixture of humidity and temperatures actually give Spring quite a cold feel!\n\nThe city does indeed warm-up in Summer, with more outdoor activities in the hinterland being opened. However, the snow does reduce in these months and skiing is not as likely.\n\nOne commonality and advantage of the positioning of the city is that it never has strong winds! Rather, its maximum sustained winds are subtle breezes. This is ideal for every season.\n\nZurich is a city of many diverse characteristics. It is a major city with a beautiful backdrop of luscious green scenery, interconnected with a river and a lake. It also home to many varying suburbs, some regarded as ‘districts’. Each suburb is distinct and is suitable for different types of travelers!\n\nAs for many historical European cities, the Old Town is always the preferred area to stay in. That sentiment maintains for this Zurich itinerary. This is due to its ancient architecture that has been maintained, and it’s typically luxurious interiors.\n\nHowever, due to Zurich’s high-prices, accommodation is costly too – particularly in the Old Town (District 1). This means the Old Town is suitable for high-end travelers who want to be located near all the historical Zurich attractions. In terms of convenience, it is probably the best place to stay in Zurich in 3 days.\n\nYet, the further you deviate from the central old town, accommodation prices lower and you’ll be closer to the local residences. District 2, Enge, is already calmer and based on the banks of Lake Zurich, boasting stunning promenades. Historically this used to be a Jewish residence.\n\nFor younger travelers on a vacation in Zurich, this Zurich itinerary suggests that you stay in District 4. It is the most residential of the suburbs and you’ll gain a local experience of the city. Moreover, you’ll be in the District with the largest night-life scene! This is the perfect district to stay in if you’re youthful and spending the weekend in Zurich.\n\nBest Hostel in Zurich – Old Town Hostel Otter\n\nA young addition in the heart of the old town, this youthful hostel boasts being on top of a popular cafe/bar – Wueste! Here you can mingle with locals and tourists alike!\n\nA free breakfast is provided too. Yet, we particularly love how conveniently situated it is in relation to clubs, restaurants and Zurich landmarks!\n\nIf you enjoy staying in hostels, check out the BEST hostels in Zurich.\n\nBest Airbnb in Zurich – Modern studio with a killer location\n\nThis home away from home is just a five minute walk from all the central train terminals. Throw in the wifi, air conditioning, and coffee machine and you’re in for a treat. The two-tone colours won’t look bad on your social media feed either.\n\nBest Budget Hotel in Zurich – Homestay Zurich City\n\nValue for money is always affixed to budgeting, and at this hotel, you’ll save immensely on transport costs by being in the epicenter of social life! Situated in the Old Town, this quaint hotel even offers free parking for guests, saving you even more!\n\nSpeedy WiFi, spacious wooden-floored rooms, free toiletries and city views mean this hotel has all the necessities!\n\nBest Luxury Hotel in Zurich – Lake Side Location Bellevue\n\nWhen visiting cities occupied by a lot of water, your instinct would be to stay near it! At these double-story luxury apartments, you are only 100-meters from the river and still within the heart of Zurich’s Old Town. Each flat looks onto the water, city and mountains. Some apartments are double-storey, but all have balconies.\n\nZurich’s transportation is operated by the Zurich Transport Network (ZVV). It is one of the safest places to visit worldwide, therefore walking and biking are very suitable here! In fact, Zurich locals have bikes to be ridden for free by tourists or other locals. This is especially popular in the Old Town. However, for maximum timeliness and comfort, it is suggested that you utilize public transport systems too.\n\nZurich is accessed through routes taken up by trams, buses and trains. These routes and stations/stops are densely planned, and you’ll never be more than 300-meters away from a tram station!\n\nOne mode of transport you’ll have to deliberate about using is a car. While it is certainly unnecessary to drive within the city due to extensive public transport modes, a car is very useful for this particular Zurich itinerary! This is due to the fact that any vacation in Zurich consists of a visit to the Alps.\n\nYes, certain mountain and ski resorts can be reached by public transport, but the ones that we suggest are only reachable by car. However, you’ll thank us once you behold the views.\n\nWhether you’re planning to spend 2 days in Zurich, or 2 weeks, for purposes of this Zurich trip itinerary we suggest you invest in either the Swiss Travel Pass or the Zurich Card, which both permit buyers to free public transport all over Zurich.\n\nWant to save money on accommodation?\n\nWe got you. For reals.\n\nBahnhofstrasse | Giacometti Murals | Lindenh of Hill | Lindt Swiss Chocolate Experience | Seebad Enge\n\nOn your very first day of this Zurich itinerary, we’ve combined history, food and nature. This Zurich itinerary suggests various naturistic sites – but that doesn’t mean that the city itself doesn’t have lots to offer. It is a multi-faceted gastronomical city too!\n\nDay 1 / Stop 1 – Stroll Down Bahnhofstrasse\n\nWhy it’s awesome: It is one of the world’s most expensive shopping avenues!\n\nCost: Free to window-shop!\n\nFood nearby: You have to get a world-famous macaron from Confiserie Sprungli on the avenue!\n\nIf you’re an avid window-shopper, then live your opulent fantasy by simply walking down Europe’s most expensive street for retail property! High-end, upscale brands such as Gucci, Chanel and Dior operate here, and you’ll begin touring Zurich here! Pedestrian and tourist shopping has never been easier because there is virtually no traffic circulation here!!\n\nYet that is not all that the boulevard presents as famed chocolate stores are dispersed throughout. This isn’t only a tourist hotspot, but locals adore it too!\n\nWhat makes this shopping avenue unique in comparison to its global rivals is its boastful length of almost 1.5 kilometers! It begins at Zurich’s Main Station and finishes at Lake Zurich. You’ll always be near one of the Zurich points of interest, but you’ll also constantly be walking a few roads away from, and adjacent to, the Limmat River!\n\nDay 1 / Stop 2 – Giacometti Murals\n\nWhy it’s awesome: It’s by far the prettiest police station you’ll ever see!\n\nCost: Free!\n\nFood nearby: Enjoy a complimentary vegan cookie with any hot-drink you buy at the rooftop terrace, vegetarian Hiltl Dachterrasse!\n\nTypically, police stations are characterized by somber tones, but not in Zurich! Augusto Giacometti was appointed in 1923 to illuminate and lighten up the vaulted ceiling of a municipal building with his skilled painting.\n\nYou may feel a bit anxious and strange visiting a police station on your first day, however fear not! Switzerland is one of the safest countries in the world, and you’ll encounter no problems.\n\nEmerging from a dynasty of talented artists, Giacometti incorporated bright, warm colors to create floral decorations and scenic images. The vaulted ceiling became part of the entrance to the building and today is esteemed as an important Zurich attraction.\n\nIt took Giacometti two years to complete this masterpiece. Augusto possessed the deepest passion and love for Zurich. His mural work in the entrance to the police station is his most well-known work, but we recommend you visit some of his other monuments should you have time.\n\nAlthough the admission cost is free, be sure to look at the opening hours in advance as they are often brief intervals. Make sure you bring your ID Card as that is your form of payment.\n\nInsider Tip: If you have a moment to spare between Stops 2 and 3, we recommend you walk 5 minutes across the river to another work of Giacometti. He conjured a stained-glass window for the Fraumünster Church in 1945 and its close proximity to the police station begs for it to be viewed!\n\nDay 1 / Stop 3 – Lindenhof Hill\n\nWhy it’s awesome: It is here where the earliest record of Zurich’s name was found on a 2nd century tombstone\n\nCost: Free!\n\nFood nearby: Treat yourself to a lovely Swiss/Central European lunch at Restaurant Schipfe 16.\n\nDid you know that Zurich has 6 different ways of spelling within Switzerland? Were you aware that the country has four official national languages?\n\nAlthough Zurich natives are mainly German-tongued, the city is home to many French, Italian, and Romansh speakers too. What makes the city even more interesting is how these different cultures spell Zurich differently!\n\nThere is much more to do in this historical, Zurich landmark! Given that it is a hill, you will have wonderful views of the Limmat River, as well as of Old Town! You’ll have to walk up a few stairs to get there, but it’s worth it.\n\nDay 1 / Stop 4 – LINDT Swiss Chocolate Experience\n\nWhy it’s awesome: It is a tasting experience that evokes all 5 senses and is the original birthplace of Lindt!\n\nCost: $16.\n\nFood nearby: If you’re sick of chocolate, head down to Hiltl am See for some pleasant views of the lake with delicious food!\n\nA trip to Switzerland would simply not suffice without paying tribute to its creation of milk chocolate! On your vacation in Zurich, you’ll even notice how the Swiss eat more chocolate than anywhere else on earth!\n\nAnd there’s a reason for this – Zurich is the epicenter of chocolate manufacturing, as well as the home to the globe’s most beloved Chocolate-producer, Lindt! Only a 15-minute bus ride away from Zurich (via the 165 Bus), the Lindt factory tour is an imperative activity on our list. One of THE things to do in Zurich is to sample the delicious sweet stuff for yourself.\n\nAny avid chocolate eater will have each of their 5 senses enriched even before entering, as the aromas linger in the surrounding areas. The tour will take 40-minutes of your day and will include a movie, a brief lesson on the constituents and processes involved in the Lindt chocolate-making, and finally a tasting of up to 30 different chocolates!\n\nYou’ll even be able to buy these chocolates at a price marked down from its original market value. This is because at the end of the tour, you’ll receive a 10% discount from the shop!\n\nInsider Tip: At an extra cost, they provide special packaging that prohibits the chocolate from melting, and to be able to be enjoyed once you get home too!\n\nDay 1 / Stop 5 – Sunset Swims and Drinks at Seebad Enge\n\nWhy it’s awesome: It boasts a bar, mini-restaurant and swimming all in one!\n\nCost: $8\n\nFood nearby: The kiosk has a simple bar and barbeque area that will satisfy your hunger with fresh produce.\n\nChances are that the last thing you feel like doing is taking off your shirt and exposing a newly found stomach after that chocolate-tasting. That’s the exact reason we’ve chosen for you to reflect on the most exciting day in a swimming area that is both mixed and separated by gender.
