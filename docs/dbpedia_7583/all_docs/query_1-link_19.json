        "text": "Standard atmosphere with reference to aviation\n\nAll pilots, whether of hot air balloons, gliders, hang gliders or commercial aircraft, use the same references in flight. To avoid collisions, it is essential that they all use the same settings for their altimeters. With this in mind, an internationally applicable standard atmosphere has been defined, called the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). The following reference values apply to the ISA:\n\nA reference pressure at sea level of 1,013.25 hPa;\n\nA pressure decrease with increasing altitude per hPa of 28 ft corresponding to 8.5 m per 1 hPa (1 ft = 0.3 m).\n\nPressure fluctuations at ground level\n\nIn reality, the pressure field on the ground and at altitude very much depends on the current meteorological conditions. Low-pressure areas tend to be associated with low air pressure (below 1013.25 hPa), while high-pressure areas tend to have high air pressure (above 1013.25 hPa). The air pressure can fluctuate widely along the flight path of a commercial aircraft, which usually extends over hundreds or even thousands of kilometres. Pilots therefore use a common reference pressure to ensure their vertical separation during cruise flight. Otherwise, the values displayed by their altimeters would not be comparable: Two aircraft with different pressure settings might fly much closer together on a vertical plane than the readings from their altimeters would suggest.\n\nThe flight levels\n\nSummary\n\nSo that the altitude measured by the altimeters during cruise flight show the same values in all aircraft and thus ensure vertical separation between them, pilots must set their altimeters as if the pressure at sea level were a constant 1,013.25 hPa.\n\nAlthough flying with this reference setting ensures the vertical separation of the aircraft, the actual altitude off the ground varies. This is determined during take-off and landing below a specified transition altitude by adjusting the altimeter to the current air pressure of the airport (abbreviated as QNH). (Definition of this term on page about air pressure)\n\nFlying at high altitudes above the ground in cruise flight does not require significant altitude accuracy, so pilots fly with the default setting of 1,013.25 hPa (QNE).\n\nDuring the initial climb or approach phase, when the altitude is closer to the ground, the altimeters are set to the QNH of the airfield where they intend to take off or land. The switch between QNH and QNE occurs at a fixed transition altitude that maintains a minimum distance from the terrain. If the flight level during cruise flight is below the transition altitude, then QNH is used for the altimeter setting in cruise flight, and the altimeter is adjusted at each sector change.\n\nFlight levels and MeteoSwiss\n\nMeteoSwiss calculates the true altitudes of FL100 and FL180 in Geneva and FL140 in Zurich every three hours on the basis of measurements from the Jungfraujoch and Gütsch weather stations, and radiosondes from Payerne and Novara. The values are used by Skyguide’s air traffic controllers to determine which flight levels can be used for Alpine crossings and which are too low.\n\nThe graph below shows the development of the 700-hPa geopotential surface measured at three weather stations from 12 to 13 October 2020. We see here that the height of the geopotential surface has decreased considerably (by approximately 50 metres) as a result of a broadening of the low-pressure axis aloft. As a result of this change in atmospheric conditions, the flight levels decrease."
