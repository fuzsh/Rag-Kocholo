The lowest point of the city is on the banks of the river Limmat, at 392 metres above sea-level, while the highest – the peak of the Uetliberg mountain – is 871 metres. The water table of Lake Zürich is 405.94 metres above sea-level.\n\nZürich is the largest city in Switzerland with a population of over 428'700, an increase of 19'500 since year 2000. 1,4 million people live in Zürich agglomeration. By the end of 2018, 32% of the city's population was made up of non-Swiss from a total of 172 different countries, all of whom help to make up Zürich's multi-cultural character. 6% of all foreigners who move to Switzerland come to the City of Zürich, emphasizing its central role as an economic hub. Germans make up the largest group with 33'579 living in the city, followed by Italians with 15'080 and Portuguese with 7'826.\n\nOne out of every eleven jobs in Switzerland is in the City of Zürich. The financial sector generates around a quarter of the city's economic output and provides approximately 59'000 full-time equivalent jobs (16% of all employment in the City). The creative economy accounts for about 39'000 employees or for eleven percent of jobs in the City.\n\nSome 122 hotel companies with 15'800 beds at their disposal provide 3,4 million overnight stays every year, while Zürich airport looks after around 20 million passengers. Zürich central station is one of Europe's main railway intersections, used by almost 500'000 passengers every day."
