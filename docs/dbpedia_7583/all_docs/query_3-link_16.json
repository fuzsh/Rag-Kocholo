        "meta_description": "Abstract. Improving the understanding of the health and climate impacts of aerosols remains challenging and is restricted by the limitations of current\nmeasurement techniques. Detailed investigation of secondary organic aerosolÂ (SOA), which is typically the dominating fraction of the organic aerosolÂ (OA), requires instrumentation capable of real-time, in situ measurements of molecular composition. In this study, we present the first ambient measurements by a novel extractive electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometerÂ (EESI-TOF-MS). The EESI-TOF-MS was deployed along with a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometerÂ (HR-ToF-AMS) during summerÂ 2016 at an urban location (Zurich, Switzerland). Positive matrix factorizationÂ (PMF), implemented within the Multilinear EngineÂ (ME-2), was applied to the data from both instruments to quantify the primary and secondary contributions toÂ OA. From the EESI-TOF-MS analysis, a six-factor solution was selected as the most representative and interpretable solution for the investigated dataset, including two primary and four secondary factors. The primary factors are dominated by cooking and cigarette smoke signatures while the secondary factors are discriminated according to their daytime (two factors) and night-time (two factors) chemistry. All four factors showed strong influence by biogenic emissions but exhibited significant dayânight differences. Factors dominating during daytime showed predominantly ions characteristic of monoterpene and sesquiterpene oxidation while the night-time factors included less oxygenated terpene oxidation products, as well as organonitrates which were likely derived from NO3 radical oxidation of monoterpenes. Overall, the signal measured by the EESI-TOF-MS and AMS showed a good correlation. Further, the two instruments were in excellent agreement in terms of both the mass contribution apportioned to the sum of POA and SOA factors and the total SOA signal. However, while the oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) factors separated by AMS analysis exhibited a flat diurnal pattern, the EESI-TOF-MS factors illustrated significant chemical variation throughout the day. The captured variability, inaccessible from AMS PMF analysis, was shown to be consistent with the variations in the physiochemical processes influencing chemical composition and SOA formation. The improved source separation and interpretability of EESI-TOF-MS results suggest it to be a promising approach to source apportionment and atmospheric composition research.",

        "text": "3.1âAMSÂ PMF\n\nFigureÂ S1 shows time series of the species concentrations measured by the AMS over the full period of measurements. The organic mass dominates NR-PM1 with a contribution of 74â% compared to only a 26â% contribution from inorganic mass. The total measured organic mass reached a maximum concentration of â¼30âÂµgâmâ3 during the measurement period, with an average concentration of â¼3âÂµgâmâ3. We note evidence of both long-term events and short-term spikes. We selected a five-factor unconstrained PMF solution containing three primary and two secondary factors. The primary factors consisted of hydrocarbon-like organicÂ (HOA) related to traffic, cooking-related organic aerosolÂ (COA), and a cigarette-smoke-related factorÂ (CS-OA). The secondary factors were separated by their oxygen content, which has been empirically related to volatility (Jimenez et al., 2009), and are classified here as less-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosolÂ (LO-OOA) and more-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosolÂ (MO-OOA) (Zhang et al., 2011). The five-factor solution was preferred because the four-factor solution was not able to separate the HOA and COA factors, while the six-factor solution added an additional OOA factor with a noisy time series for which no physical interpretation could be found. Higher-order solutions with up to 10 factors likewise yielded no additional interpretable factors. FigureÂ 1 shows the mass spectra of the five-factor solution with ions colour-coded according to their chemical family (CxHy, CxHyOz, CxHyNp, CxHyOzNp, HyOz, and âotherâ, which includes CxOy, Cx, Oy, and sulfur-containing ions). The factor time series and diurnal patterns are shown in the Supplement (Fig.Â S3). The dominant source in mass is LO-OOA, especially during the period with higher temperature, followed by MO-OOA. Specific local events are instead dominated by the primary sources.\n\nThe HOA factor is related to fossil fuel combustion, mainly from traffic emissions. These emissions are typically dominated by engine-lubricating oil and consist mainly of n-alkanes, branched alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics, leading to high signal of the ions CnH2n+1+ and CnH2n-1+ (Ng et al., 2011). Prominent contributions of non-oxygenated species at mâzâ 43 (C3H7+ ), mâzÂ 55 (C4H7+ ) and mâzÂ 57 (C4H9+ ) can be observed. Similar to the results of other studies (e.g. Lanz et al., 2007a,Â b; Ulbrich et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011) HOA exhibits temporal correlations with primary vehicular emissions tracers, such as elemental carbon from trafficÂ (ECtr) and NOx (Zhang et al., 2005).\n\nThe COA factor is similar to HOA in that a large fraction of the signal is contributed by CxHy+ ions. However, COA has distinctive mass spectral features, typical of the fragmentation of fatty acids. Characteristic peaks include C3H3O+ at mâzÂ 55, C3H5O+ at mâzÂ 57, and higher-molecular-weight oxygenated fragments: C5H8O+ (mâzÂ 84), C6H10O+ (mâzÂ 98), and C7H12O+ (mâzÂ 112). In addition, the COA and HOA factors could be differentiated on the basis of the signal ratio of C3H3O+ to C3H5O+ as the COA spectrum tends to show a substantially higher mâzÂ 55 to mâzÂ 57 ratio (Mohr et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2011). Reliable molecular tracers of cooking emissions are not typically available, but Fig.Â S3b shows a diurnal pattern with significant peaks during mealtimes, consistent with previous studies.\n\nThe CS-OA factor is related to a cigarette smoke signature and the profile is similar to previously reported smoking-related factors measured at Jungfraujoch (FrÃ¶hlich et al., 2015) and a German soccer stadium (Faber et al., 2013). Similar to HOA and COA, the profile includes a strong contribution from CxHy+ , but for CS-OA is shifted towards less saturated ions (branched and n-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and alcohols). Relevant signal can be observed at mâzÂ 41 (C3H5+ ) and mâzÂ 43 (C3H7+ and C2H3O+) and also fragments from aromatic compounds at mâzÂ 77 (C6H5+ ), 91Â (C7H7+ ), 105Â (C8H9+ ) and 119Â (C9H11+ ). In addition, this factor is unique in having a significant contribution from C5H10N+ (mâzÂ 84), which has been attributed to n-methyl-pyrrolidine, a tracer for cigarette smoke (Struckmeier et al., 2016). Furthermore, the CS-OA factor exhibits a significantly higher N:C ratioÂ (0.02) compared to the other factors (ranging fromÂ 0.003 toÂ 0.01) and explains most of the organic nitrogen signal.\n\nFinally, the OOA factors are characterized by a very high contribution of the signal at mâzÂ 44 (CO2+ ), typical of AMS SOA profiles. The LO-OOA spectrum is characterized by prominent peaks at mâzÂ 43 (C2H3O+) and mâzÂ 28 (CO+). It resembles LO-OOA factors determined in previous studies at urban sites, as well as newly formed aerosol from forest emissions and biogenic SOA from chamber studies (Zhang et al., 2007; Lanz et al., 2007a,Â b; Ulbrich et al., 2009; Hao et al., 2009, 2014; Kiendler-Scharr et al., 2009; Ng et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2010). LO-OOA has an atomic O:C ratio ofÂ 0.40 (consistent with the global average of LO-OOA of 0.35Â±0.14; Ng et al., 2010) while the second OOA factor, MO-OOA, is more oxidized with an O:C ratio ofÂ 0.50. The mass spectrum of the latter is dominated by mâzÂ 44 (CO2+ ) and mâzÂ 28 (CO+). The profile is similar to MO-OOA factors reported at various locations, including urban areas and the boreal forest (Allan et al., 2006; Ulbrich et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2010; Raatikainen et al., 2010; Hao et al., 2014). Overall, LO-OOA includes less oxygenated and possibly freshly oxidized species while MO-OOA includes highly oxygenated species. Furthermore, the LO-OOAâââMO-OOA ratio is higher, particularly on days with higher OOA concentration, which in turn correspond to sunny weather and warmer temperatures. The strong correlation of this factor with local ambient temperature indicates that LO-OOA is rather locally formed and possibly linked with SOA formed from the oxidation of biogenic emissions (Fig.Â S5). Similar findings have been reported by Canonaco et al.Â (2015) at the same site for summer OA measured by an aerosol chemical speciation monitorÂ (ACSM). During summer afternoons, when photochemical processes are most vigorous, the formation of semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) is enhanced compared to low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LVOOA) formation, which typically occurs on a timescale of hours. This is likely due to the formation of semi-volatile oxygenated aerosol produced from biogenic precursor gases, especially monoterpenes, whose emissions increase with ambient temperature.\n\nThe diurnal patterns of these two factors are flatter than the POA factors, however the LO-OOA concentrations started increasing from early morning, most likely due to condensation of semi-volatile species and fresh formation of OOA due to photochemistry. Afterwards this factor continuously decreased, possibly due to boundary layer expansion and photochemical conversion to MO-OOA (Fig.Â 4). However, the LO-OOA concentration remained significantly higher than other primary emissions which suggests that LO-OOA probably forms from the oxidation of primary emissions and/or continued conversion of less oxidized gas-phase products into the particle phase. Furthermore, a correlation between the concentrations of LO-OOA and nitrateÂ (NO3) was observed (R=0.47). Particulate nitrate also represents semi-volatile secondary species, which share similarity with LO-OOA in terms of volatility and its partitioning behaviour with temperature while the MO-OOA time series are is correlated with sulfateÂ (SO4) (R=0.6), representing a less volatile fraction and suggesting that MO-OOA is related to longer-lived aged regional SOA (Lanz et al., 2007a,Â b). Overall, the LO-OOA and MO-OOA components account for 46â% and 25â% of the total organic aerosol mass observed, respectively, dominating the totalÂ OA concentration. Due to the extent of fragmentation occurring in the AMS system, it was not possible to gain any more information about SOA sources apart from their oxygenationâvolatility pattern. The inclusion in the analysis of more highly detailed chemical composition, provided by the new EESI-TOF-MS system, allowed us to distinguish, with more detail, the SOA processes of formation and oxidation pathways, as outlined in the following.\n\n3.2âEESI-TOFÂ PMF\n\n3.2.1âSelection and overview of the solution\n\nWe present in the following a PMF analysis on the first-ever ambient EESI-TOF-MS data. As discussed in the previous section, PMF analysis of AMS data indicates SOA to be the dominant component but does not provide any direct chemical information indicating the SOA sources. In contrast, PMF analysis of EESI-TOF-MS data yielded several organic aerosol factors related to secondary OAÂ formation. Factors were separated according to different mass spectral fingerprints and ageing processes for a total of six factors including both POA and SOA. The six-factor solution presented throughout the text is the averaged solution among 795Â accepted bootstrap runs (out of 1000Â total). The bootstrap analysis is discussed in detail in Sect.Â 3.2.5 and is based around random selection of the aÂ value constraints on the profile of a cooking-related factorÂ (COAEESI) (with a values selected in the rangeÂ 0 toÂ 0.1, with a step size ofÂ 0.1), with the COAEESI anchor profile constrained using the cleaner cooking-related factor profile retrieved in the seven-factor solution. Critically, we consider all solutions classified as being reasonable and unmixed (according to the evaluation in Sect.Â 3.2.5) to be of equal merit. Therefore the base case solution represents only a single, quasi-randomly selected solution out of this large set (rather than an optimized solution), and we consider the average of all acceptable solutions to be the best representation of the source apportionment analysis.\n\nAn overview of the factor profiles, time series, and diurnal patterns is presented in Figs.Â 2â4, respectively. Note that the diurnal pattern presented in Fig.Â 4 refers to the entire measurement period while Fig.Â S4 shows the diurnal patterns for the same factors calculated for only the overlapping measurement period between EESI-TOF-MS and AMS. We observed two primary factors: cooking-relatedÂ OAÂ (COAEESI) and cigarette-smoke-relatedÂ OAÂ (CS-OAEESI). Four SOA factors were resolved: two daytime SOA factorsÂ (DaySOA1EESI andÂ DaySOA2EESI) and two night-time factorsÂ (NightSOA1EESI andÂ NightSOA2EESI). Each factor is described in further detail in the following sections.\n\nA common criterion used to assess the selection of the number of factors is the examination ofÂ QâQexp for an increasing number of solution factors to evaluate the fraction of explained variation in the data. For unconstrained solutions, the QâQexpÂ value decreased smoothly fromÂ 5.4 toÂ 4.0 as the number of factors increased from 2 to 10, providing little insight into the optimal number of factors. The six-factor solution was chosen after constraining the cleaner cooking profile retrieved from the seven-factor solution within the bootstrap analysis (Sect.Â 3.2.5). The solution with one factor fewer provided a mixed primary emissions factor, while the seven-factor solution resulted in an additional non-interpretable splitting of the daytime SOA (as did higher-order solutions).\n\nFigureÂ 4 shows the diurnal patterns of all individual factors as well as of the sum of all four SOA factors from the EESI-TOF-MS analysis and sum of the two OOA factors from the AMS analysis. The pattern of the sum of all SOA factors is basically flat. However, each individual SOA factor exhibits strong and distinctive variation. The diurnal pattern of DaySOA1EESI exhibits a factor of 2 enhancement in signal between 15:00Â and 21:00âLT while the DaySOA2EESI exhibits the same magnitude of enhancement in signal around 12:00âLT without a consistent decrease before 01:00âLT. This shift in time between the two factors could reflect gradients in composition according to lifetime of the compounds, production time, partitioning, and reactive environment. Concerning the diurnal pattern, NightSOA1EESI peaks during the night between 22:00Â and 05:00âLT while NightSOA2EESI is elevated in the early morning between 04:00âLT and noon, corroborating the shift in chemistry with daytime oxidants also being available.\n\n3.2.2âPrimary factors (COAEESI and CS-OAEESI)\n\nThe COAEESI mass spectrum is dominated by long-chain fatty acids and alcohols, which are typical of cooking emissions (Liu et al., 2017). For example, C18H32O3 (coronaric acid, mâzÂ 319.2), C18H34O2 (oleic acid, mâzÂ 305.2), and C16H30O3 (2-oxo-tetredecanoic acid, mâzÂ 293.2) are prominent and contribute 2.1â%, 1.7â%, and 1.5â%, respectively, to the overall profile signal. The variability of these ions is also dominated by the cooking source. Another prominent peak in the spectrum, accounting for 0.7â% of the signal, is C6H10O5 (mâzÂ 185), which is attributed to levoglucosan and commonly used as an indicator for primary aerosols originating from biomass combustion (Hennigan et al., 2010; Giannoni et al., 2012) as it is derived from the pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose. The study from Bertrand et al.Â (2018) shows C6H10O5 (mâzÂ 185) to be a very prominent peak in the EESI-TOF-MS mass spectrum of fresh wood burning emissions. Further, the EESI-TOF-MS is probably more sensitive to levoglucosan than to bulk SOA (Lopez-Hilfiker et al., 2019). During this study, levoglucosan is likely emitted from open cooking activities in the vicinity of the measurement site.\n\nThe COAEESI and COAAMS factor time series are well correlated (R=0.65) during the overlapping measurement period (20Â to 27Â June) (Fig.Â 3), with both showing clear peaks at lunchtime and dinner time (Figs.Â 4 andÂ S4).\n\nThe CS-OAEESI mass spectrum is dominated by C10H14N2 (nicotine, mâzÂ 163.12) and C6H10O5 (levoglucosan), which contribute 15â% and 10â%, respectively, to the profile signal. Levoglucosan is also a known product of pyrolysis of simple sugars present in tobacco (Talhout et al., 2006). Other prominent signals occur at mâzÂ 197.04 (C7H10O5), 199.09Â (C7H12O5), 203.1Â (C6H12O6, glucose), 215.05Â (C7H12O6), 227.05Â (C8H12O6), and 313.05Â (C7H14O12). The CS-OAEESI shows strong correlation with the AMS factors traffic (HOAAMS, R=0.6) and cigarette smoke (CS-OAAMS, R=0.73). The correlation further improves when considering the two sources together (R=0.77) suggesting a certain extent of mixing of the two sources within the same factor. The discrimination of a separate factor related solely to traffic was not possible, even investigating solutions with a higher number of factors, where only additional non-interpretable secondary sources were discriminated. The inability of the EESI-TOF-MS to resolve a clear traffic-related factor is likely due to the insensitivity of the instrument to the hydrocarbons dominating these emissions (Sect.Â 3.3). The diurnal pattern of CS-OAEESI shows a peak during the evening between 21:00Â and 23:00âLT, during which the courtyard in which the measurement site is located is typically more crowded. Overall, as expected, the primary factors show low O:C ratios ofÂ 0.38 andÂ 0.43 and high H:C ratios ofÂ 1.75 andÂ 1.7 for COAEESI and CS-OAEESI, respectively.\n\n3.2.3âSecondary daytime factors\n\nTwo daytime SOA factorsÂ (DaySOA1EESI andÂ DaySOA2EESI) were resolved from the EESI-TOF-MS PMF analysis (Fig.Â 2), both of which contain strong signatures of terpene oxidation products.\n\nProminent monoterpene-derived ions in the DaySOA2EESI factor profile include mâzÂ 239.09 (C10H16O5), 255.08Â (C10H16O6), and 271.079Â (C10H16O7) while other peaks are tentatively identified as sesquiterpene oxidation products, i.e. mâzÂ 275.16 (C15H24O3), 307.15Â (C15H24O5), and 325.162Â (C15H26O6). The latter species could also be dimers from monoterpenes/isoprene oxidation products. However, the absence of signal from C19 and C20 compounds suggests that dimer concentrations are low in Zurich. This may be due to suppression of dimerization by NOx (Yan et al., 2016; KÃ¼rten et al., 2016) and is consistent with the dimer fraction here being low compared to that observed in the Finnish boreal forest and with both ambient measurements being lower than that of Î±-pinene ozonolysis in a NOx-free simulation chamber (Pospisilova et al., 2019). Thus, we believe that the above-mentioned species are likely related to sesquiterpene oxidation products. Overall, the C10H16Oz series accounts for 6.2â% of the total profile signal for DaySOA1EESI and 5.3â% for DaySOA2EESI (2.5â%, 2â%, 4.4â%, and 5.1â% for COAEESI, CS-OAEESI, NightSOA1EESI, and NightSOA2EESI) while the C15H24â28Oz series accounts for 1â% of the total profile signal for DaySOA1EESI and 2.3â% for DaySOA2EESI. Furthermore, other significant series of compounds are present including (C9H14Oz) accounting for 5.8â% and 5.2â%, (C7H10Oz) accounting for 4.7â% and 3.5â%, and (C8H12Oz) accounting for 6.4â% and 5.6â% of the total profile signal for DaySOA1EESI and for DaySOA2EESI.\n\nThe two DaySOAEESI factor spectra are compared in more detail in Fig.Â 5a, with the carbon number distribution shown in Fig.Â 5b. DaySOA1EESI is more shifted towards ions with lowerÂ mâz and carbon number. These species with fewer than 10Â carbon atoms can represent fragmentation products from terpene oxidation either in the gas phase (Molteni et al., 2019) followed by condensation or during ageing in the condensed phase (Pospisilova et al., 2019). However, fragmentation results in products progressively more difficult to distinguish from ring-opening products from the oxidation of aromatic precursors, and therefore we cannot rule out a contribution to these ions from aromatic oxidation products. DaySOA2EESI is instead shifted towards higher masses with a carbon atom number typical of sesquiterpene oxidation products and/or dimerization. Overall the two secondary daytime factors show a high apparent O:C ratio ofÂ 0.63 andÂ 0.58 and similar apparent H:C ratios ofÂ 1.64 andÂ 1.66 for DaySOA1EESI and DaySOA2EESI, respectively, consistent with the expected values for biogenic precursors of SOA, which exhibit an H:C ratio fromÂ 1.2 toÂ 1.7 (Daellenbach et al., 2019) and specifically monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes with a H:C ratio ofÂ 1.6.\n\nThe two daytime SOA factors exhibit not only different chemistry but also a different dependency on ambient temperature. FigureÂ 6 shows the correlation of the two daytime SOA factors with the hourly ambient temperature. While DaySOA1EESI does not show a clear dependency on temperature DaySOA2EESI increases exponentially with temperature, consistent with known relationships for terpene emissions and biogenic aerosol in terpene-dominated regions (Leaitch et al., 2011; Vlachou et al., 2018). This supports the interpretation of DaySOA2EESI as a factor related to local oxidation of biogenic VOCs and DaySOA1EESI as a factor related to more aged or regional air masses. FigureÂ S5 shows the equivalent relation with temperature for the AMS secondary factors; we note that LO-OOAAMS exhibits an exponential increase with temperature similar to the DaySOA2EESI but with a weaker correlation, suggesting mixing of the two factors identified by the EESI-TOF-MS and possibly also with other sources not related to biogenic emissions. The time series DaySOA1EESI shows a correlation with MO-OOAAMS (R=0.54), which typically represents less volatile and more aged/regional, secondary organic aerosol compounds. An even higher correlation is observed between DaySOA2EESI and LO-OOAAMS (R=0.91), where LO-OOAAMS is believed to represent semi-volatile and more freshly produced secondary organic aerosol compounds.\n\n3.2.4âSecondary night-time factors\n\nTwo night-time SOA factorsÂ (NightSOA1EESI andÂ NightSOA2EESI) were resolved from the EESI-TOF-MS PMF analysis (Fig.Â 2). The differences in composition between the two-factor profiles is shown in Fig.Â 7 where the signal from the two profiles are also summed by carbon number. NightSOA1EESI peaks between midnight and 04:00âLT, decreases to nearly zero shortly after sunrise, and remains near zero until after sunset. Relative to the DaySOAEESI factors, the NightSOA1EESI spectrum includes less oxygenated and more volatile terpene oxidation products (e.g.Â C10H16O2 and C10H16O3), which likely partition to the particle phase due to lower night-time temperatures. In addition, prominent signatures from organonitrates are evident, which are likely derived from nitrateÂ (NO3) radical oxidation of monoterpenes at night. Previous studies in rural areas during summer suggested NO3 oxidation of monoterpenes to contribute a large fraction of the night-time SOA (Xu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018). Dominant peaks in the spectrum can be observed for the C10H17OxN species at mâzÂ 286.09 (C10H17O7N), 302.08Â (C10H17O8N), and 270.09Â (C10H17O6N), which contribute 3.6â%, 4.6â%, and 2.4â%, respectively, to the overall profile signal (agâsâ1), resulting in the highest contributions compared to all the other factors. Another major series of compounds in the spectra is found for C10H15OxN, which can be observed at mâzÂ 268.08 (C10H15O6N), 284.07Â (C10H15O7N), 300.07Â (C10H15O8N), and 316.06Â (C10H15O9N) and contribute 1.6â%, 1.5â%, 1.8â%, and 1.5â%, respectively, to the profile signal, resulting in the highest contributions compared to all the other factors except for C10H15O7N and C10H15O8N, which contribute â¼1.3â% and â¼1.7â% to the NightSOA2EESI profile signal (agâsâ1). These species are consistent with NO3 oxidation products of atmospherically relevant monoterpenes such as limonene (Faxon et al., 2018).\n\nThe NightSOA2EESI likewise exhibits a strong and consistent diurnal cycle, with a daily maximum at approximately 09:00âLT, minimum at 21:00âLT, and smooth transitions in between. Like NightSOA1EESI, NightSOA2EESI exhibits strong signatures from organonitrates. However, contributions from non-nitrogen-containing species consistent with limonene and Î±-pinene ozonolysis and photo-oxidation are also evident, e.g.Â C9H14O5â6 and C10H16O4â6 (Bateman et al., 2009; Kahnt et al., 2014; Park et al., 2017), as well as species probably consistent with multi-generation terpene chemistry or aromatic oxidation products suggesting a certain extent of influence from photochemistry, consistent with the diurnal morning peak of this factor. Dominant compounds in the spectrum can be observed at mâzÂ 286.09 (C10H17O7N), 211.058Â (C8H12O5), 225.07Â (C9H14O5), 239.09Â (C10H16O5), and 197.042Â (C7H10O5) contributing 1.9â%, 1.3â%, 1.3â%, 1.2â%, and 0.9â%, respectively, to the total profile signal resulting in the highest contributions among all the other factor signals except for the two DaySOAEESI factors, where they contribute with higher percentages between 1.3â% and 3â% to the profile signal. Overall the two secondary night-time factors show similar O:C ratios (â¼0.6) and H:C ratios (â¼1.65) while the N:C ratio is higher for NightSOA1EESIÂ (0.46) than for NightSOA2EESIÂ (0.3).\n\nFigureÂ S5 shows the correlations of the two night-time SOA factors with ambient temperature. We note that the NightSOA1EESI increases to some extent with temperature, consistent with biogenic aerosol and with the behaviour of DaySOA2. The effect is clear for the night points while not visible for the day points, which is expected from the diurnal pattern of the factor going almost to zero during the day. On the other hand, the NightSOA2EESI does not show any clear dependency on the temperature, suggesting a combined effect of partitioning, additional chemistry, and possibly additional sources. Overall, during the day there will generally be higher terpene emissions due to higher temperature, but also higher dilution due to an enhanced boundary layer height compared to the night, suggesting that, by compensation, terpene-related SOA formation in the lowest layers of the atmosphere might be similar. As a consequence DaySOA2EESI and NightSOA1EESI might represent first-generation chemistry with different oxidants reflecting the availability during the time of the day while DaySOA1EESI and NightSOA2EESI might represent second-generation chemistry oxidation products. As an example, some highly functionalized oxidation products from Î±-pinene photooxidation like C10H16O5 are thought to be second-generation oxidation products (McVay et al., 2016). As a consequence of the extensive decomposition and fragmentation occurring in the AMS system, which particularly affects organonitrates (Farmer et al., 2010), we were not able to resolve any factor related to night chemistry or specific factor dominated by a nitrate signature to compare with the night-time SOA factors from the EESI-TOF-MS analysis. However, the organonitrate-derived signal in the AMS and that of the EESI-TOF-MS are well correlated. FigureÂ 8 shows the time series of the sum of all CxHyOzN+ ions from the AMS and [CxHyOzNp]Na+ ions from the EESI-TOF-MS, with R=0.7. For the AMS analysis the MO-OOAAMS is the factor that contributes the most to these nitrogen-containing fragments mentioned above (â¼50â%) followed by the CS-OAAMS (â¼20â%), while for the EESI-TOF-MS analysis the NightSOA1EESI is the major contributor to the nitrogen-containing species (â¼35â%) followed by NightSOA2EESI (â¼20â%).\n\n3.2.5âBootstrap analysis\n\nBootstrap analysis (Davison and Hinkley, 1997) was conducted to determine the statistical stability and uncertainties of the EESI-TOF-MS PMF solution and evaluate some trends in specific ions and the extent to which factors are discrete versus basis vectors describing compositional gradients. Bootstrap analyses generate a set of new input data and error matrices for analysis from random resampling of the original input data. This resampling perturbs the input data by randomly choosing rows (time points) of the original matrix which are present several times, while other rows are removed (Paatero et al., 2014); the overall dimensions of the data matrix are kept constant for each resampling. The resampled data made up on average â¼64â% of the total original data per bootstrap run. We performed 1000Â bootstrap runs for a six-factor solution with all factors unconstrained except for COAEESI, which as discussed above was constrained using the cooking-related spectrum obtained from the seven-factor unconstrained solution. The cleaner spectra and higher correlation with AMS cooking factorÂ (COAAMS) compared to the cooking profile discriminated in the unconstrained six-factor solution, where a clear mixing with other profiles was still present and an additional not meaningful SOA profile was present, resulted from a splitting of the SOA factor in the solution with one factor fewer. The a value of the constrained COAEESI was randomly selected for each bootstrap iteration within the range ofÂ 0 toÂ 1 with a 0.1Â step size. Note that each bootstrap run is started from a different initialization point; thus, this methodology also includes the investigation of seed-based variability, accounting for the possibility of local minima in the solution space.\n\nA particular point of interest in the bootstrap analysis was the extent to which (day and/or night) SOA factors mix with each other. Thus, it is important to characterize solutions where factors are distinct or mixed and, in the case of mixing, to characterize the type of mixing (i.e.Â which factors are mixed). For this purpose, we adapted the method of Vlachou et al.Â (2018). The key steps in this method are as follows: (1)Â creation of a six-factor base case: this was synthesized from the unconstrained seven-factor solution described above to optimize COAEESI, with the split SOA mathematically combined into a single factor (see Fig.Â S6 for the seven-factor solution); (2)Â Spearman correlation between the time series and the profiles of each factor from the base case and a bootstrap solution are used to sort the bootstrap factors, yielding a correlation matrix with the highest correlation values on the diagonal; (3)Â each correlation coefficient on the matrix diagonal is compared to those on the intersecting row and column to evaluate whether it is the highest by a statistically significant margin (based on a preselected significance levelÂ p from a tÂ test). Vlachou et al.Â (2018) rejected any solution failing to meet this criterion; here we retain the solution but classify it as âmixedâ. For mixed solutions, we then determined which factor(s) was mixed (i.e.Â which factor(s) had time series that could not be unambiguously linked to a unique base case factor based on the statistical significance test described above) and classified solutions according to combinations of mixed factors. This allowed a systematic exploration of bootstrapped solutions most likely to have perturbed the boundaries between selected SOA factors.\n\nThe analysis of Vlachou et al.Â (2018) utilized a pÂ valueâ=â0.05; here we conducted a sensitivity test covering pÂ values ranging fromÂ 0.05 toÂ 0.6. For pÂ values lower thanÂ 0.3, the only mixing observed was among POA factors (e.g. pÂ valueâ=â0.2 yielded mixing between COAEESI and POAEESI for â¼100Â runs based on time series analysis and â¼80Â runs based on profile analysis). A pÂ value ofÂ 0.4 showed mixing NightSOA1EESI with NightSOA2EESI and/or DaySOA2EESI for â¼50Â runs based on time series analysis, while â¼10Â bootstrap runs showed profile mixing between DaySOA1EESI and DaySOA2EESI. However, visual analysis of these mixed-SOA solutions at p=0.4 showed solutions where both the factor profiles and time series were not distinguishable from the base case. We therefore concluded that the SOA factor separation is robust, supporting our treatment of these factors as discrete entities rather than highly interrelated descriptors of composition gradients.\n\nWe applied, at this point, a significance threshold ofÂ 0.3 (pÂ value from tÂ test analysis) and extracted all the solutions classified as unmixed. This resulted in 795Â accepted solutions out of 1000Â runs, with an average aÂ value of the constrained COAEESI profile ofÂ 0.399. FigureÂ 9 summarizes the averaged extracted solution from the bootstrap analysis, showing the means and standard deviations of these 795Â accepted solutions for the diurnal patterns (Fig.Â 9a) and factor mass spectra standard deviations against relative intensities (Fig.Â 9b). The uncertainties of the model (which correspond to the standard deviations among retained solutions) are also presented in Fig.Â 9 and indicate the high stability of the solution. First we calculated the diurnals, then the standard deviation of the mean diurnals across all bootstrap runs. Thus, the error bars describe variability across solutions (i.e.Â model uncertainty) and deliberately exclude day-to-day variability in the actual data.\n\nThe median percentage uncertainties for the profiles varied between 5.3â% and 12â% where the highest uncertainties were related to the night-time SOA factors. The highest diurnal variability was related to CS-OAEESI and DaySOA2EESI. Overall, the uncertainties were not of sufficient magnitude to disrupt the diurnal gradients discussed above or to significantly affect the apportionment of key ions discussed above. This highlights the relatively discrete nature of the factors.\n\n3.3âEESI-TOF-MS and AMSÂ comparison\n\nFigureÂ 10a shows the bulk comparison between the EESI-TOF-MS and the AMS total signal for the overlapping measurement period. The AMS total signal represents the time series of measured organic mass concentration while the EESI-TOF-MS total signal is the sum of the mass fluxes of every detected ion (neglecting Na+ mass and excluding ions that are high intensity but spray-dominated). Further, no relative sensitivity corrections were applied for the EESI-TOF-MS even though it is known that there is some sensitivity variability (Lopez-Hilfiker et al., 2019).\n\nThe results of the two instruments are correlated (R=0.81) despite the assumption that all EESI-TOF-MS ions have the same response factor and even though the AMS-measured mass includes a primary source related to trafficÂ (HOAAMS) that consists mainly of compounds that are insoluble in the electrospray droplets and therefore not visible in the EESI-TOF-MS.\n\nFigureÂ 10b shows the EESI-TOF-MS signal as a function of AMS mass for the COA and CS-OA primary factors and the sum of the SOA factors (i.e.Â total SOA estimated by EESI-TOF-MS and AMS), where SOA is colour-coded according to the N:C ratios. The AMS and EESI-TOF-MS SOA estimates are highly correlated (R=0.90), suggesting that the variability in the composition is well captured by the model and in good agreement between the two instruments. This strong correlation occurs despite significant variation in SOA composition (e.g.Â enhanced organonitrates at night), suggesting that the differences in relative response factors among different species are not so large as to significantly bias the overall source apportionment results. However, some differences are apparent. The time of the day is the main driver of SOA composition and the N:C ratio follows a similar pattern. The N:C ratio colour-coding of SOA shows a generally higher slope for higher N:C ratios. This is likely due to a combination of two factors: (1)Â underestimation of SOA by the AMS due to organonitrate decomposition to the inorganic ions NO+ and NO2+ , which are not included in the calculation of SOA mass, and (2)Â higher sensitivity of the EESI-TOF-MS to SOA with a higher nitrogen content.\n\nThe cooking factorsÂ (COA) and the cigarette smoke factorsÂ (CS-OA) retrieved from each instrument are in good agreement with each other as well, although with lower correlation compared to the secondary factors (R=0.64 and R=0.73, respectively). The AMSâEESI-TOF-MS correlation for CS-OA further suggests that even though nicotine does not ionize by adduct formation with Na+, this alternate pathway does not introduce significant nonlinearities in its detection, at least under the conditions encountered in Zurich during summer. Similar performance was obtained for nicotine detection during winter measurements in Zurich (Qi et al., 2019). Note that the slopes retrieved from the linear correlation in Fig.Â 10a are proportional to the EESI-TOF-MS mean sensitivity of the compounds comprising each factor. The slope is nearly a factor ofÂ 2 higher for SOA than for COA, which may be due to a combination of two factors. First, it is expected that the EESI-TOF-MS may be more sensitive to the highly oxygenated and highly water-soluble components in SOA than to the fatty acids in COA. Second, the AMS relative ionization efficiency for COA has recently been suggested to be approximately 2 times higher for COA than for bulk organics, due to the higher molecular weight and thermal decomposition characteristics of the molecules comprising COA (Reyes-Villegas et al., 2018). Nevertheless, these correlations indicate that the EESI-TOF-MS signal linearly relates to mass concentration even for complex ambient aerosol and also suggest that the overall EESI-TOF-MS sensitivity toÂ OA is not subject to significant variation during the study even if the composition-dependent relative sensitivities are actually unknown. Therefore, we assume that factor-specific sensitivities are not needed for the interpretation of the EESI PMF solution where the factors describe the variability in composition.\n\nFigureÂ 10c andÂ d show the atomic H:C and O:C ratios, respectively, for the total SOA as well as the COA and CS-OA factors determined from the EESI-TOF-MS and AMS data. In terms of O:C ratio, the SOA factors show fair consistency with values aroundÂ 0.6 andÂ 0.5 for the EESI-TOF-MS and AMS analysis, respectively. For the COA and CS-OA factors, the O:C ratio is much lower for the AMSÂ (â¼0.1) than for the EESI-TOF COAÂ (â¼0.4). This is again consistent with a reduced sensitivity of the EESI-TOF-MS to hydrocarbon-like molecules due to a lower extraction and/or ionization efficiency. On the other hand the H:C ratios are slightly higher for the EESI-TOF-MS measurements with values ofÂ â¼1.6, â¼1.7, and â¼1.8Â for SOA, CS-OA, and COA, respectively, compared toÂ â¼1.3, â¼1.4, andÂ â¼1.6, respectively, for the AMS analysis. Similar results were also observed for winter aerosol in Zurich (Qi et al., 2019) and for ageing experiments of wood burning emissions in an environmental chamber (Bertrand et al., 2018). This could suggest a reduced sensitivity of the EESI-TOF-MS to low H:C compounds (e.g.Â aromatic oxidation products) relative to terpene SOA. Alternatively, given that the EESI-TOF-MS sensitivity to laboratory-generated SOA from single-component precursors roughly decreases with decreasing molecular weight (Lopez-Hilfiker et al., 2019), it may be that compounds with a lower H:C ratio occur predominantly in ions with lower carbon number.\n\nBecause the first step in EESI-TOF-MS detection is a rapid extraction into the methanolâââwater droplets generated by the electrospray, one possibility for the observed discrepancies in the O:C ratios between the AMS and the EESI-TOF-MS could be incomplete extraction of less soluble components in the EESI-TOF-MS. To investigate this, we compare the O:C ratios from the AMS factors retrieved in the current study (COAAMSÂ 0.1, HOAAMSÂ 0.057, and OOAAMSÂ 0.42â0.5) with those from offline AMS source apportionment of aqueous filter extracts, where water-insoluble components are not detected. The offline-AMS method yields O:C ratios consistent with the online AMS (COAofflineÂ 0.10, HOAofflineÂ 0.06, and OOAofflineÂ 0.51) (Bozzetti et al., 2017). In contrast, the EESI-TOF-MS ratios are significantly higher (COAEESIÂ 0.38 and SOAEESIÂ 0.56â0.62) despite extraction into a waterâââmethanol mixture rather than water only. This suggests that the EESI extraction process (i.e.Â solubility) alone cannot explain the discrepancies between the two instruments. Note that this assumes no kinetic limitations on solubility and extraction, as the offline method applies a water extraction for 20âmin, while the EESI-TOF-MS uses a very fast extraction in waterâââmethanol; however, this assumption is likely valid as laboratory tests suggest complete extraction of particles by the EESI-TOF-MS in the measured size range (Lopez-Hilfiker et al., 2019).\n\nThe bulk variabilities of the H:C and O:C ratios for the total EESI-TOF-MS signal vs.Â that of the AMS are presented in Fig.Â S7. The trends shown there are consistent with and explained by those of the individual factors as discussed above.\n\nThe contribution of each factor from the EESI-TOF-MS PMF analysis over the entire campaign is reported in Fig.Â 11 along with the total signal measured from the EESI-TOF-MS (agâsâ1) and the total measured mass from the AMS (Âµgâmâ3) (panel a). We note that periods with higher signal correspond to periods with higher ambient temperature, above 25ââC (23â24Â June and 1â2Â and 6â7Â July). These days are characterized by high contributions from the SOA factors, and when temperature exceeded 30ââC (23â24Â June) the contribution of the DaySOA2EESI was higher compared to DaySOA1EESI. It has been shown previously that oxidized biogenic VOCs can considerably enhance particulate mass during heat waves (Guenther et al., 1993; Churkina et al., 2017), suggesting a probable relation of the SOA sources discriminated in these analyses with biogenic emissions and especially suggesting a relation between DaySOA2EESI and oxidation of freshly emitted terpenes from vegetation as previously presented in Fig.Â 6.\n\nThe night-time composition is significantly different, with NightSOA2EESI in particular often being at or above 50â% of the total SOA as measured by the EESI-TOF-MS while the AMS analysis does not allow identification of this factor. We note that according to Fig.Â 4 (bottom panel) the total AMS OOA is well-correlated with the sum of all four EESI-TOF-MS SOA factors, indicating that the high contribution of NightSOA2EESI reflects a large contribution to the total SOA mass rather than an anomalously high relative sensitivity in the EESI-TOF-MS. This demonstrates the extent to which important chemical variability is missed by the AMS PMF analysis. FigureÂ 12 shows pie charts of the mean EESI-TOF-MS factor contributions over the entire measurement period (Fig.Â 12a), for only the measurement period overlapping with the AMS (Fig.Â 12b) and the mean AMS factor contributions (Fig.Â 12c). We note that the relative contributions of the factors retrieved from the EESI-TOF-MS analysis are consistent for the two measurement periods, with only small variability. This supports the applied approach of comparing the AMS and EESI-TOF-MS PMF solutions for the entire available periods, despite the limited temporal overlap. Overall the primary factors contribute up to â¼20â% for the EESI-TOF-MS analysis while they reach up to â¼30â% of the total measured mass for the AMS. The secondary factors on the other hand contribute up to â¼80â% of the total apportioned signal for the EESI-TOF-MS analysis and â¼70â% of the total apportioned mass for theÂ AMS.\n\nBetween the two instruments, the COA factors exhibit the strongest difference in contribution, with COAAMS accounting for 11.6â% of the total measured organic mass, while COAEESI for the overlapping period reaches only 5.7â%. This could be a consequence of the underestimation of the relative ionization efficiencyÂ (RIE) of COAAMS, discussed earlier, which would result in an overestimation of its measured mass (Reyes-Villegas et al., 2018). Accounting for this effect, e.g.Â considering a COA RIE ofÂ 2 instead of the default 1.4Â value, the COAAMS contribution would decrease to 7.2â% and as a consequence the HOAAMS, CS-OAAMS, LO-OOAAMS, and MO-OOAAMS contributions would be 7.1â%, 11.2â%, 48.2â%, and 26â%, respectively, improving in this way the agreement with the COA factor extracted from the EESI-TOF-MS analysis. The RIE is although only one of the possible explanations; another possible reason is that the AMS collection efficiency is likely closer toÂ 1 if cooking aerosols are externally mixed (Middlebrook et al., 2012).\n\nFigureÂ 13 shows the explained variationÂ (EV) of each factor for selected ions in the EESI-TOF-MS dataset, as well as the variation that cannot be explained by the solution. This is a dimensionless quantity that indicates how much each computed factor explained a rowÂ (G) or a columnÂ (F) of the input data matrix, X. EVÂ values can be interpreted as the scaled version of the elements of the input matrix, where the loading of each chemical species in each factor is normalized toÂ 1 (Eq.Â 12, Canonaco et al., 2013).\n\nThe compounds explained most by a single factor are nicotine (C10H15N2), of which â¼80â% of EVÂ is explained by the cigarette factor aloneÂ (CS-OAEESI), and the fatty acids (C16â18 in Fig.Â 13), of which up to 78â% of EVÂ is explained by the cooking factor aloneÂ (COAEESI). The variability of the nitrogen-containing compounds is mostly explained by the secondary night-time factors, and with increasing oxygenation, the contributions from the primary factors are drastically reduced. Further, we include in the analysis two series of compounds likely deriving from biogenic emissions (C9H14Ox and C10H16Ox), whereÂ EV by the DaySOAEESI factors is higher for the more oxygenated species, while the EV of less oxygenated species is increased for the NightSOAEESI and primary factors. This is consistent with temperature-driven partitioning, causing the less oxygenated (and thus more volatile) compounds to be depleted in the particle phase during the day. We also included in the analysis two series of compounds that are commonly related to fossil sources (C5 species), and we note the same effect consistent with partitioning described above. Finally, the C6H10O5 contribution to the total profile signal is 54â% and 45â% for the primary and secondary factors, respectively, while its variability is almost equally explained by the primary and secondary factors with similar contributions of 46â% and 54â%, respectively. This suggests that most likely this chemical formula does not exclusively represent levoglucosan (or other sugars emitted from cellulose pyrolysis), which is enhanced in primary biomass combustion emissions and under summer conditions can be quickly oxidized (Bertrand et al., 2018b). Instead, significant contributions from non-sugar isomers generated by gas-phase oxidation (similar to the rest of the C6H10Ox series) are likely. For the last series of compounds the primary factors contribute â¼30â% and the secondary factors â¼70â% to the total signal while in terms of explained mass weighted variability the series is explained by up to 18â% and 81â% by primary and secondary factors, respectively. Overall, we were able, with the EESI-TOF-MS PMF analysis, to separate more SOA factors compared to the AMS analysis where all variability related to secondary components is included in MO-OOAAMS and LO-OOAAMS. Further, the DaySOA2EESI and NightOOA1EESI appear related to specific processes (local daytime terpene oxidation and local night-time terpene oxidation, respectively). On the other hand, the DaySOA1EESI and NightOOA2EESI factors could not be unambiguously related to a single source of gaseous precursors. These last factors are also more closely related to each other and likely a convolution of VOC emissions sources and the atmospheric reactions/timescales for conversion toÂ PM.\n\nThis result is conceptually similar to PMF analysis of NO3 CIMS measurements of gas-phase highly oxygenated moleculesÂ (HOMs) by Yan et al.Â (2016) in the Finnish boreal forest during spring 2012. Several factors were separated and related to different oxidation mechanisms. Overall the most significant separation was observed between daytime and night-time; the daytime profiles appeared to be dominated by light HOMs and organonitrates derived from monoterpene chemistry initiated by OH reaction in the presence of NO while the night-time profiles appeared to be dominated by HOM dimers deriving from the oxidation of monoterpenes with O3 and NO3. Despite compositional differences between the gas and particle phases, several ions having common molecular formulae are identified in both studies and also have similar temporal behaviour. We use these correlations together with the better-understood gas-phase chemistry, giving rise to the chosen ions to infer the major processes affecting the particle phase. For example, C10H15O8N was found to be the major organonitrate representative of daytime HOMs (Yan et al., 2016) and in the current study shows the highest contributions from the DaySOA1EESI and NightSOA2EESI factors. Another example is C10H15O9N, which was considered a tracer molecule of daytime processes initiated by O3 reaction there, while in the current study its variability is mostly explained by the less source-specific DaySOA2EESI and NightSOA1EESI factors. On the other hand, fingerprint molecules related to night-time chemistry in Finland, e.g.Â C10H14O7 and C10H14O9, are mostly explained by NightSOA2EESI and even more so by DaySOA1EESI in the current study. This suggests that the variability is strongly driven by local source characteristics and environmental conditions, including daylight hours and oxidant concentrations, of oxidant and terpene sink variability. Similarly, Zhang et al.Â (2018) investigated the nature of monoterpene SOAÂ (MTSOA) from FIGAERO-CIMS analysis in a forested area in the southeastern United States influenced by anthropogenic pollution. They found that different chemical processes involving nitrogen oxidesÂ (NOx), during day and night, play a central role in the monoterpene SOA produced, suggesting a strong anthropogenicâbiogenic interaction affecting the ambient aerosol. The diurnal pattern of MTSOA was flat, but specifically they found that the majority of daytime MTSOA was due to fragmentation products of RO2â+âNO while during night-time monoterpenes were most likely oxidized by NO3, which is primarily formed by NO2+O3. Overall a large fraction of the identified species in the MTSOA are also present in the current study and contribute with different abundance to all four SOA factors discriminated, suggesting once more the strong biogenic influence of secondary aerosol in summer at the measurement site."
