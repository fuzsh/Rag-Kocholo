        "text": "Switzerland offers an enormous variety of experiences and a breathtaking landscape: Admire the reflection of the unique Alpine panorama in turquoise-blue lakes. Overlook Switzerland from above on pass heights and peaks. Marvel at museums, trade fairs and world-famous buildings in cities. Follow in the footsteps of countless records. Get to know the most spectacular accommodation and transport options in the country. Experience pure nature. Immerse yourself in the secrets of the most famous Swiss traditions and enjoy a variety of culinary delicacies.\n\nThanks to its high density of experiences, the cultural and scenic diversity and the well-developed roads, Switzerland is the ideal touring country. There are countless beautiful routes and locations that are suitable for touring. When determining the route, it was all about tourist attractiveness - and the most impressive and spectacular route possible in between.\n\nThe highlights of Switzerland on the most scenic route. Motorways are mostly avoided on the Grand Tour and are only travelled on when it makes sense from a traffic point of view.\n\nHighlights 45 top attractions, including twelve UNESCO World Heritage Sites and two biospheres.\n\nLakes 22 lakes larger than 0.5 km² along the route\n\nRecommended summer travel time (April – October)\n\nLength\n\nCore route: 1,643 km\n\nEntry stage Basel - Neuchâtel: 165 km\n\nEntry stage Geneva - Saint-George: 53 km\n\nEntry stage Chiasso - Bellinzona: 109 km\n\nHighest/lowest point of the Grand Tour\n\nFurkapass, 2,429 m above M./Lago Maggiore, 193 m above M.\n\nThe small medieval town of Murten is located on the lake of the same name and has retained its original face with the picturesque old town streets and cozy arcades. It surrounds the only almost completely preserved and walkable curtain wall of Switzerland.\n\nThanks to its idyllic location on a small hill, the 800-year-old Zähringer town in the canton of Friborg has developed into a popular excursion destination.\n\nThe city on the German-French language border has a beautiful lake promenade with a wide range of water sports and offers a lot of culture and excursions. In the evening you shouldn't miss the sunset with a magnificent view over Lake Murten towards Mont Vully and Jura.\n\nThanks to the largely unchanged medieval townscape, Bern was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1983.\n\nThe old town of Bern is surrounded by the Aare loop and enjoys the view of the overwhelming alpine panorama. The romantic capital owes its charm to the unity of the cityscape.\n\n6 km of arcades, figure fountains from the Renaissance, the cathedral, largely preserved sandstone facades and a unique roof landscape characterize the image of the city, founded in 1191, which is one of the greatest examples of medieval urban planning in Europe.\n\nIn Central Switzerland, the city of Lucerne with 82,000 residents is located on the shores of the beautiful Lake Lucerne. The 650 year old Chapel Bridge with its octagonal water tower is world famous. Visit the baroque Jesuit church and the imposing congress and cultural center (KKL), which one could also assume to be in London or New York.\n\nFrom the Fronalpstock (1922m), which can be reached on foot and by chairlift, you have an impressive vantage point and enjoy an impressive panoramic view of ten lakes, vertically down to Brunnen and the Rütli, to Pilatus, Rigi, Säntis, the high Alps and the Mittelland to the Jura.\n\nFrom the village of Schlattli, the world's steepest funicular goes 734 m up to the Stoos plateau. From here the whole family can go hiking and admire the unique panorama.\n\nEinsiedeln Abbey is the largest pilgrimage site in Switzerland and an important stop on the Way of St. James. The Black Madonna of Einsiedeln in the Chapel of Grace attracts around 800,000 pilgrims and tourists every year. The community of Benedictine monks has around 60 members.\n\nEinsiedeln Abbey was built in the 18th century as a baroque building with four inner courtyards. Before that, Romanesque and Gothic buildings dominated the hermitage, which was founded in 835 by the Benedictine monk Meinrad. In the monastery church, the Chapel of Grace made of black marble stands under a frescoed vault. Inside is the famous Black Madonna from the 15th century.\n\nZurich is a lively and dynamic small metropolis. Over 400,000 people from Zurich live in the largest Swiss city.\n\nThe cosmopolitan city on the water combines creative city life with wonderful nature. With countless events, diverse museums, its own food festival and the liveliest nightlife in Switzerland, Zurich pulsates day and night.\n\nWith its unique location on Lake Zurich, the Alps on the horizon, the numerous local recreation areas and its urban diversity, the city offers an attractive whole.\n\nThe picturesque streets of the old town on both sides of the Limmat are testimonies to the city's pre-medieval history. Promenades like the Limmatquai follow the river to the 17th century town hall.\n\nOne of the most important buildings is the Grossmünster and is one of Zurich's most famous landmarks. The Romanesque church that still exists today was built around 1100 and has since been rebuilt and renovated several times.\n\nHere you have a wonderful view of the Engadine with St. Moritz at your feet.\n\nThe Muottas Muragl can be reached on foot or with a funicular from Punt Muragl (between Samedan and Pontresina). The Muottas Muragl-Bahn (MMB) funicular has a length of 2199 m and overcomes an altitude of 709 m.\n\nTremolastrasse is the longest road construction monument in Switzerland. The world-famous serpentine road was created with the construction of the Gotthard pass road. In the most spectacular section, the road overcomes a length of four kilometers, 300 meters in altitude in 24 bends, which even have their own names. The pass road between Göschenen and Airolo was built between 1827 and 1832 according to plans by the Ticino engineer Francesco Meschini, after the access roads from Basel and Chiasso had been continuously expanded since the 1810s.\n\nThe largest glacier on mainland Europe is located here. With a length of 23km, an average width of 1800m and an area of around 100km2, the Aletsch Glacier comprises an impressive 27 billion tons of ice. The ice masses stretch from the northern flanks of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau down into the Valais, the water of which flows through the wild Massa Gorge into the Rhone. The Swiss Alps Jungfrau-Aletsch region was added to the Unesco World Heritage List in 2001 as a landscape of extraordinary beauty.\n\nOne of the most famous mountains in the world is in the Valais Alps between Zermatt and Breuil-Cervinia. The east, north and west walls are on Swiss territory, the south wall on Italian territory.\n\nIn 1865, the first ascent of the Matterhorn, which cost four out of seven alpinists their lives, changed the previously very secluded region forever. The Matterhorn became world-famous and a destination for ambitious mountaineers.\n\nOne has a fantastic view of the most photographed mountain in the world from the Klein Matterhorn (Matterhorn glacier paradise), which is only separated from the Matterhorn by the Theodul pass and glacier. It is accessible from Zermatt with cable cars, the mountain station at 3820 meters above sea level is the highest cable car station in the Alps. Other vantage points are the Gornergrat or the Rothorn. The first electric cogwheel railway in Switzerland reaches the Gornergrat in around 30 minutes from Zermatt. The viewing platform is open all year round.\n\nLausanne, the second largest city on Lake Geneva, combines a dynamic business city with the location of a holiday resort. The capital of the canton of Vaud is also a lively university and popular congress city.\n\nVarious world sports federations, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), have their headquarters in Lausanne. Since 1994 the city has had the official title of \"Olympic Capital\".

In addition, Basel has a beautiful old town, modern architecture and the Rhine, which invites you to linger.\n\nThe municipal art museum exhibits what is generally considered to be the most important public art collection in Switzerland. With the “Amerbach-Kabinett” acquired by the city in 1661, the collection is considered to be the oldest public art museum in the world.\n\nYear after year, people from near and far make the pilgrimage to Riehen to immerse themselves in the art world of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler. You come to the collection of works from the classical modern period or to one of the sensational exhibitions. But Renzo Piano's building and the associated park are also worth the trip.\n\nOther museums, such as the Museum of Cultures, are just as attractive as numerous galleries and small theaters.\n\nThe Grand Tour can be skied in both directions, but Switzerland Tourism recommends clockwise travel. This is particularly important in cities with one-way streets or motorway entrances.\n\nThe Grand Tour is signposted with official signposts. The signage is limited to the clockwise direction of travel on the core route and to the core route on the entry stages from abroad.\n\nWith a driving time of at least five hours a day, it is recommended to plan at least seven days for the core route. Depending on the entry from the border, more time is required. The effective travel time depends on whether you take it easy or take time for the many sights along the route. You can enjoy the route extensively with the motorhome."
