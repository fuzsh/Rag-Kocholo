Prevalently found are microplastics (MPs) including PMMA. Additionally, micronized rubber powder (MRP), which originates from tire abrasion but is also used as a filler material for various other products, can be found. Due to their small size of less than 100 μm in diameter and relatively low concentrations found in wastewater or seawater, the cleaning from such water sources of MPs or MRP will only be of technological and economic relevance if an efficient, low cost pre-concentration step can be applied before other filtration/separation technologies are applied. Flotation is expected to be such a relevant pre-concentration technique if a high enough affinity of MP/MRP particles to gas bubbles would exist. Accordingly the interaction behavior of MRP and MPs with such gas bubble interfaces was investigated. Based on this, a simple, fast and filter-less technique was developed to remove APPs from seawater by a newly designed process combining flotation and separation in a hydrocyclone type setup. In a first step, we characterized the MRP and found two particle fractions with different gas bubble interaction behaviors. One fraction formed spontaneous air bubble–particle clusters and was prone to attach to the air–water interface. The second fraction sedimented and accumulated at the bottom. Once adsorbed at the interface, the particles remained irreversibly attached. Both MPs and MRP stabilized the foams from air bubbles in artificial seawater as well as in MilliQ water, indicating a preferred localization at the air–water interface. Thus, when treated in the modified hydrocyclone (mHC) based flotation process with controlled swirl flow applied, an extraction ratio of 26% was reached, whereas without bubbles, only 3.7% was reached. The investigated model mHC enabled us to concentrate and separate APPs, in the diameter range d90,3 ≤ 105 μm with particle density very close to water, with the use of their promotion of the air–water interface. These promising results in a first test step for our system encourage further investigation of the applied technology for microplastic-contaminated water.\n\nWater impact\n\nThis newly designed separation processing principle demonstrates how microplastics with hydrophobic tendencies and low density differences to the medium can be separated or up-concentrated in an efficient way without the use of filters. This technique shows high potential to serve as a pre-treatment step before subsequent filtration of wastewater containing microplastics.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAnthropogenic polymer particulates (APPs) can be divided into two different categories: thermoplastics and thermosets.1 Due to abrasion and inadequate waste management, micronized APPs are ubiquitous. Micronized thermoplastics are commonly known as microplastics (MPs) including synthetic precursors like polyethylene, polystyrene, and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and others, which are typically smaller than 5 mm in size,2,3 with different colors and shapes. It has been reported that 80% of MPs in our freshwater and seawater are from terrestrial sources.4 The typical concentration in seawater ranges from ca. 10 to 500 particles per m3 depending on the location. Most abundant MPs are from polyethylene and polystyrene.5 Their ubiquitous abundance has also been shown to have a pronounced negative effect on smaller life forms, as inclusions of MPs in algae cells were found.6,7 Within the collected APP samples from seawater, the occurrence of micronized rubber powder (MRP), often referred to as tyre wear particles, has also been reported.8 MRP is an umbrella name for the abrasion of thermoset polymers. Similar to MPs, MRP is found in every land compartment9 and river water at concentrations of 0.5–5 mg L−1.8\n\nThe driving force for the sedimentation or flotation behavior of APPs in a static water body is the density difference. The density of APPs typically ranges from 0.85–1.45 g cm−3 for MPs10 and 1.15–1.20 g cm−3 for MRP.11 Accordingly, this results in a rising/sinking velocity of a particle (dp = 105 μm) in still water at 25 °C of approximately 0.012 and −0.025 m s−1 for densities of 0.85 and 1.45 g cm−3, respectively, according to calculations based on the dimensionless Archimedes (Ar)–Omega (Ω) relationship. The most common techniques to separate particles by size and substances, apart from using filters, include hydrocyclones and froth flotation applications. In a hydrocyclone, the observed particle separation is a result of an opposing centrifugal and drag force balance.12 The suspension is tangentially led into an upper cylindrical inlet section thus generating a helical swirl flow of a certain angular velocity and entering into the conical cyclone section at its lower part. This results in the movement of larger particles towards the cyclone wall. Froth flotation is used to e.g. extract valuable mineral particles from a liquid medium. Air is purged into a pulp of particles in water, which is conditioned with a small amount of surface active reagents. This leads to formation of bubbles which then collide with particles, thus getting attached to the floating bubble interfaces and forming a stable froth on top of the liquid surface. Often, a so-called collector is added to render one mineral selectively hydrophobic and thus increase the collection efficiency.\n\nThe extraction consistency and lack of filter-less techniques to filter large volumes of water to obtain APPs are a well-known problem.13 Only a few researchers have published other separation methods, such as elutriation,14 to concentrate watery suspensions of APPs. In the presented work, we explored a separation technology combining flotation and centrifugal separation within a modified hydrocyclone device.\n\nExperimental\n\nMaterials\n\nAnthropogenic particles. Micronized rubber powder (MRP) was obtained from Entech, Middlebury, IN, USA. The MRP was then further sieved (Fritsch Analysette 3, Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany) to access smaller size fractions. As an MP, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) esplas H60 from KSL, Staubtechnik GmbH, Germany, was used.\n\nMethods\n\nParticle characterization. The particle sizes were assessed with laser diffraction analysis (Beckman Coulter LS 13320, Brea, USA). 10 wt% particles were suspended in medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT, WITARIX MCT 60/40, IOI Oleo GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) and ultrasonicated at 200 W at 24 kHz with a maximum amplitude of 175 μm for 2.5 min (Hielscher Ultrasonics GmbH, Teltow, Germany). The particle density was measured with a pycnometer (AccuPyc II 1340, Micromeritics, Norcross, Georgia, USA). As purge gas helium was used with a fill pressure of 19.5 psig, 25 cycles were conducted with an end equilibration of 0.005 psig min−1.\n\nParticle behavior in medium. To characterize the behavior in MilliQ water, 100 mg of MRP or PMMA was mixed in 50 ml MilliQ water. The suspension was then vortexed for 90 s. After five minutes the top fraction was extracted with a spatula, dried and weighed before filtering the bottom fraction with a coffee filter. For PMMA, no quantification was possible. Measurements were performed in triplicate (N = 3).\n\nGel trapping technique. The gel trapping technique allows us to image and analyse the wettability of colloidal particles adsorbed at fluid interfaces. The experimental procedure is as follows.15 In a glass beaker, 2 wt% of gellan gum (GELZAN™ CM, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in MilliQ water at 70 °C. MRP particles were dispersed in MilliQ water and injected with a glass syringe at the hot air/water interface. After 5 min of equilibration, the sample was slowly cooled down to set the gel and immobilize the adsorbed particles at the interface. After 24 h, the gelled water surface was imaged with an optical profilometer.\n\nOptical profilometer. MRP particles immobilized at the gelled water surface were imaged with an optical profilometer (Plu Neox, Sensofar, Terrassa Spain) in bright field mode. A 20× objective (LU Plan Fluor, Nikon) was used for imaging. The topography image of the interface allowed for imaging only the surface of the particle protruding out of the gelled water surface. At the same time, a reflection microscopy image was recorded in order to visualize also the surface of the particle immersed in the gel. Topography images were then analyzed with the software Gwyddion.\n\nStatistical analysis. A Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA test computed with IBM SPSS Statistics 24 was performed. The significance level was set at 0.05.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nI. Cluster formation of MRP\n\nAs reported by various researchers, leaching of surface active substances such as zinc and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is common when APPs, especially MRP, are re-introduced into water.11,18,19 Such leaching of interfacially active components and the related reduction of surface tension of the supernatant were also found due to a washing effect applied to the MRP particles. In a follow-up step, the washed and classified MRP fractions were re-introduced into MilliQ water (see Fig. 4). After processing and settling for 5 minutes, two major fractions were collected at the top and bottom of the cylindrical vessel used and were weighed. In Table 2, the ratios between the two fractions of MRP samples with different mean particle sizes d90,3 (n = 4) are shown. Larger fractions of up to 5.2 times more particles were found at the top of the vessel than at the bottom. The top particle fraction was removed and the subsequent mixing step applied to the bottom fraction did not lead to another separation at the top.\n\nTo visualize the observed behavior, Fig. 5 shows the microscopy images of particles extracted from the top and bottom separated fractions from different water sources being MilliQ water, tap water and artificial seawater (ASW). The particles from the top fraction were aggregated at the air–water bubble interface. Pycnometric measurements of this particle fraction showed a density of about 1 g cm−3. In addition, the method suggested closed porous structures of approximately 72.3% v/v. Similar behavior, as found on top, was reported as an alternative way to fight oil spills.20 In such a case, the aggregated particle clusters exhibit large capillary forces used to immobilize oil. In contrast to PMMA, such a type of cluster formation was not observed and no top layer separation could be carried out. Further it was noted that the particle size of APPs did not significantly increase when introduced to the watery medium. Thus swelling of the porous structure could be neglected.\n\nWhen particles were immobilized by gelling the water phase, both fractions of particles from the bottom and top were shown to protrude in the entrapped gas phase, as shown in Fig. 6A) as dark and in Fig. 6B) as bright areas. The contact angle or protruding area in the air phase remains low for spontaneous from-bulk adsorption because of pinning of the contact line on the rough and porous surface. Therefore the measured protruding area is not correlated to the thermodynamic contact angle value in equilibrium.21,22 The energy required to desorb a particle from the fluid interface can be expressed as:\n\nE = S·γ(2)\n\nwhere S is the cross-section surface area of the protruding part of the particle in the air phase, and γ denotes the interfacial tension (72 mN m−1 for air/water). From the gel trapping experiments, we obtained an average height of protruding particles into the gas of hmax ≈ 1 μm and a related average interfacial area of the particle protruding in the air phase of S = 1000–5000 μm2. In conclusion, for an average surface area of S = 3000 μm2 the energy required to desorb a protruding particle is calculated to be E ≈ 5 × 1010kBT. Thus, the particle will remain irreversibly attached once adsorbed at the fluid–gas interface. Consequently, forcing particle adsorption through foaming should enable collection of all particles adsorbed at the fluid–gas interface.\n\nIn summary, if particle–interface contacts are promoted, once adsorbed at the interface due to their wetting properties, and supported by their rough and porous surface, particles remain irreversibly attached. For the separated top particle fraction, gas bubble/particle interaction happens spontaneously, while it requires mixing energy for sedimented particles from the bottom.\n\nII. Foam stability\n\nThe findings from Fig. 6 suggest that the particles stabilize the air–water interface. Following this indication, static foaming with and without particles in different media was performed in a foam formation column. The obtained steady state foam height was divided by the height without addition of particles. Fig. 7 shows this relative foam height (H/H0,medium) as a function of the mean particle size d90,3. A relative foam height ratio larger than 1 indicates a constructive influence of the particles on foam stability, whereas a ratio smaller than 1 indicates foam deconstruction by the particles. Surprisingly, the H/H0,medium increased when particles were added to MilliQ water and ASW. This effect is explained by the hydrophobic nature of the APPs. Moreover, the water drainage in the lamellas was delayed by the addition of particles. In contrast, the H/H0,medium of tap water was reduced below 1 due to gradual collapse of the foam. Water molecules close to a hydrophilic surface have a strong attractive interaction with surface atoms, e.g. via hydrogen bonds, increasing the surface free energy. This interaction also leads to structuring of the “interfacial water” and consequently water molecules on average reside longer at positions with strong interaction than at positions with lower interaction force.23 Dissolved ions may alter the water structure, particle surface wettability and colloidal interaction between bubbles and particles.24 Large inorganic ions such as Ca+ and I− are considered as “structure breaking” ions. These ions are predominant in the tap water, leading to the observed destructive phenomenon. Meanwhile “structure making” small inorganic ions such as Mg2+ and Cl− can be found in the ASW. Moreover it was shown that destabilisation of hydration layers surrounding coal particles increased their surface hydrophobicity.25 Thus it was suggested that the use of inorganic salts could compress the double layer around the particles resulting in opening of hydrophobic sites. These sites may then attract equally more hydrophobic bubbles compared to the watery bulk phase and stabilize at their interfaces.\n\nIII. Separation efficiency of APPs in artificial seawater\n\nThe presented filter-less technique relates to a modified hydrocyclone (mHC). To separate the suspended particles of low density difference to the watery fluid phase from artificial seawater, the mHC was operated at 33.7 L min−1. In contrast to the common hydrocyclone design, this design purely consisted of a cylindrical body instead of a cylindrical top connected to a conical bottom. The fluid inlet was tangential to the cylindrical body to generate a helical upward swirl flow. In addition, a bubbly co-flow was introduced through a membrane. Taking into account the previously explored effects of foam stabilization, an increased air–water interface in combination with the helical complex swirl flow was expected to increase the “particle capturing capabilities”, thus supporting the generation of a stabilized particle. The schematic flow and the complex particle capturing mechanism introduced by floating bubbles are presented in Fig. 8. The separation efficiency refers to the process of capturing particles by individual bubbles and as a result of superimposed collision, attachment and detachment events.26 Moreover, in a typical flotation process, particle–bubble collision and additional adsorption of surface active agents may happen simultaneously. A zone model, with the accumulation of surface active agents at the rear end of the bubbles, was also proposed.27 Thus, the size of the bubbles in relation to the size of the particles,28 rising bubble relative velocity, surface active agents present and the local hydrodynamics29 determine the particle collection efficiency.\n\nTo characterize the flow field within the mHC, ultrasound Doppler velocimetry flow mapping with bubbles acting as tracers was applied, a spatio-temporal velocity map measured in a non-invasive way.30 The average radial velocities along the ultrasonic beamline over the height of the mHC are mapped in Fig. 9. When a measurement line of 1 cm offset from the centerline was applied, the swirl character became apparent. Therefore, alternating velocities pointing away and towards the beam direction were typically detected, characterizing the S-shape characteristics of the hydrocyclone shown in Fig. 8a and b. Further detailed characterization of the swirl flow motion and fluctuation frequency of the mHC flow field and exemplary average velocity profiles as obtained by ultrasonic velocity profiling (UVP) can be found elsewhere.17\n\nHaving characterized the flow within the mHC experiments, the mHC experiments were conducted with APPs introduced into 100 L of ASW and systematically up-concentrated with the mHC. Separating the particle loaded foam at 3 different heights in the process (see Fig. 9: A, B, and C), the separation efficiency for the particles inserted at an initial concentration of 3.35 mg L−1 for different particle materials (MRP or MP-PMMA) is plotted in Fig. 10. When operating the mHC without bubbly flow, the concentration of separated particles was low and did not significantly increase at the different extraction positions A to C. In the case of sampling at an expected favorable flow field section with the resulting velocity vector pointing towards the extraction point, an increase in particle concentration would be expected. At extraction point C, the average velocity vector points away from the extraction point which might lead to an opposing effect. Overall, the extraction ratio increased drastically (p < 0.05, n = 3) when the bubbly flow was applied for both types of APPs. This suggests that the radial velocity does not decrease the collection efficiency. More specifically, detachment events due to the hydrodynamics are less likely to be found. When the process was investigated over time, the extraction ratio did not decrease. The extraction of both APPs showed to be constant and stable over a period of 60 min (see Fig. 11). These are promising results in terms of stability and repeatability of the extraction technology.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnthropogenic polymer particulates (APPs), namely MRP and MPs in the form of PMMA, showed to have a significant impact on the foamability of different watery media. As was reported by other researchers, MRP showed a floating top fraction forming spontaneously particle–foam cluster structures with an immobilized gas fraction. Once the particles protrude at the air–water bubble interface, the energy required for desorption becomes ≫ kBT. Moreover, in static foaming trials, an increased interaction and stabilization of the floating foam were found for MRP and PMMA in ASW and MilliQ water. In contrast, a significant decrease in the relative foam height was found for tap water. Thus, separation of these APPs from ASW was increased by applying a new technology of superimposed swirl flow and flotation in a modified hydrocyclone. A regular hydrocyclone would provide a density difference driven phase separation. The additional introduction of a bubbly co-flow promoted the APP–bubble interface interaction with subsequent flotation and particle loaded bubble concentration in the center of the upper hydrocyclone section. Thus as expected, the resulting particle extraction ratio was found to be significantly higher compared to that without bubbly flow. This newly designed separation processing principle demonstrates how microplastics with hydrophobic tendencies and low density differences to the medium can be separated or up-concentrated in an efficient way without the use of filters. The use of filters would be quite inefficient in the case of separation treatment of very low concentrated particle suspensions. Further, this technique shows high potential to serve as a pre-treatment step before subsequent filtration of wastewater containing microplastics.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Daniel Kiechl for his work on the conceptualization of the modified hydrocyclone.
