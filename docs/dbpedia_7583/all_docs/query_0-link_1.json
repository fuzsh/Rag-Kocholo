        "text": "Canton of Switzerland\n\nCanton in Switzerland\n\nThe canton of Zurich (German: Kanton Zürich [ˈtsyːrɪç] ⓘ; French: Canton de Zurich; Romansh: Chantun Turitg; Italian: Canton Zurigo) is an administrative unit (canton) of Switzerland, situated in the northeastern part of the country. With a population of 1,553,423 (as of 31 December 2020), it is the most populous canton of Switzerland.[3] Zurich is the de facto capital of the canton, but is not specifically mentioned in the constitution.[1] The official language is German. The local Swiss German dialect, called Züritüütsch, is commonly spoken.\n\nThe canton had the highest Human Development Index score (0.989) out of over 1,700 subnational regions in 2021, coming close to a perfect score of 1. It is also a global financial center and the fourth richest canton in Switzerland behind Basel-Stadt, Zug and Geneva by GDP per capita.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: History of Zurich\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Early history of Switzerland\n\nThe prehistoric pile dwellings around Lake Zurich, which are located around Lake Zurich in the cantons of Schwyz, St. Gallen and Zurich, make up a considerable portion of the 56 sites in Switzerland that are included in the UNESCO World Heritage Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps.[6][7] Nine of these UNESCO World Heritage sites are located on the shore of Lake Zurich: Freienbach–Hurden Rosshorn, Freienbach–Hurden Seefeld, Rapperswil-Jona/Hombrechtikon–Feldbach, Rapperswil-Jona–Technikum, Erlenbach–Winkel, Meilen–Rorenhaab, Wädenswil–Vorder Au, Zürich–Enge Alpenquai and Kleiner Hafner. Because the lake has grown in size over time, the original piles are now around 4 metres (13 ft) to 7 metres (23 ft) under the water level of 406 metres (1,332 ft). Within an area of about 40 square kilometres (15 sq mi) around Lake Zurich, there also the settlements Greifensee–Storen/Wildsberg at the Greifensee and Wetzikon–Robenhausen at the Pfäffikersee. As well as being part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, each of these 11 prehistoric pile dwellings is also listed as a Class object in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance.[8]\n\nZurihgauuia (Zürichgau) was a subdivision of Turgowe (Thurgau) in the Duchy of Alamannia, consisting roughly of the territory between Reuss and Töss. From the 740s, substantial portions of Zürichgau were owned by the Abbey of St. Gall. In c. 760, an administrative re-organisation under counts Ruthard and Warin exempted the castle town of Zurich from comital rule. A county of Zürichgau was established under Louis the Pious, for a count Ruadker, in 820. Zürichgau (Zurichgeuue) remained a nominally separate territory in the later 9th century but was often ruled by the same count as Thurgau. In 915, Zürichgau together with Thurgau fell to the Bucharding dukes of Swabia. In the late 10th century, the county of Zurich was ruled by the Nellenburger, and during 1077–1172 by the Lenzburger.\n\nBy the 13th century, Zürichgau was divided between the Habsburgs and the Kyburger, who held the territory west and east of Lake Zurich, respectively.[9]\n\nCity state\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Republic of Zürich and Old Swiss Confederacy\n\nThe territory of the canton of Zurich corresponds to the lands acquired by the city of Zurich after it became reichsfrei in 1218. Zurich pursued a policy of aggressive territorial expansion especially during the century following the revolution of the guilds in 1336. Zurich joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1351.\n\nZurich claimed and lost the Toggenburg in the Old Zürich War of the 1440s. The northern parts up to the river Rhine came to the canton after the city of Zurich purchased Winterthur from the Habsburgs in 1468. In 1651, Zurich purchased Rafzerfeld from the counts of Sulz. At this point, almost all of the territory of the modern canton (as well as some territories beyond its modern borders) was owned by Zurich; exceptions include Wülflingen (acquired 1760), Buch (acquired 1761), Dietikon, which was a condominium, and Rheinau (owned by Rheinau Abbey).\n\nIn the 18th century, the \"inner bailiwicks\" (Innere Vogteien) were under direct administration of city officials, while the \"outer bailiwicks\" (Äussere Vogteien) were ruled by the reeves of Kyburg, Grüningen, Greifensee, Eglisau, Regensberg, Andelfingen, Wädenswil, and Knonau. The city of Winterthur was nominally subject to Zurich but retained far-reaching autonomy.\n\nZürichgau, the name of the medieval pagus, was in use for the territories of the city of Zurich during the 15th and 16th century; the term canton (Kanton) gradually entered use in the 16th century, but Zürichgau remained widely used well into the 19th century (becoming obsolescent after the formation of the modern canton in 1831).\n\nUnder the short-lived Helvetic Republic (1798–1803), the canton of Zurich became a purely administrative division. In 1803, some former possessions of Zurich to the west gained independence as part of the Canton of Aargau. In 1804 the Kantonspolizei Zürich was established as Landjägerkorps (rural police).[10]\n\nModern canton\n\n[edit]\n\nA cantonal constitution was drawn up in 1814 and replaced in 1831 by a radical-liberal constitution. The Züriputsch, an armed uprising of the conservative rural population against the radical-liberal order, led to the dissolution of the cantonal government, and a provisional conservative government was installed by colonel Paul Carl Eduard Ziegler. Under the threat of intervention of the other radical-liberal cantons of the Confederacy, the provisional government declared that the 1831 constitution would remain in effect. In a tumultuous session on 9 September 1839, the cantonal parliament declared its dissolution In the so-called Septemberregime, the newly elected cantonal government replaced all cantonal officials with conservatives, but it was again ousted by a radical-liberal election victory in 1844.\n\nAlfred Escher was a member of the new cantonal parliament of 1844; he was elected to the cantonal government in 1848 and later in the same year into the first National Council under the new federal constitution. The radical-liberal era of 1844–1868 was dominated by the so-called System Escher, a network of liberal politicians and industrialists built by Alfred Escher. Escher governed the canton almost in monarchical fashion, and was popularly dubbed Alfred I. or Tsar of All Zurich. Escher controlled all cantonal institutions, at first with very little political opposition, expunging all trace of the conservative takeover of 1839. Under Escher, the city of Zurich rose to the status of economic and financial center it still retains. Opposition against the dominance of Sytstem Escher increased after 1863. The cantonal government was accused to continue the system of aristocratic rule liberalism had claimed to abolish. The oppositional Democratic Movement was centered in Winterthur, led by mayor Johann Jakob Sulzer and publicist Salomon Bleuler. They succeeded in imposing the introduction of the direct democratic instrument of the popular initiative in 1865, which precipitated a revision of the cantonal constitution. In April 1869, a new cantonal constitution was adopted by popular vote, introducing additional direct democratic elements and the popular election of both the cantonal government and the cantonal representatives in the federal Council of States. The new constitution also abolished the death penalty (the last execution by hanging in Zurich took place in 1810, the last public execution by guillotine in 1865), guaranteed freedom of religion and freedom of association and introduced progressive taxes.\n\nIn 1877, the Cantonal Laboratory Zurich was founded in order to regulate the quality of food and drinking water. The first cantonal chemist was Haruthiun Abeljanz, who was instrumental in setting up the new laboratory, moving it from an unpromising start in converted storage rooms to Lintheschergasse 10, which was located just behind the Pestalozziwiese, a memorial to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.[11]\n\nThe Cantonal Bank was established in 1870 to regulate cantonal loans at fixed interest rates to farms and businesses.\n\nA law of proportional representation was passed in 1916, favouring the rise of the Social Democrats. A proposal for the introduction of female suffrage was rejected in 1920; female suffrage was introduced on the municipal level in 1969 and on the cantonal level in 1970, shortly before its imposition by federal law, passed in 1971.\n\nEconomic growth continued in the 20th century. A first airport was built at Dübendorf in 1910, replaced by the international airport at Kloten in 1948. Rapid urbanisation expanded throughout the canton and beyond in the final decades of the 20th century, further accelerated by the S-Bahn from 1990, with only a few municipalities in Weinland, Knonaueramt and Oberland remaining out of easy commuting distance to the city.\n\nThe current constitution replaced the one of 1869 in January 2006.\n\nThe Antiquarische Gesellschaft in Zürich is an organization devoted to preserving the canton's history, the Staatsarchiv Zürich houses the state archives.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe canton of Zurich is situated in the eastern part of the Swiss plateau. It is entirely within the drainage basin of the High Rhine. It is characterized by Glacial landform and traversed by a series of rivers generally flowing south-east to north-west, listed west to east: Reuss, Reppisch, Sihl, Linth-Limmat (forming Lake Zurich), Glatt, Töss and Thur. The main lakes are the Lake Zurich (Linth-Limmat, 88 km2), Greifensee (Glatt, 8.4 km2) and Pfäffikersee (Glatt, 3.3 km2). Minor lakes include Türlersee (Limmat), Katzensee (Glatt), Hüttnersee (Sihl), Lützelsee (Limmat).\n\nIts neighbouring cantons are Schaffhausen to the north, Aargau to the west, the cantons of Zug and Schwyz to the south and the cantons of Thurgau and St. Gallen to the east.\n\nIt also has an international border with the German district of Waldshut and though only for 460 m (1,510 ft)) the district of Konstanz in Baden-Württemberg owing to its short border with Stemmer, an outlying hamlet belonging to the municipality which forms the small German enclave of Büsingen am Hochrhein.\n\nThe canton can be roughly divided into the city and lake, the Unterland in the northwest, the Oberland in the southeast, the Weinland and Winterthur in the northeast, and the Knonaueramt southwest of the Albis. The Zurich Metropolitan Area extends beyond the cantonal borders.\n\nThe canton has an area, as of 2011 , of 1,728.8 square kilometers (667.5 sq mi). Of this area, 43.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while 30.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.1% is settled (buildings or roads) and 5.8% is unproductive land.[12]\n\nMost of the canton consists of shallow river valleys which drain towards the High Rhine to the north. Rafzerfeld is a territory north of the Rhine acquired by the canton in 1651. In the northwest and southeast of the canton the territory rises towards the Jura and Alps, respectively. The valley of the Linth leads into the Lake Zurich and continues as the Limmat. This valley is the most significant valley of the canton of Zurich. The valley of the Glatt originates in the Greifensee and is separated from the Limmat by ridges. The valley of the Töss is gorge-like. It is located in the east of the canton and is separated from the Toggenburg area in the canton of St. Gallen by a mountainous area.\n\nThe Hörnli (1133 m) is the highest elevation of this mountain ridge. The valley of the river Sihl is located in the west of the canton. In converges with the Limmat in the city of Zurich. The Sihl is separated from the lake of Zurich by the Albis Range. The Albishorn (915 m (3,002 ft)) is the highest elevation of this range. The Schnebelhorn is a mountain located near Fischenthal in the Töss Valley, between the cantons of Zurich (west) and St. Gallen (east). It is the highest summit (1,292 m (4,239 ft)) of the canton of Zurich. The Uetliberg is part of the Albis Range. This mountain is popular with the population of the city of Zurich for recreation.\n\nThe vast majority of the canton lies to the south of the Rhine, the exceptions being Rafzerfeld as mentioned and a tiny portion of the village of Laufen-Uhwiesen called Nohl.\n\nCoat of arms\n\n[edit]\n\nThe blazon of the coat of arms is Per bend azure and argent.[13]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nLegislative power\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Cantonal Council (Kantonsrat) has 180 members elected every four years.\n\nExecutive power\n\n[edit]\n\nThe canton is governed by a seven-member council (Regierungsrat). On 24 March 2019, the following were elected for four years:\n\nJacqueline Fehr (SP)\n\nMario Fehr (Independent)[14]\n\nMartin Neukom (Greens)\n\nNatalie Rickli (SVP)\n\nSilvia Steiner (CVP)\n\nErnst Stocker (SVP)\n\nCarmen Walker Späh (FDP)\n\nPolitical subdivisions\n\n[edit]\n\nDistricts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe canton is divided into 12 districts (German: Bezirke):\n\nZurich comprises the city of Zurich\n\nAffoltern with capital Affoltern am Albis\n\nAndelfingen with capital Andelfingen\n\nBülach with capital Bülach\n\nDielsdorf with capital Dielsdorf\n\nDietikon with capital Dietikon\n\nHinwil with capital Hinwil\n\nHorgen with capital Horgen\n\nMeilen with capital Meilen\n\nPfäffikon with capital Pfäffikon\n\nUster with capital Uster\n\nWinterthur with capital Winterthur\n\nMunicipalities\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are, as of December 2015 , 169 municipalities in the canton (Politische Gemeinden).[15]\n\nMerger of municipalities\n\n[edit]\n\nThere were no changes between 1934 and 2013, but the following occurred after 2013.\n\n2014: Bertschikon bei Attikon and Wiesendangen → Wiesendangen[16][17]\n\n2015: Bauma and Sternenberg → Bauma[18][19]\n\n2016: Kyburg → Illnau-Effretikon.[20]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2011 federal election the most popular party was the SVP which received 29.8% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SP (19.3%), the FDP (11.6%) and the glp (11.5%).[21]\n\nThe SVP received about the same percentage of the vote as they did in the 2007 Federal election (33.9% in 2007 vs 29.8% in 2011). The SPS retained about the same popularity (19.8% in 2007), as well as the FDP (13.2% in 2007), while the glp was the big winner of the election (7.0% in 2007).[22]\n\nFederal election results\n\n[edit]\n\nPercentage of the total vote per party in the canton in the Federal Elections 1971–2019[23] Party Ideology 1971 1975 1979 1983 1987 1991 1995 1999 2003 2007 2011 2015 2019 SVP/UDC Right-wing populism 12.2 11.3 14.5 13.8 15.2 20.2 25.5 32.5 33.4 33.9 29.8 30.7 26.7 SP/PS Social democracy 20.9 23.9 26.5 23.0 17.4 18.8 23.1 25.6 25.7 19.8 19.3 21.4 17.3 GPS/PES Green politics * * 1.3 4.2 8.0 7.0 6.5 4.1 8.5 10.4 8.4 6.9 14.1 GLP/PVL Green liberalism * * * * * * * * * 7.0 11.5 8.2 14.0 FDP.The Liberals Classical liberalism 16.8 18.5 22.4 21.8 20.3 18.7 18.1 17.8 16.2 13.2 11.6 15.3 13.7 CVP/PDC/PPD/PCD Christian democracy 9.5 9.4 9.7 9.1 7.1 5.9 4.9 5.1 5.4 7.6 5.0 4.2 4.4 EVP/PEV Christian democracy 5.2 5.4 5.7 5.4 4.4 4.8 3.7 3.4 4.1 3.7 3.1 3.1 3.3 BDP/PBD Conservatism * * * * * * * * * * 5.3 3.6 1.6 EDU/UDF Christian right * 0.5 0.4 0.6 1.8 1.8 1.9 1.8 2.1 2.1 2.2 2.1 1.6 PdA/PST-POP/PC/PSL Communism 1.6 1.1 1.2 0.3 0.3 * * * * 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 SD/DS Swiss nationalism 5.0 4.4 2.5 5.9 5.0 5.2 3.3 1.5 0.9 0.5 0.3 0.2 0.2 LPS/PLS Libertarianism * * * * * * 0.5 0.2 * * * * * Ring of Independents Social liberalism 16.5 15.6 11.2 9.9 11.6 6.1 5.3 2.1 * * * * * CSP/PCS Christian socialism * * * * * * 0.2 0.2 * 0.1 0.2 * * POCH Communism * 1.5 2.3 3.8 3.8 * * * * * * * FGA Feminism * * * 0.6 2.4 2.7 1.8 1.4 1.1 Rep.

Even though Zwingli died in battle in 1531, the canton remained a stronghold of the Swiss Reformed Church over the following centuries. While a plurality of the population is Protestant (43%), 31% of the population was Roman Catholic in 2004,[27] a legacy of considerable immigration from Southern Europe.\n\nFrom the 2000 census , 497,986 or 39.9% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church, while 380,440 or 30.5% were Roman Catholic.

The lands to the north and east are more agricultural, but in every part of the canton manufacturing predominates. The canton of Zurich is noted for machinery. Silk and cotton weaving were important in the past, but have now ceased to be of importance. There is a large paper industry. Small and middle sized companies are important contributors to the economy of the canton of Zurich. The city of Zurich is a major banking centre, and insurance is also of importance.\n\nIn 2014, about 1.2% of the workers in Zurich work in the primary sector (the total for all of Switzerland is 3.3%).

The tertiary sector employed 836,410 or about 84.1% of the total, which is much higher than 74.9% nationwide. This number has increased by about 180,000 since 2010 while the population in the canton has only increased by 73,000 over the same time period.[28] Of those in the tertiary sector, the fourth largest sub-sector (in 2008) was financial services with 6.2% of the tertiary total.[29][30]\n\nAs of 2010 , Zurich had an unemployment rate of 3.9%.

The centre for transport is Zurich, where a great number of local railways connect to national and international rail links. The railway station of the city of Zurich, Zürich Hauptbahnhof, is one of the busiest in Europe, counting the number of arriving and departing trains. Zurich is well connected to other European cities using rail links. The major trains ICE, TGV and Cisalpino connect to Zurich.\n\nThe first Swiss railway ran in the Limmat valley in 1847, connecting Zurich to Baden.\n\nThe major airport of Switzerland Zurich Airport is located in Kloten, a mere 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) from the city centre of Zurich. It is home to Swiss International Air Lines.\n\nThe A1, A3 and A4 motorways run through the canton. Other motorways and expressways which also run through the canton include the A7, the A51, the A52 and the A53. Major hubs are Zurich and Winterthur.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Zurich about 493,209 or (39.5%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 212,154 or (17.0%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).
