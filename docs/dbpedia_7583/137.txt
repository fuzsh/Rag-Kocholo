The 4-star Apart hotel ADAGIO Zürich City Center consists of 64 flats, of which 28 are studios for 2 persons, 16 are twin studios, and 20 are two-room apartments for 4 persons. Each flat has a separate bedroom, a kitchen, a work area and a living room with sofa bed. Our hotel residence is ideally located, only a 10-minute walk from the central station and a short tram and bus ride away. Only two tram stops away from the city centre and its many shops. The Grossmunster church or the Fraumünster monastery with its famous stained glass windows designed by Chagall are also within easy reach. If you want to get some height, there's no better place than the Uetliberg, which dominates the city at 871 metres above sea level and is easily accessible by train from the main station. From there, you can enjoy a breathtaking view of the city, its lake and the Alps in the background. Whatever the length of your stay in Zurich, the hotel offers modern facilities to ensure a unique stay, including a range of services such as a shared restaurant, bar, breakfast service, parking for 29 cars, 3 meeting rooms, a fitness centre and a terrace on the 7th floor.
