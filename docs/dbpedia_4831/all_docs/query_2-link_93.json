How many have you seen?\n\n21 September 2018\n\nGerman Expressionism\n\nNosferatu (1922)\n\nDirector: F.W. Murnau\n\nExaggerated sets and shadows were the name of the game in 1920s German cinema, establishing a hugely influential style that has shaped the crime and horror genres ever since. This early Dracula adaptation contains some of the era’s most famous images.\n\nGet the latest from the BFI\n\nSign up for BFI news, features, videos and podcasts.\n\nEmail\n\nMetropolis (1927)\n\nDirector: Fritz Lang\n\nFritz Lang’s expressionist, dystopian vision is one of the first science fiction feature films, and is arguably the most influential.\n\nM (1931)\n\nDirector: Fritz Lang\n\nThe blueprint for the modern serial killer film can be found in this landmark crime movie, starring Peter Lorre as a compulsive child murderer on the run from police and criminals alike.\n\nSoviet montage\n\nBattleship Potemkin (1925)\n\nDirector: Sergei M. Eisenstein\n\nA fixture in the critical canon (and university curricula) almost since its premiere, Sergei Eisenstein’s film about a 1905 naval mutiny was revolutionary in both form and content. Understanding the editing techniques known as Soviet montage begins here.\n\nItalian neorealism\n\nRome Open City (1945)\n\nDirector: Roberto Rossellini\n\nDeveloped out of the ruins of the Second World War, the Italian neorealism movement brought a new street-level authenticity to filmmaking. Roberto Rossellini’s Rome Open City was a milestone release.\n\nBicycle Thieves (1948)\n\nDirector: Vittorio De Sica\n\nVittorio De Sica’s story of a father and son searching for a stolen bicycle on the streets of Rome is a classic of postwar Italian cinema.\n\nWorld cinema classics\n\nSpring in a Small Town (1948)\n\nDirector: Fei Mu\n\nFei Mu’s newly restored 1948 masterpiece, a piercingly poignant study of adulterous desire, was once voted the greatest Chinese film ever made.\n\nThe Red Shoes (1948)\n\nDirectors: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger\n\nAmong the most celebrated of all British films, this hugely influential melodrama from the creative duo Powell and Pressburger centres on a ballerina torn between love and her career.\n\nRashomon (1950)\n\nDirector: Akira Kurosawa\n\nCredited with bringing Japanese cinema to worldwide audiences, Akira Kurosawa’s breakthrough tells the story of a murder in the woods from four differing perspectives.\n\nTokyo Story (1953)\n\nDirector: Yasujiro Ozu\n\nA constant fixture in critics’ polls, Yasujiro Ozu’s most enduring masterpiece is a beautifully nuanced exploration of filial duty, expectation and regret.\n\nOrdet (1955)\n\nDirector: Carl Theodor Dreyer\n\nCarl Theodor Dreyer’s beautifully photographed tale explores the religious intolerance and tensions within a Danish farming family.\n\nThe Seventh Seal (1957)\n\nDirector: Ingmar Bergman\n\nSwedish auteur Ingmar Bergman’s best-known film is a brilliant allegorical drama starring Max von Sydow as a knight trying to elude his own death.\n\nRocco and His Brothers (1960)\n\nDirector: Luchino Visconti\n\nItalian maestro Luchino Visconti’s epic drama follows a mother and her five sons who move from a small town to Milan, changing their lives forever.\n\nRed Desert (1964)\n\nDirector: Michelangelo Antonioni\n\nMichelangelo Antonioni’s mid-career masterpiece stars Monica Vitti as an emotionally anguished young woman embarking on a tentative affair with a businessman (Richard Harris).\n\nThe French New Wave\n\nBreathless (1960)\n\nDirector: Jean-Luc Godard\n\nEmerging in the late 1950s and early 60s, the young directors of the French New Wave threw out the rulebook and helped reinvent cinema for the modern era. Jean-Luc Godard’s extraordinary debut feature, an insouciant and iconoclastic crime film, is a release all film students will get to know.\n\nParis nous appartient (1961)\n\nDirector: Jacques Rivette\n\nThis remarkable first feature from cinematic visionary Jacques Rivette brilliantly captures the mood of paranoia and uncertainty of the Cold War period.\n\nBritish kitchen sink films\n\nThis Sporting Life (1963)\n\nDirector: Lindsay Anderson\n\nBritish filmmakers of the 60s also embraced a new realism, shifting the focus to the working class and the cities of northern England. Lindsay Anderson’s fantastic first feature masterfully dissects the brutal life struggles of a rough-edged rugby footballer on and off the field.\n\nBilly Liar (1963)\n\nDirector: John Schlesinger\n\nMixing realism with fantasy, this classic from the British New Wave features Tom Courtenay as the clerk whose overactive daydreaming compensates for a dull provincial life.\n\nNew German Cinema\n\nFear Eats the Soul (1974)\n\nDirector: Rainer Werner Fassbinder\n\nDirectors including Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders and Rainer Werner Fassbinder were among the new guard who helped spawn the New German Cinema movement of the 60s and 70s. Fassbinder’s international breakthrough, Fear Eats the Soul is an unconventional love story that combines lucid social analysis with devastating emotional power.\n\nKings of the Road (1976)\n\nDirector: Wim Wenders\n\nOne of the finest achievements of New German Cinema, Wenders’ remarkable road-movie follows two young men as they travel through a country in the midst of momentous change.\n\nStroszek (1977)\n\nDirector: Werner Herzog\n\nWerner Herzog’s uniquely skewed take on Americana follows the journey of Bruno S. as he leaves Berlin for the bleak trailer parks of Wisconsin.\n\nThe birth of American indie\n\nThe Exiles (1961)\n\nDirector: Kent Mackenzie\n\nAway from the big-budgets and gloss of Hollywood, there’s the alternative history of American independent filmmaking. Made on a shoestring, The Exiles is Kent Mackenzie’s gritty, vérité depiction of the lives of marginalised Native Americans living in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976)\n\nDirector: John Cassavetes\n\nJohn Cassavetes is a major figure in the story of US indie. The Killing of a Chinese Bookie is his uncompromising character study of a gangster, with Ben Gazzara as the small-time club owner whose life begins to spin out of control.\n\nAnger Me (2006)\n\nDirector: Elio Gelmini\n\nThis documentary tells the story of another key filmmaker of the American undergound, Kenneth Anger. Made on the fringes of Hollywood, Anger birthed bold, erotic fantasias, including Fireworks (1947) and Scorpio Rising (1963), that remain classics of avant-garde cinema.\n\nPsychoanalysis\n\nUn chien andalou (1929)\n\nDirectors: Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí\n\nA scabrous study of desire, the subconscious and anti-clericalism, Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí’s provocative first film is a classic of surrealist cinema.\n\nPeeping Tom (1960)\n\nDirector: Michael Powell\n\nMichael Powell’s dark, disturbing, once controversial tale of a shy camera technician who films women as he kills them is now rightly deemed a classic.\n\nRiddles of the Sphinx (1977)\n\nDirector: Laura Mulvey\n\nLaura Mulvey and Peter Wollen’s visually accomplished and intellectually rigorous film is one of the most important avant-garde films of the 1970s, examining the position of women within the patriarchy through a prism of psychoanalysis.\n\nDead Ringers (1988)\n\nDirector: David Cronenberg\n\nDavid Cronenberg’s multi award-winning psychological thriller exploring the bizarre lives of identical twins Elliot and Beverly, both played by Jeremy Irons.\n\nNew forms in British cinema\n\nLondon (1994)\n\nDirector: Patrick Keiller\n\nThe first in Patrick Keiller’s highly imaginative trilogy of films is a photographic trip through London, recounted by our unseen narrator.\n\nRed Road (2006)\n\nDirector: Andrea Arnold\n\nAndrea Arnold’s highly acclaimed film, winner of top prizes at Cannes and the BFI London Film Festival, is a haunting drama about a woman confronting past demons.\n\nSleep Furiously (2008)\n\nDirector: Gideon Koppel\n\nGideon Koppel’s charming documentary about a small farming community in mid-Wales, observing the unalterable rhythms of country life and the monthly visits of a mobile library.\n\nThe Arbor (2010)\n\nDirector: Clio Barnard\n\nClio Barnard’s film about Bradford playwright Andrea Dunbar mixes reconstruction, interviews (performed by actors) and scenes from the plays.\n\nFurther Beyond (2016)\n\nDirectors: Joe Lawlor and Christine Molloy\n\nDesperate Optimists’ (Joe Lawlor and Christine Molloy) deliriously deconstructed biopic of the extraordinary Ambrosio O’Higgins, who left Ireland to become the captain general of Chile in the Spanish Empire.\n\nNew directions in international cinema\n\nThe Headless Woman (2008)\n\nDirector: Lucrecia Martel\n\nStart our tasting menu of new trends in world cinema with Lucrecia Martel’s acclaimed psychological thriller, in which a woman is plagued by paranoia after she hits something – or someone – with her car.\n\nDogtooth (2009)\n\nDirector: Yorgos Lanthimos\n\nYorgos Lanthimos’s scary, witty tale of a dysfunctional Greek family is original, ingenious and sadly relevant as a study of parent-child relationships.\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (2010)\n\nDirector: Apichatpong Weerasethaku\n\nElena (2011)\n\nDirector: Andrey Zvyagintsev\n\nNorte, the End of History (2013)\n\nDirector: Lav Diaz\n\nJauja (2014)\n\nDirector: Lisandro Alonso\n\nBy the Time It Gets Dark (2016)\n\nDirector: Anocha Suwichakornpong\n\nAnocha Suwichakornpong’s mesmerising and innovative treatise on memory, politics and cinema.\n\nDiscover award-winning independent British and international cinema\n\nFree for 14 days, then £4.99/month or £49/year.\n\nTry for free"
