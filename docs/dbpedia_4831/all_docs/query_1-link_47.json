        "text": "IT rises like a glistening flute of Champagne from the beer-bottle skyline, as if in toast to a New Year's mix of emotions: hope and loss; love found and love betrayed; what can be and what almost was. And when you see it, you know instantly, absolutely, where the movie wants you to be.\n\nAh, the Chrysler Building: Manhattan.\n\nNot even the Empire State Building is as immediately identifiable, or can say so much so quickly. Shimmering in the morning sun or under spotlight beams at midnight, the Chrysler Building can evoke everything from East Side sophistication to Big City hollowness. In \"Someone to Watch Over Me,\" Ridley Scott's 1987 thriller, a police detective and family man from Queens obsesses over a beautiful Manhattan socialite. And what dominates the western horizon from his working-class home in Queens, almost in taunt, is the Chrysler Building, seductive, unreal.\n\nIn truth, the building has rarely glittered as brightly on film as it does in real life. Beyond anchoring the establishing shot of many movies set in New York over the last several decades, it is almost never the star. More often it has served as the dependable character actor who gamely supports the marquee attraction, a Van Johnson to Gene Kelly.\n\nThis second-billing relegation began when the Chrysler Building was but an ing√©nue. Movie lore has it that in the 1933 picture that bears his name, King Kong was originally going to swat airplanes from the building's silvery spire. But the Empire State Building, finished in 1931, soon stole the thunder, and the gig, when it eclipsed the Chrysler Building's blink-of-an-eye reign as the world's tallest. In clips and stills from that movie, there in the background sulks a dwarfed Chrysler Building."
