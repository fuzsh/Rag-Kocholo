        "text": "“This film is an incredibly beautiful and important tribute to our country, right at the perfect time.” – Justin Folk, Director, What is a Woman? and No Safe Spaces\n\n“With this film, Mike Rowe builds on Paul Harvey’s gift to us all. Now, a new generation of Americans can learn about history in a manner that seeks to unify rather than divide.” – Bob Crawford, Historian & Bassist, The Avett Brothers\n\n“Mike Rowe, a modern-day Paul Harvey, is a true patriot who encapsulates the best of America. His storytelling is not just creative and winsome, but also carries a crucial message. Something to Stand For is a movie that every American should see. It’s not just historically accurate and insightful, it’s a wake-up call-a reminder that if we don’t stand for something, we’ll fall for anything.” – Dr. Chris Harper, Chief Storyteller, CEO BetterMan\n\n“With one of broadcasting’s all-time great voices, former eagle scout Mike Rowe conjures up the ghost of famed radio storyteller Paul Harvey in a history-based ode to America. A top-notch production. Rowe is his usual legendary self.” – Dan Carlin, Host of Hardcore History podcast\n\n“Amazing stories with fantastic, surprising twists about our nations’ heroes.” – Peter Tilden, co-host of Really? No, Really? with Jason Alexander\n\n“Something to Stand For celebrates the indomitable spirit of patriotism, honors the sacrifices of our heroes, and inspires us all by reminding us of what makes this country so great. With its compelling storytelling, powerful performances, and breathtaking visuals throughout our nation’s capital, it is a must-see for all who cherish freedom and the enduring human spirit.” – Riley Gaines, Champion Swimmer and Women’s Rights Advocate\n\n“If you find yourself annoyed by the negative spew that saturates our screens, Mike Rowe’s Something to Stand For will renew your faith in the American Journey. This film is so rich and deeply stirring that veterans will want to snag that slightly snug-fitting old uniform in the corner, button it up, and go do it all over again.” – Scott Mann, Green Beret, and Best Selling Author of Operation Pineapple Express\n\n“Mike Rowe is part Renaissance man and full on American treasure! “Something To Stand For” breaks all of the rules of filmmaking, and we, the audience, reap the benefits. I did not want it to end!” – Vinnie Tortorich, Fitness Expert, Author, and Documentarian\n\n“Ronald Reagan often described America as a “shining city on a hill” but lately it feels more like a Fixer-Upper on HGTV. Something To Stand For is a weapons-grade dose of perspective that shows why we should be thanking our founding fathers instead of tearing down their statues. A true celebration of our American Privilege that’s a must watch, whether you’re a blue-haired social justice warrior or a guy who eats too much blue cheese, like me.” – Jimmy Failla, Host of Fox News Saturday Night w/ Jimmy Failla\n\n“You’ll be a better American and a better human if you see this movie.” – Adam Carolla, Host of The Adam Carolla Show and Creator and Star of Mr. Birchum\n\n“A love letter to our country, delivered at just the right time. It feels good to feel good again about our country. Thanks, Mike, for reminding us how lucky we are to be Americans. Everyone should watch this film. It’s a delight.” – Kevin O’Connor, This Old House\n\n“Mike Rowe is a master story teller. Something to Stand For is an immersive adventure that brings our history to life. The film is a panacea for the negativity that divides us. It’s a timely reminder of the spirit and values that represent our better selves as Americans. Veterans will appreciate Mike’s take on their experiences and all who see will walk away uplifted.” – Dan Clare, Marine Corps Veteran and Chief Communications & Outreach Officer DAV (Disabled American Veterans)\n\n“In a time when many have lost their sense of patriotism and others are consumed with hatred toward the country they benefit from, Mike Rowe takes us into the heart of what makes America great. Not perfect, for there is no perfect nation. Something to Stand For is a timely film that lifts the spirit and reminds us of what makes a country strong: Its people and its stories. After finishing the movie, I felt proud to be an American again. Something to Stand For gives audiences something to be proud of.” – Zoro, world-renowned drummer and author of Maria’s Scarf: A Memoir of a Mother’s Love, a Son’s Perseverance, and Dreaming Big\n\n“Mike Rowe has created a work so patriotic that it should be mandatory viewing on every high school and college campus in this country!!!” – Mike August, Producer of The Adam Carolla Show and Mr. Birchum\n\n“Take a stroll through America with the stories that made us who we are. ‘Something To Stand For’ serves up American tales with a twist. Join Mike Rowe for an inspiring adventure that’s as educational as it is entertaining—and patriotically spirited, to boot!” – Jordan Harbinger, Host The Jordan Harbinger Show\n\n“What a nice way to celebrate Fourth of July. It’s a movie that makes you proud to be American. Oh yeah—and the presenter’s not half bad!” – Peggy Rowe, Mike’s Mom\n\n“Mike Rowe’s “Something to Stand For” is a road trip, a remedy, a time-traveling odyssey of sorts with Mike in his slightly beat-up Bronco, telling unsung tales of Americans you know of and some you’ve never heard of. Standing ovation to this team of storytellers!” – Alejandro (Alex) Iglesias, Field Producer, Fox News Saturday Night w/ Jimmy Failla\n\n“Mike Rowe makes a film that is to the 4th of July what It’s a Wonderful Life is to Christmas! He makes me cry (more than I care to admit) and laugh. I’m proud and still amazed at the history of this country.” – Enrico Colantoni, Actor (Galaxy Quest, Contagion, Veronica Mars, Just Shoot Me)\n\n“Maybe we’re not all bad, after all – and, just maybe, what America stands for is good. That’s a refreshingly Reaganesque message for a country and culture being bombarded by messages of shame. Something to Stand For follows Mike Rowe as he embarks on a journey across America and through American history. From the American Revolution to World War II, the Civil Rights movement and beyond, viewers will be reminded of (or perhaps told of) the stories of brave men and women who fought to ensure that the USA represented humanity’s highest ideals. America isn’t perfect but we have more than our share of heroes.” – John W. Kennedy, Writer, Producer, Beliefnet.com"
