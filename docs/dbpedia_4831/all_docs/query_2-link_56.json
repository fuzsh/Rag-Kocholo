        "text": "Recently, when I visited my aunt and grandmother in England, I knew three things would be true…\n\nWe would eat roast chicken (my aunt always makes it the night we arrive), we would read poems (my grandmother loves them) and we would watch So I Married an Axe Murderer.\n\nMy family has watched the romantic comedy for decades, and we can quote it beginning to end. Whenever we had crushes on people, my sister and I would say, “I’m smitten. I’m in deep smit.” If we go to pick up a dinner check, but the other person argues, we say, “No to infinity. Negatory. Negatory, good buddy. Ne-ga-to-ry!” If a restaurant serves big drinks, we can’t help commenting, “Excuse me miss, there seems to be a mistake. I believe I ordered the LARGE.”\n\nMy friend Gemma’s family always watches Back To The Future, and another friend hosts an annual Moana viewing with the cousins. Year round, I can watch When Harry Met Sally any day of the week, and Alex estimates that he’s seen Rosemary’s Baby a minimum of 30 times.\n\nSays my friend Lina: “My dad used to watch It’s a Wonderful Life every year when I was a kid, and every year he would WEEP at the end. It would freak me out because it always freaked me out to see my parents cry. So, now I watch it and weep at the end and it freaks my kids out.”\n\nThoughts? What about you? If you’d like inspiration, here are the 10 best and worst family movies, according to kids; and here’s an 8-minute film that will make you cry.\n\nP.S. What are your top three movies of all time, and what TV shows do you watch over and over?\n\nMore to Love\n\n11 fun links, including unfiltered celebrities and the perfect white T-shirt.\n\nAs the mom of a two-year-old, I asked seasoned mothers for their advice."
