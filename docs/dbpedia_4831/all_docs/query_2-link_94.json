        "text": "The call was inevitable. My yiayia (the Greek term for grandmother) was on the phone telling me to stay safe inside because the weather was getting bad. She called every time storm clouds rolled in. I was young and I would laugh, assuring her everything was OK. I wasn’t old enough to know the whole story.\n\nI think of her calls after seeing that the movie Twisters has made over $200 million in global box office. Why? Because tornadoes are more than entertainment for me. My papou (grandfather) died in one, and the movie made me miss someone I never met.\n\nIt would be hypocritical of me to scold people for going to see Twisters because I had a family member die in a tornado. I consume true crime documentaries and podcasts, not taking the time nor having the inclination to forego such indulgences because of the victims and their families. And, no, seeing advertisements for the movie doesn’t trigger trauma. But it does give me pause. A chance for me to remember where I came from. And where I’m going.\n\nStorm chasing has become a thing. Weather as sport. Or entertainment. The potential for social media content, likes, comments, fame. Isn’t that what it’s all about? But tornadoes are not just great entertainment; they are costly and deadly. The Dallas tornadoes that ripped through Royal Lane and elsewhere in October 2019 caused over $1.5 billion in damage, the costliest in state history. The Waco tornado of 1953, the deadliest in state history, killed 114, including Papou and his brother Angelo. The city was changed forever. So was my family.\n\nI am named after him. It is Greek tradition for children to be named after their grandparents, so my middle name is Victor. I hated it as a kid. I love it now. I have been to the little village in Greece where he was born in the late 1800s. I have stood on the spot in the courtyard of the church where he and Yiayia met. (He rode in on a horse, not a donkey like the others, so Yiayia’s sister initially pegged him as a snob.) I have travelled the route they took to their wedding, from the hills of Kremasti to the oceanside below. I prayed inside the little church in Monemvasia where they were married. In Molaoi, I walked inside the house my Mom grew up in, only to be split up from her brothers and sister for years when Germans occupied their home during the war (World War II, but in my family, it is known as “the war”). I have been to the office where they and my mom and the other kids were processed in New York when they returned to America on March 6, 1946, aboard the USS Marine Tiger. Immigrants we all are.\n\nYiayia wore her wedding ring till the day she died, 50 years later. I wish I had had a chance to know him—or have him spoil me the way only grandparents can, then hand me back to my mom with a knowing smile. But I do know him. From those places, stories, pictures, and the example he set for my mom and therefore me. We share more than a name.\n\nPapou died in the restaurant he and his brothers ran, Chris’ Cafe. My uncle and godfather Paul was in there at the time of the tornado. Papou (his father) told him to move from where he was standing. He did and moments later the ceiling caved in on that spot. One of Papou’s final acts saved his life.\n\nIt has taken Dallas and the residents and businesses along Royal Lane years to recover from 2019. Two schools just re-opened last year. It took Waco over 50 years and a TV show to recover from what happened on May 11, 1953. Now every hotel room is booked and restaurant filled with fans going to silos and eating at the Magnolia Table restaurant on the circle. That restaurant used to be the Elite Cafe, opened in 1941 by my relatives. What is often overlooked on tourists’ tours of Waco is the memorial to those died in 1953. On the corner of 4th and Austin, right in the path of the deadly twister, sits a teardrop of granite listing all the names of loved ones lost. Go by and learn about one of the deadliest days in Texas history. Maybe after your visit to the Dr Pepper museum and the Magnolia Market. If you have time.\n\nI thought of all this when I re-read Zac Crain’s book about Dirk last week. Which is really Zac’s book about Zac. Which is really Zac’s book about his son, Isaac. Which is really Zac’s book at his relationship with his son and how Dirk impacted it. A guy who shot a ball bringing a father and son closer. It isn’t really about clicks, likes, and followers after all. It’s all about relationships. Buildings are brick and mortar, events ephemeral. It’s all about how things, events, places, people make us feel. And seeing the success of Twisters makes me feel, well, sorry for my mom who lost her father at age 14. My yiayia who raised four kids and lost the love of her life. For my uncle, who survived but witnessed such tragedy. It also makes me proud to be a part of my family, blessed to have been able to trace the history back to Greece and determined to leave a worthy legacy. We all have our stories. This is mine.\n\nNot only did a tornado change history, but it changed my history. And that’s something no movie can impart. No, I’m not going to see Twisters. I don’t care if you do. But I will check the weather. In case a storm is coming.\n\nI wish I could get that call one more time."
