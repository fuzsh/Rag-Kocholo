        "text": "From films fighting for United States independence to punching aliens in the face to blowing up sharks, movies centered around the Fourth of July have a variety of themes to keep you entertained all day long.\n\nIt is going to be hot for Independence Day, so a movie marathon might just be in order for Thursday. And if you want to keep up with the patriotic theme of the day, we've got movies to keep you, and any guest you have, entertained through the hottest part of the day until you catch the fireworks.\n\nThere's no real scientific method for which movies made the list (most are just what this writer watches on July 4), but it should be good enough to keep you entertained.\n\nCan I buy alcohol on the 4th of July: What to know about alcohol sales in Tennessee\n\nHere are our top picks for your ultimate Fourth of July movie marathon.\n\n'Hamilton'\n\nLet's start at the beginning before the United States became a nation.\n\nThe Broadway smash hit \"Hamilton\" is a great way to kick off the day with the musical stylings of Lin-Manuel Miranda telling about Alexander Hamilton's (Miranda) fight to come to the Americas from the Caribbean to the building of a nation.\n\nAnd while this is technically not a movie, it is the film of the Broadway play. So if you aren't used to plays it might seem a bit odd at first, but you will be humming the songs all day long after you watch it.\n\nWhere can I stream it? Hamilton is only available on Disney+.\n\n'Independence Day'\n\nYou can't go wrong with this classic ― at least for millennials― starring Will Smith punching an alien in the face before dragging it through the desert and having the ultimate breakdown on it crying \"And what is that smell!\" and Bill Pullman pulling off one of the most iconic patriotic speeches a \"president\" has given in an action movie (watch it at the top of this story).\n\nAnd there's not enough ink to talk about Jeff Goldblum.\n\nThe 1996 film was a blockbuster when it premiered in May and continued to gain popularity through the July 4th holiday that year. It even spawned a sequel 20 years later, that didn't quite hit the same note as the original though.\n\nWatch the original trailer below.\n\nWhere can I stream it? If you have a Hulu subscription, you can find it there. If not, you can also download it on multiple different platforms.\n\n'Forrest Gump'\n\nTom Hanks was already a well-known name in Hollywood by the time he landed the lead in \"Forrest Gump\" in 1994. But the movie made him the beloved actor that he is now.\n\nThe story has a place in the Fourth of July line-up because the story follows Forrest Gump, a man with a lower IQ from Alabama, traverses through life being happy and not letting obstacles or setbacks keep him from doing extraordinary things.\n\nThe story goes from his childhood hometown life to joining the military and meeting his lifelong friends Lt. Dan and Bubba to even meeting the president multiple times. The movie captured the hearts of millions over the years and even inspired Gary Sinise, who plays Lt. Dan, to start the Lt. Dan Band that helps support wounded soldiers.\n\nWhere can I stream it? You can watch it for free via Pluto. Paramount+ subscribers can also watch the movie. Hulu, Sling TV, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube TV premium subscribers all have it available as well.\n\n'Oppenheimer'\n\nThis might be a bit of a controversial pick. It's not a film about heroics or Americans saving the planet. But the real-world events the movie is based on are integral parts of United States history with the development of nuclear bombs that brought about the end of World War II.\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" not only looks at the building of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project but also at the aftermath of such a destructive and deadly weapon, Oppenheimer's role post World War II in political arenas and the start of the nuclear arms race with Russia.\n\nWhere can I stream it? \"Oppenheimer\" is available to stream on Amazon. You can also purchase it on multiple different platforms.\n\n'Jaws'\n\nDun, dun. Dun, dun.\n\nHow strange that with just a couple of notes (given word form in this case) and a majority of people could tell you what film you are talking about. But for those who don't know the famous musical score, we are talking about Jaws.\n\nThe 1975 thriller, shows a quaint coastal town getting ready for the July summer tourist season. There's only one problem, a giant great white shark lurking and ready to chomp on unsuspecting beachgoers. The unlikely trio of stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, a marine biologist played by Richard Dreyfuss and a professional shark hunter played by Robert Shaw, set out to sea to hunt down the man-eating shark.\n\nBeyond the musical score, this is a Steven Speilberg film from when he was in his heyday.\n\nWhere can I stream it? This classic isn't on any streaming services at this time, but you can buy it on Amazon or if you have cable you can catch it sometime this holiday weekend.\n\n'National Treasure'\n\nIf you are looking for something a bit more lighthearted with a treasure hunt and the stealing of the Declaration of Independence, this would be a good one to put in your rotation.\n\nThis 2004 starring Nicholas Cage, brings the treasure hunt to the screen as his character Benjamin Franklin Gates, along with Diane Kruger as Dr. Abigail Chase and Justin Bartha as Riley Poole look to the past clues to figure out where the fabled national treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers of the United States and Freemasons during the American Revolutionary War is.\n\nThe movie might have gotten mixed reviews, but it's a fun movie that you don't have to think too hard about.\n\nWhere can I stream it? You can stream it on Disney+ or buy it on several platforms.\n\nWhat about other July 4th movies?\n\nThis is just a small taste of movies that are available to get you through the Fourth of July holiday and into the weekend. Here's a couple of more if the ones above aren't ones for you.\n\nStreaming on Netflix:\n\n\"American Graffiti\"\n\n\"Born on the Fourth of July\"\n\n\"Da 5 Bloods\"\n\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\"\n\nStreaming on Disney+:"
