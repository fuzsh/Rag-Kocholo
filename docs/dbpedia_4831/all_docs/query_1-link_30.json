        "text": "July 18, 2013\n\nI was lucky enough to win an advanced copy of this book and I cannot tell you what a stunning debut novel this is for Madeleine Reiss. I literally couldn't put it down from page one.\n\nCarrie is married to Damian and is the mother to five year old Charlie. Molly is married to Rupert and is mother to five year old Max. Charlie, a delightful little boy, goes missing after a day at the beach after meeting, and playing for a short while with, Max. The story that unfolds is simply heartbreaking for Carrie, as the Police never find Charlie or a body and she is left without any idea as to what happened to him, and blames herself for falling asleep briefly whilst Max was playing nearby. Damian too blames Carrie and their previously happy marriage ultimately fails.\n\nMolly has a particularly sad life but her relationship with Max is very strong and they have a very close bond. Rupert is a manipulative bully and Molly paints landscapes to help her unwind and rid herself of the stresses of the marriage.\n\nCarrie and Molly's lives become inextricably entwined and the story moves along at a breathtaking pace as its nears the end.\n\nI will not say anymore about the plot, so as not to spoil it for anyone, except to say that this is a simply stunning first novel and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nI cannot recommend this book highly enough and eagerly await Madeleine Reiss's next novel.\n\n5/5\n\nSeptember 2, 2014\n\nI was excited that this book was to be the Book Club read, I had heard great things about this book.\n\nHowever as I started to read I soon realised that although I wasn't gripped by the story I did want to find out what happened. Then as the story went along I was realising that it was to be very predictable and I was bored!!!\n\nThe story started off well, but I didn't like the way it kept jumping about to past and present. I could relate to Carrie and Damian easily, a mothers worst nightmare, trying to hold things together with her husband but the loss of Charlie and being in limbo was just too much to bear.\n\nI could also relate to Molly, Rupert and Max….their characters were also believable and I really felt for Molly and Max.\n\nSome of the other characters however, such as Pam, Jen, Ruth and Oliver just seemed to be 'put' in the story somehow and just didn't connect properly within the storyline.\n\nI think the author should of stuck to one story rather than the two running alongside each other.\n\nI am sad to say I was disappointed in this book, and was glad when I had turned the last page.\n\nJanuary 18, 2016\n\nI don't know where to start with this review. This book is haunting and beautiful and sweet and hold-your-breath thrilling.\n\nYou know when you loved reading a book so much that you can't put into words exactly how it made you feel and what you think? I'm up against that problem right now. Check back later when I've had even more time to gather my thoughts.\n\nI received a copy of this for free via Goodreads First Reads.\n\nMay 10, 2013\n\nWell. Where to start. Maybe with a huge thanks to the girls at Harper Collins who sent me an advanced copy of this book. Lets say this. You want this book for when you are sitting on the beach. I said it would be the read of the Summer and I don’t think I am wrong. You want this book if you need to curl up under a blanket indoors because as often happens, British Summertime never arrives. You want this book even if you are not having a holiday, just because I’m telling you – you want this book.\n\nCarrie falls asleep on the beach, very briefly, and when she wakes up her 5 year old son Charlie is gone. We’ve all done it – taken our eyes off them for a brief moment in time, usually without consequence – but the consequences for Carrie are severe, and here starts her story. Living with the guilt sometime later, she has moved on as much as is possible under these circumstances, and life is continuing. A series of events sets in motion a possibility of closure..but what exactly will Carrie have to face to achieve this? In the meantime, on Charlie’s last day on the beach, he met and played with another little boy – Max. Max’s mother Molly is facing her own personal issues and tragedies, and interspersed with Carrie’s story we also have Molly’s. What will happen when the worlds of these two women collide? You will have to read to find the answers – and trust me, you want to do that.\n\nI both laughed and cried while I was reading this book. It will take you in unexpected directions. It will tug at your heartstrings and make you consider the people in your life and what they mean to you. It is also a great mystery story – the two sides of this novel if you like come together perfectly – and by the end I was a bit of an emotional wreck in the best “reading” way possible. I wish I could start again. In fact I’m sure one day I will. The characters are real people facing real situations and it speaks to the feelings of grief and horror and that “how can this happen to me” feeling that everyone gets at some point in their life. The fact that I am going through something myself at the moment – nothing at all as heartbreaking as the loss of a child, but still heartbreaking in its own way – means that this book was extremely meaningful for me at a time I needed an outlet for that kind of emotion. This is why books speak to us isnt it?\n\nSo, to sum up. Great story. Great characters. Emotive and brilliantly written – you will love it. Don’t miss it.\n\nSeptember 1, 2014\n\nSomeone to Watch Over Me - Madeleine Reiss\n\nRead this book and cannot say I was overly impressed with it.\n\nDamian and their son Charlie are enjoying a day at the beach when the unthinkable happens. It's every parent's worst nightmare and was well portrayed. After the detials of this have been set, the book then jumps and Carrie is coming to terms with the feelings etc of that terrible day.\n\nThe book then goes on to the side of Molly, a single mother bringing up her little son, Max, who was playing with Charlie that day on the beach.\n\nThe book then flits back and forth between these two characters along with others that come in and go out, detailing in some great depth the minor details of how the shop is laid out that Carrie runs along with the assistance that she gets etc, to the man over the road and various other bits that I didn't think had any relevance to the story of the missing boy.\n\nThe investigation into him disappearing seems to taper off and we have left with that unknown occurence of whether he was snatched, swept to sea etc.\n\nCharlie's involvement in this is another point that doesnt gel with me and as much as you can understand possibly his point of view, you end up thinking of him talking to an imaginery friend (as most kids usually have).\n\nOverall not a book I was fond of, was glad that I had read this and read this for the book group - but not one I would recommend or read again.\n\nDecember 16, 2015\n\nThis one goes into my top three best freebies this year. I loved it. I laughed and cried and mumbled under my breath but I was totally swept up into the story, I must say.\n\nVery impressed it's the author's first book as well !! Blimey....\n\nThere were some VERY funny lines in it throughout. The story itself relates a tale of woe but even tales of woe need some light relief and it certainly had that. Carrie's mother's advice about strangers on tube trains I found hysterical !!\n\nNow I'm no lover of children but couldn't fail to feel for both Max and Charlie, the boys in the story. They were both sweet kids. It takes a good author to make me appreciate two-footed beasties!!\n\nOne passage she wrote will stay with me and when I can quote it without sobbing down the phone I'll share it with my mum who will totally \"get it\"....\"It was not simply the loss of someone you loved that stayed with you for the rest of your life,it was the loss of the person that you would have been if you had been allowed to have them forever\"....\n\nThe only mistakes I spotted were one set of dropped speechmarks and one missed fullstop !! I tell you, I'm reading a Lynda La Plante now and she could learn a thing or two about getting e-books properly edited !!\n\nA cracking debut and a beautiful cover as well. I'll be hoping for a new one by her soon I'll happily pay for.\n\nAugust 8, 2013\n\nI should start a new line in one word book reviews – in this case that one word would be AMAZING!\n\nSomeone To Watch Over Me had me gripped from the start. It is the night before Carrie opens her new shop, Trove and we learn that Carrie is feeling a “familiar sadness”. We’re immediately taken back some years earlier when Carrie and her family go to the beach to make the most of a perfect summer day.\n\nWhilst enjoying their time on the beach, Carrie’s Son, Charlie spends some time with a young boy named Max. As the day goes on, Carrie drifts off to sleep and when she awakes, Charlie is nowhere to be seen.\n\nWe are then introduced to the boy Charlie met earlier, Max and his Mother, Molly. The two of them reside in their cosy Countryside home. Max’s Father, Rupert no longer lives with them but is making regular, silent phone calls to their house.\n\nWe return to the beach in the moments that follow the discovery that Charlie is missing, which are fast-paced and gripping and so well described that you become a part of the search for Charlie and you can feel every inch of panic along with his heartbroken parents. Charlie isn’t found and as darkness falls, Carrie and her Husband, Damian are forced to return home without him.\n\nThe story continues with the switching between the stories of the two families, and between the present and the past. Molly and Rupert are no longer together as Rupert has been violent towards Molly on many a past occasion. Carrie and Damian are also no longer together, unable to cope with the loss of their Son and with the uncertainty of what happened to him when he went missing. We are taken through Molly and Rupert’s brutal relationship with Molly’s efforts to cover up her Husband’s behaviour and her feelings of not being able to talk to anyone about what happened. The feelings of despair entwined within Carrie and Damian’s relationship are brought to the surface and we suffer their break up along with them.\n\nBoth of these ladies are now trying their best to move forward, to leave the scars of their pasts behind them. New homes, new friends and new relationships. Carrie’s journey to discover what happened to her Son and Molly’s efforts to protect both herself and Max from Rupert bring their two worlds together when suddenly, their paths cross once again and Max confides that he’s been talking to Charlie. Their estranged Husband’s reappear and both Carrie and Molly have to fight their pasts once more. Will they leave their pasts behind them and move on or will they find comfort in their history, with the Men they once loved?\n\nSomeone To Watch Over Me is a beautifully told story, Madeleine Reiss’ descriptions bring each environment and every moment to life. We are carried along the seasons by the decorating of Trove, we are introduced to some great secondary characters in Carrie’s friend and business partner, Jen, as well as her Mother and her neighbours (including the luscious Oliver) and we are encouraged to grasp every emotion going. This novel is tear-jerking, heartwarming, funny, tense and full of anticipation. I could not put this book down, I was completely absorbed in the lives of these characters as well as the wonderfully described surroundings.\n\nMy Rating 5/5 ~ A beautifully told and magnificently described story of loss and pain and the struggle to leave the past behind, especially when it has a way of coming back to haunt you. Someone To Watch Over Me will have you gripped from the start. This book does not mess around and throws you straight in at the deep end and you work your way through with the characters, discovering more about them and experiencing moments with them along the way. A true contender for Book of the Year and one of the most powerful debuts I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. In a word, AMAZING!\n\nRead this review on my blog.\n\nNovember 3, 2013\n\nIn 2011, The Alan Titchmarsh Show launched a competition to find a new novelist. The 1000+ entries, competing for a deal with Harper Collins, were whittled down to a final four. Jane Cable’s excellent The Cheesemaker’s House won the suspense and crime category. But the overall winner was Madeleine Reiss for Someone to Watch Over Me. The slightly odd thing – particularly after reading this excellent book – was that it won in the women’s fiction category. In a guest blog on The Serious Reader, Jane says “the genres could have been reversed – in fact maybe they should have been; my book is romance-suspense whereas Madeleine’s is definitely the other way around.” I can only agree, but at least it meant that both of these excellent books came to the attention of readers.\n\nSomeone to Watch Over Me really does defy categorisation. The basic story is about two women. Carrie and her husband take five year old Charlie to a Norfolk beach, where he plays with Max, another five year old who is there with his mother Molly. Later in the day, Charlie disappears – and he is never found. The story unfolds several years later. Carrie is opening a gift shop with her feisty but loyal friend Jen – life has moved on. Carrie is now on her own – her marriage doesn’t survive Charlie’s loss – and we see her moving on, her tentative attempts to repair her marriage and her interest in neighbour Oliver. After the shocking start, for a time the book is unashamed chick lit – the setting up of the shop in great detail, the interactions with neighbours, the banter with Jen, Jen’s forays into on-line dating, Carrie’s difficult relationship with her mother, all peppered with repeated descriptions of the clothes the characters are wearing. In alternate chapters, we have the story of Molly and Max – and when the two threads come together, it becomes quite a different book, a dark, violent, edge-of-your-seat thriller with a touch of the supernatural.\n\nSome reviewers haven’t entirely agreed, but I thought the whole book worked magnificently. I’m usually a fairly disciplined reader, but this one had me reading until 2am as there was no way I was going to put it down without knowing what happened. The style is seductive – the lighter chick lit style in parts throws the shocks into sharp relief, and makes them twice as shocking. The author writes exceptionally well – this is a book you experience with all your senses (some of the settings are cinematically vivid, complete with smells, tastes and sounds) and it’s a highly enjoyable roller coaster, easy to read in many ways but very difficult in others, that leaves you quite limp when you emerge at the other end. I loved the portrayal of the mother-son relationships – both Max and Charlie are endearingly and very realistically drawn. There are some images that will stay with me a long time – to tell you about them might spoil your discovery of the story, but I was particularly mesmerised by the part played by the songs of Ella Fitzgerald (bet you’re intrigued now, aren’t you?).\n\nThis is a book that really will appeal to all sorts of readers – chick lit readers who want something a little different, fans of authors with a mystical touch like Barbara Erskine, people who’ve enjoyed psychological thrillers by the likes of Rosamund Lupton or S J Watson. I thoroughly enjoyed every page, an immensely accomplished first novel, and can’t wait to see what Madeleine Reiss comes up with next.\n\nNovember 13, 2013\n\nI was completely gripped by this story from the start. We know early on that Carrie and Damian’s young son Charlie has vanished from a Norfolk beach – what we don’t know is why and how.\n\nThe story then goes forward by 3 years and life has slowly moved forward for both Carrie and Damian. Sadly their marriage didn’t survive Charlie’s disappearance and therefore currently single, Carrie and her old friend Jen, are preparing to open their gift shop “Trove”. Carrie is thankful to have the shop to keep her busy. She is still grieving for the loss of her son and the guilt over the events of that day still holds firm as she has never forgiven herself for briefly falling asleep that day on the beach when Charlie disappeared.\n\nRunning along Carrie’s story is a separate strand concerning Molly and her young son Max. The connection between the two women is that Molly and Max were on the beach that very same day and Charlie played with Max for a while. The only time that Carrie and Molly met was when Carrie was frantically searching the beach looking for Charlie. However the lives of the two women are about to become entwined in a deadly manner that nobody could foresee.\n\nNot only does this story deal with the devastation of the loss of a child but also with such issues as domestic abuse and violence. The story has a supernatural element and depending on your own individual beliefs, you may have to suspend belief slightly at the turn that the book takes however this does nothing to diminish the suspense and tension throughout the pages.\n\nThe characterisation is excellent. Carrie’s feelings of guilt and grief are so realistic and we see her conflicting emotions as she receives possible news of Charlie and the ensuing consequences. Her love life becomes quite complicated as she slowly allows herself to start to feel again after having shut down for so long.\n\nMolly and, in particular, her son Max were both convincing characters and my heart broke at times for Max. Molly’s desperate attempts to protect her son were almost too painful to read. Max is a lonely child and when he keeps referring to his friend Charlie, his voice is dismissed as that of a young child having an imaginary friend.\n\nI thought I knew where the story was going, especially when Jen’s new boyfriend suddenly appeared however I was proved wrong. I’m still not quite sure why he was such a big part of the story, other than to provide a love interest for Jen.\n\nThere were some parts of the book that were lighter and verging on comedy – especially the scenes with Carrie’s mother, the characters around the shop and Carrie’s musical neighbours! However the overall tone was that of a thriller and it certainly had me turning the pages.\n\nThis debut novel gets top marks from me and I would love to read more by Madeleine Reiss.\n\nJanuary 13, 2015\n\nThis is without doubt a sad story. My feeling of Charlie going missing churned around inside me. Carrie's life collapes when her five year-old son, Charlie, disappears on a Norfolk beach. As Carrie is relaxing on the beach watching Charlie play with a friend in the sand Charlie asks if he can go swimming in the sea. loveable five-year-old Charlie says to Carrie I love you every single day. And I love you every single day too said Carrie and shut her eyes relaxing on the beach. She couldn't say how long she had been asleep when Charlie's father Damian woke Carrie asking where is Charlie?. You feel the dread and fear as Carrie scans the beach in search for her little boy.\n\nMay 30, 2013\n\nFirst, a big thank you for sending me an advance copy of this book.\n\nThis book is a must read!!\n\nThe book really pulled at my heart strings, I could not imagine having to go through what the characters in the story go through, I found myself having to put the book down in between chapters to stop myself getting too emotional. The characters are well written and you can't help but feel every emotion and every twist and turn with them.\n\nAll in all a brilliantly written story. I will be recommending this book to all of my friends.\n\nJanuary 7, 2018\n\nHarika bir kurgu..Heyecan.. Bayıldım belki başlarda biraz sıkıldım ama sayfalar ilerledikçe açıldı hikaye..

Umso erfreuter war ich, als ich das Buch plötzlich in unserer Bücherei entdeckte. Ich habe den Roman bereits vor einiger Zeit gelesen, aber noch nicht rezensiert, deswegen scheint er auch noch in keiner Statistik auf. Nun wird es aber Zeit für eine Rezension....\n\nDer Roman erzählt die Geschichte zweier Frauen, die sich kurz begegnen und deren Schicksal am Ende des Buches zusammenführen wird.\n\nIn zwei Handlungssträngen wird abwechselnd aus der Sicht von Molly und von Carrie erzählt. Eines Tages verschwindet Carries Sohn Charlie spurlos, als die Familie einen gemeinsamen Nachmittag am Strand verbringt. Nur ein kurzer Moment Unachtsamkeit verändert das Leben der kleinen Familie für immer. Molly war am selben Tag mit ihrem Sohn Max am selben Strandabschnitt und die beiden Jungs spielten sogar für kurze Zeit zusammen im Sand.\n\nDrei Jahre der Ungewissheit haben Carrie's Leben und ihre Ehe zerstört. Ihr Ehemann Damien hat die Hoffnung aufgegeben und konnte nicht mehr mit Carries Verzweiflung leben. Carrie glaubt nicht, dass Charlie tot ist und greift nach jeden Strohhalm, der sich ihr bietet. Sie will einfach nicht wahrhaben, dass sie ihren Sohn nie wiedersehen wird und leidet außerdem an Schuldgefühlen. Trotzalledem versucht sie nun einen beruflichen Neustart und möchte ihr Leben wieder in den Griff bekommen. Ihre Freundin Jen und Peter, ein guter Freund, helfen ihr dabei.\n\nMolly ist eine alleinstehende Mutter und lebt in Angst und Schrecken. Anfangs ist noch unklar weswegen, doch im Laufe der Geschichte eröfnen sich hier ungeahnte Abgründe. In Rückblenden aus Mollys Vergangenheit erfährt der Leser Stück für Stück welchem Martyrium sie und ihr Sohn ausgesetzt sind.\n\nDie beiden Frauen sind mir schnell ans Herz gewachsen. Sowohl Carrie, als auch Molly haben kein einfaches Leben. Carrie hat das Verschwinden ihres Sohnes noch immer nicht verwunden und Molly erlebt einen Albtraum nach dem anderen. Mit beiden Frauen konnte ich mitfühlen. Auch ich gab die Hoffnung über viele Seite nicht auf, dass Charlie noch lebt und er gefunden wird. Und für Molly erhoffte ich ein anderes Leben ohne Furcht und Schläge.\n\nDie ganze Zeit fragt man sich als Leser wie die Geschichte der beiden Frauen zusammenhängen könnte und wer Charlie entführt hat. Die düstere Grundstimmung überwiegt im Großteil des Buches. Überflüssig fand ich allerdings die detaillierten Sexszenen. Kleine mystische Elemente sorgen wiederum für übernatürliche Komponenten.\n\nAnfangs findet man keine Gemeinsamkeiten der beiden Frauen, doch zum Ende hin verbindet das Schicksal Carrie und Molly zu Leidensgenossinnen. Der Spannungsbogen steigt etwas zu langsam an, das Finale ist dann allerdings dramatisch und gleicht einem Showdown.\n\nSchreibstil:\n\nDer Schreibstil von Madeleine Reiss ist ausdrucksstark und lässt sich wunderbar lesen. Die Kapitel werden abwechselnd aus der Sicht von Molly und Carrie erzählt und es gibt auch Rückblenden in die Vergangenheit. Die emotionalen Qualen und die Verzweiflung beider Frauen werden von Autorin sehr eindringlich und realistisch geschildert. Man hofft und bangt die ganzen 352 Seiten mit Carrie und Molly mit. Die Kapitel haben eine angenehme Länge.\n\nFazit:\n\nEin Spannungsroman mit mystischen Elementen, der von zwei unterschiedlichen Frauen berichtet, deren Schicksal alles andere als einfach ist. Eine Mischung zwischen Drama, Roman und Thriller und einem Schuss Übersinnlichem. Interessant und vielversprechendes Debüt.\n\nNovember 17, 2015\n\n►♥◄ INHALT ►♥◄\n\n„Ich hab dich lieb, jeden und jeden Tag.“\n\nUnzählige Male hat Carrie diesen Satz zu ihrem fünfjährigen Sohn Charlie gesagt, so auch an jenem Sommertag an der Küste von Norfolk, als ein langer Schatten auf ihr Leben fiel: Sie hatte nur für einen Moment die Augen geschlossen, und als sie sie wieder aufschlug, war Charlie fort. Auch drei Jahre später bestimmt dieses traumatische Ereignis noch Carries Leben, als sie zufällig die alleinerziehende Mutter Molly kennenlernt. Doch noch können die beiden Frauen nicht ahnen, dass an jenem Tag am Strand eine Verbindung entstanden ist, die ihrer beider Schicksal bestimmen wird ...\n\n►♥◄ MEINE MEINUNG ►♥◄\n\nDieses Buch habe ich vom Goldmann-Verlag als Rezensionsexemplar zur Verfügung gestellt bekommen; dafür möchte ich mich an dieser Stelle ganz herzlich bedanken. ♥ Wie ich das Buch letztlich fand, das erfahrt ihr jetzt. Vorweg möchte ich gleich einmal sagen, dass ich solche Bücher in den meisten Fällen wirklich unglaublich gern lese und ich hatte hier etwas in die Lucinda Riley - Richtung oder gar im Kate Morton Stil erwartet. Wurde ich überzeugt?\n\nDer Einstieg fiel mir schon einmal sehr leicht. Alles beginnt sehr ruhig und gemächlich; man lernt die Figuren langsam kennen und bekommt einen Einblick in die Vergangenheit unserer Hauptfigur Carrie. So durfte man das schlimme Erlebnis in aller Deutlichkeit mitbekommen und konnte die Gefühle der Protagonisten so viel intensiver und realer spüren. Ich persönlich begann sogar, den verlorenen Sohn Charlie selbst zu vermissen und konnte mir gut vor Augen führen, was Carrie mitmachen musste.\n\nCarrie selbst war eine sehr charakterstarke Persönlichkeit, die ihre Rolle als Hauptfigur perfekt verkörperte. Ihre Gefühle waren authentisch und der gesamte Charakter war unheimlich lebensecht und realistisch dargestellt. Ich konnte sie, trotz des Altersunterschied zu mir, sehr schnell ins Herz schließen und empfand ihre Handlungen und Gedankengänge stets nachvollziehbar und einleuchtend. Ich durchlebte die Geschichte wahnsinnig gern mit ihr zusammen und war teilweise auch wirklich überrascht von ihrem Mut und ihrem Kampfgeist; in erster Linie aber von ihrer inneren Stärke, die mich einfach umhaute und begeisterte. Die zweite Hauptfigur, Molly, gefiel mir dagegen nicht ganz so gut, wie ich es mir gewünscht habe. Ich schiebe diese Antipathie allerdings der Tatsache zu, dass ich, Gott sei Dank, noch nie einer solchen Situation war und deshalb oft der Meinung war, man hätte da anders handeln können. Ich empfand sie einfach als schwach und weinerlich, obwohl auch sie in gewisser Weise nie wirklich aufgab, sondern für ihren kleinen Max stark blieb. Meiner Meinung nach hätte man da einfach vielleicht ein bisschen.. energischer handeln können? Aber wie gesagt, ich sehe das nicht zwingend als Kritikpunkt an, da ich mich nie in dieser Lage befand und es, gott bewahre, hoffentlich auch so bleibt.\n\nDer Stil war wie erwartet, sehr gut. Das Buch hat sich leicht und flüssig lesen lassen, ohne großes Anecken und Andocken. Die Sprache war der Thematik sehr gut angepasst und ich konnte mir alles klar und deutlich vorstellen. Auch die Aufmachung fand ich ansprechend, denn die Sicht wechselt unregelmäßig zwischen Carrie und Molly, was dem Ganzen eine gewisse, unterschwellige Spannung verlieh.\n\nDie Grundidee empfand ich irgendwie als seltsam. Diese beiden Frauen haben irgendwie nichts gemeinsam, außer dass beide einen 5-jährigen Sohn haben. Ich verstand daher nicht 100%ig, worauf die Autorin hinaus wollte und obwohl ich das Finale (die letzten 40 Seiten) 2x gelesen habe, bin ich nach dem Beenden der Geschichte kein bisschen klüger. Ich verstand nicht, was denn nun die ominöse Verbindung war & ich frage mich, worauf die Autorin bei diesem Buch wohl hinaus wollte.\n\nDie Umsetzung war solala. Wenn man mit der einen Protagonstin nicht richtig warm wird, hat man ohnehin Schwierigkeiten, eine plausible Meinung abzugeben, was die allgemeine Umsetzung betrifft. Ich empfand, wie gesagt, den Einstieg sehr stark. Doch relativ früh verlor sich mein Interesse und die Spannung im Nichts. Der gesamte Mittelteil war ein seichtes vor sich hin plätschern, in dem man eigentlich nichts wirklich Neues erfuhr sondern lediglich von Carrie's Trauer berieselt wurde. Am Ende ging es dann nochmal richtig rund und ich empfand dann auch tatsächlich richtige Spannung. Allerdings wurde ich aus dem Ende nicht schlau, was ich oben ja bereits erwähnte. Das große Finale bescherte mir nicht die Auflösung, die ich erwartet habe; meiner Meinung nach gab es noch nicht einmal eine Auflösung, was mich einfach restlos enttäuschte. Ansonsten hatte ich dennoch irgendwo Spaß am Lesen, was ich nicht zuletzt Carrie und ihrer besten Freundin Jen, sowie dem guten Schreibstil zu verdanken habe.\n\n►♥◄ FAZIT ►♥◄\n\nDieses Buch erfüllte meine Erwartungen leider nicht. Der Klappentext sowie der Einstieg waren vielversprechend, doch die Geschichte ließ schnell nach und ich empfand beinahe Langeweile. Erst gegen Ende hin, war ich wieder gefangen und nachdem das große Finale verklungen war, blieb ich ratlos zurück. Alles in allem war es kein totaler Flop, aber lange auch kein Highlight, wie ich erhofft hatte. Wer sich einen simplen Roman wünscht, der eher auf Gefühle, statt auf richtige Spannung setzt, der wird \"Ich lass dich nicht los\" sicherlich mögen. Mir persönlich war es zu langsam und die Gefühle kamen bei mir einfach nicht so an, wie erhofft.\n\n►♥◄ 3 VON 5 STERNEN ►♥◄\n\nIch habe mich für die goldene Mitte entschieden, denn es gab sowohl positive Aspekte als auch negative Punkte, die mir auffielen. Ich hatte dennoch Spaß am Lesen und kann dieses Buch vor allem Lesern empfehlen, die lieber seichte Kost verschlingen und dabei auf Gefühl statt Spannung setzen.\n\nFebruary 15, 2017\n\nSometimes these back and forth chapters of different characters don't work as it just leaves me confused. In the end it does come together and fits into decent story.\n\nApril 26, 2021\n\nThis was a reasonably enjoyable read, although my interest did seem to fall in places throughout the story.\n\nJuly 29, 2022\n\nNot my kind of story at all. I thought it is a story about a woman who lost her child and how such a thing will change everything and at the beginning it did seem like this kind of story. But too much space is given to endless descriptions of whatever whoever is wearing and what someone else thinks about it, endless descriptions of interior design and how things are ranged and rearranged endlessly in a shop...\n\nAlso how stupid can you be when you know two people are kept by a madman and still you enter the place that has just been unlocked from the inside??? Someone with half a brain would know it must be the bad guy unlocking it.\n\nHowever, there were some interesting bits, esp. at the beginning, hence 2 stars.\n\nJuly 2, 2013\n\nSomeone To Watch Over Me focuses on two different mothers and their lives with their families, and more importantly, their sons. The two women, Carrie and Molly don’t know each other, the only link they have is that they both spent a day on the same Norfolk beach, where Carrie’s son disappeared. Both women are facing their darkest fears…Carrie spends her time desperately trying to find out what happened, whilst Molly is desperate to protect her son Max from his father, who is both violent and unstable. Now Carrie and Molly’s lives are about to collide…\n\nWords cannot describe how incredibly blown away I was by this book. When I first started the novel I had no idea just how gripped I would be, I was drawn in from the first chapter and I didn’t want to be parted from the pages. I finished reading a few days ago and I have not been able to think of anything else since.\n\nSomeone To Watch Over Me is such a powerful book, it genuinely moved me so much. I became very emotionally involved in everything about this novel, I poured myself into the book as I read, and I desperately wanted to read on to find out what would happen.\n\nThe characters were perfectly written, I cannot fault a single thing about them. I loved that Carrie and Molly are strong women. Although they are going through their own struggles and are both having a terrible time in their lives, I loved how they were brave, for themselves and for their children too. They were courageous and determined and I truly got behind both of them, and I was willing them on throughout the story as they both faced their fears.\n\nSomeone To Watch Over Me is a very emotional rollercoaster of a book that will have you hooked. This novel covers a variety of serious and sometimes heart-breaking subjects, including loss, fear and abuse. But there are also many positives to take from this book, such as family, hope, spirits and the importance of love and friendship. this is a book that will stay with me and I can not wait for Madeleine’s next release.\n\nMarch 23, 2014\n\nWhat a fantastic book. Hearing an extract read at the book launch made me want to go and read it immediately! 3very late nights later I finished it. The story line is gentle in parts but gripping in others and you don't want to pt it down. The book contains everything in the right amount - friendship, trauma, daily trials and tribulations, humour, and relationships. The language used is fabulous and I can't wait to read the next one!\n\nJuly 10, 2013\n\nI was completely gripped throughout this book, and just had to know what was coming next... A thrilling, heart-breaking and thought-provoking novel. It took me on a roller coaster of emotions and held me captivated by the two quite different story lines, running parallel to one another until they eventually collide in the dramatic final chapters. A book of love, loss, fear, grief, humour, friendship... Highly recommended!\n\nMarch 2, 2015\n\nThis books characters are so well written you really feel for them. I found myself unable to put it down once started. I loved the descriptions of the shop and its contents, I really wanted to visit it. Be careful though some chapters are very upsetting. A wonderful book.\n\nAugust 23, 2013\n\nAbsolute rubbish- I hated it, predictable, poorly written and unrealistic drivel!!\n\nSeptember 1, 2014\n\nA great read, an emotional story with a difficult subject, read the full review here. http://readinginecuador.wordpress.com...\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\n\nI really enjoyed this on the whole with one or two caveats.\n\nCarrie was very well drawn, I could believe in her, but I became very irritated by being given a run down of her wardrobe every time she changed. What she was wearing had no bearing at all on the development of her character. It was unnecessary and had the effect of stopping the flow of the narrative.\n\nThe author didn’t find it necessary to describe Molly in such trivial fashion, so why Carrie ? It just made her seem rather shallow.\n\nJen's romantic story added absolutely nothing to the narrative. I didn't mind the character but she didn’t need her own storyline.\n\nIrrelevancies dragged this novel from a taut suspenseful read into the realms of fluffy chick lit and the two didn't sit happily together.\n\nI enjoyed it, but did find myself skipping over a lot of the unnecessary stuff. Without this it would have been four stars for sure.\n\nJanuary 21, 2019\n\nAfter some confusion as to where this story was going, I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nCarrie was enjoying her day at the beach with her family when the unthinkable happens. Her son, Charlie, is missing. It only took a split second, and he was gone.\n\nMolly and her husband have been having issues with their relationship. She’s afraid her young son, Max, was feeling the brunt of it. Especially since he’s been speaking to his imaginary friend a lot more lately.\n\nSeptember 23, 2017\n\nIf you are not someone who freaks out because a book has a religious theme, you'll like this book. The people are likable and believable and although parts of the story will probably make you cry, it was a really enjoyable read.\n\nMay 7, 2018\n\nI didn’t like the way the chapters skipped back and forth from character to character without any seeming tie. The end was dull and not what I expected. There was no real suspense or climax and I found a lot of the storyline to be irrelevant and unnecessary. To dull for me liking"
