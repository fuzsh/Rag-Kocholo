        "text": "To earn your Eagle-required Citizenship in The Community merit badge, you’ll need to watch a movie that demonstrates the positive effects citizens can have on their communities. However, some Scouts can have a difficult time finding new and interesting movies to watch.\n\nThat’s why, in this article, I’ll be listing 17 of the best citizenship-teaching movies that you can watch to complete this badge. Before choosing a movie to watch, take the time to read requirement 5 of the Citizenship in the Community merit badge:\n\nRequirement 5: With the approval of your counselor and a parent, watch a movie that shows how the actions of one individual or group of individuals can have a positive effect on a community. Discuss with your counselor what you learned from the movie about what it means to be a valuable and concerned member of the community.\n\nAll of the movies listed are entertaining, age-appropriate, and satisfy the merit badge requirements. Younger Scouts will probably enjoy the newer animated films most, while older Scouts may prefer sports movies. Whatever you choose, just don’t forget to be watching out for how the main characters have a positive effect on their communities!\n\nPersonally, I’d really recommend checking out the movie, Follow Me, Boys! (Link is to the movie on Amazon) as it’s the ultimate Scouting movie that does a great job of demonstrating Scout spirit. Truly, every Scout should watch it at least once!\n\nIf you plan to watch the movie with your family, you can search it up at Commonsensemedia.org beforehand, to see an overview of the film’s content and reviews. That way, you can choose to watch something your whole family will love!\n\nAfter finishing your chosen movie, take five minutes to write out a short summary. Include details about the movie’s protagonist, their message, as well as the sacrifices they made to serve their community. You’ll be discussing these points with your merit badge counselor later on."
