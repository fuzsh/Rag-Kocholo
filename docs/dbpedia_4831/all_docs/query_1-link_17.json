        "text": "Although Ella Fitzgerald's lush rendition of \"Someone to Watch Over Me\" is piped in after every scene, the new West End import at the Booth is not an adjunct to \"Crazy for You\" at the Shubert next door. \"Someone Who'll Watch Over Me,\" as the Irish writer Frank McGuinness titles his play, is set in a filthy Beirut basement serving as a windowless cell for three hostages. And it features one choreographic gimmick that not even its resourceful musical neighbor came up with: Mr. McGuinness's characters each have a leg shackled to the wall.\n\nI don't mean to sound flip about the evening's subject, but \"Someone Who'll Watch Over Me\" brings its own light touch to grim matters. Mr. McGuinness's view of the hostages' plight is more Beckett than Costa-Gavras. His unpretentious play offers no bombastic speeches about man's inhumanity to man, no onstage violence and no debates about Middle Eastern politics. Instead of exploiting a real-life tragedy to bring a spurious journalistic reality to the stage, Mr. McGuinness uses his premise as a springboard for imagining the fantasies, jokes and spiritual credos with which ordinary men might somehow survive barbaric incarceration.\n\nThe goal is worthy but difficult. Not even Beckett always succeeded in keeping plays about boredom from being boring. And Mr. McGuinness, if a charming writer in spurts, is no Beckett. Too much of \"Someone Who'll Watch Over Me\" has the artificial tone of an acting class exercise, as if its cast were doing contrived improvisations designed to show off their skills rather than to reveal characters of real depth. Since those characters are schematically and sometimes stereotypically drawn -- each has a pointedly different nationality, marital status, profession, etc. -- the play is sporadically amusing without being riveting, moving or particularly credible.\n\nThe actors are first rate. If an evening of theater games it is to be, who better to play them than Stephen Rea and Alec McCowen? (James McDaniel, as the American among the hostages, has the briefest and least persuasive part.) Mr. Rea, who may be best known to New York audiences for his appearances in films by Mike Leigh (\"Life is Sweet\") and Neil Jordan (\"The Crying Game\"), is a wiry, vinegary presence as a sardonic young Irish journalist. Mr. McCowen contributes his specialty, prim mellifluous grace, in the role of a prissy British professor of Middle English. Together the long-faced Mr. Rea, all nerve ends, and the old-maidish Mr. McCowen, a pudding of repression, refight both the cultural and political conflicts of Ireland and England to a respectful standoff. As they do so, they form a comedy team that now and then suggests Laurel and Hardy or Oscar and Felix, if not Didi and Gogo."
