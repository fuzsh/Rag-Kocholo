Her only means of defense: a new app called \"See For Me.\" It connects her to a volunteer across the country who helps her survive by seeing on her behalf. Sophie is connected to Kelly, an army veteran who spends her days playing first person shooter games. Sophie is forced to learn that if she's going to survive the night, she'll need all the help she can get. A blind teenage girl who ends up being not so powerless after all.",
