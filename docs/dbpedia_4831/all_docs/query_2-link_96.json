        "text": "Mamma Mia!\n\nWhat marks Mamma Mia! out is the fact that it’s so interactive. People of all ages regularly sing along to the tunes of Abba, which can help make connections with people with dementia. Other similar recommendations include The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady and South Pacific.\n\nLaurel and Hardy\n\nMany people diagnosed with dementia grew up with the slapstick routines of Laurel and Hardy allowing many to reminisce. Their comedic routines can bring enjoyment and distraction. Films like this are also great to share with the wider family. They can even help to provide invaluable connection between children and grandparents with dementia. Another recommendation is Mr Bean.\n\nTop Gun\n\nThis may be a suitable choice for younger people diagnosed with dementia. Top Gun’s straightforward plotline can help to hold the attention of the person with dementia. Other similar recommendations for younger people with dementia include Ghost and Pretty Woman.\n\nWhat sort of films are appealing to people with dementia?\n\nDr. Hilda Hayo, CEO and Chief Admiral Nurse at Dementia UK, said: “No experience of dementia is the same and families are always best placed to know which films or other activities would appeal to their family member with dementia.\n\n“However there are certain film genres or styles which can be appealing to someone with dementia. This can include films which do not have complex story lines and films where there is a strong action, comedic or musical element.\n\n“We are seeing more and more screenings of films to cater for people with dementia and their families. Some of our very own specialist dementia Admiral Nurses have been involved in bringing these screenings to local communities for example. They undoubtedly help to elevate mood in a person with dementia, helping them stay engaged and connected to their families and wider society.”"
