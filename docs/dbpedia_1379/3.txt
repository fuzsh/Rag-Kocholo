Atletico Madrid have confirmed the signing of utility player Daniel Wass from fellow LaLiga side Valencia on an 18-month contract.

The Denmark international, who was due to become a free agent at the end of the season, is reported to have cost Atletico 2.7 million euros (3 million dollars) plus add-ons.

Diego Simeone's side confirmed the transfer on their official website on Thursday, making the Brondby youth product their first signing of the January window.

Wass is comfortable playing in a number of positions, including at right-back, where Atleti have been looking to recruit following Kieran Trippier's move to Newcastle United.

After three years at Celta Vigo, Wass made the switch to Valencia in July 2018 and featured 152 times â€“ at least 12 times more than any other player for the club over that time.
