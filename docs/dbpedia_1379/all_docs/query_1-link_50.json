        "text": "With a few exceptions, most MLB teams are either buyers or sellers at the trade deadline. Rarely will you hear a front office executive describe themselves as “sellers,” though. They have to couch it in other verbiage that sounds less gloomy.\n\nJed Hoyer, president of baseball operations for the Chicago Cubs, spoke publicly about the team’s deadline strategy yesterday. \"Where we are right now, I would have to say that moves only for 2024, unless things change over the next week, we probably won't do a lot of moves that only help us for this year. If moves help us for 2025 and beyond I think we're exceptionally well positioned.\"\n\nIn other words, the Cubs expect to sell, albeit with the caveat that a great week of baseball could change their plans. They’re 49-53, sitting 3.5 games behind the New York Mets for the last wild card spot, but with three teams in between them. They aren’t in an insurmountable position, but since more franchises looking to buy than to sell, they could take advantage of a favorable market.\n\nHowever, not all sellers are the same. His comments indicate he believes the club could be competitive next season, so they’re less likely to shed long-term assets or trade for low-minors prospects who are a long way from bolstering the major-league roster.\n\nThe most likely players to depart Wrigleyville are those having strong seasons on expiring contracts, but there aren’t too many of them on their roster. The only players scheduled to become free agents at the end of the season are starter Kyle Hendricks and reliever Jorge López.\n\nHendricks gave up two home runs and three runs in five innings in his last start which actually improved his ERA to 6.69—the lowest it has been all season. Besides, he has 10-5 rights, which means a veteran player who has ten years of experience and five years with one team has a full no-trade clause. López was just signed in June after the Mets released him.\n\nFour more players have options that could grant them free agency after this season if declined. The biggest name—and salary—in that group is Cody Bellinger’s. The star outfielder is earning $27.5 million in 2024 and has a player option for the same salary next season with a $2.5 million buyout. He’s batting .269/.331/.410, but his 107 OPS+ is a far cry from last year’s 136 mark, and he’s on the injured list for the time being with a fractured left middle finger. That poorly-timed injury and his lucrative contract could make suitors shy away in trade talks.\n\nLefty reliever Drew Smyly is also on a contract that pays him more than his present value, if on a lesser scale than Bellinger’s. He has an $8.5 million salary this year and a $10 million mutual option for 2025 with a $2.5 million buyout that the Cubs—or whoever he ends up with—will decline. The 35-year-old has a 2.79 ERA over 27 games and 38 2/3 innings, but his 1.27 WHIP and meager 33 strikeouts don’t support his top-line numbers.\n\nInfielder David Bote and reliever Héctor Neris, have club options that almost certainly won’t get picked up. Bote was demoted in the middle of an extension, though he has hit well in a small sample since getting recalled. They’ll take his $1 million buyout instead of picking up his $7 million option.\n\nNeris’ option is more interesting, but only because he has pitched poorly, allowing 6.2 walks per nine innings and a 1.53 WHIP. His $9 million club option becomes a player option if he has 60 appearances or 45 games finished this year and doesn’t end the season on the injured list. Right now, he has 37 appearances and 25 games finished.\n\nThe bottom line is that those six players don’t hold a lot of appeal as we approach the trade deadline. Some of them will be worthwhile additions to contending teams, but the Cubs would have to eat some of their salaries to make it work. Others have little to no value.\n\nOf course, players with multiple years of team control aren’t completely off the table in trade talks. Starting pitcher Jameson Taillon has two more years and $40 million remaining on his contract after 2024, but as a 32-year-old with a 3.10 ERA despite a low strikeout rate, his value might never be higher. Reliever Mark Leiter Jr. and outfielder Mike Tauchman are both enjoying solid seasons, are 33 years old, and earn less than $2 million in salary with two years of arbitration eligibility remaining.\n\nThird baseman and designated hitter Christopher Morel is often mentioned in trade speculation, and moving him could clear the runway for top prospect Matt Shaw. Reliever Tyson Miller has a 1.52 ERA in 22 games since the Cubs traded for him in May from the Seattle Mariners. However, both players are still in their pre-arbitration years and are under team control through at least 2028. Trading them would run contrary to Hoyer’s comment about building for 2025.\n\nIn light of their anticipated competitive window opening next season, there aren’t many tradeable players who fit their deadline modus operandi. That could portend a quiet deadline in the north side of Chicago. Than again, baseball executives aren’t always forthright either, so maybe not."
