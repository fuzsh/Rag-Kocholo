BrÃ¸ndby - Legia Warszawa Fodbold\n\nAnd, with referee Matt Donohue playing a good advantage after a tackle on skipper Tom Lawrence, it was the Pole's clever pass that unlocked Stoke's usually solid defence for the opener. Borussia Dortmund manager Marco Rose: Almost every day he is confronted with some outrageous speculation, and the way Erling handles it as a young player is extraordinary, I think. Such a record is used to justify the popular view of Traore that despite his awesome pace, those greased muscles and the low centre of gravity, it counts for little without end product. Junior Messias' header three minutes from time downed Atletico Madrid and kept AC Milan's hopes of qualification from Champions League Group B alive. Going forward I always try to look for Harry Kane but when there is a goalscorer like him he can be marked by one or two defenders. We are just not stopping giving them information. When it's noisy, like I have just said to them in there, you need to pick yourself up. BrÃ¸ndby-chef afviser: Jeg har ikke snakket med ham BrÃ¸ndby-cheftrÃ¦ner Jesper SÃ¸rensen fÃ¸ler sig godt forberedt pÃ¥ Legia Warszawa i torsdagens opgÃ¸r i Conference League, men han har ikkeÂ ... 62' GOAL FOR LENS! Wow, a good effort 30 yards out from Fofana but Navas had it covered only to allow it to slip under his body after getting two hands on it. Wass: Det er nu, vi skal vise hvem BrÃ¸ndby IF er Daniel Wass er er klar til at gÃ¥ ud pÃ¥ banen i morgen pÃ¥ BrÃ¸ndby Stadion og vise klubben frem pÃ¥ den europÃ¦iske scene mod det polske mandsskab. What the managers said...Peterborough's Darren Ferguson: It was important to get something out of the game. I want the players to create self belief... But the season changes, we have injuries and tonight, we had a makeshift backline. But the hosts recovered and Aaron Drinan levelled late on before Ruel Sotiriou's missed effort from 12 yards in the shootout saw the hosts exit the competition. Dean Smith is the first manager to take charge of successive Premier League matches against the same opponent I've been here for seven years and I never disrespected and I never will disrespect the club and the fans.

I've taken a step back and just tried to focus on my club football.

Raheem Sterling came into these Euros with questions over his form after an in-and-out season at Manchester City and some critics calling for new, younger wide options to take his place. Fiorentina want to sell the 21-year-old Serbia international this month to maximise their profit, as he has just 18 months remaining on his contract. Gio is someone that Ronald always spoke highly of and he is someone that I keep in regular contact with, someone whose opinions I trust wholeheartedly, said Wilson. BrÃ¸ndby hÃ¥ber pÃ¥ 'lukket kamp' Vi skal undgÃ¥ at fÃ¥ en kamp, hvor spillet bÃ¸lger frem og tilbage, siger Jesper SÃ¸rensen forud for mÃ¸det med Legia Warszawa torsdag. If they can process data more quickly, they can make quicker decisions. That's why we were able to keep players going. You've got two ball-playing midfielders in there who can play off each other. Everyone is important but it's good to see Billy on the pitch.

Referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot for a handball by Cristian Romero after a VAR review and it seemed Mahrez had salvaged a point. They could have snatched all three points in the final minute of normal time, but Jorginho's effort from the spot flew high over the bar as the game ended in a draw. Now, initially on loan from Wolves, he is home. Back after six-and-a-half years in England, opinion is still divided. That's partly down to the quality he showed on the pitch following his introduction, but also his character. Rafa needs time to have his mark on the squad. He will be supported to add depth to the squad. Managers need time. I have no doubt that we will have a strong second-half to the season. Coufal continued: We need to be ready for everything. We need to be careful of their counter-attacks and set-pieces. The first of them to leave home was the eldest son, Junior, who impressed Uruguayan powerhouse Penarol and packed his things to the capital Montevideo after former international Jose Perdomo came for him. We lost the game and lost two big players and now we're not going to have them so we can't cry. We have to keep looking for solutions.

Rovers boss Tony Mowbray admitted his interest in signing him on Thursday, stating: He's a young boy, we are aware of him, I'm not sure how close anything is. I am just asking people to be calm and rational about it, and I hope we can present a joint proposal on December 20. We had seven different goalscorers so we've really learnt in these last two camps. We've played really good football and put in good performance and scored loads of goals. âSome people are coming [back to training], some people are positive again,â he said in his pre-match press conference. âWhen you test twice negative you come back, otherwise you stay at home isolating, which happens at all the [Premier League] clubs in the last three months. What the managers said...Middlesbrough's Chris Wilder: First and foremost I'd like to thank the supporters. Carlo Ancelotti (Real Madrid) Italian Ancelotti, 62, is by far the most-experienced manager on this list. Today wasn't his day but he'll have a day in him - that's for sure. Smith: It wasn't a great gameNorwich boss Dean Smith: When we finally put some passing moves together and showed what we could do, unfortunately on the back of two goals for his country, Milot [Rashica] puts it over the crossbar. It wasn't a great game, I didn't think. We conceded two sloppy goals and that's not good enough, I can't accept that performance first half. As a youngster, Hampton said, she had multiple operations to try correct her eyes but that they have never been fully repaired. Ratcliffe - majority shareholder of chemical group Ineos - pledged to invest Â£1.75bn into the club over 10 years as part of his submission. However, the knock suffered by Pellegri will come as a blow. The forward - on loan from Monaco - has been starved of action this season and now potentially faces a spell on the sidelines with what appears to be a groin injury. He may only be 20 but his career has already been disrupted by a number of injuries. With Olivier Giroud and Ante Rebic unavailable, it may also leave Milan short in numbers in attack. Coventry, though, only tested Middlesbrough goalkeeper Joe Lumley once in the opening period when he was needed to turn away Callum O'Hare's first time effort with the break approaching."
