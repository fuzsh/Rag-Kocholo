Including this match, six of Livingston's seven top-flight Boxing Day fixtures have been away from home, including each of their last five. But Jorginho had a chance to redeem himself as Aaron Wan-Bissaka kicked the back of Thiago Silva's leg in the box, allowing the Italian to score from the spot for 1-1 (69). It's contagious and there is a big infection. Those cases followed two similar results on Tuesday after the initial outbreak. It took the visitors just two minutes to open the scoring with Felix driving to the edge of the opposition box to finish calmly as Atletico Madrid looked to take an early grip of the contest. In the end, some schoolboy errors, and a noticeable dip in quality once Postecoglou brought off some of his tiring heroes, proved costly in the end. Final confirmation of the deal proved to be a fairly protracted affair. Baraclough's current contract expired at the end of the World Cup qualifiers.
