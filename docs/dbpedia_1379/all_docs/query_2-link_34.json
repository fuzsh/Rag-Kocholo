        "text": "Evian winger Daniel Wass is a reported target for Newcastle United, but the Denmark international’s agent appears to be angling for a move to Paris Saint-Germain for his client.\n\nNewcastle United are one of a handful of clubs tracking Evian winger Daniel Wass, according to reports in Denmark.\n\nWass, 25, has been in excellent form for the Ligue 1 club so far this season, scoring 10 goals in 19 total appearances thanks, in most part, to his stunning free-kick prowess.\n\nA versatile midfielder, who is just as comfortable at right-back, both Chelsea and Liverpool have been named as potential suitors for the Denmark international in recent months, but national newspaper BT claims that Newcastle, Inter Milan and Schalke are in fact the clubs in the running for his signature.\n\nHowever, with reports in France also suggesting that Paris Saint-Germain are keen, agent Michael Johansen has admitted that a switch to the capital would be a dream move for his client.\n\n“There is no contact between us and PSG,” he told French football site 90min.com. “But it would be a perfect club.”\n\nJohansen has stated in the past that he doesn’t expect Wass to leave Evian until the summer, but has now suggested that the 11-times capped international could move as soon as this month if a big offer comes in.\n\n“Yes, if the club gets the right price, then he goes,” he added. “But the price is hard to determine. €45 million maybe.\n\nMORE NEWCASTLE UNITED STORIES\n\n“Either way, he leaves the club by the summer. He needs a bigger challenge.”\n\nThat price tag would seem far too steep for Newcastle at this point, but it’s more than possible that Johansen is just attempting to drive his client’s price up during the transfer window.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Wass was reported to be a potential target for then-Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho back in the summer of 2012 following a successful season-long loan at Evian from Benfica, suggesting that perhaps there is some truth to the Chelsea links."
