        "text": "fotopress/Getty Images\n\nGareth Bale has received a 90-rated striker card in FIFA 18 after his brace against Celta Vigo on Sunday, while Ciro Immobile's four-goal haul against SPAL has seen him included in Team of the Week 17.\n\nBale is among six players representing La Liga in the lineup, while Immobile is one of four from Serie A.\n\nEA Sports released the batch of upgrades on Wednesday:\n\nHere is the Team of the Week in full:\n\nStarting XI\n\nPosition: GK.

Luvuyo Memela, Orlando Pirates, South Africa. New Rating: 74\n\nRyan Sessegnon, Fulham\n\nSessegnon played a key role in Fulham's 4-1 win over Ipswich Town on January 2. He netted a brace and grabbed an assist as the Cottagers scored all of their goals in a sensational seven-minute spell.\n\nFootball writer Jack Grimse shared the other numbers behind his impressive outing:\n\nTOTW 17 marks Sessegnon's second upgrade after his appearance in TOTW 11, with the teenager returning to the left-back position and enjoying a rating increase to 81 overall.\n\nThe Fulham star's pace already made him a strong candidate for selection despite his overall rating, and with his technical stats boosted on his latest card, he has become an even bigger threat.\n\nCiro Immobile, Lazio\n\nMarco Rosi/Getty Images\n\nA place in TOTW 17 was inevitable for Immobile after his stunning performance in Lazio's 5-2 win over SPAL on Saturday.\n\nThe striker opened his account with a lovely chip over Alfred Gomis, and he had his second shortly after with a clinical finish while one-on-one.\n\nImmobile added another goal either side of half-time to take his tally for the season to 20 goals in Serie A, making him the first player in Europe's top five leagues to reach that figure this year.\n\nBeIN Sports' Matteo Bonetti and GianlucaDiMarzio.com's David Amoyal put his achievement into context:\n\nThe Italian has enjoyed a rating increase to 86 for his troubles, making him a superb option up top for any teams with a Serie A theme.\n\nGareth Bale, Real Madrid\n\nBale's inclusion follows his brace against Celta, which came after Daniel Wass—who also features in TOTW 17—lobbed Keylor Navas.\n\nTwo clinical finishes in quick succession from Bale turned things around for Real in just his second start since September:\n\nFootball writer Ryan Baldi sung his praises:\n\nThe Welshman has deservedly been upgraded to place him in the elite 90-rated bracket, but perhaps the most notable change is his position."
