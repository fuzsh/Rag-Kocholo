        "text": "Update: Atlético have confirmed Wass’s return to Brøndby. Multiple reports Friday morning say Wass asked to leave Atleti some time ago, and the club worked with the player to sort out his next destination.\n\nAtlético Madrid have found a buyer for Daniel Wass, just days before the new LaLiga season begins.\n\nThe Danish midfielder/full-back will move back to Brøndby, according to reporters Fabrizio Romano and Farzam Abolhosseini. Wass is already in Denmark and Atlético have given the thumbs-up to the proposed move.\n\nWass signed for Atlético via Valencia last January. He came on against FC Barcelona in the second half for his debut, injured his knee and never played another minute for Diego Simeone. The 33-year-old has played during preseason, scoring in the third friendly against Cádiz, but he remained firmly out of Cholo’s plans.\n\nNahuel Molina was brought in from Udinese this summer to play right-back, and the Argentine will be first-choice this season. Saúl Ñíguez has returned from Chelsea and he can play in the positions Wass can. The Spanish midfielder has played at right-back under Simeone, and Marcos Llorente can deputize at the position too.\n\nThat left Wass firmly on the outside looking in, just six months after joining the team."
