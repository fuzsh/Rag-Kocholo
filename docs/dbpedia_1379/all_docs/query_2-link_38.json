        "text": "Daniel Wass is the latest player linked with a summer move to Newcastle United.\n\nWith United needing to make wholesale changes, Wass ticks many of the usual boxes for players the club are often linked with….and occasionally buy.\n\nPlaying for a minor French club in Evian and turning 26 next month, Daniel Wass has only a year left on his contract and would cost no more than £2m according to The Mirror.\n\nA Danish international, the player can play right midfield and right-back. ticking more boxes with his versatility.\n\nEvian have had a poor season and are third bottom of Ligue 1, though Daniel Wass has been arguably their star player.\n\nScoring 9 league goals last season, Wass has scored another 8 this season and is actually top scorer despite not playing up front.\n\nAlso contributing 5 assists this season, it looks certain the player will be keen to leave and the club cash in before losing him for nothing, however Southampton are also reported to be interested with Nathaniel Clyne looking likely to leave the Saints this summer."
