        "text": "Daniel Wass is very close to becoming an Atletico Madrid player, as Los Colchoneros have reached an agreement with Valencia to sign the Denmark international.\n\nAtleti will pay a fee of 2.7 million euros plus add-ons for the 32-year-old, who is into the last six months of his contract with Los Che, after having an initial bid of two million euros turned down earlier in the transfer window.\n\nImpact of Atletico vs Valencia\n\nWass has done his bit to try and engineer a move to Atleti, even telling Valencia boss Jose Bordalas that he did not want to play against Los Rojiblancos last weekend.\n\nIn fact, it was during the match between the two teams at the Estadio Wanda Metropolitano that Atleti sporting director Andrea Berta told Valencia president Anil Murthy that it does not make sense to drag out this signing, with Wass no longer wanting to play for the club and with his contract coming to an end.\n\nHowever, Murthy had experience of a similar situation with Wass last summer after he tried to pressure Valencia into accepting an offer of less than million euros to let him join Marseille.\n\nNow, though, Atleti have made a bid that Valencia deem acceptable for Wass, who will likely play as a right wing-back under Diego Simeone.\n\nThe departure of Kieran Trippier has left Sime Vrsaljko as Los Rojiblancos' only option at right-back, and while Marcos Llorente has also filled in there, he prefers to be in the middle of the park.\n\nTherefore, Wass' arrival and his experience of playing in this role means that Simeone will have another option to choose from."
