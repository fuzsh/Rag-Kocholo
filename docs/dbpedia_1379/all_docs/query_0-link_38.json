Many great clubs are after him, I am proud to have been training him for four years\".\n\nWass recently addressed the transfer speculation, insisting he is focusing on his football for the Ligue 1 outfit.\n\nHe said: \"My head is not in the transfer market. There is still plenty of time before the transfer window opens. I try to play well for the team, to score goals, to help win matches and that's it.\"\n\nWass, who can play at full-back and on the wing, has scored 13 times in 74 league appearances for Evian."
