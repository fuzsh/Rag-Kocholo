        "text": "Plymouth Argyle are working to finalise the transfer of 22-year-old defender Kornel Szucs from Hungarian top flight club Kecskemeti, Wayne Rooney has told Plymouth Live.\n\nThe news comes a day after centre-back Dan Scarr left the Pilgrims to sign for newly-promoted League One outfit Wrexham for an undisclosed fee, with official confirmation of the arrival of Szucs at Home Park expected in the coming days. Szucs, a Hungarian youth international, played 28 games for Kecskemeti in NB1, the top division in his homeland, last season as they finished sixth out of 12 teams.\n\nIt was first reported by Nemzeti Sport in Hungary on Saturday that Argyle had agreed to sign the versatile 22-year-old defender, and Rooney was asked about that after the Pilgrims' 1-0 pre-season win away to MK Dons.\n\nRead More: Get your copy of our Argyle 2024/25 Kick Off special now\n\nRead More: MK Dons 0 Argyle 1 Recap: Greens win final pre-season game\n\nRooney said: \"It is accurate. There is obviously a few details to get over the line. We are hoping over the next 48 hours that is done. I think for both us and his current club everything is agreed and it's just a matter of a medical and things like that.\n\n\"He's a very good player. He can play in different positions - at right-back, right wing-back and also as a centre-back - so it gives us good options.\n\n\"I think it's really important now that you have players who can play in different positions. It's a tough league and players get injuries as well. He's very good on the ball and athletic. There is still things to improve on of course, but I think he's not just a player for this season but also a player for the future.\"\n\nRooney added: \"We have done our work in watching him and analysing his game, and I think he fits us really well but as I said, nothing is done yet. It's for us to now try to get that over the line and when that happens then of course I can speak a bit more.\"\n\nArgyle had considerable success signing Hungarian players during their time in the Championship between 2004 and 2010 with Akos Buzsaky, Peter Halmosi and Krisztian Timar all becoming fans' favourites. Now Szucs is going to follow in their footsteps."
