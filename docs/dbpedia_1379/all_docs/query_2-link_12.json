        "text": "At age 21, with a wife and a 3-month-old child, Daniel Wass faced the biggest challenge of his then-fledgling soccer career.\n\nHe had been sold by Brøndby, a club in his homeland of Denmark, to the Portuguese team Benfica. From there, he was almost immediately loaned to a French club, Evian. The young family left their home in Denmark and moved first to one new country where they didn’t speak the language or know anyone and then to another.\n\n\"I moved abroad at a really young age. You don't have your parents close by; you don't have your friends close by,\" Wass, who now plays for LaLiga club Valencia CF and the Denmark national team, tells me in an interview. \"I think the first year when you go abroad, it's the toughest year.\"\n\nWass was \"really lucky\" to find he was not the only Dane at Evian. The experienced midfielder Christian Poulsen, who was capped 92 times by Denmark and had played for clubs including Schalke 04, Juventus and Liverpool, joined at the same time. He took Wass and his family under his wing.\n\n\"I almost lived at his house, even with my wife and my kid; every day we would go to eat at his place,\" Wass says. \"Christian was older and had tried a lot in his career. I asked him for advice. He gave me so much knowledge of his life; his wife gave so much knowledge to my wife.\n\n\"I think that year helped me so much to become what I am today because he gave me so much knowledge and he helped me so much. I didn't feel alone at any point because I knew I had Christian.\"\n\nNow 31 and in his tenth year playing outside Denmark, Wass wants to help young players who find themselves in the same situation he did.\n\nHe is an investor in InchByInch, a digital platform aiming to make \"talent development accessible to every youth player.\" The app will match professional athletes with those seeking advice. It could be everyone from a young amateur player looking for feedback to improve their game to a professional seeking guidance from an older peer on what to do after retiring from playing.\n\nWass is one of the athletes signed up to the app, as are players from Europe's big five soccer leagues and other top sportspeople including Olympic gold medal winners.\n\nVideo calls can be arranged in the app between aspiring pros and established athletes to discuss topics like injury recovery, nutrition, mental health or to the difficult journey from amateur to professional.\n\nWass knows the right advice from someone who has experienced what you're facing can be invaluable.\n\n\"To stay on the right path you need advice. A lot of young players go to their parents for advice but with this platform you can ask someone who has tried it all already and I think that's really helpful,\" he says.\n\n\"If one guy plays central midfield and he wants to talk to me, I can give him so much advice on what you have to do, how you have to train, how you have to eat, how you have to live your life. If you have to sign your first contract you can call a footballer and say 'what should I do here?' When you retire, maybe you want to be a coach. You can call a coach on the platform and say 'what do I have to do?'\n\n\"In football it is really, really difficult to become professional. But if you can get the right advice, it helps you a lot. I think this platform can help a lot of people to reach their dreams.\"\n\nFounded by former professional soccer player Anders Randrup, who played with Wass at Brøndby, and entrepreneurs Rasmus Bruun and Daniel Laursen, InchByInch will work on a freemium model. The premium tier, which will include a \"digital training room\" where youth players can upload videos of themselves playing and record stats, will cost 89 Danish Krone ($14) a month.\n\nThe professional athletes on the platform will have an individual price for the cost of a one-on-one video call of 20 to 30 minutes. InchByInch takes a \"small cut\" of the fee and distributes the remainder to the athlete's chosen cause, for example a charity of their childhood club, or to the athlete themself.\n\n“We are looking to add value to the whole ecosystem by making professionals reflect on their career and providing them with a possibility to pay it forward. With our model we can make a positive difference for talents as well as professionals, clubs and charity organizations,” Bruun, a managing partner in the business, said.\n\nThe company plans to launch initially in Scandinavia next summer, with plans to expand to other markets, including Germany and England.\n\n\"I signed my first contract when I was 15 or 16. I'm 31 now, so that's 15 years I've played professional football,\" Wass says.\n\n\"Instead of keeping all the things you've tried and all the knowledge to yourself, give it to others. If one little guy has me as his idol and he can talk to me and get advice, I would love that. I think it's all about giving back to people who give so much to you.\n\n\"To give something back and to help other people is a big goal in life. I think this platform is to give back what you know.\""
