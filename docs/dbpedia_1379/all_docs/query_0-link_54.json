        "text": "As we come into the remaining ten match days of the La Liga season, a lot is still to play for up and down the table. There are currently three sides battling it out for the one survival spot down at the bottom of the table, at the top, there’s slightly less competition for places as Barça have all but sealed the title for this season. Where it’s most congested is in the middle. Here we have the fight for Europe. Villarreal, Girona, Eibar, Getafe, Real Betis and, of course, Celta Vigo, all in contention for these two spare places that would see them qualify for the Europa League next season. Due to Sevilla’s achievement of reaching the final, it is almost certain that 7th place will also qualify for the European competition, but amongst all these smaller sides battling it out for the final spot, are Celta beginning to seem like the major under-performers in this group of teams?\n\nLast season, Berizzo saw over a Celta side that managed to reach the semi-finals of the Europa League, narrowly losing out to Manchester United. Despite a rather successful cup campaign, Celta fell away in the latter stages of the season in the league having prioritised the cup competition, which meant they fell to the bottom half of the table and failed to qualify for another season of European football. So, Berizzo’s departure to Sevilla in the summer, it was now up to Juan Carlos Unzué to step up to the plate and bring them back up into European contention. The Spaniard had only managed two clubs since his playing days (Numancia 10/11 & Racing Santander 12/13) before becoming a coaching assistant at Celta (in the 13/14 season) and then working as Luis Enrique’s right-hand man at Barcelona shortly after (from 2014 to 2017). So, this was his personal test at managing a higher level club, as he said so himself, he wanted to challenge himself with Celta.\n\nUnzué is nothing if not an interesting coach. Showcasing elements of Juego de Posición in his attacking play that makes his side so appealing to watch, he has also brought about, or at least attempted to install, a defensive compactness in Celta’s game. So, having signed a two-year deal with the Galician side, the question was how he would get on at his new club, and the answer, so far, is just fine. The competition for these top places has been sturdy, and whilst the success stories of newly promoted sides Girona and Getafe have taken many by surprise, it begs the question whether this is a worthy excuse for Celta not being in a leading position for the European places. Boasting what is most likely the best, young squad of all of these sides, you might expect to see Celta sat right next to Sevilla in 5th, however, they currently sit in 9th, seven points away from Sevilla, with Villarreal, Eibar and Girona all placed ahead of them in the table.\n\nWith such a wealth of talent, seen through the likes of: Maxi Gómez, Iago Aspas, Stanislav Lobotka, Hugo Mallo, Jonny Otto, Pione Sisto, Daniel Wass, Emre Mor and many more, it’s somewhat of a surprise that they haven’t been finding strong levels consistency throughout the season. Even Celta’s squad depth is a level above many of the opposing sides in and around them, so why aren’t they quite up there with the rest? Well, I believe there are a few factors to take into consideration here…\n\nLearning positional play\n\nThe ‘art’ of positional play can be a tough one to learn, or rather more of a lengthy process. It will often take time to learn the ways a manager wants certain players to play with and without the ball – even if Unzué isn’t quite as traditional in these ways – the same can be seen with Setién’s Betis this season; there have been plenty of highs and lows, yet not a lot of consistency in their form in the league, which has ultimately seen them placed in an identical position to Celta.\n\nIn spite of their wealth of talent, such a young squad means there are still a host of players learning the ways of the game, still, which brings into play the factor of inexperience. Not necessarily knowing how to deal with going a goal behind, or even going a goal ahead properly, and that’s where you need your manager to step in and guide them.\n\nFew games summarise Celta better this season than their recent home match against Espanyol. Due to some sloppy counter-pressing following a long ball, the away side were able to break and nick a one-goal lead. From this point, the on-slaught of Celta attacks began. They created chance after chance, missing many until they eventually managed to turn it around late on in the game. They’d performed very well for the majority of the ninety minutes, up until they conceded a late, late equaliser that saw them finish the match with just a point in a 2-2 draw. So many times this season have I seen Celta create plenty of great openings yet fail to act on them accordingly. Their failure to work openings or finish opportunities has cost them, or at least left them vulnerable to one chance falling for their opponents and proving to be a crucial one. The same could be seen in yesterday’s 3-0 defeat to Atléti – Celta had a lot of good spells in possession and defended compactly, however, on the two occasions where they failed to convert clear cut opportunities, they were subsequently punished moments later.\n\nAnother pattern that can be seen in their xG scores is that Celta will convert a decent-to-great chance early on, but then fail to record anymore chances of note for the rest of the game, unless required to because of an equaliser from the opposition. And, although, at times, they have been good at killing the momentum of teams through their possession play/compact deep block, they have still been liable to conceding needless goals.\n\nThe promising thing from Unzué’s perspective, here, is that his side are good at opening their opponents up, even against the top sides. They took a point from the Camp Nou, they also held off at home to Real and should’ve at least earned a point, if not all three, in the Mestalla before the turn of the year. The worrying thing, however, is that, at this stage of the season where proceedings are very tight and a loss of form could see you free fall down the table, it is so important that they take every opportunity they get.\n\nThe competition\n\nThe 2017/18 La Liga season has seen the rise of Girona. Brand new to the top division, Pablo Machín’s side have taken the league by storm, playing in a similar way to Unzué, to some extent. The Catalan-based side have also showcased aspects of positional play in their 3-5-2 system, yet also are able to remain very compact without the ball. You also have to mention the likes of Eibar and Getafe, whose home form is right up there with the best this season. Betis, too, have foreseen major improvements with Quique Setién at the helm, a club that could go some way further in the coming seasons with him in charge. Villarreal can’t be forgotten either, a side who have consistently kept their themselves in steady contention for a European spot.\n\nTo some extent, the number of sides competing at this level has made each clash much tighter than it would’ve been in previous seasons. There are fewer “easy” away games to pick up points in and home games are all must-win scenarios, especially against every team outside of the top three.\n\nIn spite of all this, the question still remains: are Celta where they should be?\n\nNot quite. I think, with the squad and the potential of the manager, there is more than enough room for improvement. Even if Celta found themselves in the top six or seven places within the coming weeks, the question would still be hovering over whether they should’ve been there already. In my opinion, Unzué’s approach is an admirable one, and one that can be successful, it just might take some time to really get going, though.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Unzué is capable of taking this Celta squad into the Europa League by next May, at the latest. However, the onus is all on them from this group of sides because, with many players looking to feature at the World Cup this summer, if Celta don’t claim a place in Europe, they will struggle to keep this squad intact. A squad that is, for me, the best amongst those placed outside of the top five.\n\nWhat may worry Unzué now, though, is the matter of the remaining fixtures. Before yesterday, Celta had yet to face any of the current top six sides for a second time, still with five to go, they have it all to do if they want to clinch a place in Europe next season."
