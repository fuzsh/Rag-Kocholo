        "text": "LEICESTER are in a three-club fight for Denmark midfielder Daniel Wass.\n\nCrystal Palace and Swansea have also shown interest in the Celta Vigo star and will make their move when they secure Premier League safety.\n\nAll three clubs want the 28-year-old and are eyeing a cut-price £4million switch as Wass has one year left on his deal in Spain.\n\nClaude Puel is set to finish in the top 10 this season and is plotting a push for European football, with Wass as a No8 to add quality in the middle of the pitch.\n\nPalace boss Roy Hodgson returned to Scandinavia, where he coached earlier in his career, to sign Alexander Sorloth in January and is a huge admirer of Wass.\n\nSwansea are looking to strengthen to avoid another relegation battle next season and could be without Ki Sung-yueng as the midfielder has not agreed a new contract.\n\nWass has attracted interest from La Liga clubs but a move to the Premier League could be attractive after three years in Spain.\n\nHe moved from Benfica following a spell at the Portuguese giants when he was loaned out to Evian in France.\n\nCHARGED Uefa open disciplinary proceedings against Liverpool over incident that saw Man City team bus pelted with bottles and missiles\n\nWass has a chance of going to the World Cup after being involved in their squads during qualification."
