        "text": "When the Baltimore Ravens hit the practice field Monday afternoon after Sunday’s off day, they’ll officially have entered the second week of training camp. Their preseason opener against the Philadelphia Eagles is in 11 days. Their regular-season opener versus the Kansas City Chiefs is just over five weeks away.\n\nQuarterback Lamar Jackson’s absence for most of the first week because of an illness has generated plenty of headlines. He returned to the field Saturday afternoon and looked sharp and energized. Otherwise, it was a mostly uneventful first week of camp. There were few changes in practice participation from one day to the next. The extracurricular activities were kept to a minimum, even after the pads came on Friday.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWith precise passes and flying chest bumps, Lamar Jackson proves he's feeling better\n\nThe defense dominated most days. The secondary proved to be the main attraction. The team’s top offensive playmakers still got an expected number of touches most days.\n\nIt’s too early to say a specific player has either significantly hurt or helped his roster chances. The Ravens still have three preseason games and nearly a month’s worth of practices before the roster has to be cut down from 91 to 53 by Aug. 27. It, however, is not premature to note who were standouts and who might not have had a great first week of camp.\n\nWe’ll examine whose stock is up and whose stock is down a handful of times during training camp/preseason. This is the first installment.\n\nStock up\n\nJalyn Armour-Davis, CB: You could probably list two-thirds of the secondary in this category. Ravens defensive backs are averaging about three interceptions per practice. Armour-Davis has certainly stood out. The 2022 fourth-round pick has good speed and ideal size (6 feet 1, 197 pounds), but he’s been limited to 12 games in two years, mostly playing special teams. He got through the first week of camp healthy and maintained a high level of play. He’s been tight in coverage and gotten his hands on several footballs. In what figures to be a tightly contested roster competition at cornerback, Armour-Davis has made an early statement.\n\nRashod Bateman, WR: With the Ravens light on the wide receivers depth chart and Bateman expected to have a more significant role, the fourth-year pro has been one of the most scrutinized players in camp. There’s been a lot of good so far. Even with the passing game struggling without Jackson on the field, Bateman has made a few plays in just about every practice. He looks healthy, and that’s the most important thing. He’s moving well, running quality routes and catching the ball when it’s thrown to him.\n\nDaniel Faalele, G: It’s not that Faalele has been a practice standout. He’s been fine. We’ll know more about how well his transition from tackle to guard is going once the preseason games begin. However, it’s significant that Faalele is getting the first opportunity to win the starting right guard job. That was not the expectation a few months ago, but it’s clear that John Harbaugh and the coaching staff want to get a good look at him in that spot. At this point, he probably has to be considered the favorite — albeit a slight one — over the likes of Ben Cleveland, Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu and Josh Jones.\n\nTravis Jones, DT: Travis Jones is another guy who has been a fixture on this list at this time of year, but he hasn’t necessarily had his breakout yet. It might be just a matter of time. He flashes once or twice just about every practice. He looks to be in great shape at 6 feet 4, 338 pounds and has shown an explosive first step. Baltimore’s entire starting defensive line is returning, but Jones is pushing for a much more significant snap share than what he got last season.\n\nArthur Maulet, CB: Maulet is 31. He’s played seven NFL seasons and was a key part of one of the league’s top defenses last year. Yet, there’s been a sense of urgency to his play this summer. It’s like Maulet knows the Ravens have myriad options in the slot and wants to make sure he’s not forgotten. He had two interceptions last week and another one nullified by a penalty. He’s constantly running to the football and getting his hands on offensive players when the opportunity allows. It will be tough for first-year defensive coordinator Zach Orr to keep him off the field.\n\nOdafe Oweh, OLB: The fourth-year player’s roster spot is plenty secure, but he’s playing like a guy who believes he needs to have a great camp to make the team. Oweh has been the most impactful player on the field. He was so disruptive last week that Harbaugh “had to pull the reins in on him a little bit” during one practice. Oweh was making it difficult for the offense to get anything done. Oweh, the 2021 first-round pick who has 13 sacks in three seasons, has looked dominant in training camp before. But that doesn’t mean you dismiss what he’s doing. He looks in great form, and that’s good news for a Ravens team that needs him to break out.\n\nHonorable mention: Marlon Humphrey, CB; Isaiah Likely, TE; Justin Madubuike, DL; Damarion Williams, CB; Owen Wright, RB.\n\nStock down\n\nBack-end WR candidates: Bateman, Zay Flowers and Nelson Agholor have gotten their catches. Rookie fourth-round pick Devontez Walker has come on over the past couple of days. Deonte Harty seems entrenched as the team’s return man. There might be room for one other receiver. Yet, the competition for that spot hasn’t really developed. Tylan Wallace, Sean Ryan and Keith Kirkwood have been mostly quiet. Malik Cunningham has had a few drops. Undrafted rookies Dayton Wade, Isaiah Washington and Qadir Ismail haven’t gotten too many balls thrown their way. Saturday was a good day for this group, and there will have to be more of that to convince team officials that keeping a sixth receiver is the way to go.\n\nBen Cleveland, G: Andrew Vorhees entered camp as the favorite to start at left guard, and nothing happened in the first week to change that. Faalele is getting the first opportunity to win the right guard job. Where does that leave Cleveland, who was once perceived as the favorite to start at right guard? There’s still time for Cleveland to get a shot as a starter, but that the Ravens are auditioning a converted tackle inside rather than giving him the early first-team reps probably doesn’t bode well.\n\nAdisa Isaac, OLB/T.J. Tampa, CB: Persistent hamstring issues have shelved Isaac since Baltimore drafted him in the third round. Tampa, a rookie fourth-rounder, had abdominal surgery after mandatory minicamp and started training camp on the physically unable to perform list. By no fault of their own, both rookies are missing out on valuable reps. They also are playing positions at which there is a lot of competition for snaps. Playing catchup for rookies can be difficult, but that’s what Isaac and Tampa will have to do.\n\nJosh Johnson, QB: Team officials anointed Johnson the No. 2 quarterback long before camp began, and there doesn’t appear to be a competition for that role. With Jackson sidelined, the Ravens got a long look at Johnson with the ones and there was a fair share of struggles. Johnson was in a tough spot, facing a really good defense behind an offensive line under construction. Still, Johnson held on to the ball for too long at times and then put the ball in harm’s way a little too often.\n\nJosh Jones, OL: The Ravens know what they have in Josh Jones, and it appears that, at least for now, they see him more as a backup. That’s not a complete surprise, although with all of the inexperienced guard options and an unsettled right tackle situation, the door was open for a veteran like Jones to secure a starting spot. It still could happen, but he’s behind Patrick Mekari at tackle, and Baltimore seems intent on going younger inside.\n\nAr’Darius Washington, DB: Context is needed here, because Washington, like many of the team’s defensive backs, has had a solid start to camp and has more than held his own in coverage. But last week’s signing of veteran Eddie Jackson takes Washington out of consideration for the No. 3 safety role. The Ravens last week also signed veteran safety Daryl Worley, adding another experienced body to the secondary mix. Worley’s a more physical, experienced and trusted special teams option than Washington. Washington can also be used in the nickel, but the Ravens are pretty crowded there, too, with Maulet, Humphrey, Kyle Hamilton and Williams. Washington has a lot of fans in the building. It’s just a matter of whether Baltimore will be able to find a roster spot for him.\n\n(Photo of Rashod Bateman: Nick Wass / Associated Press)"
