        "text": "Daniel Wass’ preseason has begun well, and his performances in 2020/21 have earned him a call-up for Denmark for their UEFA Nations League encounters next month. The versatile Valencia CF squad member spoke to VCF Media this week to explain how training is going at the Ciudad Deportiva.\n\n“We've been training with the coaching staff for two weeks now. We're feeling very good. The players are very happy with the training sessions; they are pretty tough, of course, because it's preseason, but we feel very good,” he said after Wednesday’s fitness session.\n\n“We train very hard, with a lot of intensity, twice a day, to get in good shape for when LaLiga gets underway. The coach has some very good ideas and gets us playing with a lot of intensity. I think that he's very good for us. He's a very good coach: There's a lot of joy and intensity in training, and I like it a lot.”\n\nThe club are now in the midst of a run of three friendlies, which continues into Friday and Saturday.\n\n“We're training every day to take the coaching staff’s ideas onboard and learn what they show us. We've got games against Villarreal and Levante, which are very good fixtures for us.\n\n“The other day we played against CD Castellón, and won 1-0. I gave the pass that set up the goal, and I'm very happy with how I played.”\n\nBeing part of the national team setup is something of which Wass is very proud, and he is just happy to play football -wherever on the pitch that may be.\n\n“Getting called up again by Denmark is very important for me. I'm very happy about it. The national team have a new coach as well.”\n\n“Obviously, the most important thing for me is playing. Whether it's on the wing or in the middle, I don't mind. The most important thing is playing and helping the team.”"
