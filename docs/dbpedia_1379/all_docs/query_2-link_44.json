        "text": "Atlético Madrid and Brøndby have reached an agreement over the transfer of Daniel Wass, as reported by Farzam Abolhosseini at the Danish paper BT.\n\nThe player is currently undergoing his medical to complete his move to his boyhood club. It is believed that Brøndby will not pay a transfer fee to secure the services of the 33-year-old.\n\nWass arrived to Los Colchoneros in January 2022 from Valencia for a fee of €2.7 million as an emergency replacement for Kieran Trippier, who departed the club to join Newcastle United.\n\nHowever, he spent most of his time at Atléti on the side lines after picking up a muscle injury on his debut against Barcelona.\n\nFollowing his return to fitness, he was unable to fight himself back into the starting XI. With the arrival of Nahuel Molina from Udinese this summer, Diego Simeone has signalled to Wass that he is not counting on him for the upcoming season.\n\nGSFN"
