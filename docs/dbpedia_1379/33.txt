Atlético Madrid have announced the sale of Daniel Wass to former club Brøndby.

It sees the 33-year-old return to the club where he began his career before leaving to enjoy spells in Portugal, France and Spain.

Wass leaves the Rojiblancos just six months after arriving, having moved to the Spanish capital in January from Valencia and after making just one appearance.
