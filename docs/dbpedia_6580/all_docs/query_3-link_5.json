        "text": "In the season finale of Ghost Hunters International the GHI team flies off to lovely Puerto Rico to investigate those iconic fortresses of San Cristobal and El Morro. You’ve seen that fort, it’s featured in every advertisement ever made for vacationing in Puerto Rico, I think it was part of the deal when it became a US territory. We got a wonderful vacation spot that is still on American soil and they got to have their fort’s photo plastered on everything from here to Shanghai.\n\nGiving us the download again is Susan “it feels wrong in here” Slaughter. We are told about apparitions of fully-dressed soldiers (as opposed to half-naked ones I guess), footsteps, entities walking through walls, a chinese prisoner that starved to death and that today the dungeon is used as a theater. We are also shown a photo of what is described as ‘orbs.’ Yes. Orbs. Not to worry, through some foot scuffing and flash photography the team is able to debunk, and once again, thoroughly denounce those nasty orbs.\n\nThere were a couple of standouts within this investigation. First there was Joe Chin speaking in tongues. Usually it’s Barry that conducts the EVP sessions when a language other than English is needed, so it was nice to see Joe getting in on the action and attempting to contact the Chinese prisoner that had starved to death.\n\nThe second interesting thing on this investigation was Susan and Paul in the tunnels at San Cristobal. While Paul runs around trying to find the source of a shuffling that he hears we get to listen to Susan complain about feeling dizzy, weak in the knees and ‘almost going into a trance.’ Honestly, I looked the other way during the last two episodes when she started with the ‘feeling dizzy’ stuff but this time it was just too much. Seriously, it reminded me of the several times that my son attempted to convince me that he was sick and that he really need to stay home from school even though he had that really, really big math test. You’ve seen it from your own kids I’m sure and if you don’t have kids, I’m sure you’ve pulled it on your own parents. Anyway. I’m not saying I don’t think that maybe Susan is sensitive, but you know what, that is NOT what Ghost Hunters has ever been about. Suck it up, stuff those feelings down deep inside and use your EMF meters, video camera and get the evidence. “It feels wrong in here” is NOT evidence and even if you pass out cold and your head spins around and Barry has to call in an exorcist to get you back to ‘normal’ on the season premiere, it’s still not evidence and it never will be. So please just stop it.\n\nThe analysis of the actual evidence on this investigation was interesting. Thre were a couple of EVPs, one of a voice saying ‘Damn’ and the other the sound of laughter. Susan was also able to find a photo of the previous lighthouse which showed an archway where one of the witnesses said they had seen an entity pass through. Barry declares the fortresses to contain paranormal activity but doesn’t go so far as to say the joints are haunted.\n\nOn the second investigation of the evening, the Ghost Hunters International team remains in Puerto Rico and investigates the Tapia Theatre. The theatre, we are told, is experiencing apparitions, people being touched, shadow figures, footsteps, singing and a lady that was performing on stage fell down and died. I'm not sure if she is supposed to be one of the apparitions or if she was so frightened by one of the apparitions that she died of fright, which actually could then make her one of the apparitions after all. It's all a tangled web, isn't it?\n\nStarting out this investigation we have Joe Chin and Scott Tepperman up on the 3rd floor where Joe hears footsteps and Scott is working the EMF meter. I'll skip the dialogue in this scene because frankly it was pretty gross, but shortly we have Scott doing his own shortened version of the 'Dude run.' You can't see what happens on the video tape all we have is Scott suddenly jumping a mile and yelling at Joe to Go … Just GO … He then tells us that something took control of his arm and swung it forward.\n\nBarry and Kris do find some interesting tunnels underneath the theater that they proceeded to crawl through. I have to hand it to them, I’m not sure I would have been willing to go crawling through there in the dark. It not only made for interesting tv but I’m sure there are a good many fans out there that didn’t mind the prolonged butt shot of Kris Williams. Yeah. Enough said.\n\nSusan and Paul get basement duty once again and immediately Susan is getting all ‘this room feels off, too.’ Yeah. Again. Enough said.\n\nKris and Barry then spend a good deal of time chasing shadows across the balconies of the theater, but unfortunately we get no photographs or video evidence.\n\nThe analysis does reveal what the teasers for the show had been billing as the ‘best paranormal evidence ever captured by a Ghost Hunters team.’ There in basement we get video of a single frame of some kind of green triangle on the left of the screen on the thermal camera, while the infrared camera just does a re-focus. Damn you Syfy. You know, I don’t blame the Ghost Hunters International team here, this one is all the promotional people. Do you guys even watch these shows? I could give you a list off the top of my head of at least 20 different pieces of evidence caught over the years that make this bit of green geometry look downright silly. You know, I may have been a little more impressed by it if you hadn’t over-sold it to me in the first place. That’s like telling someone they won a new car and then showing up with the keys to a Ford Fiesta. Sure, it’s a new car but it’s a tin cracker-box that someone stuck 4 wheelbarrow tires on and dubbed it a car. But trust me on this, it is NOT a car. Ok. So rant over. Deep breath.\n\nAgain, the Ghost Hunters International team did not disappoint with some wonderful locations. The fortresses were really interesting and the theater had those really cool tunnels. If it hadn’t been for all the ‘psychic touchy feely’ stuff and the over-sell this would have been a great season finale for what turned out to be a really great season of Ghost Hunters International. My advice, give it a watch but fast-forward through anything that Susan has to say and skip the promos and you’ll be golden.\n\n-------------"
