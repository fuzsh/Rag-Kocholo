        "text": "This article is about the British sitcom Ghosts. For the American adaptation of the same name, see Ghosts (CBS series). For the supernatural entity, see Ghost.\n\nGhosts is a British sitcom that first premiered on BBC One in April 2019. It is written and performed by many of the cast members from Horrible Histories and Yonderland.\n\nPremise\n\nCrumbling country mansion Button House is home to restless spirits who have died there over the centuries. Each a product of their time, they are thrown together for eternity, resigned to squabble over mundane daily gripes. But their lives, or rather afterlives, are thrown into turmoil when young urban couple Alison and Mike unexpectedly inherit the peaceful derelict house and plan to turn it into a bustling hotel.\n\nThe ghosts initially plot to get rid of the newcomers, but after several failed attempts to scare them, one of the ghosts pushes Alison out of an upstairs window. When Alison awakens from an induced coma two weeks later, she discovers that Mike has arranged a huge mortgage and she now has the ability to see and hear ghosts due to her close brush with death.\n\nAlison initially believes the ghosts are hallucinations resulting from her accident, but inevitably accepts the truth and confronts them. Because the Coopers are unable to leave due to financial constraints, and the ghosts are confined to the mansion's grounds until they can ascend into the afterlife, both sides eventually agree that they must coexist as best they can. Meanwhile, the house needs a lot of work, and Alison and Mike come up with several schemes to try and stay afloat.\n\nCast\n\nCharlotte Ritchie as Alison Cooper\n\nKiell Smith-Bynoe as Mike Cooper\n\nMartha Howe-Douglas as Fanny\n\nMathew Baynton as Thomas Thorne\n\nSimon Farnaby as Julian Fawcett\n\nLolly Adefope as Kitty\n\nLaurence Rickard as Robin and Humphrey's Head\n\nBen Willbond as The Captain\n\nKaty Wix as Mary\n\nJim Howick as Pat\n\nCharacters\n\nThe principal living characters are Alison Cooper, played by Charlotte Ritchie, and her husband Mike, played by Kiell Smith-Bynoe. As the series begins, they are a young couple struggling to get on the housing ladder, until Alison unexpectedly inherits Button House from a distant relative she never even knew existed. Alison and Mike move in to Button House with the intention of doing it up and opening it as a hotel, but in doing so attract the opprobium of the ghosts who already populate the house. Although the ghosts cannot be seen by the living, they do what they can to scare the Coopers away, culminating in causing Alison to have a near-fatal accident, which leads to her gaining the ability to see and hear the ghosts.\n\nThe ghosts themselves are people who have died on the site over several centuries, including Robin, a caveman; Humphrey, a decapitated Elizabethan nobleman; Kitty, a naive Georgian noblewoman; Mary, a medieval peasant woman apparently burned at the stake; Thomas Thorne, a failed Georgian poet; Fanny, a prim noblewoman of the Edwardian era; an unnamed WW2 army captain; Pat, a youth group leader accidentally shot during an archery lesson; and Julian Fawcett, a 1990s MP who died in a sex scandal. Button House is also haunted by a group of plague victims who mostly remain in the cellar.\n\nThe ghosts cannot normally be seen or heard by the living, though some have abilities which enable them to interact in a minor way with people, or with objects around them. The ghosts are free to roam the house and grounds, but cannot leave and are deflected back if they attempt to cross the boundary. Being trapped together, they attempt to make the best of the situation but their options are somewhat limited, since although they can be supported on things, which allows them to sit on chairs, lie on beds and climb stairs, they are otherwise unable to interact with solid objects (with the exception of Julian, who can exert a little pressure on objects if he concentrates very hard). They are able to pass through solid objects with no ill effects, though passing through living people or animals (or having people or animals pass through them) is painful. While intangible to the living, ghosts are solid to each other. They are stuck with their appearance at the time of their death, including whatever they were wearing and any injuries they sustained. They cannot eat or drink human food because they are not in their own dimension but if they were they were they would be able to, in the human dimension they do still require sleep.\n\nTheir plight is made worse by the fact that over the years they have seen many people move on to another stage of existence, even after first being ghosts, but have no idea why they are still left behind.\n\nSeveral episodes have flashbacks which elaborate on the ghosts' backstories:\n\nEpisode Focus character Subject Happy Death Day Pat His death About Last Night Plague ghosts Arrival of the plague in their village Redding Weddy The Captain His work (and an unrequited love) during WW2 The Thomas Thorne Affair Thomas Circumstances of his death The Ghost of Christmas Julian His infidelity in life (particularly Christmas) The Bone Plot Humphrey Circumstances of his death A Lot to Take In Julian His reaction to becoming a ghost Something to Share?

However, it is haunted by a collection of invisible and intangible ghosts who died across Britain's history from prehistoric times to 1993. These ghosts retain their appearances from their deaths, can phase through walls but not floors or ceilings, cannot eat or drink but require sleep, and cannot leave the property until they can move on into the afterlife. Horrified by the couple's plan to turn the house into a hotel, as they experience great pain whenever living people pass through them, the ghosts unsuccessfully attempt to haunt the couple into leaving. Finally, disgraced politician Julian pushes Alison out of a first-floor window. She lands on grass and is taken to hospital by ambulance. Two weeks later, she awakes from an induced coma that left her briefly clinically dead. When she returns to the House, she learns to her horror that she can see and hear the ghosts. 2 \"Gorilla War\" 22 April 2019 102 Mike tries to convince Alison that her seeing and hearing the ghosts are after-effects of her coma. The ghosts embark on a war of attrition to try to force the couple out. With the ghosts becoming more intense, Alison visits a doctor who proves that she really can both see and hear them, being a ghost himself. Convinced they should sell the house, Mike finds out he cannot get out of the loan they took out to renovate the house without losing all of their savings. Alison attempts to reason with the ghosts, and they tell her that they want her and Mike to move out, but she refuses and tells them that she will do something for each one so that they can all co-exist peacefully. Mike comes to accept the ghosts' existences when he witnesses Julian press a keyboard key on his laptop, which appears to him as a key moving on its own, and follows the basement Plague ghosts' instructions via Alison to repair the broken heating system. 3 \"Happy Death Day\" 29 April 2019 103 Scoutmaster Pat is in a melancholy mood as he prepares for a visit by members of his living family for his 'death day': his widow Carole, now married to the man with whom she had an affair, Pat's son, the son's girlfriend, and the couple's baby boy. Mike tells Alison that he hates being watched by the ghosts, especially when using the toilet. Builders start work on the house, but the ghosts try to make them leave. Alison's struggle to filter out the ghosts leads the builders to consider her eccentric and rude. Naïve Georgian noblewoman Kitty asks around to learn where babies come from and gets a variety of unhelpful answers. After meeting his grandson, who has been named in his honour, and making peace with that part of his past, Pat appears to begin moving on to the afterlife, only to learn the light shining on him is a lamp used by the builders. Fed up with Alison, the builders quit. 4 \"Free Pass\" 6 May 2019 104 With money running low, Mike and Alison allow the filming of a regency period drama in the house, Life of Byron. The ghosts react in different ways to the action in their home. Romantic poet Thomas is driven to despair by his hatred of Lord Byron and Alison's crush on the lead actor. Julian pesters Alison to place a bet on a horse race for him. Pat teaches Mary about the art of filmmaking and discovers she has a natural talent. Robin the caveman is distracted by the studio lights, and struggles for dominance over the gaffer. Lady Fanny, unlike Kitty, is unhappy about the sex scene enacted in the bedroom. Meanwhile, Mike and Alison fail to inform the production of weight limitations imposed on the structure by the surveyors. Eventually, part of the floor collapses and the film crew promptly leaves. 5 \"Moonah Ston\" 13 May 2019 105 Mike and Alison's wealthy neighbours Barclay and Bunny Beg-Chetwynde (Geoffrey McGivern and Sophie Thompson) invite themselves around for a dinner party to discuss access rights to their driveway. Barclay wants Mike and Alison to pay him £20,000 for the access rights. Mike misunderstands and shakes on it. Alison tries to win the access rights for free by cheating in a poker game, but she loses and the price jumps to £40,000. Thanks to Julian, Alison informs Barclay that she knows about his offshore bank account in Fiji, so he allows the young couple to use the land for free. Alison introduces the ghosts to Friends and they quickly become fans. Robin persuades the ghosts to participate in an ancient ritual in honour of a lunar eclipse. Though this distracts Alison during the dinner party, Robin later explains why he views the moon as significant. 6 \"Getting Out\" 20 May 2019 106 Having run out of capital and enthusiasm for restoring Button House themselves, Alison and Mike are ecstatic to receive an offer from a luxury hotel chain. The ghosts would prefer the couple to stay, and are disappointed when they agree to sell. The couple looks for a house to buy, but Alison rejects the two which an estate agent shows them after seeing other ghosts haunting them. Eventually, she approves of a brand new building. Fanny offers a priceless jewel to Alison to solve Button House's money problems, but Alison discovers that Fanny's husband already sold it. The Captain devises a plan to get Alison and Mike to tell the hotel chain to survey the basement as a potential place for a swimming pool and spa. During the survey, builders uncover a plague pit in the basement, and the hotel chain withdraws its offer.\n\nSeries 2 (2020)\n\nMain article: Series 2\n\n# Episode Air date Prod. code 1 \"The Grey Lady\" 21 September 2020 201 With the plans to convert Button House into a hotel on hold, Alison and Mike advertise the property as a wedding venue to generate an income. However, ghost hunters are drawn to the manor after a photographer accidentally captures a photo of Fanny and shares it on social media. The couple takes advantage of the situation when offered payment for admission. Pat and Thomas try to host a radio show on EVP equipment. Alison struggles to convince the other ghosts to help out, leading her and Mike to attempt to recreate the ghosts' unique powers. Eventually the scheme is revealed when Alison tries to impersonate Fanny. They are forced to refund the ghost hunters' money, and Button House is labeled a hoax. 2 \"About Last Night\" 28 September 2020 202 After a heavy night of partying, Alison and Mike awaken with severe hangovers and must race against the clock to prepare the house for a wedding planner to view. Alison has misplaced Fanny's beloved stuffed dog, Dante, and frantically retraces her steps. Thomas has renewed hopes of romance with Alison after something she said last night. Kitty is upset that she felt ignored during the party, despite Alison's efforts to explain the situation. Mike gets stuck on the roof with shoes and Sir Humphrey's head, which were tossed up there during drunken revelry. Because he's lost his voice, Mike can't call out for help. The still hung-over Alison throws up in front of the wedding planner and ruins any future bookings. 3 \"Redding Weddy\" 5 October 2020 203 Alison and Mike find a new wedding planner, who tells them to clear their garden so it can be \"wedding ready.\" Mary thinks she's finally ready to talk about her witch trial. The Captain warns Alison not to dig in a specific area of the garden, as something potentially explosive is buried there. Fanny reads Lady Chatterley's Lover and develops sexual feelings for Mike. The Captain recalls being commanding officer of a troop in Button House, and when his lieutenant Havers left for the war front, the Captain was unable to admit his romantic feelings. Back in the present, a bomb is set off in the garden and starts a fire, undoing Mary's progress. No one is physically hurt, but Alison thought \"explosive\" was metaphorical. The Captain explains he buried a limpet mine with its blueprints. After some scrambling, the client arrives and books the house. As everyone settles in for Film Club, the Captain remembers Havers saluting him before leaving the house, and Fanny overcomes her feelings for Mike after watching him messily eat nachos. 4 \"The Thomas Thorne Affair\" 12 October 2020 204 Mike is nervous about encountering Alison's ex-boyfriend, Kevin, at her school reunion because she has claimed she left Kevin for Mike. Thomas reveals to Alison that he died in a duel over a woman named Isabelle. Robin, Mary, and Kitty all recall the events differently. Humphrey helps Thomas realise that his cousin, Francis Button (the namesake of the house), engineered the duel and deceived Thomas into losing so Francis could court and marry Isabelle. Thomas did not die unloved, as he believed, yet this only makes him feel worse about the situation (especially as he cannot get rid of a forged letter that put Francis's plan into effect, as it forms a part of his being). Mike discovers on Facebook that Kevin is an ex-convict and boxer. Alison explains to Mike that she lied and Kevin actually broke up with her. His fears assuaged, they leave for the reunion. 5 \"Bump In The Night\" 19 October 2020 205 Alison has a night out, leaving Mike alone in the house for the first time.

Alison struggles to get home quickly. Mike tries to call the police, but his phone's battery dies. The Captain orders Kitty and Mary to keep an inventory of the stolen loot, although they have trouble with mnemonics to remember the items. Unheard by the burglars, Pat implores the younger of the two to not pursue crime, while Lady Fanny berates them for the various errors and oversights they make while stealing. Mike attempts to scare away the burglars by dressing as a ghostly knight, only to fall over due to the suit of armour's weight. Robin howls to alert the neighbouring dogs, catching Beg-Chetwynde's attention, and he uses a shotgun to stop the burglars from driving away as Alison returns home. The police arrive and arrest the criminals, although Pat is outraged to learn they will only receive probation. 6 \"Perfect Day\" 26 October 2020 206 A blizzard strikes on the day of the house's first wedding. Fanny is disgusted that a lesbian couple is getting married, stemming from her homosexual husband killing her after she discovered his affairs. Humphrey convinces her to accept the marriage, citing his own unhappiness from his arranged marriage. Fanny considers she may not have been murdered if her husband could have been open about his sexuality. One of the brides has doubts, but goes ahead with the wedding after a conversation with Alison, who recalls having doubts of her own. Mike overhears this and is angered. Pat recognises one of the guests as the boy that accidentally killed him and flies into a rage, but finds closure when the now-grown man pays respect to Pat outside the mansion. Mike and Alison reconcile at the reception. 7 \"The Ghost of Christmas\" 23 December 2020 207 Mike is playing host to his family, and is desperate to get everything right. Alison also works to arrange the best Christmas, for both the living and the dead. However, their efforts are undermined when Mike's father takes charge of everything and Mike's sisters disparage the idea of singing traditional Christmas carols which Alison had been looking forward to; while Mike and his father reconcile, the ghosts join Alison in singing In The Bleak Midwinter. Julian reflects on how he neglected his wife and daughter and feels guilty that he never saw the latter grow up. He then bonds with Nancy, the baby of Mike's sister Angela, as infants can see ghosts. Julian later looks up his daughter Rachel on the Internet and discovers that she grew up to be a Green Party MP. Though he disapproves of her politics, he's still proud of her.\n\nSeries 3 (2021)\n\nMain article: Series 3\n\n# Episode Air date Prod. code 1 \"The Bone Plot\" 9 August 2021 301 A documentary about the Tudor period is being filmed at Button House, prompting Humphrey to recall his death. When he learnt that his French wife, Sophie, plotted to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I, he was unjustly framed for the conspiracy and fled the Queen's guards. Most people believe the guards beheaded Humphrey on the spot, but he was actually beheaded when he banged his fist against a fireplace where he was hiding, causing two swords to come loose from the wall and swing down onto his neck. When nosy neighbour Barclay Beg-Chetwynde is desperate to take part in the documentary, Julian tries to force him off the estate, believing he will soon die and the ghosts will be stuck with him for eternity. Meanwhile, Thomas gives Alison elocution lessons when she is pestered to feature in the documentary. The rest of the ghosts attempt to make Fanny and the Captain laugh.

A series of events terrifies the ghosts inside the house, leading them to join Alison outside. Alison and Mike compete to see who is the best camper, but Alison cheats when Pat offers his wilderness knowledge, to the chagrin of the Captain, who struggles to help Mike. Mike tries his hand at glamping. Thomas laments that his Grand Tour didn't spark his creativity. Unable to sleep due to the ghosts incessantly talking, Alison goes to Mike's tent and tells him he wins the competition. Kitty tells Alison about the scary film, and she quickly deduces that Julian changed the channel. 4 \"I Love Lucy\" 30 August 2021 304 Alison is advised by her solicitor to obtain evidence of Lucy's familial relations for the sake of her inheritance.

Alison encourages Kitty to open up, but the ghosts try to stop the therapy session, fearing she may have a breakdown.

From the session, Pat realises that his wife had an affair because of his rigidly ordered lifestyle, Julian realises his feeling of regret over abandoning his daughter, the Captain almost comes out about his repressed homosexuality, and Mary relates to the group her recurring nightmare. Meanwhile, Mike becomes frustrated about not being able to communicate with the ghosts and seeks the aid of black magic from online sources.

When their first guests arrive, they worry desperately about how much they are enjoying the stay, while Pat takes the opportunity to teach Mary about what holidays are. Meanwhile, Thomas deals with the fallout of Alison's portrait of him making him an unexpected local celebrity with the plague victims, and Robin tries to convince the others that he was acquainted with a caveman whose remains' discovery has made the news. A documentary reveals that Hat, the caveman in question, died from hypothermia after giving away the pelts Robin now wears in exchange for a tool. 2 \"Speak as ye choose\" 30 September 2022 402 Mike meets up with a successful former college friend and his partner who have chosen to stay at Button House, but their offer for him and Alison to join them in a business growth meeting turns out to be more than a little suspicious. Mary finally opens up about how her earlier centuries as a ghost, with the help of her friend Annie, taught her to speak her mind, Kitty shows the Captain how to enjoy doing nothing, and Thomas struggles to get over his infatuation with Alison. 3 \"The Hardest Word\" 7 October 2022 403 Alison tells off the ghosts for their recent behaviour, so they try to work out how to apologise to her. After encouraging Alison to take a break from the ghosts and managing the bed and breakfast, Mike attempts to organise a tightly scheduled day off for her.

When Mary suddenly and unexpectedly ascends into the afterlife, Alison and the ghosts have to find ways to deal with their grief. Robin, who has grown accustomed to ghosts moving on and was watching a family of mice when Mary ascended, ultimately helps them by explaining that he remembers every ghost who previously haunted the land with him by naming a star after them, which he then does for Mary. 5 \"Poached Guests\" 21 October 2022 405 Barclay Beg-Chetwynde learns of Alison and Mike's new B&B and becomes determined to beat her at her own game by luring customers to his country estate by any unscrupulous means necessary, leaving Alison forced to turn for help from Julian, whom she considers Barclay's moral equal. While Mike is busy regretting buying miniature zorbing balls to liven up the B&B, the other ghosts are too busy to notice because they have discovered another ghost called Maddocks in the neighbouring field, much to his annoyance. 6 \"Not Again\" 29 October 2022 406 Having finally achieved a five-star rating for the B&B, Alison sends Mike to an auction to obtain some new chairs but he instead brings home a giant stuffed bear. While they argue about it, Robin is terrified of this new arrival. A flashback reveals that two of his friends were killed by a bear during a hunt; he escaped by climbing a tree but was then killed when the tree was struck by lightning. Alison and Mike keep moving the bear around the house, scaring Robin further, until Mike takes it outside as a thunderstorm hits and he shelters under the tree where Robin, whose real name turns out to be Rogh, died. Realising the danger, Robin runs out into the storm and draws the lightning to himself, thereby saving Mike. He and Alison then reconcile shortly before the Gatehouse is struck by lightning and catches fire. The Coopers and the ghosts stare at the burning wreckage of the Gatehouse, wondering how they can raise money to save it, and whether it is worth the effort. Meanwhile, Julian attempts to prove to the other ghosts that he is not morally vacuous, and Thomas and Pat become fascinated by the concept of veganism. 7 \"It's Behind You\" 25 December 2022 407 At an archery demonstration hosted at Button House, the organiser mentions to Alison that he knew Pat and still has several of his home videos. She agrees to digitise them, wishing to show them to Pat at Christmas. However, after being tempted by Julian into taking a sneak peek at the Christmas presents Alison bought all the ghosts, Pat is disheartened after watching his family apparently mock him. While the Coopers plan to spend Christmas Day with Mike's family, the ghosts take the opportunity to rehearse a pantomime as a present for Alison. With Pat still upset from the home videos, he abandons leading the rehearsals, which descend into anarchy as a result; Robin reassures Pat that even though his family made fun of him, they still loved him. After the Coopers spend Christmas Day trapped in a traffic jam, Alison and the plague ghosts watch the ghosts' pantomime of Cinderella (while Mike, who cannot see them, plays on his tablet). When Alison shows the ghosts their presents, Pat confesses that he already saw his; Alison cheers Pat up by showing him videos made after his death by his son, which show his family remembering him fondly.\n\nSeries 5 (2023)\n\nMain article: Series 5\n\n# Episode Air date Prod. code 1 \"Fools\" 6 October 2023 501 On April Fools' Day, most of the ghosts prank Alison as she wakes up by making her think she cannot see or hear them any more. Desiring revenge, she teams up with the equally hard-done-by Humphrey to get their own back, trying to prank each of the other ghosts one by one in order of gullibility before midday, but Pat remains stubbornly hard to fool owing to his years of experience as a scoutmaster. Meanwhile, Mike receives a visit from their insurance company to make a claim on the B&B fire and he realises how implausible the story behind it sounds. With midday passed and their insurance claim secured, Alison surprises Mike with one more piece of unexpected news: she is pregnant. 2 \"Home\" 13 October 2023 502 Mike is anxious about being a good father. After learning that many of Button House's antiques have lost their value due to damage, the Coopers decide to sell off land to raise money for when the baby comes. Only Fanny objects, with the other ghosts not being bothered about it due to the stretch of land in question being out of the way. After discovering that it is part of the green belt, the Coopers decide to sell it to a golf resort, however, Fanny's eulogising over Button House provides inspiration for Thomas' entry in a poetry competition with the theme of \"Home\". Meanwhile, Kitty becomes convinced that she is sharing Alison's pregnancy side effects while Pat and Julian debate the merits of north versus south. 3 \"Pineapple Day\" 20 October 2023 503 After a surveyor reveals that the land that the Coopers wish to sell can only accommodate a twelve-hole golf course, they try to negotiate with Barclay Beg-Chetwynde for the sale of additional land, although he attempts to drive a hard bargain. After Mike and Barclay are accidentally locked in the house's walk-in safe, Barclay agrees to a fair sale of his land after bonding with Mike (although Mike suggests to Alison that he engineered the situation to achieve said outcome). Meanwhile, after Alison discovers an accounts book from when Kitty died, she casually mentions how she died after drifting to sleep, raising the suspicions of the other ghosts. After investigating Kitty's death, during which both Kitty's jealous sister Eleanor and Lord Bummenbach, a visitor to Higham House who Kitty overheard was embezzling from the King, are suspected of killing her, the ghosts learn from Robin that she was killed by a venomous spider hiding in a pineapple presented as a gift; they also learn that, by Kitty's deathbed, Eleanor apologised for her harsh treatment of her. Also, several of the ghosts complain that Button House has not received a blue plaque dedicated to them; after Alison applies for one, it is dedicated to Henry VIII. 4 \"En Francais\" 27 October 2023 504 During a visit by a representative of the French-owned resort company that wishes to purchase the Coopers' land to sign off on the requisite paperwork, Mike tries to persuade her of his idea of opening up Button House as a unofficial members' bar, against Alison's advice. After hearing Mike's attempts to learn French, Robin reveals that he can speak fluent French, much to the amazement of everyone else. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Robin learnt French by listening to Lady Sophie Bone. Humphrey is outraged at this, although Robin states that he could only listen and Humphrey admits to his frustration with his marriage. After Mike accidentally triggers the company representative's nut allergy while demonstrating his idea, Robin and Humphrey help guide Alison to her epi-pen. Despite this, and the representative's translator thinking that Alison is mad after witnessing her talk to the ghosts, the sale goes through. Meanwhile, after the ghosts get into a rut with their normal activities, they decide to play quiz-show-style games adapted to their disembodied states and limited knowledge bases, with limited success. 5 \"Carpe Diem\" 3 November 2023 505 On the 'Annie-versary' (the day Annie moved on to the afterlife), Robin predicts that one of the ghosts will ascend as well before midnight that day. Kitty attempts to help reunite Humphrey's head and body; Fanny attempts to achieve several 'bucket list' activities; Thomas laments his failure to leave a legacy; Julian attempts to pull one of the plague ghosts (having ruled out Kitty and Fanny); Pat attempts to get everyone together to practise line dancing; Robin gets his affairs in order; and the Captain reveals the circumstances of his death, saying that he died of a heart attack after sneaking into an exclusive VE Day party by pretending to be a decorated officer, all to see his former lieutenant, Havers. Meanwhile, the Coopers attempt to have one more spontaneous night of fun before the baby arrives, by meeting with Obi and his new girlfriend Brenda. 6 \"Last Resort\" 10 November 2023 506 Inspired by Mike's proposal of opening up an informal members' bar at Button House, the resort company wishes to buy Button House to convert it into a golf resort. Abhorred by the idea, the ghosts attempt to charm or reason with Alison to decline the offer. During this, Pat and Robin argue over who has the best chance of wooing their favourite weather presenter; Kitty struggles to keep secret the gender of the Coopers' baby (which she discovered after accidentally passing through Alison's stomach); and Mike and Thomas attempt to console Obi after Brenda seemingly breaks up with him, although it is later revealed that she was only having difficulties with her phone. After Alison overhears Julian saying that he was responsible for her near-death experience and thus her ability to see ghosts, she decides to accept the offer. The ghosts demand that Julian apologise to Alison so that she does not go through with it. However, instead of apologising, Julian says that while he is ashamed of his actions, he does not regret them since they enriched Alison's life and the ghosts' afterlives; moved, Alison decides to decline the offer. Later, it is revealed that Kitty does not really know the baby's gender, believing that it is a boy after seeing its umbilical cord. 7 \"A Christmas Gift\" 25 December 2023 507 In the run up to Christmas, and with newborn Mia to look after, Alison and Mike are struggling to dislodge Mike's mother Betty after having stayed to help for the last seven weeks. Unfortunately for them, the ghosts, enamoured with the child because she can see them, are caught on the video baby monitor by Betty, who thus comes to believe that the house is haunted by ghosts. Despite attempting to convince her otherwise, Betty instead surprises the pair with a priest to perform an exorcism on the house, but this has no effect on the ghosts. Concluding that they have been interfering with Alison and Mike's lives as much as Betty had, the ghosts convince the pair to sell the house to the hotel firm. Several decades later, Button House has become an upscale hotel, with the basement converted into a sauna, to the delight of the Plague ghosts. An elderly Alison and Mike book into their \"usual suite\" that they have continued to visit annually, where Alison greets the ghosts once again as she enters.\n\nSee also\n\nFor some of the production timeline see Production/transmission Timeline\n\nFor the Comic Relief Red Nose Day telethon see Comic Relief 2023 Sketch\n\nVideos\n\nTrailers\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nClips"
