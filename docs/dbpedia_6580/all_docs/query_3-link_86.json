        "text": "While homeless:\n\n\"I could smell my vodka from MILES away!\"\n\n\"Have any spare rooms available? Preferably candle-lit with a hefty supply of booze?\"\n\nDuring the Day:\n\n\"I drink to forget certain... things. What things, you might ask? Well, the point is to forget them, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I'm literally balls drunk off my sass right now, what do you want?\"\n\n\"I'm either laughing because I'm drunk or because I've lost my mind, probably both.\"\n\n\"When I'm drunk I'm way happier... at least until the talking worms start to appear.\"\n\n\"I should reprogram the whole mod, while drunk, then send it back to the testers.\"\n\n\"What a great day! Might just drink so much that I get poisoned again.\"\n\nDuring the Night:\n\n\"A perfect night to light some candles, drink some wine and relax.\"\n\n\"Here's a challenge... take a shot for every time you've had to look at the wiki. Oh wait, you'd die.\"\n\n\"Yes, everyone knows the mechworm is buggy. Well, not anymore, but still.\"\n\n\"You lost or something? I don't mind company, but I'd rather be left alone at night.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you're 21? ...Alright, fine, but don't tell anyone I sold you these.\"\n\n\"I HATE WALMART! ...Anyway, what do you want this time?\"\n\n\"Drink something that turns you into a magical flying unicorn so you can be just like me.\"\n\n\"Did anyone ever tell you that large assets cause back pain? Well, they were right.\"\n\n\"Deals so good I'll [$$!$] myself! ...Sorry, just had a minor stroke!\"\n\nDuring a Blood Moon:\n\n\"I'm gonna make some Bloody Marys to relax, celery included. Want one?\"\n\n\"If you're too lazy to craft potions normally, try Blood Orbs. Blood is fuel, dumbass.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to not be bitchy tonight, but it's hard when everyone else won't shut up.\"\n\nDuring a Party:\n\n\"You'll always find me at parties where booze is involved... well, you'll always find BOOZE where I'M involved!\"\n\nWhile any bosses are alive:\n\n\"Why are you talking to me right now? Shouldn't you be bumbling around and dying for my amusement?\"\n\nDuring the Martian Madness event:\n\n\"You should probably deal with those ayy lmaos before anything else, but whatever.\"\n\nIf Cryogen has been defeated:\n\n\"God I can't wait to smash some ice again! ...For drinks, of course.\"\n\nIf Leviathan and Anahita has been defeated:\n\n\"How could you murder such a beautiful creature!? ...The blue sexy one, not the obese cucumber.\"\n\nIf the Moon Lord has been defeated:\n\n\"Ever wondered why the Moon Lord needed so many tentacles? Uh... on second thought, I won't answer that.\"\n\nDuring the Acid Rain event:\n\n\"I'm melting! Put a stop to this inclement weather this instant before it ruins my hair!\"\n\nIf Polterghast has been defeated:\n\n\"I saw a ghost down by the old train tracks back at my homeland once, flailing wildly at the lily pads... frightening times those were.\"\n\nIf The Devourer of Gods has been defeated:\n\n\"I hear it's amazing when the famous Devourer of Gods out in flap-jaw space, with the tuning fork, does a raw blink on Hara-kiri rock. I need scissors! 61!\"\n\nIf the Stylist is present:\n\n\"You can't stop me from trying to move in with [Name of Stylist]\"\n\n\"I love it when [Name of Stylist]'s hands get sticky from all that... wax.\"\n\n\"[Name of Stylist] works wonders for my hair... among other things.\"\n\n\"Ever since [Name of Stylist] moved in I haven't been drinking as much... a strange but not unwelcome feeling.\"\n\n\"[Name of Stylist] helped me learn to accept my past. It's been rough, but I think I'm on the right track now.\"\n\n\"Might go out for a jog later with [Name of Stylist]. Nice day for it.\"\n\n\"I should watch some movies with [Name of Stylist] tonight. You could come too, but only if you bring snacks for us.\"\n\nIf the Tavernkeep is present:\n\n\"I've had to tell baldie where my eyes are so many times that I've lost count.\"\n\n\"Tell [Name of Tavernkeep] to stop calling me. He's not wanted.\"\n\n\"My booze will always be better than [Name of Tavernkeep]'s, and nobody can convince me otherwise.\"\n\nIf the Archmage is present:\n\n\"I never realized how well-endowed [Name of Archmage] was. It had to be the largest icicle I'd ever seen.\"\n\nIf the Brimstone Witch is present:\n\n\"The abuse [Name of Brimstone Witch] went through is something I can hardly comprehend. I'd offer her a drink, but I don't think she'd enjoy it.\"\n\nIf the player has the Chibii Devourer equipped:\n\n\"The hell is that? Looks like something I'd carry around if I was 5 years old.\"\n\nIf the player has the Aquatic Heart equipped:\n\n\"Nice scales... is it hot in here or is it just me?\"\n\nIf the player has the Fab debuff:\n\n\"Do you like my vodka? I created it by mixing fairy dust, crystallized cave sweat and other magical crap.\"\n\nIf the player is riding the Alicorn mount:\n\n\"So... you found my special bottle. Hope you enjoy it, I know I will.\"\n\n\"Be sure to dismount me once in a while, I get tired. And besides, I can't rip you off-I mean offer you excellent deals you won't find anywhere else if you're riding me 24/7.\"\n\n\"Before you ask, no, I do NOT have a heart on my butt while in human form. Don't question my transformation preferences!\"\n\nDeath Dialogue:\n\nIf the player has died 100 times: \"Consider lowering the difficulty. If you found that statement irritating, good.\"\n\nIf the player has died 250 times: \"I admire your tenacity. Keep it up, your enemies are racking up quite the kill count!\"\n\nIf the player has died 500 times: \"Your inability to avoid dying to even the most basic of attacks is astonishing to me.\"\n\nIf the player has died 1000 times: \"It is said the average Terrarian has a lifespan of 2 minutes or less. ...Well, not really, but I feel like you'd be part of that statistic.\"\n\nIf the player has died 2500 times: \"Bless your heart. I could dodge better than you even if I were drunk high.\"\n\nIf the player has died 5000 times: \"I'm not sure what to say this time. That you're bad and should feel bad? That much was known already.\"\n\nIf the player has died 10,000 times: \"Congratulations! You are now, officially, the biggest loser in Terraria's history! Who was number two? Hell if I know.\""
