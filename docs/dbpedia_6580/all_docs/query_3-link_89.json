Like the great Princess Booky herself, I find great satisfaction in seeing that thing marked as complete on time. It’s why being an achievement hunter in video games is compelling for me: I have goals and I’m often willing to tough it out through the longest, most frustrating tasks in the name of getting all of them. I like progress.\n\nWhich is why I’m always disappointed when a Thursday doesn’t fall on a review week. There was a time years ago when I was doing these every week, ten stories at a time. Every Thursday, like clockwork. It meant I could go into my schedule and clear another week off of it and start a new one. It meant I was moving forward. Then I switched to a ‘by wordcount’ method instead, because I could feel the burnout coming and knew I needed to start pacing myself better. Then I switched to today’s ten-per-blog-every-second-week structure, because again, I felt like reading for these review blogs was taking up too much of my daily life.\n\nWith the current structure, I feel like I’ve finally hit a reading balance I can sustain. Well, except in the past couple months,but that’s because of something big I’ve got planned in early October giving me more to read. In general though, I’m a lot happier with how much I read these days, finding it neither over- nor underwhelming. And that’s great!\n\nWhat isn’t great is that every other Thursday I see I’m not posting any reviews. Which feels wrong. It feels like I’m not making any progress. That’s not true, I know it’s not. I think I just got so used to doing this weekly that even now, many months after going to the two-week system, I feel like I’m being lazy.\n\nThis isn’t leading to anything. I’m not about to announce a return to the weekly system. It’s just something that struck me this past week and I felt like talking about it. Let you guys see a little into my head this time around.\n\nAlright, I’ve abused my blog-wide post on this stuff enough for one day. Let’s get to what we’re all really here for: the reviews! I need to get my progress on.\n\nStories for This Week:\n\nDash Wants A Cookie by Serina\n\nFluttershy Digs Deep by MagicS\n\nStarry Darling by Climaclysm\n\nEver After Never Came by Thunderbug80\n\n4 Seasons by Norwegian boy\n\nWings Of Vigor by Golden Fang Ryu Shenron\n\nDinner With Her Family by chillbook1\n\nThe Galaxy And The Butterfly Who Loved It by Frost Flower\n\nTrixie's Best Fanfiction Ever by Spider8ite\n\nYou Should Meet My Son by Vivid Syntax\n\nTotal Word Count: 141,561\n\nRating System\n\nWhy Haven't You Read These Yet?: 0\n\nPretty Good: 2\n\nWorth It: 4\n\nNeeds Work: 4\n\nNone: 0\n\nIt’s Hearth’s Warming Eve and Rarity has invited Rainbow Dash to come by her place to watch cheesy “Hearthsmark” movies and chill. Also, Rainbow wants cookies.\n\nWell. That was… pointless?\n\nI couldn’t really ‘get’ this one. You first have to assume that Rainbow Dash would actually enjoy Hallmark Christmas movies, which has got to be a joke unto itself. If you can get past that hurdle, then you have to accept that there’s no purpose to the story. No theme, no moral, not even a bit of fluff. It’s just Rainbow Dash trying to sneak-eat cookies while watching Hallmark movies with Rarity. Why is she even trying to be sneaky about it? What, does she think the cookies weren’t made for the express purpose of being eaten?\n\nI mean, the author could have at least made it so Rarity always knew and was being sneaky back by preventing Rainbow from getting any cookies, at least that’s playful and provides a kind of insight into their relationship. Heck, there could have been a theme about how Rainbow hates Hallmark movies but figures they’re okay with a friend. Then there would have been a sense of character development.\n\nBut no. Rainbow sneak-eats cookies for no reason, Rarity is oblivious, Rainbow goes home full of cookies and somehow not thinking about how lame Hallmark movies are, the end.\n\nI suppose if you like your stories to be complete nothing-burgers, then this might be okay for you. For me, it was… well, a nothing-burger.\n\nBookshelf: Needs Work\n\nPrevious stories reviewed for this author:\n\nNew Author!\n\nAngel Bunny is missing! After talking to all of her animal friends, Fluttershy finally discovers that Angel literally fell through a hole in the earth. The most obvious and intelligent thing to do would be to get help, so Fluttershy choses to dive in and find him on her own! If only she realized how dangerous that was…\n\nI’m tempted to make an Alice in Wonderland reference, but meh, too easy.\n\nThis story is exactly what it looks like: Fluttershy going on a subterranean adventure in search of her missing bunny. At the start all this means is long descriptions of the different kinds of tunnels she explores, some of which have really weird and magical features; massive geodes, mirror-caves where you have to do everything upside down and backwards to proceed, and singing mushrooms, just to name a few. Eventually Fluttershy will cross paths with some friends: Amethyst Star, Maud Pie, and a unicorn named Daylight. I thought Daylight was an OC, but given the “Other” tag she might be a background pony.\n\nWhy are Maud, Amethyst, and Daylight joining Fluttershy in this adventure? Well… if you go by what the story says, it’s because they all fell into a hole in the ground and have been lost for ages in the caverns and tunnels. Which, considering Angel got down there the same way, implies that there is something broader going on that is causing these sinkholes to form around Ponyville. This is never addressed again though, which itself implies that MagicS reached a point where they got tired of writing Fluttershy all alone and pulled an excuse out of their butts to get more characters involved in the journey. I suppose only MagicS knows the truth, but it seems fishy.\n\nThe story is decent enough, I suppose. It’s very… “friendship is magic”. Yes, I’m omitting the caps for a reason. Point is, there are no villains, ponies (and other creatures) break into song regularly, there’s almost no true danger to speak of, and what danger we do have is largely whitewashed or resolved in a highly contrived manner. Fluttershy getting hungry? Have a convenient cave full of yummy flowers to snack on. Headlamp going out? Let’s throw in a unicorn character who specializes in light-based magic. Someone just came along and started trouble? It was just a misunderstanding, easily resolved with a simple chat and maybe a song.\n\nFluttershy will not grow. She will not make some profound discovery about herself and/or the world and go on to teach it to others. Ditto for all the other characters. They just go on an adventure together, end of story. The most character growth I could identify for our MCs is that Amethyst and Daylight start off fighting like cats and dogs and have stopped that entirely by the end.\n\nNow, if all you’re looking for is a simple adventure, that might be fine for you. But in my case, I feel like something more is necessary to make this shine. Wouldn’t it be neat if Fluttershy, who at the start of the story denied being a good leader or hero type, learned she could be every bit the team leader that Twilight or Applejack or Rarity are? What if Amethyst Star, who spends much of the story claiming to be bad luck and generally crummy at adventuring, came into her own and discovered her niche as an adventurer in her own right? What if Daylight could evolve from a permanent cynic and realistic into a true believer of Friendship is Magic? And Maud…\n\nI got nothing for Maud. She’s already awesome. As she was here. She was also the comedic highlight of the story.\n\nStill, if you’re not looking for such things as character growth or subtext or thematic messaging and just want to see Fluttershy go on some adventure all her own, then maybe this will be in your ballpark. Just don’t go in expecting anything deep (pun not intended) and you’ll be fine.\n\nBookshelf: Worth It\n\nPrevious stories reviewed for this author:\n\nNew Author!\n\nFilly Starlight made a mistake. Now her parents must discuss what to do about it.\n\nThis story focuses on Starlight’s parents, Firelight and Bright Glint, who are currently in disagreement over how to discipline their extremely powerful little filly who just melted some other foal’s toy. Firelight is convinced that Starlight understands what she did was wrong and will be more careful in the future. Bright Glint isn’t so sure about that. Either way, they need to be very careful with their daughter.\n\nThis is a Show-heavy story, yet manages to be a little deep too. We watch Firelight and Bright Glint discuss their differing views and realize that Firelight doesn’t quite get the danger, as much as he insists he does. Then there’s that moment when Bright Glint talks to Starlight. We – and she – quickly realize that Firelight’s view of Starlight as his good little filly is by no means accurate. How do you balance the necessary control of a potentially dangerous child without completely ruining their childhood? And on top of all that, we also have the hinting of something very wrong with Glint as well, albeit less in the moral manner and more in the health way.\n\nIn other words, this story does a lot with the short wordcount, and does so by utilizing the strengths of Show-style storytelling. Climaclysm doesn’t need to explain anything; they trust the reader to see the clues being thrown around by the (delightfully real) conversations at hand. I tip my metaphorical hat to the author for managing to pull this off so well.\n\nBookshelf: Pretty Good\n\nPrevious stories reviewed for this author:\n\nNew Author!\n\nIt’s been a year since Pinkie last came to the human world to bring laughter and smiles to a little girl who needed it. A whole year, but at last she’s recovered enough to make the journey again. This time she’s meeting with Jesse, an old man so crotchety he makes Cranky Doodle look like Fluttershy. This man has a wall of steel around his heart, and Pinkie isn’t sure if she can ever break through to find out what’s wrong.\n\nArgh, thems be my feels, author!\n\nThis story clarifies things from the last one, namely that Pinkie Pie isn’t taking these jaunts to the “real world” just because she feels like it. No, Celestia is specifically calling on her to perform a task. One must wonder what The Mare’s end game is with this sort of thing, and if the rest of the Mane Six are getting similar tasks in the human world. Did Celestia send Pinkie to Jesse specifically, or did Pinkie stumble upon him? The circumstances suggest the former, which raises plenty of questions on its own.\n\nWhen the story begins, it feels like a continuation of the prior one only in that it’s set in the same AU and Pinkie is doing the same kind of task for someone new. Then you get to the ending, things come full circle, and… ouch. It was tensely emotional, more so if you’ve read the prior story. That being said, I can’t imagine Pinkie won’t have some questions and some choice words for Celestia when she gets back to Equestria.\n\nAside from being a reflection of something the author went through in real life, the story shines a spotlight on how society and modern medicine treat our elderly and infirm. There’s this unpleasant sense that the doctor treating Jesse means well but is also missing a key element in caring for him. I wouldn’t call it damning so much as… eye-opening. It really feels like Jesse could have been treated better, both from his doctor and from his family.\n\nAnother strong, emotional tale that fits with its predecessor perfectly. You definitely need to read Imaginary though in order to get the full effect.\n\nBookshelf: Pretty Good!\n\nPrevious stories reviewed for this author:\n\nAllure — Pretty Good\n\nHalf-Minute Horses — Pretty Good\n\nIf Only In My Dreams — Pretty Good\n\nImaginary — Pretty Good\n\nPrincess Luna and the Cotton Candy Sugar Rush — Worth It\n\n*I don’t have any record of who requested this, but it was in my requests list. It’s entirely possible I accidently put it in the wrong list. That or I made a mistake in my system. If anyone out there wants to claim credit, feel free.\n\nOne day during an intense winter storm, Applejack thinks she sees somepony lost outside. She heads out only to get lost herself, but is soon rescued by Wintres, the Alicorn of Winter. Only one problem: nopony believes that there even is an Alicorn of Winter. And then, of course, three more alicorns show up…\n\nI’m sure it’s obvious, but this story is all about the alicorns of the seasons. The alicorns are, oh-so imaginatively, named Wintres, Springs, Summers, and Autumns. Turns out they once bore the Elements of Harmony with Celestia and Luna, but when Luna went all Nightmare Moon it created a rift amongst them and the four sisters ended up going their separate ways. Now they’re back together for the first time in a thousand years, and while none of them agree on too much they all have one opinion in common: Celestia is a total bitch.\n\nI have come to assume that Norwegian boy’s pen name is factual and we are, indeed, dealing with an ESL (English Second Language) writer. Simply put, the grammar is Terrible, and yes, that capital ‘T’ is warranted. The very first paragraph:\n\nIt was a cold even in Equestria, happy heart’s warming day has just ended. Everypony had celebrated with their love once and at Sweet apple acres the apple had celebrated with each other. Applejack was sitting on the couch in the living the living room with a cup that had hot chocolate in her hooves, outside it was terrified storm and Applejack was glad she was inside.\n\nYeah, high-quality writing this is not. But – and again assuming the ESL situation – I don’t think it’s fair to be overly critical of someone who doesn’t quite have the language down. If anything, I applaud them for using storytelling as a method of practicing. So I’ll try not to be too hard on Norwegian boy for their poor grasp of English. That said, I won’t blame anyone if that first paragraph makes them close the window.\n\nWhat of the story? Well… there are certain logical fallacies that plague it from start to finish. I have two stellar examples. First:\n\n“Yes, I know. They are with Spike, I think they are at Sugarcube corner.”\n\nThat got Wintres attention. “You mean that all my sisters are her in Ponyville?”\n\nTwo minutes later…\n\n“So, what would you like to ask about Twilight Sparkle?”\n\n“Well, your little sister told me that you don’t know your parents. Is that right?”\n\nWintres stopped, so did Twilight. “Hold on, you have talk to Springs and Autumns?” Twilight nodded. “When?”\n\nTwo minutes later…\n\n“That’s good, I was wondering where Spike had… Wait a minute, did you say your three sisters?” Twilight said while walking after her.\n\n“Yes, I said three sisters. Autumns, Springs and Summers. They are all here.”\n\nSo, to be clear, that’s three times that Twilight Sparkle and Wintres discuss Wintres’s sisters, and each time one of them acts as if the revelation of these sisters is a shock. This is all within the span of about 800 words, mind you. Did Norwegian boy write these three points days apart from one another and forget that the topic has already been addressed? Twice?\n\nExample two:\n\n“Alright Summers.” Luna stepped off her. “I don’t like it, but I believe you. If you are telling the truth, then my sister sent me to moon against my will. The question is why she did it and you do not know why.”\n\nWaitwaitwaitwait wait. Hold up. “Against my will”? Obviously it was against her will! The argument going on doesn’t even have anything to do with that! Where the heck is this “against my will” stuff coming from? She was Nightmare Moon, she was trying to conquer Equestria, why would her willingness to be banished even come into consideration? It’s not like Celestia and Nightmare Moon sat down over tea and crumpets and had a casual discussion over whether Nightmare preferred banishment or a nice stay in the gardens as a lawn ornament.\n\nThose are just two examples of an issue that is rampant with this story. Logic in general – to say nothing of cause and effect or narrative consistency – is a constant struggle. How is it Wintres can claim in one sentence to have not talked to anyone for a thousand years and in the next note that she needs to go shopping again because her fridge is nearly empty? Yes, Wintres, the Alicorn of Winter, has a modern refrigerator that she would have had to purchase from a store with funds she somehow managed to acquire (assuming she can’t just magic them into existence), but she hasn’t talked to a soul in a thousand years. Clearly, the company that built that fridge is either out of business due to their products never needing replacement or are now operating a planned obsolescence scam on the Equestrian population.\n\nStill, there is a story developing here. It largely involves the four sisters realizing that Celestia somehow planned Nightmare Moon’s banishment. I know, the immediate thought is “well, yeah, she was Nightmare Moon”. But it appears to go deeper than that. Three of the four sisters rejected the very idea of banishing NMM and blamed Celestia for her taking over Luna at all, and the fourth comes to believe that Celestia might have planned NMM’s arrival in the first place. Celestia herself is not looking like a rose, especially when she tells Twilight Sparkle to her face that there are no alicorns of the seasons and willingly jeopardizes their relationship in order to maintain the lie even after Luna tells Twilight the truth.\n\nAs far as the four sisters are concerned, this reeks of a coverup with Celestia trying to wipe all evidence of their existence from history. To be fair, it’s entirely possible Celestia just believes they are dead, but if that’s the case then why openly reject Luna’s word? Why not admit that they were, at one point at least, alive and an important part of Equestrian history? This makes for a genuinely interesting mystery, even if it relies on Celestia acting completely OOC at times. The only major problem is that with Norwegian boy’s questionable grasp on plot logic I’m not sure we can trust any of the things we’re seeing to make any sense in relation to what is really going on.\n\nI do like the manner of the four alicorns though. I got the impression Norwegian boy was going for an ‘aging with the year’ method for their characters. Thus Springs is childish and silly, Summers is trying to be mature but often behaves like a melodramatic teenager, Autumn is trying to be the adult in the room but a little bumbling, and Wintres is the wise matriarch. While I would by no means call it an original or new take, it works well as presented. I’m not sure where the author is going with this “secret fifth alicorn of the Everfree Forest” thing, especially after it’s been clearly established that Celestia’s and Luna’s mother was named Gaia and isn’t this mysterious mare so it’s probably not some all-seasons nature alicorn. Do we even need a fifth alicorn at this point when the four we’ve been given should be interesting enough on their own?\n\nI digress. Ultimately, we will probably never know what’s really going on because Norwegian boy canceled the story in an apparent bout of bitterness stemming from a lack of feedback. Which… You know, I get it. Nothing’s quite so demoralizing as the feeling that nobody cares. I also took a closer look at the author’s library and blogs and realized that they’ve improved their grammar by leaps and bounds since this was first released in 2018. However, their library consists almost entirely of incomplete, longer stories. I can’t imagine that’s good for their morale. I would recommend they try their hand at shorter stories, which can serve as solid practice, provide the author with a certain sense of accomplishment, and give potential new readers something to chew on. Not many readers out there want to start a story they know will never be finished, and a reputation for never finishing what you start is going to be a big turn off.\n\nThis author has nearly 900,000 words in their library. They clearly have an interest in being a writer. If they can just channel that energy properly and stop getting crushed by the small audience of the modern day, they may be able to make something worthwhile. I hope they write and finish something shorter soon so that I may read it and get a measure of their development.\n\nI don’t usually rate incomplete stories, but as this one is canceled I think I can make an exception for it. And yes, the rating is low, but I still hope the author will be encouraged to keep going and maybe take their methods in a different direction. I’d hate to see someone with this much experience and interest behind them just disappear due to discouragement.\n\nBookshelf: Needs Work\n\nPrevious stories reviewed for this author:\n\nNew Author!\n\nEmerald Fang fights wolf monsters outside his home.\n\nSo. Golden Fang. I’mma just call you that instead of writing out the whole thing every time. I imagine you’re wondering why this story has no ratings, few views, and your only commentator was a blatantly obvious bot (at the time of writing). I may have an idea. Your cover page has no character tag outside “OC” – already a hindrance when there are no faces readers are familiar with. The story description tells the readers absolutely nothing regarding what the story is about, and the cover art means nothing at all to your uninformed audience. In short, there’s nothing that tells the reader “hey, this might be an interesting read!”\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with having an OC-only story, but the rest of your front page better be a banger if it’s going to gain any attention. I would recommend using cover art that doesn’t require your readers to understand the symbology of your AU before they’ve been introduced to the AU in the first place, and that your story blurb actually tells readers what the story is about rather than being some anonymous declaration of commitment to an unspecified cause nobody knows or cares about.\n\nThen, of course, we open the story and the very first thing we see is an Author’s Note that essentially says “I can’t take the pain sooo do not comment or I will delete it!” No, you didn’t say that in so many words, but when you tell people they’re not allowed to nitpick and any negative comments may be interpreted as ‘being biased’ you’re not putting yourself in the best of light.\n\nReally, that entire author’s note needs to go. The important stuff – that this is an AU and will be the first part in something bigger – belongs on the front page. The details – planned number of protagonists and their racial makeup, the location the story is set in, even the trigger warning – are either unnecessary or counterproductive. Stop trying to overcomplicate things. All we need at this point is the story. Let it speak for itself!\n\nAnd finally – finally! – we get to the story. It’s about a random pegasus in some random town outside Equestria who fights, uh, possessed wolves, I think? Which he does by transforming himself into a… were-tiger? Maybe? But only after they’ve broken two of his legs (the humorous is not part of the shoulder, author. Even in horses). Somehow, having two legs out of operation doesn’t prevent him from going ape and defeating a bunch of wolves five-to-one. Then he goes home to his family, who are more interested in having tea and discussing their plans for the day rather than tending to their apparent flesh and blood who has two broken bones.\n\nAlready, we can see that Golden Fang isn’t interested in such things as realism. nb4 “it’s called fantasy!”: I’m not complaining about Emerald Fang’s transformation abilities or the fact he’s fighting possessed wolves. I’m complaining because we’re expected to believe that he didn’t bother to use his trump card until after he was too injured to possibly fight back, and that he could do so effectively regardless. Yes, there is such a thing as letting the protagonist get hurt to give a story a sense of danger, but if you don’t temper that by keeping things realistic then it becomes less engaging and more eye-rolling.\n\nThen we get to the awkwardness of the writing itself, which leans on Tell like a crutch, says way more than it needs to, and has a lot of awkward phrasing and missteps. I find myself wondering if Golden Fang isn’t an ESL writer; some of the errors do suggest it.\n\n“Was Dad suffering?” “Yes, but he tried to hide it.” “Ah. Then I won’t bring it up either. Now let me talk about it at length.”\n\n“Oh, you’re reading in the middle of the night. Just doing it to pass the time?” No, lady, he’s got a book report due tomorrow. What do you think?\n\n“Are you enjoying your book?”\n\n“More than I thought. [...] I’m still on the first one but I’m almost through it since it’s shorter than the second.”\n\nWait, so he read the second book of whatever series he’s reading first?\n\n“What do you like most about it?”\n\n“How alike me and the protagonist are,” I explained. “He’s experiencing a dark road, but he keeps going no matter how bad it gets. He just endured trial after trial and never wavered even when it seemed like he was at the end of his rope. He reminds me of myself in that way… and what I set out to do.”\n\nGolden Fang, if you’re trying to give us an idea of who your protagonist is, this isn’t doing what you probably meant it to. All this is doing is making Emerald Fang look high on his own possibly mythical self-sacrifice. We don’t need characters literally telling us “I’m a complex and edgy character!” for us to get that they’re a complex and edgy character. And Evelyne’s response—\n\n“Is that so? He must be quite a complex character to connect with him in such a way,”\n\n—isn’t doing any better, unless she’s trying to mock him and I missed it. After the dialogue he spouted, I feel he’d deserve some good mocking.\n\n“Sure thing,” I said as she went in the direction of my kitchen. “And… Eve?”\n\nShe stopped at hearing me say her nickname. The same one I hadn’t used since I was sixteen.\n\nThis is what I mean by saying more than you need to. You only needed two words: “She stopped.” That’s it, we’re done, the point has been made. You don’t need to tell us “Eve” is a nickname, we don’t need to know that he said it because the last paragraph made that obvious, and his age when things went to shit could be alluded to later when he goes to the statue.\n\nSpeaking of the statue, there was also no need to go into detail about how Emerald Fang’s mother died. Indeed, that entire flashback served no purpose. We already knew she died, you’d made it abundantly clear earlier in the story that he witnessed her death, and his obsession with these “feralin” is more than enough to clarify that they’re the ones responsible. All the flashback is doing is repeating things that the audience has already inferred.\n\nSpeaking of the feralin, make up your mind with them. “I’m going to kill them all!” “Oh, I don’t hate or blame them. They’re victims too.” “But I’m still gonna kill them all!” Which is it, author? Or are you trying to imply that Emerald Fang is insane and doesn’t know his own mind?\n\nThen there’s the attempts to sound complex and deep.\n\nI gave no response to her request. I didn’t need to, for the look inside my viridescent orbs conveyed she could rely on me to uphold it.\n\nAuthor, stop it. You do it a lot. Using Big Words™ and non-regular sentence patterns doesn’t make things better. Even if this is a part of your regular vocabulary, I guarantee you it isn’t for 99% of your audience. It will either kill immersion as they fail to get the meaning (and maybe go scrambling for a dictionary) or, worse, they’ll think you’re using a thesaurus in a desperate attempt to look intelligent. Variety is good, but there’s no need to overcomplicate your sentences and vocabulary.\n\nI digress. The point is that this story is struggling on several fronts, starting with a cover page with no hook and ending with a story that doesn’t seem to know how to do what it is aiming for. Author, just let the story be. Emerald Fang doesn’t need to tell us what kind of character he is. His visiting the memorial to his mother and then fighting the feralins is more than enough to get the point of his character across, without all the flashbacks and interrupting tangents. Let the events do the talking for you, and your readers will understand the intent.\n\nAt the time of me writing this review, the story is already two months old. By the time the review comes out, it’ll be six months old. That’s far too late for any changes you may make to matter; the chance for this story to be seen by the most people is long gone. But I urge you to take this review into consideration with any future stories, in this franchise or another, and be better prepared. Good luck.\n\nBookshelf: Needs Work\n\nPrevious stories reviewed for this author:\n\nNew Author!\n\nPrincess Twilight Sparkle has been hanging out in the human world so as to keep an eye on the Dazzlings. At first. Now she’s dating Sonata, which brings about its own slew of issues. For example, when Sunset Shimmer connives with Adagio to arrange for Twilight to have dinner at the Dazzlings’ place. Now Twilight’s stuck “officially” meeting Sonata’s sisters for the very first time, and neither of them are sure they’re ready for that.\n\nThis one was at once odd and cute. Odd, in that a lot of the logistics behind this relationship are ignored with the sort of casualness you’d expect from a kid trying to hide candy wrappers under a rug. Why the heck is Princess Twilight attending CHS? What about literally anything at all about Equestria, in which she’s supposed to be, y’know, an important figure? What about all her Equestria friends, her responsibilities, her little brother… her entire life? Aside from a few casual mentions, chillbrook1 treats these subjects as if they are entirely irrelevant.\n\nAt the same time, it is indeed rather cute. Sonata is the same silly girl you typically see in the fandom (complete with the woeful obsession with tacos that stems from a single throwaway line the fandom has nonsensically become obsessed with). Twilight is as adorkable as ever, and still perfectly capable of Twilighting in embarrassing situations. And since she’s meeting Adagio, embarrassing situations are guaranteed.\n\nIt’s curious to me that Aria gets pointed out as “the often-overlooked siren”. I guess chillbrook1 mistakenly pays her little attention. Still, her antagonistic manner through most of the story fits well with the common fandom perspective of her. Adagio was the standout though, owing to her being in full Mamadagio mode for this story without losing an ounce of her delightfully playful wickedness. Her interactions with Sunset Shimmer are wonderful, even if they are never shown in the same room together in-story.\n\nThe bet is the oddest part in all of this, though, and it makes me question if chillbrook1 even knows how bets work. I mean, usually you make a bet to do something embarrassing if you lose said bet. But Sunset makes a bet with Twilight that she’ll do said embarrassing thing if she wins the bet. It makes no sense whatsoever and I don’t have a clue why the author went this route.\n\nA cute but decidedly weird story, with a combination of things that make no sense, important facts blatantly omitted, but held together by an endearing visit with the generally endearing (Aria: “Meh.”) Dazzlings as they grill Sonata’s nerdy, dorky girlfriend. If that sounds appealing to you, knock yourself out. I certainly had fun, though I came away with many questions.\n\nBookshelf: Worth It\n\nPrevious stories reviewed for this author:\n\nMother — Pretty Good\n\nThe Alicorn Curse — Worth It\n\nFluttershy is in love, but she knows with absolute certainty that she never stood a chance. Now Rarity is there, trying to encourage her, trying to get to the root of the problem, trying to understand what holds Fluttershy back. She wants to help, but there’s no helping the helpless.\n\nWhen this started, I thought maybe Fluttershy was in love with a mare who was already taken. But no, her problem is entirely self-inflicted: she’ll never earn Twilight’s affections because she has convinced herself that she will never, ever measure up to her.\n\nIt’s a quietly traumatic thing. The only thing holding Fluttershy back is Fluttershy herself, a symptom of her crushing sense of inadequacy and endless self-criticisms. Rarity does what any good friend would do and tries to remind Fluttershy of how wonderful a pony she is. She can’t understand what it is like to be Fluttershy, to simply know things about yourself against all reasoning and encouragement.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a sadfic. It’s a story that understands the struggle of self-defeatism and the seemingly impenetrable wall it creates. Sadficionados will love it. The broader audience… eh, I’d say it’s hit or miss. Possibly more ‘miss’ with the typos that are just a little too common to be acceptable, assuming you care about that kind of thing.\n\nBookshelf: Worth It\n\nPrevious stories reviewed for this author:\n\nSimple Gestures — Pretty Good\n\nOne day Trixie notices her girlfriend writing something. Intrigued, she decides to write something as well. She could use a new hobby, and if Twilight can do it then so can she! Now her masterpiece is complete! If only Twilight Sparkle would recognize it as such.\n\nI’ll admit it, I only read this because that cover art is adorable. I was tempted to write Spider8ite off from my list of authors to further explore on account of none of their work being that good so far and their permanent ban from the site meaning we won’t get anymore anyway, but then I saw Trixie being so delightfully Trixie and was like, “okay, one more time...”\n\nThe story is short and simple: Trixie decided to write a self-insert about her being Powerful and Great, defeating Twilight Sparkle Dusk Shine, and facing off against a red and black OP OC. Her girlfriend gives it a read and has some… pointers. Twilight’s patience is impressive. Less so her ability to lie to Trixie’s face about it being ‘great’ even while she tries to tell her that it could be, er, ‘improved’. Then they snuggle, the end.\n\nSimple, and by no means ‘deep’. I suppose there’s nothing wrong with the events, but Spider8ite’s writing leaves something to be desired, as always. The grammar is questionable at best, and if you care about how a story is written you likely won’t get very far. There’s also no clear reason for Twilight and Trixie to be in a relationship, and given the depiction of both characters here I feel that’s a big problem; it’s a case of the characters seeming to only be together because the author declared it is so.\n\nNot a great story, but by no means the worst I’ve seen by this author. Heck, if their writing style was better this might have even landed on one of my higher shelves. As it is, I only recommend it if you’re really into the Twixie ship, enough so to forgive the poor writing.\n\nBookshelf: Needs Work\n\nPrevious stories reviewed for this author:\n\nMegalomaniac — Worth It\n\nA Walk by the Hills — Needs Work\n\nInner Demons — Needs Work\n\nSunburst goes to visit Stellar Flare for Mother’s Day, glad he can finally do so without her trying to manipulate his every move. But Stellar’s not quite done trying to ‘help out’ as he had hoped. She wants grandfoals, and she’s wrangled a significant amount of… “help” to get them.\n\nThis could be an episode of the show, were the show ever willing to address sexual topics. It’s one big joke in which Sunburst finds himself being literally chased by an entire town (mares and stallions) who have all been convinced by his mother that he’s the most eligible bachelor in Equestria. It’s more than a little over the top, complete with cameos from the spa twins, Moondancer, Braeburn, and the lone “not interested” pony in town, Tree Hugger.\n\nHonestly, my favorite part was at the library when the story spoofed horror via Stellar Flare’s mysterious disappearance and ghostly voice encouraging her son to just give in to the bounty she’d arranged for him. But eh, I’m a horror guy, of course that tickled me.\n\nA silly, fun story written just for laughs. Make sure you’re not taking anything about it seriously and you might enjoy it.\n\nBookshelf: Worth It\n\nPrevious stories reviewed for this author:\n\nFor When It Rains — WHYRTY?\n\nInvoluntary — Pretty Good\n\nAlternative Title: Applejack Best Human\n\nJacklyn Malus has been through a lot for a thirteen year old, and that tends to mature a person quickly. Most wouldn’t guess she’s so young. With most of her immediate family deceased, she and her two siblings now have to live with their cantankerous, long-alienated grandfather Henry Orbis. As much as she butts heads with the old fart, living in Downbeat’s not so bad. At least she’s got some new friends, even if they’re all weirdos. If only she could figure out what her grandfather’s so angry about or, better yet, understand why a scorpion is talking to her.\n\nYes, a scorpion.\n\nThe originalfication of KorenCZ11’s Star Overhead continues! Those of you familiar with my reviews of this series so far know that the main story focuses on not-Twilight Sparkle Dawn Hibana, whose life got turned upside down when a biker queen literally flew in on a motorcycle, cracked her over the head with a guitar, and now lives in her home. Each book has focused on a different main character and taught us different things about the universe the story is set in, a music-themed fantasy world. Thus far we’ve had Dawn trying not to accept that not-Celestia Solei is her secret, long-lost biological mother and one of the god-queens of her world, juvenile delinquent not-Rainbow Dash Rebecca Caelum discovering how her father was directly involved in her mother’s death, not-Rarity Amethyst Treasure reconnecting with her superspy mother and uncovering the cause of her parents’ divorce, and closet nymph not-Fluttershy Shyanne Papillion coming to terms with her over-the-top sex drive. The books all seem to relate to or are themed around some aspect of puberty and growing up.\n\nWhich brings us to Jacklyn Malus (I see what you did there). Jacklyn is mature, straightforward, and honest even when the truth hurts. She’s the second strongest mage in school (second only to Dawn, and only barely), and she is exceptionally responsible considering her age. But Jacklyn is also suffering. Her mother died giving birth to her little sister, and she has to constantly remind herself that it is not Alice’s fault. Her father died being a hero. Her grandmother died of grief. And now she’s stuck on this pear farm, trying to survive a grim old veteran who keeps confusing her for his daughter and is always angry about something.\n\nAnd then the villain enters the story. Which is a big deal, because up until this point Star Overhead had no villain. I mean, you could argue that Solei held the role for a while since nobody was sure what she was doing and she’s certainly a manipulative, crafty sort, but her exact goals and motivations have always been highly questionable. Now, we have someone new, and he is, clearly and undeniably, a villain.\n\nNow we have Discord. *cough* Sorry; now we have Seth Bacchus.\n\nThis story focuses largely on the MC girls getting together and trying to at last solve the great mysteries surrounding the past couple weeks of their lives. What is Solei up to? Is she really the Sun Queen? Why is she having them extract their Virtues, and should they do anything to stop it? On top of these grander mysteries are the more personal, namely: why is Jacklyn’s grandfather so angry, and is there anything they can do about it? Also: What the hell happened to not-Pinkie Poppy Stone, Dawn’s best friend, who has completely disappeared from the picture for no apparent reason?\n\nThis is easily the most complex the series has gotten, as the girls are now juggling a wide range of mysteries that all combine together into a single big one. Seth Bacchus is complicating things even more, and all of this serves as a nice distraction from whatever it is Solei’s still planning. Even though the series is technically Dawn’s story, mature, responsible Jacklyn comes out in this one as the clear leader of the girls. She shines bright as a singularly capable individual who, if Solei and Seth are to be believed, is so in-tune with her Virtue that she could potentially call upon it without any of the manipulations Solei used on the others if she only knew how.\n\nFor all the seriousness, Zachary isn’t above having a little fun with the story. For example, Amethyst downplaying all the serious issues going on to fawn over Dawn’s fashion accessories, or Shyanne making note of how not Big Mac Mark Malus will be hers even if she has to out-wait the friggin Moon Queen to get him. Let us not forget how Seth forces Jacklyn to relive a particular dream multiple times, that dream being a fiery reinterpretation of the opening scene from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Normally I might have problems with these sorts of humorous asides, but not only does the author handle them well, they’re quite necessary bits of relief from the seriousness that pervades this story.\n\nBest of all, there are finally answers. This started with the last book, Shyanne getting straight responses at last to several questions that were plaguing the series from the beginning. Jacklyn’s tale continues that trend, revealing important chunks of Aria’s history, long-held secrets of Solei’s and Luna’s pasts, and further expanding the magical lore of the world. It’s great that we’re finally seeing this; Zachary certainly kept us in the dark for long enough!\n\nThe only serious catch in all of this is the ending, which feels… anticlimactic, I suppose? Jacklyn’s good enough on her own that she needed no help at all to win the day when the final confrontation comes. When it’s over, there is no great celebration and technically no bad guys were vanquished. In fact, it’s suggested that things are about to get so much worse. I don’t blame Zachary for this; he’s made no secret that there’s going to be a book for each character, Poppy is clearly next, and the hints being dropped strongly suggest that what she’s going through is the worst of all the girls’ experiences. The fact that she’s almost completely absent from this book heavily implies that whatever is coming for hers will be big. I am very much looking forward to it, but that doesn’t change how the end of this book is underwhelming in nature.\n\nAt any rate, I enjoyed this one every bit as much as I did Shyanne’s, so Zachary is clearly doing something right. Supposedly book six will be releasing soon (in fact it’ll probably be out by the time this review publishes), and I am very much looking forward to it.\n\nBookshelf: Pretty Good\n\nStories for Next Time:\n\nMusic Machine by LockandKeyHyena\n\nStarlight, Are We Friends or Not? by Sparrow9642\n\nThe Small Hours by Estee\n\nBuggy and the Beast by Georg\n\nThe Thin Line Between Wife And Death by King of Beggars\n\nAbiyoyo by Matthew Penn\n\nDreams of You by SapphireSparks\n\nI Can Explain! by Titanium Dragon\n\nPillow Talk by Captain Unstoppable\n\nStream of Silver, Heart of Gold by RadBunny\n\nRecent Review Map:\n\nPaul's Thursday Reviews CCCLVIII - It's Showtime Edition\n\nPaul's Thursday Reviews CCCLIX\n\nPaul's Thursday Reviews CCCLX\n\nPaul's Thursday Reviews CCCLXI\n\nPaul's Thursday Reviews CCCLXII - Cold in Gardez Edition\n\nYou Are Here\n\nTBD\n\nTBD\n\nTBD\n\nTBD\n\nTBD\n\nReading Progress:\n\nRekindled Embers\n\n64.83% (519,212 / 800,873)\n\nNine Days Down\n\n46.26% (66,150 / 143,009)\n\nThe Olden World\n\n33.12% (669,269 / 2,020,718)"
