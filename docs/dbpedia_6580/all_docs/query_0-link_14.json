        "text": "Ovilus Ghost Box\n\nOvilus speaks again! The legendary Ovilus returns unleashing words from the beyond.\n\nAre you looking for the most advanced tool for spirit communication? Look no further than the Ovilus! OvilusÂ® takes spirit communication to a whole new level of information and ease. Ovilus converts environmental readings into words with ease, features and portability.\n\nFeatures of the Ovilus 5b\n\n8 modes to choose from: words, drawing, motion, proximity and more\n\nSee and hear responses with text display and audible voice\n\nFull color touch screen\n\nMultiple voices and language options\n\nLong-life rechargeable battery\n\nNEW protective case\n\nNEW red faceplate\n\nNEW molded rugged enclosure (no more 3D printing)\n\nThe Ovilus 5 is the latest innovation in ghost box technology and is designed to help investigators detect and communicate with the spirit world. It features 8 unique modes, including dictionary mode, draw mode, energy mode, phonetic mode, and proximity sensing and more, all designed to help you connect with entities in a variety of ways.\n\nNo random words were harmed (or even used) in the making of this device.\n\nThe device works by scanning through environmental readings and correlates those with a list of words and phrases, and more. Utilizing a combination of precision sensors to detect changes in the environment it allows ghosts to communicate with us precisely. As a result, the Ovilus 5 is able to convert these environmental readings into words, making it quick and easy for investigators to gather evidence during investigations.\n\nThe Ovilus Formula - The Standard for Spirit Communication\n\nOvilus has been teaching spirits what activity produces what words for almost two decades. Our own language, if you will. This long-standing formula has never changed and that codex continues in this new model. The readings-to-word system specifically chooses a word based on specific readings. As such, it has never used any kind of random generation.\n\nYou might consider the Ovilus a \"secret sauce\" that no other device can match. For over 15 years as more people have used the Ovilus, we have been essentially \"teaching\" entities what environmental changes or combinations can produce what word. As such, Ovilus will always continue this linguistic formula as a standard nomenclature exclusive to the Ovilus since inception.\n\nOvilus Modes\n\nThe Ovilus 5 is highly beneficial for investigators as it provides quick and easy access to evidence during investigations, saving investigators time and effort. It is also easy to use, making it accessible for investigators of all levels of experience.\n\nThe Ovilus is designed to supply you with many different ways to experiment: Dictionary Words, Drawing, True/False and Phonetic Mode are all designed for ITC research and experimentation. Proximity and Energy modes detect energy while Motion mode detects motion and vibration. All three screens are designed to easily visualize and understanding changes in the environment.\n\nDictionary Mode\n\nOne of the most notable features of the Ovilus 5 is its Dictionary Mode, which is specifically designed to help investigators communicate with spirits. In this mode, the device selects words from a set of dictionary words that correlate with environmental readings, creating a form of automatic writing in digital form.\n\nIn this mode, you will be able to see and hear words chosen based on environmental readings. Chosen words will be displayed immediately on the screen and an audible voice will be heard. When energy changes are detected, the magnitude of the change is used to select 1 of 2048 predefined words. This form of communication is based on the ITC theory that spirits may be able to manipulate ambient energy and associating those fluctuations with words. As such, Ovilus does not employ any form random generation.\n\nOvilus also includes a Log Mode for viewing the full list of spoken words. This mode is helpful for checking the list of words voiced during Dictionary Mode sessions.\n\nDraw Mode\n\nIn Draw Mode, the Ovilus 5 detects and converts changes in the environment into colored pixels on the screen, allowing investigators to potentially capture images a spirit might want to illustrate in their communication. Ovilus will draw blocks across the screen in colors derived from environmental readings. This mode is a different method of ITC providing a visual that have the potential show us images or pictures.\n\nEnergy Mode\n\nEnergy Mode displays a graph of EMF energy designed to detect changes in the electromagnetic field, which is believed to be a sign of spirit activity. Energy level readings will be shown in a sine wave style similar to an oscilloscope. Showing the wave allows you to visualize how dynamic energy fields are rather than only showing an averaged number like a magnetometer (EMF meter) does. While Energy Mode may appear to respond to vibration, it is actually responding static and electromagnetic field changes as it moves.\n\nMotion and Proximity Modes\n\nUtilizing the built in accelerometer this mode displays motion fluctuations enabling small movements to be visualized. Motion Mode allows you to visualize vibration and touch, a great way to detect movements such as footsteps or moving objects.\n\nThe Proximity Mode detection motion which is perfect for capturing activity in a specific area or room, allowing investigators to easily pinpoint areas of interest during an investigation. Energy levels display in a radial graph. Proximity Mode is similar to Energy Mode in the data it processes. But it allows for a different view and a proximity trigger.\n\nPhonetic Mode\n\nMaybe you want the ability to allow entities to form words not set in the dictionary. No problem. Speech is formed from a set of sounds, or phonetics. This mode allows you to gather a collection of sounds that may produce words beyond the dictionary such as names, places, slang and other languages. In Phonetic Mode there are not even predefined words - just the building blocks of speech themselves.\n\nTrue / False Mode\n\nThis mode measures energy to provide Yes/Now or True/False readout. True or False Mode is designed to create a green light based on energy readings increasing and a red light based on them decreasing. This is a quick and easy way to get simple bi-polar responses, on the fly such as Yes/No, Good/Bad, Male/Female. The opportunities are endless.\n\nSettings at Your Fingertips\n\nA Settings Mode screen allows for full control of different aspects of Ovilus. For instance, you can change the volume, mute the speaker, clear logs and set the dictionary voice to your (or the ghost's) preference. With simple touch screen functionality you can navigate easily to the settings you need at your fingertips.\n\nThe Power of Ovilus\n\nIn summary, the Ovilus 5 is an essential tool for any investigator looking to communicate with spirits during paranormal investigations with ease and clarity. With its advanced technology and user-friendly interface, the Ovilus 5 is a must-have for any serious ghost hunter.\n\nMade by GhostStop with Ovilus Inventor, Bill Chappell\n\nWe, at GhostStop, are honored and privileged to carry on the work of legendary creator and inventor, Bill Chappell. We are now manufacturing the Ovilus under Bill's direction exactly as he always has.\n\n\"For me, this passing of the torch is a chance to entrust the next generation with the technology and passion that I've been developing for so many years.\"\n\n- Bill Chappell of Digital Dowsing and Ovilus creator\n\nAnnouncement: GhostStop + Digital Dowsing\n\npress release article\n\nThis product is made right here at GhostStop.\n\nOvilusÂ® is a registered trademark of Digital Dowsing, LLC (now part of Ghost Stop, LLC)."
