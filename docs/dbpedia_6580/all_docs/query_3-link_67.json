        "text": "\"Their language doesn't translate in a literal manner, and each word has multiple meanings.\"\n\n— Cortana[1]\n\nSangheili describes multiple dialects of a language spoken by the species of the same name. Though the member species of the Covenant had their own unique languages, an advanced dialect of Sangheili, known as basic Sangheili,[2] came to serve as the lingua franca throughout the entire Covenant Empire.[3] And as such, many names of member species are derived from the Sangheili.[4] Even after the fragmentation of the Covenant, many former client species of the Covenant continue to use the Sangheili language in lieu of their native tongues; Sangheili has even replaced their native language for many.[3] A specific trade pidgin also existed within the Covenant fringe.[5]\n\nDescription[edit]\n\nText, or writing, in Sangheili appears to be mostly triangle shapes and composed almost completely of equilateral triangles. The triangular characters have been seen oriented both in the horizontal left-to-right direction and in a vertical right-to-left direction.[6]\n\nThough originating with the Sangheili, an advanced dialect of their language has come to be the Covenant lingua franca, used to connect the different races and species.[3] Curiously, in several instances of Forerunner-related terminology, the Sangheili appear to use the English translations of the original Forerunner terms, as for \"Forerunner\", \"Requiem\", \"Reclaimer\", \"Didact\", and \"Librarian\".[7][Note 1] During the San'Shyuum-Sangheili War, the San'Shyuum obtained a comprehensive understanding of the Sangheili language by brutally torturing and interrogating prisoners of war. After establishing peace with the Sangheili, the San'Shyuum of the fledgling Covenant relied on translation software built into their anti-gravity chairs to understand the language.[8] The Ussans developed in isolation from other Sangheili, and their language evolved into a different form of the Sangheili dialect. It possessed similarities to Old Sangheili,[9] but the language developed into a new dialect that could not be readily understood by the \"average\" Sangheili.[10]\n\nStructure[edit]\n\nSangheili words generally consists of simply structured syllables. Most syllables consist of a single consonant (e.g. /s/) or a consonant complex (e.g. /t͡s/) followed by a long vowel or a diphthong or in rarer cases a short vowel or a short vowel followed by \"n\". Other types of syllables include a moraic \"nn\", a short vowel, a single diphthong, a triphthong, or a long vowel. Finally, some syllables in the middle or, more commonly, at the end of their word might have their vowel component devoiced.\n\nIntonation[edit]\n\nSangheili generally seems to possess word stress, though the possibility of dialects featuring pitch accent shouldn't necessarily be excluded. Sangheili words usually possess only a primary stress with longer words sometimes possessing a secondary stress in the first syllable. The primary stress usually falls on the penult (second from last syllable). However, in many words the stress might fall on the ultima (last syllable) or antepenult (third from last syllable).\n\nPhonology[edit]\n\nThe Sangheili language includes 8 main vowels (/ä/, /ɑ/, /i/, /ɪ/, /e̞/, /ɔ/, /o/ and /u/) and 18 main consonants (/s/, /z/, /ʂ/, /ʐ/, /q/, /ɢ/, /ʈ/, /ɖ/, /f/, /b̪/, /ħ/, /j/, /ɰβ/, /ɱ/, /ɳ/, /ɴ/, /ɻ/ and /ʔ/). Three more consonants also appear in words borrowed from other Sangheili dialects or alien languages. These are /p̪/, /ɺɽ~ɭ/ and /ʋ/. In certain instances, the sounds /o̞/, /ɕ/, /ʑ/, /w/ and /ɽ/ can appear as allophones of /ɔ/, /ʂ/, /ʐ/, /ɰβ/ and /ɻ/ respectively. Furthermore, /ɯβ/ and /ʊ/ are allophones of /u/ while /ə/ can serve as allophone of /ä/ and /e̞/ when those two sounds are weakened.\n\nSangheili consonant phonemes Labiodental Alveolar Retroflex Palatal Dorsal Glottal Nasal ɱ ɳ ɴ Flap (ʋ) ( ɺɽ ~ ɭ ) Plosive (p̪) ʈ q ʔ b̪ ɖ ɢ Fricative f s ʂ [ʂ ~ ɕ] ħ z ʐ [ʐ ~ ʑ] Approximant ɻ [ɻ ~ ɽ] j ɰβ [ɰβ ~ w]\n\nSangheili vowel phonemes Non-Back Back High i u [u ~ ɯβ ~ ʊ] Near-high ɪ High-mid o [o ~ o̞] Mid e̞ [e̞ ~ ə] Low-mid ɔ Low ä [ä ~ ə] ɑ Diphthongs e̞ɪ äɪ äu ɔɪ ou\n\nConsonants /ɳ/, /ɱ/ and /ɴ/ can in some cases be moraic, in which case they are geminated and pronounced as /ɳ:/, /ɱ:/ and /ɴ:/. In addition some consonant complexes can be formed. These are /ʈ͡ʂ/, /ʈ͡ɕ/, /ɖ͡ʐ/, /ɖ͡ʑ/, /t͡s/, /ʈɰβ/, /ɖɰβ/, /ɳɰβ/ and /ɳɱ/.\n\n/ɳɱ/, /ɳ:/ and /ɱ:/ appear only when /ɳ:/ precedes a labiodental /b̪/ or /ɱ/ resulting in /ɳ:/ being pronounced as either /ɳɱ/, /ɳ:/ or /ɱ:/ for phonological reasons.\n\nWhen followed by /i/, consonants /ʂ/, /ʐ/, /ʈ͡ʂ/ and /ɖ͡ʐ/ can be pronounced as /ɕi/, /ʑi/ /qji/, /ɢji/, /ħji/, /ʈ͡ɕi/ and /ɖ͡ʑi/ respectively.\n\nWhen followed by /i/, consonants /q/, /ɢ/ and /ħ/ can be pronounced as /qji/, /ɢji/ and /ħji/ respectively. When followed by /e̞/, consonants /q/, /ɢ/ and /ħ/ can be pronounced as /qje̞/, /ɢje̞/ and /ħje̞/ respectively.\n\n/ɴ/ and /ɴ:/ appear before or after the uvular consonants /q/ and /ɢ/ in place of /ɳ/ and /ɳ:/. /ɺɽ~ɭ/ can sometimes be heard as either ɺɽ or ɭ but is generally an intermediate sound. The sound /ɺɽ~ɭ/ itself has no human equivalent. /ɻ/ and /ɽ/ allophones of the same consonant. In reality they are only approximates of the Sangheili r sounds which has no human equivalent. Most users prefer to use /ɻ/. /ä/ is near front and closer to the Japanese /ä/ but some speakers pronounce it as a central vowel like the Italian /ä/. Some speakers use /ä/ insead of /ɑ/. /e̞/ and /i/ are near front vowels and not front vowels. /ɔ/ and /o̞/ are allophones of the same vowel. As such their use depends on the speaker’s preference. /ʊ/ can be used instead of /u/ when /u/ is short only. /ɯβ/ can be used instead of /u/ regardless of whether /u/ is short or long. The sound itself is compressed and neither rounded nor fully unrounded. It is pronounced like the Japanese u. /ɰβ/ is a compressed labiovelar approximant. It can also be symbolized as /wβ/. It is pronounced like the Japanese w.\n\nSometimes /ɖ͡ʐ/ can be pronounced as /ʐ/ or /ɖ͡ʐ~ʐ/.\n\nSangheili also makes use of the following diphthongs:\n\n/e̞ɪ/, can be pronounced as /e̞j/ before vowels\n\n/ou/ also pronounced as /oɯβ/, /oʊ/, /o̞u/, /o̞ɯβ/ or /o̞ʊ/\n\n/äɪ/\n\n/ɔɪ/ also pronounced as /o̞ɪ/ and sometimes pronounced as /ɔj/ or /o̞j/ before vowels.\n\n/äu/ also pronounced as /äɯβ/ or /äʊ/ (rare)\n\nPhonetic transcription[edit]\n\nSummary of letter-to-sound correspondences Letter(s) Corresponding sound(s) a /ä/\n\n/ə/ if the syllable is weakened aa /ɑ:/ ~ /ä:/ ae /äə/ ~ /äe̞/ ~ /e̞:/ ah /ɑ:/ ~ /ä:/ ai usually, /äɪ/\n\nalternatively, /e̞ɪ/ au /äu/ ~ /äɯβ/ ~ /äʊ/ ay /e̞ɪ/\n\n/e̞j/ when followed by a vowel\n\n/äj/ (rarely) e /e̞/\n\n/ə/ if the syllable is weakened eay /ɪ.e̞ɪ/ ee /i:/ ~ /ɪ:/ eh /e̞:/ ei /e̞ɪ/\n\n/i:/ (rarely) ey /e̞ɪ/\n\n/e̞j/ when followed by a vowel i /ɪ/ ie /äɪ/ o /ɔ/ ~ /o̞/ oh /ɔ:/ ~ /o̞:/ oo /u:/ ~ /ɯβ:/ ~ /o:/ ou /ou/ ~ /oɯβ/ ~ /oʊ/ ~ /o̞u/ ~ /o̞ɯβ/ ~ /o̞ʊ/ oy /ɔɪ/ ~ /o̞ɪ/\n\n/ɔj/ ~ /o̞j/ when followed by a vowel u /u/ ~ /ɯβ/ ~ /ʊ/ uh /u:/ ~ /ɯβ:/ uu /u:/ ~ /ɯβ:/ y /j/ between two vowels or at the beginning of a word\n\n/ɪ/ at the end of a word, before a consonant, or after any consonant except \"nn\" m /ɱ/ n /ɳ/\n\n/ɴ/ when adjacent to /q/ or /ɢ/\n\n/ɳ ~ ɳɱ ~ ɱ/ when followed by any labiodental consonant ( /ɱ/, /b̪/, /p̪/, /f/, /ʋ/) nn /ɳ:/\n\n/ɴ:/ when adjacent to /q/ or /ɢ/\n\n/ɳ: ~ ɳɱ ~ ɱ:/ when followed by any labiodental consonant v /ʋ/ l /ɺɽ ~ ɭ/ p /p̪/ t /ʈ/ k /k ~ q/\n\n/kj~qj/ when followed by /i/ or /e̞/ ' /ʔ/ b /b/ d /ɖ/ g /g ~ ɢ/\n\n/gj~ɢj/ when followed by /i/ or /e̞/ gh /ɢ ~ ɢh/\n\n/ɢje̞:/ and /ɢhe̞:/ when followed by \"e\" (thus forming \"ghee\")\n\n/ɢje̞ɪ/, /ɢhe̞ɪ/, /ɢji:/ and /ɢhe:/ when followed by \"ei\" (thus forming \"ghei\") f /f/ s /s/ sh /ʂ/\n\ncan be pronounced /ɕ/ when followed by /i/ h /ħ/\n\n/ħj/ when followed by /i/ z /z/ ts /t͡s/ ch /ʈ͡ʂ/\n\ncan be pronounced /ʈ͡ɕ/ when followed by /i/ j /ɖ͡ʐ ~ ʐ/\n\ncan be pronounced /ɖ͡ʑ ~ ʑ/ when followed by /i/ r /ɻ ~ ɽ/ w /ɰβ ~ w/ tw /ʈɰβ/ dw /ɖɰβ/ nw /ɳɰβ/ - Used following \"h\" to separate syllables.\n\nExample: \"uh-eh\" is pronounced /u:i:/, \"uheh\" as /uħe:/\n\nIn order to phonetically transcribe Sangheili, 343 Industries uses the following transliteration system:\n\nVowels and dipthgongs[edit]\n\na e correspond to /ä/ and /e̞/ respectively.

Not all races can speak the same language due to evolutionary design restrictions; for example, the Yanme'e could only communicate through a cacophony of high-pitched clicks and screeches.[37] To facilitate easier communications between member species, translation software is used on Covenant ships to decipher words.[38] During and after the Human-Covenant War, several humans were able to understand Sangheili :\n\nCatherine Halsey[39]\n\nEvan Phillips[32]\n\nLuther Mann[40]\n\nMelody Azikiwe\n\nMike Spenser[41]\n\nOlympia Vale[40]\n\nJacob Keyes[42]\n\nSymbol types[edit]\n\nThere are four known written types of the Sangheili language.\n\nTriangle type (original cipher)[edit]\n\nThis triangle variant of the written language has a few key features. They are a big triangle surrounded by numerous smaller triangles. These smaller triangles are known to be closer to the corners of the bigger triangle, and can either be floating above the corner, or very close to it. The direction of the bigger triangle is not set, leading to there being numerous possibilities to what one symbol could mean. The bigger triangle is also known to have semi-circles cut out of the middle of its sides, sometimes filled with circles. Sometimes the triangles points are not there and are replaced by a circle. Sometimes rectangles are involved in the symbols. There is also thinner and longer triangle symbols in this type of symbols. These can have a smaller triangle at its smaller side or not.\n\nThere are a few different translations for these types of symbols. They are seen often in transmissions and on control panels. These have been in use as early as February 4th 2531 in transmissions during the Harvest Campaign.[43]\n\nTriangle alphabet 1[edit]\n\nCovenant alphabet used in several systems and consoles.\n\nA Covenant system over Harvest that uses this alphabet.\n\nA control panel with the symbols on it.

They are big triangles with a spike coming out near the corners. Smaller triangles, unlike the triangle type symbols, are closer to the middle of the sides, touching the spike coming out near the corner.\n\nThere is sometimes a smaller triangle taken out the sides of the bigger triangles, and sometimes triangle taken out the middle of them also.\n\nThese are often seen in transmissions and also on control panels. These have been in use as early as April 26, 2526 in transmissions during the Battle of Circinius IV.[44]\n\nNormal use[edit]\n\nCovenant Alphanumerical Forms\n\nNumbers 00 to 18 that appear on the Mosa-pattern carbine in Halo 4.\n\nBumped triangle type used prior to the battle of Circinius IV in Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn.

This language was a simple cipher with the triangular characters. In addition to Halo2.com, a released wallpaper contained triangular characters that made use of this cipher. After the Halo2.com site, the cipher changed. Two wallpapers were released with an entirely new cipher still using the triangular characters. Neither this cipher or the previous one have been used subsequently, though the triangular characters are still commonly used.\n\nThe Covenant speech in Halo: Reach is actually able to be translated.[45] A common useful word to understand in gameplay is \"awugapu,\" which is used to announce that a grenade is being thrown.\n\nThe languages in their original form are heard in Halo: Combat Evolved. In Halo 2, their words are translated for the convenience of the player. Elites in Halo: CE spoke a deep, warbling tongue. This was achieved by reversing the voice acting of David Scully. The ever-popular \"Wort, wort, wort!\" shouted by many Elites during gameplay is actually Sergeant Johnson’s famous \"Go, go, go!\" reversed and sped up.[46] The hissing-like language of the Jackals is actually the English language reversed. This, and the other Covenant languages (Drones, Hunters), have remained the same since Halo 2.\n\nAccording to voice actor David Sobolov, who played Ripa 'Moramee in Halo Wars and Jul 'Mdama in Halo 4, the fictional language spoken by the Elites in Halo 4 was a \"made-up language that was based on Japanese,\" that started out as being improvised by the voice actors. Except due to legal concerns, the voice lines and language were intentionally scripted instead. Because of the complexity of the fictional language, \"it took almost ten minutes per line to record\" and required extra time to record than usual.[47]\n\nIn Halo 5: Guardians, Sangheili hieroglyphics were inspired by Islamic, Mongolian, and Indian art, as well as Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphics.[48]\n\nA Covenant language was created by David Peterson, creator of the Dothraki language used in Game of Thrones, for Halo: The Television Series.[49] Peterson posts transcripts for the words and their translations in a series of posts on Archive of Our Own, accessible here.\n\nGallery[edit]\n\nSangheili vowels as pronounced in the games and live action films by Sangheili.\n\nConcept art of control panels with Sangheili symbols on it.\n\nEmblem of a Covenant symbol in Halo 4.\n\nList of appearances[edit]\n\nHalo: The Fall of Reach (First appearance)\n\nHalo: Combat Evolved\n\nHalo: First Strike\n\nHalo 2\n\nHalo Graphic Novel\n\nHalo: Ghosts of Onyx\n\nHalo: Landfall\n\nHalo: Arms Race\n\nHalo: Combat\n\nHalo: Last One Standing\n\nHalo: Uprising\n\nHalo 3\n\nHalo: Contact Harvest\n\nHalo: The Cole Protocol\n\nHalo Wars: Genesis\n\nHalo Wars\n\nHalo 3: ODST\n\nHalo Legends\n\nThe Package\n\nOrigins\n\nHalo: Blood Line\n\nHalo: Evolutions - Essential Tales of the Halo Universe\n\nStomping on the Heels of a Fuss\n\nBlunt Instruments\n\nThe Mona Lisa\n\nThe Return\n\nHalo: Reach\n\nHalo: Glasslands\n\nHalo: Combat Evolved Anniversary\n\nHalo: The Thursday War\n\nHalo 4: Forward Unto Dawn\n\nHalo 4\n\nTerminals\n\nSpartan Ops\n\nHalo: Mortal Dictata\n\nHalo: Broken Circle\n\nHalo: Nightfall\n\nHalo 2: Anniversary\n\nHalo: Hunters in the Dark\n\nHunt the Truth\n\nHalo 5: Guardians\n\nHalo: Shadow of Intent\n\nHalo: Tales from Slipspace\n\nHunting Party\n\nKnight Takes Bishop\n\nHalo: Bad Blood (Mentioned only)\n\nHalo: The Television Series\n\nContact\n\nUnbound\n\nEmergence\n\nHomecoming\n\nTranscendence\n\nHalo: The Rubicon Protocol\n\nNotes[edit]"
