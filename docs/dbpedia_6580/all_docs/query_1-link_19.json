        "text": "Okay, firstly, I give it 4 stars because I respect there isnât a set vocabulary word thatâs only used. Also, there many different voices you can hear.\n\nIâve used the original GhostTube app and Iâve seen several stick figures showing that there is possibly entities in my house.I never wanted to test my house however Iâve always had a weird vibe in my laundry room. And Iâve also heard questionable noises. Now when I downloaded the Vox and trust me it took lots of courage to do it LOL. The very first sound I heard was a male and it said go away. Then I tried it again the next day and I immediately stated my respects and Iâm here for only peace and love and please do not disturb me or my children. I heard female voices and other friendly voices but what scared me the most is a very very creepy voice that said Iâm watching you. Then it also stated something that I couldnât understand and freaked me out. I sinve then deleted the apps but before doing so, I let that entity know Iâm not scared and it must leave. I sagged my house and I opened the door and aggressively said you have to get out. Please from GhostTube creators answer me truthfully. Should I be worried and have someone bless my house?\n\nI get scared often,of watching any possible real paranormal investigations,I realize sometimes Itâs because Iâm too paranoid & that if theyâre real ghosts being investigated by paranormal investigators,I feel their energy! & if anyone is scared of ghosts,without the app and even deleting the app might not do anything,to stop the ghosts from haunting you.\n\nOf course Iâm scared of ghosts because theyâre unknown & just like blood youâre not used to seeing them/seeing your blood!\n\nSo far,The cats had seen possibly ghosts,I have seen a real ghost before who is a family member,I had used this app at home not where my family member died at/is buried at,no description of my home being haunted,& I only once heard a clear,âI agreeâ,âTell me moreâ as I talked & I was slightly scared but felt relaxed as whoever this ghost was,has loved my conversation! I wonder if he was my family member coming here for a visit? Reminded me of one of my cats! Which is a girl ðð¥¹ð\n\nThis app isnât a perfect 5 stars. But 4 stars does seem a bit too low. So idk lol. I live right next to a cemetery. I live in a very old house in the countryside. I definitely know for sure that there are ghosts in this house. I used the app in the cemetery and got some activity. I mostly kept hearing the EXACT phrases over and over again tho. Idk if it was because there was no service in the cemeteryâ¦ so like maybe there werenât many radio stations available to scan through? Pls answer. I did have some good experiences tho. We heard âchildrenâ and there was a gravestone of two infants. And âBarbaraâ and we heard it right next to somebody named âBarbaraâ buried in the cemetery! Also when I got home, a ghost told me to get a better shirt :/\n\nPretty good app. Not quite worthy of a perfect 5 stars. But still definitely good! Seems legit to me, iâll be sure to use it when weâre at Franklin Pierceâs gravestone in Concord NH!"
