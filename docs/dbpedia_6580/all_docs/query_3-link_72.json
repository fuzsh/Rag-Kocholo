        "text": "CAESAR\n\nI must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond, To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools —I mean, sweet words, Low-crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banishèd. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied.\n\nCAESAR\n\nI must stop you, Cimber. Your kneeling and overly humble courtesies might flatter ordinary men to turn Roman law into some kind of child's game. But don’t be so foolish as to think that you can influence Caesar to do something that is not right through the tricks that persuade fools—flattery, low bows, and pathetic dog-like fawning. Your brother was banished by decree. If you kneel and beg and flatter for him, I’ll kick you like a dog out of my way. Know that Caesar does not punish him without good reason, and will not give him what he wants without good reason.\n\nCAESAR\n\nI could be well moved if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the northern star, Of whose true-fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks. They are all fire and every one doth shine, But there’s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world. 'Tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive, Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion . And that I am he Let me a little show it even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished, And constant do remain to keep him so.\n\nCAESAR\n\nI could be influenced if I were like you. If I could beg others to change their minds, begging would convince me, too. But I’m as steady as the northern star, whose stable and immobile quality has no equal in the sky. The skies are filled with countless stars. They are all made of fire, and every single one shines. But there's just one out of all of them that holds its central place. The world is the same way. It's full of men—and men are flesh and blood, and capable of understanding. Yet of them all, I know just one who is beyond questioning and immovable, who never shifts from his position. I am that man, and I will show you in this way: I was resolved that Cimber should be banished, and I am resolved that he should remain banished.\n\nANTONY'S SERVANT\n\n[kneeling] Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. [falls prostrate] Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest. Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say I love Brutus, and I honor him. Say I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living , but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony.\n\nANTONY'S SERVANT\n\n[Kneeling] Brutus, my master told me to kneel just like this. [He lays down with his head down to the floor] And like this. He told me to prostrate myself, and, being on the ground like this, he told me to say: “Brutus is noble, wise, brave, and honest. Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Antony loves Brutus and honors him. Antony feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will promise that Antony would be safe to come to him and hear and explanation why Caesar deserved to be killed, Mark Antony will not love dead Caesar as much as living Brutus. And he will follow noble Brutus through the hard times of this unprecedented state of affairs.” So says my master, Antony.\n\nANTONY\n\nO mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well. —I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die. No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age.\n\nANTONY\n\n[To CAESAR's body] Oh, mighty Caesar! Do you lie so low? Are all of your conquests, glories, triumphs, and successes now shrunk to such little value? Farewell.\n\n[To the conspirators] Gentlemen, I don’t know what you plan to do; who else you must kill; who else you think is corrupt. If it’s me, there’s no time as fitting as this hour of Caesar’s death, and no weapons even half as worthy as your swords— which have been made rich by being covered in the noblest blood in the whole world. I beg you, if you have a grudge against me, do what you want to do right now while your stained hands still smell of blood. Even if were I to live a thousand years, I would never find another moment when I would be as ready to die as I am now. There’s no place I’d rather die than next to Caesar, and no manner of death I'd prefer than being stabbed by you, the leaders of this new era.\n\nBRUTUS\n\nO Antony, beg not your death of us. Though now we must appear bloody and cruel— As by our hands and this our present act You see we do —yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not. They are pitiful. And pity to the general wrong of Rome— As fire drives out fire, so pity pity— Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers' temper do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.\n\nBRUTUS\n\nOh, Antony, don’t beg us to kill you. Though we must seem to be bloody and cruel right now to you—with our bloody hands and what we've just done—you’re only seeing our hands and the bloody work they've done. You have not seen into our hearts. They are full of pity for Caesar. But, just as fire drives out fire, our pity for the wrongs committed against Rome overcame our pity for Caesar and made us do what we did to Caesar. As for you, our swords have soft points that will not harm you, Mark Antony. Our arms—with the same strength they had in striking Caesar—and our hearts—filled with brotherly love—embrace you with kind love, good thoughts, and admiration.\n\nANTONY\n\nI doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. [shakes hands with the conspirators] First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you. —Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand. —Now, Decius Brutus, yours. —Now yours, Metellus. —Yours, Cinna. —And, my valiant Casca, yours. —Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius. —Gentlemen all, alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer —That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true. If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes— Most noble!—in the presence of thy corse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart; Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand, Signed in thy spoil, and crimsoned in thy lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer, strucken by many princes, Dost thou here lie!\n\nANTONY\n\nI don’t doubt your wisdom. May each of you give me his bloody hand. [He shakes hands with the conspirators]\n\n[To BRUTUS] First, Marcus Brutus, I will shake your hand.\n\n[To CASSIUS] Next, Caius Cassius, I take your hand.\n\n[To DECIUS] Now, Decius Brutus, yours.\n\n[To METELLUS] Now yours, Metellus.\n\n[To CINNA] Yours, Cinna.\n\n[To CASCA] And, my valiant Casca, yours.\n\n[To TREBONIUS] Though I shake your hand last, I do not love you the least, good Trebonius.\n\n[To the conspirators] All of you gentlemen, alas, what can I say? Now that we’ve shaken hands, my credibility stands on such slippery ground that you must think me either a coward or a flatterer.\n\n[To CAESAR's body] It is true that I loved you, Caesar. If your spirit is looking down upon us now, would it grieve you more than even your death to see your Antony making peace, and shaking the bloody hands of your enemies—most noble enemies!—in the presence of your corpse? If I had as many eyes as you have wounds, and they wept tears as fast as your wounds stream blood, even that would be more becoming than joining your enemies in friendship. Forgive me, Julius! Here is where you were brought down, like a brave deer surrounded by hunting dogs. Here is where you fell, and here your hunters still stand, stained and reddened by your blood. Oh, world, you were the forest to this deer. And this deer, oh world, was your dear. Now you lie here, so much like a deer, stabbed by many princes!\n\nBRUTUS\n\n[To CASSIUS so that only he can hear] If you'll agree, I myself will stand on the platform first and explain the reason for Caesar’s death. I will announce that Antony speaks with our permission, and I will say that we believe Caesar should be honored with all the usual and lawful ceremonies. It will help us more than it will do us harm.\n\nBRUTUS\n\nMark Antony, here, take Caesar’s body. You will not blame us in your funeral speech, but will say all the good you can think of about Caesar. And you will also say that you do all this with our permission. Otherwise, you won't take any part in his funeral. And you’ll speak on the same platform that I do, after I've finished my own speech.\n\nANTONY\n\nO, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers! Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy— Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue— A curse shall light upon the limbs of men. Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy. Blood and destruction shall be so in use, And dreadful objects so familiar, That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds, And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men, groaning for burial.\n\nANTONY\n\nOh, pardon me, you bleeding corpse, for being quiet and friendly with these butchers! You are the remains of the noblest man that ever lived. May disaster strike the hand that shed this priceless blood. Over your wounds—which, like speechless mouths, open their red lips as if to beg me to speak—I predict that a curse will come down on us. Anger between brothers and fierce civil war will burden all of Italy. Blood and destruction will be so common and dreadful events so familiar, that mothers will just smile when they watch their babies cut to pieces by the hands of war. The sheer volume of evil deeds will choke people’s compassion. And Caesar’s ghost—searching for revenge with Atë by his side—will rush up from hell and cry in the voice of a king, “Havoc!” His ghost will unleash the dogs of war, so that this foul murder will cover the earth with men’s corpses, begging to be buried.\n\nANTONY\n\nPost back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet. Hie hence, and tell him so.—Yet, stay awhile. Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace. There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruèl issue of these bloody men. According to the which, thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand.\n\nANTONY\n\nRide quickly back to him, and tell him what has happened. This is now a Rome in mourning, a dangerous Rome. A Rome that is not safe for Octavius yet. Get going and tell him so. No, actually, stay a while. You shouldn't go back until I’ve carried the corpse into the marketplace. There I’ll figure out, through my speech, what the people think of the cruel deeds of these bloody men. Based on how the people respond, you’ll report back to young Octavius about the state of things. Help me with the body."
