At one time, its dungeons were used as brutal torture chambers that took the lives of countless victims, giving way to a myriad of paranormal claims over the years. The Ghost Hunters International team will sort through these many paranormal accounts and determine what tortured souls still linger at the infamous fortress. From there, the team embarks on a terrifying investigation into the abandoned depths of Mary King's Close in Scotland.

Then, a trip to Wales takes them to the legendary Nanteos Mansion, which lore dictates to be the one-time resting place of the Holy Grail.

The Ghost Hunters International team will conduct their own investigation as well as scrutinize the original video recording of this extraordinary event to determine its authenticity.

The castle has been the subject of local legends for years, the most notorious of which tells the tale of two captured soldiers who died in a well on the castle grounds in which they had spent years living as captives. The myriad of paranormal claims made over the years include dark moving figures and unexplainable shadows lurking around the courtyard.
