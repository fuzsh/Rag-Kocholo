        "text": "I am very skeptical of these ghost hunter apps. I would use other apps and just get random words and nonsense. Well, let me tell you that thereâs some truth behind this app. I was at a House, was told an older gentleman had died snow blowing the driveway. I was sitting on the floor, in the master bedroom, eating some carrots and had my water bottle right next to me. The EVP was reading, ârug, dinner, drink, carrotâ ok, thatâs kinda specific, it got my attention. Then it said âplayâ âcatch meâ the radar sweep went wacko. Several yellow, blue and red dots non-stop all around the radar for about 30 sec. now I donât know if this is part of the program on the app, but i have spent endless hours on this app and have not been able to duplicate that event. Also, when you ask questions, I never get immediate responses... a few specific responses came hours later. A few times I turned the app on and while I was driving, it seemed to know exactly where I was going, more specific, what street I was going. â my job requires driving and work inside housesâ i am careful not to say where Iâm going, I donât want the microphone to hear what Iâm saying. So one time the EVP said âEricâ and over a period of an hour, said sweater 3 times. When I arrived at the house, the home ownerâs name was âErricâ and he was wearing a sweater, in the middle of summer.\n\nInteresting app, I think overall itâs s good tool, have used it with Ghost radio, interesting results when both are being used together.\n\nSooooo figured I would leave this review as this is far too coincidental to be ironic. I have this app on my phone, itâs been there for a couple years and I use it in good fun here and there. Iâve be heard itâs said to be the most accurate app of its kind so I paid the $5 for it. Never had any sort of âawe ha!â moment or nothing like that. Today however that changed. My six year old was jumping around on my bed and in effort to save my phone I picked it up to move it. When I did I noticed that this app was open, not just open but in use. It was running the EVP function of the app and had just spit out the word âcrib.â I thought, âweâll thatâs weird?â So I decided to look at the history to see how long it had been on or spitting out words, which wasnât but a few minutes. The previous words went in this order, âaccompany, belly, protect, crib.â So needless to say I was a little weirded out. I called my boyfriend to tell him about it and I opened up the app again while I was on the phone with him and the first word it said was, âdaddy.â Long story shortâ¦ within an hour I took 3 pregnancy tests of which all 3 were positive. So Im pregnant, and this app, or a ghost, dare I say it, told me I was? Mind blown. Not sure if this app is legit or not but Iâd say thereâs something to it because that was all extremely ironic if not.\n\nI am a medium and used many different EVP tools but have been Leary of the IPhone tool. I assumed it was a hoax and would be able to hear the questions I ask and key in on certain words and respond with specific answers. That has NOT been the case AT ALL! I've been using this for 6 months and it amazes me ever single time! Just the other day I brought my lunch into my room and laid in my bed and turned it on. I let it warm up for a few minutes and didn't say anything because that is what you are suppose to do. Within 30 seconds the Tool said, \"Bread, Plate\". I had a subway sandwich sitting on a paper plate right next to the phone on my bed. The day before that I was using it because I have a spirit in trying to help cross over and I has to go to the bathroom. The spirit was being very quiet and not very cooperative with me all day. So I told her I was going to the bathroom and I'd be right back. It was about 5 feet away. I start hearing word after word. Then it stops. I flush, pull up my pants and then hear, \"STEPHANIE\". That freaked me out because that is my name. That's how I know this is real."
