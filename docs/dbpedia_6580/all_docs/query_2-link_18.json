        "text": "A panoramic pummeling of the pseudoscience that is paranormal investigation\n\n“What do you think we do with all this equipment? Do you think we study electromagnetic fields for fun? This is what we do. We make the illogical logical. We find the reason in everything that reason can’t explain.”\n\nJacqueline E. Smith, Lost Souls, 2019\n\nWhile a fictional character utters the above quote, a survey of the attitudes of most ghost hunters today shows a similar mindset.\n\nIn fact, popular real-life paranormal investigators Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson echo that viewpoint claiming they use “…scientific methods to determine whether or not someone’s home might be haunted.”(1)\n\nHowever, according to Benjamin Radford, author and deputy editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine, the methods used on their long-running TV series Ghost Hunters, a show whose methodology is copied by a large number of amateur followers, are…\n\n… both illogical and unscientific.\n\n“The Ghost Hunters lacked good science to begin with, and their methods have not become any more scientific--or any more effective-- since they began,” he observes.(2)\n\nNot surprising, proof that ghosts exist is no better today than it was 100 years ago. In fact, Radford adds, watch a paranormal investigation show or video and it’s often apparent that the “hunt” is more about having fun—and selling “merch”--than finding evidence.(3)\n\nAnd if you’re an author, blogger, content creator, newsletter publisher, or science writer of material that debunks the existence of paranormal entities, there’s an extensive amount of info, data, and weaponry available to support your focus.\n\nThe stealth psychology that’ll unconsciously induce readers to accept your statements\n\nThe strategy for approaching these kinds of projects is based on five factors: Psychological ventriloquism, future pacing, FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt), competition vaporization, and weaponized identity roles.\n\nThe tactical tools are Neuro-Linguistic Programming Language Patterns (NLP LPs) and Emotional Trigger Words.\n\nLanguage patterns are sentences that bypass the conscious mind and cause your reader to accept your statements without question, says Lou Larsen, author and distinguished NLP-based copywriter.\n\nThey’re “…actually quite difficult to block or question…because they slip right in” past people’s mental filters, he explains.(4)\n\nYou can seamlessly seed these tantalizing templates into your content. Or, if you’re writing copy to sell a book, e-book, or special report, use them for headlines, subheads, leads, bullets, offers, call-to-actions, and so on.\n\nIn other words, anywhere you want to add more support and value. Just don’t overuse them or you’ll risk looking hypey.\n\nAnd for added power, if I have a reference available for the info in a pattern, I use it. But references are rarely a necessity.\n\nEmotional Trigger Words “…grab your reader’s attention, keep their eyes glued to the page … and then ultimately compel them to make a…decision,” notes direct response copywriter Tony Flores.(6)\n\nAnd, of course, evoke the emotions you’re targeting.\n\nLike adding bat wings to a witch’s brew, you can also mix in “Life-Force 8” (LF8) and “9 Secondary Wants” (9SW) elements.\n\nCreated by marketing consultant and trainer Drew Whitman, they’re advertising’s versions of psychologist Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.(7)\n\nThe LF8 are the basic biologically programmed desires hard-wired into everyone. And the 9SWs are learned desires that exert an incredible amount of control over your reader’s thoughts.\n\nNow--let’s start with this first intriguing strategy…\n\nFocus your prospect’s mind in the direction you want\n\nPicture having the power to…\n\n…project ideas into your reader’s mind that compels them to accept your statements.\n\nYou see, there’s a secret persuasion technique called Psychological Ventriloquism created by Blaire Warren, veteran marketer and persuasion expert.(4) And it gives you the ability to cast your thoughts into your target’s heads and make them think those ideas are their own.\n\nBut my method using language templates and dominant emotions, I believe, is quicker and easier to apply, plus results in faster responses.\n\nSo first, do a deep-dive on your target audience. Then decide what you want them to feel and do. Because before you start using language patterns, you have to know what emotions to trigger, Larsen says.\n\nNext, “You want to get your audience’s mind moving in a ‘certain direction’ without making them feel you are manipulating them,” Larsen says.(5)\n\nGet your reader’s mind going in the right direction by using the language patterns. This can transform their thoughts into physical actions (such as buying your book, subscribing to your newsletter), Larsen says.(5)\n\nTo start, you can…\n\nCatapult thoughts into your target’s mind with this tempting template\n\nThat “little voice in your head.\n\nIt’s likely persuaded you to do many things in the past.\n\nBut what if there was a pattern to control the little voice in your reader’s head? One that subtly pushes them to consider or do whatever you’re stating.\n\nThat’s what the following template can do.\n\n“Did/Do you find that little voice in your head wondering, (PROBLEM)?”(5)\n\nAll you to do is tell or remind them about that little voice.\n\nOf course you need in-depth knowledge of your audience here. A “No” to a Yes/No question pretty much ends your claim instantly.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nDo you find that little voice in your head anxiously wondering, “Why did those ghost hunters only spend a few hours in my house searching for spooks?”\n\nThe book, Scientific Paranormal Investigations, the authoritative source on ghost hunting, maintains that reaching a conclusion on possible supernatural occurrences takes much more time than that.\n\n(Uses every dominant emotion (DE) from anger and fear to shame and urgency; Almost every one of the LF8 from survival and enjoyment of life to freedom from fear and danger; 9SWs such as curiosity, efficiency, and the desire to be informed.)\n\nNext, here’s how to…\n\nUse gloom and doom to hook prospects\n\nPositive messages out-pull material that zooms in on pain, problems, and powerlessness.(5)\n\nSo for content and copy, use positive language with a little negativity to persuade skeptical but hopeful readers. Also, show the frightening effects of not acting now.\n\nAlso, your message needs to grab attention and imagination quickly.(5)\n\nHere’s a negative, stopping pattern that works quite well:\n\n“Don’t wait/delay (to WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO). (SOMETHING NEGATIVE) isn’t (waiting).”(5)\n\nYou can create countless patterns for our writing specialties based on dominant emotions, and the Life-Force 8 and 9 Secondary Wants.\n\nFor instance:\n\nIf mysterious phenomena in your home—cold or hot spots, unexplained noises or shadows, lights turning on and off—is starting to concern, and terrify you…\n\nDon’t wait. Your living nightmare won’t stop by itself. So for answers, get my new book, The Haunted Brain Theory Explained.\n\nGhost hunters rarely provide any specific findings. If they do, they’ll be sparse and inconclusive.\n\n(DE—anger, fear, frustration, powerlessness; LF8—freedom from fear and danger, care and protection of loved ones; 9SW—to be informed)\n\nMake prospects wary of other options\n\nSince a full-frontal attack to persuade someone to your point of view almost never works, you’ll want to use an indirect strategy.\n\nOur next pattern offers a clever way to undermine ghost hunting as a viable option. It transforms your solution into the smart, obvious choice.(5)\n\nTo apply it…\n\nFirst, list all of the faults and negatives in whatever idea or group you’re opposing.\n\nNext, study the advice given. Think of the bad effects that can result. How could someone who took that “guidance” be negatively affected?\n\nLastly, link a colorful comparison to one of the worse results.\n\nYour template:\n\n“(ACTION PROSPECT IS THINKING OF DOING) is about as useful/effective/smart as (SOMETHING SUPERSTITIOUS, USELESS, OLD-FASHIONED, or DANGEROUS).”(5)\n\nIf needed, you can add more info and data to flush out your pattern.\n\nHere’s a terrific example …\n\nPermitting ghost hunter hucksters to investigate unexplained occurrences in your home is about as smart and effective as asking your doctor for leech therapy to improve your vascular health.\n\nBoth responses can drastically backfire on you, and there are much better solutions available, such as…\n\n(DE--especially anger, fear, powerlessness, and hope; LF8--survival…enjoyment of life…freedom from fear, pain, and danger, and care and protection of loved ones; 9SW--the desire to be informed and curiosity.)\n\nOur next vital stratagem is to…\n\nForetell your prospect’s future & create more compelling content or copy…\n\n\"People go only to places they have already been in their minds.”(9)\n\n(Part of the Seventh Law of Universal Advertising)\n\nLanguage patterns that future-pace readers have the power to do exactly that.\n\nThese templates are structured to create a vision in their mind of how their life can change and how they can make better decisions, after they read your message.\n\nThat future can be bright—if they accept your writing, or bleak, if they don’t.\n\nThe advantages of future pacing are many, says Kim Krause Schwalm, master copywriter and copy mentor.\n\nFor starters, your material will be more persuasive, attract a wider audience, and keep eyeballs glued to your message, she notes.(10)\n\nIn addition, Impact Bias fuels future pacing. That means people tend to overestimate the length or the intensity of the impact of future feeling states, notes Jeremy Smith, serial entrepreneur, trainer, and conversion consultant.\n\nThey will then likely think that accepting your recommendations will positively improve their personal satisfaction and wellbeing way longer than it actually will, he adds.(11)\n\nOn the other hand, highlighting negative emotions will cause them to consider the harmful outcome of saying “No.”\n\nBut beware of these two problems that bedevil writers when future pacing\n\nThe two vexing challenges that you may face are…\n\n1. Possessing a limited arsenal of future pacing words or phrases. You risk boring or annoying your reader if you rely on such tired wording as: Imagine if…, picture this…, suppose that…, envision the….\n\n2. Confining the use of future pacing mainly to headlines, leads, and endings. Schwalm encourages writers to use future pacing throughout all of their communications.(10)\n\nBut with our subliminal sentences, you’ll…\n\nEnd those obstacles while subtly influencing prospects\n\nMost of the seven templates that follow work fine solo. However, you’ll want to add more info to many of them to flesh out your future scenario.\n\nLet’s get started…\n\n“You’re going to be X when you get/find out Y…”(14)\n\nYou’re going to be surprised and disappointed when you find out that the devices ghost hunters use to investigate your house—are rubbish. Belief that these gadgets actually work is based purely on wishful thinking, unproven theories, and wild conjectures.(3)\n\n“I wonder what will happen eventually if you (don’t/do) what I want.”(14)\n\nI wonder what will happen eventually if you don’t get my new book that reveals the truth behind the unexplainable events you’re going through. Because if you let “paranormal investigators” trample all over your property, you’re just launching yourself down a rabbit hole of frustration, disappointment, and ultimately, despair.\n\n“Use statements about the future linked to statements that build excitement.”(4)\n\nNow when you first receive “The Haunted Brain Theory Explained” and you start thumbing through it, you’ll feel relieved and excited…\n\n…because you’ll know your solution will be based on real science instead of a bunch of gimmicks and gadgets that have proved to be worthless.\n\n“What if you could (major promise)…without (usual negatives associated with major promise)?”(4)\n\nWhat if you could watch a program that investigated paranormal activity without ghost hunters who believed their personal feelings were evidence of a haunting?\n\nOoh, “I felt like there is a presence here that wants to make contact with us.”\n\nSuch subjective experiences prove zilch.\n\n“When you (skill/benefit from product) every other (things you could do elsewhere) you (verb that you’d perform) is (comparative benefit--easier, quicker, more profitable etc.). You’ll have a foundation…”(4)\n\nWhen you learn the shady secrets of amateur ghost buffs, you’ll easily detect the trickery they pull on clients—and never get bamboozled by them yourself.\n\nMy new book “The Haunted Brain Theory Explained”….\n\n“From the moment you (do what I want you to), you’ll (benefit) and (major promise)—you will become (something strongly positive).”(4)\n\nFrom the moment you download my new e-book “The Science behind the Haunted Brain Theory,” the dark clouds of the living nightmare you’re enduring—\n\nWill vanish like a phantom in a cemetery, and you’ll face your future knowing your haunting ordeal is about to end.\n\n“If you (do/don’t what I want you to), this (positive/negative) will happen…. Then vividly describe future state.”(8)\n\nIf you don’t read my expose about how most paranormal events are huge scams, you could get ripped off like victims of the “A Haunting at Tombstone” hoax.\n\nHere, ticket holders were cheated out up to $900 by flimflam artist….(15)\n\nCrazy, huh? Anyway, consider this next approach. It attacks with emotional triggers from a fresh angle…\n\nSleep Paralysis Demons invoke fear, uncertainty & doubt to freeze their target’s attention…\n\nHere’s how to use that same strategy to persuade readers\n\nCan the nightmare-inducing emotions evoked by sleep paralysis demons stalking prey…\n\n…be used by writers to convince their audience that their scientific explanations are the correct ones?\n\nCertainly…\n\nYou see, the same part of the brain that triggers the dread, anxiety, and immobility created by “night-terror” demons during sleep paralysis…\n\n…is the same one you can use to cause Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) in readers to persuade them to your viewpoint, buy your book, subscribe to your blog, and so on.\n\nIn short, the amygdala, or “lizard brain”—the emotional and threat center of your brain--rapidly realizes potential danger.(13)\n\nThis can occur during sleep paralysis, especially when The Old Hag, an alien, demon, or other creature appears to materialize in your room and menaces you with life-threatening injury.\n\nA similar mental—and physical—response can happen when the FUD strategy is applied to content and copy.\n\nHere’s why…\n\n“People are more inclined to act if they are in pain or fear some kind of loss,” confirms Lou Larsen, a veteran Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) copywriter.(4)\n\nWe’re wired for fear and negative emotions more than we are for positive ones, especially FUD, states Gary Hennerberg, copywriter/creative director and analytic consultant.(13)\n\nSetting the hook: The stealth psychology behind using FUD\n\nUsing FUD alerts readers to the gloom and doom awaiting them if they don’t accept your ideas.\n\nAnd just as sleep demons appear in different ways—alien, demon, old hag, dead relative, evil presence—so can this influential tactic.\n\nJust apply it strategically.\n\nOf course, adding FUD to your promo isn’t random.\n\nHennerberg prefers this psychological model to launch FUD-based attacks…\n\n1. Trigger reader emotion according to the particular FUD you’ve identified.\n\n2. Validate their reasons for experiencing one or more of these emotions and secure their trust.\n\n3. Then quickly let them know how your solution will silence their sorrow.(13)\n\nIgniting FUD for convincing, combustive content & copy\n\nHere’s how to spark target FUD by applying the mind-molding might of our phenomenal phrasings.\n\nThese five stealth sentence structures with examples and explanations will help you launch prospects on their way to believing, buying, or subscribing.\n\nHOWEVER, keep in mind that your reader may already be experiencing hair-raising, spine-tingling occurrences. So use these persuasion devices wisely.\n\nFirst up…\n\n“No matter how hard you try, you can’t (their outcome).”(16)\n\nYour ability to feel empathy is vital here. You’ll see from your reader’s perspective more easily as well as understand their fears, uncertainties, and doubts.\n\nOnce you’ve made your audience aware of your empathy, comfort them with your material by pointing them in the right direction to avoid future pain.\n\nBy presupposing emotional pain, you gain rapport. Agitate that anguish then show how your solution is unique and will resolve their suffering.(16)\n\nFor example…\n\nNo matter how hard you try, you can’t escape the fact that no paranormal investigator in history has ever found a shred of evidence that ghosts exist.(3)\n\nOur next LP balances the opposing motivators delight and distress…\n\n“Would you rather (benefit), or would you rather (consequence).”(16)\n\nOverly positive framed arguments sound too good to be true. Too negative ones can turn off readers.\n\nThat’s where this template comes in—it balances both aspects. And because it ends with the adverse effect, it takes advantage of the Recency Effect.\n\nTo create your version, determine the ultimate benefit of your product or service. Then figure out the consequences of not buying, not acting now, using a competitor, or the prospect doing it their self.\n\nAdded advantages of this pattern are: It gives people a choice and it’s framed as a question--making it more engaging and compelling.(8)\n\nWould you rather have an amateur, part-time hobbyist flounder around studying the weird happenings in your home…\n\nOr engage an expert in logic, forensics, psychology, critical thinking, and scientific investigation to take charge?\n\nOnward…\n\nFUDs that apply “moving away motivation” are convincing. Of course too much of this strategy can backfire.\n\nBut the right amount can propel your prospect over their tipping point.\n\nThe following pattern presupposes peril to your target’s present situation, and their future.\n\n“How safe/secure is/are your (something your prospect cares about that your product/service can help with).”(17)\n\nAsk…\n\nWhat are my prospect’s FUDs as they relate to my argument? Will their internal experience motivate them to accept it—ending the threat your reader’s facing?(17)\n\nLike this…\n\nHow secure is your knowledge about the difference between primitive superstitions and proven scientific methods?\n\nThe former has you fearing phantoms, and the latter, as presented in my new book, will act like a search light illuminating the darkness facing you.\n\nNext, a fast way to emotionally excite your targets.\n\nIt’s the LP…\n\n“How (emotion) are you about (their situation)”(17)\n\nThis presupposes the emotion a reader is experiencing. The gloomy feelings it generates aims to lead an individual in the direction you want.(17)\n\nFor instance…\n\nHow frightened are you about the bizarre phenomena—loud, unexplained noises; objects changing positions overnight; family members reporting feeling the presence of invisible entities—occurring in your home?\n\nAs the heart-pounding urgency of your fears increase, you need real answers fast. And you certainly won’t get that from amateur ghost hunters.\n\n(Then present your solution).\n\nThe following hypnotic pattern subtly influences by combining both moving-away (from fear and pain) and moving toward (to gain and pleasure) motivation.(17)\n\n“You now have a choice: (negative old way with wasted time/consequences of using competition) or (ease, speed, pleasure with your product or service).”(17)\n\nAnd for our purposes…\n\nYou now have a choice: Waste your time dealing with ghost hunter fumblers not trained in scientific investigation methods.\n\nOr, you can discover the truth behind what you’re experiencing from the deputy editor of Skeptical Inquirer magazine Benjamin Radford. Radford has authored over 20 books and 1000s of articles on science-based paranormal investigations.\n\nAfter moving on to our next angle, you’ll find it a bit more blunt...\n\nStealth vaporize your competition…with more demon-clever verbal voodoo\n\nIgnoring your competition is like ignoring a big booger hanging from your nose…\n\nYour reader is going to wonder why you’re not dealing with rival groups or ideas. And someone talking to you is going to wonder why you’re not dealing with that booger.\n\nNow most of us know that bashing your competition can backfire. So instead, we often ignore or insinuate something negative about them.\n\nIn fact, I do the latter on my website.\n\nFor instance, on my home page I address competition like this:\n\n“Oh yes, let’s not forget your other option. Trusting your project to a newbie freelancer. Let’s just say that decision could be hazardous to the health of your company’s finances--and reputation.”\n\nYes, overall, this statement may be true. But what I’m doing is kind of obvious, and savvy readers will take it with a grain of salt.\n\nSo if you want more lethal linguistics that’ll cast doubt on competing articles, books, blogs, and, especially, the con games of most ghost hunters…\n\nRead on to find out to how to--\n\nMind-debug readers about opposing viewpoints\n\nLanguage Patterns work so well because they’re subtle.\n\nFor example, the following sentence presupposes something about my rivals.\n\n“What kind of incompetent fools are my competitors?”\n\nBut it’s certainly not subtle.\n\nSo notice the subtlety involved as you continue through these examples.\n\nAs before, many of these templates will work just by themselves—say as headlines, subheads, subject lines, call-outs, and so on. However, you’ll want to add supporting info when needed.\n\nNow check out the subliminal but persuasive power of the following. For separating your material from rivals they’re hard to beat.\n\nFirst…\n\n“For now, I want you to forget competition, their goods or services. They/They’re negative connotation phrase .”(18)\n\nDismissing your rivals like this basically causes them to vanish from your prospect’s mind, Larsen explains.\n\nAnd, “…negative connotations are ideal for making your competition take the back seat,” he says.(18)\n\nExample:\n\nFor now, I want you to forget about paranormal investigation commercials you’ve seen on TV or Youtube. The amateurs on these ads are notorious for misleading clients, misusing their equipment, and mishandling, misunderstanding, and misrepresenting their findings.\n\nThen there’s…\n\n“Unlike other/most of/its (competitor/product/service), your (product/service) doesn’t/won’t/isn’t (complaints about your rivals).”(4)\n\nSample of its use:\n\nUnlike most commercial ghost hunters, proponents of the Haunted Brain Theory attribute a variety of supernatural occurrences to sleep paralysis, electromagnetic fields, and temporal lobe manipulation. (19)\n\nFollowed by…\n\n“Would you really trust your something vital to prospect to a nullifying label/neutral noun?” (8)\n\nIn action:\n\nWould you really trust your family’s safety and wellbeing to a bunch of untrained dabblers who don’t even know how to use their ghost hunting equipment properly?\n\nYour competition will easily fall prey to this one, Larsen says. Your use of the negative connotation label infers that you’re the positive choice.(8)\n\nWith this next pattern, you’ll differentiate your message even more…\n\n“Name of your product/service: (Intensifier—far, way, so much) (comparative) than (just) type of industry or negative about your market.”(5)\n\nExample:\n\nThe Haunted Brain Theory: The ONLY scientific answer to paranormal events ranging from ghostly appearances to poltergeist activity to shadow people.\n\nLarsen calls our next template…\n\n“A quick and dirty way to plant objections in your prospect’s mind about your competition while at the same time you come out smelling like a rose.”(5)\n\nThis one’s especially handy when you suspect your rivals are hiding something, he says.(5)\n\n“When you (something they’re thinking about doing), do you want/need (something negative)? Or do you (want something positive/what they want)?”(5)\n\nSample:\n\nWhen you deal with ghost hunters, do you have the patience to constantly cope with their claims that all unexplained happenings in your home—are caused by sprits of the dead?\n\n“Uh oh, this area is colder than the others—ghosts; my EFM meter detects a field—ghosts; where did that mysterious noise come from? Ghosts.” (3)\n\nOr, do you want to quickly get all the information you need to figure out the source or sources of the baffling events vexing you? If so, set your mind at ease by ordering…”\n\nThis template works at the nonconscious level so it creates doubt in your prospect’s mind if they’re still researching, Larsen added.(5)\n\nAnd lastly, discover how to…\n\n“Weaponize” your reader’s identity to ghost-puppet their self-image\n\nQuestioning the identity of perusers is the pinnacle of persuasion, Larsen preaches.\n\n“If you are having difficulty persuading people…, or convincing a person of something, you should make an appeal to their identity,” he says.(16)\n\n“Identifications” as they are termed by legendary master copywriter Eugene M. Schwartz, are the roles “your prospect wants to play in life, and the personality traits he wants your product (or here, info) to help him build, or project.”\n\nThe beliefs, feelings, and desires (BFDs) of your audience represent their self-image. Tapping into those BFDs are an ideal way to influence people, Schwartz notes.\n\nSo you’ll want to channel attention, and trigger and expand on the BFDs of readers with this persuasion angle.(20)\n\nThe roles people play\n\nTo paraphrase Schwartz, people want commentary and advice to perform two roles.\n\nThere are Character Roles that describe personality.\n\nAnd Achievement Roles developed by society such as status, class, and position.\n\nApplying Identification in your material is fairly simple.\n\n1. Identify which roles your reader will identify with in your message.\n\n2. Present that role “…vividly and so intensely” it will be accepted or rejected—depending on your agenda.\n\nSo let’s examine some examples with explanations of each.\n\nCharacter Roles\n\nHere’s the first frame:\n\nSimple, easy to apply, but quite effective.\n\n“I can tell you're a person who (IDENTITY) because (REASON WHY).”(16)\n\nExample:\n\nI can tell you’re a reasonable, intelligent person. How? Because you’re still reading about my new e-book that reveals why ghost hunting shows are so transparently fake.”\n\nIf you’re familiar with marketing copy, you’re aware that providing a “reason why” packs a potent punch. It’s “… a very powerful way to persuade people...even if the reason why doesn’t really make much sense,” Larsen adds.\n\nUse this next template early in your copy or content, because it can loosen up your target.(16)\n\nAnd, you can come up with plenty of variations of this pattern.\n\n“I know you (IDENTITY) because (REASON WHY).”(16)\n\nI know you’re sharp person because you’ve subscribed to blog which exposes the scams many paranormal investigators run on their victims.\n\nModified here, this NLP sentence not only appeals to identity, it also makes reader’s part of a desired group--another splendid persuasion tactic. Even better, like the template it’s based on, it includes the word “because.”A word we’re hardwired to respond to.(16)\n\nKnowing who your readers think they are and how they think of themselves is vital to our next template. And attaching your message to that identity is a commanding way to influence somebody.(5)\n\n“For (TYPE OF PERSON) only.”(5)\n\nThis individual has to be the kind your audience sees themselves as. Or, would like to.\n\nThe pattern works as a subheading or can be dropped into body copy directly.(5)\n\nExample:\n\nFor rational minds only.\n\nLonger example:\n\nFor responsible but alarmed homeowners aching for logical answers to the bizarre and frightening events disrupting their family’s lives.\n\nAchievement Roles\n\nALERT: The following pattern requires that you have solid rapport with your audience. Use it wrong and you might insult even alienate them.\n\n“But use it correctly, and it will sink into your readers' minds subliminally, making them keen to act,” Larsen comments.(17)\n\n“Are you [A HIGHER IDEAL OF THEIR IDENTITY] or just another [LOWER, MORE DEROGATORY FORM OF THEIR IDENTITY]?”(17)\n\nAre you a sane, critical thinker or a crude troglodyte who mindlessly thinks every weird happening in your home has ghostly origins?\n\nYou can also future pace this pattern with this beginning: “Do you want to be…?”\n\nDo you want to be respected as a capable, responsible parent or a naïve, backward oaf who goes bonkers when one of your kids claims they saw their dead grandma?\n\nFor both, just ask, what are the two extremes--the most positive and the most negative? How do your readers see themselves? How would they like to? Integrate answers into the frame.(17)\n\nOur last pattern can trigger either the positive or negative results your reader wants.\n\n“Every successful/intelligent (TYPE OF PERSON THAT FITS PROSPECT'S DESCRIPTION) knows/realizes that (THE RESULT OF WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO).”(4)\n\nExample:\n\nEvery alert TV or YouTube video viewer knows that if murdered ghosts sought justice, they’d head toward the nearest police station—not some old, decrepit mansion.\n\nWith that final pattern, you’ve undoubtedly concluded that…\n\nMurky methods and scanty schooling plague the paranormal investigation field\n\nWriters in the paranormal market now have a trance-inducing trove of tactical templates to mesmerize and influence readers.\n\nMost ghost hunters believe that viewers and others swallow their improper investigations without question—\n\nBut you can subtly—or not—challenge their unscientific claims with these darkness-illuminating language patterns.\n\nAfter all, if so-called professionals can’t scare up something they’ve searched centuries for, most likely it’s their shady science that’s to blame.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
