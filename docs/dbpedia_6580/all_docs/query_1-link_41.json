        "text": "Voice Command Overview\n\nPhasmophobia features voice recognition, and the Ghost will always hear you, so it benefits you to stay quiet if you don't want the Ghost to appear.\n\nHowever, there are times you need to get the Ghost to become active so you can discover which Ghost Type it is, and there are many questions you can ask it.\n\nThe Ghost will be listening as you are exploring a home, but there are also specific things you can ask them while using a Spirit Box or Ouija Board.\n\nAlso, don't forget that saying a Ghosts name will make it super upset, so say it only when you really want it to show its spooky face.\n\nHow to Speak to Ghosts\n\nPhasmophobia allows you to communicate with Ghosts in a few ways. If you have Local Push-To-Talk enabled, you can press the V key on your keyboard to speak and perhaps have the Ghost hear you. If push-to-talk is disabled, then your microphone will always be on, so careful to stay quite during a hunt as any sound your mic pics up may alert the Ghost to your location.\n\nYou can also speak to the Ghost via the in-game item, a Spirit Box. This allows you to not only speak to Ghosts but possibly receive actual answers to your questions. To use the Spirit Box, press the B key and begin to speak. If you get a response, you'll hear it via the Spirit Box's speaker.\n\nHere are all the voice commands and phrases, compiled by us at IGN and by Steam user JAVA, you can ask Ghosts in Phasmophobia:\n\nGeneral Ghost Questions"
