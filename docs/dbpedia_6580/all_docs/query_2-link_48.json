Television Distribution (currently) Release Original network ABC Original release September 8 ( ) – December 22, 1973 (1973-12-22) Chronology Related shows Fred Flintstone and Friends\n\nPartridge Family 2200 A.D.\n\nGoober and the Ghost Chasers is Australian-American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, animated by Eric Porter Studios in Australia and broadcast on ABC from September 8, 1973, to August 30, 1975. A total of 16 half-hour episodes of Goober and the Ghost Chasers were produced. The show's episodes were later serialized as part of the syndicated weekday series Fred Flintstone and Friends in 1977–78. On cable, it was shown as part of USA Cartoon Express and on Boomerang starting in 2000.\n\nLike many animated television programs created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track created by the studio. Cartoon Network and Boomerang airings of the show have the track muted.\n\nPlot\n\nSimilar to Hanna-Barbera's successful Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, Goober and the Ghost Chasers also features a group of teenagers (Ted, Gilly and Tina) solving spooky mysteries with their Afghan Hound-like dog Goober. Writing for Ghost Chasers Magazine, the group uses their equipment from the Apparition Kit (like the Specter Detector, the Poltergeist Powder, etc.) when it comes to determining whether the ghost is real or not. The major differences were that the ghosts they eventually find are real and would help in defeating the fake ghosts. Some of those people behind the mask of some fake ghosts are not criminals. Goober had the power to become invisible (but could not control it) and his closest human companion is reckless instead of cowardly. Also unlike Scooby-Doo, Goober can speak more clearly, but speaks only to \"break the fourth wall\" with a comment aimed at the viewers; otherwise, he merely barks.\n\nIn eight of the first 11 episodes, the Partridge Kids (from The Partridge Family) were regular members of the cast, with their live-action counterparts voicing the parts. They disappear after the eleventh episode and did not appear when other guest stars appeared.\n\nEpisodes\n\nEach of the following episodes was directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, and written by Tom Dagenais, Warren S. Murray, and Dick Robbins.\n\nNº Title Air date 1 \"Assignment: The Ahab Apparition\" September 8, 1973 ( )\n\nThe Partridge Kids are vacationing at Peaceful Cove, but it's anything but peaceful.
