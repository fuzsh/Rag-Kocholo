        "text": "7 Haunting Good Times in San Diego\n\nHave you ever thought of giving your attendees a scare? From historic haunts rich with mystery and rumors of paranormal activity to year-round ghost and gravestones tours, San Diego is a haven for spots guaranteed to frighten even the bravest ghost hunters.\n\nWhaley House\n\nTour one of America's Most Haunted Houses and immediately feel a chill! While you're perusing Old Town San Diego, be sure to stop at the Whaley House. See something out of the corner of your eye that you can't explain? Hear the sound of a ball bouncing off the wall but don't see it? The house is open year-round and offers group tours.\n\nThe Davis-Horton House\n\nIf you're meeting in the Gaslamp Quarter, head off the beaten path to give your attendees a fright! Formerly known as the William Heath Davis House, this historic structure is the oldest standing building in downtown proper. This space is believed to be haunted by the patients who passed throughout its ten years serving as a hospital.\n\nHotel del Coronado\n\nThe beloved Hotel del Coronado's is home to more than its famous red turret roof — a ghost named Kate Morgan. It is said that the young woman checked into the hotel in 1892 and never checked out. Legend has it that her third-floor guestroom is said to experience haunting happenings — flickering lights, inexplicable sounds and shifting items. She has also been said to roam the halls and beach.\n\nHorton Grand Hotel\n\nDowntown is a lively San Diego place for a meeting or event — even spirits tend to stick around, especially at this particular spot. Fans of the paranormal flock to the Horton Grand Hotel to experience the strange happenings at this vintage-inspired San Diego hotel. In the famed Room #309, it is said that guests have experienced an array of spooky experiences, including shaking beds, the sounds of footsteps in the middle of the night and the classic flickering lights.\n\nUSS Midway\n\nThis iconic attraction draws visitors from all over the world to San Diego, so attendees will definitely enjoy stopping by. But according to USS Midway museum curator David Hanson, all historic ships are haunted, and the USS Midway is no exception. Hanson is the leader of San Diego's largest paranormal group and has dubbed the Midway a hotbed for paranormal activity. Guests have reported encountering ghosts and spirits of the ship's former crewmen."
