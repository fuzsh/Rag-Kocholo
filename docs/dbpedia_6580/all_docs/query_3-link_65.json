        "text": "Read below to get answers to our most frequently asked questions.\n\nHow long does a full tour take if I don’t get on and off at all?\n\nThe Old Town Trolley Tour is approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes if you ride the tour all the way around without getting off and on.\n\nWhat language are the tours in?\n\nAll of our tours are in English.\n\nHow much knowledge do your conductors have about the cities?\n\nYou will be amazed at how knowledgeable our conductors are and what great storytellers and entertainers they are, too! All of our tour conductors go through a rigorous six-week training program to ensure that their tour is safe, their information is accurate, and their customer service is outstanding.\n\nAre your tours narrated?\n\nYes, the Old Town Trolley is fully narrated by knowledgeable, expert guides. However, an Old Town Trolley Tour is more than just a narration, it’s an experience! You’ll hear sound effects and much more.\n\nCan I get on and off wherever I want?\n\nYes! This is one of the most unique and enjoyable aspects of an Old Town Trolley Tour. You can hop off and hop on at the different stops around the city, sightseeing at your own pace.\n\nAre food and drinks allowed while on the tour?\n\nFood and drinks are welcome. However alcoholic beverages are not allowed under any circumstance for the safety and comfort of all of our guests.\n\nCan I use my credit card to purchase a ticket?\n\nWe accept all major credit cards at our sales depots. You may also buy a ticket online. Go to buy tickets pages in each city\n\nCan your trolleys accommodate an electric scooter?\n\nPlease go to accessibility to learn more.\n\nDo I have to start at Stop #1?\n\nYou may start your Old Town Trolley Tour at any of our convenient stops. Visit our Maps and Stops in each city to see a list of our stops with information about the attractions and points of interest at each stop.\n\nIs there a discount if I purchase tickets online?\n\nYes! We make buying tickets online convenient and safe; and you save money, too! Click on Rates and Reservations to learn more about buying your trolley tickets online.\n\nWhat is your refund policy?\n\nLearn more about our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee* that is unique in the industry.\n\n*Special exemptions apply to the following reservation-based attractions: Yankee Freedom, Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum, and Ghosts & Gravestones charters.\n\nWhere can I purchase tickets?\n\nWe have convenient ticket locations all over Boston, Key West, Washington DC, Savannah, St Augustine, San Diego, San Antonio and Nashville. In addition, most hotels have tickets available at their concierge desk or you may purchase tickets online.\n\nAre dogs allowed on your trolleys?\n\nService animals are the only animals that are allowed on board the trolleys. A service animal means a dog, regardless of breed or type, that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a qualified individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Animal species other than dogs, emotional support animals, comfort animals, companionship animals, and service animals in training are not service animals.\n\nAre the trolleys handicap-accessible?\n\nA certain number of our trolleys are equipped with hydraulic wheelchair lifts. We do ask that you call ahead to arrange the use of these vehicles. For more information, go to accessibility services.\n\nAre your trolleys enclosed?\n\nThe trolleys are open-air vehicles but have plastic “isinglass” windows that can roll up or roll down depending on the weather conditions.\n\nDo you have any special tours for children?\n\nYes. Several of our cities offer educational field trips.\n\nDo you rent trolleys for group tours, weddings, special events, and transportation charters?\n\nAbsolutely! In fact, we proudly operate a large fleet of sightseeing vehicles, which allows us to accommodate groups both large and small. Please, visit our Groups and Charters for more information on group tours and special events.\n\nDo you run tours in inclement weather?\n\nYes, we operate our tours rain or shine, hot or cold, year-round. Occasionally, we’re forced to close operations for safety reasons, due to extreme conditions such as blizzards.\n\nAre the trolleys heated?\n\nYes. During the wintertime, we use heated trolleys that are glass-enclosed specifically for the colder weather.\n\nHow many times can I go through the loop?\n\nYou may ride the Old Town Trolley Tour around as many times as you wish. However, we recommend that you get off and on as you go and take advantage of the sights. Many of the attractions will get increasingly busy as the day wears on; so it’s often best to take advantage of the stops as you go. In addition, you will hear essentially the same information presented each time you go around on the tour, although presented by each driver with his or her own style and flair.\n\nHow often does the trolley pass by each stop?\n\nOld Town Trolley Tours operates the city’s largest fleet of sightseeing vehicles and this allows us to pick up and drop off more frequently than any other trolley company. The frequency of the trolleys depends on the time of the year, and traffic and weather conditions. In addition, the trolleys tend to run more frequently on weekends than on weekdays.\n\nIf I get off and go to a museum or attraction do you wait outside?\n\nThe trolleys go around the city in a continuous loop, allowing guests to hop off and hop on at the designated stops. When you hop off a trolley to see the sights at a particular stop, that trolley will continue with the tour, and another trolley will arrive shortly to make another pick-up.\n\nWhat is a hometown pass?\n\nThe Hometown Pass program was designed so that residents within our eight cities, Boston, Savannah, Key West, Washington DC, St. Augustine, Nashville, San Antonio and San Diego, can take advantage of our tours and attractions for FREE when accompanied by an adult paid guest.* It is free to join and easy to use. For more information, please call us at 1-800-844-7601 or visit us online. *Restrictions apply.\n\nCan I bring my luggage on board?\n\nSpace on the trolleys is limited, but in some cases, it may be acceptable to bring a small suitcase on board. Bear in mind that our trolleys are designed specifically for sightseeing and therefore contain limited storage space (as compared to motor coaches.)\n\nCan I bring my stroller on board the trolley?\n\nYes, we can accommodate strollers but they must be collapsible and will be stored up front with the conductor. Strollers in the aisle ways would constitute a safety hazard.\n\nIf I order tickets online, do they have to be date specific or are they good any time?\n\nAll e-tickets are good for 6 months from the date of purchase.\n\nDo you run tours in any other cities?"
