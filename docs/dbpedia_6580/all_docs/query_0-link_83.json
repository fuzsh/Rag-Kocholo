        "text": "September 7, 2019\n\nA quick, fun audiobook about a woman who sees ghosts.\n\nWhen a TV renovation show arrives in town and starts tearing up an old house, the resident ghost goes all poltergeist. Scarlet is enlisted to sooth the ghost's ruffled feathers and along the way solve the mystery of her death.\n\nThe Ghost Hunter Next Door reminds me, more than just a little of Angie Fox's Southern Ghost Hunter series. If you enjoyed that, you will love this. It's great fun.\n\nAmanda Ronconi narrates and she's perfect.\n\nMarch 14, 2021\n\nThe Ghost Hunter Next Door is book one in the Beechwood Harbor Ghost Mystery series by Danielle Garrett and Narrated by Amanda Ronconi.\n\nThe Beechwood Harbor Ghost Mystery is set in the same town as the Beechwood Harbor Magic Mystery series. I‚Äôve been enjoying the Harbor Magic series and many have liked this Ghosty spinoff.\n\nThe idea of a ghost whispering florist who helps solve ghost troubles sounds fun and it was. This was a nice listen and a decent start to the series.\n\nScarlet gained her ability to see and talk to ghosts at a young age, but her parents weren‚Äôt welcoming to this. When she was old enough she became a wonder, but she finally found herself wanting to settle into something more permanent. She got her chance and now she works to build her business and on the side help the ghosts in the town.\n\nScarlet is asked by a ghost to get ride of the TV show, but when she doesn‚Äôt the ghost gets angry and bad things happen on set and to her. She meets Lucas who was hired to protect the show. She also stumbles onto a murder mystery bedsides the ghosts.\n\nWe meet a verity of ghosts and they are a bunch of fun characters. I liked the ghosts and the relationship Scarlet has with them. I liked the coastal setting. We also see that Scarlet is not very confident, yet. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how she grows and where her relationship might go with Lucas.\n\nThe only thing that felt out of place was how fast Scarlet revealed her ghost abilities to Lucas, someone she doesn‚Äôt know. She‚Äôs suspicious, shy, unsure, and not big on human relationships, so this felt off for her character.\n\nNarration: Amanda Ronconi did a great job. She also narrates the other series. The wry humor came across and the ghosts all had unique voices. Everyones personalities came out.\n\nRated: 3 Stars\n\nNarration: 4 Stars\n\nNovember 27, 2018\n\nA wonderful bunch of characters in this story, both the live ones and the ghosts. This is an interesting mix of romance, ghosts and mystery. The book is well-written, the characters are engaging and while the ghosts are not scary they are fun. I especially liked the cat. I am looking forward to reading more from this series.\n\nJanuary 3, 2023\n\nThis was okay, not as enjoyable as this authors' \"Nine Lives Magic\" series.\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\n4.5 stars ...\n\nSuper fun start to this series! üëçüòÅüëç\n\nMarch 9, 2019\n\nSeveral trusted book pals have been enjoying the Beechwood Harbor Magic series and I do plan to read/listen to those at some point, but I caught sight of this first book in the spinoff series and the idea of a ghost whipering florist who helps solve ghost-related troubles caught my eye. Both series share the fabulous Amanda Ranconi as the narrator so I decided to give this one a go.\n\nScarlet acquired the ability to see and talk to ghosts as well as help them resolve their issues at a young age. Her parents thought she was delusional and so she's kept quiet about it for the most part. After she was on her own, she decided to travel and drift wherever chance took her around the world. She worked as she went, but occasionally her parents had to bail her out. Nearing thirty, she thought it was time that she went home and settled into something more permanent and her inheritance from her grandmother allowed her to finally set up in business as a florist. She truly struck out on her own when she chose a small Washington State beach town rather than her home in Arizona. Now, she works to build her business and on the side help the ghosts in town. She has two ghosts who have moved with her to the spot, a debonair Englishman from the Victorian period and her cranky, wily cat who can now speak. She has also met a local friendly ghost who has her ghostly finger on all the gossip in town. Scarlet enjoys the town which harbors more than humans and ghosts. Something about it has drawn many paranormals to call it home. She has learned to adjust to them being about among the other unsuspecting humans and stayed to herself and out of all the magic business.\n\nThe story opens with Scarlet getting warned by a terribly angry ghost that she has a week to get rid of the TV show people who are renovating an old Victorian in town or the ghost will go all poltergeist on them. The ghost blew out her window on her shop door with little effort so Scarlet knows she means business about harming people to get them to go. Scarlet can't get rid of the crew and she is reluctant to exorcise a ghost so she seeks to find out what made the ghost so angry. Along with the show's security guard, Lucas, Scarlet stumbles on a murder mystery that everyone thought was an accident.\n\nThis was the intro to a new series and main character. Scarlet is more complex than I expected in a cozy mystery character. She is definitely affected by her parents' distance to her and not being able to have them or anyone else know about her gift. She's got a low self-esteem and is bristling and suspicious of Lucas' interest in her. She puts him off many times when her emotions make her want to form a connection. She's afraid of relationships with anyone but her ghost friends. Lucas sticks it out, but her withdrawals do hurt him. She did have a few woe is me moments, but snapped out of them before it got too annoying. He's had his own past of military service and parental infidelity to shape him, too. It will be interesting to see how things progress in the series. now that Scarlet has solved her first ghost-related case. I do like the coastal setting and the quirky ghosts and I look forward to seeing Scarlet grow confident and move out of her shell.\n\nAmanda Ranconi's narration had that easy going wry humor that seemed to characterize Scarlet. She voiced the ghosts from the past and both genders quite well. I got lost in the story easily and love her style of narration work.\n\nAll in all, this was a good first outing and I look forward to more from this series. I will definitely be going back for the original series now that I've met a few as side characters and have experienced the author's writing style. I think those who enjoy paranormal cozy mysteries should pick this one up.\n\nMy thanks to Tantor Audio for the opportunity to listen to this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nApril 9, 2019\n\nScarlet is a ghost whisper, who learned at a young age to never tell people she can converse with the dead. She in fact has two ghostly companions. The first ghost she ever encountered and an Englishman.\n\nNeedless to say it took Scarlet quite a while to settle down and find herself. Thanks to an inheritance she has recently moved to Beechwood and opened a floral shop. She lives above the shop and one evening a week she listens to ghosts helping the ones she can.\n\nI liked Scarlet right away along with her paranormal companions, a cat, and Englishman. A local ghost who loves gossip and is a good source for intel and new to her inner ghostly circle.\n\nWhen a violent ghost seeks Scarlet out and demands she put a stop to the renovations in her home, we soon find ourselves dealing with a poltergeist as we try to solve an old murder.\n\nIt was fun tagging along with Scarlett and Lucas, the set security guard as they tried to find out what really happened to Rosie in the Victorian home on the fateful night she died.\n\nI love the seaside community of Beechwood Harbor. It seems to be a place that supernaturals flock too, and it‚Äôs nice to see a ghost whisper in their mists. The mystery was well done with some twists. I also enjoyed the budding romance/friendship that occurred.\n\nAmanda Ronconi narrates, and she does a wonderful job capturing the characters from the living to the dead. She narrates the other series and is a good match for Garrett whose stories are perfect for audio listens. This review was originally posted at Caffeinated Reviewer\n\nFebruary 24, 2020\n\nI picked this up because of the narrator, Amanda Ronconi (I really love her narration of Molly Harper's books) and found this book delightful. It's a fun mystery with likeable characters and I've already started on the second book in the series.\n\nApril 8, 2019\n\nScarlet has been able to see and communicate with ghosts since her 8th birthday when her deceased cat, Flapjack, made his first appearance. Now she and her constant companions talking cat, Flapjack, and British gent, Hayward, reside in Beechwood Harbor, a community filled with supernaturals. Ghosts are drawn to Scarlet, and she finds a way to help them cope and deal with death and those still living. However, things change when a violent ghost named Rosie demands Scarlet stop a reality TV crew from renovating the Lilac House. Rosie has abilities beyond any Scarlet has seen, and Rosie intends to use them to hurt the humans invading ‚Äúher‚Äù home.\n\nThe Ghost Hunter Next Door is the first cozy in the Beechwood Harbor Ghost Mysteries, a spin-off of the Beechwood Harbor Magic Mysteries. Although the series share the same setting and few crossover characters, this book is completely independent of the original series and one does not need to read it first. Being the first book in the series, time is spent acquainting listeners with the setting and primary characters. I enjoyed seeing Beechwood Harbor from the eyes of Scarlet, who is a pretty solitary soul.\n\nMany of the characters are, in fact, ghosts, including Gwen from the original series. Additionally, we meet Lucas, the hunky head of the show's security. For some reason, Scarlet feels a bond with Lucas, allowing her to share her secrets with him. And for once in her life, someone believes her and believes in her. I like that Scarlet has a confidant to help her solve the mystery, but more importantly, give her a much-needed close friend (and love interest). In the beginning, there was a slight suggestion of a potential love triangle with a local police officer, but it wasn't pursued at any length in this book, thankfully.\n\nThe mystery of who Rosie is and why she is such an angry ghost morphs into a pretty good murder mystery. I had fun trying to figure it all out as Scarlet and Lucas dig into the past. I really enjoyed the conclusion, especially how Scarlet gives Rosie the gift of peace.\n\nI‚Äôve been listening to Amanda Ronconi read the original series for a half dozen books now, and she has consistently done a wonderful job. This time around, the book is voiced from the first person POV of Scarlet, who has a different personality than Holly (original series heroine). Ms. Ronconi changes a little here and there to convincingly portray a new main character. Additionally, the three primary ghost regulars have distinct voices. While there is little difference between the each of the male characters‚Äô voices, the tone is deeper and fitting.\n\nIn the end, The Ghost Hunter Next Door is a solid kickoff for this new series. The story is both interesting and sweet. I like that Scarlet has someone she trusts and can confide in, and I love the blossoming romance between her and Lucas.\n\nMy Ratings:\n\nStory: B+\n\nNarration: A-/B+\n\nReview copy provided by Tantor Audio.\n\nMay 27, 2023\n\nDanielle Garrett's books are a welcome escape with cozy mysteries, heart touching romances, and sassy cats, her magical world of Beechwood Harbor is a place I wish I could move to. Her characters and stories are well written and draw you in from the first page to the last. She goes on my favorite authors list. Readers will not regret picking up The Ghost Hunter Next Door and binging every book in this universe.\n\nAugust 3, 2017\n\nI have read and enjoyed all the Beechwood Harbor books that Danielle Garrett has written. I was delighted to find this new book~sort of a spin-off~about a ghost whisperer in the same town. A slight cross over of characters made it all seem very real to me!\n\nThe main character in this book is Scarlet and she owns a flower shop. Unfortunately she sees ghosts all the time, and they have infiltrated into her life, not always peacefully. When a TV production company buys a property to renovate and turn into a bed and breakfast, they get a little more than expected in the form of one very p.o'd ghost. This ghost (Rosie) claims her fiance murdered her weeks before the wedding when she found him and her maid of honor, Wendy, at home in the bedroom during the day. For twenty years she has scared everyone away from the property. For twenty years she has been angry and plotted revenge. When Rosie learns of Scarlet's abilities, she forces herself on Scarlet and issues ultimatums. Worried about the crew's safety, Scarlet tries to solve the twenty year old mystery of Rosie's death. Of course there is a handsome guy who actually believes in Scarlet's abilities to help out as she tries everything possible to keep her promise.\n\nThis fast moving, well written book was entertaining up to the very end. I didn't expect what happened. I had a hard time putting the book down while reading, it was so captivating and enjoyable. I recommend it for a good and different paranormal mystery.\n\nMarch 30, 2019\n\nThis review was originally posted on Books of My Heart\n\nReview copy was received from Publisher. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.\n\nGhost Hunter Next Door is the first in the Beechwood Harbor Ghost Mysteries . I already know the town and even Scarlet, from the Beechwood Harbor Magic Mysteries . I recently reviewed Betwixt which has a variety of novellas set in the town, and one which introduces Scarlet.\n\nScarlet is more isolated and perhaps introverted than Holly. They both try to help others and enjoy their quirky new town. Scarlet ends up spending a lot of time solving a ghost issue which has nothing to do with her personally. It's just she's the only one who can help or will be able to solve it, because of her skills.\n\nIn spite of Scarlet's preference to not date, or get involved, or have anyone know about her skills, she ends up in the thick of things. She has more than one guy interested in her, but spends the most time with Lucas. That relationship has some potential so we will see if it goes anywhere as the series continues.\n\nThe series is a cozy mystery so it is light and a bit silly in some aspects. The writing is good and the story enjoyable. The books are relatively short, so they are quick. The books of both series are in Kindle Unlimited. I'm on to Ghost Gone Wild next.\n\nNarration:\n\nAmanda Ronconi is a favorite narrator and comfortable in this genre. I listened at my usual 1.5x speed. The voices were distinct for the small number of primary characters, both male and female voices. I enjoyed the performance.\n\nListen to a clip:\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-149056452...\n\nJune 29, 2023\n\naudiobook is my background noise to get things done and i get things done so id say thats good\n\nDecember 8, 2019\n\nUh... what happened?\n\nI had just finished reading the first book in the Beechwood Harbor Magic series, when this caught my eye. I really enjoyed Holly‚Äôs introduction, and a companion series about a ghost whisperer set in the same town sounded intriguing. However, I was not as keen on the characters in this book. The ghosts were pretty good, but Scarlet has issues with saying No to people (a big pet peeve of mine in characters), and Lucas was cocky and just rubbed me the wrong way. I think my favourite characters were the ghost cat and Gwen, and I liked the crossing over of series characters as we saw with the short scene of Holly and Scarlet at the Silver Siren Caf√©.\n\nMight give it another chance.\n\n2.5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nFebruary 1, 2018\n\nI found Scarlet to be smart, funny and a bit stubborn and I love her! I really loved the television series Ghost Whisperer and this book really reminds me of it in the best way possible- We have Scarlet (who at first fights her gift) who owns a flower shop in a small town. She is forced to help a rage filled ghost but along the way she enjoys helping the ghost.\n\nThe author creates such a charming small town feel while keeping the reader engaged and interested. I really enjoyed my trip back to Beechwood Harbor!\n\nRating ‚Äì 5 out of 5 cupcakes- I would recommend this book to any oe who enjoys cozy mysteries as well as ghost tales!\n\nMarch 28, 2023\n\nThis was ok. Just another cozy mystery about a 20 something with a desirable life, who also sees ghosts. Despite her opening of 'if you see ghosts, don't tell anyone' one if the first things she does is to tell the 'hot guy' her deep dark secret & of course he swallowed it. And of course she semi abandones her business to deal with ghosts, despite saying she wouldn't do that, her business is most important to her. It's not bad, but I'm not going to rate it 3 stars.\n\nJuly 10, 2023\n\nWowza! I need a break from exploring genres and get back to a cozy mystery with magic and supernatural occurrences. I decided to try another Beechwood Mystery. This time instead of Holly Boldt we follow Scarlet Sanderson. She's a ghost whisperer who runs a flower shop.\n\nThis mystery was great and it has been awhile since I read a Beechwood mystery book. I love that Danielle Garrett not only world builds in the book but she doesn't just sack characters in other series. Holly made an appearance in this book. I'm unsure of the timeline though because, Holly in this book still works at Siren Song Caf√©. Either way I missed this series, and I am glad that I am able to revisit the town somewhat. I wonder how the next book will go, and if some how Scarlet will be able to enter into the Havens or the Haven system.\n\nRelationship Wise: Scarlet has some similarities to Holly. She is trying to do live and help out the supernatural. There is a love triangle developing I think at least it was hinted upon. Lucas a film worker/security guy and the Sherriff whose name slips me I think his name is Jason. Jason (i think his name is) isnt really in the book. Mentioned like three times throughout the story. I wonder if his relationship will be expanded upon in the next books. Either way, I think that Lucas and Scarlet will have a more flushed out relationship in the books. There is a ghost romance with Gwen (who is a returning character from the Beechwood Magic Mysteries) and Hayward who is the ghost from England who tagged along with Scarlet to America. Flapjack a childhood pet cat of Scarlets come alive and talking. He's always kinda sassy and snarky but does add some comedy and sass to the story.\n\nMystery-wise: The mystery in the book was nice, it wasn't super tedious and it didn't out right give away the killer. However, there was some missing portions I felt. Like they didn't really allude or provide much clues. But nonetheless it was a fun read. In short, Lucas's film company comes to buy up an old house which is haunted by Rosie. Rosie manages to find Scarlet and warns her of the destruction that she will cause. Then the story goes into how Scarlet must find out why Rosie is so mad and how she perished. Which at the end was sad and yet heartwarming but I wont spoil it. You gotta read it!\n\nSo far, I do recommend this book!\n\nOctober 30, 2019\n\nThis was a nice surprise!\n\nScarlet sees dead people .... and because she is one of very few humans who can talk to ghosts, they are hunting her up for help.\n\nJust another ghost story? Maybe. But without all the drama and superficial complications other authors like to come up with. My first comparison would be the Charley Davidson series by Darynda Jones. But unlike Darynda's heroine this one here is special, but not unbelievably super special. And her love interest is not some condescending jerk but the guy-next-door in a pretty package. The humor is there everywhere, but not so obtrusive that you're not sure if you picked up a stand up comedy.\n\nOf course, no book gets away without critique: some edit errors (wrong words and such), not many, though. And the heroine confiding in a virtual stranger was a bit off. She did that twice, and then she was surprised that her big secret came out. Oh well. All forgiven, Miss Garrett, for an otherwise awesome story! :)\n\nAll this said - I picked up the next book of the series right after I finished this, even though it was high bed time - something I seldom do. Highly recommended!\n\nJanuary 29, 2023\n\nI really enjoyed this first book in the series. Scarlet is something of a ghost whisper who moved to the Beechwood Harbor community and opened her flower shop. Scarlet has been communicating with ghosts since her dead cat Flap Jack appeared to her when she was a child. When a TV show decides to renovate a house in the neighborhood, an angry ghost who used to live the house, comes to Scarlet demanding she do something to stop the renovations and we embark on a old murder mystery.\n\nI‚Äôm excited to see how this series will unfold. Beechwood Harbor is not your usual sleepy town. More like a paranormal community, Scarlet lives among witches and vampires and other supernatural beings, so I‚Äôm looking forward to their stories. 4 solid stars.\n\nFebruary 27, 2023\n\n4.5! Cozy ‚úîÔ∏è ghosts ‚úîÔ∏è a mystery ‚úîÔ∏è\n\nI loved all the characters except the love interest in this one (he is a man‚Äôs man and that just isn‚Äôt my ‚òïÔ∏è), but the story itself was engaging from start to finish.\n\nI was honestly shocked by the conclusion of the mystery which is always a plus. I hate figuring things out too soon.\n\nJuly 5, 2024\n\nA very fun bit of escapism. I listened to this on audible in a oner at work. I really enjoy this genre (cozy mystery with a bit of the paranormal) when it‚Äôs done well, and this was done really well. It was funny, light, entertaining, well observed, engaging, gentle and not too predictable. This was just right. A really good way to pass the time üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ.\n\nJune 3, 2020\n\nTotally enjoyed this audio book. I listened to it straight through! It has just enough humor and just enough mystery to keep me so entertained that I couldn‚Äôt stop listening. Terrific reader, too! Going to start book #2 ASAP.\n\nOctober 14, 2022\n\nFun and cheerful. Cozy supernatural mystery. Small tourist town, flower shop owner that sidelines as a ghost whisperer. Her closest friends are a ghostly cat, a long dead gentleman and a stage diving hippie Chic. It's a warm feel-good book.\n\nApril 4, 2023\n\nSuch a treat to have a paranormal cozy mystery with a protagonist who is already part of the world and knows how to use her skills. The story was equal parts of the main character teaching us about her world and also investigating a crime (where there was actually a logical reason for her to be involved, because she‚Äôs a ghost whisperer!) Will continue with the series.\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nFun and quick read - nothing deep or earth shattering which is sometimes just what we need. Perfect for short reading moments between the business of life. Can‚Äôt go wrong with throwing in a talking ghost cat!\n\nOctober 12, 2020\n\nEasy, enjoyable read. Liked that the book didn‚Äôt take its self seriously."
