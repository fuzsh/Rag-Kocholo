        "text": "Spooky season wouldn’t be the same without images of ethereal entities lurking in the shadows, and while these specters are meant to trigger imaginations while getting us in the holiday spirit, they allude to genuine anomalies.\n\nIt’s likely that you’ve heard stories of friends visiting psychics to reconnect with their dearly departed, and shows depicting ghost hunters and mediums offer demonstrations of real-life people talking with the dead. Though these TV personalities may have studied their craft for years, you don’t have to be a pro to experience such encounters. In fact, all you need to do is open yourself up to the possibility that there’s someone or something out there that wants to talk to you.\n\nWhen it comes to maintaining a connection with those who have perished, giving yourself space to find peace while opening up to your loved ones can help you feel close to those who no longer walk the physical realms.\n\n“In my culture, we believe that the most powerful way to connect to our ancestors is by connecting to ourselves,” says The Altar Within author Juliet Diaz. “Build a relationship with the self, and address the areas where you need healing and more care. We are the ancestors; they live through us, so when we connect to self, we connect to them.”\n\nWhether you’re feeling blue, need support from beyond the veil, or simply miss someone who is no longer around, going within can help you reclaim these relationships. Starting up a conversation by lighting candles to honor the dead and asking for signs are also great ways to form a line of communication with the souls who watch over you.\n\nCreating a sacred space that acts as an ancestral or spiritual altar can also help keep your connection with the other side strong. All you need is a small surface, table, or shelf dedicated to honoring the unseen elements of our universe. Decorate the space with photos of your higher power, loved ones who left this plane but never your heart, candles, and small trinkets that hold significant meaning. Jewelry, pens, hairbrushes, and other items frequently used by the departed can draw them to your space, helping you feel supported and at peace whenever you pause to contemplate life or meditate in your altar’s vicinity.\n\nConsider leaving out offerings of flowers, food, or drink on special occasions such as holidays and the departed’s birthday, taking into account what they were partial to when they were alive. You can keep your favorite incense, crystals, or tarot cards on the altar as well. Establishing a symbolic language is also helpful when nurturing a dynamic with your deceased loved ones. For instance, if your grandmother had an affinity for owls, you may begin to notice owl imagery with more frequency when her presence is near.\n\nThe dearly departed’s personal items can draw them to your space.\n\nPhantom scents can also help you acknowledge when an entity is in your midst, so the next time you catch a whiff of your great aunt’s cooking or your grandfather’s tobacco pipe, it could very well be their way of saying hello and showing support. These signs can manifest at any time. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for such messages. It’s also important that you are open-minded on how they may appear, as your social media feed, billboards, and TV commercials can all carry these symbols, even if the outlet itself doesn’t seem very sacred. The key is to look for a repetition of such imagery, and don’t be afraid to ask your loved ones to send signals that they’re near.\n\n“The most powerful way to connect to our ancestors is by connecting to ourselves.”\n\nMeditation sessions geared toward connecting with the other side can be particularly effective for receiving messages and are much easier than you might think. Begin with deep breathing, low lights, candles, and soothing music, bringing yourself to a place of calm. Once you feel tapped into your spiritual side, imagine the person you are hoping to contact.\n\nHolding a paper with their name written on it, a photo, or personal belongings they once owned can elevate this experience, and it may be wise to keep a pen and paper handy for taking notes. Imagine your soul connecting with theirs, and become aware of what goes through your heart, mind, and body throughout this meditation session. Just try to remember that fine-tuning this skill takes plenty of practice, and the information you receive at first may be subtle or hard to decode. Try to allow the energy to flow through you, and avoid the temptation to control where your mind leads you, as you could sever the connection you worked so hard to establish.\n\nFor a séance, light candles and place décor on the table.\n\nIf you want to be more theatrical with your encounters, hosting a séance can amp up your spooky season festivities as you and your closest companions gather to conjure the other side. However, you’ll want to keep the group small, aiming for a party of three to seven people. Arrange everyone in a circle, either around a table or sitting comfortably on the floor.\n\nBe sure to set the mood by lighting plenty of candles, keeping in mind that white, black, light blue, and purple are the most appropriate colors to work with. Lamps and flashlights can act as invaluable tools for this activity, though you’ll need to unscrew the bulb just enough for it to turn off. Give the light a little tap once it’s gone dim. If it flickers at your touch, you’ve hit the sweet spot, as entities may flash you with a bit of light to establish their presence.\n\nBegin the séance by leading a guided meditation, asking your companions to imagine the group encapsulated in a ball of white protective light, as this will deter any malicious entities that might try to spoil your fun. If the idea of encountering bad vibes makes you particularly nervous, you can keep selenite crystals nearby, as they’re known to draw in positive energy only.\n\nOnce you’ve established a sacred circle for you and your guests, dial into the other side by using such phrases as “I invite any spirits in the room to let their presence be known” and “I am now opening the lines of communication with those who have died, though no negativity may enter this home.” Be on alert for flickering candles or lights, and ask your friends to speak up if they feel any unexpected emotional shifts, strange physical sensations like tingling skin, labored breathing, thickness in the air, and temperature changes, as these all act as signs that a presence is near.\n\n“Make sure that you have connected with who you think you have connected with,” advises healer and psychic medium Shawana Temple. “Spirits have a lot to say, and uninvited guests can crash your session. Remain respectful, ensure that you are spiritually protected, and lean into your spirit team. Allow them to do the heavy lifting while you intuit the messages that come across.” Temple adds that if you begin to feel a little uneasy, don’t hesitate to send the entity packing by firmly asking it to leave.\n\nOuija boards can be particularly effective for digging up details during your ghostly interactions, though their presence in mainstream media has made them a somewhat taboo tool. The key to safely working with this communication device is to trust that you are protected by your ancestors, so try not to give in to feelings of anxiety or trepidation if they arise. It’s important to remember that entities cannot hurt you, though some like to have fun with our fear. This instrument is best used with two or three users operating the planchette while someone else takes notes to document each word as it is spelled out. Keep the questions simple. Queries such as “What is your name?” and “Do you have a message for anyone here?” are great ways to get the ball rolling.\n\nOuija boards are best used with two or three people using the planchette.\n\nWhether you’re hosting friends for a night of mystical fun or working alone, divination tools are an excellent option for peering beyond the veil. “As Samhain approaches on October 31 and the veil between worlds thins,” says psychic medium and witch Melissa St. Hilaire, “now is the best time to communicate with your spirit guides. Meditation is my favorite way to strengthen the connection, but sometimes we need a more tangible method. For this, I prefer using copper dowsing rods.”\n\nThis tool consists of two L-shaped pieces of metal and can be traced back to ancient times when it was used to find water, precious gems, or metals, and to communicate with spirits. Though it was banned by the Catholic Church in 1568, this instrument managed to survive centuries of scrutiny and is still employed today in cultures throughout the world. Its user will lightly hold a rod in each hand about a foot apart, establishing what constitutes a “yes” or “no” response from the other side, which will typically involve the rods crossing over each other or drifting apart. “To begin, invite your guides to join you,” St. Hilaire says. “Ask them to show you ‘yes’ and ‘no,’ then proceed to ask any binary questions you want.”\n\n“Now is the best time to communicate with your spirit guides.”\n\nPendulums are another excellent resource for finding answers from beyond the veil, and generally consist of a stone or metal cone hanging from a chain. However, if you don’t have one on hand, you can easily make one with a necklace or by tying a ring or weight to the end of a string. Begin by resting your arms in an L shape on a stable desk or table, holding the pendulum up without generating any movement. Once your tool is completely still, you can begin to ask simple questions.\n\nThe pendulum should begin to move naturally as you breathe, though the real magic manifests in observing the direction in which it swings. An up-and-down motion will indicate a positive outcome or “yes” response, as will a clockwise circle. If your piece swings from side to side or counterclockwise, you will find that the answer is “no” or the outcome may be negative.\n\nPendulums can be another way to communicate with ghosts\n\nMeanwhile, erratic movements could indicate that the future is yet to be determined. You can up the ante with this practice by writing down a series of questions on small separate papers, folding and mixing them up, then placing them in front of you. Without looking at what you’ve written, go through each piece of paper, writing down if the pendulum answered with a “yes” or “no.” Using this method will prevent your psyche from forcing the results it desires, as you’ll be unaware of which question you’re asking at any given time. Just be sure to unfold the parchment after you’ve gone through each piece so that you remain unaware of your query throughout the entire practice.\n\nNo matter which method you choose to explore the other side, remember to show respect and thank the entities you encountered for connecting with you. Once you’ve finished your session, ask these phantoms to go along on their way, sending them love while severing the lines of communication. It may also be wise to cleanse your space with rosewater, incense, or the smoke of purifying herbs, such as sage, juniper, or cedar. Then, treat yourself to a nice, hot Himalayan salt bath to purify and energize your aura, and be sure to recharge with plenty of water and nutritious food.\n\nRenée Watt is a Pacific Northwest-based professional psychic, astrologer, and witch.
