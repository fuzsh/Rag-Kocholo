        "text": "It’s just the way the human brain is wired; we have a need to know why things occur or what’s causing something. And when it comes to inexplicable, mysterious happenings, the only logical explanation is often the presence of something supernatural.\n\nWe Like to Believe There’s Life After Death\n\nMany people not only believe there’s life after death, they also believe that humans have led past lives. This is actually a common belief among many cultures and religions. This belief gives many people comfort when they lose a loved one or are faced with their own mortality. So for those who believe in the afterlife (and previous ones), it only makes sense that there are spirits lingering around.\n\nIt’s Thrilling\n\nIn the same way people are drawn to scary movies and terrifying roller coasters, believing that there are spirits of the dead looming around is just plain thrilling. Ghost hunters will tell you that they not only believe in ghosts, but they also don’t see them as evil spirits attempting to do harm. On the contrary, hunters believe ghosts are simply lost souls, searching for closure or are trapped and are trying to cross over to the afterlife.\n\nThere’s Proof\n\nWhat else could explain sudden cold spots, disembodied voices and footsteps, floating orbs appearing in photographs and the sensation that someone is touching your shoulder when no one is there?\n\nIf ghosts weren’t real, it’s unlikely that so many ghost hunters and paranormal experts would even exist, not to mention the many TV shows, websites and attractions that are dedicated to ghosts.\n\nNot All Houses Are Homey\n\nIf ghosts weren’t real, there wouldn’t be any haunted houses, right? And we’re all familiar with houses across America that experts have proven to be hotbeds of paranormal activity. In fact, according to a Gallop poll, 37 percent of people surveyed believe that houses can be haunted. And if you’ve ever watched the Travel Channel show America’s Most Haunted Places, you’re well aware of the phenomenon that takes place inside the country’s most haunted houses."
