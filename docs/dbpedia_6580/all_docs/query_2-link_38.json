        "text": "At long last, the trailer for Kristen Stewart’s gay ghost hunting show has arrived, and it’s looking bone-chillingly good.\n\nHulu dropped the trailer for the supernatural reality series on Tuesday, introducing us to the “Ghost Hunties,” a team of five gay experts on all things paranormal. That team includes Alex LeMay (whom the trailer calls a “tech expert”), Juju Bae (“witch”), Ken Boggle (“tarot card reader”), Logan Taylor (“psychic”), and Roz Hernandez (“paranormal researcher”).\n\n“I get to come out twice,” Taylor says at one point in the trailer, “for being gay and for talking to dead people.”\n\nThat sentiment seems to sum up the series as a whole, judging from the rest of the trailer. While there’s no shortage of classic creepy moments that might fit on shows like Ghost Adventures, there’s also lots of campy humor and camaraderie that you won’t find in those better-known genre staples. Over the course of eight episodes, the Hunties will bring that decidedly queer perspective to several haunted sites across America, including the Clown Motel and the Palomino in Nevada, the Copper Queen Hotel in Arizona, and the Waverly Hills Sanitorium and Palace Theater in Kentucky.\n\nIn a statement to People, Stewart said that Living for the Dead “started as a bit of a hypothetical silly pipe dream” that she dreamed up with her best friend and stylist CJ Romero. “Now I am so proud to have shepherded something that is as moving and meaningful as it is truly a gay old time,” she added.\n\nThe actor also said that the team of Ghost Hunties “makes me laugh and cry and they had the courage and heart to take us places I wouldn’t go by myself.”\n\n“This is just the beginning for us and for Living for the Dead,” Stewart told the entertainment magazine. “We wanna one day have traipsed across the entire spooky ass country. Maybe the world!”\n\nPersonally, we feel that there can’t be enough global gay ghost hunting media, so we’re eagerly hoping for more as well. Living for the Dead will premiere on Hulu on October 18."
