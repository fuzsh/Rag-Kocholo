        "text": "About This Thread\n\nThis thread tracks Sims 4 mods and CC that have been \"broken\" or made obsolete by game updates or declared unsupported by their creators. It also tracks updated game mods and major updates to custom content. If you use mods, this thread's lists and ongoing reports can help you prevent game errors and help you avoid having to do a 50-50 of all your mods. Consider subscribing to the thread to receive notifications by email (select \"Topic Options\").\n\nNOTE: This thread also covers the July 23–August 8 hotfixes.\n\nSome things are NOT covered:\n\nearly-access content\n\nvarious creators or mods because of the T (for Teen) game rating, EA Answers HQ rules, and the Maxis guidelines for Sims 4 content creators\n\nseparate translation files from someone other than the original mod creator; translation-only updates of mods themselves are marked \"transl.\" and are optional.\n\nnew mod add-ons and new alternative versions of mods\n\nCC updates that aren't clearly to fix an error that breaks the CC\n\nupdates to loading screens, CAS backdrops, and poses unless it's clear that the update fixed an error\n\nmini-updates (ones that don’t change the version number) of the Sims 4 Multiplayer mod\n\nIn the end, YOU are responsible for your mod use. Because not all content and creators are covered on this official forum, many of you should be following creators directly for news. The pinned topic How to Use Mods and CC includes advice about game updates, mod management, finding broken mods, and how to avoid downloading broken content. See the topic on Malicious Script Mods for further information on one kind of issue to watch for. And remember… Back up your Saves folder!\n\nIndex\n\nPosts are linked here when they have list content:\n\nNewly Broken/Obsolete Game Mods: patch 1.108\n\nUpdated Game Mods: compiled list of major updates and fixes to outdated mods\n\nBroken CC and Build/Buy Game Mods: patch 1.108\n\nUpdated CC and Build/Buy Items: compiled list of major updates and fixes to outdated CAS and Build/Buy custom content and Build/Buy game mods\n\nCore, Injector, Testing, and Protection Mods: Current Versions : look here for what you should be on for mods like ModGuard, Better Exceptions, venue lists, Lot51 Core, and XML Injector\n\nCreator-Cleared for patch 1.108: selective list of creators reporting their mods compatible with the game update\n\nNew Bugfix Mods\n\nCreator News\n\nPreviously Broken/Obsolete Mods and CC: selective lists\n\nStart of Ongoing Reports\n\nOther Resources\n\n[MASTER POST] Current and Common Mod/CC Issues, including links to earlier Broken/Updated Mods threads.

My DMs are also open for creators here and on Tumblr (luthsthings). I can be reached on Discord from many Sims 4 creators' and Sims 4 support servers.\n\nI do not respond to DMs for support unless I've asked you to DM me.\n\nSul sul!\n\nI don't work for EA, and I don't do private support.\n\nI do receive products from EA as part of the EA Creator Network.\n\nHave you backed up your Saves?
