        "meta_description": "Ghost Exorcism INC - Do you feel like you have the soul of an exorcist? Do you have the desire to send evil entities back to the afterlife? Would you prefer this thrill as a solo exorcist, or in a team?Ghost Exorcism Inc is a spooky game about exorcisms. The exorcist's mission is to cleanse entities that haunt locations such as castles, mansions, and abandoned houses. Exorcists will have several paranormal tools at their disposal; such as the EMF K2 detector, the entity analyzer, the threat detector, surveillance cameras, etc.Once the threat has been identified- you can follow the given exorcism protocol, using equipment such as the neutrino-gun, holy water, incense (and more) to send the supernatural entities back to where they came from.MultiplayerPlay alone or in a group of up to 6 players. More teammates means a higher chance of success when venturing into larger haunted locations.Speech RecognitionGhost Exorcism Inc will allow you to use your microphone to interact with the paranormal entities. They will listen to you and understand your requests, so be careful to not upset them!Proximity VoiceBe prepared to communicate with your team using the in-game proximity voice!Missions &amp; ProgressionSuccessfully complete contracts to earn money and gain experience. Higher levels will allow you to purchase more advanced equipment capable of exorcising even more dangerous entities.Various Entity TypesThere are several entity behavior profiles. Each entity will have a randomized type (Shadow, Poltergeist, Demon etc), set of evidence to collect, and behavior.Ghost AggressionHunting and exorcising is far from an easy task. The entities do not want you there, especially if you are trying to banish them from the living realm. Be prepared to defend yourself, and protect yourself.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, long time no see!\n\nWe first wanted to thank those who wished Ghost Exorcism Inc. a happy birthday, and yes, 3 years already since the release! A lot of developments in three years, lots of laughter and jumpscares, and it would never have happened without you and your support!\n\nWe're going to answer the most asked questions in recent months, with little sneak peaks of upcoming updates ;)\n\nIs the game still being developed?\n\nYes! The game is still under development. We have always been a very small team, but that does not stop us from moving forward.\n\nThe game being at an advanced stage in terms of entities, evidence, maps and type of contracts, we continue to work on the so-called \"comfort\" features. But also on one last map, because we can't help it...\n\nWhen will there be an official release?\n\nThis year! If all goes well, the game will be officially released at the end of 2024. Our efforts on the network, various optimizations and the game engine in general have reached a stage that allows us to release the game. The price will not change, the discounts will continue as they always have (long live halloween!) and we hope to be able to launch some challenges and continue small updates here and there in the future, after the release.\n\nWhere to find games online?\n\nWe have a small and passionate community, but that can mean it's more difficult for players to find public lobbies with players. If you're struggling to find random players to play with, we urge you to create a public lobby for yourself, so that you can allow others searching for games to join you. There is also a Discord community available here: https://discord.gg/ghost-exorcism-inc-845591054635761704 and several players in the Steam community, sharing game codes and tips!\n\nWhy not rescues with several entities?\n\nYou're right. Why not? Oh, I'm being told in the headset that it's currently being tested and will soon be in beta! Several of you (especially veterans) have asked for it. Rest assured it will be a done deal! Just like a classic multi-entity contract, the \"short\" mode will offer two entities and the \"long\" three entities in one contract. The equipment scattered on the ground, as well as the number of employees knocked out (in need of rescue) will be increased.\n\nSo, what's new between now and the release?\n\n- Some graphics optimizations\n\n- New colors for our friend the Wisp (he complained of always being the same...)\n\n- New map\n\n- QoL improvements (in the options, in the display of certain information, etc.)\n\n- New Multi-Entity Rescue game mode\n\nSee you soon! Oh, and exorcists... don't forget your Mary and crucifix!\n\n1 person found this review helpful\n\n0\n\nRecommended\n\n24.2 hrs on record\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nMe and my friends make a habit of playing of playing spooky games on a Friday if we are all free. Phas weekly challenge is the mainstay and we branch out to games like this every so often.\n\nI/we enjoy the spin on the ghost hunting games this one provides. It is a different atmosphere to phas in particular because you are not as powerless (salt and laser guns are fun if not a little OP) and a ghost getting you isn't an instant kill. We do still get decent spooks though because events and ghost actions can happen very suddenly and catch you off guard.\n\nThe goal of each level is in the name; unlike phas where you just identify, you need to do exorcism actions to expel the ghosts to 'win'. The multi ghost hunts puts a good spin on this because you need to pair the right actions with the right ghost.\n\nPlaying with friends, we like to play around with the exorcism book (writing funny spells to surprise each other with each time). I can imagine the game may lose some of its charm playing with randoms, especially if they are taking the game (what i would consider) too seriously. Certainly one for a group of friends than a solo online player i think.\n\nI image replay-ability takes a bit of a hit once you unlocked all the levels. I hope there is some extended features added to the game later to give you stuff to drive towards.\n\nI recommend this game for people who like other ghost hunting games but want something a bit different. Particularly if you are able to play with friends and don't take the game (or yourselves) too seriously."
