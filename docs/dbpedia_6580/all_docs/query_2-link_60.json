        "text": "One of Scotland's top ghost events companies has revealed some of the scariest places they've been to around Scotland.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Halloween, the expert team at The Scottish Ghost Company (TSGC), who host events across the country seeking out the supernatural, have spoken about the locations they've visited where the supernatural activity was strongest.\n\nThe TSGC, has over twenty crew members spread all across Scotland and the north of England, with experience in the area of paranormal investigations dating back decades.\n\nWhen asked what sites in Scotland they found to be the most 'lively' during their investigations, David McCabe, the lead medium, and paranormal investigator and host Yvonne Hydes revealed that both Jedburgh Prison and Drum Castle have been some of the most impressive.\n\nThe pair have a long history of interest in the supernatural, with Yvonne, a former nurse explaining that her time spent working in one of Scotland's notoriously haunted hospitals strengthened her belief in the afterlife after hearing and seeing some strange things on the wards.\n\nWhile David caught the bug after growing up being able to see people that others couldn't and eventually discovering how useful his talent could be while working as a security guard at a former mental hospital and joining in a ghost hunt there.\n\nWith over three decades of experience in the paranormal between them, they are keen to share their passion with others at these popular nighttime events.\n\nWhere they use a mixture of modern and traditional ghost hunting techniques to seek out the supernatural.\n\nDrum Castle, Aberdeenshire\n\nDavid explained that on one trip to Drum Castle they were able to successfully make contact one spirit, who he believes was an old dowager and the mother to one of the Earls.\n\nHe added that it was quite an eventful trip: \"It's the one place where I've actually seen a door opening in front of my eyes on numerous occasions.\n\n\"On a vigil in a drawing room with our guests, we heard footsteps coming along the corridor and we heard the door click before it creaked open and we saw the light from the hall coming in.\"\n\nJedburgh Jail, Jedburgh\n\nYvonne picked out Jedburgh Jail as one of her favourites, explaining that there is always something strange happening when they go there.\n\nShe said that on one occasion three crew members who entered the cells felt unwell at different points of the night.\n\nTech consultant Roy said that the jail is where he ended up with one gent, who was a sceptic, in floods of tears, after he and his wife were left alone in one cell famously said to be haunted by an angry male spirit.\n\nRoy said: \"As I waited outside in the corridor about 3 minutes in his wife shouted on me, and as I entered the cell the guy was standing there crying his eyes out after I took him outside I asked if he would like to go back into the top floor the answer was a definite NO.\"\n\nDavid added that other guests were also terrified by that cell.\n\nSara and David's brother Mark were doing an investigation in one of the cells in the Women's Jail when something poked her arm quite forcefully, to the point that she was convinced it must have been Mark.\n\nCraigievar Castle, Aberdeenshire\n\nParanormal practitioner and historian Sheila Walsh said that while on investigation there heard a noisy group of people coming up the stairs towards them but when they checked with the other team members and were stationary and not moving about.\n\nInveraray Jail, Inveraray\n\nSpeaking about one of her favourite locations, Sara said: \"So much weird stuff happens there. We've had great activity when we've been there from the Maglite tests (where they ask spirits to turn them on and off) and responsive taps and knocks to hearing footsteps and doors moving by themselves.\n\n\"In the New Jail, there is a dominant prisoner who inhabited the top floor and when I called out that we had men in our group who were here to challenge his authority, there was an almighty bang at the far end behind everyone.\n\n\"The big window had banged down and then gone back up and closed again and all of Roy's torches and equipment lit up at the same time too.\n\n\"I jumped up on Roy, near enough killed the poor man, everyone was screaming, it was great.\"\n\nSheila added that it isn't all scary stuff, she said \"On a nicer note at Inveraray three of us walked into the Women’s Prison and all heard a few bars of a woman singing what sounded like a lullaby.\"\n\nCulloden Battlefield\n\nParanormal practitioner Sara Chiappa visited the famous site recently and was spooked when she was able to hear the sound of guns being fired and men screaming in the distance.\n\nShe added that they kept hearing bagpipes playing through their ghost hunting equipment.\n\nGilmerton Cove, near Edinburgh\n\nSheila explained that one event, they used a table and glass (in place of a ouija board) to contact the spirit of a young boy but that a few minutes later, a \"hostile male energy\" frightened him away and tried to take over the glass, pushing Shiela's hand off quite forcefully.\n\nShe added that in the morning she noticed that where she was touched she had the perfect imprint bruise that was the size and shape of a thumb.\n\nPollok House, Glasgow\n\nThe group have had a few scary trips to Pollock House in Glasgow but on one occasion a few of the team members were spooked when a cabinet in one of the rooms clicked and opened itself in front of them.\n\nSara explained that they tried to make it happen again by moving around it and jumping up and down in front of it but they couldn't make it happen on their own.\n\nYvonne also pointed out that the team was able to film a clip capturing an EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) recording of a voice clearly saying \"You need to get out of here.\n\nHolmwood House, Glasgow\n\nOn a Halloween event at Holmwood in Glasgow, three of the crew were dressed as nuns but Yvonne explained it seemed the spirits didn't like that.\n\nShe said: \"We were using the ouija board when the planchette came flying across the board towards us.\n\n\"It wouldn’t communicate with us until they took their costumes off.\"\n\nFuture events\n\nIf you are interested in joining the group on a ghost hunting experience here's what you can expect.\n\nOn the night, those brave enough to be joining them will join David, Yvonne, and crew veterans like Roy Woolrich (who has 25 years experience) and historian Sheila to learn all about the history of the particular location.\n\nThe group will then be split into smaller teams who will join each of the experts to try to contact spirits using techniques like trigger items (where an object is placed for the spirit to interact) and modern ghost hunting gadgets including parabolic mikes, SLS cameras (Structured Light Sensor) and electromagnetic field readers.\n\nYvonne explained that if people are cynical, they should come along to an event and see for themselves.\n\nShe added: \"The people that are negative if they come along and one thing happens that they are questioning, there is guaranteed to be something else that happens that will change their mind. We can usually change their opinion.\n\n\"Of course, we have our own sceptics in the group who always try to explain things rationally and you need that.\"\n\nWhatever happens the pair are keen to point out that there is no fakery, if they don't get any results then they won't force the issue as they want to be as authentic as possible for their guests.\n\nAs Yvonne explains: \"There is no fakery, we need to make that clear. If you come along, what you see is what you get. Nobody is going to jump out and try and scare you. If we don't get anything, we don't get anything. We can't force them to communicate.\"\n\nThankfully, they add, it's rare that one of their events isn't a lively experience.\n\nShould you be interested in joining them for one of their incredible nights – they've events planned for Pollok House and Holmwood House in Glasgow, as well as the Renfrew Baths – you can find out about these and other future events on their website here or follow them on Facebook and TikTok."
