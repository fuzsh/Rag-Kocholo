        "text": "Dictionary is a free offline English dictionary containing over 200,000 words and definitions and no ads. Dictionary is ideal for both native English speakers and English learners or people studying the English language. The dictionary definitions are stored locally, and because it's ad-free there's no need for a network connection. The home page contains a randomly selected word cloud which will pique your curiosity and help you improve your vocabulary, while the search box allows you to find specific words easily. As you type, Dictionary homes in on the word you are looking for. Then you can follow the links in the definition page to get more word definitions.\n\nWildcard characters can be used to help with word games like crosswords and scrabble where only some of the letters are known, or you have to find an anagram, or with spelling. Definitions include synonyms and antonyms which allows the dictionary to also serve as a thesaurus. The speech function helps provide the correct pronunciation.\n\nYou can see your word history and revisit definitions, or make your own list of favourite words to help build up your vocabulary. It also works well if you only have an intermittent network connection because the definitions are stored offline, locally on the device. And we managed to keep data offline without needing a massive app download. There is also a \"word of the day\" with our pick of the most interesting and entertaining words in the English language. Dictionary works on tablets and phones and is refreshingly free from annoying ads and paid upgrades.\n\nThe My Piano Phone app turns your phone into any musical instrument that you desire to play with real sound quality.

Thanks !!!\n\n*** Listed among Gizmodo Essentials ***\n\nAre you a good Alchemist ?\n\nYou are tasked with rebuilding the universe, bit by bit, or rather Element by Element. Starting with just 6 Elements (no, not just 4) and combining them using your skills, wits and knowledge, you will unlock 1700 more and 26 Realms.\n\nDo you think you can you discover: Atomic Energy, Zeppelin, Chuck Norris, Atlantis or even ‘Angry Birds’ ?\n\nSimilar games include Doodle God, but please note that this is brand new, built from scratch, taking the concept directly from the old 80s ‘Alchemy’ and reinventing it in the process.\n\nIT’S HUGE !\n\nThe game includes 1600 discoverable Elements, but grows with updates and your suggestions. In fact if you have an idea for a combination or feel that two elements should react, the game provides a direct link for the suggestion.\n\nUNLOCK REALMS:\n\nAs you progress, you will find new Elements which will unlock more Realms\n\nSCORING AND TARGETS:\n\nA scoring system is included (but you can also have fun without it) that gives big rewards for target key Elements or unlocking new Realms. You also get a Target Element of the Day !\n\nONLINE SCORES:\n\nOnce you feel like bragging, you can post your World Discovery % and score on the Leaderboard. Leave a comment and tease your friends !\n\nFRIEND MODE:\n\nHave a friend who wants to play ? Check “Friend Mode” in settings.\n\nHINTS:\n\nFinding some key elements can be a (reasonable) challenge but it wouldn’t be fun otherwise. A multiple hint functionality that doesn’t spoil too much of the research process is available. If you are really stuck please check the companion app !\n\nWORLD STATUS:\n\nShows Realms. By tapping on an element tile you can see the reactions where it took part.\n\nWIKIPEDIA:\n\nHelpful and interesting, you can access an Element page by tapping on its name.\n\nENHANCE THE GAME:\n\nGet the companion “Alchemic Extras 7” !!!\n\nStep as fast as you can on the dark tiles, and try to avoid the light tiles. 13 game modes.
