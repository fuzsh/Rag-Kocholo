Keep in mind that our list applies only to viewers in the USA and does not imply availability in other countries. The USA Streaming Services that offer titles listed here are: Apple TV+, Disney+, Netflix, and Prime Video, plus a limited number from Hulu, iTunes, Max, and The Roku Channel. Note: The designation IMDb at the end of an entry means it is a hotlink to the Internet Movie Database entry for that title.\n\nLAST TITLE UPDATE: Aug 15, 2024; 7360 titles; 64 description languages. AppleTV+: 2036 titles. Disney+: 350 titles. Hulu: 7 titles. iTunes: 20 titles. Max: 3 titles. Netflix: 4636 titles. PrimeVideo: 307 titles. Roku: 1 titles.\n\nThis list is updated Tuesdays from information supplied directly to us by the streaming services. Just like we have a Master AD List of titles described in English, this is our \"Master List of Titles Described in Languages Other Than English\"! We hope you find it useful. NOTE: Each language's listing of titles is initially compressed to save load time and avoid screen reader problems."
