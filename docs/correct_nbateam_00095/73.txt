Toronto Raptors forward Charlie Villanueva was named to the NBA's all-rookie first team on Thursday.

Villanueva topped Eastern Conference freshmen in scoring during the 2005-06 season, averaging 13.0 points on 46.3 per cent shooting and adding 6.4 rebounds a game.

"I'm excited and honoured," said Villanueva, who was Toronto's top pick in the 2005 NBA draft andselected with the seventh pick in the first round.

"I had my doubters at the beginning but I continued to work hard to be the best that I could be for the Raptors. This was one of my goals and I'm glad it happened."

Villanueva joins Damon Stoudamire (1996), Marcus Camby (1997), Vince Carter (1999), Morris Peterson (2001) and Chris Bosh (2004) as Raptors who have been selected to the NBA all-rookie team.

Chris Paul of the New Orleans Hornets, the favourite to win the NBA rookie-of-the-year award, was the only unanimous selection for this year's team.

Paul led all rookies in double-doubles (21), scoring (16.1 points-per-game) and assists (7.8 assists-per-game). The guard also pulled down 5.1 rebounds per contest and averaged 2.24 steals per game.

Paul and Villanueva were joined on the team by Milwaukee's Andrew Bogut, Utah's Deron Williams and New York's Channing Frye.

Bogut, thetop pick in last year's draft, led all rookies in rebounding (7.0 rebounds-per-game) and blocks (.83 blocks-per-game).
