        "text": "David Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nThere was no magic in the disappearing act of Charlie Villanueva.\n\nWell, none other than the fact it actually took place.\n\nDecline wasn't supposed to be a part of his story, let alone its most pivotal piece. Not this soon, anyway, and certainly not in this era.\n\nThe sweet-shooting, 6'11\" scoring forward just celebrated his 30th birthday last month. He should be easing out of his peak right now, or even fending off Father Time with the requisite skills for the trendy stretch 4 position.\n\nHe isn't. As reported by ESPN Dallas' Tim MacMahon, Charlie V just inked a contract with the Dallas Mavericks, sans guaranteed money.\n\nFew in this game are in more need of a reputation repair.\n\nAn excruciatingly long five-year stay with the Detroit Pistons plagued his stat sheet and seemingly sapped all of his once-bright promise. Knowing this NBA move could be his last, this isn't about going to Dallas to showcase his skills—it's finding an end-of-the-bench seat that won't be pulled out from underneath him.\n\nCarlos Osorio/Associated Press\n\nConsidering the way Villanueva's story started, this plot twist can't be considered entirely shocking.\n\nESPN Insider Chad Ford (subscription required) cited \"questions about work ethic and so-so athleticism\" while projecting Villanueva to come off the 2005 draft board somewhere between No. 14 and No. 28. Draft Express noted how the then-UConn sophomore looked \"passive, disinterested at times, as if he's not giving 100 percent.\"\n\nThe Toronto Raptors, though, bought enough of Villanueva's boom-or-bust stock to pull him off the board with the seventh overall selection. In the process, they seemed to steer him toward a \"bust\" future, as his length and athleticism was a curious fit alongside the long, athletic Chris Bosh at best.\n\nAt worst, it had the potential of being \"one of the top-five worst picks in the history of the NBA draft,\" according to Grantland's Bill Simmons.\n\nDraft grades had Villanueva failing his NBA test long before he even received the exam.\n\n\"I get on the plane and pick up the paper and here I am on the front cover and it basically says how bad of a pick I was and all that, that I've got a bad attitude, all that stuff,\" he told The Courant's Desmond Conner in November 2005. \" ... I don't even know what I did.\"\n\nNathaniel S. Butler/Getty Images\n\nOn the floor, he gave analysts few reasons to criticize. He scored in double figures during his debut, had his first 20-point, 10-rebound during his sixth run of the season and repeated the feat his next time out.\n\nBy year's end, he owned the Raptors' single-game rookie records for points (48) and rebounds (18), and he had posted respectable per-game marks of 13.0 points and 6.4 rebounds. He joined Chris Paul, Deron Williams, Andrew Bogut and Channing Frye on the 2005-06 All-Rookie first team.\n\nVillanueva was better than advertised. He was not, however, the right complement for Bosh, and the Raptors sent him to the Milwaukee Bucks the ensuing offseason for point guard T.J. Ford.\n\nThen-Bucks general manager Larry Harris told reporters his team had \"solidified the power forward position\" with Villanueva, but the stat sheet never saw the addition as such.\n\nHe struggled to secure a permanent role and shuffled in and out of the starting lineup. He was decent during his first two seasons in Milwaukee (11.7 points on 44.6 percent shooting, 6.0 rebounds), but teams don't solidify positions with decency.\n\nThe light bulb above his head seemed to click in his third season there, and he set personal bests in points (16.2), boards (6.7) and three-point shooting (89 makes at a 34.5 percent clip).\n\nThat was when his story changed and, despite the production, it was not for the better. It netted him a five-year, $37.7 million contract from the Pistons, but all that did was reattach the bullseye he had worn to start his career.\n\nAllen Einstein/Getty Images\n\nHe, along with fellow free-agent addition Ben Gordon, were targeted to guide Detroit into its next chapter. Considering the previous section of Pistons' hoops included eight straight playoff runs, six consecutive trips to the Eastern Conference Finals and one world title (2004), the bar couldn't have been set any higher.\n\nAnd Villanueva never came close to reaching it.\n\nThat wasn't entirely his fault, either. Former Pistons general manager Joe Dumars had the foresight to envision the league's move to the pace-and-space offenses commonly seen today, but the executive never found the right key to unlock the versatile big man's game.\n\nDetroit needed a table-setting point guard. During Villanueva's first three seasons there, no one on the Pistons averaged more than 5.2 assists (Rodney Stuckey in 2011-12).\n\nVillanueva had to hunt for his own shots, but his leash to do so grew increasingly short. As his production sagged, his contract looked worse by the day.\n\nAs Vincent Goodwill of The Detroit News explained, Villanueva's salary, injury problems, reduced role and nosediving numbers all contributed to his fall from grace:\n\nVillanueva is probably the poster child for Pistons fans who hated seeing the team’s downturn after a glorious run. Villanueva parlayed some decent time in Milwaukee into a big deal with the Pistons in 2009, and never lived up to it.\n\nOnce the Pistons reduced Villanueva’s role, relegating him to occasional scorer and spot-up shooter, he couldn’t even deliver on his limited opportunities. His open threes came up short and flat, and nagging injuries contributed to his underachievement.\n\nThe Dramatic Decline of Charlie VillanuevaSeasonMPPTSTS%REBOff RtgDef RtgPER08-0926.916.252.96.710610618.609-1023.711.952.64.710811016.010-1121.911.155.33.910911115.911-1213.57.048.43.710010116.212-1315.86.848.13.510110614.013-149.04.646.91.79911012.7\n\nBasketball-Reference.com\n\nVillanueva's combination of size and skill never translated to the stat sheet as it should have, but the blame behind his disappointing box scores is hard to assess.\n\nSome of it belongs to him.\n\nThat inconsistent motor never clicked on all cylinders. Reports of his wavering commitment to the game seemed at least partially substantiated by his getting cut from the Dominican Republic's national team due to conditioning concerns in 2012.\n\n\"Charlie was not in good form when we saw him,\" the team's head coach John Calipari told Deportes en la Z, per Goodwill, via Eric Freeman of Yahoo Sports. \"He was overweight, and unfortunately, we could not slow down the entire team and it was a decision taken collectively.\"\n\nAs Michigan Live's David Mayo noted in January, \"more than one Pistons coach has deemed Charlie Villanueva too much of a defensive liability for his quick-strike offensive promise.\"\n\nAs those offensive strikes hit their mark less frequently (he shot below 39 percent from the field each of his last three seasons), his defensive deficiencies became even harder to stomach.\n\nBruce Bennett/Getty Images\n\nYet, it's hard to put this troubling tale entirely on his shoulders.\n\nWas he a victim of expectations, doomed by the prominent platform through which he entered the league? That feels like part of the problem. He was defined by his draft status in Toronto and his contract in Detroit, both of which resulted from someone else's work.\n\nAnd what about the offenses and roles he was thrown into? Could more creativity and freedom have led to a different outcome? Those doubts aren't easy to erase, considering the success he enjoyed at different times during his career.\n\nIf he can parlay this non-guaranteed contract into a roster spot with the Mavericks, he might have a chance to rewrite his story. Few coaching minds are sharper than Dallas' Rick Carlisle, and this offense obviously understands how to utilize stretch bigs (see: Nowitzki, Dirk).\n\nThe odds are stacked against him, as Dallas has 15 guaranteed contracts on the books already. But the Mavs could opt to keep a stretch big behind Nowitzki, so Villanueva's fate is far from determined.\n\nAs with his departure from relevance, no magic will be needed for his potential reemergence. Some elbow grease, perimeter prowess and the luck that has eluded him up to now just might do the trick.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, statistics used courtesy of Basketball-Reference.com."
