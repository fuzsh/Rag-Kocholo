        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nA near-7-footer, he had good hands and small-forward skills. Long and athletic, he could line up at any of the three frontcourt positions. Was able to regularly hit from beyond the arc and was an above-average scoring big man when on a roll. Did a solid job of limiting turnovers, too. Eventually, he no longer took great advantage of his excellent size in the paint and spent far too much time on the perimeter. Was highly inconsistent in general. Did not defend or pass as well as he could have, and usually seemed to play better off the pine than as a starter."
