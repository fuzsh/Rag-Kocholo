        "text": "This weekâs episode of Run Your Race was a special one for me. Growing up in Toronto, I naturally was a Raptors fan (not anymore, lol. Shout out to the terrible fanbase). I started watching basketball when I was about ten years old, and that was the height/peak of Vinsanity in Toronto. It wasÂ a very specialÂ time to be a Raptors fan in a country where hockey was still dominant, and it felt like it was the sport for minorities with such huge success, relatively speaking. There were some really dark days after that whenÂ Vince Carter was traded.Â\n\nÂ\n\nWe had a chance to sit down with Charlie Villanueva, the 7th overall pick in 2005. The feeling feels mutual between me (and the city, from my understanding) and Charlie V. We loved him in his short tenure as a Raptor, and he loved his time in the city as well.Â ItÂ would makeÂ sense coming from a New Yorker in aÂ cityÂ that isÂ considered a baby New YorkÂ lol.Â But before we get to the NBA part of his career, letâs first shout out to Charlie for his college career. Charlie is a National Champ and played on arguably one of the most talented college teamsÂ of all timeÂ with the 2004 UCONN Huskies. They featured a team with Ben Gordon, Emeka Okafor, Denham Brown, Josh Boone, Marcus Williams, Hilton Armstrong and Charlie Villanueva. Thatâs a total of 7 pros.Â\n\nâ\n\nWith all that being said, some of the things to expect to hear in this episode are that championship season and a surprising court storm from a blue-blood team ð. He also talks about how the Toronto Raptors organization did him dirty and gives us perspective on Kobe Bryantâs 81-point game, and itâs a hilarious one ð¤£.Â\n\nÂ\n\nYou donât want to miss out on this episode of Run Your Race - check it out below!\n\nâ\n\nâ"
