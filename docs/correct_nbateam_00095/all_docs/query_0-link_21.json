        "text": "18 hours! That’s just how fast everything can change for players. You can lose your position because of an injury or simply get traded to another team. Former NBA player Charlie Villanueva, who once faced the stinging reality of betrayal by one of the league’s renowned franchises, shared his experience with it. Trading is always a tricky decision for both players and the team. It is really hard to find a player and talent ideal for a position up for trade.\n\nBack in 2006, the Toronto Raptors traded Charlie as well as offered cash for TJ Ford. During a conversation on the Run Your Race podcast, Charlie revealed that the Raptors’ head coach at the time, Sam Mitchell, assured him that they would only trade him if Michael Jordan came out of his retirement. Charlie humored the listeners, saying that he would himself get traded if that were to happen.\n\nNow, as veterans might be aware, a trade is bound to happen if the executives mention it. The trade took place just a few hours after he received the assurance. “24 hours later, I was gone. Not even, they ain’t give me a full not even 20 maybe 18 hours. They didn’t even give me a full day,” Villanueva said on the podcast. After a good rookie year, it was surprising for the 6’11 tall PF to see this go down. But he already had a feeling as the Raptors drafted 7-foot tall Italian center, Andrea Bargnani, as the 1st pick in the 2006 NBA Draft.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIt was hard for Charlie to stomach the bitter betrayal from the franchise he cherished and had been loyal to. However, such betrayals are common in the league. NBA veteran Lamar Odom’s relationship with the Los Angeles Lakers never improved after the team tried to trade him and Pau Gasol in 2010. Nevertheless, Villanueva was more affected by the way he found out about the trade.\n\nCharlie Villanueva on the unpleasant way he found out about the trade\n\nIn the same podcast, the 2004 NCAA champion shared that he found out about his trade through a third party. It was his brother who heard the news first and then talked about it with Charlie. Even when he called his agent about this, there were no updates. However, just an hour later, he got a call from the franchise to inform him about the trade which sent him to Milwaukee.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRaptors president and general manager at the time, Bryan Colangelo, said, “We are sorry to see Charlie leave, but getting better comes at a cost. T.J. Ford’s best attributes, quickness, and playmaking, are a perfect fit for our team.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nVillanueva added that while he understood the team’s need for a point guard, the betrayal still hurt him. “I get it at that time they needed a point guard but I was hurt,” Charlie said. But it looks like the Raptors regretted making that trade. After spending 3 years with the Bucks, he entered the free agency in demand. And the first team to call him was Toronto. While he wanted to go back, he had made up his mind to never play for the Raptors again. He even circled the games against Toronto on his calender.\n\nThe NBA is a business. Unfortunately, some people have to find that out the hard way."
