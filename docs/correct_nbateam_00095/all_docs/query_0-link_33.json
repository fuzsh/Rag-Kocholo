        "text": "Being enamored with Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo isn’t anything new for the Pistons, but the two sides aren’t likely to embark on a trade any time soon. The Boston Globe reported the Pistons offered guard Brandon Knight and an expiring contract — either Rodney Stuckey or Charlie Villanueva, as cap relief — for Rondo, who’s recovering from an ACL tear. The Celtics would want Andre Drummond, who’s obviously not available and won’t be, and the Pistons want to see how the frontcourt of Drummond, Greg Monroe and Josh Smith play together before making any deals to drastically alter their foundation.\n\nThe power forward for the Detroit Pistons, Charlie Villanueva, announced yesterday via his Twitter account that he will not be a part of the National Team of the Dominican Republic that will participate in the FIBA Americas Championship in Caracas, Venezuela. Villanueva posted three photos, including one of his tattoo of the Dominican flag and added a message. “I will talk about the issue of the DR (Dominican Republic) now, so they do ‘not lie to me, as they did last year. Thanks, and I love my country so much,” he wrote. “I will concentrate my game in the United States because this is an important year for me. Love my country but I’m just focused on my family and career,” said Villanueva."
