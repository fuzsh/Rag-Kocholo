        "text": "ORLANDO – Detroit Pistons forward Charlie Villanueva doesn't know if he'll be with the team next year. He has a contract. But with the various options at the Pistons' disposal – a trade, the amnesty clause, the stretch provision – there certainly is a possibility that the third-highest-paid player on the team could find himself somewhere else next season.\n\nIt isn't something he ponders much, he said.\n\n“I can't worry about things I can't control,” Villanueva said. “I'm just going to finish out these next couple of games, whatever we have – I think we're promised nine games – and if coach calls my name, I'll be ready to play.”\n\nTo say that Villanueva is out of the Pistons' rotation would be a gross understatement.\n\nIt took a 119-89 blowout loss to the Orlando Magic to get him onto the floor Monday night, one night after he was one of two Pistons who didn't play in a 23-point rout by the Miami Heat.\n\nVillanueva scored 10 points. He had not made a field goal all year until the third period – the 227th quarter of the Pistons' season.\n\nEven with the Pistons trailing hopelessly, in a performance head coach Lawrence Frank blasted as “unacceptable,” Villanueva said he was surprised to be summoned to play.\n\n“I didn't expect it,” he said. “But that's life sometimes. You get things thrown at you that you don't expect. I went out there and just tried to play as hard as I can and tried to make the most of it.\n\n“It felt good being out there, playing basketball again, in a game. It felt good.”\n\nVillanueva's season started with a bum ankle which threatened his season.\n\nOnce he returned, he still didn't play.\n\n“It's been a long time waiting,” he said. “It's been hard, frustrating, the past couple months, from the injury, to getting back in shape, to not being able to play. It's very frustrating.\n\n“It's been a terrible year for me, as far as the injury, just being out, just not being able to be on the court and whatnot. But sometimes, you've got to hit rock bottom in order to bring yourself back up. So that's the mentality I'm taking.”\n\nTeammates quietly have wondered why Villanueva hasn't gotten more opportunity to play. The obvious reason is deficient defense under a first-year coach, in Lawrence Frank, who naturally gets free rein during his honeymoon season.\n\nBut Villanueva also is one of the most-liked players on the team, and while his attitude has been completely admirable, it hasn't translated to a chance to develop a role on this team.\n\nAustin Daye, who essentially plays the same role, called Villanueva's season “unfortunate.”\n\n“He never really had a good shot,” Daye said. “But it's hard when you don't practice, then he was hurt. A lot of things were thrown at him. But he got on the floor tonight, and hopefully, he'll get in a couple more games.”\n\nVillanueva said all he can do is continue to stay positive and hope to get a chance in the season's final two-plus weeks.\n\n“At the end of the day, we've got to be professionals, and we've got to do our job,” he said. “Regardless what the circumstances are, whether we're a playoff team or not, we've got to go out and do our job.”"
