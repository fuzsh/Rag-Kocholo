He played fifteen seasons, winning six championships and five MVP awards. He turned the basketball court into his kingdom and was hailed by all as His Airness. His legacy is marked by one of the most iconic shoe brands â€” a testament to his soaring and leaping style of play, which was unlike anything the league had seen before."
