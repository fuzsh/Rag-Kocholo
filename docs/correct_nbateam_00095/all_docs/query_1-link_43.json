        "text": "This is almost 2 weeks old, and maybe I missed it on here, but found this to be very interesting.\n\nAs most remember, Stephen A. Smith went in to classic Remember-Me-Ranting mode on NBA Draft night when the Raptors took Charlie Villanueva, saying \"…this pick makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, all due respect to Charlie Villanueva, he’s gonna be a solid pro but you already have Chris Bosh. But when you think about the fact that this team got hoodwinked when you traded away Vince Carter virtually for nothing AGAIN we sit here today wondering what the, ON EARTH is Rob Babcock doing?!\"\n\nI thought it was a mistake at the time as well, as most did. But if Villanueva proves to be a very good player or it looked to have been the right pick, you humbly admit you were wrong and you move on.\n\nNot Stephen A.\n\nSmith is now putting those comments in a different light, saying his words have been twisted, that he was only criticizing Rob Babcock, that it was a good pick because Villanueva and Bosh are both playing the forward positions, and not one playing the center position. He's also now saying that Babcock didn't make the pick, that Sam Mitchell and Wayne Embry made it and Babcock wanted Antoine Wright (source). Smith goes on to say that since Babcock has been fired, he was fully justified in the point of his comments.\n\nAll of this in the above paragraph is in this video interview done by a Canadian station -- and Stephen A. TORE IN to Raptors fans that have been emailing/calling him about Villanueva:\n\nhttp://www.thescore.ca/video/413.asx\n\nWhat I find really funny about this (other than the obvious - Stephen A.'s monster ego taking center stage) is that Smith blasted the selection at the time ... but now says he was only blasting Rob Babcock but also says Babcock didn't make the pick. ???\n\nThis reminds me of Orlando GM John Weisbrod. Terrible GM who made bad moves and was justifiably canned, but he clearly made the right choice in the Dwight Howard vs. Emeka Okafor debate.\n\nFollow up articles that are interesting:\n\nMitchell credits Babcock\n\nhttp://www.torontosun.com/Sports/Basketball/2006/04/08/1525684-sun.html\n\nCharlie's OK with Smith\n\nhttp://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Basketball/NBA/Toronto/2006/04/05/1520942-sun.html\n\nI understand people getting upset with Smith seemingly backtracking, but I don't understand what the big deal is.\n\nEveryone knew CV would be a solid scoring pro.\n\nEveryone's issue was about where this guy was going to play. No sane basketball analyst would look at 220-pound Bosh and flighty Charlie and determine that these two lottery picks would be playing alongside each other for the next 15 years. Babcock was rightfully flamed for using a lottery pick on a player who would have a hard time scraping minutes out next to his team's best player. The minutes themselves weren't the issue, it was the minutes that the two players would or would not be able to play ALONGSIDE each other.\n\nRight now, a lineup with Bosh and CV playing alongside each other have played the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth and seventh-most minutes on the Raps (with Bosh playing 5 and 4, and CV playing 3 or 4). Ideally, you HAVE to have both of those players in 1-3-most minutes. These are your best two players and they have to be able to stay on the court.\n\nAnd even with all the advancements the Raps have made this season, does anyone see a comfortable pairing between CV and Bosh (at whatever positions) for 40 minutes a night next season?\n\nBabcock needed to either trade down, trade up, or trade CV and whatever else for a better wing, PG or center and whatever else. And yet, the man was hilariously gunshy on trades -- refusing to trade Donyell Marshall to a contender last year, refusing to pull the trigger on the Jalen Rose trade (that has turned that franchise around), etc.\n\nAgain, SAS' backtracking (Babcock didn't make the pick) makes him look foolish, but his original thoughts (\"this pick makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, all due respect to Charlie Villanueva, he’s gonna be a solid pro but you already have Chris Bosh!\") were right in line with what I was thinking, so I can understand where he was coming from. We've been defending it all year (hating on Babcock, not CV). Of course, because I too have a massive ego and like to toot my own horn, I was the first to eat crow, back on November 21st :\n\nKelly, you saying you knew CV would be a solid pro? PLEASE!, man everyone and anyone was ripping on the Raptors, it was the \"it\" thing for you guys to do.\n\nThe Raptors had said all along that they could see Charlie V. playing the three, this was at the pre-season, however with Jalen Rose playing at that position they were loaded at SF. Therefore, once he got traded it opened up playing time for him there, and that's where he shined. (And the Raps knew it might happen)\n\nI admit Babcock is/was a horrible GM, but the guy has to get his props for drafting him. He got a guy that WANTED to play in Toronto (unlike Frye/Green). Plus secondly he got a guy that most people predicted to be drafted after the TOP10. That's the only thing he did well, along with getting RID of his own mess, Skip. Other than that the Raps have never had a 'real' GM until NOW. Once we get Pryzbilla or Nazr & Rudy Gay, this team is gonna be a contender.\n\nLastly, SAS is an a $ $.\n\nFrom what I remember there was a thread here at that time about Charlie V. (beginning of the season) , where someone asked you what you thought of him. I think you said that you don't rate players until the season started or something like that. Which means that you didn't think he would be a 'solid scoring pro'.\n\nAnyway if I am wrong, I apologize, I just thought you did. I am kind of amazed that a guy who writes for CNNSI is chilling at clutchfans, it’s very cool, that’s why I remember what you wrote, but I may be wrong."
