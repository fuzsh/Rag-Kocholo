        "text": "“It’s good to have guys like that [Cuban and Carlisle] on your back, on your side, but I can’t get satisfied at all,” said the 6-foot-11, 232-pound Villanueva. “I’ve got to keep grinding. I’ve got to keep working. I’ve got to keep getting better every day.” Villanueva said he considered signing with the Los Angeles Clippers, but just got a better vibe from the Mavericks’ front office. He also said he’s not using training camp as an audition to showcase himself to other teams. “My mentality is here,” Villanueva said.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks signed Villanueva to a non-guaranteed contract this summer. And even though the Mavericks already have the NBA maximum of 15 players with full or partially guaranteed contracts, they’re not against dumping one of those players to create a roster spot for Villanueva. “We’re just going to pick the best players,” owner Mark Cuban said. “I don’t care what their contract is. I’m happy to [eat a contract]. I don’t care.”"
