        "text": "Former NBA starCharlie Villanueva is counting his blessings today ... revealing he's ultra thankful to be alive after he was involved in a bad car crash earlier this week.\n\nThe former Milwaukee Bucks forward said on his Instagram page Wednesday night that he and his wife, Lala, were riding in a Mercedes G Wagon when someone hit them from behind.\n\nThankfully, the 39-year-old ex-hooper revealed no one was seriously injured in the wreck -- though in pictures he shared from the crash scene, you can see his car was almost completely destroyed.\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\n\"If you wondering what happened, my wife and I got hit bad by another car, and the crazy part is that whomever hit me, decided to run,\" Villanueva said.\n\n\"Sore neck, sore back, messed up car, we are thankful to see another day. Our lives can’t be replaced, but the vehicle can.\"\n\nVillanueva -- who played 11 seasons in the NBA -- praised God for keeping them safe.\n\nHe then went on to leave a message for those who've dealt with similar scary situations this year.\n\n\"2023 is just preparing us for 2024,\" Villanueva said. \"So to those whom 2023 has been a difficult year, a year of struggle be thankful, and don’t give up, because once you come out of the storm, you’ll see your true power.\""
