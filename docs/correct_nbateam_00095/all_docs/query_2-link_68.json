        "text": "From Pistons to playoffs: 7 recent players still going\n\nWhen Charlie Villanueva signed a five-year contract with the Detroit Pistons in the summer of 2009, he was attracted to the franchise's tradition.\n\nBut he got five seasons of dysfunction, losing and no playoffs.\n\nHe joined the Dallas Mavericks last off-season and, after 10 NBA seasons and 594 games, finally will take part in a playoff game for the first time when Mavericks face the Houston Rockets in Game 1 on Saturday.\n\nVillanueva, 30, had possessed the longest active streak without an NBA postseason appearance.\n\n\"It's going to be exciting -- I can't wait,\" Villanueva told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on Wednesday. \"This is where the real season begins. You've got to be thankful for getting 50 wins (because) that's big for our organization. Now you've got to buckle down and get ready to play in the postseason.\"\n\nThe Pistons finished this season 32-50 and missed the playoffs for sixth straight season. Here's a look at other recent former Pistons now with playoff teams.\n\n■ Boston Celtics forward Jonas Jerebko: Was traded at the Feb. 19 deadline and has carved out a bench role.\n\n■ Celtics wing Luigi Datome: Also moved in deadline deal. Has shown more with the Celtics than with the Pistons, though in sporadic playing time.\n\n■ Milwaukee Bucks forward Khris Middleton: Part of the 2013 deal that brought Brandon Jennings to the Pistons. Has been a revelation this season and averages 13.4 points per game.\n\n■ Washington Wizards point guard Will Bynum: Spent six seasons with the Pistons before being traded in October. He was a late-season pickup of the Wizards.\n\n■ Houston Rockets forward Josh Smith: Remember that guy?\n\n■ Atlanta Hawks forward Austin Daye: The Pistons' 2009 first-round pick has resurfaced with 10-day contracts in Atlanta."
