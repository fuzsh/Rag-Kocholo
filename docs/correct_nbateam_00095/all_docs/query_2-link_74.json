        "text": "Former NBA forward Charlie Villanueva and his wife Lala Alvarez are grateful to be alive after he said they were “hit bad” in an alleged hit-and-run car accident earlier this week.\n\nVillanueva — a UConn product who played 11 seasons in the NBA — shared a photo Wednesday on his Instagram showing his damaged Mercedes G Wagon, which appeared to be hit from behind.\n\n“One thing we never take for granted is leaving the house and making it back home,” Villanueva, 39, wrote in his caption. “If you wondering what happened, my wife and I got hit bad by another car, and the crazy part is that whomever hit me, decided to run.\n\n“Sore neck, sore back, messed up car, we are thankful to see another day. Our lives can’t be replaced, but the vehicle can.”\n\nVillanueva indicated in the comments he recently purchased the Mercedes G Wagon for his wife’s birthday and “didn’t even have it for two months” at the time of the accident.\n\nThe former first-round pick did not share exactly where and when the incident happened.\n\n“Thank you God for protecting us,” Villanueva continued in his post. “We must walk in faith not by sight. 2023 is just preparing us for 2024.\n\n“So to those whom 2023 has been a difficult year, a year of struggle be thankful, and don’t give up, because once you come out of the storm, you’ll see your true power.”\n\nThe couple tied the knot on July 24, 2021, in Dallas, Texas, after Villanueva proposed to Lala on New Year’s Eve 2020 Nick & Sam’s, a steakhouse where they had their very first date.\n\nVillanueva has two children from a previous relationship.\n\nLala is former sports reporter and influencer who currently works as a designer and realtor in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, according to her LinkedIn.\n\nVillanueva was selected with the No. 7 pick by the Toronto Raptors in the 2005 NBA draft, and went on to play for the Bucks, Pistons and Mavericks before retiring in 2016.\n\nHe finished second in points and rebounds among rookies and made the All-Rookie First Team.\n\nVillanueva won an NCAA title with UConn in the 2004-05 season."
