        "text": "Demi Moore and Bruce Willis reunited for a blended family celebration in honor of their daughter, Tallulah Willis.\n\nThe exes, who share three kids, posed for snaps on Tallulah’s milestone 30th birthday Saturday.\n\n“Showering our @buuski with love today on her 30th birthday ♥️,” the “Ghost” actress captioned an Instagram post, which showed the trio smiling in the backyard of what appeared to be a Los Angeles home.\n\nThe birthday girl stood between Moore, 61, and Bruce, 68, with a soccer ball in her hand as she rocked a casual navy blue sweater and maroon track pants.\n\nThe carousel post also featured a photo of the mother-daughter duo posing with Tallulah’s boyfriend, Justin Acee, and her big sister Scout Willis.\n\nAlong with Tallulah and Scout, 32, the former couple, who were married from 1987 until 2000, are also parents to Rumer, 35.\n\nBruce, for his part, shares daughters Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9, with wife Emma Heming Willis, whom he wed in 2009.\n\nMoore has remained close with the “Die Hard” actor, particularly after he was diagnosed with aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).\n\nJust this week, she urged families of dementia patients to be “present” amid her ex’s battle with the brain disorder.\n\n“I think the most important thing I could share is just to meet them where they’re at,” she told Andy Cohen during a SiriusXM Town Hall.\n\n“When you let go of who they’ve been or who you think, or even who you would like them to be, you can then really stay in the present and take in the joy and the love that is present and there for all that they are –– not all that they’re not.”\n\nThe “Feud: Capote vs. The Swans” star initially issued a joint statement with Heming and their five daughters in March 2022 to reveal Bruce would be retiring from acting.\n\nAlmost a year later, the family confirmed he had also been diagnosed with FTD.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis,” they said in a statement on the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration website.\n\n“FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone. For people under 60, FTD is the most common form of dementia, and because getting the diagnosis can take years, FTD is likely much more prevalent than we know.”\n\nThe “Pulp Fiction” actor’s family noted that there is no cure for FTD, which can cause personality changes, speech difficulty and motor impairment.\n\n“Bruce has always found joy in life — and has helped everyone he knows to do the same. It has meant the world to see that sense of care echoed back to him and to all of us,” the statement went on.\n\n“We have been so moved by the love you have all shared for our dear husband, father, and friend during this difficult time. Your continued compassion, understanding, and respect will enable us to help Bruce live as full a life as possible.”"
