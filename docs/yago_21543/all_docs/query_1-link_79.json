        "text": "Celebrity divorces are rarely amicable. But one Hollywood power couple bucked tradition in the early '00s with their enviably diplomatic split.\n\nDemi Moore and Bruce Willis tied the knot in 1987 just a few months after first meeting and welcomed three children during their 13-year marriage.\n\nBy all accounts, their time together was mostly marital bliss. Moore and Willis had three daughters; Rumer, Scout and Tallulah and appeared to be tinsel town's most wholesome A-list family.\n\nWhich is why it came as a shock in 1999 when the couple announced their separation. However, what followed may have inspired the curiosity of their family, friends and fans even more.\n\nREAD MORE: Jim Carrey's controversial stunt at the 1997 MTV Movie Awards\n\nREAD MORE: The 'poisonous' tension between Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart\n\nMoore and Willis' divorce was finalised in 2000, however their split news didn't ignite a year of mud-slinging headlines and ugly prenuptial agreement leaks.\n\nInstead, the pair remained close friends, openly speaking about their post-marriage adoration for each other as they continued to co-parent their three children.\n\n\"I still love Demi. We're very close,\" Willis told Rolling Stone in 2000. \"We have three children whom we will continue to raise together, and we're probably as close now as we ever were.\"\n\nEmma Stone and ex Kieran Culkin reunite in backstage moment\n\nThe Die Hard star added: \"Our friendship continues. The institution has been set aside … It's difficult to live your life and marriage under a magnifying glass, which is what happens to movie star couples.\"\n\nMoore echoed this sentiment with a line in her memoir, Inside Out. \"It's a funny thing to say, but I'm very proud of our divorce,\" she wrote, referring to her longtime friendship with Willis.\n\nThere was undeniable proof of Moore and Willis' friendly relationship in 2003, when the Ghost actress began dating actor Ashton Kutcher.\n\nMoore and Kutcher, who had a 15-year age difference, met in 2003 and debuted their relationship on a red carpet shortly after.\n\nThough their age-gap was the talk of the town, Moore was determined no-one could speculate about the status of her relationship with her ex-husband.\n\nOver the course of her relationship and subsequent marriage to Kutcher, the trio – Moore, Willis and Kutcher – were pictured together countless times.\n\nWillis joined his ex-wife and her new beau at several red carpet events, often with their three daughters in tow.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\nTheir blended family appeared to be the picture-perfect image of a happy divorce.\n\nIn June 2003, the whole clan were pictured at the premiere of Charlie's Angels 2 - Full Throttle, a moment that both debuted Moore's new romance and proved to the media that Willis was happy with the arrangement.\n\nThe unlikely trio were also snapped in 2004 enjoying the festivities at Willis' 49th birthday.\n\nREAD MORE: Delta Goodrem's moving appearance at the 2003 ARIAs months after her cancer diagnosis\n\nBy 2008, Willis' new wife Emma Heming Willis had joined the family and appeared at many red carpet events with her new husband, his ex-wife and her new husband.\n\nIt was an unconventional picture, particularly when it comes to Hollywood, but for some time, it seemed to work.\n\nThat is, until 2011 when Moore and Kutcher's marriage came to an end. The couple had been married for six years and had lost a child to miscarriage during that time.\n\nTheir split also resulted in several revelations about their romance, including how Kutcher really felt being thrust into a blended family.\n\nREAD MORE: Moment in 1998 that made Matt Damon and Ben Affleck Hollywood stars\n\nKutcher would later speak openly about the experience of having three stepchildren at the age of 26.\n\n\"I was 26, bearing the responsibility of an 8-year-old, a 10-year-old, and a 12-year-old,\" Kutcher told Esquire in January 2023. \"That's how some teen parents must experience their 20s.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing makes you feel like a failure like divorce.\"\n\nThe Willis children also later admitted they weren't too fond of their parents' divorce and the young age of their new \"step dad\".\n\n\"It was definitely weird for a minute, but I have to commend him,\" Rumer told Howard Stern in 2015. \"He was a really great stepfather. The perspective switched quickly.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Anna Nicole Smith's 14-month marriage to a billionaire\n\nThe Willis-Moore family, while temporarily frayed by divorce, have now banded together stronger than ever after news of the actor's battle with dementia and aphasia.\n\nIn March 2022, Bruce Willis' family announced that the actor had been diagnosed with aphasia, a condition that affects language and communication abilities.\n\nAfter a career in film spanning over 40 years, the actor revealed he would not be returning to the big screen due to his declining health.\n\n\"The focus for Bruce is to keep him active. He has a busy schedule with activities every day."
