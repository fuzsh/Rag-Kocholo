        "text": "Demi Moore and Bruce Willis were once one of Hollywood's most iconic couples. They dazzled everyone with their talent and charm, but after 13 years of marriage, they decided to part ways.\n\nDespite their divorce in 2000, Demi and Bruce remain good friends. They continue to co-parent their daughters Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah Willis.\n\nTheir love story is quite a tale. They fell for each other quickly and got married just months after meeting. Even though their marriage ended, they stayed close friends and even attended each other's weddings to new partners.\n\nREAD NEXT: Bruce Willis' daughter Tallulah shares update on her dad amid actor's dementia decline\n\nThe first time Demi and Bruce met was at a movie premiere\n\nDemi and Bruce first saw each other at the premiere of the action-comedy Stakeout in 1987. Demi was there with her then-fiance, actor Emilio Estevez, who starred in the film.\n\nDemi Moore and Bruce Willis had a whirlwind romance that started just weeks after Demi ended her engagement with Emilio. She was instantly drawn to Bruce, who was just starting to make it big in Hollywood. She said Bruce was \"just so ready to embrace and give me love.\"\n\nThey got hitched in a spontaneous Las Vegas wedding\n\nGetting wed at the Golden Nugget hotel in 1987, just four months after they met, in her memoir Inside Out, Demi admitted their wedding wasn't planned.\n\nShe wrote about how the idea came up while they were gambling in Vegas: \"We were moving to the gambling tables when Bruce said, 'I think we should get married.' We'd been joking about it on the flight there, but suddenly it didn't seem like he was kidding.\"\n\nThe couple later had a bigger ceremony with friends and family, where singer Little Richard officiated.\n\nThe couple welcomed three daughters\n\nOn August 16, 1988, Demi and Bruce welcomed their first daughter, Rumer, named after British writer Rumer Godden. They made sure to always have one parent available for Rumer by coordinating their schedules and projects.\n\nDemi Moore shared about Bruce Willis' role as a doting dad, saying: \"Bruce helped pull this baby out of me,\" and added: \"He was there with his hands. ... He's as passionate and as excited and as driven with being a father as he is with anything else that he does.\"\n\nIn 1991, they welcomed their second daughter Scout, and three years later, their third child Tallulah. Bruce expressed his love for fatherhood in a 2013 interview, saying: \"Your kids need your love and attention, and being able to devote myself to them is very fulfilling,\" and added: \"As I get older, spending time with my daughters makes things much easier. You learn to put your ego aside.\"\n\nShock separation\n\nAfter 11 years of marriage, Demi and Bruce announced their split in 1998 due to \"irreconcilable differences.\" They didn't officially divorce until two years later. Post-breakup, Bruce admitted that being a couple in Hollywood was tough, but they became \"closer than they ever were.\" after their romantic relationship ended.\n\nDemi and Bruce remained close pals after their divorce, focusing on raising their three kids. During a Comedy Central roast, Demi humorously referred to their marriage, saying: \"After our divorce, he said he considered the end of our marriage his biggest failure, but Bruce, don't be so hard on yourself, you've had much bigger failures.\n\n\"I mean Planet Hollywood, 'Hudson Hawk,' 'Striking Distance,' campaigning for Michael Dukakis, turning down Clooney's role in 'Ocean's Eleven' to focus on playing the harmonica?\"\n\nSupporting each other's new marriages\n\nDespite their own love story ending, both Demi and Bruce found new partners and even attended each other's weddings. Post-divorce, Demi was the first to walk down the aisle again, marrying That 70's Show star Ashton Kutcher in 2005.\n\nThe couple first met at a dinner through a mutual friend in 2003 and started dating soon after. They got married in Beverly Hills two years later, with a grand celebration attended by 100 of their loved ones, including Bruce, Demi's ex-husband.\n\nAshton and Demi were married for six years before they divorced in 2011. The split was reportedly due to Ashton's alleged infidelity. In her memoir, Demi wrote that when she confronted Ashton about his supposed cheating, he blamed it on the threesomes they had previously had together.\n\nDemi also attended Bruce's wedding to his current wife, Emma Heming, in 2009. The ceremony took place at his home in Parrot Cay, Turks and Caicos. Both Demi and Ashton were there to support the newlyweds. Bruce and Emma are still happily married and have two daughters, Mabel Ray and Evelyn Penn.\n\nBruce no longer recognises Demi\n\nSadly, Bruce no longer recognises Demi due to his declining health from dementia.\n\nBruce reportedly no longer recognises his ex Demi due to his ongoing battle with dementia. Despite severe memory issues, he is still able to recognise his current wife Emma and his daughters at times."
