        "text": "Hollywood Power Couple in the Making\n\nAfter meeting at a movie premiere in 1987, sparks between Bruce Willis and Demi Moore started flying. After she ended her relationship with then-fiancé Emilio Estevez, the two started dating.\n\nIn September, they looked giddy as made their red carpet debut at the 39th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nIn November, the pair got married in a spontaneous Las Vegas wedding. “We were moving to the gambling tables when Bruce said, ‘I think we should get married,'” Moore remembered in her memoir, Inside Out, per People. “We’d been joking about it on the flight there, but suddenly it didn’t seem like he was kidding.”\n\nBecoming Parents\n\nIn 1988, less than a year after tying the knot, Moore and Willis became parents to Rumer, now 35, in August.\n\n“Bruce helped pull this baby out of me,” Moore said at the time, per People. “He was there with his hands. … He’s as passionate and as excited and as driven with being a father as he is with anything else that he does.”\n\n2 Becomes 5\n\nWillis and Moore went on to welcome two more daughters, Scout and Tallulah, in 1991 and 1994, respectively.\n\n“Having a goal of being a good dad and being a good father is much more important to me than how my movie does this weekend,” Willis once told NBC. One proud dad!\n\nOfficially Exes\n\nIn 1998, Willis and Moore decided to call it quits. In 2000, their divorce was finalized.\n\nTalking to Rolling Stone about their breakup, Willis already hinted that they would always be connected no matter what. “I still love Demi. We’re very close. We have three children whom we will continue to raise together, and we’re probably as close now as we ever were,” the Die Hard star told the outlet. “We realize we have a lifelong commitment to our kids. Our friendship continues. The institution has been set aside.”\n\nDemi Gets Married\n\nA few years later, in 2005, Moore got married to fellow actor Ashton Kutcher.\n\nLooking at the pictures over the years, it seems the blended family got along swimmingly, even attending events together as a family.\n\n“I loved those kids like my own kids, and I helped raise them until Tallulah was 18 when we got divorced,” Kutcher told Howard Stern in 2015, per Us Weekly.\n\nDemi and Kutcher were married for six years until their split in 2011. Their split was final in 2013.\n\nBruce Gets Married\n\nA few years later, in 2009, Willis married his second wife, Emma Heming.\n\n“She welcomed me into her family like I welcomed her into ours,” Heming told Us Weekly. “I have so much respect for how Bruce and Demi worked through their divorce to be able to put their children first. I learned so much from that and grew so much from watching that.”\n\nWillis and Emma share daughters Mabel, 12, and Evelyn, 10.\n\nAltogether\n\nAt the premiere of House Bunny in 2008, the entire blended family showed their support for Rumer’s new movie.\n\n“We’ve become like a tribe,” Willis once told W, per People. “It’s generated a lot of interest because everyone can understand resentment and envy in the breakup of a marriage, but they don’t understand how I can get along with my ex like that. Demi and I made a choice to put the kids first, and we’re really lucky that it turns out we all have fun together.”\n\nSo Much History\n\nIn the roast, Moore even commented on their divorce. “People wonder why our marriage came to an end, and in all honesty, I think it was because some jealousy started to creep in. I think Bruce never really got over the fact that I rocked the bald look better than he did,” she joked, per Entertainment Tonight.\n\n“After our divorce, he said he considered the end of our marriage his biggest failure, but Bruce, don’t be so hard on yourself, you’ve had much bigger failures,” she said. “I mean Planet Hollywood, Hudson Hawk, Striking Distance, campaigning for Michael Dukakis, turning down Clooney’s role in Ocean’s Eleven to focus on playing the harmonica?”\n\nUnited Front\n\nWhile Willis and Moore haven’t been photographed together since this picture in 2019, taken during Moore’s memoir launch, it’s no secret that she has continued to be by his side since his diagnosis of aphasia and frontotemporal dementia. In fact, in addition to living together in 2020, the entire blended family announced the news back in 2022.\n\n“To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,” the 2022 statement wrote. “As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”\n\n“We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him. As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up’ and together we plan to do just that.” The note was signed by Emma, Demi, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel and Evelyn."
