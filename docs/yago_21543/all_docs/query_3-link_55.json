Me too. I liked them together as well,” Emma captioned the snap, adding a smiley-heart emoji.\n\nDemi and Bruce married in 1987 after dating for four months and share three daughters together: Rumer, Scout and Tallulah. But after 11 years of marriage, the couple split in 1998 before finalizing their divorce in 2000.\n\nBruce went on to wed Emma in 2009 and the pair share two daughters together — Evelyn Penn, 8, and Mabel Ray, 11.\n\nLast month, Bruce’s family celebrated the actor’s 68th birthday.\n\nTo help mark the occasion, Demi posted a video to social media that featured his family — including Emma and his kids Mabel Ray; Evelyn Penn; Rumer, 34; Scout, 31; and Tallulah, 29 — singing “Happy Birthday” as the Pulp Fiction star — who fans noticed was missing a tooth — looked on with a big grin.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“He is so loved. And I’ll be loving him always,” Emma gushed.\n\nEmma also paid tribute to Bruce as they celebrated their recent 14th wedding anniversary. “Today marks 14 years of marriage to the greatest love of my life,” she wrote in an Instagram message.\n\n“Seize every opportunity to unite and celebrate with family and friends. Those are the moments and beautiful pockets of memories that you get to hold on to for a lifetime,” Emma wrote. “And we get to keep those memories safe and alive for the ones that might not be able to … On our 10th wedding anniversary we decided to renew our vows in the same place we said ‘I do’ back in 2009. I’m so happy we did.”\n\nBruce stepped away from acting last March after his family revealed he was suffering from aphasia — a neurological affliction that leaves a person unable to communicate.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHis condition has worsened and in February his family confirmed that the Hollywood icon is suffering from frontotemporal dementia.\n\n“FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone,” Bruce’s loved ones wrote in a statement on the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration website.\n\nIn a message last month, Emma said that going forward she is making it her mission to “raise awareness” about the disease and advocate for “caregivers.”\n\n“I’m going to turn my grief and anger and my sadness into something good around something that feels less than,” she said.\n\n“Watch this space,” she added, “because I didn’t come to play.”\n\nmdaniell@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
