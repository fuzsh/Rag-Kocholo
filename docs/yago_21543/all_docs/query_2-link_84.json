        "text": "Bruce Willis' wife Emma Heming Willis is taking part in an advanced brain health study amid the actor's dementia diagnosis.\n\nEmma took to her Instagram Stories to share her latest action as she continues to advocate new health studies and treatments. The 46-year-old model shared a clip of the study she is currently a part of, including what appeared to be blood samples in a laboratory.\n\nShe captioned her video clip: \"Participating in an advanced brain health study. Exciting and hopeful things are on the horizon for neurodegenerative diseases.\" She ended the clip with the hashtags #Hope and #brainhealthawareness.\n\nIt comes as she continues her work into researching brain health as well as bringing awareness to the condition Hollywood icon Bruce has, Frontotemporal Disease (FTD).\n\nLast month, Emma - who has been married to Bruce for 14 years and shares daughters Mabel, 12, and Evelyn, 10, with the star - shared a poignant message from the actor amid his dementia battle.\n\nIt came as Emma shared the story of Spencer Cline and his future brother-in-law Paul who were cycling across America to raise vital funds and awareness for FTD. Admitting she has sponsored them $1 per mile, Emma also shared how Bruce would tell them to make sure they \"hydrate\" as they continue on their epic journey. She wrote alongside a video clip: \"Part 2 of 3 FTD Advocacy Updates... A huge shout to @spencer_cline22 and his future brother-in-law Paul, who are cycling their way across America. There aren’t even pro cyclists!\n\n\"This is just wild! But that’s the effect FTD leaves on us. It makes us passionate and motivated to work for change and to just be seen. Lemme tell you something, we see you Spencer and Paul! I can also see you guys are getting media coverage out there too! I can imagine what Bruce would say, 'I hope they remember to hydrate.' I second that. Stay strong and safe out there! I’m so proud of you guys.\"\n\nIt's one of many posts Emma has shared in her bid to raise awareness of the disease. Die Hard star Bruce was diagnosed with the FTD last spring. His health battle was first announced the year prior when his family revealed he was suffering from a language disorder called aphasia. Patients that suffer from the condition can also have several otherr of symptoms, such as unusual behaviours, emotional problems, trouble communicating, difficulty with work, or difficulty with walking, according to The National Institute on Aging."
