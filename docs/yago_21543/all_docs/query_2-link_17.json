        "text": "Emma Heming Willis, the wife of Hollywood legend Bruce Willis, shared a rare photo of her husband on Wednesday as the pair celebrated Valentine’s Day at Niagara Falls.\n\n“Love is a beautiful thing,” Heming Willis, 45, captioned the photo of her and her husband in front of the legendary falls in upstate New York. “Wishing you all a Happy Valentine’s Day.”\n\nIn the image posted to the social media site, Willis, 68, can be seen wearing a grey puffer coat. Heming Willis wears a contrasting black coat while leaning into her husband’s shoulder.\n\nSeveral of Willis’ fans wished the couple a happy Valentine’s Day.\n\n“I hope you have a day filled with love,” one user gushed.\n\n“Sooooo sweet. Sending love to you both,” a second fan wrote.\n\n“You can see the pure love and joy in this picture,” proclaimed a third person.\n\nThe rare photo of the “Die Hard” actor comes after he took a massive step back from public life when his family announced that the actor was diagnosed with aphasia. He was later diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in February 2023.\n\n“While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis,” his loved ones said in a joint statement at the time. “FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone.”\n\n“Bruce has always found joy in life — and has helped everyone he knows to do the same. It has meant the world to see that sense of care echoed back to him and to all of us.”\n\nJohns Hopkins University defines FTD as a group of disorders that occur when nerve cells in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain are lost. FTD can also affect behavior, personality, language and movement.\n\nThe former British model revealed during a September 2023 interview that she did not know if her husband, whom she married in 2009, knew what was happening.\n\n“It’s hard to know,” she said to Hoda Kotb on the “Today” show while holding back tears.\n\nHeming Willis was joined by Susan Dickinson, CEO of the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration, during the appearance.\n\n“What we know is, obviously, the disease can start in the frontal or the temporal lobes,” explained Dickinson. “And one of the things that the frontal lobe controls is self-insight.\n\n“So we really don’t know some people that’s the first thing they lose is any understanding that they themselves have changed,” she continued. “And other people retain that for a long time.”\n\nIt was announced by sources close to the family in December that the “Pulp Fiction” actor had “good days and bad days.”\n\n“In the last two months, there are many more bad days than good,” the insider alleged to Us Weekly. “This experience has brought the whole family even closer together. No one knows how much time Bruce has left, so they’re soaking up every moment they get with him.”\n\nA second source claimed that Willis’ family has been staying at his home.\n\n“Once Bruce was diagnosed, everyone came together to keep his memory of the family intact and to be there as a constant reminder [that they] love him. [Everything] revolves around him,” the source claimed.\n\nAccording to a third source, Willis’ ex-wife, Demi Moore, with whom he has three daughters, has been the primary “facilitator” for bringing everyone together.\n\nMore recently, Heming Willis announced that she planned to release a book about caregiving based on her experience with her Golden Globe-winning husband.\n\n“For me knowledge is power, and building a supportive community around me has been vital,” Heming Willis, 45, said in a statement to People magazine. “It has brought stability and a certain amount of control back, control that was completely shattered when the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia first came into our family’s world.”\n\nThe untitled book is intended to be a resource for people with loved ones who are currently afflicted with dementia and will reportedly include interviews, advice from experts, and insights from Heming Willis’ personal experience."
