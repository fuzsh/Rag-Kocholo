        "text": "Family and friends alike have shared their delight at the news.\n\nBruce Willis and Demi Moore are officially grandparents. The former couple’s eldest daughter Rumer Willis and her partner Derek Richard Thomas announced the birth of their daughter Louetta Isely Thomas Willis on Instagram, writing: “You are pure magic. Born at home on Tuesday April 18th. You are more than we ever dreamed of.”\n\nEmma Heming, Bruce Willis’s wife, wrote: “We love her so so much.”\n\nDemi Moore, 60, and Bruce Willis, 68, who were married from 1987 until around 2000, have remained in each other’s lives since separating, and the family regularly gathers together for functions and celebrations. Moore and Willis share two other daughters, Scout Willis, 31, and Tallulah Willis, 29, and Willis has two more children with Heming, Mabel Willis, 11, and Evelyn Willis, eight.\n\nRumer described the family’s joy at the prospect of the new baby to People just a few weeks ago.\n\n“[My parents] are so excited. My sisters are so excited, and it’s so fun to be bringing in the first grandkid in our family, especially because we’re such a huge group at this point,” she said.\n\nThe news offers some welcome positive respite for the family, who have been dealing with Bruce Willis’s diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD).\n\nHis wife Emma marked the actor’s 68th birthday last month with an honest post about her husband’s condition. “I have started the morning by crying, as you can see by my swollen eyes and snotty nose,” she admitted in a video she posted to Instagram."
