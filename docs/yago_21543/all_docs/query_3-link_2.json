        "text": "Moore and Willis were married from 1987 until 2000 and share three children, Rumer, 33, Scout, 30 and Tallulah, 28.\n\nIt’s not the first time the unconventional exes have shared a home in recent years.\n\nThe family – including Willis and Moore’s three adult children – spent time quarantining together in Idaho at the height of the pandemic.\n\nWillis’ new wife, Heming, was delayed in joining them after a medical emergency involving one of their two young children. However, the trio eventually flew from Los Angeles to be with the others.\n\nIn 2021, Moore opened up about their unusual pandemic arrangement to Naomi Campbell for her YouTube series, No Filter With Naomi.\n\n“There’s been a lot of challenges and a lot of tragedy with the pandemic, but I also think there’s been a lot of gifts and blessings,” she said.\n\n“I personally feel like I was really grateful for things slowing down and the time that we had … It has allowed us to re-evaluate what’s important.”\n\nAround that time, a source close to the former couple told Page Six that the stars had always had “a very unusual divorce”.\n\n“Even when Demi was married to Ashton [Kutcher, from 2005 to 2013], they always had a very close relationship. Demi was right there at Bruce’s roast on Comedy Central in 2018,” the source said.\n\n“The whole family is very supportive of him and have tried to make things good for him.”\n\nEven without blood ties, Moore and Heming share love for the other’s girls.\n\n“Our family, regardless of what the shape of it is, it’s important to keep together and for the little ones to feel comfortable with me and to know me so they also know their sisters better,” Moore told Campbell.\n\nThe news of the new living situation comes just a few weeks after the family revealed in a joint statement that Bruce had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD).\n\n“While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis,” Heming, along with Moore, and Willis’ five daughters, said in a statement on the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration website.\n\n“FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone. For people under 60, FTD is the most common form of dementia, and because getting the diagnosis can take years, FTD is likely much more prevalent than we know.”\n\nHis family explained that there is no cure for FTD, which often sees patients suffer personality changes, speech difficulty and motor impairment.\n\n“Bruce has always found joy in life and has helped everyone he knows to do the same. It has meant the world to see that sense of care echoed back to him and to all of us,” the statement went on.\n\n“We have been so moved by the love you have all shared for our dear husband, father, and friend during this difficult time. Your continued compassion, understanding and respect will enable us to help Bruce live as full a life as possible.”\n\nWillis’ family first announced he would be stepping away from acting last March after being diagnosed with aphasia — a condition that can affect a person’s ability to speak, write and understand verbal and written language."
