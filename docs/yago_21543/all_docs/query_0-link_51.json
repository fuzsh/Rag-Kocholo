        "text": "Emma Heming Willis, Bruce Willis’ current wife, loves his closesness to his ex Demi Moore.\n\nEmma, who has been married to the Die Hard actor since 2009, showed her appreciation for the close bond between Bruce and Demi on social media.\n\nThe model, 44, reposted a heartwarming tribute on her Instagram Stories on Tuesday after she came across a collection of photos a fan had uploaded to celebrate Bruce Willis’ 68th birthday on 15 March.\n\nShe specifically shared a black and white photo of Bruce and Demi, who were married from 1987 to 2000, seemingly taken on a film set.\n\nAfter fans shared messages praising the former couple for creating, “such a supportive blended family,” Emma added, “Yeah. Me too. I liked them together as well,” along with an emoji of a smiling face with little red hearts around it.\n\nBruce and Demi have three daughters together: Rumer, 34, Scout, 31, and Tallulah, 29. With Emma, he has two daughters, Mabel Rae, 11, and Evelyn Penn, eight. Rumer is also expecting her first child.\n\nIn February, the Moonlighting star’s family announced that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia – for which there is no treatment – and that he has “challenges with communication”.\n\n– Cover Media"
