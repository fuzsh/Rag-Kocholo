        "text": "July 1987: The first meeting\n\nDemi and Bruce's long romance story began at a movie premiere in Los Angeles.\n\nThe actress was attending the premiere of Stakeout while out with her then-fiancé, actor Emilio Estevez.\n\nWhy Pierce Brosnan and wife Keely's 20-year marriage is so beautiful\n\nIt was here that the future couple would first meet.\n\nSoon ending her relationship with Emilio, she began dating Bruce.\n\nNovember 1987: The wedding\n\nDespite only meeting less than a year previously, the pair went on an unplanned trip to Las Vegas, where Bruce asked Demi to marry him.\n\nThe couple then got married inside their suite at the Golden Nugget hotel, with only a small number of guests in attendance.\n\nNicole Kidman and Keith Urban: A timeline of their beautiful relationship and family\n\nSpeaking in her 2019 autobiography, Demi said: \"We were moving to the gambling tables when Bruce said, 'I think we should get married.' We'd been joking about it on the flight there, but suddenly it didn't seem like he was kidding.\"\n\nA month later, the couple had another ceremony, this time as a typical Hollywood wedding in front of their famous pals.\n\nIt is Bruce's first marriage, while Demi was previously married to singer Freddie Moore for five years before splitting in 1985.\n\n1988-1994: Growing a family\n\nIt has been reported that Demi actually fell pregnant on her wedding night, with daughter Rumer being born in August 1988.\n\nThe couple later welcomed two more daughters: Scout in 1991 and Tallulah in 1994.\n\nRumer is also an actor, having starred in films such as Hostage and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and the TV series 90210 and Empire. She also won season 20 of Dancing with the Stars, and has appeared on Broadway.\n\nTallulah is also an actor, while Scout has a career as a singer and actor.\n\n1998: Splitting up\n\nIn 1998, after over a decade of marriage, the couple released a statement saying that they were breaking up.\n\nThey said at the time: \"Bruce Willis and Demi Moore have announced they are ending their marriage after 11 years. They were married on November 21, 1987.\"\n\nIt was reported that the couple had been living apart for months due to busy film schedules.\n\nThe couple's divorce was then finalised in 2000.\n\nHowever, the pair continued to co-parent their children together, and have stayed great friends.\n\nSpeaking soon after the divorce, Bruce told Rolling Stone: \"We have three children whom we will continue to raise together, and we’re probably as close now as we ever were. We realize we have a lifelong commitment to our kids. Our friendship continues.\"\n\n2005: Demi re-marries\n\nAfter two years of dating, Demi married actor Ashton Kutcher in a private ceremony at their home in 2005.\n\nBruce was even a guest at the nuptials.\n\nDid Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet ever date? A timeline of the inseparable pair's relationship\n\nHowever, the couple divorced in 2013.\n\nAshton went on to marry his childhood sweetheart and former co-star Mila Kunis, and they now have two children.\n\n2009: Bruce re-marries\n\nIn March 2009, Bruce married his model partner Emma Heming, who is 23 years his junior, in an intimate ceremony in Turks and Caicos.\n\nThe couple had met through friends, and dated for a year before getting hitched.\n\nDemi and her then-husband Ashton were guests at the wedding.\n\nSpeaking in 2009 about how their family works, Bruce explained: \"It's generated a lot of interest because everyone can understand resentment and envy in the breakup of a marriage, but they don't understand how I can get along with my ex like that.\n\n\"Demi and I made a choice to put the kids first, and we're really lucky that it turns out we all have fun together.\"\n\nIn 2019, Bruce and Emma renewed their vows, saying they \"wouldn't do it without\" Demi there.\n\n\"She welcomed me into her family like I welcomed her into ours,\" Emma told Us. \"I have so much respect for how Bruce and Demi worked through their divorce to be able to put their children first. I learned so much from that and grew so much from watching that. It was important for her to be there.\"\n\n2020: Lockdown together\n\nThe former couple surprised many when it was revealed that they had been quarantined together for four weeks during the global coronavirus crisis.\n\nTheir daughter Tallulah posted a sweet photo of her sisters and her parents in matching pyjamas in April 2020.\n\nIn recent times, there have been similarly cute and friendly snaps of the very modern family.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Demi posted birthday tributes to Bruce, with updated photos of the pair hanging out together at home."
