And that is what it is. So my point is this. If you know someone that is looking after someone else, don’t ask what you can do, just do. This random act of kindness will honestly stay with me for a long time.\"\n\nRead on to learn more about Heming Willis.\n\nEmma Heming Willis was born in Malta\n\nAccording to Heming Willis' official website, she was born to a Guyanese mother and an English father in Malta.\n\nShe called the European island nation \"small but beautiful\" and said she stayed there until her parents divorced.\n\nUnder her mom's care, she said they moved to London first to be closer to her mom's side of the family before they settled down in Southern California, where she finished school.\n\n\"My mother has been the ultimate guide in my life — she is the rock that I cherish, respect and admire,\" Heming Willis said on the site.\n\nHeming Willis used to be a model\n\nIn the early '90s, Heming Willis started her modeling career when she won a London competition called “The British Elle Supermodel,\" per her website.\n\nFrom there, she started walking the runways for notable fashion houses, such as Chanel, Giorgio Armani, Valentino, Karl Lagerfeld and more.\n\nEventually, Heming Willis got into acting and in 2001, she made her acting debut with background roles in \"Perfume\" and \"Entourage,\" moving up to larger roles in movies like \"Perfect Stranger.\"\n\nHeming Willis met Willis at the gym in 2007, and were married 2 years later\n\nHeming Willis and Willis' love story started in 2007 when they met at their mutual trainer's gym, according to her website.\n\n“When we first met, I was surprised at how charming and how funny he was — and extremely handsome,” Heming Willis told People during a joint interview with Willis. “That was my first thought of you.”\n\n“I was already in love with her,” the \"Pulp Fiction\" star said.\n\nAfter making their red carpet appearance together at the premiere of Willis' 2008 film \"Flawless,\" the couple later got married in 2009 at their home in Turks and Caicos.\n\nHeming Willis has 2 kids with Willis\n\nIn 2012, the former model and Willis welcomed their first daughter, Mabel.
