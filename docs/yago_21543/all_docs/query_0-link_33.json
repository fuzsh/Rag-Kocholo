        "text": "RELATED: Getting Through Trauma, Addiction, & Divorce, Actress Demi Moore Says Friends Help the Healing The featured photo shows Moore and Willis in a living room setting looking into each other’s eyes with their arms interlocked, with Moore sitting on the edge of his chair, capturing a beautiful, intimate moment. The second slide shows Willis with his first grandchild Louetta, who turns 1 next week, and the third shot is a throwback of the Die Hard star with his three eldest daughters with Moore: Louetta’s mom Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30.\n\nRELATED: Bruce Willis’ Kids Have Nicknamed Him ‘Slay’ As They Help Their Dad During Progressive Dementia\n\nThey appear to be at a wedding, as the girls are all wearing matching satin pink and tulle dresses holding bouquets of flowers while huddled around their dad in his black suit.\n\nWillis remarried in 2009 and shares two younger daughters, Mabel, 12, and Evelyn, 9, with his wife Emma Heming Willis, 48, who is his primary caregiver and close with Moore.\n\nThe loving, blended family often posts photos celebrating milestones together, which consistently warms the hearts of their fans.\n\nCaregiving Isn’t Easy — Recognize That You May Need Help\n\nWhen a loved one is diagnosed with cancer or a rare disease like Bruce Willis, it can turn your world upside down. Your attention will suddenly turn from your job and family to caregiving. And no matter how much you plan for your new role, the enormity of it can take you by surprise.\n\nHow to Be a Better Caregiver for Your Loved One\n\n“Caregiving is a huge job. It’s going to impact your health and your physical well-being. It will impact your finances, your social life, your emotions, and your mental energy,” Amy Brown, nurse manager of Gynecologic/Oncology at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, previously shared with SurvivorNet.\n\nWith caregiving taking up a lot of your personal time away from work, school or other life duties, it’s important to realize that you may need help.\n\n“I learned this the hard way myself,” Brown said. “I have been the caregiver to my dad for 12 years. And I’m a nurse and I’m designed and equipped to handle that, and I tried to do it myself and failed miserably.”\n\nBrown stresses the importance of caring for yourself while you care for your loved one.\n\nSupport for Caregivers\n\n“Get sleep, eat well, exercise. Find something that brings you joy every day, whether it is going for a walk, praying, meditating, watching a movie, listening to an audio book, or getting together with friends.”\n\nThough caregiving can be a difficult and sometimes thankless job, it can be very rewarding as well.\n\n“Even though this is not what you signed up for, this is not how you planned your life, and this may be the biggest crisis of your life that you didn’t see coming, it has the potential to be incredibly meaningful,” Brown says.\n\nBruce Willis’ Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) Diagnosis\n\nApproximately one year after Bruce Willis announced in 2022 that he would be stepping away from acting due to an aphasia [which the NIH describes as “a disorder that results from damage to portions of the brain that are responsible for language diagnosis”], it was revealed the actor is suffering from a rare form of dementia.\n\nEarly last year, the dad-of-five’s wife opened up about his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis on Instagram, saying, “Our family wanted to start by expressing our deepest gratitude for the incredible outpouring of love, support and wonderful stories we have all received since sharing Bruce’s original diagnosis.”\n\n“In the spirit of that, we wanted to give you an update about our beloved husband, father and friend since we now have a deeper understanding of what he is experiencing.”\n\nRELATED: What Is Bruce Willis’ Rare Dementia Diagnosis And How Is His Family Coping?\n\nThe statement continued, “Since we announced Bruce’s diagnosis of aphasia in spring 2022, Bruce’s condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD).\n\n“Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.”\n\nLearning More About Frontotemporal Dementia\n\nFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the most common type of dementia for people under 60 years old.\n\nFTD is described by Johns Hopkins Medicine as “a group of disorders that occur when nerve cells in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain are lost” that caused the lobes to decrease in size.\n\nThe disease can alter changes in a person’s behavior, personality, language, and movement.\n\n“These disorders are among the most common dementias that strike at younger ages,” Johns Hopkins explains. “Symptoms typically start between the ages of 40 and 65, but FTD can strike young adults and those who are older. FTD affects men and women equally.”\n\nCommon Types of FTD:\n\nFrontal variant (affects behavior and personality)\n\nPrimary progressive aphasia (makes it difficult for a person to communicate and affects speech)\n\nSemantic dementia (affects the ability to use and understand language)\n\n“A less common form of FTD affects movement, causing symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease),” Johns Hopkins adds.\n\nThe cause of the disease remains unknown, however, specific subtypes of FTD have been linked to mutations on a few genes.\n\nSymptoms of FTD\n\nCommon symptoms of FTD, which start gradually and progress steadily or rapidly, are:\n\nBehavior and/or dramatic personality changes, such as swearing, stealing, increased interest in sex, or a deterioration in personal hygiene habits\n\nSocially inappropriate, impulsive, or repetitive behaviors\n\nImpaired judgment\n\nApathy\n\nLack of empathy\n\nDecreased self awareness\n\nLoss of interest in normal daily activities\n\nEmotional withdrawal from others\n\nLoss of energy and motivation\n\nInability to use or understand language; this may include difficulty naming objects, expressing words, or understanding the meanings of words\n\nHesitation when speaking\n\nLess frequent speech\n\nDistractibility\n\nTrouble planning and organizing\n\nFrequent mood changes\n\nAgitation\n\nIncreasing dependence\n\nSymptoms can vary depending on what part of the brain is affected.\n\n“Some people have physical symptoms, such as tremors, muscle spasms or weakness, rigidity, poor coordination and/or balance, or difficulty swallowing,” Johns Hopkins explains. “Psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, also may occur, although these are not as common as behavioral and language changes.”\n\nTreating FTD\n\n“Today, there is no cure for FTD, and no treatments available to slow or stop the progression of the disease,” the AFTD advises. “However, if you or a family member or loved one are affected, there are important steps that you can take to preserve and maximize quality of life. A growing number of interventions – not limited to medication – can help with managing FTD symptoms.”\n\nAnyone in need of guidance and resources can call AFTD’s HelpLine at 866-507-7222 or email [email protected].\n\nContributing by SurvivorNet staff."
