        "text": "Emma Heming Willis has a pointed message for all the parents out there.\n\nIn a new social media post showing how fast her two kids with husband Bruce Willis have grown up, the actress and model warned her fellow parents, \"Don't blink cause you just might miss it.\"\n\nHeming Willis, 46, shared a video montage via Instagram on Tuesday, July 30, showing three different clips of their daughtersâ€“Mabel, 12, and Evelyn, 10â€“walking side-by-side throughout various points in their lives.\n\nThe clip started with a video of the girls holding hands as they walked down the street together when they were much younger. It then skipped forward to a clip of them when they were a bit older before fast-forwarding to another current video of the two sisters.\n\n\"So grown up! ðŸ’•\" one fan commented on the post, while someone else said the warning is \"good for all parents\" to be reminded of.\n\nAnother user called the clip of the two girls \"so adorable\" while pointing out how much they look like their parents.\n\n\"One is mini you and the other one is Bruce,\" that fan wrote to Heming Willis, who has been married to the Die Hard actor since 2009.\n\nIn addition to his two youngest kids, Willis, 69, is also a dad to three older daughters he welcomed with ex-wife Demi Moore: Rumer, 35, Scout, 33, and Tallulah, 30.\n\nTheir blended family has been more unified than ever lately as Willis continues to deal with ongoing health issues. In 2022, his family announced that he was diagnosed with aphasia, which later progressed into a more severe diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia in 2023."
