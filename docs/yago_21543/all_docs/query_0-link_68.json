        "text": "\"Her heart aches as he struggles with this horrible disease,\" the source said of Moore, who tied the knot with the movie star in 1987 before the pair welcomed three daughters: Rumer, 35, Scout, 33, and Tallulah, 30.\n\n\"Demi made a promise to Bruce that she would look after Emma and Mabel and Evelyn, too,\" the insider explained in reference to the Die Hard actor's wife, Emma Heming Willis, 46, and their daughters, ages 12 and 10, respectively.\n\n\"Bruce's dementia is progressing,\" the insider sadly revealed, admitting The Sixth Sense actor \"has good days and bad.\"\n\n\"He has speech impairments and can‚Äôt speak much at all. These days, his family senses what he‚Äôs saying, what he needs by a look,\" the confidante detailed.\n\nDespite having \"full-time caretakers,\" Bruce is \"never left alone\" without \"at least one family member\" by his side.\n\nAs Bruce remains plagued by his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis, which his family confirmed in February 2023, the award-winning actor's precious brood has done their best to make small moments special.\n\nBack in March, Bruce's family came together to celebrate his 69th birthday ‚Äî a full two years after his initial aphasia diagnosis was revealed to the public.\n\n\"Just like you, we simply adore him,\" Emma expressed to fans via Instagram. \"What you might not know, but maybe you could imagine, that being wrapped in his arms is the safest place in this whole wide world.\"\n\nThe mom-of-two concluded: \"He‚Äôs a true gentle-man. With so much love to give and share. That‚Äôs what I get to see, his true core. I can tell you, it‚Äôs so pure and ever so good. Happy Birthday my love. You are the gift that keeps giving üíû.\"\n\nDemi also shared a kind message for her ex-husband, writing: \"Happy birthday, BW! We love you and are so grateful for you ‚ô•Ô∏è.\""
