        "text": "Bruce Willis' wife Emma Heming Willis has shared a series of sweet tributes to her husband as she reflects on their relationship amid Bruce's battle with dementia.\n\nIn one Instagram story, Emma shared a video of her Hollywood actor husband playing the harmonica alongside a friend playing guitar. In another she told fans she was \"Caught in the old photo and video vortex. Send help!\".\n\nShe continued sharing memories with her 941,000 Instagram followers as she paid tribute to her husband of 14 years. Another Instagram story showed Bruce being hugged by Emma with his daughter Scout hugging the couple too whilst holidaying in Budapest in 2012.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Bruce Willis' wife urges fans to 'make time for some fun' amid husband's dementia battle\n\nIn a follow up, doting dad Bruce carried one of his and Emma's daughters on his shoulder as she read a book. The final post saw a sweet picture of the couple with Emma kissing Bruce's cheek as she captioned the story: \"A cellular level kinda love\".\n\nEmma's latest social media posts come as she continues to dedicate her time caring for her husband Bruce as he struggles with his ongoing battle with dementia. The beloved Die Hard actor was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (better known as FTD) last spring. His health battle was first announced the year prior when his family revealed he was suffering from a language disorder called aphasia.\n\nHis wife Emma has been a steady rock for the actor throughout his heath battle, staying by his side every step of the way, while raising awareness to their fans. The couple share two kids together, welcoming Mabel in 2012 and Evelyn in 2014. Bruce also shares three older children with ex-wife Demi Moore including Rumer, Tallulah and Scout.\n\nLast month Emma expressed her unconditional love for the retired Hollywood star in a heartfelt birthday post. In the post celebrating the Unbreakable star's 69th birthday, she gushed over their romance describing Bruce's arms the \"safest place in this whole wide world \". She went on to add that he was a true \"gentleman\" and was the \"gift that keeps giving\" and still has so much love to share and give to the world.\n\nEarlier this year Bruce's friend and creator of Bruce's hit 1980s comedy series Moonlighting, Glen Gordon Caron, gave an insight into his visits to see the ailing actor. Talking to the New York Post he said: \"My sense is the first one to three minutes he knows who I am he's not totally verbal.\n\n\"He used to be a voracious reader - he didn't want anyone to know that - and he's not reading now, all those language skills are no longer available to him, and yet he's still Bruce. When you're with him you know that he's Bruce and you're grateful that he's there, but the joie de vivre is gone.\"\n\nGlen also it has been \"mind-blowing\" to see how much Bruce has changed adding that he \"loved life andâ€¦ just adored waking up every morning and trying to live life to its fullest.\""
