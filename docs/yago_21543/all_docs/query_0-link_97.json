        "text": "Emma Heming Willis has nothing but love for her husband Bruce Willis and his ex-wife of 11 years Demi Moore.\n\nThe ex-model doesnâ€™t seem to have a jealous bone in her body, as she took to social media yesterday and shared a throwback black and white photo of Bruce and Demi.\n\nCommenting on the picture, the 44-year-old said: â€˜Yeah. Me too. I liked them together as well.â€™\n\nThe Die Hard actorâ€™s devoted wife has been sharing lots of sentimental memories of late, after the 68-year-old filmstar was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in February.\n\nBruce and Emma share two children together; 11-year-old Mabel, and eight-year-old Evelyn, while he is also father to three older children of Demiâ€™s; Rumer, 34, Scout, 31, and Tallulah, 29.\n\nDemi and Bruce split in 1998, and Emma married the Pulp Fiction icon in 2009, but the former has stayed close to her ex-husband and his new family over the years.\n\nCharlieâ€™s Angelsâ€™ Demi even photographed Emma and Bruceâ€™s marriage vow renewal in 2019, as was revealed in some recently unveiled pictures of the occasion.\n\nRecently, the family celebrated Mabelâ€™s 11th birthday as Emma posted some sweet throwback pictures of Bruce with his beloved daughter over the years.\n\nShe captioned the montage with: â€˜Happy 11th Birthday Mabel Ray! Your energy is infectious. You can light a whole room with your smile and warmth. How you love and care for your family and friends is beautiful to witness. Keep shining my love and always remember to #liveitup ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•â€™.\n\nLast year, it was revealed that Bruce had been diagnosed with aphasia â€“ a degenerative condition that affects speech and communication.\n\nIn a shocking update in February, the family explained his condition had â€˜progressedâ€™ to frontotemporal dementia.\n\nIn a statement, they said: â€˜Since we announced Bruceâ€™s diagnosis of aphasia in spring 2022, Bruceâ€™s condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD).â€™\n\nâ€˜Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.â€™\n\nâ€˜FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone,â€™ it continued. â€˜Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead.\n\nâ€˜As Bruceâ€™s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.â€™\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf youâ€™ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page â€“ weâ€™d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Bruce Willisâ€™ wife Emma shares adorable throwbacks of Die Hard actor for daughter Mabelâ€™s birthday amid his dementia diagnosis"
