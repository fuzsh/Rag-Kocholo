        "text": "Bruce Willis' wife, Emma Heming Willis, is celebrating the Hollywood star's 69th birthday.\n\nEmma took to her social media page to share a heartfelt message for the actor, who has been diagnosed with aphasia and dementia.\n\nThe action movie star was also flooded with special messages from fans, many of whom also took the opportunity to speak about his health condition.\n\nBruce Willis' Wife Wishes Him A Happy Birthday As He Turns 69\n\nOn Tuesday, Emma Heming Willis shared a heartfelt post on social media to mark her husband, Bruce Willis' 69th birthday.\n\nThe short message was accompanied by an adorable photograph of the actor holding one of his daughters while wearing a hat.\n\nIn her post, Emma gushed about Bruce being a kind and sweet person while noting that he's a \"true gentleman\" with a lot of love to give.\n\nThe former model wrote, \"Just like you, we simply adore him. What you might not know, but maybe you could imagine, that being wrapped in his arms is the safest place in this whole wide world. He's a true gentleman.\"\n\nShe added, \"With so much love to give and share. That's what I get to see, his true core. I can tell you, it's so pure and ever so good. Happy birthday my love. You are the gift that keeps giving.\"\n\nBruce and Emma first met in 2007 and tied the knot after two years of dating in a ceremony held in Turks and Caicos. They share two daughters, Mabel Ray and Evelyn Penn Willis. Bruce also has three daughters from his previous marriage to actress Demi Moore: Rumer Glenn, Scout LaRue, and Tallulah Belle Willis.\n\nFans Wish Bruce Willis A Happy Birthday\n\nFans were moved by Emma's sweet tribute to Bruce as they flooded her comment section with kind words and birthday messages.\n\nOne person wrote, \"Happy birthday, Bruce; I really wish you with all my heart that your health improves or at least that it stabilizes; let's ask the universe or God to help you! That you can share give love through your whole family I want to believe that someone will hear us allowed the stars. Enjoy your day with your loved ones and you stay young and beautiful.\"\n\nAnother said, \"Happy Birthday Bruce! I know what you mean about seeing his true core. My Dad was diagnosed with FTD in 2021 and for all of the hardship, it really does show you who they are at their essence.\"\n\nA third fan noted, \"Happiest birthday Bruce! Love you. Hope your day is filled with love and happiness. Just like the song.\"\n\nEmma Heming Willis Slams Claims That Her Husband Has 'No More Joy'\n\nBruce's birthday celebration comes shortly after his wife, Emma, slammed false reports that the \"Die Hard\" actor no longer had joy in his life.\n\nRecent reports had speculated that the 68-year-old Hollywood stalwart has \"no more joy\" as he continues to struggle with dementia, but his wife laid those speculations to rest.\n\nHeming took to Instagram earlier this month to address the reports, noting that her husband still maintained \"love and connection,\" especially with his loved ones. She also campaigned for more awareness of the condition.\n\n\"The headline basically says there is no more joy in my husband - now, I can just tell you, that is far from the truth,\" Heming said in the clip. \"I need society and whoever's writing these stupid headlines to stop scaring people.\"\n\n\"Stop scaring people to think that once they get a diagnosis of some kind of neurocognitive disease that – 'That's it, it's over, let's pack it up, nothing else to see here, we're done' - no, it's the complete opposite of that,\" she continued.\n\nHeming said that while Bruce's condition has brought \"a lot of grief and sadness\" to her family, there is also love, connection, joy, and happiness.\n\n\"So stop with these stupid headlines. There's nothing to see here, okay?\" she added.\n\nThe Actor's Close Circle Are 'Extremely Anxious' About His Worsening Appetite\n\nA source told In Touch that the \"Pulp Fiction\" star's health status has significantly declined recently, alleging that his loved ones are seemingly preparing to say goodbye to the beloved actor.\n\n\"He doesn't express hunger much. According to family members, the challenge at home is making sure that he's getting enough to eat, that he's not skipping mealtime, and that his diet is filled with foods that have the chance to improve his health instead of subtracting from it,\" the source shared.\n\nThe insider went on to explain that the \"sad situation\" with Bruce and his family is one \"that should be familiar to anybody who is dealing with a close family member with dementia or Alzheimer's.\"\n\nBruce Willis' Daughter Tallulah Was Diagnosed With Autism\n\nIn closely related news, the actor's daughter, Tallulah, took to Instagram recently to open up about her health condition and its impact on her life. Tallulah revealed that she has been diagnosed with autism and went on to note how her life has \"changed\" since learning about it this summer.\n\nAs we previously reported, the 30-year-old actress shared a throwback video of herself and Bruce on the red carpet at the premiere of his 2004 film \"The Whole Ten Yards,\" which then 10-year-old Tallulah also starred in. She could be seen fiddling with his ears and repeatedly rubbing her hands over his bald head as Bruce held her up in his arms while he answered questions from journalists.\n\n\"Tell me [you're] autistic without telling me [you're] autistic,\" she wrote alongside the post.\n\nThe post prompted a fan to press her about her diagnosis, and she responded, saying, \"Actually, this is the first time I've ever publicly shared my diagnosis. Found out this summer, and it's changed my life.\""
