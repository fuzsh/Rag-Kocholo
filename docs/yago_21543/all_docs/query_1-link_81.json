        "text": "Bruce Willis and Demi Moore used to be the hottest couple in Hollywood. They were successful and had a beautiful family. Their relationship developed rapidly, and they welcomed 3 kids together.\n\nHowever, by 2000, they suddenly called it quits after being married for 13 years. Contrary to popular belief, not everything was so magical in their marriage.\n\nLove at first sight\n\nBack in 1987, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore ran into each other at a movie premiere, and before anyone knew it, they got hitched just a few months later. Demi recollects, “He said, ’I think we should get married.’ We’d been joking about it, but suddenly it didn’t seem like he was kidding.”\n\nAF Archive / Graham Whitby Boot / Mary Evans Picture Library / East News\n\nDemi wrote a revealing book about her life.\n\nIn her 2019 memoir, Inside Out, Demi Moore candidly shared her personal struggles, childhood, and relationships, including her marriage to Bruce Willis. She revealed some details about their love story, like how they started dating and got married.\n\nInvision/Invision/East News\n\nDemi and Bruce quickly became a family.\n\nMoore and Bruce were totally smitten with each other. They were both ready to start a family, so Demi got pregnant within just 4 months, on their wedding night. They have 3 lovely daughters — Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah. Shortly afterward, once the star lost the baby weight, she was ready to get back to work and pursue her career.\n\nGP/MPI/Capital Pictures/Capital Pictures/East News\n\nHe was a controlling husband.\n\nMoore was ready to return to the big screen, but Bruce had a different opinion. He wanted her to stay home and be a full-time mom, saying, “This is never going to work if you’re off shooting a film.” Despite his wishes, Moore landed several gigs and started working again. Demi says she was tormented — he was too “controlling” and she was “rebellious.”\n\nShe tried to make things right.\n\nBruce made it difficult for her, insisting that they couldn’t both work and be parents. Moore tried to make it work, taking her daughter to the set of We’re No Angels and constantly adjusting her schedule to accommodate her husband’s.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS/East News\n\nEventually, Bruce decided he didn’t want to be married anymore. He couldn’t handle the attention she was getting.\n\nShe suspected he wasn’t loyal to her.\n\nThe actress recollects, “He wanted family and grounding, but he also craved excitement and novelty. Basically, he wanted to do whatever he wanted. He was 36, throw in celebrity and money. You do the math.”\n\nAnd whatever he wanted also included hopping into bed with other ladies. At least that’s what Demi Moore suspected. She thought that Bruce Willis was cheating on her with January Jones.\n\nThey are divorced but remain friends.\n\nface to face/FaceToFace/REPORTER/East News\n\nThey had been spending a lot of time apart due to their jobs, which went against Willis’s rule of not working at the same time. Friends close to them revealed that the demands of work, coupled with extended periods of filming in different parts of the world, put a strain on their marriage.\n\nBruce says, “Our friendship continues. The institution has been set aside.”\n\nWe have some more interesting reads about this famous family.
