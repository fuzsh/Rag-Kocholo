        "text": "The couple are often seen together celebrating special occasions or spending time with their three daughters, Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 29.\n\nWillis and Moore both remarried following their split. Willis married Emma Heming and welcomed two daughters, Mabel Ray, now 11, and Evelyn Penn, 9, while Moore married Ashton Kutcher in 2005 before splitting in 2013.\n\nLast year the family revealed in a statement to the public that Willis had been diagnosed with FTD - frontotemporal dementia, after his aphasia diagnosis in 2022.\n\nThe diagnosis prompted the actor to retire from films, with his last movie being Paradise City filmed in 2021. The Los Angeles Times reported the actor had been exhibiting signs of decline in recent years.\n\nIn interviews with almost two dozen industry professionals, the news outlet reported they all “expressed concern about Willis’ wellbeing”.\n\nSince his diagnosis, Moore has given huge support to Willis and his family - even reportedly moving into his home to join his care team.\n\nIn March last year, Radar reported that Moore has been a “rock” for the family, with a source telling the outlet: “At first no one outside the family could understand what Demi was doing living with her ex and his new wife but now it makes sense.”\n\n“Demi has been a rock for the family and is determined to make sure every day Bruce has left on Earth will be filled with love.”\n\nIt comes after Moore appeared on Andy Cohen’s radio show, where she encouraged other families struggling with dementia to “let go”.\n\nWhen asked: “What message do you have for people out there who have family members who have dementia?”\n\nMoore said: “When you let go of who they’ve been or who you think they [should be], or who even you would like them to be, you can then really stay in the present.\n\n“Take in the joy … the love that is present and there for all that they are, not all that they’re not.”"
