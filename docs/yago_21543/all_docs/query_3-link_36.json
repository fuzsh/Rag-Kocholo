I'm sure many of us are in that situation! Thoughts?\n\nSecondly...isolating with your ex. Yes they've been apart for years and he's been happily remarried for a long time but I wondered how the average person would feel in this circumstance? Would you be bothered or not? I'm not in a situation where this could happen so have no real world view!"
