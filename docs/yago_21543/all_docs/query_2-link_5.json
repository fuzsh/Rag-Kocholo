        "text": "Bruce Willis and wife Emma Heming Willis are celebrating a milestone in their marriage amid his dementia diagnosis.\n\nThe couple celebrated 15 years of marriage on Thursday, with Heming, 45, sharing a photo of her husband on Instagram to mark the occasion.\n\n\"Today marks our 15th wedding anniversary! And today, I can make a choice. I can wallow in sorrow or I can celebrate it. I call this the 'remarkable reframe,'\" she wrote in the caption, under a sweet photo of Willis, 69, and Heming about to share a kiss, with Heming Willis looking at the camera and Willis looking away.\n\n\"What I know is there is so much to celebrate,\" she continued. \"Our union and connection is probably stronger than ever.\"\n\nTallulah Willis, Bruce Willis' daughter, shares she was diagnosed with autism last year\n\nThe \"Die Hard\" star retired from acting in 2022 after he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. In February 2023, his family said the condition had \"progressed\" and that he received a more specific diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia.\n\n\"We have two bright, fun and healthy daughters,\" she wrote. \"We have a family unit that is built on mutual respect and admiration. And simply, I just love and adore the man I married.\n\n\"I’m so proud of what we have and continue to create. So, happy crystal anniversary to us,\" she said, referring to the traditional 15th-anniversary gift.\n\nBruce Willis' daughter Tallulah Willis commented on the post: \"I love your love. And I’m so proud of you, you remarkable human being.\"\n\nTallulah Willis, Bruce Willis' daughter, shares she was diagnosed with autism last year\n\nWillis turned 69 on Tuesday, with his family sharing loving posts in his honor.\n\n\"He's a true gentle-man. With so much love to give and share. That’s what I get to see, his true core. I can tell you, it’s so pure and ever so good,\" Heming Willis wrote under a photo of Bruce Willis holding a child. \"Happy Birthday my love. You are the gift that keeps giving.\"\n\n\"I love you so much. I love him so much! Our Pisces king!\" Tallulah Willis commented on the post.\n\nHis daughter Rumer Willis shared a carousel of photos of the two with the caption: \"To be loved by you is such a gift. You are the funniest, most tender, charming, out of this world silly talented and magical papa. Thank you for your generosity, your silliness and heart. Lou loves you so big,\" she said of her own daughter and Bruce Willis' granddaughter, Louetta Isley.\n\n\"my dad is one of my best friends, perhaps now on a deeper level than ever honestly. I cherish his affection and the immense freedom with which he’s always loved us,\" Scout LaRue Willis wrote in her own set of photos with her father. \"Happy happy birthday to the GOAT.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Heming Willis slammed \"stupid\" headlines that \"there is no more joy\" in her husband.\n\nShe said \"there is grief and sadness\" amid her husband's dementia battle, but he has also started \"a new chapter\" that is filled with \"love\" and \"joy.\"\n\n\"So stop with these stupid headlines, these stupid clickbaity things that freak people out,\" she added.\n\nHeming Willis also recently announced she is writing a guide to caregiving, set to be released in 2025 through Maria Shriver's publishing imprint, The Open Field.\n\nContributing: Brendan Morrow"
