Demi Moore is reportedly living with her former husband Bruce Willis and his new wife, Emma Heming Willis, and the Heming-Willis two young children, 10-year-old Mabel Willis and eight-year-old Evelyn Willis, since the ‘Die Hard’ actor was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.

The “Ladies of Willis/Moore” made a joint statement to announce the February 2023 diagnosis, after Willis retired from his acting career in 2022 due to an aphasia diagnosis.

The new Willis living arrangements

Moore has moved in with Willis and his new family to help care for him as he copes with his declining health.

“Demi has moved in, and she is not leaving until the very end,” a source said. “At first no one outside the family could understand what Demi was doing living with her ex and his new wife, but now it makes sense.”

“Demi has been a rock for the family and is determined to make sure every day Bruce has left on earth will be filled with love,” the source continued.

Is this a permanent move?

While the source claimed that she was not “leaving until the very end”, Demi Moore’s team told Radar that the ‘Ghost’ actress does not plan to make a long-term commitment to living with Bruce and Emma Willis, but that she will stay as long as necessary.

Yet another source said that Demi Moore “never left” the pod established during the pandemic, and that “now Bruce will leave before she does.”
