        "text": "M. Night Shyamalan is a divisive filmmaker; depending on who you ask the director is either a brilliant visionary or a man whose films are too flimsy to hold together. What nobody can deny about Shyamalan is that the man really, really loves movies. In a 2023 interview, he discussed a variety of his greatest cinematic influences with obvious enthusiasm, claiming he has a Blu-Ray collection of over 800 titles, and on Twitter, he frequently shares with his fans his Criterion Collection choices and recommendations.\n\nRaised in the Philadelphia area by a Indian family, Shyamalan began his career with two small indie dramas before becoming one of the biggest breakout auteurs of his generation with “The Sixth Sense,” a cultural phenomenon that introduced the world to his earnest brand of horror and his signature love of plot twists. In the 21st century, Shyamalan has experienced highs and lows as a filmmaker, but he’s always brought his signature exacting style to each production. And in his recent run of low-budget thrillers, he’s found a grove that’s proven to mesh well with his strengths, putting out playful films like “Split” and “Knock at the Cabin” that are as fun as they are emotionally resonant.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\n'Deadpool & Wolverine' Grosses $97 Million and 'Longlegs' Will Outrun 'Furiosa'\n\nHow 'Trap' and 'A Man Escaped' Present Two Wildly Different Depictions of Perseverance in the Face of Adversity\n\n'Trap' Review: Josh Hartnett Is Norman Bates for the Eras Tour Age in M. Night Shyamalan's Silly Cat and Mouse\n\nIn terms of taste, Shyamalan is a fan of many of the highest canonical classics: he’s frequently called “The Godfather” the best film ever made. Unsurprisingly given his output over the years and favoring of the thriller genre, he’s also a massive Alfred Hitchcock fan, naming his films like “Rebecca” and “The Birds” as core influences. He’s also a horror fan whose favorites include “The Exorcist” and “Raw.” And of course, the man is partial to a great popcorn film, as evidenced by his love of Steven Spielberg classics like “Jaws” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”\n\nWith Shyamalan’s latest film “Trap” in theaters now, IndieWire is taking a look at the films that have influenced Shyamalan’s career. Compiled from interviews and comments made over the years, here are 10 of Shyamalan’s favorite films of all time.\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nThe 16 Best Thrillers Streaming on Netflix in August, from 'Fair Play' to 'Emily the Criminal'\n\nThe 30 Best True Crime Shows Streaming Now, from 'Under the Bridge' to 'The Vow'\n\nThe 92 Best Comedies of the 21st Century, from 'Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World' to 'Jackass Forever'"
