        "text": "Warner Bros‘ is pushing M. Night Shyamalan‘s latest genre movie, Trap, from Aug. 2 to Aug. 9.\n\nThe news comes ahead of Warner Bros. studio presentation tomorrow, Tuesday, at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nThe movie moves away from Sony’s family pic, Harold and the Purple Crayon, making it the only studio entry on Aug 2, to what is a very crowded frame on Aug. 9.\n\nAmong the wide releases already situated on Trap‘s new date is Amazon MGM’s The Fire Inside, Lionsgate’s videogame adaptation, Borderlands, NEON’s horror movie Cuckoo, and Roadside Attractions’ Jean Reno movie, My Penguin Friend.\n\nTrap stars Josh Hartnett. Pic’s blurb: A father and teen daughter attend a pop concert, where they realize they’re at the center of a dark and sinister event.\n\nTypically when there’s a pile-up like this, it means Warner Bros. is in the know that another film will move off of Aug. 9.\n\nShyamalan was releasing his movies at Universal before jumping ship for Warner Bros. He independently finances his movies, after which the studio picks them up. His daughter Ishana Night Shyamalan has her horror feature directorial debut hitting theaters on June 14 via New Line Cinema."
