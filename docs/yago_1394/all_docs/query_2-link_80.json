        "text": "You’ve probably watched it before, but if not, It’s a Wonderful Life is one of America’s best-loved Christmas movies, starring Jimmy Stewart as a small-town dreamer who comes close to being fatally crushed by his emotional and financial burdens, and the feeling that he’s a failure. A divine intervention by his guardian angel helps him to come back. Over the year, it’s appeal has only grown; perhaps the tinsel on this film will never lose its shimmer.\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Life is most often praised for showing how goodness is its own reward, and that a man is truly rich if he has friends. But I would argue that its loudest message is this:\n\nGod loves us and hears our prayers!\n\nIt was Director Frank Capra himself who insisted “My films must let every man, woman and child know that God loves them.” He chose to open his movie with the voices of George’s loved ones floating up to Heaven as they pray fervently for him. Almost the very instant these prayers reach the ear of God, help is dispatched! Prayer resurfaces often throughout the movie, and the very last words uttered by George are essentially a thankful high five to his guardian angel: “Attaboy, Clarence!”\n\nHere is a collection of personal thoughts and remembrances collected from the internet which illustrate how much Capra’s masterpiece from 75 years ago still resonate.\n\nA Changed Perspective\n\nMillions of people have been moved by the movie’s message that being good, and being grateful for good things, bring lasting happiness.\n\n“I’m a young fella, 16, and I greatly appreciate this movie. I haven’t always been happy in life but this movie made me want to ‘live again.’ I’m working to become a happier person and every time I think of this film, I shed a tear thinking of how important it is to cherish the happy and good parts of life. Also the movie made me realize, like George, that I do truly have a wonderful life and that I’ve touched so many other people’s lives.”\n\n“I think of my war buddy who had half his platoon wiped out on Christmas Eve in Vietnam. I think of Iraqi-Afghan vets facing their own dark nights, and I think about how Jimmy Stewart survived the war — and the homecoming. If you are in a dark place this holiday, be on the lookout for your own [angel] Clarence and let him in.”\n\n“I must say that this is definitely, the best Christmas movie ever made; such emotional films just are not made nowadays. This really made me think about my life choices, made me appreciate everything I have and made me think that it’s really up to myself what I want to do in life.”\n\nNo Man is an Island\n\nThe angel tells George “each man’s life touches so many others.” Translation: even the littlest things we do and say in life can matter tremendously – for good or for ill. We are social beings, created for community and called to love one another.\n\n“George truly has been given the greatest gift; a chance to see a world that has never been touched by him, to see how many lives he has saved and changed for the best and how when he was on the brink of taking his own life, everyone prayed, wept, searched, and tried to help him in any way they could.”\n\n“I remember when I was a kid, my father lost his business he worked so hard for. He was devastated. Our church went all out to help us. Soon people were dropping off food, money, stuff for the kids. Just the power of a local community pulling together. I think of that every time I see this ending.”\n\n“Seeing his community rally behind them. The community he’s served his entire life. It is my wish one day to feel as this man does. To have your life mean something, to know your presence made such an impact on so many dozens of lives.”\n\n“A movie line for all time! ‘No man is a failure that has friends.’ All the money and fame in this world are as fleeting and fragile as dust in the wind. Friendship and the support of others can steer any ship through the deepest waters.”\n\n“I watched this movie for the first time week or two ago. I have never broke down in tears like I did after watching this movie. We are all part of this world, we are all unique and we are all loved by someone. Life is really wonderful and you always have a choice.”\n\n“I watched this movie with my adopted mother when I was a kid and thought ‘why am I watching this it’s stupid?’ Then later I was incarcerated for 7 years, and in jail I watched this movie and when the ending came I bawled my eyes out crying…Clarence left me with the greatest quote ever said or written down “Remember no man is a failure in the eyes of his friends.” And at that point I realized I have everything I needed from a few friends that rode out every trial I had growing up!”\n\nIt Gets Better With Time\n\nFor many Americans, this film is an annual Christmas tradition, and that fact alone gives it a certain nostalgia. But a commonly repeated theme is that with each passing year, the lessons of It’s a Wonderful Life strike deeper and deeper into the heart. That’s the mark of a truly great movie!\n\n“As a 92 year old man… I thank God for the many times over the years I got to enjoy this film with my wife… we were married for 68 years…”\n\n“I went from completely disregarding this as a child, to being drawn to tears as an adult. Growing older makes you appreciate true happiness.”\n\n“It’s a tradition in my family to watch this movie every Christmas Eve. As I’ve gotten older, I understand the meaning even more. This year, the ending brought me to tears.”\n\n“I remember when I watched this together with my parents for the first time a few years ago and my dad was like ‘ugh do we have to watch this boring movie?’ By the end of it we were all crying so hard and my dad the hardest haha. I love this ending, touches me every time!”\n\n“I’m so glad my Grandmother watched this with me growing up. The true spirit of Christmas! No matter how many times I watch it I cry. I miss her more then words can describe.”\n\n“Wouldn’t have given this movie a chance when I was a kid. As a 35 year old, this is the one that hits deep every year and leaves me with watery eyes. Time is a funny thing.”\n\n“Amazing how its basic premise of redemption and good winning out over greed resonates in 21st century America. The older I get the more emotional this film makes me. It is simply that good.”\n\n“‘I can’t possibly see how this movie would ever grow old fashioned because there are always going to be people who feel like the main character… I really can’t think of too many movies that contain as much power as this one but that’s why new fans are gained with every passing year.”\n\n“Does it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it’s just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be.”\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Wife\n\nGeorge isn’t the only hero in this story; Mary is a constant force for good in his life even from their childhood years, when she whispers in his ear “George Bailey, I’ll love you till the day I die!” Her prayers, her vision, her faithfulness are wonderful to behold, and Mary is THE greatest blessing that George acknowledges with a full heart at the end of the film. She epitomizes the quiet steadfastness of the wife and mother, never seeking glory or recognition, giving her all for others, and gratefully embracing the quiet rewards of a life of service, even when those rewards are few and far between. I’ve always wondered if Capra (a Catholic) chose this name for George’s wife because she embodies some of the virtues of the Mother of God herself: purity, tenderness, humility and charity.\n\nMary’s crucial role has not been overlooked by fans of the film.\n\n“As a man, to have a wife like that is the greatest blessing you can have.”\n\n“I don’t care what anyone says, this movie still brings a tear to my eyes at 31. George helped all those people; family and friends and true friends will never see you suffer. I sure hope to find a wife like Mary one day. She really stood by her husband.”\n\n“[it’s] the story of someone becoming, kicking and screaming, against all intentions and desires, a big man. Mary sees the big man in George from the first, because she is a big woman.” (Clare Coffey)\n\n“I have known a ‘Mary’ in my life. She has supported me through thick and thin. My life would be a very empty place without her love. My community would also be less without her care. My children are a reflection of her beautiful heart. She is blessed. Thanks for loving me…you are a gift from God above.”\n\n“The one watching over George all those years was Mary. She was just as much a guardian angel to George as Clarence was.”\n\n“There are many such Marys in this world who quietly go about, offering their prayers, works, and sufferings; raising their children; praying for their husbands and making them 10x the men they would have been without them. I know. I’m married to one. Most of their deeds won’t be known this side of heaven. Until they’re known, we, the Georges of this world, offer to you Marys our profound thank you. And we promise to keep trying to lasso the moon for you. You deserve nothing less.” (Tim Clark)\n\nStewart’s Soul-Searching Performance\n\nIt’s not just the inspiring story line that packs a punch; this was truly one of Jimmy Stewart’s greatest performances. Calling it one of best roles he ever played (and his favorite film out of 80 made), Jimmy Stewart (a devout Christian) said he was talking to God for real during those pivotal scenes.\n\nIn his own words, he describes the tragic bar scene where George completely breaks down. “In agony I raise my eyes and, following the script, plead, ‘God… God…dear Father in heaven, I’m not a praying man, but if you’re up there and you can hear me, show me the way. I’m at the end of my rope. Show me the way, God…’ As I said those words, I felt the loneliness, the hopelessness of people who had nowhere to turn, and my eyes filled with tears. I broke down sobbing. This was not planned at all, but the power of that prayer, the realization that our Father in heaven is there to help the hopeless, had reduced me to tears.” Director Capra immediately realized what a gift this raw, unplanned performance was, and used a close up shot to capture every aspect of that poignant moment for his final cut.\n\n“What makes this movie work so beautifully is that the character Stewart plays is imperfect. He is a flawed human being just like anyone of us. To me, that is the reason why the ending is magical. Stewart helps us relate to George on so many levels.”\n\n“When Harry says:”To my big brother George, the richest man in town,” the expression that follows on Jimmy Stewart’ is one of the most honest, pure and amazing acting reactions I have ever seen. I cannot stop watching it over and over again. Thank you Jimmy, you were a wonderful actor.”\n\n“I recently saw the ending scene described as the most satisfying emotional payoff of any movie and I’d have to agree. Stewart nails it.”\n\n“In the course of the film, Stewart embodies love, joy, and sacrifice, but most significantly for his future direction as an actor, there is also despair, sorrow and anger…there’s also a dark undercurrent to George Bailey – one fully exploited later by Hitchcock and Manne.” (Graeme Ross)\n\n“His depiction of suicidal anguish is something we carry with us long after seeing this film.” (Mick LaSalle)\n\n“…only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawing at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim’s Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable.”\n\n“What I love most is that you could show this scene to anyone around the world with no context or subtitles and they’d understand what he’s going through, just by looking at his eyes. It’s a universal human feeling and Jimmy Stewart portrayed it painfully true.”\n\nLife is Worth Living\n\nGeorge attempts suicide in the film; darkness and fear overtake him as stares down into an icy river and decides to throw it all away. And this is when the angel shows up. The flirtation with death in It’s a Wonderful Life has really hit home for many, instilling a deeper appreciation for the gift of life, as fragile as it is.\n\n“I’m a Navy vet with PTSD. This movie literally saved my life.”\n\n“I’ve felt suicidal before but I know God has a plan…no matter how bad it is or how much it doesn’t make sense there will be a light at the end of the tunnel. We realize what we go through makes us who we are and one day it all makes sense why things happen because Someone is watching over us, writing our story. This movie had such a profound effect on me, I feel it changed my life. I revisit it occasionally to remember what it taught me.”\n\n“Everyone should watch this film, you learn such a valid lesson about how precious life really is and how important each and everyone of us is to each other…sometimes some of us go through life without realizing what an impact we could have or have to so many others, we under value ourselves which can make us end our lives tragically or do sinful things because we lose our identity and lose the sense of what is right or wrong.”\n\n“George Bailey is all of us, and his story is a reminder that we’re all important and, no matter how tough it gets, we need to keep going.”\n\nActor Jimmy Stewart knew personally about the “dark night of the soul” that can breed thoughts of despair. Having just returned from multiple treacherous missions over Nazi Germany, he remarked upon returning that “Fear is an insidious and deadly thing. It can warp judgement, freeze reflexes, breed mistakes. And worse, it’s contagious.” The prayerful desperation he portrays in the film is the real deal.\n\nAnd when he gleefully rejoices over his bloody lip, smiles as he passes his smashed up car, and moments later yells “I bet it’s a warrant for my arrest. Isn’t it wonderful? I’m going to jail!” George Bailey isn’t descending into Pollyanna platitudes – or madness. It’s just that he’s truly internalized that life is worth living, no matter what shape it takes. There can be calm in a raging storm, the calm that hope brings.\n\nHow much more important this message grows with each passing year, with both suicide and “assisted suicide” on the rise!\n\nAll of this talk about hope for a weary world, brings to mind a most beautiful passage from Lord of the Rings, after which I will exit stage left:\n\n“There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tower high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.” (J.R.R. Tolkien)\n\nWatch It’s a Wonderful Life with Amazon Prime\n\nMerry Christmas!"
