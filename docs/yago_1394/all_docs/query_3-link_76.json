        "text": "\"This whole concert is a trap. They're watching all the exits.\" Get ready for a whole new twist! Warner Bros has revealed an official trailer for the next new M. Night Shyamalan movie titled Trap, arriving in theaters in August at the end of the summer. This was teased at CinemaCon last week, and we finally all get a look at the trailer. Josh Hartnett stars as a father who takes his daughter to a pop star concert (inspired by Taylor Swift or Lady Gaga). However, while there they discover that the concert is all a setup to catch a serial killer. But who is the killer? This first big twist is revealed IN the trailer, so it's not really a spoiler. I also have a feeling Shyamalan has worked in a few other big twists that we don't know about yet. The cast also includes Ariel Donoghue, Saleka Shyamalan performing as Lady Raven, Hayley Mills, and Allison Pill. With cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom (of Call Me by Your Name) and a score by Herdĭs Stefănsdŏttir. Trap is a nice compliment to M. Night's daughter's first film The Watchers also out in theaters this summer.\n\nHere's the first official trailer for M. Night Shyamalan's film Trap, direct from WB's YouTube:\n\nThere's also might be a viral ARG - visit the official website for the pop star Lady Raven to follow."
