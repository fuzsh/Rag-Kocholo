        "text": "When M. Night Shyamalan was asked what the biggest plot twist in his own life was, he paused and thought carefully.\n\nThe answer, said Shyamalan, whose name has been synonymous with twists since his 1999 breakthrough, “The Sixth Sense,” was having come full circle: back to making films in his native Philadelphia, back to the kinds of thrillers that in 2002 led Newsweek to label him “the Next Spielberg.”\n\n“All I want to do is make thrillers,” Shyamalan, 48, said in a phone interview last week. After years spent making other kinds of films, he added, coming back to what he loved most had prompted a realization: “Wow, I had everything I wanted in the first place.”\n\nIt’s appropriate, then, that “Glass,” which debuts this weekend, completes another kind of circle. Riding high on the success of its predecessor, “Split” (2017), the film concludes an original superhero trilogy that began in 2000 with “Unbreakable” — a grim and deliberate origin story that arrived, perhaps, just a little too soon.\n\nConventional wisdom then held that an original superhero story wouldn’t sell, and Shyamalan has said that Disney, which produced “Unbreakable,” encouraged him not to market it as a comic-book movie — an unthinkable strategy today. (A harbinger of the culture to come, “X-Men,” released that same year, grossed nearly 300 million.) “Unbreakable” made money, but it fell way short of “The Sixth Sense” and failed to resonate the way Shyamalan had hoped.\n\nStill, his instincts were ultimately validated: Spandex went mainstream, and “Unbreakable,” always a critics’ favorite, amassed a loyal fan base over the years, not least with the Comic Con set. Then Shyamalan surprised fans with “Split”: a horror-thriller sequel starring James McAvoy that took in over $278 million on a $9 million budget. After a string of critical failures including “The Last Airbender,” “The Happening” and “After Earth,” there was talk of a comeback.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
