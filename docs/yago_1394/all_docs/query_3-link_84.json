        "text": "From producer M. Night Shyamalan and director Ishana Night Shyamalan comes The Watchers, and tickets for the horror movie from New Line Cinema are now up for grabs.\n\nThe Watchers is playing only in theaters June 7, 2024. Get your tickets now!\n\nYou can also watch the previously released official trailer below.\n\nThe film follows Mina, a 28-year-old artist, who gets stranded in an expansive, untouched forest in western Ireland. When Mina finds shelter, she unknowingly becomes trapped alongside three strangers who are watched and stalked by mysterious creatures each night.\n\nThe Watchers stars Dakota Fanning (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Georgina Campbell (Barbarian), Oliver Finnegan (“Creeped Out”) and Olwen Fouere (The Northman).\n\nThe upcoming mystery-horror film is produced by M. Night Shyamalan, Ashwin Rajan and Nimitt Mankad. The executive producers are Jo Homewood and Stephen Dembitzer.\n\nJoining writer/director Shyamalan behind-the-camera are director of photography Eli Arenson (“Lamb,” “Hospitality”), production designer Ferdia Murphy (“Lola,” “Finding You”), editor Job ter Burg (“Benedetta,” “Elle”) and costume design by Frank Gallacher (“Sebastian,” “Aftersun”). The music is by Abel Korzeniowski (“Till,” “The Nun”).\n\nThe Watchers is based on the novel by A.M. Shine.\n\nThe M3GAN Universe will also be expanding next year with a spinoff horror movie titled SOULM8TE, starring Lily Sullivan (Evil Dead Rise, Monolith). After popping heads as Victoria Neuman on Prime Video’s “The Boys,” Deadline reports that actor Claudia Doumit has joined the cast of the horror spinoff.\n\nThe spinoff is being billed as a ’90s-style erotic thriller with a “new technological twist,” and it’s coming to theaters on January 2, 2026.\n\nDoumit will star opposite previously announced leads Sullivan and David Rysdahl, but character details are currently under wraps.\n\nSOULM8TE follows along as “a man (Rysdahl) acquires an Artificially Intelligent android (Sullivan) to help him cope with the recent loss of his deceased wife. In an attempt to create a truly sentient partner, the man inadvertently turns a harmless lovebot into a deadly soulmate.”\n\nKate Dolan (You Are Not My Mother) will direct. The filmmaker rewrote an original draft from Rafael Jordan (Salvage Marines), which was based on a story by James Wan, Ingrid Bisu and Jordan. It’s said to be far more risqué than its parent film.\n\n“Fundamentally, I view this film as an exploration of relationships and loneliness,” Dolan said in a recent statement. “Despite technological advances, there are enduring human truths we cannot escape, and I am looking forward to delving into those depths.”\n\n“SOULM8TE is a thrilling and seductive addition to the M3GAN universe. We’re excited to partner with Kate to bring this story to life with her unique cinematic vision and point of view,” said James Wan, who produces through his company Atomic Monster.\n\nM3GAN was a massive viral hit for Blumhouse back in 2022, the film scaring up $180 million at the worldwide box office. It’s no secret why Blumhouse is all-in on all things M3GAN.\n\nWan and Jason Blum will produce, with Michael Clear and Judson Scott of Wan’s Atomic Monster exec producing alongside Ingrid Bisu. Alayna Glasthal is the executive overseeing the project for Atomic Monster."
