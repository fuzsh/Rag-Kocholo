        "text": "Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan (Tamil: மனோஜ் நெல்லியட்டு சியாமளன்), known professionally as M. Night Shyamalan, is an Academy Award-nominated American filmmaker and script writer of major studio films, known for making movies with contemporary supernatural plots that usually climax with a twist ending. He was chosen to direct the film adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender, which was released as The Last Airbender, and also cameoed in the film as a Fire Nation soldier at the earthbending prison camp.\n\nSelected other credits[]\n\nTelevision work[]\n\nWayward Pines (director and producer)\n\nFilmography[]\n\nGlass (2019 - director, producer, and writer)\n\nSplit (2017 - director, producer, and writer)\n\nThe Visit (2015 - director, producer, and writer)\n\nAfter Earth (2013 - director, executive producer, and writer)\n\nDevil (2010 - producer and writer)\n\nThe Happening (2008 - actor, director, producer, and writer)\n\nLady in the Water (2006 - actor and director)\n\nThe Village (2004 - actor, director, and producer)\n\nSigns (2002 - actor and director)\n\nUnbreakable (2000 - actor, director, and writer)\n\nThe Sixth Sense (1999 - director)\n\nPraying with Anger (1992 - actor, director, producer, and writer)\n\nBiographical information[]\n\nThough full American citizens, his parents traveled to India for his birth, giving him Indian citizenship before American. He began making home films at a young age, and clips from several of these films are included on DVD releases of his feature films, typically with an introduction where he decries the poor skill he had at the time. Though he began making films professionally in 1992, it was not until the release of The Sixth Sense in 1999 that he found mainstream success.\n\nShyamalan was introduced to Avatar by his children, when his daughter wanted to dress up as Katara for Halloween. His children convinced him to watch the show in late season two. He was immediately intrigued and bought the DVDs of season one, which quickly made the whole family fans of the show. His favorite character is Zuko due to the morally gray complexities of his personality.\n\nIn recent years, many critics have accused him of declining quality, with The Last Airbender having a 6% \"rotten\" rating on \"Rotten Tomatoes\".\n\nShyamalan wrote and prepared a script for The Last Airbender 2, despite negative criticism of the first film. A third movie was also planned.\n\nAwards[]"
