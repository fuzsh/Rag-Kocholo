        "text": "The superb creative Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan, who is recognised the world over as M. Night Shyamalan, is an award-winning filmmaker, and actor. He is best known for his spooky movies The Sixth Sense, Signs, Lady in the Water, and Glass, and for the Apple TV series Servant. His forthcoming movie, Knock at the Cabin, is due for release in 2023.\n\nBorn in India, and then raised in the United States, Shyamalan fell in love with filmmaking at a young age after he was given a Super 8 camera. He went on to study at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University and there adopted the name “M. Night”. While at NYU he made his first movie, Praying with Anger. He then wrote and directed Wide Awake in 1999, and the same year co-wrote Stuart Little, and ghostwrote She’s All That. He then gained international recognition with the release of his chilling The Sixth Sense, which became the second-highest grossing horror movie of all time, and earned him six Oscar-nominations. He went on to make a number of box-office hits, including The Village, The Happening, The Last Airbender, The Visit, and Split.\n\nShyamalan regularly connects with his hundreds of thousands of followers and fans through Twitter, and Instagram, posting pictures and comments about his life in and around the film industry."
