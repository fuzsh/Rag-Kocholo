        "text": "M. Night Shyamalan is the rare breed of filmmaker where everyone has a strong opinion about his work. Whether you love or hate them, people think about and engage with his films. Shyamalan has notably had career highs and lows, with movies contending for awards, as well as works that elicited ridicule. With Trap now in theaters, it seemed like a perfect time to look at the auteur’s resume and stack up his flicks.\n\nBelow, you can see my ranking of Shyamalan’s work. Note, this is published sans Trap, as Warner Bros. opted not to screen the movie for critics. Myles has seen the film and reviewed it here, but if/when I get to it, I’ll either update this list or include it in a follow-up piece. As for what’s on my list, it’s no secret that The Sixth Sense is his best work. From there, it’s really a different ranking for everyone. He’s proven divisive, yet there’s always an interest in what he’s got up his sleeve next. Take a look.\n\nHere now is how I would rank (almost all of) the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Behold:\n\n14. The Happening\n\n13. After Earth\n\n12. The Last Airbender\n\n11. Glass\n\n10. Lady in the Water\n\n9. Split\n\n8. Old\n\n7. Wide Awake\n\n6. The Village\n\n5. The Visit\n\n4. Knock at the Cabin\n\n3. Unbreakable\n\n2. Signs\n\n1. The Sixth Sense\n\nWhat are your M. Night Shyamalan rankings? Let us know!"
