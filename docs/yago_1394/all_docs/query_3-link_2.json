        "text": "Indian-American filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan began his career in 1992 with the student film Praying with Anger, which he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in. He then wrote the screenplays for the comedy movies Wide Awake (1998; also directed) and Stuart Little (1999). In 1999, he rose to prominence for writing and directing the supernatural movie The Sixth Sense, for which he received Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.[1] He then wrote, directed, and produced the superhero movie Unbreakable, the first entry in the Eastrail 177 Trilogy followed by Split in 2016 and Glass in 2019.[2]\n\nAfter Unbreakable, Shyamalan made Signs (2002) and The Village (2004), which increased his popularity with moviegoers and further established him as a filmmaker known for his twist endings.[3][4] The next decade, however, saw a series of critical misfires with Lady in the Water (2006), The Happening (2008), The Last Airbender (2010), and After Earth (2013).[5] In 2015, he partnered with Universal Pictures for The Visit, a commercial success that made $98.5 million on a $5 million budget.[6] Universal then released his films Split, Glass, Old (2021), and Knock at the Cabin (2023).[7] Shyamalan worked with Warner Bros. Pictures for his latest film, Trap (2024).[8][9]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nM.
