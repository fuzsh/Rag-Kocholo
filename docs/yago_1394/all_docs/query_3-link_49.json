        "text": "The movie \"Trap\" by director M. Night Shyamalan was inspired by a couple of unexpected sources that become evident when watching its newest trailer.\n\nSpeaking to Empire, Shyamalan said his pitch for the film was simple and succinct: \"What if 'The Silence Of The Lambs' happened at a Taylor Swift concert?\"\n\nMORE: Colman Domingo addresses criticisms about upcoming Michael Jackson movie\n\nThe image of a cannibalistic psychiatrist at an \"Eras Tour\" concert might prompt a giggle, but the newest trailer for \"Trap\" is not far from that scenario.\n\nJosh Harnett portrays a father accompanying her daughter to a concert for a fictional pop star named Lady Raven, played by Shyamalan's daughter Saleka. But the venue is surrounded by police, and Harnett's character learns the concert is a sting operation to capture a serial killer named \"The Butcher.\"\n\nThe trailer heavily implies that Harnett plays this killer. It shows him setting up several traps to sow chaos and escape the authorities.\n\nShyamalan called the movie a \"very scary and Hitchcockian\" ride. He said it partially was inspired by Operation Flagship, a 1985 sting in which U.S. Marshals lured fugitives into a convention center by promising NFL tickets.\n\nThe filmmaker also detailed the fictional Lady Raven concert directed for the film. \"And (the concert) wasn't just a thing in the background. It's equally important,\" Shyamalan told Empire. \"There is no pretend concert going on. I love the idea of cinema as windows within windows. One of the reasons to come see the movie at the movie theatre is because there’s literally a real concert that you can see nowhere except in that movie.\"\n\nPromotion for the film heavily touts Saleka Shyamalan's role as Lady Raven — maybe in hopes that Saleka's music will be the next big export from the Philadelphia area.\n\n\"Trap\" premieres in theaters on Aug. 2.
