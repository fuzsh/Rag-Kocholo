        "text": "M. Night Shyamalan's body of work is a bit like one of his films. There are plot twists, disasters, and moments of hope, and you never know what you'll get when you press play. Maybe you get a masterpiece? Or maybe you get a misfire? Maybe you get a movie that chills you to your bone? Or you could get a movie that irks you to your core. There has never been another director quite like him. Below, we've ranked his films.\n\n4 of 14\n\n11. 'Lady in the Water' (2006)\n\nLegendary Pictures\n\nLady in the Water is what happens when someone drops acid and then watches The Little Mermaid, and then decides to make their own Little Mermaid but with werewolves and bears. It's hard to tell what Shyamalan was going for here. He's got all the elements of a great underwater fantasy (including Bryce Dallas Howard as a mermaid), just without the elements that matter. You know, elements like water and fish.\n\n7 of 14\n\n8. 'The Happening' (2008)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nThe plants are trying to kill us! That was the main takeaway of this disaster flick, in which Mark Wahlberg plays a scientist who talks to a literal plant. The premise is right up there with Sharknado. The actors aren't sure whether they are supposed to act natural or confused, and the dialogue sounds like it was written by a crackpot. And yet...The Happening remains one of my favorite Shyamalan flicks because it mixes trash and art, a killer plant with a chilling score that could have been lifted from Bach.\n\n9 of 14\n\n6. 'The Village' (2004)\n\nTouchstone Pictures\n\nEveryone has one Shyamalan movie they think is underrated. For me, that movie is The Village, a slice of horror that pays more attention to atmosphere than it does to scares. The Village is set in a 19th-century encampment where monsters lurk outside, though some villagers aren't sure they are actual monsters. The movie builds to a twist that made me literally gasp — a shoutout to Stephen King's The Mist — and paved the way for dozens of films like it.\n\n10 of 14\n\n5. 'Knock at the Cabin' (2023)\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nA cabin in the woods sounds a little cliche, right? But a cabin in the woods where the apocalypse is happening, and the guests have to kill one of their own? Now I have your attention. Knock at the Cabin is not your average slasher, and the differences make it one of the genre's best. The tone is much darker than usual, which allows Shyamalan to hide his twists in plain sight.\n\n12 of 14\n\n3. 'The Sixth Sense' (1999)\n\nWalt Disney Pictures\n\nPlot twist! The director has made better movies than The Sixth Sense. Most people would assume this is his best work — it's certainly his most famous — but the story of a kid who sees dead people has a few skeletons in the closet. Mainly, the pace that never gets moving faster than a Frankenstein lurch. Still, the story is always engaging, and the mix of human drama and horror is hard to beat."
