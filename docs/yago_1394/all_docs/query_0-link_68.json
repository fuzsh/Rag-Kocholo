        "text": "Night Shyamalan, known for his infamously thrilling, psychological films released his newest film ‘Knock at the Cabin’ on Friday, February 3rd. The film centers around a family with a young daughter, away on a quiet vacation to a cabin and its surrounding woods. During their stay, they are approached by a group of four strangers to take them into captivity, forcing them to choose between saving the world or saving each other. Although M. Night Shyamalan has had his experience with dark and mystifying films, this may be his most terrifying film yet. It strikes close to home on the theme of family, as well as the looming danger of an apocalypse. Let’s take a look at who M. Night Shyamalan is, what he’s known for, and the cast chosen to represent the crucial roles in this n\n\nNight Shyamalan was born in August 1970, in India. He was raised in Penn Valley, Pennsylvania by his father and mother, who were both doctors. Although his parents wanted him to follow in their footsteps and pursue a medical profession, Shyamalan always wanted to be a filmmaker ever since he was given his first camera. Shyamalan wrote, produced, and directed his first film, ‘Praying with Anger’ in 1992, the beginning of his successful filmmaking career. Shyamalan attended NYU Tisch School of the Arts, in Manhattan, New York, graduating the same year his first film was released. Six years later, Shyamalan wrote and directed his second movie, ‘Wide Awake’, with his parents as the associate producers. Shyamalan married Bhavna Vaswani, a fellow student, and graduate of NYU; They were married the same year Shyamalan graduated from the university. Together they have three daughters, one is a notable musician, and the other is a film director. Shyamalan now lives with his family near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at Ravenwood, a 125-acre estate.\n\nRelated article: The Hollywood Insider’s CEO Pritan Ambroase: “The Importance of Venice Film Festival as the Protector of Cinema”\n\nRelated article: The Masters of Cinema Archives: The Hollywood Insider Pays Tribute to ‘La Vie En Rose’, Exclusive Interview with Director Olivier Dahan\n\nRelated article: – Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?

Often, Shyamalan will appear as a side character in the films he produces, similar to the popular cameos of Stan Lee in Marvel films. In 1999, Shyamalan released his film ‘Sixth Sense’, as well as co-wrote the screenplay for the classic family movie, ‘Stuart Little’. Shyamalan’s movie ‘Unbreakable’ was released in 2000, and two years later one of his most popular films, ‘Signs’ was released, featuring a cast including Mel Gibson, Joaquin Pheonix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin. Next was his film ‘The Village’, followed shortly by ‘Lady in the Water’. In the next four years, Shyamalan produced ‘The Happening’ and ‘The Last Airbender’, although neither movie was an immense hit as his other films proved to be. In 2013, he directed ‘After Earth’, starring Will Smith and Jaden Smith. In 2015 he then wrote and directed ‘The Visit’ and in 2016 he produced ‘Split’. Most recently, in 2019 Shyamalan’s film ‘Glass’ was released, followed by ‘Old’, released in 2021.

An excerpt from the love letter: The Hollywood Insider’s CEO/editor-in-chief Pritan Ambroase affirms, “We have the space and time for all your stories, no matter who/what/where you are. Media/Cinema/TV have a responsibility to better the world and The Hollywood Insider will continue to do so. Talent, diversity and authenticity matter in Cinema/TV, media and storytelling. In fact, I reckon that we should announce “talent-diversity-authenticity-storytelling-Cinema-Oscars-Academy-Awards” as synonyms of each other. We show respect to talent and stories regardless of their skin color, race, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, etc., thus allowing authenticity into this system just by something as simple as accepting and showing respect to the human species’ factual diversity. We become greater just by respecting and appreciating talent in all its shapes, sizes, and forms. Award winners, which includes nominees, must be chosen on the greatness of their talent ALONE.\n\nI am sure I am speaking for a multitude of Cinema lovers all over the world when I speak of the following sentiments that this medium of art has blessed me with. Cinema taught me about our world, at times in English and at times through the beautiful one-inch bar of subtitles. I learned from the stories in the global movies that we are all alike across all borders. Remember that one of the best symbols of many great civilizations and their prosperity has been the art they have left behind. This art can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, architecture, writings, inventions, etc. For our modern society, Cinema happens to be one of them. Cinema is more than just a form of entertainment, it is an integral part of society. I love the world uniting, be it for Cinema, TV, media, art, fashion, sport, etc. Please keep this going full speed.”\n\nMore Interesting Stories From The Hollywood Insider\n\n– Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?
