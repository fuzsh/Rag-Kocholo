        "text": "Director M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most original and visionary filmmakers of his generation.\n\nOften compared to the great Steven Spielberg himself, Shyamalan burst on to the scene in the late 1990s with his Academy Award nominated blockbuster, 'The Sixth Sense.' Perfecting his signature \"twist endings,\" Shyamalan has delighted fans with surprising films like 'Unbreakable,' it's sequels 'Split' and 'Glass,' 'Signs,' The Village,' 'Old' and most recently 'Knock at the Cabin.'\n\nAfter four seasons of serving as director and showrunner on the Apple TV+ series 'Servant,' Shyamalan returns to the big screen with his latest thriller 'Trap,' which stars Josh Hartnett and opens in theaters on August 2nd.\n\nIn honor of its release, Moviefone has ranked every movie filmmaker M.

As his father lies dying in the cockpit, Kitai must trek across the hostile terrain to recover their rescue beacon. His whole life, Kitai has wanted nothing more than to be a soldier like his father. Today, he gets his chance.\n\n15.

'The Happening' (2008)\n\nWhen a deadly airborne virus threatens to wipe out the northeastern United States, teacher Elliott Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) flee from contaminated cities into the countryside in a fight to discover the truth. Is it terrorism, the accidental release of some toxic military bio weapon -- or something even more sinister?\n\n13. 'Praying with Anger' (1992)\n\nAn alienated, Americanized teenager (Shyamalan) of East Indian heritage is sent back to India where he discovers not only his roots but a lot about himself.\n\n12.

When he discovers that she is actually a character from a bedtime story who is trying to make the journey back to her home, he works with his tenants to protect his new friend from the creatures that are determined to keep her in our world.\n\n10. 'Wide Awake' (1998)\n\nThe tale of a ten-year-old boy (Joseph Cross) in a Catholic school who, following the death of his beloved grandfather (Robert Loggia), embarks on a quest to discover the meaning of life.\n\n9. 'Old' (2021)\n\nA group of families on a tropical holiday discover that the secluded beach where they are staying is somehow causing them to age rapidly – reducing their entire lives into a single day.\n\n8. 'Split' (2017)\n\nThough Kevin (James McAvoy) has evidenced 23 personalities to his trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), there remains one still submerged who is set to materialize and dominate all the others. Compelled to abduct three teenage girls led by the willful, observant Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Kevin reaches a war for survival among all of those contained within him — as well as everyone around him — as the walls between his compartments shatter apart.\n\n7. 'The Village' (2004)\n\nWhen a willful young man (Joaquin Phoenix) tries to venture beyond his sequestered Pennsylvania hamlet, his actions set off a chain of chilling incidents that will alter the community forever.\n\n6. 'Glass' (2019)\n\nIn a series of escalating encounters, former security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) uses his supernatural abilities to track Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), a disturbed man who has twenty-four personalities. Meanwhile, the shadowy presence of Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) emerges as an orchestrator who holds secrets critical to both men.\n\n5.

With limited access to the outside world, the family must decide what they believe before all is lost.\n\n3.
