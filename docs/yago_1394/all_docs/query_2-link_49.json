        "text": "Based on the beloved “Avatar: The Last Airbender'' series, “The Last Airbender” is Shyamalan's weakest and worst effort, as fans of “Avatar” hated it and non-fans of “Avatar” didn't care to watch it. This was supposed to be the first of a trilogy, but it flopped so hard that those plans were nixed.\n\n“After Earth,” a sci-fi film starring Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith, came at a low point in Shyamalan's career, and the majority of the marketing for “After Earth” omitted his name entirely. Shyamalan likely had to concede control of the film to star Will Smith, who may have been trying to launch Jaden into movie stardom.\n\n“Glass,” a long-awaited sequel to “Unbreakable” that is also a sequel to “Split,” fails miserably. Shyamalan's attempt to keep the scale small by having the majority of the movie set in one location doesn't work, and a series of twists and turns flipping everything upside down doesn't help either.\n\n“Praying With Anger” is a film about an Indian American going back to India and experiencing a culture clash. Shyamalan is actually the star, writer, director, and producer of the film, and while “Praying With Anger” is an admirable launch to Shyamalan's career, it’s a very forgettable film."
