        "text": "Topline\n\nWarner Bros. released the trailer Tuesday for its upcoming film \"The Watchers,\" directed by Ishana Shyamalan, who is following in her father’s footsteps with her horror movie debut and joining several other children of Hollywood creators who’ve found directorial success in the shadow of their famous parents.\n\nKey Facts\n\nHollywood Directors With Famous Parents\n\nSofia Coppola — A three-time Academy Award nominee and one-time winner, Coppola is the director behind \"The Virgin Suicides,\" \"Lost in Translation,\" and last year’s Elvis biopic \"Priscilla,\" among others, but she’s perhaps best known as the daughter of iconic filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, whose credits include \"The Godfather,\" \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\"\n\nRob Reiner — He rose to fame as a star of 1970s sitcom “All In The Family” and the director of now cult-classic films \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" \"Stand by Me,\" \"The Princess Bride\" and \"When Harry Met Sally...\" in the 1980s, but Rob Reiner isn’t the first famous director in his family; his father, Carl Reiner, directed “The Jerk,” \"The Man with Two Brains” and \"Fatal Instinct.”\n\nJonás Cuarón—His directing credits include the upcoming \"El Muerto\" Spider-Man film and the \"Zorro\" reboot \"Z,\" but Jonás Cuarón is better known for co-writing the Academy Award-winning film \"Gravity\" with his father Alfonso Cuarón, who also directed \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\"\n\nJason Reitman — The four-time Academy Award nominee (twice for best directing) is behind beloved movies like \"Thank You for Smoking,\" \"Juno,\" \"Jennifer's Body\" and \"Up in the Air,\" but his father Ivan Reitman came before him with titles including \"Meatballs,\" \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Stripes.\"\n\nNick Cassavetes — John Cassavetes starred in \"Rosemary's Baby\" and went on to direct films like \"Columbo\" and \"A Woman Under the Influence\" in the 1970s before his son, Nick Cassavetes, shot to fame in his own right by directing \"The Notebook,\" \"Alpha Dog\" and \"My Sister's Keeper.”\n\nJake Kasdan—The man behind films like the 2017 \"Jumanji\" reboot, \"Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story\" and \"Bad Teacher\" is the son of Lawrence Kasdan, whose credits include \"The Big Chill,\" \"Silverado\" and Disney's \"Light & Magic” docuseries.\n\nLuke Scott—The son of famous director Ridley Scott (\"The Martian,\" \"American Gangster,\" \"Black Hawk Down,\" \"Gladiator\") has tried his own hand at the job as the second unit director for \"The Martian\" and the 2018 film \"Morgan.\"\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nJason Reitman has followed not just in his father’s directorial footsteps, but in his franchises. Ivan Reitman directed the original \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Ghostbusters II\" movies in the 1980s. His son, Jason Reitman, directed \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" in 2021 and teamed up with his father to write \"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,\" slated for release in March.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\n\"The Watchers\" will hit theaters on June 7.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nVarietyM.
