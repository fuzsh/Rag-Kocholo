        "text": "Ishana Night Shyamalan was 10. The film was “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” and it was her turn to deliver The Speech. When your dad is M. Night Shyamalan, the raconteur director of “The Sixth Sense,” “Glass,” and the forthcoming “Old,” family movie night has rules.\n\n“I had to get up in front of everyone and say, ‘We don’t talk during a movie and you can’t be on your phone,’” she said recently in a group video call, her father grinning from a separate window. “In our household, movies are sacred.”\n\nIshana — the middle child of three, all daughters — said it wasn’t just kids’ stuff.\n\n“We watched a lot of horror movies,” she said. “I think that’s why I have a tough skin.”\n\nNow 21 with an affection for the macabre — and with help from a father who knows a thing or two about directing fearsome psychodramas — Ishana is entering the big leagues. On Friday, she made her debut as a professional director with an episode of the new season of “Servant,” the creepy slow-burn horror series on Apple TV+. (The executive producers include her father — also a director of the series — and the show’s creator, Tony Basgallop.)\n\nA senior at her father’s alma mater, N.Y.U., Ishana took a semester’s leave of absence to direct Friday’s episode and the finale, one of two episodes she wrote this season in addition to co-writing another. She also traveled to the Dominican Republic last year to work as a second-unit director on “Old.”\n\n“A classic immigrant Indian year,” as her father, 50, put it.\n\nSet in Philadelphia, near where M. Night was raised and Ishana was born, “Servant” centers on Dorothy and Sean (Lauren Ambrose and Toby Kebbell), career-driven parents who hire a live-in nanny for their infant son. Their pick is Leanne (Nell Tiger Free), a demure young woman whose résumé masks mysterious intentions. The biggest spoiler happens in the jolting first episode, when it is revealed that the couple’s bundle of joy is actually a lifelike doll, known as a reborn, which Sean and Dorothy’s brother, Julian (Rupert Grint), encourage her to use as a way to cope with the death of her flesh-and-blood baby.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
