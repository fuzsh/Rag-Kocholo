        "text": "What Is Genetic Testing?\n\nGenetic testing looks for changes in someone’s genes. Gene changes can cause genetic illnesses (also called genetic disorders). They can also make someone more likely to have certain medical problems (like some cancers). Some genetic illnesses can run in families.\n\nPeople get genetic testing to see if they have genetic changes themselves or if they can pass on genetic changes to their children. Genetic counselors help people decide what tests to get and understand what the tests mean.\n\nHow Is Genetic Testing Done?\n\nGenetic tests can be done on small samples of blood or saliva (spit). In pregnant women, genetic testing can be done on amniotic fluid (through amniocentesis) or the placenta (through chorionic villus sampling). Testing can also be done on an embryo during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Usually, it takes a few weeks for test results to be ready.\n\nWhat Kinds of Genetic Tests Are There?\n\nThere are several different kinds of genetic tests. Some look at only a few genes and others look at the whole chromosome. Some look at special proteins called enzymes. Doctors and genetic counselors help families choose the right test.\n\nWhat Can Genetic Testing Find?\n\nDepending on the test, doctors can find if someone has an illness, is at risk for an illness, and/or is a carrier for an illness. A carrier doesn’t have the illness, but can pass the gene change to their children.\n\nGenetic testing usually can be done if the genetic changes for an illness are known. For example, testing can be done for:\n\ncystic fibrosis\n\nTay-Sachs disease\n\nsickle cell disease\n\nDown syndrome\n\nspina bifida\n\nTurner syndrome\n\nvon Willebrand Disease\n\nalbinism\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy\n\nIn some cases, it also can show how a person will respond to certain medicines, or if they are more likely to get some types of cancer.\n\nWho Might Want to Get Genetic Testing?\n\nPeople get genetic testing for many reasons. Pregnant women often get genetic testing on their blood as part of their regular prenatal care.\n\nSomeone might get genetic testing to:\n\nLearn if they have a genetic illness that runs in their family.\n\nSee if a current pregnancy is affected by a genetic illness.\n\nLearn what the risk is for a future pregnancy to be affected by a genetic illness.\n\nSee if they are a carrier for a genetic illness.\n\nGuide treatment plans for certain genetic illnesses.\n\nSee if a child has a genetic illness.\n\nPeople with a higher risk for having a child with a genetic illness may want genetic testing. This includes:\n\nfamilies with genetic illnesses in close relatives\n\nparents who already have a child with a genetic illness\n\ncouples who plan to start a family and one of them or a close relative has a genetic illness\n\npregnant women over age 34 or who have an abnormal prenatal screening test or amniocentesis\n\nwomen who have had two or more miscarriages, or delivered a stillborn baby with physical signs of a genetic disorder\n\nHow Does Someone Get Genetic Testing?\n\nIf someone decides they want genetic testing, they meet with a genetic counselor. The counselor can help them decide what tests to get and to understand the test results. They can talk about different options and offer support and resources.\n\nAfter talking to a genetic counselor, some people decide not to do genetic testing. It may be too expensive or cause too much worry. Othes might decide not to do it because they don’t want to know or it’s not going to change any decisions they make. There is no right or wrong answer about who should get genetic testing.\n\nWhat Else Should I Know?"
