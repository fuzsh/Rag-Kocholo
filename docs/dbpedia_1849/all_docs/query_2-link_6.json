        "text": "Single gene disorders\n\nDNA contains the instructions for making your body work. DNA is made up of two strands that wind around each other. Each DNA strand includes chemicals called nitrogen bases—T (thymine), A (adenine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine)—that make up the DNA code. Genes are specific sections of DNA that have instructions for making proteins. Proteins make up most of the parts of your body and make your body work the right way.\n\nSome diseases and conditions happen when a person has a genetic change (sometimes called a mutation) in one of their genes. These types of diseases are called single gene disorders. Sometimes, what happens is that one of the DNA bases is changed. For example, part of a gene that usually has the sequence TAC is changed to the sequence TTC. This can change the way the gene works, for example, by changing the protein that is made. In other cases, one or more of the bases in the DNA sequence are missing altogether, or there are extra bases.\n\nGenetic changes can be passed down to a child from their parents. When this happens, the disease or condition is called hereditary or inherited. Or the changes can happen for the first time in the process of making the sperm or egg or early in development, so the child will have the genetic change but the parents will not.\n\nSingle gene disorders that affect a gene on one of the 22 autosomal chromosome pairs are called autosomal disorders. Disorders that affect the sex chromosome are called X-linked disorders. Disorders are further described according to whether the affected genetic change is dominant or recessive.\n\nFor some diseases and conditions, everyone who inherits the genetic change will have the disease or condition, but how serious it is can vary from person to person. In other cases, people who have the genetic change will be more likely to develop the disease or condition, but some of them will never develop it.\n\nAutosomal dominant\n\nWith autosomal dominant diseases or conditions, a person only needs a genetic change in one copy of the gene to have the disease. If one parent has an autosomal dominant disease or condition, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting the genetic change that causes the condition.\n\nExamples of autosomal dominant conditions include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer caused by genetic changes (mutations) to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes; Lynch syndrome; and familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\nAutosomal recessive\n\nWith autosomal recessive diseases or conditions, a person needs a genetic change in both copies of the gene to have the disease or condition. While a person with a genetic change in only one copy of the gene will not have the disease or condition, they can still pass the genetic change down to their children. These parents are sometimes called \"carriers\" of the disease because they \"carry\" the genetic change that causes the disease or condition but do not have the disease themselves.\n\nA parent who is a carrier of a disease has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of passing the gene with the genetic change on to each of their children. If both parents are carriers of the disease, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of inheriting two genes with the genetic change and thus of having the disease. Carrier screening looks for autosomal recessive genetic changes in parents to see if they could have a child with the disease or condition.\n\nExamples of autosomal recessive disorders are sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis.\n\nX-linked\n\nFemales have two X chromosomes, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Each daughter gets an X from her mother and an X from her father. Each son gets an X from his mother and a Y from his father.\n\nSome diseases or conditions happen when a gene on the X chromosome has a genetic change. Because males only have one copy of all the genes on the X chromosome, they are much more likely to be affected by X-linked genetic disorders than females. A female with a genetic change on only one of her two X chromosomes may not have the disease or condition at all. However, in some cases, females with the genetic change on one of their X chromosomes can have the disease or condition, but it is often a milder form of the disease than usually occurs in males.\n\nBecause males inherit an X chromosome from their mother, a female with a genetic change on one copy of the gene has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of passing the genetic change on to each of her sons. Her sons could have the disease or condition even though she does not."
