        "text": "Diabetes (sugar disease)\n\nDiabetes is a serious, chronic disease in which blood sugar levels are above normal. Many people learn about their diabetes after problems develop. According to the American Diabetes Association, one out of three people who have type 2 diabetes do not know that they have the disease.\n\nSymptoms occur when the body fails to change sugar and other food into energy. This happens when the body cannot make or use a hormone called insulin. Serious problems from diabetes can include blindness, kidney failure, and death. Diabetes can be detected early and treatment can prevent or delay these serious health problems. Both genetic and environmental factors such as diet and exercise plays an important role in getting the disease.\n\nWhat is Type 1 Diabetes?\n\nType 1 diabetes usually develops in young children or young adults.\n\nPeople with type 1 diabetes stop making their own insulin.\n\nWhat is Type 2 Diabetes?\n\n• Type 2 diabetes usually develops in people over 30 years of age. In recent years, more young people are getting it due to poor diet.\n\n• Scientists are learning more about the specific genes involved in this type of diabetes.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nDiabetes affects about one in 13 people in the United States.\n\nFive to 10 percent of Americans with diabetes have type 1 diabetes.\n\nChildren or siblings of people with diabetes are more likely to get diabetes.\n\nObese people are more likely to get type 2 diabetes.\n\nWomen who had a baby that weighed more than 9 pounds or who had gestational diabetes while pregnant are at risk.\n\nHints for health\n\nEat more fruits and vegetables, less sugar and fat.\n\nGet active and exercise regularly.\n\nLose weight if necessary.\n\nFor more information, visit www.ndep.nih.gov or call 800-860-8747.\n\nCancer\n\nThere are many types of cancer. Cancer is caused by the growth and spread of abnormal cells. Though your risk of getting cancer increases as you get older, genetic and environmental factors also cause people to be at a higher risk for certain types of cancer. Some of the most common cancers are breast cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer.\n\nWhat is Breast Cancer?\n\nBreast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the breast, usually the ducts.\n\nBreast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women.\n\nAlthough it is rare, men can also get breast cancer.\n\nMost breast cancer can be treated if found early.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nOne out of eight American women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime.\n\nAmong Hispanic/Latina women, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer.\n\nBreast cancer risk is higher if a women has close blood relatives who have had this disease. Both your mother’s and father’s family history of breast cancer is important.\n\nHints for health\n\nWomen should do monthly breast self-exams.\n\nAfter age 40, women should get annual mammograms.\n\nAsk about genetic testing for high-risk families.\n\nEat a healthy, balanced diet.\n\nGet active and exercise regularly.\n\nLimit the alcohol you drink.\n\nFor more information, visit www.cancer.gov/cancertopics and click on “Breast Cancer” or call 800-4-CANCER (800-422-6237).\n\nWhat is Lung Cancer?\n\nLung cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in one or both of the lungs.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women.\n\nAbout 160,000 people died in the United States from lung cancer in 2007.\n\nNearly 87 percent of lung cancer cases in the United States are smoking-related.\n\nHints for health\n\nDo not smoke.\n\nAvoid secondhand smoke.\n\nFind out about testing for radon and asbestos in your home and at work.\n\nFor more information, visit www.cancer.gov/cancertopics and click on “Lung Cancer” or call 800-4-CANCER (800-422-6237).\n\nWhat is Prostate Cancer?\n\nProstate cancer develops in the male reproductive system. The prostate is a small gland near the bladder.\n\nScientists do not yet know what causes prostate cancer.\n\nDoctors have a test to find out whether a man might have prostate cancer.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nMen of all ages can develop prostate cancer. However, more than eight out of 10 cases occur in men over the age of 65.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in Hispanic/Latino and African American men.\n\nHaving a father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man’s risk for getting prostate cancer. The risk goes up with the number of relatives who have it, especially if the relatives were less than 50 years old when they got it.\n\nHints for health\n\nFollow a healthy diet.\n\nExercise regularly.\n\nAfter age 50, have your prostate checked.\n\nFor more information, visit www.cancer.gov/cancertopics and click on “Prostate Cancer” or call 800-4-CANCER (800-422-6237)."
