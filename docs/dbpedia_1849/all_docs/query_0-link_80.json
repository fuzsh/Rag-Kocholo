Before you get started, take a moment to check out IEL's latest blog on how to increase your chances of funding success, authored by IEL's Director Lucy Robinson! Lucy gives her advice on how to be really slick and efficient in preparing an effective proposal - one that ticks all the boxes of the funder and hits all the right notes. Lucy and the IEL team have worked with researchers based all around the globe for more than a decade now, helping them to secure the funds they need to support their research. And we're proud to say that we have a pretty good record of success ;-) You can find Lucy's blog here, on our website: https://lnkd.in/d3b3RFN3 ...and while you are browsing our site, you could even revisit the three-part blog series authored by IEL's Neil McCarthy. Outside of IEL, Neil is a Senior Lecturer who has recently secured himself some ¬£1.5m in research funding. So, you could say he knows his way around an effective grant proposal! But not only that, Neil has reviewed proposals for the MRC, BBSRC, and Wellcome among others. You can find part one of his blog series, here: https://lnkd.in/dnTgtAeB Happy reading!
