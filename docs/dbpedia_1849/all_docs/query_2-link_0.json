        "text": "Some genetic conditions are caused by variants (also known as mutations) in a single gene. These conditions are usually inherited in one of several patterns, depending on the gene involved:\n\nPatterns of inheritance\n\nInheritance pattern\n\nDescription\n\nExamples\n\nMany health conditions are caused by the combined effects of multiple genes (described as polygenic) or by interactions between genes and the environment. Such disorders usually do not follow the patterns of inheritance listed above. Examples of conditions caused by variants in multiple genes or gene/environment interactions include heart disease, type 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, and certain types of cancer. For more information, please see What are complex or multifactorial disorders?\n\nDisorders caused by changes in the number or structure of chromosomes also do not follow the straightforward patterns of inheritance listed above. To read about how chromosomal conditions occur, please see Are chromosomal disorders inherited?"
