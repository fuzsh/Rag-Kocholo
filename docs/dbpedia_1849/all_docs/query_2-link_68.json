        "text": "Your DNA makes up the chemical buildup of your entire existence. It’s like strings of genetic code in the smallest atoms of your body. It determines your hair and eye color, facial features, and other physical characteristics, but the slightest change to your DNA can make a significant impact. Thus is the case with genetic disorders.\n\nGenetic disorders occur when there are gene abnormalities – including gene mutations or an additional chromosome. While genetic disorders are uncommon, some abnormalities occur more often than others.\n\nThe 7 Most Common Genetic Disorders\n\n1. Down Syndrome\n\nWhen the 21st chromosome is copied an extra time in all or some cells, the result is Down syndrome – also known as trisomy 21. In the US, this occurs in about one out of every 700 babies. While most people with Down syndrome can live normal lives, they may experience some symptoms, including:\n\nPhysical growth\n\nCharacteristic facial features\n\nMild to moderate intellectual disability\n\n2. Cystic Fibrosis\n\nInherited when both parents contain the cystic fibrosis gene, the genetic disorder causes patients to produce thick and sticky mucus – inhibiting their respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. More than 30,000 people nationwide have cystic fibrosis, and their symptoms may include:\n\nVery salty-tasting skin\n\nPersistent cough\n\nFrequent lung infections – like pneumonia or bronchitis\n\nWheezing or shortness of breath\n\nPoor growth or weight gain\n\nFrequent greasy, bulky stools\n\nDifficulty making bowel movements\n\nMale infertility\n\n3. Thalassemia\n\nPart of a hereditary genetic condition, thalassemia limits the amount of hemoglobin an individual can naturally produce. There are two types of thalassemia based on which oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells is lacking – alpha and beta. About 100,000 babies are born each year with the genetic disorder, and some of the common symptoms include:\n\nSevere anemia\n\nFatigue\n\nWeakness\n\nPale or yellowish skin\n\nFacial bone deformities\n\nAbdominal swelling\n\nDark urine\n\n4. Sickle Cell Anemia\n\nSickle cell anemia is a lifelong genetic condition passed down from both parents. It causes red blood cells to change from their usual donut shape to a sickle shape – causing them to clump together and become caught in blood vessels. Approximately 100,000 Americans are affected by the disease, with common signs including:\n\nSevere pain\n\nFrequent infections\n\nOrgan damage\n\nAcute respiratory syndrome\n\nSwelling of hands and feet\n\n5. Huntington’s Disease\n\nHuntington’s disease causes certain nerve cells in the brain and central nervous system to degenerate. This causes dementia and other complications and usually doesn’t develop until the person is in their 30s and 40s. It’s estimated that one in 10,000 Americans will experience the genetic disorder. The most common symptoms include:\n\nInvoluntary jerking\n\nSlow or abnormal eye movement\n\nDifficulty speaking or swallowing\n\nLacking impulse control\n\nDiminished awareness of one’s own behavior and abilities\n\nDifficulty learning new information or processing thoughts\n\nDepression\n\nInsomnia\n\nFatigue\n\n6. Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy\n\nAlso known as DMD, Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy causes flaws in the gene that controls the health of muscles. The disease primarily impacts males, with one in 3,500 male births resulting in a child with the disorder. The condition impacts a child around three to six years old and causes the following symptoms:\n\nDifficulty rising from a lying or sitting position\n\nFatigue\n\nLarge calf muscles\n\nMuscle pain and stiffness\n\nScoliosis\n\nContractures\n\nHeadaches\n\nTrouble concentrating\n\n7. Tay-Sachs Disease\n\nLike Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs results from a defect in the 15th chromosome. It’s typically fatal when found in children, as it gradually destroys the nervous system – resulting in death by the age of five. About every one in 27 Jews in the US is a carrier of the gene. Common symptoms include:\n\nLoss of motor skills\n\nExaggerated reactions to loud noises\n\nSeizures\n\nVision and hearing loss\n\nMuscle weakness\n\nMovement problems\n\nContact Care Options for Kids For Pediatric Home Health Care\n\nIt can be hard to balance your time between work, home, and caring for a child who has a genetic disorder.
