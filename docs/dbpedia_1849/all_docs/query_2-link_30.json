        "text": "What are hereditary diseases?\n\nHereditary diseases, also known as inherited diseases or genetic disorders, are defined and categorised as being a set of genetic diseases that are caused by changes in one's genetic material (DNA). These diseases are then transmitted from generation to generation, or in other words, they are inherited from parents to their children.\n\nWhat are genetic studies and how important are they?\n\nGenetic studies allow the identification of genes related to and/or responsible for a specific pathology. In addition, they allow personalised attention to each patient, and determine the risk in those cases with a family history of the disease. If a genetic study is performed thoroughly, many deaths can be avoided.\n\nWhat are the most common hereditary diseases?\n\nThere are, unfortunately, a wide variety of hereditary diseases. The most common ones include the following:\n\nSkin cancer\n\nCardiomyopathies (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy)\n\narthritis\n\nInherited arrhythmia syndromes(sudden arrhythmic death syndrome, or SADS), long QT syndrome, Brugada, Catecholamainergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPTV).\n\nInherited aortopathies, for example Marfan syndrome\n\nBreast cancer\n\nProstate cancer\n\nLung cancer\n\nNeuromuscular disorders (eg muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy)\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia\n\nHow are hereditary diseases diagnosed?\n\nThese kinds of genetic diseases can be detected through a thorough clinical assessment, relevant imaging and where appropriate genetic testing, where DNA us extracted from a blood test and entered into panels of known genes.\n\nWhich specialist would typically deal with and treat hereditary diseases?"
