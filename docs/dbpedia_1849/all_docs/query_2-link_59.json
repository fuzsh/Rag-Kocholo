        "text": "A genetic condition is a condition or disease that is passed from one or both parents to their children. Unlike such as the common cold, genetic conditions cannot be caught by others. This makes genetic conditions non-communicable diseases.\n\nIt is important to remember that other non-communicable diseases like lung cancer are not genetic conditions, but often develop as a result of lifestyle choices like smoking. People who don't have genetic conditions but could pass them to their children are called carriers.\n\nFor relatives of people with genetic conditions, genetic testing can help them understand the chances of having children with these conditions.\n\nLearn more about inheritance.\n\nCystic fibrosis causes the build-up of sticky mucus in the gas exchange systemThe lungs and airways - including trachea, bronchi and bronchioles - that exchange oxygen in air for carbon dioxide. and the digestive system. This causes infections in the lungs and makes it difficult to digest food.\n\nNewborn babies are tested for cystic fibrosis and other genetic conditions shortly after birth. The symptoms of cystic fibrosis usually start in early childhood. Treatments help remove the mucus and reduce infection, but there is currently no cure. People with cystic fibrosis have a shorter than average life expectancy.\n\nSickle-cell disorder results in red blood cells with a sickle or crescent shape, rather than the characteristic bi-concaveA flat, disk shape with a dip on both sides to increase surface area. Red blood cells are this shape. shape. These cells do not live as long as normal cells, can carry less oxygen to the body's organs and can cause blockages in blood vessels. If these blockages are in the brain or heart, this can cause a stroke or heart attack.\n\nSickle-cell disorder is more common in people with African or Caribbean backgrounds. The symptoms usually start in early childhood. Treatments help manage the symptoms. The only cure is a bone marrowThe spongy material inside your large bones like those in your legs and hips, in which other cells are made. transplant, but this is a risky medical procedure. People with sickle-cell disorder have a shorter than average life expectancy.\n\nHaemophilia stops the blood clotting. People with haemophilia may have nosebleeds and bruises that last for a long time and have cuts that heal slowly.\n\nPeople are usually diagnosed with haemophilia in childhood. There is no cure for haemophilia, but effective treatments are available, including injections that help blood clotting. People with haemophilia are advised to avoid contact sports and reduce the likelihood of cuts and bruises."
