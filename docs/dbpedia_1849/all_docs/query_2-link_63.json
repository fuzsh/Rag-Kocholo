        "text": "What are genetic disorders?\n\nHereditary diseases, also known as genetic disorders, are inherited conditions which have been passed on through your parents’ DNA. They are very common, and more often than not you may have no idea you are a carrier of a certain condition. In the vast majority of cases, a genetic disorder is only discovered if you experience symptoms of it.\n\nHow are they passed on?\n\nGenetic disorders are passed on following very precise rules. They can be divided into two major groups: multifactorial inheritance disorders and monogenic disorders.\n\nMultifactorial inheritance disorders are caused by a combination of small inherited variations in genes, often acting together with environmental factors. Multifactorial inheritance disorders include:\n\nhypertension\n\ncoealic disease\n\ndiabetes\n\ncolon cancer\n\nheart conditions\n\nAlthough the hereditary component of multifactorial inheritance disorders consists mainly in the genetic factors, the disease will only show up when combined with environmental factors.\n\nOn the other hand, monogenic disorders are caused by a mutation in a single gene. We all carry several genetic mutations; but a small number of those can be dangerous and eventually develop into a condition.\n\nHow are they diagnosed?\n\nGenetic disorders can be diagnosed before a baby is born by carrying out an amniocentesis (a study of the baby’s DNA). It consists in several neonatal screening tests, multi-gene panel testing, in order to see if the baby is already carrying some of the genes of the most common genetic disorders.\n\nMore than 6000 genetic disorders have already been found in the UK population. The most common include:\n\nthalassemia (1 in every 2,500 children)\n\ncystic fibrosis (1 in every 2,700 children)\n\ncongenital deafness (1 in every 4000 children)\n\nfragile X syndrome (1 in every 4000 children)\n\nHow can they be treated?\n\nAs of today, some genetic disorders have no decisive treatment. Most treatment options revolve around treating the symptoms of the disorders and improving quality of life. That is the case of cystic fibrosis: treatment consists in taking antibiotics, bronchodilators, mucolytic agents, digestive enzymes and vitamins. In case of thalassemia, blood transfusions, bone marrow or stem cells transplant and following a particular diet are the main treatment options.\n\nWhich doctor should I talk to?"
