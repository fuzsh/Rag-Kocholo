A genetic disorder may be caused by a mutation in a single gene or multiple genes. It can also be due to changes in the number or structure of chromosomes.\n\nGenes are the basic unit of heredity. They hold the genetic information in the form of DNA which can be translated into useful proteins to carry out life processes. These genes undergo a mutation sometimes, which changes the instructions to formulate the protein, due to which the protein does not work properly. Such disorders are known as genetic disorders.\n\nSome genetic disorders are innate, i.e., present by birth, while others are acquired due to mutations in a particular gene. The genetic disorders that are present by birth are inherited from parents, e.g. cystic fibrosis, haemophilia, sickle cell anaemia, etc. The genetic disorders that are acquired during the lifetime are not inherited from parents, these occur due to mutations that occur randomly or due to exposure to certain chemicals, environments or radiations such as cigarette smoke, UV radiations, etc. Cancer is one such disease.\n\nThe genetic disorders can be categorized into two types, namely Mendelian Disorders, i.e., a disorder in a single gene that follows Mendelian inheritance pattern, and Chromosomal Disorders, i.e., damage or alteration in the chromosomes structure or number, the chromosomes are either missing, duplicated or a part is translocated.\n\nLet us explore genetic disorder notes to know about the different types of genetic disorders.\n\nTypes of Genetic Disorders\n\nMendelian Disorder\n\nThese disorders occur due to mutations in a single gene and can be easily detected by pedigree analysis.\n\nThese disorders can be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, sex-linked dominant, sex-linked recessive, and mitochondrial.\n\nThe most common Mendelian disorders include:\n\nCystic fibrosis (autosomal recessive)\n\nHaemophilia (sex-linked recessive)\n\nAlbinism (autosomal recessive)\n\nSickle cell anaemia (autosomal recessive)\n\nChromosomal Disorder\n\nThese disorders are caused by any alteration in the number or structure of the chromosomes.\n\nSometimes the whole chromosome is gained or lost.\n\nThis type of disorder is usually fatal and affects many genes.\n\nSome of the major chromosomal abnormalities are:\n\nDown’s syndrome- the addition of a chromosome 21 (trisomy)\n\nTurner’s syndrome-absence of an X chromosome (XO)\n\nKleinfelter’s syndrome-addition of an X chromosome (XXY)\n\nMultifactorial Genetic Inheritance\n\nThis is also known as polygenic inheritance. These are caused as a result of environmental factors and gene mutations. Some of the examples of this kind of disorder are:\n\nHeart disease\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nAlzheimer’s disease\n\nObesity\n\nDiabetes\n\nCancer\n\nArthritis\n\nMitochondrial Inheritance\n\nThis type of genetic disorder is caused by mutations in the non-nuclear mitochondrial DNA. The mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother. Some of the diseases caused due to mitochondrial inheritance are:\n\nLeber’s Hereditary Optic Atrophy (LHON)\n\nMyoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres\n\nMitochondrial encephalopathy\n\nLactic acidosis\n\nGenetic Counselling\n\nGenetic counselling is one of the remarkable ways of detecting whether a child to be born will be having a genetic disease, or if the person is going to have a genetic disorder. Genetic counsellors can help a person with the diagnosis and treatment of a particular disorder.\n\nSome genetic disorders have been treated by gene therapy. Few of the techniques are under trial and will soon be implemented in medical science to cure genetic disorders.\n\nThere are many reasons one should go for genetic counselling:\n\nFamily history or a previous child with a genetic disease, heart defects, mental retardation, defect in the neural tube, short height, psychiatric disorders, cancer, etc.\n\nA parent with an autosomal dominant disease.\n\nIf the pregnant lady is 35 years or older.\n\nMother suffering from any disorder such as depression, alcoholism, diabetes, thyroid, schizophrenia, etc.\n\nList of Genetic Disorders\n\nFollowing is the list of genetic disorders that occur in humans:\n\nCystic fibrosis\n\nThalassemia\n\nHuntington’s disease\n\nHemochromatosis\n\nTurner’s syndrome\n\nKleinfelter’s syndrome\n\nLeber’s Hereditary Optic Atrophy\n\nCancer\n\nHigh Blood Pressure\n\nObesity\n\nFor more information on Genetic Disorders and a list of genetic disorders, register at BYJU’S and refer to the genetic disorder notes for reference.\n\nBiology-Related Links:"
