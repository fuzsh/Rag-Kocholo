        "text": "What Is the Definition of Genetic Disease (Disorder)?\n\nThere are 4 types of genetic diseases.\n\nA genetic disease or disorder is any disease caused by a problem with a person’s genes. A person’s genes are contained within their genome. The human genome is made up of the 46 human chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes). These 46 chromosomes together contain over 3 billion base pairs of DNA that contain about 20,500 protein-coding genes. The actual protein-coding genes account for less than 5% of the human genome. The precise function of the 95% of remaining DNA is unclear. Some researchers include mitochondrial DNA as part of the human genome.\n\nThere are about 6000 known genetic disorders; many are fatal or cause severe problems while others may not but may add to problems that are triggered by non-genetic (for example, environmental conditions).\n\nGenetic disorders can range from a defect in a single base mutation in the DNA of one gene to chromosomal abnormalities that involve deletion or addition of entire chromosomes or sets of chromosomes. Genetic disorders can be inherited, or passed from parents to offspring, or acquired due to changes in an individual’s DNA that occur during their lifetime. Radiation and certain cancer-causing chemicals are examples of causes of acquired changes to DNA. This short article is designed to give the reader a list of groups of diseases that share genetic problems that are similar in cause. The lists have examples of genetic disease types and are not all inclusive.\n\nList of Examples of Multifactorial Genetic Inheritance Disorders\n\nA genetic disease or disorder is any disease caused by a problem with a person’s genes.
