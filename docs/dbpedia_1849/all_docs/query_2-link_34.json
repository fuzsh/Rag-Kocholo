        "text": "People inherit these conditions through the genes they receive from their parents. They are often very rare and can sometimes be identified from a parent or newborn baby's blood sample.\n\nSome conditions don't develop until a little later in life. They include mucopolysaccharide and related diseases (MPS), chronic granulomatous disease, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome – the condition Anthony Nolan had.\n\nYou can find out more about genetic diseases and get support on the Gene People website.\n\nThere are two main groups of inherited conditions.\n\nThere are many different types of PID, with different symptoms but they all share one similarity – they cause problems with the development of the immune system. Your immune system protects you from infection, so if you have a PID, you are more prone to infections.\n\nTreatment for a PID aims to control your symptoms and minimise the effect they have on your quality of life. A stem cell transplant may be considered as a curative treatment if your symptoms become unmanageable.\n\nIn 2022, 70 patients had a stem cell transplant for a PID in the UK.\n\nYou can find out more about PID on the PID on the Immune Deficiency\n\nThis is a very rare group of inherited diseases that cause problems with your metabolism (the chemical reactions that occur in the cells of your body, which allow your body to break down nutrients and create energy). If you have an IEM, your metabolism doesn’t work as well as it could, which can cause serious health problems.\n\nIn 2022, 17 patients had a stem cell transplant for an IEM in the UK.\n\nA stem cell transplant may be offered as an alternative treatment if other options are unsuccessful. Many inherited conditions are detected at birth, which means stem cell transplants may have to be given to small children.\n\nIf you’re a parent who’s supporting a child through a transplant, you can read our My child is having a transplant webpage for more information and support.\n\nThe stem cell transplant will likely be an allogeneic transplant – where new stem cells are donated from an unrelated donor. A small number of conditions can be treated with an autologous transplant – when doctors use a patient’s own stem cells.\n\nPlease speak to your transplant team for more information about your own situation, as they will be able to give you personalised, specific advice."
