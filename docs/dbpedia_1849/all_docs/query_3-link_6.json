        "text": "Carrier testing\n\nA carrier is someone who has a nonworking copy and a normal copy of the same gene. They may not have a genetic disease. But the person may be able to pass their nonworking copy of the gene on to a child. Carrier testing is done to see if a person has 1 copy of a changed gene for a disease. The disease may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that the disease occurs only if a person has 2 copies of the changed gene. Couples who both carry the same gene of an autosomal recessive condition have a 1 in 4 chance with each pregnancy to have a child with that disease.\n\nA recessive disease may also be X-linked recessive. This means that the changed gene is on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Because females have two X chromosomes, they can be carriers of a nonworking gene on one of their X chromosomes. But they are not affected by a disease if the other X has a normal copy of the gene. Males are often affected by a disease if they have the changed gene on their only copy of the X chromosome. This is because they donâ€™t have the normal copy of the gene on the Y chromosome. Carrier testing for X-linked conditions is usually done in females."
