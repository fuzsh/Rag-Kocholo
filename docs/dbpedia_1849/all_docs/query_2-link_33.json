        "text": "Our bodies are made up of millions of cells. Most cells contain a complete set of genes. Genes act like a set of instructions, controlling our growth and how our bodies work.\n\nThey are also responsible for many of our characteristics, such as our eye colour, blood type and height. We have thousands of genes.\n\nGenes are located on small thread-like structures called chromosomes. Usually we have 46 chromosomes in most cells. We inherit one set of 23 chromosomes from our mother and one set of 23 chromosomes from our father. So we have two sets of 23 chromosomes, or 23 pairs.\n\nBecause the chromosomes are made up of genes, we inherit two copies of most genes, one copy from each parent. This is the reason we often have similar characteristics to our parents. The chromosomes, and therefore the genes, are made up of a chemical substance called DNA.\n\nThe chromosomes numbered one to 22 look the same in males and females. These are called the autosomes.\n\nPair number 23 is different in males and females and they are called the sex chromosomes. There are two kinds of sex chromosomes, the X chromosome and the Y chromosome.\n\nFemales normally have two X chromosomes (XX). A female inherits one X chromosome from her mother and one X chromosome from her father. Males normally have an X and a Y chromosome (XY). A male inherits an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father.\n\nIt is important that we have the correct amount of chromosome material, as the genes (that instruct the cells in our body) are found on the chromosomes."
