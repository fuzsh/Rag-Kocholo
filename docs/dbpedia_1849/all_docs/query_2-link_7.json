        "text": "What is a genetic condition?\n\nA genetic condition occurs when you inherit an altered (changed) gene from your parents that increases your risk of developing that particular condition. However not all genetic conditions are passed down from your parents, some gene changes occur randomly before you are born.\n\nMany health conditions run in families. Genetic conditions are often called hereditary because they can be passed from parents to their children.\n\nExamples of genetic conditions include:\n\nsome cancers\n\ncystic fibrosis\n\nhigh cholesterol\n\nhaemophilia\n\nmuscular dystrophy\n\nbirth defects (for example, spina bifida or a cleft lip).\n\nFind out more about how your family’s health history can increase your risk of getting some conditions.\n\nWhat are genes?\n\nYour genes contain the information your body uses to control how you grow, develop and function. They determine most of your physical characteristics, including:\n\nwhether you are male or female\n\nblood type\n\neye colour\n\nheight.\n\nMany health conditions and diseases are also carried in our genes.\n\nYour genes are contained in a number of packages called chromosomes. You have 23 pairs of chromosomes, 46 in total. Changes in your chromosomes, such as having more than 46, can also cause genetic conditions like Down Syndrome.\n\nHow your genes affect your health\n\nAlmost all known conditions have a genetic basis. For example:\n\naround 5 per cent of cancers are passed down through families\n\nearly onset of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, cancer and osteoporosis are often because there is a family history of the condition.\n\nYour environment also interacts with your genes to increase the risk of conditions such as diabetes, asthma and autoimmune disorders.\n\nSocial changes, such as women having children later in life, are also associated with:\n\nan increased number of pregnancies at risk of genetic conditions and birth defects\n\nincreased need for pregnancy screening and diagnostic tests.\n\nHow common are genetic conditions?\n\nApproximately 6 out of 10 people will be affected by a condition which has some genetic background. Genetic conditions can range from mild to very severe.\n\nGenetic conditions and birth defects occur in between 3 and 5 per cent of babies born in Western Australia.\n\nTesting for genetic conditions\n\nGenetic tests can be used to:\n\nconfirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition\n\nassess your chance of developing or passing on a genetic condition.\n\nFind out more about the different types of genetic tests.\n\nThe role of genetics\n\nIn general, genetics play a role in the development of disease in three main ways:\n\nFirstly, there can be changes or alterations to the DNA of particular genes – these are known as Mendelian or single gene disorders.\n\nSecondly, there may be problems with the number or the structure of the chromosomes that are inherited from each parent – these are Chromosomal disorders.\n\nAnd thirdly, our genes interact with various environment and lifestyle factors to cause disease – these are Multifactorial or complex disorders.\n\nVisit the Genetics Home Reference (external site) for more information.\n\nWhere to get help\n\nTalk to your doctor.\n\nContact Genetic Services of Western Australia for more information, phone 9340 1525.\n\nRemember\n\nMany health conditions run in families.\n\nYour genes contain the information your body uses to control how you grow, develop and function.\n\nA genetic condition can be passed down through your family, increasing the risk of family members developing a condition.\n\nThis publication is provided for education and information purposes only.
