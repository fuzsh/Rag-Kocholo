        "text": "Genetic testing – sometimes called genomic testing – finds changes in genes that can cause health problems. It's mainly used to diagnose rare and inherited health conditions and some cancers.\n\nWhy would I be offered a genetic test?\n\nYou may be offered a genetic test because:\n\nyour doctor thinks you might have a health condition caused by a change to 1 or more of your genes\n\nsomeone in your family has a health condition that's caused by changes to genes\n\nsome of your close relatives have had a particular type of cancer that could be inherited\n\nyou or your partner have a health condition that could be passed on to your children\n\nIf you have any questions, talk to your doctor about having a genetic test.\n\nWhat a genetic test can tell me\n\nA genetic test can:\n\nhelp to diagnose a rare health condition in a child\n\nhelp you understand whether an inherited health condition may affect you, your child or another family member, and help you decide whether to have children\n\nshow if you are at higher risk of getting certain health conditions, including some types of cancer\n\nguide doctors in deciding what medicine or treatment to give you\n\nguide doctors on whether you're able to join a clinical trial\n\nWho can have a genetic test on the NHS?\n\nYou need to be referred for genetic testing by a doctor.\n\nTalk to your hospital specialist about whether testing is right for you.\n\nIs genetic testing free on the NHS?\n\nGenetic testing is free on the NHS if you are referred for it by a hospital specialist.\n\nYou will generally only be referred if you have a suspected genetic health condition or if you have a particular type of cancer.\n\nGenetic counselling\n\nIf you're offered a genetic test, you may be referred to a genetic counsellor to help you think through what the test means for you and your family.\n\nA genetic counsellor can help you understand:\n\nthe risks and benefits of you having a genetic test\n\nthe potential results of your test and what they mean\n\nhow your family members may be affected if the test shows a serious health condition runs in your family\n\nthe risk of you and your partner passing on a health condition to your children\n\nyour options if you have a child with an inherited health condition and you do not want your next child to inherit it\n\nA genetic counsellor can also direct you to relevant patient support groups.\n\nThe British Society for Genetic Medicine has a list of organisations that offer information and support.\n\nThe charity Genetic Alliance UK has more information about making the decision to have predictive testing.\n\nIf you decide not to have a genetic test, you will still receive care and support from healthcare professionals.\n\nThe impact on your family\n\nYou may want to consider how the results of a genetic test may affect you and others in your family.\n\nIf the genetic test shows there are changes to your genes that cause a health condition, this may mean that other members of your family also have it. In this situation, your doctor may recommend that other members of your family also have a genetic test.\n\nThere's also a chance that the test gives you information about your relatives that you or they may not have known before. For example, it may show that you were adopted or that your biological father is not who you thought they were.\n\nThis is because the test can show that you do not share genes with your family members.\n\nFind out more information from Genetic Alliance UK about the risks and benefits of genetic testing.\n\nHaving a genetic test\n\nA genetic test is usually done using a sample of your blood or saliva.\n\nIf you've been referred for a genetic test because you have cancer, the test will be done on a sample of the tumour that has already been removed as part of your treatment.\n\nThe sample of blood, saliva or body tissue is sent to a genetic testing laboratory to be analysed.\n\nGetting the results\n\nYou'll be told when to expect the results of your test. Depending on the reason for your test, it could be weeks or months. You may need further tests.\n\nThe results from the test may show:\n\nyou have a change in your genes which is known to cause a health condition\n\nyou do not have a change in your genes which is known to cause a health condition\n\nit's not clear what the results mean for your health (but doctors may have a better understanding of the results in the future)\n\nAfter you get your results, you may be referred to a genetic counsellor to help you understand what they mean for you and your family.\n\nWill it affect my insurance?\n\nWhen applying for some types of insurance policies, an insurance company may ask you to provide medical information about you and your family.\n\nYou will have to disclose a health condition that has been diagnosed by genetic testing, but you will not usually have to disclose the results of predictive genetic testing – that is testing to show if you're more likely than other people to get a certain health condition in the future.\n\nThe information that you need to share with an insurance company is regulated by a voluntary government code agreed with the Association of British Insurers called the Code on Genetic Testing and Insurance.\n\nThe NHS will not give your genetic test results to an insurance company without your consent.\n\nHow your data will be used\n\nYour genetic data includes your sample (blood, tissue or saliva), clinical information about your health condition and the results of your test.\n\nThis data may be used in:\n\nyour individual care\n\nplanning to improve the health services you and others receive\n\nresearch\n\nThe data from your genetic test is stored locally. Data from whole genome sequencing is stored in a secure national database. Where necessary, information that can identify you, such as your name and address, is removed. Your data can only be accessed by approved staff.\n\nIf you have a genetic test (including whole genome sequencing) on the NHS, it's not possible to stop your data being stored and shared. If you have already opted out of data from your health records being shared, this does not apply to your genetic test data.\n\nFind out more from NHS England about what data about you has been stored and how it is used.\n\nThe NHS is responsible for your genetic data. Find out more from NHS England about the NHS's responsibility as a data controller."
