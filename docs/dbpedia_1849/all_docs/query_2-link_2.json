        "text": "What are genetic disorders?\n\nGenetic disorders occur when a mutation (a harmful change to a gene, also known as a pathogenic variant) affects your genes or when you have the wrong amount of genetic material. Genes are made of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which contain instructions for cell functioning and the characteristics that make you unique.\n\nYou receive half your genes from each biological parent and may inherit a gene mutation from one parent or both. Sometimes genes change due to issues within the DNA (mutations). This can raise your risk of having a genetic disorder. Some cause symptoms at birth, while others develop over time.\n\nGenetic disorders can be:\n\nChromosomal: This type affects the structures that hold your genes/DNA within each cell (chromosomes). With these conditions, people are missing or have duplicated chromosome material.\n\nComplex (multifactorial): These disorders stem from a combination of gene mutations and other factors. They include chemical exposure, diet, certain medications and tobacco or alcohol use.\n\nSingle-gene (monogenic): This group of conditions occurs from a single gene mutation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat are common genetic disorders?\n\nThere are many types. They include:\n\nChromosomal disorders\n\nDown syndrome (Trisomy 21).\n\nFragileX syndrome.\n\nKlinefelter syndrome.\n\nTriple-X syndrome.\n\nTurner syndrome.\n\nTrisomy 18.\n\nTrisomy 13.\n\nMultifactorial disorders\n\nLate-onset Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nArthritis.\n\nAutism spectrum disorder, in most cases.\n\nCancer, in most cases.\n\nCoronary artery disease.\n\nDiabetes.\n\nMigraine headaches.\n\nSpina bifida.\n\nIsolated congenital heart defects.\n\nMonogenic disorders\n\nCystic fibrosis.\n\nDeafness that’s present at birth (congenital).\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia, a type of high cholesterol disease.\n\nHemochromatosis (iron overload).\n\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).\n\nSickle cell disease.\n\nTay-Sachs disease.\n\nAre there other types of genetic disorders?\n\nGenetic disorders may also cause rare diseases. This group of conditions affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. According to experts, there may be as many as 7,000 of these diseases.\n\nRare genetic disorders include:\n\nAA amyloidosis.\n\nAdrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).\n\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\nMitochondrial diseases.\n\nUsher syndrome.\n\nWhat are the causes of genetic disorders?\n\nTo understand genetic disorder causes, it’s helpful to learn more about how your genes and DNA work. Most of the DNA in your genes instructs the body to make proteins. These proteins start complex cell interactions that help you stay healthy.\n\nWhen a mutation occurs, it affects the genes’ protein-making instructions. There could be missing proteins. Or the ones you have do not function properly. Environmental factors (also called mutagens) that could lead to a genetic mutation include:\n\nChemical exposure.\n\nRadiation exposure.\n\nSmoking.\n\nUV exposure from the sun.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of genetic disorders?\n\nSymptoms vary depending on the type of disorder, organs affected and how severe it is. You may experience:\n\nBehavioral changes or disturbances.\n\nBreathing problems.\n\nCognitive deficits, when the brain can’t process information as it should.\n\nDevelopmental delays that include challenges with speech or social skills.\n\nEating and digestive issues, such as difficulty swallowing or an inability to process nutrients.\n\nLimb or facial anomalies, which include missing fingers or a cleft lip and palate.\n\nMovement disorders due to muscle stiffness or weakness.\n\nNeurological issues such as seizures or stroke.\n\nPoor growth or short stature.\n\nVision or hearing loss.\n\nHow are genetic disorders identified?\n\nIf you have a family history of a genetic disorder, you may wish to consider genetic counseling to see if genetic testing is appropriate for you. Lab tests can typically show whether you have gene mutations responsible for that condition. In many cases, carrying the mutation does not always mean you’ll end up with it. Genetic counselors can explain your risk and if there are steps you can take to protect your health.\n\nIf there’s a family history, DNA testing for genetic disorders can be an important part of starting a family. Options include:\n\nCarrier testing: This blood test shows whether you or your partner carry a mutation linked to genetic disorders. This is recommended for everyone considering pregnancy, even if there is no family history.\n\nPrenatal screening: This testing usually involves blood testing from a pregnant person that tells them how likely it is that a fetus could have a common chromosome condition.\n\nPrenatal diagnostic testing: You can find out whether the developing fetus faces a higher risk for certain genetic disorders. Prenatal testing uses a sample of fluid from your uterus (amniocentesis).\n\nNewborn screening: This test uses a sample of your newborn baby’s blood and is performed on all babies born in Ohio. Detecting genetic disorders early in life can help your child receive timely care if needed.\n\nWhat is treatment for genetic disorders like?\n\nMost genetic disorders do not have a cure. Some have treatments that may slow disease progression or lessen their impact on your life. The type of treatment that’s right for you depends on the type and severity of the disease. With others, we may not have treatment but we can provide medical surveillance to try to catch complications early.\n\nYou may need:\n\nMedications to manage symptoms or chemotherapy to slow abnormal cell growth.\n\nNutrition counseling or dietary supplements to help you get the nutrients your body needs.\n\nPhysical, occupational or speech therapy to maximize your abilities.\n\nBlood transfusion to restore levels of healthy blood cells.\n\nSurgery to repair abnormal structures or treat complications.\n\nSpecialized treatments, such as radiation therapy for cancer.\n\nOrgan transplant, which is a procedure to replace a nonfunctioning organ with one from a healthy donor.\n\nWhat do I need to know about living with a genetic disorder?\n\nWhen you are living with a genetic disorder, you may have frequent medical needs. It’s important to see a healthcare provider specializing in the condition. They are more likely to know which treatments are best for your needs.\n\nYou may also benefit from the support of others. Genetic disorders often have local or national support groups. These organizations can help you access resources that make life a little easier. They may also host events where you can meet other families going through similar challenges.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nGenetic disorders occur when a mutation affects your genes or chromosomes. Some disorders cause symptoms at birth, while others develop over time. Genetic testing can help you learn more about the likelihood of experiencing a genetic disorder. If you or a loved one have a genetic disorder, it’s important to seek care from an experienced specialist. You may be able to get additional information and help from support groups."
