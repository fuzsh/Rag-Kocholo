        "text": "Amniocentesis: A procedure in which amniotic fluid and cells are taken from the uterus for testing. The procedure uses a needle to withdraw fluid and cells from the sac that holds the fetus.\n\nAneuploidy: Having an abnormal number of chromosomes.\n\nAutosomal Dominant Disorders: Genetic disorders caused by one defective gene. The defective gene is located on one of the chromosomes that is not a sex chromosome.\n\nAutosomal Recessive Disorders: Genetic disorders caused by two defective genes, one inherited from each parent. The defective genes are located on one of the pairs of chromosomes that are not the sex chromosomes.\n\nCarrier: A person who shows no signs of a disorder but could pass the gene to his or her children.\n\nCell-Free DNA: DNA from the placenta that moves freely in a pregnant woman’s blood. Analysis of this DNA can be done as a noninvasive prenatal screening test.\n\nCells: The smallest units of a structure in the body. Cells are the building blocks for all parts of the body.\n\nChorionic Villus Sampling (CVS): A procedure in which a small sample of cells is taken from the placenta and tested.\n\nChromosomes: Structures that are located inside each cell in the body. They contain the genes that determine a person’s physical makeup.\n\nCystic Fibrosis (CF): An inherited disorder that causes problems with breathing and digestion.\n\nDiagnostic Tests: Tests that look for a disease or cause of a disease.\n\nDNA: The genetic material that is passed down from parent to child. DNA is packaged in structures called chromosomes.\n\nDown Syndrome (Trisomy 21): A genetic disorder that causes abnormal features of the face and body, medical problems such as heart defects, and mental disability. Most cases of Down syndrome are caused by an extra chromosome 21 (trisomy 21).\n\nEdwards Syndrome (Trisomy 18): A genetic condition that causes serious problems. It causes a small head, heart defects, and deafness.\n\nEgg: The female reproductive cell produced in and released from the ovaries. Also called the ovum.\n\nFertilization: A multistep process that joins the egg and the sperm.\n\nFetus: The stage of human development beyond 8 completed weeks after fertilization.\n\nGene: A segment of DNA that contains instructions for the development of a person’s physical traits and control of the processes in the body. The gene is the basic unit of heredity and can be passed from parent to child.\n\nGenetic Counselor: A health care professional with special training in genetics who can provide expert advice about genetic disorders and prenatal testing.\n\nHemoglobinopathies: Any inherited disorder that affects the number or shape of red blood cells in the body. Examples include sickle cell disease and the different forms of thalassemia.\n\nHemophilia: A disorder caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. Affected people are usually males who lack a substance in the blood that helps clotting. People with hemophilia are at risk of severe bleeding from even minor injuries.\n\nHuntington Disease: A disorder that causes loss of control of body movements and mental function.\n\nMonosomy: A condition in which there is a missing chromosome\n\nNeural Tube Defects (NTDs): Birth defects that result from a problem in development of the brain, spinal cord, or their coverings.\n\nObstetrician–Gynecologist (Ob-Gyn): A doctor with special training and education in women’s health.\n\nPatau Syndrome (Trisomy 13): A genetic condition that causes serious problems. It involves the heart and brain, cleft lip and palate, and extra fingers and toes.\n\nPlacenta: An organ that provides nutrients to and takes waste away from the fetus.\n\nScreening Tests: Tests that look for possible signs of disease in people who do not have signs or symptoms.\n\nSex-Linked Disorders: Genetic disorders caused by a change in a gene located on the sex chromosomes.\n\nSperm: A cell produced in the male testicles that can fertilize a female egg.\n\nSpinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA): An inherited disorder that causes wasting of the muscles and severe weakness. SMA is the leading genetic cause of death in infants.\n\nTrisomy: A problem where there is an extra chromosome.\n\nTurner Syndrome: A problem that affects women when there is a missing or damaged X chromosome. This syndrome causes a webbed neck, short height, and heart problems."
