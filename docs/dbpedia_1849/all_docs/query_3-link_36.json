        "text": "What is genetic testing?\n\nGenetic testing checks your genetic material for any genetic changes. These changes might be signs of a genetic condition, or they might mean that you’re more likely to get certain conditions or diseases.\n\nDepending on your situation, genetic testing can:\n\nmake a diagnosis\n\nrule out certain genetic conditions\n\nassess your chance of having a genetic condition\n\nsay how likely it is that you’ll pass on a genetic condition\n\nsay how likely it is that a genetic condition will cause disease\n\ndiagnose genetic changes before birth.\n\nGenetic testing is different from genetic counselling. Genetic counselling is mainly about communication, education and support. During genetic counselling, a counsellor explains the genetic condition you’re concerned about. They also talk with you about what a genetic condition might mean for your family, how likely you or your child are to get it or pass it on, and how you can manage the condition in your family.\n\nWhat is a genetic condition?\n\nA genetic condition is caused by changes in genes. A change in just one gene can cause a serious medical condition or disability. Sometimes one or both parents pass on changed genes to their child. Other times changes happen at or during conception.\n\nThere are many genetic conditions. Some of the more common genetic conditions include cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, neural tube defects, haemochromatosis, haemophilia and Huntington’s disease.\n\nGenetic conditions also include some forms of asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, deafness, intellectual disability, vision impairment, heart disease, cancer, primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and short stature.\n\nGenetic testing: what to expect\n\nWhen you have genetic testing, you usually have to give some blood. This is called a blood sample. It’s also common to give a saliva sample. Very rarely, you’ll be asked to give other samples, like body tissue.\n\nSamples are usually collected quickly, with very little discomfort or pain for you or your child.\n\nGenetic testing usually has 3 phases:\n\nCollection: you get information about the test, give your consent and have the sample taken.\n\nAnalysis: scientists in a laboratory do tests on the sample.\n\nResults: your doctor looks at the results and works out what they mean. Your doctor or a genetic counsellor will talk to you about the results.\n\nRisks of genetic testing\n\nAlthough genetic testing can help you a lot, it does have risks. These include the following:\n\nYou might need to ask relatives for information they don’t want to give, or genetic testing might reveal something unwelcome about a close relative.\n\nGenetic testing might reveal unwanted information about paternity or adoption.\n\nGenetic testing can make you anxious, especially while you’re waiting for results.\n\nIf the results of genetic testing aren’t definite or clear, it might be upsetting for you.\n\nThe results of genetic testing might affect your medical or life insurance policies.\n\nA diagnosis from genetic testing might not lead to treatment or improved care, and this might be frustrating or upsetting.\n\nBecause of these risks, it’s important that medical professionals fully explain the testing process to you before you consent to it.\n\nAustralian genetic testing services\n\nThe Human Genetics Society of Australasia has a list of genetic testing services across Australia.\n\nSupport for genetic testing\n\nYou can get support through the organisations listed below.\n\nGenetic Alliance Australia\n\nGenetic Alliance Australia can give you information and support after the diagnosis of a genetic condition in your family.\n\nGenetic Support Network of Victoria\n\nThe Genetic Support Network of Victoria provides education, advocacy and support to people with genetic conditions and those who support them. They can help you contact genetic counsellors and many support groups across Australia."
