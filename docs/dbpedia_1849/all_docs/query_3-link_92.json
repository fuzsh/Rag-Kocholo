        "text": "What Is Metabolism?\n\nMetabolism refers to all the chemical reactions taking place in the body to convert or use energy. A few major examples of metabolism include:\n\nBreaking down the carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in food to release energy.\n\nTransforming excess nitrogen into waste products excreted in urine.\n\nBreaking down or converting chemicals into other substances and transporting them inside cells.\n\nMetabolism is an organized but chaotic chemical assembly line. Raw materials, half-finished products, and waste materials are constantly being used, produced, transported, and excreted. The \"workers\" on the assembly line are enzymes and other proteins that make chemical reactions happen.\n\nThe code or blueprint to produce an enzyme is usually contained on a pair of genes. Most people with inherited metabolic disorders inherit two defective copies of the gene -- one from each parent. Both parents are \"carriers\" of the bad gene, meaning they carry one defective copy and one normal copy.\n\nIn the parents, the normal gene copy compensates for the bad copy. Their enzyme levels are usually adequate, so they may have no symptoms of a genetic metabolic disorder. However, the child who inherits two defective gene copies cannot produce enough effective enzyme and develops the genetic metabolic disorder. This form of genetic transmission is called autosomal recessive inheritance.\n\nThe original cause of most genetic metabolic disorders is a gene mutation that occurred many, many generations ago. The gene mutation is passed along through the generations, ensuring its preservation.\n\nEach inherited metabolic disorder is quite rare in the general population. Considered all together, inherited metabolic disorders may affect about 1 in 1,000 to 2,500 newborns. In certain ethnic populations, such as Ashkenazi Jews (Jews of central and eastern European ancestry), the rate of inherited metabolic disorders is higher.\n\nTypes of Inherited Metabolic Disorders\n\nHundreds of inherited metabolic disorders have been identified, and new ones continue to be discovered. Some of the more common and important genetic metabolic disorders include:\n\nLysosomal storage disorders: Lysosomes are spaces inside cells that break down waste products of metabolism. Various enzyme deficiencies inside lysosomes can result in buildup of toxic substances, causing metabolic disorders including:\n\nHurler syndrome (abnormal bone structure and developmental delay)\n\nNiemann-Pick disease (babies develop liver enlargement, difficulty feeding, and nerve damage)\n\nTay-Sachs disease (progressive weakness in a months-old child, progressing to severe nerve damage; the child usually lives only until age 4 or 5)\n\nGaucher disease (bone pain, enlarged liver, and low platelet counts, often mild, in children or adults)\n\nFabry disease (pain in the extremities in childhood, with kidney and heart disease and strokes in adulthood; only males are affected)\n\nKrabbe disease (progressive nerve damage, developmental delay in young children; occasionally adults are affected)\n\nGalactosemia: Impaired breakdown of the sugar galactose leads to jaundice, vomiting, and liver enlargement after breast or formula feeding by a newborn.\n\nMaple syrup urine disease: Deficiency of an enzyme called BCKD causes buildup of amino acids in the body. Nerve damage results, and the urine smells like syrup.\n\nPhenylketonuria (PKU): Deficiency of the enzyme PAH results in high levels of phenylalanine in the blood. Intellectual disability results if the condition is not recognized.\n\nGlycogen storage diseases: Problems with sugar storage lead to low blood sugar levels, muscle pain, and weakness.\n\nMitochondrial disorders: Problems inside mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, lead to muscle damage.\n\nFriedreich ataxia: Problems related to a protein called frataxin cause nerve damage and often heart problems. Inability to walk usually results by young adulthood.\n\nPeroxisomal disorders: Similar to lysosomes, peroxisomes are tiny spaces filled with enzymes inside cells. Poor enzyme function inside peroxisomes can lead to buildup of toxic products of metabolism. Peroxisomal disorders include:\n\nZellweger syndrome (abnormal facial features, enlarged liver, and nerve damage in infants)\n\nAdrenoleukodystrophy (symptoms of nerve damage can develop in childhood or early adulthood depending on the form.)\n\nDiagnosis of Inherited Metabolic Disorders\n\nInherited metabolic disorders are present at birth, and some are detected by routine screening. All 50 states screen newborns for phenylketonuria (PKU). Most states also test newborns for galactosemia. However, no state tests babies for all known inherited metabolic disorders.\n\nImproved testing technology is leading many states to expand newborn screening for genetic metabolic disorders. The National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resources Center provides information on each state's screening practices.\n\nIf an inherited metabolic disorder is not detected at birth, it is often not diagnosed until symptoms appear. Once symptoms develop, specific blood or DNA tests are available to diagnose most genetic metabolic disorders. Referral to a specialized center (usually at a university) increases the chances of a correct diagnosis."
