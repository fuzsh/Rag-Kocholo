        "text": "Latest research suggests that most cancers are caused by environmental rather than genetic factors.\n\nFolic acid taken before conception, and during at least the first 4 weeks of pregnancy, can prevent around 7 out of 10 cases of neural tube defects.\n\nMost cleft palates and cleft lips can be repaired so that appearance and speech develop normally.\n\nMost children born with cri du chat syndrome have moderate intellectual disability, with varying degrees of speech delay and some health problems.\n\nWhen a person has cystic fibrosis, their mucus glands secrete very thick sticky mucus that clogs the tiny air passages in the lungs and traps bacteria.\n\nWith the support and opportunities available to them today, most people with Down syndrome are able to achieve and participate as valued members of their community.\n\nFibrous dysplasia causes abnormal growth or swelling of bone, but it is not a form of cancer.\n\nThe facts about fragile X syndrome are complicated, and parents and family members are invited to ask their doctor to refer them to a genetics clinic.\n\nTo the casual observer, a person with Friedreich's ataxia may seem to be drunk.\n\nHaemochromatosis (iron overload disorder) tends to be under-diagnosed, partly because its symptoms are similar to those caused by a range of other illnesses.\n\nAll children with severe haemophilia are given preventative treatment with infusions of blood products before they have a bleed.\n\nThe earlier that hearing loss is identified in children, the better for the child?s language, learning and overall development.\n\nThe symptoms of Huntington's disease usually, but not always, first appear when the person is approaching middle age.\n\nKennedy's disease is a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder that causes progressive weakening and wasting of the muscles, particularly the arms and legs.\n\nPolycystic kidney disease is a common cause of kidney failure in Australia and equally affects men and women of different ethnic backgrounds.\n\nLeukodystrophy refers to a group of inherited disorders that affect the white matter of the brain, which causes loss of normal brain functions.\n\nYou should be investigated for long QT syndrome if you faint for no apparent reason, during or after exercise or emotional excitement.\n\nThe severity of symptoms or how a child with McCune-Albright syndrome will be affected throughout life is difficult to predict.\n\nPeople affected by muscular dystrophy have different degrees of independence, mobility and carer needs.\n\nNeurofibromatosis is caused by faulty genes, which may be inherited or have spontaneously mutated at conception.\n\nPKU is an inherited disorder that prevents the normal breakdown of a protein found in some foods.\n\nPorphyria can affect the skin, nervous system, gastrointestinal system or all of these, depending on the specific type.\n\nA feature of Prader-Willi syndrome is the child's excessive appetite, which often leads to obesity.\n\nThe symptoms of premature or early menopause are the same as for menopause at any age.\n\nA child with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 rarely lives beyond three years of age.\n\nThalassaemia is an inherited blood disorder that can cause anaemia or death if not treated.\n\nMilder forms of Tourette syndrome can be misdiagnosed, as it often occurs at the same time as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other disorders.\n\nTreacher Collins syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects growth and development of the head, causing facial defects and hearing loss.\n\nChildren affected by trisomy usually have a range of birth defects, including delayed development and intellectual disabilities.\n\nTuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder that affects various parts of the body to varying degrees of severity.\n\nA person with von Willebrand disease may have frequent nosebleeds, heavy menstruation or excessive bleeding from the mouth.\n\nWilliams syndrome often goes undiagnosed, which means that some people with the disorder fail to get the support and treatment they need until later in life.\n\nA predisposition to certain cancers can be inherited via altered genes.\n\nEvery newborn baby in Australia is offered a test for the rare medical conditions of phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis and congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n\nEvery newborn baby in Australia is offered a newborn bloodspot screening test to identify those at risk for rare, but serious, medical conditions including PKU, hypothyroidism and cystic fibrosis.\n\nMaternal serum screening can indicate increased risk of abnormalities in the unborn child, but is not a diagnosis."
