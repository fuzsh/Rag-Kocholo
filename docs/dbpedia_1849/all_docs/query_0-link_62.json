        "text": "ALSP is caused by mutations in the CSF1R gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1 receptor), which is found in the outer membrane of certain types of cells, including glial cells. The CSF-1 receptor triggers signaling pathways that control many important cellular processes, such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation of the cell to take on specific functions (differentiation).\n\nThe main differential for ALSP is leukoencephalopathy due to autosomal recessive mutations in the mitochondrial alanyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase gene (AARS2-L). Additional causes of symptoms could be:\n\nmultiple sclerosis\n\ncerebral vasculitis\n\nCADASIL\n\nAlzheimer disease\n\nfrontotemporal dementia\n\natypical parkinsonism\n\ncortical basal degeneration\n\nYour doctor will run all of the necessary tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. Genetic testing is available to confirm an ALSP diagnosis.\n\nWhile ALSP is usually an inherited disease, there are case reports of proven de novo mutations and mutation carriers without clinical symptoms currently up to the age of over 70 years.\n\nTypically, ALSP is caused by autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene.\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\nIn most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\n\nMy loved one was recently diagnosed with ALSP. What symptoms can I expect over the course of this disease?\n\nPatients with adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) can have a wide variety of symptoms that usually exhibit a rapid progression and lead to death within a couple of years due to progressive motor impairment. Typical symptoms are:\n\napathy\n\ndepression\n\nneuropsychiatric symptoms, progressing to dementia\n\napraxia and rarely ataxia\n\nepilepsy\n\nmotor skills are affected which causes difficulty walking.\n\nmovement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, which includes:\n\nunusually slow movement (bradykinesia)\n\ninvoluntary trembling (tremor)\n\nmuscle stiffness (rigidity)\n\nALSP was previously thought to be two separate conditions, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD), both of which cause similar white matter damage and cognitive and movement problems.\n\nPOLD was thought to be distinguished by the presence of pigmented glial cells and an absence of spheroids; however, people with HDLS can have pigmented cells, too, and people with POLD can have spheroids.\n\nHDLS and POLD are now considered to be part of the same disease spectrum, which researchers have recommended calling ALSP."
