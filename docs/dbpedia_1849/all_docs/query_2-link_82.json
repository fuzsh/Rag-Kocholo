        "text": "The terms \"hereditary\" and \"genetic\" are related but have distinct meanings. Heredity refers to traits or characteristics that are passed down from parents to their children. Genetics more broadly refers to gene variations that may be inherited at conception or acquired later often due to environmental or lifestyle factors.\n\nAll hereditary traits are genetic, but not all genetic traits are hereditary. To understand this better, it helps to learn about hereditary vs. genetic diseases. Many diseases, including diabetes and cancer, are influenced both by hereditary and genetic factors. That means that even when these diseases run in families, there are often other lifestyle and/or environmental factors at play.\n\nThis article takes a closer look at the terms hereditary vs. genetic. It also provides examples to illustrate the relationship between them.\n\nDifference Between Hereditary vs. Genetic\n\nWhile the term \"genetic\" is often used interchangeably with the term \"hereditary,\" these words don't necessarily mean the same thing.\n\nGenetics is the study of genetic variations and how genes tell our bodies to develop and function. A genetic trait is one that is determined by an individual's genetic makeup but is not necessarily passed down from parent to child through genes.\n\nHeredity is a subset of genetics that focuses on how certain traits and conditions are passed down from one or both parents through genes. If something is hereditary, it can be directly traced to a person's family history.\n\nIf something is hereditary, it is also genetic. But the same cannot be said in reverse: If something is genetic, it is not always passed down from a person's parents. Genetic variations may also be acquired due to a variety of external factors.\n\nWhat Are Somatic Mutations?\n\nSome genetic variations result from alterations in DNA that occur after conception or during a person's lifetime. These variations are called somatic mutations or somatic variants.\n\nSomatic mutations arise spontaneously when DNA gets damaged and is not repaired during DNA replication, the process when DNA is copied to produce new cells. Errors in DNA replication can result in somatic mutations in the newly formed DNA strands. Humans also develop somatic mutations as a natural part of aging.\n\nThe DNA damage that leads to somatic mutations can also occur as a result of:\n\nExposure to environmental toxins or pollution\n\nExposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun\n\nSome viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), which hijack DNA and cause somatic mutations\n\nThe accumulation of free radicals (DNA-damaging molecules) due to lifestyle stressors like poor diet, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption\n\nSomatic mutations can contribute to a number of genetic diseases. But, these mutations and any traits or conditions that result from them are genetic, not hereditary, because they cannot be passed down to future offspring.\n\nWhat Are Germline Mutations?\n\nGermline mutations, also known as germline variants and hereditary mutations, are mutations that occur in the DNA of reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and are inherited during conception.\n\nA number of hereditary diseases are associated with germline mutations, including:\n\nCystic fibrosis: This life-shortening inherited disorder causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs. People with cystic fibrosis have inherited two germline mutations of the CFTR gene—one from each parent.\n\nHuntington's disease: This progressive brain disorder is caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. Only one parent needs to have this germline mutation in order for their child to inherit it.\n\nLynch syndrome: This hereditary syndrome is caused by a germline mutation in one of several mismatch repair (MMR) genes, or genes that normally help repair errors during DNA replication. People with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of developing various types of cancer, especially colorectal cancer.\n\nHereditary vs. Genetic in Diseases\n\nBoth hereditary and genetic factors can play a role in a number of different diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes.\n\nCancer\n\nCancer develops as a result of mutations in the DNA of cells that cause those cells to divide uncontrollably. For this reason it is primarily considered a genetic disease.\n\nSome genetic mutations that cause cancer are hereditary, meaning that they are inherited from parents and increase the risk of cancer. When a cancer runs in a family, it is usually considered a hereditary cancer.\n\nExamples include mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. These cancers, like other hereditary cancers caused by inherited germline mutations, often run in families.\n\nWith that being said, cancer itself may also be triggered by genetic factors that are not inherited from parents, such as sun or tobacco exposure, which damage DNA and lead to harmful gene mutations.\n\nAlzheimer's Disease\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Less than 5% of all Alzheimer's disease cases are hereditary.\n\nHereditary Alzheimer's disease is caused by a single gene mutation that is transmitted through families. People with hereditary Alzheimer's may begin to show symptoms as early as their 30s or 40s. This particular form of Alzheimer's is called early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD).\n\nFor the majority of people with Alzheimer's disease, the exact cause is not clear. However, a combination of genetic factors, as well as environmental and lifestyle factors that influence the way genes work, are thought to play a role in its development.\n\nDiabetes\n\nType 1 and type 2 diabetes have different causes. Type 1 diabetes happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks cells in the pancreas the make insulin. Type 2 diabetes happens when the pancreas does not make enough insulin and cells in the body respond to insulin poorly.\n\nFamily and twin studies have reported heritability in 20% to 80% of diabetes cases. Additionally, research shows that people who have a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes are three times more likely to develop the disease than people who do not have a family history of it.\n\nDiabetes is not entirely hereditary, though. Researchers believe that people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes inherit a genetic predisposition to the disease, then something in the environment triggers it. Cold weather, certain viral infections, and diet in early childhood, are all possible triggers implicated in the development of diabetes.\n\nHeredity vs. Genetics in Aging\n\nThe genetic theory of aging suggests that longevity is also determined by our genes, and some research, such as studies involving identical twins, supports this hypothesis.\n\nOther studies have estimated that a person’s lifespan is only about 25% attributable to their heredity and much more likely to be influenced by lifestyle factors like diet and exercise, and harmful habits like smoking or alcohol abuse.\n\nThe Answer to Nature vs. Nurture\n\nNature vs. nurture is no longer a debate, thanks to the growing health science field of epigenetics. This emerging area of research shows how environmental influences (\"nurture\") can affect the expression of genes (\"nature\"). This explains how genetically identical twins have different skills, behaviors, health, and more. In short, the answer to the debate of nature vs. nurture is that it is almost always both.\n\nSummary\n\nHeredity and genetics often overlap, but they don't mean the same thing. If a trait or disease is hereditary, it is transmitted from one or both parents to a child. The term \"genetic\" is more broad; it refers to any variation in genes, whether inherited or acquired.\n\nHereditary diseases, like cystic fibrosis, are caused by germline mutations. Somatic mutations, on the other hand, are gene mutations that are acquired after conception. These mutations can be caused by external factors, like exposure to tobacco smoke or ultraviolet radiation from the sun, and may also lead to non-hereditary diseases."
