        "text": "Your choices for having a healthy family\n\nIf you or a family member has a serious genetic condition, you may be worried about one or more of your children inheriting that condition. In these cases, you have several options available to try and make sure the condition isn’t passed down to the next generation.\n\nYou can have your embryos tested (or screened) during IVF so that only healthy embryos are placed back in the womb. You may be able to have mitochondrial donation treatment if you have mitochondrial disease.You can consider using donor sperm, eggs or embryos or exploring adoption. There is also the option of having one or two tests during pregnancy: a chorionic villus sampling (CVS) test or an amniocentesis test which can be used to test for hundreds of genetic conditions. If the tests come back positive you can then consider how you want to proceed with the pregnancy.\n\nFind out more about screening in pregnancy from the NHS\n\nThinking through the issues\n\nHaving these kinds of treatments isn’t for everyone as in most cases it involves discarding embryos that carry the disease and only placing healthy embryos in the womb. Some people take comfort from knowing that their children won’t suffer from a serious disease, others prefer to let nature take its course. If you have any of these treatments, your clinic will give you counselling to help you think through all the issues, however, it’s worth exploring other avenues of information and support. The Genetic Alliance represents a network of charities supporting people with different genetic conditions and may be a good place to start.\n\nMitochondrial donation treatment\n\nMitochondrial donation treatment can be used by people who are at risk of passing on a serious mitochondrial disease to any children they might have. The treatment involves transferring nuclear genetic material (the genes that make you, you) from the mother’s eggs or embryos into the eggs or embryos of a donor with healthy mitochondria. Any children would still be the mother’s and father’s biologically but without the mitochondria that cause the disease.\n\nFind out more about Mitochondrial donation treatment\n\nFunding\n\nWhether you can access NHS funding for embryo testing and treatments depends on a number of different factors, including how serious the condition is, what the likelihood is of a future child inheriting it and whether you meet eligibility criteria. If you’re thinking about having a family you should go and see your GP to discuss all your options and explore what’s available on the NHS. Alternatively you could consider having treatment privately.\n\nFind out more about funding and costs of treatment"
