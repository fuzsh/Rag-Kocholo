        "text": "Your genes play an enormous role in what makes you, well, you. Since you inherit your genes from your parents, you tend to share things like hair type or athletic ability.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we can also inherit 'changes' in genes from either our mother or father, which can increase the chances of developing an inherited disease, such as cancer,\" says Tiffiney Carter, genetic counselor at Houston Methodist.\n\nMany families have a disease or condition that seems to \"run in the family.\" But when should you actually worry about it?\n\nCarter recommends following these steps if you think you or your loved ones are at risk for developing an inherited disease.\n\nLearn about your family's health history\n\nThe first step in understanding your risk is to learn about your family's health history. This means collecting information about relatives, including your parents, sisters, brothers, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.\n\n\"It's a good idea to ask about your family members' major medical conditions, including breast cancer (male and female), colon cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, stomach cancer, as well as heart conditions like arrhythmias, hypercholesterolemia and an enlarged heart,\" says Carter.\n\nShe also recommends gathering information about relatives:\n\nAge at diagnosis of a major medical condition\n\nEthnic background, for example Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry\n\nCause of death, as well as age at death\n\n\"Having three or more close relatives with the same medical condition means you could be more likely to develop that condition yourself,\" explains Carter.\n\nKnow which diseases can actually be inherited\n\nThe pattern of inheritance of some diseases is pretty straightforward, but for others it's more complicated.\n\nSometimes all it takes to develop a disease is inheriting a gene change from just one parent. This is called an autosomal dominant single-gene disorder and includes:\n\nHuntington disease\n\nMarfan syndrome\n\nNeurofibromatosis type 1\n\nIf you have one of the diseases above, there's a 50% chance it will be passed on to each of your children.\n\nOther times, both parents have to contribute a change in the same gene in order for a child to develop the genetic condition. This is called an autosomal recessive single-gene disorder and includes:\n\nCongenital deafness\n\nCystic fibrosis\n\nBeta thalassemia\n\nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA)\n\nSickle-cell anemia\n\nTay-sachs disease\n\nA recessive single-gene disorder is often passed on by parents who don't know they carry the disease. If both parents are a carrier of a disease, each of their children has a 25% chance of inheriting the disease and a 50% chance of becoming a carrier himself or herself. These diseases usually aren't seen in each generation.\n\nCarter says that all people probably carry about 5 or more genes associated with a recessive disorder that they may not know about.\n\nTherefore, genetic testing or screening is offered to individuals who would like to know if they are carriers of recessive disorders — such as those who plan to get pregnant or have a family history of inherited disease.\n\nSome inherited diseases are more complicated than your genes\n\nFor most diseases that \"run in the family,\" it takes more than inheriting just one change in a gene. Diseases and disorders with complex inheritance patterns include:\n\nAlzheimer's disease\n\nArthritis\n\nCancer\n\nDementia\n\nDiabetes\n\nHeart disease\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nMultiple sclerosis\n\nParkinson's disease\n\nSpina bifida\n\nThyroid disorders\n\n\"These diseases are influenced by both genes and a number of other factors, such as your environment, lifestyle and diet,\" says Carter.\n\nTalk to your doctor to determine your risk\n\nIf three of more close relatives on one side of your family have, or had, one of the diseases above, be sure to tell your doctor.\n\nDepending on your family history, your doctor may recommend:\n\nChanges to your environment, lifestyle and diet that can reduce your risk\n\nEarlier and more frequent disease screenings\n\nGenetic counseling\n\nWhen to consider genetic counseling\n\nYour doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor, like Carter, but this doesn't mean you have or will develop an inherited disease."
