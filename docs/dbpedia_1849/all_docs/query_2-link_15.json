        "text": "What is a genetic disease?\n\nAbnormalities in an individual's genetic makeup cause genetic disease.\n\nA genetic disease is any disease caused by an abnormality in the genetic makeup of an individual. The genetic abnormality can range from minuscule to major -- from a discrete mutation in a single base in the DNA of a single gene to a gross chromosomal abnormality involving the addition or subtraction of an entire chromosome or set of chromosomes. Some people inherit genetic disorders from their parents, while other changes are acquired changes or mutations in a preexisting gene or group of genes cause other genetic diseases. Genetic mutations can occur either randomly or due to some environmental exposure.\n\nThe environmental influence on genetics is currently one of the rapidly evolving areas of research (epigenetics).\n\nSingle gene inheritance disorders\n\nSingle gene inheritance is also called Mendelian or monogenetic inheritance. Changes or mutations that occur in the DNA sequence of a single gene cause this type of inheritance. There are thousands of known single-gene disorders. These disorders are known as monogenetic disorders (disorders of a single gene).\n\nSingle-gene disorders have different patterns of genetic inheritance, including\n\nautosomal dominant inheritance, in which only one copy of a defective gene (from either parent) is necessary to cause the condition;\n\nautosomal recessive inheritance, in which two copies of a defective gene (one from each parent) are necessary to cause the condition; and\n\nX-linked inheritance, in which the defective gene is present on the female, or X-chromosome. X-linked inheritance may be dominant or recessive.\n\nSome examples of single-gene disorders include\n\ncystic fibrosis,\n\nalpha- and beta-thalassemias,\n\nsickle cell anemia (sickle cell disease),\n\nMarfan syndrome,\n\nfragile X syndrome,\n\nHuntington's disease, and\n\nhemochromatosis.\n\nCommon multifactorial genetic inheritance disorders\n\nMultifactorial inheritance is also called complex or polygenic inheritance. Multifactorial inheritance disorders are caused by a combination of environmental factors and mutations in multiple genes. For example, different genes that influence breast cancer susceptibility have been found on chromosomes 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 22. Some common chronic diseases are multifactorial disorders.\n\nExamples of multifactorial inheritance include\n\nheart disease,\n\nhigh blood pressure,\n\nAlzheimer's disease,\n\narthritis,\n\ndiabetes,\n\ncancer, and\n\nobesity.\n\nMultifactorial inheritance also is associated with heritable traits such as fingerprint patterns, height, eye color, and skin color.\n\nChromosomal abnormalities\n\nChromosomes, distinct structures made up of DNA and protein, are located in the nucleus of each cell. Because chromosomes are the carriers of the genetic material, abnormalities in chromosome number or structure can result in disease. Chromosomal abnormalities typically occur due to a problem with cell division.\n\nFor example, Down syndrome (sometimes referred to as \"Down's syndrome\") or trisomy 21 is a common genetic disorder that occurs when a person has three copies of chromosome 21. There are many other chromosomal disorders including:\n\nTurner syndrome (45, X0),\n\nKlinefelter syndrome (47, XXY), and\n\nCri du chat syndrome, or the \"cry of the cat\" syndrome (46, XX or XY, 5p-).\n\nDiseases may also occur because of chromosomal translocation, a type of genetic variation in which portions of two chromosomes are exchanged.\n\nWhat is the human genome?\n\nThe human genome is the entire \"treasury of human inheritance.\" The sequence of the human genome obtained by the Human Genome Project, completed in April 2003, provides the first holistic view of our genetic heritage. The 46 human chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes) between them house almost 3 billion base pairs of DNA that contain about 20,500 protein-coding genes. The coding regions make up less than 5% of the genome (the function of all the remaining DNA is not clear) and some chromosomes have a higher density of genes than others.\n\nMost genetic diseases are the direct result of a mutation in one gene.\n\nHowever, one of the most difficult problems ahead is to further elucidate how genes contribute to diseases that have a complex pattern of inheritance, such as in the cases of diabetes , asthma, cancer, and mental illness.\n\nIn all these cases, no one gene has the yes/no power to say whether a person will develop the disease or not.\n\nIt is likely that more than one mutation is required before the disease is manifest, and a number of genes may each make a subtle contribution to a person's susceptibility to disease;\n\nGenes may also affect how a person reacts to environmental factors."
