        "text": "Serum marker testing of the mother's blood may test for chromosomal abnormalities, neural tube defects, or both.\n\nThe choice of which serum marker testing to use may depend on timing (getting test results early in pregnancy), other preferences of the prospective parents, or which test a clinic or hospital usually uses. Important markers include the following:\n\nAlpha-fetoprotein: A protein produced by the fetus\n\nPregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A): A protein produced by the placenta\n\nEstriol: A hormone formed from substances produced by the fetus\n\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin: A hormone produced by the placenta\n\nInhibin A: A hormone produced by the placenta\n\nSerum marker screening can consist of different combinations of tests. Markers are usually measured at 10 to 13 weeks of pregnancy (first-trimester screening). Other markers are measured at 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy (second-trimester screening).\n\nSometimes serum testing is done along with a test that measures fetal nuchal translucency. With this test, doctors use ultrasonography to look at a fluid-filled space near the back of the fetus’s neck.\n\nThe alpha-fetoprotein level in blood is usually measured in all pregnant women, if other testing did not include this marker (eg, some first-trimester serum marker options, chorionic villus sampling, or amniocentesis). A high level may indicate an increased risk of having\n\nA baby with a neural tube defect of the brain (such as anencephaly) or spinal cord (such as spina bifida)\n\nThe alpha-fetoprotein level may also be elevated for other reasons, including\n\nA baby with a birth defect of the abdominal wall\n\nLater pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage, or a newborn who is small for gestational age (small for how long the pregnancy has lasted), or death of the fetus\n\nUltrasonography is done if blood tests detect an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein level in a pregnant woman.\n\nAmniocentesis is an invasive test done if further testing is needed. It enables doctors to measure the alpha-fetoprotein level in the fluid that surrounds the fetus (amniotic fluid), to analyze the fetus’s chromosomes, and to determine whether the amniotic fluid contains an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase. Knowing what the alpha-fetoprotein level is and whether acetylcholinesterase is present helps doctors better assess risk for a neural tube defect or other abnormality.\n\nA high alpha-fetoprotein level or the presence of acetylcholinesterase in the amniotic fluid suggests\n\nA neural tube defect\n\nAn abnormality in another structure, such as the esophagus, kidneys, or abdominal wall\n\nA high alpha-fetoprotein level plus acetylcholinesterase in the amniotic fluid indicates a high risk of\n\nA neural tube defect, such as anencephaly or spina bifida\n\nUltrasonography is commonly done as a routine test during pregnancy. It has no known risks for the woman or fetus. Ultrasonography can do the following:\n\nIndicate whether the fetus is alive\n\nDetermine if more than one fetus is present\n\nConfirm the age of the fetus (gestational age)\n\nLocate the placenta\n\nIn the second trimester, detect certain obvious structural birth defects, including those of the brain, spinal cord, heart, kidneys, stomach, abdominal wall, and bones, some of which may indicate an increased risk of a chromosomal abnormality in the fetus\n\nFetal Ultrasound Scanning\n\nvideo\n\nIf a pregnant woman has abnormal results on a prenatal blood test or a family history of birth defects (such as heart birth defects or cleft lip and palate), ultrasonography can be done to evaluate the fetus. However, normal results do not guarantee the fetus has no abnormalities, because not all abnormalities can be detected. Certain conditions, such as neural tube defects, are still possible. Results of ultrasonography may suggest chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus, but ultrasonography cannot identify the specific problem. In such cases, amniocentesis may be recommended.\n\nTargeted ultrasonography using high-resolution equipment can be done at some specialized centers. It provides more detail and may be more accurate than standard ultrasonography, particularly for small birth defects. Targeted ultrasonography done during the second trimester can help estimate the risk of a chromosomal abnormality. Targeted ultrasonography aims to identify certain structural birth defects that indicate an increased risk of a chromosomal abnormality. This test can also detect certain variations in organs that do not affect function but may indicate an increased risk of a chromosomal abnormality. However, normal results do not necessarily mean that there is no risk of a chromosomal abnormality.\n\nOne of the most common procedures for detecting abnormalities before birth is amniocentesis. It is often offered to women over age 35 because they have a higher risk of having a fetus with chromosomal abnormalities than younger women. However, many doctors offer this test to all pregnant women, and any pregnant woman can request it, even if her risk is not higher than normal.\n\nIn this procedure, a sample of the fluid that surrounds the fetus (amniotic fluid) is removed and analyzed. Amniocentesis is usually done at 15 weeks of pregnancy or later. The fluid contains cells that have been shed by the fetus. These cells are grown in a laboratory so that the chromosomes in them can be analyzed. Amniocentesis enables doctors to measure the level of alpha-fetoprotein (a protein produced by the fetus) in the amniotic fluid. This measurement more reliably indicates whether the fetus has a brain or spinal cord defect than does measurement of this level in the woman’s blood.\n\nDetecting Abnormalities Before Birth\n\nBefore the procedure, ultrasonography is done to evaluate the heart of the fetus, to confirm the length of the pregnancy, to locate the placenta and amniotic fluid, and to determine how many fetuses are present.\n\nA doctor inserts a needle through the abdominal wall into the amniotic fluid. Sometimes a local anesthetic is first used to numb the site. During the procedure, ultrasonography is done so that the fetus can be monitored and the needle can be guided into place. Fluid is withdrawn, and the needle is removed.\n\nOccasionally, the amniotic fluid contains blood from the fetus. Such blood may increase the alpha-fetoprotein level, making the results hard to interpret.\n\nIf women have Rh-negative blood, they are given Rho(D) immune globulin after the procedure to prevent them from producing antibodies to Rh factor. When a woman with Rh-negative blood has a fetus with Rh-positive blood (called Rh incompatibility), she may produce these antibodies if the fetus's blood comes into contact with her blood, as it may during amniocentesis. These antibodies can cause problems in a fetus with Rh-positive blood. The injection is not needed if the father also has Rh-negative blood because in such cases, the fetus always has Rh-negative blood.\n\nAmniocentesis rarely causes any problems for the woman or the fetus. The following may occur:\n\nSoreness: Some women feel slightly sore for an hour or two afterward.\n\nSpotting of blood or leakage of amniotic fluid from the vagina: About 1 to 2% of the women have these problems, but the problems do not last long and usually stop without treatment.\n\nMiscarriage: The chance of miscarriage due to amniocentesis is about 1 in 500 to 1,000.\n\nNeedle injuries to the fetus: These injuries are very rare.\n\nAmniocentesis can usually be done when a woman is pregnant with twins or even more fetuses.\n\nIn chorionic villus sampling, a doctor removes a small sample of the chorionic villi, which are tiny projections that make up part of the placenta. This procedure is used to diagnose some disorders in the fetus, usually between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nUnlike amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling does not enable doctors to obtain a sample of amniotic fluid. Consequently, doctors cannot measure the alpha-fetoprotein level in amniotic fluid to check for brain and spinal cord defects (neural tube defects). Doctors may suggest that amniocentesis or blood tests to measure alpha-fetoprotein be done later in the pregnancy to check for these defects.\n\nThe main advantage of chorionic villus sampling is that its results are available much earlier in the pregnancy than those of amniocentesis. Thus, if no abnormality is detected, the couple’s anxiety can be relieved earlier. If an abnormality is detected earlier and if the couple decides to terminate the pregnancy, simpler, safer methods can be used. Also, early detection of an abnormality may give the couple more time to prepare for the birth of a child with special medical needs.\n\nBefore chorionic villus sampling, ultrasonography is done to determine whether the fetus is alive, to confirm the length of the pregnancy, to check for obvious abnormalities, and to locate the placenta.\n\nA sample of the chorionic villi can be removed through the cervix (transcervically) or the abdominal wall (transabdominally).\n\nThrough the cervix: The woman lies on her back with her hips and knees bent, usually supported by heel or knee stirrups, as for a pelvic examination. The doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through the vagina and cervix into the placenta. For most women, the procedure feels very similar to a Papanicolaou (Pap) test, but a few women find it more uncomfortable. This method cannot be used in women who have an active genital infection (such as genital herpes or gonorrhea).\n\nThrough the abdominal wall: The doctor anesthetizes an area of skin over the abdomen and inserts a needle through the abdominal wall into the placenta. Most women do not find this procedure painful. But for some women, the area over the abdomen feels slightly sore for an hour or two afterward.\n\nFor both procedures, doctors use ultrasonography to guide them as they insert the catheter or needle and suction out the tissue sample with a syringe. The sample is then sent for analysis. Many women have light spotting for a day or two after either of these procedures.\n\nAfter chorionic villus sampling, women who have Rh-negative blood and who do not have antibodies to Rh factor are given an injection of Rho(D) immune globulin to prevent them from producing antibodies to Rh factor. When a woman with Rh-negative blood has a fetus with Rh-positive blood (called Rh incompatibility), she may produce these antibodies if the fetus's blood comes into contact with her blood, as it may during chorionic villus sampling. These antibodies can cause problems in the fetus. The injection is not needed if the father also has Rh-negative blood because in such cases, the fetus always has Rh-negative blood.\n\nThe risks of chorionic villus sampling are comparable to those of amniocentesis. The most common risk is that of miscarriage, which occurs in about 1 in 500 procedures.\n\nRarely, the genetic diagnosis is unclear after chorionic villus sampling, and amniocentesis may be necessary. In general, the accuracy of the two procedures is comparable.\n\nChorionic Villus Sampling\n\nvideo"
