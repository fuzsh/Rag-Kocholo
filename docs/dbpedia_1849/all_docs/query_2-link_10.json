        "text": "Genetic disorders is a category of diseases that includes certain types of birth defects, chronic diseases, developmental problems, and sensory deficits that are inherited from one or both parents.\n\nBirth defects\n\ncataracts\n\ncleft lip or palate\n\ncongenital heart disease\n\ncontractures\n\ndiaphragmatic hernia\n\ngenital malformations\n\nglaucoma\n\nmisshapen skull\n\nmissing fingers or toes\n\nmissing or incomplete arms or legs\n\nspina bifida or open spine defects\n\nChronic diseases\n\nbleeding disorders\n\nchildhood cancers\n\nkidney or urinary tract disease\n\nslow growth or short stature\n\ncystic fibrosis\n\nsickle cell disease\n\nthalassemia\n\nDevelopmental problems\n\nautism spectrum disorders\n\nattention deficit/hyperactivity\n\ndevelopmental delay\n\nfailure to thrive\n\nlearning disability\n\nloss of developmental skills\n\nlow muscle tone\n\nmental illness\n\nmental retardation\n\nspeech problems\n\nseizures\n\nSensory deficits\n\nextreme farsightedness\n\nextreme nearsightedness\n\nhearing loss\n\nretinal or other visual problems\n\nSome of the symptoms can be the same as those for conditions that are not inherited. Features can appear at birth (congenital heart disease, or cleft lip or palate) or during the course of childhood (developmental delays or learning problems). Diagnosis may involve a physical exam or targeted genetic testing.\n\nWhat are the physical signs of genetic disorders?\n\nThe following list includes features that might suggest that your child has a genetic disorder. However, some of these characteristics are commonly found in people without a disorder. You'll want to check with your doctor if your child has at least two of the following features:\n\near abnormalities\n\nunusually shaped eyes\n\ndifferent colored eyes\n\nfacial features that are unusual or different from other family members\n\nbrittle or sparse hair\n\nexcessive body hair\n\nwhite patches of hair\n\nlarge or small tongue\n\nmisshapen teeth\n\nmissing or extra teeth\n\nloose or stiff joints\n\nunusually tall or short stature\n\nwebbed fingers or toes\n\nexcessive skin\n\nunusual birthmarks\n\nincreased or decreased sweating\n\nunusual body odor\n\nWhat is genetic counseling and how do I know if I need it?\n\nGenetic counseling can tell you whether you're at risk of developing a genetic disorder or having a child with a genetic disorder. Genetic counseling can also help you to make sense of the information and put it into context for your child. It may be conducted by a geneticist, a doctor with special training, or a genetic counselor, who will explain the cause of a disorder, availability of testing, prognosis, medical management, and treatment. Genetic counseling sessions typically last an hour or longer, depending on the complexity of your child's case is. There are many reasons to seek genetic counseling, including the following:\n\n1. family history or previous child with:\n\nchromosome abnormalities (such as Down syndrome)\n\ncleft lip/palate\n\nheart defects\n\nmental retardation\n\nneural tube defects\n\nshort stature\n\nsingle gene defects (such as cystic fibrosis or PKU)\n\nhearing or visual impairments\n\nlearning disabilities\n\npsychiatric disorders\n\ncancers\n\nmultiple pregnancy losses (miscarriages, stillbirths, or infant deaths)\n\n2. a parent with an autosomal dominant disorder, or any disorder seen in several generations\n\n3. pregnancy factors (mother older than 35 years)\n\n4. mother with any of the following:\n\nschizophrenia\n\ndepression\n\nseizures\n\nalcoholism\n\ndiabetes\n\nthyroid disorder\n\nfetal or parental exposure to certain drugs, chemicals, radiation, or infections\n\nadvanced paternal age at the time of conception\n\ninfertility cases where either parent is suspected of having a chromosome abnormality\n\ncouples requiring assisted reproductive techniques to achieve a pregnancy, or individuals donating eggs or sperm for those purposes\n\nethnic groups or geographic areas with a higher incidence of certain disorders, such as Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell disease, or thalassemia\n\nHow we care for genetic disorders"
