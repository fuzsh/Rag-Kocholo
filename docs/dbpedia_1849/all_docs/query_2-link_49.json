        "text": "What are genetic disorders?\n\nGenetic disorders result from a mutation, i.e., a harmful change in your genes or when there is a change in the number of genes. Your genes comprise deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contains essential information and instructions that make you unique. Your DNA is what controls a lot of cell functions and characteristics that are inherently you.\n\nDuring conception, you receive half your genes from your biological mother and the other half from your biological father; due to this, you are at risk of inheriting a mutation in your genes if one or more parents contain that mutation. A mutation in your DNA can also affect your genes, resulting in genetic disorders that are present since birth or can develop over time.\n\nThere are three main types of genetic conditions,\n\nChromosomal: In this type of genetic disease, the chromosomes, which are the structure that holds your genes, are affected. In this type of genetic disease, an individual can have missing or duplicated chromosomal material.\n\nMultifactorial or complex: The disorder is caused by a combination of gene mutations. Other factors such as chemical exposure, certain medicines, tobacco or alcohol use, and diet can also play a role in such diseases.\n\nMonogenic or single-gene: The conditions in this category are caused by single-gene mutations\n\nWhat are common genetic disorders?\n\nSome of the common types of genetic disorders include\n\nChromosomal genetic disease list\n\nKlienefelter syndrome\n\nFragileX syndrome\n\nDown syndrome\n\nTurner syndrome\n\nTrisomy 18\n\nTrisomy 13\n\nTriple-X syndrome\n\nMultifactorial Disorders\n\nLate-onset Alzheimers\n\nArthritis\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (most cases)\n\nCancer (most cases)\n\nSpina bifida\n\nDiabetes\n\nCoronary artery disease\n\nMigraine headaches\n\nIsolated congenital heart defects\n\nMonogenic Disorders\n\nCongenital deafness (present since birth)\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy\n\nCystic fibrosis\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia (a type of high-cholesterol disease)\n\nHemochromatosis (overload of iron)\n\nSickle cell disease\n\nNeurofibromatosis\n\nTay-Sachs disease\n\nAre there other types of genetic disorders?\n\nMany genetic diseases can also be the cause of several rare diseases. Research says that there may be more than 7,000 different types of rare genetic disorders, including\n\nAdrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)\n\nAA amyloidosis\n\nEhlers-Danlos Syndrome\n\nMitochondrial diseases\n\nUshers syndrome\n\nWhat are the causes of genetic disorders?\n\nLearning how your genes work is the first step towards understanding what causes genetic disorders. Most of the DNA in your genes controls protein production in your body. These proteins are needed for the complicated cell interactions that keep you healthy.\n\nAny change or mutation in your genes affects this protein-making ability, which could lead to missing proteins that are abnormal functioning of the ones you have. Here are a few environmental factors that can also result in the cause of gene mutation,\n\nSmoking\n\nExposure to UV rays of the sun\n\nExposure to radiation\n\nExposure to harmful chemicals\n\nWhat are the symptoms of a genetic disorder?\n\nThe symptoms of genetic abnormalities depend on several factors, such as the type of disorder, the organs affected, and the severity of the disease. Some of the common genetic disorder symptoms include\n\nChanges or disturbances in behaviour\n\nProblems breathing\n\nEating and digestive issues like difficulty swallowing or inability to process nutrients effectively.\n\nMovement disorders because of weakness or muscle stiffness\n\nPoor growth or short stature\n\nSymptoms of genetic disorders in children include\n\nAbnormalities in the face or limbs like missing fingers or cleft lip or palate\n\nDevelopmental delay, including speech and social skills\n\nCognitive defects in which the brain doesn't process information like it should\n\nVision or hearing loss\n\nHow are genetic disorders identified?\n\nIf you or your family members have a history of genetic or hereditary diseases, you may need to consider genetic counselling. To understand if you need genetic testing. Several lab tests can help show whether gene mutations are responsible for your health condition. In most cases, you may not always have a condition, even if you have a genetic mutation. A genetic counsellor can help you understand the risks and if there are any steps that you can take to protect your health.\n\nIf you have a family history of genetic disorders, getting a DNA test for genetic conditions may be an essential step required when starting a family.\n\nThese tests include\n\nCarrier testing: A blood test is carried out to check if your partner or you are carriers for genetic disorders.\n\nPrenatal screening: This test involves a blood test from a pregnant woman that can tell if her fetus is at risk of developing common chromosomal conditions.\n\nPrenatal diagnostic testing: Here, you can find out if your developing fetus may have a higher risk of certain genetic disorders. For the test, a sample of your amniotic fluid is used.\n\nNewborn screening: For this test, a blood sample will be taken from your baby and tested for genetic disorders to facilitate early diagnosis and timely treatment of genetic problems.\n\nWhat is the treatment for genetic disorders like?\n\nA genetic disorder rarely has a cure, but there are different treatment options which can help slow the progression of the disease and lessen the impact of it on your daily life. Your doctor will help you decide which is the right treatment option for you by taking into account the type of genetic disorder you have and the severity of the disease. In the case of genetic problems that do not have a treatment, you may need to be put under medical surveillance to be able to catch complications at the earliest stage.\n\nSome of the treatment options for genetic disorders include\n\nMedication to manage your symptoms\n\nchemotherapy in the case of cancer to slow abnormal cell growth\n\nNutrition counselling which helps add supplements that your body needs to your diet\n\nSpeech, occupational, or physical therapy that maximises your abilities\n\nSurgeries to treat complications or repair abnormal features\n\nBlood transfusion for restoring healthy blood cells\n\nSpecialised treatments like radiation treatment\n\nOrgan transplant to replace the non-functioning organs.\n\nHow can I prevent a genetic disorder?\n\nAs a genetic disorder is engraved in your DNA, there is not much you can do to prevent it. However, you can go through genetic counselling and testing to understand the probability of developing a genetic disorder. This also helps you learn how likely you are to pass on a hereditary disease to your children.\n\nWhat is the outlook for people with genetic disorders?\n\nThe outlook for individuals with genetic disorders varies depending on the kind and severity of the disease. Sometimes, the individual may need surgery to rectify an abnormality, while others may require regular specialised care to live a comfortable life.\n\nWhat do I need to know about living with a genetic disorder?\n\nLiving with a genetic condition requires frequent medical needs. You will need to visit a healthcare professional who specialises in your condition, as they will most likely know the best treatment and management plan for you.\n\nLocal and national support groups are beneficial as you interact with individuals or parents of children living with such conditions. These groups help you access resources that make dealing with genetic disorders easier. Some support groups may also host events that bring together the families of individuals living with genetic conditions so you can meet people going through the same situation.\n\nConclusion"
