        "text": "It is your choice whether to have prenatal testing. Your personal beliefs and values are important factors in the decision about prenatal testing.\n\nIt can be helpful to think about how you would use the results of prenatal screening tests in your pregnancy care. Remember that a positive screening test tells you only that you are at higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome or another aneuploidy. A diagnostic test should be done if you want to know a more certain result. Some parents want to know beforehand that their baby will be born with a genetic disorder. This knowledge gives parents time to learn about the disorder and plan for the medical care that the child may need. Some parents may decide to end the pregnancy in certain situations.\n\nOther parents do not want to know this information before the child is born. In this case, you may decide not to have follow-up diagnostic testing if a screening test result is positive. Or you may decide not to have any testing at all. There is no right or wrong answer.\n\nAmniocentesis: A procedure in which amniotic fluid and cells are taken from the uterus for testing. The procedure uses a needle to withdraw fluid and cells from the sac that holds the fetus.\n\nAneuploidy: Having an abnormal number of chromosomes. Types include trisomy, in which there is an extra chromosome, or monosomy, in which a chromosome is missing. Aneuploidy can affect any chromosome, including the sex chromosomes. Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is a common aneuploidy. Others are Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) and Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18).\n\nCarrier Screening: A test done on a person without signs or symptoms to find out whether he or she carries a gene for a genetic disorder.\n\nCell-Free DNA: DNA from the placenta that moves freely in a pregnant woman’s blood. Analysis of this DNA can be done as a noninvasive prenatal screening test.\n\nCells: The smallest units of a structure in the body. Cells are the building blocks for all parts of the body.\n\nChorionic Villus Sampling (CVS): A procedure in which a small sample of cells is taken from the placenta and tested.\n\nChromosomes: Structures that are located inside each cell in the body. They contain the genes that determine a person’s physical makeup.\n\nCystic Fibrosis (CF): An inherited disorder that causes problems with breathing and digestion.\n\nDiagnostic Tests: Tests that look for a disease or cause of a disease.\n\nDNA: The genetic material that is passed down from parent to child. DNA is packaged in structures called chromosomes.\n\nDown Syndrome (Trisomy 21): A genetic disorder that causes abnormal features of the face and body, medical problems such as heart defects, and mental disability. Most cases of Down syndrome are caused by an extra chromosome 21 (trisomy 21).\n\nEdwards Syndrome (Trisomy 18): A genetic condition that causes serious problems. It causes a small head, heart defects, and deafness.\n\nFetus: The stage of human development beyond 8 completed weeks after fertilization.\n\nGenes: Segments of DNA that contain instructions for the development of a person’s physical traits and control of the processes in the body. The gene is the basic unit of heredity and can be passed from parent to child.\n\nGenetic Counselor: A health care professional with special training in genetics who can provide expert advice about genetic disorders and prenatal testing.\n\nGenetic Disorders: Disorders caused by a change in genes or chromosomes.\n\nInherited Disorders: Disorders caused by a change in a gene that can be passed from parents to children.\n\nMonosomy: A condition in which there is a missing chromosome.\n\nMutations: Changes in genes that can be passed from parent to child.\n\nNeural Tube Defects (NTDs): Birth defects that result from a problem in development of the brain, spinal cord, or their coverings.\n\nNuchal Translucency Screening: A test to screen for certain birth defects, such as Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome, or heart defects. The screening uses ultrasound to measure fluid at the back of the fetus’s neck.\n\nObstetrician: A doctor who cares for women during pregnancy and their labor.\n\nPatau Syndrome (Trisomy 13): A genetic condition that causes serious problems. It involves the heart and brain, cleft lip and palate, and extra fingers and toes.\n\nPlacenta: An organ that provides nutrients to and takes waste away from the fetus.\n\nScreening Tests: Tests that look for possible signs of disease in people who do not have signs or symptoms.\n\nSex Chromosomes: The chromosomes that determine a person’s sex. In humans, there are two sex chromosomes, X and Y. Females have two X chromosomes and males have an X and a Y chromosome.\n\nSickle Cell Disease: An inherited disorder in which red blood cells have a crescent shape, which causes chronic anemia and episodes of pain.\n\nTay–Sachs Disease: An inherited disorder that causes mental disability, blindness, seizures, and death, usually by age 5.\n\nTrimester: A 3-month time in pregnancy. It can be first, second, or third.\n\nTrisomy: A condition in which there is an extra chromosome.\n\nUltrasound Exams: Tests in which sound waves are used to examine inner parts of the body. During pregnancy, ultrasound can be used to check the fetus."
