        "text": "Genetic disorders are diseases that are caused by an abnormality in the genome. Abnormalities can range from a small mutation in a single gene to the addition or subtraction of an entire chromosome or set of chromosomes. Most Genetic disorders are present from birth and are quite rare, often affecting only one person in every several thousand or million. Genetic disorders are usually heritable and are passed down from the parents’ genes. Other defects are caused by new mutations (changes) to the DNA. In these cases the defect will only be heritable if it occurs in the germ line (i.e. a line of biological cells called germ cells that give rise to gamete – cells that fuse during fertilisation – e.g. ovum and sperm).\n\nWe acknowledge the land on which we operate as the traditional lands of the Kaurna people, and pay our respects to the spiritual relationship with country that all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples hold.\n\nKid Sense is founded on inclusion and the belief that everyone is welcome. All diversity is celebrated, encouraged, represented and supported in our staff, our clients, and our community. You are welcome here."
