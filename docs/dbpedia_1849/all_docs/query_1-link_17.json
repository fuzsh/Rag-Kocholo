        "text": "Results of the systematic literature search are summarized in figure 1. The literature search identified 51 individual cases that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with absence of exclusion criteria, from 31 publications [2,3,4,6,7,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36]. Including the new case described in this study, a total of 52 individual ALSP cases were subsequently analyzed. Widening the range of keywords for the search made us aware that although ALSP is rare, there was a substantial number of ALSP cases already published.\n\nOnline supplementary Appendix A (see online at www.karger.com?doi=10.1159/000331422) lists specific information extracted from 31 publications and 1 case of ALSP. Overall, there were 30 women and 21 men (1 unrecorded). Pathological diagnoses were recorded as ALSP in 8 patients, HDLS in 12 patients, POLD in 17 patients, and adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids in 15 patients. Eight diagnoses were confirmed by biopsy antemortem, while the rest were confirmed at autopsy. Mean age of onset was 42.2 ± 12.1 years, ranging from 15 to 78 years (n = 52). Initial symptoms of disease were highly varied and are listed in detail in online supplementary Appendix A. Patients could present with more than one initial symptom, which included personality or behavioral changes (n = 15), motor abnormalities (n = 15), depression or anxiety (n = 9), memory impairment (n = 9), speech abnormalities (n = 9) and seizure (n = 3).\n\nMean duration of progression was 6.2 ± 6.0 years, ranging from 2 months to 34 years (n = 45). Excluding the two extreme cases of 2 months and 34 years of progression, which were both reported by Axelsson et al. [6], mean duration was 5.7 ± 4.2 years (n = 43). Of the 45 patients who were followed until death, 24 had a disease duration of 4 years or less. Mean age of death was 48.6 ± 14.3 years, ranging from 17 to 89 years (n = 45). Of the 44 cases that did not have brain biopsies performed, 14 listed antemortem diagnoses, none of which accurately diagnosed ALSP: Pick’s disease, bvFTD or FTD (n = 4), Alzheimer’s disease (n = 2), corticobasal degeneration (n = 2), presenile dementia (n = 2), psychiatric disorder (n = 2), microvascular leukoencephalopathy (n = 1) and Binswanger leukoencephalopathy (n = 1).\n\nTwenty-five patients had at least one family member with histopathologically confirmed ALSP, belonging to 10 unique kindreds; 24 had family histories of neurodegenerative diseases, which are listed in online supplementary Appendix A.\n\nAnalysis of clinical features from 52 histopathologically confirmed cases of ALSP revealed a high frequency of clinical bvFTD features. Four patients were diagnosed antemortem with a FTD syndrome. Using 2011 bvFTD criteria, 26.9% of ALSP cases could have been diagnosed with possible bvFTD and 11.5% could have been diagnosed with probable bvFTD [10]. Furthermore, undocumented bvFTD features may have existed in some cases included in our review. For example, psychiatric symptoms of emotional lability, depression, irritability or aggression could have contributed to features typical of bvFTD – such as decline in interpersonal or personal conduct and loss of sympathy or empathy – that were not explicitly documented.\n\nThere were key distinguishing features of ALSP that are not commonly seen in bvFTD. First, the prominent white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI of ALSP cases were not consistent with ‘routine’ bvFTD imaging findings. In bvFTD, distinct atrophy is expected in frontal and temporal lobes with limited white matter damage [3,37]. Secondly, many ALSP patients had seizures. Interestingly, despite the prevalence of seizures, no patients showed epileptiform activity on EEG investigations. Abnormal EEG results are also unsupportive of bvFTD, and most ALSP patients who underwent EEG investigations had abnormal slow wave activity. Thirdly, the mean age of onset in ALSP patients (42.2 years, ranging from 15 to 78 years) was younger than that in FTD patients (60.4 years, ranging from 30 to 82 years) [38]. Finally, ALSP progressed more rapidly (mean 74.4 months) than FTD (mean 89.1 months) [38]. Common pathologies underlying rapidly progressive dementia include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, tauopathies, diffuse Lewy body disease and Alzheimer’s disease [39]. While ALSP is a comparably rare pathology, it nevertheless should be considered in the differential diagnosis of rapidly progressive dementia.\n\nALSP is pathologically distinguished by myelin loss, gliosis, neuroaxonal spheroids, macrophages with pigmented granules, sparing of subcortical U-fibers and varied but frontal-predominant white matter damage. Some cases had macrophages with intracytoplasmic ‘fingerprint’ patterns. These patterns have been observed in previous case reports and are suggestive of ceroid [12,15,18]. Since oxidative stress or decreased lysosomal proteolytic activity can lead to ceroid or lipofuscin accumulation in human glial cells [40], these patterns raise the possibility that oxidative damage plays a role in the pathogenesis of ALSP. Macrophages with granular inclusions may also be associated with solvent inhalation, but none of the ALSP cases had a recorded history of solvent exposure [41].\n\nThe past decade featured an increasing number of ALSP cases diagnosed antemortem by brain biopsy, whereas previous diagnoses had largely relied on autopsies. Historically, other diagnostic techniques in ALSP also evolved. Since the 1970s, CT imaging has revealed regional or generalized atrophy in brains of ALSP patients. EEG tests have also been used for investigations, but have not been definitively diagnostic. MRI became commonplace since the late 1990s; T2-weighted MRI has been especially important in revealing white matter changes. Functional imaging such as SPECT or PET may provide more opportunities for antemortem diagnosis of ALSP in the future."
