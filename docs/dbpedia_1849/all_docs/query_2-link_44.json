As this article from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute explains, it all depends on what kind of a disease it is. Dominant (allele) diseases, which produce structural protein failures, have a 50 percent probability of being passed along. However, recessive (allele) diseases, which produce enzyme failures, have only a 25 percent chance of being inherited.",
