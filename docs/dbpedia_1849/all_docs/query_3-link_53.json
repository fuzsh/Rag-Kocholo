        "text": "Chromosomal abnormalities, many of which involve an abnormal number of chromosomes or an abnormality in a chromosome's structure, occur in about 1 of 200 live births in the United States. Chromosomal abnormalities may be fatal to the fetus and are commonly found in a fetus when a pregnancy ends in miscarriage or stillbirth. Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common chromosomal abnormality in babies born alive.\n\nSeveral factors increase the risk of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality:\n\nMother’s age: The risk of having a baby with Down syndrome increases with a mother’s age—steeply after age 35. The chance of having a baby with Down syndrome is about 1 in 590 before age 35 and 1 in 100 at or after age 35.\n\nFather's age: If a man is older than 50 years, there may be an increased risk of some types of fetal genetic abnormalities.\n\nFamily history: Having a family history of a chromosomal abnormality increases the risk. If a couple has had one baby with the most common form of Down syndrome, the risk increases for future pregnancies.\n\nBirth defect in a previous baby: Having had a baby with a birth defect or a stillborn baby—even when it is not known whether the baby had a chromosomal abnormality—increases the risk of having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality. About 15% of babies born with a birth defect and about 8 to 16% of visibly normal stillborn babies have a chromosomal abnormality.\n\nPrevious miscarriages: Chromosomal abnormalities are estimated to be the cause of 50 to 80% of all miscarriages in the first trimester. These miscarriages are usually due to spontaneous genetic abnormalities. If a woman has had 2 or more miscarriages, the prospective parents' chromosomes should be analyzed for numeric or structural abnormalities before trying to have another baby.\n\nChromosomal abnormality in a prospective parent: Rarely, a prospective parent has a structural chromosomal abnormality, which increases the risk of having a baby with a similar abnormality. A chromosomal abnormality in one or both parents increases the risk, even if the affected parent is healthy and has no physical sign of the abnormality.\n\nDid You Know...\n\nSome chromosomal abnormalities can only be detected with specialized testing. Most of these abnormalities are too small to be seen with a microscope, so they are sometimes called submicroscopic abnormalities (or copy-number variants). For example, a very small part of a chromosome may be missing (called a microdeletion), or a chromosome may have a very small extra part (called a microduplication). Approximately 6% of children with birth defects have these types of submicroscopic abnormalities. Tests called chromosomal microarray testing can detect microdeletions and microduplications. Doctors may offer microarray testing before birth in certain circumstances—for example, when birth defects are suspected in a fetus.\n\nTable\n\nMaternal Age and Risk of Having a Baby With a Chromosomal Abnormality*\n\nTable\n\nIn single-gene disorders, only one pair of genes is involved. A gene may have a mutation, which interferes with its normal function and can lead to disease or birth defects. The risk of such disorders depends on whether the disorder develops when only one gene in the pair has a mutation (such genes are dominant) or when both genes must have mutations (such genes are recessive). (See also Inheritance of Single-Gene Disorders.)\n\nRisk also depends on whether the gene is located on the X chromosome. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes. One pair, the X and Y chromosomes (sex chromosomes), determines sex. All the rest of the chromosomes are called autosomal chromosomes. Women have two X chromosomes, and men have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. If the abnormal gene is located on the X chromosome, the disorder it causes is called an X-linked (sex-linked) disorder.\n\nIf boys inherit an abnormal gene for an X-linked disorder (on the X chromosome), they have the disorder even if the gene is recessive because they have only one X chromosome, which has an abnormal gene. They do not have a normal X chromosome to override the one with the abnormal gene. If a male fetus inherits a dominant X-linked gene, the pregnancy typically ends in miscarriage.\n\nHowever, girls must inherit two abnormal genes to develop an X-linked disorder if the gene is recessive. If the abnormal gene is dominant, only one abnormal gene is required for the disorder to develop.\n\nIf the prospective mother and father are related, they are more likely to have the same mutation in one or more of the genes that cause autosomal recessive disorders. Thus, the risk of such disorders is increased.\n\nTable\n\nWhen a Parent Has an Abnormal Gene\n\nTable\n\nNeural tube defects are birth defects of the brain or spinal cord. (The brain and spinal cord develop from a part of the embryo called the neural tube). Examples are spina bifida (in which the spine does not completely close, sometimes exposing the spinal cord) and anencephaly (in which part of the brain and skull is missing). For most of these defects, the cause is a combination of abnormal genes and other factors. Other factors include\n\nFamily history: The risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect is increased by having a family history of such a defect. If either prospective parent has had a previous baby with spina bifida or anencephaly, the risk of having another baby with one of these defects is higher. This risk increases even more if a parent has had two children with one of these defects.\n\nFolate deficiency:\n\nA few neural tube defects result from hereditary abnormalities in a single gene, from chromosomal abnormalities, or from exposure to certain medications or chemicals.\n\nCounseling about prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis and ultrasonography is recommended for women who have at least a 1% risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect."
