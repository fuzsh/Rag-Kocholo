        "text": "Who Gets the Test?\n\nGenetic testing is an option for any woman before or during pregnancy. Sometimes the baby's father gets tested, too. Your doctor may suggest genetic testing if family history puts your baby at a higher risk of inherited diseases.\n\nThe tests you need may depend on your heritage. Certain ethnic groups have a higher risk of certain diseases. For instance, people with eastern European or Ashkenazi Jewish backgrounds have a higher risk of Tay-Sachs disease and Canavan disease. Blacks have a higher risk of sickle cell disease. Whites have a higher risk of cystic fibrosis.\n\nWhat to Know About the Test Results\n\nGenetic tests don't diagnose your baby with a disease. They only tell you if your baby has a higher risk. Your doctor may suggest follow-up tests, such as amniocentesis or CVS, to get more information.\n\nTesting the father can also help. Some diseases can be inherited only if both parents carry the gene. Your doctor can rule out some problems, such as Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia, if the father tests negative -- even if you test positive."
