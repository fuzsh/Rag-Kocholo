        "text": "FRANKENSTEIN'S monster was a man at loose ends, none of which were his own. He was also, at least in the 1930 Boris Karloff movie, a figure of some pathos, stumbling through a world he never made.There is something of this same pathos in the title character of \"Charly,\" a mentally retarded young man who, through medical hocus-pocus, enjoys a brief flowering as a genius, only to slip back into the dimly lit world of the feeble-minded.\"Frankenstein\" was an unembarrassed horror movie that exploited our fears for the sheer fun of it. \"Charly,\" which opened yesterday at the Baronet, is a self-conscious contemporary drama, the first ever to exploit mental retardation for—if not the fun—the bittersweet romance of it. The movie didn't work for me.I'm not sure that somebody couldn't pull this off effectively, although it might be only slightly less difficult than making a comedy about cancer. \"Charly\" is not so much an off-beat movie as one that is out of synchronization with its apparent sentimental aim.During the first third of the movie, Charly (Cliff Robertson) is a slack-jawed but happy oaf, working in a Boston bakery, where he is tolerated as a perfect butt for cruel jokes. After a brain operation, his jaw becomes firm, his intelligence soars into the stratosphere and he has a brief, idyllic affair with his therapist (Claire Bloom). The cure, however, is only temporary, and Charly, in the last, frozen shot, is seen playing happily on a playground teeter-totter.Because Charly — even though Robertson gives an earnest performance — remains on a level either below or above the rest of us, it's really impossible to identify with him. Instead, we are forced into the vaguely unpleasant position of being voyeurs, congratulating ourselves for not being Charly as often as we feel a distant pity for him.The movie was directed by Ralph Nelson (\"Lilies of the Field,\" etc.) in a manner that might be called neo-Expo 67. He employs the split screen to show simultaneously the reactions of two people facing each other and conversing. He occasionally uses little postage stamp-sized inserts of images within the larger screen frame, a practice that might be called op montage.The effect is gaudiness without particular purpose or cohesion of style. The movie was photographed in color, in Boston, and there seems to have been a compulsion to use as much of the geography as possible for its own sake.Sterling Silliphant wrote the screenplay, based on \"Flowers for Algernon,\" which was a story and a novel by Daniel Keyes, as well as a television play starring Robertson. I'm told by someone whose opinion I respect that the novel was very moving and very sad. The movie is not. It's science-fiction without gadgets, a horror film without thrills: even the \"mad doctor\" who performs the brain surgery on Charly is an ordinary man, just a little vain.\n\nThe CastCHARLY, screenplay by Starling Silliphant, based on the short story and novel, \"Flowers for Algernon,\" by Daniel Keyes; produced and directed by Ralph Nelson, with Selig J.
