        "text": "Cliff Robertson, born in Los Angeles, California, is best known for his acting accomplishments. He stared in Charly, an adaptation of Flowers for Algernon, for which he won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Actor. Other films include Picnic, Sunday in New York, Autumn Leaves, Too Late the Hero, Three Days of the Condor, Obsession, J. W. Coop, Star 80 and Malone. Recently, Robertson's career has had a resurgence. He appeared as Uncle Ben Parker in the first movie adaptation of Spiderman, as well as in the sequels, Spiderman 2 and Spiderman 3. Robertson is also a pilot and founder of the Cliff Robertson Work Experience, within the EAA. He has owned several de Havilland Tiger Moths, a Messerschmitt Bf 109 and a Supermarine Spitfire. In 1969, Robertson helped organize an effort to fly food and medical supplies to war ravaged Biafra, Nigeria. When a famine hit Ethiopia in 1978, Robertson again organized relief flights of supplies to that country. In 1992, with Robertson as its first honorary chairman, the EAA's Young Eagles program began. In 1999, he helped kick off the EAA's campaign, \"Vision of Eagles,\" a unique set of initiatives designed to educate, motivate and provide direction to young people through aviation- based activities. Dedicated to helping others experience the joy of flight, Robertson plays an active role in his Cliff Robertson Work Experience Program. Each summer, two teenage youths are invited to Oshkosh, through the EAA Air Academy, where they work for ground and flight instruction.\n\nInducted in 2009.\n\nPortrait Location: Modern Jet\n\nInduction Video"
