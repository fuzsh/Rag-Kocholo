        "text": "Profession: Actor\n\nBiography: Cliff Robertson was an American actor best known for his portrayal of President John F. Kennedy in PT 109 (1963) and as having won an Oscar for his role in Charly (1968).\n\nRaised by his grandmother, Robertson served in the U.S. Merchant Marine during World War II. He studied at the Actors Studio in New York and started his acting career in television and on Broadway in the 1950s. Robertson made his film debut in Picnic (1955).\n\nRobertson's portrayal of John F. Kennedy in PT 109 (1963) was a significant role which, despite the film's modest reception, solidified his leading actor status. His subsequent performance in Charly (1968) was highly acclaimed and won him the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nHis later career was marked by the repercussions of revealing a Hollywood financial scandal, which led to a temporary professional setback. He continued acting in various role, however, including in the Spider-Man trilogy (2002, 2004, 2007) as Uncle Ben.\n\nOther than film, Robertson was an avid aviator whose passion for flying influenced his acting roles and led to his involvement with the Young Eagles Program. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame.\n\nBorn: September 9, 1923\n\nBirthplace: La Jolla, California, USA\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Pig\n\nStar Sign: Virgo"
