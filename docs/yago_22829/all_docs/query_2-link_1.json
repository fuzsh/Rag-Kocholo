        "text": "Cliff Robertson (born September 9, 1923, La Jolla, California, U.S.—died September 10, 2011, Stony Brook, New York) was an American actor who enjoyed a creditable career onstage and in television and movies.\n\nAfter high school, Robertson longed to go to sea and signed aboard the freighter Admiral Cole. The freighter was bombed but not sunk by a Japanese plane off the coast of the Philippines on December 7, 1941, the same day as the Pearl Harbor attack. Because of his poor eyesight, Robertson did his World War II service in the merchant marine. After the war he briefly attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Encouraged by the dean to pursue an acting career, he moved to New York, New York, where he studied at The Actors Studio.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nRobertson did much of his early work in television beginning in 1950. He made his Broadway debut in Late Love (1953) and two years later his film premiere in the romantic drama Picnic (1955). He played the lead role of guitar player Val Xavier in the original stage production of Tennessee Williams’s Orpheus Descending (1957) and received acclaim for his television performance as an alcoholic in Playhouse 90’s Days of Wine and Roses (1958).\n\nRobertson had leading parts in films such as The Naked and the Dead (1958), Gidget (1959), and Underworld U.S.A (1961), but his breakout film role was as Lieut. John F. Kennedy in the movie PT 109 (1963), about the president’s service in World War II aboard a torpedo boat sunk by the Japanese. Kennedy personally picked him for the role and advised Robertson not to imitate his distinctive accent, a choice with which Robertson heartily agreed.\n\nRobertson earned an Emmy nomination in 1961 for his performance in The United States Steel Hour’s “The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon,” which was based on Daniel Keyes’s short story “Flowers for Algernon” (1959). Robertson played a mentally disabled floor sweeper who becomes a genius through the aid of surgery, only to revert after a time to his previous state. He was so impressed by the character and the story that he bought the film rights. Robertson had been passed over for the film adaptations of Orpheus Descending (The Fugitive Kind [1960]) and Days of Wine and Roses (1962) and thus was determined to play Charlie in a film adaptation. In 1966 Robertson earned an Emmy Award for his lead role as a businessman enmeshed in a high-stakes baccarat game in the drama “The Game” (1965), which was featured on Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre. “Flowers for Algernon” was adapted as Charly (1968) with Robertson in the lead, and his dedication to the project was rewarded with the Academy Award for best actor.\n\nOn the big screen Robertson was often cast as ambitious, talented, but obsessive men, notably as a sinister political candidate in The Best Man (1964), an amoral CIA official in Three Days of the Condor (1975), and a widower tormented by the death of his wife in Obsession (1976)."
