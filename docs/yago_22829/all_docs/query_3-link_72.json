        "text": "To modern audiences, Cliff Robertson is definitely best known for playing Uncle Ben in Sam Raimi’s Spider-man films. Sadly though, the 88-year-old actor has now passed away from old age, dying just a day after his birthday.\n\nSpider-man introduced Robertson to a whole new generation, but he’s been in movies ever since the 1940s. He first found success with the 50s sci-fi serial Rob Brown Of The Rocket Rangers, in which he played the title character. This led to film roles in the likes of Gidget and PT 109, about JFK’s wartime experiences, as well as loads on TV roles.\n\nHis finest hour came in 1968, when he won an Oscar for playing the title role in Charly, as a mentally retarded man who undergoes an experiment that turns him into a genius. Robertson kept acting well into the new century, with his final role coming in small flashback scenes in 2007’s Spider-man 3.\n\nHis daughter, Stephanie Saunder said in a statement, “My father was a loving father, devoted friend, dedicated professional and honorable man. He stood by his family, friends, and colleagues through good times and bad. He made a difference in all our lives and made our world a better place. We will all miss him terribly.”\n\nCliff Robertson – September 9th, 1923-September 10th, 2011 – RIP"
