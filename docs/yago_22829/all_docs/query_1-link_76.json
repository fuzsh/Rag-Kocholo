        "text": "The ensuing scandal uncovered widespread \"creative book-keeping\" at Columbia Pictures and several other studios and resulted in major changes in Hollywood's financial practices.\n\nIn February 1977 Robertson received a demand for income tax on earnings of $10,000 that he was certain he had not been paid. When he approached Columbia about the missing cheque, he discovered that his signature had been forged and the cheque cashed in Beverly Hills.\n\nDespite receiving death threats, Robertson pressed for a full investigation. Further inquiries revealed that the culprit was the head of the Columbia studio, David Begelman.\n\nFilm bosses at Columbia closed ranks. They suspended Begelman after uncovering two more forgeries (totalling $60,000) but it was only because Robertson continued to complain about \"cover ups\" that Begelman was finally sacked.\n\nPending Begelman's trial for fraud, Robertson was warned by the FBI that he was marked man who should be \"in fear of his life\". He was warned to leave home and stay with friends. When arriving or leaving the studios, where he was filming Morning, Noon And Night, Robertson was smuggled through a back entrance, hidden under a blanket.\n\nImmediately after his conviction for fraud, Begelman was offered the job of head of production at MGM.\n\nIn a career spanning more than 50 years, Robertson had few starring roles. In his most successful film, for which he won an Oscar for best actor, he was cast against type as a mentally-retarded cleaner in Charly (1968).\n\nAlthough Robertson turned in a sensitive performance in the title role, Hollywood cynics complained that he had actually won the award because his agent had spent months publishing favourable press cuttings in Variety before finally taking out a double-page spread (containing 83 endorsements of Robertson's acting) in the week preceding the awards ceremony.\n\nClifford Parker Robertson III was born on September 9 1923 at La Jolla, California, the son of a wealthy playboy. When his parents divorced, Cliff was brought up by his Scottish grandmother who, he claimed, instilled in him a strictly Calvinistic view of the world.\n\nGraduating from La Jolla High School, he studied English Literature at Antioch College in Ohio. In his free time he worked as a reporter for the Springfield Daily News, but his real ambition was to become a playwright.\n\nAfter war service in the Merchant Marine, in 1947 Robertson moved to New York to pursue his writing career. He also took a $5-a-week backstage job with a repertory company touring the Catskill Mountains.\n\nRobertson was soon offered an acting role and made his theatrical debut in Three Men On A Horse (1947).\n\nWhen the tour ended Robertson worked as taxi-driver and docker before landing another role in a touring production of Mister Roberts (1948). In 1952 he had a small part in The Wisteria Trees (a stage adaptation of The Cherry Orchard), directed by Joshua Logan, who later offered Robertson a role in his 1965 film Picnic, starring William Holden and Rosalind Russell.\n\nHaving signed a contract with Columbia to make two films a year, Robertson played Joan Crawford's insane husband in Autumn Leaves (1956). After a short break on Broadway, appearing in Orpheus Descending, Robertson returned to Hollywood to make the forgettable Girl Most Likely in 1957. He was more successful as the wealthy young lieutenant in The Naked And The Dead (also 1957), adapted from Norman Mailer's novel about the war in the Pacific.\n\nAgainst his better judgment, Robertson was cast as a beach bum in the 1959 teenage caper Gidget. But he looked more like an off-duty bank manager than a delinquent, and returned to safer territory to play a submarine captain in The Battle Of The Coral Sea (also 1959).\n\nStill hoping to escape being typecast in war films, Robertson embarked on a clutch of ill-fated projects, beginning with The Big Show (1961) in which he played a trapeze artist; Underworld USA (1962) playing a mobster; and The Interns (also 1962) in which he was cast as a young doctor. In My Six Loves (1963), he starred as a parson who helps Debbie Reynolds to adopt six orphans before marrying her in the final reel.\n\nIn 1963 Robertson achieved national fame in the United States when he played the assassinated President John F Kennedy in the war film PT-109. As a young lieutenant Kennedy had commanded a torpedo boat in the Pacific during the Second World War and had saved the lives of several of his men with their boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer.\n\nBut PT-109 proved unpopular with audiences and lost money at the box office. It failed again when it was re-released after Kennedy's assassination.\n\nHe played a stiff-upper-lipped RAF wing commander in the British film 633 Squadron (1964); co-starred with Jack Hawkins as an American soldier of fortune in another British thriller, Masquerade (1965); played a sergeant in Up From The Beach (also 1965) and a spy in The Sunshine Patriot (1967).\n\nOn television in 1965 Robertson played the lead role in The Two Lives Of Charly Gordon, the story of a brain-damaged man who, after an operation, enjoys a short period of life as a genius before returning to his former childlike state.\n\nRobertson was convinced that the play would work as a film and was so determined not to lose the role to a bigger Hollywood name that he bought the film rights and spent two years financing the project with himself in the lead and Claire Bloom as his co-star.\n\nWhen Charly opened in 1968 it was acclaimed by both filmgoers and critics, and the following year won Robertson his only Academy Award, for Best Actor.\n\nBut if Robertson hoped to escape from what he called \"the drudgery of making war pictures\" he was mistaken. He worked in Too Late A Hero (1970), a war film starring Michael Caine. In the hope of keeping some control over his career, he decided to direct himself, and made the modern Western JW Coop in 1970. But again the film flopped at the box office and failed to cover its production costs.\n\nAfter the Begelman scandal, Robertson did not act again until 1983 when he began working with the director Douglas Trumbell on Brainstorm, a science fiction thriller. Shooting was complicated by the sudden death of Robertson's co-star, Natalie Wood, and although the project was hurriedly finished using a body double, the film was a dud.\n\nOnce the boycott on Robertson had been mysteriously lifted, he accepted roles in two films in quick succession, as an executive whose wife has an affair with a schoolboy in Class (1983) and as Hugh Hefner in Star 80 later the same year.\n\nIn the early 1990s Robertson returned to Hollywood. Perhaps predictably, one of his last films, a sailing adventure Wind (1993) did not do well at the box office.\n\nIn the course of his career, Robertson appeared in some 60 films. From 2002 he played Uncle Ben Parker in remakes of the Spider-Man series."
