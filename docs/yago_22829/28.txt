In 1969, Robertson helped organize an effort to fly food and medical supplies to war ravaged Biafra, Nigeria. When a famine hit Ethiopia in 1978, Robertson again organized relief flights of supplies to that country. In 1992, with Robertson as its first honorary chairman, the EAA's Young Eagles program began. In 1999, he helped kick off the EAA's campaign, "Vision of Eagles," a unique set of initiatives designed to educate, motivate and provide direction to young people through aviation- based activities. Dedicated to helping others experience the joy of flight, Robertson plays an active role in his Cliff Robertson Work Experience Program.
