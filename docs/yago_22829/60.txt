More recently, Robertson’s career has had a resurgence. He appeared as Uncle Ben Parker in the first movie adaptation of Spider-Man, as well as in the sequels Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. He commented on his website that “Since Spider-Man 1 and 2, I seem to have a whole new generation of fans. That in itself is a fine residual.” He was also in the horror film Riding the Bullet .
