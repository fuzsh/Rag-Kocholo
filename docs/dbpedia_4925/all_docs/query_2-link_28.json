        "text": "Hey there LinkedIn family! I said I would take a few days to regroup and recharge, and now here I am. Ready to get back to the grind and GROW some partners and CRUSH some revenue. If you know someone that needs a rockstar to bring out the best in everyone he works with, point them my way. Their -or your! - search might just be over! Thank you in advance for any connections, advice, or opportunities you can offer. #OpenToWork\n\nWell heck… in the words of the immortal Texan George Strait: what a rotten day, this turned out to be…. Even the best performers are not immune. PM for stats :-) (Picks self up, dusts self off) Regardless, I can NOT leave without saying THANK YOU to the best partners at SHI International Corp. Insight En Pointe IT Solutions I couldn’t have been victorious in the sales battle without you all!!! It has been an honor to crush quota beside you all! To my leadership and SE’s past and present thank you! For the leadership, the support, the mentoring. Cameron M. Alex Adams Amy Bravo James Kemery Matthew Kilianski Gonna take a day or two to recharge, regroup, process, LOL… and then it’s back in the saddle. To finish up with George: I ain’t here for a long time, I’m just here for a good time! And it sure as heck was! Now this is where the cowboy rides away!\n\nExtreme Networks had a heck of a time in the ATX with our amazing partner SHI International Corp. Always love getting up there and talking Extreme with their amazing peeps! Things got moving so fast, we didn't have time to snap our usual montage of photos! We even ran out of swag a little early. Overall, I'd say it was a great day! Thank you so much SHI ATX Team! Can't wait to get up there again! Cameron M. Alex Adams Anthony Maragoudakis Quincy Chrite Lou Limas Sonny Lockett III Lee Dasilva Jacob Harper Ryan Barnes Tara Anderson... and so many others! I'm sorry i couldn't remember you all!\n\nGreat time with a great partner at Insight Insight Public Sector Amplify 2024!! Amazing to see so many partners and vendors working to make a show come together! Thank you to all that came by the Extreme Networks table to check out our BoB Kit! See you in Chandler, AZ soon!\n\nWhat a day at the SHI International Corp. SHI Public Sector SKO! As a native South Texan, born and raised, I have to assume this is what the Northerners call a Winter Wonderland???? No matter! It still went down and it still was a HECK of an event! An absolute pleasure to meet so many of the partners I work with on a consistent basis, putting faces to names and personalities to individuals! Thank you to every single partner that stopped by and chatted Extreme Networks with me and my awesome SE's! See you all again soon! James Kemery Alex Adams Jay Tripathi Brian Forman Cameron M. David Baum Christina Polidura Anthony Maragoudakis Chad Renner Danielle Flaherty Dominick Fama Jeff Levin Sarah Ammons, MBA, CST Chad Cormier Ellen Bluestone Reilly Hans Eyma Josh Hulsey Eric Ceron Erin Lupo Michele V.
