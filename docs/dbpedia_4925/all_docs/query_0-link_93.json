        "text": "Mary Ann del Castillo was born 23 Oct 1859 in Florida to Louis del Castillo (1824–1866) and Inez Agnes Bonifay (1835–1916). Her siblings were:\n\nLouis Hargis del Castillo (1861–1892)\n\nFrancis del Castillo (1863–1929)\n\nCora Lee del Castillo (1866–1917) m. Walter Bicker\n\nThe 1860 Pensacola census shows her (as Mary A De Castilla, age 1) living with her mother Agnes (age 25) and her father Louis del Castillo (as De Castilla, age 36, a clerk), along with Dionisia de la Cruz (as Dianosie Michelet, age 85 – she is Louis del Castillo’s grandmother).\n\nThe 1870 census has Mary Ann (as Mary, 11) living with her mother Agnes (34, surname given as Bonifay for some reason, keeping house), her brothers Hargis (9) and Francis (7), and sister Cora Lee (as Coralie, 4). They are all living with her grandfather, Felix Manuel Bonifay (65, carpenter), as head of household. The children’s names are listed as Bonifay for some reason.\n\nIn 1880, the census shows Mary (20) living with her mother Agnes (as Agnes Castillo, 45), and her sibling Hargis (18, clerk in store), Francis (16, printer’s apprentice), and Cora (13), all living on Baylin Street.\n\nIn 1881, she married William J. Hall (1855–1900), son of William J. Hall and Margaret M. Gonzalez (1835– ).\n\nTheir children were:\n\nWilhelmina Agnes (Minnie) Hall (1883–1947) m. Cecil Lloyd\n\nWilliam Louis “Uncle Willy” Hall (1885–1979) m. 1. Bertha Torkelson, 2. Nancy Bonano\n\nMary Marguerite (Retta) Hall (1886–1944) m. William Massey\n\nLucille Irene Hall (1888–1888)\n\nMary Louise (Mae) Hall (1890–1990) m. Frank Tally\n\nEva Victoria Hall (1891–1977) m. Clyde Edward Wheat\n\nHerman Joseph Hall (1893–1986)\n\nHarold Jerome Hall (1895–1969)\n\nEthel M. Hall (1898–1899)\n\nThe 1885 Florida State Census shows her as Mary A. (25) living with her husband, William J. Hall (29), daughter Wilhelmina Agnes (W.H., 2), and son William Louis (William L., 5 months). [1]\n\nThe record of Harold’s birth in 1895 is here somewhere but I haven’t found it yet.\n\nThe 1898 birth record of daughter Ethel gives her date of birth as Sep. 11, 1898 and spells Mary Ann’s name as Mary Dil Castillo, William’s as W.J. Hall.\n\nThe 1900 census shows her living on 220 West Romana Street (as Mary, age 40), indicating that she was the mother of 9 children with 7 living. Also shown are husband William J. Hall (as W.J., 44, merchant), daughter Minnie A. (Wilhelmina, 17), son Willie (William Louis, 15, clerk), daughter Retta (Mary Margaret, 13), daughter May (Mary Louise, 10), daughter Eva (8), son Herman (6), and son Harold (5). Infant daughter Ethel, born in 1898, had died the previous year in 1899. Neighbors include the Bobe family. [2]\n\nThe family tale is that “Grandma Hall’s brothers built the house Mae lived in.” I don’t know exactly when, but the 1900 census is the first time I’ve found the address in records. There are probably records I haven’t found yet, though.\n\nThe 1910 census shows her at 220 W. Romana as widowed head of house with daughter Minnie (27), daughter Mae (19), daughter Eva (18), son Herman (16), son Harold (14), son William (25) and his wife Bertha (27), and William and Bertha’s children William (6), Wilma (2), and Inez (age 6 months). Also living there is a boarder, a divorced man named Cecil Lloyd, 35, from Ohio. Neighbors include her sister Cora Lee and husband Walter Bicker. [3]\n\nThe 1920 census shows her still at 220 West Romana, age 59, with son Harold (24), daughter Mae L. (29), Mae’s husband Frank H. Tally (30), and Mae and Frank’s children Frank H. (3), Mary L. (1), and William P. (3 months). Neighbors include Cecil Lloyd who had been a boarder in 1910 who’s now married Mary Ann’s sister Minnie. [4] Some Masseys are nearby, including sister Retta who married William Massey. [5] And some Bonifays are also on the street. [6] There are Conners, too, but I don’t know that they’re kin. [7]\n\nThe 1930 census shows her age 70 living with her daughter Mae, Mae’s husband Frank (42), their son Frank (13), daughter Mary (12), son William (10), daughter Dora (9), daughter Alice (5), and daughter Joyce (3). They are still at 220 West Romana. Neighbors include Masseys [8], Bonifays [9], and Lloyds [10].\n\nThe 1935 Florida State census shows them all at 220 West Romana still, and specifies that the widowed Mary Ann (as M.A. Hall, age 75), owns the house and had a high school education.\n\nIn 1940, the census shows her as Mary Hall, 80, living with daughter Mae (49), her husband Frank (50, clerk in deli), and their children Mary (22, secretary in optical company), William (20, technical clerk, blind company), Dora (19), Alice (15), Joyce (13).\n\nShe died on 4 Jan 1947 and is buried in St. Michael’s Cemetery with her husband William J. Hall and infant daughter Lucille Irene. FindAGrave record..\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] This appears to be a summary page with every resident listed alphabetically rather than a home-by-home census. Also appearing is Jason Hall (single, age 26), and an L. Hamilton, who appears to be Jason Hall’s brother (single, age 27) except that I am not sure we can take the order of names as indicative of household members. You can click the thumbnail (I think) to see a larger view and judge for yourself.\n\n[2] Bobe family: head J., 40; wife Alice, 37; daughter Celeste, 15; daughter Ethel, 13; daughter Josephine, 10; daughter Florence, 6; son Holland, 3.\n\n[3] At 224 West Romana are Mary Ann’s sister Cora Lee (41), married to head of household Walter Bicker (30), their son Clyde (18), daughter Hilda (17), daughter Marjorie (? – this must be Mary Lenora, 15), son Alvin (14), and mother-in-law whose name is given as Dee Castillo (74). This is Inez Agnes Bonifay (1835-1916), mother of Cora Lee and Mary Ann.\n\n[4] The Lloyds are at 216 West Romana – head of house Cecil (43) who had been a boarder at 220 West Romana in 1910, wife Minnie who is Mary Ann’s sister (36), and their daughter Ethel (4?).\n\n[5] The Masseys are at 224 West Romana Street – head of house William H (34), wife Retta (32) who is Mary Ann’s sister, and their children, son Martin (9), daughter Maria (6), and son William (4).\n\nOne house over but same street number, Reuben Massey (head of house, widowed, 62), son Reuben H Jr. (28), daughter Fody (?, 30), and son Ernest (24).\n\n[6] Another Bonifay household is at 234 West Romana, widowed head of household Laura Bonifay (64), son Henry (43), son Manuel (39), and roomer Charles New (30).\n\nAt house number 64 on Reus Street is head of household, widow Mary Wilson (62), sister Evina(?) Gentry(?) (37), nephew Henry Bonifay (44), nephew Charles Merritt (44).\n\n[7] At number 22 on Reus is William H. Conner (head, 35), Daisy (wife, 27, b. in AL), and son William (26).\n\n[8] Next door at 224 West Romana is William H. Massey (45, father b. Louisiana, mother b. Irish Free State, salesman), wife Retta (Mary Ann’s sister, 44), their daughter Marie (16), son Wilbur (14), and William Massey’s sister Fodie (42, telephone operator).\n\n[9] Up the street at 234 West Romana is head of household Laura Bonifay (74) and her son Manuel P. Bonifay (50, baggage master at a railroad)."
