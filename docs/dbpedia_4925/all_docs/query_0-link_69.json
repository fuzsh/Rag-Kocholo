        "text": "Irma Castillo still speaks with an accent, though she left the region now known as Lithuania in the years after World War II, when she was not yet 20. Though robust of build and ruddy of complexion, she now walks slowly, with a cane; her family is mostly gone now, and her companion these days is Toby, her 8-year-old St. Bernard.\n\nHer house, too, has seen better days: a one-story family home on a half-acre lot, just inside city limits on Broadway. There’s a tarp over the sagging porch roof, furniture strewn in mysterious order around the front yard, and a second dog, an anxious young pit bull named Capone, left behind by a neighbor who moved away.\n\n“Once you feed him, he’s yours,” said Castillo.\n\nIn mid-July this past summer, following what the city said was an anonymous call to the Sonoma Police Department, city building inspector Brandon Bailey visited the house. Mrs. Castillo wouldn’t let him in, so his inspection took place entirely outside the building.\n\nNonetheless he found evidence of rats, piles of debris, a collapsing front porch, a partially collapsed ceiling at the rear of the house and a sagging structural beam, as well as rotting siding.\n\nBased on those conditions, Bailey determined the property constituted “substandard housing as defined by the California Health and Safety Code,” according to the staff report. He returned the next day, July 15, and posted an order for Castillo to vacate immediately, and for the violations to be “abated by repair, replacement or removal no later than Oct. 15, 2015.”\n\nIn other words, he red-tagged the structure, and began the process to evict Irma Castillo.\n\nCastillo, 84, has lived in the house for some 40 years. Though her older children had left home by the time she and her husband moved to Sonoma from San Francisco, their youngest son Frank recalls starting his junior year at the high school up the street.\n\nAt the time the house was in the county, and the animal-loving Castillos kept a gaggle of domestic geese. When the city limits were expanded in the 1990s to include their lower Broadway location, they had to get rid of the geese.\n\n“That’s one of the little scrapes she had with the city that goes back many years,” said Bart Kemp, a Sonoma attorney who’s known her for years. Now, he is acting as one of her two pro-bono lawyers in her current “scrape” with the city. He and Greg Stubbs filed an appeal to the city’s order on July 31, arguing that Mrs. Castillo had limited or no financial resources to repair the home or relocate; if forced to leave, they said, she would become homeless.\n\nBecause of the appeal, the city’s Development Services Director Wayne Wirick Jr. obtained a warrant to inspect the interior of the house, and on Aug. 17 they did so; five city and county inspectors accompanied by two deputies from the Sonoma Police Department.\n\nAn even longer list of shortcomings and violations resulted, from structural failings, fire hazard, unsafe plumbing and electrical wiring, to infestation of insects, mice and rats throughout the house. An appendix to the staff report included 34 pages of damning photographs of the house’s dilapidated, decayed condition. If anything, the inspection reinforced the city’s determination to vacate the house by the Oct. 15 deadline.\n\nThe July and August inspections brought to stark relief the woman’s plight. “Her situation is a very sad one and one that could happen to anyone’s elderly loved one,” said Gay Johann, the city clerk.\n\n“These are the times when it is most difficult to be the enforcement agency as required by law,” said City Manager Carol Giovanatto. She added that the City and Police Department contacted county agencies to attempt to get assistance for Mrs. Castillo.\n\nHow Irma Castillo found herself living in a dilapidated house in her 80s, with no close family to care for her, is a wrenching story but unfortunately not a unique one.\n\nHer husband died in 2002. “That’s kind of why she went into a funk, she was very depressed and feeling kind of helpless,” said Greg Stubbs, the other lawyer. “She was just kind of hiding out in there.\n\nYoungest son Frank Castillo, now 54, confirms that the loss of “the patriarch of the family” was hard on his mother. “She just withdrew, she didn’t talk to anybody, and she definitely didn’t talk about finances or her personal business with anybody, including me.”\n\nIt was only after the city’s second inspection in August that he found out about his mother’s situation, and condition. “I was first made aware of this when Bart (Kemp) called me and said your mom’s in a bad way,” he said.\n\nHe lives in Dublin and works at the San Francisco Airport, but has suffered a series of recent setbacks in his own family life – including the death of his son-in-law in April – that make it impossible for him to rescue his mother from the situation.\n\n“I went up there and did what I could as far as speaking to the city, speaking to the building inspector, getting the low-down on it,” said Frank Castillo. He met with Wirick on Sept. 4. “That day I went to a Realtor and got the ball rolling to put the house on the market.”\n\nThe house was listed on Sept. 9, for an asking price of $695,000. “It’s an unfortunate situation,” said Erick Rothfeld of Wine Country Group. “She’s lived there for many years, obviously doesn’t have the funds to repair or maintain the building.”\n\nCastillo receives a little more than $1,500 a month from Social Security and a small pension. She has no savings, and there’s a reverse mortgage on the house. If she’s evicted, the city may put a tax assessment lien on the property’s sale to pay for the process – the inspections, the reports, legal fees and even the cost of a demolition. That assessment would probably reduce the final sale price. Castillo is unlikely to come out of this situation smelling like a rose.\n\n“She’s a sweet older lady who’s fallen on hard times,” said Rothfeld. “She’s been responsive to our price suggestions; she initially wanted $800,000 but we thought that might be on the aggressive side. But in this market we never know.”\n\nAccording to her son, “Since then the only offer I heard was $400,000 for the property, which I believe is worth substantially more than that, even given the condition it’s in. People buy property based on location.” There’s no faulting the location – in Sonoma, on Broadway, close to schools, on a lot zoned multi-use with high potential for development.\n\n“We will find a buyer at some point,” said Rothfeld. “Realistically, the most important thing is that there’s a housing or apartment situation for her, that’s what needs to develop in the near future.”\n\nHer lawyers agree. “It’s important for us to get Irma someplace she wants to go,” Kemp said. She has an application in to FAHA, the Finnish American Housing Association, and seemed eager to land there, calling several times a week to see if anything has come up. FAHA will also take pets, and Castillo remains devoted to Toby.\n\n“I like Finnish people, they’re true blue,” she said. “They don’t say they love you after a day or two, it takes a while until they mean it.” It seems a veiled reference to the city officials who, she feels, are responsible for this teary chapter in her long life.\n\n“It’s one of those things that shouldn’t be happening in Sonoma,” said Sonoma City Council member Gary Edwards. “If I had known about it I would have had the Rotary Club come by and clean it up, help this lady through her struggles.”\n\nEdwards found out about Castillo’s situation when her lawyers filed an appeal with the city to stay the order to vacate. The City Council is the designated board of appeals for decisions made by the building department.\n\nThe hearing was originally scheduled for Sept. 9, on the basis of the appeal’s argument that “if she was forced to leave her home she would become homeless.” It was rescheduled, at the request of Kemp and Stubbs, and heard by the City Council, acting as the Board of Appeals, on Oct. 5.\n\nStubbs, while not contesting the inspection report, explained Castillo’s personal history, her physical and financial inability to make any repairs, and her fear that she would have no place to go, and become homeless if evicted.\n\nAfter board discussion, the Board of Appeals gave her only another two weeks, ordering that Castillo must vacate on or before Oct. 31, a date set as “the beginning of the normal rainy season,” according to the draft minutes. If Castillo wants to repair the structure, she has until the end of November to make that decision, with all repairs to be made by Jan. 26, 2016. If she chooses to demolish, it must be complete by Dec. 30.\n\nThe motion carried, four to one, with Edwards dissenting. “I was seeking a longer time period to help Mrs. Castillo have a better outcome of her situation,” said Edwards. “Had we known more about this before the deadline came, there may have been time for the community to step in and help save the situation.”\n\nSo it comes down to this weekend. The clock runs out at midnight, Oct. 31. According to Wirick, “City staff will be visiting the property to ascertain if Mrs. Castillo has ceased residential use and habitation of the property as required by the resolution of the Board of Appeals. “\n\nAnd if she’s still there? “City staff will meet with the City Attorney to determine the next appropriate legal course of action.”\n\nEmail Christian at christian.kallen@sonomanews.com."
