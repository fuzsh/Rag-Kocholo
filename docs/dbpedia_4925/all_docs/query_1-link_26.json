Torres; and clerked in the Major Crimes Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida.\n\nAs a former Division 1 baseball player at both Stetson University and Tulane University, Frank understands the roles that focus, perseverance, and teamwork play in accomplishing goals. He brings those attributes to every case with a goal of serving the client’s best interests and serving the legal profession at large. During his time as a litigator, Frank has represented clients in commercial real estate disputes, partnership dissolutions, business interruption insurance, and medical service class actions.\n\nFoundationally, Frank views the practice of law as a service profession, which influences how he approaches each individual client. This perspective also drives Frank to serve those in need in the community. For the last three years Frank has represented foster youth as attorney ad litem in dependency cases and contributes his time to mentoring children and young adults.\n\nFrank attended the University of Miami School of Law where he argued the matter of Colesha Cormier v.
