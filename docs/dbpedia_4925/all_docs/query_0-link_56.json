        "text": "Lorenzo Castillo’s 11,000 square foot duplex apartment within a 17th-century neoclassical palace in Madrid (which had also served as convent and warehouse for theatrical costumes) has been featured in numerous design publications over the past few years. I recall the emotional pull of these rooms the moment I peeled a page of the U.S. edition of Elle Decor and discovered them for the first time.\n\nThere is something utterly unique and unaffected about Lorenzo Castillo’s eye for design. He is a maestro at creating collected environments where pedigreed antiques mix with vintage pieces and modern art, and sophisticated color schemes and jazzy geometric patterns are paired with time worn textiles. His rooms feel at once classical and up to date, old world and glamorous. They are clever and innovative yet never appear artificial or contrived. They possess the soul of the Mediterranean. They are rooms to discover and rediscover. And it appears that one would be wise to come back often because from one moment to the next Castillo moves a chair from here to there, or sells a piece or two. Palacio de Castillo is, after all, his design laboratory, home and showroom gallery.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the tour and are as captivated by chez Castillo as I have been, and remain."
