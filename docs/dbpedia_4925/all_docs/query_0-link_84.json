        "text": "A Las Cruces jury on Friday convicted five of seven alleged Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico prison gang members on federal racketeering charges involving violent crimes, including two brothers with lengthy rap sheets who until now had eluded prosecution in the gruesome death of a Los Lunas man in 2012.\n\nDefendants Joe Lawrence Gallegos, his younger brother Andrew \"Smiley\" Gallegos, Billy Garcia, Edward Troup and Arturo Garcia were found guilty of committing murder as part of the SNM criminal enterprise.\n\nThe five defendants will remain in federal custody awaiting sentencing. They each face life imprisonment on the murder convictions.\n\nThe jury acquitted defendants Allen Patterson and Christopher Chavez, who were accused of participating in the strangulation death of inmate Rolando Garza in 2001.\n\nDuring the seven-week racketeering trial, prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office had to prove that each defendant violated federal law by committing violent crimes to gain entrance into or maintaining or increasing their status within the SNM gang, which formed after the deadly 1980 prison riot at the state prison in Santa Fe.\n\nThe prosecution also presented evidence involving four murders, three inside the prison system, that had remained unsolved for years despite investigations by the New Mexico State Police.\n\nDefense attorneys contended there wasn't enough evidence for anyone to be prosecuted for the crimes.\n\nIn the case of the Gallegos brothers, they were originally charged weeks after the fatal shooting of Adrian Burns, whose body was found handcuffed and on fire in November 2012.\n\nBut a Socorro magistrate found insufficient evidence, and charges were dropped. State prosecutors at the time vowed to continue the investigation, but the state case went cold.\n\nIn Friday's verdict:\n\nJoe Lawrence Gallegos was convicted in Burns' death and in a 2001 murder of inmate Frank Castillo at the Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility outside Las Cruces. The jury acquitted him, however, of four counts involving witness tampering, assaulting a man with a dangerous weapon in 2015 and conspiring to murder the same man nearly a year later. Prosecutors contended the man was attacked with a machete in 2016 to keep him from testifying against Joe Gallegos. Both Gallegos brothers have more than a dozen prior arrests each.\n\nHis brother, Andrew \"Smiley\" Gallegos, was also convicted of Burns' murder.\n\nBilly Garcia, a purported SNM leader, was convicted for ordering the murder of inmates Rolando Garza and Castillo, who were strangled to death at the same time in separate areas of the southern New Mexico prison in 2001. Billy Garcia had been released from prison and was on the streets of Albuquerque when arrested in 2015 on federal racketeering charges related to the 14-year-old prison murders.\n\nTroup was convicted in Castillo's 2001 murder and in the 2007 murder of Fred Sanchez at the southern New Mexico prison. Troup had been out of prison when he was arrested on the federal charges in Albuquerque in 2015.\n\nArturo Garcia was also convicted in the 2007 murder of Fred Sanchez.\n\nDuring the trial, federal prosecutors relied mostly on the testimony of SNM members, some who had pleaded guilty and became cooperators for the government.\n\nMore than 80 people have pleaded guilty since the FBI launched its investigation, dubbed \"Operation Atonement,\" in March 2015. That's when evidence surfaced that SNM's leader, Anthony Ray Baca, had ordered the murder of then-state Corrections Secretary Gregg Marcantel and another top Corrections official.\n\nThe tip prompted a massive FBI-led historical investigation into crimes committed by SNM, inside and outside prison walls, over the past three decades. The Marcantel murder plot was foiled, and more than 100 people with SNM ties, either as members or associates, were arrested.\n\nBaca was among three SNM members convicted at the first trial in the case in March.\n\nMore: 3 Syndicato Nuevo Mexico members found guilty of murder, conspiracy; 1 acquitted"
