        "text": "Monet Stewart Tejada is a major character in the Power Universe, serving as a deuteragonist in Power Book II: Ghost. The wife of Lorenzo Tejada, Monet runs the Tejada drug organization with their children Cane, Dru, and Diana, while having a secret son, star athlete Zeke Cross, who she kept out of the drug game. She is played by Mary J. Blige.\n\nThe matriarch of the family, Monet runs the family business in Lorenzo's absence, keeping a tight leash on their children who she raised in the drug game, to the dismay of Dru and Diana, who never wanted to be part of it, but not to Cane, Monet's obedient and trigger-happy soldier, who fights for her attention with Tariq St. Patrick, the family's new business partner he resents for becoming the man Monet relies on. Her leash on Dru and Diana starts to break as her control causes them to rebel for their own autonomy, ultimately leading them to set up her death as the unrest between them comes to a breaking point when she causes the death of their loved ones, including their father for unintentionally killing Zeke, and when she forcibly keeps them in the game by having them work for queenpin Noma Asaju under the penalty of death. Monet's discovery of their attempt to kill her shatters the family as she decides to enact vengeance by ordering Cane to kill them, but a moment of clarity stops her when her cousin Janet makes her realize her faults towards her children. Having realized the importance of family, with a grandchild on the way, Monet is on a mission to bring them back together and out of the game, even as Cane turns his back on the family and becomes Noma's right-hand.\n\nDescription[]\n\nOfficial character description from\n\nPower Book II: Ghost[]\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nThe beginning of Season 3 finds Monet Tejada grieving the loss of her firstborn son, Zeke, and with him the loss of her family’s future outside the business. Monet tasks Davis with helping her find Zeke’s murderer, as her own criminal connections come into focus. Ultimately, Monet must decide between her family's wellbeing and her own penchant for vengeance—or find a way to have both.\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nAt the end of Season Three, Monet Tejada is unknowingly betrayed by her youngest children: Dru and Diana. Consequently, she’s riddled with bullets and her fate is left unknown. As we enter Season Four, Monet continues to fight for her life while everyone else engages in a war. While conscious and unconscious, we’ll witness Monet’s internal battle with her past, via flashbacks. This will provide an insight into a side of Monet we’ve never seen: her origin story. Faced with the reality of how her own actions have created the circumstances they are in today, Monet must decide once and for all whether it’s worth more to fight for the family business or for the family itself.\n\nBiography[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nMonet Stewart Tejada is a mother who is taking care of her three kids, and her nephew. Monet is the current runner of the Tejada Organization while her husband Lorenzo Tejada is inside for 25 Years. She is also trying to teach her kids how to run in the drug game especially her daughter Diana Tejada. She needs protection in the streets so she had an inside dirty NYPD cop named Officer Danilo Ramirez. Her eldest son Cane Tejada becomes a problem after she connects with Tariq St. Patrick. He becomes insanely jealous of his intelligence. Monet at first does not have any trust into Tariq, but overtime, she sees how loyal he is to her and the Tejada's. Though because of her own teachings on Cane, leaves her no choice but to kick him out.\n\nSeason 2\n\nMonet Tejada, formerly Monet Stewart, is the Matriarch of the Tejada family. For the last 10 years or so, she has been maintaining the family and keeping the business alive while her husband, Lorenzo Tejada, has been locked up.\n\nSeason 3\n\nMonet Tejada, set ablaze by the death of her son Zeke Cross, is willing to pay a hefty price to avenge her firstborn and keep the rest of her children and the business in line as she works closely with Davis MacLean to solve Zeke’s

to kill Lorenzo by slitting his throat hiding it from the Tejada siblings.\n\nKai: Lured him into the club to kill him, finessed the Russians to a truce, believing Kai was behind the murder of Pavel and having Dru believe Kai and Gordo was behind Lorenzo's murder to be shot in the head and killed by Cane and decapitated to satisfy a truce with The Russians.\n\nGordo Castillo: Used her burner

Nae-Nae, as Mecca once called her.\n\nShe had a relationship with Mecca in 1997.[citation needed]\n\nAs seen in the flashback of a young Monet and Lorenzo, Lorenzo was the head of the family and was the one that chose the life for them, but Monet is the one who kept the organization running, mixing her kids with the business, something that Lorenzo was against.\n\nMonet raised her kids: Cane, Dru and Diana in the game and put them in specific roles for the organization.\n\nIn season 3, she served as one of the deuteragonists towards Tariq as she could trust him and is allies, however Monet also serves as an antagonist towards her family due to her treacherous ways.\n\nEven after Lorenzo confesses to accidently killing Zeke mistaking he was Mecca, Monet still insist on him dying proves how ruthless and merciless she is disregarding how her children feel about the decision.\n\nMonet can be seen as a bit of a hypocrite, as in Season 1 she criticized Cane for killing Ramirez as it was the wrong choice to kill him in a hot-headed manner, however she then made the same choice when killing The Contractor and I.G. without having proof of their actions.\n\nInstead of having the business work for the Family, Monet had the Family working for the business, this is reason why The Tejada Family is crumbling. As everyone in the family blames Monet but every member of The Tejada's plays a part in the downfall.\n\nMonet never told Zeke the truth about Carrie and continued lying to him to protect herself, therefore Zeke disowning her.\n\nMonet's Manipulative ways towards kids mirrors of Raquel Thomas, Mother of Kanan Stark on Power Book: lll Raising Kanan, when she never told Kanan the truth about anything only if it served her purpose.\n\nSeason 4 of Power Book II: Ghost revealed that Monet was the one who used and brought her kids into the game (since they were toddlers) which Lorenzo was against.\n\nThis is the apparent way Monet has continued to mistreat her children afterwards is the main reason why Dru dislikes her and Diana believes they can be better than her.\n\nIn the Episode 9 Season 1 \"Monster\" Tariq describes in class, the explanation of Frankenstein's monster of how he is viewed by others, and how Frankenstein was treated by the creator is why he acts and does the things he do. As with the classroom segments, it sets the theme for the episode, which centers Tariq struggling with being viewed as a monster. The theme is also applied to how Monet treats Cane is the monster she created, and references How Cane is treated by Monet compared to Diana and Dru, her children she views as good.\n\nThis also explains how Dru and Diana gravitate towards Lorenzo, especially as they wanted a normal life.\n\nThe Tejadas, The Thomass, The St. Patricks and The Flynns are possibly all parallels of each other that reflects the cause and effects of the rise and fall of being in the game.\n\nMonet and Lorenzo are the reasons Cane and Dru are at odds with each other since the beginning since Season 1 with Lorenzo making Dru the apparent Leader of the Tejada Family Organization and Cane playing his part still as Enforcer. Making Cane jealous of Dru while each Parent choosing someone else than Cane, while after Monet bringing in Tariq during.\n\nTariq compared the Tejadas to chess pieces, and referred to Monet as the Queen.[1]\n\nMonet setting up Lorenzo's death is foreshadowed in Ghost's title sequence, which depicts a Queen chess piece standing over a fallen King.\n\nMonet's children call her by her birth name behind her back, which Courtney Kemp confirmed is because of her treating them like employees, and thus they talk about her as if she is their boss. To her face, however, they call her \"Ma\".[2]\n\nCourtney Kemp stated this is inspired by her and her late brother's habit of referring to their parents by their birth name behind their backs.[2]\n\nCourtney Kemp stated that Monet treats Cane differently than Dru and Diana because she views Dru and Diana as her good children: \"good to me, good to Cane, good to each other,\" with Cane being the opposite.[2]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason 1 (Power Book II: Ghost)[]\n\nThe Stranger\n\nExceeding Expectations\n\nPlay the Game\n\nThe Prince\n\nThe Gift of the Magi\n\nGood vs Evil\n\nSex Week\n\nFamily First\n\nMonster\n\nHeart of Darkness\n\nSeason 2 (Power Book II: Ghost[]\n\nPower Book II: Ghost, Season 1 #01 \"The Stranger\" #05 \"The Gift of the Magi\" #09 \"Monster\" #02 \"Exceeding Expectations\" #06 \"Good vs Evil\" #10 \"Heart of Darkness\" #03 \"Play the Game\" #07 \"Sex Week\" #04 \"The Prince\" #08 \"Family First\"\n\nSeason 3 (Power Book II: Ghost)"
