        "text": "Louis del Castillo was born 9 June 1824 in Florida (probably), the son of Francisco del Castillo (born about 1802) and Anna Marie (Mariana) Croix Michelet (1800- ).\n\nFor many years, the family tradition was that his father was Henry del Castillo, but considering his mother was married to and divorced a Francisco del Castillo, I am totally convinced the family tradition was wrong. It also had his mother as Dionisia Michelet, which was also wrong – she was his grandmother, Anna Marie’s mother. See Anna Marie’s page for more info.\n\nThe family tradition is also that there were other children born to Anna Marie and Francisco, but I haven’t found any solid proof. In fact, I’ve had a hard time finding much solid documentation on Louis at all. I can’t prove his parentage, and while I can prove his mother lived in Mexico after she remarried, I can’t tell you where Louis was all that time until his marriage. But I do believe he had at least one brother. [1]\n\nLouis’ siblings may have included:\n\nCarlos del Castillo (abt. 1828- )\n\nHis half-siblings definitely included:\n\nMargarita Parodi (1835- )\n\nTito Parodi (1839- )\n\nAna Maria Antonia Enriquetta Parodi (1842- )\n\nI cannot find any documentation on Louis before 1858, so I do not know where he was between 1824 and 1858.\n\nBut he was in Pensacola on September 13, 1858, where he married Inez Agnes Bonifay [V.B.3], daughter of Felix Manuel Bonifay (1806-1881) and Maria del Rosario Nona Palmes (1800-1858). They were married at St. Michael’s in Pensacola. Father P. F. Coyle performed the ceremony.\n\nLouis and Agnes’s children were:\n\nMary Ann del Castillo (1859–1947) [V.B.3.a.] m. William J. Hall (1855–1900)\n\nLouis Hargis del Castillo (1861–1892) [V.B.3.b]\n\nFrancis Gregory del Castillo (1863–1929) [V.B.3.c] m. 1. Jinette, 2. Brooks [2]\n\nCora Lee del Castillo (1866–1917) [V.B.3.d] m. Walter Bicker\n\nThe 1860 census shows Louis del Castillo (spelled de Castilla), age 36, occupation clerk, living with wife Agnes, age 25, and their daughter, Mary Ann del Castillo (age 1) in the household of Felix Bonifay (Agnes’s father), a carpenter, age 53. Also living there are Agnes’s siblings Francis (27), Felix (22), Eugene (19), and Henry (17), as well as Dionisia Michelet (85; this is Louis’s maternal grandmother whose maiden name was de la Cruz).\n\nThat’s it. That’s all the documentation I’ve been able to find on Louis del Castillo, the marriage certificate and the 1860 census.\n\nAround 1863, the family might have gone to Alabama for a little while because son Francis was recorded as being born in Pollard, Alabama. [3] Haven’t found any indication how long they were there for or why they were there. It would have been after 1861 when Louis was born in FL and they were back by 1866 for Cora Lee’s birth in FL.\n\nLouis died on 20 December 1866 and is buried in St. Michael’s Cemetery in Pensacola with his wife Agnes Bonifay, son Louis Hargis, and daughter Cora Lee. FindAGrave memorial here.\n\n***\n\n[1] See his mother Anna Maria Croix Michelet‘s page for how I arrived at this theory. See The del Castillo Puzzle page for current theories/documentation on this Francisco fellow who was Louis’ father and how he might fit in with what documentation we have and various researcher’s theories.\n\n[2] Francis’ death certificate says b. 17 Nov 1862 and died 31 Oct 1929. FindAGrave says b. 17 Nov 1863 because that’s what his tombstone says. He married Mattie Jinette in New Orleans in 1889. Some family records have a second marriage to Daisy Brooks but I think this is an error/confusion. Mattie Jinette’s maiden name was Brooks, I think. She died in 1915 when their daughter Lillian Gladys was 11. So there was no time for him to marry a second woman who also died in 1915. Lillian Gladys may have been fostered or adopted and raised by a couple named Hahn after this but I don’t know exactly for sure yet.\n\n[3] The 1929 death record of son Francis Gregory gives the following info:\n\nDOB: Nov. 17, 1862 in Pallard, Alabama (this is Pollard misspelled)\n\nFather: Louis Del Castillo, birthplace, don’t know\n\nMother: Agnes Bonifay, born Florida\n\nInformant: Mrs. C.E. Lloyd, 216 W. Romana (this is Minnie Hall, Mae’s sister, m. Cecil Lloyd, so Francis Gregory is also her uncle)\n\nDeath: Oct 31, 1929 in Pensacola\n\n67, widower\n\nattended by physician from July 15 ’til Oct 31 when he died of chronic cardiac valvular disease, chronic nephritis, onset several years ago\n\nThe 1870 census also lists him as being born in AL. See Agnes Bonifay‘s page for details. Also 1880 census on her page.\n\nFrancis Gregory Del Castillo’s funeral announcement from the Pensacola Journal on 2 Nov 1929 mentions some relatives. Francis Gregory as son of Louis del Castillo and Agnes Bonifay is Grandma Hall’s brother, so Mae’s maternal uncle. Obit mentions daughter Lillian who m. a Mr. Michaels, residing 1101 West Gregory Street. So Lillian is Mae’s first cousin then. (Lillian’s mother is Mattie Jinette who died when Lillian was 11.)\n\nPallbearers:\n\nThomas A. Johnson, Sr. (not sure how connected)\n\nW.R. Bicker (F.G.’s sister Cora Lee m. Walter Randall Bicker, so he’s Francis Gregory’s brother-in-law)\n\nHenry Bonifay and Frank Bonifay (I think these are sons of Eugene Cross Bonifay 1841-1910, brother of Inez Agnes Bonifay, so Francis Gregory’s first cousins by his maternal uncle Eugene, who married Mary Louise Cooper. So Henry Bonifay is 1868-1945 and Frank Bonifay (m. Anita Roche then Isabella Roche) is 1869-1949.\n\nMust be Harry Howland, 1868-1936, son of Harry Howland (1835-?) and Margaret Gonzalez (1835-?). This is Margaret Gonzalez’ second husband after her first husband William Joseph Hall (1835-1868) died. She and William J Hall were parents of William Joseph Hall (1855-1900) who married Mary Ann del Castillo, aka Grandma Hall. Grandma Hall and the second Wm Joseph Hall (can we call him Grandpa Hall?) are thus Mae’s parents. So Margaret Gonzalez and second husband Howland had a son Harry Howland who would be Mae’s paternal (half) uncle.\n\nFrancis Comyns (related but I haven’t sorted how yet)\n\nHarold Hall (1895-1969) – this is Mae’s brother, so Francis Gregory is his maternal uncle.\n\nFred Tally – I have never heard of a Fred Tally ever. This is possibly a misprint for Frank Tally, Mae’s husband (1889-1968).\n\nJohn English (absolutely no idea)\n\nGeorge Hall (no idea)\n\nJoe Angelo (no idea)\n\nWillie Johnson (no idea)\n\n[*] possible leads:\n\ncheck 1900, 1910 censuses for Francis Gregory, probably as Franco Castella in 1900. He married Martha Jinette (1862-1915). Maybe leads buried in columns in there somehow/somewhere\n\nlook in Florida naturalization records for Ana Maria Morales Del Castillo?? somebody has this name in Ancestry, but I think this is someone different born in 1926\n\n1910 Pensacola Francis D’Castello, b. 1846 AL, wife Mattie AL, daugh Lillian b. FL. House #49, Precinct 13, married 18 years. also 1900, ?? did i type this wrong or is this somebody else? “” prec 15, Franco Castella, carpenter, b. Nov 1862 AL, parents from FL. wife Mattie b. GA, parents from GA. house # 15 Seville St? next to Welch’s Alley. Romana on same page so close. mother had 2 children, both lving, but none at the home when the census was taken.\n\n1860 census spelling De Castilla. Try also Castillo, Castella"
