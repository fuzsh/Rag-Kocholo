        "text": "Exclusive: Gerardo Celasco (Next) has been cast as a lead opposite Billy Campbell and Angel Parker in National Parks, ABC’s drama pilot co-written and executive produced by Yellowstone star Kevin Costner. The project hails from Costner’s Territory Pictures Entertainment, 20th Television and A+E Studios.\n\nCo-written by Costner, Aaron Helbing and Jon Baird and to be directed by Anthony Hemingway, National Parks follows a small group of elite national parks service agents as they solve crimes while protecting the parks — which, while being known for their sweeping, beautiful landscapes, also attract a vast array of criminal activity.\n\nCelasco will play Lincoln Kane, a fearless Isb Special Agent who is haunted by his past and carries the world on his shoulders. Lincoln’s commitment is never in question as he finds his own way to go above and beyond the call.\n\nCostner, Helbing, Baird and Hemingway executive produce alongside Rod Lake,...\n\nSpoiler Alert: The report includes details about the Season 3 finale of How to Get Away with Murder.\n\nTonight’s series finale of ABC’s How to Get Away with Murder was filled with twists and turns, but fans finally got answers to some pressing questions — most important, whether Annalise will be absolved of her crimes.\n\nHere’s what went down.\n\nThe season finale, titled “Stay,” opens with a shooting at the courthouse, and chaos breaks out. We get more context on that later.\n\nThe show rewinds to three days earlier, where Annalise (Viola Davis) is panicking after learning of the death of Hannah. Frank (Charlie Weber) is thought to be the perpetrator as he just learned some very shocking news about his parents — he was born out of an incestuous relationship between Hannah and her late brother/Annalise’s ex-husband Sam. It’s later implied that Governor Birkhead (Laura Innes) was behind her killing.\n\nHow to Get Away with Murder finally revealed who killed Asher (Matt McGorry), and as always, it feels like we now have more questions than ever. The one at the top of our list, however, is, \"Do all roads really lead back to Xavier Castillo (Gerardo Celasco)? And if so, why?\n\nThursday's episode finally\n\n...\n\nRead More >\n\nOther Links From TVGuide.com How to Get Away with MurderViola DavisMatt McGorry...\n\nNeed to catch up?

Read our previous How to Get Away With Murder recap here.\n\nBefore How to Get Away With Murder’s final season got underway, I made a prediction that Tegan, Nate and Bonnie would all meet their makers — in that order! — before the series finale aired. And based on the events of Thursday’s episode, those deaths suddenly seem more plausible than ever.\n\nMore from TVLineHTGAWM Recap: 'Ello, Gov'norHow to Get Away With Murder Final Season Twist: Original Cast Member Quietly Exits as Series RegularA Million Little Things Kills [Spoiler]: Is This the Death We've Been Fearing?...\n\nNeed to catch up? Read our previous How to Get Away With Murder recap here.\n\nThursday’s episode of How to Get Away With Murder is titled “I’m the Murderer” — but if you thought that meant we’d get clarity on whatever’s happening in those ominous flash-forwards, you would be mistaken. If anything, the horror that will unfold at Middleton in a few months just got more confusing, now that someone in Annalise’s circle has (potentially) confessed to being a killer.\n\nMore from TVLineHTGAWM Recap: Gone Girl — Plus, Should We Be Worried About Asher?How to Get...\n\nFrank really does have nine lives.\n\nThe man was beaten, tortured, and left for dead on How to Get Away with Murder Season 6 Episode 5, and he still managed to try and flip Bonnie against Annalise.\n\nIt truly is amazing how much this group doesn't trust one another.\n\nDistrust was running rampant amongst everyone, with Connor and Oliver struggling, and Michaela second-guessing her father.\n\nPlus, there's the whole implication that Annalise had something to do with Laurel's disappearance.\n\nAs ominous as the ending of How To Get Away With Murder Season 6 Episode 4 was, it never felt like Frank was going to die. It just didn't fit with the tone of the episode to have Frank die in this fashion.\n\nRelated: How To Get Away With Murder Season 6 Episode 2 Review - Vivian's Here\n\nAll the major deaths, for the most part, have been built up.

And How to Get Away with Murder Season 5 Episode 15 had it all.\n\nSo as we come down from the high of those final few minutes, as far as finales go, how does this one measure up?\n\nIt was a very busy hour.\n\nThere were multiple plot points dangling out there, with the most pressing being, who the hell is Xavier Castillo and what does he want?\n\nIt turns out, much like everyone else in his family, he's crazy. And not only is he crazy, but he's also trying to be his father in every possible way. Even down to the fancy suits.\n\nThe Castillo's vendetta against Annalise has now officially gone to epic proportions. They arranged...\n\nThe season finale of ABC’s How To Get Away With Murder had a central question swirling among fans: would anyone die?\n\nThe answer arrived late in the episode, titled Please Say No One Else Is Dead, closing out season five of the series with enough twists, surprises and cliffhangers to indicate it’s highly likely there will be a season six, even though no official word on a renewal has been given.\n\n*** Spoiler Alert: If you have not seen the finale of season five, don’t read beyond this point. ***\n\nTo get right to the central question, it appears that Caplan & Gold managing partner Emmett Crawford (Timothy Hutton) is the episode’s designated victim of foul play. Crawford is about to have a drink with Tegan (Amirah Vann), who already suspects him in the death of Nate Sr. and is pretending to be interested in him in order to get to the truth."
