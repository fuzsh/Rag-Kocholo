This was the first example of a Norman family assuming a Gaelic name.[2]\n\nThis surname has been mainly borne by a notable Irish family who claimed descent from Jocelyn de Angulo, an Anglo-Norman mercenary who accompanied Richard de Clare to Ireland in 1170 during the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland.\n\nAn early record of the name in Ireland appears in the 17th century Annals of the Four Masters where the name is mentioned in the entry for the year in 1193: Inis Clothrann do orgain la macaibh Oisdealb, & la macaibh Conchobhair Maonmaighe. (Inishcloghbran was plundered by the sons of Oisdealb, and the sons of Conor Moinmoy.)[3] The descendants of Oisdealb then became referred to by the family name Mac Oisdealbhaigh (son of Oisdealb).\n\nCostello has also occasionally has been adopted as a pseudonym or stage name by famous people largely of Italian descent, including Al Costello (né Giacomo Costa), Frank Costello (né Francesco Castiglia) and Lou Costello (né Louis Francis Cristillo).\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nAl Costello (1919–2000), the ring name of Italian-Australian professional wrestler Giacomo Costa\n\nAnthony Costello (born 1953), British paediatrician and professor\n\nAnthony J.
