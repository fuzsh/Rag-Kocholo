Trivia[]

Frank Castillo is implied to be attracted to Diana. When he arrives at the Tejada residence, he eyes Diana and remarks on how having grown up her body is "filled out" after he had not seen the Tejadas for years. A suspicious Monet later tells Diana to take advantage of this to get him to reveal how he had gotten out of prison early.[1]

Frank is confirmed to be a snitch when Danilo Ramirez shows the confidential informant agreement paperwork Frank signed to Monet.[1]
