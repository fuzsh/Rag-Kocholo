President Bashar AL-ASAD has made little progress on the economic front after one year in office, but does appear willing to permit a gradual strengthening of the private sector. His most obvious accomplishment to this end was the recent passage of legislation allowing private banks to operate in Syria, although a private banking sector will take years and further government cooperation to develop. ASAD's recent cabinet reshuffle may improve his chances of implementing further growth-oriented policies, although external factors such as the international war on terrorism, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and downturn in oil prices could weaken the foreign investment and government revenues Syria needs to flourish. A long-run economic constraint is the pressure on water supplies caused by rapid population growth, industrial expansion, and increased water pollution\n\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $54.2 billion (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate: 2% (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $3,200 (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - composition by sector:\n\nagriculture: 27%\n\nindustry: 23%\n\nservices: 50% (2000 est.)\n\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 0.3% (2001 est.)\n\nLabor force:\n\ntotal: 4.7 million (1998 est.)\n\nby occupation: services 40%, agriculture 40%, industry 20% (1996 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 20% (2000 est.)\n\nBudget:\n\nrevenues: $5 billion\n\nexpenditures : $7 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA (2001 est.)\n\nIndustries: petroleum, textiles, food processing, beverages, tobacco, phosphate rock mining\n\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.3% (1994)\n\nElectricity - capacity: 4.16 million kW (1994)\n\nElectricity - production:19.7 billion kWh (2000)\n\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 17.671 billion kWh (2000)\n\nAgriculture - products: wheat, barley, cotton, lentils, chickpeas; beef, lamb, eggs, poultry, milk\n\nExports:\n\ntotal value: $5 billion (f.o.b., 2001 est.)\n\ncommodities:crude oil 68%, textiles 7%, fruits and vegetables 6%, raw cotton 4% (1998 est.)\n\npartners: Germany 27%, Italy 12%, France 10%, Turkey 10%, Saudi Arabia 7% (2000 est.)\n\nImports:\n\ntotal value : $4 billion (f.o.b., 2001 est.)\n\ncommodities: machinery and transport equipment 21%, food and livestock 18%, metal and metal products 15%, chemicals and chemical products 10% (2000 est)\n\npartners: Italy 9%, Germany 7%, France 5%, Lebanon 5%, China 4%, South Korea 4%, Turkey 4%, US 4% (2000 est.)\n\nDebt - external: $22 billion (2001 est.)\n\nEconomic aid:\n\nrecipient: $199 million (1997 est.)\n\nCurrency: 1 Syrian pound (SYP) = 100 piastres\n\nExchange rates: Syrian pounds per US dollar - 51 (December 2001), 46 (2000), 46 (1998), 41.9 (January 1997)\n\nFiscal year: calendar year\n\nCommunications\n\nTelephones: 1.313 million (1997)\n\nTelephone system: fair system currently undergoing significant improvement and digital upgrades, including fiber-optic technology\n\ndomestic: coaxial cable and microwave radio relay network\n\ninternational: satellite earth stations - 1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) and 1 Intersputnik (Atlantic Ocean region); 1 submarine cable; coaxial cable and microwave radio relay to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey; participant in Medarabtel\n\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 14, FM 2, shortwave 1 (1998)\n\nRadios: 4.15 million (1997)\n\nTelevision broadcast stations: 44 (plus 17 repeaters) (1995)\n\nTelevisions: 1.05 million (1997)\n\nTransportation\n\nRailways:\n\ntotal :2,750 km\n\nbroad gauge: 2,423 km 1.435-m gauge\n\nnarrow gauge: 327 km 1.050-m gauge\n\nHighways:\n\ntotal: 41,451 km\n\npaved : 9,575 km (including 877 km of expressways)\n\nunpaved:31,876 km (1997)\n\nWaterways: 870 km; minimal economic importance\n\nPipelines: crude oil 1,304 km; petroleum products 515 km\n\nPorts and harbors: Baniyas, Jablah, Latakia, Tartus\n\nMerchant marine:\n\ntotal: 143 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 482,985 GRT/702,590 DWT\n\nships by type: bulk 12, cargo 126, livestock carrier 4, roll on/roll off 1\n\nAirports: 99 (2001)\n\nAirports - with paved runways:\n\ntotal: 24\n\nover 3,047 m: 5\n\n2,438 to 3,047 m : 16\n\n914 to 1,523 m:2\n\nunder 914 m: 1 (2001)\n\nAirports - with unpaved runways:\n\ntotal:75\n\n1,524 to 2,437 m : 2\n\n914 to 1,523 m:11\n\nunder 914 m: 62 (2001)\n\nHeliports: 2 (2001)\n\nMilitary\n\nMilitary branches: Syrian Arab Army, Syrian Arab Navy, Syrian Arab Air Force, Syrian Arab Air Defense Forces, Police and Security Force\n\nMilitary manpower - military age: 19 years of age (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary manpower - availability:\n\nmales age 15-49: 4,550,496 (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary manpower - fit for military service:\n\nmales : 2,539,342 (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary manpower - reaching military age annually:\n\nmales: 200,859 (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary expenditures - dollar figure: $$921 million (FY00 est.); note - based on official budget data that may understate actual spending\n\nMilitary expenditures - percent of GDP: 5.9% (FY98)\n\nTransnational Issues\n\nDisputes - international: Golan Heights is Israeli occupied; Hatay question with Turkey; dispute with upstream riparian Turkey over Turkish water development plans for the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers; Syrian troops in northern, central, and eastern Lebanon since October 1976"
