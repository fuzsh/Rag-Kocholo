This hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee is called to order. Today we are delighted to welcome Ambassador William Burns, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, and Ambassador Cofer Black, the Counterterrorism Coordinator, for a timely review of United States foreign policy towards Syria. We also welcome our distinguished second panel: Dr. Patrick Clawson of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy; Ambassador Richard Murphy of the Council on Foreign Relations; Dr. Murhaf Jouejati of the Middle East Institute; and Dr. Flynt Leverett of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. Hopes that reform could take root in Syria after the fall of Saddam Hussein have dimmed in the past few months. Instead, tensions have increased between the United States and Syria, and a cycle of retaliation and revenge has overtaken and derailed possible progress in the Road Map to Peace for the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Israeli retaliatory attack on an Islamic Jihad terrorist camp in Syria underscored that the ``no war and no peace'' status quo in the region cannot be taken for granted. Many experts thought that when President Bashar Al-Asad replaced his father 3 years ago he would adopt a more pragmatic approach to negotiations with Israel and to internal political and economic reforms. Syrian cooperation with the United States in relation to al-Qaeda terrorists held promise for cooperation in other areas. Secretary Burns noted last June in his testimony that ``the cooperation the Syrians have provided in their own self-interest on al-Qaeda has saved American lives.'' But Syria's failure to stop terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, from using Syria as a base for training and planning suicide bombings in Israel has continued. Syria also has failed to withdraw its forces from Lebanon or open a dialogue for peace. It reportedly has continued to maintain stockpiles of chemical weapons and to pursue development of lethal biological agents. Moreover, Syria is working against coalition forces in Iraq by refusing to release nearly $3 billion in assets stolen from the Iraqi people. The Senate's discussions of the Syria Accountability Act have been based on the presumption that the most effective response to Syrian behavior is expanding sanctions against that country. This is a natural conclusion, but Syria's presence on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism already brings with it a number of sanctions and restrictions. More importantly, as we give the administration additional sticks to use against Syria, we should be careful about restricting our government's flexibility in responding to diplomatic opportunities that might present themselves. Syria has shown some ability to make better choices: for example, supporting UN Security Council Resolution 1441 following Secretary Powell's presentation in February and voting for the more recent Resolution 1511, which calls upon all nations to support the U.S.-led effort in Iraq. Even as we tighten restrictions on Syria, we should be emphasizing to the Syrians why it is in their best interest to recalculate their approach toward the United States. Syria shares a 400-mile border with Iraq. With more than 135,000 United States troops deployed in Iraq, Syria needs to reconsider where its future security interests lie. This is not a threat of U.S. military action, but a statement of the new reality on Syria's borders. Moreover, Syrian forces that continue to occupy Lebanon are draining the already stagnant Syrian economy while providing few positive returns. Continued Syrian occupation of Lebanon only invites further possible military action from Israel. The Syrian leadership also must adjust to the end of its under-the-counter oil deals with Saddam Hussein. Syria must negotiate new and transparent arrangements to meet energy needs. Syria's moribund economy will not survive without opening up to investment and trade, particularly with Iraq. Significant benefits to Syria could accrue from an economically vibrant Iraqi trading partner, increased trade with Europe and the United States and even possible membership in a Middle East Free Trade Agreement. In this context, Syria may find motivation to return to the negotiating table. A deal on the Golan Heights that would provide security guarantees for Israel while respecting Syria's sovereignty could be a key to resolving a host of other problems, including Syria's occupation of Lebanon, its support of Palestinian terror groups, and its economic and political isolation. Although success of such an agreement would depend ultimately on the parties themselves, I would be interested to hear from our witnesses what the United States can and should do to promote a viable settlement. We look forward to our witnesses' recommendations on the other issues and hope that the discussion will lead to help inform our policy towards Syria. I would like to call now upon the distinguished ranking member of our committee, Senator Biden, for his opening statement. STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE Senator Biden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am delighted with our first panel from the State Department. I have very high regard for both gentlemen, as well as our second panel, which I am anxious to hear. I suggest we basically have three options with regard to our policy toward Syria right now. But I think there is a reality that we should all just sort of face up to. That is, I for one think that Syrian conduct relative to its neighbors, to support for terror, to opening up its economy, and every other aspect that we are going to examine about Syria's present government and Syria's present activity, as well as the bilateral relationship with the United States, in my view depends almost wholly upon our success or failure in Iraq. If in fact we are successful and stay the course in securing the peace and a stable government in Iraq, I think it will have a transforming impact upon Syrian conduct. Quite frankly, if we--if any of the scenarios that are discussed that relate to failure, either pulling out prematurely or not being able to secure the peace and a transition to a government viewed as legitimate--that is, essentially a representative republic--then I think it is Katy bar the door. I think we will reap the whirlwind, not, quite frankly, just in Syria, but in the entire region. I think it will be the end of modernity, any notions of it in the Arab world. I think it will temporarily bring to a halt any reasonable prospect of any notions of democratization, and it will end, I think for the foreseeable future, the prospects of nation states in the region cooperating in curtailing terrorist organizations, cabining their capability. It will have the exact opposite effect. I quite frankly think Bashar Asad has two people looking over--two circumstances looking over his shoulder: his father's old cabinet. When I sat with him, and I think we were together, Dick--I cannot recall, to be honest with you now, I have made so many trips lately--in his office for an hour and a half, it was interesting to watch. In our business, after doing this for 3 decades, part of what the plain old politician part of us hopefully brings to the table is we are not all that bad at assessing what the other guy is thinking or what the other guy's motives are or what the other guy needs in the deal. I sat there and I looked at a guy who looked to me very conflicted. On the one hand he was modern enough to understand there had to be significant change in his country. On the other hand, every time he would even squint in that direction there would be a foreign minister or someone else sitting there glaring, literally, at him. I mean that in the literal sense. So that is one. Assuming Asad is attempting to moderate or ameliorate his relationships in the region, he has that one problem. The second problem he has is he is sitting atop a part of the world, in a part of the world, he just has no idea which way it is going to go right now. The honest to God truth is-- and everyone with whom I speak in the world--and I told this bad joke; I might as well tell it again because it sort of is a homely way of explaining it. There used to be a joke about the coach who had a center fielder who in four innings made seven errors. And he pulls George out and he puts in Joe or John. The first play after he puts in John is a routine pop fly to center field and John drops the ball. The coach goes crazy. He calls time out and calls John in, says: What the devil is the matter with you, John? John looks at the coach and says: Coach, George screwed up center field so badly no one can play it. Well, the truth of the matter is the rest of the world is looking right now. It is a bit of humor. Sometimes you need a little bit of humor to leaven how deadly serious this is. But I still think it is fully within our grasp to secure the peace in Iraq, but it is going to require some significant further change in policy to do so in my view. I think the rest of the world is standing around looking now: Do I want to play in center field? I am not at all sure. I am not at all sure friend or foes have reached a conclusion as to what the outcome is going to be. But when they reach that conclusion I think it is going to impact upon and inform their judgments on every other aspect of their relationship with us in the region. So we will talk about the Syria Accountability Act. We will talk about a number of other things here. But I just want to be clear, which I have been earlier with both the State Department personnel here, that I am going to ask their view at some point about how connected they think the possibilities are with regard to Syria and success or failure in Iraq. With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank you and I yield. The Chairman. Well, thank you very much, Senator Biden. Gentlemen, before I ask for your testimony I need to announce that we are going to have a roll call vote in about 3 minutes. So it is the intent of the chair to recess the hearing so that members who are here can vote. Some of our colleagues, we presume, are proceeding to the floor to vote and will be returning. In this way, your testimony will not be conflicted with people coming and going. We will be back because we look forward to hearing from you. Now, let me just say at the outset that your statement and that of our following panel will be placed in the record in full. Be prepared to present as you wish your material in some summary form that would expedite the questions of the committee. We are likely to have another roll call vote, I am advised, at 12:30. So hopefully between these two roll call votes we will have an excellent hearing. If we are not finished at that point, we will continue after that vote so that all members have an opportunity to ask their questions of the witnesses. But for the moment, the hearing is recessed and we will be back very shortly. Senator Biden. Thank you, gentlemen. [Recess from 10:29 a.m. to 10:58 a.m.] The Chairman. The hearing is called to order again. The vote was postponed again and again, as you may have surmised, but is taking place and members will be rejoining us. Ambassador Burns, we welcome you. We appreciate your coming and look forward to your testimony. Would you please proceed. STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM J. BURNS, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUREAU FOR NEAR EASTERN AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF STATE Ambassador Burns. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am delighted to be here this morning and, with your permission, I will submit my prepared statement for the record and offer just a few brief summary comments. The Chairman. It will be published in full. Ambassador Burns. Mr. Chairman, our relations with Syria today are poor. Six months ago, Secretary Powell outlined in clear and candid terms for President Asad serious American concerns about Syrian behavior in a number of areas. The Secretary made equally clear our continuing commitment to comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks. He stressed the new strategic possibilities in the region with the liberation of Iraq and urged Syria to reconsider its own interests and actions in light of those possibilities. Unfortunately, Syria has failed to make the fundamental changes that Secretary Powell emphasized last May. It is true that Syria has taken some positive steps on Iraq in recent weeks. It voted for United Nations Security Council Resolution 1511, it is demonstrating cooperation on the issue of former Iraqi regime assets in Syrian banks, and it has improved control of its border with Iraq. While much more remains to be done, these recent steps are welcome. They are in Syria's interest as much as America's because Syria should have as big a stake as any country in a stable, unified Iraq. In other areas, however, Syria's actions continue to pose profound problems. Nowhere is this clearer than in the case of terrorist groups harbored by Damascus. Groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad continue to operate out of Syria, directing and supporting attacks on innocent civilians in Israel and the occupied territories. Such attacks are reprehensible, deeply destructive of legitimate Palestinian aspirations for statehood, and totally contradictory to Syria's professed commitment to comprehensive peace. Syria simply cannot have it both ways. It cannot claim an interest in a political solution and the resumption of negotiations for the return of the Golan and at the same time shelter terrorists determined to do all they can to prevent such a political solution. And it certainly cannot have it both ways with the United States in the post-September 11th world. It is true that Syria has offered valuable cooperation against al-Qaeda. That is in both our interests and we welcomed it. But that does not outweigh Syria's continued support for other terror groups. In concert with Iran, Syria supports Hizballah, an extremely dangerous terrorist organization with global reach and the ability to threaten coalition forces in Iraq. Beyond its support for terrorism, we continue to have serious concerns about Syria's continued presence in Lebanon and its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Chairman, we take no particular satisfaction in highlighting our continuing troubles with Syria. We ought to be able to work together to revive hope for Arab-Israeli peace, shape the emergence of a stable Iraqi neighbor, fight violent extremists who threaten us all, and create a better economic future for Syria and its people. Dialogue and diplomacy between the United States and Syria have always been difficult and often frustrating. But in years past American administrations have sometimes found solid ground on which to build with Syria. I hope that our efforts at engagement can eventually produce that again in the future. But in the mean time, we face some real problems in Syrian behavior that we cannot afford to ignore. Action on the Syria Accountability Act certainly makes clear the depth of Congressional concern on these issues and the consequences of inaction by Syria. The administration will continue to work hard in our direct contacts with Syria as well as in concert with our friends and allies in the international community and the region to drive home to the Syrian regime the need, in all our interests, for fundamental changes in behavior. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Ambassador Burns follows:] Prepared Statement of William J. Burns Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, for the opportunity to speak about the U.S.-Syria relationship. I think it might be useful to frame today's discussion of our relationship with Syria in the context of the four goals that drive our overall agenda in the Middle East. First, the emergence of an Iraq that is unified, stable, democratic, and prosperous. Second, the achievement of the President's vision of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security. Second, achievement of the President's vision of two states, Israel and Palestine, at peace and secure with each other and the region. Third, the elimination of the threat of terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. And fourth, support for homegrown efforts at economic and political reform as the best means to achieve lasting peace, and prosperity and democracy in the region. It is through this policy prism that we must view Syria's actions and draw conclusions about the course of our relationship. Unfortunately, Syria's record with regard to these four foreign policy priorities is poor. In his visit to Damascus in May, the Secretary of State spoke candidly to Syrian President Bashar Al Asad about our concerns about Syrian behavior and identified the issues that the Syrian regime needed to address in order to develop a positive and productive relationship with the United States. Secretary Powell made clear that the United States remained committed to comprehensive peace in the region, including on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, and remained ready for an improved bilateral relationship. But he also explained that the Syrians needed to establish that they were prepared to play a constructive role in the search for regional peace before we could envision progress on these fronts. I reinforced the Secretary's message in Damascus in August. We have been very direct with the Syrians about our concerns. The issues emphasized in the Syria Accountability Act have been reflected in our ongoing dialogue with Damascus for months now. While we have seen some positive steps with respect to Iraq, we remain deeply concerned on other critical areas--particularly terrorism and WMD. Iraq In the months leading up to Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Administration had two areas of particular concern with respect to Syria's relationship with the regime of Saddam Hussein: illicit oil trade and illicit transshipment of dual-use and military-related items into Iraq. Despite repeated warnings, the Asad regime allowed these actions to continue, even after the beginning of Coalition military action in Iraq. Fortunately for all concerned, decisive U.S. engagement in the early days of the conflict brought an end to these activities. We have been clear: there is no issue of greater importance for the United States than the safety and security of U.S. and Coalition personnel in Iraq. To this end, during his May visit, the Secretary focused on the need for Syria to secure its borders with respect to both high-level figures of the former Iraqi regime who might seek safehaven in Syria, as well as those individuals who might seek to infiltrate Iraq from Syria to bring harm and instability. In addition, the Secretary noted the importance of securing former regime assets held in Syrian banks so that they might be returned to their rightful owners, the Iraqi people. Though Syria has taken steps over the past several months to address these areas of concern, their efforts fall short of what is necessary. On the border, we have witnessed increased vigilance on the part of Syrian security forces. But the porous nature of the Syrian- Iraqi border and cross-border tribal ties mean that Syria continues to be a preferred route for those seeking to undermine Coalition efforts to establish stability and a peaceful transition to democracy in Iraq. On the issue of former Iraqi regime assets, a joint U.S.-Iraqi forensic accounting team recently departed Damascus, where they worked closely with Syrian officials to obtain information related to the disposition of Iraqi assets in Syria. We continue to call on Syria, and nations around the world, to live up to their obligations under UNSCR 1483 and return these funds to the Iraqi people, where they belong. We are pleased with Syria's recent vote in support of UNSCR 1511 and its decision to attend the Iraqi donors conference in Madrid. We hope this represents a new readiness by Syria to fully support the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq. Israel/Palestinians While the Syrian leadership publicly affirms its support for comprehensive peace in the Middle East and its desire to restart negotiations for the return of the Golan Heights, it continues to offer safehaven to Palestinian rejectionist groups whose terrorist actions undermine both progress toward President Bush's two-state vision and the aspirations of the Palestinian people. Damascus claims that the offices of HAMAS, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the PFLP-GC are purely informational in nature. Such claims are simply not credible. Individuals associated with these groups continue to engage in operational activities from their Damascus base. Syria's refusal to seriously address this issue and sever ties with these terrorist organizations delays the day when Syria's own territorial claims can be addressed via negotiations. Syria maintains an unhelpful approach in the UN Security Council, where it has sponsored unbalanced resolutions related to Israel- Palestine conflict and refused to include language condemning terrorism. Terrorism and WMD Syria, in concert with Iran, also provides support--including safe haven and transit for personnel and materiel between Iran and Lebanon-- to Lebanese Hizballah, another terrorist organization whose activities, particularly in South Lebanon, are a destabilizing factor in the region. Hizballah's global reach--and the threat it could pose to our forces in Iraq--makes it an organization of particular concern to the United States and our allies in the global war on terrorism. With respect to Syrian cooperation against Al-Qaeda, this Administration has acknowledged that Syrian cooperation earlier in the war on terrorism was has been valuable and has saved American lives. This cooperation, however, is not sufficient to outweigh Damascus' continued support for other terror groups. On weapons of mass destruction, Under Secretary Bolton noted in Congressional testimony earlier this fall our concern about Syria's nuclear R&D program and the need to watch for any activity or evidence of foreign assistance that could facilitate a Syrian nuclear-weapons capability. We are aware of Syrian efforts to acquire dual-use technologies that could be applied to a nuclear weapons program. Syria is a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has a standard fullscope safeguards agreement with the IAEA, but has not yet signed the IAEA Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement. Syria has signed, but not ratified, the Biological Weapons Convention. Nevertheless, Syria is fully committed to expanding and improving its chemical and biological weapons programs, which it believes serve as a deterrent to regional adversaries. Damascus is pursuing both solid- and liquid-propellant missile programs and relies extensively on foreign assistance in these endeavors. Reform President Asad assumed power over three years ago in an atmosphere of optimism--a so-called ``Damascus Spring.'' The fact that early expectations about the pace and degree of reform the new President would pursue may have been overly ambitious does not diminish the disappointment with the lack of progress to date. Efforts thus far-- including the demilitarization of Syrian public schools by ending military-style school uniforms and mandatory military summer camp, a refocusing of the ruling Ba'ath Party's role in government, and creation of private universities--are mere ``glimmers'' and much remains to be done to address endemic corruption, infringement of fundamental human rights such as freedom of expression and association, and a lackluster commitment to meaningful economic reform. In short, Mr. Chairman, while Syria has decided to work constructively with the United States in some areas, on balance, we remain very concerned that the government in Damascus continues to exert a negative influence on several of the critical foreign-policy priorities I outlined at the beginning of my remarks. In some instances, it seems that Syria harbors the illusion that cosmetic steps will be enough to defuse our concerns. In others, there seems to be a misplaced belief in Damascus that U.S. engagement in Iraq and with the Israelis and Palestinians will prevent us from pursuing a robust agenda with Syria. Both judgments are ill-considered and fail to grasp the depth of our concerns, and those of the international community. Until Syria shows itself committed to comprehensive peace in the region through concrete actions, it will continue to find itself at odds with the United States and increasingly isolated internationally. The Syrian regime has some tough choices to make. It can continue to harbor and support groups devoted to terror, and engage in behavior that calls into question its commitment to regional peace and stability. Or it can act in ways that reflect new strategic realities in the region and help restore hope for a resumption of the Syrian- Israeli track, encourage the emergence of a stable Iraqi neighbor, and create a better economic future for Syria. But it can't have it both ways. The irony we face, Mr. Chairman--if Damascus' public statements are to be believed--is that the U.S. and Syria share a common vision for the region: a peaceful and stable Iraq ruled by Iraqis, and a just and comprehensive peace between Arabs and Israelis. The challenge we face is in charting a course that will persuade Syria to take the necessary actions to contribute to that vision. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Ambassador Burns. Ambassador Black, do you have testimony at this time or have you come in support of Ambassador Burns? Ambassador Black. I come in support. I have a couple of brief introductory remarks if that is acceptable. The Chairman. Fine, I would appreciate that. HON. J. COFER BLACK, COORDINATOR, OFFICE OF THE COORDINATOR FOR COUNTERTERRORISM, DEPARTMENT OF STATE Ambassador Black. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss Syria's role as a state sponsor of terrorism. There is no doubt that many past Syrian actions are in dire conflict with U.S. interests in the region and that the current posture of the Syrian government towards terrorism continues to be wholly unacceptable. As a state sponsor of terrorism, Syria has repeatedly shown an unwillingness to fundamentally change its behavior regarding support for terrorism. While we continue to have hope for eventual improvements in Syrian attitudes, policies, and actions, we see little at this time to indicate that Syrian support for terrorism is diminishing. Syria remains a security concern not just because of terrorism, but also because of their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. Since Under Secretary John Bolton has recently testified on the latter, which is in his area of expertise, I will discuss briefly the former. The threat to our country posed by states who both sponsor terrorism and pursue weapons of mass destruction is one which we cannot and will not ignore. Syria, a sponsor of numerous terrorist organizations, is a country whose actions we must follow carefully in this regard. While there is currently no information indicating that the Syrian government has transferred weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organizations or would permit such groups to acquire them, Syria's ties to numerous terrorist groups underlie the reasons for continued attention. The threat posed by Syria can best be understood by addressing three areas: border security, which is directly related to the security of our forces in Iraq; Syrian government support for Palestinian rejectionist groups; and Syrian support for Lebanese Hizballah. Obviously, many of you share these concerns, which is why the Syria Accountability Act is under consideration in Congress. Regarding Iraq, Syria took a series of hostile actions towards coalition forces in Iraq. Syria allowed military equipment to flow into Iraq on the eve of and during the war. Syria also permitted volunteers to pass into Iraq to attack our servicemembers during the war. In the period following the conclusion of major military action, foreign fighters have continued to transit into Iraq from Syria. While the situation on the Syrian border has improved in recent weeks, it is still a major source of concern for us. We see indications that the Syria-Iraq border is more secure now than it has ever been. To put the issue in proper context, in the past there was not the security need for the Syrian government to secure the border to the extent that they must do so now. That is only one factor in this problem. While it is understandable that the Syrian authorities may have had initial problems in ramping up, what we have found unacceptable was the manner in which the Syrians delayed taking effective action. We are cautiously optimistic that the situation will continue to improve along the border. We also remain concerned about the possibility of anti- coalition activity being organized inside of Syrian territory. As we have said for some time, Syria provides a safe haven and material support for several Palestinian rejectionist groups, including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Abu Mousa Organization, and the Popular Struggle Front. The Syrian government maintains that the offices of these groups are used solely for press purposes and play no leadership or operational role in the conduct of terrorist attacks. We reject this argument, have seen evidence that some of these offices are in fact used clearly for operational purposes. Even if this were not the case, we would continue to insist that the Syrian government close these offices, which maintain vocal public support for these nefarious organizations. Syrian tolerance of Palestinian rejectionist groups' offices in their country shows a lack of commitment to support reasonable efforts towards a comprehensive peace between Israel and Palestine. Syria also continues to provide safe haven and a policy cover to Hizballah in Lebanon, which has killed hundreds of Americans and numerous others in the past. Syrian support for Hizballah continues to be a major impediment towards progress in our counterterrorism efforts. Syria allows resupply of Hizballah from Iran via Damascus. Syria also allows wanted Hizballah terrorists, including Amag Mugniyah, to transit Syria and find safe haven there. The Syrian military presence in Lebanon supports Hizballah actions there. In Syria we see a convergence of hostile rhetoric and a history of support for terrorism. Our bilateral relationship with Syria is a complex one. We share Congress' concerns with respect to Syria and have been engaged in extensive direct dialogue with the highest levels of the Syrian government on a full range of issues, including terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, Lebanon, and Iraq. Unfortunately, these conversations have borne little fruit in changing Syrian actions on support for terrorism. While there may have been areas of cooperation on certain counterterrorism issues between our two governments, this is not sufficient to counter our grave concern about Syria's continued support for group such as Hamas, PFLP-GC, PIJ, Hizballah, and others. It should be noted that what we ask of Syria is not unusual nor is it exceptional. We ask them to join the community of nations which reject terrorism as a political tool. We ask them to cease support for groups whose only goal is to kill and to maim in the pursuit of policies which seek to destroy rather than support peace. We remain optimistic that continued engagement with Syria will one day lead to a change in Syrian behavior, a change that will allow them once again to interact with us on a normal footing. But that change must come from the Syrian government. We will judge them on their actions. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for allowing me to make my opening statement. [The prepared statement of Ambassador Black follows:] Prepared Statement of Ambassador Cofer Black Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss Syria's role as a state sponsor of terrorism.

Iraq Syria took a series of hostile actions toward Coalition forces in Iraq. Syria allowed military equipment to flow into Iraq on the eve of and during the war. Syria also permitted volunteers to pass into Iraq to attack our service members during the war. In the period following the conclusion of major military action, foreign fighters have continued to transit into Iraq from Syria. While the situation on the Syrian border has improved in recent weeks, it is still a major source of concern for us. We see indications that the Syria-Iraq border is more secure now that it has ever been. To put the issue in proper context, in the past there was not the security need for the Syrian government to secure the border to the extent they must now do so. That is only one factor in this problem. While it is understandable that the Syrian authorities may have had initial problems in ramping up, what we found unacceptable was the manner in which the Syrians delayed taking effective action. We are cautiously optimistic that the situation will continue to improve along the border. We also remain concerned about the possibility of anti-coalition activity being organized inside of Syrian territory. I refer you to the intelligence community for its assessment of this issue. Palestinian Terror Groups As we have said for some time, Syria provides safehaven and material support for several Palestinian rejectionist groups, including HAMAS, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command (PFLP-GC) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), the Abu Musa Organization (AMO), and the Popular Struggle Front (PSF). The Syrian government maintains that the offices of these groups are used solely for press purposes and play no leadership or operational role in the conduct of terrorist attacks. We reject this argument and have seen evidence that some of these offices are, in fact, used for operational purposes. Even if this were not the case, we would continue to insist that the Syrian government close these offices which maintain vocal public support for these nefarious organizations. Syrian tolerance of Palestinian rejectionist groups' offices in their country demonstrates a lack of commitment to support reasonable efforts toward a comprehensive peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Lebanese Hizballah Syria continues to provide safe haven and political cover to Hizballah in Lebanon, a group responsible for killing hundreds of Americans and numerous others in the past. Syrian support for Hizballah continues to be a major impediment towards progress in our counterterrorism efforts. Syria allows resupply of Hizballah from Iran via Damascus. Syria also allows wanted Hizballah terrorists, including Imad Mugniyah, to transit Syria and find haven there. The Syrian military presence in Lebanon supports Hizballah actions there. Conclusion In Syria we see a convergence of hostile rhetoric and a history of support for terrorism. Our bilateral relationship with Syria is a complex one. We share Congress' concerns with respect to Syria and have been engaged in extensive, direct dialogue with the highest levels of the Syrian government on a full range of issues--including terrorism, WMD, Lebanon and Iraq. Unfortunately, these conversations have borne little fruit in changing Syrian actions on support for terrorism. While there may have been areas of cooperation on certain counterterrorism issues between our two governments, this is not sufficient to counter our grave concern about Syria's continued support for groups such as HAMAS, PFLP-GC, PIJ, Hizballah, and others. It should be noted that what we ask of Syria is not unusual nor is it exceptional. We ask them to join the community of nations which reject terrorism as a political tool. We ask them to cease support for groups whose only goal is to kill and maim in the pursuit of policies which seek to destroy rather than support peace. I remain optimistic that continued engagement with Syria will one day lead to a change in Syrian behavior--a change that will allow them once again to interact with us on a normal footing. But that change must come from the Syrian government--we will judge them on their actions. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Ambassador Black. The chair would suggest a first round of questioning of maybe 7 minutes for each of us, and we may wish to have another round if members have not asked all the questions that they would like. Let me begin by commenting that I appreciated Senator Biden's opening statement. He will probably amplify that further on his own, but it would appear to me that cooperation with Syria immediately following military activity in Iraq looked more promising than does that activity today. Now, without having any thermometer with which to gauge why people become more interested in cooperating and why they begin to slack off in that, it would appear to be that the Syrian government, including the chief leader, the president of the country, as well as advisers for his father and for himself, may be more tentative in their judgment about our success, that of the United States and the coalition, in Iraq. To what extent in your judgment are they inclined over the course of days or weeks to take more of a wait and see attitude as opposed to taking activities that are more in consonance with the foreign policy objectives that you have stated? I gather, from reading your papers and those of our other witnesses, that most see the Syrians as a pragmatic people, without necessarily oversentimental ties with the Palestinians or with al-Qaeda or with others who are out there. But where do their interests lie and to what extent will our success in Iraq lead them back to a path of more cooperation and then perhaps to some fulfillment pragmatically of their own foreign policy objectives? Do you have a thought on that, Ambassador Burns? Ambassador Burns. Yes, Senator Lugar. I think you are right. I do not think, at least in my experience, sentiment has ever been the driving impulse in Syrian foreign policy. I think there were a number of miscalculations that the Syrian regime made in the period just before Operation Iraqi Freedom and the beginning of military conflict. A lot of activities across the Iraqi border which-- The Chairman. Were there miscalculations perhaps that there would not be military activity, in other words that there would not be an attack on Iraq at all? Ambassador Burns. Either that there would not be an attack or that it would be far more complicated and protracted than turned out to be the case. I think certainly the rapid success of the coalition militarily got the attention of the Syrian regime. I think that was reflected in the nature of the conversation that Secretary Powell had in early May when he visited Damascus. In recent weeks, as I mentioned to you, Mr. Chairman, in several areas connected to Iraq there have been some signs of Syrian actions consistent with our interest in a stable, unified Iraq: the vote in favor of Resolution 1511, cooperation over the last couple of weeks with a team of Iraqi and American experts investigating frozen assets in Syrian banks from the former Iraqi regime. There has been a degree of cooperation that we had not seen before and, as Ambassador Black also mentioned, improved efforts on the part of the Syrians to control their border with Iraq. So in all those areas there are at least some indications of a recognition of the importance of responsible behavior with regard to Iraq and of Syria's interest, which ultimately is what is going to drive Syrian policy, in a unified, stable Iraq and progress toward the Iraqi people regaining control of their own affairs. Much more remains to be done and we will certainly push hard to see that performance, again in Syria's interest as well as America's, strengthened and improved in the future. The Chairman. What other factors could influence Syria to become more cooperative, in addition to contributing to its perception that the coalition is being successful in Iraq? Thus far it does not appear that economic difficulties in the country have led to particular changes. I suspect that the Senate is likely after this hearing to act on the Syria Accountability Act, which you have mentioned, and that it probably will pass the act, as the House of Representatives did. That would impose additional sanctions, hopefully with flexibility for the administration in the event that diplomatic activity becomes more promising. In fact we already have a number of sanctions on the country now and it does not appear that economic changes seem to be operative or at least determinative in terms of their activities. What else, in addition to success in Iraq, might change the picture? Ambassador Burns. Mr. Chairman, I think success in Iraq, which we are determined, as you know, to achieve, I think is crucial, not just with regard to Syrian behavior, but with regard to our interests throughout the region. I think the other argument that we will continue to try and drive home and that we have made repeatedly to President Asad and others in the Syrian leadership is that Syria is falling farther and farther behind the global economy and a recognition that I think is growing in many other societies in the Arab world that economic, social, political modernization is long overdue. It is very interesting in recent reports, there have been development reports that have been put out, a growing understanding in the region that home-grown economic and political reform is absolutely essential. There are things the United States could do to help in the region in support of that effort, and our hope certainly is that in Syria, as in other societies, there will be an appreciation of self-interest in moving in those directions, though we have not seen a lot of evidence so far. The Chairman. Ambassador Burns, it appears that economic indicators show that many, if not most, states in the Middle East continue to have deteriorating economic circumstances. This does not appear to have been determinative of their foreign policy. In other words, a growing gap occurs with the rest of the world, sliding downhill very rapidly. Some persons come to us and come to you and they say: Well, these are autocratic regimes, people who have their own agendas quite apart from the ordinary needs of common people for jobs and economic progress. But these regimes are supported. We are accused of supporting them, of propping them up, even in the midst of total default. In other words, Syria is not an archetype of this, but it is another case in which the economy is not quite a disaster, but heading rapidly to the rocks and shoals comparatively. Yet at the top there does not appear to be any change that is affecting any of that. Now, we may be right that we can try to cajole them: You ought to do more to help your people and we will do something here. But I am not sure that is working. That is why I probe this a little bit further. Ambassador Burns. Well, Mr. Chairman, it is not sinking in in certain societies, you are absolutely right. The truth is that stability in the Middle East, like anyplace else, is not a static phenomenon, and societies in the Middle East, like other parts of the world, that adapt, that adjust, that take the initiative on political, social, economic reform and look ahead are going to succeed, and those that do not are going to fall further and further behind and ultimately become failed regimes. I think that is simply the reality. It is not a function of American preaching as it is facts and, as I said, realities that have to be absorbed. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Ambassador. Senator Biden. Senator Biden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, again welcome. I say this not in any pejorative way. The neoconservative view and influence within the administration has argued and written fairly extensively that our use of power when necessary, particularly in the face of the disapprobation of the rest of the world, presents us with an opportunity to leverage that power to get malcontents in other parts of the world to straighten up, as my uncle used to say, straighten up and fly right. I think there is some truth to what they say, what they write. Some in the administration and some close advisers to the administration outside the administration argue that when we moved successfully in Iraq and our shock and awe program or initiative that we would see a change in behavior on the part of Syria relative to all our concerns, particularly support for terrorists. It looked like, for a moment anyway, or at least temporarily, when the Secretary of State made his visit to meet with the president of Syria shortly after the Syrians miscalculated in that they thought we would have a longer slog, to use a term from our Secretary of Defense, in bringing about the collapse of the Syria regime, they looked like they were going to take some concrete actions. If I am not mistaken, we demarched them with some specific requests relating to the location, the support, the visibility, the headquarters of and the offices of Hizballah and others. The initial, if memory serves me, the initial response seemed to be that they were going to take some action, and they did take some at least cosmetic actions. There were proposals from some of us--and I am not suggesting they were not shared by State or the President--that one of the things that we could do to also aid and abet the effort on the Road Map would be to insist that the Syrians allow the Lebanese army to replace on the Israeli border the forces that are there now, and that would have taken, the assumption was, the acquiescence at least of the Syrians, if not the direct intervention of the Syrians. So we all kind of waited to see what was likely to happen. Am I correct in suggesting that at the end of the day, that is today, not much did happen, notwithstanding what we may or may not have thought would happen after the visit of the Secretary of State? This is no veiled criticism of the Secretary of State. Did we see any activity initially and if we did, did it change? Or where are we today in terms of the specific requests made by the United States of America to the Syrian government to close down offices, etcetera? Ambassador Burns. Sir, I think there has been some incremental change, as you mentioned. But the honest answer is it is certainly short of the mark that Secretary Powell had emphasized during that meeting in early May. With regard to Iraq, as I said, there has been some recent movement on 1511, on borders, on assets held in Syrian banks; still more to be done. With regard to Palestinian terrorist groups--and Ambassador Black may want to add to this--there were some essentially cosmetic changes, as you mentioned, certain offices closing down, but still cadre of people in groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas continuing to operate, harbored by the Syrians, continuing to be involved financially, logistically, in terms of planning and direction of attacks against innocent civilians; a continuing relationship with Hizballah. You are right, Senator, the Secretary did emphasize, Secretary Powell did emphasize, in early May the concerns we have about Lebanon, the value of allowing the Lebanese armed forces to deploy fully to the border, and we have not seen significant movement in that direction. Senator Biden. I understand that cooperation between Syria and our military in the Mosul area of Iraq has been pretty good, with cross-border trade picking up, Iraqi oil being exported to Syria. And you both know better than I, this region of Iraq has had close historical ties with Syria. Now, the question that I keep wrestling with--and our witnesses I expect will speak to this a little bit as well--is, there is no doubt in my mind, and I may be wrong, but there is no doubt in my mind that the degree to which cooperation will take place on this broad front of concerns we have is directly related to whether or not they believe we are going to succeed in the region, in Iraq. Prior to us going into Iraq, a number of us made visits to heads of state throughout the region, and privately every head of state did say what the administration was saying they were privately saying: We have no love for Saddam Hussein; take him down, but if you take him down make sure you finish the job. I do not know how many times I heard that stated. That was the drumbeat in the background of the administration saying: Although the world says they are against us, they are really not against us; they are really for us doing this. But the tagline always was: Get the job finished, meaning establish stability when it is all said and done. Do not just replace him--I mean, do not just topple him, but replace him. So there is no doubt in my mind that what you are seeing is a sort of temporary paralysis in the region deciding which way is in my naked self-interest to go, based on whether the Americans are going to finish the job. But what I do not have a sense of--and I realize this is a fairly broad question, but I respect both your judgments, and that is why I am asking it-- what does your instinct tell you about whether or not they would like us to succeed in Iraq? I am ambivalent on that point. I am not--I can see a scenario where if I am sitting in Damascus it is very much in my interest for there to be on the one side a stable non- threatening Iraq to my north. On the other side, I can say: Well, God, I hope any of those notions of democracy or representative government do not spread to me; it could be dangerous. Have you run the calculus as to whether or not--not whether or not they are trying to make it more difficult and not whether or not their feinting and bobbing and weaving has anything to do with the outcome. What do you think they think is in their interest? And is it split within Syria between the old guard, if there is an old and new guard, because that is another--you know, we always look for these things. We are always looking for Jeffersons behind some rock somewhere who is going to pop up and democratize a nation. They seldom, if ever, exist. But I realize the question is fairly broad, but would you be willing to engage us a little bit in your sense of what you think Iraq would--I mean, what you think Syria would view as in their interest relative to Iraq? The reason I ask the question--and I conclude with this--is because assume there was--it was in their interest for them to have a say in what emerges in Baghdad whenever. Then is the six plus two arrangement that we used in Afghanistan, does that have any--is there any reason for us to be engaging Syria about the future of Iraq? That is more like an essay question. I apologize, but I would appreciate it if you would just speak to us a little bit about that. Ambassador Burns. Sure, I would be glad to try to, Senator Biden. First, as you suggested, historically there is no love lost between the Ba'athists in Damascus and the Saddam Hussein regime in Baghdad. A long history of tension between the two of them. So objectively in many ways it would seem at least to be in Syria's political interest to see that regime gone. Commercially, there has been a lot of interaction in the past and in the future a healthy Iraqi economy, a prosperous, stable Iraq, would seem to offer a number of possibilities for all of its neighbors. I think you are right, Senator, to suggest that, in fact I am certain that, there are some well-entrenched interests in Syria who view the prospect of a unified, prosperous, politically progressive or democratic regime and system of governance emerging in Iraq as threatening in some respects. But I think the bottom line probably is the Syrian regime is looking very carefully at what is going on in Iraq, and I think the real bottom line, as you suggested, is that success in Iraq, defined as the Iraqi people regaining control of their own affairs and living in peace with their neighbors, will probably have as great an impact as anything else on the calculations not just of the Syrian regime but others in the region. That is why the President is so determined to help Iraqis achieve that result. But I think there is a certain conflict in the minds of many Syrians in the regime about that outcome. Senator Biden. Mr. Black, do you have any comment? Ambassador Black. Senator, I could only echo what Assistant Secretary Burns said, but also what you have said. I think it is right on the mark. They are very pragmatic. They assess their environment and they will attempt to encourage those relationships and those situations that are in their interest. I think we all would hope that they would appreciate that a free Iraq that is prosperous, that is a good trading partner, on the whole is clearly to their advantage. Senator Biden. I thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Biden. Senator Chafee. STATEMENT OF HON. LINCOLN CHAFEE, U.S. SENATOR FROM RHODE ISLAND Senator Chafee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome to the witnesses. We had an opportunity in the last several weeks to visit the region and in our trip to Turkey we were fortunate enough to meet with Prime Minister Erdegan, and I asked him about the Syria Accountability Act, what would his advice be. He said that Asad really wants to steer his country more towards the middle--and of course Turkey shares a long border, of course, as you know, with Syria, and you might argue who would know better than someone who shares that long border with Syria the dynamics there. He said, as I was saying, that Asad wants to steer his country more towards the middle, and of course he has some political dynamics and some generals that make it difficult, but he does want to go in that direction; and by passing this bill it just will make that harder. According to Congressional Research Service, most if not all of the sanctions contemplated by the Accountability Act, the Syria Accountability Act, can already be imposed by the administration. Through the good work of Chairman Lugar, the House-passed version of the bill will be amended here in the Senate to give the President more flexibility in waiving the bill's sanctions. This means that a bill that a bill is widely perceived as a crackdown on Syria, but it has little substantive effect. So is this legislation really a lose-lose for the United States? Are we getting little additional muscle against Syria while further antagonizing the Arab world? I also say on our trip to the region, the same was true in Jordan; we heard the exact same thing: This passage would be a mistake; we are doing exactly what I said, forcing Syria to react in the opposite direction, and that the timing is not good. Can you comment, Secretary Burns? Ambassador Burns. Yes, sir. First, I would say that I hope that the impression that you heard from Turkish leaders is right. I hope that we will see actions on the part of the Syrian leadership that open up further possibilities in the future to work together on issues, whether it is Iraq or in other areas. As I said in my opening remarks, unfortunately we have not seen that kind of a fundamental change in behavior so far. The administration's position, as you know, sir, with regard to the Syria Accountability Act is that we are not going to oppose its passage. We are quite appreciative of the efforts of the chairman and others to look at ways in which the President's flexibility in conducting foreign policy and our policy towards Syria can be preserved, and we believe that is very important, and we will take a careful look at the language as it emerges. I think finally, Senator, it is hard for me to assess right now what the impact of passage of the Syria Accountability Act, should it be passed by the Congress, will be on Syrian behavior, on our relations with Syria. We have made very clear in repeated conversations with the Syrian leadership that inaction in the areas Secretary Powell first outlined last May is going to have consequences. We have made equally clear, as I said before, our willingness to build on issues or areas that should be of common concern for us. So I can only hope, I guess to conclude, that we will begin to see that kind of movement. But in the mean time, we have to recognize that we have some quite significant problems in the relationship and those problems are reflected in the Syria Accountability Act. Senator Chafee. As you testified, you do not know how Syria will react. So is it not worth the risk, if already the President has the powers to impose sanctions? Why take the risk on a high profile? We all know how these types of legislation get high visibility in the Arab world. Why even risk it if you do not know how they will react? The President already has the powers. Is it just the train is going down the track, you know the votes are going to pass, and you cannot stop it, so you are just having a not-opposed attitude? But why take that risk? Ambassador Burns. Well, sir, as I said, we obviously hope that not just the Syria Accountability Act should it pass, but the other points we have tried to emphasize in our direct contacts with the Syrians--and I would add also in what we have urged others, our friends in Europe, in the Quartet, and in the region, to emphasize to the Syrians in their own contacts, that that will have an impact. So our hope is, not just in terms of disincentives, which the Syria Accountability Act represents, but also in terms of the potential for a more normal kind of relationship, which we believe to be very much in Syrian self-interest, that taken together those steps will have an impact. But our position on the Syria Accountability Act remains as I described it. Senator Chafee. All right, very good. Thank you. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Chafee. Senator Coleman. STATEMENT OF HON. NORM COLEMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA Senator Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, I greatly appreciate your testimony, clearness in an area in which there is not always clarity. I believe we-- I think we would all like Asad to steer a course to the middle. If we could get there that would be great. My question is how we get there, and I think first we have got to look at how they act or how they are acting. Clearly, in the buildup to Operation Iraqi Freedom and your testimony, Secretary Burns, illicit oil trade, illicit transshipment of dual use and military-related items, I think night goggles that were used to kill our soldiers potentially, and today very clearly Syria being involved in supporting Hamas and Hizballah and a whole range of terrorist organizations that kill people; and as I read the testimony, not just in terms of sometimes a physical presence, but operationally. It seems that this is an operational center for folks that are out there undermining the peace process, taking lives. So the question is how do you impact that? It appears to me that this, quote, ``pragmatic'' formula is that the stronger we are, the more likely they will be to perhaps steer a middle. But it does not seem like it is because there is a desire to steer a middle. It does not seem like because there is an interest in it. It is because if we are strong all of a sudden they may stop doing what they are doing and have been doing for a long time, which is supporting terrorism. Are there--help me understand if that is it. It almost seems as if they kind of play with two hands: On the one hand they take some actions regarding al-Qaeda and when it looked like we were plowing through Iraq those seemed to be substantive actions; and at the same time, it is like somebody picking your pocket, in this case I think more than picking your pocket, I think clubbing you over the head with support of terrorism. Other than being strong, in which we force somebody to simply do the right thing, are there other things that we can do vis a vis with Syria? How do you deal with a nation like this beyond just simply being stronger than they would like you to be? Ambassador Burns. Well, Senator, a very complicated issue which we now continue to wrestle with. Obviously, success in Iraq, success in our other policies in the region, is critically important, as both Senators Lugar and Biden emphasized. Second, we continue to stress our commitment to comprehensive peace in the region. It is important for us to continue to do everything we can to revive some hope in the Road Map and in prospects for peace between Palestinians and Israelis and to keep the door open on the Syrian and Lebanon tracks as well. It is important for us in our conversations, not just directly with the Syrians but also with the Quartet, with the other European friends, with other partners in the region, to work with them to help drive home those same points in Syria, because this is not just an interest of the United States. It is I believe a widely shared interest. We hope also that that longer term need, which is as true in Syria, at least as true in Syria, as any other society in the Arab world, to modernize economically, to open up more educational and political opportunities, is going to be a direction in which that regime wants to move. So again, I do not have any magic formula to offer, Senator. It requires an awful lot of hard work. It requires a lot of very candid discussions. It requires us drawing lines where we have to draw lines on aspects of Syrian behavior, and that is what we are determined to do. Senator Coleman. I appreciate that. I would note in particular with other partners. If other partners came to us and said Asad is trying to steer towards the middle, go back and tell them: Well, tell him to stop supporting Hizballah because they are going to try to kill us, stop supporting Hamas because they are undermining the possibility of peace in the Middle East. And to Abdullah, who has been a good ally and somebody I believe we can trust, the same message, though: Deliver the message to the Syrians that if there is to be peace they have got to be part of the process and they have got to be part of the solution, not, as we used to say in the sixties, simply part of the problem. Ambassador Burns. Yes, sir, Senator. The only thing I would add to that is that is particularly true with regard to the legitimate aspirations and interests of Palestinians in moving toward a state. The actions that groups like Hamas and Jihad have taken have done as much to undermine those aspirations as anything else, made it that much more difficult for the Palestinian Authority to pull itself together and provide the kind of leadership that the Palestinians need and deserve. That is a message that the Syrians need to hear, not just from us but from others as well. Senator Coleman. You have a difficult job in a difficult area of the world, and I appreciate the work that you do. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Coleman. Senator Biden. Senator Biden. I am anxious to get to the second panel as well, Mr. Chairman, but I have one question. Bill, can you tell us a little bit about U.S.-European attitudes and where they diverge relative to Syria? The Europeans historically have had a slightly different take on all the Middle East, quite frankly, than we have. That does not suggest that their take has anything to do--that it is intentionally counterproductive to our interests. But do our allies in Europe agree with our approach to Syria? Is there any realistic possibility of getting on the same page and forging a united front with regard to Syria and their support of terror? Tell me a little bit about--you should have a lot of discussions with them as well. I mean, where are we in terms of that dynamic? Ambassador Burns. I think it is a very important point, Senator. Obviously, the Syrians need to hear, if we are going to have any impact on their behavior, not just from the United States, but from others. I think some of our friends in Europe have been pretty direct with the Syrian leadership about some of the concerns that I described to you today, again simply because they reflect real concerns on the part of Europeans as well. That is certainly true with regard to Syria's support for terrorist groups. I think it is increasingly true also with regard to the negative impact that Syrian harboring of those groups has had on the chances to revive the Road Map. Some of our Quartet partners have also been pretty direct with the Syrians about those concerns. At the same time, we have all tried to make clear that the door is open toward comprehensive peace, that this administration, like its predecessors, is committed to doing everything we can to work with the parties to revive progress on that track as well. So I guess to answer your question, Senator, I think there is potential to do more with our friends in Europe on the issue of Syria. I think we need to keep working hard at it. I would not want to pretend to you that our interests and approaches are identical because they are not, but I think there is a fair amount of overlap, which we need to keep working on. Senator Biden. Well, it seems to me that to the extent that we could harmonize those views we would have a--maybe I have been here too long, but I remember when we used to say--I remember when the gentleman about to testify was ambassador in that area of the world and we always talked about it in terms of U.S.-Soviet influence, and we talked about the Syrians having a godfather to the north and the reason we were not going to make much progress with Syria. And when the wall came down and when the Soviet empire crumbled and the ability of or the desire, both ability and desire, of the former Soviets, now Russians, was not nearly as invasive or involved or as capable of affecting events, there was the brief moment where there was hope that the rest of the world united would be able to bring some sense with a common purpose, a common front. It seems to me that is one of the real lost opportunities. I do not mean just--I am not talking about this administration, the last administration. I mean, rationalizing the policy to the extent that you can. I did not tell the truth there. I have one more question. Mr. Black, I asked you this in a different context, but if you are able to publicly answer this it would be useful. Has the United States concluded that weapons of mass destruction from Iraq were dispersed to Syria, as General Clapper of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency told the New York Times? Do you have any hard evidence that that is the case, as stated by Clapper, General Clapper, that Iraqis did disperse to Syria weapons of mass destruction? Ambassador Black. I appreciate the question. I will have to take it for the record. I specialize in counterterrorism. Weapons of mass destruction is the preserve of others. If I may, Senator, let me take that for the record and get back to you on that. [The information referred to above was not available before this hearing was sent to press.] Senator Biden. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Biden. Let me just carry that one step further. Are any of our allies, or at least countries with whom we have very strong relations, in addition to our European allies, active with us in our diplomacy with Syria? For example, have Egypt, the Saudi Arabians, or anyone else in the neighborhood, for maybe their own national interests, been involved with us in moving the Syrians toward a more constructive situation? Ambassador Burns. Yes, sir. We have had extensive conversations with the Egyptians, with the Jordanians, as well as with the Saudis and others, about this issue. It was a subject, for example, in Secretary Powell's meeting with President Mubarak about a week ago in Sharm el Sheikh. So it is natural for us to consult carefully with our friends in the region. We do not always see eye to eye on these issues, but I think there is a shared interest in trying to drive home the message about working as hard as we all possibly can to fight terrorism and violence, which again have done so much to obstruct our deep interest in reviving hope in the Road Map. I am sure those consultations will continue and I am sure efforts will continue on the part of our friends in the region. The Chairman. I join all members of our committee in thanking you-- Senator Boxer. Could I have-- The Chairman. Yes, I am sorry. Senator Boxer. I just snuck in on you. The Chairman. Senator Boxer. STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA Senator Boxer. Thank you. Thank you so much. In the nick of time, I stopped the inevitable gavel. The Chairman. Exactly. Senator Boxer. As the author of the Syria Accountability Act, I want to thank Chairman Lugar for his help now. He is very determined that we have a waiver, the broad waiver. It is in place, and I think we are ready to go. I wanted to, because I know there are some who do not favor it, to lay out why I think it is important very briefly and then ask one question to you, either of you who wishes to answer. I have always believed in life that the truth will set you free. You have to tell the truth. I especially think it is important in foreign policy. Now, clearly diplomacy means that you tell the truth in the most sensitive way, and you are the masters of that. I am not good at that, but you are very good at that, and I really have to say that our chairman and ranking member are very good at that. I am a little more to the point, although I think Senator Biden is known for speaking straight from the shoulder quite often. But when it comes to Syria, it is about time we just told the truth. I feel that way about Saudi Arabia, although I do not quite know what the truth is because we cannot get information that we really ought to have. But that is another hearing for another time. So really what we are saying is that the President can impose sanctions, and I wanted it to be must impose sanctions, but with the compromise he can impose sanctions, which I think are very wisely ratcheted up, if Syria does not cease providing support for international terrorist groups and does not allow terrorist groups such as Hamas, Hizballah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and others to maintain facilities in territory under their control. This is a terrible problem. This is a haven for terrorists. You know, as the President said after 9-11, we cannot have people shielding terrorists. So we can no longer walk away. I am the happiest person when Syria helps us in some way or another. I encourage that. But still in all, you cannot really help us in the long run if you are allowing these terrorists to be there. Lebanon occupation, another one. Development and deployment of long-range ballistic missiles and research into such weapons, and ceasing all support for terrorist activities inside of Iraq, and I know others have talked about that. So what do we do here? We just simply give the President or, shall we say, we--as Senator Chafee said, the President could do this anyway, but the Congress will go on record when we finally pass this act, which I think is long overdue--and I disagreed so strongly with the administration when Secretary Powell said this will not helpful, having this act, this will not be helpful. That was just a few months ago. Then he went over there and sat with Syria and said: You know, you have got to watch out for that Congress; they are going to pass the Syria Accountability Act. Well, I thought that was pretty helpful of us to have that there. So you know, I just think when I look at this list: prohibiting export to Syria of any item on the U.S. munitions list, imposing two or more of the following sanctions: the export of products of the U.S. other than food and medicine to Syria; and prohibiting U.S. business from investing and operating; prohibiting Syrian aircraft from taking off or landing in the U.S. And it goes on: diplomats in D.C. can only travel within a 25-mile radius. That is harsh. It is very harsh. But what they are doing is harsh. And if we hope to wrap our arms around this terrorism issue, we have to start telling the truth and putting something behind it. Frankly, if you were to ask people, I am a person what so hesitates to move towards war. I am probably the last person, one of the last, that will vote for war. I have done it, but I do it very rarely. So why would I support this? Because this is a way to avoid a military confrontation, because we are sending a very clear signal. We are not going to surprise someone in the middle of the night and attack them. We are saying this is bad, this is wrong, this goes against world norms, and we are ready to push forward with economic sanctions. I think that is a way to avoid a confrontation. That is the last thing we need. It is the last thing we want. We all want a peaceful world. So my question, and then I am done, is: What really triggered the change of the administration on my bill? That is my question. Ambassador Burns. Thanks, Senator Boxer. I think we have worked very hard, and I do not think anybody has worked harder than Secretary Powell, to try and speak the plain truth on these issues, as candidly and directly as we could with the Syrian leadership. We continue to hope for changes in Syrian behavior and we will continue to work hard to achieve them, but hope alone is not a reliable basis for policy. The administration has recognized that there are elements of Syrian behavior right now which cause real problems for our interests, as they have for years. It was against that backdrop that the White House took the decision that we would not oppose the passage of the Syria Accountability Act. As I said, it is very hard--as I said, I am sorry, Senator Boxer, before you came-- Senator Boxer. I am sorry, I am involved with these fires. Ambassador Burns. Not at all, no. It is hard to predict what the impact is going to be. We certainly hope that the passage of the act, should it be passed, as well as our continuing direct efforts with the Syrians, our efforts with the Europeans and others, is going to have an impact, a positive impact. Senator Boxer. So there was not anything specific that changed your mind that they are doing since the war or anything else? It is just an accumulation of behavior that all of a sudden you thought this is the time? Ambassador Burns. It is an accumulation. I am not sure if it was an all of a sudden decision as much as it is an accumulation of efforts on our part that did not produce, have not yet produced, all the results we want to see. We are going to keep at it, keep open the possibility of more normal relations, but that is going to require tangible actions on the part of the Syrian leadership. Senator Boxer. Thank you for your flexibility. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. The Chairman. Well, thank you very much, Senator Boxer, for coming to the hearing at a timely moment. Senator Boxer. Yes, right. The Chairman. Well, we thank you both again, and we will now proceed with our next panel. That panel includes Dr. Patrick Clawson, the Honorable Richard Murphy, Dr. Murhaf Jouejati, and Mr. Flynt Leverett. Gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us this morning. I would like for you to testify in the order that I introduced you, and that will be first of all Dr. Patrick Clawson. Please proceed. STATEMENT OF PATRICK CLAWSON, PH.D., DEPUTY DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON INSTITUTE FOR NEAR EAST POLICY Dr. Clawson. Thank you, sir. Let me summarize my statement, please. Since assuming the Syrian presidency in June 2000 on the death of his father, Hafez Al-Asad, Bashar Asad has established a track record. The regime change in Syria has been bad for Syria, bad for the Middle East, and bad for U.S.-Syrian relations. In every area of concern to the United States, Bashar Asad's rule has been worse than that of his father, which is impressive given how bad a ruler was his father, and the problems are growing, not diminishing. Let me just briefly summarize the areas where Bashar's track record has been worse than that of Hafez Asad. On the areas where we had differences with Hafez Asad and where we had good reason to hope that Bashar would make a difference, things have gotten worse. For instance, anti-peace process terrorism. My boss, the Director of the Washington Institute, Dennis Ross, has written in the Wall Street Journal, ``Hafez Asad was no slouch when it came to threatening Israel, but he controlled the flow of Iranian arms to Hizballah and he never provided Syrian weapons directly. Bashar Asad seems to lack his father's sense of limits.'' Hafez Asad never met with the secretary general of Hizballah, Mr. Nasrollah. Bashar Asad meets with him frequently and treats him like his senior adviser and mentor. Second, weapons of mass destruction. Rather than just maintaining the already troubling capabilities that Syria had when he came to office, Bashar Asad has plowed ahead with developing more sophisticated capabilities, worse chemical weapons, and longer range missiles. On Lebanon, despite Israeli withdrawal in May 2000, Bashar Asad has insisted that Hizballah retain its arms, thereby making it a destabilizing and radical force in Lebanese politics. On economic and political reform, the great hope was that Bashar Asad would make economic growth his priority, and indeed there was a Damascus spring with limited liberalization when he came to office. But winter set in early. For participating in civil society meetings 2 years ago, 10 human rights activists have been sentenced to prison for 2 to 5 years and just this week a military court is trying 14 more human rights activists. On the areas where Hafez Asad had some minimal cooperation with U.S. interests, things have gotten worse under Bashar. Peace negotiations with Israel, they are completely shut down. Damascus now rarely bothers to pretend that it is willing to talk to Israel. On the issue of Iraq, under Hafez Asad for better than 10 years there was a ``do no evil'' approach, not getting in the way of U.S. policy towards Iraq. Now, instead Bashar Asad has shown a willingness to work with the worst forces in Iraq. Not only did he cooperate closely with Saddam Hussein on economic relations while Syria was still in power, but even as Saddam's regime was falling Bashar Asad remained friendly and provided assistance to the Saddamites. Then finally there is the question of radical Islamist terrorism. One can complain about many things about Hafez Asad, but he had a firm hand, indeed a cruel and inhuman hand, toward Islamist terrorists. Bashar Asad I am afraid has changed that approach. Initially, after the September 11th, 2001, attacks Syria did cooperate with the United States against al-Qaeda, but that has changed. Ambassador Black, Mr. Black, was referring earlier to our ambiguous--our dissatisfaction, excuse me, with the ambiguous record of the Syrians. Let me just note, there was a very interesting case in Italy recently in which the Italian prosecutors going after an al-Qaeda cell showed that Syria, in their words, had ``functioned as a hub for an al-Qaeda network,'' and the detailed telephone wiretaps that the Italian police presented showed how this al-Qaeda cell had been coordinating its activities in Syria and through Syria. So Bashar Asad seems to be campaigning to join the axis of evil. He needs to be confronted with a starker choice: bigger sticks if he persists in his path, but bigger carrots if he makes significant progress in some of the areas of our concern. Whether or not the Syria Accountability Act becomes law, the United States has a variety of other instruments it could use to turn up the heat on Syria. The Asad regime cares deeply about statements by top U.S. officials about the legitimacy of that government and there is much that we can do to reach out to support pro-democracy activists in Washington. It is interesting to note that in 2 weeks time there will be a meeting here in Washington of Syrian pro-democracy activists. Two years ago, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy published an optimistic monograph full of hope the Bashar Asad would improve governance, open up Syria to the outside world, let Lebanon regain its sovereignty, and make peace with Israel. That study, prepared under my direction by an Israeli scholar, showed what an opportunity Bashar Asad had. He has not made good use of his first 3 years. Let us hope that, if faced with starker choices between a better future and real risks for his regime, he will make better use of the coming years. Thank you, sir. [The prepared statement of Dr. Clawson follows:] Prepared Statement of Patrick Clawson Since assuming the Syrian presidency in June 2000 on the death of his father Hafez Al-Asad, Bashar Al-Asad has established a track record. The regime change in Syria has been bad for Syria, bad for the Middle East, and bad for U.S.-Syrian relations. In every area of concern to the United States, Bashar Asad's rule has been worse than that of his father--which is impressive, given how bad a ruler was his father. And the problems are growing, not diminishing. The risk is that if Washington basically ignores Syria, Bashar Asad will go from bad to worse. Bashar Asad's track record makes depressing reading. Things have gotten worse in the areas where Hafez Asad was a problem--and where there was good reason to hope Bashar Asad would make improvements: Anti-peace-process terrorism. Commenting about Bashar Asad's provision to Hizballah of Syrian 270 mm rockets which threaten Israel's third largest city (Haifa), Washington Institute Director Dennis Ross wrote in the Wall Street Journal, ``Hafez Asad was no slouch when it came to threatening Israel. But he controlled the flow of Iranian arms to Hizballah, and he never provided Syrian weapons directly. Bashar Asad seems to lack his father's sense of limits.'' 1 Besides the provision of these dangerous rockets, another sign of Bashar Asad's imbalance is that Hafez Asad never met with Hizballah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrollah; Bashar Asad not only meets and telephones Nasrollah often, but Bashar Asad goes so far as to treat Nasrollah like his respected mentor and advisor. While Bashar Asad promised Secretary of State Colin Powell during his May 2003 visit to Damascus that Syria would take concrete steps against terrorists operating out of Syria, Powell has described Syria's actions since then as ``limited steps'' which ``are totally inadequate.'' 2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Dennis Ross, ``The Hidden Threat in the Mideast,'' Wall Street Journal, June 24, 2002. \\2\\ Press conference by Colin Powell, June 20, 2003. WMD. Rather than just maintaining Syria's already troubling capabilities to hit Israel with hundreds of CW-tipped Scud missiles, Bashar Asad has ploughed ahead with developing more sophisticated capabilities, including more toxic and persistent chemical weapons such as VX and longer-range missiles. According to reports from the CIA, Syria is building up a domestic missile industry, working on both solid propellant and --------------------------------------------------------------------------- liquid propellant product capabilities. Lebanon. Hafez Asad had the excuse of Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon which he could claim as justification for the continued Syrian military presence in Lebanon and for Syria's insistence that Hizballah be allowed to have a potent military militia, years after all civil-war-era militias were disarmed. Israeli withdrawal in May 2000 ended that excuse, but Bashar Asad has insisted that Hizballah retain its arms, thereby making it a destabilizing radical force in Lebanese politics. He has pulled about half of the 30,000 Syrian troops out of Lebanon but he has used Syrian secret police to continue to control the increasingly restive Lebanese.3 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Estimates of Syrian troop strength in Lebanon differ; the source here is Alfred Prados, ``Syria: U.S. Relations and Bilateral Issues,'' Congressional Research Service paper IB92075, updated October 10, 2003, p 5. Economic and political reform. The great hope was that Bashar Asad would make economic growth his priority, and that he would therefore allow more space for the private sector and more interaction with the outside world--civil society could begin to emerge. Initially, there was a Damascus Spring with limited liberalization--but winter came early, as those expressing criticisms were rounded up. For participating in civil society meetings in 2001, ten human rights activists were sentenced to prison for two to five years.4 Last week, a military court began a kangaroo trial of fourteen human rights activists arrested for attending an August 2003 lecture marking the fortieth anniversary of the declaration of a state of emergency in Syria. Meanwhile, the September 2003 government reshuffle bodes ill for the few economic reforms Bashar Asad instituted in his first year. The new prime minister, Muhammad Naji Otri, can best be described as an old-style Ba'athist hack. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Amnesty International regularly covers the miserable human rights situation in Syria; cf. its October 21, 2003 press release about the start of the military court trial. And on the areas where Hafez Asad had at least some minimal cooperation with U.S. interests, things have gotten dramatically worse --------------------------------------------------------------------------- under Bashar Asad: Peace negotiations with Israel are completely shut down. Damascus rarely bothers to pretend it is willing to talk to Israel. Syria has been unhelpful to initiatives to advance the peace process, including its efforts to twist the 2002 Saudi initiative at the Arab League to convert it from an offer to Israel normal relations with the Arab world into a restatement of maximalist Arab demands. Furious at the Saudi initiative, Bashar Asad went so far as to organize a rare mass protest in Damascus against the plan. Syria has encouraged the fiction that Israel has not fully withdrawn from Lebanon, despite the UN Security Council's firm determination that Israel has fulfilled its obligations under UN resolutions. Syrian policy appears to confirm the skeptics who thought that an Alawite- dominated government wants to keep the conflict with Israel going so as to justify its repressive rule as necessary for national unity against the external enemy. The ``do no evil'' approach towards Iraq has been replaced with a bold willingness to take risks to work with the worst forces in Iraq. Whereas his father had a cold if not hostile relationship towards Saddam, Bashar Asad embraced him, re- opening an oil pipeline which had been closed for twenty years; between one and two billion dollars a year worth of oil flowed through that pipeline, though it is not clear how the revenue was shared between the two dictators. Bashar Asad flat-out lied to Secretary of State Colin Powell when he personally promised in March 2001 that any revenue from the pipeline would go into the UN oil-for-food program--a promise Powell thought sufficiently important that he had President Bush woken to share the good news. To be sure, in November 2002, Syria voted in the UN Security Council for Resolution 141 demanding Iraqi compliance with past UN orders, but it seems that Syria, like France, believed that resolution could be invoked to prevent U.S. military action against Iraq. Syrian policy got worse as the war approached. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has accused Syria of sending Saddam's forces on the eve of the war night-vision goggles, antitank weapons, aircraft parts, and ammunition.5 During the war, Bashar Asad allowed thousands of irregulars to cross the border to fight on Saddam's side; busloads of Syrian jihadists were joined by warriors from across the Arab world. What is particularly difficult to understand is why Bashar Asad remained friendly to the Saddam clan even after they lost power; Rumsfeld has accused Damascus of providing safe haven to fleeing Ba'ath officials.6 As recently as September, both Defense and State Department officials referred to a continuing flow of resistance volunteers across the Syrian border.7 There are credible reports that Syria remains a safe haven for former Saddamites. Treasury Department officials have pressed Syria, with no known success, to live up to its obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1443 to surrender to the U.S.-administered Fund for Development in Iraq the $3 billion in Iraqi assets held in Syrian-controlled banks.8 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ For references, see Max Abrahms, ``When Rogues Defy Reason: Bashar's Syria,'' Middle East Quarterly, Fall 2003, p 53. \\6\\ For references, see the excellent article by Eyal Zisser, ``Syria and the United States: Bad Habits Die Hard,'' Middle East Quarterly, Summer 2003, pp 29-38. \\7\\ See Prados, ``Syria: U.S. Relations,'' p 6. \\8\\ Douglas Jehl, ``U.S. Believes Syrian Banks Hold $3 Billion in Iraqi Funds,'' New York Times, October 21, 2003, p. A8. The firm--indeed, cruel and inhumane--control over Islamists under Hafez Asad has been replaced with a permissive attitude for those who wish to attack U.S. interests. The concern in Hafez Asad's time was his vicious repression of those with even modest Islamist tendencies, most evident in the 1982 slaughter of 10,000 residents of Hama. Initially, the hope was that Bashar would ease the state's heavy hand on the genuinely religious while at the same time preventing radical Islamist terrorists from using Syrian soil. And indeed, right after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Syria did cooperate with the United States in going after al-Qaeda elements. But as State Department coordinator for counterterrorism Coffer Black said in May 2003, ``We clearly don't have the full support of the Syrian government on the Al-Qaeda problem. They have allowed Al-Qaeda personnel to come in and virtually settle in Syria with their knowledge and their support.'' 9 Moreover, according to Italian prosecutors in their indictment of al-Qaeda members, ``Syria has functioned as a hub for an al Qaida network.'' The Italian police wiretaps found that the suspects'' conversations ``paint a detailed picture of overseers in Syria coordinating the movement of recruits and money.'' As State Department spokesman said on October 8 when asked about the Syrian Accountability Act, ``Frankly, the Syrians have done so little with regard to terrorism that we don't have a lot to work with.'' 10 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ Black's statement and the Italian indictment referred to in the next sentence are from Matthew Levitt, ``Terror from Damascus, Part II: Hizballah and Al-Qaeda Terrorist Activity in Syria,'' Washington Institute Peacewatch No. 421, May 9, 2003. \\10\\ Cited in Prados, ``Syria: U.S. Relations,'' p 15. And then there is Syrian vitriol directed against the United States. Bashar Asad has warned Arabs against U.S. friendship, calling it ``more fatal than its hostility.'' 11 Syria's attitude towards the war with Iraq was spelled out by Foreign Minister Faruq ash-Shara: ``We want Iraq's [that is, Saddam's] victory.'' 12 Bashar Asad seems to be campaigning to join the axis of evil. He needs to be confronted with a starker choice: bigger sticks if he persists in this path, but bigger carrots if he makes significant progress in several of the areas outlined above. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ In his speech at the Arab summit at Sharm al-Sheikh, as carried on Syrian television, March 1, 2003. \\12\\ Syrian Arab News Agency, March 30, 2003. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is in this context that the Syrian Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 recently passed the House of Representatives. This Act provides the President flexibility, such that he could initially impose modest penalties from the list of six in the law while at the same time he could suggest to Damascus that failure to make progress on the matters of concern to Washington would lead him to impose some of the tougher penalties in that list of six. Some might say that the Act is largely symbolic, but do not underestimate the importance of symbols. The reaction by Damascus to the Act's progress-- extensive coverage in the Syrian press and frequent statements by Syrian officials--demonstrates how deeply the Syrian government cares about the U.S. stance towards their actions. Whether or not some version of the Syrian Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act becomes law, the United States has a variety of other instruments it can use to turn up the heat on Syria. Washington can hit hard at the legitimacy of the Asad dynasty through tough statements from top officials supporting democracy in Syria. Radio Sawa, which has a wide audience among Arab youth, could do tough reporting about Syria's corruption, human rights violations and miserable economic performance. U.S. officials at various levels could meet in public with Syrian dissidents. It is encouraging to note that there will be a meeting in Washington in two weeks time of Syrian pro- democracy activists. Were State Department officials to attend the meeting, the message to Damascus would be clear. At the same time, the United States could consider some carrots. Initial steps could build on Bashar Asad's interest in computer technology, e.g., providing computer education--either over the internet or via a Peace Corps program in Syria--and enhancing training opportunities for Syrians in the United States. Should relations improve further, Washington could help promote Syria as a place where U.S. companies--especially in telecommunications, high tech, and oil/ gas exploration--should pursue business. It would be useful if U.S. actions were coordinated with the European Union "
