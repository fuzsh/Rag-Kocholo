        "text": "I never got too far with this the first time around, and after being here a while I thought of some ways I could improve upon what I had already posted, so I'm starting over from the beginning with some changes along the way.\n\nAmerica as Parliamentary Democracy, 2002-Present\n\nIntroduction / Background Notes\n\nThe emphasis in this series will probably be more on how the major political figures of the United States fit into this system than on major changes in actual historical events (though the exact role played by the U.S. in some events may change). Also, while some real-life media figures appear in news broadcasts and talk shows, the print and online journalists whose work is “excerpted” in places are mostly fictional.\n\nThe scenario imagines an alternate history in which the United States achieved independence from the United Kingdom in a more gradual fashion akin to what occurred in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. No Revolutionary War was ever fought, slavery was abolished in accordance with the UK’s Slavery Abolition Act 1833, and there was no Civil War in the 19th century. (However, Southern lawmakers did enact considerable institutionalized discrimination after 1833, similar to what happened after the Civil War in real life, with racism and oppression of African-Americans being a major factor in American politics just as in real life.) The United States was granted full functional independence as the Dominion of United States of America in 1856, an example soon followed by Canada in 1867, and has been referred to only as the United States of America ever since 1904. Also, the nation’s capital is referred to as “Columbia,” as George Washington does not occupy quite as prominent a role in this version of history.\n\nThe United States has followed the mother country’s example of Westminster-style parliamentary democracy, with a Governor-General serving as nominal head of state but exercising no real powers. Though the Senate exists, most powers rest in the House of Commons (meaning that many real-life Senators are instead incumbents in, or challengers for, seats in the House instead). Seats are informally referred to as “ridings,” and members of the House are referred to as MPs (members of parliament). A nonpartisan electoral commission controls most of the mechanics of elections, with the result that partisan gerrymandering and deliberate creation of majority-minority seats largely do not occur, while federal elections are held on national holidays. There is also less expectation that an MP will necessarily live in his or her own riding. Certain social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and capital punishment are typically treated as “conscience votes” in Parliament.\n\nTHE POLITICAL PARTIES\n\nThe CONSERVATIVE PARTY has been in power more often than any other party, having emerged from the Tory tradition in the mid-1800s and establishing itself over time as a pro-business, socially traditionalist party that tends to be hawkish on foreign policy, though a more isolationist faction still exists. Economic libertarians have also made the Conservative Party their home, viewing it as an acceptable vehicle for their ideas if sometimes too cautious. A small group of Conservative MPs, however, tend to be more moderate on economic issues and are sometimes referred to as “Red Tories,” though the size and influence of this faction has been shrinking.\n\nThe LIBERAL PARTY similarly grew out of the Whig tradition, later becoming home to the Progressive movement of the early 20th century under leaders such as Woodrow Wilson and Robert LaFollette. They are supportive of the welfare state but cautious about government intervention in the economy, while taking left-of-centre positions on social issues most of the time. They lost ground to Labour in the 1930s, receding to third-party status, but rebounded somewhat amidst the anti-government politics of the late ‘70s and ‘80s, during which some moderate voters opposed to the Conservatives turned to them as a more realistic alternative than Labour.\n\nThe LABOUR PARTY emerged around the beginning of the 20th century, with roots in the trade union activism of industrial America as well as the populist farmers’ movements in certain rural areas. They take a broadly social democratic approach to the economy and social services, and while a majority of Labour MPs tend to be socially liberal, there is also a sizeable faction of MPs, mostly from the South and Midwest, that take conservative stances on issues such as abortion or same-sex marriage. Labour also have strong historic ties to the African-American community due to their role in getting civil rights legislation passed.\n\nThe GREEN PARTY reflects the concerns of the environmental movement and take left-wing stands on most issues, but have thus far been unsuccessful in electing MPs to the House of Commons.\n\nThe relationship between Labour and the Liberals is more cooperative than that of, for example, the Liberal-NDP relationship in Canada or the Labour-Liberal Democrat relationship in the United Kingdom. Because the two parties usually need each other’s support to surpass the Conservatives, they encourage local riding associations to negotiate non-competition agreements for certain seats where a split vote would likely lead to a Conservative victory. However, they are not a permanent coalition along the lines of the Australian Liberal-National Coalition. Neither is content simply to be the “junior partner,” both form their own front benches when in opposition, and there are certain ridings where the main competition is between Labour and Liberal candidates with the Conservatives in a distant third place. A number of state parliaments are governed by Labour majorities or Liberal majorities alone, and Liberal-Conservative alliances have even been formed from time to time in certain states.\n\nCorrespondence between these parties and their real-life counterparts:\n\nLabour: Progressive Democrats, economically populist Democrats, other left-wing figures such as Bernie Sanders and Ralph Nader\n\nLiberal: Fiscally centrist Democrats, liberal Republicans, some moderate Republicans\n\nConservative: Conservative Republicans, some moderate Republicans, libertarian conservatives, conservative Democrats\n\nGreen: Mostly overlaps with the real-life Green Party, minus Ralph Nader’s involvement\n\nBackground notes:\n\nWhat a \"free vote\" means in parliamentary systems and some examples from the UK:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience_vote#In_the_United_Kingdom\n\nOCTOBER 2002: DICK GEPHARDT RESIGNS AS LABOUR LEADER\n\nEXCERPT FROM:\n\nUSBC NEWSHOUR WITH JIM LEHRER – OCTOBER 2, 2002\n\nJIM LEHRER: Welcome to USBC NewsHour, I’m Jim Lehrer. In perhaps the clearest example of traditional partisan politics re-emerging over the Bush Government’s push for military action against Iraq, long-serving Labour Party Leader Dick Gephardt has announced today that he is resigning his position. Mr. Gephardt had been criticized heavily within party ranks over his stated support for authorizing military action, despite having promised to allow his party a free vote on the matter. Here is Mr. Gephardt at this afternoon’s press conference.\n\n[BEGIN CLIP]\n\nDICK GEPHARDT: After consulting at length with colleagues, friends, and supporters, I have come to the conclusion that the best course of action for my party and for my country is for me to resign as leader of the Labour Party. My resignation will take effect tomorrow, and in accordance with Labour Party rules, my colleague and Deputy Leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, will assume the role of parliamentary leader on an interim basis.\n\n[END CLIP]\n\nJIM LEHRER: Here in the studio to discuss this development are Gwen Ifill, host of USBC’s Columbia Chronicles, Fred Barnes of the Conservative-supporting Weekly Standard, and Katrina Vanden Heuvel of The Nation magazine, a publication traditionally supportive of Labour. Gwen, I’ll start with you – Gephardt chose to resign more or less effective immediately, and just two weeks before the House of Commons is scheduled to vote on authorizing the use of military force against Iraq. How does this play out for the Labour Party?\n\nGWEN IFILL: Well, I think what Dick Gephardt realized was that, with the vast majority of Labour MPs, union leaders, and riding associations opposed to the push for war, his position was simply untenable. Even on a free vote, with an issue this important, you just can’t have the party leader advocating one position and the vast majority of his MPs voting the other way. By timing this resignation as he did, he gives the party what it wants in the short term, in that Nancy Pelosi will be leading them when the authorization vote is taken. In the meantime, Labour will have a leadership convention next year, which gives them some time to make the decision of who leads them into the next election.\n\nJIM LEHRER: Just to be clear for our viewers – Nancy Pelosi opposes the authorization?\n\nGWEN IFILL: Correct.\n\nJIM LEHRER: And can we expect her to use the party whip to enforce a No vote on the authorization?\n\nGWEN IFILL: No, I think she’ll still make it a free vote – there’s a small minority of Labour MPs in favor of the authorization, not least among them Dick Gephardt, who will now be sitting on the backbenches, and I don’t think she wants to instigate that kind of dispute as an interim leader. The difference is that when it comes to the debate in parliament, she’ll be able to use the platform of Labour Party Leader to articulate the clear anti-war stance that reflects the party’s prevailing view.\n\nJIM LEHRER: Fred Barnes, what’s the thinking within the Government on this? Do they pull back a bit to see if they can drum up more cross-partisan support for the resolution?\n\nFRED BARNES: No, I think most MPs have made up their minds – there’s not much to be gained by waiting to call the vote or changing the wording of the resolution at this point. I will say that, while I’ve never been a fan of Dick Gephardt, I think it’s a shame that his leadership comes to an end in this manner. He clearly shared the Government’s view that this was a necessary measure to protect the American people, and his resignation means that we’ll have less of a united front on the floor of the House of Commons.\n\nJIM LEHRER: Katrina, I think it’s fair to say that Ms. Pelosi has not been one of the more high-profile members of the Labour front bench – she may have served as Mr. Gephardt’s Deputy Leader, but she isn’t necessarily a household name for most Americans. What can you tell us about her, and do you see her as a candidate for the permanent position?\n\nKATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Nancy Pelosi is a good example of a politician whose expertise has been more in the policy arena and the legislative process rather than in public relations. You don’t see her on the news every night, but she’s hard at work each day as the Labour Party’s manager of legislative business, and she’s earned a lot of respect among colleagues. All that said, she isn’t someone that, as far as I know, is typically seen as having a burning ambition for higher office, so I couldn’t really say at this point whether or not she’ll run for the permanent job.\n\nJIM LEHRER: Are there any other names you’re hearing who might be thinking about running for the permanent position?\n\nKATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Well, one MP that some in the party’s grassroots really love right now is Barack Obama, the Health and Social Services critic. He’s a relatively new MP, young, a fantastic speaker, potentially the first African-American to lead one of the major parties, and he’s also a clear opponent of the Iraq War. But I’m told that he and those around him think he still needs to build up his resume before trying to climb the party ranks any further, so he may end up not running. There’s a lot of support for Joe Biden among the trade unions and on the right wing of the party, though I think he’d have to walk back some of his initial comments about Iraq.\n\nJIM LEHRER: We’ve seen this sort of, almost, family custom in the Labour Party where somebody from the hard left runs in every leadership election and inevitably loses. Are we going to see that again now?\n\nKATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: (laughs) Probably. And the problem the hard left faces is that their base of support is really concentrated in the riding associations. They don’t have much support among the trade unions, nor do many MPs identify with them, and you need some support from all three parts of Labour’s “electoral college” to have a chance at winning. As for who will take up their standard, my best guess would be either Paul Wellstone or Dennis Kucinich.\n\nJIM LEHRER: I’ll turn now to Gwen and Fred. Obviously there’s no perfect candidate out there, but in light of the drawbacks of each of the individuals Katrina has mentioned, is there anyone who checks off all the boxes for Labour that you could see entering the race?\n\nFRED BARNES: Well, I’ve said all along that taking this hard-line anti-war stance will backfire on Labour at some point. Whether they realize that before the leadership election or not, I don’t know – my guess is no, because I don’t think the union leaders and riding associations that essentially just forced Dick Gephardt out are going to change their minds. That said, one name that they might consider would be the current finance spokesman, Richard Durbin, who hails from the soft left faction and once served as Finance Minister in Illinois’s state government.\n\nKATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Durbin’s already said he isn’t running.\n\nFRED BARNES: Sure, but politicians are known for saying they aren’t running for something and then changing their minds when circumstances become more amenable. If it ends up being Biden versus Kucinich or Wellstone, a lot of Labour MPs may go looking to recruit somebody who’s a more unifying figure.\n\nJIM LEHRER: Gwen?\n\nGWEN IFILL: I think Durbin is unlikely to get in, but one person I’d keep an eye on is John Edwards, the MP from North Carolina. He doesn’t have a long resume in government or on the party’s frontbench, but he’s impressed a lot of people at Labour campaign events with his speaking style, and he could help to give the party a more populist image.\n\nJIM LEHRER: Fred, Katrina, Gwen, thank you for your insights. We turn now to the latest on how the military is preparing for potential action in Iraq….\n\nOCTOBER 2002: THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AUTHORIZES THE IRAQ WAR\n\nEXCERPT FROM: HARDBALL WITH CHRIS MATTHEWS (MSNBC) – OCTOBER 12, 2002\n\n[Footage from the floor of the House of Commons]\n\nSPEAKER DENNIS HASTERT: On the matter of HC 1126, the Authorization for the Use of Military Force against Iraq, the Ayes to the right are 296, the Noes to the left are 139. The Ayes have it.\n\n[In studio]\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: That was the scene today in the House of Commons. As you can see, authorization for the Government to wage war in Iraq passed by a comfortable margin. My colleague Dan Abrams delved into the broader implications for foreign policy in the previous hour, now we’ll take a look at the political fallout. With me here is MSNBC contributor Howard Fineman. Howard, it’s clear that, despite all three party leaders allowing a free vote, most Conservative and Labour MPs lined up on opposite sides of this issue. But look at the split in the Liberal Party. What’s that about?\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: What it’s about is that the Liberal Party is in fact deeply divided over this issue, both in parliament and among the general public. There have been a number of opinion polls recently—\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: Let’s put one of them up on-screen so everyone can see what you’re referring to.\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: Right. And that’s what they consistently show – a majority of Liberal voters favor the resolution, but that 37 percent opposed is nothing to shrug off. And focus groups have shown that these anti-war Liberal supporters are not just opposed to the resolution, but they are in fact very disappointed and even angry with the party leadership. They really feel that their party is making the wrong call on this and should take a stance of clear opposition.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: So if the party is so divided, why is their Shadow Foreign Secretary, Joe Lieberman, out there banging the war drum every day? I mean, the way he’s talking, he sounds like an even bigger hawk than half the Conservative Party.\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: Well, from what I’ve heard, some of his colleagues have actually been urging him to tone it down. But, you know, Joe Lieberman is sometimes, depending on how you look at it, either deeply principled or exasperatingly stubborn.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: Ha!\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: And he firmly believes that this is the right thing to do and he’s not shy about using his position to advocate his view.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: These Liberal MPs who just voted against it have been relatively quiet about their opposition, and the entire Shadow Cabinet voted in favor of the resolution. Is Kerry just going to treat this as a backbench rebellion that failed, or does he need to do something to take their views into account?\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: If you look at his actual remarks, so far he’s taking the position that the Government should have the authority to take military action, but that they should only use it as a last resort and build more of an international coalition first. And that’s not an unreasonable position to take. But I don’t think the Joe Liebermans of the Liberal Party are completely happy with that, nor are the folks who are firmly anti-war, and of course the Conservatives are going to accuse him of equivocating and not taking a clear stance.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: We already saw Dick Gephardt having to step down over Iraq. Do you think there’s something similar unfolding for the Liberals now? Is this a threat to John Kerry’s leadership?\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: The thing is, to the extent that this is a political problem for the Liberals – and I do think it is one – it’s that Kerry does sometimes sound like he’s trying to have it both ways. But with a party this divided, I’m not sure how you solve the problem by changing leaders. If they pick a leader that’s strongly pro-war or anti-war, you really could end up with dozens of MPs in open revolt.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, what if the consensus within the Liberal Party does shift one way or the other and Kerry does step down? Who’s waiting in the wings to replace him?\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: Well, if the party moves towards a more unambiguously pro-war stance, then Joe Lieberman would be the obvious choice. As you said earlier, he’s already the most prominent Liberal hawk, and he served as Foreign Secretary during the brief period when Al Gore took over as Prime Minister from Bill Clinton before the 2000 election. On the anti-war side, I’ve heard a couple of interesting things from the Liberal grassroots lately. One name that people have been talking up is the Premier of Vermont, Howard Dean. He gave a pretty strong anti-war speech three weeks ago, saying specifically that the federal party should take a clear stance against any invasion of Iraq. He’s stepping down this fall after eight years in office, so if he’s looking to make a move to the federal stage, this might be the time.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: He’d be a newcomer to the federal scene. Is there anybody who’s already in parliament who could be that anti-war voice? Any one of those 47 who voted no?\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: I’m not sure about any of them, but I’ve actually heard some talk lately about a movement to “draft” Al Gore back into front-line politics.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: Really!\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: Yeah. He kept a low profile for a while after he resigned from parliament, but he’s been speaking up more lately, particularly against the Bush Government’s drive towards war in Iraq. And of course, many Liberal voters – and Labour voters, for that matter – think that if those five ridings had been counted accurately two years ago, he might still be Prime Minister right now.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: You know, I’ve sometimes had the impression that Al Gore doesn’t actually like politics that much and that he’s been happy to move on from it. Would he really be interested in some sort of comeback?\n\nHOWARD FINEMAN: Probably not yet, but you never say never in politics. It depends how serious the people pushing this idea are and if he feels strongly enough about whatever happens in the near future to want to give it another try.\n\nCHRIS MATTHEWS: Howard Fineman, thanks for your analysis.\n\n[end excerpt]\n\nBackground Notes:\n\nQuestion Time (a common practice in Westminster parliamentary systems) -\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_time\n\nMarch 2003\n\nThe House Comes to Order\n\nExcerpt from “Battlegrounds: The Politics of the Iraq War”\n\nBy Christine Gill, Senior Political Editor, Washington Herald & Telegraph, Copyright 2009\n\nThere is perhaps no event other than the deployment of American troops into combat that brings more of an atmosphere of decorum to the normally raucous House of Commons. Even the most jaded political operators in Columbia would agree that at the very least, the image of being anything less than 100 percent serious about matters of war could be politically fatal. MPs can be solemn and serious, and if something goes wrong, they can perhaps be angry and cutting, but a display of flippancy or obvious opportunism could cost them dearly. Governments must avoid being perceived as having made the decision lightly or as going overboard with rah-rah patriotism when American soldiers are fighting and dying. Opposition parties must give the military their full support and take care not to appear as if somehow hoping for failure or seeking to benefit from it politically.\n\nThese customs held true in the early days of what the Government labeled Operation Iraqi Freedom. When Prime Minister George W. Bush rose to deliver his final military ultimatum to Saddam Hussein’s regime on March 15, 2013, the House sat in respectful silence, with even the most anti-war MPs saving their criticisms for the press gallery afterwards. The invasion began on the 18th, and two days later, Bush and most of his Cabinet dutifully assumed their seats for Question Time. Liberal Party leader John Kerry began his remarks by stating that, “While there have been disagreements leading up to this decision, let me state for the record that the Official Opposition are absolutely united in support for our men and women in uniform,” then went on to ask about the Government’s plans for post-war reconstruction in Iraq.\n\nEven the largely anti-war Labour caucus exercised restraint in voicing their skepticism. Interim leader Nancy Pelosi also said that “while most of us in the Labour Party opposed the decision to go to war, we support our troops 100 percent, and we hope and pray that they accomplish their mission with as little loss of life as possible.” In her second question, she criticized the Government on the failure to pass a United Nations resolution authorizing the invasion, but refrained from the sort of dire warnings of unintended consequences that she had regularly issued in the run-up to the war. Labour Defense critic Carl Levin pressed his counterpart, Defense Minister Donald Rumsfeld, on whether the invasion of Iraq would limit operational capacity in Afghanistan; Rumsfeld insisted that it would not but declined to fire any verbal shots at Levin.\n\nThe most notable clash came when anti-war left-wing MP Paul Wellstone of Minnesota posited to Bush, “Everyone agrees that the fight against terrorism is first and foremost a battle for hearts and minds. One of the biggest obstacles to winning over those hearts and minds is that so many in the Muslim world have come to believe that the United States is waging a war of aggression to assume ownership of Iraq’s oil industry. Can the Prime Minister assure the House that the United States will not, in any way, shape, or form, seek to control or profit from Iraqi oil when this war comes to an end?”\n\nSome mutters of irritation from the Conservative benches were heard as Bush rose to reply, “Mr. Speaker, I have stated many times, but I will be happy to state it again now: the reason we are taking this action is that Saddam Hussein has refused to disarm. The oil supply in Iraq is the property of the Iraqi people, and it’s going to stay that way. I think we’ll win over plenty of hearts and minds when we remove a brutal dictator from power and give Iraq a chance at freedom.”\n\nSeveral minutes later Conservative MP Jeff Sessions of Alabama asked, in reference to Wellstone, “Would the Prime Minister agree with me that if the member for Minneapolis-St. Paul is concerned about terrorist propaganda, he might do well not to repeat it here in the House of Commons while our troops are fighting the War on Terror?” Labour MPs clearly did not appreciate what Sessions was implying – Pelosi glared daggers at Sessions, and veteran Boston-Suffolk MP Ted Kennedy was heard to interject, “He didn’t mean it that way and you know it.”\n\nSpeaker Dennis Hastert called for order as Bush stood at the dispatch box, chuckling awkwardly at first but otherwise refusing to take a swing at the obvious partisan softball, responding, “Well, Mr. Speaker, the member for Minneapolis can ask whatever question he wants. I will simply reiterate that if Iraq did not possess a single drop of oil, we would be making the exact same decision to remove Saddam Hussein from power.”\n\nAsked about the exchange by reporters later, Wellstone stated, “The notion that we’re doing this to get our hands on Iraq’s oil has been circulating for months now. The idea that somehow terrorists wouldn’t hear about it if I didn’t mention it in the House of Commons is frankly pretty far-fetched.” One reporter asked if the question was part of a build-up to a run for the party leadership when the contest began in June; the typically guileless Wellstone responded, “I asked the question because I thought it needed to be asked. There was no reason for it other than that.”\n\nSource for the controversy about Syria in this chapter:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/15/syria.usa\n\nApril 2003\n\nToday Iraq, Tomorrow...Syria?\n\nExcerpt from “Battlegrounds: The Politics of the Iraq War”\n\nBy Christine Gill, Senior Political Editor, Washington Herald & Telegraph, Copyright 2009\n\nThough members of parliament had generally been measured and respectful in debating Iraq, especially after the seeming initial success of the invasion and the quick collapse of the Saddam Hussein regime, the foreign policy fault lines re-emerged in mid-April. On April 14, reports surfaced that Minister of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had directed two of his top deputies, Douglas Feith and Paul Wolfowitz, to work with the MoD’s top civil servants to begin drawing up plans for an invasion of Syria. According to the reports, Rumsfeld’s team had been alarmed at reports that Syrian border security measures were insufficient for preventing Saddam loyalists from smuggling weapons and armor – including, potentially, Iraqi WMD – into Syria, as well as the Syrian regime’s ongoing efforts to develop chemical weapons. Needless to say, anti-war activists were outraged that the Government was even considering another war so soon after invading Iraq.\n\nWhat was even stranger than the seeming hubris of the notion, however, was that Rumsfeld’s team had begun drawing up the plan without informing the Prime Minister. In fact, few within the Government knew what was taking place at MoD until April 11, when Press Secretary Ari Fleischer became aware of the story through his media contacts and brought it to the attention of Bush and his deputy, Finance Minister Dick Cheney (who, despite his domestic portfolio, exercised considerable influence over nearly every aspect of government in his role as Deputy Prime Minister).\n\nBush, who generally gave his Cabinet Ministers considerable leeway and had never pretended to be a policy wonk, was not particularly upset with Rumsfeld for taking this upon himself, but he knew that the political optics were suspect and thought any talk of war with Syria was entirely premature. Cheney, whose thinking had been heavily influenced by an ultra-hawkish group of right-wing think tank members, was less averse to the notion of targeting Syria in theory but also sensed that the politics would make it impossible at the moment. A meeting of Bush’s core foreign policy team – himself, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, and CIA Director R. James Woolsey – was hastily convened to deal with the political fallout.\n\n“Well, we’re going to have to walk this back somehow,” said Bush after Cheney gave a brief overview of what they’d heard from Fleischer.\n\nRumsfeld replied, “I’m prepared to resign, but – and I’m not saying this just to save my job – there are maybe six or seven MPs who could really hit the ground running [as potential successors], and two of them are already in this room [an allusion to Rice and Cheney; Woolsey, as a non-MP, was ineligible]. Anybody else, and practically that means [top MoD civil servant General Richard] Myers runs things while the new guy gets up to speed. ”\n\n“No, Don, you’re not resigning,” said Bush. “You’re a good soldier, and anyway, I’m not shaking up the foreign policy team in the middle of two wars.”\n\n“How about this?” said Cheney. “Don goes back to MoD and tells Doug, Paul, and everybody else that the planning work on Syria stops. It was a hypothetical situation that they were exploring, and the Prime Minister decided that it wasn’t necessary.”\n\nBush nodded. “I think we can make that work.”\n\n“Okay, but I need to tell [Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk] al-Sharaa something,” said Rice. “If the message is that somebody jumped the gun and we’re not seriously considering this, fine. If the message is that they’re on thin ice, I can tell them that too. But where are we going with this?”\n\n“Realistically, Syria doesn’t pose the kind of threat to us that Iraq did,” said Woolsey. “The worst-case scenario, in terms of WMD and using them against U.S. interests, is probably that somebody sells a chemical weapon to a local terrorist group and they use it against Israel. Assad may be a bastard, but he’s not looking for a fight with the United States.”\n\n“Can you press them to tighten up the borders and *then* reassure them that we’re not going to invade?” Bush asked Rice.\n\n“I’m certainly willing to try,” Rice replied. “Are you open to a direct conversation with Assad about this?”\n\n“I’d rather not if I don’t have to,” said Bush. “See where you get with al-Sharaa.”\n\n***\n\nSyrian officials seemed willing to accept the explanation at face value and agreed on several steps towards strengthening the border patrols, but the American domestic opposition wasn’t so generous. The revelations had perhaps united the Labour and Liberal caucuses on foreign policy for the first time since Iraq had come to the forefront. Both John Kerry and Nancy Pelosi denounced the idea of invading Syria and criticized the Government’s disorganization, with Kerry calling on them to release documents showing exactly how many MoD personnel had been diverted to this planning process and for how long. Even top Liberal hawk Joe Lieberman issued a press release stating that “absent any clear and immediate threat, this is the wrong time to be talking about another invasion.”\n\nAlso weighing in was Green Party leader David Cobb, who wasted no time in calling for Rumsfeld’s immediate resignation. Cobb had been promoting his party as the one that could truly be counted on to oppose the Bush Government’s foreign policy as compared to the divided Liberals and the “compromised” Labour Party. He was enough of a pragmatist to understand that an all-out assault on Labour and the Liberals would likely result in mutually assured destruction, but he had hopes of finally leading his party into parliament by targeting a few strongly left-wing ridings, and it was important to stake out their territory and raise his party’s profile.\n\nNot surprisingly, the issue dominated Question Time on April 15. Kerry and Pelosi both challenged the Prime Minister with the sorts of barbs and provocations that they had eschewed ever since the invasion of Iraq began. Kerry dissected the Government’s strained attempts to pass off the incident as just a case of a department exploring a hypothetical that the Prime Minister rejected while also asserting that Bush would exercise more direct oversight in the future. “Is the Government’s rationale essentially that nothing was wrong, but they still won’t ever do this again?” he asked. Bush, for his part, did himself few favors by beginning with the lamentable turn of phrase: “Look, let me be clear about this – I’m the decider.” Opposition MPs roared in derision, and with that one sentence, late-night comics and satirical websites had their material for the next 24 hours. The Daily Show with Jon Stewart would lead off that night’s episode with a graphic of Bush as comic-book superhero, captioned “THE DECIDER!”\n\nWhen Pelosi rose to speak, she sounded genuinely exasperated, asking, “How on earth can any functioning Government be drawing up war plans for the invasion of Syria without the Prime Minister even knowing about it? Is the Ministry of Defense now running our foreign policy?” Pelosi’s question aimed at one of the most persistent concerns of the Bush Government’s critics: that the Prime Minister was so removed from the details of policy-making that he could be talked into almost anything by his Cabinet and his advisers.\n\n“I know that the opposition parties have been out of office for a few years now – maybe they’ve forgotten how Cabinet government works,” Bush began. The comment drew some chuckles from the Conservative benches, but taunting the opposition for being out of power is generally seen as boilerplate Question Time 101. “I place a great deal of trust in all Cabinet Ministers to explore the options and present them to me for final decisions, and that’s what happened here.”\n\nWhen Rumsfeld’s turn at the dispatch box came, he fared little better than his boss, and both Liberal Shadow Defense Minister Ellen Tauscher and Labour Defense Critic Carl Levin forced him into uncharacteristically halting answers. On two occasions, he sought to explain his failure to inform Bush of the war planning process by alluding to how “busy” the Prime Minister was, eliciting some jeers from opposition MPs. Though no knockout blows had been delivered, the general consensus was that the opposition parties were the “winners” of Question Time and that the Government had yet to provide a fully satisfactory explanation of the Syria controversy.\n\nAustralian comedians John Clarke and Bryan Dawe, in the midst of one of their three-month tours of the United States, had Rumsfeld square in their sights two days later when they delivered one of their patented faux-interviews on USBC. The Government’s flailing PR about the Syria war plan, as well as one of Rumsfeld’s more unusual quotes from 2002 and his apparent enjoyment of refusing to answer questions dealing with sensitive information, were given the duo’s usual satirical treatment. A transcript of the segment follows.\n\nCLARKE AND DAWE (USBC) – APRIL 17, 2003\n\nBRYAN DAWE: Defense Minister Donald Rumsfeld, thank you for joining us tonight.\n\nJOHN CLARKE (as Rumsfeld): Thank you Bryan, always happy to be here.\n\nBD: You’ve been in the news quite a bit lately between the invasion of Iraq and this issue of planning for war with Syria –\n\nJC: Yes, Bryan, let me just say before you go any further that people have been overreacting a bit to this issue of Syria. The fact is, as a Cabinet minister, it is my responsibility to plan for a number of contingencies and hypotheticals.\n\nBD: So all of this was just about exploring a hypothetical?\n\nJC: Correct.\n\nBD: But why pursue this particular hypothetical in the middle of two other wars?\n\nJC: Again, Bryan, you must understand the nature of the job. There are things that we know, and there are things that we know that we don’t know, but there are also things that we don’t know that we don’t know – what I call the unknown unknowns. And it’s my responsibility to prepare for all of them.\n\nBD: So you’re saying that the people criticizing you are failing to account for the unknown unknowns?\n\nJC: Exactly.\n\nBD: And what unknown unknowns do you think they’re overlooking?\n\nJC: Well, I don’t know, Bryan. That’s why they’re unknown unknowns. If I knew what they were, they’d be known unknowns.\n\nBD: Do you understand, though, why someone might find “unknown unknowns” to be an insufficient reason for going to war?\n\nJC: It would depend what the unknown unknowns are.\n\nBD: The same unknown unknowns that you yourself can’t identify because they’re unknown?\n\nJC: Of course. What other unknown unknowns would they be?\n\nBD: Now, another issue is that you apparently got pretty far along in this process without informing the Prime Minister. Why didn’t you tell the Prime Minister sooner?\n\nJC: Bryan, the Prime Minister is a very busy man. He’s got Iraq and Afghanistan to deal with, he’s got domestic issues that need his attention. If every single Cabinet minister insisted on sharing every single idea they’ve had, he’d barely have time to ignore his policy briefings.\n\nBD: I’m sorry – did you just say that the Prime Minister ignores his policy briefings?\n\nJC: That’s classified, Bryan.\n\nBD: Your own words from ten seconds ago are classified?\n\nJC: I’ve explained this to the media many times – when a question deals with sensitive information regarding operational security or intelligence, I cannot and will not discuss it in public.\n\nBD: But all I asked was that you repeat what you already said. If that’s classified, then haven’t you already discussed classified information in public?\n\nJC: That's also classified.\n\nBD: All right. At the very least, can you put everyone’s minds at ease and reassure us that the United States will not, in fact, be invading Syria any time soon?\n\nJC: I’m perfectly happy to put that one to rest. As I said, this planning process was simply about considering all the hypotheticals. This Government has no intention of invading Syria as things stand.\n\nBD: Well, that’s good to hear. So have you asked the civil servants in the MoD to draw up war plans against any other countries that you have no intention of invading?\n\nJC: Of course not.\n\nBD: Really? Why not?\n\nJC: Well, they’re very busy, Bryan.\n\nBD: I see. Too busy to do things like draw up war plans that you don’t actually intend to use?\n\nJC: Quite right.\n\nBD: Defense Minister Donald Rumsfeld, thanks for your time.\n\nEXCERPT FROM:\n\nCOUNTDOWN WITH KEITH OLBERMANN (MSNBC) – MAY 5, 2003\n\nINTRODUCTORY SEGMENT\n\n[Opening titles display]\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: Which of these stories will you be talking about tomorrow?\n\n[CLIP 1: Defense Minister Donald Rumsfeld in the House of Commons]\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: (voice over) The Minister of Defense making a surprisingly definitive announcement about Afghanistan in the House of Commons….\n\nDONALD RUMSFELD: It is our expectation that, from this day forward, the armed forces of the United States will no longer be called upon to carry out large-scale combat missions in the nation of Afghanistan, and that our role and that of our coalition partners will be primarily that of peacekeeping, training of Afghan units, and organizing reconstruction efforts.\n\n[CLIP 2: Prime Minister George W. Bush speaking on board the USS Woodrow Wilson, with a banner reading “Mission Accomplished” in the background]\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: (voice over) The Prime Minister making a similar announcement about Iraq, this one in a setting very much unlike the House of Commons….\n\nPRIME MINISTER GEORGE W. BUSH: Thanks to the efforts of the brave men and women standing here today, and those of countless others in uniform, I am pleased to say that major American combat operations in Iraq have come to an end.\n\n[CLIP 3: Labour MP Joe Biden speaking to an interviewer outside the House of Commons]\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: (voice over) Some criticism of the Government’s foreign policy – from a prominent Labour MP who supported the authorization to go to war….\n\nJOE BIDEN: I think it is irresponsible for the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister to be speaking in these terms right now. We are very, very far from the end of the road, both in Iraq and in Afghanistan.\n\n[CLIP 4: Conservative MP George Voinovich speaking to interviewer Chris Wallace]\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: (voice over) Possible trouble ahead for the Government’s planned tax cuts as one Conservative MP says he cannot vote for the package as it stands….\n\nGEORGE VOINOVICH: I informed the Chief Whip yesterday that I would not be voting for the tax cut bill in second reading if the estimated cost is above 350 billion dollars. So far, I have not been given any indication that the Government is planning to offer an amendment.\n\n[CLIP 5: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani speaking at a press conference]\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: (voice over) And finally, a move to federal politics for Rudy Giuliani….\n\nRUDY GIULIANI: Today I informed the chair of the Conservative Party riding association for the seat of Staten Island and Brooklyn Southwest that I will be submitting nomination papers for the next federal election. It would be my privilege to continue to serve the people of New York City in this seat.\n\n[END CLIPS]\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: Our #5 story tonight, Labour MP Joe Biden – who served as Justice Minister under the Clinton Government and as Labour critic for Foreign Affairs under Dick Gephardt – today had some pointed words regarding the announcements by Prime Minister Bush and Defense Minister Rumsfeld that major U.S. combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are, essentially, over. You may remember that Mr. Biden was one of 11 Labour MPs that voted in favor of giving the government authority to go to war in Iraq, and he has been sitting on his party’s backbench ever since Dick Gephardt resigned as leader. Asked for a response to Mr. Biden’s comments, the Deputy Prime Minister had this to say.\n\n[BEGIN CLIP: Deputy Prime Minister Dick Cheney speaking in the lobby of the House of Commons]\n\nDICK CHENEY: Well, I heard about Mr. Biden’s comments. All I can say is that if he thinks we’re somehow not being aggressive *enough* in Afghanistan and Iraq, he’s certainly pretty far afield from the rest of his party.\n\n[END CLIP]\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: Mr. Biden is with us from Columbia now to discuss his comments and the government’s response. Mr. Biden, thank you for joining us.\n\n[Biden appears via splitscreen]\n\nJOE BIDEN: Glad to be here, Keith.\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: You heard what the Deputy Prime Minister had to say about your criticisms today – your thoughts?\n\nJOE BIDEN: Well, look, this sort of back-and-forth political point-scoring isn’t what’s important right now. What’s important is that there’s still a lot to be done in both countries. Just last week in Afghanistan, in Zabul province in the southeast, 15 Afghan government troops were killed in combat with rebel fighters. There are hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers who have stopped fighting and, I guess, most of them have gone home, but what’s the plan for them now? Who’s going to be responsible for all their armor and weaponry? I mean, it’s been less than a month since Baghdad was captured. And to be sending this kind of message that most of the hard work is over is just not the responsible thing to do right now.\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: So, to be clear, is your argument with the substance of what the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister said, or more with the timing and the possible unintended message?\n\nJOE BIDEN: It’s both. The reality is that you need the political support back home for efforts like this to be successful. And unfortunately, we probably have not seen the last of American combat casualties in Afghanistan or Iraq, which means that the Government is going to have to explain why our troops are still risking their lives every day when they’ve told people that major combat operations are over. And second, take the attacks in Afghanistan last week that I mentioned. Does anyone think that if we start seeing things like that all the time, our troops won’t end up engaging in combat? We’re just going to sit back and let the Afghans do it?\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: Now, I’m rarely one to take up Dick Cheney’s cause, but are you, in fact, suggesting that somehow the U.S. military needs to be taking more aggressive tactics, either in Iraq or in Afghanistan?\n\nJOE BIDEN: I hope we don’t have to. Listen, I – my own son serves in the military. He could end up deployed to Iraq any day. So I get it. I understand what this is like for parents and military families all over this country. But ask any military family and they’ll tell you they don’t want sugar-coated happy talk – they want to know what are the risks that their loved ones will be facing and why. All I’m saying is, don’t go parsing things like “major combat operations,” as if there’s any such thing as a “minor” combat operation, and tell us the truth, that we have to win the peace in Iraq and Afghanistan and that some tough times are still ahead of us.\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: Obviously, any commentary on Iraq inevitably ends up being seen through the lens of politics. What would you say to those who will suggest that this is really about you putting some political distance between yourself and the Conservative Government in preparation for a Labour Party leadership campaign?\n\nJOE BIDEN: No, that’s got nothing to do with it. First of all, I haven’t decided whether I’m running or not. But in any case, the real policy question for the next Prime Minister isn’t going to be about whether we should have invaded Iraq or not – that decision’s been made and now we have to deal with it. The question is how are we going to stabilize the situation in a way that makes us safe and secure, that does right by the Iraqi people, and that achieves the goals of the War on Terror. Look, I want us to be successful in Iraq. This isn't about taking shots at the Government, this is about what’s best for America.\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: Joe Biden, thanks for your time.\n\nJOE BIDEN: Thank you, Keith.\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: We’ll turn now to NBC military analyst, Retired General Barry McCaffrey, and CNBC political writer John Harwood to discuss what we just heard. General, do you think that Joe Biden has a point here about setting the right expectations for the near future in Iraq and Afghanistan?\n\nBARRY MCCAFFREY : I think he’s right about a couple of things. One is that the local Afghan forces aren’t yet ready to take on all the toughest missions when it comes to going after Taliban remnants and other Al-Qaeda sympathizers. They’re still going to need the support of the U.S. forces and the other coalition troops for a while yet. The other is that any long-term security plan for Iraq has to include provisions for the standing army, even if it’s basically non-operational right now. I’m not sure I’d have phrased it as starkly as Mr. Biden did, but I can understand where he's coming from.\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: Would you imagine some of your former colleagues who are still in the active military might have been cringing a bit at the Prime Minister’s rhetoric today?\n\nBARRY MCCAFFREY : Well, Keith, the responsibility of every active-duty officer is to carry out their orders in coordination with the Ministry of Defense. It’s not their place to be criticizing the civilian government, so I’m certainly not going to speak for them, especially when they’re commanding our men and women on the ground in Iraq. I would just say that any Government that takes the nation to war should be clear and realistic about what that means, both for the members of the military and for the American public at large.\n\nKEITH OLBERMANN: John, what about the political side to this? Was that the opening salvo of the Biden Labour leadership campaign?\n\nJOHN HARWOOD: I don’t know if it was or it wasn’t, but I do think it was a preview of the sort of rhetoric we might hear if Joe Biden, or one of the other Labour MPs who voted to authorize the war, ends up running for the leadership. That is, the decision to go to war is over with, and now we have to concentrate on stabilizing Iraq instead of re-litigating the vote from last year. But don’t forget that it’s been less than a year since Dick Gephardt quit because he didn’t think it was viable for Labour to have a pro-war leader, and if anything, the opposition to the war has grown even stronger among the party’s grassroots.\n\n[END EXCERPT]"
