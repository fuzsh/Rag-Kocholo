        "text": "1\n\nTHE ASSIGNMENT\n\nIentered my office in the headquarters of the Egyptian permanent mission to the United Nations at 344 East 44th Street in New York at 3:45 p.m. on Friday, July 9, 2004. In less than five minutes, the phone started ringing and my Nigerian secretary, Stella, said, This call is for you from Cairo. She told me the name of the caller—someone who was part of the inner circle of the president’s staff. He said that he was making the call from the Heliopolis Sheraton hotel, not from his home or office, because he did not want anyone to know about it at present. I had been selected as the minister of foreign affairs in a new cabinet in Egypt that would be announced within days. He added that I should not talk about it to anyone and that I would get a phone call from the prime minister-designate about this position. I thanked him for the news and for his enthusiasm about it.\n\nThe previous night, at dawn on Thursday, July 8, a well-connected former ambassador in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who was on good terms with various members of the Egyptian elite had called my New York apartment to relay the same news. He said that he was certain that the decision had already been made about my appointment as minister of foreign affairs and successor to my lifelong friend Ahmed Maher. Maher had already succeeded our friend Amr Moussa on May 15, 2001, when the latter was elected as secretary general of the League of Arab States, replacing Dr. Esmat Abdel Meguid, who had held that position for ten years during which Amr Moussa had been the foreign affairs minister.\n\nI kept thinking about the calls and began to think that the news might be true. I had been told that since Amr Moussa left the ministry in 2001, President Mubarak had been thinking about some names and that mine was at the top of his list. Even more, just after the announcement that Egypt intended to nominate Moussa as secretary general of the Arab League, the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat reported from London in the middle of April 2001 that Aboul Gheit is the candidate most likely to get the position. However, I thought that the president might choose someone else closer to him since he did not know me really well. Until then, I had met the president personally only twice throughout my service as a diplomat. The first time was during his visit to Italy in November 1994 when I was the Egyptian ambassador there. The Italian authorities had decided then that it was dangerous for him to stay in a hotel in Rome because they had intercepted suspicious phone calls during that period when Egypt was confronting serious terrorist threats. Thus, the president spent his night at the Villa Savoya—the headquarters of the Egyptian Embassy—where Italian monarchs had lived during and before the Second World War, and where the Italian Carabinieri had arrested Mussolini during his visit to the king of Italy, to discuss the progress of the war and the possibility of the withdrawal of Italy to save itself a crushing defeat. The president’s visit was a success, and later, one of the inner circle of the president’s officials told me in a phone call that the president liked the warm hospitality and expressed his satisfaction, commenting on my wife and myself as a really exceptional and excellent couple. The second time I met the president was before I left to New York as the permanent representative of Egypt to the United Nations in 1999; it was in the Heliopolis Presidential Palace and lasted for twenty minutes in the presence of Amr Moussa, the minister of foreign affairs at the time.\n\nSince 1989, I had heard from high-profile friends in the government that the president kept asking about personnel in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who could be promoted. They often mentioned my name and he would answer that he was sure about my good reputation and wide experience, in addition to the fact that my father was one of his acquaintances and they had served together in the air force. However, he would sometimes add, Isn’t he a bit young for the position? I found President Mubarak’s age-sensitivity when it came to decisions about promotions and assigning positions strange; seniority clearly meant a great deal to him.\n\nWhen President Mubarak asked Dr. Esmat Abdel Meguid about someone to replace Ambassador Amr Moussa, the permanent Egyptian representative, upon the latter’s return from New York in April 1991, Abdel Meguid suggested my name. Again, the president’s response was that he found Aboul Gheit young for the position, although I was forty-nine years old at the time! I found this attitude extremely provocative, and I was even more vexed and exasperated after Amr Moussa was assigned to succeed Esmat Abdel Meguid as minister of foreign affairs and Moussa’s recommendation to the president to extend the service of a group of Egyptian ambassadors for years beyond their normal retirement age. I firmly believed that extending their service, even though I never doubted their efficiency or denied their competence, denied opportunities for many high-caliber people that my friend and colleague Dr. Mustafa al-Fiqi called the generation of the mezzanine floor (that is, the lost generation). I had already decided never to follow that path myself, and I assured the president, when I became foreign affairs minister, that I had no intention or desire to approach him in the future with a recommendation to extend the service of any ambassador, whether inside Egypt or abroad, beyond the retirement age. In fact, there had been attempts in the years following my appointment that I firmly resisted. The president’s wife had tried to extend the service of some of the women ambassadors beyond the retirement age and I refused; the president was supportive, despite the pressures I believe he had felt from his family.\n\nThe first six months of 2004 were rife with many of the usual rumors about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, among which was that Ahmed Maher would not continue for long at the helm of Egyptian diplomacy, especially after his visit to Jerusalem, which was not a success. Some Palestinians allied to an extremist organization gathered and protested against his visit to the al-Aqsa Mosque in a repugnant manner that displayed their ingratitude for Egypt’s efforts and sacrifices on behalf of the Palestinian cause and its support of the Palestinian people to claim their rights in Palestine generally, and particularly in Jerusalem, for decades. These rumors spread widely after Ahmed Maher suffered from a severe illness in 2004 that caused him to be rushed to a hospital in Cairo; he was thus unable to accompany the president on a visit to America.\n\nMaher had actually suffered two major health crises. The first was in 1983 when he was the Egyptian ambassador to Belgium and the European Community in Brussels; the second happened in 1993 when he was ambassador to Washington. In both cases, he underwent major heart surgeries that required him to remain under close medical supervision. However, he had always found ways to dodge doctors’ instructions and escape the supervision of his wife in her continuous attempts to make him follow those instructions by supervising his meals and activity.\n\nDuring the years 2002–2003, when I was the permanent representative in New York, Ahmed Maher, the-then minister of foreign affairs, visited many times and seized the opportunity to undergo some medical checkups in the main hospital of Cornell University. Most of his tests were concerning, and I often asked the Egyptian physician not to talk about them to anyone to keep his image intact. I did not know then whether Maher himself had told anyone in Cairo about the results of his tests or not, but I was sure that some official and personal reports were sent to Cairo, whether to the president’s office or to some other Egyptian government agencies. I was also aware that when President Mubarak chose Ahmed Maher to succeed Amr Moussa, he was worried that his responsibilities would indirectly affect his already vulnerable health. Nevertheless, the president preferred to choose someone known for his efficiency, and whom he had known well for many years during his work in Washington from 1992 to 1999 and in Moscow from 1988 to 1992.\n\nReturning to the subject of my nomination to the position: I have always believed that the Egyptian permanent representative to the United Nations, whether personally known to the president or with no direct relation to him—as in my case—was invariably one of the candidates for the position of foreign affairs minister in case unexpected changes happened at the head of this ministry. There had been many instances of this kind, starting with Dr. Mahmoud Fawzi in 1953 and followed by Mahmoud Riyad in 1964, Mohamed Hassan al-Zayyat in 1969, and Dr. Esmat Abdel Meguid in 1984, who was succeeded by Amr Moussa in 1991. Therefore, I believed that there was really a strong possibility of my appointment to that position.\n\nPresident Mubarak came back to Cairo a few days before July 10 after undergoing major spine surgery and staying in Germany for some weeks. It was then rumored that a major cabinet reshuffle was expected in Cairo shortly. On July 8, an editorial by Ibrahim Nafie was published in al-Ahram in which he severely criticized the policies of the Egyptian government and the performance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This led me to conclude that there was a serious possibility that the minister of foreign affairs would be replaced.\n\nI monitored the matter closely, not only because I was a potential candidate for the position, but also because I did not wish to serve under a minister who was either younger than myself or whom I outranked in the diplomatic corps. Therefore, I had to be prepared to go back to Cairo and enjoy a relaxed life after thirty-nine years of hard work during which I devotedly served my country’s diplomacy. I was then sixty-two years old and had already received three presidential decrees to extend my service beyond the retirement age, each decree granting one additional year.\n\nWhat I felt that day, July 9, was a sense of anticipation. I decided to call my wife, Laila, via the direct connection between my office and the residence of the Egyptian ambassador on Park Avenue. I told her about the phone call I had received from one of the members of the president’s office, and of course she already knew about the earlier call from the retired Egyptian ambassador. She cried and said that she did not want me to take this position because of its overwhelming responsibilities that would take me away from her for however long I served in that post. She also said that the years of our lives had gone by far too quickly and that we were not getting the chance to rest, relax, and enjoy each other’s company. I replied that if what I had been told about my imminent appointment was true, I could not refuse the president’s trust, since neither my personality, work ethics, nor training as an Egyptian diplomat allowed me to do so. I assured her that I was absolutely convinced that men must accept responsibilities and never run away from them, especially if they are sufficiently qualified. I firmly believe that this philosophy governs the conduct of all diplomats and other high-profile officials when they receive a request from their president to perform a certain task, whether big or small. I was following Al Jazeera television while talking to my wife and suddenly I saw my photograph and name on the screen, together with the news that I was to be the next Egyptian minister of foreign affairs.\n\nPhone calls poured into the headquarters of the delegation from colleagues in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our embassies abroad, and my family in Cairo. I decided to leave the building and go out with one of the young members of the delegation, the well-qualified Mohamed al-Farnawany. We leisurely strolled through New York’s streets for hours, looking at shop windows and entering bookstores. I arrived home in the evening to find that my wife had disconnected most of the phones in the apartment, especially since it was just after dawn in Cairo and no one was expected to call. She said she had received dozens of calls, and that was just a sample of how our future life would look.\n\nIt might be relevant here to narrate a funny story that happened to one of the diplomats in our delegation, Counselor Mahmoud Sami. I accompanied him one Friday from the office to my apartment to discuss some matters and have a light lunch, then go back. It was a hot and humid day and we walked about three kilometers; when we arrived, he was soaking with sweat and in bad shape. We finished talking and had lunch, then I showered quickly and we were all set to go back. When I suggested that we go on foot, he firmly refused and said that he never refused any of my requests but he could not stand walking in the heat and humidity. I started teasing and threatening him, and he said that he knew that I would most probably be the minister of foreign affairs within days or even hours, but he would not walk in the heat no matter what happened. So he went back in my car and I walked to the office. As soon as he heard the news on Al Jazeera, he came to tease me, suggesting that, now that I had become foreign minister, he was prepared to walk back and forth from my home to the mission many times and make it a daily routine, and we laughed.\n\nI tried to sleep that night but slept only fitfully. On July 10, 2004, I received a phone call at 6:00 a.m. from the Cabinet switchboard in Cairo and was told that Dr. Ahmed Nazif wanted to talk to me; then General Abu Talib, Dr. Nazif’s chief of cabinet at the Ministry of Communication, also said that Dr. Nazif wanted to speak to me. I waited on the line for a couple of minutes and did not hear anyone so I hung up. The Cabinet headquarters called again and Dr. Nazif was on the line; he courteously said that he still remembered his last successful visit to New York the previous year when he came on an official mission related to the Ministry of Communication. He said that he was calling to deliver the president’s appeal for me to accept the position of the minister of foreign affairs in the next cabinet. I was surprised by his cordial style in handling the subject. I thanked him and asked him to thank the president for his trust. He said that I was expected to arrive in Cairo before Sunday noon for the swearing-in, which was expected to be on Monday, July 12. I jokingly commented that the position had already started to weigh heavily on me and that I would spare no effort to leave New York on Saturday, July 10.\n\nI requested a farewell meeting with all the members of the delegation and wrote a short note to the secretary general of the United Nations, apologizing for my unexpected departure. I also prepared a memorandum to be sent to the ambassadors of all countries, notifying them of the circumstances of my departure, as was the customary method of diplomatic communication in such cases. While my wife was packing my summer clothes, I got ready to travel via the EgyptAir flight leaving for Cairo at 10:00 p.m.\n\nWe agreed that my wife would stay in New York for a few weeks to tend to our personal belongings before coming back to Cairo. This created a small problem: my son’s fiancée was expected to arrive in New York with her sister on the same day I was to leave. Thus we met at the airport; she arrived and I left. To give my wife her due, I must admit that I have always burdened her with a lot of responsibilities, or to be exact, all familial responsibilities. For the thirty-six years of our marriage up to 2004, she raised and nurtured our children, Kamal and Ali, and supervised their education. My sole duty has been to work, and I am sure that had it not been for her constant support, I would not have achieved the success I did in my professional career.\n\nThe EgyptAir flight took off on time, and though I was very exhausted, I could not get a wink of sleep. I recalled many of the stages in my professional career, and how things developed from June 1, 1965, the day I joined the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Ministry, to the day I left New York to go home to be the foreign affairs minister. I also thought about the coming mission and the great responsibilities it entailed. Egypt is a big country with major status, significant responsibilities, and an important role in the Middle East, Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Red Sea. Furthermore, Egypt has a visible presence in all global policy circles, especially at the United Nations and its various specialized agencies, and is actively engaged in discussions on a wide range of issues. Egypt has shouldered many responsibilities and still does, especially when it comes to dealing with the Arab–Israeli conflict, both during the armed confrontation period and in the quest for a peaceful settlement, as we have witnessed since Sadat’s visit to Jerusalem in November 1977.\n\nBased on my reading of Egypt’s history and its role in international developments over the last two hundred years, I was deeply convinced that Egypt has great international importance, not only because of its geographical location, but also because of the vitality and vigor of its people under any visionary and effective leadership. This was the source of Egypt’s ability to influence its vital sphere and the wider interests of many superpowers whenever it got the chance. As an Islamic country, Egypt’s magnitude attracts the attention of millions of Muslims. As an Arab country, Egypt has been at the forefront of defending an Islamic and Arab region, which was for centuries subjected to violent attacks from the Christian west, including the Crusades, the appearance of the Portuguese in the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf in the sixteenth century, the fleets of Venice and Genoa in the Mediterranean at the end of the Mamluk era, and until the beginning of the Ottoman dominance. Egyptian leaders and rulers have always been required to lead its foreign policy and protect its security and interests in the midst of incessant competition between the great powers, which always projected their power and exercised their influence in the region.\n\nWhen Mamluk Egypt came under the control of the Ottoman Empire for several centuries, efforts were made, from time to time, to escape this dependency within the limits of the circumstances prevailing at that time. For centuries, the rulers of Egypt made more than one attempt to achieve a degree of independence, and then to influence developments in its immediate surroundings, especially in the Mediterranean. Ali Bey al-Kabir, for example, attempted to escape the complete dominance of the Ottoman Empire and allied himself with Russia in order to exert pressure on the Ottomans. Another example is Muhammad Ali Pasha’s conflict with the Ottoman Empire and his rapprochement with France. Then came Gamal Abd al-Nasser and the revolution of 1952, thwarting the plans of the western powers—the United States and the Anglo-Saxon allies—and getting closer to the Soviet Union.\n\nAll these ambitious attempts on the part of the rulers of Egypt to expand its external influence and regional clout failed. Despite the initial success of leaders such as Ali Bey al-Kabir, Muhammad Ali Pasha, and finally Gamal Abd al-Nasser in expanding Egyptian geopolitical influence into areas such as the Arabian Peninsula, the Red Sea and its southern approaches from the Horn of Africa and the Eritrean lands, and as far as the headwaters of the Nile, these leaders ultimately failed to ensure sustained Egyptian influence over these areas.\n\nTracing Egyptian diplomacy over a period of two hundred years from 1775 to 1975, I came to the conclusion that in its attempt to achieve its goals, Egypt leveraged the global balance of power and the interests of the great powers to serve its own interests. Ali Bey al-Kabir took advantage of Tsarist Russia’s ambitions in the Mediterranean and its desire to gain access to warm waters and control the Black Sea straits to help Egypt escape Ottoman domination. However, this attempt, which entailed a great deal of Egyptian effort, failed for several reasons, the most important of which was the interference of the greatest navy in the world at that time—that of the British Empire. One more possible reason for the failure of Egypt’s efforts was its early extension beyond its own borders, which revealed its intentions prematurely before it could build up its internal front.\n\nMuhammad Ali Pasha, on the other hand, took the Egyptian project further by strongly aligning himself with France. Neither this alliance nor that of Ali Bey al-Kabir with Russia can be discussed in detail here. Both France and Russia were major land powers competing with the greatest naval power of the age, Britain. However, these experiences provide valuable strategic lessons that should be instructive to Egyptian decision-makers today in finding and securing a vital role for Egypt in nearby regions or those under its strategic, cultural, religious, and political influence.\n\nThe British naval forces challenged Muhammad Ali Pasha’s project and defeated it. As a consequence, Egypt was subjected to British colonization for more than eighty years. As Gamal Abd al-Nasser sought to articulate a role for Egypt in combating imperialism and the receding colonizing forces, together with the burden of the Arab confrontation against Israel which was led by Egypt, he had to gradually get closer to the Soviet Union, the heir of Tsarist Russia. The Nasserist project was thwarted in turn by the greatest naval force of the time, namely that of the United States, during the Cold War. I have tried to study and evaluate these experiences, and I have often asked myself: Why didn’t the Egyptians and their rulers try to support their ambitious projects through a more profound study and a thorough understanding of international developments and conditions? Why did they not understand the influence of the strategic concepts and principles of Admiral Mahan on the impact and importance of sea power, which disproved the views of Professor Halford Mackinder, who argued that land power and the control of the Eurasian heartland were the keys to global power? Why did they not notice that sea powers, especially in the modern age, have the greatest influence? These questions led to another question: Why did not we seek to ally ourselves with these global sea powers at the beginning of all of our geopolitical projects, and come to an understanding about their objectives and ambitions in relation to ours?\n\nAll these philosophical questions weighed heavily on my thoughts and the way I evaluated Egypt’s circumstances over the previous decades, especially since June 5, 1967, when the Egyptian–Russian coalition was dealt a heavy blow. Though I knew that answering these questions was hard and complicated, I could not get them out of my mind for decades. I sometimes asked myself an even tougher question: Why did we repeatedly join allies that led to our defeat? We offered naval support to the Persians against the cities of Greece in ancient times; we fought with Hannibal and the Carthage fleets against Rome; we allied with Venice against Portugal in the war of the Indian Ocean and in the Battle of Dewey near Bombay.\n\nAs I reflected on Egypt’s history and its past political experiences, I became convinced that geography played a central role in determining our actions. In addition, cultural imperatives also affected our policy choices and shaped our political destiny. These are complex historical and philosophical questions that require deep reflection and discussion. When I consider these questions today, I am seeking to encourage people to think deeply about the requirements and tenets of Egyptian foreign policy, based on its deeply rooted and extended history and exceptional geographical location. I believe that Gamal Hemdan’s encyclopedic work is a must-read for any Egyptian official in the position of making decisions or administering Egypt’s foreign policy, as it explains so clearly how history and geography influence Egypt’s status and foreign policy.\n\nI have often reflected on the philosophy of President Sadat and his posture toward the United States, the greatest naval power of the twentieth century. I felt that Sadat’s policies echoed my own convictions about our foreign policy. Consequently, I have always been preoccupied with the way we should deal with the United States as the leader of the Christian, western world with absolute power to influence world policies and control countries and societies since the collapse of the Soviet Union, which used to be a safety net for many of our countries. The withdrawal of the Soviet role led to an overwhelming emergence of the United States and its unrivaled dominance over international affairs. Unfortunately, the United States exhibited a degree of prejudice against Islam and engaged in an extended confrontation with certain political and cultural currents in the Muslim world, causing serious harm to Muslim societies.\n\nDuring the ten-hour flight to Cairo, my mind kept wandering through many of my deeply rooted convictions about Egyptian foreign policy. I thought about Egypt and the way it viewed the region and its role within it. Egypt has been a major Islamic power ever since it successfully confronted the Crusaders, the Christian western invasions of the region, and the attack of the Tatars on the Middle East. The Battle of Hittin of 1187, during which Saladin defeated the invading Crusaders, and the Battle of Ain Jalut of 1260, where Egypt vanquished the Mongul hordes, are unforgettable and illustrious marks in the consciousness and history of Islamic Egypt. But what about today, in a world of divided Islamic countries and western hegemony? On the one hand, there is Shi‘i Iran, and on the other, there is Sunni Turkey with its Ottoman history; what should we do about both of them? These are the twin Islamic powers that have historically combated one another for dominance and influence over the region. Their mutual antipathy has lasted for some six hundred years and the history of their conflict remains vivid in memory. The invasions of Tamerlane and his destruction of Islamic civilization in the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Iran is a tale to be told for generations, as is the conflict between Shah Abbas of the Safavid Empire and Sultan Selim I of the Ottoman Empire. Finally, there is the Ottoman invasion of Syria and Egypt and the destruction of the Mamluk Sultanate, whose leaders, although Muslim, belonged to Iranian, Turkish, Azeri, and Central Asian ethnic groups. The history of the Muslim region is one of continuous internal conflicts. The challenge is how to change this sad reality into one of cooperation and mutual support in defense of the Islamic region in this era of western aggression and domination.\n\nI have been preoccupied by these thoughts ever since the shock of the defeat of Egypt and the Arabs in 1967. I was searching for a true Islamic coalition but I was unfortunately led to the sad conclusion that such a coalition is an unachievable dream. How can it be achieved when relations between Iran and Turkey have always been marked by considerable animosity? When Egypt is preoccupied by a sense of responsibility to defend the region, including addressing security threats from Israel and ensuring the security of the Gulf area? When Turkey is solely driven by its economic and commercial interests, especially after the emergence of its economy and its need for markets? Moreover, Turkey insisted on building a relationship with the west and joined NATO, which made NATO an immediate neighbor of the Arab world in Iraq and Syria. All of these elements would leave their imprint on Egypt and its foreign policy.\n\nI was of the opinion that we should spare no effort to build up a framework of cooperation among Egypt, Turkey, and Iran in order to establish security for the whole region and help to balance the influence of Israel and its relation to the west, thus fortifying the Islamic world’s resistance capabilities. But can we succeed in achieving this goal? Would revolutionary Shi‘i Iran agree to reach an understanding with both Egypt and Turkey? How far would Turkey be willing to go in order to build such a relationship without harming its essential interests with the western world, NATO, and Europe? All these questions need to be answered.\n\nDuring the time of Sadat, Egypt took an opposite direction in dealing with Saudi Arabia from the one Gamal Abd al-Nasser had followed. Egyptian–Saudi cooperation after the defeat of 1967 contributed to restoring a degree of stability in the region, especially after the end of the conflict with Israel. However, the growth of Saudi economic and financial capabilities over the past forty years and the expected continuous development of the Saudi status in the coming decades on the one hand, and the continuing deterioration of Egypt’s economic capabilities over the same period on the other, undoubtedly affected Egypt’s willingness to accept a partner with such a big influence on the destiny of the region. As soon as I took up my position as minister of foreign affairs, I sensed the difficulty of this situation. I came to realize that the Egyptian–Saudi relationship is truly profound; it transcends the religious ties that shape the views of Egyptians about the Hijaz region.\n\nWithin this context, I monitored the financial and economic assistance that Saudis use in order to influence many Egyptian positions and decisions. This came in the form of financial deposits during Egypt’s times of need, or as grants, at Egypt’s request, in the form of wheat purchases worth hundreds of millions of dollars to cover Egypt’s annual wheat requirements. I soon found out that Saudi Arabia’s views are very influential in Egypt, especially because the support it offers comes not only from within the kingdom itself, but from the Emirates, Kuwait, and other countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as well.\n\nAfter the defeat of 1967, Gamal Abd al-Nasser asked for the financial and economic support of Saudi Arabia and ended the Egyptian presence in Yemen by an almost complete withdrawal. Egypt had its eye on the Saudi–Iranian rivalry at the time, and it was believed that building new bridges with the Saudis or mending the old ones was more beneficial to Egypt than cooperating with revolutionary Iran. For my part, I felt the need for answers to these complex questions based on political and economic realities.\n\nIraq had been attacked the previous year—2003—and Syria was now under threats and pressures. Iraq was, of course, lost the day it invaded Kuwait, on August 2, 1990. The Egyptian–Syrian axis did not endure for long in its attempt to support the GCC, nor did the Damascus Declaration, despite the fact that this declaration and the states that adopted it could have succeeded in restoring the region’s ability to forge its own future in a period of conflict between Iran and the Arab region. It could also have helped to confront any attempt to penetrate the region by western powers. There remained one additional question: What could be done about Israel, which continued to expand into Palestinian lands and extinguish the aspirations of the Palestinians? How could we address the tragic situation of the Chairman of the Palestinian National Authority, Yasser Arafat, who was isolated and besieged in his headquarters in Ramallah, without any serious support from any Arab, Islamic, or international power? It was always possible to make dramatic announcements but, as we witnessed in previous eras, this was no longer possible nor constructive in confronting the aggression of Israel.\n\nMy thoughts wandered away from the Middle East, conflicting Islamic viewpoints, and the relations between Islam and the west, to the arena I was leaving at the time, that is, the United Nations, of which I had a deep knowledge and understanding. I believed that Egypt has had a real presence and continuous influence in this international arena for several decades, perhaps since the breakout of the 1948 war and certainly since the organization had become occupied with the Middle East because of the birth of the State of Israel. But there were new elements to be considered in 2004: the probability that other major world powers like Germany and Japan—powers that regained influence after their defeat in the Second World War in 1945—would seek to gain permanent membership in the Security Council. This, of course, would lead to substantial changes in the mapping of power relations in the United Nations and consequently leave its mark on the world in the twenty-first century. I concentrated on figuring out ways to protect our interests, to deal with India and Brazil and other countries that sought to introduce themselves into this international arena, and to consider the question of African representation on an enlarged Security Council.\n\nIt was no secret that Egypt had a great influence in Africa during the period extending from the consolidation of Nasser’s rule in Egypt in 1955 until his confrontation with western powers and his ultimate defeat in 1967 at the hands of Israel. As a result of that defeat, Egypt began to retrench and reduce the extent of its commitment to supporting Africa against western interests, including by supporting revolutions against colonialism and the western imperial powers in Africa.\n\nFor decades, various African powers ascended or descended. Algeria, Ghana, and Nigeria, in particular, were considered favorably until the rise of South Africa in the mid-1990s, after the fall of the apartheid regime. At that point, Nigeria and South Africa were regarded as the best candidates to represent Africa in the UN Security Council: South Africa because of the strong emergence of democracy, and Nigeria because of its attempts to reach an acceptable democratic form of rule in such a large and diverse country. The Arab–African dimension, on the other hand, faded away out of the sight of the west, or perhaps was ignored, either because of western hostility to Islam or the fear of the possible appearance of extremist Islamic powers that might have a negative influence on the United Nations arena.\n\nI believed that this matter should be one of the top priorities on the Egyptian foreign affairs agenda in the future. I was sure, however, that Egypt’s economic power and its ability to serve the aims of Egyptian foreign policy was the main element in determining its success or failure to influence not only the region but Africa as well. With this economic strength established, a strong and influential image of Egypt would be guaranteed on the international level.\n\nInternational relations at the time were ripe with many trends and ideas for the new millennium. The Millennium Development Goals had been adopted, various thematic conferences were being held at the United Nations, and the annual High-Level Segment of the United Nations General Assembly meetings provided an excellent opportunity for heads of state to meet and confer. But for reasons that I did not know, the president of Egypt never made an appearance there. I decided that we must convince him to attend and participate, and I did my best to do so, but he adamantly refused. His refusal, it was said, was due to security concerns. To me, this situation was unclear; I believed that not paying enough attention to such issues and refusing to actively engage in international events and policy gatherings caused us much harm at the time, despite all the efforts that were exerted in order to secure active and effective Egyptian participation.\n\nAs for Sudan, I had the feeling that this country, which has always been described as Egypt’s twin, was on the verge of explosion and that it would be divided not only into north and south, but into various provinces. Therefore, I believed that we must pay more attention to it, not only because it is an Arab and African country, but because of its African connections, which could be an advantage for Egypt. Sudan also had its disagreements with other African countries, which was a problem in its own right. Then there was the issue of Nile water security, and how to guarantee a sustainable supply of water for Egypt and defend Egypt’s share of Nile waters in accordance with historical agreements. All these elements, of course, had their considerable importance, but the key to managing them was, as we have previously pointed out, great economic power, together with an Egyptian commitment to make a big comeback on the African scene like the one achieved during the Nasser era. I knew that would be a real challenge, considering the huge difference between what Abd al-Nasser had done for Africa and the current situation. Since the liberation wars were over, Africans no longer needed weapons, military training, external headquarters for anticolonial resistance, or international support for independence. What they needed from Egypt now was food, financing, investment, and development, all of which exceeded Egyptian capabilities.\n\nConcerning the field of Egyptian–African relations, I believed that Boutros Boutros-Ghali exerted significant efforts during the period from 1977 to 1991. He established the Egyptian–Africa Cooperation Fund in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He made several tours and engaged in many activities in African countries, which undoubtedly helped him to become secretary general of the United Nations. But I was aware also that the fund’s budget in 2004 did not exceed ten million dollars per year, a very small sum of money that could by no means be effective in advancing Egyptian relations with other African countries.\n\nPresident Mubarak refused to participate in any of the African summits from 1995, following the assassination attempt against him at a summit in Addis Ababa, until 2004, when I was appointed foreign affairs minister. Egyptian security agencies increasingly insisted upon the danger of the president’s visiting Africa. As a result, the Egyptian role in Africa began to recede despite the great efforts exerted by other Egyptian agencies, efforts that the president refused to participate in or lead. Once again, I sensed the need to exert more effort in order to contain the situation in Africa and encourage the president to reclaim an active role on the African scene. The following years actually witnessed an improvement in the president’s viewpoint, as he started to show more interest in Africa. He participated in the African Union Summit more than once, in Nigeria, Ghana, and Libya, and sent the Egyptian prime minister to participate in summits. I must point out in this context that the concept of presidential participation in such summits and conferences is the key to opening doors on the African level. Unfortunately, many of these doors had been locked between 1995 and 2005.\n\nI had a firm belief in the importance of keeping positive relationships with western powers, especially with the United States, the most influential world power, and the European Union, which had started to open up to the Middle East in its Mediterranean region through the cooperative framework of the Barcelona Declaration. The power relations between these two camps, that is, the American and the European, did not escape my notice at the time. Even though I believed that both of them actually represent one strategic and political bloc, I realized that they undoubtedly had political and economic rivalries, which would allow Egypt to move back and forth between them to pursue its interests.\n\nI also estimated that the gross national product of Egypt reached around $150 billion in 2004, while that of the European Union and of the United States amounted to around $12 trillion each. Such comparisons are necessary in order to put economic issues in their due context.\n\nI supported the opinion that we should maintain strong ties to the United States, and that these ties must be based on respect for the Egyptian viewpoint, no matter how different it was from that of the Americans. Yet it was also important for us to open up to and support other horizons of foreign relations with Asian powers like China, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Though I believed that China’s complete rise as an Asian power needed at least three more decades, I was sure, even in 2004, that it was already an open field for Egyptian national security. We could benefit from the Chinese experience as a substitute for the west or as a parallel to it when it came to our need for weaponry and technology. I was also fully aware that we were partially open to China only in some limited fields at the time.\n\nLike China, the Soviet Union was accessible to us and ready to play a major role in the balance of the region, thanks to its extended experience since 1955. Besides, Russia wanted to continue relating to the region by selling its weaponry. This could be a winning card for Egypt, which did not want to rely on the west as the sole supplier of weapons. That was a sensitive issue in our relationship to the United States, the country which, I believed, would continue to be the most influential world power and in particular would control the Middle East for decades, especially the Palestinian issue and the performance of Israel. Besides, it was clear that the United States—enraged after the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York on September 11, 2001—was pressuring the Arab and Islamic world in order to change the conditions that led to the emergence of world terrorism. Hence, we were in need of maneuverability and precise calculations so as not to lose the United States or be harmed by it in any way.\n\nDuring my stay in New York in the mid-1980s I monitored the American preoccupation with ensuring the continuity of its global dominance and hegemony. When I returned to work in New York once again at the end of the 1990s, I found that this preoccupation had turned into some sort of obsession for the American elite, who were concerned about America’s strategic relations with both rising and traditional powers that were likely to have influence in the twenty-first century. I consequently realized the importance of quiet diplomacy and sobriety in order to reinforce our relations with these powers.\n\nI studied thoroughly the Egyptian approach of constantly seeking to declare the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, and supporting the accession of Israel to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. I believed it was important to us to continue following this approach despite the conflict it could entail with the United States. Back then, I believed that the Egyptian attitude did not represent a big problem to the west as long as they were still able to protect Israeli interests and to keep it out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and I still hold the same belief today.\n\nAs the plane flew above the Atlantic, I thought about the institutional apparatus that oversaw and implemented Egyptian foreign policy. I noted that personal influences played a great role in managing this system. The Egyptian president, whether in the time of Nasser, Sadat, or Mubarak, was the principal actor and most influential decision-maker. There were also institutions and individuals that appeared and disappeared according to the will of the president. I have followed this matter throughout my career, first with the Egyptian national security advisor in July 1972, and then with the foreign affairs ministers Mohamed Ibrahim Kamel, Mustafa Khalil, Kamal Hassan Ali, Esmat Abdel Meguid, Amr Moussa, and finally with Ahmed Maher, and then when I became minister of foreign affairs in 2004. Naturally, I could not monitor or follow all the currents and competing forces of Egyptian diplomacy during the terms of Mahmoud Riyad, Morad Ghalib, Mohamed Hassan al-Zayyat, and Ismail Fahmy, due to my subordinate position at that time. In 2004 I considered that Osama El-Baz, who was very close to the president over the period from 1976 to 2004, still played an influential role in the decision-making process and the implementation of Egyptian foreign policy. I had to decide my attitude toward him accordingly and start playing with him!\n\nEl-Baz worked closely with deputy prime minister Ismail Fahmy from 1972 until Fahmy’s resignation in November 1977. Supported by Fahmy, El-Baz succeeded in becoming close to the vice-president, Hosni Mubarak, who was assigned by President Sadat to perform certain foreign policy tasks that Fahmy needed to be aware of. Ismail Fahmy thus encouraged Osama El-Baz to offer advice by accompanying the vice-president on his missions abroad, and at the same time to keep an eye on the activities of Hosni Mubarak, who had to depend on the foreign policy institution and mechanisms to successfully perform his tasks.\n\nOsama El-Baz continued to have a decisive influence during the terms of Mohamed Ibrahim Kamel, Mustafa Khalil, Kamal Hassan Ali, and Esmat Abdel Meguid as foreign affairs ministers. However, he was exceptionally keen on helping Amr Moussa, the new minister in May 1991, to achieve great success. In fact, Moussa enjoyed El-Baz’s support for many years, since they began working together in 1974. El-Baz’s willingness to help Moussa was particularly obvious when I participated with them in a meeting with the Syrian minister Farouk al-Sharaa in Damascus in June 1991. The Egyptian and the Syrian parties met to discuss Saudi and Gulf attempts to revise the Damascus Declaration and dilute the military and security role assigned to Egypt and Syria in the Arabian Gulf pursuant to this declaration when it was signed on March 6, 1991. I noticed that El-Baz kept silent all the time, unlike his meetings with other foreign affairs ministers; he was used to interfering in discussions all the time in a manner that annoyed them sometimes. I remember that on this particular day, and perhaps because of my experience in the preparation of the Damascus Declaration and my participation in all the meetings that led to its signing, I intervened with some views and comments that were agreed upon by Farouk al-Sharaa, who had headed the Syrian diplomatic corps during the drafting period. Dr. El-Baz came to me after the meeting and said, Oh, Ahmed, please keep in mind that we have to help Amr Moussa and give him the chance to show his potential. I then realized how self-denying El-Baz was when it came to helping Amr Moussa.\n\nI kept thinking about this situation. It was said that El-Baz’s influence within Egypt’s political system was receding and that the president was no longer inclined to depend on him as he did in the 1980s and 1990s. My relationship with El-Baz was based on deep respect for his capabilities and his practices, and I sensed that he too appreciated my experience and my role in helping many foreign affairs ministers to accomplish their tasks efficiently.\n\nWhen I was appointed foreign affairs minister on June 14, 2004 and started shouldering my responsibilities, I quickly detected that El-Baz had already receded and ceased to have a decisive influence on the president. Besides, he was no longer among the close circle of the political advisors of the president, nor did he write the president’s letters to other presidents or remain in direct contact with him as he had been in the past. For many years during which I worked with a large group of Egyptian foreign affairs ministers, I have monitored El-Baz’s performance and his relationship with the president. Back then, he had been the person with the most decisive influence on the president’s decisions in foreign affairs; his influence immensely exceeded the normal authority of the position of the principal undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to which he clung so tightly. I can safely say that the role Osama El-Baz played sometimes exceeded the roles of foreign affairs ministers and that the tasks assigned to him by Egyptian presidents were equivalent to those of both the national security advisor and the president’s secretary for political and diplomatic affairs.\n\nI did not attempt to learn the reasons for this quick fading out of El-Baz’s influence. It could have been due to the appearance of other persons or parties within the realm of Egyptian foreign affairs, or health problems, or even mistakes on his part that I do not know of but which led the president to gradually push him away. The history of Egyptian foreign policy will, I believe, find answers to these questions.\n\nOn arriving in Cairo on Sunday, July 11, 2004, I was met by Ambassador Sameh Shoukry, whom I had decided to make my chief of cabinet and principal assistant. I asked if he had heard anything about whether the position of the minister of state for foreign affairs, held at the time by the respected Fayza Abul Naga, would remain, and he answered that he had no idea. I preferred that this position be removed, since it had been proven, through long years of experience, to lead to many complications in the conduct of Egyptian diplomacy, especially during the term of Ahmed Maher. As a young diplomat, I had observed the role of Morad Ghalib, Sameh Anwar, Mohamed Riyad, Hafiz Ismail, and Mohamed Fa’iq, all of whom were ministers of state for foreign affairs who worked with foreign affairs ministers like Mahmoud Riyad and Ismail Fahmy, and I had seen that it was the cause of many problems. Later on, I worked in a more effective position and got closer to Mohamed Ibrahim Kamel, Kamal Hassan Ali, Esmat Abdel Meguid, and finally Amr Moussa while Boutros Boutros-Ghali was the minister of state. I witnessed several conflicts and contradictory viewpoints. There were occasions when the minister of foreign affairs presented his opinion in front of the Council of Ministers (Cabinet), then the minister of state offered a different opinion on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in front of the same council, and sometimes during the same session.\n\nI was convinced beyond any doubt that the position of minister of state for foreign affairs is actually a source of non-stop conflict and strife that should not be allowed. I had been informed by Minister Ahmed Maher back in 2002 that he had resisted the idea of appointing a minister of state for foreign affairs and talked to President Mubarak about this in August 2001. When Maher learned that the president insisted on having it because he was worried about Maher’s health and wanted to make things easier for him, he suggested my name as a candidate and proposed that the title should be ‘minister of state in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,’ instead of ‘minister of state of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.’ This way, the position would not have the status it had previously had in the ministry. But the president refused both suggestions and appointed Abul Naga as minister of state. The president, I believe, had calculated that the person in this position, especially with Ahmed Maher, would face many problems in his relation to the foreign affairs minister, and he imagined that choosing a lady for the position would ease the tensions between the two ministers. Abul Naga actually succeeded in handling Ahmed Maher’s anger, but her wisdom did not completely prevent the conflicts and maneuvers of which the president knew; he thus preferred not to keep this position when appointing a new minister whose personality and style were not known to him despite all the written reports and the opinions he had received about me."
