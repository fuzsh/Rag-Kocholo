        "text": "This article analyzes foreign policy behaviors of Syria under Bashar al-Assad in times of three crises: the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005 and the outbreak of Arab Spring in 2011. These three crises, which Bashar al-Assad has faced since he rose to power in 2000, have stemmed from international, regional, domestic environments respectively. The article posits that the Baath regime's security and survival concerns rather than external factors have primarily shaped Syrian foreign policy conducts in times of crises. In the article, it is pointed out that Syria as a weak state has been able to survive these crises that seriously threatened the very existence of the Baath regime thanks to its foreign policy strategies. In this context, the article underlines that President Assad's alignment policy helped Syria as a weak state survive despite domestic and external threats.\n\nThis thesis is a study of US-Syrian relations, and the legacy of mistrust between the two states. While there has been a recent growth in the study of Syria’s domestic and regional politics, its foreign policy in a global systemic context remains understudied within mainstream International Relations (IR), Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA), and even Middle Eastern studies, despite Syria’s geo-political centrality in the region. The primary purpose of the thesis is to analyse and understand the driving factors in US-Syrian relations, both the continuities – distinctive in the context of the region’s dynamic political landscape – and the rarer instances of discontinuity. By analysing the causes and constituents of US-Syrian relations, the thesis will also challenge a purely realist and power-political explanation that has dominated the discourse on Middle Eastern foreign policy; without discarding the value of alternative conceptual explanations, the thesis will argue that Syria’s positio...\n\nUS's sharp criticism of Syria echoed loudly in Damascus as US forces entered Baghdad with unexpected ease in April 2003. It is no surprise then that Damascus somewhat nervously fears the possibility of US action against Syria, irrespective of denials from Washington. After all, the similarities between the regimes of Bashar Assad and Saddam Hussein are not insignificant-both Baathist, pan-Arab, anti-Israeli and autocratic. The Syrian President will have duly noted US neo-conservative ambitions to spread democracy in the Middle East by undefined means. Beneath its recent rhetoric the Bush administration has sent a clear warning to Damascus to behave. Washington fears Syrian spoiling tactics, and wants cooperation, or at least no mischief making in Iraq, and over the Arab/Israeli Road Map, and Lebanon, where the US would like to see Hizbollah restrained.\n\nThe research takes a look at what the current state of Syria is in when it comes to global politics. By collecting information on the key players in the war, and the reason behind the War. One can understand the position of the United States and whether she is the major influence in the Syrian fiasco. According to Shamus Cooke, the US played a major role in the War. By analyzing the comments that Cooke stated concerning the problem, the study focuses on two research questions and two hypotheses that are brought up in the text (Cooke, 2014). From the data obtained by use of several data collecting methods in the research and by analyzing the collected information the final evaluation was that the war in Syria is a geopolitical war and is far from over. Also, the United States is a key player in the skirmish (Cooke, 2014)."
