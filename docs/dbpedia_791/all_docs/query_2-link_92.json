M?xico ser?a uno de los pa?ses menos afectados si\n\nEuropa entra en recesi?n, debido a las fortalezas econ?micas que tiene,\n\nasegur? el presidente de la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV), Luis T?llez.\n\nProyect? que la econom?a mexicana crecer? 3.5 por ciento durante 2012 y\n\naclar?: \"tengo el mismo estimado del gobierno. Hasta ahora Estados\n\nUnidos no ha cambiado, M?xico est? en una situaci?n privilegiada, pero\n\nsi Europa sigue igual tendr? que bajarse\".\n\nEn el paquete econ?mico para 2012 que la Secretar?a de Hacienda y\n\nCr?dito P?blico (SHCP) envi? al Congreso de la Uni?n, se estima un\n\ncrecimiento 3.5 por ciento, pero los legisladores lo ajustaron a 3.4 por\n\nciento.\n\nEn entrevista, T?llez Kuenzler calific? de \"extremadamente compleja\" la\n\nsituaci?n internacional, pues si bien Europa tom? medidas enfocadas a\n\naliviar la crisis de deuda soberana son todav?a insuficientes.\n\n\"Vamos a estar en el grupo de pa?ses que menos nos va a afectar porque\n\ntenemos una exposici?n comercial y financiera baja a Europa, y muy alta\n\na Estados Unidos\", y todo indica que la econom?a norteamericana empieza\n\na jalar bien, dijo.\n\nAdem?s, a?adi?, M?xico \"tiene con qu? jugar\", ya que reporta una deuda\n\nde 30 por ciento del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) y tasas de inter?s\n\nbajas, que permiten financiar esos pasivos con los impuestos que recibe\n\nel gobierno federal.\n\n\"M?xico est? en una situaci?n muy s?lida, la econom?a es muy\n\ncompetitiva, no hemos tenido inflaci?n, la productividad en M?xico ha\n\naumentado sustancialmente, no nos estamos basando en salarios bajos\" y\n\nestamos al lado del mercado m?s grande del mundo, resalt?.\n\nTras la entrega del Premio Mercados Financieros 2011 subray? que el\n\ncrecimiento del pa?s durante 2010 y 2011 se debi? a que Estados Unidos\n\njal? a la econom?a mexicana, lo que deriv? en creaci?n de empleos y un\n\naumento en la demanda interna.\n\nReiter? que \"M?xico no est? mal, al contrario, M?xico est? muy bien en\n\nmateria econ?mica, lo que pasa es que no nos podemos aislar si los\n\neuropeos entran en una recesi?n muy fuerte, obviamente la tasa de\n\ncrecimiento de la econom?a mundial en general va a caer y vamos a tener\n\nun impacto nosotros, los chinos y quien quiera que sea\".\n\nT?llez Kuenzler resalt? que la Uni?n Europea es la zona econ?mica m?s\n\ngrande del mundo, por lo que si reduce su consumo habr? un problema que\n\nafecte a todo el mundo.\n\nOpin? que los bancos europeos, sobre todo aquellos que tienen bonos\n\nsoberanos en su capital, los cuales se ven impactados por las altas\n\ntasas de inter?s y que adem?s tendr?n que cumplir con las disposiciones\n\nde Basilea III, tender?n a restringir el cr?dito para capitalizarse, lo\n\ncual es un factor de contracci?n de la econom?a.\n\nSin embargo, resalt? que a pesar de la situaci?n de la banca europea, el\n\ncontagio para los bancos en M?xico ser?a poco debido a que las\n\ninstituciones en el pa?s est?n bien capitalizadas y se rigen, a?n las\n\nsubsidiarias de extranjeros, bajo leyes mexicanas y los supervisan\n\nautoridades locales.\n\n--\n\nAraceli Santos\n\n*STRATFOR*\n\nT: 512-996-9108\n\nF: 512-744-4334\n\naraceli.santos@stratfor.com <mailto:araceli.santos@stratfor.com>\n\nwww.stratfor.com <http://www.stratfor.com/>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\n\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\n\nURL: <https://smtp.stratfor.com/pipermail/eurasiadigest/attachments/20111215/c3da1038/attachment.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 9\n\nDate: Thu, 15 Dec 2011 12:36:17 -0600\n\nFrom: Morgan Kauffman <morgan.kauffman@stratfor.com>\n\nTo: OS <os@stratfor.com>\n\nSubject: [OS] EU/ITALY/GERMANY/ENERGY/ECON - Italy Set to Surpass\n\nGermany as World's Leading Solar Market This Year\n\nMessage-ID: <4EEA3E21.1010902@stratfor.com>\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\n\nURL: <https://smtp.stratfor.com/pipermail/eurasiadigest/attachments/20111215/f22fe7bd/attachment.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 10\n\nDate: Thu, 15 Dec 2011 12:37:13 -0600\n\nFrom: Morgan Kauffman <morgan.kauffman@stratfor.com>\n\nTo: OS <os@stratfor.com>\n\nSubject: [OS] RUSSIA/ENERGY/TECH - World's largest Li-Ion battery\n\nfactory launched in Russia\n\nMessage-ID: <4EEA3E59.1030801@stratfor.com>\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\n\nURL: <https://smtp.stratfor.com/pipermail/eurasiadigest/attachments/20111215/c92b203d/attachment.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 11\n\nDate: Thu, 15 Dec 2011 12:44:10 -0600\n\nFrom: John Blasing <john.blasing@stratfor.com>\n\nTo: alerts@stratfor.com\n\nSubject: [OS] G3* - RUSSIA/NATO - Russia?s participation in NATO\n\nsummit not decided yet\n\nMessage-ID: <4EEA3FFA.3060801@stratfor.com>\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\n\nURL: <https://smtp.stratfor.com/pipermail/eurasiadigest/attachments/20111215/8e5b5ed3/attachment.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 12\n\nDate: Thu, 15 Dec 2011 12:53:21 -0600\n\nFrom: Colleen Farish <colleen.farish@stratfor.com>\n\nTo: The OS List <os@stratfor.com>\n\nSubject: [OS] US/EU/TECH/ECON/CT - U.S., European Union officials ink\n\nlong-awaited passenger data deal\n\nMessage-ID: <4EEA4221.10602@stratfor.com>\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\n\nURL: <https://smtp.stratfor.com/pipermail/eurasiadigest/attachments/20111215/c0dd5b77/attachment.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 13\n\nDate: Thu, 15 Dec 2011 12:58:33 -0600 (CST)\n\nFrom: Paulo Gregoire <paulo.gregoire@stratfor.com>\n\nTo: The OS List <os@stratfor.com>\n\nSubject: [OS] CHILE/BELGIUM/CT/GV - Chile asks Belgium to extradite\n\nsuspect in killing\n\nMessage-ID:\n\n<1291368099.410271.1323975513977.JavaMail.root@core.stratfor.com>\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"utf-8\"\n\nChile asks Belgium to extradite suspect in killing\n\nAssociated Press\n\n2011-12-16 01:34 AM\n\nFonts Size A+\n\nPrinter-Friendly Printer\n\nhttp://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=1788579\n\nChile is seeking to extradite one of its citizens from Belgium to be tried in the 1991 killing of a senator.\n\nMiguel Angel Pena Moreno is charged with murder.

There is no decision on it at the moment.\"\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told his parliament: \"My goal is to keep\n\nBritain involved. They are participating as an observer, that is what we\n\nare working on now. They will be an observer when drawing up the\n\nagreements between the 26 (EU countries), the 17-plus (countries).\"\n\nBut a British government spokesman, asked about observer status, said:\n\n\"We wouldn't put it like that.\n\n\"This is not some new organisation - it's an ad hoc grouping of\n\nofficials that will meet to prepare an international agreement on fiscal\n\nstability amongst the eurozone and other countries who choose to join.\"\n\nCameron has been speaking to other EU leaders in a bid to avoid\n\nisolation, and on Thursday called European Council President Herman Van\n\nRompuy and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who will take\n\nover the rotating EU presidency in January, a spokesperson for Cameron said.\n\n\"The prime minister reiterated that he wants the new fiscal agreement to\n\nsucceed, and to find the right way forward that ensures the EU\n\ninstitutions fulfil their role as guardian of the EU Treaty on issues\n\nsuch as the single market,\" the spokesperson said. \"That's why we have\n\ntoday agreed to participate in technical discussions to take forward\n\nthis work.\"\n\nCameron said a push for competitiveness, jobs and growth was an\n\nessential part of a comprehensive solution to the euro zone crisis,\n\nalongside the fiscal agreement.\n\nAlthough 26 countries were broadly in favour of the fiscal agreement,\n\nwith so many details yet to be finalised it is by no means certain that\n\nall will eventually sign up to it.\n\n--\n\nClint Richards\n\nGlobal Monitor\n\nclint.richards@stratfor.com\n\ncell: 81 080 4477 5316\n\noffice: 512 744 4300 ex:40841\n\n-------------- next part --------------\n\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\n\nURL: <https://smtp.stratfor.com/pipermail/eurasiadigest/attachments/20111216/d7e64a1c/attachment.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 70\n\nDate: Fri, 16 Dec 2011 09:49:54 +0900\n\nFrom: Clint Richards <clint.richards@stratfor.com>\n\nTo: The OS List <os@stratfor.com>\n\nSubject: [OS] FRANCE/ECON/GV - France to enter recession, 1% growth\n\ntarget hopeful: INSEE\n\nMessage-ID: <4EEA95B2.1010305@stratfor.com>\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"; Format=\"flowed\"\n\nHere's a link to the INSEE\n\n<http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/theme.asp?theme=17&sous_theme=3&page=note.htm>\n\npage that includes several docs. - CR\n\n*France to enter recession, 1% growth target hopeful: INSEE*\n\nhttp://www.france24.com/en/20111215-france-enter-recession-1-growth-target-hopeful-insee\n\n15 December 2011 - 22H14\n\nAFP - France will fall into a brief recession and the government's 2012\n\ngrowth target of 1.0 percent will be difficult to achieve, the official\n\nINSEE statistics agency warned Thursday.\n\nINSEE said it expects France to enter a mild recession in the final\n\nquarter of this year and the first quarter of 2012.\n\nWhile timid growth of 0.1 percent is expected to resume in the second\n\nquarter, INSEE analysts said gains of 1.3 percent in the second half of\n\nthe year would be needed to generate the 1.0 percent growth targeted in\n\nthe government's last austerity budget.\n\n\"It is clear that would be difficult,\" said INSEE's head forecaster,\n\nSandrine Duchene.\n\nShe said the latest surveys indicate economic activity is slowing\n\nsharply, with gross domestic product expected to contract by 0.2 percent\n\nin the final quarter of this year and 0.1 percent in January through\n\nMarch 2012.\n\nA recession is defined as at least two consecutive quarters of negative\n\nquarter-on-quarter growth.\n\nFrance exited a year-long recession in the spring of 2009.\n\nDuchene said INSEE foresees stagnation in the French economy as the\n\nprimary drivers of the recovery over the past two years, investment and\n\nemployment, are stalling.\n\n\"When you have such a phenomenon, restarting economic growth takes a lot\n\nof time,\" she explained.\n\nINSEE revised down its forecast for economic growth this year to 1.6\n\npercent from the 1.7 percent forecast it made in October.

Defence spending increases will also allow for the purchase of around 100 warships and four helicopter carriers ? including two Mistral carriers from France. In 2012 alone, the country is set to take delivery of dozens of new fighters, bombers, transport aircraft and helicopters.\n\nOf course, Russia's neglected military equipment and infrastructure needs to be updated, and there is no doubt the country is expected to spend money doing so, but some observers are worried that the political system, which has been on the receiving end of election-fixing allegations and protests in recent weeks, means the uplift may simply be designed to bolster the 'tough guy' image of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe background to the expenditure worries is the increasing concern over Putin's apparently autocratic leadership. Despite already having served as Russian president from 2000 to 2008, Putin is expected to return to the presidency next year following four years as prime minister. He was barred from being reappointed for a third term in 2008 by Russia's constitution, but when he returns to the Presidency in 2012, he will be eligible to serve a further two terms, with the term limit raised to six years. If he is as powerful as reports suggest, he could remain as Russia's President until 2024 and have the full-size modernised military at his disposal.\n\nThe military spend was decried by finance minister Alexei Kudrin, the man largely credited with protecting Russia from the worst ravages of the global economic troubles in recent years, shortly after it was announced.\n\nIn summer 2011, Kudrin said the additional military expenditure, which was later included in the budget despite his protests, would create too much \"additional risk\" for the economy, as the country had all but depleted the reserve funds that had helped it weather the financial crises. Whether Kudrin was fired or resigned is immaterial, his fiscal plans were not compatible with the far reaching plans for the military and he had to go.\n\n\"He [Kudrin] is a real budget hawk,\" says Henry Jackson Society research fellow Julia Pettengill. \"I think if you look at it objectively they do need to be investing in defence to be responsible leaders, but obviously they shouldn't be doing it the way they're doing it and it shouldn't be done by an autocratic regime, which is what Russia has. That is never a good thing.\n\n\"Putin is definitely a driving force behind this because the military expenditure has gone up exponentially in the past few years, and obviously nothing of that scale is going to happen without his say so. So he's really been instrumental in pushing that forward and he has got a lot of support within his party.\"\n\nRecent threats to NATO's missile shield have provided a clear example of the country's potential to take part in its fair share of 'sabre rattling' when it comes to protecting the regime's and Russia's interests. Memories of the South Ossetia war in 2008, too, show that the country is not as averse to conflict as it may publicly state.\n\n\"When you look at the upward trajectory of defence spending it's clear that Russia recognises two things,\" says Pettengill. \"One, they recognise that their military capability right now is woefully outdated, which is clear to anyone with just a cursory glance, but I think it also speaks to the sense which has been reiterated many times by Vladimir Putin and by Medvedev and other people in the ruling party, that this is the only way they're going to get respect on the world stage.\n\n\"There's an element of Soviet-era nostalgia that as a society they've just not gotten over because I don't think they've adequately confronted their Soviet past as we have seen in other societies that have recovered from living under totalitarianism,\" she says.\n\n\"I think that is breeding all sorts of malignant behaviours, and defence spending is part of that. When you listen to the regime talk about why they need to increase spending, it is quite often phrased in terms that say 'we lost our status as a superpower and we need to get it back'; in a nostalgic, prideful way. So I think that's an element that's worrying as well.\"\n\nRussia is not completely closed off to outside influence, says Pettengill, but some of the reasoning for the need for a return to a large, powerful military seems to be \"fuelled by a distrust of the outside world\".\n\nOf course, the country's internal politics is not the only problem facing the military build up. Before other nations worry about aggression from a resurgent, belligerent Russia, the country still has some practical hurdles to overcome.\n\nFor one, Russia faces \"huge demographic problems\" in moving away from a conscript-based to a volunteer military.\n\n\"The state of health of young men who would be the prime target for that [military service] is not fantastic in Russia, as we all know,\" says Pettengill. \"If you look at the broader demographic trends of early death rates for young men and people not having enough babies to keep the army in business in a few years' time, then I think defence spending as a whole might end up coming up against these very real walls.\"\n\nThe result is that for all the headline spending figures, the effects of the defence spend may be overstated.\n\n\"Even if they do intend it to build an actually stronger defence capacity, the problem is that the corruption is so endemic in Russia, in all aspects of state business, that a lot of this money has already been syphoned off to various corrupt officials.\n\n\"So whether or not these modernisations will actually yield anything or whether they'll be too little too late remains to be seen.\"\n\nSincerely,\n\nMarko Primorac\n\nTactical Analyst\n\nSTRATFOR\n\n221 W 6th Street, Suite 400\n\nAustin, TX 78701\n\nT: +1 512.744.4300 ext. 4115 ?

I always found it more sensible to\n\nsolve the issue with an acceptable agreement,\" said Iceland's Minister\n\nof Finance Steingrimur J. Sigfusson, adding it did not come \"as a surprise.\"\n\nPrime Minister Johanna Sigurardottir had also hoped that the case would\n\nbe dismissed once it was clear that the bank's estate could cover\n\npriority claims, according to reports of the magazine Iceland Review.\n\n\"But now there is legal uncertainty and so the case must be solved\n\nbefore the courts. It is hard to predict what will happen, how long it\n\nwill take and so on, but one thing is certain, that we will put all our\n\neffort into our defense,\" the prime minister was quoted as saying.\n\nIcesave, an online subsidiary of Landsbanki, collapsed along with other\n\nmajor banks in 2008. Some 340,000 British and Dutch savers had deposits\n\nin the banks. Iceland was obligated to ensure payment of a minimum\n\ncompensation of 20,000 euros (about 26,000 dollars) per depositor.\n\nThe authority noted that the bankruptcy estate of Landsbanki has started\n\nto pay out the claims of depositors. However, according to the\n\ninformation provided by Iceland, those claims would not be paid in full\n\nbefore the end of 2013, said a statement from EFTA.\n\nThe bankruptcy estate of Landsbanki paid a more than 350 billion\n\nIcelandic krones (about 2.9 billion U.S. dollars) deposit on the Icesave\n\ndebt, which is the first large payment from the estate last week,\n\nIceland Review reported.\n\nIf the EFTA court rules in Iceland's favor, the Landsbanki's assets will\n\ngo to claimants but they will not receive any interest. Otherwise, they\n\nhave to negotiate on payments and interests again. The court may not\n\nreach its decision until early 2013.\n\n--\n\nClint Richards\n\nGlobal Monitor\n\nclint.richards@stratfor.com\n\ncell: 81 080 4477 5316\n\noffice: 512 744 4300 ex:40841\n\n-------------- next part --------------\n\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\n\nURL: <https://smtp.stratfor.com/pipermail/eurasiadigest/attachments/20111216/49c3d163/attachment.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 73\n\nDate: Fri, 16 Dec 2011 10:11:19 +0900\n\nFrom: Clint Richards <clint.richards@stratfor.com>\n\nTo: The OS List <os@stratfor.com>\n\nSubject: [OS] GERMANY/CT - Street shooting injures 2 in western\n\nGermany\n\nMessage-ID: <4EEA9AB7.2000501@stratfor.com>\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"; Format=\"flowed\"\n\n*Street shooting injures 2 in western Germany*\n\nhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2011-12/16/c_131309267.htm\n\nEnglish.news.cn 2011-12-16 06:27:24 [RSS] [Feedback]\n\n[Print] [Copy URL] [More]\n\nBERLIN, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- Two people were critically injured in a\n\nrampant shooting in the city of Bottrop in western Germany on Thursday.\n\nThe incident took place around 18:00 local time (GMT 1700) in front of\n\nAlbrecht-Durer Primary School in Bottrop, North Rhine-Westphalia State,\n\nlocal media reported.\n\nSeveral gunshots were heard, witnesses said.\n\nThe victims were reportedly two brothers aged between 24 and 25.\n\nPolice suspected there were two perpetrators.

Lets chat this out\n\ntomorrow during our FSU mtg. - LG\n\n*This would be very significant if it happens, though at this point\n\nit is unclear if it will - certainly something to watch closely - EC\n\n*Uzbekistan: Pentagon Mulls Giving Military Equipment to Tashkent*\n\nhttp://www.eurasianet.org/node/64707\n\nDecember 15, 2011\n\nA proposed plan to send excess US military equipment to Uzbekistan\n\nis drawing protests from Pentagon critics, who say such a gift would\n\nundermine US security interests in Central Asia. The equipment that\n\nUzbekistan might receive would come from items being withdrawn from\n\nAfghanistan. A B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, like the one shown in this\n\nphoto, would not be among items sent to Uzbekistan. (Photo: US Air\n\nForce/Staff Sgt. M. Erick Reynolds)\n\nAmid the release of a report detailing the widespread and systematic\n\nuse of torture in Uzbekistan, the US Defense Department may make a\n\nmajor donation to Tashkent?s security establishment. Under the plan\n\ncurrently being considered, Uzbekistan would obtain equipment that\n\nthe Pentagon deems redundant or outdated for use by the American\n\nmilitary.\n\nThe legality of giving Uzbekistan the equipment, categorized as\n\nExcess Defense Articles (EDA), seems sketchy. According to Section\n\n7076 of the Department of State, Foreign Operations and Related\n\nPrograms Act 2009, Uzbekistan would be eligible for EDA only if\n\nTashkent makes \"substantial and continuing progress\" in a variety of\n\nareas, including \"respect for internationally recognized human\n\nrights, establishing a genuine multi-party system, and ensuring free\n\nand fair elections, freedom of expression, and the independence of\n\nthe media.\"\n\nInternational watchdog groups generally rank Uzbekistan as one of\n\nthe most repressive, authoritarian-minded states on earth. The\n\ncountry?s human rights reputation took a battering on December 13,\n\nwhen a report released by Human Rights Watch detailed how Uzbek\n\nauthorities employ a wide variety of torture techniques against\n\ndetainees, including beating with rubber truncheons, electric shock\n\nand sexual assault. Laws adopted by Uzbekistan supposedly designed\n\nto strengthen the administration of justice, including a 2008\n\nmeasure covering habeas corpus, have gone unimplemented, the HRW\n\nreport adds.\n\nThe restriction on giving EDA items to Uzbekistan could be waived by\n\nClinton, if she determines \"that the Government of Uzbekistan has\n\ntaken concrete and measurable steps to improve respect for\n\ninternationally recognized human rights.\"\n\nAccording to Third Army commander Lt. Gen. Vincent Brooks, who\n\nvisited Uzbekistan in late November, one of the key issues he\n\ndiscussed with the Uzbek Ministry of Defense was the transfer of\n\nmilitary equipment to Uzbekistan from US forces fighting in\n\nAfghanistan. \"I think that there are ways that the excess equipment\n\ncould benefit both countries, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, with the\n\nexcess of US equipment from the war,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nPentagon planners consider Uzbekistan an essential ally in the\n\nUS-led war effort. Uzbekistan serves as a hub for the Northern\n\nDistribution Network, a vital supply line for shipping non-military\n\ngoods in and out Afghanistan.\n\nState Department diplomats declined to comment on Lt. Gen. Brooks'\n\nremarks or the Department's stance on the current restrictions\n\nagainst providing EDA to Uzbekistan. Diplomats referred questions to\n\nUS Central Command.\n\nRepresentatives of the US Central Command (CENTCOM) were reticent\n\nwhen asked to elaborate on Brooks? comments. \"What we can tell you\n\nis that Lt. Gen. Brooks visited Uzbekistan on a familiarization tour\n\nto meet with government officials, as this region falls under his\n\narea of responsibility as Commander of the US Army Central Command,?\n\nsaid CENTCOM spokesman Maj. David Nevers. ?The general was in\n\nTashkent to discuss cooperation with regards to the drawdown of US\n\nforces in Afghanistan.?\n\nNevers also stressed that the United States is not angling for a\n\nlong-lasting base in Uzbekistan. ?The United States is not\n\ninterested in a permanent military presence in Afghanistan or\n\nCentral Asia, and Lt.\n\nGen. Brooks did not seek any permanent US military presence in\n\nUzbekistan,\" Nevers said.\n\nDespite ongoing concerns about Uzbekistan's human rights record, the\n\nUnited States has assiduously courted the favor of Uzbek strongman\n\nIslam Karimov. A meeting between Clinton and Karimov in Tashkent in\n\nOctober marked a high note. A succession of top ranking US military\n\nofficers, including Lt. Gen. Brooks, has also passed through the\n\nCentral Asian state in recent months.\n\nCritics of Pentagon policy in Central Asia warn that plans to grant\n\nEDA items to Uzbekistan are \"a recipe for disaster.\" A former OSCE\n\nsecurity advisor told EurasiaNet.org that any move to arm, or assist\n\nthe Uzbek army would be detrimental to US regional interests. \"It\n\nwill provide an adverse reaction in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan,? the\n\nsource said.\n\n?Why arm up the former Soviet Union state that hates everyone and\n\neveryone hates, regularly competes over water rights and is believed\n\nto torture their own people?? the source continued. ?Stocking up\n\nUzbekistan with munitions will create a dangerous imbalance of power\n\nwithin an already fractious region.\"\n\nPaul Quinn-Judge, Central Asia director for International Crisis\n\nGroup, said Washington's perception of its security interests\n\nappeared flawed. He described US efforts to secure diplomatic ties\n\nwith Uzbekistan as reckless and shortsighted. \"It's always possible\n\nthat Lt. Gen. Brooks was speaking out of turn, but the mere thought\n\nthat officials in Washington are ready to consider supplying surplus\n\nmilitary equipment to Tashkent is very disturbing. It also smacks of\n\nsomething akin to desperation,? Quinn-Judge said.\n\nQuinn-Judge said there was a considerable danger that any US weapons\n\nsupplied to the Uzbek military could end up being used against\n\ncivilians in Uzbekistan, or, one way or another, fall into the hands\n\nof Taliban insurgents. ?There can be no doubt that Uzbekistan is one\n\nof the most brutal and authoritarian regimes in the region. Right\n\nnow it looks very stable: but so have a lot of other authoritarian\n\nfriends of the United States in the past year or so,? he said. ?You\n\nwould have thought that Washington would have learned caution, but\n\nit seems like barely sublimated anxiety about the situation in\n\nAfghanistan is leading them to cling to any leader who expresses\n\nsupport.\"\n\nIn September, the United States took steps to waive sanctions\n\nprohibiting Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Uzbekistan. These\n\nsanctions were linked to human rights concerns. EDA, if they are\n\nprovided to Uzbekistan, could be transferred to Tashkent free of\n\ncharge, or sold with a minimum 50 percent discount on the original\n\nacquisition price under the FMS program.\n\n--\n\nLauren Goodrich\n\nSenior Eurasia Analyst\n\nSTRATFOR*\n\n*T: +1 512 744 4311 | F: +1 512 744 4105\n\nwww.STRATFOR.com\n\n--\n\nMichael Wilson\n\nDirector of Watch Officer Group\n\nSTRATFOR\n\n221 W. 6th Street, Suite 400\n\nAustin, TX 78701\n\nT: +1 512 744 4300 ex 4112\n\nwww.STRATFOR.com\n\n-------------- next part --------------\n\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\n\nURL: <https://smtp.stratfor.com/pipermail/eurasiadigest/attachments/20111216/ebdf5619/attachment.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 76\n\nDate: Thu, 15 Dec 2011 22:28:44 -0600\n\nFrom: Chris Farnham <chris.farnham@stratfor.com>\n\nTo: alerts@stratfor.com\n\nSubject: [OS] B3* - FRANCE/ECON/GV - France to enter recession, 1%\n\ngrowth target hopeful: INSEE\n\nMessage-ID: <4EEAC8FC.3070206@stratfor.com>\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\n\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\n\nURL: <https://smtp.stratfor.com/pipermail/eurasiadigest/attachments/20111215/bf2cbb3b/attachment.html>\n\n------------------------------\n\nMessage: 77\n\nDate: Fri, 16 Dec 2011 13:57:18 +0900\n\nFrom: Clint Richards <clint.richards@stratfor.com>\n\nTo: The OS List <os@stratfor.com>\n\nSubject: [OS] UKRAINE/TAJIKISTAN/ECON/GV - Tajikistan, Ukraine sign\n\nseven cooperation accords\n\nMessage-ID: <4EEACFAE.8070605@stratfor.com>\n\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\"; Format=\"flowed\"\n\n*Tajikistan, Ukraine sign seven cooperation accords*\n\n/Text of report by state-owned Tajik Television First Channel on 16\n\nDecember/\n\nSeven new cooperation agreements between Tajikistan and Ukraine have\n\nbeen signed in the presence of the presidents of the two states [as part\n\nof Tajik President Emomali Rahmon's visit to Ukraine]: a joint\n\ndeclaration of the Tajik and Ukrainian presidents; a protocol between\n\nthe Tajik government and the Ukrainian cabinet of ministers on\n\nintroducing changes to the intergovernmental cooperation agreement in\n\nthe sphere of technological support of information of 2 April 2004; a\n\nprotocol between the Tajik government and the Ukrainian cabinet of\n\nministers on introducing changes to the intergovernmental cooperation\n\nagreement in the sphere of state communication; a memorandum of\n\nunderstanding between the Tajik and Ukrainian constitutional courts; a\n\ncooperation agreement between the Tajik and Ukrainian olympic\n\ncommittees; an agreement between the administration of Tajikistan's\n\nKhatlon Region and the administration of Ukraine's Lugansk Region on\n\ntrade, economic, scientif! ic, technological and cultural cooperation;\n\nan agreement between the Tajik Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the\n\nUkrainian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\n/Source: Tajik Television First Channel, Dushanbe, in Tajik 0300 gmt 16\n\nDec 11/\n\n*BBC Mon CAU 161211 abm/hsh*\n\n?
