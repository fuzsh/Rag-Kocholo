IBRAHEEM FINJAN SADDAM AL AMARA2\n\nwwasdth59@gmail.com\n\n^University of Basrah - College of Education for Human Sciences - Department of History , IRAQ. Abstract\n\nThis research was devoted to study of Syria's position on the return of Egypt to the League of Arab States, as this position went through two stages, the first one strongly opposed to the return of Egypt for the period from 1982-1988, during which Syria succeeded in thwarting all attempts by Egypt to regain its seat in the Arab League, while Syria was exposed in the second stage in 1989, to a great pressures affected her policy in the Arab League, which prompted her to adapt to international and regional changes and abandon her position opposing Egypt's return to the Arab League.\n\nKeywords ;Syria, League of Arab States, Egypt, Hafed al-Assad, Hosni Mubarak.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Syrian role in the League of Arab States is one of the most important factors that contributed to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League institution, this role did not stop at this point, but rather constituted a major obstacle to Egypt's return to the League again, as Syria was afraid that Egypt would regain its seat within the Arab League while it was shackled by the restrictions of Camp David, which encourages many Arab countries to normalize their relations with (Israel) in the absence of the Arab deterrent and leniency with Egypt, that is why it has tightened its position towards Egypt, adopting a policy based on two pillars, the first is the establishment of Arab blocs within the League, opposing the return of Egypt, and the second is benefiting from the Arab consensus paper as a prerequisite for passing any decision within the League, however, the international and regional circumstances greatly affected the Syrian position and made it shift towards flexibility and leniency towards Egypt's return to the Arab League, for these and other reasons, we chose the subject of the study entitled (The Syrian position on Egypt's return to the Arab League 1982-1989).\n\nThe year 1982 was selected as the beginning of the study because it was the year in which the proposal for Egypt's return to the league was presented for the first time after its expulsion from it in 1979, and Syria had an important position in thwarting this proposal. As for the reason for choosing the year 1989 as the end of the study, because it is the year that represents Egypt's return to the Arab League after the Syrian approval.\n\nThe study focused on Syrian positions opposing Egypt's return to the Arab League during the Arab summit conferences and Arab foreign ministers and the conditions set for the period from 19821988, the study also sheds light on the international, regional and Arab circumstances and factors\n\nthat changed the Syrian position from a position of opposition and hardliner to Egypt's return to the league to a flexible and lenient one.\n\nThe study dealt with the Syrian and Egyptian reactions to the Casablanca Summit in 1989 and the normalization of relations between the two countries, and the gains that Syria achieved in the league regarding Egypt's return to it.\n\nThe study relied on an important and diverse group of sources, foremost of which are the unpublished documents, which are the documents of the Syrian Historical Directorate preserved in the Syrian National Museum in Damascus, and the documents of the Syrian Ministry of Information preserved in Dar Al Baath in Damascus, as well as the published Arab documents, represented by the documents of the League of Arab States in addition to the Arabic books., and a number of university theses and dissertations.\n\nTHE SYRIAN POSITION ON EGYPT'S RETURN TO THE ARAB LEAGUE 1982-1989 Egypt tried to take advantage of the circumstances and developments in the Arab arena to return to the Arab League and normalize Egyptian-Arab relations, foremost among those circumstances was outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980, its support for Iraq, its condemnation of the (Israeli) invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and the withdrawal of its ambassador from Tel Aviv (1 ). These positions prompted many Arab countries to demand the return of Egypt to the Arab League, led by Sudan, whose president, Jaafar al-Numeiri (2) presented at the Fez summit 6-9 September 1982 a proposal supported by Iraq and Jordan that included Egypt's return to the Arab League, but he faced strong Syrian opposition to return Egypt burdened with the restrictions of Camp David to the Arab ranks and the difficulty of turning a blind eye to Sadat's national betrayal, which prompted the Sudanese president to withdraw his proposal from the Arab summit (3).\n\nThe Egyptian government continued its efforts to end the Arab boycott, so it took advantage of the Palestinian-Syrian differences after the events of Tripoli in 1983 (4), so it allied itself with the Palestine Liberation Organization and restored relations between the two parties after the meeting of Yasser Arafat ( 5) and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak (6 ) in Cairo on December 22, 1983. This alliance was supported by Jordan with the aim of Egypt mediating between it and Israel to resume negotiations(7) on the Reagan project(8), and those interests prompted Jordan, the PLO and Iraq to demand the return of Egypt to the Islamic Conference during its meeting in Casablanca, Morocco, for the period 16-19. January 1984, so it was approved, and Egypt regained its membership in the Islamic Conference, to be the first step for Egypt's return to the Arab League (9), but that step faced Syrian opposition, as the Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa (10) presented a memorandum of protest to the Islamic Conference that included rejecting the membership of any country that has relations with (Israel), and considering Egypt's decision to return to the Islamic Conference illegal, but the Syrian memorandum did not receive any significant response (11).\n\nOn September 25, 1984, the Jordanian government restored its diplomatic and political relations with Egypt, with the aim of helping to find a peace settlement with Israel (12) in late 1984, the Arab League called for the necessity of Egypt's return to the Arab League, citing Egypt's national role and its importance in supporting the issues of Iraq, Palestine, and Lebanon. (13 ) In July 1985,\n\nJordan, Iraq, and Morocco demanded that the issue of Egypt's return to the League be included in the agenda of the Casablanca Summit to be held in August 1985, and that the Arab League Charter be amended so that its decisions would be based on the principle of the majority instead of consensus, but the Syrian government strongly opposed that invitations promised the aim of holding a summit for settlement with (Israel), changing the system of consensus and approving the principle of the majority to open the door legally to Egypt's return to the League, limiting the future of the Arab decision within the circle of parties in solidarity with Camp David, and isolating the Arab countries that reject Camp David within the Arab League. As a starting point, the Syrian government boycotted the Casablanca summit in 1985 and was supported by Libya, Algeria, South Yemen and Lebanon (14).\n\nThe emergency Arab summit conference was held in the city of Casablanca from 7-9 August 1985 amid a boycott of five Arab countries, namely Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Algeria and South Yemen (15). These absences and the Syrian opposition affected the Arab summit, which refused to discuss the issue of the return of Egypt to the league because of the absence of consensus, and Egypt adheres to the Camp David Accords (16).\n\nThe Syrian position rejecting Egypt's return to the Arab League was affected by many factors and influences on the international and regional arena, foremost among which was the accusation of Syria in supporting terrorism following the case of Nizar al-Hindawi (17) and his attempt to blow up a plane flying from London Airport to Tel Aviv on April 17, 1986, as Britain was accused Syria is behind that attempt, and it severed its diplomatic relations with Syria on October 24, 1986 (18), and the United States of America and Canada withdrew their ambassadors from Damascus, and the European Community decided, in cooperation with the American government, on November 10, 1986 to impose economic sanctions on Syria, and suspend work Diplomatic missions, stopping the sale of weapons to Syria, and including it in the list of countries supporting terrorism (19), and these circumstances coincided with the change of Soviet policy towards Syria, after Mikhail Gorbachev (20) assumed the presidency of the Soviet Union in 1985, he worked to re-evaluate foreign policy of Soviet Union through improving relations with the United States of America, stopping the Soviet commitments abroad, focusing on internal reconstruction (21), and improving relations with Egypt with the aim of finding a settlement to the Middle East problem and the Palestinian issue (22), and Egypt became after 1986 the first trading partner of the Soviet Union in Arab world(23 ).\n\nThe features of that policy began to affect Syria, especially after the visit of Syrian President Hafed al-Assad (24) to Moscow on April 23, 1987 during his meeting with the Soviet Union, president Mikhail Gorbachev, when al-Assad asked him to increase Soviet arming of Syria to reach a strategic balance with (Israel) (25), however, the Syrian president was surprised by the response of the Soviet president, who told him that Syria's reliance on military force in settling the Arab (Israeli) conflict is no longer feasible and has proven to be a failure, and that the Soviet Union recognizes Israel's right to peace and existence, and that Syria must abandon the theory of strategic balance\n\nwith (Israel). ), and works to establish permanent peace and good neighborly relations with (Israel), and to improve its relations with Egypt (26).\n\nAt the same time, Arab pressure increased on Syria to change its position rejecting Egypt's return to the League, especially after the intensification of the Iraqi-Iranian war in 1987, which posed a threat to the security of the Gulf countries and their oil facilities, and Egypt's continued support of Iraq with military supplies (27), which prompted the Arab Gulf states and Iraq Jordan, the PLO, Morocco, Tunisia, North Yemen and Somalia to demand the return of Egypt to the Arab League during the emergency Arab summit held in the Jordanian city of Amman for the period 8-11 November 1987 (28), but those demands were met with opposition from Syria, Libya and Algeria, and Syrian President Hafed al-Assad refused to enter any amendment to the decisions of the 1978 Baghdad Summit regarding the boycott of Egypt, due to Egypt's adherence to Article VI of the Camp David Accords, which stipulated that the two parties pledge not to enter into any commitment inconsistent with this agreement (29), and set several conditions for Egypt's return to the league , including that Egypt undertakes to cancel Camp David agreement and the peace treaty with (Israel), and to support any unified Arab decision regarding the peace negotiation process, but these conditions were rejected by the delegations supporting the return of Egypt due to their prior knowledge of Egypt's position rejecting it (30). As a result of this division and the lack of consensus on the return of Egypt. At the conclusion of the summit on November 11, 1987, the League announced its Resolution No. (170), which stipulated that diplomatic relations between any member state of the League and Egypt are an act of sovereignty decided by each country according to its constitution and laws and not within the competence of the Arab League. (31), However, the decision faced opposition from Syria, as it contradicts the Charter of the Arab League and the decisions of previous Arab summit conferences, and that this decision will allow some Arab countries to open their embassies in Cairo in which the (Israeli) flag is raised above the (Israeli) embassy (32).\n\nBased on that decision, most of the Arab countries restored their diplomatic relations with Egypt, and opened their embassies in Cairo, the first was Iraq on November 13, 1987, and the last was Algeria on November 24, 1988, and only Syria, Lebanon and Libya remained boycott of Egypt (33). These Arab and international factors and influences mitigated the Syrian militancy towards Egypt, and the Syrian stance became more flexible, as Syrian President Hafed Al-Assad declared on December 22, 1988 during a press conference, saying: \"Syria appreciates the importance of Egypt, its Arab role, and the sacrifices of its people in the joint Arab struggle.\" .. and that the cooperation of Syria and Egypt on the basis of nationalism has always been in the interest of Egypt, Syria and the Arab nation\"(24).\n\nIt seems that the decision of the Amman summit regarding the freedom of countries to restore their relations with Egypt broke the consensus card that Syria was bargaining over in the League, and in light of the return of most Arab countries to their relations with Egypt, the Syrian government found that its boycott and opposition to Egypt's return to the League had become useless, so it took the Syrian position is gradually shifting from extremism to flexibility.\n\nIn the meantime, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia tried to conduct reconciliation between Egypt and Syria, and to prepare the atmosphere for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to attend the summit scheduled to be held in Casablanca in May 1989 without embarrassing Syria or Egypt. That is why the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdulaziz (35 ) visited Damascus on January 6, 1989 and met with Syrian President Hafed al-Assad, who pledged not to object to the Egyptian president's attendance at the summit, while Saudi Arabia pledged to allocate sums of money to support Syria estimated at about $800 million (36 ) .\n\nOn the other hand, Syria was afraid of the Iraqi regime, which, after the end of the Iran-Iraq war, devoted itself to settling its accounts with the Syrian regime because of its support for Iran during the war, Iraq tried to destabilize the Syrian influence in Lebanon by providing military support to Michel Aoun, and working to isolate Syria from the Arab world and encircle it through the establishment of the Arab Cooperation Council (37 ) on February 16, 1989 between Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and North Yemen, and using Egypt as a sea port to send Iraqi weapons (38 ) to Michel Aoun (39). At the same time, the members of the Arab Cooperation Council submitted a request to the Arab League to include the item of Egypt's return to the Arab League on the agenda of the Arab Summit to be held in Casablanca on May 24, 1989 (40).\n\nIn front of these circumstances, the Syrian government announced on May 13, 1989 that the Syrian president would not object to the participation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the emergency Arab summit to be held in Casablanca, and issued a statement stating that \"Syria considers the presence of the Egyptian president in this summit as a natural and positive development, and that Syria realizes that its interests are the same as those of Egypt... and that the Egyptian president has an old personal friendship with President Hafed al-Assad\" (41). In light of that atmosphere, the Arab League extended an invitation to the Egyptian government to attend the preparatory meeting of Arab foreign ministers to the Arab summit, which was held in Casablanca, Morocco, on May 21, 1989, Egypt responded to that call, and its foreign minister, Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Majid (42), attended the meeting after an Egyptian absence that lasted more than 10 years, amid a welcome from the Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa, who agreed that Egypt would restore its full membership in the Arab League(43) On the other hand, the Egyptian Foreign Minister refused an appeal of foreign minister of Iraq Tariq Aziz, when called Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon, , stressing that this issue is at the heart of the Lebanese-Syrian relations and that no one has the right to interfere in it. The Iraqi delegation was surprised by the Egyptian position, while it contributed to strengthening Syria's confidence in Egypt (44), and at the conclusion of the meeting, the Arab foreign ministers decided to resume Egypt's full membership in the League of Arab States and all its organizations, institutions and councils, and this decision was considered an official document of the summit (45).\n\nThe Arab summit was held at the level of kings and presidents in Casablanca, Morocco, for the period from May 23-26, 1989, in the presence of all Arab countries, including Egypt, with the exception of Lebanon, whose seat remained vacant due to the presence of two governments in it (46). Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak spoke at the opening session of the summit about the need\n\nto create an atmosphere to enter into a comprehensive peace and to avoid wars and their dangers in light of the development of nuclear weapons, the Arab countries must keep up with the changes taking place in the world in light of the US-Soviet rapprochement, and the most important thing that the Egyptian president said was, \"It is not Egypt that returns today to the Arabs, but the Arabs return to Egypt\" (47). Then the summit turned into several mini-meetings. On May 24, 1989, a meeting was held between Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, under the auspices of Moroccan King Hassan II. ended with reconciliation between the two parties, and Libya's agreement on Egypt's return to the league (48). On May 25, a reconciliation meeting took place between the Syrian president Hafed al-Assad and the Egyptian President, and it was agreed upon to restore relations between the two countries in return for Egypt's lack of support for Iraq's efforts to remove the Syrian forces from Lebanon (49), and at the end of the meeting the Syrian President stated: \"Our relationship with the Egyptian President is old, and we are colleagues in arms and friends, at the time, we were in one army and one country\" (50), and at the conclusion of the summit, the Arab League decided to ratify the decision of the Arab foreign ministers, which includes Egypt's resumption of its full membership in the League of Arab States and all its organizations, institutions and councils.(51) After the Arab summit, the Syrian-Egyptian relations started heading towards normalization, the Syrian president announced on December 9, 1989 that severing relations between Egypt and Syria is not in the interest of the Arabs, but rather in the interest of (Israel), and it is necessary to restore relations between the two countries (52), and on December 12 the airspace between Cairo and Damascus was reopened, and on December 23, the Syrian Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam visited Cairo, which is the first visit by a Syrian official to Egypt in 11 years, and he discussed with the Egyptian side about restoring relations between the two countries (53), and on December 27, Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Sidqi ( 54) visited Damascus and met with Syrian President Hafed al-Assad, and the two agreed to issue a joint statement that included the restoration of full diplomatic relations between Egypt and Syria after 11 years of estrangement(55)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt is clear from the foregoing that the international and Arab circumstances formed pressure factors on Syria, prompting it to change its foreign policy to conform to those changes, foremost of which are the European economic sanctions against Syria, the US-Soviet rapprochement, the change of the Soviet policy towards Syria, the end of the Iran-Iraq war, and Iraq's attempts to punish Syria through Lebanon, and the establishment of the Arab Cooperation Council to isolate and encircle it. In the face of these circumstances, the Syrian government found that it was in its interest to allow Egypt to return to the Arab League and restore relations with it in order to achieve several goals, first to break the isolation that the Iraqi side is trying to impose on Syria, and to prevent it from destabilizing the Syrian presence in Lebanon. Secondly, strengthening relations with the Gulf countries, which were showing a great desire for Egypt to return to the league and restore relations between Egypt and Syria, and Syria's response to the Gulf desire means more economic aid and money for it at a time when it was suffering from economic sanctions imposed on it, Thirdly, in\n\nlight of the Soviet Union's retreat from supporting Syria militarily, perhaps this matter will push the Syrian government to back down from the policy of confrontation with (Israel) and to resort to the policy of negotiations through the Cairo Gate to be a mediator between the two parties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------- FOOTNOTES ---------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Hassanein Tawfiq Ibrahim, Egypt's role in the Arab regional system after the 1987 Amman summit, Arab Future Magazine, Beirut, Issue 122, April 1989, p. 78.\n\n(2) Jaafar al-Numeiri: Sudanese military and politician.

Fatah al-Intifada were able at the beginning of June and after military battles expelling Arafat's loyalists from the Bekaa Valley to Tripoli in northern Lebanon, and there was nothing left for Yasser Arafat but to confront the rebellion and keep his last bases in Tripoli, so Yasser Arafat headed on September 16 to Tripoli and took over the leadership of the Palestinian forces in Lebanon and Syria considered it a challenge, so it intervened militarily on November 1, 1983, in cooperation with the Fatah Intifada movement, and attacked the Palestinian camps in which Arafat's forces were present, and imposed a siege on Tripoli, so the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia intervened to mediate with Syria on November 25, 1983, and managed to reach an agreement, a formula that guarantees the withdrawal of Yasser Arafat and his forces from Tripoli on board the Greek ships and the protection of the French battleships.
