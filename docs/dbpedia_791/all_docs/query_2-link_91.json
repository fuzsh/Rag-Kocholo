        "text": "Objective of the research The research aims to define the geopolitical reality of Syria and the effect of this reality in the case of supposed political solution in order to achieve the strategic balance between regional and international actors, on the Syrian arena. The research attempts to answer two fundamental questions diverging into sub-questions: 1-What is the effect of regional and international parties on the current reality of the revolution and the Assad regime? 2-What is the effect of the various regional parties in shaping the future of Syria? Branching this question sub-questions: 1. What is the impact of international parties? 2. What is the impact of local movements? The research ends for clarification and to study the possibility of reconciling between all these influences, and exploring the future of the struggle between local, regional and international parties. Depending on the analytical method by means the entrance of geopolitics and political realism theory. First: the fundamental and basic terms Syrian Revolution entered or been introduced over the past years in various stages of a very complex due to several factors, most of the political analysis that accompanied the stages of the revolution correlated to the analysis on wishful thinking base, which reduced the ability of these analyzes to build a logic predicated frame of the stages and mechanisms to deal with it. This reality which we will call (unsolved geopolitical crisis(;some of analyzes focused on the aspirations, away from the political realism, to what it means and contains of the concept power, balance , interest and what affects and is affected geopolitically. This research will try to explain the case of the Syrian current reality in terms of the interference of the local, regional and international elements in drawing an outline of the reality of the current crisis and its predicted results. Because the regional and international actors see in Syria a starting point to rebuild the regional and international balance ,and redrawing the geopolitical map of the region and their impact on the geopolitical reality in the world. 1-Geopolitical reality of Syria and the transition to a regional and international strategic node Syrian geography has great importance in influencing on the political and strategic options for the entire Syrian neighbors, it is a point of contact between the aspiring regional powers to play political roles within the region (the Middle East), and these powers are heiresses of preceding empires which are trying to reproduce the power concept in accordance with the new structures, the most notably in them is the expansion of the vital arena of power and influence.\n\nThe alliance between Syria and Iran and the formation of the so called ‘axis of resistance’ is one of the most fascinating and enduring example of a regional alliance, a pillar of Syria foreign policy and a determining factor in the trajectory of the Syrian conflict. To understand why secular Syria, the ‘beating heart of Arabism’, choose to align its foreign policy with the revolutionary Islamic Republic we have to look back at the transformation in Syrian politics under Hafez al-Asad, when Syria was in the process of establishing its prowess in the turbulent region (as part of its strategy to confront the Israeli ‘permanent aggression’) while it confronted a domestic rebellion. Formed as a response to the direct challenges posed to Syria and Iran by Iraq, Israel and the U.S. since 1980, the alliance with the Islamic Republic and its protégée Hezbollah boosted Syria’s regional position and contributed to its successful ‘balancing’ with international and regional powers. Concurrently, Syria continued to act as a swing state between Arab regional powers (Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iraq) in order to consolidate an Arab front against the Zionist enemy. The alliance with Iran also served to legitimise the Asad regime, both domestically and regionally, and to contain Islamist opposition. Under Bashar al-Asad, Syria embraced the resistance front as a continuation of Hafez’ nationalist policy of sumud (steadfastness), with a renewed antiimperialist stance against regional (Israel) and international (U.S.) interference. This posture has been a key element of Syria’s regional strategy and authoritarian upgrading. Since Syria is situated at the heart of a region traditionally penetrated by international powers and ravaged by armed conflicts, it comes as no surprise that Syrian foreign policy often took priority over domestic concerns, as many analysts maintain. Besides, the Bonapartist nature of the Syrian regime allegedly made domestic opinion largely irrelevant to policy making. This paper does not rule out the explanatory power of systemic explanations: Syrian and Iranian behaviour is in great part derived from the exceptionally unstable systemic arena within which these states operate, magnified by the context of the bipolar world and its demise. Syrian leaders crafted foreign policy on a balancing strategy between rivals and enemies centred on the regional role of Syria as champion of the Arab cause . Regional power balancing and regime survival required powerful regional friends like Iran and Hezbollah acting as deterrents, superpowers as international supporters, and Gulf monarchies as rich donors. Yet any comprehensive analysis of Syrian foreign policy and alliance making requires a more nuanced view of the links between policy making and foreign and domestic threats. The Syria-Iran alliance was part of an ‘omnibalancing’ strategy designed to confront external threats and domestic challenges to state leadership while aiming at attaining ‘strategic parity’ with Israel. Both the nationalist struggle and regime consolidation required mass mobilisation to channel national energies and ensure unconditional support to leaders, whose main claim to legitimacy was a commitment to Arab nationalism. At a time when nationalist struggle, state building and regime consolidation coincided, Hafez al-Asad’s balancing policies successfully addressed the contradiction between the revisionism rooted in the Pan-Arab identity of Syria - the liberation of Palestine and the unification of the Arab umma - and geopolitical realities - the division of the Arab front and the shift from a bipolar to a unipolar world - while consolidating the regime. In the new regional and local context in which Bashar al-Asad operated in his first ten years - one in which state-led Pan-Arabism was already dead, non-state actors have emerged as powerful political agents and a growing radicalisation of the disillusioned, embittered masses was directly challenging Arab autocrats - the Syrian regime confronted an ever-increasing need for sustained mobilisation to support the ‘resistance front’ regime while facing its inability to either live up to its own legitimation claims or reform. The onset of the Arab Spring has revealed a variety of complexities in the front, yet its ‘resistance’ discourse – though in a twisted form - has shaped the trajectory of the Syrian uprising in a decisive way. The Syrian regime and its allies have linked the repression of the uprising to their counter-hegemonic discourse while Syria used a range of repressive measures against rebels and opposition groups; Hezbollah gained greater strategic depth; and Iran reinstated its ‘regional alignment’ strategy and influence. With the adoption of the western ‘war on terror’, we are seeing a re-articulation of the Syrian nationalist discourse and foreign policy as well as the transformation of the front into a transnational counterinsurgency coalition. These developments demand that we reconsider the ideological assumptions, capabilities, and persistence of the resistance front while reassessing the connection between Syrian domestic and foreign policy."
