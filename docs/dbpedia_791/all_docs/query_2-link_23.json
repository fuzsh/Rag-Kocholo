        "text": "CONFLICTED\n\nS01E01\n\nThomas Small Welcome to the first episode of Conflicted, a new podcast from Message Heard. My name is Thomas Small, and I'll be your host. So, the Middle East, the Muslim world. It's a place of conflict, endless conflict. Sometimes, people think they know more than they do about these conflicts. Sometimes, they know that they don't know anything about them, but they wish to know. What we're going to do is try to unpick these conflicts the best we can, expose the ideological underpinnings of the sides involved, contextualise them historically, add perspective from our personal experiences living in and studying the Middle East, so that hopefully, at the end of each episode, you'll come away thinking, \"Aha. I understand this is a hard thing to resolve. These conflicts exist for a reason. It's not necessarily a question of good versus evil. It's a very nuanced problem.\"\n\nYou're going to hear from my co-host, Aimen Dean, in just a minute, a man who, at one point, had decided to commit himself to al-Qaeda.\n\nAimen Dean There were ten-minutes-walk to Khaled's house. My plan was to say goodbye. By the time I knocked on his door, my plan has changed. I told him, \"I'm going to go with you.\" He said, you know, \"For God's sake, Aimen. Do you know that jihad is not a picnic? It's a war. Why would you go?\" You know? \"Do you think the jihad needs you?\" And I even remember that my answer to him changed his mind and changed my life. I said to him, \"I know, Khaled, that the jihad doesn't need me, but I need it.\"\n\nThomas Small Let's get into it.\n\nWe'll start this series with an event that catapulted the conflicts of the Middle East into the global consciousness: The Twin Tower attacks on September 11th.\n\nAimen Dean Okay.\n\nThomas Small Right. So, we're just starting.\n\nAimen Dean Yeah. Go ahead.\n\nThomas Small Aimen Dean. How do I introduce Aimen Dean? There is literally no one on Planet Earth like Aimen Dean. Saudi-born, but Bahraini nationality. Grew up in Khobar, an oil suburb of the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. From a young age, was very pious, especially following the death of his father, I think that's right, and then his mother. Became a jihadist first in Bosnia then in other theatres, ending up through the vagaries of personal history. In the arms of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, where, following the East African Embassy bombings of 1998, he decided to get out. But unbeknownst to him, God or fate had a different idea and he ended up in MI6, working for the Brits, the most important double agent deep inside al-Qaeda, informing against his former jihadist comrades for the British government, thwarting several important terrorist attacks in the process until, sadly, he was outed and ever since has worked in the private sector as a security analyst, working for corporations and banks, living with a fatwā over his head as his former al-Qaeda – the surviving former al-Qaeda jihadists and their followers want to kill him dead for stabbing them in the back. Aimen Dean.\n\nAimen Dean Well, that was, you know, a rather ominous introduction. Well, Thomas, how am I going to introduce you? Even after years of knowing you—possibly five years now, almost—you know, you're still a mystery to me. All I know is, basically, that you are an American, which I won't hold against you. That you are or you were in the past, you know, on your path to become a monk, a Greek Orthodox monk. And I won't hold that against you either. And, you know, the fact that, somehow, you ended up studying Arabic and Islamic studies. And then, when I met you, I was struck by how amazing your Arabic language skills were and your understanding of Islam and Islamic theology. And I was thinking, \"How could a Californian, you know, so much about the theology that influenced my upbringing so much and not only know it well, but also understand the language, the nuances, the… Understand the Bedouin culture?' You know, if I want to describe Thomas Small in few words, I would say that he is no small at all.\n\nThomas Small Well, here's the thing, Aimen. I met you and I felt weirdly like I had met some kind of spiritual brother.\n\nAimen Dean Likewise.\n\nThomas Small Though, on the surface, it may seem unlikely. If you think about it, it's not so unlikely. We both come from coastal regions. In some ways we come from boom regions, on the fringes of the civilisational heartlands of our various cultures. California on one end. The eastern province of Saudi Arabia, which, until oil, was a nothing.\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely.\n\nThomas Small It was a wild—. It was the Wild West of the Middle East.\n\nAimen Dean mmhmm.\n\nThomas Small We both grew up in, you know, what detractors would call fundamentalist religion. Me a Christian. You, a Muslim. We both, from a young age, felt that turn towards perhaps problematically deep practice of the faith. And then, we both decided to take the most extreme path.\n\nI can tell you growing up in California as an evangelical Christian in the Reagan eighties, Muslims were very much the enemy. No question. They were Satan worshipers on the one hand and they were blowing up planes and killing Americans. And, you know, they – they seemed to me to be a pretty bloodthirsty people. That's how it was being portrayed. Now, I can remember very clearly 9/11. Everyone, of course, remembers where they were on 9/11. It's the watershed moment of our lives, certainly, where we're both about the same age, both born at the end of the seventies. I was in London already. I had been invited to the Travellers' Club on Pall Mall. Can you imagine this sort of young suburban brat being initiated into this wonderful gentlemanly world of the Travellers Club? But my friend, who was a member, he – he needed to get me a suit. So, we walked into Moss Bros on Regent Street to rent me a suit, to hire me a suit, and there was a big flat screen TV on the wall. And everyone was crowded around it. And I looked and I could see smoke coming out of the World Trade Center in New York. Of course, my first thought was: \"This is a Hollywood movie.\" Or I thought maybe, \"Is this a retrospective of the 1992 World Trade Center attack or '94?\"\n\nAimen Dean '93.\n\nThomas Small '93 World Trade Center attack. And then, I was standing. And immediately, the towers began to fall. And I – I realised what was going on. And in my total shock, I just fell onto my knees. I just couldn't believe it. And from that point onward, everything changed. And these Muslims, who I had been raised to vaguely think were a malicious people, were revealed to be very malicious. Or so it seems to those of us who didn't know anything back then. Now, my \"Where were you on 9/11 story?\" is pretty ordinary, I think. But where were you on 9/11?\n\nAimen Dean Well, you said you were on Regent Street, yeah? Well, I wasn't far away from you. I was in Oxford Street. That day, basically, I had my regular meeting with one of my handlers from MI6 and the other hundred from MI5. So, we had a meeting. And, of course, there were, in the three months preceding that, many, many different, you know, red flags and warnings and hints something big is about to happen. And we will come to that later. And I was walking down Oxford Street. And there, there were lots of people congregating around the screen in, you know, one of the shops that were selling, you know, TVs. So, I just looked at it and I saw the smoke coming out of the north tower. And I was looking at it and I was thinking, \"Maybe that's the one. That's it. This is the one. This is the one that we were warned about, that something big is about to happen. But how did they get the bum way up there?\" I thought it was actually not a plane, but a bomb exploding at the higher floors. And then, you know, within minutes, the other plane struck the south tower. And then, I started to realise that, no, these are planes being used as guided weapons against high structures. And it was the World Trade Center, which itself basically was a target just eight years prior. And, somehow – somehow, I knew even then who most likely culprit. And within thirty minutes, my MI6 handler called me and told me that \"if you are still in London\"—because I was supposed to go to another city—\"stay, book a hotel. It's going to be a long week ahead.\"\n\nThomas Small When you say \"I knew who – who the culprit was,\" ultimately, the culprit was your friends, your former comrades in al-Qaeda. But why didn't you know about it? I mean, surely they would have told you.\n\nAimen Dean Well, it comes down to the fact that I began spying against al-Qaeda in late 1998, after the East Africa bombings. And when I returned to Afghanistan to resume, you know, at least, on the surface, my al-Qaeda duties in early 1999, my duties were confined to two areas. One was operational, which was the WMD program for al-Qaeda. So, I was part of the research and development for explosives, poisons, chemical weapons, biological weapons. The second duty, which was also a cover story for me, was being part of the – called the business clan. We used to call it this way: business clan. My duty then, as someone with a valid passport, a young face, and someone basically with relatives in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, is to help a senior al-Qaeda members with families in Afghanistan to export items to the Gulf. Now, many people say, \"Well, you were in al-Qaeda? How couldn't you seen it coming?\" And the answer was because it was so tightly controlled. The entire process, the planning, the 9/11 hijackers, all of them were trained in separate camps. That's the first thing. So, we never saw them. I only knew three of them, three of the hijackers. You know, Abdulaziz al-Omar, Nawaf al-Hazmi, and [name].\n\nThomas Small What about the mastermind of – of 9/11? He's very famous. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. You knew him. You met him in Bosnia, didn't you?\n\nAimen Dean I was one of college Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's, you know, first recruits into Afghanistan.\n\nThomas Small Did he seem like the kind of person that would – that would put together and successfully launch a – a terrorist operation killing three thousand people?\n\nAimen Dean Well, he's a highly gifted engineer.\n\nThomas Small Well, sure. There are many engineers in the world that don't blow – blow up of planes. It's not—. The fact that he's an engineer, you know, fine. But what I'm talking about, clearly, a very pious Muslim, he must have been.\n\nAimen Dean One, a pious Muslim. But two, someone with exceptionally deep hatred towards America.\n\nThomas Small Why do you think he hated America so much? What does America symbolise for these people? What's wrong with us Americans? We're such nice guys.\n\nA; Okay. So, if we are going to talk about what they thought was wrong with America, they believed that, you know, in the classic 1960s, '70, and '80s, they believed that America was, you know, the epitome of colonialism and imperialism, because of their support for, one, Israel; two, for Arab dictators as far as they are concerned. They saw America as the force that is holding back the Muslim world from, one, uniting and, two, progressing and advancing. So, that is why, in their mind, you know, if America is no longer there or, at least, if America would – would leave the Middle East alone, then progress could happen, unity could happen. You know, as if America is the only source of our ills while, in fact, basically, ninety percent of our problems are self-inflicted. But then, tell them that in 1995 and they would be basically telling you, \"You know what? You are in the wrong place. Pack your bags and leave.\"\n\nThomas Small That's interesting, because, about eighteen months before 9/11, I was in New York City. I had left home with very little money. I was nineteen, twenty years old. I was on my way to – to Greece to – to – to become a monk. That's what I told myself. And I was really full of – of – of a sense of – of – of hatred for what I saw as America's materialist, consumerist society that was – that was turning hearts away from God. I – I didn't even have a place to stay. And I was tramping around lower Manhattan. And I arrived at the World Trade Center. It was the middle of the night. It had rained. And I looked up at the towers and I shook my fist and I said, \"I—. One day, I hope someone brings you down.\" Because for me, they just symbolised what, in fact, I imagine, they symbolise to some extent for al-Qaeda: the epitome of American consumerist finance capitalism, neo-colonial hegemony, which I, as a kind of, at that time, aspiring Christian monk, also very much hated.\n\nAimen Dean You know what? You talk about American consumerism and, actually, you are not far off the mark as far as what motivated Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Because they saw American consumerism as part of the capitalist evil. Because, for them, the entire global economic system and banking system is run, according to them and their conspiracy theories, run by the Jews, the Zionists, and it's all done in a manner of usury, in an imperial way.\n\nThomas Small Usury, meaning in- – meaning charging extravagant interest.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed, yes. The interest-based banking. And for them, basically, interest-based banking and the entire financial system of the world was controlled by a cabal of elite Zionists and Anglo-Saxon bankers in order to have hegemony over the world. So, that is how they saw it. So—. And remember that Khalid Sheikh actually came from an area in Pakistan called Balochistan, famous for its, you know, deeply socialist leanings, but also almost communist. In fact, in the 1960s and '70s, they used to call Balochistan the Red Balochistan.\n\nThomas Small That's interesting, because, at the same time that I was pursuing this sort of spiritual journey, which landed me in the monastery, and shaking my fist at the World Trade Center for being opposed, as I saw it, to spirituality …\n\nAimen Dean Mmhmm.\n\nThomas Small … you know, the materialism as opposed to spirituality, I was also reading Noam Chomsky at the time and Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States. And that was very much influencing my antipathy to the West and to America, which, again, I think actually harmonises quite cleanly with the worldview of – of al-Qaeda and other such extremist Muslim jihadist, whatever you want to call them. Terrorists.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed.\n\nThomas Small So, when the World Trade Center fell down and I collapsed on my knees in shock, I wouldn't say that my reaction was anger. And I had no desire for revenge. It was more like sadness and, or so I thought, a sense that I understand why this is happening. Almost like justice had been done. I am ashamed to say now I wandered the streets of London the next day sad that, for justice to be done, such a thing was required. I utterly repent of this perspective now, I must say.\n\nAimen Dean Yeah.\n\nThomas Small But as a young man infused with religion, infused with Chomsky-style paranoid, left-wing, anti-colonialism, that's how I felt. Now, how did you feel about the attacks? Apart from operational. I mean, obviously, in MI6, you're immediately called upon to do a lot of hard work to find out who did it and stop them. But how did – did you feel? Did—? Was there the glimmer in your heart still of – of a sense of justice has been done or?\n\nAimen Dean Oh, no. My – my feeling at the time was more like regret, you know. Did I miss something? I mean, that was the moment when I realised that there were other signs that I could have interpreted or I could have picked up. And then, I was just thinking, \"How could they have compartmentalised the entire operation in a way that no one else was able to see it coming?\" I was told by other members of al-Qaeda in later years that the fifteen hijackers, most of them did not know they were in a suicide mission and most of them did not know until just a week before that they were going to hijack planes. But that's it. They were not told that the planes actually are going to be used as suicidal weapons. Only the pilots and the maybe two or three of the leaders of the hijackers who were told that it's going to be a suicide mission. Someone actually, you know, commented. They said that, until the day, more than two thirds of al-Qaeda's Shura council, which is the council of twenty top men, two-thirds of them—we're talking about twelve people within a twenty-men circle—did not know about it. So, if, you know, some of bin Laden's advisors, close advisors, never knew about it, how would I have known about it? However, there were signs [unintelligible] to that fateful day. I remember the last day I was in Afghanistan before 9/11 was in the first week of June of 2001. So, three months before the events. And by that time, I have stayed about seven weeks in Afghanistan. And I was going to the camps. One, Kabul. One to the – in the north of Kabul, in Muradbig, and then, I also went to Logar to say my farewells to one of my old friends from Saudi Arabia who was with us in Bosnia. And then, I made my way to Kandahar, to the tarnak farms, which is just close to the Kandahar airport. And that's a headquarters of al-Qaeda, where Osama bin Laden resided. And I was just in the prayer room of that, you know, of that complex when someone just came to me. He's a Yemeni. And he told me—. You know, my—. You know, my alias, at the time was [unintelligible]. And so, basically, he told me, [name], someone from the leadership is looking for someone who is actually going to be in the UK very soon. And I just thought of you. Are you going to be in the UK very soon?\" And I said yes. And he said, \"Okay. Just wait.\" And then, he came back later and he said, \"[name], the deputy of Osama bin Laden wants to see you.\" So, I didn't understand, you know. I – I hardly ever been summoned by [name], someone as senior as him. And so, I went to see him. And, you know, it was in a very small study. If you can call it a study, actually. You know, there is no desk. There is no share. There is nothing. There's only mattresses on the floor and bookshelves. So, I sat down and they asked me. And he said, \"When are you going to be in London exactly?\" So, I told him my dates. And then, he said to me, \"Then, I have a task for you. When you get to London, I want you to deliver a message.\" It's a verbal message, which was highly unusual. I always used to take letters sealed and take them and deliver them. So, I don't know the content. Although, MI6 at the time were so expert. They used to open them, copy them, then seal them and give them back to me without telling me the contents. So, I do not betray the information, you know. So – so, he told me, \"I have a message, and this message is very simple. There are four individuals in the UK. You must tell them that they need to sort out their affairs, bring their families to Afghanistan before the end of August.\" So, end of August is the deadline. \"If the end of August comes and they are still in the UK and haven't left to come to join us here, tell them then to stay there.\" So, I, you know—. I was listening to this and I was thinking, you know, \"This is highly unusual. It's a verbal message.\" Then, he told me, \"Something big is about to happen. Inshallah,\" which means \"God-willing.\" \"And if it happens, stay where you are. Stay in the UK. Do not be tempted to come to Afghanistan and join the jihad with us here if the Americans were to come to Afghanistan and invade us here. Do not be tempted. Stay where you are.\"\n\nThomas Small Or you must have known then that something big was being planned.\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely. This is when I started to put two and two together and realise that the activities I witnessed in the week before, where they were, you know evacuating many camps, taking away documents, taking away laptops, desktops, you know – you know, taking heavy weapons and munitions. They were transporting them to unknown locations. So, when I was on the plane back, from Pakistan back to the UK, and of course, basically my handlers were waiting for me at Heathrow, and, you know, I was basically carrying with me grim news that, hey, a big attack is about to happen, but I have no idea what it is, I remember some things that [name] said almost a year and a half prior to that, in November of 1999. As it is customary when one of al-Qaeda members, when they are blessed with a boy or a girl, they slaughter lambs and they invite people for this, you know, feast. So, in this feast, which I was part of, and sitting next to me was Abu Mus'ab al-Suri, who's one of the greatest strategic minds of the jihadist movement—.\n\nThomas Small His – his—. I mean, his works continued to inspire jihadists today.\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely. He is the one basically who pioneered the lone wolf attack.\n\nThomas Small Yeah.\n\nAimen Dean The lone wolf jihad. The individual jihad.\n\nThomas Small So, he's at this party with you.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly. And Abu Mus'ab al-Suri was, you know, the one who was basically the guest of honour there. And I remember he actually took from his pocket a paper and he said, \"This is a translation of a letter written by a think tank in America addressed to Bill Clinton.\" And that letter was written a year prior also. So, it's a bit of an old news. But nonetheless, he, you know—. And he and al-Qaeda leadership knew what to do then. He opened the letter. He said, \"This is a think tank. It's called the Project for the New American Century.\" And in this letter addressed to Bill Clinton, the signatories, who are members of this think tank, urged President Bill Clinton, at that time, to invade Iraq and to start the process of democratising the entire Middle East in order to make it a beacon of stability, of hope, and to make the Middle East a more stable region in the long run. And the only way they can do that is by toppling Saddam Hussein using Iraq then as a example of democracy in the Middle East. Now, who are the signatories, the eighteen signatories. I mean, there are many names. We can go through all of them.\n\nThomas Small Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nAimen Dean Dick Cheney.\n\nThomas Small Dick Cheney, of course. Wolfowitz.\n\nAimen Dean Yes. The deputy. Rumsfeld. Deputy. Condoleezza Rice was one of those. And, in fact, Jeb Bush, you know, George Bush's brother, was one of the signatories.\n\nThomas Small All the usual suspects.\n\nAimen Dean Kenneth Adelman, Richard Perle, William Kristol.\n\nThomas Small I.e. The Neo-con- — the Leading Lights of the Neo-con Movement.\n\nAimen Dean All the engineers and the architects of the Iraq War, which will happen, basically, five – in almost five years later, signed that letter.\n\nThomas Small So, Abu [Mus'ab] is reading a translation of this letter to – to you al-Qaeda people.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed.\n\nThomas Small And what does he say?\n\nAimen Dean And he said basically that there was one columnist in America who responded to this letter almost as if it was on behalf of Bill Clinton, saying that, you know, this will never happen, because, you know, the American people will never, ever accept such an undertaking, unless if there was an event in the magnitude of Pearl Harbor.\n\nThomas Small So—. But – but – but Abu Mus'ab doesn't want America to invade Iraq and bring democracy to the Middle East.\n\nAimen Dean Oh, he does.\n\nThomas Small Why?\n\nAimen Dean He does. It wasn't about bringing democracy. Because they knew the region more than the Americans knew. You see, that's a difference between the Project for the New American Century and al-Qaeda, which was the project for the new Islamic century. They knew their own region and their own people better than the Americans.\n\nThomas Small They knew that democracy would never just come at – at the – at the end of a bayonet.\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely. And you see that is the, you know, the genius of al-Qaeda. At least, you know, the up to that point. You see, al-Qaeda have two, you know, programs. First, destroy and then rebuild. They were good at destroy. They are never good at rebuilding.\n\nThomas Small Creative destruction.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly.\n\nThomas Small They, like—. They should all—. They should just move to Silicon Valley.\n\nAimen Dean Creative disruption or creative destruction. In fact, they called it creative chaos.\n\nThomas Small Ah.\n\nAimen Dean [foreign language].\n\nThomas Small And so, they knew what they were doing. These—. They're not idiots.\n\nAimen Dean No. no. They were – they were not. They knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nThomas Small So, they—.\n\nAimen Dean In fact, you know, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, who later became the operational leader of al-Qaeda and who was killed, I think, in 2009, but Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, who was a member of the Shura council of Al-Qaeda, he said something very interesting. He said that, you know—and that was in later years and justifying why 9/11 was important—he said that \"imagine that you have a house. It's dilapidated. You know, you want to destroy it. You want to build bulldoze it. But there is a problem: You're broke and you don't have a bulldozer. So, what do you do then? Well, in the village, there is, you know, someone who owns a bulldozer, and he's an idiot and someone who has short temper and easily provoked. So, what do you do then? You, you know—. You don't have even the money to hire a bulldozer. You can't pay for his services. So, what do you do? You write a lot of, you know, rude graffiti on the house, insulting him and his wife and his mother and his daughter and everything. And then, basically, he will come and destroy it for you for free. For free.\n\nThomas Small So – so – so, they attack the World Trade Center in effect by writing huge graffiti in the sky—\"Come attack us here in Afghanistan\"—because they knew, as well as everyone else, that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed.\n\nThomas Small And they know this, of course, because they, in their own lives, have seen it be a graveyard of empires—\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely.\n\nThomas Small —like the other great twentieth century empire, the Soviet Union.\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely.\n\nThomas Small So, they think, \"Well, the Soviet Union reached its end in Afghanistan. We are going to entice the United States to reach its end in Afghanistan as well.\" Which is interesting, because, when I was a kid, I knew about the Mujahideen, the famous noble Mujahideen fighting valiantly against the evil empire of communism to free and liberate Afghanistan. And I was convinced, primarily by Hollywood, that the Mujahideen were holy warriors riding their white stallions to defend themselves against the evil empire, as Ronald Reagan called it. For example, I remember I loved James Bond movies, and in 1989, Timothy Dalton's classic, The Living Daylights, one of the great James Bond movies, came out. We watched it. At the end of that movie, James Bond becomes a Mujahid. He becomes a jihadist. Joins this ragtag group of Muslim warriors—\n\nAimen Dean mmhmm.\n\nThomas Small —fighting this nefarious plot by a renegade Soviet general in line with a renegade American arms dealer to sell opium. I was very confused. But there you see James Bond riding – riding into battle with the Mujahideen. I think the same year, if not the year before, Rambo III comes out.\n\nAimen Dean I saw that.\n\nThomas Small Rambo becomes one of the Mujahideen as well. And at that last shot, he's riding his Mujahideen horse up against a whole battalion of tanks, Soviet tanks, all by himself. The – the Mujahideen were the great heroes, and the film ends with the dedication to the brave men of the Mujahideen.\n\nAimen Dean Wow.\n\nThomas Small And, apparently, I'm told it's – it's—. That – that – that dedication remains to the state. You can watch it on Netflix, and – and you get to the end of the film. \"To the brave men of the Mujahideen.\" When you were growing up in Saudi Arabia, you must have thought that those men were brave.\n\nAimen Dean Oh, indeed.\n\nThomas Small For all I know, you still think they're brave.\n\nAimen Dean Well, of course. I mean, after all you know, their – their cause was just, was to throw out the invaders. Any country would do that. Any people would do that. I remember there are people from our neighbourhood in Khobar who went to during the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, who, you know, thought it was a noble thing to do.\n\nAnd there were thousands of Arab volunteers from Saudi Arabia, North Africa, Egypt, Jordan who went to fight there in Afghanistan. Except what happened in Afghanistan at the time is that many people who were in prison in Egypt, especially Egypt, for attempting to overthrow the government of Sadat first and then Mubarak [crosstalk].\n\nThomas Small Inspired by – by famous Muslim brotherhood ideologue, Sayyid Qutb.\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely. Sayyid Qutb.\n\nThomas Small Sayyid Qutb, the most—. The sort of grandfather of – of – of modern jihadism.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. Actually, like, I mean, you know, his writings inspired those who killed Sadat and then wanted to overthrow Mubarak. So, they found in the Afghan jihad a space in which they can breathe, a train, a thing. And it was these people, especially three people—[name], Abu Mus'ab al-Suri, [name]. They met Osama bin Laden there. He was just young, idealistic, a – a—.\n\nThomas Small Rich.\n\nAimen Dean Rich.\n\nThomas Small Handsome.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly. Tall.\n\nThomas Small Articulate.\n\nAimen Dean Charismatic. He was there and all he wanted was just to help the Afghan jihad. But what poisoned his mind were these three individuals who were released from prison, or escaped from prison in Egypt, made it all the way to Afghanistan,, because they saw in it a, you know, an ideal fertile land to not only recruit, but also to train and to strategize the next phase of jihad. So, they saw Osama bin Laden. They thought that's it. \"This is it. This is the symbol. This is the man who we could ride as a horse towards the sunlit uplands, you know, of Islamic caliphate in Egypt.\n\nThomas Small But, surely, they didn't introduce him to the ideas of Sayyid Qutb and stuff. I mean, people knew about Sayyid Qutb. I think you yourself, you drank deeply from the well of Sayyid Qutb following the death of your mother. You found in Sayyid Qutb tremendous constellation. What about Sayyid Qutb and his now infamous writings?\n\nAimen Dean Well, these writings influenced Osama bin Laden greatly.\n\nThomas Small No. no. You. I'm talking about you.\n\nAimen Dean Okay.\n\nThomas Small What—? How did they? Why did they – why did they give you so much constellation as a young Muslim growing up in Saudi Arabia?\n\nAimen Dean Well, I must remember, you know, how Sayyid Qutb wrote these books. I mean, there is a book called Fi Zilal al-Quran, which means \"in the shades of the Qur'an.\" And this book was written over nine years period, because it covers the entire Qur'an. It's – it's – it's a commentary on the Qur'an. But not from a theological sense, but from a literary sense, from an inspirational sense. And he wrote that book, four thousand pages when he was in prison, over nine years. And Nasser's prisons in Egypt in the 1950s and '60s were no picnic. I mean, they were exceptionally hard, harsh, dark prisons.\n\nThomas Small And so, how—? Why – why would these [unintelligible]? Why would these words, these four thousands have spoken to you?\n\nAimen Dean Because they were written through the prism of pain. And the pain wasn't just only about his own pain being inside prison and isolation and, you know, living sometime, you know, in a scary cell where he was doused with animal fat and let loose the dogs on him to bite him, or, sometime, basically, he would find, you know, snakes, you know, coming into his cell. So, of course, all of these dark, scary moments for him were reflected in his writings, where he turned that suffering into something that was of – of immense literary beauty. So, he spoke from the heart to the heart.\n\nThomas Small And he spoke to your young heart?\n\nAimen Dean Indeed.\n\nThomas Small Put – put – put me in your head at that time. What what's going on in your head?\n\nAimen Dean There were so many things going on inside of my head, because, you see, I grew up in Saudi Arabia. My mother was Lebanese. So, in the 1980s, she was worried about her family back home suffering the effects of the civil war in Lebanon.\n\nIt was a ethnic and sectarian and religious civil war.\n\nThomas Small And sort of in microcosm what – what – what one can see now em- – embroiling the whole Middle East.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. And I was living in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia where, just across the water from us, to the north, we have a raging brutal war between Iraq and Iran that was also both ethnic and sectarian. And then, later when I was only twelve, you know, just before my mother's death, I saw that my city, Khobar, was swamped with the world's wealthiest refugees. You know, basically, refugees arriving in their Cadillacs and Mercedes-Benz and BMWs from Kuwait.\n\nThomas Small From Kuwait.\n\nAimen Dean Because, you know, Saddam Hussein just invaded Kuwait. And, of course, Kuwait is – had a fabulous rich lifestyle. Suddenly, they found themselves refugees, even though they were in a riding Mercedes-Benz and BMWs and Cadillacsm, you know.\n\nThomas Small And shortly thereafter, then your – your – your area's swarming with American\n\ntroops.\n\nAimen Dean Oh, Humvees everywhere. And, you know, we used to have some American fast food chains. You know, basically, we have to stand in line way behind these, you know – you know, very hungry, you know, American soldiers basically who were or- ordering four burgers and ten fries, you know, apiece.\n\nAimen Dean It's – it's amazing to think you over there in Khobar watching the Humvees arrive and these big American soldiers. 'Cause in America, I was being told, \"Saddam Hussein is gonna come get us. He – he's probably got nuke – nukes. He's going to kill you all.\" And we would have on the radio: \"I'm proud to be in America or, at least, I know I'm free.\" It was this big thing. We were all like, \"Get Saddam. Get Saddam.\" And there you are having to, you know, queue in line while the Americans get their burgers first.\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely. And, you know, we thought, basically, \"This is unfair.\" But, you know – you know, it shows basically how, at the time, Americans – American soldiers were leaving their weapons and their Humvees, parking in the normal streets, going into a Saudi, you know, based burger chains and mixing with us and having no fear of us whatsoever. Whatsoever. I mean, basically, you cannot imagine this in this world anymore, you know. And they were there because we saw them basically as some sort of guarantee that Saddam Hussein is not going to venture south and capture the oil fields of the eastern province of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThomas Small So – so, in general, you were pleased that they were there. You felt they were protecting you. Because, as we all know, in a way King Fahd of Saudi Arabia's decision to invite the Americans in was the fateful decision that led to some kind of ideological justification for al-Qaeda and similar groups and their antipathy to the Saudi Royal family to America's presence in the Middle East and so on.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. You see, this is where my conflict began. You know, Osama bin Laden did not like one bit the presence of those troops inside Saudi Arabia. Not one bit. And he was trying to convince the Saudi Royal family, \"Please do not invite the Americans. Let us, the Mujahideen, sort this out.\"\n\nThomas Small And he was able to get the ear of the Saudi Royal family, because, as a Mujahid in the Afghanistan war, he had developed close contacts with the Saudi government at the highest level, including the fact that, as a member of the prominent bin Laden family, he was well-known. Would have Osama bin Laden's Mujahideen been able to take care of this situation, expelled the battle-hardened Iraqi army from Kuwait? Surely not.\n\nAimen Dean Well, come on. Of course, basically, there was no way this would be sorted out by the Mujahideen. It needed American firepower.\n\nThomas Small Why not? The Mujahideen had sorted out the Soviet Union?\n\nAimen Dean Yeah. In a long, protracted, eleven years war. No [crosstalk].\n\nThomas Small In the mountains, not in the—.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly. Not in the desert. And Saddam Hussein's army was eight years veteran army of the Iraq-Iran war. And, plus, at the same time, basically, they were a different cookie altogether. So, here, however, you know, this is where the conflict began. Because, basically, I was already part of Islamic awareness circles. There were already religious clerics who I listened to, I – I respected, adhered to. These clerics were giving lectures and talking about their displeasure with the presence of the Americans. So, on one hand, I'm happy they are there. But on the other hand, I have a loyalty to my clerics and my clergy, who basically were not very happy about these Americans being there.\n\nThomas Small So, there you are. You're conflicted. On the one hand, the American troops are protecting you. On the other hand, all of these radical clerics are – are encouraging you to be very displeased about their presence. What is the through-line from that place of conflict two, three or four years later you deciding to go to Bosnia as a young jihadist?\n\nAimen Dean Well, after the Gulf War ended and Saddam Hussein was expelled from Kuwait, there was another event basically that really propelled me towards, you know, great – towards searching for a greater meaning, greater purpose, which was the passing of my mother. She was only forty-nine at that time. And it was a brain aneurysm that, you know, was – was so unforeseen. And for me, that event led me to delve deeper into the world of theology from the perspective of politics.\n\nThomas Small Why?\n\nAimen Dean Well, I mean, first of all, you are looking for a spirituality, but a spirituality basically that has a place in the world, you know, that shapes history.\n\nThomas Small But I still don't see the link between that and your mother's death.\n\nAimen Dean Because, remember, my mother was my moral compass and, basically, she is the one who actually I would say politicise me because of her worry about the Lebanese civil war.\n\nThomas Small I see.\n\nAimen Dean You know, the effects of that on the sectarian and ethnic harmony of the Middle East. Or lack of harmony, I would say. So, my political educator is gone.\n\nThomas Small Do you think she would have supported your decision to go to Bosnia as a\n\njihadist?\n\nAimen Dean Oh, I would say basically she would have confiscated my passport, locked me up in a room until, basically, I came back to my senses.\n\nThomas Small And did you know that – that you would have been going against her wishes by doing it?\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. But I was interpreting that in my mind as it was her wishes as a mother, not her wishes as someone who have a duty towards fellow Muslims.\n\nThomas Small So, you lost your moral compass and the ideology of the Mujahideen provides you with a replacement, which allows you both to get some sense of spiritual fulfilment and allows you to pursue a path with real political ramifications.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed.\n\nThomas Small And what – what, at that time, in your mind, what political ramifications were you pursuing?\n\nAimen Dean Well, of course, the Bosnian conflict was raging. I remember one of my own teachers, our beloved math teacher–—his name was Osama [name]; ironically, another Osama—you know. died in Bosnia. And, you know, we were thinking, you know, first of all, Bosnia, why, you know, what is happening, you know, so suddenly the conflict in Bosnia that was raging for a few months already became a reality in our classroom, even though it was, you know, three thousand kilometres away. And I remember another fellow teacher of his, when he came to our classroom in order to, you know, give us or attempting to give us, you know, what he thought was counselling, you know, he, you know, answered one of the questions as to why would a young man with a life – a full life, a wonderful life, you know, potentially rich life ahead of him, would go and, you know, die somewhere else for people we hardly know.\n\nAimen Dean Why would he?\n\nThomas Small And he said that because it is our duty to help those fellow Muslims who are in desperate need. And, sometimes, if you don't do it, then who will do it? And then, he talked about the fact that it doesn't matter if you come from a rich family or a poor family, from a middle class or from an upper class. What matters in the end is your willingness to sacrifice. And in the case of our teacher, his sacrifice would have tasted far sweeter, because he had it all and gave it all away. So, the words [unintelligible]. Sacrifice, jihad, Bosnia. All of them started to resonate, because it was in our own classroom. So, that was the first trigger, you know, for me as far as I'm concerned, that Bosnia is a place where I could go. Because if my teacher who was standing in front of that blackboard was able to go there, fight, and die there, then, why couldn't I? I remember when I turned sixteen, I was having a dinner with a friend of mine. And, in fact, his brother was even a closer friend of mine. So, I remember I was having a dinner with his brother, and he was telling me, \"Did you say goodbye to Khalid?\" So, I looked at him and I would say, \"Why would I say goodbye to him?\" So, he just realised, \"Oops.\" You know? \"I'm not supposed to have told you this.\" But then he told me that Khalid actually is living to Bosnia within a week. So, you know, he's sorting out his affairs. \"And so, if you want to say goodbye to him, go and say goodbye.\" There were ten minutes, you know, walk, you know, from that dinner place to Khalid's house. My plan was to say goodbye. By the time I knocked on his door, my plan has changed. I told him, \"I'm going to go with you.\" And I still remember basically he's looking at me and thinking, \"Come again. What did you say?\" I said, \"I'm going with you.\" He said, \"No.\" You know? \"For God's sake, Aimen. Do you know, basically, the jihad is not a picnic? It's a war. People lose lives, limbs, get injured so badly. I mean, it's scary. You know, shells landing, bullets whizzing by. It's not going to be a picnic.\" So, I said, \"Yeah, I know. I mean, I know basically that it's not going to be something easy or, you know—. But I, you know, I really want to go.\" And he said to me, \"Yes. But, Aimen, you know – you know, you're sixteen. Bespectacled, bookish, nerdish, geek-ish, boy. Like, I mean, why would you go?\" You know? \"Do you think the jihad needs you?\" And I remember that my answer to him changed his mind and changed my life. I said to him, \"I know, Khalid, that the jihad doesn't need. But I need it. So—.\"\n\nThomas Small You need it for?\n\nAimen Dean For my own betterment. For my own spiritual betterment. For my own place in history. For me not being a spectator on the side line, just watching the caravan passing by and, later years, regretting that I never hopped on that caravan and went with them into that journey. Not just only to explore, you know, what is there at the very end, but beyond it, which – which means the afterlife.\n\nThomas Small Well, certainly, your journey took you in places you never foresaw. But also, I think the journey of the jihadist movement went in places that no one could foresee. So, you know, you joined the Mujahideen in Bosnia for, let's – let's face it, noble aims. Bosnian Muslims were being slaughtered by Serbs and Croats, and you went to defend them. But how do you go from that? How does a movement go from that to the morning of September 11th, when men fly airplanes into a building in America and kill civilians? Who are they defending? What – what—? When – when did jihadism change from the characters at the end of Rambo III and The Living Daylight to the 9/11 hijackers and Osama bin Laden. What happened?\n\nAimen Dean What happened, Thomas, was Bosnia. Bosnia happened. You see, many people don't understand that Bosnia was the fork in the road that separated now the jihadist from the west, where the interest diverged, where the ideological alliance that happened during the jihad against the Soviets completely disappeared. And, basically, the west went in one direction and the jihadist went into the other. What happened in Bosnia is that the war was ugly. It was genocidal and it was over identity, a Muslim identity that was attacked with the intention of annihilating it. And what was shocking for us is that the Muslims of Bosnia looked nothing like, you know, the Muslims in the rest of the Muslim world. They were, you know, blue- and green-eyed. They were blonde-haired. They were fair-skinned. Except that, you know, they didn't look any different from their Serbian neighbours. In fact, genetically even, they are the same.\n\nThomas Small South Slavs. They all speak the same language, basically.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly. They spoke the same line. They intermarried actually before the war. You know, they looked like each other, but except, the difference where in the names only in. Because even Muslims lived under communism in Yugoslavia for seventy years. They almost – almost became indistinguishable in there.\n\nThomas Small It was a secular state. They didn't [crosstalk].\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely.\n\nThomas Small There's not much religiosity going on.\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely. Only that their names were Ahmed and Mohammed and Mirsad or, you know—. So, they – they had these Muslim names. And, basically, slaughter was happening based on your name. If your name is Muslim, that's it. You're done. And that is what shook us to the core. That if Muslims who had only just their names, the remnants and, you know, the mosques, which served more like ornaments, you know, rather than an actual place of worship.\n\nThomas Small But what does it have to do with flying planes into the World Trade Center?\n\nAimen Dean For the jihadist there, they believe that the war was taking on a Christian symbology against Islam. This is a new crusade. So, the language in which the jihadists were framing this conflict and the narrative they were putting together was that this is a new crusade. So, this is the Christian world. It's not just only the Serbs with their nationalism masquerading as Christianity, you know, slaughtering Muslims. No. No. No. No. This is a Western—American, British, French—enabled genocide against Muslims, which was, of course, far from the truth.\n\nThomas Small But that's total nonsense.\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely.\n\nThomas Small They must have known it was nonsense. That's a cynical way of describing what was going on in Bosnia, because they were already convinced that the Americans were an evil empire that needed to be destroyed.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly. But, of course, when I went there to Bosnia, how would I have known that our leaders will be Jemaah Islamiyah, Egyptian Jemaah Islamiyah who actually killed Sadat in 1981 because of the fact that he signed the peace treaty with Israel. So, of course, they were the enemies of peace. But I did not know that. I was only sixteen. I went there thinking I was going to do something noble. And this is the problem, is that you have a noble cause, but then it's led by the wrong leaders who basically use it in order to manufacture a narrative that there is a greater conflict. For me, now with hindsight years, he is later, I realised that the Serbs were fighting a nationalist war. Yes, they cloaked their nationalistic cause with Christian symbology. But it was enough to fool the naive young men from the Arab world who came to fight in Bosnia that it is a crusade. And they then turned their hatred against America, because they believed, by the end of the war that the Americans are rewarded the Serbs with half of the Bosnian territory, even though there were only one third of the population. You know, they rewarded their genocide by having this in a half-baked peace treaty between the two – the three sides—the Bosnians, the Serbs, and the Croats. So, how Khalid Sheikh Mohammed—we come back again to him—the architect of 9/11, when he arrived in Bosnia, just only, you know, several weeks before the date and agreement was signed, he was telling us that the conflict is about to end, because, already, the negotiations are taking place. There is a truce. There is a ceasefire. \"And remember brothers—.\" I remember his words. He said, \"Remember, brothers. Why do we allow the Americans and other world powers to dictate where we fight? Why are we running from one fringe conflict on the fringes of the Muslim world from a Bosnia to a Chechnya to a Kashmir, and we keep fighting in these conflicts and we leave the centre? It's the centre of the Muslim world that is so weak that actually allowed the fringes of the Muslim world to suffer so greatly in these conflicts. So, we need to reclaim the centre, reshape the centre, remake the centre, and recreate the glories of the Muslim caliphate.\"\n\nThomas Small That get us to the – the question, the important question of what al-Qaeda really wanted to happen following 9/11. What did they think was going to happen? So, they run—. They fly two planes into the World Trade Center. They elicit this massive response from the great global hegemon, the United States, which they hope will get bogged down in Afghanistan, will be become bankrupt, will upset the local population in America to turn against the government so that America would withdraw from the Middle East, leaving it open for the Mujahideen to topple governments like the Saudi government, relay claim to the heartlands of the Muslim world from which they could then spread out and conquer the Muslim world in order to return it to the glories of – of the past. That's basically the – the narrative?\n\nAimen Dean No. The—. It's—. I would say basically, like, you are half right. But it's not about forcing the Americans to leave the Middle East. Actually, it is inviting the Americans to come to the Middle East. Again, we come back to the bulldozer analogy. You know, they saw the Americans, not as, you know, a stability factor, but instability factor. Bringing the Americans to be the bulldozer that will bulldoze Iraq. Why Iraq was important and why it needed to be bulldozed, because Saddam Hussein was the last standing pillar of Arab nationalism. And Arab nationalism was the last hurdle in front of Islamism as an ideology.\n\nThomas Small The last secular ideology in the Middle East.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly. The least the last hurdle in front of an Islamist takeover. So, doing 9/11 enticed the Americans to go into Iraq, because, already, as we talked about before, Abu Mus'ab al-Suri saw that the American administration might be actually tempted to go into Iraq if there was a massive attack, you know, on American soil. You know, and bin Laden particularly chose deliberate all the hijackers—not the pilots, the hijackers—to be from Saudi Arabia. Because what is the biggest target for Osama bin Laden? Always—.\n\nThomas Small Saudi Arabia,\n\nAimen Dean Saudi Arabia.\n\nThomas Small From 1995, I think, his first war against the house of Saud.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly. And, you know, in 1996, when he landed back from Sudan into Afghanistan, we went to meet him. You know, we were in a camp not far away from where he was, forty-five minutes drive. And I still remember when we met him at the first time, when he arrived from Sudan, he looked dishevelled. He looked like a refugee. Many people who saw some of, a lot of them for the first time, they see this neat turban, you know, nice robes, well, you know, ironed, no crease in them whatsoever. No. The Osama bin Laden I met for the first time in August of 1996 looked like a refugee. Along with his al-Qaeda followers.\n\nThomas Small He – he was a refugee.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly. He's just lucky to be escaping with his life and he was in compound belonging to another Afghan warlord. It wasn't his. You know, all of their belongings are still basically in boxes and metal boxes, and it's all around, you know, in a disorganised way. So, when we sat with him, there were fourteen of us. When we sat with him, because he was asking if there are any people from Saudi Arabia [unintelligible]. Of course, basically, that's why we went to see him. So, he was talking to us and he was telling us about how God brought him from Sudan into Afghanistan. And I was thinking, \"Are you trying to comfort yourself here? I mean, isn't it the fact that you were stabbed in the back by President Bashir of Sudan and his ally, Turabi.\" And, you know, and then he started talking about prophecies. And he started to weaponize eschatology, Islamic eschatology, and the prophecies of old to justify that he is in Afghanistan, because Afghanistan is going to be the launch place for the army of the Black Banners that will liberate Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, all of these three holy cities, you know. So, of course, if you want to liberate Mecca and Medina, then from who? Because who is actually ruling over Mecca and Medina? The Saudi Royal family. And for him, he was talking about how the Americans are occupying the two holy places. That the land of Muhammad is occupied by the American forces and their presence in Saudi Arabia is an affront to Islam. I was thinking, \"Well, there are only fifteen thousand of them at the time, basically. I mean, the Saudi army is three hundred thousand. So, I don't think it wasn't occupation. It was just basically, you know, a form of, you know, protection and military cooperation.\" But, you know, don't tell this to them. He then went on to say, when he looked at our faces—. And bin Laden was so good at reading faces. He can read your expression and see if you are happy or sceptical, if you are convinced or not. So, he saw that bewildered looks on our faces, because now he's telling us, and still a foreign, alien idea to us, that we'll be fighting against Saudi Arabia, against our own people, against our own relatives who work in the security services. He said, \"Remember, when the Prophet Mohammed was escaping from Mecca, going on his dangerous migration trip to Medina, when he was escaping, Arab tribes put a huge bounty on his head, trying to prevent him from reaching Medina and establishing his, you know, early political society there. And when, finally, one knight caught up with him, the prophet confronted that knight, who was trying to get the bounty—he was trying to kill the prophet—he confronted him and he said that 'I will be reaching Medina, and my faith will reach the horizons from the east to the west, and the Persian empire will fall. And I see you'\"—he was talking to the Arab knight; his name was [Suraca]—\"'I see you Suraca wearing the crown and the bracelets of the Persian emperor.\" So, of course, you know, the knight was so sceptical. It's like, you know, \"You're a fugitive. You are a fugitive and you are threatening the might of Persia, you know, which no one has ever threatened this might before. It's a mighty empire.\" And he said, \"It's either you're crazy or you're truly telling the truth. So, if you are telling the truth, then I want it in writing.\" So, the Prophet Muhammad, you know, instructed his companion to scribe, you know, for that night that he will be wearing the crown and the bracelets of the Persian emperor. Sixteen years to that day, it came true that, that knight was wearing the crown and the bracelets of the Persian emperor, and the Persian empire collapsed under the weight of the Muslim armies. So, bin Laden was telling us this story to restore our faith, to tell us that we could be refugees now, but we could change history. So, if you—. Thomas, if you see them as I saw them in 1996 and you can't believe that five years later, just only five years, these people, these bunch of refugees will change world history and will launch the most audacious and deadly terrorist attack in human history.\n\nThomas Small And so much of what they calculated to happen did happen. The Americans went to Afghanistan where they remain bogged down. They did enter Iraq, participating in destabilising the political patchwork of the region.\n\nAimen Dean Yes.\n\nThomas Small Of course, the jihadists that she had assisted them in that. They did withdraw their troops from Saudi Arabia, moving them to Qatar.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed.\n\nThomas Small And nothing has been the same. But nonetheless, still Osama bin Laden, his goal, ultimately, was political power. Once the house of Saud was toppled, once the Americans had done their dirty work for them and destabilised the region and then withdrawn, so the region is – is now, you know—. There's tremendous power vacuum opening up, Osama bin Laden imagined himself with the crown of the Persian emperor on his head. Do you think that's what he wanted?\n\nAimen Dean I think he wanted the restoration of the caliphate. He believed in eschatology. He believed that he was one of those foretold in the prophecies that would be paving the way for the Mahdi. You know, the Messiah. So, basically 9/11, not only have, you know, eschatology behind it, messianic vision behind it, and, you know, a political vision behind it, and ideological vision behind it, but also what was ultimately the aim and the goal is creative chaos. That chaos that should reign over the entire region to allow the forces of Islamism to take over. Because he saw what happened in Afghanistan after the civil war between the Mujahideen and the collapse of law and order and the raise of the warlords. That chaos was what enabled the Taliban to take over the entirety of Afghanistan except for a small pocket in the north. You know, so, he saw that chaos will make people yearn for law and order. And the only people who can give law and order based on Sharia are who? The Mujahideen.\n\nThomas Small When I was growing up an evangelical in California, it was absolutely an article of faith to us all that the world was coming to an end soon and that the prophecies in the book of revelation at the end of the Bible—\n\nAimen Dean [unintelligible].\n\nThomas Small were coming true through, at that time, the clash between the divine United States and the godless Soviet Union. And we were all told, absolutely, that there was no real need for us to dream about our future careers or our future lives, because it was going to happen. The end of the world was nigh. Ronald Reagan was acting as a vehicle for God's power by destroying the Soviet Union, and the state of Israel was a sign that Christ was going to return. And I mean, that sort of thing that was populating my mind as a kid, was that also in the air of these jihadist camps? Did you think the end of the world was soon?\n\nAimen Dean Wow. I mean, you just mentioned, you know, the state of Israel. And now, I'm thinking, \"Wow.\" Why? Because, you know, in, you know, in summer of 1997, when the head of bin Laden's bodyguard, [name]. He was trying to recruit me into al-Qaeda. And, you know, he was walking with me and telling me about the age of prophecies and how these prophecies, which Osama bin Laden spoke about a year area and I heard him talk about them, he was adamant that we are in the age of prophecies. And if we don't fulfil them, then who would do? Aliens from Mars coming down to do it for us? No. It would be us. So, I told him, you know, \"Okay. How do you know that we are living in the age of prophecies?\" He said, \"Because the age of prophecies.\" And the trigger was the return of the Jews to the Holy Land.\n\nThomas Small How fascinating. It's the same thing.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly.\n\nThomas Small Although, of course, as a Christian, we thought that that was a good thing, 'cause, you know, the – the Jews are still the chosen people and Israel is theirs.\n\nAnd, you know, of course, we didn't care about Muslim claims or Arab claims on Israel at all.\n\nAimen Dean Yeah.\n\nThomas Small They just seemed to be extraneous. We didn't even think about them, to be perfectly honest. But you're on the other side of the – of that story. You – you see it as a profoundly satanic sign that the end of the world is nigh. The Jews were turning to Israel is a sign that the forces of darkness are gathering, which will incite the Mahdi to return and the end of the world to occur.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly. Because, you know, the eschatology taught in al-Qaeda camps is that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land. And they don't date it from 1948, which is the establishment of the state of Israel. No, they date it from the 1967. Because in the six days war in 1967, Israel captured Jerusalem. So, for them, the – the – the Temple Mount, you know, the site where Al-Aqsa Mosque and the dome of the rock stands, the capture of that site is the trigger of the beginning of the end. So, that's how they see it. So, they say, basically, that the Mahdi, who's the Muslim Messiah, will emerge because—.\n\nThomas Small No. Let's be – let's be specific about that. The Muslim Messiah is Jesus.\n\nAimen Dean And—.\n\nThomas Small [crosstalk] Jesus.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed.\n\nThomas Small So, who is—? What's the difference between the Mahdi and the Messiah?\n\nAimen Dean Well, the Mahdi means \"the guided one.\" He's a saviour who would emerge to reunite the Muslim world. But the Muslim world the unification will trigger the return or the emergence of the antichrist, you know, who will lead the Jews and the Zionist Christians in a battle against Muslims, which will basically then, you know, lead to the descent of Jesus into this world in order to end this conflict on the side of Muslims. That's what we were taught in the camps.\n\nThomas Small And you believed it?\n\nAimen Dean At the time, I believed it.\n\nThomas Small Did it make you feel very excited?\n\nAimen Dean [unintelligible].\n\nThomas Small The end of the world. The age of prophecies.\n\nAimen Dean Well, it's not just only about the end of the world. You are doing God's work, you know. And you are here as a God's agent doing God's work.\n\nThomas Small And that included hacking people to death in Bosnia?\n\nAimen Dean That was included. You know, the idea basically was that you are here on earth as a God's instrument. So, when you tell people that you are here on earth as a God's instrument, what do you think they will do? Anything they do, basically, is sacrosanct, is basically something that is ordained by God.\n\nThomas Small But why in the mentality of jihadists—\n\nAimen Dean Mmhmm.\n\nThomas Small —is being an instrument of God, a license to kill people? Why is it that God wants people to be killed all the time?\n\nAimen Dean I think it's one of the most difficult questions that are hard to reconcile myself with. I mean, basically, how do we see this avenge-ful God who wants people to fight against other people? And I remember I asked myself this question so many times. And I remember that, in the Qur'an, there is a verse, which talks about war as a necessary evil, as war being the instrument of progress. You know, if you look at the Qur'an or how, you know, scholars of the Qur'an interpreted that verse, they're talking about the fact that we are put here on this earth as a test. Some of us will do good. Some of us will do evil. And those who do good will need to push against those who do evil or evil will reign. So, it is almost what [name] said before, that evil triumph when good people do nothing. So, in essence, war was ordained by God in order to ensure that the world will have peace or the security and stability and progress. The Qur'an described war as an instrument of progress.\n\nThomas Small As a Christian, though, I actually understand the logic of what you're saying and can see that on some level it is true, it is impossible for me to believe that that is something ordained by God. That God would actually wish young men to kill civilians in order to further His own aims. I mean, even in the – in the New Testament, Christ—.\n\nAimen Dean I don't believe that myself. [crosstalk].\n\nThomas Small No. I know you don't. I know you don't. But nonetheless, there is a – there is a sort of stark divide—\n\nAimen Dean Yeah.\n\nThomas Small —between the mentalities here.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed.\n\nThomas Small That in – in Islam, God uses violence to further His aims and, in Christianity, that idea that God would use violence any more, at least, to further His aims is – is – is very difficult to believe. Christ said, \"Offenses must come, but woe unto him through whom those offenses come.\" This idea that God knows that there will be evil in the world, that there will be violence war, et cetera. But the instruments for whom that violence occurs are never within his grace or whatever. It's very different.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. But you see, in from the Islamic point of view, we see ourselves nothing as an extension of the New Testament, but as an extension of the Old Testament. So, the God of Islam is identical to the God of the Old Testament, of the Torah, of the Tanakh. You know, of the Jewish Tanakh. Rather than, you know, of the Christian New Testament, the Christian Bible. Because you see, in – in Islam, the relationship between the individual and the Creator are far more complex, for example, than the relationship between the individual and the Creator in Christianity. And Islam, it is based on love, fear, and hope while, in Christianity, it's solely based on love, so.\n\nThomas Small Well, I think that's a simplification, to be honest.\n\nAimen Dean Yeah.\n\nThomas Small I think there's a lot of fear in Christianity, because God does send you to hell after all if you've been very bad.\n\nAimen Dean Yeah. Well, it's the same in Islam, except, you know, in Islam, basically the complexity of that relationship, it governs why we sometime have to go to war, not just only for defence, but for offense. And that's basically how, you know, al-Qaeda, for example, used up that. Because, you see, we come back to the issue here. Al-Qaeda uses violence. But there is a great divide within Islam right now, who has the prerogative to use violence? Is it the individual or the state? Throughout thirteen hundred years of Islam, we always, always understood that violence can only be deployed by the state. Whether in defensive or offensive measure, that's up to the state and up to the leaders of the state. But it cannot be wielded or be deployed by individuals or groups of things. The civil war within Islam right now raging over this very question between those who believe that jihad and violence can only be deployed by the state and those who believe no, not only can be deployed by individuals and groups of individuals, but it could also be deployed by them against the state.\n\nThomas Small Well, certainly, as a result of 9/11, all hell broke loose in the Middle East and a new chapter in the conflicts of the region opened. It's called the War on Terror. You played a role in that war. I certainly did not. I watched from the side lines like the rest of humanity. And that's what we're going to talk about in the next podcast, the War on Terror and what it was like as a double agent working both in MI6 and al-Qaeda in that war. And what I look forward to hearing about really having—. You've – you've – you've described so well the motivations and psychology of – of the jihadist, what they expected. It'd be interesting to hear as well next time what – what goes through the mind of a spy and whether those are actually quite similar, maybe. I don't know.\n\nAimen Dean Well, I look forward to having this discussion. I enjoyed it so much.\n\nThomas Small This episode of Conflicted was produced by Jake Warren and Sandra Ferrari. Original music by Matt Huxley. If you want to hear more of Conflicted, make sure you search for us on Apple Podcasts or wherever you download yours.\n\nCONFLICTED\n\nS01E02\n\nThomas Small Hello, everyone. Thomas Small with you again. In our last episode, we set the stage for the series by talking about the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Aimen Dean, my co-host, and I discussed what they meant for al-Qaeda, the jihadist group behind these attacks. We talked about why Aimen and others had felt compelled to join the jihad. We also got some insight into these events as Aimen saw them while working as a double agent for MI6. We left off by leading into what followed 9/11, the War on Terror, and what it was like for Aimen as al-Qaeda leaders became increasingly suspicious of its members.\n\nAimen Dean I remember, you know, someone entering into the kitchen, but I wasn't aware of who he was. And then, I realised basically that my other helpers in the kitchen left in a hurry. Before I was going to turn around distinctively, I felt the end of a pistol against my spine.\n\nThomas Small The War on Terror has been going on for eighteen years, but many people don't know the story well. 9/11 happens. Osama bin Laden, then safe and sound in Afghanistan, being protected by his Taliban allies, is suddenly met with a ferocious onslaught from the United States and its partners in the international coalition, which pounds the Taliban, topples their government in Kabul, and forces. al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and everyone else to leave Afghanistan. Some of them stay in AfPak, the mountainous region of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.\n\nSome of them stay under house arrest in Iran. Many of them flee to their home countries throughout the Middle East, regroup and begin slowly plotting attacks elsewhere in Saudi Arabia, in Iraq following the American invasion of that country, in Yemen following the smashing of the Saudi cells. And so, it goes on and on and on.\n\nWe'll try to unpack all of that for you. This is Conflicted.\n\nAimen, how are you today?\n\nAimen Dean Still alive.\n\nThomas Small Oh, still alive. That's saying somethings since there's a fatwā on your head.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed.\n\nThomas Small So, Aimen, people in the west often think that Islamist terrorism is primarily directed at the west and that the west are its primary victims. But as you know, as people in the know know, Islamist terrorism has been primarily directed at Islamic targets inside the Middle East, perhaps most explosively in 2003, when al-Qaeda launched its long-gestated ambition to overthrow the house of Saud and take control of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, its oil, wealth, and the two holy mosques in Mecca in Medina.\n\nEighteen years now since the launch of the War on Terror, Aimen, what do you think? Has it been overall a success? Has it been worth it morally? Strategically, were we right to wage it?\n\nAimen Dean In my opinion, I think the War on Terror was necessary, but the way it was executed was abysmal. To make an analogy here, imagine if there is a swamp, a huge swamp—and I'm talking here about the Middle East and beyond—what do swamps attract? Mosquitoes. And mosquitoes spread malaria. So, the world powers, instead of draining the swamp—the swamp of injustice, corruption, lack of opportunities, alienation, you know, bad religious preaching and practice—so instead of draining that swamp, they were competing with each other on who will kill more mosquitoes. So, they just keep spraying the mosquitoes with anti-pet and all of that. They all just keep killing and killing, but the – but the swamp is there, giving birth to more mosquitoes.\n\nThomas Small But how can the Western powers drain that swamp? They don't rule the Middle East\n\nAimen Dean What is needed is a global effort in order to introduce better governance and, at the same time help the locals, both governments and people, find a way to drain that swamp.\n\nThomas Small Is it really a war at all? Do you think it's right to call the War on Terror a war?\n\nAimen Dean What does a wall really? It's just a campaign. You know, you could fight a war in many different settings. I remember when we were trained, you know, in the jihadist camps, there were different kinds of training for different kinds of conflicts. So, you have urban warfare, you know. So, they train you to fight in the cities. Then, there is mountain warfare where you are trained to fight in the mountains. And then, I remember, in the Philippines, we were told about jungle warfare. Also, basically, there were, you know, terror warfare where you are trained to be a bombmaker. You are trained on assassinations in urban settings. You are trained in ambush. Also, in urban settings, you are trained in taking hostages whether in planes or in cruise ships or in government buildings or hotels. So, of course, a war could take any shape and could take place in any environment.\n\nThomas Small Sure. But most people, when they think of a war, they think of a clash between armies, of course, attached to a nation state or a collection of nation states. This war, the War on Terror, is a bit different. Who are, in the ultimate sense, the combatants of this war? On the one side you have, what, the United States.\n\nAimen Dean Mmhmm. That's very simplistic way of looking at it. I would say that the War on Terrorism is fought between nation states and those who want to bring down nation states. So, we can't say that it's only the United States that is fighting the War on Terrorism. I would say that Turkey was fighting a war against its own terrorists, whether they were Islamist or the Kurdish PKK speaker. The Spanish fought against the Basque separatists. The Colombians fought against the FARC in Colombia. And what is the common denominator between all of them, is that they are what we call either paramilitary forces—they are not a legitimate military force; they are just paramilitaries—or they are insurgents or they are what we would call non-state players, NSPs. Or some people call them non-state actors, NSAs.\n\nThomas Small But, really, isn't it a war on Islamist terrorism, really? I mean, the – the world didn't come together to fight terrorism until its Islamic form attacked New York in 2001. So, it's really a war against Islamic terrorism. Why? What makes Islamist terror more threatening to the world?\n\nAimen Dean There is a good reason for it. And that is the fact that, in the case of FARC, ETA, the IRA, and many other separatists/insurgents/terrorists is that these groups were fighting localised conflicts. In the case of Islamic-inspired terrorism, it's a transnational phenomenon. It is actually cross border groups that are united together to bring down nation states, not just only in the Muslim world, but beyond. Islamic-inspired terrorism is one of the very, very, very few instances of history where a group is united around the identity of a faith that spans many, many continents and countries. And as a result, you end up in a situation where they're fighting against everyone. So, everyone must fight against them.\n\nThomas Small So, I can imagine why left-wing radicals, for example, might be fighting against the nation state. The internationalist Marxist ideology has long fought against nation states, since the nineteenth century. I can even understand why, in the twenty-first century, a kind of neoliberal globalist ideology would fight against the nation state or, at least, try to water it down. But the nation state clearly brings almost every blessing of the modern world, from education to security to finance, you know, banking. Why do the Islamist hate the nation state?\n\nAimen Dean The Islamists hate the nation state because the nation state is the biggest obstacle and hurdle in their path to establish Islamic caliphate. Because, you see, this is a problem with modern-day Islamism, is that they believe that having a caliphate fit a United Muslim nation is a obligation. And that couldn't have been farther from the truth.\n\nThomas Small What the hell is a caliphate?\n\nAimen Dean Okay. Imagine the Catholic world united under the Pope, not only in a religious sense, but in a political, social, and economic and military sense.\n\nThomas Small Sort of as it was, say, in the twelfth century.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly.\n\nThomas Small In Europe.\n\nAimen Dean Exactly. So, imagine the Pope, but not just only with the religious authority, but also with political economic, military, and social authorities. Imagine that, and that is basically what a caliph is. But there is a problem. This concept of the caliphate and the absolute authority entrusted in the caliph was really only viable within the Muslim world for the first two centuries, after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. It was exercised, of course. The four caliphs after the prophet. Then, the Umayyad Dynasty. And then, the first nine Abbasid caliphs. But after that, the Abbasid empire started to disintegrate.\n\nThomas Small And when you say Abbasid, I mean, I think the listener needs to imagine almost the stereotypical period of Muslim glory that's even sort of mythologised in a movie like Aladdin. The classic image of the grand turbaned figure on the throne, commanding armies across the world of noble warriors. That's the – the Abbasid caliph.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. Very good description. Very good description.\n\nThomas Small The – the Muslim empire of the – of the thousand and one nights.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. And for twelve hundred years after that, we never had that. We never had one single caliphate that encompassed the entire Muslim world. It's just disintegrated into clan-based or tribal-based or family-based kingdoms and fiefdoms and sheikhdoms.\n\nThomas Small Sure. But that fact alone doesn't necessarily mean the Islamist thinkers would stop hearkening back to the period when the Muslim world was politically united.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. But there is a problem, you see. If you look at Islam lamb as a whole, if we want to take the legalistic aspect of Islam, it splits into two parts. One part is ibadah, which means \"worship,\" and one part is muamalat. It means \"transactions.\" So, the majority of the Muslim scholars and theologians, they placed caliphate, not under a worship section of Islam, I know, that will make it obligatory. Actually, they put it under the transaction, you know, aspect of Islam, under muamalat [crosstalk].\n\nThomas Small Which aren't – which obligatory.\n\nAimen Dean They're not obligatory. They are just optional. I mean, whether you'll have a caliph or not as an optional thing. You know, at the end of the day, the fact that they say that the caliphate is a obligation, this is one of the biggest lies ever perpetrated on the Muslim people by Islamists in the twentieth and twenty-first century.\n\nThomas Small Nonetheless, these Islamists think, for sure, it is an obligation, and that is leading them to carry out the actions that they're carrying out. Now, what do they think will happen once this caliphate is re-established? Do they think a caliphate will usher in a period of glory and prosperity, or do they even care about that?\n\nAimen Dean Well, based on my experience and the fact that I spent more than twenty-four years in the Islamist movement—you know, since I was nine—I could tell you easily that we can bring in a thousand Islamists from different walks of life, whether they were violent Islamist, nonviolent Islamist, progressive Islamist, regressive Islamist. Bring them all together and asked them, \"What is the ideal caliphate? Give us an answer.\" Remember, there are a thousand Islamists. What we will get is ten thousand answers. I haven't yet met two Islamists who agree what form this caliphate will take, what shape it will take, what will it be providing the people? Is it going to be encompassing only the Muslim world? Is it going to go beyond that? Are they going to fight the perpetual, you know, never-ending conflict against the rest of the world to subjugate the world into Islam?\n\nAimen Dean It reminds me of my time at SOAS here in London, which is a famously left-wing university, talking to, you know, student leftists of the radical type and how, you know, when you ask them really, \"What do you think this grand proletarian revolution is going to result in?\" they – they could never really agree either.\n\nAnd let's go back. So, 9/11 happens. You're already in MI6. George Bush announces the War on Terror. America invades Afghanistan. But let's move in and focus in on your own experience. At the beginning of the War on Terror, as an MI6 double agent inside al-Qaeda, what were you given to do?\n\nAimen Dean Well, of course, basically before 9/11 and after 9/11, you know, my tasks, you know, differed sharply. Before 9/11, it was an exercise on building a matrix. So, understanding, you know, everything that we need to know about not just only al-Qaeda, but other two jihadist groups who are affiliated to it and orbiting the centre of al-Qaeda. So, before 9/11, I was supposed to know the locations of the camps, the leaders, the visitors, the recruits, their nationalities, where they come from, their names if we can get, their aliases. You know, recognise their pictures. Make sure basically we make all these connections. Then, we look into the network of safe houses, the – the bank accounts, the phone numbers, emails when – whenever emails were available all the time.\n\nThomas Small You're building – you're building up a comprehensive map of the terrorist entity before 9/11.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed.\n\nThomas Small After 9/11?\n\nAimen Dean After 9/11, it's all about looking at the cells. Before 9/11, we had one group concentrated in one country with a network of openly visible camps.\n\nThomas Small Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. So, that was easy. You know, that was easier. My – my task before 9/11 was easier actually than after 9/11, because—.\n\nThomas Small Because the – the group was shattered. It scattered to the wind. And now, you're dealing with underground cells of terrorists in how many countries?\n\nAimen Dean Several. I mean, you know, we're talking here about Lebanon and Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar. We're talking about, of course…\n\nThomas Small Pakistan.\n\nAimen Dean … the UK, France you know, and Pakistan, Iran. Then, after that, Iraq, of course. And Syria. So, the task was immense. If you remember, on the last podcast, I said basically that Abu Mus'ab al-Suri, bin Laden's deputy who died just two months after 9/11 by a US drone, he said to me, \"Stay in the UK. Stay in London. We will get in touch with you when we need you.\" Of course, basically, I had to be guided by that. So, you know, if you remember, I told you that my phone was ringing just an hour after the attack.\n\nThomas Small MI6 six called you up.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. And they told me to stay. And so, over the next three weeks, I felt like I was in a war room, because we were looking over satellite images of Afghan camps, the arial photographs of the cities, of the villages, of the encampments to pinpoint exactly the locations of weapon dumps, you know, a storage facilities. You know, the – the routes, basically they will be taking. The best time basically to launch raids against them. You know, so, it was all about discussing the military capabilities. How will they react in certain situations? So, actually, I became one of those who helped in military planning for a war, which wasn't, you know, my job description. But nonetheless, it shows you how fluid the situation could be.\n\nThomas Small And at that point, did you think this war will be a cake walk? Al-Qaeda's going to be destroyed in a matter of weeks, months? Did you know it would stretch on? You know, now what, we're in the eighteenth year.\n\nAimen Dean Well, I – I – I recall saying that the structure of the Taliban supported by al-Qaeda would fall within three to six weeks. And they fell within six weeks. But I said, \"And after that, the war will start.\" You see—.\n\nThomas Small The War on Terror?\n\nAimen Dean Yes.\n\nThomas Small Because then the structure, the state, the proto-state they created in Afghanistan would collapse eventually, because, you know, the might of the American firepower is just something that no nation state on earth, with the exception maybe of China or Russia, but no other nation states on earth could withstand. So, therefore, the structure itself will fall. But then after that, they always say, \"You can win the battle, but you can't win the war.\"\n\nThomas Small So, you America's military might can topple states very quickly. But as we've seen, it can't actually destroy terrorism. Why is that?\n\nAimen Dean Okay. Terrorism, at the end of the day, is a shadowy practice. It's shadowy tactic in which you can have groups of individuals split into hundreds of cells, you know, and they can operate in a network of safe houses, network of hidden valleys, cave networks even, and, you know, jungles or forests and urban settings. And therefore, how could you basically target these people when they have split into a hundred different entities? They are not an army standing before you where you can annihilate them with bombs. Yeah.\n\nThomas Small But the – the follow-up question is why would you employ an army to fight that war then?\n\nAimen Dean Well, the army is to make sure that these cells don't come together and form an army. So, the idea is you need to have presence to prevent them from taking over the state apparatus again. Look at what happened. I mean, the Americans withdrew from Iraq in 2012. By 2014, ISIS took over. You know, when you are fighting against cells, you need the ultimate weapon against these cells' information. And information and intelligence can only be gathered and obtained through three distinct channels. So, you have the first one, which we call reconnaissance, you know. You know, you have aerial footage, looking at the movement of people, detecting, you know, the presence of weapons. Suspicious vehicles moving around. Suspicious, you know, houses. You have lots of visitors who are all male, you know, wearing, you know, certain distinct items of clothing. So, that's [crosstalk].\n\nThomas Small And this reconnaissance, I imagine, is – is carried out under a certain fog of doubt. The person—. You know, the intelligence officers carrying out reconnaissance, they see shadowy figures moving here in their cars. They don't necessarily know that these people are terrorists or implicated in terrorism. They're just using hunches, gut instinct. How do they know to follow that car and not that car?\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. Yeah. And this is one of the purest forms of intelligence gathering, you know, and there was a true case of both drones and Apache helicopters following certain individuals in Iraq. And they were almost certain that the movement was suspicious. The cars were suspicious. And then, they looked at the individuals. They thought that they were carrying something, you know, that resembles an AK-47. It turns out to be actually cameras. They were journalists.\n\nThomas Small [crosstalk].\n\nAimen Dean They were local journalists and they were shot to pieces.\n\nThomas Small What's the second form?\n\nAimen Dean The second form is called \"signal intelligence.\" And in the intelligence circles, it's called \"SIGINT.\"\n\nThomas Small SIGINT?\n\nAimen Dean Yes.\n\nThomas Small All right.\n\nA; That is basically by intercepting phone calls whether it's landlines or mobiles, by intercepting emails, by intercepting text messages, by intercepting Skype calls or any form of other apps you use, as well as intercepting radio communication.\n\nThomas Small This is what the NSA in the states and GCHQ in Britain are doing.\n\nAimen Dean Absolutely. Spot on. That's exactly what signal intelligence is. And that is extremely laborious, because, you know, you're looking at twenty needles in a billion haystacks.\n\nThomas Small Amazing. I mean, can you imagine how many phone calls are placed every day across the world?\n\nAimen Dean Oh, billions. It is actually becoming more and more reliable form of intelligence gathering than it used to be in the past. Why? Because you are using algorithms. You know, and ironically, algo- – algorithms was invented by Muslim scholars. al-Khwārizmī, as you know.\n\nThomas Small It's the \"al\" at the top – at the front of the word that gives it away.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. \"al.\"\n\nThomas Small Like, al- – alcohol, ironically.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. So, funny enough, Muslims give the west the tools through which basically they can have fun, which is alcohol and, you know, basically…\n\nThomas Small Algorithm.\n\nAimen Dean …algorithm, so they can advance.\n\nThomas Small The Internet.\n\nAimen Dean Yeah. So, algorithms are very important in intelligence gathering, because you can put something called trigger words. And I was one of those people from the beginning, you know, from 2001 onwards, basically, who created lists, you know.\n\nThomas Small Of trigger words?\n\nAimen Dean Of trigger words.\n\nThomas Small Well, give us an example of the words.\n\nAimen Dean You know, at that time, of course, basically, you know, it's useless to tell people. Put \"Osama bin Laden,\" you know, basically, or put \"Muhammad Omar,\" or the \"Taliban\" or [crosstalk].\n\nThomas Small Because none would say these words if they were – knew what they were talking about.\n\nAimen Dean That's one. And two, basically there was—. There were millions of journalists and political commentators and ordinary people saying these words. In other words, basically, again, the haystack problem and the needle problem. So, you know—. So, therefore, you have to go deeper to actually, you know, get phrases that only jihadists would be speaking about. So, for example, instead of, like, you know, saying with \"Osama bin Laden,\" we will say, \" Sheikh Abu Abdullah.\"\n\nThomas Small Ah.\n\nAimen Dean So, now that's very unique.\n\nThomas Small So, \"Sheikh\" is the term that the jihadists use of Osama bin Laden because they respected him. \"Abu Abdullah\" is an Arabic—. It's called a kunya.\n\nAimen Dean Yes.\n\nThomas Small So, the eldest son of – of – of Osama bin Laden is called Abdullah.\n\nAimen Dean Yeah.\n\nThomas Small So, he's Abu Abdullah, the father of Abdullah. Sheikh Abu Abdullah. And only an intimate of Osama bin Laden would use such an expression.\n\nAimen Dean Indeed. So, I remember that was my first contribution. The first trigger phrase that went into signal intelligence apparatus, which is \"Sheikh Abu Abdullah.\" If anyone is using that basically on the phone or an email or in a text, then, you know, basically, that is a – that is a – a call or a person of interest. It needs to be logged and investigated. And then, we started on and on and again, you know. So, for example, adding titles of books. So, for example, if someone were to use the book, \"Al-Kawashif al-jaliyah—.\" Now, you know, I'm not going to bother translating this. But basically this book is written by Abu Mohammed al-Maqdisi, who is one of the pillars of the jihadist theology.\n\nThomas Small Palestinian?\n\nAimen Dean He's a Palestinian-Jordanian. And he's also a, you know, a comrade of Abu Qatada. You know, the famous cleric who was in prison present here in the UK for a while before he was kicked out. If I put the book that he wrote about justifying fight against Saudi Arabia—. That book was written in 1992, you know. But in 2002, ten years later, it started to be taken seriously and basically used as a recruitment tool to recruit people into al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia and beyond. So, I remember I decided, you know, that I should include it in the list of trigger phrases. That was amazing.\n\nThomas Small It was successful,\n\nAimen Dean It was successful.\n\nThomas Small It resulted in some real – some real intelligence.\n\nAimen Dean You know, the ground-breaking intelligence that led the Saudis, with the help of the British intelligence services, to actually track many inside the kingdom who were texting or emailing or calling and talking about this book, Al-Kawashif al-jaliyah. You know, it's like, \"Okay.\" When—. You know, they are so careful on the phone. And I've listened to some of these phone calls. They were so careful on the phone to talk about weddings and, you know, honey selling and, you know, buying vegetables.\n\nThomas Small It's all codes.\n\nAimen Dean Codes. Yeah. But then basically, when – when the other party is asking, \"Okay. How can I be sure that the contract is absolutely binding or good or decent or I'm going to be—. It's all legit under Islamic rules.\" So, they will say, \"Read Al-Kawashif al-jaliyah.\" You know? And that's it. This actually phrase triggers immediately, you know, that the call needed to be logged and then listened to. And then, they determine.\n\nThomas Small Traced?\n\nAimen Dean Yes.\n\nThomas Small People these days are particularly worried that SIGINT intelligence gathering contravenes rights to privacy, human rights. People are very uncomfortable with the idea that the government is constantly listening to all of our phone calls and scanning all of our emails. I suppose you think those people shouldn't worry that if you're not a bad guy, you've got nothing to worry about.\n\nAimen Dean I can assure you and I can assure you listeners that ninety-nine-point-ninety-nine percent of the entire population wouldn't utter a trigger phrase. You know, a UK grandmother, you know, calling her, you know, grandchildren, you know, in America, you know, would not be talking about Al-Kawashif al-jaliyah or Anwar al-Awlaki or his – one of his books or anything like that.\n\nThomas Small But what about filmmakers and journalists like me working in the subject matter? I mean, if – if – if GCHQ could search my Google search for all the number of jihadist, even in the Arabic language, jihadist terms that I've searched for. I suppose I'm on a list somewhere. I mean, they know – they know that I've gotten up to that and they scan all my emails?\n\nAimen Dean Well, of course, the signal intelligence is so sophisticated these days that it actually shows, you know, a pattern of research. It analyze your profile. It shows that basically that you are not, you know…\n\nThomas Small A threat.\n\nAimen Dean …a likely. That you are in the research business. Although, basically, there has been. I know personally the story of one of the academics in Kings College—you know, a UK national—who was traveling to the U S and he was banned from entering the country, because of many Skype calls he had with ISIS members who were inside of Syria.\n\nThomas Small For research purposes?\n\nAimen Dean For research purposes. But then, it's – it's a wholly different level that you are researching something and you are reading articles and you are watching videos. That's a different thing. But having phone calls and, you know, Skype calls with—. You know, proper communication, basically, with…\n\nThomas Small Known terrorist.\n\nAimen Dean …a known terrorist. That's – that's a different issue. That's—. Even if you're a researcher, you will still be subject to restrictions.\n\nThomas Small So, that's the second kind. SIGINT. We've had reconnaissance SIGINT. Now, what's the third kind of intelligence.\n\nAimen Dean Now, that is something basically that it was, you know, mostly my responsibility and responsibility of other people like me. It's called human intelligence or HUMINT.\n\nThomas Small HUMINT?\n\nAimen Dean HUMINT.\n\nThomas Small HUMINT?\n\nAimen Dean Yes. HUMINT. You know? So, human intelligence is the, you know, as we call it basically, is the second oldest profession in human history. The first one, basically, of course, is prostitution. But, you know—. And, you know, of course, basically, I find it extremely difficult likening [unintelligible], you know. I described spying and prostitution in the same sentence. But, you know, as the oldest professions that ever existed. But it's a classic—. It's, again, the classic human spy.\n\nThomas Small What sort of training did you receive in order to – to do this? I mean, you went from being a bomb maker for al-Qaeda to being – to being a double agent quite quickly. So, how did you learn the skills necessary to be an effective spy?\n\nAimen Dean Well, this is where it was, you know, at the beginning, nerve-wracking, because, you see, when I defected and started working for the UK intelligence services, I was only twenty. So, can you imagine by the age of twenty, I was already, you know, a qualified bomb maker for al-Qaeda and was one of their operatives. But here's the problem: Now, I need to be a spy against them. I'm going to be spying against them and, actually, for the next eight years, although I didn't know that. I thought, basically, it will be a year or two, and that's it.\n\nSo, the first worry I had, which is: How do I now maintain this double life? How do I maintain the veneer of jihadism and beneath that, you know, is really someone who, not just only despise them, but actually want to dismantle what they are building? So, the first training that MI5 and MI6 would give you is that be yourself. That's the first thing. No one should notice a change about you, you know. Just forget that life is changing around you, that you are changing your mind. You need to play that down so much to really repress it, because no one should notice that you're changing. Not only, you know, from your own words and use of terminology and phrases, but also from your facial expressions.\n\nThomas Small It's easy enough to tell someone, \"Be yourself.\" But I mean, how can you? How could you not give the game away? I feel that if I went back into an infamous terrorist organisation, having agreed to spy against them for their enemy, I would – I would have been sweating bullets the whole time. Shaking, looking down, looking nervous. How did you do it?\n\nAimen Dean Well, I remember when I first was told I would be going back to Afghanistan and, of course, basically, I will have to meet my fellow jihadist here in London, I sat down with, you know, several operatives on both MI5 and MI6. And what they were telling me was so interesting and so reassuring. They were saying, \"Look, you are already a spy and an operative. It's just you don't know it. You know, Aimen, they sent you on missions before. Al-Qaeda sent you on missions. Yes?\" \"Yes.\" I said yes. \"Okay. And these missions included traveling into, sometime, hostile countries like the UAE or, you know, Oman or Kuwait or Pak—. And even when you go into—. You know, when you enter into Pakistan, any Pakistani airport. When you leave a Pakistani airport, you know, you're always alert, you know, that you don't want to bring suspicion to yourself. You want to basically just pass through without being detected. Did they train you for that?\" I said, \"Yes. They gave me counter-intelligence and counter-surveillance courses, you know, in order to fool immigration officials, custom officials, border officials. You know, that was, you know, normal. It came with the territory.\" They said, \"Exactly. Use what they gave you. They already gave you the tools. Just use what they gave you against them. That's all you need to do. Imagine them as if they were border agents, you know, custom officials, immigration officers. Imagine them to be the same people that you need to avoid finding the truth about you.\"\n\nThomas Small And that assuaged your worries? That made you confident that you could do this?\n\nAimen Dean They told me, \"If you were able to fool Pakistani immigration and border officials, you can easily fool them.\" You know? So, they made it sound easy. In fact, it wasn't. But they made it sound easy. And this reassuring tone was extremely important. Remember, you know, British intelligence operatives, they are actually fore-, you know, foremost, trained psychologists. I mean, they – they are trained in psychology. They are trained in handling assets like me. So, reassurance is one of the most important things. And also, basically, knowing your asset, knowing the talents of your asset. If your asset was already trained by the target organisation, then that's even better.\n\nThomas Small When you see a show like Homeland or watch a James Bond film, to what extent does that come near the truth?\n\nAimen Dean It's as far from the tru"
