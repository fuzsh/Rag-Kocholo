        "text": "First: At the invitation of President Mohamed Anwar Sadat of the Arab Republic of Egypt, President Hafez al-Assad of the Syrian Arab Republic paid an official and fraternal visit to the Arab Republic of Egypt from December 18, 1976, to December 21, 1976.\n\nSecond: Egypt, both government and people, received President Hafez al-Assad with an official and popular welcome that reflects the deep relationship between the Arab peoples of Egypt and Syria, and the genuine feelings of brotherhood that Egypt holds for its sister Syria. It also reflects Egypt’s belief in the results of Arab unity, as well as the shared journey, goal, and struggle to achieve the objectives of the Arab nation: to liberate its land, recover its rights, achieve unity, and ensure a better future for its people, as most vividly and completely expressed by the glorious Ramadan War.\n\nThird: During the visit, the two presidents held discussions in a climate of complete understanding focused on the brotherhood between the two sister countries and a thorough understanding of the current stage of struggle, which makes Arab solidarity one of the strongest weapons of the Arabs in facing current and future challenges.\n\nFourth: Participating in the discussions from the Syrian Arab Republic were: Abdel Halim Khaddam, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister; Muhammad Haydar, member of the national and regional leaderships; Major General Naji Jamil, member of the national leadership, Deputy Minister of Defense, and Commander of the Air Forces; Fayyad Ismail, member of the National Progressive Front; Fawzi al-Kayyali, member of the National Progressive Front; Abdul Karim Addi, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs; Adib Malham, Minister of State for Presidential Affairs; Ahmed Iskander Ahmed, Minister of Information; Dr. Adib al-Dawoudi, Political Advisor to the President; and Dr. Mamoun al-Atassi, Head of the Liaison Office in Cairo.\n\nFrom the Arab Republic of Egypt, the participants included: Mohamed Hosni Mubarak, Vice President; Mamdouh Salem, Prime Minister; Ismail Fahmy, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister; General Mohamed Abdel Ghani el-Gamasy, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of War; Mohamed Hamid Mahmoud, Minister of State for Local Government, Youth, Popular and Political Organizations; Dr. Jamal al-Ateifi, Minister of Information and Culture; and Ambassador Jamal Mansour, Head of the Liaison Office in Damascus.\n\nFifth: During these discussions, ways to strengthen the unity between the two countries were examined, which historically has been a shield for the Arab nation against foreign schemes aimed at subduing, fragmenting, and undermining its sovereignty, security, and exploiting its resources. The two presidents discussed the current bilateral relations between the countries and instructed their respective agencies to immediately begin studying the status of relations in economic, social, cultural, and other fields, and to propose practical steps to expand and coordinate these relations. The presidents decided to establish a unified political leadership between the two countries.\n\nSixth: Regarding the situation in the Middle East, the two presidents reaffirmed their firm position and complete belief in the necessity of establishing lasting and just peace in the region, so that the Arab nation can move towards development and progress. They emphasized that such peace can only be achieved and sustained through the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab territories and the restoration of the Palestinian Arab people’s rights to return, self-determination, sovereignty, and independence.\n\nSeventh: The two presidents discussed issues related to resuming the Middle East peace conference within the framework of the United Nations, and the need for it to convene before the end of March to address the situation in the Middle East resulting from the ongoing Israeli occupation and denial of the national rights of the Palestinian Arab people. They reaffirmed their firm stance on the necessity of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s participation as an independent party on an equal footing with other parties in all negotiations aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace in the region, including the peace conference, as it is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian Arab people, according to the resolutions of the Arab Summit in Rabat. They stressed that the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East conflict, and that a just peace cannot be established without addressing and resolving it in a manner that guarantees the Palestinian Arab people the full restoration of their rights, including the right to establish an independent state on the land of Arab Palestine.\n\nEighth: The two presidents condemned all attempts to hinder and delay the peace process and called on the United States and the Soviet Union, as the co-chairs of the Middle East peace conference and given their responsibilities in the context of international peace and security, to promptly and clearly express their stance and intentions regarding peace in the Middle East based on the principles established by the UN Charter and its resolutions. They also called on the UN Secretary-General to immediately initiate the necessary contacts with the parties involved in the Middle East conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, to prepare for the peace conference in accordance with General Assembly Resolution 6162 of December 9, 1976, which received overwhelming support from its members. The presidents emphasized the importance of the Security Council’s role in establishing just and lasting peace in the region.\n\nNinth: In this context, the two presidents renewed their call to various countries providing assistance to Israel to cease such assistance, which entrenches the occupation and encourages Israel to continue plundering the resources of Arab land and people, and its practices contrary to human rights and international agreements. They expressed their appreciation for the positions of UN member states in supporting the just Arab position.\n\nTenth: The two presidents confirmed their shared commitment and determination for 1977 to be a year of action towards ending the occupation and recovering the rights of the Palestinian people, especially their right to establish an independent state. They declared that the Arab nation, in its tenth year of Israeli occupation and the thirtieth year of the usurpation of Palestinian rights, would use all its capabilities to end the current situation in the region, restore justice, return rights to their rightful owners, and restore sovereignty to its rightful holders, in line with the principles of the UN Charter and its resolutions concerning the Palestinian issue and the Middle East crisis.\n\nEleventh: The two leaders took this opportunity to salute the steadfast Arab people in the occupied territories who resist the ongoing occupation and struggle for liberation. They expressed their support for this people’s struggle while strongly condemning Israel’s actions in the occupied Arab territories, including changes to the demographic nature and geographical arrangement, and the exploitation of the resources of this Arab land. They clearly rejected all results aimed at being arranged by Israel based on these actions, and affirmed their position that such changes do not create any obligation or right due to the occupation. They reserved their right to seek fair compensation for all exploitation, looting, and changes made to this Arab land.\n\nTwelfth: The leaders emphasized the importance of Arab solidarity in all its meanings and the necessity of resolving disputes that disrupt the Arab atmosphere. They expressed their full determination to play an active role in this regard so that the Arab nation can unite towards achieving the highest goal of liberation, dignity, and progress. They called for the full and precise implementation of the Rabat resolutions regarding effective Arab political, military, and economic coordination, and the strengthening of the self-reliant forces of Arab countries to promote joint Arab action and a unified Arab journey towards a better future.\n\nThirteenth: The leaders reviewed the situation in Lebanon in light of the resolutions of the Riyadh and Cairo summits, based on their commitment to national and historical responsibility in enhancing collective Arab role. They welcomed the efforts made to end the bloodshed in this brotherly Arab country and expressed confidence that national unity in Lebanon would be achieved to rebuild the country in a way that ensures Lebanon’s unity—land and people—and continues to support Palestinian steadfastness.\n\nFourteenth: The Arab leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the policy of non-alignment, which brings together the forces struggling for liberation and progress, and rejects domination and spheres of influence. They saluted the peoples and countries of non-alignment that have always supported justice and liberation issues. They appreciated their steadfast support for the Arab cause.\n\nFifteenth: The leaders expressed their absolute support for the struggles of African peoples against racism and minority rule. They supported the struggles of Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa for their national rights. In this context, they expressed their hope to deepen Arab-African cooperation in all fields and welcomed the upcoming Arab-African summit scheduled to be held in Cairo in March.\n\nSixteenth: The leaders also expressed their firm stance within the Third World movement and its struggle for a new international economic system that is more just and stable and takes into account the rights and interests of developing countries."
