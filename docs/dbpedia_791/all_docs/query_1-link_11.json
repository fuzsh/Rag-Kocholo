        "text": "Syria expressed confidence today that a peace deal with Israel could be concluded quickly, perhaps in a matter of months.\n\nThe statement by the foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, who is to head Syria's delegation to the talks in Washington this week, was Syria's first official reaction to the announcement that he would meet Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel. From a government that has made caution its mantra, Mr. Shara's buoyant demeanor seemed a startling departure.\n\n''I am so optimistic to say that a few months could be enough to reach a peace agreement,'' the foreign minister said. He said Syria regarded the meetings as ''a very important moment in the history of the peace process,'' and added, ''We think we can achieve genuine results within a short time if all the parties have the good intentions.''\n\nThis week's negotiations, scheduled to last two days, will be the highest-level negotiations ever between the two sides, whose conflict has lasted for more than a half-century.\n\nLate tonight, Israel radio also quoted Mr. Barak as saying at a gathering of his cabinet ministers that ''it is possible to complete negotiations with Syria in very little time, perhaps in a few weeks.''\n\nThere is a sense of expectation surrounding the planned talks, which will mark the first time in 45 months that the two sides will meet face to face. President Clinton said over the weekend that the issues dividing Syria and Israel were not as great as those in other Middle East disputes.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
