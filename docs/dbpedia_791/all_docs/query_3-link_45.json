For more information on Article Processing Charge (APC) please see Article Processing Charges document.​\n\n|In case of problems, please contact the Assistant Managing Editor by email: AssistantManagingEditor@degruyter.com.\n\nEDITORIAL POLICY\n\nThe journal uses a closed single-blind peer review system.\n\nUnpublished material:\n\nSubmission of a manuscript implies that the work described is not copyrighted, published or submitted elsewhere, except in abstract form. The corresponding author should ensure that all authors approve the manuscript before its submission.\n\nEthical conduct of research: The authors must describe and confirm safeguards to meet ethical standards when applicable. See Editorial Policy for details.\n\nConflict of interest: When authors submit a manuscript, they are responsible for recognizing and disclosing financial and/or other conflicts of interest that might bias their work and/or could inappropriately influence his/her judgment. If no specified acknowledgement is given, the Editors assume that no conflict of interest exists. Authors are encouraged to fill in the ICMJE Conflicts of Interest Form (available here) and send it in the electronic format to the Managing Editor.\n\nCopyright: All authors retain copyright, unless –due to their local circumstances –their work is not copyrighted. The copyrights are governed by the Creative-Commons Attribution Only license(CC-BY) which is compliant with Plan-S. The use of each article will be governed by the Creative Commons Attribution license. The corresponding author grants De Gruyter the license to use of the article, by signing the Open Access License. Scanned copy of license should be sent to the journal, as soon as possible.\n\nAuthorship: Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study. All those who have made significant contributions should be listed as co-authors. Where there are others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of the research project, they should be named in an Acknowledgement section. The corresponding author should ensure that all appropriate co-authors (according to the above definition) and no inappropriate co-authors are included in the author list of the manuscript, and that all co-authors have seen and approved the final version of the paper and have agreed to its submission for publication. For more details the role of authors please see: https://www.degruyter.com/publishing/for-authors/for-journal-authors/role-of-authors\n\nPeer Review process: The Editors reserve the right to decline the submitted manuscript without review, if the studies reported are not sufficiently novel or important to merit publication in the journal. Manuscripts deemed unsuitable (insufficient originality or of limited interest to the target audience) are returned to the author(s) without review. The Editor seeks advice from experts in the appropriate field. Research articles and communications are refereed by a minimum of two reviewers, review papers by at least three. Authors are requested to suggest persons competent to review their manuscript. However, please note that this will be treated only as a suggestion, and the final selection of reviewers is exclusively the Editor's decision. The final decision of acceptance in made by Managing Editor or, in case of conflict, by the Editor-in-Chief.\n\nScientific Misconduct: This journal publishes only original manuscripts that are not also published or going to be published elsewhere. Multiple submissions/publications, or redundant publications (re-packaging in different words of data already published by the same authors) will be rejected. If they are detected only after publication, the journal reserves the right to publish a Retraction Note. In each particular case Editors will follow COPE's Code of Conduct and implement its advice.\n\nSee Editorial Policy for details.\n\nSUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS\n\nCover Letter\n\nIt is important that authors include a cover letter with their manuscript. Please explain why you consider your manuscript as suitable for publication in the journal, why will your paper inspire the other members of your field, and how will it drive research forward.\n\nThe letter should contain all important details such as:\n\nyour full name (submitted by)\n\nfull title of article and short title\n\nfull list of authors with affiliations\n\ne-mail of the corresponding author\n\ncontact address, telephone/fax numbers of the corresponding author\n\nnumber of attached files, if there is more than one\n\nstatus: new, reviewed or accepted (with reference ID if reviewed or accepted)\n\nCover letter should explicitly state that the manuscript (or one with substantially the same content, by any of the authors) has not been previously published in any language anywhere and that it is not under simultaneous consideration or in press by another journal. If related work has been submitted, then we may require a preprint to be made available. Reviewers will be asked to comment on the overlap between the related submissions.\n\nManuscripts that have been previously rejected, or withdrawn after being returned for modification, may be resubmitted if the major criticisms have been addressed. The cover letter must state that the manuscript is a resubmission, and the former manuscript number should be provided.\n\nFormatting Requirements\n\nOur contributors are asked to make sure their submissions comply with rules governing the formatting. Although the journal can provide limited technical support, it is ultimately the responsibility of the author to deliver a properly formatted electronic version of the article.\n\nWe accept submission of text, tables and figures as separate files or as a composite file. For your initial submission, we recommend you upload your entire manuscript, including tables and figures, as a single PDF file. If you are invited to submit a revised manuscript, please provide us with individual files: an editable text and publication-quality figures.\n\nText files can be submitted in the following formats: TeX/LaTeX (preferable), MS Word - standard DOCUMENT (.DOC) or RICH TEXT FORMAT (.RTF); PDF (not applicable for re-submitted or accepted manuscripts, see below)\n\nTables should be submitted as MS Word or PDF (not applicable for re-submitted or accepted manuscripts, see below). Please note that a straight Excel file is not an acceptable format\n\nGraphics files can be submitted in any of the following graphic formats: EPS; BMP; JPG; TIFF; GIF or PDF. Please note that Powerpoint files are not accepted\n\nPost acceptance, text files of the revised manuscript and tables are required for use in the production.\n\nPost acceptance, text files of the revised manuscript and tables are required for use in the production. Authors are encouraged to use De Gruyter Open LaTeX template file.\n\nAuthors should clearly indicate location of tables and figures in the text if these elements are given separately or at the end of the manuscript. If this information is not provided to the editorial office, we will assume that they should be left at the end of the text.\n\nFonts: Only use Unicode fonts (e.g. Times New Roman, Arial).\n\nColored Text: Set the font color to black for the majority of the text. De Gruyter Open encourages authors to take advantage of the ability to use color in the production of figures, maps, images, and graphs. However, you need to appreciate that this will cause some of your readers problems when they print the document on a black and white printer. For this reason, you are advised to avoid the use of colors in situations where their translation to black and white would render the material illegible or incomprehensible.\n\nSymbols and abbreviations: The use of special symbols, abbreviations, and acronyms is permitted so long as they are defined upon first mention in the article.\n\nHeadings: Headings (e.g., title of sections) should be distinguished from the main body text:\n\nClearly indicate the heading hierarchy.\n\nBe consistent in whether or not you use headline case, or you capitalize the first word and leave the rest in lower-case.\n\nFootnotes: Footnotes and endnotes should be avoided. Allowable footnotes/endnotes may include: the designation of the corresponding author of the paper, the current address of an author (if different from that shown in the affiliation), abbreviations and acronyms.\n\nReferences: References should be listed and numbered in the order that they appear in the text. In the text, citations should be indicated by the reference number in brackets [1]. Multiple citations within a single set of brackets should be separated by commas [1, 5]. Where there are more than three sequential citations, they should be given as a range [1-4]. References in figure captions and tables should be listed after the references in the text. A complete reference should give the reader enough information to find the relevant article. Please pay particular attention to spelling, capitalization and punctuation.\n\nPlease, use Vancouver/ICMJE reference style, like below:\n\nhttps://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html#journals\n\nPublished Papers: Kulig, P., Zabel, B.
