        "text": "Updated, May 26, 2:20 p.m. | The Bits blog is providing live coverage of Mark Zuckerberg’s press conference announcing changes to Facebook’s privacy settings.\n\nThere have been growing complaints about Facebook, its privacy settings and disclosure of users’ personal information to third parties. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, made a new pledge this week to add privacy controls that are simpler to use.\n\nBut for lots of critics Facebook’s general opt-out approach isn’t enough. Fifteen privacy groups have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission seeking an investigation over possible deceptive trade practices. Senator Charles Schumer has urged the F.T.C. to provide guidelines for social networking sites, like Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter on how private information submitted by online users can be used and disseminated.\n\nWhat can government do to ensure that users have control of their own information, which might live on indefinitely on the Web? Would regulation work? Or should government stay out of this arena?\n\nEdward W. Felten, computer scientist, Princeton University\n\nMarcia Hofmann, Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\nClay Shirky, Interactive Telecommunications Program at N.Y.U\n\nWilliam McGeveran, law professor, University of Minnesota\n\nJim Harper, Cato Institute\n\nNot an Easy Call\n\nEdward W. Felten is a professor of computer science and public affairs, and director of the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University. He blogs at Freedom to Tinker.\n\nFacebook has built a successful business by helping people publish detailed information about their lives. Users expect some of these details to be public and others to be held more closely. It argues, reasonably, that adult users should be free to publish information about their lives if they choose to do so. But lately many users have come to doubt Facebook’s commitment to privacy. What should government do?\n\nThe case for government action is strongest if Facebook breaks its promises. If Facebook violates its own privacy policy or its promises to users, which it appears to have done recently, government should investigate and take necessary action to prevent further problems.\n\nIf the company changes its privacy promises retroactively — saying it will start using existing data in ways that were off limits when the user provided that data — government should be vigilant to make sure users are notified clearly and given an adequate chance to opt out. Beyond this (and how to protect kids on Facebook, a question I won’t address in this short comment), the case for government action gets shakier.\n\nWe Need a Social Networking Bill of Rights\n\nMarcia Hofmann is a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which focuses on individual rights in the digital age.\n\nAs Yogi Berra said, it’s déjà vu all over again. Facebook changes its service in ways that infuriate users and create an uproar over privacy. It apologizes and rolls back some of the changes, and users simmer down. Then the same thing happens a few months later.\n\nFor example, Facebook recently introduced a new round of changes to its service. One was the “Instant Personalization” feature, which shared information with other Web sites by default. Another was the “Connections” feature, which forced users to link personal information about their hometown, education, work history, interests and activities to publicly available pages, or else have it deleted.\n\nThese changes provoked an outcry among users, who had provided their information with the understanding that they would have control over who see it. In response, Facebook has promised to make its privacy practices better.\n\nWhat ‘Public’ Means Now\n\nClay Shirky teaches at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at N.Y.U. He is the author of the recent “Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations.”\n\nConcerns about Facebook’s privacy policies have to be divided into two categories: those concerns that are really about the Internet, considered as a whole, but which currently settle on Facebook as the dominant social networking service, and those concerns that are genuinely about Facebook.\n\nThe former category is the larger of the two — in much the same way as the music industry complained about Napster or the newspaper industry about Craigslist, when the real source of change was the Internet itself. Current concerns about privacy often attach to Facebook because it is the largest holder of personally contributed but putatively private data in the world. In many cases, though, Facebook is just the technological avatar of the medium, rather than being a cause of any change in privacy itself.\n\nThere are two principal effects of the Internet on privacy. The first is to shrink personal expression to a dichotomy: public or private. Prior to the rise of digital social life, much of what we said and did was in a public environment — on the street, in a park, at a party — but was not actually public, in the sense of being widely broadcast or persistently available.\n\nSave Facebook From Itself\n\nWilliam McGeveran, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School specializing in Internet and privacy issues, has written about legal responses to social media marketing techniques.\n\nOnce again, there is a privacy kerfuffle at Facebook. And once again, as on multiple other occasions when Facebook unilaterally changed the way it handles our personal information, some observers shrug and conclude that technology simply “moves too fast” for the law to handle. I don’t know which is more exasperating, Facebook’s tone-deaf approach to privacy or the defeatist chatter that follows.\n\nTo be sure, a detailed statute that’s oriented to the specific architecture of Facebook — or any other social media platform — would be a bad idea.\n\nIn most other industrialized countries, specialized privacy regulators lay down general rules of the road for the collection and use of personal information online. I don’t think the United States could or should import those regimes in full. But we should learn from that model rather than throwing up our hands in frustration.\n\nIf You’re Worried, Stay Offline\n\nJim Harper is the director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, the webmaster of WashingtonWatch.com and the author of “Identity Crisis: How Identification is Overused and Misunderstood.”\n\nIf consumers have privacy worries, they can simply decline to use social networks like Facebook, and many do. Facebook takes it in the wallet when a user signs off, or when a potential user fails to sign on.\n\nThis gives it the incentives it needs to tune its privacy settings consistent with public demand. Politicians and regulators should keep out of the negotiations between Facebook and the public, and focus on getting their own house in order first.\n\nIn fact, it’s ironic that Senator Schumer is taking aim at Facebook. He’s the chief sponsor of a proposal to create a national I.D. system that would be required for all workers — and eventually, no doubt, for all Americans."
