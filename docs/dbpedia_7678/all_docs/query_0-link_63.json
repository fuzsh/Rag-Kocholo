BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING: INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND CONSUMERS' EXPECTATIONS ---------- THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 2009 House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, joint with the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. The subcommittees met, pursuant to call, at 10:08 a.m., in room 2123 of the Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Bobby L. Rush (chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Comsumer Protection) presiding. Present from Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection: Representatives Rush, Weiner, Matsui, Space, Radanovich, Stearns, Whitfield, Pitts, Terry, Gingrey, Scalise, and Barton (ex officio.) Present from Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet: Representatives Boucher, Barrow, Welch, Inslee, Upton, and Buyer. Staff present: Amy Levine, Subcommittee Counsel; Jen Berenholz, Deputy Clerk; Timothy Robinson, Subcommittee Counsel; Michele Ash, Chief Counsel; Greg Guice, Subcommittee Counsel; Pat Delgado, Chief of Staff (Waxman); Will Cusey, Special Assistant; Sarah Fisher, Special Assistant; Anna Laiton, Counsel; and Roger Sherman, Chief Counsel. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BOBBY L. RUSH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS Mr. Rush. Today is a joint hearing of the Subcommittees on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, and Communications, Technology, and the Internet. And I want to welcome all of you to this hearing. And I want to just give you some advance notice that in about 20 minutes, we will be called to the floor for a series of votes. Some have estimated to be--we are scheduled for about 27 votes on the floor, which is certainly going to extend the hearing, and so we ask that you be patient with us. We will try to conduct this hearing and try to be very mindful of your time, but our actions will be dictated by the House schedule and by the votes on the floor. Now I want to recognize myself for 5 minutes of opening statement. As I indicated, today, the two subcommittees, Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, and Communications, Technology, and the Internet are combining our commitment to privacy and our resources to conduct an extremely important hearing on Behavioral Advertising: Industry Practices and Consumers' Expectations. And I just want to take a moment to thank Chairman Boucher for not only his cooperation and working together and teaming up on this particular issue, but I want to thank him also for his past championship and dedication to this very, very important issue. This is but one hearing along a continuum of legislative activity examining the domains of online and off- line consumer privacy and how companies handle and treat consumers' personal information. Most recently, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, which I chair, marked up H.R. 2221, the Data Accountability and Trust Act, a bipartisan bill, which addresses the security of personal information, breaches of that security, and corrects some of the resulting harms to consumers. I am hopeful that there will be more hearings. There are currently no federal laws specifically governing behavioral advertising nor do we have a comprehensive general privacy law. As members of Congress, we have anticipated for some time that this hearing would be highly informative and very valuable in helping us answer the question that everyone seems to ask, is federal privacy legislation necessary, or should companies be trusted to discipline and regulate themselves? At this hearing, I look forward to hearing from our very distinguished panel of witnesses about this growing trend of online behavioral advertising. Market research firms have estimated that behaviorally targeted ad spending will reach $4.4 billion by the end of 2012. That number is eye-opening as it translates into almost 25 percent of all the online display ad spending that is projected to be spent by year-end 2012. As prevalent as these ads are becoming, so too are the buzz road, which are purportedly needed to flush out the appropriate contents of fair information principles and practices. Words and phrases such as transparency, choice, notice, consent, consumer expectations, opt-in and opt-out seemingly mean different things to different speakers depending upon an array of variables. Such variables may include the identity of the user, whether he or she has registered with the visited Web site, whether the ads are being served by first or third party sites, the sufficiency and conspicuousness of pre-existing privacy policies and disclosures, the robustness of user- enabled settings for managing user privacy, and the list goes on and on and on and on. All of these variables are important to consider, but they can muddle the issue of whether legislation is needed. I will be listening intently to your accounts of how up front companies have been about the types of personal information that they are collecting from consumers, what they are doing with the information, and what choices and controls that consumers have over the subsequent use of that information. I want to thank all the witnesses for coming in this morning, for sharing with us, taking away from your busy schedule to provide input, much-needed input, into these matters that are before us today. And I want to thank all the subcommittee members and the staff for so diligently preparing us on this subcommittee for these hearings. And now I want to recognize for 5 minutes for the purposes of opening statement the ranking member, Mr. Radanovich. Mr. Radanovich is recognized for 5 minutes for opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Radanovich. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank you and Chairman Boucher and my fellow ranking member, Mr. Upton, on these hearings today. I think it is a good issue that we need to be talking about. Privacy continues to be an issue of increasing concern to consumers, and I am pleased that we will be looking at all the relevant issues to determine what the problems are and what possible solutions exist. What was once thought to be an issue limited to business with whom consumers had a customer relationship has been forever altered by the Internet. Progression and innovation in computer and digital technology over the last 20 years has transformed many aspects of our lives, and by the same token that progress has opened the possibility of potential abuses and invasions into our lives. In the connected world of the Internet where data is instantaneously accessible to anybody in the world, we have learned how vast amounts of sensitive consumer data can be inadvertently disclosed or subject to more malicious and intentional theft. We also know the main reason consumers should be concerned about the amount of personal information out there on the worldwide web is that sensitive personal information can be used for harmful purposes, particularly identity theft. Thankfully, we are addressing some of those concerns with the data security and breach notification legislation moving through the committee right now. Our oversight into the data security issue opened our eyes to the types of sensitive personal information many institutions ranging from businesses to government maintain about us. While information kept about us may be for legitimate reasons that mandate data retention, for instance, for law enforcement purposes most consumers do not fully understand how information gathered about us will be used or with whom it will be shared. These concerns are legitimate. What is more, these concerns over keeping personal information private are exacerbated by digital technology and the capabilities of Internet technology. Information that filled rooms of file cabinets in a paper-based business can now be stored in devices that attach to a key ring and can be sent over the Internet in seconds, making information theft easy and often untraceable. The ability to instantaneously collect, analyze, and store consumers' online behavior for marketing purposes stretches this dynamic even further. The Internet quickly evolved beyond its original purpose as a communication tool to become a means of commerce, education, and social interaction. A generation has been raised on the Internet with the ability to find information relevant to their interests and communicate in ways that we could not imagine only 10 years ago, and most expect these services to be customized for their preferences. But many of these technologies and practices that deliver high levels of customization present new challenges and concerns for consumers, primarily understanding what the trade-off is for these services. Do we need to relinquish personal information about ourselves and our Internet for the purposes of generating more user-specific advertisements in exchange for access to the information we seek on the Internet, and, if so, who has our access to this information? The Internet has been a successful tool for commerce and has benefitted consumers with convenience, choice, and savings. Relevant advertisements based upon user interests will be more beneficial to the consumer and business, which in concept is no different than the manner in which marketing research determines which advertisements are selected to be placed in magazines, newspapers or on television based on the intended audience. However, in practice the Internet is different because of its ability to track preferences on a minute by minute basis. The question is how advertisers engage in the process of identifying their potential target audience. Specifically, what information is used to generate targeted advertisements? I have a son who I would do anything to protect, and although I cannot monitor him every waking moment and prohibit his ability to access the Internet, nor would I want to, like any parent I want to trust that he will be safe to surf online and interact with his friends without being unknowingly monitored or profiled. While my son is in a vulnerable demographic millions of Americans of all ages spend time surfing, posting, and shopping on the Internet. How their information is used and what control the individual has over the collection of their information is at the center of the debate of whether we need a federal privacy law, and, if so, how it should be structured and what activities it will address. In the case of my son, I am concerned with the information being gathered and how it is used. I am less concerned with who is conducting the behavioral profiling or what technology they are using. I thank the witnesses today, and I look forward to your testimony, particularly hearing more about what the industry is doing to address many of these concerns in and of itself. Mr. Chairman, I am ready to work with you and the stakeholders to address identified problems and ensure whatever solutions develop will equally apply to the behavior regardless of who engages in it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. It is now my privilege and honor to recognize for 5 minutes for the purposes of opening statement the chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet, the gentleman from West Virginia, Chairman Boucher, for 5 minutes. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK BOUCHER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA Mr. Boucher. Well, thank you very much, Chairman Rush, and I want to begin this morning by saying thank you to you and to your very fine staff and to Mr. Radanovich from California, your ranking member, as well to Mr. Stearns and his staff for the excellent cooperation we have had among ourselves as the plans for this joint hearing of our two subcommittees have progressed. I very much look forward to our continued collaboration as we consider the need for legislation and discuss the principles that privacy protection legislation should embody. Broadband networks are a primary driver of the national economy and it is fundamentally in the nation's interest to encourage their expanded use. One clear way Congress can promote greater use of the Internet for access to information, for electronic commerce, and for entertainment is to assure that Internet users have a high degree of privacy protection, including transparency about information collection practices and uses, and control over the use of the information that is collected from those who use the Internet. I have previously announced my desire to work with Chairman Waxman, Chairman Rush, and ranking members Barton, Stearns, and Radanovich in order to develop legislation this year extending to Internet users the assurance that their online experience will be more secure. Such a measure would be a driver of greater levels of Internet uses, such as electronic commerce, not a hindrance to them. Today's discussion will examine behavioral advertising and ways to enhance consumer protection in association with it. I am a supporter and a beneficiary of targeted advertising. I would much prefer to receive Internet advertisements that are truly relevant to my particular interests. In fact, I have bought a significant number of items based upon targeted advertising delivered to me from web sites that I frequently visit. And so I have a deep appreciation of the value of targeted advertising from the consumer perspective. It is important to note also that online advertising supports much of the commercial content applications and services that are available to Internet users without charge, and I have no intention of doing anything that would disrupt that very successful, in fact, essential business model for Internet- based companies. At the same time, I think consumers are entitled to some base line protections in the online space. Consumers should be given clear, concise information in an easy defined privacy policy about what information a web site collects about them, how that information is used, how long it is stored, how it is stored, what happens to it when it is no longer stored, and whether it is ever given or sold to third parties. Consumers should be able to opt out of first party use of the information and for its use by third parties or subsidiaries who are a part of the company's normal first party transactions or without whom the company could not provide its service. All that would fall within the ambit of opt out. Consumers should be able to opt in to use of their information by third parties for those parties' own marketing purposes. This arrangement should not prove to be burdensome. In fact, it is very much in line with the practices of many, if not most, of the reputable service providers today. I look forward to hearing from your witnesses about their reactions to this arrangement and how it can best balance Internet business models that depend on online advertising with adequate protection for consumers' privacy. For example, have I suggested a workable online opt in and opt out consent arrangement or are there additional situations in which opt out consent might sometimes be appropriate? What safeguards should be in place in order to ensure that consumers are giving meaningful consent to the sharing of their information both on and off the Internet? What role could self-regulatory organizations play in a statutory arrangement that ensures that all entities that collect information about Internet users abide by a basic set of consumer privacy standards. I also look forward to learning about emerging approaches to enhancing consumer choice and controlled over the use of information through efforts like the network advertising initiative and persistent opt out cookies. What benefits could these services offer to consumers? What is the best way to inform consumers about the availability of these services and again how should the consumers' meaningful consent be procured? I am also interested in hearing a purview of what the future of behavioral advertising may hold and what services it might enable and how to accommodate privacy concerns associated with those future services. I want to thank our witnesses for taking the time to join us here today. They represent a broad and diverse range of interest and are all deeply knowledgeable about these subjects. We very much look forward to hearing your testimony. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Boucher follows:] Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Communications, the ranking member, Mr. Stearns, from Florida. He is recognized for 5 minutes for the purposes of opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CLIFF STEARNS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Mr. Stearns. Good morning, and, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also want to echo Mr. Boucher's comment that we look forward to working together in a bipartisan fashion on a very important bill, and I want to thank the witnesses for coming this morning. I think for the most part you are going to educate us. You are the experts here, and we respect your opinions. We want to do no harm here. So I think when you look at the possibility of federal legislation dealing with privacy, we want to make sure that it is consumer centric. Consumers don't care if you are a search engine or a broadband provider. They just want the assurance that their privacy is protected. We must empower them to make these privacy decisions themselves. They feel, they know how much ought to be collected and what should not be collected. Congress cannot and should not make that decision for them, but it can play a role in making sure consumers have the information simply to make their own choices. That means companies should be as transparent as possible about what information they collect, and, of course, how they are using it. That way consumers will be better able to make informed privacy decisions. This transparency should include robust disclosure and notice outside the privacy policy. Notice and disclosure needs to be clear and conspicuous so the consumers know that. First, some information is being collected. Second, what is the information that is being collected? How is it being used? And, third, how to prevent this information being collected if they so desire. By giving the consumer more robust and transparent information, we can strike the proper balance between privacy protection and strong Internet commerce. Furthermore, my colleagues, I want to emphasize two principles that should play a prominent role in our examination of this issue. First, we should apply the same privacy standard to companies that are engaged in similar conduct with similar information, but we should avoid applying those same standards to entities that do not use the same types of information for the same purposes and do not have anywhere near the same volume of information about the perspective consumer. For example, search engines in the Internet advertising networks may use a consumer's visit to a particular web site to create profiles not directly related to the reason for the visit. Other entities, like web publishers, collect information only to provide the very service the consumer has come for. Our approach should recognize that. Second, any legislation in this area should hold various parties accountable only for that which they know and control. We should be wary of efforts to make any one party responsible for the actions of others. Consumers' online activities provide advertisers with valuable information upon which to market their products and their services. Collecting this type of information for targeted advertising is very important because it simply allows many of these products and services to remain free to consumers. Without this information, web sites would either have to cut back on their free information and services or would have to start charging a fee. Neither result is good for the consumers. Overreaching privacy regulation could have a significant economic negative impact at a time when many businesses in our economy are struggling, so let us be very careful on these issues before we leap to legislative regulatory proposals. When I was chairman of the Commerce, Consumer Protection, and Trade, I held a number of hearings on privacies. I worked with Chairman Boucher, and we developed a consumer privacy protection at which we dropped as a bill. This bill would have required data collectors to provide consumers with information on the entity collecting the information and the purposes for which the information was being collected. I believe it was, and still is, a good base bill to use as we move forward to develop a new privacy bill. Also, I would like to bring up an issue perhaps that many of us have thought about, and I don't want to bog down our discussion about it. Which agency will regulate and enforce privacy standards? Will it be the FCC or the Federal Trade Commission, a combination or possibly a new agency? I know this issue won't be solved this morning, but it is something we are going to have to work out and work through, and I look forward to doing this in a bipartisan fashion. And I would be interested, if possible, if some of the witnesses could give us their feelings about how the jurisdiction of this privacy bill would be best supervised with. So, Mr. Chairman, I would conclude by pointing out we have talked a little bit at previous hearings about deep pocket inspection. The point is that whether a company uses deep pocket inspection or reads your e-mail directly, this should be part of the privacy rules in some way. So I think our witnesses can also help us on that particular aspect, so I look forward to hearing and thank you for the opportunity to speak. Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Space, for 2 minutes for the purposes of opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ZACHARY T. SPACE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Space. Thank you, Chairman Rush and Chairman Boucher, Ranking Member Radanovich and Ranking Member Stearns for convening us today on the topic of behavioral advertising. I was struck when reviewing Professor Felten's testimony by a comment that he makes, ``Responsible ad services typically collect less information and track users less intensively than the technology would allow.'' To me, this means that just because we can doesn't mean that we should. I certainly understand the need for companies to advertise on their sites. Doing so is what enables our constituents to access free content, products, and services on line. They also understand the desire of ad companies to supply consumers with ads that are of more relevance to them. This is a better business model for the companies and potentially a service to consumers. However, I want to make clear that one bad apple could spoil the whole bunch here. The moment online consumers believe their personal information is at risk of corruption, misuse or theft will be the moment this approach we are discussing today will cease to work. I strongly believe it is in the interest of all parties to disclose to consumers their advertising practices and intent and to ensure that consumers' personal information is strictly guarded against security breaches and exploitation. I look forward to these conversations today and to working with my colleagues on this issue as we move forward. I yield back my time. Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. It is now my pleasure and honor to recognize for 5 minutes for the purposes of opening statement the ranking member of the full Committee on Energy and Commerce, Mr. Barton, is recognized for 5 minutes. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE BARTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS Mr. Barton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I look on the other side of the aisle, I am glad to see that none of the Democrats who played on the Democratic baseball team are actually in the room, so I can congratulate them in their absence and I won't have to do it face to face when I see them on the floor. But last night Mike Doyle, who is the manager of the team, Bart Stupak, who is on this committee, played an amazing game. It wasn't their usual Democratic bumbling error game. They actually played very well as a team, and as a result they beat the stalwart Republicans 15-10. John Shimkus, who is our starting pitcher, played an excellent game, and we had a number of Energy and Commerce Republicans, Mr. Gingrey, Dr. Gingrey, who is here, walked at a key time and later scored. Mr. Scalise, who is here, played second base some and also did some base running and scored. Mr. Pitts, who came out and watched the game, and luckily didn't try to play although we could have used his bombing skills from the Vietnam War. So, anyway, we raised quite a bit of money for charity and had a good time. When you all see Mike Doyle and you see that he is grinning from ear to ear just congratulate him and tell him to take pity on the downtrodden Republicans who didn't quite have the stuff last night. On this hearing, Mr. Chairman, I do want to thank you, thank Mr. Boucher, Mr. Stearns, Mr. Radanovich for working in a bipartisan fashion to protect the privacy and security of every American's personal information. I am glad that we are working on this in a bipartisan way. I especially appreciate Chairman Rush's agreement to act on the Republicans' data security bill. That bill has implications for the broader privacy discussion, and I hope that that bill will move forward in the full committee. Along with Congressman Markey, I co-chair the Congressional Privacy Caucus, so I am glad that we are working on these issues in a bipartisan way. I, myself, every few days hit the delete button and clean out all the various cookies on the computer and at my home. It is amazing to me how many of those accumulate and most of the time without absolutely any knowledge of myself or anybody else for that matter that they are being put on our computer. I think it is a big deal if somebody tracks where you go and what you look at without your personal approval. We wouldn't like that in the non-Internet world, and I personally don't like it in the Internet world. The information about myself is mine. Unless I choose to share it, I would just as soon that it stay my information only. I think that I have the right to know what information people are gathering about me and the right to know what they are doing with it. It is obvious that the public agrees with the statement that I just made because poll after poll shows that they think that their information and their right to privacy is just as important on the Internet as it is in the non-Internet world. When I open an e-mail for the new Dallas Cowboy Stadium that is in my congressional district, I don't expect to begin receiving unsolicited ads for airlines tickets to the Dallas-Fort Worth area or hotels, also in my district in Arlington, Texas. It is obvious that people track what I do and where I go, and try to take advantage of that. Fortunately, technology has come quite a ways in protecting the individuals. We started looking at the spyware problem back in the 107th Congress, and thanks to the work among others Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack, Ed Towns, Chairman Dingell, those spyware infections are not near the problems that they used to be. However, today companies continue to gather, maintain, and use data through a variety of technological methods. Some of those companies such as Verizon and Comcast are large companies. They are regulated in some parts of their business model, and I think they are trying to act appropriately. There are other companies, so- called ISP locators, that I personally don't even know their name. Then you have the in-between companies, the so-called edge companies like Yahoo! and Google. Put together, it still is a little bit of a wild west out there, and I think it is time that Congress begin to look at and try to bring some law and order to that particular wild west area. I see that my time has expired, Mr. Chairman, so I will submit the rest of the statement for the record. Suffice it to say that I am glad that you and Congressman Boucher are working with the Republicans and taking a serious look at this. I also want to commend the private sector that is here today. It is my understanding that you are working together to come up with some voluntary rules, and it is always preferable in my opinion to do it through a voluntary market-based approach as opposed to a mandatory regulatory approach. So in any event again thank you, Mr. Chairman, and once again congratulations to the Democrats for winning the baseball game last night. I yield back. [The prepared statement of Mr. Barton follows:] Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the ranking member. It is now my honor to recognize the gentle lady from California for 2 minutes for the purpose of opening statement, Ms. Matsui. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DORIS O. MATSUI, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Ms. Matsui. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you and Chairman Rush for calling today's joint hearing and applaud both your leadership in addressing this important issue. I would also like to thank our panelists for being here with us this morning. Today, we are here to examine the practices and consumer protections from a growing online advertisement practice known as behavioral advertising. As broadband access continues to expand across the country, more and more Americans rely on the Internet for news information, online videos, and to purchase goods and services. Americans need to have trust and confidence that their personal information are properly protected. Privacy policies and disclosures should be clear and transparent so consumers can choose what information they want to view and receive on the Internet instead of inappropriate collection and misuse of their information. Consumers should also understand the scope of the information that is being collected, what it is being used for, the length of time it is being retained, and its security. The more information that consumers have, the better. Moving forward, we must assure that Americans are comfortable with using the Internet and know with confidence that meaningful privacy safeguards are in place or ensuring that we don't stifle innovation. I thank both of you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this important hearing today, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentlelady. Now the chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Whitfield, for 5 minutes for the purpose of opening--let me correct that. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. Upton. I thank my friend, and I will not take my 2 minutes. We have great attendance. We will see what the attendance is after lunch when we return after these votes. I would like to associate myself with Mr. Barton's remarks. The information is yours. When you make a phone call, no matter who it is, you don't expect AT&T or Verizon to share the information with somebody else. You can imagine if you ordered a pizza on the phone and all of a sudden you get different pizza companies coming in knowing that you are going to be subscribing to that. That information is personal. It shouldn't be shared unless that individual allows and knows that it is going to be shared. It needs to be protected. It is nobody's business. You don't expect to have someone follow you in your car when you go make an errand whether it be to a dry cleaner or wherever you might go and expect some competitor then to perhaps get the information to trace you back. So this is a great hearing, and I look forward to it and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Barrow, for 2 minutes for the purpose of opening statement. Mr. Barrow. I thank the chairman. I am going to waive opening but I want to thank the ranking member for his kind words of congratulations. In solidarity with Mr. Pitts, I want to remind the ranking member that those of us who sit in the stands and cheer also serve. Thank you very much. Mr. Rush. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Whitfield, for 5 minutes. Mr. Whitfield. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We certainly appreciate all these witnesses being here today as we explore this very important subject. As online communities use an array of sophisticated and ever evolving data collection and profiling applications, it is important that we focus on protecting privacy. Today, I think we will be hearing about privacy policies at various companies, the data retention that they do, and as we proceed and think about legislation, it is imperative that we use a balanced approach and proceed with caution. And I think if we do have any legislation it certainly should apply equally to all entities throughout the Internet ecosystem, and I will yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Rush. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Pitts from Pennsylvania, Mr. Pitts, recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. Pitts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I worked real hard on an opening statement, but I think I will submit it for the record. Just let me say I believe that consumer privacy rights should be carefully guarded. I am also encouraged by private industry's recent steps to further protect consumers. It is my hope that if legislative action is taken that we will do so in a careful manner striking a delicate balance between the necessary steps we must take to protect consumers, and the ability for industry to continue to be successful. So with that, I will submit the rest for the record and yield back. [The prepared statement of Mr. Pitts follows:] Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey, for 2 minutes for the purpose of opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PHIL GINGREY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA Mr. Gingrey. Chairman Rush and Chairman Boucher, Ranking Member Radanovich and Stearns, I want to thank you for calling this hearing today on the emerging use of behavioral or interest-based advertising online. This type of advertising only represents a small portion of all online ads. By 2012 this type of advertising is estimated to reach $4.4 billion in revenue. Therefore, it is important for these subcommittees to take a further look at this industry in order that we ensure the online privacy of consumers. When hearing testimony from this panel today, I believe that it will be important that we focus on three components of any potential regulation that these subcommittees propose. First, it is important to distinguish what it is that we are going to be regulating. Currently, most interest-based advertising is conducted through the use of web browser cookies. These encoded text files help indicate a user's online activity, thereby enabling advertisers to customize ads based on a series of preferences. However, as we have seen in the IT industry, particularly over this last decade, technology moves very quickly and if we are to propose regulations for this industry then we must make the determination of exactly how and what we are going to regulate. Mr. Chairman, we must also examine which federal agency would be best suited to coordinate any potential regulation. Both the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, and the Federal Trade Commission have jurisdiction over elements of behavioral advertising. Therefore, for the sake of consumers if regulations are necessary, we must coordinate the efforts and responsibilities of these two governmental entities, thereby allowing for industry growth while at the same time safeguarding an individual's private information. Lastly, Mr. Chairman, we would also have to determine whom we would be regulating. Would it be the Internet service provider or the advertisers or the web interfacing companies represented here today? Accordingly, I think it will be important that as we move forward, we diligently take the time to hear from ISP companies and advertisers as a way to give us different perspective on this important issue that will continue to be crucial to the further development of online activity. Mr. Chairman, the heart of this hearing is the American consumer so our focus must be their overall protection. I look forward to hearing from the panel, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Scalise, for 2 minutes for the purposes of opening statements. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE SCALISE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA Mr. Scalise. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you and the ranking members of the subcommittees for having this hearing on behavioral advertising. I am pleased that both subcommittees are examining this issue as well as the greater issue of data privacy. I know that Congress and this committee have held hearings on data privacy in the past, but as we know technology continues to advance and develop in ways that provide tremendous benefits to consumers. But these advancements and benefits can expose consumers to certain risks. Therefore, we must continue to examine ways to ensure consumers don't have their personal information compromised. The technology industry is one of the most advanced and competitive industries in our country. It is also one of the most beneficial, both for consumers and for our economy. We are able to share information, exchange ideas, and conduct commerce in ways that were never imagined just a few decades ago. The industry also provides millions of good high- paying jobs for people all across this country. One thing that I think must be pointed out is that the industry has evolved and grown on its own with little regulation from the federal government. Some would say that the government's failure to regulate this industry is one of the reasons it has grown and provided so many good jobs. Yes, there have been bad actors in the industry, and there are issues we must address in protecting consumers' personal information, but I would hope we would proceed with caution when stepping in or when drafting legislation in this area. I hope the focus of today's hearing is how we can protect consumers and their personal information and what steps the industry will take to do that. I hope today's hearing does not focus on how the government can improve the industry. As we continue to delve into this issue today and future hearings, we should focus on the consumer and what will offer consumers the greatest transparency into the online practices and give them meaningful control over their personal information. For this reason, I believe that self-regulation is sufficient and if privacy regulatory requirements are needed, they should be consistent across the industry and not be greater for one technology compared to another. Everyone involved in online advertising, ISPs, search engines, advertising networks, web site publishers and others, should all be subject to the same requirements, and Congress should not try to pick winners and losers. After all, consumers are not always aware that their Internet activities are being tracked. They care about what information is collected and what it is used for. They want to know if this is going on and, if so, they should be able to opt out if they so choose and be assured that a breach of their personal information will not occur. I look forward to the hearing and the comments from our panelists today, particularly on self-regulation and what changes they will make to ensure protection of personal information and what changes they plan on making moving forward. It is important that these committees and subcommittees understand their positions and activities as well as all the implications of these new advertising practices. Thank you, and I yield back. Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. As I indicated earlier, there is a vote occurring on the House floor. It is a series of votes, and so we will recess the committee until the completion of those votes, and we will reconvene 15 minutes after the completion of those votes. The committee now stands in recess. [Recess.] Mr. Rush. The committee will reconvene. I certainly want to thank each and every one of you for your patience. I want to also apologize for the time that you have been forced to spend here. This has been an abnormal day with a lot of abnormal activities, and I might add it has been a record-breaking day. According to some, we have had at least 54 consecutive votes one after another and this never happened before that we know. So it is not something we are proud of, but it has been that kind of a day. We are going to proceed right to our witnesses. Starting on my left, to the right we will proceed with introducing our witnesses. Mr. Jeffrey Chester is the Executive Director for the Center for Digital Democracy--let me start over again. Mr. Edward W. Felten is Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University. Next to Mr. Felten is Ms. Anne Toth. She is the vice president of Policy, Head of Privacy for Yahoo. Ms. Nicole Wong is the Deputy General Counsel responsible for privacy for Google. Mr. Christopher M. Kelly is Chief Privacy Officer at Facebook. Mr. Jeffrey Chester is Executive Director for the Center for Digital Democracy. Mr. Charles D. Curran is the Executive Director of Network Advertising Initiative. And Mr. Scott Cleland is the President of Precursor LLC. Again, we want to thank the witnesses for their patience and for their appearance before the subcommittee. It is the practice of this subcommittee now that we will swear in all the witnesses, so would you please stand and raise your right hand? [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Rush. Let the record reflect that all the witnesses have responded in the affirmative. Now we will ask the witnesses to enter into opening statements. And, Mr. Felten, you are recognized for 5 minutes or thereabouts. So please pull the mike in front of you, turn it on, and let it rip. Thank you. TESTIMONY OF EDWARD W. FELTEN, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY POLICY, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY; ANNE TOTH, VICE PRESIDENT OF POLICY, HEAD OF PRIVACY, YAHOO!, INC.; NICOLE WANG, DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL, GOOGLE INC.; CHRISTOPHER M. KELLY, CHIEF PRIVACY OFFICER, FACEBOOK; JEFFREY CHESTER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR DIGITAL DEMOCRACY; CHARLES D. CURRAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NETWORK ADVERTISING INITIATIVE; AND SCOTT CLELAND, PRESIDENT, PRECURSOR LLC TESTIMONY OF EDWARD W. FELTEN Mr. Felten. Thank you, Chairman Rush, Chairman Boucher, for the opportunity to testify today. My name is Edward Felten. I am a Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs at Princeton University. I am here as a technologist. I am a computer science professor and I would like to explain some of the technology behind behavioral advertising. The most serious privacy concerns are raised not by the presence of advertising but by the gathering of information about users that can be used either to target ads or for other purposes. I would like to describe what technology makes possible. Responsible ad services do not do everything that is possible, and I don't mean to imply otherwise. Others on the panel can describe what their own systems do do. To explain what this technology allows, I would like to walk through a scenario illustrated by the diagram on the last page of my written testimony. And if I could have the display, please, of the Power Point. What I would like to describe, Mr. Chairman, is a scenario involving behavioral advertising. In the beginning of the scenario, I go to a weather site, and I look up Thursday's forecast for Washington. The weather site sends me a page with the forecast information and a hole where the ad should be. And along with that page it sends my computer a command telling it how to find the ad. Following these instructions, my web browser connects to an ad service shown here at the bottom and asks for an ad. Along with this request, information is sent to the ad service about me, the fact that I am looking up Thursday's forecast for Washington and the fact that I normally look up the forecast in Princeton, New Jersey. The ad service remembers this information. The ad service sends an ad, which is inserted into the page. The service also sends an ad in this case related to travel to Washington because I looked up the Washington, D.C. forecast. The service also sends along its so- called cookie which contains a small, unique code which in this example in the diagram is 7592, and my computer stores this cookie. Later, I visit a social network page which also contains an ad. Again, the page has a blank space for the ad and my computer contacts the ad service to get an ad. My computer automatically sends along the cookie that the service provided earlier. This request for an ad carries more information about me. It says that I am interested in baseball and jazz, which the social network site knows, and that my name is Edward Felten. The ad service recognizes that the cookie is the same as before so it knows that I am the same person who looked up D.C. weather earlier and it adds the new information to its profile of me. The service sends back an ad. This time it is an ad for Washington Nationals tickets because I looked up Washington weather earlier, and I am interested in baseball. Notice that the ad service is connecting the dots between things that I did on different sites between something I did on the weather site and something I did on the social network site. This allows it to better target ads and also to build up a more extensive profile about me. Next, I go to a book store and look up books about travel in Hawaii. The book store site sends this information to the ad service along with another ad request. Again, the cookie allows the ad service to link together my book store activities with my earlier activities on other sites. The ad service sends back an ad for jazz CDs because it knows I like jazz because the social network site told it. By this point, the ad service knows enough to identify me. It knows I live in Princeton and it knows that my name is Edward Felten. The ad service buys access to a third party commercial database using what it knows about my identity to get more information about me. In this example, the ad service gets my credit report in by insurance history, which it adds to my profile along with the other information it had. And, finally, I go to a news site that uses the same ad service. My computer again requests an ad. The ad service in this case sends an ad for budget Hawaiian vacations. It knows that I am interested in visiting Hawaii because I looked at Hawaii books at the bookstore, and it knows I am interested in a low cost trip because it has my credit report. The news site sends information about what I was reading. In this example, I was reading about cancer treatments. This information is added to my profile as well. In this scenario, the ad service got information in three ways. First, content providers sent along information about what I was doing on their sites and what I had done in the past. Second, the ad service connected the dots to link my activities across different sites at different times. And, third, the ad service accessed third party commercial databases. All of this information ended up in my profile. The result was well-targeted ads but also the creation of an electronic profile of me containing sensitive information which could in principle be resold or reused for other purposes. Now ad services are not the only parties who can assemble such profiles but large ad services do have a prime opportunity to build profiles due to their relationships with many content providers who can pass along information about users, and due to the ad service's ability to connect the dots by linking together a user's activities across different web sites. All of this is possible as a technical matter which is not to say that responsible ad services do all of it or even most of it. Ad services may be restrained by law, by self-regulation or by market pressures. What is clear is the technology by itself cannot protect users from broad gathering and use of information. Mr. Rush. Mr. Felten, I am embarrassed to say this, but would you please bring your statement to a close? You have extended your time. Mr. Felten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was just wrapping up. I just wanted to thank the committee for holding this hearing and for giving me the opportunity to testify. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Felten follows:] Mr. Rush. Thank you so very much. Ms. Toth, you are recognized for 5 minutes for the purpose of opening statement. TESTIMONY OF ANNE TOTH Ms. Toth. Chairman Boucher and Rush, Ranking Member Stearns and Radanovich, members of the subcommittees, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today at this important hearing. My name is Anne Toth, and I am Yahoo!'s Vice President of Policy and Head of Privacy. I joined the company over 11 years ago and became one of the very first dedicated privacy professionals at any online company. Quite simply, my job is about making sure Yahoo! earns and maintains its users' trust each and every day. Yahoo! was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo, who were trying to help people find information that was useful and relevant to them among the clutter of the early World Wide Web. What began as a directory of popular web sites quickly grew into a globally recognized brand that provides a wide range of innovative and useful products and services to 500 million users worldwide. The Internet has changed a great deal, and this hearing recognizes its importance in our global economy. Gone are the days of one size fits all Internet content. Our consumers expect not only that Yahoo! will meet their needs, but that we will anticipate those needs as well. The same is true for advertising. Consumers are more likely to click on advertising that speaks directly to them and their interests. For example, Yahoo! might deliver ads featuring hybrid cars if the users spend a great deal of time on Yahoo! Green or has recently browsed car reviews on Yahoo! Autos. Put simply, customized advertising helps consumers save time and energy. As you may know, Yahoo! offers our industry leading products and services larger for free. Our business also depends almost entirely on the trust of our users. It has been paramount to our growth and is critical for our future success. Our approach to privacy couples front end transparency, meaningful choice, and user education with back end protections for data that limit how much information and how long personal identifiers are maintained. Let us start by talking about transparency. Our leading edge privacy center, which you can see on the slide that is being projected, provides easy navigation, information on special topics, and gives prominence to our opt-out page, and actually if we could move to the next slide, making it simple for users to find and exercise their privacy choices. We have also experimented with a number of ways to provide notice and transparency outside of standard privacy policies giving users multiple privacy touch points. We must also put control in the hands of our users. We have an opt-out that now applies to interest-based advertising both on and off the Yahoo! network of web sites. Whether a user touches us as a first party publisher or as a third party ad network, we want them to have a choice. We also didn't want users to have to redo their opt-outs again and again and took the further step of making our opt-out persistent for users who registered for a Yahoo! account. This means that these users who clear their cookies will not inadvertently clear their privacy choices at the same time. The final aspect of the front end of privacy protection is user education. For over a year, Yahoo! has displayed on average 200 million ads per month that explain our approach to privacy. All of these front end steps are complemented by back end protections. We focus on security and data retention as core aspects of protecting back end privacy. We recently announced the industry's leading data retention policy. Under this policy, we will retain the vast majority of our web log data in identifiable form for only 90 days. This dramatically reduces the period of time we will hold log file data in identifiable form and vastly increases the scope of data covered by the policy. The limited exceptions for this policy are explained more fully in my written testimony. We believe that our front end, back end approach to privacy builds a circle of trust with users, providing transparency, meaningful choice, and extensive education coupled with strong security and minimum data retention. Much attention has been recently paid to the question of whether an opt-out or an opt-in approach to user control in the area of interest-based advertising is best. The answer is both. The decision about whether to ask for opt-in consent or give users the opportunity to opt out depends on the individual services being provided and the information being collected. Most advances in online privacy protection have come as a result of industry initiative and self-regulation. Market forces drive companies like Yahoo! to bring privacy innovations to customers quickly. As one company leads, many others follow or leap frog by innovating in new ways. So as Congress considers its role in helping protect consumer privacy online, Yahoo! hopes that legislators will consider an approach that enables providers to keep pace not only with technological advances but with customer demands and expectations as well. I am very proud of Yahoo!'s record of trust and commitment to privacy, and the industry's history of responsible self- regulation. I look forward to sharing our experience with you in more depth and am happy to answer your questions. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Toth follows:] Mr. Rush. Thank you, Ms. Toth. Now the chair recognizes Ms. Wong. Ms. Wong, you have 5 minutes or thereabouts. TESTIMONY OF NICOLE WONG Ms. Wong. Chairmen Rush and Boucher, Ranking Members Radanovich and Stearns, and members of the committee, I am pleased to appear before you this evening to discuss online advertising and the ways that Google protects our users' privacy. Online advertising is critically important to our economy. It promotes freer, more robust and more diverse speech, and enables many thousands of small businesses to connect with consumers across the nation and around the world. It helps support the hundreds of thousands of blogs, online newspapers, and other web publications that we read every day. Over the last decade, the industry had struggled with the challenges of providing behavioral advertising. On the one hand, well-tailored ads benefit consumers, advertisers, and publishers alike. On the other hand, we recognize the need to deliver relevant ads while respecting users' privacy. In March, Google entered the space and announced our release of interest-based advertising for our AdSense partner sites and for YouTube. Interest-based advertising uses information about the web pages people visit to make the online ads they see more relevant and relevant advertising has fueled much of the content, products, and services available on the Internet today. As Google prepared to rule out interest-based advertising, we talked to many users, privacy and consumer advocates and government experts. Those conversations led us to realize that we needed to solve 3 important issues in order to provide consumers with greater transparency and choice, which are core design principles at Google. First, who served the ad? Second, what information is being collected and how is it being used? And, finally, how can consumers be given more control over how their information is used? This evening I would like to show you how we answered each of those questions with the launch of interest-based advertising, which includes innovative, consumer-friendly features to provide meaningful transparency and choice for our users. When you see an online ad today you generally don't know much about that ad. It is difficult to tell who provided the ad and how your information is being collected and used. Google is trying to solve this problem by providing a link to more information right in the ad, as you can see, where it is labeled Ads By Google. This is very different from current industry practices, but we believe that it is important to provide users with more information about the ad right at the point of interaction. We believe that this is a significant innovation that empowers consumers and we think that this is the direction that many in the industry are going. If you are curious about getting information about the ad, you can click on the Google link and navigate to an information page about Google ads, which you can see here. On this page, you are invited to visit our ads preference manager, which helps explain in plain language user friendly format what information is being collected, how it is being used, and how you can exercise choice and get more information about how this advertising product works. Here is the ads preference manager. This innovative tool allows you to see what interests are associated with an advertising cookie, the double click cookie, that is set in the browser you are using. In this case, Google has inferred that my cookie should be associated with hybrid cars, movie rentals and sales, and real estate. This is because I visited sites using the browser about hybrids, movies, and real estate. Before Google introduced the ads preference manager, most users had no idea what interests were being associated with their cookies online by advertising companies. We are the first major company to introduce this kind of transparency. Now you can see those interests, and if you don't agree with those interests, maybe you are not a movie fan or you simply don't want to see ads about movies, you can delete any one of them or a few or as many as you want. So, for example, if you want to delete movie rentals and sales, you can do that with one click, and I have just done that. Likewise, you can add any interests you like. Note that Google does not use sensitive categories so there is nothing in here about sexual orientation, religious affiliation, health status or the like, but there are many, many other options. For example, if you are a sports fan you can associate your cookie with sports, and with a click I have decided that I would like to receive ads personalized for sports fans. If you prefer not to see interest-based ads from Google, you can opt out at any time with one click. After you opt out, Google won't collect information for interest-based advertising and you won't receive interest-based ads from us. You will still see ads, but they may not be as relevant. The opt-out is achieved by attaching an opt out cookie to your browser. Opt out cookies in the industry, however, have traditionally not been persistent. That is, they are often inadvertently deleted from the browser when a user deletes her cookies. So our engineers have developed a tool that was not previously available that makes Google's opt out cookie permanent even when users clear other cookies from their browsers. After you opt out, just click the download button and follow the instructions to install a browser plug-in that saves your opt out settings even when you clear your cookies. I hope this gives you a better idea how Google shows interest-based ads and how we provide users with transparency in the right place at the right time, as well as meaningful, granular, and user-friendly traces for setting ad preferences or opting out. Thank you very much for your time. [The prepared statement of Ms. Wong follows:] Mr. Rush. Next, we welcome Mr. Kelly. Mr. Kelly, you are recognized for 5 minutes. TESTIMONY OF CHRISTOPHER M. KELLY Mr. Kelly. Thank you very much. Chairman Rush and Boucher, and Ranking Members Radanovich and Stearns, and members of the subcommittees, thank you for this opportunity to address important privacy matters on the Internet. We agree with you that protecting privacy is critical to the future growth of the Internet economy. Facebook now serves more than 200 million active users worldwide, roughly 70 million of whom are in the United States. We are a technology company that gives people the power to share their lives and experiences in an authentic and trusted environment making the world more open and connected. Facebook's privacy settings give users control over how they share their information allowing them to choose the friends they accept, the affiliations they choose, and how their information is shared with their friends, and, if they desire, the world at large. Today, I would like to make four key points. First, Facebook's user centric approach to privacy is unique, innovative, and empowers consumers. Our privacy centric principles are at the core of our advertising model. Second, in offering its free service to users, Facebook is dedicated to developing advertising that is relevant and personal without invading users' privacy, and to give users more control over how their personal information is used in the online advertising environment. Third, we primarily achieve these objectives by giving users control over how they share their personal information that model real world information sharing and providing them transparency about how we use their information in advertising. Fourth, the Federal Trade Commission's behavioral advertising principles recognize the important distinctions made by Facebook in its ad targeting between the use of aggregate, non-personally identifiable information that is not shared or sold to third parties versus other sites and companies' surreptitious harvesting, sharing, and sale of personally identifiable information to third party companies. Facebook understands that few of us want to be hermits sharing no information with anyone, nor do many of us want to share everything with everyone, though some do want that. Most people seek to share information with friends, their family, and others that they share a social context with on a regular basis seeking to control who gets our information and how they have access to it. People come to Facebook to share information. We give them the technological tools to manage that sharing. Contrary to some popular misconceptions, full information on Facebook users isn't even available to most users on Facebook let alone all users of the Internet. If someone is searching for new friends on Facebook all that you might see about other users who are not yet her friends would be the limited information that those users have decided to make available. Most of our users choose to limit what profile information is available to non-friends. They have extensive and precise controls available to choose who sees what among their networks and friends as well as tools that give them the choice to make a limited set of information available to search engines and other outside entities. We are constantly refining these tools to allow users to make informed choices. Every day use of the site educates users as to the power they have over how they share their information and user feedback informs everything that we do. Facebook is transparent with our users about the fact that we are an advertising-based business and we explained to them fully the uses of their personal data that they are authorizing by interacting with Facebook either on facebook.com or on the over 10,000 Facebook connect sites throughout the web. Ads targeted to user preferences and demographics have always been part of the advertising industry. The critical distinction that we embrace in our advertising policies and practices and that we want this committee to understand is between the use of personal information for advertisements in personally identifiable form, and the use, dissemination or sharing of information with advertisers in non-personally identifiable form. Users should choose what information they share with advertisers. This is a distinction that few companies make and Facebook does it because we believe it protects user privacy. Ad targeting that shares or sells personal information to advertisers in name, e-mail or other contact information without user control is materially different from targeting that only gives advertisers the ability to present their ads based on aggregate data. So to take in Dr. Felten's example, if you were to navigate to the social networking site, in his example if it were Facebook we would not be sharing with the ad provider that he was Edward Felten or that he likes jazz. So on Facebook a feed is established where people know what they are uploading and receive timely reactions from their friends. The privacy policy and users' experience inform them about how advertising on the surface works. Advertising that enables us to provide the service for free to users is targeted to the expressed attributes of a profile and presented on the space on the page allocated for advertising without granting an advertiser access to any individual user's profile. Unless a user decides otherwise by directly and voluntarily sharing information with an advertiser, advertisers can only target Facebook advertisements against non-personally identifiable attributes of a user derived from profile data. Facebook builds and supports products founded on the principles of transparency and user control, and we thank you very much for the opportunity to present our philosophy on online advertising before this committee. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kelly follows:] Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes Mr. Chester for 5 minutes. TESTIMONY OF JEFFREY CHESTER Mr. Chester. I want to thank the chairs and ranking members and the members of the committee for their interest in privacy for holding this hearing and to support their efforts to, I think, help Americans get a fair digital data deal and that is what they deserve. Just very quickly before I make 4 points, I submitted my testimony in writing. It tries to lay out for the committee the broad parameters of the interactive advertising system as we know it in the United States, all the various elements that now are shaping this very powerful system so you can look at that if you want more information. I have been working on these issues for 15 years looking at online advertising, online marketing, digital communications. I last worked closely with the Commerce Committee back in 1998 when we led the campaign that established with your legislation the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Right now, that is the only online privacy law. It was a bipartisan effort. And what we did for kids, we now need to do for teens and adults. Imagine the world, and this is the world that we have created and you have already spoken about it, both the chair spoke about it, Mr. Barton spoke about it, others have spoke about it. Imagine a world where every move, you are being watched, whatever contents you read, what you buy, how much you are willing to spend, and how much you are not willing to spend, where you go, what you like, what you don't like, all that being compiled. Outside databases being used to even build up this even larger profile of who you are. You include your race, whether you are a low income or middle class. They call it on the online ad industry digital fingerprints or user DNA but this very powerful system that is invisible and unaccountable to the average American is constantly collecting and refining and storing all this information and making claims and assumptions about you, your reputation without any accountability to you as the consumer let alone as the citizen. That is the online advertising system today as we know it. It is different from traditional advertising because as you, yourself, described it is able to track you minute by minute, minute by second, and your information is being sold in online ad auctions in milliseconds. They know who you are and they are selling access to it, so it is an incredible system that we have created. And it is now meshed in almost everything we do online, watching online videos, even e-mail, doing searches, playing games. This broad date collection system is a digital data collection arms race going on as they build this incredibly sophisticated system. And I want to make it clear for my second point that our call for privacy and consumer protection rules isn't about undermining the role of online advertising and marketing. That has an important role to play. It is the underpinning, the foundation of our modern publishing system or really our new way of life in the digital age. We need to have online advertising and marketing, but we need to-- and it is not about any particular company here or sense of companies. It is about the overall practices that the industry has created to collect all this information and to use all this information with these very powerful multi-media, in their words, immersive online advertising services that are not understandable and controllable and definable by consumers. I think to me it is very clear that you look at the issue of what is called sensitive data, which I am hoping you are going to work on, and in particular financial data. When you look at what happened during the recent financial crisis online advertising played a major role in encouraging people to take out those subprime mortgages. Online advertisers and mortgage companies were some of the biggest advertisers on the Internet during the boom period that led to this current crisis. People had no idea when they were taking out a mortgage or taking out a loan what exactly they were getting because this system was defining them in certain ways and making them various offers, once again, non-transparent to them, and as result, they, and I think we, have had to face the consequences. That is just as with the financial system, we need some regulation here that puts the system into balance. Yes, they can try to build this business and we can be innovators, but, yes, consumers get to ensure what data is being used and how it is used, and they have a chance to change it if it is incorrect. So consumer groups around the country are calling on you to enact legislation as soon as possible to bring fair information principles up to the digital era. Self-regulation has failed. They have been working, with all due respect to my friends here, they have been working on self-regulation for 15 years and all you have is more and more data collected every minute. Americans shouldn't have to trade away their rights to control their information and have some autonomy in their affairs, whether it is buying a mortgage, looking up a prescription drug, buying a car or doing anything else without having to give their data up. There is a balance. I hope you will help us restore it. There is a win-win possible here. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Chester follows:] Mr. Rush. Thank you, Mr. Chester. Now the chair recognizes Mr. Curran for 5 minutes. TESTIMONY OF CHARLES D. CURRAN Mr. Curran. Thank you, Chairman Rush, Chairman Boucher, and members of the subcommittee. I would like to thank you on behalf of the Network Advertising Initiative for the opportunity to discuss both the economic benefits and the privacy obligations of online behavioral advertising. The NAI is a coalition of advertising networks and other online marketing companies dedicated to responsible business practices and effective self-regulation. Originally founded 9 years ago, the NAI has grown to include more than 30 leading online advertising companies including all 10 of the largest advertising networks. Today, through the NAI's Web site consumers can learn more about or opt out of online behavioral advertising by any or all of the NAI's member companies across the many thousands of web sites on which such advertising is served. Today's hearing focuses on both industry practice and consumer expectations. The NAI and its members are committed to online advertising practices that strike the right balance between consumers' economic and privacy expectations. We believe that consumers enjoy the diverse range of web sites and services that they get for free thanks to relevant advertising, but we must also provide consumers with meaningful notice and choice. Tens of millions of Americans benefit every day from free web content and services made available on the web because of banner advertising served by NAI members. These ad-supported services include news, blogs, video, photo sharing, and social networking services. NAI members support these web sites by connecting them with advertisers and by using web browser cookies to serve their visitors with more relevant and compelling advertisements. NAI members provide web sites with a broad variety of services. They help smaller web sites combine their audiences so they can attract larger advertisers. They help advertisers gauge the success of their campaigns across multiple sites, and they also make online advertising more interesting and useful to consumers by using non-personally identifiable information about users' activity within an ad network to try to predict their likely interests. In the early days of online behavioral advertising more than 10 years ago, advocates and regulators challenged industry to provide appropriate privacy protections around browser cookies. The NAI self-regulatory code was established to meet that challenge and continues today to apply the same core principles for our members. First, users should receive clear and conspicuous notice on the web sites that they visit where data is collected and used. Second, users should have the ability to opt out of behavioral advertising. Third, sensitive data should not be used for online behavioral advertising without a user's affirmative consent. Fourth, a user's affirmative consent should also be obtained if personally identifiable information is merged with information previously gathered about the user's web browsing with an ad network. As these technologies have matured and the online marketplace has diversified, the Federal Trade Commission has called on industry to broaden and enhance its approach to self-regulation. The NAI and its member companies believe that self-regulatory approaches should be as dynamic as the online marketplace that they serve, and we are moving quickly to respond. The NAI member companies are working to develop technologies that would support and enhance consumer notice in or around behaviorally based banner ads. This would allow users to learn more about behavioral advertising and to make choices directly from the ad itself. Additionally, to help protect users' choices, the NAI is implementing technology to improve the durability of user opt out preferences stored in browser cookies. The NAI believes that its current opt out approach strikes the right balance and consumers' expectations for today's cookie-based advertising. The model combines an opt out for the use of non-sensitive, non-personally identifiable information to deliver ads with an opt in requirement for use of sensitive or personally identifiable data. This preserves a default experience in which web sites provide users with more rather than less relevant advertising. Users have multiple options to control behavioral advertising either by using opt outs offered by the NAI's members or their own easily accessible web browser tools. Any significant changes to this model such as requiring a user's opt in even to non-personally identifiable uses of cookies to improve the relevance could pose a profound risk to both the user's experience and the economic model for ad-supported web services. As they navigate from site to site, consumers could be inundated with recurring opt in prompts asking their permission to serve relevant ads. Consumer rejection of this approach could uproot the revenue model that supports many web sites today. It is vital to the continued growth of web services that the right balance is struck between the economic, technological, and consumer protection considerations relating to online advertising. The NAI looks forward to working with the subcommittees as they consider these important online privacy issues. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Curran follows:] Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. Now the chair recognizes Mr. Cleland for 5 minutes. TESTIMONY OF SCOTT CLELAND Mr. Cleland. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, both you and the ranking member. As a leading Internet expert and consultant, I obviously have Internet companies as clients, which include wireless cable and telecom broadband companies in the communications sector, and Microsoft in the tech sector. However, I want to emphasize my views today are my personal views and not those of any of my clients. What I want to do is talk about the Internet problem and Internet solution. So what is the Internet privacy problem? Well, technology has turned privacy upside down. Before the Internet, it was inefficient, it was costly, and it was difficult to collect private information. Now it is hyper-efficient, cheap and easy to invade privacy. So through inertia what we have is a default, finders keepers, losers weepers, privacy policy. Now, second, most Americans incorrectly assume that the privacy they enjoyed offline in the past is the privacy they have online, and that is not true. Third, all the technology megatrends out there, social networking, cloud computing, Internet mobility, Internet of Things, all of them will dramatically increase privacy risks online. Fourth, there is a significant faction in the technology community that really views privacy negatively and in some parts antithetical to the behavioral advertising and the Web 2.0 model. Now, fifth, a problem is that increasingly the underground currency of the Internet is private data. Now private information is very valuable, but in the absence of a system where consumers can assert ownership and control over their private information, privacy can be taken away from them for free and profited from with no obligation to or compensation due to the affected consumer. The sixth part of the problem, and that is we now have a technology-driven Swiss cheese privacy framework, which may be the worse of all possible worlds. Simply, the haphazard framework we have gives a user no meaningful informed choice to either protect themselves or benefit themselves in the market place arena of their private information. So what is the solution? I think it is very simple. You have a consumer- oriented, consumer centric approach that is technology and competition neutral. Think about it. It is consumers' private information that is being taken and exploited without their consent. Since it is consumers that are most at risk of having their information misused or stolen, wouldn't it be logical for our privacy framework to be organized around the consumer? Now, clearly, businesses should be free to fairly represent and engage consumers in a fair market transaction for their private information. Now its fair market transaction where consumers are able to effectively understand and negotiate the risk and reward involved with sharing the private information. Moreover, since the consumer is the only one that knows which information about their personal situation or their views or their intentions or their interests, which ones they are comfortable with sharing, shouldn't it be the consumer that is empowered to make those decisions? So if Congress decides that it is going to legislate in this area, I think one thing is obvious, and that thing is that you should have consumer framework that would be superior to the current technology- driven framework. That is because it would emphasize protecting people, not technologies. It would empower consumers with both the control and the freedom to choose to either protect or to exploit their privacy. It would prevent competitive arbitrage by creating a level playing field. And it would allow you to stay current with the constant changing innovation because you are not technology oriented, you are consumer oriented. And, lastly, you are going to be able to accommodate both sides, the people who care very much to protect their privacy but also those who care less and would like to exploit their private information. So in closing I think we can do better than the current finders keepers, losers weepers privacy policy that is the de facto policy of the United States. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and ranking member for the opportunity to testify. [The prepared statement of Mr. Cleland follows:] Mr. Rush. The chair thanks the gentleman. Now the committee will engage the witnesses in a series of questions, and the chair recognizes himself for 5 minutes for the purpose of questioning the witnesses. Ms. Toth, in your testimony you discuss meaningful choice for consumers, and this is a principle that everyone agrees is a good one. However, it appears that the only choice for consumers using Yahoo! is to opt out of receiving ``interest-based advertising.'' It seems that they can't opt out of Yahoo!'s collection of information and tracking. Can you clarify exactly what the consumers' choice is with Yahoo!'s opt out? If consumers ask to opt out of behavioral advertising, does your company continue to collect data on their browsing habits? And I have another question. Does the opt out only stop the displaying of targeted advertising or does it stop the collection of data? Does your firm offer consumers any way to opt out of tracking and data collection? Would you answer those three questions for me, please? Ms. Toth. Our opt out, you are correct, it is not an opt out of collection of data. It is an opt out of use of data. So there are a number of reasons why we collect data and primarily that relates to the display of advertising, so advertisers pay us to show advertisements, and so we have to know if those ads were delivered and shown so we collect information in order to report that information back to the advertisers who are paying for those ads. But another reason why has a lot to do with the way we operate our web site, so if we were to stop collecting data when a user opts out then there are a number of users we suspect would opt out and engage in behaviors on the site that may not be legitimate behaviors that may be abusive or fraudulent behaviors. So we are continuing to collect information, but when the user opts out we are no longer showing them behavioral advertisements. We are opting them out of that use of their data. So we are a web site that offers a number of different services. Ad serving is one of our many businesses, so we have other uses for the data as I described. I am not sure if I understood the other question specifically as being different from that one. I maybe misheard. So the extent that data is no longer used for advertising, that is what the opt out applies to. But the opt out that we offer is actually a very--it is very clearly provided to users, and it is actually very easy to find, so we think that that actually matters a great deal. The other thing actually that I will mention is that what we offer on the back end is anonymization of that data within 90 days so if users have a concern that there is a great deal of data being collected, we hope to be addressing that on the back end by anonymizing the vast majority of our data within 90 days. What is really notable about that is that our policy doesn't just apply to search log records or to a specific type of log file that all of our log systems including the log systems that inform our advertising capabilities. Mr. Rush. So a consumer cannot opt out of data collection at all? Ms. Toth. The consumer can't opt out through---- Mr. Rush. Cannot. They cannot opt out of data collection. Ms. Toth. No. There are other tools at the browser level that would address that. Our systems don't work that way. Mr. Rush. Ms. Wong, can you answer the same questions for me? Ms. Wong. Sure. Let me start by sort of describing our approach to privacy and data collection on our sites generally because I don't know if you are a regular Google user. Google actually has a design philosophy of always trying to minimize the amount of data we collect about a user in the first instance, so almost all of our services actually don't require a user to provide any personal information at all. When you go to Google Search, you don't have to register. You simply type in your search. If you type in a search and you are not signed in or registered with us what that means is the only thing we get back is what all of us here, what all web sites get, which is sort of a standard what we call log line that records--a computer is asking you a question and that question comes with two things that can be identifying a user. One is an IP address, which your ISP assigns to you, and the other is a cookie, which is what Anne referenced. Neither of those things for Google are tied to an individual. You can't know it is Nicole or Chris or Anne based solely on the IP address and the cookie. Just to be clear about the type of data we collect, we do provide an opt out, as I was demonstrating in our presentation, for the use of that cookie and IP address data to target ads. In other words, when you click on the opt out what it does is instead of getting a unique cookie, which is a series of numbers and letters, what you get is what we call the opt out cookie, and that opt out cookie literally says in it opt out so that the data that we collect goes into a huge pool of all users who have the same opt out cookie. It is completely abrogated which means we can't see an individual user in that pool of data that has been identified as opt out. Mr. Rush. The chair's time is up. The chair now recognizes the ranking member, Mr. Radanovich, for 5 minutes, and at the conclusion of his questions and answers, the chair will relinquish the chair to the chairman of the Communications Subcommittee at that point. Mr. Radanovich. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome members of the panel. Your testimony is very interesting. My first question goes to Mr. Curran, is it? For your testimony, I understand that you are involved in a broad industry-wide effort to create self-regulating principles, and that these principles, you are going to be releasing these principles pretty soon, I understand within about 30 days. Can you expand a little bit on what we can expect you to address on those, and I am particularly interested about the enforcement areas of these principles. Mr. Curran. Actually I think there are two different answers to your question because there are two different things going on, and in my long form testimony I detailed some of the work going on with the NAI in terms of our member companies, which are primarily advertising networks and other online marketing companies, to essentially further the development of technology that will allow, as Ms. Wong showed you with her presentation, notice inside the banner ad really to get together to advance an infrastructure that would allow any entity serving a behaviorally targeted ad or any party responsible for a behaviorally targeted ad to deliver that kind of notice in connection with an ad. Mr. Radanovich. So that is work that the NAI has been pursuing from a technological perspective? Mr. Curran. Separately, I think your question relates to a far broader industry dialogue that has been not led by the NAI but instead by the IAD, the DMA, the AAAA's, the ANA, and also the BBB. That is a lot of acronyms. Mr. Radanovich. That is much clearer now. Mr. Curran. I think the key takeaway here is that certainly the FTC has indicated that broader self-regulatory approaches were needed for industry, and that is very much an effort in that direction of actually establishing principles similar in spirit to those of the NAI to apply on an ecosystem wide basis. My understanding is that the roll out of those principles is in weeks. And we are very much supportive of those efforts, and I think they are very much a part of a trend of really a momentum towards exactly what the FTC called for in terms of really a very vigorous engagement. Mr. Radanovich. Thank you very much. Ms. Wong, I would love to ask you a question regarding your comments or support of establishing a uniform online and offline framework for privacy. Now I would love to have you clarify what uniform means and does it mean that it should apply to all entities and engage in collecting or using and sharing online information whether they are ISPs or application providers? Should it be straight across the board or are there different applications? Ms. Wong. Yes. And I think there are two answers to that. As an initial matter, Google and a number of the folks at the table here have been really working hard to think about federal comprehensive privacy legislation, and if I were to encourage the committee to do anything I think it is backing something like that because our history on privacy legislation has really been about sectorally trying to regulate privacy with children, with health, with financial, so that for a user on the Internet their Internet experience is seamless. They go from their bank to their doctor to their web service seamlessly and don't realize that different privacy laws apply. The important for ensuring that users continue to trust the use of their data on the Internet is to have baseline privacy law across industries. To get to your second question about---- Mr. Radanovich. Let me ask this and clarify it a little bit. When you say uniform, does that apply to content providers that provide content over Google? Would they be subject to the same--is that what you call uniform online privacy? Ms. Wong. Right. So, yes, there would be baseline standards for all companies in terms of notice to users, access and control for users, and security for that data. Mr. Radanovich. OK. Thank you. Ms. Toth, in Yahoo! recently you announced that you will completely erase IP addresses at the end of its data retention period rather than just deleting a few numbers as is the practice of a number of your competitors. If you don't need the IP addresses for fraud prevention or anything else, what is the utility in keeping the IP address at all, and why the fractional numbers of why don't you just dump it right away? Ms. Toth. I think we actually have slides in there of our data retention policy and the process steps that we take so for the vast majority of our data at 90 days we de-identify the data. We apply a four-step process to remove identifiers. The IP address is one of those identifiers that is stored in the logs, and for us we completely delete that identifier at 90 days with the exception of the fraud and abuse systems which hold it for up to 6 months and then it is deleted. So we store that data only for as long as we need it for the purposes of providing our services and then we de-identify the records and that gets to the IP address. The IP address is typically in the context of use "
