        "text": "The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved the nominations of former FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc and Aditya Bamzai, formerly of the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel and National Security Division, to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB).\n\nThe Senate confirmations will restore the board to its full five-member roster. President Trump nominated LeBlanc and Bamzai in August 2018.\n\nLast October, the Senate approved three other nominations to the board. Adam Klein, Edward Felten, and Jane Nitze were added to join Elisebeth Collins, who was the only member on the board at the time. Collins has since stepped down.\n\nPCLOB is an independent executive branch agency that reviews executive branch actions to protect the U.S. against terrorist threats, and to consider whether those actions infringe upon the need to protect privacy and civil liberties of U.S. citizens."
