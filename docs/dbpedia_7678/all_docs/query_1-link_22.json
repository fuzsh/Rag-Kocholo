The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Leahy, Feinstein, Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Franken, Coons, Blumenthal, Hirono, Grassley, Hatch, Sessions, Graham, Lee, Cruz, and Flake. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Chairman Leahy. Good morning, everybody. It is a strange time in the Congress. I would also note before we start that we will not allow any demonstrations during a meeting of the Senate. I know some demonstrators like to get themselves on television. I do not care whether they are in agreement--or disagreement with positions of mine. I do not want people blocking others who are here, by holding up signs, and I do not want them blocking the people who are here to watch this hearing. This is the United States Senate, and people have the ability to watch a hearing. We are going to conduct further oversight of the intelligence community's use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. No one knows for sure how long the Federal Government will be shut down, but I feel strongly that the Senate Judiciary Committee has to continue its work on this important subject because it does involve the security of the United States. I consulted with Senator Grassley about this, and I appreciate that Director Clapper and General Alexander have agreed to proceed with the hearing today as scheduled. I am certain that they join me in thanking all of the dedicated intelligence community professionals who are also doing their jobs today despite the needless shutdown of the Federal Government. That said, I have decided--and, again, I discussed this with Senator Grassley--to postpone the Committee's weekly business meeting tomorrow in light of the Government shutdown. I am doing this even though we have judicial emergencies on the agenda. I am hoping that those of us who, like myself, are on the Appropriations Committee will be able to get back to passing bills. I am concerned that we are now in October. By law, by the end of last month the House of Representatives was supposed to have sent us each of the appropriations bills so that we could then vote on them, vote up or vote down. They have yet to send over a single one. Maybe instead of looking for slogans we ought to just pass these appropriations bills and vote for them or vote against them, whichever way, but get it done and let people get back to work. I am also going to ask General Alexander and Director Clapper at the end of their statements if they would take an extra minute and tell us, because it is going to be of interest to many of us on this Committee who are on Appropriations, what the shutdown is meaning in the number of people who are not able to come to work and do the jobs that we expect them to do in our intelligence agencies. As we continue to reexamine the intelligence community's use of FISA authorities, let us be clear that no one underestimates the threats that our country continues to face or the difficulty of identifying and meeting those threats. We all agree that we should equip the intelligence community with the necessary and appropriate tools to help keep us safe. But-- and there is always a ``but''--I hope that we can also agree that there have to be limits on the surveillance powers we give to the Government. Just because something is technologically possible and just because something may be deemed technically legal does not mean that it is the right thing to do. This summer, many Americans learned for the first time that Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act has for years been secretly interpreted to authorize the collection of Americans' phone records on an unprecedented scale. The American public also learned more about the Government's collection of Internet content through the use of Section 702 of FISA. Since the Committee's last hearing on these revelations in late July, we have learned a great deal more. We have learned that the NSA has engaged in repeated, substantial legal violations in its implementation of both Section 215 and Section 702 of FISA. For example, the NSA collected, without a warrant, the content of tens of thousands of wholly domestic emails of innocent Americans. The NSA violated a FISA Court order by regularly searching the Section 215 phone records database without meeting the standard imposed by the Court. These repeated violations led to several reprimands by the FISA Court for what the FISA Court called ``systemic noncompliance'' by the Government. The Court has also admonished the Government for making a series of substantial misrepresentations to the Court. Now, knowing this, we have seen no evidence of intentional abuse of FISA authorities, but the pattern is deeply troubling. We have also learned that the NSA in 2011 started searching for Americans' communications in its Section 702 database--a database containing the contents of communications acquired without individualized court orders. And this past weekend--and all of you have seen the front page story--The New York Times reported that the NSA is engaging in sophisticated analysis of both domestic and international metadata to determine the social connections of Americans. So when you have all these revelations, it is no surprise that the intelligence community faces a trust deficit. And after years of raising concerns about the scope of FISA authorities, as I and others have, and the need for stronger oversight, I am glad that many Members of Congress in both parties are now interested in taking a close look at these programs--at both the Government's legal and policy justifications for them and the adequacy of the existing oversight regimes. I think it is time for a change, and I think additional transparency and oversight are important parts of that change. But I believe we have to do more. So I am working on a comprehensive legislative solution with Congressman Sensenbrenner, the Chairman of the Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee in the House, as well as other Members of Congress, again, across the full political spectrum of both parties. Our bipartisan, bicameral legislation will address Section 215 and Section 702 and a range of surveillance authorities that raise similar concerns. Our legislation would end Section 215 bulk collection. It also would ensure that the FISA pen register statute and National Security Letters could not be used to authorize bulk collection. The Government has not made its case that bulk collection of domestic phone records is an effective counterterrorism tool, especially in light of the intrusion on Americans' privacy. In addition, I find the legal justification for this bulk collection to be strained at best. I have looked at the classified list of cases involving Section 215. I find it to be unconvincing. As the Deputy Director of the NSA himself acknowledged at our last hearing a couple weeks ago, there is no evidence that Section 215 phone records collection helped to thwart dozens or even several terrorist plots. In addition to stopping bulk collection, our legislation would improve judicial review--and I think this is extremely important--by the FISA Court and enhance public reporting on the use of a range of surveillance activities. It would require Inspector General reviews of the implementation of these authorities--putting into law a request that Senator Grassley and I, along with eight other Members of this Committee, made last week to the Inspector General for the intelligence community. This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill, so I look forward to working on this effort in the coming months with those in the Senate, in the House, and others who care about these issues. I do appreciate the concrete steps that both Director Clapper and General Alexander have made in recent months to brief Members of Congress--and I have been, as you know, at many of those briefings--and their move toward more transparency and further declassification of documents. I also welcome the participation of the legal and technical experts on our second panel and would note with particular pride that my alma mater, Georgetown Law, is well represented among those witnesses. So I hope this will inform our legislative efforts. You know, we all agree we have to ensure our Nation's security, but we also have to restore the trust of the American people in our intelligence community, and fundamentally we have to protect the liberties that have kept us great and a diversified democracy and the envy of countries around the world because of our democracy. [The prepared statement of Chairman Leahy appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Grassley, do you want to say something before we go to the witnesses? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHUCK GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Grassley. Yes, thank you. And thanks to our witnesses for what they do for the security of our country, and to you, Mr. Chairman, for holding the hearing, a very important oversight hearing, a very important function of Congress to make sure that our laws are faithfully executed. Although the Government has been partially shut down due to partisan differences over various issues, we are continuing our oversight work, as I said, a very important matter, and in this particular instance, because national security is the first responsibility of our Federal Government. We last held a hearing on this subject late July. At that time I expressed the view that the reports in the media had called into serious question whether the law and other regulations currently in place strike the right balance between protecting our civil liberties and our national security. This is especially so concerning the public revelation that under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act the Government was collecting Americans' phone records in bulk. Additional public disclosures since our last hearing have underscored that concern. Indeed, since that time, the administration has declassified legal opinions reflecting significant errors by the Government before the FISA Court in implementing 215 and 702. The good news is that these appear to have been for the most part unintentional mistakes that Government brought to the Court's attention on its own accord. Of course, the bad news is that even with all the checks and balances built into the system, these kinds of errors can still occur. Even more unsettling, other reports since July have suggested that there have been cases of intentional and willful misuse of intelligence authorities by NSA employees to spy on their spouses and neighbors. These disclosures have created a broader crisis of trust in the legitimacy of our intelligence- gathering methods generally. In my view, had these programs been more transparent from the start, this trust deficit that the American people have would not be as severe as it is now. This brings me to the President's response to the crisis which has been very baffling to me. The President held a news conference in early August, a news conference that should have been held, and thankfully he did, in which he defended the bulk collection of phone records as ``an important tool in our effort to disrupt terrorist plots'' and suggested some areas for reform. Since then, as far as I know, he has not said a word in public about these issues. If the President really and truly believes in the importance of these programs, he should be publicly defending them as part of our national debate. He should not be contracting out that job solely to the intelligence community. Simply put, as in so many other areas, the President is failing to lead where he wants others to follow. In any event, I am pleased that we have taken a number of steps to follow up on some of these disturbing reports. Since July, a bipartisan group of Members of this Committee requested that the Inspector General of the intelligence community conduct a thorough review of the implementation of these authorities. Additionally, I wrote to the NSA Inspector General and received a public accounting of the handful of documented instances where the NSA employees intentionally abused their authorities. It was heartening to see how few cases of intentional misconduct exist, but on the other hand, it is alarming to know that the possibility of employees engaging in such behavior turns out to be very real. The NSA Inspector General's response to my letter reflected that many of these cases were referred to the Department of Justice for possible criminal prosecution. I was planning on following up with how these referrals were handled with Deputy Attorney General Cole at this hearing. The Chairman chose not to invite an administration witness to provide legal perspective on these matters. Therefore, I will be following up with the Department of Justice about these cases with a letter to the Attorney General today. The balance between protecting individual liberties and our national security is a delicate one. Reasonable people can disagree about precisely where that balance is best struck. I probably do not agree 100 percent with any member of the two panels of witnesses that we have with us today, including Professor Cordero, whom I have invited to share her valuable perspective as a lawyer with hands-on experience in the intelligence community. But I welcome them all, and I am pleased to hear their views as we consider various reforms to FISA and related surveillance activities. Something has come to my attention. Just yesterday there were press reports of 70 percent of the intelligence community being furloughed. I am concerned that if lawyers in the intelligence community determine that 70 percent of their employees are non-essential to the mission, which is a national security mission, the number one responsibility of the Federal Government, then the intelligence community either needs better lawyers to make big changes to the workforce or are you overemployed in those areas. I cannot believe that 70 percent of the intelligence community is being furloughed and we are still being able to meet our national security responsibilities. So that concerns me very much, and maybe you folks will touch on that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. And, of course, as you know, we had the Deputy Attorney General at our last hearing, and we had the Deputy Attorney General at our closed-door hearing on this, and we will be having the Justice Department testifying again. Because we are limited in time here today, we kept to these two witnesses. Speaking of limitation of time, while this would be unusual, Senator Lee---- Senator Grassley. Do you not want me to send my letter to the Attorney General? Chairman Leahy. Oh, you feel free to send it. You can send anything you want. But we have had him here twice now on this same subject, and I am sure we will be having him again. But, Senator Lee, did you want to make a very short statement? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL S. LEE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Lee. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the Chairman and the Ranking Member allowing me to speak very briefly, as I have to leave for another Committee responsibility. Congress, of course, plays an important role when it comes to overseeing our Nation's intelligence and surveillance programs. We have to balance various competing interests, and it is difficult. I just wanted to highlight a couple of concerns that I am always looking out for. Number one is the breadth of metadata collection pursuant to Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Number two, the potential for back-door searches of information on Americans that is collected, you know, some would argue indirectly, pursuant to Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. And, number three, the lack of transparency within the FISA Court system. I have worked with the Chairman in the past on legislation to address each of these, and I look forward to working with him in the future on these concerns. Thank you very much. Chairman Leahy. Thank you very much. Our first witness is--incidentally, the most senior Member on our side is the Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which helps us a great deal in this deliberation, and we will also be joined later by Senator Durbin, who is the Chair of Defense Appropriations, which handles much of the budget for this. Our first witness is James Clapper. He was sworn in as the fourth Director of National Intelligence on August 9, 2010. He served for 32 years in the United States Armed Forces, retired in 1995. He was a lieutenant general in the Air Force. He previously served as Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Director, it is good to have you here. Please go ahead. STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES R. CLAPPER, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, WASHINGTON, DC Director Clapper. Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Grassley, and distinguished Members of the Committee, sir, if it is all right with you, I would like to answer your question about the impacts of the Government shutdown and furloughing our civilians. First, the legal standard against which we make decisions about who is furloughed and who is not is--and this is quoting from the law--``that which is necessary to protect against imminent threat to life or property.'' And so our applying that standard is what resulted across the board in furloughing roughly 70 percent. I think that will change as this--if this drags on, and we will make adjustments depending on what we see as the ``potential imminent threats to life or property,'' to quote the law. I will tell you as to impacts, I have been in the intelligence business for about 50 years. I have never seen anything like this. From my view, I think, this on top of the sequestration cuts that we are already taking, that this seriously damages our ability to protect the safety and security of this Nation and its citizens. I would commend to you Senator Feinstein's superb statement yesterday on the floor outlining her concerns, with which I completely agree. This affects our ability--this is not just a Beltway issue. This affects our global capability to support the military, to support diplomacy, and to support our policymakers. And the danger here is, of course, that this will accumulate over time. The damage will be insidious. So each day that goes by, the jeopardy increases. This is a dreamland for foreign intelligence service to recruit, particularly as our employees already, many of whom are subject to furloughs driven by sequestration, are going to have, I believe, even greater financial challenges. So we are spending our time setting up counseling services for employees to help them manage their finances. So from my standpoint, this is extremely damaging, and it will increase so as this shutdown drags on. General Alexander, do you want to add anything to that? General Alexander. I was going to do it at the end. Director Clapper. Go ahead. General Alexander. From our perspective, I would echo everything that---- Chairman Leahy. Press the red button. General Alexander. Technically challenged, Mr. Chairman. From NSA's perspective, this has impacted us very hard. We have an amazing workforce. When I look at what our folks are capable of doing, we have over 960 Ph.D.s, over 4,000 computer scientists, over 1,000 mathematicians. They are furloughed. Our Nation needs people like this, and the way we treat them is to tell them, ``You need to go home because we cannot afford to pay you, we cannot make a deal here.'' From my perspective, the impact, what Director Clapper points out is we went to the most specific threats against our Nation. This does not apply to all the threats against our Nation. We cannot cover all of those. So what we are doing is we are taking the most significant counterterrorism and other threats that we see and the support to our military forces in Afghanistan and overseas, that is the priority in what we are doing. That is the way the law has been interpreted, and that is what we are doing. From my perspective, it has had a huge impact on morale. Director Clapper. So, sir, if you would like, we will go into our statements on the subject of the hearing. We do appreciate your having us today to talk about the way ahead occasioned by the dramatic revelations about intelligence collection programs since their unauthorized disclosure and about the steps we are taking to make these programs more transparent while still protecting our national security interests. I am joined today, of course, by the Director of the National Security Agency, General Keith Alexander, and following my brief statement, he will have an additional statement. We think this hearing is a key part of the discussion our Nation needs about legislation that provides the intelligence community with authorities both to collect critical foreign intelligence and to protect privacy and civil liberties. We, all of us in the intelligence community, are very much aware that the recent unauthorized disclosures have raised serious concerns both here in Congress and across the Nation about our intelligence activities. We know that the public wants both to understand how its intelligence community uses its special tools and authorities and to judge whether we can be trusted to use them appropriately. We believe we have been lawful and that the rigorous oversight we have operated under has been effective. So we welcome this opportunity to make our case to the public. As we engage in this discussion, I think it is also important that our citizens know that the unauthorized disclosures of the details of these programs has been extremely damaging. From my vantage as DNI, these disclosures are threatening to our ability to conduct intelligence and to keep our country safe. There is no way to erase or make up for the damage that we know has already been done, and we anticipate even more as we continue our assessment as more revelations occur. Before these unauthorized disclosures, we were always conservative about discussing the specifics of our collection programs based on the truism that the more adversaries know about what we are doing, the more they can avoid our surveillance. But the disclosures, for better or for worse, have lowered the threshold for discussing these matters in public. So to the degree that we can discuss them, we will. But this public discussion should be based on an accurate understanding of the intelligence community, who we are, what we do, and how we are overseen. In the last few months, the manner in which our activities have been characterized has often been incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading, or some combination thereof. I believe that most Americans realize the intelligence community exists to collect the vital intelligence that helps protect our Nation from foreign threats. We focus on uncovering the secret plans and intentions of our foreign adversaries, but what we do not do is spy unlawfully on Americans or, for that matter, spy indiscriminately on the citizens of any country. We only spy for valid foreign intelligence purposes as authorized by law, with multiple layers of oversight to ensure we do not abuse our authorities. Unfortunately, this reality has sometimes been obscured in the current debate, and for some this has led, as you alluded, to an erosion of trust in the intelligence community. And we do understand the concerns on the part of the public. I am a Vietnam veteran, and I remember as congressional investigations of the 1970s later disclosed--and I was in the intelligence community then--that some intelligence programs were carried out for domestic political purposes without proper legal oversight or authorization. But having lived through that as a part of the intelligence community, I can now assure the American people the intelligence community today is not like that. We operate within a robust framework of strict rules and rigorous oversight involving all three branches of the Government. Another useful historical perspective, at least I think, is that during the Cold War, the Free World and the Soviet Bloc had mutually exclusive telecommunications systems which made foreign collection a lot easier to distinguish. Now world telecommunications are unified. Intertwined with hundreds of millions of innocent people conducting billions of innocent transactions are a much smaller number of nefarious adversaries who are trying to do harm on the very same network using the very same technologies. So our challenge is to distinguish very precisely between these two groups of communicants. If we had an alarm bell that went off whenever one terrorist communicated with another terrorist, our jobs would certainly be a lot easier. But that capability just does not exist in the world of technology today. Over the past 3 months, I have declassified and publicly released a series of documents related to both Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act and Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. We did that to facilitate informed public debate about the important intelligence collection programs that operate under these authorities. We felt that, in light of the unauthorized disclosures, the public interest in these documents far outweighed the potential additional damage to national security. These documents let our citizens see the seriousness, thoroughness, and rigor with which the FISA Court exercises its responsibilities. They also reflect the intelligence community's, particularly NSA's, commitment to uncovering, reporting, and correcting any compliance matters that occur. However, even in these documents, we have had to redact certain information to protect sensitive sources and methods, such as particular targets of surveillance. But we will continue to declassify more. That is what the American people want. It is what the President has asked us to do. And I personally believe it is the only way we can reassure our citizens that their intelligence community is using its tools and authorities appropriately and legitimately. The rules and oversight that govern us ensure we do what the American people want us to do, which is to protect our Nation's security and our people's liberties. So I will repeat: We do not spy on anyone except for valid foreign intelligence purposes, and we only work within the law. On occasion, we have made mistakes, some quite significant. But these are usually caused by human error or technical problems. And whenever we have found such mistakes, we have reported, addressed, and corrected them. The National Security Agency specifically, as part of the intelligence community broadly, is an honorable institution. The men and women who do this sensitive work are honorable people dedicated to conducting their mission lawfully and are appalled by any wrongdoing. They, too, are citizens of this Nation who care just as much about privacy and constitutional rights as the rest of us. They should be commended for their crucial, important work in protecting the people of this country, which has been made all the more difficult by this torrent of unauthorized damaging disclosures. That all said, we in the intelligence community stand ready to work in partnership with you to adjust foreign surveillance authorities to further protect our privacy and civil liberties, and I think there are some principles we agree on: One, we must always protect our sources, methods, targets, partners, and liaison relationship. Second, we must do a better job in helping the American people understand what we do, why we do it, and, most importantly, the rigorous oversight that helps ensure that we do it correctly. And, three, we must take every opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to respecting the civil liberties and privacy of every American. But we also have to remain mindful of the potentially negative long-term impact of overcorrecting the authorizations granted to the intelligence community. As Americans, we face an unending array of threats to our way of life, a more diverse array of threats than I have seen in my 50 years in intelligence. And I believe we need to sustain our ability to detect these threats. We welcome a balanced discussion about national security and civil liberties. It is not an either/or situation. We need to continue to protect both. Let me turn now to General Alexander. [The prepared statement of Mr. Clapper appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Leahy. General Alexander serves the Director of the National Security Agency and the head of U.S. Cyber Command. He has testified before us both in open and closed sessions of this Committee and, of course, continuously in the Intelligence Committee. General, go ahead. STATEMENT OF HON. KEITH B. ALEXANDER, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, FORT MEADE, MARYLAND General Alexander. Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Grassley, distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide opening remarks. I am privileged today to represent the dedicated professionals at the National Security Agency who employ the authorities provided by Congress, the Federal courts, and the executive branch to help protect the Nation and protect our civil liberties and privacy. If we are to have an honest debate about how NSA conducts its business, we need to step away from sensationalized headlines and focus on facts. Our mission is defend the Nation and to protect our civil liberties and privacy. Ben Wittes from the Brookings Institution said about the media leaks and specifically about these two FISA programs: ``Shameful as it is that these documents were leaked, they actually should give the public great confidence in both NSA's internal oversight mechanisms and in the executive and judicial oversight mechanisms outside the Agency. They show no evidence of any intentional spying on Americans or abuse of civil liberties. They show a low rate of the sort of errors any complex system of technical collection will inevitably yield. They show robust compliance procedures on the part of the NSA. And they show an earnest, ongoing dialogue with the FISA Court over the parameters of the Agency's legal authority and a commitment both to keeping the Court informed of activities and to complying with its judgments on their legality.'' Today I would like to discuss the facts and specifically address: Who we are in terms of both our mission and our people; What we do: adapt to technology and the threat; take direction from political leadership; operate strictly within the law and consistent with explicit intelligence priorities; and ensure compliance with all constraints imposed by our authorities and internal procedures; What we have accomplished specifically for our country with the tools we have been authorized; and, Where do we go from here? First, who we are, our mission. NSA is a foreign intelligence agency with two missions: We collect foreign intelligence of national security interest, and we protect certain sensitive information and U.S. networks--all this while protecting our civil liberties and privacy. NSA contributes to the security of our Nation, its Armed Forces, and our allies. NSA accomplishes this mission, while protecting civil liberties and privacy, because the Constitution we are sworn to protect and defend makes no allowances to trade one for the other. NSA operates squarely within the authorities granted by the president, Congress, and the courts. Who we are: our people. I am proud of what NSA does and more proud of our people. The National Security Agency employees take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. They have devoted themselves to protecting our Nation. Just like you, they will never forget the moment terrorists killed 2,996 Americans in New York, Pennsylvania, and the Pentagon. They witnessed the first responders' efforts to save lives. They saw the military shift to a wartime footing. They committed themselves to ensuring that another 9/11 would never happen and our deployed forces would return home. In fact, they deploy with our Armed Forces into areas of hostility. More than 6,000 have deployed in support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan; 22 have paid the ultimate sacrifice since 9/11--sadly, adding to a list of NSA/CSS personnel numbering over 170 killed in the line of duty since our formation in 1952. Theirs is a noble cause. NSA prides itself on its highly skilled workforce: We are the largest employer of mathematicians--1,013; 966 Ph.D.s and 4,374 computer scientists; linguists in more than 120 languages; more patents than any other intelligence community agency and most businesses. They are also Americans, and they take their civil liberties and privacy seriously. What we do: adapt to technology. Today's telecommunications system is literally one of the most complex systems ever devised by mankind. The fact that over 2.5 billion people all connect and communicate across a common infrastructure is a tribute to the ingenuity of mankind. The stark reality is that terrorists, criminals, and adversaries make use of the same infrastructure. Terrorists and other foreign adversaries hide in the same global network, use the same communications networks as everyone else, and take advantage of familiar services: Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, et cetera. Technology has made it easy for them. We must develop and apply the best analytic tools to succeed at our mission, finding the communications of adversaries while protecting those of innocent people, regardless of their nationality. What we do: We take direction from political leadership. NSA's direction comes from national security needs, as defined by the Nation's senior leaders. NSA does not decide what topics to collect and analyze. NSA's collection and analysis is driven by the National Intelligence Priorities Framework and received in formal tasking. We do understand that electronic surveillance capabilities are powerful tools in the hands of the state. That is why we have extensive mandatory internal training, automated checks, and an extensive regime of both internal and external oversight. What we do: We use lawful programs and tools to do our mission. The authorities we have been granted and the capabilities we have developed help keep our Nation safe. Since 9/11 we have disrupted terrorist attacks at home and abroad using capabilities informed by the lessons of 9/11. The Business Records FISA program, NSA's implementation of Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, focuses on defending the homeland by linking the foreign and domestic threats. Section 702 of FISA focuses on acquiring foreign intelligence, including critical information concerning international terrorist organizations, by targeting non-U.S. persons who are reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. NSA also operates under other sections of the FISA statute in accordance with the law's provisions. It is important to remember that in order to target a U.S. person anywhere in the world under the FISA statute, we are required to obtain a court order based on a probable cause showing that the prospective target of the surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. NSA conducts the majority of its SIGINT activities solely pursuant to the authority provided by Executive Order 12333. As I have said before, these authorities and capabilities are powerful; we take this responsibility seriously. We ensure compliance. We stood up a Directorate of Compliance in 2009 and repeatedly train our entire workforce in privacy protections and the proper use of capabilities. We do make mistakes. The vast majority of the compliance incidents reflect the challenge of implementing very specific rules in the context of ever-changing technology. Compliance incidents, with very rare exception, are unintentional and reflect the sort of errors that will occur in any complex system of technical activity. The press claimed evidence of ``thousands of privacy violations.'' This is false and misleading. According to NSA's independent Inspector General--and the Vice Chairman brought up the 12 cases, so I will just go through that quickly. There were 12 cases of willful violation. All of those were under Executive Order 12333. None of those were in the Business Records FISA or under FAA 702. We hold ourselves accountable every day. Most of these targets involved improper tasking or querying regarding foreign persons in foreign places. I am not aware of any intentional or willful violations of the FISA statute. Of the 2,776 incidents noted in the press from one of our leaked annual compliance reports, about 75 percent are not violations of approved procedures at all but, rather, NSA's detection of valid foreign targets that travel to the U.S. and a record that NSA stopped collecting, in accordance with the rules. We called those ``roamers,'' and I mispronounced that in one of the things, and it came out as ``rumors,'' but it is ``roamers.'' Let me also start to clear the air on actual compliance incidents. The vast majority of the actual compliance incidents involve foreign locations and foreign activities, as our activities are regulated by specific rules wherever they occur. For the smaller number that did involve a U.S. person, a typical incident involves a person overseas involved with a foreign organization who is subsequently determined to be a U.S. person. All initial indications and research before collection point the other way, but NSA constantly reevaluates indications. NSA detects and corrects and, in most cases, does so before any information is ever obtained, used, or shared outside NSA. Despite the difference, between willful and not, we treat incidents the same: We detect, we address, we remediate, including removing or purging information from our databases in accordance with the rules. And we report. We hold ourselves accountable and keep others informed so they can do the same. On NSA's compliance regime, Ben Wittes said, at last Friday's Intelligence Committee hearing: ``But one thing we have learned an enormous amount about is the compliance procedures that NSA uses. They are remarkable. They are detailed. They produce data streams that are extremely telling--and, to my mind, deeply reassuring.'' We welcome an ongoing discussion about how the public can, going forward, have increased information about NSA's compliance program. [The prepared statement of General Alexander appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Leahy. Well, then, let us go into that discussion, because both of you have raised concerns that the media reports about the Government surveillance programs have been incomplete, inaccurate, misleading, or some combination of that. But I worry that we are still getting inaccurate and incomplete statements from the administration. For example, we have heard over and over again the assertion that 54 terrorist plots were thwarted by the use of Section 215 and/or Section 702 authorities. That is plainly wrong. But we still get it in letters to Members of Congress; we get it in statements. These were not all plots and they were not all thwarted. The American people are getting left with the inaccurate impression of the effectiveness of NSA programs. Would you agree that the 54 cases that keep getting cited by the administration were not all plots and, of the 54, only 13 had some nexus to the U.S.? Would you agree with that--yes or no? General Alexander. Yes. Chairman Leahy. Okay. At our last hearing, Deputy Director Inglis' testimony stated that there is only really one example of a case where but for the use of Section 215 bulk phone records collection, terrorist activity was stopped. Was Mr. Inglis right? General Alexander. He was right. I believe he said two, Chairman. I may have that wrong, but I think he said two. And I would like to point out that it could only have applied in 13 of the cases because of the 54 terrorist plots or events, only 13 occurred in the U.S. Business Records FISA was only used in 12. Chairman Leahy. I understand that. But what I worry about is that some of these statements that all is well and we have these overstatements of what is going on, we are talking about massive, massive, massive collection. We are told we have to do that to protect us. And then statistics are rolled out, and if they are not accurate, it does not help with the credibility here in the Congress, it does not help with the credibility with this Chairman, and it does not help with the credibility with the country. And both of you feel free to answer this next one. This past weekend--I mentioned The New York Times article. When I read that, I see them reporting that for the past several years the NSA has been analyzing social networks, including those of Americans, using communications metadata as well as location information, tax records, voter registration records, and more. Like many of us who have access to classified briefings, we sometimes find we get far more in a newspaper--and we get a crossword puzzle, too, but we get more in the newspapers than we do in the classified briefings that you give us. According to the article, it reportedly allowed the NSA to graph the interactions of associates and locations of Americans. Now, if it is accurate, it appears to contradict earlier representations that the NSA does not compile dossiers or files on the American people. Is the NSA compiling profiles or dossiers on American people through the use of its intelligence authorities? Gentlemen, either one of you. Director Clapper. Let me comment first on the value of Section 215, where I think, unfortunately--and we may be part guilty of this--the only metric used is plots foiled. I think there is another metric here that is a very important use for Section 215. I would call it the ``peace of mind metric.'' In the case of the Boston Marathon bomber, we were using these tools and we were able to check out whether there was or was not a subsequent plot involving New York City. In the case of the AQAP threat this summer that occasioned the closure of several diplomatic facilities in the Mideast. There were a number of selectors that emerged from our collection overseas that pointed to the United States. Each one of them was checked out and was found not to be relevant to a domestic aspect of a terrorist plot. Chairman Leahy. Mr. Clapper, we will certainly give you time to add to that, if you like, but could you go back to my question? Is the NSA compiling profiles or dossiers on the American people through the use of its intelligence authorities? Director Clapper. In every case, for valid foreign intelligence purposes, let me go to General Alexander. General Alexander. Those reports are inaccurate and wrong. Chairman Leahy. So The New York Times is wrong in its article? General Alexander. Absolutely. Here are the facts. What they have taken is the fact that we do take data to enrich it. What is not in front of those statements is the word ``foreign,'' foreign information to understand what the foreign nexus is of a problem set that we are looking at. How do you know what an individual is, a terrorist, without having any data to enrich it, with just a number? In the foreign space, we need that. The Supplemental Procedures and Guidelines Governing Communications Metadata Analysis, the SPCMA article that this was about, allows NSA to not just stop when we are tracking a terrorist if we hit a U.S. number, which is what we used to have to do. It allows us to go back and see where that goes and where it comes into or out of the country and what are the problems outside the country---- Chairman Leahy. Which authority are you using for this analysis? First off, I just want to make sure I understand. You are saying The New York Times is flat-out wrong in their article. General Alexander. I am saying they are flat-out wrong saying that we are creating dossiers on American---- Chairman Leahy. Are you going into social networks? General Alexander. No. Here is what we---- Chairman Leahy. Okay. What, if anything, is accurate in The New York Times article? General Alexander. The accuracy is the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General did approve the Supplemental Procedures Governing Communications Metadata Analysis in 2009. What that allows us to do is use metadata that we have acquired under Executive Order 12333 in chain, whether it is phone records or emails, through U.S. selectors to figure out social networks abroad. I will tell you that there are cases---- Chairman Leahy. That 2009 order is still being used? General Alexander. That is correct. But there are cases--I need to clarify because I want to make sure this is 100 percent accurate. There are cases where the FBI might start a terrorist threat here in the United States. If there is a terrorist threat in the United States and they get a warrant to go after that or a FISA, then we can use SPCMA to go after that. We can use this to look at hostages overseas, U.S. hostages. We can look at this to track industries, because U.S. companies are also considered U.S. persons under this law, that are the targets of terrorist communications. What we are not doing: We are not creating social networks on our families. We are not doing that. And the insinuation that we are doing that is flat wrong. And I take exception to them taking a classified document that dealt with foreign, not understanding it and saying therefore it must apply to---- Chairman Leahy. You told The Times this? General Alexander. Chairman? Chairman Leahy. Have you made this complaint or responded to The New York Times on this? General Alexander. Yes. I think the issue is, you know, here they have all these documents that they are trying to leak out without having the understanding. We did give them insights. They did not take all the data. I do not know what and why. I do not---- Chairman Leahy. What you are doing, is it being reviewed by the FISA Court? General Alexander. Not in all cases. Some of these cases that deal with Executive Order 12333 are not reviewed by the FISA Court. Those that would fall under the Business Records 215, 702, -3, and -4 would be. So these would not be reviewed, but they are reviewed by the administration, and they are audited by our people. Chairman Leahy. My time is up. You have raised more---- Senator Grassley. I think you ought to take more time. This transparency--because one of the problems we have with this program, there is not enough transparency. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. You know, I worry--you say it is Executive authority, not FISA Court authority. Does anybody have oversight other than the executive branch? General Alexander. Well, Congress, too. And let me---- Chairman Leahy. Has this been reported to the Congress---- General Alexander. They get all---- Chairman Leahy [continuing]. Either of the Intelligence Committees? General Alexander. I believe both of these have, and I would have to go back and check, but both of these have gone to the Committee. I think you have both of these. And, Chairman, you bring out a good point, and for the complete transparency, Chairman, you brought out a good question, and if I could, I think this will help greatly. The issue that we have here is how do you use metadata, which is the least intrusive, to understand a problem that our Nation could face. That is the Business Records. And so we use that globally, and sometimes it touches the United States. Chairman Leahy. Well, metadata, you say the least intrusive. Many might think it is the most intrusive, and I will tell you why. And I realize there is a lot of metadata going on. We shop at the grocery store; you use your grocery store credit card; the ads you are going to get are going to be different if you are buying things for young children or if you are buying a nice bottle of wine. We all understand that. But do you understand the concern as more and more things come out, when it turns out, for example, the NSA, some members--and I realize not by authority--were checking their love interests through using the tools of NSA. You know, Americans like their privacy. They like their security, but they like their privacy, too. And you understand the concern that we are getting. Simply following the metadata, a lot of people think if they are on social media and whatnot that there is some expectation of privacy, less obviously but some. General Alexander. So I do agree, Chairman, but I think the differentiation that I make in terms of metadata for these purposes is the phone numbers to-from or the email addressed to-from. And the issue that I think we face in trying to figure out where we take this legislation is how do we do this in such a way that we can ensure the American people know that we are doing it exactly right and protect the Nation? From my perspective, what we have done is set up two things. We have put this database, with tremendous oversight-- this has more oversight than any program in Government--the courts, the administration, and Congress, and our IGs and everyone. And every time we make a mistake, we self-report. Why do we need it? And General Clapper brought out a great point. It is the start. It does not necessarily lead us to the end. It tells us you need to look more here. Oftentimes we give that to the FBI. Now, yes, the FBI and we need to do better work in keeping the metrics of what resulted from that. But, in addition, it helps us looking overseas to say why is that person important and how do we tell you if this is a real threat or something that we should ignore. This summer, this was huge for us. Chairman Leahy. I will come back to some of my skepticism. One other thing. We have tried to make sure that it is kept--an issue like this, I want to try to maintain the bipartisan nature, and I want to thank Senator Grassley because he expressed some of these concerns. And while he would normally go next, the Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee has to leave for another meeting, so he has yielded to her. Senator Feinstein. Thank you. Chairman Leahy. Chuck, I appreciate that. Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Chairman Leahy. I am stepping out for a phone call, and I will be right back. Senator Feinstein [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to use my time to say something to my colleagues. I believe maybe only Senator Hatch was on the Intelligence Committee in 2001. In mid-year, the DCI, whose name was George Tenet, came in to meet with us, and what he said was that he predicted that within 3 months there would likely be an attack on this country. He did not know what. He did not know when. He did not know how. As a matter of fact, I went on CNN on July 1, 2001, and said this: ``There is a major possibility of a terrorist incident within the next 3 months.'' That is a direct quote from what I said. Then something took place which I thought could never take place in this country, and that is 9/11. I never believed there could be training schools for pilots who would teach people how to fly but not to land in this country. I never thought our visa system was so weak that they could admit terrorists to this country. But I was totally wrong. The event happened, and it was catastrophic--for people, for this Nation, for our standing, but most importantly, because of the death and destruction that it brought about this country. And then we learned that there were stovepipes and our intelligence was inadequate and we could not collect enough data. And then we learned that there was a man by the name of Khalid al-Mihdhar, one of the group in San Diego. I believe that if this were to happen again with this program and other programs working in combination, we have an opportunity to pick that up. Absent these kinds of technological programs, we do not have an opportunity to pick that up. This is a very hard culture to meet with human intelligence. It is a different culture. The language is different. There are many dialects. The groups are tight. It is very difficult to permeate them. So our great strength today, ladies and gentlemen, in protecting this homeland is to be able to have the kind of technology that is able to piece together data while protecting rights. I listened to this program being described as a surveillance program. It is not. There is no content collected by the NSA. There are bits of data--location, telephone numbers--that can be queried when there is reasonable, articulable suspicion. If it looks like it is something for an individual in this country, it then goes to the FBI for a probable cause warrant, and a full investigation takes place. I so regret what is happening. I will do everything I can to prevent this program from being canceled out. There is going to be a bill in my Committee to do it. There is a bill in this Committee to do it. And, unfortunately, very few of us sat on that Committee when George Tenet came in in June 2001 and said, ``We anticipate a strike, but we do not know what, we do not know where, we do not know when.'' That can never be allowed to happen in the United States of America again. And that is the basis for this program. It is legal. We are looking at increased transparency. We are looking to make some changes in it. But we are not looking to destroy it. To destroy it is to make this Nation more vulnerable. I just wanted to say that. I had to say it. Thank you. Senator. Senator Grassley. Go ahead with your questions. Senator Feinstein. Pardon me? Senator Grassley. Do you have any questions? Senator Feinstein. I do not have any questions. Thank you. Senator Grassley. Let me make clear something I said to the Chairman to keep asking his questions, because we need more transparency. I do not know exactly how much transparency we ought to have. You folks know that. I do not know your business. Your number one responsibility is protecting our national security. But whatever that balance is between security and transparency, we ought to have it, because I firmly believe that a lot of these issues that Senator Feinstein wants to protect would not be coming up if more had been told about it over the last few years. I do not think the impact of Mr. Snowden would have--well, I do not want to comment on that. But, anyway, I think that in our system, transparency brings accountability. I am going to start out where I left off, and it is not an accusation against the intelligence community if the information is accurate. I am going to ask a question, but before you want to answer it, I want to tell you why I am cynical about these statements about what sequestration and what the shutdown will do that you made and other people have made, and that comes yesterday with the closing down of the World War II Monument. We had World War II veterans coming in on honor flights, and they had barricades around something that I will bet 24/7/365 I could walk into that any time. And so the show of putting barriers around because of a shutdown and spending all the money to do it and then to have every other department talk about shutdowns causes me to be a little cynical. Now, I am not putting your work in the same category as the Park Service. Do not read me wrong. But if, in fact, 70 percent of the intelligence community is now furloughed, if that is true, is that an honest assessment that these employees are non-essential? I am concerned that if your lawyers have determined that 70 percent of your employees are non-essential to your mission, then you either need better lawyers or you need to make big changes to your workforce. Can you tell me whether those reports are accurate or not? Director Clapper. Well, first of all, sir, we do not consider any of our employees non-essential. But for purposes of this law, the criterion is ``necessary to protect against imminent threat to life or property,'' so that causes us to make some very, very painful choices about who we keep on and who we except. I would comment on your commentary about the monument closures, and that precisely illustrates the challenge we have in intelligence on conveying the impacts of these cuts, because obviously people see the impact of closing public parks. In the case of intelligence, it is insidious. So capabilities that we degrade today or give up, we may not see the impact of those for weeks or months or for an extended period. Much harder to rationalize. But I do not want any doubt about the necessity--the importance of all of our employees. And as I said earlier, as each day goes by, the impact and the jeopardy to the safety and security of this country will increase. Senator Grassley. General Alexander, my first question. FISA Court opinions show that there were significant problems implementing 215 phone records that were discovered in 2009, showing that the NSA was inadvertently assessing the phone record metadata without required reasonable and articulable connection to terrorism. Those problems were apparently not resolved with the Court until late that year. Since then, I understand that every query of the metadata is audited by the Department of Justice, and any compliance issues must be reported immediately to the FISA Court. My first question: Precisely when did the Department begin auditing every query of the metadata? Since then, has the Department determined on any occasion that the reasonable and articulable suspicion standard was not followed? General Alexander. So I know of--first I will answer the second first and walk backward. I know of no cases where we have not followed the reasonable, articulable suspicion standard, and it has always been auditable since the inception of the program. But the issue you bring out, if I could just take 1 minute on that, because we did make a mistake. The way we do analysis on the foreign intelligence that we collect was to set up what we called an ``alert list,'' and that alert list would run against the data that comes in and tell us if there was something on a terrorist that--these alert lists were terrorist numbers that we were tracking. What we had not done is reasonable, articulable suspicion on all terrorist numbers. What we were using it for is to say there is a lot of activity on this number, you ought to go do reasonable, articulable suspicion so you can look into the data. It was a discrepancy between our technical folks who set it up and our legal folks. And we did it wrong, and we misrepresented it to the Court several times in subsequent procedures of renewals. That drove us to set up a Directorate of Compliance that would actually look at the technical side and the legal side and make sure we cross-walked this 100 percent. And I think that has been successful, and that is something that we worked with both the Intel Committees and the White House. Senator Grassley. Second to you, how does the NSA handle instances when a phone number may have been connected to a terrorist group in the past, but NSA knows it is no longer associated with that group? Is there a mechanism so that a query of the metadata can be done that is limited only against the records for certain time periods? General Alexander. I am not sure I understand this all the way, but let me see if I have got it right. The answer is if a number changes from Person A to Person B over the life of it, how do we adapt to that? That is a difficult technical issue and one that our analysts have to look at, because what you would actually get is two sets of called people. Senator Sessions has one set of people he talks to. You have a different set. What you would see is those sets come together in different times. And the answer is, yes, our analysts can actually delete the second part and say those are of no interest, I am only looking at this first part, because part of the Business Records FISA does have a date-time group, a duration of call, and the to-and-from number. Senator Grassley. I would like to follow up with Mr. Clapper on my first question. Does America remain safe even with the shutdown? Director Clapper. I have to qualify that, sir. I do not feel that I can make such a guarantee to the American people, and it would be much more difficult to make such a guarantee as each day of the shutdown goes by. I am very concerned about the jeopardy of the country because of this. Senator Grassley. Can I have one more question? Chairman Leahy. Of course. I just want to make sure I--what you are saying is, it becomes cumulative? You are saying the danger and threat become cumulative? Director Clapper. Yes, sir. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. Senator Grassley. General Alexander, I hope you are familiar with the Inspector General's letter to me in which he provides certain details about 12 documented instances of NSA employees intentionally or willfully abusing their surveillance authority. The details in it are alarming to me, so I have a follow-up question. I noticed that almost all of these cases involved NSA employees stationed abroad. Does that suggest to you that the mechanism to catch this kind of conduct at your domestic facilities are somewhat insufficient? And what else could account for the disparity? General Alexander. So it is much more difficult to track a foreign number and understand when somebody is doing something on a foreign number that is inappropriate. Those can oftentimes be misleading statements by the analyst saying, ``I am looking at this for A,'' and actually it is a girlfriend. In the United States, it is different. Against a U.S. number or against an email address, those are flagged, and the system automatically sees that you are doing something against a U.S. person and the auditing procedures come in right away. Against a foreign number overseas, you do not get those flags, but it is an extremely important point to note that even on a foreign person, if we make a mistake, we hold our people accountable. There is no call for that. It is supposed to be against a foreign intelligence purpose, and you saw the outcome of those 12 cases, what happened in each one in that letter that the Inspector General sent to you. Senator Grassley. One follow-up: One of the pieces of information I asked the Inspector General for was the law or legal authority that the employee violated. As I read the response, none of these 12 cases involved either the phone records collection program under 215 or the collection program under 702. Is that correct? General Alexander. That is correct, Senator. And if I could, also it is important to note this was over a decade. This went from 2003 forward. And, you know, when you look at the number of casualties we had in Iraq, seven of those people, as you know, were NSA, of those 12. When you look at it, you are 3 times more likely to die defending our country in Iraq or Afghanistan than committing a willful and knowing violation against a foreign or U.S. person. Senator Grassley. My last question on this is for Mr. Clapper. If you cannot tell us that America is safe, why then do you not simply use your authority to furlough fewer employees? Director Clapper. Sir, we are going to look at that. In fact, we are going to do it every day to see where we need to-- what is the right talent set or analytic expertise that we need. We are doing that as we speak. So I anticipate, if this thing drags out, that we will make adjustments and probably recall more people, particularly in NSA's case, since they have a heavy military population which are not furloughed. So early on, NSA has kept--has excepted a very low percentage of its civilian employees. I am confident--I am sure that over time that condition cannot continue. Chairman Leahy. Unfortunately--one, I happen to agree with you, Director, what you say. Unfortunately, we have a law passed in the 1800s that is creating a real problem on the furloughing. It was passed at a time when nobody could have anticipated either the size of the Government or the complexity of Government, but it is tying your hands. Senator Whitehouse. Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman. Welcome, gentlemen. We have identified terrorist threats to our country overseas. Correct? General Alexander. Correct. Senator Whitehouse. And we track their electronic communications. Correct? General Alexander. Correct, Senator. Senator Whitehouse. Is it important to know who they may be in touch with within the United States, those terrorist threats that are overseas? General Alexander. Yes, it is. Senator Whitehouse. And they might be using intermediaries or cutouts between the principal that they are trying to reach and themselves. Correct? General Alexander. That is correct. Senator Whitehouse. That would be Tradecraft 101. Correct? So records of call and email connections are necessary to allow you to look for those networks. Correct? General Alexander. That is correct. Senator Whitehouse. Now, in the call and email connections are information that has for decades been declared by courts and demonstrated by law enforcement practice throughout this country to be not within the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Correct? Director Clapper. Correct. Senator Whitehouse. So the program is legal, but it risks abuse. Director Clapper. You are right. Senator Whitehouse. You concede to that. Could you describe--and if you want to fill this out with a request for the record, an answer for the record--the various oversight mechanisms and bodies whose job it is to assure that this program is kept within bounds that protect the privacy needs of American citizens? Director Clapper. Well, yes, sir. First, as General Alexander described---- Senator Whitehouse. How many committees of Congress, for instance, have oversight over the metadata program? Director Clapper. Well, certainly the two intelligence committees do, and I think this Committee as well. Senator Whitehouse. And here we are, so here is another one, and presumably House Judiciary Committee and subcommittees as well---- Director Clapper. Right, four. Senator Whitehouse [continuing]. That are relevant, presumably. Correct? Director Clapper. Yes, sir. Senator Whitehouse. The Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism would have jurisdiction? Director Clapper. Could. Senator Whitehouse. How many Inspectors General have---- Director Clapper. Well, the NSA Inspector General certainly; my Inspector General, who was Senate confirmed, does. So starting with the level of NSA itself, with the Director of Compliance that was set up in 2009 and, additionally, before shutdown, 300 compliance officers whose exclusive duty is to oversee the legal and technical aspects of this. That in turn is overseen by my office and the Attorney General as well as, of course, the FISA Court, which oversees these processes, as well, of course, as---- Senator Whitehouse. Civil Liberties Advisory Boards? Director Clapper. I am sorry? Senator Whitehouse. Do you have Civil Liberties Advisory Boards? Director Clapper. I do. There is a Civil Liberties and Privacy Board, although I need to mention that is only for counterterrorism purposes. I have by law also a Privacy and Civil Liberties officer whose full-time job is to serve as the conscience for the entire IC on---- Senator Whitehouse. If I could ask you just to fill--there is a lot, and if you could--I will make these questions for the record, if you could get that back, because I do not think there has been a clear and simple exposition of what all the different oversight mechanisms are, and I would like to get that for the record. I am concerned that in the wake of the Snowden incident-- let me put it this way: It is not clear to me that any legal redress is being considered or sought against either Dell or Booz Allen Hamilton, the employers of Snowden at the time that he committed his unauthorized release of classified information. I do not have the information before me to make a detailed analysis of whether the basic doctrine of respondeat superior would apply, which makes the employer liable if the agent acted within the course and scope of his employment or whether this would be an ultra vires act of some kind. But my concern is that there--I am not aware of even any conversation about that. And as we have seen from classified programs in the past, there is a danger that the private contractors managing the program begin to wag the dog and that we become so dependent on our private contractors that we cannot seek legal redress for their misdeeds because, frankly, they are now the ones who we depend on to the extent that we cannot use the authorities that are pertinent to us as customers. General Alexander. Senator, when this incident broke, I flew out to Hawaii with some of our folks and talked to the people that were involved, including the contracting officer representatives, past and present, and what we had done and working with our folks on this. I will tell you that one of the contracting officer representatives did exactly what you would expect her to do. When asked to get access to some of this, she denied it to Snowden formally. He worked around that, those procedures. But I think you can see that those things--so we have asked our folks to look at this. We do have that question from you, and I would like to take that for the record, if I could, to get you the answer. Senator Whitehouse. Good. I just want to make sure that they are not too big to sue. General Alexander. Right. [The information referred to appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Leahy. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. You have asked the question I want to emphasize. I am very interested in that answer, too. Senator Hatch is gone. Senator Sessions. Sorry. One of the problems of a broken rib, it is harder to turn around and check on you, but, Senator Sessions, go ahead. Senator Sessions. Thank you. This is an important hearing, and I thank you all. I would just note that the House has repeatedly passed funding, Director Clapper, to restore the Defense Department and not allow the sequester cuts to occur. And I hope you have not forgotten the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I believe the Commander-in-Chief has a responsibility here, too, and the law, the Budget Control Act, of which sequester was a part, required us to maintain a certain level. Whole agencies and departments have gotten zero cuts and Defense has gotten too much, in my opinion. The House has tried to reconcile that, and I hope somehow we can soon alleviate some of the stress on the Defense Department and the intelligence community. So, number one, I visited NSA, General Alexander, and I was so impressed with the leadership there and the people I met, and I have said that publicly. So I was deeply disappointed-- hurt, really--to hear that somebody had looked at their girlfriend's messages and that kind of thing. Are you saying that all of that was abroad first? General Alexander. Senator, nine of those were abroad, three were CONUS but involved persons abroad on two of those, and one was on a spouse or girlfriend---- Senator Sessions. Well, there is a great temptation there. I trust that you stepped up your emphasis and your determination not to allow that to happen. Even though it is not a large number, it is still unacceptable. General Alexander. Absolutely. And I will tell you that what Senator Grassley brought out in the letter that we sent to him, we are also putting out to our workforce so that more people understand what has happened to those people, because when you read that---- Senator Sessions. They have all been disciplined? General Alexander. All but one, and in that case, the case was insufficient. I do not have the disciplinary actions in that one, but all either retired, resigned, received Article 15s, or letters of reprimand with additional consequences. Senator Sessions. Well, I think Senator Whitehouse--and he is a former United States Attorney, Federal prosecutor-- clarifying something, and, General Alexander, let me just ask you again: So when you are looking at the metadata, you are referring to numbers, phone numbers, email addresses perhaps. No messaging are in this data. Is that right? No substance of a communication? General Alexander. That is correct. And, Senator, in the metadata program, it is only phone numbers. There are no email addresses in it. Senator Sessions. Now, Senator Whitehouse in his time as United States Attorney probably issued subpoenas, thousands, maybe ten thousand. In my 12 years as United States Attorney, no telling how many thousand subpoenas we have issued---- Senator Whitehouse. Rhode Island is more law-abiding than that, Senator Sessions. [Laughter.] Senator Whitehouse. It was just in the hundreds. Senator Sessions. We had plenty of crooks in my district, I can assure you. [Laughter.] Senator Sessions. The point of which is, it does not require a search warrant to obtain from the telephone company the person's call records. That is done by simple subpoena without--it is simply--and the test is: Is it relevant to the investigation? So if somebody is thought to be a member of a gang and he says he does not know Bad Guy 1 and you subpoena his records and he has got 50 phone calls and 20 of them were within an hour of the crime occurring, then that is hugely valuable, and that is just done all the time. So we need to understand that the fundamental process here is well within, it seems to me, the traditions of our ability to subpoena--the records are in the possession of the phone company. They are the phone company's records. They are not your personal records. And that is the difference in it. Senator Feinstein's story was so fabulous, Mr. Clapper. It just laid the whole structure out for us. I know you have said this before, but could you tell us, did these leaks negatively impact your ability to be as effective as otherwise if they had not happened, and did it hurt our ability to identify an attack in the future? Director Clapper. To my mind, there is absolutely no question about that. We are already seeing signs of changes in target behavior because of their awareness as a result of the revelations in these unauthorized leaks. It has done great damage to partners overseas and our relationships with them. People's lives are at risk here because of data that Mr. Snowden purloined. So the damage, the full extent of it is yet to be measured. Senator Sessions. Well, I thank you for your work, and my impression from the people I have met at NSA is that they are dedicated, wonderful Americans who are working every day to preserve and defend this country, unlike Mr. Snowden, who damaged this country. And, fundamentally I think that we can do a better job of monitoring it, and the American people, I am glad to say, are alert. They are not going to tolerate abuses, and they should not. And the press has a right to do their job within the realm of law. But I hope that--it is unthinkable that we would dismantle this program, and I would certainly oppose that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. It appears a lot of it is being dismantled by the Government shutdown, but that is just my view. Senator Klobuchar. Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you, Director and General. Chairman Leahy. And I would note that in about 15 minutes I am going to be slipping out, not because--I am telling you in advance so you will not think it is because of anything you said. Senator Blumenthal is going to take over the chair. Senator Klobuchar. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Director and General. I want to go back to some of your earlier comments about the effect of the shutdown on the intelligence community. I think it is very important as we sit here today. I note that in your testimony you talked about how 966 Ph.D.s, 4,374 computer scientists, really 72 percent of the civilian workforce in the intelligence community are not going to be able to do their jobs right now, and that includes people who are connecting and collecting signals, engineers who put the systems back together, people who are on the ground across the world. You indicated that the law requires you to furlough employees not involved in addressing an imminent threat. Is that right, Director Clapper? Director Clapper. That is correct: against an imminent threat to life or property. Senator Klobuchar. But is it not true that a threat that is not considered imminent today could be imminent tomorrow? Director Clapper. Exactly. That is why we have to manage this on a day-to-day basis as best we can. Senator Klobuchar. So you would have to figure out if a threat is imminent and spend time doing that with your lawyers and then add someone back in? Director Clapper. That is exactly right, and we will have to shuffle people in and out depending on what we believe the concern of the day is. Senator Klobuchar. But you clearly see it as a risk to security? Director Clapper. Absolutely. Senator Klobuchar. And in your assessment, how much risk are we exposed to because we have had to furlough our intelligence professionals who are covering issues that you cannot define right now as ``imminent''? Director Clapper. Well, I do not know if you want mathematical quantification, but certainly on a percentage of our civilian professionals, you know, the risk is, you know, 75 percent more than it was yesterday, I guess. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. I think that is pretty significant. I appreciated Senator Feinstein's comments she made on the floor about this, and I know she cannot give out all the information, nor can you. But I think people have to understand that this is a significant layoff that we are dealing with right now, temporary as it may be. These threats, as I have learned, change from day to day, and you need people on the ground to be able to respond to them. So thank you for that. I wanted to go back. I thought our July 31st hearing was good and informative on the surveillance programs, and then right after that, I was a little surprised--and I know the Chairman mentioned some of this, but in mid-August the media began reporting about an internal audit from May 2012 which found that the NSA violated privacy rules over 2,000 times. We have gotten into some of those facts and what that really means, and I am just concerned about why that did not come out during the hearing. General Alexander. So, Senator, every quarter, internal to NSA, we put together compliance reports that track both under the Business Records FISA, 702, 703, -4, and our Executive order. We compile that because we hold our people accountable to it. Included in there are incidents. These are not privacy violations. These are incidents. And then we pass those up to the Department of Justice, to DNI, so that everybody knows that everything that we see has been tracked. It is important to note that the majority of those, roughly 75 percent, of those incidents are not privacy violations. Those are us tracking---- Senator Klobuchar. No, I understand that. My point is more of a process one, that we have a hearing and then we find out a week later that these audits were out there that we did not learn about at the hearing. General Alexander. Yes, so I think what we were going over, we have a number of incidents that we track on 702 and 215. That is what we are talking about here. Most of these incidents that are in these reports reflect us typing in a wrong number, doing a search on Individual A overseas. So these are what we will call minor violations. The major ones were the ones that we brought up, which were---- Senator Klobuchar. Okay. I actually do understand---- Director Clapper. I think the answer to your question, Senator, is that the subject matter of the hearing was 215 and 702, and these 12 violations over 10 years occurred under--the foreign collection under the auspices of Executive Order 12333. Senator Klobuchar. All right. It is just that I thought we were kind of broadly asking questions, and it would have been nice to have heard about it there, but that is behind us now, and I want to talk about some of the reforms that have been suggested. You know, there is legislation out there. One of the reforms that President Obama has supported is the idea that we would have a privacy watchdog installed at the NSA, and an intelligence community website would be created to disseminate public information on the activities. What is the status of these reforms? General Alexander. So on the first one, we do have a hiring action out on the street. It is probably stopped right now because of the furlough, but we do have one for our civil liberties privacy advocate for NSA. Director Clapper. And we have activated a web page under my office to put out this data. Senator Klobuchar. Okay. And you suggested a court- appointed amicus for cases that involve novel and significant questions of law. I am just interested in how this would work in practice. What is an example of a novel and significant case? Director Clapper. Obviously, we are getting a little out of our compartment here and more into the Department of Justice, but some form of an advocate or amicus who would be a participant when called upon by the court to address issues of law or major surveillance questions. But I think we would need to defer to the Department of Justice on exactly the mechanics of how the administration would recommend that work. Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Thank you. And did you want to add anything, General? General Alexander. I agree with what he said. I learned what an amicus was during these briefings, so it has got to---- Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Well, I will have some follow-up questions on the record, but I did want to again emphasize that it is really important that people understand that 72 percent of the civilian workforce of the intelligence agencies is now on furlough and the effect that that could have on our national security and the reason that we have to end this shutdown. Thank you. Chairman Leahy. Senator Graham. Senator Graham. Thank you both for your service. From my point of view, I am sure every organization makes mistakes, and if anybody has abused these programs to spy on their spouse or to spy on their neighbor or to do something in that fashion, I hope they go to jail, because I think most of the people in the NSA would like that outcome, because that is not exactly what you are there to do. Do you agree with that, General Alexander? General Alexander. Senator, I agree that they should be punished, and depending on the action, how harsh---- Senator Graham. Yes, I mean, whatever the appropriate punishment is, but they are outliers. General Alexander. That is right, Senator. In fact, two of them were done under Field Grade Article 15s. Senator Graham. Right. General Alexander. And when you actually look at what they did, you can see that, okay, we trained them, they immediately did something wrong, they got no return. Oh, by the way, they just asked the question. They did not get information back. But they did something wrong, and they were held accountable. Senator Graham. Good. The point is that when you do things wrong, you should be held accountable. When you do things right, you should be appreciated. I think both of you are trying to do things right to protect our Nation, and I appreciate everybody that works for you, because I know many of them, and they are patriots as much as anybody who criticizes the program. All right. Did you tell the President of the United States what you just told us, that because of the Government shutdown, our Nation is less secure? Director Clapper. Yes, I did. Senator Graham. What did he say? Director Clapper. We discussed it yesterday. Senator Graham. Well, you just scared the hell out of all of us--at least I am scared, when you are telling me that 70 percent of the NSA is unable to go to work, not because they are necessary but because of the statute, the way it is worded. Both of you made very clear presentations to this Committee that the Government shutdown in a post-9/11 world is making this Nation less safe. Is that right, General Alexander? General Alexander. That is correct, Senator. Senator Graham. Is that right, Mr. Clapper? Director Clapper. Absolutely. Yes, sir. Senator Graham. Well, to Mr. Gibbs, who told the President--his political adviser, former press secretary, he advised the President to just watch the shutdown. Do you think that is a responsible thing for the President to do as Commander-in-Chief, to not negotiate or just watch the shutdown? Director Clapper. Well, I am not going to--I would like to avoid the---- Senator Graham. Well, you do not have to. I will give you my own opinion. I think it is irresponsible for all of us to let it continue, but where the hell is the Commander-in-Chief? If you really told him that, that our Nation is less safe and every day that goes by we are being less capable of detecting potential terrorist attacks against the homeland and the approach is to just watch time go by, why are the Members of the House and the Senate not in the White House right now to try to solve this problem? One of two things is true: You are telling us the truth, and the Federal Government leadership on both sides are ignoring it, particularly the Commander-in-Chief; or, you are overstating the case. I think you are telling us the truth, so I am not even going to go down the road you are overstating the case. But I want the American people to know there are shutdowns before 9/11 and there are shutdowns after 9/11, and there is a huge difference. And for the President of the United States, for our House Democrats to not negotiate, is irresponsible. For our Republican Party not to try to find a way to end this mess is irresponsible. So I hope that the President will do more than watch. Now, about 9/11, General Alexander, if we had had the technology and the programs in place today before 9/11, what would be the likelihood that we would have detected that attack? General Alexander. Senator, in my professional opinion, it would have been very high. Senator Graham. Do you agree with that? Director Clapper. I do. Senator Graham. I am here to tell the American people, if we had in place today before 9/11, the 19 hijackers who were here in the country, most of them in legal status, talking to people abroad, we would have known what they were up to. We would have known why the guy was just taking flying lessons to take the plane off and did not care about the part of the flying lessons to land it, which was kind of odd to me--I want to pay for flying lessons, but I do not care to learn to land the plane. So at the end of the day, my question to both of you is simple. Let us reform this program where it has gotten out of line. Let us be sensitive to the political--to the constitutional rights we all have. But here is my question: What is being proposed in terms of reform, will it make us less able to detect the next 9/11? Are we going back to that pre-9/ 11 mentality? That is the question for me. Is the Congress taking us back to a time when we could not pick up a threat that was right in front of us? Director Clapper. Well, Senator, there are several proposals that have been proposed in the form of bills, and I guess our basic reaction to this is we are open to changes to make this more transparent, for more oversight, but in doing so we do not want to overcorrect such that we lose the operational utility and the agility of these programs. Senator Graham. Same for you, General Alexander. Will you tell me when you think we have crossed that line? General Alexander. Senator, absolutely. I feel it is my responsibility to tell you and the Director of National Intelligence and the President that they are going to hurt us. Senator Graham. Very quickly. About the times in which we live, are there active efforts by terrorist organizations to penetrate the United States? General Alexander. Yes. Director Clapper. Absolutely, yes, sir; as we speak. Senator Graham. Do you believe there are people probably already here as part of a fifth column movement? Director Clapper. There are sleeper--there is sleeper presence, absolutely. I would not call it a unified fifth column. There are various entities---- Senator Graham. Fair enough, and I will end with this thought. My goal is to make sure that if a known terrorist, al- Zawahiri, who took bin Laden's place, if he is calling someone in the United States, I want to know who he is talking to. Is that a fair thing for me to want for my country? Director Clapper. Yes, sir, and I think it is a fair requirement for any citizen. Senator Graham. And is it also fair to say that before you can keep the content or do something with the content, you have to get a warrant? Director Clapper. Yes. Senator Graham. Last thought. Are we at war as a Nation with radical Islam, or are we fighting a crime? And what is the difference when it comes to gathering intelligence between fighting a war and fighting a criminal enterprise? Director Clapper. Well, one difference--and it is more of a tradecraft difference--is the evidentiary standard that we struggle with since we are dealing with wispy hints, bits and pieces of information that probably do not necessarily meet the probable cause standard. That is another consideration we have with changes to these laws. General Alexander. Senator, I do believe it is a war on terrorism, my words, and that what we are seeing today is going to get worse with what we are seeing go through the Middle East, what is going on in Syria, the actions in Iraq over the last week, and in Afghanistan. The week concluding 23 September, 972 people were killed in Kenya, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and over 1,000 injured. When you look at what we--the relative safety we have here, it is no accident. It is the work of our military and our intelligence community keeping this country safe, and we need the tools to do that. Senator Blumenthal [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Graham. Senator Klobuchar. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted, in response to Senator Graham, to let him know that a few minutes ago the White House just announced that the congressional leaders had accepted their invitation to come and meet today. So they must have heard you from here, but also, again, if we would pass the Senate bill, the House would pass the Senate bill, then the shutdown would end. I think that is important for people to know. Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Franken. Senator Franken. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Clapper, General Alexander, you and your employees protect our country, and I am grateful for that. Thank you. I have a bill, the Surveillance Transparency Act, that will address what I think is the central problem in this debate, and that is the fact that, despite the large amount of Americans' information that is being collected under the foreign intelligence law, those laws lack any substantial public reporting requirements. The Government does not have to give even a rough estimate of how many Americans' information is being collected, and it does not have to tell Americans how much of their information is actually seen by national security officials. What's more, the companies that get information requests are under strict orders, strict gag orders, so they are not allowed to give the public information. The American people are smart. They understand that we need to give weight to both national security and civil liberties. But when the public lacks even the most basic information about the scope of these programs, they have no way of knowing if we are getting that balance right. My bill would change this. It would make the Government give annual statistics on the number of Americans' information collected and the number whose information is actually reviewed. It would also let companies disclose agreements and disclose aggregate statistics on the number of requests they get and the number of accounts affected. I am very pleased to report that yesterday morning America's leading tech companies from Apple to Google to Microsoft to Facebook to Twitter to Yahoo, all of these companies sent a letter supporting my bill, urging this Committee and Congress to pass it. And, without objection, Mr. Chairman, I will enter a copy of this into the record. Senator Blumenthal. Without objection. [The letter appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Franken. For my first question, I just want to give an example of why I think greater transparency is so desperately needed. As Senator Grassley and Senator Leahy indicated, this past Saturday, The New York Times ran a story alleging that NSA gathers data on the social connections of U.S. citizens. The article gave a series of examples of the kind of sensitive data that is allegedly collected to create detailed graphs of some Americans' social connections. Both of you have clarified some of the inaccuracies in that story. But here is the thing. If Americans knew that this kind of collection was limited to a small number of people, people who we have reason to believe are foreign agents or involved in terrorism, I frankly think that most of them would be fine with that. But there is nothing in that article that gives any sense of whether this affects tens or hundreds or thousands or millions of people, and that is because the information just is not out there. This lack of information, frankly, scares people and causes distrust. It makes them distrust our Government. Director C"
