I lost a friend that day Being the first officer on the scene and also responding to same call he was call out for, it is a day I will never forget. Another officer and I was on the scene of the breakin, when a lot of static came across the radio, I told the officer that sounded like a train, next call was clear, it reported a car had been hit by a train, at this time not knowing it was one of our own.
