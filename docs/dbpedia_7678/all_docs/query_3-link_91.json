WhatsApp currently has 450 million active users worldwide, many of whom objected when Facebook announced the proposed acquisition in February. Facebook also operates a messaging service, although Facebook messaging is notorious for its extensive data collection practices. EPIC's complaint highlights that Facebook regularly incorporates data from companies it has acquired. For example, prior to Facebook's purchase of the photo-sharing application Instagram in 2012, Instagram users' data was not used for advertisements in the app. After the acquisition, however, \" Facebook did in fact access Instagram users' data and changed the Instagram Terms of Service to reflect this change.\" According to the EPIC complaint, \"WhatsApp users could not reasonably have anticipated that by selecting a pro-privacy messaging service, they would subject their data to Facebook's data collection practices.\" The complaint states: \"As set forth in detail below, WhatsApp built a user base based on its commitment not to collect user data for advertising revenue. Acting in reliance on WhatsApp representations, Internet users provided detailed personal information to the company including private text to close friends. Facebook routinely makes use of user information for advertising purposes and has made clear that it intends to incorporate the data of WhatsApp users into the user profiling business model. The proposed acquisition will therefore violate WhatsApp users’ understanding of their exposure to online advertising and constitutes an unfair and deceptive trade practice, subject to investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.\" EPIC's complaint also notes that Facebook currently is under a 20-year consent decree from the FTC that requires Facebook to protect user privacy and to comply with the US-EU Safe Harbor guidelines. Facebook has stated that WhatsApp will remain an independent service and \"nothing will change.\" EPIC advised the FTC to investigate this claim as well, to ensure that Facebook is not violating the consent decree. In the past, the Federal Trade Commission has responded favorably to EPIC's complaints. The Commission's November 2011 settlement with Facebook followed from a complaint filed by EPIC and a coalition of privacy and civil liberties groups in December 2009 and a supplemental complaint filed by EPIC in February 2010. EPIC's 2010 complaint over Google Buzz provided the basis for the Commission's investigation of and subsequent settlement with the social networking service. In the Google Buzz case, the Commission found that Google \"used deceptive tactics and violated its own privacy promises to consumers when it launched [Buzz].\" In 2008, EPIC notified the Commission that AskEraser falsely represented that search queries would be deleted when in fact they were retained by the company and made available to law enforcement agencies.

Sunshine Week, which this year spans March 16 to March 22, is a nationwide initiative promoting public awareness of the significance of open government laws and policies. One of the primary legal tools for open government advocates is the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA. EPIC is a frequent FOIA requester, using the law to obtain information about citizens' data privacy from previously secret government documents. EPIC's 2014 FOIA Gallery highlights several of EPIC's FOIA successes from 2013. EPIC’s FOIA work over the past year has resulted in public disclosure of information about several formerly secret government surveillance programs. To obtain these documents, EPIC aggressively deployed the tools provided by the FOIA - detailed requests to agencies, comprehensive administrative appeals, and lawsuits in federal court. Through these cases, EPIC “substantially prevailed” and forced the disclosure of documents from federal agencies including the CIA, FBI, NSA, DHS, Transportation Security Administration, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the US Department of Education. In several of these cases, EPIC has also obtained attorneys fees. EPIC currently has two FOIA cases before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. In November 2013, EPIC won a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security. EPIC requested the document describing the policy that allowed the federal government to shut down cellular service during a peaceful protest. A federal court ruled in EPIC’s favor, finding that the DHS could not properly withhold the information EPIC is seeking. The Department of Homeland Security appealed the decision. EPIC is also pursuing EPIC v. NSA, a case in which EPIC is seeking to obtain “NSPD 54,” which describes the scope of the NSA’s cybersecurity authority. EPIC forced the NSA to disclose some documents related to NSPD 54. However, a federal judge ruled that the Presidential Directive itself is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, which was a surprising decision. The Gallery also contains document PDFs and summaries, including the: * Number of times the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorized the gathering of telephone numbers and \"metadata\" of phone customers and Internet users; * FBI's use of facial recognition technology to compare subjects of criminal investigations and missing persons against millions of drivers' license and identification photos; * DHS's crowd-scanning facial recognition technology, called BOSS; * Bureau of Customs and Border Protection's domestic use of drones capable of intercepting electronic communications; * CIA's collaboration with the New York Police Department in domestic surveillance efforts; * Documents obtained from the US Education Department about the lack of quality control over many private student debt-collection agencies.

California, which concerns warrantless law enforcement cell phone searches. The Court will determine whether such a search violates the Fourth Amendment. EPIC's brief argues that \"modern cell phone technology provides access to an extraordinary amount of personal data,\" and that \"Allowing police officers to search a person's cell phone without a warrant following an arrest would be a substantial infringement on privacy, is unnecessary, and unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\" The brief also describes the vast amount of personal data available both on the phone and from remote servers off the phone, which the phone can access through applications or from the cloud. \"From a cellphone,\" EPIC explains, \"users can even see into their homes and control devices and appliances.\" The brief also stresses that police officers already use low-cost security techniques that can significantly reduce the risk of data loss. Therefore, \"there is no need to allow warrantless searches when currently available techniques allow law enforcement to secure the cell phone data pending a judicial determination of probable cause.\" The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case on April 29. A decision is expected before the end of June. EPIC et al.: \"Friend of the Court\" Brief in Riley v. CA (Mar. 10, 2014) http://epic.org/amicus/cell-phone/riley/EPIC-Amicus-Brief.pdf EPIC: Riley v.

The new law also will change the ways that EU citizens interact with their personal information, including providing better access to their data, restricting the ways that data can be used outside the EU, and fining companies that are in violation. The regulation will be the first update to European privacy legislation since the EU passed the 1995 Data Protection Directive. EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding stated, \"The message the European Parliament is sending is unequivocal: This reform is a necessity, and now it is irreversible.\" In 2012, EPIC Executive Director Marc Rotenberg testified in support of the European data protection initiative before the European Parliament. In 2012 and 2013, EPIC and over 20 other US consumer, privacy, and civil liberties groups sent letters to the European Parliament in support of the reform. The groups wrote that until the US passes comprehensive privacy legislation, \"the European Union offers the best prospect for the protection of Internet users around the globe.\" During the same session, the European Parliament also voted to halt the US-EU Safe Harbor program, which allows US companies to process data on EU citizens outside of European legal protections, and to restrict the flow of European data out of the EU. The Safe Harbor resolution recommends that Europe exclude EU-US data transfers from trade negotiations and establish legal remedies for EU citizens who face privacy violations. Earlier in 2012, EPIC wrote to the Federal Trade Commission to urge the agency to enforce Safe Harbor. EPIC also recommended that the Commission require violating companies to comply with the White House's Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights. Similarly, the European Parliament's resolution would add protections for European whistleblowers and establish an independent EU-based data cloud. The resolution follows a six-month investigation, led by MEP Claude Moraes, on the Electronic Mass Surveillance of EU Citizens. The investigation \"looked into alleged spying by the US and some EU member states, assessed its impact on EU citizens' rights (e.g. data protection, freedom of expression, presumption of innocence and effective remedy), recommended ways to prevent further breaches, explored redress mechanisms and suggested how to improve the IT security of EU institutions.\" European Parliament: Press Release on Data Resolutions (Mar. 12, 2014) http://epic.org/redirect/031714-eu-data-resolutions.html European Commission: Press Release on DP Reforms (Mar. 12, 2014) http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-186_en.htm Consumer Groups: Letter to EU Parliament re: DP (Oct. 17, 2013) http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/ltreudatareg101513.pdf EU: LIBE Committee Vote on Regulation (Oct. 21, 2013) http://epic.org/redirect/103113-eu-libe-vote.html EPIC: Letter to LIBE Committee re: Data Protection (Sept. 5, 2012) http://epic.org/redirect/031714-epic-letter-eu-dp.html EPIC: Testimony of Marc Rotenberg before EU Parliament (Sep. 30, 2013) http://epic.org/redirect/103113-rotenberg-libe.html EU: Inquiry on Mass Surveillance of EU Citizens (Sep. 25, 2013) http://epic.org/redirect/103113-eu-surveillance-inquiry.html EU: NSA Inquiry (Sep. 30, 2013) http://epic.org/redirect/103113-eu-NSA-inquiry.html EU: LIBE Committee http://epic.org/redirect/103113-libe-committee.html EU: 1995 Data Protection Directive http://epic.org/redirect/103113-eu-dp-directive-1995.htmlL The White House: Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights (Feb. 2012) http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/privacy-final.pdf US Department of Commerce: (US-EU Safe Harbor Program) http://export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018365.asp EPIC: EU Data Protection Directive https://www.epic.org/privacy/intl/eu_data_protection_directive.html ======================================================================== [6] News in Brief ======================================================================== EPIC Urges Public Comment on White House 'Big Data' Initiative EPIC is urging public input on the Obama Administration's \"Big Data and the Future of Privacy\" review. In Februrary, EPIC, joined by 24 consumer privacy, public interest, scientific, and educational organizations, petitioned the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to accept public comments, stating, \"The public should be given the opportunity to contribute to the OSTP's review of 'Big Data and the Future of Privacy' since it is their information that is being collected and their privacy and their future that is at stake.\" The letter sets out a list of questions, including \"What potential harms arise from big data collection and how are these risks currently addressed?,\" and \"What technical measures could promote the benefits of big data while minimizing the privacy risks?\". Comments are due no later than March 31, 2014, and can be sent via email to bigdata@ostp.gov.

The previously secret reports, which cover the period 2000-2013, reveal a dramatic increase in the use of these techniques in 2004 and then a significant reduction in 2008, likely the result of a shift to other investigative methods. The documents show that nearly all applications to the Surveillance Court were approved without modifications. In 2013, EPIC petitioned the US Supreme Court to end the bulk telephone record collection program. Former members of the Church Committee and dozens of legal scholars supported the EPIC petition.

Weakens Student Privacy Laws, Then Proposes 'Best Practices' The US Education Department has issued recommendations for schools that transfer student records to online educational service providers. Following the Department's changes to a federal student privacy law, private companies and government agencies have access to student records without obtaining student consent. The Department's recommendations explain that the current regulations do not require written agreements for schools to disclose student information to private companies. The Education Department also recommended that schools establish policies for approving online educational services, create written contracts with private companies for the use of student data, and explain to parents and students how schools collect, use, and disclose student information. The agency warned that student data held by private companies may not be protected under federal privacy laws. In 2012, EPIC sued the Education Department for weakening the privacy rule that prevented companies from getting access to student data. US Ed.

The FAA plans to appeal the decision. In 2012, Congress ordered the FAA to implement a plan to integrate drones into US National Airspace by 2015. Shortly thereafter, EPIC, joined by over 100 other organizations, experts, and members of the public, petitioned the agency to address privacy as a component of the integration. As a result, the FAA published a notice with proposed privacy requirements for drone operators. EPIC submitted comments in response to the notice, urging the agency to mandate minimum privacy standards. After considering numerous public comments on the privacy impact of aerial drones, the FAA proposed a regulation that requires test site operators to develop privacy policies but does not require any specific baseline privacy protections. Several states have passed drone privacy laws, and bills are also pending in Congress. NTSB: Decision in Huerta v.

Several respondents to the Pew survey identified the loss of privacy, and the stratification of privacy rights, as a key concern.

Payton and Theodore Claypoole http://epic.org/redirect/031714-privacy-big-data-payton-claypoole.html \"Privacy in the Age of Big Data\" explores the personal and societal importance of privacy and describes the various technologies that put privacy at risk. Security experts Theresa Payton and Theodore Claypoole demonstrate that, from our mobile devices and TVs to our cars and our bodies, data about us is collected in a near boundless number of ways. The book also provides a number of practical tips for securing and minimizing risks to personal privacy. The first chapter argues why privacy, in general, is so important and suggests that, at the heart of it, privacy is about \"choice\" - our choice to divulge what it is known and unknown about us. It also sets the stage for the current relationship between technology and privacy by describing how technological advancement has lead to both greater data collection and the ability to analyze that data. The authors explain that the amount of privacy protection one is afforded depends on what country we live in but that legal precedent generally has failed to keep pace with technology's ongoing encroachment on privacy. As one would expect about a book on big data and privacy, the Internet plays a central role in Payton and Claypoole's arguments. Several chapters explore various technologies – including cars, TVs, thermostats, and home appliances - that are now Internet-enabled and thus allow greater data collection, on themselves and on us. In other words, greater convenience opens us up to greater snooping by the government, our employer, companies, and crooks. Of course, it's just not the latest Internet-enabled gadgets compromising our privacy; many invasive technologies are watching us as we travel outside our homes. Drones, security cameras, license plate readers, and automatic toll collectors monitor and track our movements. As the authors note, even our bodies betray our movements as improvements in biometrics, particularly facial recognition, make it easier to identify us when we are out in public. \"Privacy in the Age of Big Data,\" however, is far from being a mere laundry list of privacy-compromising technologies. Throughout the book, the authors not only describe technology in an approachable manner but remind us of privacy's fundamental importance. Payton and Claypoole provide useful tips and resources to better protect our privacy and remind their readers that \"trading [privacy] for convenience and cost would be a tragedy.\" Technology- and privacy savvy-readers probably are already familiar with many privacy-compromising technologies and ways to circumvent them. For those looking for an accessible way to better understand \"big data\" collection, its privacy implications, and how to protect themselves against big data intrusion, \"Privacy in the Age of Big Data\" provides the perfect place to start. --Jeramie D.
