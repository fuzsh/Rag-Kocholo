Blind Pig Records today announced it is officially back in business. The label, which began in 1977 in the basement of the Ann Arbor club by the same name, is recognized as one of the world’s premier American blues and roots recording companies. Its rich repertoire includes Muddy Waters, Magic Slim, Luther Allison, Tommy Castro, Deborah Coleman, James Cotton, and Elvin Bishop.

The reboot comes eight years after The Orchard, a leading global music distribution and artist + label services company and member of Sony Music Entertainment, acquired Blind Pig from its original founders, Jerry Del Giudice and Edward Chmelewski. Since then, the label released successful records by Altered Five Blues Band and Mitch Woods, and a 40th Anniversary double compilation album, but mostly remained on hiatus.

The next chapter of Blind Pig will be headed by Jeff Schroedl, a 30-year music industry veteran based in Milwaukee, WI. “We’re thrilled and grateful for The Orchard entrusting us to carry on the great legacy of Blind Pig. We look forward to developing and investing in the next generation of talented and creative artists,” said Schroedl, adding, “The label will embody the same independent spirit as its founders, focusing on exceptional artists and great songs, with a personalized approach.”

Label founders Del Giudice and Chmelewski commented on the relaunch: “We’re proud of the impact Blind Pig Records has made in preserving the music of traditional blues artists as well as in discovering and recording highly gifted musicians who further expanded the definition of American roots music. We’re happy to know that with Jeff’s expertise and commitment Blind Pig’s rich history will continue.”
