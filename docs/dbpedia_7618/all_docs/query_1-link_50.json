I did not know them (please, forgive my ignorance ) and after browsing their catalog I was intrigued by what I saw.\n\nDo you guys know them? How is the quality of their material?\n\nThanks in advance for your comments.\n\nI have several LPs from them from back in the 70s. A fairly good, yet small, blues label."
