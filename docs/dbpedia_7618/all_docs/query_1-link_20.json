        "text": "Blind Pig Records, a legendary American blues and roots recording company, announced its official return to the music scene this week. The label, initially founded in 1977 in the basement of the Ann Arbor club sharing the same name, gained global recognition for its repertoire featuring artists such as Muddy Waters, Magic Slim, Luther Allison, Tommy Castro, Deborah Coleman, James Cotton and Elvin Bishop.\n\nAfter an eight-year hiatus, Blind Pig Records is making a comeback under the leadership of Jeff Schroedl, a 30-year music industry veteran. They are resuming operations with new signings and releases in 2024.\n\nA new artist on their roster is rising star Kevin “Sonny” Gullage. Hailing from New Orleans, Louisiana, Gullage is a soulful singer, dazzling keyboardist, and magnetic frontman who has captured audiences worldwide. Rock & Blues Muse describes him as “a legitimate musical phenomenon with a huge career in front of him.”\n\nGullage’s career took off after performing as a resident artist at B.B. King’s Blues Club in New Orleans, followed by appearances on ABC’s American Idol in 2022. Gullage’s talents extend beyond music, with roles in movies such as The Last Laugh starring Chevy Chase and Burning Cane starring Wendell Pierce.\n\nSchroedl expressed enthusiasm for working with Gullage, stating, “Sonny has it all—he’s a stunning live performer with a huge voice, supreme piano chops, and incredible charisma.”\n\nBorn into a musical family with roots in New Orleans, Gullage is set to release his first record under Blind Pig Records later this year. He expressed excitement and honor in joining the legendary label, foreseeing it as an incredible place for growth."
