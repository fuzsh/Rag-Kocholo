        "text": "Since 1977, Blind Pig Records has been a leading light for the blues in all its many forms. The label, originally formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan and named for that city's Blind Pig Café (welcoming musical artists since 1971), has just celebrated its fortieth anniversary with a new 2-CD, 34-track compendium. Blind Pig Records: 40th Anniversary Collection boasts selections from each decade of the Blind Pig story, featuring many recognizable artists and some lesser-known lights that might just become favorites themselves.\n\nThe tale of Blind Pig Records began when Café owner Jerry Del Giudice and his friend Edward Chmelewski formed their label. The collection begins with \"Gambling Blues,\" a song by Magic Slim (1937-2013) and The Teardrops; the late Slim recorded ten albums for the label from 1990 through 2012. The non-chronological journey through live and studio recordings then encompasses classic songs by Otis Rush (\"Crosscut Saw\"), Elvin Bishop (\"Stomp\"), Charlie Musselwhite (\"Chicago Sunset\"), Pinetop Perkins (\"Just Keep on Drinking\"), and Commander Cody (\"Last Call for Alcohol\") on its first disc.\n\nThe second disc welcomes a similarly impressive roster of blues artists including the legendary Muddy Waters (\"Got My Mojo Working,\" in an archival performance from 1971), Luther Allison (\"Let's Try Again\"), Herbert Sumlin and James Cotton (\"Sittin' on Top of the World\"), Otis Clay (\"When the Gates Swing Open\"), and Taj Mahal, guesting with Big Bill Morganfield (\"You're Gonna Miss Me\").\n\nAll told, thirteen Blues Hall of Fame inductees are featured here. These songs reflect a wide swath of themes from the earthy to the spiritual, whether based on or pushing the boundaries of the 12-bar blues format. You'll hear Americana and folk, boogie-woogie, rhythm-and-blues, soul, and regional flavors from Texas to Louisiana in these tunes.\n\nBlind Pig Records: 40th Anniversary Collection has been produced by Mike Cimicata and Shaun Sintic. Liner notes have been provided by Blues Music Magazine editor Art Tipaldi, bringing Blind Pig's history up to date with its 2015 purchase by The Orchard. The 16-page booklet also includes credits and discography for each song. This sampler of the Blind Pig oeuvre - hip, moving, passionate, and always from the gut - is available now at the links below!\n\nVarious Artists, Blind Pig Records: 40th Anniversary Collection (Blind Pig/The Orchard BPCD 5170, 2017) (Amazon U.S. / Amazon U.K. / Amazon Canada)\n\nCD 1\n\nGambling Blues - Magic Slim & The Teardrops\n\nBoom Town - Victor Wainwright & The WildRoots\n\nNo Doubt - Albert Cummings\n\nHey Joe - Popa Chubby\n\nEverybody's Fishin' - Big Walter Horton\n\nI'm a Woman - Deborah Coleman\n\nDust My Broom - James Cotton\n\nCrosscut Saw (Live) - Otis Rush\n\nStomp (Live) - Elvin Bishop\n\nCharmed and Dangerous - Altered Five Blues Band\n\nLast Chance - Sena Ehrhardt\n\nThought I Had It All - Damon Fowler\n\nOld Friends - Kenny Neal\n\nChicago Sunset - Charlie Musselwhite\n\nCrossover - Eddy Clearwater\n\nJust Keep On Drinking - Pinetop Perkins\n\nLast Call for Alcohol - Commander Cody\n\nCD 2\n\nGot My Mojo Working (Live) - Muddy Waters\n\nYou're Gonna Miss Me - Big Bill Morganfield with Taj Mahal\n\nHuman Cannonball (Live) - Webb Wilder & The Beatnecks\n\nIt's That Time Again - Tommy Castro\n\nIn the Rain - Deanna Bogart\n\nBaby Without You - The Cash Box Kings\n\nLet's Try Again - Luther Allison\n\nDiamond Eyes - Smokin' Joe Kubek and Bnois King\n\nRaising Hell - Zac Harmon\n\nBlue Feelin' - Studebaker John and The Hawks\n\nFrankenbop - Rod Piazza and The Mighty Flyers\n\nChicken Shack Boogie - Mitch Woods and His Rocket 88s\n\nBack Alley Cat - Billy Branch and The Sons of Blues\n\nShut the Front Door - Andy T - Nick Nixon Band\n\nSouthern Livin' - Southern Hospitality\n\nSitting on Top of the World - Herbert Sumlin with James Cotton\n\nWhen the Gates Swing Open - Otis Clay\n\nJoe Marchese\n\nJOE MARCHESE (Editor) joined The Second Disc shortly after its launch in early 2010, and has since penned daily news and reviews about classic music of all genres. In 2015, Joe formed the Second Disc Records label. Celebrating the great songwriters, producers and artists who created the sound of American popular song, Second Disc Records, in conjunction with Real Gone Music, has released newly-curated collections produced by Joe from iconic artists such as Johnny Mathis, Bobby Darin, Laura Nyro, Melissa Manchester, Chet Atkins, and many others. He has contributed liner notes to reissues from a diverse array of artists, among them Nat \"King\" Cole, Paul Williams, Lesley Gore, Dusty Springfield, B.J. Thomas, The 5th Dimension, Burt Bacharach, The Mamas and the Papas, Carpenters, Perry Como, Rod McKuen, Doris Day, Jackie DeShannon, and Andy Williams, and has compiled releases for talents including Robert Goulet and Keith Allison of Paul Revere and the Raiders. Over the past two decades, Joe has also worked in a variety of capacities on and off Broadway as well as at some of the premier theatres in the U.S., including Lincoln Center Theater, George Street Playhouse, Paper Mill Playhouse, Long Wharf Theatre, and the York Theatre Company. He has felt privileged to work on productions alongside artists such as the late Jack Klugman, Eli Wallach, Arthur Laurents, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. In 2009, Joe began contributing theatre and music reviews to the print publication The Sondheim Review, and in 2012, he joined the staff of The Digital Bits as a regular contributor writing about film and television on DVD and Blu-ray. Joe currently resides in the suburbs of New York City."
