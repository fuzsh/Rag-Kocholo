        "text": "American roots music label Blind Pig Records has announced a March 16th release date for new recordings by performing songwriters Peter Karp and Sue Foley and Blues/rock guitarist Popa Chubby.\n\nPeter Karp & Sue Foley’s He Said - She Said is a collection of original songs that grew out of a series of letters between U.S. singer/songwriter Peter Karp and Canadian Juno award winner Sue Foley over a two-year period. The letters started as a casual exchange but as time went on, they became more poignant, more revealing and more intimate. The acclaimed songwriters eventually came to recognize that they provided a wellspring of inspiration for these songs. The compositions reveal a meeting of hearts and minds, an interplay of shared artistic purpose and spiritual kinship. Their live show based on the album, featuring elements of folk, jazz, flamenco, Americana and Blues, was praised by our sister publication Blues Revue as \"a unique, daring idea beautifully executed by two talented, inspired artists unafraid to express themselves in songs of hope, longing, emptiness, love and frustration. A masterpiece.\"\n\nPopa Chubby’s The Fight Is On is the latest release from a prolific artist whose career spana several decades. From the breakout early 90's hit \"Sweet Goddess of Love and Beer\" from the Tom Dowd produced Booty And The Beast to his inspired interpretations of Jimi Hendrix on Electric Chubbyland, Popa continues to output a steady stream of fire and brimstone. On this new release he presents a selection of hard-charging, guitar-driven anthems in tribute to the classic rock he grew up with. From Zep-style arena rock to ZZ Top boogie by way of Buddy Guy and Freddy King, this album is one of his rowdiest yet. The Fight Is On also features a very special live recording of his take on Motorhead's \"Ace of Spades.\" This is Popa's first release in two years, following the success of Deliveries After Dark, and the gloves are off on this one!"
