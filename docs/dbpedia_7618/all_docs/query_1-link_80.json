        "text": "Gonzales native and singer Jovin Webb quickly gained widespread recognition in 2020 for his appearances on ABC's American Idol.\n\nSince then, he’s been a prominent fixture on the blues and soul music scene in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, performing 5-6 shows per week.\n\nHis gritty vocals, dynamic style, and captivating stage presence promise to make him one of the world’s most exciting new blues and roots artists, said officials with Blind Pig Records after signing Webb to a multi-record deal. Recording will start early next year.\n\n“Jovin’s music radiates soulful Louisiana blues, and his combination of passion, talent, and heart is contagious. We’re extremely excited to welcome him to the label and look forward to supporting his growth as an artist, writer, and performer,\" said Jeff Schroedl of Blind Pig Records.\n\nWebb is known for his vocal ability, drumming background, and also plays harmonica, guitar, and piano.\n\n“I’ve waited all my life for this opportunity and am honored to team up with Blind Pig. This is just the beginning and I’m looking forward to many years of creating and sharing music with y’all.,\" said Webb."
