        "text": "For nearly a decade, Debra Regur has been the publicity director for Blind Pig Records. Through her tireless efforts to promote the label’s artists, she has helped many of them significantly advance their careers. Her daily contact with all forms of media has increased their appeal and fan base and also brought them greater recognition and critical accolades beyond just blues outlets. Her efforts have resulted in features and reviews of Blind Pig artists on National Public Radio, in national print and internet publications, on syndicated radio programs, etc. She also provides valuable tour support by advancing touring dates to publicize local shows and appearances. The artists on the label appreciate her dedication and love of the music. One example of the kind of up-and-coming performer who has benefited from Regur’s expertise is John Németh, who says, “Club owners, promoters, and myself know that the seats will be filled because I have the best publicist in the business on the job, Debra from Blind Pig.”"
