        "text": "The Blind Pig opened in 1972. Tom Isaia and Jerry DelGiudice created it as a European-influenced cafe, complete with espresso/cappuccino, a unique and varied food menu, including home made soups, Italian biscotti, crostini, a full wine and beer list, and top-notch Blues entertainment. The partners renovated an old downtown Ann Arbor building and named the fusioned cafe/club after the illegal after-hours gathering place the Detroit Police had raided a few years earlier, touching off the 1967 Detroit riot. DelGiudice started the still-operating Blind Pig Records recording label in 1975 to showcase music by many of the groups who performed regularly at the club.\n\nIsaia and DelGiudice sold the venue in 1979 to Dave Whitmore, who in turn sold to Roy and Betty Goffett three years later. They doubled the club’s space by renovating the rear portion of the building, opening the 8-Ball Saloon on the lower level and moving the stage to the more spacious main floor. The expansion made the venue more conducive to crowd-heavy rock shows, and acts such as Joan Baez, Bo Diddley and George Thorogood.\n\nSince then, the Blind Pig has attracted a steady stream of up-and-coming acts, hosting shows almost every night all year round.\n\nThese days, The Blind Pig continues to provide Ann Arbor with its small, although profound, corner of the music world. Showing an even mix of local talent and the occasional larger act, the Pig is still the hippest place in town and stands as a testament to the area’s rich cultural heritage.\n\nSourced"
