        "text": "Former NFL star Victor Cruz sits down with guests from a variety of industries to chat about how their life experiences have affected their financial journey. In each episode, listeners will learn about the importance of credit to help empower them in their own financial future.\n\nYour credit score is a number that represents a snapshot in time of your credit history, which lenders use to help determine how likely you are to repay a loan in the future. In a typical scoring model, your score generally ranges from a low of 300 to a high of 850. The higher the credit score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. There are different credit scoring models that may be used by lenders and insurers.\n\nCredit Journey uses VantageScore 3.0® by Experian™. Your lenders (including Chase) may not use VantageScore 3.0, so the score they provide you may be different than the one you see in Credit Journey.\n\nWith Chase Credit Journey, you can check your VantageScore 3.0 credit score as often as you’d like with no impact to your credit. You can also receive your credit report directly from the three credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion® and Equifax®) at no cost once a year.\n\nWe recommend checking your score regularly to keep track of your credit activity. With Credit Journey, we’ll let you know details of why your score changed and will send alerts when we spot new activity or changes to your credit report.\n\nThis score improvement resource does not guarantee you will reach your credit score goal even if you complete the recommended actions, as there are other factors that may impact your VantageScore. This resource is for educational purposes only. There are various types of credit scores that lenders can access to make a lending decision. The credit score you receive in this score planner resource is based on the VantageScore® 3.0 model and may not be the credit score model used by your lender or by Chase. You should carefully consider your needs and objectives before making any decisions, and consult the appropriate professionals."
