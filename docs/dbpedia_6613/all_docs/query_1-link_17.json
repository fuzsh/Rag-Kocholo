She encouraged them to move the conversation over to Whatsapp, and they developed a relationship. At some point, Emily began talking about their future together. Emily informed the victim that her aunt worked at a prominent cryptocurrency exchange platform and can help the victim trade crypto. Emily convinced the victim to send $15,000 to a Coinbase wallet, and then create an account on a crypto trading site at www.kucoinpromax.online. Emily further built trust with the victim by sending them $100 to cover their withdrawal fees.\n\nAfter a few trades, Emily instructed the victim to withdraw $500 in earnings, which the victim successfully withdrew. Emily then suggested the victim deposit more money to earn greater profit, so the victim took out a loan for $25,000 and sent it to the site. After a few more weeks of trading, the victim believed they were making profits. But when they tried to withdraw some of their earnings, the site demanded that they pay $54,000 for “taxes” before the funds would be released.\n\nThe victim realized that no matter what trade they made on the site, their account balance always showed a profit. The victim was unable to afford the withdraw fees and has not been able to recover any money from the website. The site is no longer operational.

L.M. even showed the victim how to make a withdrawal and put some of the money back into their bank account.\n\nAfter gaining the consumer’s trust with these transfers, L.M. began pressuring them to invest more money, urging larger deposit amounts. The consumer had to tap into their retirement account and take out personal loans, to get the money L.M. wanted. L.M. led the victim to believe they had made multiple successful trades and showed a substantial profit. But when the consumer tried to make another withdrawal, it was denied. The victim contacted the website’s customer service, who told them they couldn’t make a withdrawal unless they made trades worth five times their initial investment.\n\nEventually, “customer service” stopped responding, L.M. no longer answers the consumer’s messages and the website is no longer active.

Over time, the two developed a relationship and began texting and calling each other regularly. One day, Amberly mentioned she had been working with a crypto analyst for several years and was making crypto asset trades with great success through a crypto trading platform at https://pc.coincap.market/#/home. Amberly demonstrated her trades to the victim and eventually convinced the victim to set up a account on the platform. The victim reports that the website appeared legitimate with features such as customer service chats and accurate market information. The platform featured a tier system whereby users contributed more funds to the platform in order to reach various levels of VIP status.\n\nInitially, the victim made small trades and was able to withdraw money from the platform.

At this point, the platform stopped responding, and in an hour the victim found that their wallet had been hacked.

The victim signed up and deposited funds for the required exchanges. However, the victim was unable to withdraw their money, as the website is no longer operational. The victim transferred $1,100 to the website.\n\nThe Department notes that scammers may impersonate recruiters and offer fake job opportunities with the intent to steal crypto assets and personal information.

Jessica promised to walk them through the trades, step-by-step.\n\nAt first, the victim deposited $1,200, and appeared to make a quick $21,000 profit. But when the victim tried to cash out the profits, the website said they needed to pay a fee based on the profits before they could receive their money. When the victim paid the fees, the website then asked for more fees to access their money. The victim has not received any of the $8,240 they deposited on the site back.

The victim has not been able to withdraw any of the money from their account.\n\nAnother victim reports also losing money to coinbitjzsc.top, after they were convinced to send money to the site by a stranger they met online. The victim spoke with the stranger at length for weeks, eventually discussing future life plans and other intimate topics. At some point, the stranger promised to help the victim retire early through crypto trading.\n\nThe stranger showed the victim how to download a crypto asset wallet app and use that app to transfer funds to https://www.coinbitjzsc.top/#/. At first, the victim transferred small amounts to the site to make small crypto option trades. Then the stranger said that their uncle believed there would be a bull run in the market and persuaded the victim to deposit more money to execute larger trades. When the victim tried to cash out, however, they were told by the website they had to pay a fee of around $107,000 within seven days, or additional daily fees would accrue. Although they believed they had earned over $1.3 million in profit from crypto option trading, to date, the victim has not been able to withdraw their funds.

Wendy demonstrated this to the victim by showing them a trade that made her $10,000 profit in only 30 seconds. Wendy encouraged the victim to download a trading app from the website “phemex.cyou.” Soon after, Wendy directed the victim to “update” the app on another site called “Phemex.icu.” Wendy said that the victim could also learn how to earn astonishing gains from crypto trading using this app.\n\nThe victim followed Wendy’s direction and deposited $52,000 on the app. As Wendy had promised, the victim appeared to earn profits by trading on the app. However, when they tried to cash out, their transfer was declined and they were told their funds would not be released unless they paid $64,000 in “taxes.\" At this point, the victim realized their funds were lost and refused to pay the fee.

However, when the victim attempted to withdraw funds, a representative from the exchange demanded $10,000 before any withdrawals could be made. The victim sent the $10,000 but could still not withdraw the funds. Then, the representative demanded a payment of $12,443.94 for “taxes” before allowing any withdrawals. Again, the victim sent the money, but still couldn't withdraw any funds. Next, the representative accused the victim of illegal money laundering and demanded a further payment of $13,000 via bank transfer.

Kevin gained the victim's trust by correctly predicting some movements in the stock markets. Subsequently, Kevin advised the victim to join him in trading on a crypto asset trading platform called Digicoins, available for download from the Apple App Store. Kevin told the victim that they would receive $200-$800 for signing up. The victim signed up and believed there was a $200 credit in the app. Kevin then advised the victim to subscribe and purchase certain initial coin offerings that he represented as stable and high yielding. He instructed the group to collectively make trades to manipulate the price and thereby make money. During this time, the victim saw on the app the value of their account increase from $200 to $2,000, which prompted the victim to purchase and send more crypto assets to thier Digicoins account. The victim's account continued to grow until one of the coins they were trading crashed, resulting in a significant loss. Kevin notified the victim and the group that someone leaked information from their group, and financial institutions used this information to \"short\" the cryptocurrency. At this point, the victim was able to withdraw cryptocurrency, and did not believe the platform was a scam. The victim continued trading on the platform, believing their account balance was increasing. The victim wired additional funds into their Digicoins account and even took out personal loans.\n\nThe victim also suffered a significant loss related to the cryptocurreny USBL. The listing of a token called USBL was announced on the Digicoins platform to be a highly valued coin with little risk.

Kevin then advised the victim to short sell the coin when it was listed. However, when the victim tried to trade the coin, the Digicoins system froze her out of their account, resulting in a significant loss on their positions. When the victim addressed the issue with Kevin, he told the victim to add more funds to cover their losses. After trying to withdraw their funds one more time and receiving a “maintenance” announcement from the app, the victim checked their crypto wallet on the blockchain and found that her cryptocurrency had been transferred to other crypto wallet.

After a few months of conversation, Francis introduced the victim to the crypto asset exchange, YoBitPro, and told the victim they could increase their Ethereum holdings by as much as 25% by trading on the platform at https://youbitpro.me/#/. At first, the victim made a few trades and saw their balance indeed did increase by at least 25%. Francis encouraged them to invest more funds, so the victim took money from their 401k, borrowed against a credit card and invested an additional $100,000. Following this trade, the victim believed their account to be worth about $400,000. However, when the victim tried to withdraw their funds, they were told that the site was undergoing “ERC 20 network maintenance” and to wait 24 hours.

However, when the victim tried to withdraw their funds, the website indicated that they needed to pay taxes on the money earned to the platform in order to receive their funds. When the victim questioned why they would need to pay taxes to the platform and not the IRS, the company provided a vague answer about being an offshore company and needing to pay off the taxes in order to return the funds back to the victim. Furthermore, the company attempted to steal additional funds from the victim through follow up emails that instructed the victim to send payments to wallet addresses 0x074580e8Ad363e06A904602Fac3b28beC21B2303 and 0x232bf7c4096b3639eb9AFfB5902d9bE72138bC6B.
