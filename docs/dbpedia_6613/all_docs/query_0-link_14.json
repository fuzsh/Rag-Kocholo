        "text": "The technology\n\nThe National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) is a system for scoring the physiological measurements that are routinely recorded at the patient's bedside. Its purpose is to identify acutely ill patients, including those with sepsis, in hospitals in England. The NEWS2 scoring system measures 6 physiological parameters:\n\nA score of 0, 1, 2 or 3 is allocated to each parameter. A higher score means the parameter is further from the normal range. Appropriate clinical responses are given for threshold (trigger) levels, with a recommendation to review and agree these locally:\n\nThe recommendation for a NEWS2 aggregate score of 0 (that is, no change to any parameter) is a minimum 12â€‘hourly review and to continue routine monitoring.\n\nThis briefing focuses on 5 early warning score (EWS) 'track and trigger' systems that can be configured to the NEWS2 specifications. They integrate with electronic health record (EHR) systems to remotely monitor manually entered or automatically captured physiological parameter data directly from bedside patient monitors. They are designed to calculate aggregated scores and automatically generate NEWS2 alerts. This is so that patients in acute and general inpatient wards whose condition is deteriorating are identified and get the appropriate clinical response.\n\nOther, similar technologies may be available but are not included in this briefing (for example, if they were not identified or the company chose not to participate).\n\nThe EWS technologies typically consist of a single or modular licensed software application, which integrates with a hospital's existing IT infrastructure. The EWS technologies interface with the hospital's EHR system via electronic health information standards (for example, Health Level 7 [HL7]) to store, access and monitor patient physiological parameter data. They also include hardware, including servers (for example, for the EWS application and database) and desktop or mobile computers, tablets, smartphones, pagers or digital enhanced cordless technology (DECT) phones. These are normally supplied at additional cost by the local hospital's IT services, which use Local Area Networks (LAN) or Wi-Fi to alert clinical staff to deteriorating patients, based on the calculated NEWS2 scores.\n\nStandalone patient bedside monitoring systems with EWS functionality and standalone online or mobile app EWS calculators are out of the scope of this briefing.\n\nThe EWS technologies identified and their key features are summarised in table 1.\n\nAbbreviations: API, application programming interface; DECT, digital enhanced cordless technology; EHR, electronic health record; EWS, Early Warning Score; HL7, health level 7 standard; SEND, System for Electronic Notification and Documentation."
