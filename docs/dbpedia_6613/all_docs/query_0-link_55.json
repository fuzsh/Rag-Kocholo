        "text": "Transcript.\n\nHi Joanne. So I heard you got a job overseas in China, but I know that you are a little bit concerned because it’s really far from here. And also, you’ll be away from your friends and family a lot. But after thinking about a few things, I would like to give you an advice based on why you should take this opportunity. First of all, it’s a really good paying job. You probably would not be able to get a salary like this here in Canada. So, it would be best if you take this job. Also, since it’s a higher paying job, you would be able to take care of your family more cuz I know that your dad has some health issues and I know that he’s not being able to take care of his self. So because of that, you’d be able to take care of your parents more. Also, I know that your job is providing you one free ticket, it’s a return ticket, back and forth once a year. So, you would always be able to come and visit your family. And when you’re visiting your family, you’d always be able to visit your friends. And I would never mind visiting you in China because I really wanna see that place and I’m pretty sure every once in a while, I’d be able to come and visit you there, too. We can always chat on Skype online, that way you won’t have to feel so lonely. Overall, I think it’s a perfect opportunity—\n\nTranscript.\n\nHi Maddie. I’m just at a furniture fair and I’m looking at this chair and I had to ring you to tell you about it. I know you’re really interested in collecting interesting furniture, and this is very interesting! Let me describe it. So, it’s curved, it’s blue, there’s a light on the top of it which kind of winds around to focus in on where you would be sitting in the center of the chair. It’s also got a curved arm table coming out of it with a cup holder, and we know you like to drink your tea and coffee when you’re reading your book, so that’s important and convenient to have. Also, I should note that on the back of the chair, there’s a switch to control the reading light above your head. So, if you fancied a snooze as you tend to do when you’re reading, you could just turn off the light and drift off. You might want to be careful though because there is no sides to the seat. If you did fall asleep, you would probably fall off the chair.\n\nTranscript.\n\nFirst of all Julie, I would like to congratulate you on this job offer. Um, it’s, you were very lucky to get an offer, so I believe that it’s an, it’s definitely something that you should consider. Um, you have a few things to think about, mainly the region that you’re going to. I mean, Korea, you’ve never been there before, so I would definitely research a little bit on the culture and see if you would be able to assimilate uh quickly. Uh, definitely start looking into their language. Um, I’m sure they would have translators for you, but uh it’s always good to be ready for that. Um, I don’t know if you also know anyone around the area that could help you, somebody that maybe you grew up with or a family member. Um, I would start looking into that as well, if you could get some references in that sense. You know, moving away is not such a big deal with technology and uh things like that. Uh, whether you would be comfortable with, instead of seeing your friends and your family face to face, whether you would be happy with communicating with them through the internet, Skype and Facebook, and things like that as opposed to, you know, meeting them all the time. And whether you would be, you know, willing to spend the money to come back to see them is something that you would have to consider as well. Um, yeah.\n\nTranscript.\n\nHey Maddie, how’s it going? I’m just calling you because I’m down at that furniture fair, you know the one that uh you told me about that you couldn’t make it to, and they have got this interesting blue chair. That’s about the only way I can explain it to you. Um, it’s curved, almost like a backwards C. Uh, it’s got a lamp on the top, it kind of curves and comes around. It’s got a, looks like a screen or a tablet holder and the base of it comes down. It’s got the chair right in front of the screen and then a small mini-table, like an end table. And it’s got a cup holder clip to the little table. And uh I would take a pic and send it to you but I know you don’t have a smart phone. So, I’ll take a pic and email to you. But it is the most interesting chair I have ever seen.\n\nTranscript.\n\nWell I can sure understand that you don’t wanna have the experience to be so far away from your family. I totally see that and I miss my family, too; but you know, it gives you a great opportunity um to learn something that you’ve always wanted to learn. You’ve gone so far already with your business degree. You want to learn a lot more, get into more knowledge, better skills, you want to be there for other people, you wanna explore the world. So, I think this job to go overseas is just a great opportunity for you. You will meet new friends, you will enjoy the land, the country there, the weather is beautiful. Um, and later on, when you come back in two, three years, uh that is just looking great on your resume. So, you’ll have a lot of uh experience and start in a better job here then, because you can say, “Yes, I have already gotten a lot of experience uh in that other country overseas.” Yeah, so I think it would be a great opportunity, but I’m sure gonna miss you and I will try to visit [laughs] cuz I’ve always wanted to go to the country that you’re going to. And I know nowadays a plane is not too far and you can go back and we can see each other and come home for Christmas and stuff. So, I hope you can really take that job and do the best with it.\n\nTranscript.\n\nMaddie, I saw this really cool chair. It’s almost futuristic looking. Um, it’d be a great piece for your office. It looks like a half-moon shape and it’s blue. And it has a seat for where you would sit. And then, on the side is like um an end table with, that’s attached to the main piece of the chair. And it has a clip where you put your drinks in. And there’s also, it looks to be almost like, like a … a desk … shelf type of, type of thing. And it’s just very interesting looking [laughs]. Um, it’s blue and it’s, it sits on the ground, it looks like maybe it’s like about like four feet above the ground. It’s a big chair.\n\nTranscript.\n\nHey Joanne, congratulations on graduating with a business degree and getting a job. I understand the job is an excellent opportunity. Though it is overseas, uh you shouldn’t be worried about moving away from your friends and family. I think this job would be a great fit for your skillset and you’ll be able to grow higher in the organization in a much faster pace. I understand that staying away from your family is causing you a lot of discomfort, but there is always vacation where they could travel to your place or you could travel back home. In a way it’s good because if your parents come to you, you can show them around the new country, they haven’t been there before. I’m thinking, and I believe that this job will be a perfect fit for you and you will be able to grow to great heights through this job. All the things that you have learned during business school will be applicable to this job role. Looking at any of the other job offers that you might get, I’m not sure they would be as good as this and give you the pay and the lifestyle that this job would give you. Moving away from your family for a short time I think is a, is a trade-off that we will have to make for a brighter and better future. So, I would say take the job and go.\n\nTranscript.\n\nHello Maddie, I called you to tell you about this amazing furniture that I just saw at the furniture fair. Oh, I got spellbound to look to the design of this furniture. It .. and I’m sure it’s going to be the best fit for your home office. And it contains a lamp that provides you light for reading purposes. It has a backrest, a good round chair, it even has a small stool on which you can put your snacks, something to eat. And there’s also a glass holder. And it’s amazing blue colour with even the switch for the lamp is given on the backrest. And quite comfortable, and looks the option that you can even turn in in any direction as you want. And yeah, when I saw this, the first thought that came to my mind is about you. I think you should go for it. It’s amazing design, really great, great work of architecture.\n\nTranscript.\n\nI really think that you should take that job offer, um even it’s far away. Um, these will help you to start your um professional development. And also, being far will help you to be stronger. And you will learn from your mistakes and make um better decisions. Um now with the technology, um then we can use the Skype or the FaceTime with our phones, you won’t feel that you are that far away. However, the payment is really good. And you have to start getting more um references for future jobs. And this is the perfect job to start. The payment is good! The company is really well-known company cuz they have a lot of benefits, they have a really good environment. And if you miss the opportunity, later on you will regret it. And then, there’s no time to, to go back. Um, you know you can always be in a new place, uh see the new culture, from city to city. And uh never be scared, I’m pretty sure you will meet new people there that will be there to help you if you have any trouble. Or you can always contact—\n\nTranscript.\n\nHey Maddie, um I found this chair at this uh furniture fair the other day and I thought you might be interested and wanna have a look at it, it might fit actually your, your collection of interesting furniture items. It’s, it’s blue in shape, uh it got lots of curves, has a light on top of it so it’s very good for reading. Uh it has a back stand on it as well, on this side of it there is a coffee stand as well as a little table for, you know, food. So it’s, it’s, it could, basically you could do everything in this uh chair. Food, you could eat, you could drink, you could lay back, you could uh read a book. Um one thing I noticed is the size of it is actually reasonable, it’s not as big as you may think it is. So, yeah I would recommend that you visit uh the store and have a look at this chair. You might like it and add it to your collection—\n\nTranscript.\n\nWell congratulations on getting a new job, I am really excited for you! And I know you are very considerate about moving so far away from your friends and your family. But, if I were you, I would take this opportunity because first of all, it’s a new job, sounds very exciting, and you can earn a lot of money. And if … the best thing is you get to go to a different country within a different city. You’ll meet different people and you’ll meet, you’ll make new friends, and you’ll also get exposed to the different cultures and different foods and beverages. Um, I would definitely take this opportunity even if you feel sometimes you feel lonely and you miss your home and your friends, but even then, this opportunity will help you to be more independent and explore more opportunities that you would have never thought of before. So um I highly suggest that you take this opportunity and work hard and I’m sure you’ll make a lot of new friends. And you will have, you’ll establish yourself really well in the new city [15 seconds left].\n\nTranscript.\n\nHi Maddie. I saw this very interesting looking chair online and I would like to recommend this chair to you. It looks like a swing. It’s [unintelligible] in the shape of a C. It has two places to keep um whatever you wanna put, like a holder, and it has a coffee holder as well. It has a lamp at the top that can help you to read books or focus on whatever task you are doing at night. And at the same time, you can use this as a swing to give your body a relaxed feeling. I think it’s a very fancy looking furniture and it’s gonna attract additional attention to your drawing room. So, I would definitely recommend this piece to you.\n\nTranscript.\n\nOkay my friend, if you have uh a plan to go overseas, and uh work there, so don’t hesitate to grab it because if you like to have a good um a good family or … if you have a, if you like to have a good standard family living, you will uh grab that opportunity for your, for the future of your … families and for the future of your children. Don’t uh, don’t uh … don’t wait this opportunity to uh to go away from you because this opportunity is for your, for the future and the betterment of your family. Because oversea—uh—if you go overseas, you gain more money for your family. And uh make a lot of sacrifices and uh that is for your future family to overcome poverty in life, just like you are here right now. So, grab it, the opportunity for your—\n\nTranscript.\n\nHey Maddie. I found this interesting collection of furniture. This is a chair and designed in blue and the structure is looking so different, like we get to see in the movies. This has a headlight and you have a coffee holder to hold the coffee. And it goes a good back support and adjustable seat, and it is circular, I see a circular cushion seat where you can uh … rest [unintelligible] legs and enjoy music and you can also read books. This structure is, the design is so interesting, like no one ever had, and this is the first time I am seeing this kind of design. The coffee holder stand—\n\nTranscript.\n\nI can say that leaving our family, it’s le … to find our job, it’s very hard. But as I, as we all know that the opportunity knocks just once, so maybe if there’s, there’s uh opportunity that comes in your lap, just grab it regardless that you will leave your family and friends. Oh, we need … especially we are graduated. Don’t uh ignore all the opportunity that it comes in your life. It’s only kno, knocks only once, so, I can say that I would rather to choose to find a job rather to have a … to leave my family away and my friends. Nowadays, there’s lots of communications that we can have. So, we can still have talk to each other, we can still see our friends, especially for the computer system right now. This is the best way that we can have. Our life starts and our futures, and to help our family, too. So, I can say that this is the best chance that we need to—\n\nTranscript.\n\nHey Maddie. I would describe to you something on a chair that I see here. There’s a funny-looking chair here that would suit you in your home office. Uh, it would be relaxing, it’s colored blue with uh just like a see-saw on it. There’s a … a glass holder on it with a round table with a, you can [unintelligible] on it also while there’s a light on top of it. It would fit to you because uh it’s very futuristic design and I know you like uh diff … collects interest … interesting furniture. So, it would be, it would be a good idea if you’re gonna take this. But this blue see-saw uh chair with lights, with uh … with a glass holder and a table, circle round table, also with a circle seat, and there’s also a back, can lie on your back also on this.\n\nTranscript.\n\nHi [unintelligible]. I know uh that we’re [unintelligible] your business degree and [unintelligible] offer a new job oversea. I thought this job is … the best way to [unintelligible] opportunities … is, is not sure about this. So, for me, how about this uh job for your future. I’m [unintelligible] good for you because you will be part of [unintelligible] your friends and uh family. And then uh this job is uh your first job, right? So, I think it’s uh the best way uh you need a friend and your family to advise when you are going in uh this uh job. I thought this job is uh very excellent opportunity for you, but uh I think uh you need uh more support [unintelligible] uh like me … you uh your friend and your family. I may consider uh you make a decision for your uh for, for yourself, but I think uh—\n\nTranscript.\n\nHi Maddie [unintelligible]. I’m just walking in the, I’m doing the shopping in the, in the furniture sh… uh store and just find a very interest things, interesting chair I think you might be interested. Uh, the chair is like uh, if you have been on the airplane, you will know it’s uh totally uh one … like a, like a ball but cut half. And in the middle, there’s chair and there’s a … there’s a support from the back. And uh at the top, there’s a light on that. So, it’s a whole body, it’s not separate with the table.\n\nDear Ms. Sonora,\n\nMy name is Charles Stevens. As a longstanding resident of the neighbourhood, I have had an Annex Library Card for two decades. I truly appreciate the work that you do as the Chief Librarian, in making it such an inclusive environment and fostering the local community.\n\nNow, as a parent of two children (Gary, 6, and Sofia, 4) it is clear to me that the library’s service to the community could be enhanced if opening hours were extended to Sundays and Mondays. As you know, many families have sports activities and shopping scheduled on Saturday mornings. Sunday is the only day on which we could all enjoy the library’s play rooms, youth groups, and creative programs. Monday is the only night on which all member of the Annex Theatrical Troupe can practice in the auditorium.\n\nThese opinions are widely shared: parents at Annex Kindergarten are unanimous in their desire to share a Sunday cappuccino in the downstairs coffee shop, and to rehearse their lines in the auditorium on Mondays.\n\nPlease consider opening the library seven days a week; I hope to raise the issue at your next steering committee meeting.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nCharles Stevens\n\nMail Delivery Survey\n\nThe government wants to either make people pick up their own mail at the post office or have it delivered only twice a week. This will save the government money. The government is asking your opinion of the change.\n\nChoose the option that you prefer. Why do you prefer your choice? Explain the reasons for your choice. Write about 150–200 words.\n\nOption A: I prefer to get my mail at the local post office.\n\nOption B: I prefer to have mail delivered to my home twice a week.\n\nThere are two primary reasons that I prefer to pick up my mail at the local post office: security and availability.\n\nAs a person who regularly sends and receives confidential documents, security is a crucial aspect of my use of Canada Post. The standard mailboxes attached to duplexes in downtown Toronto are insecure. In contrast, the postal storage in Canada Post locations (and pharmacies throughout the city) are protected from casual theft.\n\nThe second primary reason that I prefer to pick up my mail is that, even though receiving the mail would require a short walk, it would remain available daily. In my line of work as a commissioner of oaths, two-day delay in receiving a document can be a serious professional problem. Furthermore, a good walk never did anyone any harm, even, perhaps especially, in the teeth of the February winter.\n\nFinally, I would hope that — should the government institute the new pick-up-your-mail policy — they will also lengthen the hours at Canada Post locations, and broaden the range of pharmacies that can serve as mail handling locations.\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am an avid user of my local public library. I visit the library several times a week, and would like to use it more, but I find the opening hours somewhat restrictive.\n\nI am a single mother currently studying for a Masters at the Open University. As I am undertaking my studies from home, I don’t have access to a university library. Unfortunately I have very poor internet connection where I live and so rely heavily on the public library to conduct online research.\n\nIn addition, my daughter is book fanatic – she simply loves to read. Our favourite thing to do together is to spend time in the library at weekends. However, her swimming lessons have now been scheduled for Saturdays, on the opposite side of town. She does not have time to visit the library on the same day. As the library is closed on Sundays, we have to live without our weekly library visit together.\n\nI feel the library should be open to the public every day of the week. It is an important resource for people looking for work, studying, or for those who simply wish to expand their minds.\n\nB. Smith\n\nMail Delivery Survey\n\nThe government wants to either make people pick up their own mail at the post office or have it delivered only twice a week. This will save the government money. The government is asking your opinion of the change.\n\nChoose the option that you prefer. Why do you prefer your choice? Explain the reasons for your choice. Write about 150–200 words.\n\nOption A: I prefer to get my mail at the local post office.\n\nOption B: I prefer to have mail delivered to my home twice a week.\n\nIt is very important to me to have my mail delivered to my home. I have a very stressful job and often work long hours, well after the post office closing time. As I work such long hours, I tend to purchase most of my groceries and clothing online. Thus, I receive a lot of mail through the post.\n\nThere has been times where I have not been home to sign for a registered mail and have had to pick up a package from the post office. The post office is located down town on a street with very limited parking facilities. I often find myself circling the block several times waiting for a space to open up. On numerous occasions I have been forced to park in a loading zone, which has resulted in a parking fine more than once. Visiting my local post office, is both time consuming and expensive!\n\nI must admit, I am not happy that the government plans to cut back on the postal service. If I must choose, I absolutely prefer to have mail delivered to my home twice a week, as opposed to not at all!\n\nDear Chief Librarian,\n\nI use the local public library several times a week to research material, and access word processing for my studies. Access to the library is integral to my schooling, and as such, flexible opening hours are vital.\n\nI recently started a part-time job which requires me to cover shifts on the weekend, and varying week days. Unfortunately, this restricts my ability to access the library given the current opening hours. I feel that if the hours were extended to be open 7 days a week, it would enhance the experience of many patrons.\n\nFor many people, the library is a place of leisure and recreation; as such, if it were to open on both Saturday’s and Sunday’s, kids and adults alike could enjoy the enriching activities offered at your facility over the entire weekend. 7 day access would make this possible for all persons, regardless of their weekly work/study structure.\n\nThank you for reviewing this request, and I hope you will consider extending opening hours to 7 days a week.\n\nKind regards,\n\nVanessa\n\nMail Delivery Survey\n\nThe government wants to either make people pick up their own mail at the post office or have it delivered only twice a week. This will save the government money. The government is asking your opinion of the change.\n\nChoose the option that you prefer. Why do you prefer your choice? Explain the reasons for your choice. Write about 150–200 words.\n\nOption A: I prefer to get my mail at the local post office.\n\nOption B: I prefer to have mail delivered to my home twice a week.\n\nI would prefer option B be implemented, rather than option A. The convenience of having mail and packages delivered to my home outweighs the option of ready access to the items at my own discretion.\n\nTypically I only check the mail box at my apartment 2-3 times a week, so the delivery restrictions would not affect me greatly. So long as there were assigned delivery days, I would be able to obtain my mail at regular intervals and not waste time checking an empty post box.\n\nIf option A were implemented, the onus to collect the post would be on me. Realistically, there wouldn’t be time to make the trip to the post office more than once or twice a week, which makes option B all the more appealing.\n\nThe time saving method of mail delivery (option B) is a much preferred option. Please c\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is Seth and I am writing to you today regarding the opening hours for the library. I am an English student and my course requires me to read many books throughout the year. As a result, I visit the library several times a week to rent the required books. Books can be very expensive, so the library is a great benefit to me as instead of spending lots of money buying these expensive books I can rent them instead at a much lower cost.\n\nI have recently started a new part-time job. Now, my only days off are Sundays and Tuesdays. The library is closed on Sundays which leaves Tuesday evenings after school as the only time I can visit the library. As the library closes early on Tuesdays, I have to rush down after school. This is very stressful for me and it would be much easier if the Library was open on Sundays as then I would have all day to visit.\n\nI feel that many other people have the same problem and would benefit greatly if the library was open every day. I hope you will consider this.\n\nThanks,\n\nSeth\n\nMail Delivery Survey\n\nThe government wants to either make people pick up their own mail at the post office or have it delivered only twice a week. This will save the government money. The government is asking your opinion of the change.\n\nChoose the option that you prefer. Why do you prefer your choice? Explain the reasons for your choice. Write about 150–200 words.\n\nOption A: I prefer to get my mail at the local post office.\n\nOption B: I prefer to have mail delivered to my home twice a week.\n\nI would prefer to have my mail delivered to my home twice a week as opposed to me collecting it myself at the local post office. The reason I would prefer this is because I have a very busy schedule and having to collect my own mail from the post office would just take up more of my spare time. Also, the closest post office to my house is a twenty minute walk. I do not own a car so I would have to walk this distance in order to collect my mail.\n\nI feel that having my mail delivered to my home twice a week is a more efficient way of delivering mail to homes as it limits the amounts of trips the post office has to take in order to deliver mail. This in turn will save money for the government as instead of spending money on gas and wages for the employees that deliver the mail every day, they will be only spending this money two days per week.\n\nThese are the reason I would prefer to have my mail sent out to my home twice a week.\n\nDear Chief Librarian,\n\nI am writing to you with regards to the operating hours of your library. I would appreciate that the library committee will consider operating on Sundays and Mondays as well.\n\nI am a regular patron of your library. I need to visit the library for my research and self study sessions required for my part time MBA course. Occasionally, I would be required to work late for meetings and overtime, and would not be meet the library operating hours. I could only use the library on Saturday, which is a day I would need to complete other household chores.\n\nBy opening your library daily, it can benefit not just me, but the entire community. Most families will spend their Sundays doing things together. The library can certainly organize story telling sessions or talks/workshops that are family friendly on Sundays. There are also many schools surrounding your library. Your library is an excellent place for highschoolers to hang out after school for self studies or project meetings. Therefore, there is every reason to open on Mondays too!\n\nI hope my suggestions can be considered by the committee. I will look forward to your favourable response soon.\n\nRegards\n\nWendy\n\nMail Delivery Survey\n\nThe government wants to either make people pick up their own mail at the post office or have it delivered only twice a week.

Write about 150–200 words.\n\nOption A: I prefer to get my mail at the local post office.\n\nOption B: I prefer to have mail delivered to my home twice a week.\n\nMy option is to have my mails delivered to my home twice a week. Though it’s only twice a week, but it does not change my daily routine. We do not need to allocate time for post office pick up. Sometimes, both my husband and myself may be too occupied at work, and may miss picking up the mails. I sincerely do not want to miss out important mails for that reason.\n\nBase on our mailing records, we do not receive mails daily. At least for relevant mails. We do have junk mails delivered daily, which is not favoured. We had opted for electronic mails for most of our banking and financial institutions. So we will not be expecting regular mails from them. Government bodies are also starting to mail electronically, which is the our preferred mode of correspondence. Twice a week of mail delivery is about right for our family. In fact, we do not require to clear our mailbox stuffed with junk mails everyday anymore!\n\nRespected Sir,\n\nLibrary is the best source of information and knowledge, easily accessible to public. I visit library 4 to 5 times a week spending a minimum of 2 hours on each visit. I would like to put forth my request request to keep the library open every day of a week, in public interest.\n\nPeople work in different environments with different schedule. For instance, my work shifts enables me to take Sunday/Monday offs whereas, my wife gets Saturday/Sunday offs. These are the days which are most comfortable and convenient us to visit and more time in library reading. But unfortunately, the public library is not open on Sundays and Mondays which keeps most of the public away from library especially on Sunday and for people like me on Monday too.\n\nAs said, library being the source of information for most of the public should be accessible to public every day to ensure we cover interests of interested people\n\nThanks,\n\nXYZ\n\nMail Delivery Survey\n\nThe government wants to either make people pick up their own mail at the post office or have it delivered only twice a week.

We live in a world ruled by electronic mails. Most of the communications from/to people happen via emails including the critical ones, so I believe there is a huge scope for cost savings, if we optimize the mail delivery system properly.\n\nI would prefer the mails to be delivered to my home versus collecting them by myself since I work 7 days a week with shifts placed between 8 AM to 6 PM. This schedule does not permit me to collect the mails at the local post office with the commuting time accounted. Any material delivery can be easily handed over to my wife or mother at home and mails can be dropped into my personal mailbox installed at the door.\n\nTo conclude, I believe delivering mail twice a week would keep both government and public in a win-win situation saving significant money without causing inconvenience to the public. Mails still act as an important communication way\n\nDate: 13 june 2016\n\nTo: Chief Librarian\n\nTopic: Importance of Library\n\nI believe that library is very important in our society. Library is where we find all the information that want to see. It is important to everyone specially for the student to give an extra ideas and searching and learning from their assignments. Even for ordinary people is very useful and helpful. Sometime people will came to library to read books during their spare times and they feel good after they read their favourite books.\n\nThe library is closed every Sunday and Monday and it will not work for me. I am a full time employee and work in weekdays. And Sundays is just my spare time to visit library.\n\nI hope that you will find a solution for the schedule of the opening Hours of the library special during\n\nMail Delivery Survey\n\nThe government wants to either make people pick up their own mail at the post office or have it delivered only twice a week.

It is also useful to me to come in the post office to pick my mail. Through this I am giving a small amount of contribution to the government. And by doing so, I believe that that government will do something in return in the society for the save money.\n\nIt also give benefit to me to get may mail in the post office to keep me updated on my daily routine.\n\nAnd it also an extra time for me to walk and it will be good exercise to me. In this opinion it will help a lot to keep me updated to my mail and also to may bill payment.\n\nDear chief librarian,\n\nThe reason for I’m write this email is because I think that the library is very important for all people, it is a place where people can be study, learn and relax. I think is one of the most important place into a community and the education.\n\nI need explain that I work every day long, and every week long too, and I don’t have much time en weekdays for go to the library, just I have some free time on weekends, and is the only place where actually I can relax and enjoy reading a interesting book or something especial.\n\nI suggest and ask you, if it is possible keep open the library on weekends also. I’m sure people could be use more frecuently, and perhaps, can be use for more younger people as a place for to make homework, also on weekends.\n\nRegards.\n\nMail Delivery Survey\n\nThe government wants to either make people pick up their own mail at the post office or have it delivered only twice a week.

In general, I don’t have more time for pick it up, and I suppose that people do it the same way.\n\nI think it’s not many people need for mail every day, obviously should be exceptions, but if with this action we can save money as a country, I think is a good decision, because is not a big change in your life, and we will necessary be adapt our habits, just a minimum change for maybe better quality in health, educaction, etc,\n\nI think many people support that choice and I hope will be a good choice\n\nHi,my name is Gareth!\n\nI will try to tell you about my problem.
