The Z-Score function, in turn, is a table calculation function because it includes STDEVPÂ Sales in its definition. When you use a calculated field that includes a table calculation function in a view, it's the same as adding a table calculation to a field manually. You can edit the field as a table calculation. In fact, that's what you do next."
