        "text": "How to get HealthMeasures scores on their proper metric\n\nYou can get a HealthMeasures score in four ways:\n\nUse an administration platform that automatically calculates scores\n\nUse the FREE HealthMeasures Scoring Service\n\nUse the Assessment Center API (requires license)\n\nScore by hand using a Scoring Manual for self-report and proxy-report short forms\n\nTIP: It is preferable to use 1) an administration platform that automatically calculates scores, 2) the HealthMeasures Scoring Service, or 3) the Assessment Center API. These use the most accurate scoring method as each response to every item is used to calculate a person’s score. Scoring Manuals are a good second option for self- and proxy-report measures. They convert the raw sum on a measure to a final T-score.\n\nThe HealthMeasures Scoring Service\n\nThe HealthMeasures Scoring Service is a free, web-based application that scores an Excel file of raw participant responses and returns by email a file with calculated T-scores for all measures.\n\nWatch a brief demonstration of the HealthMeasures Scoring Service.\n\nThe HealthMeasures Scoring Service is especially useful when:\n\nYou administered a short form, but not all participants answered every question\n\nDifferent groups of participants responded to different items\n\nYou have administered a new custom short form using a subset of items from one of the HealthMeasures (e.g., PROMIS®) item banks\n\nHow to use the HealthMeasures Scoring Service\n\nDownload the Input Template.\n\nAdd your data (all respondents’ individual answers to questions) for one HealthMeasure to the template (multiple timepoints are okay).\n\nDetermine how much data is missing. In order to produce a precise score, a respondent must answer at least 4 items in measures that include 4 or more items. If a precise score is required, remove respondents who answered less than 4 items from the input template and do not calculate a T-score.\n\nUpload your spreadsheet to the HealthMeasures Scoring Service (if this is your first time, register as a new user).\n\nAccess your email to receive a spreadsheet with calculated scores.\n\nVideo Tutorials:\n\nHealthMeasures Scoring Service tutorial\n\nTutorial to score:\n\nPROMIS Profiles\n\nPROMIS Global\n\nPROMIS Psychosocial Illness Impact\n\nThe Assessment Center API\n\nThe Assessment Center API is a licensed web service that scores raw participant responses to produce T-scores. It also uses the most accurate scoring method (i.e., response-pattern scoring). It is installed on your desired server.\n\nIt is especially useful when:\n\nYou want your data to remain behind your firewall\n\nYou administered a short form, but not all participants answered every question\n\nDifferent groups of participants responded to different items\n\nYou have administered a new custom short form using a subset of items from one of the HealthMeasures (e.g., PROMIS) item banks\n\nHow it works:\n\nThe API can be hosted on a statistician’s computer and called as a web service from the desired statistical package for scoring.\n\nSAS has Proc SOAP to allow the calling of a web service, which can also be hosted within the SAS environment.\n\nR can use the httr library to call a web service. SPSS Modeler can call a web service via CLEF.\n\nSTATA and other software packages have similar capabilities.\n\nAdministration Platforms that Calculate Scores\n\nMultiple administration platforms (e.g., REDCap, Epic) include HealthMeasures and automatically calculate scores.\n\nTIP: Select measures labeled with “auto scored” in REDCap.\n\nScoring Translations\n\nTranslations of self- and proxy-report HealthMeasures use the same scoring as the English measures. Follow the same instructions for scoring using the HealthMeasures Scoring Service, an administration platform that autoscores (e.g., NIH Toolbox app in Spanish), or score by hand using the Scoring Manual.\n\nScore Precision\n\nSignificant Figures\n\nT-scores and associated Standard Errors (SE) should be reported as integers. Additional decimal places may be retained in interim computations but the reported value should be rounded to an integer to maintain the appropriate level of significant figures.\n\nHandling Missing Data\n\nResponse pattern scoring, available in the HealthMeasures Scoring Service and automatically computed in many digital administration platforms can produce a T-score for a respondent as long as 1 item has been answered. However, for short forms with at least 4 items, a T-score may not be sufficiently precise if a respondent has answered fewer than 4 items. Depending on how the score will be used, you may want to discard the score or proceed with caution. For short forms with 1-3 items, all items should be answered to produce a sufficiently precise score.\n\nUsing a raw summed score to T-score conversion table to compute T-scores by hand requires that all items are answered in order to produce a valid score.\n\nCalculate a Confidence Interval\n\nUse the T-score and Standard Error (SE) to calculate a confidence interval. A 95% confidence interval is common. A 95% confidence interval means there is a 95% probability that the true T-score is within this range. The formula for a 95% confidence interval is:\n\nT-score + (1.96*SE)\n\nFor example, if T=52 and SE=2, the lower boundary of the confidence interval is (52 – (1.96*2) = 48 and the upper bound is (52 + (1.96*2) = 56."
