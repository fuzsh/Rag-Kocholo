For a more accurate score, you may be able to request your insurance score from your insurance company or LexisNexis.\n\nYou may be able to improve your insurance score by paying bills on time and keeping your credit utilization ratio low.\n\nThere are many factors that go into determining your insurance rates — from where you live to the type of car you drive. One crucial component is your insurance credit score, which is used in many states to help determine your premiums. This metric is influenced by your credit history and other financial behaviors, providing insurers with a snapshot of your risk level. Bankrate can help you get under the hood and into the intricacies of what an insurance score entails, how it is calculated and why it plays an important role in determining the cost and availability of your insurance coverage.\n\nWhat is an insurance score?\n\nAccording to the Insurance Information Institute, insurance scores are confidential ratings calculated by insurance companies primarily by using data from your credit history. This score is used to help determine the likelihood that you will make an insurance claim in the future for both home and auto coverage in states where it is allowed.\n\nStatistically speaking, those with higher credit scores are less likely to file a claim with their insurance company. As such, insurance companies use information from major credit rating bureaus to create their own rating system, akin to a credit score for insurance. Drivers and homeowners with higher credit-based insurance scores typically have higher rates.\n\nInfo\n\nNot all states allow the use of insurance scores as a factor for determining insurance rates.\n\nThe states that prohibit or restrict credit from being used as a car insurance rating factor are California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.\n\nThe states that prohibit credit from being used for homeowners insurance rates are California, Massachusetts and Maryland.\n\nWhy is an insurance score important?\n\nInsurance scores play a significant role in calculating the cost of your insurance premiums, according to the Insurance Information Institute (Triple-I). Insurance companies assess how much risk they incur to provide coverage to a customer. This expected cost, among other factors, is used to determine how much the company should charge a customer in premiums to avoid losing money.\n\nInfo\n\nInsurance and credit score data\n\nThe average credit score is 716. (Average credit scores by state)\n\n49% of credit cardholders carry debt from month to month. (Bankrate Credit Card Debt Survey)\n\nThe baby boomer generation pays the least for auto insurance and they are also the least likely to have credit card debt with 44% carrying a balance month-to-month. (Bankrate auto insurance rates by age and Bankrate Credit Card Debt Survey)\n\nHow is an insurance score calculated?\n\nInsurers use several factors to determine your insurance score. Many of these factors overlap with factors used to determine your credit score. Although some states require insurance companies to make their insurance scoring methods public, not all do. Some key factors that may influence your insurance score are your previous credit performance, outstanding debt, credit history length and pursuit of new credit. Exact factors that impact insurance scores will depend on your carrier’s underwriting policies, the state you live in and any third-party companies the insurer works with to source credit information.\n\nWhat is a good insurance score?\n\nLike credit scores, insurance scores improve as they increase. According to LexisNexis, a risk-focused data analytics company, insurance scores range from 200 to 997 in its scoring metric. Scores higher than 775 are considered good.\n\nInsurance score chart\n\nScore range Rating 776 – 977 Good 626 – 775 Average 501 – 625 Below average 200 – 500 Poor\n\nHow to improve your insurance score\n\nThankfully, there are many ways to potentially improve your insurance score. For the most part, strategies and techniques for improving credit scores will also increase your credit-based insurance score. The primary approach is to treat your credit and bills with as much financial responsibility as you can.\n\nHere are some strategies that might help improve your credit-based insurance score:\n\nPay bills on time: Avoid late payments and missed payments. If you can afford to pay the full amount you owe each month, rather than just the minimum payment, it can also help keep your credit utilization ratio low.\n\nKeep credit utilization low: Credit utilization refers to the amount of your available credit you use. A good benchmark figure is to keep this number below 30 percent of all your available credit.\n\nPay down debt quickly: If you have credit card debt, a car loan or other outstanding debt, you may want to make it a priority to pay it down as quickly as possible.\n\nTo see your credit score and track when and how much it is improving, you can go to www.annualcreditreport.com for free copies of your credit reports. When you use this link, you will be given copies of your credit report from each of the three primary credit bureaus. If your credit score is improving, it’s likely your insurance score is as well. Because of the pandemic, you are allowed to access your credit reports weekly through this site instead of annually, as had been the process previously. This will remain in effect through December 2023.\n\nLightbulb\n\nShopping around may help you find the best rates, even if your credit history is less than perfect.\n\nMaking on-time payments with your existing credit obligations may help improve your credit score and, in turn, your insurance score.\n\nReview any available discounts your insurer offers to make sure that you are taking advantage of any for which you are eligible.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nIn most states, insurance scores are used to determine your auto and home premiums. However, some states have laws limiting whether credit history can be used to calculate premiums. Hawaii and Michigan prohibit the use of credit history in auto insurance rating, while Maryland prohibits its use in home insurance rating. California and Massachusetts prohibit the use of credit history in both auto and home insurance ratings.\n\nAnything that affects your credit score will likely affect your insurance score, too. Having outstanding debt, making late payments, using too much credit and having many credit lines can all negatively affect your insurance score.\n\nYour insurance score is calculated using factors of your credit history to determine how likely you may be to file a claim. Your credit score is calculated using many of the same factors, but it’s used to determine how likely you are to go delinquent on a debt. Each uses overlapping variables, but the formula, outcome and purpose are all different. Please note that all insurers engage proprietary underwriting guidelines, so how they use insurance scores to determine your rate can vary.\n\nTypically, your insurance score is the same whether the product is home or auto insurance. However, this can vary depending on your insurer’s underwriting process and whether the same company provides your home and auto insurance. It can also depend on what state you reside in and if there are regulations prohibiting credit usage as a rating factor."
