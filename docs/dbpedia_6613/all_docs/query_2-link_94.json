        "text": "Customer Effort Score was developed in 2010 by the Corporate Executive Board (CEB Global, now Gartner) when their research showed that “effort” is a key driver of customer loyalty. In fact, research in The Effortless Experience found that “96% of customers with a high-effort service interaction become more disloyal compared to just 9% who have a low-effort experience.”\n\nA high-effort service interaction is one that requires the customer to jump through hoops to reach a resolution. Some examples would be if your customer needs to be transferred to multiple departments to get an answer, if they need to reach out to you repeatedly, or if they need to switch from email to phone and finally to social media before getting a solution.\n\nThe cost of a frustrating customer support experience is high. Not only do you lose a repeat customer, but you may also end up with negative reviews all over the web. Customer Effort Score surveys identify issues early for proactive reputation management.\n\nCES surfaces the hiccups that could lead to a support ticket, reducing the load on the customer support team. The surveys also reveal where better training and process improvements can speed up resolution, minimizing costly repeat interactions.\n\nCustomers would rather solve problems themselves than take the extra step of reaching out to you. Help customers help themselves by using CES to evaluate self-service features during purchase, onboarding, and troubleshooting.\n\nIf completing an online purchase requires a lot of effort, customers are perfectly positioned to start a new web search and buy from a competitor instead. Use CES surveys to ensure customers don’t fall through the cracks in your user experience.\n\nBenchmarking your CES\n\nTo understand whether you’re decreasing customer effort, you first need to measure it. The CES survey question, “[Company] made it easy for me to handle my issue,” with a disagree-agree Likert scale from 1-7, provides a Customer Effort Score benchmark that you can track over time.\n\nCES survey examples\n\nCommonly used to gain real-time feedback on customer service solutions, CES can also evaluate any interaction where friction may lead to a negative experience. Popular times to use CES also include after a customer purchases a product or service and throughout the onboarding experience.\n\nCES question best practices\n\nThough “effort” is in the name of the score, it isn’t actually the best way to phrase the question. “Effort” doesn’t translate well for international surveys and can be misinterpreted. Instead, a universally understood word like “easy” is ideal. Delighted has CES question templates in 30+ languages for global businesses.\n\nOpen-ended feedback\n\nAllow the customer to explain where the struggle was, as opposed to giving them a list of options to choose from. The open comment form is the most powerful part of the CES survey template, since it surfaces areas you may not have considered, and tells you where to focus.\n\nOptional follow-up questions\n\nBrief is best when it comes to CES surveys. However, optional additional questions around common factors that impact the service experience, such as how knowledgeable the representative was, can be illuminating. Add up to 10 follow-up questions with Delighted, so you can still keep your survey short while getting deeper insights.\n\nTrigger CES surveys upon immediate completion of a transaction or after customers interact with your service team. Recency is key to increasing response rates for these one-off surveys. Customer feedback tools automate the process using REST APIs.\n\nCES surveys should be delivered wherever the interaction takes place, whether that’s in your web app, an email survey, or over chat. For brick-and-mortar transactions, setting up a kiosk is an easy way to get feedback on the level of effort in store.\n\nFor customer service, contextualize the feedback by the service representative, feature in question, interaction channel (self-service, chat, in-person, email, etc.), location, and any other variable that impacted the customer experience. Filter your ratings and open-ended feedback by these segments, and then pivot against your internal processes to pinpoint improvement areas.\n\nManually parsing through thousands of pieces of feedback is a daunting task. A customer experience management software scales with your CX program as the total number of survey responses increases. Set filters with meaningful keywords, or use more advanced feedback analysis tools that automatically surface keyword trends in the open-ended feedback to help with insight discovery.\n\nClosing the loop entails thanking the customers who provided feedback to let them know they have been heard, and also proactively resolving any issues surfaced in the open-ended feedback. You can set up your survey flow to respond to the customer with an apology for a poor experience, or let customers know someone will be following up with them if they give you a low rating.\n\nRoute feedback directly to the team responsible so they can see what customers think in real time. Integrate feedback into your help desk, customer relationship management (CRM) platform, or internal chat tool, like Slack. You can also set up alerts that send feedback directly to your support team based on the rating, comment, or other customer data point (product purchased, plan size, etc.).\n\nIt was easy for me to set up the platform.\n\nScored 5\n\n“Great self-service during the ramp-up period, able to quickly get answers to questions as they arose.”\n\nIt was easy for me to fix my support issue.\n\nScored 3\n\n“Got the feature working with Sam’s help. The article from the chatbot was a waste of time.”\n\nIt was easy for me to make an online purchase.\n\nScored 1\n\n“Got the feature working with Sam’s help. The article from the chatbot was a waste of time.”"
