Just answer a few questions.\n\nThis estimator is only for non-Equity/amateur productions. Equity/professional customers should contact the Licensing department directly at [email protected].\n\nImportant:\n\nThe cost quoted is an estimate only and may differ when you apply for a license.\n\nAUTHORS’ NOTE: Our original production featured seven actors playing an entire Greek pantheon of characters; the Broadway doubling was based on stage time and vocal requirements. For productions where cast size isn’t a concern, we encourage you to cast as many actors as you wish, and experiment with doubling based on your own needs.\n\nWe also encourage you to look beyond traditional casting “types” when it comes to the characters’ race, gender and physical ability. Above all, the characters in The Lightning Thief are gods and heroes – and gods and heroes can look like any of us. When non-binary or opposite-gender persons are cast, we encourage you to use whichever pronouns they feel most comfortable with, and to change the script pronouns accordingly.\n\nAct I\n\n1. “Prologue/The Day I Got Expelled” – Percy Jackson and Company\n\n2. “Strong” – Sally and Percy Jackson\n\n3. “The Minotaur/The Weirdest Dream” – Percy Jackson and Company\n\n4. “Another Terrible Day” – Mr. D\n\n4a.
