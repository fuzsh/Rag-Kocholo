        "text": "Credit Karma is a personal finance company that offers consumers free access to credit scores, credit and identity monitoring, a credit report dispute tool, and customized recommendations for credit card, loan, and insurance products.\n\nThe company makes money by earning a commission when a consumer completes the purchase of a product that it recommends.\n\nCredit Karma uses AI to power a platform that provides tools that consumers can use to manage all aspects of their financial lives. In addition to the services mentioned above, it offers:\n\nFree tax preparation assistance\n\nHigh-yield savings accounts through a partnership with MVB Bank\n\nGuidance for the steps consumers should take after accessing their credit information, including tailored personal, home, and auto loans based on income and credit scores\n\nThe company recommends credit cards and other financial products that fit consumers, based on the odds of approval and their credit scores.\n\nCredit Karma's Industry\n\nCredit Karma's parent, Intuit, operates in the Software-Application industry within the Technology sector.\n\nCredit Karma became part of the global financial technology platform of Intuit in 2020.\n\nCredit Karma's mission is to put the power of technology, data, and AI to work to make personal financial management easier and stress-free. With so many financial services companies vying for the attention of consumers, its strength lies in making custom recommendations for financial products based on someone's finances and credit standing.\n\nCredit Karma's competitors include NerdWallet and Credit Sesame, both of which also offer free credit score information and financial tools. In addition, Intuit states that its business segments, including Credit Karma, face intense competition from:\n\nBusiness software providers\n\nPrivate and publicly-funded tax preparation and filing service providers\n\nAccounting, consulting, and tax firms\n\nSoftware companies and banks that provide payments services\n\nSoftware companies that provide personal finance management products and tools\n\nCompanies that offer consumer financial offerings\n\nFinancial institutions\n\nCredit bureaus\n\nLarge platform companies with competing technology solutions\n\nCredit Karma's Financials\n\nCredit Karma is one of four segments of the financial services company, Intuit. Its revenue comes primarily from cost-per-action transactions. These result in e.g., credit card issuances and personal loans. It also earns revenue from online advertising that generates leads relating primarily to mortgage and insurance. Credit Karma Money also generates revenue for the segment.\n\nIntuit's 2023 annual report reported the segment's financial results for the 2023 fiscal year (FY). Additionally, on May 23, 2024, the company announced financial results for the quarter ended April 30, 2024.\n\nNet Revenue\n\nFor FY 2023, revenue was $1.63 billion, a decrease of 9% from the previous year's $1.8 billion. For the third quarter of FY 2024, revenue was $443 million, an increase of 8% over the previous year's third quarter.\n\nCredit Karma accounted for 11% of Intuit's total revenue in FY 2023 and 7% of total revenue in Q3 2024.\n\nOperating Income\n\nFor FY 2023, operating income was $428 million, a decrease of 19% from the previous year's $531 million. For the third quarter of FY 2024, operating income was $110 million, a decrease of 1% from the previous year's third quarter.\n\nHistory and Leadership\n\nCredit Karma was founded in 2007 by Kenneth Lin, Ryan Graciano, and Nichole Mustard. It is headquartered in Oakland, Calif.\n\nCEO Kenneth Lin spent the early part of his career at E-Loan, an online lender specializing in debt consolidation, and UPromise, a subsidiary of student loan service Sallie Mae which runs a customer loyalty program focused on saving for college and paying down student loans.\n\nCo-founder Ryan Graciano is the company's chief technology officer (CTO). He is responsible for the company's engineers who oversee the creation of new products.\n\nCo-founder Nichole Mustard left Credit Karma in 2023.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn December 2023, Credit Karma launched a new feature that would provide members with up to five days earlier access to government funds than is usual through financial institutions. Members can tap into their Social Security benefits, Veteran's Administration benefits, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) by enrolling in Credit Karma's early direct deposit program.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCredit Karma is a personal finance company that is owned by Intuit. It provides free access to credit scores and other credit services as well as personalized recommendations for credit cards, loans, and insurance.\n\nIt makes the majority of its money when people click through its site and complete transactions for financial products offered by other providers."
