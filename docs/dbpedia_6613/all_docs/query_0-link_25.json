        "text": "Side crash rating results can be compared across all classes because all vehicles are hit with the same force by the same moving barrier or pole.\n\nRollover ratings can also be compared across all classes.\n\nFrontal crash rating results can only be compared to other vehicles in the same class and whose weight is plus or minus 250 pounds of the vehicle being rated. This is because a frontal crash rating into a fixed barrier represents a crash between two vehicles of the same weight.\n\nFor the frontal crash tests, crash dummies representing an average-size adult male and a small-size adult female are placed in the driver and front passenger seats, respectively, and are secured with the vehicle's seat belts. Vehicles are crashed into a fixed barrier at 35 miles per hour (mph), which is equivalent to a head-on collision between two similar vehicles each moving at 35 mph. Since the rating reflects a crash between two similar vehicles, make sure you compare vehicles from the same weight class, plus or minus 250 pounds, when looking at frontal crash star ratings and Overall Vehicle Scores.\n\nInstruments measure the force of impact to each dummy's head, neck, chest, pelvis, legs, and feet. Frontal star ratings indicate the chance of a serious head, neck, chest, and leg injury to the driver and right front seat passenger in a frontal crash. A serious injury is one requiring hospitalization. Star ratings for the driver and passenger in a frontal crash test are assigned as follows:\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐= less than 10% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐= 10% to 15% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐⭐⭐= 15% to 20% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐⭐= 20% to 40% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐= greater than 40% chance of serious injury\n\nThe overall frontal star rating is assigned according to the chart below:\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐= Frontal crash injury risk in this vehicle is much less than average\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐= Frontal crash injury risk in this vehicle is less than average to average\n\n⭐⭐⭐= Frontal crash injury risk in this vehicle is average to greater than average\n\n⭐⭐= Frontal crash injury risk in this vehicle is greater than average\n\n⭐= Frontal crash injury risk in this vehicle is much greater than average\n\nFor the side barrier crash tests, crash dummies representing an average-size adult male and a small-size adult female are placed in the driver and rear passenger seats (driver's side), respectively, and are secured with the vehicle's seat belts. The side crash rating represents an intersection-type collision with a 3,000-pound barrier moving at 38.5 mph into a standing vehicle. The moving barrier is covered with material that has \"give\" to replicate the front of a vehicle. Since all rated vehicles are impacted by the same size barrier, it is possible to compare all vehicles with each other when looking at side barrier crash protection ratings.\n\nInstruments measure the force of impact to each dummy's head, neck, chest, lower spine, abdomen, and pelvis. Side barrier star ratings indicate the chance of a serious head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis injury for the driver and front seat passenger (outboard first row occupants), and the chance of serious head and pelvis injury for the rear seat passengers (outboard second row occupants). A serious injury is one requiring hospitalization. It may result in a permanent disability or in some cases be life-threatening.\n\nLower spine injury, although measured, is not currently included in the star rating. Excessive lower spine injury readings (lower spine reading greater than 82 Gs) are reported separately. For the front seat occupants, they are reported as a footnote on NHTSA.gov, and for the rear passenger occupants, they are reported separately as a safety concern. Star ratings for front and rear seat occupants in the side barrier crash test are assigned as follows:\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐= less than 10% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐= 10% to 15% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐⭐⭐= 15% to 20% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐⭐= 20% to 40% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐= greater than 40% chance of serious injury\n\nThe overall side barrier star rating is assigned according to the chart below:\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐= Side barrier crash injury risk for this vehicle is much less than average\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐= Side barrier crash injury risk for this vehicle is less than average to average\n\n⭐⭐⭐= Side barrier crash injury risk for this vehicle is average to greater than average\n\n⭐⭐= Side barrier crash injury risk for this vehicle is greater than average\n\n⭐= Side barrier crash injury risk for this vehicle is much greater than average\n\nFor the side pole crash test, a crash-rating dummy representing a small-sized adult female is placed in the driver’s seat and is secured with the vehicle's seat belt. During a side pole crash test, a vehicle strikes a 25 cm diameter pole at a 75-degree angle at 20 mph. The pole mimics narrow fixed objects like utility poles and trees that are often involved in side crashes. Since all rated vehicles impact the same size pole, it is possible to compare all vehicles with each other when looking at side pole crash protection ratings.\n\nInstruments measure the force of impact to the dummy's head, neck, chest, lower spine, abdomen, and pelvis. Side pole star rating indicates the chance of serious head and pelvis injury for the driver (outboard first row occupants). A serious injury is one requiring hospitalization. It may result in a permanent disability or in some cases be life-threatening.\n\nLower spine injury, although measured, is not currently included in the star rating. Excessive lower spine injury readings (lower spine reading greater than 82 Gs) are reported separately as a safety concern.\n\nStar ratings for front seat occupants in the side pole test are assigned as follows:\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐= less than 10% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐= 10% to 15% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐⭐⭐= 15% to 20% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐⭐= 20% to 40% chance of serious injury\n\n⭐= greater than 40% chance of serious injury\n\nSince there is only one dummy in the pole test, the overall pole test rating is equal to the star rating for the front seat occupant.\n\nThe overall side crash star rating is assigned according to the chart below:\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐= Side crash injury risk for this vehicle is much less than average\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐= Side crash injury risk for this vehicle is less than average to average\n\n⭐⭐⭐= Side crash injury risk for this vehicle is average to greater than average\n\n⭐⭐= Side crash injury risk for this vehicle is greater than average\n\n⭐= Side crash injury risk for this vehicle is much greater than average\n\nThe Overall Vehicle Score, also expressed as a star rating, is calculated using the probabilities of injury that are used in determining frontal and side ratings, and a projected probability of injury based on rollover resistance ratings. Values used in the calculation are weighted to reflect the proportion of real-world injuries associated with each type of crash. The result is then compared to the average risk of injury across the vehicle fleet to see whether the average risk of injury for a given vehicle is higher or lower than the average. Overall Vehicle Scores are assigned as follows:\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐= Overall injury risk for this vehicle is much less than average\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐= Overall injury risk for this vehicle is less than average to average\n\n⭐⭐⭐= Overall injury risk for this vehicle is average to greater than average\n\n⭐⭐= Overall injury risk for this vehicle is greater than average\n\n⭐= Overall injury risk for this vehicle is much greater than average\n\nBecause a vehicle’s Overall Vehicle Score is based in part on the vehicle’s frontal crash test rating, Overall Vehicle Scores also can only be compared to other vehicles in the same class and whose weight is plus or minus 250 pounds of the vehicle being rated. Examples include:\n\nIt would not be permissible to compare the frontal and/or Overall Vehicle Scores of a 4,500 pound SUV with those of a 3,000 pound sedan (different classes and exceeds the weight requirement).\n\nIt would not be permissible to compare the frontal and/or Overall Vehicle Scores of a 3,600 pound pickup with those of a 3,400 pound van (meets the weight requirement, but different classes).\n\nIt would be correct to compare the frontal and/or Overall Vehicle Scores of a 3,400 pound passenger car with a 3,650 pound passenger car (same class and meets the weight requirement)."
