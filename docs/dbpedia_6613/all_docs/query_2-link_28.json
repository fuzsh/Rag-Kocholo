There are three Core Web Vitals:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n\nFirst Input Delay (FID)\n\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n\nIf field data shows pages score \"good\" for all three Core Web Vitals they pass the Core Web Vitals assessment. As of mid-June 2021, Google has started using Core Web Vitals as a ranking signal. But that's not the end of it, only the beginning. Core Web Vitals will only become more important from here on out.\n\nIn this article, we'll explain how to measure, interpret and improve your Core Web Vitals to deliver a better user experience, to ultimately make more money!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCore Web Vitals are a hot topic in the SEO community right now. For good reason: improving them makes for a better user experienceUser Experience\n\nUser experience (or UX for short) is a term used to describe the experience a user has with a product.\n\nLearn more, and also, they are now a ranking factorRanking Factor\n\nThe term “Ranking Factors” describes the criteria applied by search engines when evaluating web pages in order to compile the rankings of their search results. Ranking factors can relate to a website’s content, technical implementation, user signals, backlink profile or any other features the search engine considers relevant. Understanding ranking factors is a prerequisite for effective search engine optimization.\n\nLearn more for Google Search as part of the new page experience signals. The gradual rollout began as of mid-June 2021 and was completed by September 2nd 2021.\n\nIn order to pass the Core Web Vitals assessment, you need to score “good” for all three Core Web Vitals—Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)—based on field data.\n\nDoes your site pass the Core Web Vitals assessment?\n\nDo a quick check, and be alerted in case your Core Web Vitals go into orange or red!\n\nThroughout this article, we’ll frequently talk about field data and lab data. Because these are often misunderstood, we need to explain the difference right away:\n\nField data is gathered from real users through the Chrome User Experience Report (“CrUX” for short).\n\nLab data is gathered within a controlled environment without any involvement from real users.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, where do Core Web Vitals fit into Google’s ranking algorithms?\n\nGoogle used to gauge user experience based on whether a site:\n\nis mobile-friendly\n\noffers HTTPS\n\nis free of intrusive interstitials\n\nNow beside these three factors, they’ve added a fourth—Core Web Vitals—and together these form a group of signals that Google uses to grade “Page Experience”, as this handy illustration shows:\n\nIt’s important to note that Core Web Vitals—both field data and lab data metrics—will be a moving target: they’re a proxy for measuring user experience, and because the web and its users are constantly evolving, it’s only natural for Core Web Vitals to evolve too.\n\nWhy this guide on Core Web Vitals?\n\nBecause there is a lot of misinformation about Core Web Vitals—and the correct information is scattered all over the place. Even Google can’t keep everything in one place. By creating this guide, we aim to provide an evergreen resource with correct information about Core Web Vitals, and where to go if you want to dig deeper.\n\nUseful resources\n\nWhat are Core Web Vitals?\n\nWe can already hear you reciting the famous Top Gun quote “I feel the need… the need for speed!” in your head, but the Core Web Vitals metrics are about more than just speed.\n\nCore Web Vitals are a set of user-facing metrics related to speed, responsiveness and visual stability, to help site owners measure user experience on the web.\n\nThe Web Vitals metrics are split into Core Web Vitals and non-Core Web Vitals.\n\nThe Core Web Vitals are:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n\nFirst Input Delay (FID)\n\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n\nAnd the non-Core Web Vitals are:\n\nTotal Blocking Time (TBT)\n\nFirst Contentful Paint (FCP)\n\nSpeed Index (SI)\n\nTime to Interactive (TTI)\n\nEach metric measures how “good” one part of the Page Experience is. The illustration below shows how a page loads and where the different metrics come into play:\n\nBut before we go through all the Web Vitals, we first need to explain why they are important. We want you to have all the right ammunition to present a rock-solid case when you’re making a pitch to management, or the client, about improving a site’s Core Web Vitals.\n\nWhy should you care about Core Web Vitals?\n\nHere are the three main reasons you (and everyone) should care about Core Web Vitals:\n\nVisitors love fast sites that are easy and pleasant to use, on any device, from any location. The bottom line is: you’ll make more money if you’re providing a great user experience.\n\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, Core Web Vitals have become a ranking factor as of mid-June 2021. While we don’t expect to see a big shift right away and relevance remains much more important, we expect its importance to grow over time.\n\nPassing the Core Web Vitals assessment is likely to result in fewer users retreating back to the SERP, because you’re providing a good user experience—and Google has hinted they may start displaying a “Good Page Experience” badge in their search results. We call these “indirect ranking factors,” because they influence searcher behavior (e.g. more clicks for pages that have this badge), which is fed back into Google’s algorithms. In February 2021, JR Oakes was poking through Google Search Console’s front-end code when he noticed that Google may have already made some preparations in this area:\n\nUseful resources\n\n10 recent case studies from sites like Google, Vodafone, Yelp and Ebay show how even milliseconds can impact bounce rates, conversion rates, and ultimately your bottom line.\n\nAnd Cloudflare has collected several more such studies.\n\n15 years ago, Amazon learned that their revenue increased by 1% for every 100ms decrease in load time.\n\nWinning at SEO with great UX\n\nCore Web Vitals in detail\n\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into each of the Web Vitals metrics, starting with the Core Web Vitals!\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP) is a Core Web Vital that measures the time in seconds from when the page starts loading to when the largest text block or image element is rendered on the screen.\n\nIts aim is to measure when the page’s main contents have finished loading. The lower the LCP, the better. A fast LCP reassures users that a page is useful, because it’s a metric that measures perceived load speed. LCP is available in both field data and lab data.\n\nIn the field, the browser will stop reporting new LCP candidates as soon as the user interacts with the page (via tapping, scrolling, a keypress, switching tabs, or closing the tab). In the lab, it’s not entirely clear when the LCP is finished. We expect this moment to be when the page is nearing Time to Interactive (TTI), and it’s clear which element is the final LCP candidate.\n\nImportant considerations\n\nWhile a page is loading, the largest text block or image element may change, and the most recent candidate is used when measuring the LCP.\n\nFor example, consider when at the start an H1 heading is the largest text block, but later on a larger image is loaded. The larger image is then the leading candidate in measuring the LCP.\n\nPlease note that <svg> elements are currently not considered candidates for the Largest Contentful Paint. So if you’re loading a big logo as an <svg> element, it won’t be considered a LCP candidate. This was decided to keep things simple, and may change in the future.\n\nIt’s unclear whether <video> elements are currently considered LCP candidates; we’ve reached out to Google for clarification.\n\nHow to interpret your LCP score\n\nHere’s how to interpret your LCP score:\n\nGood: <= 2.5s (2.5 seconds or less)\n\nNeeds improvement: > 2.5s <= 4s (between 2.5 and 4 seconds)\n\nPoor: > 4s (more than 4 seconds)\n\nWhat does your site's LCP score look like?\n\nCheck your LCP score right away, and be alerted in case it worsens!\n\nWhat could be causing a poor LCP score\n\nThere could be any of a myriad of causes for a poor LCP score, for example slow server response times, render-blocking JavaScript and CSS, and having your largest content resources be too heavy, requiring too much time to load.\n\nImproving your LCP score\n\nYou can do lots of things to improve your LCP score—for example optimizing your critical rendering path, CSS, and images. Describing all of them is far beyond the scope of this article. So we recommend checking out web.dev’s resources on optimizing LCP scores instead.\n\nUseful resources\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP) explained by web.dev.\n\nFirst Input Delay (FID)\n\nFirst Input Delay (FID) is a Core Web Vital that measures the time in milliseconds from when a user first interacts with your site (i.e. when they click a link, tap a button, or press a key) to when the browser is able to respond to that interaction.\n\nThe FID underlies a user’s first impression of your site's interactivity and responsiveness. Better make it a good impression!\n\nAs the description of this metric suggests, it is one that can only be measured in the field, as it relies on user interaction. Therefore, the FID is only available in field data. The lower the FID, the better.\n\nFor testing within the lab, the Total Blocking Time metric is used, as it closely correlates with First Input Delay.\n\nImportant considerations\n\nThe FID does not measure the time it takes the browser to process an event (e.g. a tap on a button), nor the time it takes to update the user interface after that.\n\nInteractions such as scrolling and zooming aren’t counted as actions, because they’re continuous in nature and have very different performance constraints because the scrolling action is performed by the GPU instead of the CPU, or the CPU's compositor thread instead of main thread.\n\nHow to interpret your FID score\n\nHere’s how to interpret your FID score:\n\nGood: <= 100ms\n\nNeeds improvement: > 100ms and <= 300ms\n\nPoor: > 300ms\n\nWhat could be causing a poor FID score\n\nOne common reason for a poor FID score is that a browser’s main thread is busy parsing and executing JavaScript code. When the main thread is busy, it can’t yet respond to a user’s interaction.\n\nImproving your FID score\n\nIf you want to improve your FID score, you need to look closely at what’s keeping the browser from going interactive. Examples of things you can do to improve your FID score are:\n\nReducing JavaScript execution time.\n\nMinimizing work done in the main thread.\n\nReducing the impact of third-party code.\n\nDescribing the ins and outs of improving your FID score is beyond the scope of this article. So we recommend checking out web.dev’s resources on optimizing FID scores.\n\nUseful resources\n\nFirst Input Delay (FID) explained by web.dev.\n\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a Core Web Vital that measures the cumulative score of all unexpected layout shifts within the viewport that occur during a page’s entire lifecycle.\n\nIts aim is to measure a page’s “visual stability,” as that heavily influences the user experience. CLS is available in both field data and lab data. The lower the CLS score, the better the visual stability.\n\nCLS isn’t measured in seconds like most of the other metrics. It works from the viewport size, relates to elements that move between two frames—called unstable elements—and measures their movement in the viewport. The layout shift score is a product of two components: the “impact fraction” and the “distance fraction”.\n\nThe “impact fraction” is the area of the viewport that the unstable element takes up in both frames:\n\nThe “distance fraction” is the greatest distance the unstable element moves between both frames, divided by the viewport’s largest dimension (width or height):\n\nYou’ll find several examples to build an even better understanding of how CLS is calculated here.\n\nImportant considerations\n\n“A page’s entire lifecycle” means that when the page remains open for days, or even weeks, the CLS is measured the entire time. Obviously, this is where CLS field data and lab data will report differences, because tools only gather lab data for a very brief period.\n\nCorrectly testing for unexpected layout shifts in test environments can prove tricky, because some functionality may be disabled or work differently there. Some examples: cookie notifications may not be shown, live chat support may be disabled, and personalized content will not be loaded.\n\nHow to interpret your CLS score\n\nHere’s how to interpret your CLS score:\n\nGood: <= 0.1\n\nNeeds improvement: > 0.1 <= 0.25\n\nPoor: > 0.25\n\nWhat could be causing a poor CLS score\n\nUnexpected layout shifts often happen because of images or ads with undefined dimensions, resources that are loaded asynchronously, and situations where new DOM elements are dynamically added to a page, above existing content that has already been loaded. This results in content that has already been loaded being pushed away.\n\nImproving your CLS score\n\nYou can prevent unexpected layout shifts e.g. by always including size attributes for your images and videos and by not inserting content above other content that’s already loaded. We recommend checking out web.dev’s article on optimizing CLS scores to learn the full range of improvements you can make.\n\nUseful resources\n\nTotal Blocking Time (TBT)\n\nTotal Blocking Time (TBT) is a non-Core Web Vital that measures the total time in milliseconds between First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time To Interactive (TTI) where the main thread is blocked long enough to make it unresponsive to user input.\n\nTBT highly correlates with First Input Delay (FID), and is therefore considered the best alternative when testing in a lab environment where real user interaction isn’t possible. While TBT can be gathered in the field, it’s easily influenced by user interaction and doesn’t make for a reliable metric to measure how long it takes for a page to become responsive to user input. Therefore, TBT is only used in lab data.\n\nAny task that takes more than 50ms to execute is considered a long task, and the time on top of the 50ms is considered the “blocking time”. TBT is calculated by taking the sum of the blocking portion of all long tasks. For example, if there are three long tasks:\n\nTask A takes 75ms (25ms longer than 50ms)\n\nTask B takes 60ms (10ms longer than 50ms)\n\nTask C takes 85ms (35ms longer than 50ms)\n\nThe TBT is then: 70ms (25+10+35). The lower the TBT, the better.\n\nHow to interpret your TBT score\n\nHere’s how to interpret your TBT score:\n\nGood: <= 200ms\n\nNeeds improvement: > 200ms <= 600ms\n\nPoor: > 600ms\n\nCauses for a poor TBT score and how to improve it\n\nThe section Improving your FID score above and How to Improve your TBT score explain in detail what causes a poor TBT score, and how to improve it.\n\nUseful resources\n\nTotal Blocking Time (TBT) explained by web.dev.\n\nFirst Contentful Paint (FCP)\n\nFirst Contentful Paint (FCP) is a non-Core Web Vital that measures the time from when a page starts loading to when any part of that page’s content is rendered on the screen. Having a fast FCP reassures users that something is happening. Within this context, content means text, images (including background images), <svg> elements, and non-white <canvas> elements.\n\nFCP is available in both field data and lab data, and the lower the FCP, the better.\n\nHow to interpret your FCP score\n\nHere’s how to interpret your FCP score:\n\nGood: <= 1.8s\n\nNeeds improvement: > 1.8s <= 3s\n\nPoor: > 3s\n\nWhat could be causing a poor FCP score\n\nCommon causes for a poor FCP score are high server response times and render-blocking resources.\n\nImproving your FCP score\n\nYou can do a lot of things to improve your FCP score, for example eliminating render-blocking resources, removing unused CSS, minifying CSS, and using a CDN.\n\nThe topic of improving your FCP score really deserves an article of its own. Until we write one, we highly recommend you check out web.dev’s resources on optimizing FCP scores.\n\nUseful resources\n\nFirst Contentful Paint (FCP) explained by web.dev.\n\n10 Ways To Improve First Contentful Paint by WP Rocket.\n\nSpeed Index (SI)\n\nSpeed Index (SI) is a non-Core Web Vital that measures how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated during page load. It’s calculated using frame-by-frameFrame\n\nFrames can be laid down in HTML code to create clear structures for a website’s content.\n\nLearn more analysis of your page’s load behavior, counting the visual progression between frames captured every 100ms.\n\nSI is available in both field data and lab data.\n\nHow to interpret your SI score\n\nHere’s how to interpret your SI score:\n\nGood: <= 3.4s\n\nNeeds improvement: > 3.4s <= 5.8s\n\nPoor: > 5.8s\n\nWhat could be causing a poor SI score\n\nAnything preventing the page from loading quickly will hurt your SI score. Some of the causes that are mentioned for the other metrics, such as for example the main thread being blocked, apply here too.\n\nImproving your SI score\n\nIf you focus on improving overall page load performance, you’ll see your SI score improve too. We recommend checking out web.dev’s resource on this here.\n\nUseful resources\n\nSpeed Index (SI) explained by web.dev.\n\nTime to Interactive (TTI)\n\nTime to Interactive (TTI) is a non-Core Web Vital that measures the time from when the page starts loading to when it's fully interactive.\n\nFor it to be fully interactive, it needs to:\n\nDisplay useful content (measured by First Contentful Paint).\n\nHave most visible page elements rendered.\n\nRespond to user interactions within 50 ms.\n\nWhile it’s possible to measure TTI in the field, it’s not recommended, because user interaction can heavily influence your page’s TTI. Therefore, you should only use TTI from a lab data environment.\n\nHow to interpret your TTI score\n\nHere’s how to interpret your TTI score:\n\nGood: <= 3.8s\n\nNeeds improvement: > 3.8s <= 7.3s\n\nPoor: > 7.3s\n\nWhat could be causing a poor TTI score\n\nSimilarly to the Speed Index metric above, many of the things causing poor scores in the other metrics we described apply to TTI too, because it’s a metric that encompasses those other metrics.\n\nImproving your TTI score\n\nWe recommend checking out this web.dev article for next steps on how to improve your TTI.\n\nUseful resources\n\nTime to Interactive (General explanation) by web.dev.\n\nTime to Interactive (Lighthouse metric) explained by web.dev.\n\nComparing apples to apples\n\nWhen it comes to Core Web Vitals data, it’s essential that we compare apples to apples. That’s why we need to hammer down the differences between field data and lab data, as well as mobile data and desktop data.\n\nField data vs. lab data\n\nThere are two types of data:\n\nField data is collected from from real users. Each with their unique device and network connection, through the Chrome User Experience Report (“CrUX report” for short).\n\nLab data is not collected from real users. It's collected within a controlled environment with a predefined device and network connection settings.\n\nIt’s essential that you understand the difference between these two data types. Take a second to let it sink in, as it is perhaps the most commonly misunderstood aspect of Core Web Vitals metrics.\n\nYou may be getting great scores in Lighthouse (lab data) and be high-fiving yourself, while your actual users are having a poor user experience (field data). Alternatively, you can have the same in reverse—great scores based on field data and poor lab data scores!\n\nThen there’s the “Origin Summary” which is based on field data representing the aggregate experience of all pages served from your site. Note that if you have some specific page templates that load notoriously slowly, this will hurt your Origin Summary score.\n\nMonitor your site's Origin Summary data\n\nBe alerted when your site stops passing the Core Web Vitals assessment!\n\nWeb Vitals metrics and availability\n\nHere’s a handy overview of Web Vitals metrics’ availability in field and lab data:\n\nWhat else you need to know about field data\n\nField data:\n\nMay not be available for your pages if they aren’t getting enough visitors, meaning not enough CrUX data. This goes for both individual URLs and your Origin Summary.\n\nIs less useful for debugging, because after you make some improvements, you’ll need to wait for new CrUX data to come rolling in. Therefore, we recommend relying on lab data for debugging purposes.\n\nIncludes data from markets you’re not necessarily catering to, as well. For example, if you’re primarily targeting the United States, but you’re getting a lot of traffic from emerging markets that don’t have the same access to fast internet and hardware, you’re going to see very mixed field data, simply because the audience your field data is collected from is also very mixed.\n\nMay also include data from non-indexable pages such as PPC landing pages (source).\n\nWhat else you need to know about lab data\n\nLab data:\n\nIs collected (as of April 2021) by emulating a Moto G4 mobile phone with a fast 3G connection.\n\nDoesn’t include user interaction data, because lab data is simulated. That’s why First Input Delay (FID) isn’t available in lab environments.\n\nProduces reproducible results, because you control the hardware and settings (internet connection and CPU performance).\n\nField data vs. Lab data summarized\n\nUseful resources\n\nMobile data vs. desktop data\n\nYou’ll come across mobile data, desktop data, and a mix of both when researching your Core Web Vitals’ scores.\n\nYou can see the field data for mobile and desktop separately in PageSpeed Insights and Google Search ConsoleGoogle Search Console\n\nThe Google Search Console is a free web analysis tool offered by Google.\n\nLearn more and by exploring the CrUX data via BigQuery and the CrUX Dashboard.\n\nIt’s common to see your desktop scores being better than your mobile scores. It just makes sense, considering that a desktop device often has better hardware and a faster, more reliable internet connection.\n\nNow that we’ve explained the Web Vitals metrics and the differences between field data and lab data, and desktop and mobile data, let’s go through the most popular tools and see what our Web Vitals look like through:\n\nContentKing\n\nPageSpeed Insights\n\nweb.dev Measure\n\nGoogle Search Console\n\nContentKing\n\nContentKing monitors websites in real-time, keeps track of content changes and flags SEO issues as they happen. In case of trouble, you'll be alerted.\n\nWhen it comes to Core Web Vitals, the ContentKing platform monitors your site's Origin Summary (field data) and Lighthouse metrics (lab data) for all of your pages.\n\nOrigin Summary\n\nThe Origin Summary is an aggregate across all pages on your site, making it a great metric to quickly check how your site's overall Core Web Vitals are looking:\n\nIn this example, the Core Web Vitals assessment is passed.\n\nFrom there, you can drill down to see what improvements you can still make:\n\nWhile First Contentful Paint isn't a Core Web Vitals metric at the moment, it is an important indicator for perceived load time.\n\nOn top of that, we think Google will make First Contentful Paint a Core Web Vital in the future, or at the very least increase its importance even more.\n\nMonitor your site's Core Web Vitals\n\nBe alerted when your site stops passing the Core Web Vitals assessment!\n\nLighthouse Monitoring\n\nLighthouse is an open-source initiative that diagnoses pages, helping you to improve their performance based on lab data. Lighthouse is used by various web performance tools (such as PageSpeed Insights, Web.dev Measure and ContentKing).\n\nContentKing monitors your Lighthouse scores across all of your pages on auto-pilot.\n\nUsing the Pages' Graph view you can easily see your overall performance:\n\nYou can filter and sort on the Lighthouse data in Pages' Table view:\n\nAnd of course, you can check out how individual pages are performing:\n\n…what you need to improve:\n\n…how the Lighthouse metrics change:\n\nAnd last, but not least, ContentKing will also alert you in case your Lighthouse Web Vitals suddenly drop!\n\nCore Web Vitals Lighthouse Monitoring\n\nTrack all changes, and be alerted about sudden drops!\n\nUseful resources\n\nPageSpeed Insights (PSI)\n\nGoogle’s PageSpeed Insights tool (“PSI” for short) lets you submit a URL, and it will then do three things:\n\nPull up field data\n\nCollect lab data by running Lighthouse.\n\nSuggest improvements under “Opportunities” and “Diagnostics.”\n\nWe submit our homepageHomepage\n\nA homepage is a collection of HTML documents that can be called up as individual webpages via one URL on the web with a client such as a browser.\n\nLearn more again, and this is the field data we get:\n\nPageSpeed Insights shows you what data they have for your URL. You may see that some metrics aren't available, those will be greyed out. This is an improvement, as in the early days the tool would hide all metrics if at least one of them wasn't available.\n\nBelow the URL-specific field data, we can choose whether to display the “Origin Summary” (the aggregate user experience of all pages served from our site):\n\nNote that the Origin Summary paints a different picture of our performance. Our side-wide performance is lower than the homepage’s performance, meaning that pages other than the homepage are dragging our overall performance down.\n\nIf you scroll down a bit more, you’ll see the Lab Data:\n\nIf you compare our lab data results from PageSpeed Insights vs. Lighthouse, you’ll find they are different. Even though we’re testing using the same settings, we’re not:\n\nIn the same location (our physical location versus the location used by PSI).\n\nRunning the same hardware (a 2018 MacBook versus PSI’s setup).\n\nUsing the same network connection (WiFi vs PSI’s setup).\n\nweb.dev Measure\n\nweb.dev Measure is an alternative to PageSpeed Insights. Submit a URL, and Measure will report its Web Vitals based on lab data gathered using Lighthouse, in an interface that’s slightly easier to navigate. This is what it reports for our homepage:\n\nAs expected, we’re again seeing different reported metrics—even though the same tests were performed using the same settings. Again, this comes down to the fact that you can’t reliably create the exact same conditions when running Lighthouse from a different location, on different hardware, on a different network connection.\n\nGoogle Search Console\n\nGoogle Search Console provides field data for both desktop and mobile devices for all your verified properties. When you head over to Enhancements > Core Web Vitals, you’ll find the following screen:\n\nWhen you click on Open report for either Mobile or Desktop, this displays a more detailed view of your Core Web Vitals performance for that device type. If we click Mobile, this is what we see:\n\nLooks like we’re doing pretty good!\n\nClick any of the rows in the Details table to reach an overview with example URLs. URLs that Google deems to be similar are grouped together. For our site for example, some of the different templates are grouped together. It makes sense for Google to group these URLs, as they often suffer from the same issues holding back page load performance.\n\nHow is your Lighthouse performance score calculated?\n\nWe’ve covered the Web Vitals scores in great detail, but we have yet to touch on how the overall Lighthouse performance score is calculated. First of all, the Lighthouse performance score is based on lab data. It’s a value on a scale from 4 (very bad) to 100 (amazing). It’s a weighted average of the Web Vitals’ metric scores, and the scores aren’t all weighted the same.\n\nThe weights for the current version —version 8— and the previous version 6/7 are as follows:\n\nNote: vitals with a * are Core Web Vitals\n\nImportant notes:\n\nThe performance score you’ll find in Lighthouse, and other tools that rely on Lighthouse data, is always based on lab data.\n\nIn the table above, only two Core Web Vitals metrics are shown. That’s because the third one, First Input Delay, isn’t measurable in a lab environment.\n\nThe Web Vitals metrics scores are calculated based on their performance relative to real website performance data from the HTTP Archive.\n\nFor example: a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric value of 1,220 ms is mapped to a metric score of 99 based on HTTP Archive data.\n\nLighthouse then uses the following color-coded ranges to “judge” your score:\n\nRed (poor): 0 to 49\n\nOrange (needs improvement): from 50 to 89\n\nGreen (good): from 90 to 100\n\nWe highly recommend playing around with the Lighthouse Scoring Calculator, which immediately updates the score when you change the metrics. To save time configuring the calculator, plug in a URL in PageSpeed Insights and click the See calculator link beneath the table with the lab data:\n\nDon’t forget that in order to pass the Core Web Vitals assessment, your page needs to show you’re scoring in the green for all three Core Web Vitals:\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n\nFirst Input Delay (FID)\n\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n\nUseful resources\n\nThe future of Core Web Vitals\n\nWe’ve covered what the Core Web Vitals are right now, but what does the future hold for us? We’re likely to see a lot of changes over the next few years, as Google will continue to tweak them.\n\nHere’s what we know so far:\n\nThe Core Web Vital set will grow over time: while Google wants to keep the amount of Core Web Vitals as low as possible, and the Web Vitals as easy to understand and measure as possible, it’s likely the set will grow over time. First Contentful Paint (FCP) is a prime candidate to be added for example; see the Chrome Dev Summit recording from Feb 12 2021 and the “Exploring the future of Core Web Vitals recording” from Dec 14 2020.\n\nIncreased weight of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and tweaks: the weight of CLS is likely to be increased, and they’re looking to improve the handling of long-lived pages, as layout shifts now continue to be added to the CLS score after interaction.\n\nSupport for measuring animation performance: user experience goes beyond initial page load, so Google’s looking into adding metrics that measure animation performance.\n\nFirst Input Delay (FID) could become stricter: lowering the FID time to 50-75ms could measure the user experience more accurately.\n\nBetter support for Single Page Applications (SPAs): when using SPAs, the app transitions do not have performance metrics because they don’t have unique URLs. For example, First Input Delay (FID) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) are only measured upon initial load, but the Cumulative Layout Shift keeps increasing with every interaction. Therefore, Google is looking into ways to better measure Web Vitals in SPAs.\n\nWe additionally expect that:\n\nCore Web Vitals are a moving target: right now, the Moto G4 on a fast 3G connection is leading in determining your page’s Core Web Vitals, but as new, more advanced phones are developed and become available, and faster internet connections become the default, we expect Google will default to those.\n\nWebsites may start considering blocking traffic from non-target markets: websites that get a lot of traffic from non-target markets that don’t have access to fast hardware and internet connections could consider preventing users from within these markets from accessing the website, thereby preventing a possible negative effect on their Core Web Vital scores.\n\nDisclaimer: we recommend against doing this, as this leads to a poor user experience.\n\nUseful resources\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Core Web Vitals\n\n1. How big of an SEO impact do Core Web Vitals have?\n\nGoogle has said that Core Web Vitals will likely only have a small impact, but we expect Core Web Vitals to become a more important ranking factor in the future. The reason? Everyone loves sites that provide a good user experience. And the Core Web Vitals metrics aim to measure that user experience.\n\nAdditionally, searchers are probably less likely to click back to the SERP if you’re providing a good user experience. This behavior is fed back into Google’s algorithm and will positively affect your page’s SEO performance.\n\n2. How do I pass the Core Web Vitals assessment?\n\nYou’ll pass the Core Web Vitals assessment if you score green (“good”) for all three Core Web Vitals: Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay and Cumulative Layout Shift, as based on real user data, called “field data”.\n\n3. Why are lab data and field data scores so different?\n\nLab data is collected in a simulated environment that aims to reliably run the same tests, using the same settings, whereas field data is collected from real user behaviour using different devices, with different internet connections, from different locations.\n\n4. Why is there no field data for my URL or Origin Summary?\n\nFor individual URLs, you may see the “Field Data — The Chrome User Experience Report does not have sufficient real-world speed data for this page” notice, and for Origin Summary, “The Chrome User Experience Report does not have sufficient real-world speed data for this origin.” These mean there is not enough CrUX data available to generate a representative anonymized view of your performance.\n\nSimply put, in order for the CrUX data to become available, you need to get more visitors onto your site! It’s likely you’ll then gain access to the Origin Summary first, because that’s an aggregate across all your pages.\n\nUseful resources\n\n5. Do non-indexable pages impact my Core Web Vitals?\n\nIt’s possible that pages that aren’t accessible and/or indexable for search engines do influence your Core Web Vitals scores. When asked in February 2021, Google’s John Mueller said they may have an impact."
