        "text": "Yes. Although the WAIS–IV VCI and the PRI are derived from fewer subtests (three) than the WAIS–III VIQ and PIQ (six and five subtests, respectively), the reliabilities are comparable to or higher than the reliabilities of the WAIS–III VIQ and PIQ. Some WAIS–III subtests that demonstrated relatively lower reliability were dropped from the battery or no longer contribute to the composite scores. The reliability of the retained WAIS–IV subtests is improved relative to the WAIS–III and the new subtests that were added are more reliable than those that were dropped from the WAIS–III.\n\nNo. When deriving composite scores, you can only substitute supplemental subtests substituted for core subtests that are spoiled or invalidated. Supplemental subtests are also used to provide additional information on cognitive functioning. However, you should decide before you administer the subtests which one to use to derive composite scores. If you need to use a supplemental subtest in place of a core subtest for clinical reasons, decide this before you administer the subtest—not after you have derived scaled scores. For example, an individual with motor impairment may be administered Figure Weights as a substitute for Block Design. Supplemental subtests are also useful when the scores within an index are widely discrepant. The additional information from the supplemental subtest can help tease out factors contributing to disparate results.\n\nThe development of the WAIS–IV was significantly influenced by current research in neurocognitive information processing models. The creation of new subtests was equally guided by clinical research and factorial data. The Wechsler four-factor structure was first introduced as an option within the WISC–III (1991) and the WAIS–III (1997). The WAIS–IV (2008) strengthens the Wechsler four-factor model, and removes its status as optional. The WAIS–IV subtests measure constructs that could be described using common CHC terms, such as fluid reasoning (SI, MR, FW), quantitative knowledge (AR), crystallized knowledge (VC, IN, CO), short term memory (DS, AR, LN), visual perception (BD, VP, PCm), long-term storage and retrieval (VC, IN), and processing speed (SS, CD, CA).\n\nObject Assembly was also dropped for a variety of reasons. There was an emphasis on decreasing dependence on time bonus points. Object Assembly was also lengthy to administer. Subtest performance was dependent on motor performance. In terms of user friendliness, the subtest manipulatives were heavy and contained multiple pieces that could be lost or damaged, or administered inconsistently. Some difficult choices were made in order to make room for the new subtests. The WAIS–III version of Object Assembly can still be used, with an understanding of the possible effects of using outdated norms.\n\nA number of factors were considered when making this decision. Information psychometric properties such as reliability, subtest floor, gradient, and ceiling, were considered and the correlation between WISC–IV and WAIS–IV composites had an edge over Comprehension. User-friendliness factors, such as administration time and ease of recording and scoring, clearly supported Information. The performance of different demographic groups was examined statistically, and results indicated smaller differences between racial/ethnic group performance and smaller differences based on level of education on Information, rather than Comprehension. At the subtest level, Comprehension was more sensitive than Information for a number of clinical groups; however, selecting Comprehension as a core subtest did not improve the clinical sensitivity of the VCI or the FSIQ for those groups. With respect to construct coverage, the specificity (unique contribution to the battery) of Information was higher than that of Comprehension, and the g-loadings were almost identical, and there was no clear pattern of differential correlations with reasoning tasks with Information compared with Comprehension. Consideration was additionally given to customer preference, in the form of market research surveys specifically addressing this choice and that captured customers' desire for decreased administration time.\n\nDigit Span Sequencing was added to increase the working memory demands of the Digit Span subtest relative to the previous version, in response to research indicating different cognitive demands for the Digit Span Forward and Digit Span Backward tasks. The total raw score for Digit Span is now based on Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, and Digit Span Sequencing. Digit Span Forward must be administered, as pilot study data indicated the omission of this task results in lower Digit Span Backward scores for some examinees (possibly due to the loss of instructional progression). Retaining Digit Span Forward also ensures sufficient floor items for examinees with intellectual disability or general intellectual deficiency. The separate process scores for each of the three tasks allow practitioners to evaluate differential performance across the tasks.\n\nIt was determined during standardization that querying certain responses did not result in any additional information. You have the option to query these responses if, based on your clinical judgment, the examinee's performance on surrounding items, and other test behavior observations, you believe the examinee may be able to improve upon the initial response. However, clearly wrong responses should not be queried. In addition, the responses marked with a (Q) in the manual must be queried.\n\nThe shortened discontinue rules reduced the overall testing time. Standardization discontinue rules were set generously to enable the examinee to attempt all passable items, yet limit the number of items presented. Final adjustments to the discontinue rule for each subtest were made based on empirical studies of the standardization data. The percentile ranks of examinees within an age group were compared before and after application of the reduced discontinue rule. The discontinue rule was set at the lowest number of consecutive scores of 0 that resulted in a rank-order correlation of .98 or higher. For example, the Similarities discontinue rule was five consecutive scores of 0 for standardization and was reduced to three consecutive scores of 0 for the final version of the scale. Following the reduction, 99% of the examinees' Similarities total raw scores remained at the same relative position within their age group.\n\nThe VCI is the functional equivalent of the VIQ. Similarly, the PRI is the functional equivalent of the PIQ. You should use the VCI and PRI as you would use the VIQ and PIQ. A number of other discrepancy analyses can be conducted between the index scores (e.g., VCI versus WMI or PSI; PRI versus WMI or PSI, WMI versus PSI).\n\nThe process-level discrepancy comparisons reflect the differences between scores for a subtest and the corresponding process score (i.e., Block Design [BD] and Block Design No Time Bonus [BDN]), or differences between two process scores for a single subtest (e.g., Digit Span Forward [DSF] and Digit Span Backward [DSB]). These process-level discrepancy comparisons may be of particular clinical interest. For example, additional information on the contribution of speed to an examinee's Block Design performance may be obtained from comparing the BD and BDN scaled scores. Prior to interpretation, the practitioner should know whether such a difference is statistically significant and how frequently it occurs in the normative sample.\n\nWe did extensive market research with customers, using unaided questions, to determine the need for new clinical studies. New clinical groups were chosen based on these responses, including Gifted Intellectual Functioning, Borderline Intellectual Functioning, Asperger's Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Mild Cognitive Impairment.\n\nIf you are interested in conducting clinical studies with other groups, you may request permission via the following website: https://pearsonassessments.com/hai/ContactUs.aspx. Pearson may provide support for such studies by providing test materials and matched control groups for comparison.\n\nThis is due to the difference in the core subtests between WAIS–III and WAIS–IV; core subtests in the WAIS–IV reflect the increased emphasis on fluid reasoning, working memory, and processing speed in more recent conceptualizations of intelligence. Compared to the WAIS–III, the WAIS–IV FSIQ deemphasizes crystallized knowledge (Comprehension is supplemental), and increases the contribution of Processing Speed (both Coding and Symbol Search are core). The WAIS–IV FSIQ is comprised of all 10 subtests that comprise the four index scores, including the Working Memory and Processing Speed subtests. The WAIS–III subtests used to derive the FSIQ included only one subtest from the Processing Speed scale, and one additional subtest each from the Verbal Comprehension and Perceptual Organization scales. Gifted examinees tend to score lower on Processing Speed subtests relative to subtests from other scales, perhaps due to a problem solving approach that stresses accuracy over speed.\n\nIn addition to the difference in the core subtests on WAIS–III and WAIS–IV, the norms for the newer test are slightly harder due to the Flynn effect. Although some examinees exhibit scores that regress to the mean upon retesting, analyses of the normative data from the WAIS–III and WAIS–IV indicate that the same percentage of examinees, approximately 2%, is identified as gifted based on the FSIQ. However, the same examinees may not be identified due to the shift in the conceptualization of intelligence reflected in the core subtests that contribute to the WAIS–IV FSIQ.\n\nThe WAIS–III has been adapted and standardized in 16 different countries. For examinees whose families have recently immigrated, these are the most current, valid tests available in their first language. Adaptations for Canada, United Kingdom, France and French-speaking Belgium, The Netherlands and Flemish-speaking Belgium, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Sweden, Lithuania, Slovenia, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Puerto Rico can be obtained by contacting Pearson. Use of these adaptations requires an examiner or experienced professional who is fluent in the examinee's language.\n\nThe WAIS–IV for Canada is currently in development. Standardization projects are underway for English language versions in Australia and England; a French version is also under development for use in French-speaking Canada.\n\nThese particular subtests were omitted from the test protocol for ages 70–90 for various reasons. These subtests were not administered to ages 70–90 due to concerns with fatigue in older adults. Standardization editions include more items, involve using longer discontinue rules, and require additional recording procedures relative to final editions of tests. These factors increase testing time. In standardization, examinees typically are administered both the main test being standardized (e.g., WAIS–IV) and various other tests required to establish validity (e.g., WMS–IV, WAIS–III).\n\nThe introduction of Digit Span Sequencing decreased the unique information that Letter–Number Sequencing contributes to the battery. Figure Weights and Cancellation were new subtests, with unproven utility for older adults. All of these subtests were likely to be selected as supplemental subtests. Ultimately, the decision was made to omit these subtests for these ages.\n\nSimilar to Block Design, higher ability examinees tend to perform Visual Puzzles and Figure Weights items more quickly. Given enough time, low ability examinees can eventually respond to items correctly. This is not the case with Matrix Reasoning. The 30 second guideline was established because completion time data indicated that the vast majority of examinees who will respond correctly do so within 30 seconds, but giving additional time to low ability examinees did not result in correct scores. A strict time limit is therefore unnecessary: Grant additional time if the examinee has established a pattern of providing delayed but correct responses as the item difficulty increases.\n\nThere is a distinction between reordering and sequencing: Reordering involves placing the numbers as a group prior to the letters as a group, and sequencing involves placing the numbers in numerical order and the letters in alphabetical order—regardless of which grouping comes first. The reason for instructing examinees to reorder the numbers before the letters is to provide a structured way of approaching the task, which is especially helpful for examinees that are anxious or have difficulty structuring their own work.\n\nThe WAIS–IV version of Letter–Number Sequencing introduces a new graduated teaching strategy. Using Sample Item A, the examinee is taught to reorder the number before the letter for the two-character trials. If the examinee does not reorder correctly as instructed, no credit is awarded for a given trial on Items 1–2. Sample Item B is used to teach the examinee to sequence the numbers and letters, while maintaining the previous reordering instruction. For Items 3–10, credit is awarded for sequencing alone: Regardless of how the examinee reorders the numbers and letters, he or she is using working memory to sequence the numbers and sequence the letters. Although the incorrect reordering approach has always been infrequently observed, the graduated teaching strategy introduced for WAIS–IV has reduced the frequency of incorrect reordering even further. In addition, prior data analysis results have indicated that these items are equally difficult when either numbers or letters are given first.\n\nIndividuals with color-perception differences are a group that encompasses greater than 10% of the general population. These issues are much more common in males. We have made every effort to ensure our items, including those on the WAIS–IV, WISC–IV, WPPSI–III, and WASI, are free of bias against these individuals. Items are reviewed by color-perception differences experts, as well as individuals with color-perception differences, during the early stages of the test-development process. In addition, acetate overlays have been utilized so that the test developers can understand the appearance of the stimuli to individuals with various color-perception differences. Items are also copied in black and white to check appearance to those with monochromatic color perception. All items are also subjected to an electronic \"color-blindness\" simulator, to check item appearance with every type of color-perception difference and ensure that the intensity and saturation of colors are not confused or resulting in different responses.\n\nLike their predecessors, the WAIS–IV and the forthcoming Wechsler Memory Scale–Fourth Edition (WMS–IV; Wechsler, in press) research programs overlapped during the standardization stages to allow co-norming. The linkage provides a more complete picture of cognitive functioning in the areas of intellectual ability and memory, and enables a direct comparison of intelligence and memory through normative information. The linkage additionally enables prediction of memory scores on the basis of intellectual ability scores and interpretation of memory scores in the context of intellectual ability scores. Information regarding the co-normative sample, correlations between measures, and analyses relevant to concurrent use of the two scales (e.g., ability-memory discrepancy comparisons and ability-memory contrast scores) will be reported in the WMS–IV Technical and Interpretive Manual (Wechsler, in press)."
