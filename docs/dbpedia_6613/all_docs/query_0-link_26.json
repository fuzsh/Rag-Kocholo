        "text": "Overview\n\nAdult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder that includes a combination of persistent problems, such as difficulty paying attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. Adult ADHD can lead to unstable relationships, poor work or school performance, low self-esteem, and other problems.\n\nThough it's called adult ADHD, symptoms start in early childhood and continue into adulthood. In some cases, ADHD is not recognized or diagnosed until the person is an adult. Adult ADHD symptoms may not be as clear as ADHD symptoms in children. In adults, hyperactivity may decrease, but struggles with impulsiveness, restlessness and difficulty paying attention may continue.\n\nTreatment for adult ADHD is similar to treatment for childhood ADHD. Adult ADHD treatment includes medications, psychological counseling (psychotherapy) and treatment for any mental health conditions that occur along with ADHD.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSome people with ADHD have fewer symptoms as they age, but some adults continue to have major symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. In adults, the main features of ADHD may include difficulty paying attention, impulsiveness and restlessness. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.\n\nMany adults with ADHD aren't aware they have it — they just know that everyday tasks can be a challenge. Adults with ADHD may find it difficult to focus and prioritize, leading to missed deadlines and forgotten meetings or social plans. The inability to control impulses can range from impatience waiting in line or driving in traffic to mood swings and outbursts of anger.\n\nAdult ADHD symptoms may include:\n\nImpulsiveness\n\nDisorganization and problems prioritizing\n\nPoor time management skills\n\nProblems focusing on a task\n\nTrouble multitasking\n\nExcessive activity or restlessness\n\nPoor planning\n\nLow frustration tolerance\n\nFrequent mood swings\n\nProblems following through and completing tasks\n\nHot temper\n\nTrouble coping with stress\n\nWhat's typical behavior and what's ADHD?\n\nAlmost everyone has some symptoms similar to ADHD at some point in their lives. If your difficulties are recent or occurred only occasionally in the past, you probably don't have ADHD. ADHD is diagnosed only when symptoms are severe enough to cause ongoing problems in more than one area of your life. These persistent and disruptive symptoms can be traced back to early childhood.\n\nDiagnosis of ADHD in adults can be difficult because certain ADHD symptoms are similar to those caused by other conditions, such as anxiety or mood disorders. And many adults with ADHD also have at least one other mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nIf any of the symptoms listed above continually disrupt your life, talk to your doctor about whether you might have ADHD.\n\nDifferent types of health care professionals may diagnose and supervise treatment for ADHD. Seek a provider who has training and experience in caring for adults with ADHD.\n\nCauses\n\nWhile the exact cause of ADHD is not clear, research efforts continue. Factors that may be involved in the development of ADHD include:\n\nGenetics. ADHD can run in families, and studies indicate that genes may play a role.\n\nEnvironment. Certain environmental factors also may increase risk, such as lead exposure as a child.\n\nProblems during development. Problems with the central nervous system at key moments in development may play a role.\n\nRisk factors\n\nRisk of ADHD may increase if:\n\nYou have blood relatives, such as a parent or sibling, with ADHD or another mental health disorder\n\nYour mother smoked, drank alcohol or used drugs during pregnancy\n\nAs a child, you were exposed to environmental toxins — such as lead, found mainly in paint and pipes in older buildings\n\nYou were born prematurely\n\nComplications\n\nADHD can make life difficult for you. ADHD has been linked to:\n\nPoor school or work performance\n\nUnemployment\n\nFinancial problems\n\nTrouble with the law\n\nAlcohol or other substance misuse\n\nFrequent car accidents or other accidents\n\nUnstable relationships\n\nPoor physical and mental health\n\nPoor self-image\n\nSuicide attempts\n\nCoexisting conditions\n\nAlthough ADHD doesn't cause other psychological or developmental problems, other disorders often occur along with ADHD and make treatment more challenging.
