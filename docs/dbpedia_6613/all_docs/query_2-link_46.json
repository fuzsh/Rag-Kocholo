        "text": "Our spam policies help protect users and improve the quality of search results. To be eligible to appear in Google web search results (web pages, images, videos, news content or other material that Google finds from across the web), content shouldn't violate Google Search's overall policies or the spam policies listed on this page. These policies apply to all web search results, including those from Google's own properties.\n\nWe detect policy-violating content and behaviors both through automated systems and, as needed, human review that can result in a manual action. Sites that violate our policies may rank lower in results or not appear in results at all.\n\nIf you believe that a site is violating Google's spam policies, let us know by filing a search quality user report. We're focused on developing scalable and automated solutions to problems, and we'll use these reports to further improve our spam detection systems.\n\nOur policies cover common forms of spam, but Google may act against any type of spam we detect.\n\nCloaking\n\nCloaking refers to the practice of presenting different content to users and search engines with the intent to manipulate search rankings and mislead users. Examples of cloaking include:\n\nShowing a page about travel destinations to search engines while showing a page about discount drugs to users\n\nInserting text or keywords into a page only when the user agent that is requesting the page is a search engine, not a human visitor\n\nIf your site uses technologies that search engines have difficulty accessing, like JavaScript or images, see our recommendations for making that content accessible to search engines and users without cloaking.\n\nIf a site is hacked, it's not uncommon for the hacker to use cloaking to make the hack harder for the site owner to detect. Read more about fixing hacked sites and avoiding being hacked.\n\nIf you operate a paywall or a content-gating mechanism, we don't consider this to be cloaking if Google can see the full content of what's behind the paywall just like any person who has access to the gated material and if you follow our Flexible Sampling general guidance.\n\nDoorways\n\nDoorways are sites or pages created to rank for specific, similar search queries. They lead users to intermediate pages that are not as useful as the final destination. Examples of doorways include:\n\nHaving multiple websites with slight variations to the URL and home page to maximize their reach for any specific query\n\nHaving multiple domain names or pages targeted at specific regions or cities that funnel users to one page\n\nPages generated to funnel visitors into the actual usable or relevant portion of your site(s)\n\nSubstantially similar pages that are closer to search results than a clearly defined, browseable hierarchy\n\nExpired domain abuse\n\nExpired domain abuse is where an expired domain name is purchased and repurposed primarily to manipulate search rankings by hosting content that provides little to no value to users. Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to:\n\nAffiliate content on a site previously used by a government agency\n\nCommercial medical products being sold on a site previously used by a non-profit medical charity\n\nCasino-related content on a former elementary school site\n\nHacked content\n\nHacked content is any content placed on a site without permission, due to vulnerabilities in a site's security. Hacked content gives poor search results to our users and can potentially install malicious content on their machines. Examples of hacking include:\n\nCode injection: When hackers gain access to your website, they might try to inject malicious code into existing pages on your site. This often takes the form of malicious JavaScript injected directly into the site, or into iframes.\n\nPage injection: Sometimes, due to security flaws, hackers are able to add new pages to your site that contain spammy or malicious content. These pages are often meant to manipulate search engines or to attempt phishing. Your existing pages might not show signs of hacking, but these newly-created pages could harm your site's visitors or your site's performance in search results.\n\nContent injection: Hackers might also try to subtly manipulate existing pages on your site. Their goal is to add content to your site that search engines can see but which may be harder for you and your users to spot. This can involve adding hidden links or hidden text to a page by using CSS or HTML, or it can involve more complex changes like cloaking.\n\nRedirects: Hackers might inject malicious code to your website that redirects some users to harmful or spammy pages. The kind of redirect sometimes depends on the referrer, user agent, or device. For example, clicking a URL in Google Search results could redirect you to a suspicious page, but there is no redirect when you visit the same URL directly from a browser.\n\nHere are our tips on fixing hacked sites and avoiding being hacked.\n\nHidden text or links is the act of placing content on a page in a way solely to manipulate search engines and not to be easily viewable by human visitors. Examples of hidden text or links that violate our policies:\n\nUsing white text on a white background\n\nHiding text behind an image\n\nUsing CSS to position text off-screen\n\nSetting the font size or opacity to 0\n\nHiding a link by only linking one small character (for example, a hyphen in the middle of a paragraph)\n\nThere are many web design elements today that utilize showing and hiding content in a dynamic way to improve user experience; these elements don't violate our policies:\n\nAccordion or tabbed content that toggle between hiding and showing additional content\n\nSlideshow or slider that cycles between several images or text paragraphs\n\nTooltip or similar text that displays additional content when users interact with over an element\n\nText that's only accessible to screen readers and is intended to improve the experience for those using screen readers\n\nKeyword stuffing\n\nKeyword stuffing refers to the practice of filling a web page with keywords or numbers in an attempt to manipulate rankings in Google Search results. Often these keywords appear in a list or group, unnaturally, or out of context. Examples of keyword stuffing include:\n\nLists of phone numbers without substantial added value\n\nBlocks of text that list cities and regions that a web page is trying to rank for\n\nRepeating the same words or phrases so often that it sounds unnatural. For example:\n\nUnlimited app store credit. There are so many sites that claim to offer app store credit for $0 but they're all fake and always mess up with users looking for unlimited app store credits. You can get limitless credits for app store right here on this website. Visit our unlimited app store credit page and get it today!\n\nLink spam\n\nGoogle uses links as a factor in determining the relevancy of web pages. Any links that are intended to manipulate rankings in Google Search results may be considered link spam. This includes any behavior that manipulates links to your site or outgoing links from your site. The following are examples of link spam:\n\nBuying or selling links for ranking purposes. This includes:\n\nExchanging money for links, or posts that contain links\n\nExchanging goods or services for links\n\nSending someone a product in exchange for them writing about it and including a link\n\nExcessive link exchanges (\"Link to me and I'll link to you\") or partner pages exclusively for the sake of cross-linking\n\nUsing automated programs or services to create links to your site\n\nRequiring a link as part of a Terms of Service, contract, or similar arrangement without allowing a third-party content owner the choice of qualifying the outbound link\n\nText advertisements or text links that don't block ranking credit\n\nAdvertorials or native advertising where payment is received for articles that include links that pass ranking credit, or links with optimized anchor text in articles, guest posts, or press releases distributed on other sites. For example:\n\nThere are many wedding rings on the market. If you want to have a wedding, you will have to pick the best ring. You will also need to buy flowers and a wedding dress.\n\nLow-quality directory or bookmark site links\n\nKeyword-rich, hidden, or low-quality links embedded in widgets that are distributed across various sites\n\nWidely distributed links in the footers or templates of various sites\n\nForum comments with optimized links in the post or signature, for example:\n\nThanks, that's great info!\n\n- Paul\n\npaul's pizza san diego pizza best pizza san diego\n\nCreating low-value content primarily for the purposes of manipulating linking and ranking signals\n\nGoogle does understand that buying and selling links is a normal part of the economy of the web for advertising and sponsorship purposes. It's not a violation of our policies to have such links as long as they are qualified with a rel=\"nofollow\" or rel=\"sponsored\" attribute value to the <a> tag.\n\nMachine-generated traffic\n\nMachine-generated traffic consumes resources and interferes with our ability to best serve users. Examples of automated traffic include:\n\nSending automated queries to Google\n\nScraping results for rank-checking purposes or other types of automated access to Google Search conducted without express permission\n\nSuch activities violate our spam policies and the Google Terms of Service.\n\nMalware and malicious behaviors\n\nGoogle checks websites to see whether they host malware or unwanted software that negatively affects the user experience.\n\nMalware is any software or mobile application specifically designed to harm a computer, a mobile device, the software it's running, or its users. Malware exhibits malicious behavior that can include installing software without user consent and installing harmful software such as viruses. Site owners sometimes don't realize that their downloadable files are considered malware, so these binaries might be hosted inadvertently.\n\nUnwanted software is an executable file or mobile application that engages in behavior that is deceptive, unexpected, or that negatively affects the user's browsing or computing experience. Examples include software that switches your home page or other browser settings to ones you don't want, or apps that leak private and personal information without proper disclosure.\n\nSite owners should make sure they don't violate the Unwanted Software Policy and follow our guidelines.\n\nMisleading functionality\n\nSite owners should create websites with high quality content and useful functionality that benefits users. However, some site owners intend to manipulate search ranking by intentionally creating sites with misleading functionality and services that trick users into thinking they would be able to access some content or services but in reality can not. Examples of misleading functionality include:\n\nA site with a fake generator that claims to provide app store credit but doesn't actually provide the credit\n\nA site that claims to provide certain functionality (for example, PDF merge, countdown timer, online dictionary service), but intentionally leads users to deceptive ads rather than providing the claimed services\n\nScaled content abuse\n\nScaled content abuse is when many pages are generated for the primary purpose of manipulating search rankings and not helping users. This abusive practice is typically focused on creating large amounts of unoriginal content that provides little to no value to users, no matter how it's created.\n\nExamples of scaled content abuse include, but are not limited to:\n\nUsing generative AI tools or other similar tools to generate many pages without adding value for users\n\nScraping feeds, search results, or other content to generate many pages (including through automated transformations like synonymizing, translating, or other obfuscation techniques), where little value is provided to users\n\nStitching or combining content from different web pages without adding value\n\nCreating multiple sites with the intent of hiding the scaled nature of the content\n\nCreating many pages where the content makes little or no sense to a reader but contains search keywords\n\nIf you're hosting such content on your site, exclude it from Search.\n\nScraped content\n\nSome site owners base their sites around content taken (\"scraped\") from other, often more reputable sites. Scraped content, even from high quality sources, without additional useful services or content provided by your site may not provide added value to users. It may also constitute copyright infringement. A site may also be demoted if a significant number of valid legal removal requests have been received. Examples of abusive scraping include:\n\nSites that copy and republish content from other sites without adding any original content or value, or even citing the original source\n\nSites that copy content from other sites, modify it only slightly (for example, by substituting synonyms or using automated techniques), and republish it\n\nSites that reproduce content feeds from other sites without providing some type of unique benefit to the user\n\nSites dedicated to embedding or compiling content, such as videos, images, or other media from other sites, without substantial added value to the user\n\nSneaky redirects\n\nRedirecting is the act of sending a visitor to a different URL than the one they initially requested. Sneaky redirecting is doing this maliciously in order to either show users and search engines different content or show users unexpected content that does not fulfill their original needs. Examples of sneaky redirects include:\n\nShowing search engines one type of content while redirecting users to something significantly different\n\nShowing desktop users a normal page while redirecting mobile users to a completely different spam domain\n\nWhile sneaky redirection is a type of spam, there are many legitimate, non-spam reasons to redirect one URL to another. Examples of legitimate redirects include:\n\nMoving your site to a new address\n\nConsolidating several pages into one\n\nRedirecting users to an internal page once they are logged in\n\nWhen examining if a redirect is sneaky, consider whether or not the redirect is intended to deceive either the users or search engines. Learn more about how to appropriately employ redirects on your site.\n\nSite reputation abuse\n\nSite reputation abuse is when third-party pages are published with little or no first-party oversight or involvement, where the purpose is to manipulate search rankings by taking advantage of the first-party site's ranking signals. Such third-party pages include sponsored, advertising, partner, or other third-party pages that are typically independent of a host site's main purpose or produced without close oversight or involvement of the host site, and provide little to no value to users.\n\nIllustrative examples of site reputation abuse include, but are not limited to:\n\nAn educational site hosting a page about reviews of payday loans written by a third-party that distributes the same page to other sites across the web, with the main purpose of manipulating search rankings\n\nA medical site hosting a third-party page about \"best casinos\" that's designed primarily to manipulate search rankings, with little to no involvement from the medical site\n\nA movie review site hosting third-party pages about topics that would be confusing to users to find on a movie review site (such as \"ways to buy followers on social media sites\", the \"best fortune teller sites\", and the \"best essay writing services\"), where the purpose is to manipulate search rankings\n\nA sports site hosting a page written by a third-party about \"workout supplements reviews\", where the sports site's editorial staff had little to no involvement in the content and the main purpose of hosting the page is to manipulate search rankings\n\nA news site hosting coupons provided by a third-party with little to no oversight or involvement from the hosting site, and where the main purpose is to manipulate search rankings\n\nIf you're hosting pages that violate this policy, exclude that third-party content from Search indexing.\n\nExamples that are NOT considered site reputation abuse include:\n\nWire service or press release service sites\n\nNews publications that have syndicated news content from other news publications\n\nSites designed to allow user-generated content, such as a forum website or comment sections\n\nColumns, opinion pieces, articles, and other work of an editorial nature where there is close involvement or review by the host site\n\nThird-party content (for example, \"advertorial\" or \"native advertising\" type pages) that's produced with close involvement of the host site, where the purpose is to share content directly to readers (such as through promotion within the publication itself), rather than hosting the content to manipulate search rankings\n\nEmbedding third-party ad units throughout a page or using affiliate links throughout a page, with links treated appropriately\n\nCoupons that are listed with close involvement of the hosting site\n\nThin affiliate pages\n\nThin affiliate pages are pages with product affiliate links on which the product descriptions and reviews are copied directly from the original merchant without any original content or added value.\n\nAffiliate pages can be considered thin if they are a part of a program that distributes its content across a network of affiliates without providing additional value. These sites often appear to be cookie-cutter sites or templates with the same or similar content replicated within the same site or across multiple domains or languages. If a Search results page returned several of these sites, all with the same content, thin affiliate pages would create a frustrating user experience.\n\nNot every site that participates in an affiliate program is a thin affiliate. Good affiliate sites add value by offering meaningful content or features. Examples of good affiliate pages include offering additional information about price, original product reviews, rigorous testing and ratings, navigation of products or categories, and product comparisons.\n\nUser-generated spam\n\nUser-generated spam is spammy content added to a site by users through a channel intended for user content. Often site owners are unaware of the spammy content. Examples of spammy user-generated content include:\n\nSpammy accounts on hosting services that anyone can register for\n\nSpammy posts on forum threads\n\nComment spam on blogs\n\nSpammy files uploaded to file hosting platforms\n\nHere are several tips on how to prevent abuse of your site's public areas. Here are our tips on fixing hacked sites and avoiding being hacked.\n\nOther behaviors that can lead to demotion or removal\n\nLegal removals\n\nWhen we receive a high volume of valid copyright removal requests involving a given site, we are able to use that to demote other content from the site in our results. This way, if there is other infringing content, people are less likely to encounter it versus the original content. We apply similar demotion signals to complaints involving defamation, counterfeit goods, and court-ordered removals. In the case of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), we always remove such content when it is identified and we demote all content from sites with a high proportion of CSAM content.\n\nPersonal information removals\n\nIf we process a high volume of personal information removals involving a site with exploitative removal practices, we demote other content from the site in our results. We also look to see if the same pattern of behavior is happening with other sites and, if so, apply demotions to content on those sites. We may apply similar demotion practices for sites that receive a high volume of removals of content involving doxxing content, explicit personal imagery created or shared without consent, or explicit non-consensual fake content.\n\nPolicy circumvention\n\nIf you continue to engage in actions intended to bypass our spam policies or content policies for Google Search, we may take appropriate action which may include restricting or removing eligibility for some of our search features (for example, Top Stories, Discover). Circumvention includes but is not limited to:\n\nCreating or using multiple sites with the intention of continuing to violate our policies\n\nUsing other methods intended to continue distributing content or engaging in a behavior that aims to violate our policies\n\nScam and fraud\n\nScam and fraud come in many forms, including but not limited to impersonating an official business or service through imposter sites, intentionally displaying false information about a business or service, or otherwise attracting users to a site on false pretenses. Using automated systems, Google seeks to identify pages with scammy or fraudulent content and prevent them from showing up in Google Search results. Examples of online scams and fraud include:\n\nImpersonating a well-known business or service provider to trick users into paying money to the wrong party\n\nCreating deceptive sites pretending to provide official customer support on behalf of a legitimate business or provide fake contact information of such business"
