        "text": "Yes, websites have a carbon footprint\n\nThe internet consumes a lot of electricity. 1021 TWh per year to be precise. To give you some perspective, thatâ€™s more than the entire United Kingdom.\n\nFrom data centres to transmission networks to the billions of connected devices that we hold in our hands, it is all consuming electricity, and in turn producing carbon emissions equal to or greater than the global aviation industry. Yikes!\n\nWe developed the first methodology for estimating the carbon emissions attributed to a website. This free tool is here to help raise awareness and inspire a more sustainable internet.\n\nIf you want help doing a more detailed analysis or need assistance reducing emissions from your web project, our team would be happy to discuss your requirements."
