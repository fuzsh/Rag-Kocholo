        "text": "What It Is\n\nWhat is a credit history?\n\nSometimes, people talk about your credit. What they mean is your credit history. Your credit history describes how you use money:\n\nHow many credit cards do you have?\n\nHow many loans do you have?\n\nDo you pay your bills on time?\n\nIf you have a credit card or a loan from a bank, you have a credit history. Companies collect information about your loans and credit cards.\n\nCompanies also collect information about how you pay your bills. They put this information in one place: your credit report.\n\nWhat is a credit report?\n\nYour credit report is a summary of your credit history. It lists:\n\nyour name, address, and Social Security number\n\nyour credit cards\n\nyour loans\n\nhow much money you owe\n\nif you pay your bills on time or late\n\nWhy do I have a credit report?\n\nBusinesses want to know about you before they lend you money. Would you want to lend money to someone who pays bills on time? Or to someone who always pays late?\n\nBusinesses look at your credit report to learn about you. They decide if they want to lend you money, or give you a credit card. Sometimes, employers look at your credit report when you apply for a job. Cell phone companies and insurance companies look at your credit report, too.\n\nWho makes my credit report?\n\nA company called a credit reporting company collects your information. There are three big credit reporting companies:\n\nTransUnion\n\nEquifax\n\nExperian\n\nThese companies write and keep a report about you.\n\nCan I see my credit report?\n\nYou can get a free copy of your credit report every year. That means one copy from each of the three companies that writes your reports.\n\nThe law says you can get your free credit reports if you:\n\ncall Annual Credit Report at 1-877-322-8228 or\n\ngo to AnnualCreditReport.com\n\nSomeone might say you can get a free report at another website. They probably are not telling the truth.\n\nWhat is a credit score?\n\nA credit score is a number. It is based on your credit history. But it does not come with your free credit report unless you pay for it.\n\nA high credit score means you have good credit. A low credit score means you have bad credit. Different companies have different scores. Low scores are around 300. High scores are around 700-850.\n\nDo I need to get my credit score?\n\nIt is very important to know what is in your credit report. But a credit score is a number that matches your credit history. If you know your history is good, your score will be good. You can get your credit report for free.\n\nIt costs money to find out your credit score. Sometimes a company might say the score is free. But if you look closely, you might find that you signed up for a service that checks your credit for you. Those services charge you every month.\n\nBefore you pay any money, ask yourself if you need to see your credit score. It might be interesting. But is it worth paying money for?\n\nFor Example\n\nWhat if I do not have credit?\n\nYou might not have a credit history if:\n\nyou have not had credit card\n\nyou have not gotten a loan from a bank or credit union\n\nWithout a credit history, it can be harder to get a job, an apartment, or even a credit card. It sounds crazy: You need credit to get credit.\n\nHow do I get credit?\n\nDo you want to build your credit history? You will need to pay bills that are included in a credit report.\n\nSometimes, utility companies put information into a credit report. Do you have utility bills in your name? That can help build credit.\n\nMany credit cards put information into credit reports.\n\nSometimes, you can get a store credit card that can help build credit.\n\nA secured credit card also can help you build your credit.\n\nRead more\n\nWhy is my credit report important?\n\nBusinesses look at your credit report when you apply for:\n\nloans from a bank\n\ncredit cards\n\njobs\n\ninsurance\n\nIf you apply for one of these, the business wants to know if you pay your bills. The business also wants to know if you owe money to someone else. The business uses the information in your credit report to decide whether to give you a loan, a credit card, a job, or insurance.\n\nWhat does “good credit” mean?\n\nSome people have good credit. Some people have bad credit. Some people do not have a credit history. Businesses see this in your credit report. Different things happen based on your credit history:\n\nThat means:\n\nI have more loan choices.\n\nIt is easier to get credit cards.\n\nI pay lower interest rates.\n\nI pay less for loans and credit cards.\n\nThat means:\n\nI have fewer loan choices.\n\nIt is harder to get credit cards.\n\nI pay higher interest rates.\n\nI pay more for loans and credit cards.\n\nThat means:\n\nI have no bank loan choices.\n\nIt is very hard to get credit cards.\n\nI pay high interest rates.\n\nLoans and credit cards are hard to get and cost a lot.\n\nAll this information is in your credit report.\n\nWhy should I get my credit report?\n\nAn important reason to get your credit report is to find problems or mistakes and fix them:\n\nYou might find somebody’s information in your report by mistake.\n\nYou might find information about you from a long time ago.\n\nYou might find accounts that are not yours. That might mean someone stole your identity.\n\nYou want to know what is in your report. The information in your report will help decide whether you get a loan, a credit card, a job or insurance.\n\nIf the information is wrong, you can try to fix it. If the information is right – but not so good – you can try to improve your credit history.\n\nWhere do I get my free credit report?\n\nYou can get your free credit report from Annual Credit Report. That is the only free place to get your report. You can get it online: AnnualCreditReport.com, or by phone: 1-877-322-8228.\n\nYou get one free report from each credit reporting company every year. That means you get three reports each year.\n\nWhat should I do when I get my credit report?\n\nYour credit report has a lot of information. Check to see if the information is correct. Is it your name and address? Do you recognize the accounts listed?\n\nIf there is wrong information in your report, try to fix it. You can write to the credit reporting company. Ask them to change the information that is wrong. You might need to send proof that the information is wrong – for example, a copy of a bill that shows the correct information. The credit reporting company must check it out and write back to you.\n\nHow do I improve my credit?\n\nLook at your free credit report. The report will tell you how to improve your credit history. Only you can improve your credit. No one else can fix information in your credit report that is not good, but is correct.\n\nIt takes time to improve your credit history. Here are some ways to help rebuild your credit.\n\nPay your bills by the date they are due. This is the most important thing you can do.\n\nLower the amount you owe, especially on your credit cards. Owing a lot of money hurts your credit history.\n\nDo not get new credit cards if you do not need them. A lot of new credit hurts your credit history.\n\nDo not close older credit cards. Having credit for a longer time helps your rating.\n\nAfter six to nine months of this, check your credit report again. You can use one of your free reports from Annual Credit Report.\n\nHow does a credit score work?\n\nYour credit score is a number related to your credit history. If your credit score is high, your credit is good. If your credit score is low, your credit is bad.\n\nThere are different credit scores. Each credit reporting company creates a credit score. Other companies create scores, too. The range is different, but it usually goes from about 300 (low) to 850 (high).\n\nIt costs money to look at your credit score. Sometimes a company might say the score is free. But usually there is a cost.\n\nWhat goes into a credit score?\n\nEach company has its own way to calculate your credit score. They look at:\n\nhow many loans and credit cards you have\n\nhow much money you owe\n\nhow long you have had credit\n\nhow much new credit you have\n\nThey look at the information in your credit report and give it a number. That is your credit score.\n\nIt is very important to know what is in your credit report. If your report is good, your score will be good. You can decide if it is worth paying money to see what number someone gives your credit history.\n\nRead more"
