        "text": "Most endorsements are required to have a Responsible Managing Individual (RMI). The RMI may be an owner, officer, partner, or employee of the business applying for the license. The RMI must have management or supervisory authority over the construction activities of the business. The RMI may only be listed on one license at a time as the RMI employee.\n\nTo qualify to be the RMI, the individual must:\n\nComplete the 16-hour pre-license training and pass the Oregon contractor exam, OR\n\nPass the NASCLA commercial contractor national exam and pass the Oregon contractor exam, OR\n\nProvide one or more Oregon license numbers that the owner, officer, member, or RMI has been continuously associated with during the time period beginning before July 1, 2000, until the date of their application, with no lapse of more than 24 months.\n\nNot be listed as an RMI employee on another license\n\nThe RMI must also complete a background check after turning in the application to the agency.\n\nImportant Note: Under Oregon law, if a contractor fails to pay its obligations and incurs construction-related debt, the RMI as well as the business owners will be prevented from obtaining a new CCB license until the debt has been satisfied.\n\nRMI Change\n\nTemporary RMI Notice\n\nWhat happens if the RMI leaves the business?\n\nIf the RMI leaves the business, the business must notify the CCB in writing immediately. The business will need to submit an RMI change form to appoint a qualified individual as the new RMI. Since the qualification process does take some time, you should also designate a temporary RMI and submit a temporary RMI form. This temporary designation is only valid for a maximum of 14 days.\n\nBusinesses may want to consider having more than one RMI to ensure there are no work interruptions if there is an unexpected loss of an RMI.\n\nWhich licenses arenâ€™t required to have an RMI?"
