        "text": "Resources to help educators understand student scores\n\nWIDA provides sample score reports, guides for understanding them, rubrics to connect results with instructional plans, and other resources to engage with families about what it all means. Every year, individual states set their own testing and score reporting timelines. Visit your member/state page to learn when students will test and when you can expect score reports.\n\nPlease see WIDA Alternate ACCESS Scores and Reports page for information on scores and scoring for that assessment.\n\nTypes of Score Reports\n\nThe same types of score reports are generated for all students taking ACCESS for ELLs (Online, Paper and Kindergarten).\n\nAll of the score reports provide score information for the same eight categories: four domains and four composite areas (Oral Language, Literacy, Comprehension, Overall). Composite scores are created from two or more domain scores.\n\nExpand each score type below for more information and sample reports.\n\nIndividual Student Report (ISR)\n\nThe ISR shows all the scores for an individual student. It provides brief descriptions of each proficiency level with a lot of visual support. Translated copies can be sent home with students and discussed at conferences with parents or guardians.\n\nUse when your focus is on a single student\n\nUse when talking to the student, their parents or guardians, and their other educators\n\nRefer to the Speaking and Writing Interpretive Rubrics when looking at those scores\n\nSample Reports\n\nSample ISR (English)\n\nSample ISR (Spanish)\n\nThese are just example reports. After testing is complete, ISRs will be available in many languages in WIDA AMS.\n\nStudent Roster Report (SRR)\n\nThe SRR contains information about a group of students within a single school and grade. It does not have visual supports or descriptions of each proficiency level, but it provides a concise overview of the results of a group of students.\n\nUse to look for patterns in student performance that could inform:\n\nClass placement\n\nForming work groups in a class\n\nIdentifying students who would benefit from different or additional support\n\nSample Report\n\nSample Student Roster Report\n\nFrequency Reports\n\nWIDA provides three frequency reports: School, District and State. They show the number and percentage of tested students (per grade) who scored at each proficiency level. Frequency reports do not show the performance of individual students. Instead, they provide an overview of a large group’s performance.\n\nUse to gain a sense of the success of school, district or state-wide efforts in educating ELs\n\nConsult when planning, developing or restructuring language services for ELs\n\nAvoid generalizing about the meaning behind differing scores, especially when the number of students is small\n\nSample Reports\n\nSample School Frequency Report\n\nSample District Frequency Report\n\nSample State Frequency Report\n\nTypes of Scores\n\nRaw Scores are the actual number of items or tasks the student responded correctly to. This score is the starting point, but since it doesn't take item difficulty into account, it doesn't help educators understand student performance. For this reason, raw scores are not included on ACCESS for ELLs score reports.\n\nScale Scores take item difficulty into account, so educators can use them to examine groups of students, or student performances over time. Scale scores on the domain tests are used to calculate the composite score categories.\n\nProficiency Level Scores provide an interpretation of scale scores. On ACCESS tests, they align to the six WIDA English language proficiency levels.\n\nUnderstanding ACCESS for ELLs Scores\n\nThe Interpretive Guide for Score Reports is a comprehensive document explaining the types of scores reported for students in grades K-12 who take ACCESS for ELLs assessments.\n\nInterpretive Guide for Score Reports\n\nUsing ACCESS for ELLs Scores\n\nACCESS for ELLs scores have many potential uses, from determining student placement to guiding the creation of new curricula. Test scores work best as a way to aid decision-making, in cases such as:\n\nEstablishing when English learners have attained English language proficiency according to state criteria\n\nMaking decisions about program entry and exit\n\nInforming classroom instruction and assessment\n\nWhich domains teachers could focus on\n\nWhat the WIDA ELD Standards Framework says about students’ current proficiency levels\n\nHow teachers can scaffold using the next level up\n\nMonitoring student progress by comparing current scores to previous scores\n\nDeciding on staffing levels\n\nUse rubrics to understand the scores students earn on WIDA assessments, analyze student performance in the classroom, and plan ways to scaffold language learning.\n\nSpeaking and Writing Rubrics\n\nUsing ACCESS for ELLs to Promote Beneficial Outcomes for English Learners: Flyer and Video\n\nThese resources provide a breakdown of the role school/district-level educators, state-level administrators and WIDA play in using or developing ACCESS test scores, interpreting scores and making decisions based on scores to best serve English learners.\n\nFlyer Details Video Details"
