        "text": "Do you have a lot of clothes that no longer fit or old housewares collecting dust in your home? Do these items take up a lot of space and are you unlikely to use them in the near future? If so, reselling them is an easy way to earn some money and clear out your closet at the same time.\n\nThere is now a plethora of different resale and e-commerce platforms that make it easier than ever for people to sell anything they want, from an old couch to a vintage watch to a handmade sweater. While it may take a little bit of work to post your old items on these platforms, they can be a fairly easy way to make some extra cash.\n\nCNBC Select reviewed various resale apps and websites, looking at fees, usability and buyer/seller protections. Our favorites had low fees and an intuitive interface that allows for easy buying and selling (see our methodology). Here are our top five picks if you're looking to sell your belongings online.\n\nBest apps and websites for reselling items\n\nBest for selling everything without fees\n\nFacebook Marketplace\n\nFees\n\nThere are no fees for listing or selling items, but there is a 5% fee (or $0.40 minimum) if you choose to ship an item.\n\nShipping costs\n\nEither the buyer or seller can cover the cost of shipping; Facebook charges a 5% fee (or $0.40 minimum) for shipping items, which can be paid by the buyer or the seller.\n\nAvailability\n\nThere's a web version of marketplace on Facebook.com. You can also use marketplace through the Facebook app, which is available in both the App Store (for iOS) and on Google Play (for Android).\n\nHow do you get paid?\n\nIf you're using shipping as the delivery method, you'll need to enter your bank account information in order to get paid. After you've marked an item as shipped, it will take a few days for you to see the money in your bank account. If you're doing delivery in-person, you and the buyer can determine the payment method, such as cash, Venmo, etc.\n\nPros\n\nNo commission or payment processing fees\n\nSince most people shop on marketplace based on region, you often won't have to deal with shipping\n\nYou can easily post listings if you already have a Facebook account\n\nCons\n\nThere's a fee for shipping items\n\nYour items will likely only be viewed by people in your surrounding area, so it could be harder to find buyers depending on where you're located\n\nWho's this for? Facebook Marketplace is available to anyone with a Facebook account. It's a popular platform for selling items in person, and there's also a shipping option — but it isn't free.\n\nPosting an item is simple. You start by inputting some basic information about the item you're selling, including its category, the item's condition, the price and a brief description. You can upload up to 10 photos of your item, as well as a video. You'll then share your location and will have the option of either local pickup, dropoff or shipping — which can be paid by either the seller or buyer. Lastly, you can post the listing to the marketplace and any Facebook groups for buying and selling that you're in. This can make your post more visible to people you think might be interested in it.\n\nCNBC Select chose Facebook Marketplace as the best platform for selling anything because there are no fees associated with using it (besides a 5% fee or 40 cents minimum for shipping), and you can essentially post any item you want.\n\nBest for selling handmade and vintage items\n\nEtsy\n\nFees\n\nThere's a free version of Etsy and a Plus Plan that costs $10 a month. Free users have to pay a listing fee of $0.20 per item. Plus Plan users get 15 monthly listing credits. There's also a transaction fee of 6.5% per item. For US sellers, there's a payment processing fee of 3% plus $0.25.\n\nIf you're selling an item in-person and accepting an in-person form of payment, you'll need a Square card reader and will pay a 2.6% fee plus 10%.\n\nShipping Costs\n\nThe cost of a shipping label depends on the origin, destination, weight, mail class, package type and dimensions of the package.\n\nWhat devices is it available on?\n\nEtsy is available on the web and as an app through the Apple Store or Google Play Store.\n\nPros\n\nThere are millions of potential buyers looking for handmade and vintage items on the platform\n\nYou can use it for in-person deliveries or orders\n\nCons\n\nThere are multiple fees and the fee structure can be hard to understand\n\nYou have to pay a listing fee even if your item doesn't sell\n\nWho's this for? Etsy was first founded in 2005 as a platform for selling vintage items, craft supplies and handmade goods. There are countless types of items listed on the platform, and you can sell anything from art prints to crochet patterns to vintage engagement rings. Etsy is a great option for people who have art designs, handmade or vintage items they want to sell.\n\nHowever, there are a number of fees that Etsy sellers incur: a listing fee, a payment processing fee and a shipping fee. While the fees do add up, it's still a more affordable option than many other platforms.\n\nCreating an Etsy Standard account is free but if you want perks like listing credits, shop customization and custom web address discounts, an Etsy Plus account is $10 a month.\n\nIn order to start selling on Etsy, you need to create a name for your shop before you make your first listing. You'll then upload photos of the item and/or a short silent video. After that, you'll be prompted to enter information about the listing such as who made the item, what type of item it is, when the item was made (if it's vintage), a short description, the price and tags. You can also set up your listing to renew automatically. You'll then set up shipping and choose if you want to include the item in an ad campaign (if you're running any).\n\nBest for selling clothing\n\nDepop\n\nFees\n\nDepop collects a 10% fee for each item sold on the platform. On top of that, for U.S. sellers, the standard transaction fee for Depop Payments is 3.3% + $0.45, and the standard Paypal fee is 3.49% + $0.49.\n\nShipping costs\n\nEither the buyer or seller can cover the cost of shipping for shipping labels generated by Depop — costs depend on the weight and dimensions of your package. U.S. sellers can also choose to arrange their own shipping\n\nAvailability\n\nThe app is available in both the App Store (for iOS) and on Google Play (for Android); there's also a web version, but the app is more functional.\n\nHow do you get paid?\n\nYou'll need a PayPal account in order to get paid. However, there are two options for sellers on Depop: Getting paid directly through your PayPal, which is linked to your Depop account, or through Depop Payments. If your shop uses Depop payments, you'll be paid directly to your bank account.\n\nPros\n\nYou only have to pay fees when you sell an item (no listing fees)\n\nYou can post the listings and manage your shop all from your phone\n\nCons\n\nDepop takes a higher commission fee (10%) than some other resell platforms\n\nYou can't use it for in-person deliveries or orders\n\nWho's this for? Depop is a resale fashion marketplace founded in 2011. There are approximately 30 million active users on the platform. While it's most commonly known as a clothing resale platform, you can also find art, home decor and books on the app, too.\n\nIf you're looking to sell trendy clothing items, Depop is a great place to list them — and creating an account is free.\n\nIn order to set up a Depop account, you'll need a Paypal account so you can get paid. After connecting your Paypal to your Depop account you'll be able to publish listings. You can post up to four photos and a video of an item. You'll fill out a short description of the item, categorize it, price it and tag it by color and style. Lastly, you'll decide if you want to charge the buyer for shipping or pay for it yourself. If you choose to provide free shipping, make sure to build that into the cost of your item.\n\nSellers have to pay a 10% commission fee and a payment processing fee, and they have the option of paying for shipping.\n\nBest for selling home goods\n\nMercari\n\nFees\n\nSellers pay a 10% fee for each item that's sold. There's also a payment processing fee of 2.9% plus $0.50. There's also a $2 fee for each direct deposit transfer under the minimum of $10 or a deposit rejected by the financial institution. Each Instant Pay transfer is $3.\n\nShipping costs\n\nEither the buyer or seller can cover the cost of shipping; shipping labels are generated by Mercari and costs depend on the weight and dimensions of your package.\n\nAvailability\n\nMercari has an app that's available in both the App Store (for iOS) and on Google Play (for Android), and you can also list and shop via its website.\n\nHow do you get paid?\n\nAfter the transaction has been completed, the payment will show up on your Mercari balance. You can either have the money directly deposited into your bank account.\n\nPros\n\nYou only have to pay fees when you sell an item (no listing fees)\n\nPeople who want to sell items locally can use Mercari Local\n\nYou can post the listings and manage your shop all from your phone\n\nCons\n\nMercari take a higher commission fee (10%) than some other resale platforms\n\nThere's a $2 if your direct deposit is less than $10\n\nWho's this for? Mercari is a Japanese e-commerce and resale platform founded in 2013. On Mercari, users can sell anything from clothing to skincare to headphones.\n\nMercari is unique among many of the resale platforms, as it offers a service known as Mercari Local, where drivers pick up the order and deliver it to the buyer's address. With Mercari Local, buyers pay the delivery fee.\n\nFor the seller, the fees for using Mercari Local are the same as using regular Mercari, and you have the added convenience of not having to physically ship your items and the safety of not having to meet up with a stranger.\n\nIn order to start selling on Mercari, you'll need to write a short description, categorize your item, and provide information about the brand, condition and price of the item. You can upload up to 12 photos. Lastly, you can choose if you want to do Mercari Local for delivery and/or Mercari shipping. With Mercari shipping, sellers have the option of paying for shipping or having buyers cover the cost.\n\nThe fees for Mercari are quite reasonable: There's a 10% commission fee and a 3% payment processing fee for every sale.\n\nBest for selling specialized goods\n\neBay\n\nFees\n\nWith eBay, sellers pay a few different fees: an insertion fee (when you list an item) and a final value fee. You can list up 250 items before paying an insertion fee, but you'll be charged multiple insertion fees if you list in multiple categories. The final value fee is a percentage of the cost of the item plus $0.30, and it varies based on the type of item but typically no more than 15% of the sale price. There are no payment-processing fees.\n\nShipping costs\n\nSellers can pay for shipping or have buyers pay for shipping; eBay will provide shipping labels and costs depend on the weight and dimensions of the package. You can also arrange local pick-up.\n\nWhat devices is it available on?\n\nEbay is available on the web and the app is available in both the App Store (for iOS) and on Google Play (for Android).\n\nHow do you get paid?\n\nWith eBay, your payouts get directly deposited into your bank account. Buyers can use a range of payment methods, including credit or debit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal and PayPal Credit.\n\nPros\n\nEbay has over 130 million buyers, so you have the potential to reach far more people on this platform than on others\n\nYou can either auction an item or have buyers pay a fixed-price for an item\n\nYou can use it for in-person deliveries or orders\n\nCons\n\nYou have to pay the listing fee even if you don't end up selling the item\n\nThe cost to list an item depends on the category, and there are random fees that serious sellers should be aware of like a $20 dispute fee.\n\nWho's this for? eBay was first founded in 1995 as a platform for auctioning items. Since then, eBay has evolved into a multi-billion-dollar company that people use to sell everything from collector baseball cards to used cars. While the auction option on eBay still exists, sellers now have the ability to directly sell their items to buyers.\n\nWhen you post a listing on eBay, you'll provide up to 24 photos of the item, add specific details, write a description and choose whether to auction off the item or have buyers purchase it immediately. Lastly, you'll choose whether you want to ship the item (you can pay for shipping or have the buyer pay for it) or have it available for local pick-up.\n\nOne major perk of using eBay is that its fees are low and easy to understand. There are two types of fees: the listing fee and the final value fee. The final value fee on eBay depends on the type of item you're selling but it's usually not higher than 15%, making it a good option for anyone looking to sell off any collector, vintage or niche goods.\n\nBest for selling luxury clothing\n\nPoshmark\n\nFees\n\nFor sales under $15, the fee is a flat rate of $2.95. For sales above $15, the fee is 20%. These are charged only if the item is sold. There are also potential fees for payout, including a $2 fee for an instant transfer and a $0.35 fee when sending money to a PayPal or Venmo account.\n\nShipping costs\n\nThe buyer pays a $7.97 shipping fee on all orders.\n\nWhat devices is it available on?\n\nPoshmark is available on the web and the app is available in both the App Store (for iOS) and on Google Play (for Android).\n\nHow do you get paid?\n\nWithin 3 days of delivery, the seller can withdraw the money via Instant Transfer, PayPal, Venmo, direct deposit to their bank account or request a check.\n\nPros\n\nPoshmark had nearly 8 million active buyers as of 2022, making it a popular fashion marketplace\n\nSellers don't pay for shipping\n\nThere are few fees, and they're low and straightforward\n\nThere's no listing fee, and sellers only pay when the item is sold\n\nCons\n\nThe shipping fee for buyers is rather high and there's only one shipping option\n\nPoshmark is rather a niche platform, designed to sell secondhand clothes and other fashion items\n\nWho's this for? Poshmark, a social marketplace for secondhand fashion items, was founded in 2011 and now has over 80 million users. It's known as a platform for reselling women's clothing and accessories, especially those in a higher price range.\n\nIf you have a pair of Jimmy Choo heels or a Chanel bag to sell, Poshmark can be a great choice. Besides women's fashion, you'll also find categories for men, kids, home decor and more. Listing an item is easy and free: add a photo (or several), fill in the information such as size, price and description, and you're ready to list. You'll only pay a fee once the item is sold — $2.95 for sales under $15 or 20% of your sale if it's $15 or more. You also don't pay shipping fees since they're the buyer's responsibility.\n\nPoshmark offers multiple options for paying sellers. Free payment methods include a direct deposit to your bank account or a check. Alternatively, you can get the money through PayPal or Venmo for $0.35 or get an instant transfer for $2.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!\n\nMoney matters — so make the most of it.

But the commission rates vary dramatically.\n\nSome of these platforms do all of the work for you — all you have to do is ship the items to the provider, and you'll collect a commission once they sell them.\n\nIf you're willing to take a smaller cut of the earnings, you can opt for a platform like thredUp or The RealReal. While these platforms take the effort out of reselling, they also take a hefty cut: With thredUp, users earn anywhere from 5% to 80% of the selling price, and with The RealReal, they receive anywhere from 20% to 85% of the selling price.\n\nOther platforms require you to do more of the work. You might have to take photos of the items, make listings, decide the price and ship them to the buyer. But you'll also pay a smaller commission, between 10 and 20%. Most of the apps we reviewed don't take more than 15%. If you're looking to make money from reselling, we recommend you use a platform that requires you to do most of the work.\n\nAre resale apps worth it?\n\nReselling can require some effort, but it can be an excellent way to make a bit of extra cash — and a resale app can be a convenient platform to sell your items.\n\nHow do I find out how much my stuff is worth?\n\nIf your item isn't a collectible or antique, you can look up comparable items using Google or see what other people are listing similar items for on resale apps. However, if you're selling a valuable and rare item, you might want to work with a professional appraiser.\n\nHow do you successfully resell items online?\n\nTo resell items online successfully, make sure you provide a full description, including the item's condition and add as many high-quality photos as you can.\n\nBottom line\n\nSelling items you no longer use, be it a dress you've barely worn or a painting gathering dust in your attic, can be a great way to quickly earn some extra cash. Resale apps allow you to do just that. Before you list your item, compare several marketplaces, what they usually sell and how much they charge in fees, and pick what works best for you.\n\nOur methodology\n\nIn total, CNBC Select analyzed 10 reselling platforms. To determine which are the best, we looked at the types of fees sellers pay, usability and buyer/seller protections.\n\nAll of the platforms we selected offered some type of buyer protection, so if you receive a faulty item or don't receive an item at all, buyers can file a complaint with the platform (after contacting the seller) and will typically be refunded for their purchases.\n\nWe also looked carefully at the various fees these platforms charge, as commissions vary widely. Some platforms charge a fee for every item that a seller lists on the platform (known as a listing fee) on top of commission it takes once an item sells.\n\nMost of the websites we selected did not charge a listing fee, and for those that did, the fee was less than $0.50 an item.\n\nThe commission fee is typically the highest fee. Some platforms charge as much as 95% of the sale price. Most of the platforms we recommended charged a commission fee but none charged more than 15% on items.\n\nLastly, most platforms charged a payment-processing fee. Payment-processing fees are typically paid to a third-party service for processing payments from customers. A few of the platforms we selected charged a payment processing fee, but it was typically no more than 3% of the item in addition to a few cents.\n\nWhen it came to shipping, all of the platforms that we selected allowed sellers to choose whether or not to pay for shipping or pass the cost onto customers.\n\nWe also looked considered the usability of each platform, looking at how easy it is to upload an item to sell and promote it so you can make sales quickly.\n\nCatch up on CNBC Select's in-depth coverage of credit cards, banking and money, and follow us on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to stay up to date."
