        "text": "How do you win new customers?\n\nEvery business claims that it’s in the quality of the product or service they deliver.\n\nWhile that might have been true two-three years ago, it’s no longer the reason why customers choose to do business with a company.\n\nToday, it’s all about providing the best customer experience.\n\nWe recently asked 1,920 business professionals to share their number one priority for the next 5 years.\n\nThe results?\n\nCustomer experience (or CX) came in first - beating product and pricing for the third time in a row.\n\nTruthfully, it’s no surprise that customer experience is the number one priority.\n\nThe Temkin Group found that companies that earn $1 billion annually can expect to earn, on average, an additional $700 million within 3 years of investing in customer experience.\n\nFor SaaS companies in particular, they can expect to increase revenue by $1 billion.\n\nThat's right.\n\nInvesting in CX initiatives has the potential to double your revenue.\n\nSo, where is this revenue growth coming from?\n\nA good customer experience leads to your customers spending more.\n\nIn fact, 86% of buyers are willing to pay more for a great customer experience.\n\nAnd according to a research from PWC, the more expensive the item, the more they are willing to pay.\n\nFor example, customers are willing to pay a price premium of up to 13% (and as high as 18%) for luxury and indulgence services, simply by receiving a great customer experience.\n\nCX also influences on-the-spot purchasing, too - as 49% of buyers have made impulse purchases after receiving a more personalized experience.\n\nBut the most convincing reason why CX has become so important is this:\n\n81% of organizations already cite CX as a competitive differentiator.\n\nIf CX is to play an important role in your 2024 plans, use this article to stay ahead of the top customer experience statistics and trends in the upcoming year.\n\nAt SuperOffice, we've helped thousands of companies use B2B sales, B2B marketing and customer service to improve the customer experience.\n\nThis gives us access to data and insight into how consumers feel about the experience they receive - which we'll be sharing in this report.\n\nUnlike other lists, these CX stats are completely up to date.\n\nWhat is customer experience?\n\nCustomer experience is your customers’ perception of how your company treats them. These perceptions affect their behaviors, and build memories and feelings to drive their loyalty.\n\nIn other words – if they like you and continue to like you, they are going to do business with you for a long time and recommend you to others.\n\nBut, in order for your customers to like you, you need to get to know them. You need to invest in the long-term relationship (also known as relationship marketing), because when you understand who they are, you are able to deliver a personalized experience across the entire customer journey.\n\nAcquiring this in-depth knowledge about customers isn't something that just happens. You need to collect customer data (i.e.Voice of Customer data) and bring out valuable insights from that data with speed and precision.\n\nThe good news is that it doesn't matter what kind of business you're in - improving the experience for your customers has been proven (time and time again) to increase retention, satisfaction and revenue.\n\nSo, what can you do to create a positive customer experience?\n\nLet's take a look at the most important trends.\n\n1. Customer experience is the new battlefield\n\nNo one wants to do business with a company that treats you poorly.\n\nAnd how you feel after an interaction with a customer service center has a huge impact on your future purchase decisions. A good interaction keeps you happy and satisfied, while a poor interaction could lead to you stop doing business with that company again.\n\nIt’s because of these extremes why 88% of companies now prioritize customer experience in their contact centers. Yes, it’s that important.\n\nAnd it’s easy to see why. If a customer is choosing to do business based on CX, then that’s where you have to stand out!\n\nIn fact, more than two-thirds of companies now compete primarily on the basis of customer experience – up from only 36% in 2010!\n\nTherefore, if you want your customers to have a positive experience, you have to invest in it.\n\nIt makes sense, right?\n\nThe sad news is that less than half of all organizations will be investing in the customer experience next year.\n\nIn fact, our own research found that only 44% will increase the investment in their CX initiatives.\n\nBut if you are investing in CX, where do you begin?\n\nAccording to Gartner’s research, companies that successfully implement customer experience projects begin by focusing on how they collect and analyze customer feedback.\n\nWhether you use surveys, web forms, or Net Promoter Score (NPS) programs, read through their comments, suggestions and opinions to see what they expect from you. Then, invest in those projects to meet their expectations.\n\n2. Omnichannel customer service will increase\n\nA customer contacts you on the platform of their choice.\n\nAnd unlike the 90s, when there was only telephone (or fax, remember those?), today’s customers are active in dozens!\n\nIn turn, companies are forced to interact with their customers across multiple channels, through forms on their website, live chat, social media and more.\n\nHowever, while customers may be positive and accept different service levels from different channels, they also expect that the communication remains consistent. This is known as omnichannel.\n\nHow do you provide a consistent experience across all channels, both online and offline?\n\nA great example of a company that does this well is IKEA.\n\nIf you visit any IKEA store around the world, you will get the same consistent experience. IKEA invests heavily into customer experience.\n\nThey've opened more stores, invested in their home delivery network and launched a brand new app - all to the benefit of their customer.\n\nAnd the pay off has been huge!\n\nNot only is IKEA one of the most beloved companies in the world, but their annual revenues have now reached more than $40 billion worldwide.\n\nAnd it’s this level of execution and result that is driving more companies to invest in the omnichannel experience.\n\nIn fact, in a retailing report, PWC found that the number of companies investing in the omni-channel experience has jumped from 20% to more than 80%.\n\nAdding to this, Adobe recently found that companies with the strongest omni-channel customer engagement strategies enjoy a 10% Y-O-Y growth, a 10% increase in average order value and a 25% increase in close rates.\n\n3. Mobile customer experience is priority\n\nA poor mobile experience can do serious damage to your brand.\n\nFor example, 57% of customers won’t recommend a business with a poorly designed website on mobile. And if a website isn’t mobile-friendly, 50% of customers will stop visiting it, even if they like the business.\n\nBy not providing a positive mobile experience, you’re putting business growth in jeopardy, as the graphic below shows.\n\nIt’s no longer the question whether the mobile experience is important or not.\n\nToday, it's considered a best practice for great customer experiences.\n\nAccording to Statista, 59% of all internet traffic worldwide now comes from mobile.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise why 84% of companies who claim to be customer-centric are now focusing on the mobile customer experience.\n\nIf you are using a CMS platform like WordPress or HubSpot, there are tools to help with mobile optimization like spacing, text size, and more.\n\nHowever, for companies that aren’t, they’ve been slow to adapt to this trend – especially when it comes to customer support – as an overwhelming 90% of customers report having a poor experience when seeking customer support on mobile devices.\n\nThe most common customer complaints are navigation, site search and load times.\n\nThere is a huge gap that needs to be taken seriously.\n\nIf your customers cannot navigate your website with ease and find what they are looking for, then you frustrate them. And you lose them.\n\n4. Customer frustration will lead to churn\n\nAccording to Esteban Kolsky, 72% of customers will share a positive experience with 6 or more people. On the other hand, if a customer is not happy, 13% of them will share their experience with 15 or even more.\n\nThe CX challenge here lies in the fact that, in most cases, customers don’t tell you they’re unhappy. In fact, only 1 in 26 unhappy customers actually complain.\n\nThe rest? They just stop doing business with you.\n\nFor many companies, the absence of negative feedback is a sign of satisfaction.\n\nBut as the research shows, that's not the case. Your customers may not be happy, or worse, they’re sharing their bad experiences with others.\n\nCustomer expectations are at an all-time high and it’s a tough time for companies to meet and exceed them.\n\nEven if you provide a positive customer experience 9 out of 10 times, that one time you do not could be fatal.\n\nIn their future of CX report, PwC surveyed 15,000 consumers and found that 1 in 3 customers will leave a brand they love after just one bad experience, while 92% would completely abandon a company after two or three negative interactions.\n\nWhat accounts for a bad experience?\n\nSometimes, it’s as simple as poor follow-up.\n\nOur own research found that very few companies follow up with their customers. Put simply, you can avoid many of these poor experiences by sending a follow-up email.\n\n5. Self-service help will be the first choice\n\nIn 2024, companies should ensure that customers are able to find answers to their questions using a wide-range of self-service options.\n\nToday, 67% of customers prefer self-service over speaking to a company representative.\n\nFurthermore, 91% of customers would use an online knowledge base, if it were available and tailored to their needs.\n\nCustomers are willing to find the answers themselves. So much so, that by 2030, Gartner estimates that a billion service tickets will be raised automatically by customer-owned bots.\n\nTo handle this demand, companies are turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nThree years ago, 25% of all customer interactions were automated through AI and machine learning. Today, this number has reached 40% (and continues to grow).\n\nIn the short-term, you need to make sure that when a customer has a problem, the right tools are available to them, so they can solve it, themselves.\n\nIn the long-term, you need to think about how AI and technology can help you improve customer experience.\n\n6. Customers demand immediate attention\n\nThe most important factor in the customer experience?\n\nFast response times.\n\nYet, the average response time for customer service emails is 12 hours.\n\nClearly, there’s a disconnect. The longer it takes for a business to reply, the less likely it is that the customer will engage. If this happens regularly, then your customer will stop trying to contact you. Eventually, they’ll leave.\n\nAre customers more demanding than ever before?\n\nMaybe. But they deserve to be. Without them, you have no business!\n\nUnless you’re Ryanair, most companies cannot afford to deliver poor customer service and still be profitable.They are the exception, not the rule.\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nWhen it comes to the customer experience, your customers don’t care about how great your product or service is. All they care about is that if they have a problem, you are there to help them. And quickly.\n\n7. Anticipate customer’s needs\n\nIt’s one thing to respond quickly.\n\nIt’s another thing altogether to communicate with customers before they need to contact you. That’s where the art of being proactive comes in.\n\nMost companies provide reactive support. They wait until a customer contacts them and then they respond.\n\nProactive support is about solving customer issues before they become problems.\n\nEssentially, you’re putting out fires before the match has been lit.\n\nHere's how it differs to reactive customer service.\n\nCustomers want companies to be proactive, too.\n\nMore than 85% of customers want to experience proactive communication and contact from a business.\n\nBeing able to offer a solution before a customer voices their concern or, better, before they even realize they have a problem is the best way to win a customer’s loyalty.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith 9 out of 10 businesses competing on customer experience, it’s the organizations that take customer experience seriously that will stand out from the noise and win loyal customers over.\n\nOne thing is for sure; in order to deliver a positive experience, you have to know your customers better than ever before.\n\nThis means creating complete customer profiles that help you understand and measure the customer experience at every touch point, and across multiple channels.\n\nOne way to handle this is by using a CRM.\n\nOnce you know your customers well enough, you can use that knowledge to personalize every interaction. Customers these days have more power and choices than ever before. Thus, you are responsible for understanding and acknowledging their needs.\n\nIf you make sure their interaction with your company is smooth, pleasant and continuously improving, you will drive brand loyalty. If not, you’ll give your competitors the best gift you can – your customers."
