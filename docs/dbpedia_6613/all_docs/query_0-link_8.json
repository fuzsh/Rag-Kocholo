        "text": "The search tool shows:\n\nlevels of young participation (POLAR4, TUNDRA MSOA and TUNDRA LSOA)\n\nhigher education qualifications among adults (Adult HE 2011)\n\nAll measures classify areas into five groups (quintiles):\n\nquintile one shows the lowest rates\n\nquintile five shows the highest rates.\n\nGeographic boundaries\n\nPostcode pins are shown within geographic boundaries because we assign quintiles to boundaries rather than specific postcodes. This means all postcodes within the same geographic boundary will have the same quintile.\n\nThe measures are produced using different boundaries. Selecting the different measures on the detailed results page will change the outlined geographic boundary depending on which measure you are interested in:\n\nPOLAR4 and Adult HE 2011 were produced using Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) in England and Wales, Intermediate Zones (IZs) in Scotland and Super Output Areas (SOAs) in Northern Ireland.\n\nTUNDRA MSOA was produced using MSOAs as it covers England only.\n\nTUNDRA LSOA was produced using Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOAs) and covers England.\n\nFind out more about our latest changes to the postcode look-up (September 2023).\n\nPostcodes are subject to copyright. Find out more about postcode copyright on the Office for National Statistics website.\n\nThis look-up includes Northern Ireland postcodes from the Central Postcode Directory which are the intellectual property of Land & Property Services (Land & Property Services © Crown Copyright Licence No. DO 7390 - 2022).
