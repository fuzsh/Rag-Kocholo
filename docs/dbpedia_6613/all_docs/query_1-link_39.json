        "text": "The S&P Global Media and Stakeholder Analysis (MSA) forms an integral part of the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA). It enables S&P Global to monitor a company's sustainability performance on an ongoing basis by assessing current controversies with potentially negative reputational or financial impacts. The main objective of the MSA process is to gain insight into a company’s ability to mitigate financially material and reputational risks, as well as impacts on stakeholders and the environment, while protecting their shareholder value.\n\nAn MSA case typically exposes a failure at a company’s management level and gaps in systems and processes, such as risk management systems and operational controls. Consequently, a company’s S&P Global ESG Score may be adjusted. This has no impact on ESG Raw Data.\n\nCovering over 13,000 companies globally, the CSA is an annual evaluation of a company’s sustainability practices. It enables benchmarking on a wide range of industry-specific economic, environmental, and social criteria that are relevant to the growing number of sustainability-focused investors and are expected to be financially relevant to corporate success.\n\nThe CSA delivers unparalleled insight into corporate sustainability practices, drawing on more than 25 years of engagement with thousands of companies each year. It goes far deeper than simply determining how transparent companies are by also uncovering how they manage the ESG risks and opportunities, including those new and underreported topics of growing importance that have yet to reach the disclosure agenda.\n\nLearn More About the CSA"
