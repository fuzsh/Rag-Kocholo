        "text": "As stated in the Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 on the EU Ecolabel, EU Ecolabel criteria are based on the best products available on the EEA market in terms of environmental performance throughout the life cycle and correspond indicatively to the best 10- 20 % of the products available on the EEA market in terms of environmental performance at the moment of their adoption. The criteria are based on scientific data and information considering the whole life cycle of products. They cover the main environmental impacts of the product and their technical performance, including health, safety, social and ethical aspects, where appropriate. The criteria favour substitution of hazardous substances with safer ones and support durability, reusability, recyclability and recycled content of products. They include fitness for use requirements and guarantee compliance with existing EU legislation. The EU Ecolabel criteria are regularly revised to follow the technological evolution and are adopted as Commission Decisions. An overview of the existing product and service groups and the associated criteria can be found on the Product Groups and Criteria website.\n\nEU Ecolabel criteria development/revision is a multi-step and multi-stakeholder process carried out according to the Annex I of the EU Ecolabel Regulation.\n\nFollowing consultation of the EUEB, the Commission, Member States, competent bodies and other stakeholders may initiate and lead the development or revision of EU Ecolabel criteria.\n\nThe party which initiates and leads the development or revision of EU Ecolabel criteria produces various necessary documents, including a proposal for draft criteria, a technical report in support of the proposal, a preliminary report, a final report, a manual for potential users of the EU Ecolabel and Competent Bodies as well as a manual for authorities awarding public contracts. Those are submitted to the Commission and to the European Union Ecolabelling Board (EUEB).\n\nWhere criteria have already been developed under another ecolabel scheme complying with the requirements of EN ISO 14024 Type 1 environmental labels for a product group for which no EU Ecolabel criteria have been established, a shortened criteria development procedure may apply. Please consult the section Criteria Development and Revision for more information.\n\nA license represents an EU Ecolabel contract between the competent body and the license holder, covering one or several awarded products from the same product group category. The applicant, after being awarded, becomes a license holder. A license number has the following form: XX/YYY/ZZZ (where XX refers to the country of registration, YYY to the product group, ZZZ to the number assigned from the competent body to the applicant). If a license holder submits a new application for the same product group (=extension of the license), the same license number is issued.\n\nThe European Commission and competent bodies are committed to limiting animal testing. This commitment has been the subject of an inscription in Article 6 of the EU Ecolabel Regulation, mentioning that the criteria development process will try to include ‘as far as possible the principle of reducing animal testing’. This provision has been integrated for the first time in the EU Ecolabel criteria for “animal care products” adopted in 2021.\n\nProduct group criteria are usually valid for a period of three to five years, depending on the Commission decision for each product group. By being revised on a regular basis, criteria reflect technical innovation, such as evolution of materials or production processes, emission reductions and changes in the market. The criteria are reviewed prior to their expiration and may be revised or their validity prolonged. If criteria are revised, license holders need to renew their contract. If criteria validity is prolonged, the contract is automatically renewed as long as the criteria remain valid for a product or service. Licence holders may use the EU Ecolabel starting from the date it is awarded until the end of the period of the validity of the criteria.\n\nNew EU Ecolabel product groups are constantly being identified and criteria developed for them. The prioritisation of the development of new criteria is set out in the Strategic EU Ecolabel Work Plan 2020 - 2024. In principle, any interested stakeholder can submit a proposal for a new product group if they want a product to be included in the EU Ecolabel scheme. However, considering the priorities identified in the Strategic EU Ecolabel Workplan, please note that no request for development of criteria for new product groups can be considered in 2024."
