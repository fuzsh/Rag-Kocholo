        "text": "We host an annual fundraiser called Month of Giving. What generates the most excitement is a fundraising competition between local chapters of Metallica’s fan club. We use Keepthescore.com to provide daily updates and incentivize participating chapters to continue raising money. The tool is straightforward, easy to customize, and has become an invaluable part of our campaign. The customer service is among the best we’ve come across.\n\nAll Within My Hands\n\nNon-Profit Organization Founded By Metallica\n\nI’m really impressed with Keepthescore.com leaderboards! It has allowed us to easily add a fun and competitive element to our fundraising events. It is also super simple to integrate the leaderboards onto our existing website, and to update them whenever we need to.\n\nSteven Carney\n\nDigital Fundraising Manager, Walton Center Charity, UK\n\nWe used Keepthescore.com for a Hang Challenge at my company for fundraising. We loved how easy andsmooth it was to use it, and the live updates were a big WOW! Also, being able to update the company logo and each player’s profile picture gave it a personal touch and encouraged more participants. Keep up the good work!\n\nMark Massoud\n\nEvent Organizer, Montreal, Canada\n\nWe use Keepthescore.com to update our livestream through OBS and it is FLAWLESS. I chose it because it was the easiest to incorporate into OBS and easiest to update. No installation needed, just adding a simple weblink and you’re up and running!\n\nJohn\n\nAnnouncer for football games Clarendon, AR, USA\n\nWe use Keepthescore.com to keep track of class points throughout the year. Classes can earn points for a variety of activities/behaviors. The class with the most points receives a pizza party. The kids enjoy the friendly competition and it motivates them to make good choices. Thanks for providing a fun, easy way to track and display points!\n\nAshley Ford\n\nChurch coordinator, Truth Quest @ Christian Family Chapel, Jacksonville, FL, USA\n\nI use Keepthescore.com for an online Twitch event twice a year with roughly 300 players and it never lets me down! Scores are super easy to add or remove, the designs are very clean and other features such as adding images and easily being able to share a public link is what made me a loyal user of Keepthescore.com, truly nothing does it better!\n\nMircea\n\nEvent Organiser, USA\n\nThe scoreboard works amazingly well with OBS. Our scorekeeper has been very happy with how simple it is to operate and keep track. We have the output ran to a large TV and the audience is able to easily see the team names and score throughout our game.\n\nTessa E.\n\nRoller Derby Streamer, Texas, USA\n\nI am SUCH a fan of Keepthescore.com! I use it to keep the real-time participation score for my students in my Spanish classes. I found it back when we had the COVID-19 restrictions in classrooms. I went back to using Keepthescore.com with my classes last year, and they loved it! It was VERY motivational.\n\nStephanie\n\nSpanish Teacher, A high school in West Virginia, USA\n\nKPPj8 is using Keepthescore.com to rank members club and participated players based on their ping pong playing performance calculated by KPPj8's Modified ELO Rating Points System. Keepthescore.com is easy to manage and perfectly to showcase players' ranking in style with photos.\n\nAidi Azhar\n\nSecretary, KPPj8 Sports, Putrajaya, Malaysia.\n\nWe held a 'Game Night' for a very large meeting of our membership, and Keepthescore's leaderboard was a perfect solution to help us keep track of points. I loved that it was customizable with colors and images. We will definitely use this product again.\n\nCass\n\nEducator, a union in Washington, USA\n\nWe are very happy that we found keepthescore.com. As a recreational Baseball & Softball Team we were looking for an affordable digital Scoreboard for our games. The digital board makes it so much easier for our spectators and players to keep track of the action on the field.\n\nKay\n\nBottrop Blackjacks Baseball & Softball Team from Germany"
