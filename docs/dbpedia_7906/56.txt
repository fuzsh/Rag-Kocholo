James Blunt (birth name: James Hilier Blount) is an English singer-songwriter, record producer and a former reconnaissance officer of the British Army, known for his biggest hit "You're Beautiful".

Not Beautiful Qualities

His singing voice is whiny, ear-piercing and aggravating.

He made the infamous song "You're Beautiful", which is considered by some critics as one of the most annoying songs of all time (it even appeared on Wikipedia's "List of music considered the worst"), as it literally promotes stalking, which is a reprehensible behavior.

His songs lack any emotion, which makes them feel awkward.

His production is awful.

His lyrics are simple and sound like a toddler wrote them (ex "You're beautiful, it's true" from his song "You're Beautiful").

Beautiful Qualities

At least he is a really nice guy who takes criticism well and can be pretty aware that a certain song is "bad" and/or "irritating", as proven when he once admitted that his biggest hit "You're Beautiful" is "kind of miserable", and even apologized for said song being played way too many times to the point that it was being shoved in everyone's faces.

He has improved a bit with his newer songs, as they have better singing, production and music videos.
