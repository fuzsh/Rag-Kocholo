        "text": "‘Oud Wanderings’ will see two old friends travel between quiet spots across the UK, offering a\n\nconcert of solo oud compositions by Abderraouf Ouertani, narrated by Susannah Knights. Over the\n\ncourse of an hour, Ouertani’s compositions – some of which were composed recently, and others\n\nmany years ago – will here be brought together and interspersed with stories of a long journey\n\nthat he undertook between Istanbul and India. Together, we explore themes of spirituality, senses\n\nof home, and journeying.\n\nAbderraouf’s compositions bring together diverse musical languages that he has developed\n\nbetween Tunisia, France, and beyond. He has written and recorded four albums for oud, each\n\nrecorded in collaboration with different instrumental configurations – from jazz quartet to organ.\n\nAs well as composing for oud, Abderraouf also has a new Arab Indie Rock project, Kohhen El Kef,\n\nwhich features rock compositions sung in Tunisian dialect, and undertakes research in\n\nanthropology of music.\n\nIndeed, Abderraouf and Susannah met as anthropology students at the EHESS, Paris, and\n\nAbderraouf and his family supported Susannah throughout her own research on music industries\n\nand recording archives in Tunisia. This UK tour marks a special opportunity for Susannah to return\n\nthe hospitality and to invite Abderraouf to the places where she grew up, rediscovering the UK\n\nthrough their journey!\n\nJoin us for a workshop during which participants will be introduced to some staple rhythms and\n\nmodes of maqam-based music. We will use our hands and voices to explore key rhythms and\n\nscales that underpin repertoires common across the Arab and Turkish worlds. By the end we will\n\nbe bringing all of the elements together in a song!\n\nNo materials or previous experience of maqam-based music will be necessary – we will be using\n\nour hands, feet and voices! Instruments are welcome for those who would like to follow the\n\nworkshop on their instruments.\n\nAbderraouf Ouertani’s career is above all a story about curiosity and meeting. It began with the\n\ndiscovery of the oud in Tunisia at the age of 13. Prematurely, he left the conservatoire. &#39;The oud is\n\ndead, Long live the oud!&#39; In search of new horizons, he moved to Paris in 2008 where he completed a\n\nPhD in Anthropology of Music at Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales.\n\nHe has released four albums of compositions for oud, each recorded in collaboration with different\n\ninstrumental configurations. &#39;Contes d&#39;un misérable luth&#39;, released in 2013, features compositions\n\nfor oud with percussionist Mohammed Amine Jebali. &#39;Contes outre-méditerranéens&#39;, released in\n\n2015, featured a quartet including Chilean double-bass player Patricio Lisboa, French saxophonist\n\nBenoît Meynier and Palestinian percussionist Yousef Zayed.\n\nAfter discovering a Caviller-Coll organ in the little church of his neighbourhood in Paris, he decided\n\nto compose for an oud-organ duo, in a collaboration with his Jazz tutor Patrick Villanueva. This led to\n\na third album in 2018, &#39;Duo Deux Rives&#39;. For his fourth album, he opted to keep the duo formula.\n\n&#39;Tales of a return to the imaginary country&#39;, released in 2021, was recorded with Korean piano player\n\nDaum Jung.\n\nHe has a new Arab Indie Rock project, Kohhen El Kef, which features rock compositions sung in\n\nTunisian dialect. Musically, it is inspired by British Indie Rock, particularly Radiohead. This UK tour\n\nwill thus be a both a discovery and a return to one of his many musical homelands!\n\nSusannah Knights grew up surrounded by Western classical music in the UK, but was taken by her\n\nown curiosity to live in Tunis in 2012, where she became interested in alternative Tunisian music\n\nscenes. She explored this interest through a Master’s in Anthropology at the Ecole des Hautes\n\nEtudes en Sciences Sociales, where she met Abderraouf, becoming one of his students in the oud.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2023 she studied for a PhD in ethnomusicology at King’s College London. She\n\ncontinued to carry out fieldwork in Tunis, where she explored sound archives and recording\n\nindustries. Throughout this journey she was supported by the whole Ouertani family. This UK tour\n\nmarks a special opportunity for Susannah to return the hospitality and to invite Abderraouf to the\n\nplaces where she grew up, rediscovering the UK through their journey!\n\n“Merging pop aspects with indie tropes, he’s able to craft something complex and dynamic, yet also wide open, songs that fans can absorb into their own lives.” - Robin Murray (CLASH Magazine)\n\n“Enchanting” – Matthew Kent (Line of Best Fit)\n\n“Back with a bang” – Paige Sims (EARMILK)\n\n“Raw artistry and emotion dripping from every last track” – Kieran (CLOUT)\n\n“Packed with punch” Emily Pilbeam (BBC Introducing, 6 Music, Radio 1)\n\nTickets HERE\n\n“Amazing! Excited to see what’s next” – Shell Zenner (Amazing Radio)\n\n“Deserves a superstar does Wakefield, and here it is”– Jon McClure (Reverend and the Makers)\n\nWhen British singer-songwriter OLIVER PINDERunleashed his first single STRESSED in October 2022, after an artistic hiatus, the 22-year-old could not predict the wave of appraisal that followed the release. Starting his artistic journey afresh by adopting a new creative approach, his sound has since transformed from its dark, indie-folk roots into an eclectic mix of guitar-driven alternative pop anthems and heartfelt piano ballads. Encompassing the earnest lyricism of artists Matilda Mann and Jeremy Zucker, as well as the glitchy synth- wave instrumental layers akin to that of The Japanese House and Holly Humberstone, Pinder’s music captures the anxieties of today’s younger generation.\n\nGrowing up in the West Yorkshire city of Bradford, Pinder began to utilise the process of writing music as an emotional outlet at the age of eight, after receiving his first guitar costing just short of ten pounds. As his parents fostered his musical passion, this beloved instrument would accompany Pinder on family holidays to Kirkcudbright in Scotland, alongside a soundtrack consisting of Neil Diamond, Don Mclean, and Meatloaf. The passing of Pinder’s father, when the young musician was 12 years old, fuelled his determination to pursue a career in music and make his late parent proud. By his mid-teens Pinder had attracted attention from promoters across the nation eager to offer him support slots for established musicians such as Billie Marten, Embrace, and JP Cooper.\n\nAs of 2023, Pinder recently completed his debut UK tour which included headline shows in Leeds, Manchester, London, Newcastle, and York. This run of shows around the nation allowed the solo artist to expand his line-up, and many of these dates saw Pinder accompanied by a band of established musicians. Joined by bassist/lead-guitarist Morgan Lindley and drummer Harry Stobart, the trio packed venues across the country with crowds eagerly invested in Pinder’s latest EP release Potential, I Guess? Coinciding with the announcement of Pinder’s UK tour in May 2023, this body of work was the first to be published by the indie-pop artist since his hiatus and quickly became a discussion point for national music reviewers and radio-show hosts alike. Pinder’s release also secured him with full-band slots at some of the UK’s most renowned music festivals, such as Barn On The Farm and Long Division.\n\nHaving been featured by the likes of BBC Radio 6 and BBC Introducing, Pinder’s debut EP includes the singles ‘Stressed’, ‘Beautiful Second’, and ‘Late July’, with each release receiving critical acclaim following their publication. Throughout the production process of each song within the collection, Pinder intended to document his creative journey as an artist navigating unknown sonic territory whilst remaining true to his song-writer roots. Focussing on the struggles faced by twentysomethings venturing through adulthood, Potential, I Guess? details the progression of an artist learning to immerse himself in a sound that is uniquely his. Whilst he is known for his captivating ballads brimming with emotional vulnerability, the first single from the record ‘Stressed’ demonstrates all the necessary ingredients to a dance floor-filling pop anthem, utilising electronic ornaments and an infectiously groovy bass line. Furthermore, to maintain excitement among his listeners’, Pinder is unleashing a series of music videos and live sessions to complement each song, with the first instalment being the promotional video for his single ‘Late July’.\n\nFollowing the success of Pinder’s first tour of this year, the Wakefield based artist is already anticipating a further run of headline show dates for early next year around the UK and beyond, as he aspires to expand his audience internationally. Future full-band performances will also feature two new additions to the artist’s explosive line-up, as he introduces keys player/vocalist Hattie Barnes, and guitarist Jacob Clarke. Clarke also played an integral role in Pinder’s journey, as the producer behind the artist’s latest releases. With a second prospective tour planned, Pinder is already working towards his sophomore EP which sees his sound develop into much heavier realms than his debut record, proving that he is not just a one-trick pony. With a widely celebrated first EP and selection of sell-out shows in some of the UK’s most notorious grass-roots venues under his belt, the future appears promising for indie and alternative pop’s future sensation, Oliver Pinder.\n\nTickets HERE\n\nBeside Trawbreaga Bay, in Co. Donegal, on the north coast of Ireland, in an old schoolhouse, with a suitcase full of hired recording gear, Oisin Leech strums gently on an acoustic guitar and watches the tide pull the water away from this ancient inlet. The thickness of Oisin’s voice soothes the old world room as the sound waves bounce around in the land where his ancestors still live and still wander. This is a scene from the makings of Oisin Leech’s first solo album Cold Sea. After a musical history that led Leech from the street punk bands of yesteryear through an ongoing seven-album stint with folk duo The Lost Brothers, he found himself for the first time working on songs to sing alone. The thought of performing songs with no accompanying harmony and minimal arrangement led Leech to soul-search for new expressions and ways of playing. Throughout the great pause of the pandemic, after his family had gone to bed, Leech sat by the fireplace experimenting with open tunings. The poems of Seamus Heaney and Leech’s own history as a studied playwright inspired the words. In his mind, the songs became imagined vignette films playing behind closed, guitar eyes. After writing nearly 40 new songs in this fashion Leech wrote “October Sun” which would become the foundation for Cold Sea. “All of a sudden I had a collection of songs that told a complete story. Looking back I see I had created a new world.” Seeking a producer for the record, Leech made a list of several people he’d like to work with. The first was guitarist and songwriter Steve Gunn, who happily accepted after hearing a demo of 'October Sun'. Leech was sitting on a dream of making the record in Donegal Ireland, a county significant to Leech because it is the place from where his ancestors come from. Pitching this idea to Gunn sparked the first of several serendipities circling the Cold Sea sessions - Gunn had always wanted to visit Donegal to connect with his own familial roots in the region. Oisin and Steve have just met up and begun their odyssey through the Irish countryside to the coastal school house they intend to convert into a recording studio for a five-day session. On the first night of the journey, they make a stop off in Downings, Ireland where Steve’s grandmother had lived before emigrating to America. They pay a visit to the Olde Glen Bar where Steve’s great-grandparents met. They soon jump in on a traditional pub jam, sharing songs and drinks into the night. Some of Steve’s distant cousins happen to be at the bar that evening. The synchronicity of the journey continues further as someone recommends Oisin and Steve visit a local music historian of sorts named Billy Robinson. Billy has worked with artists like Clannad and John Lee Hooker in the past and happily lends the two total strangers some vintage recording gear, including a ’70s U87 microphone that winds up contributing greatly to the sound of the record. One of the first things the listener may notice about the Cold Sea album is its tremendous warmth. Each song was recorded effortlessly in just a few takes and adorned gently with synthesizers and guitar from Gunn. Several songs feature contributions on the upright bass by current Bob Dylan band stalwart Tony Garnier. M. Ward plays guitar on “October Sun” and there are strings by stellar Irish fiddler Roisín McGrory and bouzouki by Irish folk legend Dónal Lunny throughout. It is a friendship record but even at its most collaborative, Cold Sea remains centered around the humble acoustic guitar and woollen blanket vocals of Leech. “Music is a feeling for me. If music makes you feel a certain way, that’s what matters”. Oisin exclaimed to no one, on a pier-side, watching the sun change on the open water. Leech read Bruce Chatwin’s Songlines while dreaming up the songs on Cold Sea. The book tells of the Aboriginal Outback tradition of songs as maps; they had the belief that the land was ‘sung’ into existence. The album acts in this fashion to express the landscape and atmosphere of where it was made. Intellectually the songs are about many things, including the healing power of the ocean, but in essence they come from deep within their songwriter. “Every time I sing each of these songs a very very clear film starts in my head”, says Oisin. The album's opener “October Sun” plays like a colourful landscape painting rich with sadness just beyond understanding. The song “Colour of the Rain”, with its odd guitar tuning and carefully scored bass part from Garnier, poetically traces chapters of Leech’s life that unfold in a flash of the northern lights, often visible from Donegal. Leech spent months finding the words to express these feelings. The song “Trawbreaga Bay” originally had 20 verses before Leech trimmed it down to an easy 3. On the album's instrumental explorations, one can easily smell the air of the northern coast -particularly the song “Maritime Radio” which embodies the region while finding poetry in a radio shipping forecast. With this firm sense of setting, Cold Sea carries a somber and comforting tone that rolls over the listener in healing waves. Both Oisin and Steve do not hesitate to use the word 'magic' when describing both what happened in Donegal and the music that resulted. There is no other way to put it.\n\nTickets HERE\n\nMost of the writing of Naima Bock’s second album, Below A Massive Dark Land (out 27 September via Sub Pop), was a solitary affair. It may not sound it – it’s made up of strong, purposeful arrangements with a huge host of musicians; filled with cradling space and warm light. This will also come as a surprise to anyone who has seen Naima perform in the time since the release of her 2022 debut Giant Palm, undoubtedly a communal experience.\n\nWith a band of ten, three, or even just solo, when Naima plays there’s a rare bond between the musicians on stage and the audience. In their interview with her, The Quietus declared “after every song the applause and cheering is immense, so immense in fact that it seems to be coming from a different place than the usual formalities of a live show, a link between performer and artist forged somewhere deeper and more personal.”\n\nIt was in Giant Palm’s music too, a record that sweeps and swells, a chorus of voices and instrumentation that rises and falls as one alongside Naima’s own somersaulting voice.\n\nIt’s true though, most of Below…’s songs started life very simply; Naima alone, living in her grandmother’s shed in South London, writing just with her voice, guitar and violin. She’s no violin virtuoso but had taken it up as a songwriting exercise for its ability to draw melodies from her – a trick that undoubtedly worked, these are songs that drift into the back of your mind and settle there like fallen leaves, songs you wake up singing. The remainder was written on the road after those moments of audience connection, in the quiet that follows.\n\nThere’s power in the solitary too. Giant Palm was arranged with collaborator Joel Burton but going it alone in search of something truly hers, Naima found she was capable of more. “After me and Joel stopped working together”, she remembers, “it was an impossibility to even fathom doing arrangements myself but then I started learning violin. Playing it isn’t easy but writing melodies on it is”. Finding that she could go it alone was incredibly powerful for Naima, “I think I needed it, to be able to feel proud of something. Like, that’s me! That feels good.”\n\nOnce that writing portion is over though, this ends. The record is not a stark, stripped back affair. Below… still has that majesty that made Giant Palm so remarkable. Tugging the first record down from the skies and spreading it across the earth; there’s a newfound vocal power and confidence born from hundreds of hours on stage and the music sounds fuller, more tangible, but no less enveloping.\n\nThis can be found in the album’s lead singles. ‘Kaley’ feels fresh and surprising in its rug-pull choppiness but is distinctly Naima in its swinging, jubilant choruses. The accompanying ‘Further Away’ takes a different tack, drawing you irresistibly near in its simplicity. Finally, the hazy, luxurious beauty of ‘Feed My Release’ draws on the sepia-toned traditions of The Roches, John Prine and Loudon Wainwright III but imbues them with the kind of stark confessional songwriting of Mount Eerie. Lyrically reaching deeper and darker than Giant Palm, these are ambitious, rich arrangements.\n\n‘Kaley’ and ‘Age’ were produced by Naima herself and ‘Feed My Release’ was produced by Naima and caroline’s Oliver Hamilton who also helped in various places with arrangement. For the bulk of the record however, Naima brought her arrangement ideas into The Crypt Studios in London where she worked with Bristolian duo Jack Ogborne (aka Bingo Fury) & Joe Jones who were working together and producing for the first time outside of Ogborne’s own album, alongside a core band of Clem Appleby (Bass, Backing vocals), Meitar Wegman (Saxophone), Oscar De Guardans (Backing vocals, Electric Guitar, Harmonium) and Cassidy Hansen (Drums, Backing vocals) alongside and expansive choir, horn and string section. “I put my foot down slightly more this time but that’s not to detract from how much everyone put into it,” Naima says, “it shouldn’t be understated their contribution to the record”.\n\nHaving not gelled with slicker, more experienced producers, Naima found the duo a production team who were able to take her ideas and apply a boundless enthusiasm and meticulous attention to detail in executing them. They had a remarkable knack for knowing exactly how to record Naima’s less-concrete ideas and a flexibility in getting what she needed particularly when it came to recording her voice. “I do still struggle with singing in the studio”, Naima recalls, “we had to figure it out. I kept having to put myself in different places like in the hallway, or in another room just to be able to access something”.\n\nDuring the release of Giant Palm, Naima spoke about how she left previous bands and went it alone due to difficulty enjoying touring. However, with headline tours including London’s EartH and support shows for artists such as A. Savage, J. Mascis, Squid, Rodrigo Amarente, Arab Strap, and This is the Kit, Naima’s feet have hardly touched the ground since 2022. Instead, what she found is her place in touring, largely entirely alone. “I managed to find my favourite little safe spaces”, she says, “its nice compiling spots like that in every city, now every time I circle back to the place, there's like at least five or six people I know”.\n\nThis is touring at its most romantic. “Traipsing around and playing music”, staying with artists, friends, or just friendly people and finding the artistic pockets in every city. Naima has always been slightly nomadic – living as a child between Brazil, Greece, and all over London – and that background has now led to a place where she’s truly fallen for touring and travel. This appears in the album title which comes from Olga Tokarczuk’s book Flights, a description of the view from an aeroplane. It’s a title that initially may sound imposing but in its context this vastness, dimpled with the weak glow of city lights, is a form of comfort.\n\nThese safe spaces bleed into the writing; songs written hiking the wide horizons of Tucson, Arizona or inspired by the residents of one particular Amsterdam hotel with a penchant for swimming naked in the canal behind. ‘Further Away’ meanwhile was written on a rare non-musical holiday in Greece, “after about four days without an instrument, I start getting itchy. So, I went to the shop and bought a tiny bouzouki and wrote it on that”. This became the album’s starkest moment, one of those rare songs that arrived so tender and fully-formed it didn’t need to be touched.\n\nIt’s not all grand vistas and clear waters though. There were lonely, difficult moments and clarifying conversations in these places around things like depression, family and abortion, relationships and break-ups and growing old that melded with Naima’s own experiences, bringing them into view for her, working their way into her lyrics and finding release.\n\nIt's these types of conversations that mean the lyrical content of Below… often yearns for more stability. ‘Gentle’ wrestles with ideas of settling more. “It's something I'd like to do one day but my tendency is to move, I find myself unable to feel fully at home in the world”, she says, “I just feel like it would be difficult to bridge that gap”. The album elsewhere is often interested in the process of ageing. This comes in the reckoning that “gravity is just kind of slowly pulling us down” in ‘My Sweet Body’, a song where sweetness is gently tinged with a creeping unease as she sings “I cannot seem to look after this body”. “It’s beautiful” Naima says, “but emotional to think about and a burden sometimes”. The traps we can fall into as we age appear in the wry good time of ‘Age’. Naima saw this first-hand on a less pleasant touring experience staying with someone whose “things were better in my day” mindset consumed and warped otherwise well-intentioned beliefs.\n\nThis results in a record that may occasionally appear to contradict itself; communal but solitary, rooted in place but free, intimate but spacious. This, however, is what makes Below… comforting and familiar. Who doesn’t contain within them these contradictions, who doesn’t want things that are directly at odds with each other. Like the safe spaces Naima has found the world over, Below… doesn’t require all the answers, not yet, but provides a safe place to look."
