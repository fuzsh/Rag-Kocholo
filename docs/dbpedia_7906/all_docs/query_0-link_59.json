        "text": "Song\n\n\"You're beautiful\" is a song by James Blunt. This song was released on the album Back to Bedlam in 2004. The song is about a person who is attracted by a girl on the subway but, unfortunately, she is with another man... (hence the title \"You're beautiful\").\n\nSinger\n\nJames Blunt is the only member of this group.This song was a hit when it was released !\n\nIf we had to define it this type of music, we could say that it is more or less pop rock and folk rock music because there is a guitar and this intrument is typical of pop rock and of folk rock music.\n\nActually, James Blunt is born in a family of military background. He was born in a military hospital to Tidworth in England and forced to move every other year. He really had no childhood as the other kids of his age. Yet, music helped him not to feel too lonely.\n\nHave a look at this picture to get your own opinion about what he looks like…\n\nTimes\n\nAs you may remember, \"You're Beautiful\" is about lost love between James Blunt and a unknown girl on the subway…\n\nSince, the world changed well...\n\nDID YOU KNOW THAT? In Kosovo, James Blunt used to walk around the villages wearing East German uniform and humming \"Give Peace a Chance\" of John Lennon !!\n\nAfter, this war experience, he left the army and devoted his life to music. Now, here is he : our British Singer James Blunt !\n\nWe do hope that this article was not too boring and that from now on you are DEFINITELY a great fan of James Blunt !\n\nAnd don't 4get : UK ROCKS, that's for sure !\n\nZohra and Pauline."
