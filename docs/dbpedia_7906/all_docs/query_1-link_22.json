        "text": "It’s been four weeks since Tim Midyett called and told me that Steve Albini had died in the night. I didn’t seek out the role of The Death Guy, but since I’ve posted essayistic ramblings on several musical friends who have journeyed on, it would be weird to leave out Steve, one of the closest and longest.\n\nWe met on Halloween night 1986, when I went to his house on Francisco St. on Chicago’s north side to record six songs. I had been in Chicago three years and was working a day job and playing occasional club dates and trying to meet local players. Now and then I set up a “demo” session at a studio recommended by someone or other, in this case, a friend I worked with at my day gig who’d played sax with Big Black. I couldn’t have said exactly what a demo was, but I used the word a lot. I guess it was to demonstrate to a record company that you could do a thing even though this wasn’t the thing itself?\n\nIt was a time of many questionable activities, and planning a session of about six hours to track six songs was one. The go-go-go schedule was mostly because money was tight, but also because there was punk rock and it was 1986. I admired a lot of the punk spirit, and I did snarl and bang and bleed a bit when I played, but the idiom overall was of limited interest to a guy like me who equated music with lines of cultural and personal ancestry, and who worked daily on improving as a player.\n\nSteve had been featured in a brief article in SPIN magazine. It described a soi-disant sociological experiment he had done on the street near Northwestern U. in Evanston, standing behind a plexiglass shield, yelling vicious insults at passersby, thereby tempting them to hurl objects at him, hard. (When we were last together, which turned out to be actually last together, on a little stage in L.A. last December, we talked about that stunt, for the first time.) Being written about in SPIN elevated someone immeasurably, in my dewy Eighties eyes. I noticed that the subjects themselves did not necessarily feel elevated. Steve, for one, seemed not to let any sort of coverage affect him much, except perhaps for a Groucho-like response of thinking less of the outlet; when I mentioned SPIN’s article on Beausoleil to Michael Doucet, around this same time, he simply said, “That writer was an asshole.” I was always getting these reminders that, at 23, I was an anonymous figure talking about musicians and admiring them from afar, not a talked-about or admired musician. I was itching to move up onto the platform, be written about, cordon myself off from the chattering herd, and call them assholes. So I was excited to edge into Steve’s orbit, and I was sensitive enough to the punk-rock stigma against careerism and fame-courting to conceal my excitement, or so I imagined.\n\nAt Steve’s house, you performed in the cellar. Calling it a studio, not a concrete-slab three-room dungeon, was a stretch. But the microphone complement was impressive, and the board, which Steve ran from the attic, was very respectable (I think a Neotek, even back then?). Most important, the audiophile knowledge on hand was deep, considerably deeper than with any previous engineer I’d hired. To hear playback after you’d done a take or two, you’d hustle up the stairs, pass through the first-floor kitchen with its view of the big living room, and proceed up another tiny staircase to the cramped aerie, where the rail-thin impresario sat twiddling knobs and issuing acerbic commentary. The living area on the main floor was an EPA cleanup site strewn with Edison cylinders, junky couches, takeout boxes, lethargic punks with smileproof faces and old-man hats, and various zines — underground culture rags like Forced Exposure, comix, and esoteric porn, including a memorable pictorial pamphlet titled Two Nuns and A Pack Mule.\n\nTwo Stevemouth moments stand out from that first night of getting to know him and hearing what my music sounded like filtered through his gear and his brain. One moment confirms his aesthetic reputation and the other contradicts it. I had written a bad, derivative song (most of my songs hit both marks in those days) about a cute Korean girl I had a crush on (notwithstanding I was living with another girl whose child I had fathered; moral character isn’t one of my strong suits). The tune was in E, and started with a decisive double stop on the first and second strings of my black Ibanez electric guitar. But on the take of the song that we liked best, I overshot the double-stop by one fret. The song started, in other words, with everyone else striking an E chord and me striking two-thirds of an F. It was over fast, but it was horrible. This clam, as it turned out, was Steve’s favorite part of the whole song. I don’t think he disliked the song so much as he cherished the mistake. Up in the aerie, I politely tried to investigate the means by which we could edit the offending fraction of a second out and replace it with the intended chord, Steve pressed back, insisting that it sounded wonderful as was, and to correct it would be like scraping the lips off Mona Lisa. After a minute or two of this nonsense, he let me have my way. Giving free rein to dissonance, haphazard error, and loud, listener-alienating effects were classic Albini moves. Giving the artist his way was another.\n\nThe other moment was toward the direction of musical orderliness, and came afterward when we were mixing, sitting side-by side at the board. The players I’d used on the six songs were dear friends who had traveled from back east to help me. Now they’d all gone off somewhere. Wrapping up the mix, Steve wheeled around to me in his springy office chair. He spoke softly and plainly, as was his way. “This isn’t the kind of music I particularly like or know very much about,” he said. “But you’ve got good ideas, and you know what you’re doing. Your players here aren’t up to that level. If you want to do more of these sessions, I know many good players who would meet the material with more skill. I understand that there are personal relationships here, but inasmuch as your music has any claim above or outside these relationships, and since your hard-earned money is on the line, I suggest you consider using different players next time, and I would be happy to make specific recommendations.”\n\nI haven’t shared that moment with anyone before, because I didn’t want my friends to know about it, and because it didn’t really amount to anything other than to plant a seed in my head. Enough years have passed to let go of the concern about wounding feelings, and I share it now because it shows an undersung side of Steve. “I hear he’s just an asshole to bands a lot of the time,” reports my middle son, who plays in a band and never met Steve. Well, maybe, but. There are critical things young musicians should get to hear about themselves in order to better their craft, criticisms that are not only hard to hear but hard to state with delicacy. When your brand is plain speaking, you’re well-positioned to deliver the goods. In this case the remark was completely non-obligatory, and as such, an act of kindness and respect. Several more such critical remarks, of me and my hired players both, followed over the years, but as my circle slowly widened and I came to work with more experienced players, the criticisms ebbed.\n\nWhat Steve knew about music was sometimes hard for me to assess. I admit I never thought of him foremost as a musician, the way I thought, for instance, of Todd, the outstanding, greyhound-loving drummer in Shellac. But now and then Steve would toss off a comment that was surprisingly on-point about something that seemed far out of his bailiwick, like the tone of a five-string banjo or the technique of its player. Certainly his head was crammed with information on the manufacture and mechanics of esoteric instruments like Chamberlains and less-loved gear like Soviet amplifiers and Romanian lathes. His ear was as nuanced as any first-rate engineer’s on balance matters like when someone in a group of singers needed to get three inches closer to the capsule. At a 2008 session in his post-Francisco St., fancy-schmancy studio called Electrical Audio, I had brought in a quartet of horn players for an R&B-ish song. Something sounded fishy in the first couple takes, and I went into the control room to sort it out with Steve. “I’m not getting a strong ‘I can play’ vibe from the trombonist,” he said. Hilarious, and accurate.\n\nNo, no one can say Steve didn’t know about or care for music. But he was a science guy, and a word guy, and his skills in those domains colored his thoughts about music and his approach to it. His philosophy of keeping out of the way of the performance and staying focused on the minimally adorned documentation of it didn’t emerge simply from ideology; I believe it was also grounded in a sober assessment of his own strengths. I think his respect for people like George Massenburg and Tom Dowd was as primary and as quasi-religious as mine is for the people those two men produced, like Linda Ronstadt and Wilson Pickett — though we both admired all those people.\n\nThis predisposition toward the practical, and against tinkering with the interpersonal chemistry of players, underlay his lifelong wish to be known and credited as an engineer, not a producer — a word that, he stated in an interview, “sounds a lot like ‘cocksucker’.” Very quotable, but really he was uninterested in massaging artist egos and neuroses, helping them compose words or music, or interacting with the promotional side of the business in any way, and even if he had wanted to do those things, he wouldn’t have been very good at them. Shortly after the release of my first solo record, Country Love Songs, a record on which about two-thirds of the songs were Steve-engineered, my friends in the trad-country band BR549 decided to visit Electrical to go after the same kind of sound. The recordings they got sounded fairly powerful to me, but disappointed the band. “He didn’t help us with our arrangements,” said Chuck. No, he hardly ever did that.\n\nThe combo of energetically skilled playing and room resonance on those BR recordings reminds me of the Cheap Trick recordings Steve helmed. The band remade their second record, In Color, with Steve. The original record was full of terrific songs but the, er, what you might call arrangements, were twee and inapposite. So it was a good idea, if you had a do-over, to go someplace where no one interfered with that stuff, and where hard music sounded itself or harder yet. I thought the remake sounded killer, and so did my Chicago friend Jay O’Rourke, another highly talented recordist. Jay had mixed Cheap Trick live, and his comment stayed with me: “That record sounded exactly like that band did, coming out of their monitors.”\n\nThe tl;dr on Young Steve was that he already seemed to have forgotten everything not worth knowing about engineering records, and already struck a commanding presence with his opinions and intuitions on mic choice and placement and mix decisionmaking. His philosophy of being a plumber-like figure, ultimately at the service of the artist who had hired him, didn’t make a perfect tongue-and-groove fit with his steady confidence in his personalized audio aesthetics. He officially wanted you to sound like nothing but yourself, yet the records you made with him always sounded like yourself-via-him. To be sure, any engineer you hire becomes like an additional band member. But Steve’s added voice was unusually strong and unique. Unlike the digital vs. analogue gap, which is somewhat of a nerdy audiophile obsession, that voice was pretty easily detectable to the average listener.\n\nSteve interned for a while at Chicago Recording under Hank Neuberger. Hank once told me that he ended a long argument about recording methods with Steve by saying, “I agree with every part of your argument, except your conclusion.” Classic! It was that final step that made Steve Steve. Every time I tracked with him, whether at his house or Electrical, I had the experience of walking to the control room to hear playback after performing a song and thinking, “That doesn’t sound just like it sounded in the room, yet no enhancements have been added. What’s the deal?”\n\nPart of the deal was room mic’ing, part the size and resonance of the room. But part of it, the brain-of-the-engineer part, remained mysterious. Talking about this recently with Alex Hall, Alex pointed out that the idea of transparency in a studio, where you make a noise and the sound wave goes into a capsule, through a wire, into another room, into a board with hundreds of settings, and through various coils and metals and papers to pass through a speaker and back into your ears, is ridiculous. Lots happens on that journey, even before you deliberately add anything. When Steve was helming the session, his values and his brain were the main thing that happened.\n\n_____\n\nI returned to Steve and to Electrical time and again after that Halloween night. We worked together on six records of mine, Brennen Leigh’s record which I cocksu— uh, produced; a short film soundtrack; a couple smaller projects. All enjoyable, efficient, collaborative, and full of witty banter. On my own records, I perpetrated a broad range of sound waves, hardly any of which resembled PJ Harvey’s Rid of Me or any of the abrasive music by which he was known. I did quiet balladry, whispering into a ribbon mic. I did antique-sounding songs with a single mic placed several feet distant to capture instrument and voice both. I did string section overdubs with ceiling-hung mics in concentric motion. I put together a horn section where each chart was passed one person down so that no player couldn’t make out his instructions. I did a session where wine glasses were thrown across the room between piano and sax stabs. Handing him an unorthodox assignment was the most reliable way to make Steve happy, and getting closer to him inspired me to think of unorthodox ideas I never would have otherwise. I imbibed a lot of his wisdom, and came to apply it both consciously and less consciously, in all my records, in any studio.\n\nHe strongly preferred that a recording be a document of an event, not a science-lab concoction. That idea has changed in significance and meaning across the decades. In 1945 it wouldn’t have been an idea at all because it had no practical alternatives, whereas in 1985 it seemed like a lost cause one clung to only out of ill-advised pertinacity. It’s not necessarily a noble or correct way, steering around what’s easy and cheap and modern. Documented in-the-moment performance puts a burden on musicians to do it right in a reasonable timeframe and on engineers not to let their attention flag. It stands in contrast to the idea of a record as a painstaking commercial collage, shaped to deliberately satisfy the non-fans who would make important decisions on promoting and distributing the music, and conform to the mediocre platforms, like car radios, on which it would be heard. I was happy to think of people in office buildings promoting me and of car radios carrying my songs, but from Steve’s view these considerations were basically concessions toward absurd demands from people who were, at least in my case, imaginary. Lashing the audio engineering to an idea of market demands also tended to waste time and money. Someone told me about a Jeff Lynne production where the first day was spent positioning the high-hat mic, the first week or so getting the sounds on the full drum kit.\n\nI like Steve’s way better. For one thing, it reflects how I put music together when not in a studio — try out ideas with others, listening and thinking and discussing as you go, and finally perform them together and simultaneously, not piece by piece. Thus the studio environment is tamed, less strange and daunting, as it tends to be. There’s a common perception, when you enter one of these floating-floor-and-glass-booth sanctums, that suddenly all the outside rules no longer apply. This is The Studio — prick up your ears, folks! — trust me, I’m a pro — we’ll start with the high-hat. To Steve all that was bunk. Through him I came to believe that the goal is always to play just like you sound, and then be excited by what you hear at playback — not to forestall judgement until the later stages of mixing or, God forbid, mastering. You want the rightness to be palpable at once, just like when you’re playing in your living room. The tools and the tech are all at the service of a musical experience, and how you compose and communicate that experience to other ears and minds isn’t different, in any way that much matters, than it was in 1985, or 1945, or 45.\n\nThis sort of realistic, wide-perspective essentialism ran through all of Steve’s resumé and his thinking. He didn’t like to automate a mix, because it mechanized thought and preserved a one-time decision — better to keep thinking and re-evaluating as the hands move, pass after pass. He favored tape over digital media because of tape’s infinite resolution — tape sounds deeper and better, to put it simplistically — and because analog was an older medium whose qualities and quirks had long ago been discovered and worked out. T Bone Burnett, in a recent interview in Variety, spoke insightfully about the evolution of recording media. It’s worth quoting at length, even though I’m writing about someone else, because T Bone puts it in terms that are easy to understand:\n\n\"The most profound experience of hearing music is to be sitting across from a musician when he’s playing it. And the next most profound experience of hearing music is to hear a high-fidelity recording on a great system, on a good format, so that you can close your eyes and think you’re sitting in the room with the person playing it. What’s happened to us now is we’ve gone from sitting in the room hearing people playing it to high-fidelity recordings of people playing it — the most high-fidelity recording is an acetate….Then you step way down to digital, which is not a sound wave, but a sample of a sound wave. So you’re just getting a piece of the high fidelity, and they call it high definition. I guess it’s better defined, but you’re still only getting a percentage of the recording of the experience. And then you go from CDs to MP3s… to, now, we’re listening to music being bounced off satellites in space and coming back to us. That’s how far we’ve been removed from the profound experience of actually hearing somebody play a song in the living room, like was happening in all of time before the last century. So, the experience of listening has been degraded steadily.”\n\nSteve would have endorsed all of this. On the supply side, there’s an economic angle that the above argument leaves unaddressed. Making a record on your iPhone is more within the reach of most of us than buying time at a studio that has well-maintained old tape machines and a crusty oldster that knows how to use them, to say nothing of the cost of the two-inch and quarter-inch reels. As fast as sessions with Albini were paced, paying for the tape was still burdensome. I eventually came to feel that the main advantage to digital, over its cheapness, is editing ease and capability. I don’t know how many times I watched Steve whip out his razor blade and make a diagonal cut across a section of quarter-inch to splice together a couple group performances in which I liked a part of one and another part of another. Twenty times, maybe? It was neat to watch, but you couldn’t help watching the minute hand on the clock as the surgery was performed and think, We could be making five of these cuts with greater delicacy and reversibility on a screen in less time.\n\nFor this reason, I went to Steve in advance of my record Gone Away Backward in 2012 with the idea of recording onto digital and editing onscreen, then dumping to tape for mix. Happily, he was amenable at once (another blow to his reputation as an old-school-tech militant), and we brought into Electrical a laptop and a suave Frenchman who was conversant with ProTools. Steve set up mics and listened as we played, and did very little else during the tracking of the record. I was delighted with the results, and repeated the method on my next record, Upland Stories. After thirty-some years of trying to get a comfortable and productive sort of routine going in studios, I landed happily here: record on a computer, edit, switch to tape if affordable. Ultimately, Steve Fishell and George Massenburg and five other living people can hear a recording and tell you whether it’s analogue or digital — I can’t — and so the outlay of money is, to my mind, discretionary, not crucial to quality. A small difference of opinion between me and my late friend.\n\n_____\n\nOver the last 15 years, my experiences with Steve were focused on intense, productive work weeks. Before that, we were younger, different people, with more time to kill and metabolism to burn, and the experiences were more frequent and less work-related. In 1989 I was living in a dingy apartment in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago. My four-year-old son was there too, Mondays through Thursdays. I mentioned questionable activities; baby Nick was exposed to many during this era. With Steve around, things were likely to be said that a four-year-old’s father might not want him to hear, and Steve was even likelier to say them knowing the father’s skittishness. Once, a colored glass candle fell to the floor in my kitchen and broke in many pieces. “Do you know,” Steve purred in Nick’s ear, “that broken glass tastes exactly like sweet candy?” “Steve,” I said, “stop it.”\n\nAnother time, Steve asked me if it would be okay to share with Nick a joke that was “dirty — well, not that dirty.” Okay, I said, already feeling like Charlie teeing up the ball for Lucy. The joke that ensued had an anodyne set-up, followed by a punchline that, though succinct, somehow managed to cover lesbianism, anal sex, property devaluation, and casual sadism. Many of you elders may recall this joke, which, like so much 1980s-vintage small talk, is now unrepeatable. Whatever its humor quotient, one thing it was certainly not was “not that dirty.” “Steve,” I said, ashen, “we’re trying to create a person here.”\n\nWe were at a John Waters show at Park West where John took questions from the crowd after doing his bit. Steve’s hand went up. “Do you light your farts?” he inquired. John replied that he did not, turned to look toward the next question, then did a brief double-take. “What an odd question,” he mused, I think appreciatively. Another playing-to-a-theatrical-crowd anecdote came to me second-hand. Steve went to the Music Box theater at midnight, where an X-rated movie starring Johnny “Wadd” Holmes was showing. It was a late-career project for Johnny, who was infected with AIDS during his scenes, and was soon to die of the virus. Steve’s voice rang out across the theater at the conclusion of the group-sex scenes: “Thanks — and so long!”\n\nIt was fun being with Steve outside of his home environment, because you could observe his words ricochet off of people who were innocent of his style. In 1998, he and George Massenburg and I spent a day touring Nashville studios, plotting out a record of old-time country performers like Porter Wagoner and Jean Shepard, one of those projects that I visualized and began to plan before it fell through. At Woodland, a studio manager pointed out a rather tattered piece of furniture where colleagues or label overseers could sit and observe sessions. “Ah, the blow-job couch,” Steve murmured thoughtfully, to no one’s delight. Over at Ray Kennedy’s place, Steve Earle’s name naturally came up, since he was part-owner of the studio. When Ray disclosed that the troubadour had just married his sixth wife, Albini looked abstractedly at the ceiling. “What’s half of half of half of half of half of half?” he wondered aloud. I chuckled midway through that, but no one else did. They just waited around for the sentence to end.\n\nHere’s his most purely delightful off-the-cuff comment that I know of. At Abbey Road in London, Steve was mixing some band when Paul McCartney stuck his head through the door unannounced. Paul listened a moment before asking who the band was. The assistant answered, and then Steve turned, saying politely, “And you are…?” A great anecdote right there — but to give the composer of “Eleanor Rigby” his due, he bit. “Name’s Paul,” he replied good-naturedly. “I used to be in a group called The Beatles.” Poker ace, meet pokerface.\n\nSteve was younger when he delivered his nastiest statements, and as the obits made sure to mention, he later recanted and apologized for them, credibly and unemotionally. Once happily married he began improving upon himself, like most of us men. He became more sensitive to the historical injuries of some peoples, accepting a responsibility as a luckier person not to add to their suffering with careless speech. Having lived through this careless-talking, insult-hurling, gratuitously mean era, I’d say two things. One is that a social norm of being nice and sensitive to one another is a clear improvement on a social norm of being dicks. We were such dicks, back then! Speaking largely for myself.\n\nMy second thought is that the effort to understand the context of times gone by, so that you can proceed past “what a lot of unbelievable dicks they were” to a fuller assessment, is amazingly challenging. It’s challenging even for people who lived in, who were themselves adults in, the earlier time. (This includes some of the obit writers, older music-scene observers who, it seems to me, are pretending to have forgotten bygone behavioral norms for the benefit of their reputation among priggish younger readers.) In Sue Miller’s book, The World Below, a character grapples with her dead grandmother’s diary detailing her early love life and her confinement in a tuberculosis sanatorium. The character reflects that the job of an historian is “to explain how life felt as it went by. Not just what happened, but how differently it signified: what happened.” Naturally, getting into the mindset of a medieval serf or courtier is effortful. But it’s a little incredible to live to 60 and find it almost as hard to explain how differently things signified just 35 years ago, to others or even to oneself.\n\nOnce, for Steve’s birthday, he booked an upstairs room at a place called Club Dreamerz. There’s currently a Facebook page for the club where you can share your memories. “Former regular at Dreamerz?” the page intro says. “Work there? Band play there? Have sex there?” We Eighties youngsters went fucking nuts in these clubs, let me assure you. Two bands played the night of Steve’s birthday, mine and a special-for-the-occasion assemblage — a quartet if I remember right — of guys from bands that hung around Steve’s living room, bands with Kill in their names. My little power-pop trio was called Those Ferns. We had zero cultural overlap with the party attendees; it was like Amy Ray playing at a Trump rally. After us, the bassist from the group following asked to borrow my guy’s bass. Hearing him flail around on it in the act, my bassist, a sociable, unpretentious jobber named Gary, shouted in my ear: “Has that guy ever played the bass before?” “Yes,” I shouted back, “he’s in a very successful band called Kill-something, or Something-kill. He’s one of the better-known bassists of our time!” But Gary didn’t really believe me, because the guy seemed so unfamiliar with the basic functions of the instrument. He couldn’t locate notes and he couldn’t keep time. Punk rock!\n\nAfter the music, everyone destroyed everything in the room. It didn’t feel spontaneous, and it wasn’t in the least joyful. It felt like people were carrying out a grim duty. Bottles and glass whizzed around and smashed on the walls, until no intact bottle or glass remained. Mirrors crumbled. Chairs were kicked to pieces, tables beaten methodically until they broke apart. Little was said; the room was eerily quiet between bursts of things breaking. A fistfight broke out, briefly, when my dwarfish drummer pinned a much larger fellow from a Kill-something band to the wall. He screamed at the taller, cowering fellow as bottles smashed like tiny fireworks near his head. “I come from the South Side!” he said. Through all this, no one got very hurt; only property was destroyed, drunkenly and thoroughly. Dodging projectiles, I cased my guitar and I hoofed it downstairs and outside. Steve was sitting against the curb, there on Milwaukee Avenue, mumbling miserably and holding his head. It was the only time I ever saw him out of his wits. I wish I’d written down what he said, because it was sloppy and embarrassing. Some amusingly inarticulate Albini-isms would make a colorful contribution to his memory.\n\nThinking about this time and this “scene,” or loose collection of midwestern social acquaintances, brings me hard against some tableaux that aren’t all that pleasant. They reflect poorly on us. My honest effort to recreate these distant on-the-ground realities on paper may be distorted by the regret-ridden tenor of dotage, or by my not having really been an insider in this scene to begin with. Anyway, here’s the rub, as I see it: we were all wantonly attracted to violence. This seems to me as prime a candidate for regret and apology as any words that fell from our mouths. Reveling in murder and misery, I’m suggesting, is a worse character trait than reveling in insult and profanity, or getting into fistfights.\n\nOf course violence that was official, large-scale, and government-sponsored repelled us twentysomethings. Nuclear armaments, death penalties, vigilante cops, and Marines running roughshod over the beaches of Guatemala — solidly against. As for more pedestrian, less “system”-implicating forms of real-life violence, like the “Faces of Death” videos, or serial killers with creepily attractive personalities, that was a different category. That depended. It was portrayals of extreme violence in art that we devoured. We sang lustily about our darkest fantasies. We named our bands things like Rapeman. We immersed ourselves in images of torture. Those in the films of the above-referenced Mr. Waters, whom I loved and still harbor a warm and nostalgic affection for, were mostly staged. But the Manson killers, to one of whom my favorite Waters film was dedicated, didn’t “stage” their cruelty or just sing their anti-social impulses. The victims of John Wayne Gacy were innocent; were you, if you bought his paintings? The bloodlust in our circle ran high, and even though this was pretty recent and I was myself culpable, I’m not sure I can say why; but I think cruelty and violence made us feel alive with the thrill of transgression. Footage of the suicide by gunshot of R. Budd Dwyer, the Pennsylvania state treasurer, played on a loop in Steve’s living room for a while. So did a grainy video of a crappy comic in a small club losing his temper and seriously braining a heckler with his guitar.\n\nIt went beyond imagery at times. We did things that could hurt people, and sometimes did. Young Steve kicked a front-row weirdo hard in the face with his boot and wrote about it in Forced Exposure. Young me broke someone’s nose in a bar with my shoe. If there was blood or a broken bone at a show, whether our own injuries onstage or someone else’s, it was recounted with a smirk or a shrug — privately thrilling.\n\nWhat, as Rickie Lee Jones said, could make a boy behave this way? 1980s youngsters had a sense that adult leadership had failed, or was dangerously flawed, and saw the status quo — it then included Nancy Reagan’s astrology and just-say-no ignorance, SDI, AIDS, Iran-Contra, the Meese commission, nuclear proliferation, and voodoo economics, as George H.W. Bush called it — as intolerable. It was felt by some that end times were upon us. It’s true that I was politically reactionary in those days, and tended to cheerlead obnoxiously for the status quo rather than loathe or denounce it, but that was as reflexive as my friends’ tribal attachments, and possibly less well-informed too. We all shared the same polluted air, and we were all impatient and more than happy to give offense, regardless of politics. Even at the remove of a generation or two, contemporary youngsters should understand the spirit of impatience and the lure of tear-it-down antinomianism.\n\nBeyond politics, we were culturally outraged. Culture meant music, above all. We might not have quite known how to play a bass guitar, but silly radio noise, absurdly narrow intertribal conflicts, and corporate malfeasance at the majors really got us in a dither. The old order needed to be kicked to pieces before we might replace it with something better. Beyond music, we gagged on the junk food we were spoon-fed, that three-channel mediasphere of “The Jeffersons” and “Apple’s Way,” the nightly news starring this haircut or that, the morning-after-the-me-decade nauseous self-absorption of suburban teen melodrama and Jane Fonda workouts. Vomit it back in their stupid faces. The rule in America is that people in their 20s get to raise hell and trash the previous generation’s institutions, right? And raising hell, apart from whatever politics or ethical points are being advanced, is such fun, especially when the consequences are minor. My best memory says there was no shortage of fun in the 1980s, whether you were riding on mainstream trends — wearing a narrow tie and jittering like a robot to cocaine tempos — or crouched in a dank pit watching agricultural accidents back-projected behind a punk band and getting piss foully squirted on you by the lead “singer.”\n\nAnd now let the defense speak. Though the worst of what we said shocked and irritated some, as intended, most of it was recognizably juvenile and fast forgotten. The bourgeoisie can withstand a lot of epater. It’s a rough and venerable sport. The damage we inflicted on bodies and lives and property was mostly minor and easily patched up, especially because our families were decently well-off, our bodies were young, and we were usually careful not to truly ruin things. We were unwilling to subject ourselves to prosecution and trial. The second-floor of Club Dreamerz was cleaned up and redone a day or two later. I got the tooth I broke onstage capped. As far as I know the guy from Jesus Lizard fixed his mouth too, and the guy Steve kicked lived on, and the lady whose nose I broke is doing just fine. (We’re still friends!) After going half-deaf from cymbals and amps aimed at my head, I have an expensive hearing-aid set to which I’m deeply attached, just like many sexagenerian punk rockers. Mostly we made noise, and a lot of it.\n\nTough guys. But tough only in affect, since most of us were educated at four-year colleges, not subject to military service or a wartime draft, and weren’t fighting our way up from dire poverty or second-class citizenship.\n\n_____\n\nTim Midyett said something pithy and true, during a longer conversation we had a few days after his initial call. “If you disliked Steve,” Tim said, “it was because of something he said; if you liked him, it was because of something he did.” One thing Steve did was to raise money for poor people each December, alongside his wife Heather. “Letters To Santa” was an energy-intensive job. Staying up all night for improvisations and music at Second City, like middle-aged Jerry Lewis, and delivering goods to the penurious on Christmas morning, those efforts were just the public-facing centerpiece of the project, which took up a lot of Steve’s non-studio hours, along with his poker championships. The charity work went loudly unmentioned in the Times’s obituary and others, but it was key to Steve’s character and view of the world. Seconding Tim’s observation: if you were a celebrity supermodel or a label exec you were a sitting target for our friend’s savage animadversions, but if you were a South Side kid in a single-parent one-room apartment, you’d remember the stranger on your doorstep who redeemed an otherwise Dickensian Christmas morning. In the back half of his life, Steve refined his ire, backing his principled outrage at the misallocation of good luck and economic goods with both speech and actions.\n\nHis greatest act toward the end of his life, just last summer in fact, was to help guide Heather through a precarious surgery that planted two electrodes into her brain to help with the motor control loss resulting from her Parkinson’s. Steve was by her side from beginning to end. He put 30 of us on a text thread, where he sent hourly updates; we sent Heather jokes and warm wishes and you-go-girls. The life plan these two had, going forward, was akin to the one all of us have: Work less while maintaining adequate income, set up a calm steady environment for old age, manage each other’s health challenges —- though in this case the management was expected to be a round-the-clock task falling mainly on one party. Amid the sadness of a premature passing, it’s a beautiful legacy, I feel, that a person who couldn’t get out of bed unassisted as of a year ago now has a substantially renewed capacity for self-care, thanks to her spouse’s excellent stewardship.\n\nThe lesser acts of generosity are too many to list. Steve was fervently committed to friendship as a core ideal grounding a meaningful life. Probably partly because he didn’t have kids, he was able to effectuate the ideal at a college-friend level throughout his life. Comradeship, along with the ideal of amateur music-making (I mean “amateur” in the noblest sense) and serving as a worthy husband: these were the three things that most directed his energies, as far as I can see. When we were young and none of us was doing that well, we looked up to Steve as the friend whose financial health most resembled that of a 40-year-old. He was happy to live up to the consequent expectations. After he bought our mutual sax-playing friend a thousand dollars’ worth of violent pulp novels (a special interest of the friend’s) for his birthday, he assured me that my $50 gift “meant more” because it represented a bigger percentage of my assets. When I was recording somewhere in Chicago outside Electrical and needed a certain kind of electric guitar, Steve threw one in a cab and had it delivered it to the South Side. It delighted him that it was a guitar from the band Bush, who he had recently engineered-not-produced, and that he was tossing it blithely into a taxi. When I was separated from my oldest kid’s mom, stuck in a dead-end job, and generally at a low emotional point, Steve spent a lot of time on the phone with me, picking up my mood with expert listening and plain empathy.\n\nAnd get this. When Heather turned 30, Steve hired me and Silkworm to write and record songs glorifying her. From these he had 45-RPM records pressed. Then he hired out the roller rink where she had skated as a kid for a private surprise party. Then, and this is the big “then,” he reunited the metal band that had played at the rink about twenty years earlier, when Teeny Heather skated there, and hired them to play a set at the party. She was brought in blindfolded. When it was stripped off, her face didn’t register an adequate level of surprise, as no face really could. The surprise must have taken days to sink in. None of our wives who were privy to this spectacle of spousal solicitude ever admired any of us as fully again.\n\nWe all know people who manifest good qualities for us to model, and feel luckier for it. I feel fortunate to have met, while young, a few peers whose fuck-you moxie helped me stand stiffer than I was apt to. Against my tendency to yield to melancholy, sentimentality, and limpid thinking, Steve inched me toward toughness, in a way that was both helpfully therapeutic and better-aligned with the reality of physical constraints and other conscious beings. Viewing the world coolly, sticking by your guns (while reforming some ingrained behaviors over time), thinking of yourself with as little self-pity as you can manage, and saying what you mean, precisely and unapologetically: these traits help one to form a shield against hard luck and sadness, and put one in a better position to be of service. Acquaintances who behave with such stolidity are motivational. Thinking of Steve razoring tape, paging through the Economist at his Neotek, preparing a specialty espresso drink, or patiently explaining at enormous length why it was strictly necessary to follow some audio-recording protocol that no one else on earth followed, I do feel lucky to have spent as much time as I did around such a supremely self-possessed person. He once explained to me why I was fretting too much over the formation of my kid’s moral character. His theory, as I recall, was that the child takes the reins or doesn’t, early on, and the inputs matter much less than most of us imagine. If the end of that theory is that you can tell hyperviolent R-rated jokes to a four-year-old, then it’s a conclusion with which I disagree, though the argument that leads to it is absolutely creditable.\n\nYou can’t help speculating about causes, symptoms, and origins when a friend drops dead of a heart attack at 61. Maybe it’s little more than indulgent storytelling. But Steve suffered another heart attack about thirty years ago. He also put on some weight over the last several years, just like a lot of us. Most saliently, it seems to me, there was ongoing stress in his life ever since he bought Electrical 25+ years ago. Making payroll was often a challenge. The prices attached to the two tracking rooms fluctuated as the wider business wobbled, from the 1990s on; meanwhile the rate Steve personally commanded for running a session more than doubled. In other words, the success of the place fell mainly on his thin shoulders. He remained uncompromisingly committed, through his life, to a number of articulately defended but objectively risky bets. A well-maintained, first-class, two-room studio situated in Chicago. Mixing by hand. The punk ethos generally and his three-man touring band specifically. Tape. His craziest commitment was to refuse points on the records he oversaw. It was like demonstrating your small-government bona fides and concern about ballooning deficits by refusing Social Security checks. Crazy! I recommend everyone reading this take stock of all commitments undertaken when you were 20, and see whether you might be healthier going forward just to cash them in. To live is to maneuver, as Whittaker Chambers said.\n\nThe reason I’m thrown, but not devastated, by my friend’s death is that the friend himself gave me the tools to deal with it. Steve’s passing reminds us of the facts of our situation, which we should face with cool aplomb and high-humored fierceness, the way he faced anything he judged a fact. None of us is guaranteed four-score-and-ten, any moment could be the last, and until that moment we’d do well to take care of our work and the well-being of those closest to us.\n\nHere are some micro-details on my new bluegrass thing, more than anyone could possibly want.\n\nI wrote about how I first got into this music on the album cover. (Go buy it!) Besides the prime mover Bill Monroe and the equally iconic Flatt and Scruggs, the artists that are highest in my pantheon since youth are Jim and Jesse, the Osborne Brothers, The Country Gentlemen, and Jimmy Martin. (I know, I know, but for some reason the Stanleys weren’t on my radar until much later.) Next in line are Del McCoury and all the various and sundry “longhairs”: Sam Bush and his confreres, Tony Trischka, the Circle album guys, Grisman, Norman Blake, Tony Rice, and Ricky Skaggs (his hair got long late). Doc Watson, with one foot in bluegrass and about four feet in other places, was a lodestar ever since I can remember, and John Hartford was another uncategorizable who became an obsession after I saw him live, when I was 10.\n\nIn the 1980s I got so hooked on the second version of New Grass Revival that someone really ought to have staged an intervention. I won’t bear any shame for this, though. You can look at the videos online and see how intensely and hyper-creatively these four played — it holds up, no explanatory context needed. The intensity was ludicrous! If the poofy Styx fashion irks you and the songs sound too country-radio-conscious, you’re not paying attention to the right stuff. I went to see this band play all I could, sometimes travelling to cities far from where I lived, in the way sad-sack unemployables would track the Grateful Dead. Before my own gigs, I’d put on headphones and listen to their records, to get me pumped and dancing and to drill into me what the highest standard was. When I joined Special Consensus, at 24, I tried to push Greg’s band in the direction of NGR, with poppy arrangements of songwriter-ish songs, not to mention mullets and shrieking and stage-diving. Very inconsiderate of me. I got my young son in on the cult mentality, too, and to this day we exchange youtube links and marvel over bluegrass’s Fab Four. You get the idea. The serious and musical point in all this, apart from my fanboy pathology, is that the three soloists all offered differing directions in grammar and technique, solid enough to make a lifelong object of study. Pat Flynn’s mind-blowing cross-picking, Sam’s beautiful compositions and extraterrestrial timefeel, Béla’s…let’s say, mental energy. Beyond li’l ole me, they altered the minds of everybody after them who has tried for a mainstream brand of “acoustic” country — Alison Krauss, Dixie Chicks, Nickel Creek, Sierra Hull, and all the jam-band types. Unfortunately for NGR and their pocketbooks, they were years ahead of the curve. One obvious index of that is that it’s easy to find banjo in commercial country these days, where it was pretty much anathema back then.\n\nOnce on the road and doing the thing, I got to interact with some sterling people. Folks like Tim O’Brien, Danny Barnes, Alison Krauss, Charles Sawtelle, Jeff White, and Dan Crary helped inch me slo-o-o-wly away from record-obsessed fantasyland and toward the realization that the acoustic Olympians weren’t gods but mortals — and by a clear margin, grounded and amicable people. I think this helped turn me into someone who, when meeting celebrated figures in more popular realms of culture who act jerkishly or superiorly, rolls his eyes and strolls away. I mean, if Sam Forking Bush doesn’t feel empowered to treat me like a lump of dirt, surely no one else should, and if they do that’s for them to work on and me to laugh at. The genre doesn’t hold out the promise of celebrity, which is a drag in some respects, but also has this positive effect, that bluegrassers are perhaps better situated to cultivate good character, to learn how to endure the attention of strangers while not behaving like pricks. So I’ve been grateful to have many non-pricks to model. There are some grouchy hominids and hard-eyed hillmen out there, for sure, but in my experience, as long as you bring something to the table musically, you’re rewarded with collegial respect.\n\nOn the slim chance that someone is reading this without knowing a lot of these names, and is curious about the genre, just start there. And for the hell of it, here are a few more figures I’m very fond of, a smattering of people who embody the older style: Johnson Mountain Boys, Jim Eanes, Bill Harrell, Red Rector, Benny Martin, Delia Bell and Bill Grant, Vassar Clements, Wade Mainer, Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, J.D. Crowe and the New South, Buzz Busby, Jimmie Arnold, Nashville Bluegrass Band, Kentucky Colonels, Don Rigsby, James King, Longview, Reno and Harrell, Wilma Lee and Stoney Cooper…\n\nPeople have asked why this now, and there’s no brilliant answer, but if you’ve followed my thing for the last ten-plus years, you know I’ve been leaning in this direction for most of that time. The touring rock-band model I used through most of the 1990s and aughts was wearing me down toward the end. Once I left that for microphones, rotating accompanists, and seated audiences, in 2009, I felt happier at once; the mics sounded better and let me play better, the audience attention boosted the old ego, and the player variety lent more adventure and surprise to performance. Soon after, I started doing shows with deep cats like Mike Bub, Todd Phillips, and especially Shad Cobb, who has heavily influenced me musically and meditatively. Along the way I also learned a ton about groove and listening close at low volume from Robbie Gjersoe and Jenny Scheinman. The result of all this exposure to strong acoustic-ish minds was that my own mind and playing were significantly stronger at the end of the teens than they had been at the end of the aughts — a happy and unexpected outcome for a fellow approaching his dotage. Moreover, I was getting better networked among the grassers. I noticed that if someone recorded one of my tunes, it was usually a bluegrasser, which got me to thinking that I could make a contribution to the genre — everybody played and sang great, obviously, but most wrote lyrics a little unsurely, in my view. It entered my thinking that if I delayed doing a bluegrass project for many more years, chances were I would be diminished in my skills, and others dead. Come to think of it, that animates most of my projects: what resources are to hand right now that might not be later? Relationships wax and wane, people give up music and go into retirement or start preaching, vocal ranges constrict, and so forth.\n\nBluegrass Vacation was like the Heaven’s Gate of records. It went way over in both money and time, mainly because of sars-cov-2, which descended about two months before we were scheduled to start. It turns out that LA and Nashville are very far apart. Travelling back and forth, rescheduling sessions cancelled at the last minute, and collating the A-players’ schedules made for woeful inefficiencies. A darker reason for the slow pace: some of the early tunes we tracked were…well, the word “dead” comes to mind, particularly since Alison Brown said it while hearing a song played back. “What do you hear as the problem with this?” I asked the players in the control room. “It’s dead,” she loudly volunteered. Bearing up under blunt criticism isn’t always instinctual, but putting more dead music into the world is just uncalled-for, so I received the analysis gladly; I needed to correct course, for I had created a small pile of corpses. Sometimes I had written a bad song without knowing it. Other times I had directed a good song into a cul-de-sac, and the whole thing needed a do-over with different casting and more sensitive (or laconic) direction. It’s wild how much of the basics you can still be learning, forty-plus years after entering your first recording studio. Every time I try making a record, fresh problems arise that I never anticipated, and this time they sprouted up like weeds. So much didn’t proceed as planned. Air fare, hotels, time, money…hopefully the Coen Brothers will use “Silverlake Reel” to underscore a comic chase scene and I’ll be back in the black.\n\nI had written three songs with the tenor singing of my friend Ron Spears in mind. Scott Simontacchi and I drove out to Ron’s place in Joelton and got the arrangements going, but soon afterward Ron fell ill and was hospitalized. At that point I scotched two of the tunes, which to me were inconceivable without him, and asked Randy Kohrs to come in and sing on the third. (Thanks, Randy.) Right before release, Ron died. The usual thing to do here is say, Therefore this is dedicated to Ron Spears. But that dedication is actually going to land on another project coming out soon, a tenth-anniversary edition of my record Gone Away Backward.\n\nSumming up: global pandemic, non-local recording, scheduling challenges, artistic screw-ups, death. And one more goddam thing: the label that was going to put this out dropped away midway through, so I had to refigure the release platform, on the fly. (Thanks, Alison.) If you take three years instead of the usual six months to make a record, a lot of the world will just change around you as you go, seems to be the lesson. Martin Amis’s remark that on a book tour you’re an employee of your former self always rang true with me. Under normal conditions, going out to sing songs written four or more years prior and recorded bit by bit over a three-year period would require a rather determined adjustment of consciousness. Here in April 2023, though, I’m so bored of sitting home and avoiding social contact that the prospect of a run of shows is positively energizing, almost regardless of what the songs are.\n\nHelping me through the fog was the veteran engineer Dave Sinko. Dave started out doing live sound for Don Williams and (assuming he dies doing it) will finish with the Punch Brothers. I tried a song with him a few years back for a Mose Allison tribute record, recording at Jack Clement’s historical spot, now called Sound Emporium. I was very happy with the room and the mix and the speed of everything, and returned to the Emporium + Sinko combo model to work on Brennen Leigh’s record Prairie Love Letter in, I think, 2018. That chain of events reminds me a little of 2003, when I had worked on a Johnny Paycheck tribute record in Nashville with King Williams engineering and heavy guys like Lloyd Green and Redd Volkaert playing; afterward I couldn’t stop thinking, Man, I want to do that again, but with me writing and singing the songs. Selfish! Anyway, that was close to what happened again here. After making music with Dave at the board and with Dennis Crouch, Shad Cobb, Matt Flinner, and Noam Pikelny accompanying me, I wanted to repeat the fun but without material written by Mose or Brennen, as good as those songs are. When you go off to try and write songs, anticipating that sort of player firepower really “puts a boot in your ass,” to quote Toby Keith in an altered context.\n\nOne Glass of Whiskey is a light tune carried by loosely connected thoughts and I don’t think I can say much about it beyond that. Love all the playing here, particularly Ronnie’s easygoing-yet-driving right hand and Dennis’s ride up the neck on the 4th verse. A lot of the magic and mystery of bluegrass is in the oft-mentioned drive. Past the lifetimes of guys like Monroe and Crowe, it’s folkloric knowledge that lives on in the bodies and impulses of people like the ones playing here. I wrote “One Glass” not long after moving to Los Angeles where, in contradiction of the stereotypical view of LA held by people like I was before moving there, I sit on my porch many mornings and watch horses run across a field with a view of the mountain behind them. Originally I had the bridge lyric as “I reach for the first man I see.” But when I played the tune in NYC in March 2020, in a fetid basement venue with the pandemic looming, Madeleine Peyroux said the line sounded fishy to her. So I changed “man” to “friend,” a change for the better and thank you Ms. P.\n\nThe storyline of Molly and the Old Man was a flight of fancy with a moral thrust. I had a friend in high school called Jesse Thompson, whose dad Tommy played in the Red Clay Ramblers, a band everyone loved. Jesse’s mom had died young, and Tommy’s house was a place where, as I remember anyway, the door was always unlocked and instruments were always easy to grab. Jesse and I sang duos together now and then, especially Jimmie Rodgers’s “Any Old Time.”\n\nNow, scene change to thirty-some years later on the main island of Hawaii, where I was talking to a middle-school class about my musical formation. It both impressed and depressed me to find myself struggling to explain this culture of a shared repertoire and familial living-room singing to Hawaiians — so much incredible music was within easy grasp of these kids, in their heritage and in their midst — while by contrast the class was instantly clued-in when I brought up Michael Jackson of Gary, IN. It drove home for me how fortunate I had been to learn music as an in-person activity, and not just as a passive-listening, hero-worshipping pastime. It also clarified that I should devote my life and work to representing that older way. Back on the mainland, I started focusing a lot more on not thinking about records while playing music, but listening with my ears to what was really happening. This all falls into the category of Obvious Stuff That Chance Events Restore To The Front Of Your Brain.\n\nI tried to make a song out of some of these thoughts with “Molly,” imagining that Jesse and I had grown up and gotten married (sorry Jesse, and sorry Donna) and were passing down to our kid the wisdom and the music that Tommy had given us. So the first half of the tune is mostly true, and the second half’s story events, after the modulation, are all made up. The idea is that people and places disappear, sadly and hauntingly, but meanwhile, music persists as an ongoing, vibrating, connective thread. Nice thought!\n\nThere’s an earlier version of Lonely Ain’t Hardly Alive that I recorded for a Bloodshot sampler, but I thought I’d do it again with a different cast (except for the mighty Shad Cobb, who’s on both). I don’t think it leaves any doubt about my affection for Jimmy Martin’s uptempo 3/4 wanna-kill-yourself songs. My good friend Don Stiernberg suggested the 2 minor chord in place of the 4 at the end of the chorus, which makes a nice variation on the norm, and another good friend, Mike Fredrickson, gave me the idea that women rebound from romantic heartache easier than men. It was great to finally do something with the frighteningly gifted Randy Kohrs.\n\nAngels Carry Me has a lot of meaning for me, since it’s largely autobiographical. I wrote the first verse on a songwriting getaway in the desert, and it stared back at me combatively: \"Anything to add, genius?” When a verse ends “And that’s how I became…” the path forward is hard to see. I was just just four lines in and already had three huge, disparate themes in play: rural loneliness, rock-star worship, and father-son tension. My heart sank as I imagined trying to keep these unlike balls in the air for three more minutes; I couldn’t imagine how to unite the themes or steer toward some endpoint. But after a few weeks of two-steps-forward-one-step-back, pushing through three verses, two bridges, and epilogue (a sectional piece I had never tried), I have to admit I fell in love with the song. The moral in the last line is so apt that it surprised me to think I didn’t have it pre-made and in view while I was writing the rest of it. Two songs helped me move forward when I was stuck: Jesse Winchester’s recording of Stoney Edwards’s “Seems Like Only Yesterday” (with its fast-changing slides of farmhouse scenes) and Paul Simon’s masterly song “Darling Lorraine,” which varies between tender and tough movements to tell a decades-long, emotionally multihued story. I should have mentioned that as I headed to the desert, I listened to Sierra Hull’s records, with the deliberate intention to write a song that she would feel and color in like no one else — in that way, too, the song fulfilled my hopes for it.\n\nLonghair Bluegrass is another real-life song. I didn’t realize back when I idolized NGR that it was a band with a leader. But of course it was, and that Sam’s path and mine have intersected once every few years for the last 25 (usually, when I pay him to come play with me) has been one of my life’s great pleasures. The scene overall has gotten a lot less parochial — kinder and gentler, I’d say — since I was the age in this song. Sam and his Boomer brethren irritated some of the first-generation players, with their fresh take on the music, and their, uh, grooming. But they played and sang with such prodigiousness that no one could expel or deny them. Sharp skills (measured by fluency, speed, and historicity) on one of six different instruments are a ground-level criterion for entry into the field, and for that reason among others, bluegrass emphasizes how you behave and look way less than how you play and sing. Surely every meaningful music style has that selection mechanism whirring within it somewhere. So unfortunately for the first-generation skeptics, the internal logic was all in Sam’s favor. It’s obvious that the force of his huge personality, infectiously full of brains, humor, and loving attention to other humans, has done a whole lot to loosen up and expand Bluegrassland, maybe more than any other single personality has. Alison Brown plays banjo on this one. She has that calmer-than-a-Hindu-cow approach to banjoistic envelope-pushing that has been a thing since Béla Fleck, since Bill Keith before him really, and I love how she expresses her reckless edge here without breaking a sweat.\n\nBackwater Blues is one of those lightweight tunes that I sometimes write as a release-valve while working on harder songs. The inspirations that got me off and running are absurdly unrelated: a Dave Edmunds riff, an Emily Dickinson poem, and a retired guy’s house in Florida where Shad and I played in 2020. (Emily has been a staunch go-to for me for many years — the first line of this song is a direct steal.) I knew right away I wanted to play it with Chris Eldridge and Todd Phillips; they’re great at helping me sound groovier than I am.\n\nTitles that are women’s names come easy to me, and Sweet Li’l Cora-Mae is the latest of those. I also enjoy singing duos with women, with their encouraging attitudes and their high voices. Nora O’Connor and Brennen Leigh are two of my faves. It’s hard to feel discouraged, or to sing very out-of-tune, with them around. I did one “Cora-Mae” with Nora and Robbie Gjersoe for my thumb-drive release Revenge of the Doberman, and this somewhat different two-banjo version with Brennen here. I can’t think of very many recordings with two clawhammers working together, and I’m not sure how it would work if one wasn’t Fred and the other Ginger, so to speak. There’s limits to the possible moves, and a lot of ways you can step on each other. On this one, I’m Ginger and Shad is Mary Ann.\n\nSome original bluegrass instrumentals with flat-3s, B-section modulations, around-the-horn progressions, and other modest kinks started popping up around the late Fifties — a gesture away from the blues and toward Tin Pan Alley, perhaps, or just a more experimental attitude. I’m not a musicologist so don’t quote me on that. I’m thinking about Jesse McReynolds’s “Stoney Creek,” and Frank Wakefield’s “New Camptown Races,” stuff like that. These were in my mind when I made up Silverlake Reel, over in Dan Harmon’s office at the Starburns building in Burbank. Starburns was the production house of my friend Dino Stamatopoulos and I thank him for letting me squat in the building for a season.\n\nIt was a thrill getting to meet Jerry Douglas the day we recorded “Silverlake.” His flurry of notes on the 9th bar of his break on Ricky Skaggs’s version of “Little Cabin Home On The Hill” blew my mind in 1979. Nobody in our extended family except me and my dad were into the grass and so I have very specific memories of 4 or 5 occasions when I’d put on a record and galvanize the grays. When I cranked up Ricky’s Sweet Temptation LP my grandparents filed like sheep into the living room and sank into the sofa, flummoxed. It was Ricky’s unbelievable voice, of course, but also the solos of Tony Rice and Jerry, who were both like Chuck Yeager, breaking the sound barrier. There are these ultra-rare instrumentalists before whom a way and speed of playing seem impossible, and after whom it seems self-evidently doable, with a number of people doing it and taking it even further.\n\nNashville Blues is the only thing on the record I didn’t make up, and to be frank, even though the Delmores are on the copyright, they didn’t exactly make it up either. Going back to Arkansas and somebody stole that gal I had are what the eggheads call common tropes, and I think this was true in 1936 too. What was original to the brothers, and a sort of originality more important in music than word-strings, was their style — their delivery (jazzy yet deadpan), their extreme creativity in vocal harmony (thirds, fifths, unison, crossovers, the works), and Rabon’s fast ’n’ fluid 4-string guitar playing. Tim O’Brien and I talked a little about the particular pattern of responsorial and simultaneous singing they used on “Nashville Blues,” but we ended up mindlessly doing something a little different…which is basically the folk method, right? Mindlessness. What a blast to play music with these two! David’s solo is one of my favorites of his on any record — so glad it ended up on mine. I asked him between takes what kind of pick he used, and he said, “A pick that somebody dropped behind a dressing-room couch.” Doc Watson was my gateway to the Delmores, as to Burnett & Rutherford, Carson Robison, Mississippi John Hurt, and a number of others. My conception of all those people’s music, whether I’m playing it or thinking about it, is filtered through Doc, whose style started worming into my grey matter a couple days after I was born, once I was over my pique about having the tip of my penis cut off. The folk method can be quite cruel.\n\nMomma’s Eyes is a type of song I’ve felt more at liberty to try my hand at as I’ve grown older — a sentimental ballad about family, change, and loss. Ten years ago I started to notice how many people around my age were dealing with their parents’ slowly fading away, and how the sadness and stress affected all involved. Inferring from my personal circle, I figured about every tenth or fifteenth person out there has been saddled with this situation. It sounds to me like my singing betrays some self-consciousness, as I faced my friend Brennen and sang these naked lyrics. I like how Scott played the guitar. I had heard he was a good guitarist, but since he works with me as a mandolinist and singer, I hadn’t heard him play, until we started tracking this. Lucky that worked out.\n\nThe narrative (such as it is) of Let The Old Dog In has just enough relation to real life to be alarming. Before Covid-19 I had a small habit of returning a little loopy in the wee hours from this bar in Los Feliz called The Drawing Room, where I’d go Sunday nights to sing karaoke and goof off with friends. Donna really would’ve been justified in bolting the door, but she never did. Because of downstream covid effects (i.e. the songs I had slotted and the cast I had in mind to play them were disrupted shortly before the session date), I had this incredible group of players providentially in place, and ended up tracking “Old Dog” and the Silverlake instrumental instead of what had been planned. It was a triumphant day for me (you can hear some of my elation during the soloing) because it now seemed clear that despite all the setbacks, I was working on a good record. As I said to Critter later that night (he was there that day mostly because “Old Dog” was too fast for me to play), I hadn’t felt such a jolt of pure delight at playback for many years. Recordings like this are for me expensive souvenirs of memorable occasions.\n\nIt was pretty late in life that I started frailing. About 15 years back, while traveling through North Carolina, I stopped in the town of Zebulon at a banjo shop I’d heard about. There aren’t many all-banjo shops, and this one went out of business a few years later. It was like a dream — dozens of beautiful handmade banjos from makers all over the US hanging on the walls. I had a price ceiling in mind of $2,000. After an hour of playing it came down to two instruments, a bright-sounding low-set one made by Doc Huff of Dallas, Oregon and a mellower, higher-set one with a deeper scoop made by Chuck Lee of Ovilla, Texas. I settled on Chuck’s (with case it was just a bit over my price ceiling) and soon began torturing those around me, including paying audiences, with my clumsy beginner playing. I wish I could have spared everyone and begun at an intermediate level. The only way to proceed was to keep at it and set goals — learn tunes, practice patterns, and test myself by occasionally playing in public. For lessons I used DVDs and banjo-playing friends. Ed Tverdek said, “Imagine you’re cradling an egg.” Danny Barnes said, “The one big rule is, no upstrokes.” Michael Miles said, “Make a skeleton of the tune, don’t go crazy filling it in.” Mike Merenda, a noted liar, said, “You’re doing fine.”\n\nScruggs-style and clawhammer have zero in common in right-hand technique, and the left-hand commonalities reduce a bit too, once you take it out of open-G tuning. I had some three-finger from an early age, but that was of little use now. To get the hang of the right-hand clawing motion took four or five years of embodiment, of reducing the role of the conscious mind. It also took some trial-and-error to figure out what to do about my right-hand index nail, which was short and recessed from flatpicking. These days, when I have a period of banjoing ahead of me, I go to the salon and get an extension, sitting there among the desperate housewives of suburbia. The nail lasts about six weeks, during which flatpicking is slightly cumbersome but frailing is much easier. Isn’t this interesting?\n\nI’ve written only three or four songs on my Chuck Lee, and Old Time Music Is Here To Stay is one. The melody seemed to emerge naturally from C-tuning; I don’t think I’d have made it up on guitar, or in open G on banjo, either one. The main 8-bar cadence interested me as soon as I heard it, I think because of the concept of contour, which stayed in my head after reading This Is Your Brain On Music many years back. A gently sloping series of notes, like the shape of a mountain ridge. Prokofiev positioned staff notes in a visual pattern corresponding to mountain silhouettes when he was scoring Alexander Nevsky. Following intuitions of math embedded in nature is one way to make music happen. I think it’s also a helpful way to keep the abstractions that infest musical thought rooted in the observable world, since things like contour, pitch, and cyclical events are natural phenomena, not just arid music-school concepts. (Not that those concepts, arid or otherwise, are available to an unschooled guy like me.)\n\nThis is another real-life song — the thoughts and opinions and memories are mine. I mean, I didn’t literally plug my ears and run away from banjos when I was a teenager, but I did have the unproductive idea that I’d learn to play electric guitar and join my peers in going ga-ga over the popular music of the moment. It was unproductive because it was a herd instinct that led nowhere in particular; I never got too good on that pricey Telecaster which now gathers dust in my closet. I’m actually better at clawhammer banjo, and I’ve only been doing that for 15 years now. Something’s the matter with me — I just can’t get comfortable with the Rolling Stones or U2 or hiphop the way I can get with banjo music. But if “Old Time Music” is right, who knows, maybe in 200 years people will be relating to “I’m Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes” and “Blue Ridge Cabin Home” more than to “Brown Sugar” or Pink Lady. Electric guitars might give way to computers, as seems to be happening now, but the mountains will still be right there.\n\nAt this point the pandemic has produced a closed circle of thoughts in this worker, beginning March 15, 2020: Get me out of here, gee but it’s great to be back home, I wonder what it would be like to venture out again, let’s give it a try, oh God I’m sick and coughing get me home, home is pleasant, home is a little too pleasant, home is boring, I miss playing music and connecting with strangers, get me out of here. A thing I should probably be ashamed to admit is that, during lockdown, I missed doing interviews and gabbing about myself. It does offer potential rewards beyond ego-stroking. Having to explain your own motives can sharpen your thinking, and the perspective of sympathetic non-musicians on your work, past and present, can be illuminating.\n\nI just wrapped up a long interview with a distinguished elder of music journalism, and you can read the results a few weeks down the line. By long I mean: somewhere near five hours on Zoom, plus an hour or so of emailing. An investment on both ends but mostly his. The gentleman was not only distinguished and sympathetic, he was informed and quick-witted. We enjoyed each other’s company, I think. It interests me, looking back on the chat, that the line between us sometimes went fuzzy on the subject of money. “How much did you spend on this record?” “How much of your income comes from road work?” “How did you attract so many high-reputation players to the new record - did they lower their rates for you?” And various questions regarding my career “trajectory” that also had an economic hue — like the presumption that rational, self-interested forward thinking is involved in imagining and planning future music projects. Sort of? Not exactly? Still, that’s an entirely reasonable assumption, and all of these questions are, if a little pointed, also reasonable to ask.\n\nI get the feeling in talking to non-musicians that figuring out where to land, on the spectrum between music-making as an occupation as economically grounded as any other and music-making as a priestly, passion-centered calling that plays out in a realm above grubby calculating self-interest, isn’t at all simple or intuitive. Evidently inclining to the second view is a Finnish popular music academic I had a recent and somewhat testy exchange with. “I’m very skeptical of claims that incentives spur creativity,” he wrote me, in response to a question about how twentieth-century broadcasting has influenced songwriters’ work. “Is he nuts?” I thought. How many areas of life aren’t influenced, even primarily influenced, by economic incentives? It does strip the joy out of music appreciation to focus on who paid Beethoven to do what, or on the apparent injustice of people as highly skilled as J.D. Crowe doing straight jobs while no-account jackasses like fill-in-the-blank eat catered food in private planes. However, you can get fruitlessly lost in these thoughts without access to specific data which, generally speaking, the music business works hard to keep out of our grasp — hence the sorts of questions I listed above, as asked me by my gentleman. “How many records do you sell on average?” he actually asked me, and I actually answered. I may come to regret this.\n\nOnce, at a Cannibal Corpse show, I found myself looking at the doughy forty-somethings doing their Cookie Monster yowling and thinking about what they got paid and whether an easier line of work was perhaps not available for the sum. I estimated the audience size and the artist net after expenses such as promoter percentage and agency commission, multiplied by 100 (the number of shows in a year), and divided by five, which I think was the number of people on stage. “$70,000 per annum, before taxes!” I thought. It was more pleasant doing this mental math than listening to the music. But as soon as I escaped the racket and stepped onto the sidewalk, it hit me how ill-grounded my math was, and how equally likely it was that at least one of the guys on stage earned three times as much as I had estimated — or half. The privacy of contracts and private patronage are just two factors that keep us from knowing.\n\nI have one son who is above-averagely rational, good at math, and interested in money. This grants me an ongoing connection with a mindset that looks at music as a rational, economic endeavor, and in doing so sometimes hits a wall. I have another son who plays music professionally with an up-and-coming group, making very little money at it. “Why is he doing that?” son A asks me about son B. Not long ago we had a conversation about the layout of the current American music-biz landscape — touring, promotion, intellectual property rights — and the incentives and carve-outs of the various actors — club owners, festival promoters, management, booking agencies. We talked about how son B’s low wages were justified (temporarily) by realism about what the others in the band were earning (very little) and also about what the band’s future prospects looked like (very good). “I’ve learned more about this business in the last 10 minutes of conversation than I’ve learned in the last 30 years,” said A. Well, I don’t have anything like a scholarly perspective, but I have a good grasp on the frame, based on how it feels from inside it.\n\nSince the era of feudalism ended, and the Schumanns and Brahmses were thrown into the marketplace to fend for themselves, fame and wealth have entered into the musical life as potential outcomes and therefore as potential goals. Obviously, the sort of fame that keeps you from walking into a diner, and the kind of wealth that lets you buy an apartment in Manhattan, don’t enter into the lives of over 99% of musical workers. But the fraction of us who do achieve that much economic power creates a Jupiter-like distortion of the field. In our present-day field: young craftspeople like my son make crazy sacrifices with no assured end; businesses, well aware of the “passion” narrative (“I’m in it for the sheer love of it, wheeee!”) and the related willingness to work cheap or even pay to work, routinely demand those crazy sacrifices; music fans routinely apply economic presuppositions to their evaluations of singers, writers, and bands. How is it that less-famous person X comes to interact professionally with famous person Y? If you’re as good as you seem, why aren’t you more famous? You can’t possibly be wealthy, so how specifically do you go about making a living year after year, and how do you make sure that everything won’t collapse in the next one? There’s a good deal of confusion threaded into questions like these.\n\nIn a better world, all of our music would be taken in without anyone asking these questions ceaselessly, or idly musing as I did during the Cannibal Corpse show, which, though only 45 minutes long, seemed to go the length of a Blue Note box set. That world wouldn’t be better for the millions of listeners who get added pleasure from knowing that their partisanship puts them inside a social phenomenon that magnetizes a large and fervent paying crowd to a revered, iconic entertainer. Just better for mopes like me who would much prefer a line of communication with listeners unfettered by distracting calculations. We’re sincerely trying to create a calculation-free zone here — in today’s money-mad world, that’s a great value that music offers, an escape room, a place of sensual delight or sacred contemplation.\n\nThat, as it happens, is the selfsame zone that we create for ourselves, here inside our collegial frame. “Come to the picking party tonight,” a friend texted me last year, “Mike Judge is going to stop by, as well as one of the Foo Fighters.” “I can come,” I texted back, “but I don’t care who else comes as long as they can play okay.” I think I wrote that out loud, so to speak, to remind myself that, although the name-dropping added some prospective tension to the situation as I imagined the party ahead, I shouldn’t be thinking about it. There’s an official in-group philosophy: whatever handicap your economic power and reputation grant you in non-musical life, that ends as soon as the music starts. At that point, all that matters is the singing and playing — the communicating with one another. Moreover, the official decorum in groups that integrate non-famous and famous musicians is that either a) we treat each other with ordinary human consideration, conversing naturally and non-strategically, or b) the famous ones go even farther, self-awarely extending a tad more consideration to the non-famous, expressing kind interest in their lives and thoughts and so forth. When these unwritten rules are breached, and people start throwing their weight around and acting weird, the party is over.\n\nI’m in a position to notice the little courtesies of my economic betters, since there are so many of them. When I’m backstage bantering with a better known artist, or picking the bluegrass with someone of eminence (whether they’re bluegrassers or not), it unfailingly gives me a wonderful feeling when they ask about my family or invite a musical opinion. Thank you, sire, the children are prospering! Music-making tends to create a special zone outside of social reality, within which we’re not segregated by income or public reputation; we fall into our roles as members of the same guild, approximate peers. I try, with God knows what level of success, to behave in a natural human way back to them. Last weekend my friend and I bumped into a lady at a coffeeshop whose music I’ve loved since the late 1980s. Since it was the night of the Grammys, we small-talked about how it was hard to get snacks at the Staples Center, then talked for a moment about our common love of dogs. When I walked away, I thought about how strange and great it was to be a musician, a field in which two sixty-year-olds who have never met can greet one another amicably and palaver like college chums. Neither of us said, “What was your nomination for? Didja win?” And I didn’t say, “Holy fuck, is it good to meet you — why, I have a long imaginary relationship with you!” We talked about dogs and snacks.\n\nMore name-dropping — not all these encounters go so well, on my end. Last year there was a multi-act tribute to the late John Prine, and Emmylou Harris was on stage just after me. She and I have brief interactions every 15 years or so, and I always ruin them somehow. This time, I walked off stage and she said, “That was really good.” Isn’t that a nice remark? Who cares if it’s even completely sincere, it’s a nice gesture; but all I could do was to hastily mumble, “Yeah, it’s a great song,” deflecting her compliment with feigned carelessness. Yeah, yeah, Emmylou, shows what you know, the song was good not me. Fifteen years ago I said something very similar to her, and fifteen years before that, I won’t even go into…\n\nForget hierarchies. Think instead about the make-believe-land of equality. I’d like to invite people who don’t make music into the musicians’ created zone of economic not-mattering. It clears up a lot. What is Bruce Springsteen doing, fraternizing with Joe Grushecky? How does Joe acclimate to such validation from Bruce, and by the way, doesn’t Bruce understand that this is just a fellow we go see at bars and chat with after the set? In order to make good music, we put all those anxieties aside, at least while we’re in the room with one another trying to make it happen. If you put music at or near the top of your list of values, then the not-mattering, the peer-to-peer mentality, is more of a reality than the income and reputational differentials, which could change, even reverse, in a very short time. The music outlasts the people.\n\nI’m putting out this record in April where there are a lot of Springsteens to my Grushecky! How did I get them to be on the record, and what did I pay them? 1. I called them and asked, 2. as little as I thought I could get away with. No mystery there. Their participation might imply — probably does imply — some appreciation of my skill (a validation that means a lot to me). No doubt they didn’t mind being paid either. Despite what academics might think, music doesn’t just glide along on magic, goodwill, and charity.\n\nMy unasked-for advice to you, dear listener, with regard to the spectrum I mentioned, is to avoid the tail-ends in order to get the clearest take on what’s happening within music. Money matters, a bit. It’s good at setting things into motion. Getting Emmylou Harris on a boat, getting people to sit for three hours without a snack. I certainly need money just to get off the couch and go to work, and my sweet son is going to need quite a lot more if he’s to have a family like I did, and get off of a filthy futon in Queens. Not that there aren’t many things I’d happily do with zero financial incentive. In fact the list is very, very long. Drive to Woodstock to have coffee with Annette Peacock. Fly to Vienna to talk for an hour with Gerhard Kubik. Sing for 14 hours straight at a charity fundraiser for homeless people. That’s the problem, though — do one or two of those things and before you know it you’re so deep in the red you have to pray for 10 corporate whoring opportunities just to dig yourself out.\n\nThe money someone will pay you to perform, to be blunt about it, is a useful indicator of — not what you’re “worth,” perish the silly thought, but how many people within about 60 miles of that place are interested in your act and how much they’ll pay to see it. That more people are more interested in seeing other people’s shows is a fact I’ve gradually gotten comfortable with, mostly because it’s out of my control. But if I’m making considerably more or less money than last year, that is a fact that interests me very much. What here needs adjusting? I want my life and work to be on a progressive path, and on the path, I’m competing only with myself.\n\nOnce I’ve started playing, I’m not thinking about what I’m being paid — and I hope you’re not either. I also hope that, after the show’s over, you continue not thinking about it. I hope you don’t fret about my meager income or the alleged injustice of my not being better known. It doesn’t take much reflection to understand, as I believe most musicians do, even the rich and famous ones, that status and income don’t correlate — at all — to talent or worth. I’m not saying that self-interestedly, because of my rank (honest!). Do you think the best restaurant at the airport is the one with the longest line? That Harlan Coben writes the best books and Herman Melville wrote some of the worst? Be serious. When I was a kid, I idolized a lot of people who drove around and played for small groups in small rooms. Now I’m one of them — surprise! (If my next release sells 8 million, by the way, I’m buying a ranch in Santa Monica and revising all these opinions.)\n\nIt’s hard to sort through some of these issues. Keeping some prestige and mystique around oneself is useful. Easier just to dodge the econ talk politely. Dye your hair black, jump on stage, show your incredible hysterical love for music, crawl off to the promoter and sign your W9, take your miserable check, and be on your merry way. But since I get these repeated questions from journalists, whether delicately or pointedly, and since money’s on all our minds, so much as to cloud thinking, I wanted to give my…two cents? Aren’t my thoughts worth more? Anyway, I invite you to let music carry you off into higher realms where princes are eye to eye with paupers.\n\nAlthough you should repress the urge to write an essay every time someone dies, I can’t resist putting something out there about my friend Rick Will. He was a lavishly gifted audio engineer and a delightfully odd duck. Because his high intelligence and competencies were overlaid with stoner mannerisms and some pointlessly profane antics, one was sometimes unsure whether to revel in his company, learn from his wisdom, or fear for his health; but two out of three were blessings he extruded wherever he went, and the third was something inscrutable, his private thing with which to struggle.\n\nRick engineered and co-produced my third solo record (Let’s Kill Saturday Night), back in 1998. I met him after many long, tiresome months of scouting candidates for the job. I had just stepped up from the indies to the majors, and my company’s non-negotiable demand was that I collaborate with a “producer” -- someone with an approved résumé and an established history of delivering commercially plausible recordings within a modest budget. I understood this rationale totally, and even halfway understood why they didn’t want me working with the engineers from my previous two records, but that restriction made for more of a challenge than I anticipated. I went through one candidate after another, upwards of 100 of them. For various reasons nothing was working out.\n\nIn March that year I had dinner with Jay Joyce in Nashville. Jay is now a prominent mainstream producer; at the time he was in a noisy and fun band called Iodine, and was a respected figure in an outsider-ish Southern scene. He didn’t think he was the right person for my project, or maybe I didn’t, I can’t recall; but he mentioned Rick’s name. A glance at his history showed a truly promising variety -- Rick had recorded or mixed Johnny Cash, Junior Brown, Tim Finn, No Doubt, and Nine Inch Nails; assisted Don Gehman and T Bone Burnett; produced Amy Correia and Joseph Arthur; was himself in some sort of a metal band. He had started in Nashville back in the mid-1980s when Mary Tyler Moore’s production outfit branched out into music. MTM had a few of the more interesting acts of the time, such as Foster and Lloyd, of whom the latter was my dear friend, and Rick’s as well. So there were several promising threads there. (The T Bone thread alone got my interest -- he was one of the 100, someone I desired most hotly but who was just as hotly undesired at the label. “Why in the world do you want him?” said Roberta, the A&R head, as if I’d suggested hiring a circus monkey. Interestingly, Rick’s more formative experiences, at least his earlier ones, came from working under Don Gehman. “He taught me all about compression,” Rick remarked, “how you have to learn it very deeply, because compression can ruin a record but the exactly right kind in the exact right amount makes it fly.”)\n\nI went to his house, a somewhat secluded property in the hills off West End Avenue, on Love Circle. We sat for an hour in his music-listening room, and he issued vague-sounding thoughts about music recording and scribbled on a legal pad. What was he scribbling, what was he saying? I couldn’t have told you two days later. I just remember thinking: if I didn’t know what this fellow had provably done, I’d have written him off as the kind of sad sack who wanders on beaches and mumbles. I then reflected that I had known people throughout the years who were deeply smart but presented themselves as a little mixed-up -- artistic misfits. So I gave myself a pat on the back for not being thrown off track, and informed the label the next day that I had my man.\n\nThe next six months were an extreme period in my life, mentally and actively, and I can’t think of a way around the dumb phrase “emotional roller-coaster.” At times I thought of myself as a helpless loose fragment in a churning imploding mechanism, and at others as a character in a scripted drama with a smallish cast of whom Rick was one of the two or three leading players. But self-dramatizing metaphors aside, what Rick ended up offering me amid that turmoil, in terms of general wisdom, specific production ideas, and positive thinking, not only helped me bridge a rough patch but left me with sharp permanent tools that I’ve been able to draw on in my ongoing effort to make music that sounds good and means something.\n\nThis week I went back and forth about whether to write anything about Rick. The first things that occurred to me, after hearing of his death, were a small number of outlandish acts that, if I put them on the Internet, would risk upsetting people who loved him and casting both of us in a decidedly bad light. I don’t know what he was like before or after I knew him (we almost scheduled a get-together when in 2017 I visited Australia, where he had moved, but sadly missed one another), but in the 1990s he straddled a lonely characterological fence, between hippie good-vibe and punk-rock agitation. There was an engaging ambiguity in him -- “I love everybody” vs. “Fuck everybody” -- but there was definitely an “everybody.” Maybe that’s an ornate excuse for immature behavior. But the more I thought about him, the more I came to think that my attention was training too tightly on a few vivid anecdotes. Just as someone’s recent death needn’t demand a brushing away of thorns, neither does it do the life any relevant justice to grab at them and punishingly pierce our hands. I’m sure we all want not just to be forgiven -- a tough ask -- but to live in conditions of minimal pain. Rick’s life, in its fuller rendering, was guided by precepts that were warm-hearted, creative, and observable. Below are a few of them, along with backup evidence.\n\nBe 14\n\n“Fourteen! Fourteen!” he’d yell, jumping manically on a filthy couch in the room at S.I.R. where the band I and ran songs during preproduction week. Just the single word, and at first we were mystified as to what he was possibly getting at. Rick’s operating theory, we soon learned, was that music should always be played, and much of life lived, as though one were frozen into fourteenness.\n\nAt 14, let the record show, I had already begun acting like a cartoonishly old person (opinionated, short-tempered, martini-holding, contemptuous of youth culture). However, that’s not what Rick meant. He meant to be open to impulse, passion’s plaything, not notably professional in attitude, unsnobbish, intensely immersed in art, feverishly in love, and high. Not my approach to life at all; but in the specific field of music performance, these ideas do start to become much more salient.\n\nDuring preproduction, Rick came to feel that my band wasn’t up to snuff and might have to be fired. “They play like they’re 35, and they’re tired, and they’ve been playing in bars a real long time,” he said to me privately one morning, five days in. His tone was gentle but grave. “It’s not working. It’s not good enough. We can start over again with some great players I can call in. I know these guys are your friends, but it’s your record, not theirs, and it’s not worth the risk.” Panicking, my first thought was a short list of excuses. We were, in fact, 35-year-old bar musicians. What else would we sound like? Also, we had driven ten hours through a tornado the day before preproduction began, Chicago to Nashville, trying to follow the course of the wind from news reports, threading our way down I-65 among wrecked cars, pulling over to jump out and hide in culverts now and then. I was jittery and a little worn down. And what’s more, if I had driven like a 14-year-old, I’d be dead. To me, 35 years old was just fine.\n\nWell, I assembled my little band of washouts and gave them the bad news. They were playing badly, the boss wanted them fired, I had made a plea for leniency and a second chance. Lorne, the bassist, took it stoically and simply said, “We’ve just got to do better, then.” The others nodded in agreement. That’s how much we already trusted Rick’s judgment. Even against our own interests and pride, no one considered that he might be mistaken. (You could say they were interested in keeping their jobs, but believe me, they weren’t being paid enough to be that interested.)\n\nWe did a gig at Douglas Corner on a Monday night, at the end of a day off. It was a nice release and a lot of fun, and we returned to SIR the next morning for more abuse. But happily, Rick reported at day’s end that things sounded better to him. The live show had re-stimulated us, after a tornado and a solid week of trying to pass muster before a beady-eyed judge on a filthy couch. The day was saved and the project continued as planned and as cast. But Rick wasn’t entirely done giving us grief for sounding 15 and up, for we did continue to slip now and then into placid professionalism. Rick just wanted the dials all the way up all the time. It was an uphill climb, yet I felt that it was just what we needed, or at least what I wanted.\n\nThinking it over all these years later, I’m not fully on-board with the teen-spirit dictum. It’s not a tone that’s genre-invariant. Listeners turn to different records for different moods and metabolisms. And there are considerations of personal authenticity. I’m explicitly working from an older-age emotional angle now, and it would create a silly clash to open my face wide and slam my body around while warbling about ancient ghosts or the heartbreak of raising children. Still, I keep Rick’s words close by me as a hedge against complacency. It’s good to get everything routinized, as a benefit of long experience -- travel logistics, getting a stage dressed, daily instrument practice, etc. -- everything except the performing, the music. That needs always to be fresh and in-the-moment. If it isn’t, you begin to lose listener interest, deservedly and immediately. And if you forget what it was like to be 14 and want everything so badly -- if you lose sight of your great good luck in getting to play music for people, in having a song to play and people to listen to it -- then you begin to lose interest in yourself. Cash it in, get a factory job.\n\nembrace adventure\n\nOne day, at Quad studio, Rick and I were tweaking a song (“Take Me To The Paradise”) with a modestly “experimental” section. The last verse was intended to tip into hallucinatory, noir-ish anxiety. “I wish we had a sonic throughline here to underscore the mood I’m after,” I said, or something to that effect; “something like a Blood Sweat & Tears trombone pedal, you know? Suspenseful. But maybe not expressly tonal.” I’ve got a lot of crudely articulated, thrillingly esoteric ideas.\n\nRick did...well, he did a series of things, and I don’t remember where he got all the materials or just how long it took, but it all happened within that session, and it happened directly after I said all that. He got the key to a car that was parked in the lot outside. He got an extension for an XLR cable that ran 70 or 80 feet. Then he attached a 58 or similar cheap microphone to it, and dropped it under the hood of the car. He took some kind of a weight, and jammed it onto the car horn. Then he ran inside and plugged the other end of the cable into the board.\n\nCueing up the song and recording the overdub of the ceaseless car horn a few times while experimenting on the fly with EQ and ambience took, as I recall, 9 or 10 minutes. A brief enough period, but a long time for a studio of placid professionals to listen to a continuous horn from a vehicle parked against the small building there on Grand Avenue. The police were on the scene by minute 9.5, and luckily it was a wrap about 30 seconds later. I don’t recall any apology, just a polite feigned smile and a “we’re trying to do very important work here” attitude from Rick as he unjammed the wheel and unrigged the automobile.\n\nWe did a lot of fun stuff during tracking. One night Rick dropped a dictaphone mic inside a grand piano and I banged around on the wires with a drumstick, to try for a fucked-up gamelan sort of sound.
