        "text": "Over the last few years, I have had the privilege of being able to work with an amazing band. During this time, I have gotten to know them better as musicians and as people and it has truly been an honor. They are a hidden gem, in my opinion. Let me introduce you to the next BIG thing.\n\nKyle and Myles Mendes, Canadian-born twin brothers raised in Dallas, Texas, make up the alternative/electronic-rock duo known as NITE. The Mendes brothers, along with their drummer Phil Helms, are extremely talented musicians, but upon listening to their music for the first time, you might find yourself a bit confused.\n\nStarting in 2013, their first album “I Am Not Afraid” features a lot of dark and moody tracks with lush synthesizers and breathy vocals. Then the following 2 albums, “Reborn” and “Sleepless” delve deep into the synth-pop and dream-pop genres with danceable tracks such as “Dreamer” and “All You’ve Ever Dreamed Of” that really encapsulate that retro 80’s new wave feel that transports you back in time! However, on their latest album “Be Destroyed,” released in September 2023, they shifted in a darker, more industrial direction with their sound, including, but not limited to, tracks like “I Just Want To Be Destroyed,” and their cover of Alice In Chains’ “Would?,” that feature heavier guitars and vocals that lend more to that industrial style of the 90’s and early 2000’s grunge era. Recently though, they have circled back to their roots incorporating more of their earlier synth and electronic elements into their music with their newest singles “Price For Heaven,” and “Our Light Will Never Die”.\n\nCheck out NITE’s newest music video for “Price For Heaven” just dropped on June 19, 2024\n\nNITE.bandcamp.com\n\nTheir sound is eclectic and unique, but that is exactly what I love about them. Their lyrics are very beautifully and eloquently written as well. Their work is original and not one I would confuse with any other band within the same genre. Whenever I hear one of their songs, I know that is a NITE song!\n\nWhat you really need to know about though, are their live performances. These guys are absolutely PHENOMENAL and put on some of the BEST live shows I have ever seen, and I’ve been to a lot of concerts in my 34 years! Their shows are extremely high-energy and once the music hits you, you can’t help but let loose and let the music move you. Not to mention their stage presence… just picture two twin brothers with incredible long curly hair coming out in matching blazers and matching orange Fender guitars. They just look cool! Their shows are honestly so captivating to watch, with their incredible laser light show, their electric energy, and headbanging with their wild curly locks.\n\nAt this point, I have seen them perform almost 50 times in the last 3 and a half years and each time they still manage to blow me away! They always put on a killer performance no matter how many people attend. They feed off the energy from the crowd and are 100% there for the show every time. Anyone can see they really enjoy performing, and any band that is passionate about what they’re doing will perform better.\n\nThere is no comparison seeing them live versus seeing a video of them online, or even just listening to their albums. These two will leave you speechless. If you ever get the opportunity to see them, DO IT. Seeing them perform live is a whole experience of its own and any words I say just won’t do it justice. It’s that powerful.\n\nOne thing people ask me all the time, aside from how I can tell them apart and what hair products they use, is if Kyle and Myles are truly as kind and genuine as they appear to be? The answer is yes, absolutely. I’ve actually known the twins since high school, and they’ve always been exceptionally nice! Many people are so surprised by their kindness that they believe it too good to be true, but I can promise you, they really are that nice.\n\nA big thing that sets them apart, from what I’ve seen, is that they genuinely want to connect with their fans. A lot of bands will play the part and act nice, but don’t really care. NITE is different. NITE really does care. They are always putting in the effort to reply back to comments and messages on social media and stay late at shows to interact with fans and don’t hide out in the back, a noticeable attribute in my opinion. Sending special video clips to international fans, a personal happy birthday video or message to a sick fan that had to miss a show, even offering free merch occasionally to a fan who went out of their way to show support, are just a few examples of their kindness. I really can’t say enough good things about these guys and how exceptional and kind-hearted they are!\n\nThe Mendes twins definitely have something special, there is no doubt about that. Although they have seen a lot of growth in the last few years, I often find myself wondering why they are not bigger than they are. They definitely have the talent, the passion and the drive. They are some of the hardest working people I know, and they deserve to reach their highest musical aspirations. Their big break may not be tomorrow, but I know that day is coming very soon.\n\nNITE has changed my life, and I don’t say that lightly. By knowing them and sharing their music, I have met so many incredible people and have gotten tons of awesome opportunities! Not to mention their music has gotten me through many tough times. I am more than happy to support them knowing they are honestly good people and I wish nothing more than to see them succeed. I feel incredibly lucky to know them and to be able to call them some of my closest and dearest friends.\n\nCheck out NITE and follow them on social media @wearethenite on all platforms! Also check out their website http://www.wearethenite.com for merch and upcoming show dates.\n\nJoin the NITE fan group community on Facebook: ALL-NITERS (NITE Fan Group)\n\n-Angela Alameda (@ohdarling08)\n\nPhoto credit: Top photo by Whitney Hensley\n\nAll other photos by Angela Alameda\n\nYear two of Small’s in Hamtramck’s Fixation Festival happened this past weekend. For the second year in a row Mike Mouyianis and Kat Paled put together an epic bill of legacy/modern darkscene talent both locally and around the country. This city has always celebrated a rich musical culture from Motown, Iggy Pop, The MC 5, techno’s holy trinity, ADULT, along with a slew of new talent in the current wave. Small’s cares about and celebrates artists, while running a tight ship that respects fan’s time. The venue is intimate with a great sound system and professional technician that knows how to communicate and bring out the best in the wide variety of acts. Having the stage and merch in one room, another with the bar for cooler temps, quick service, and a large video screen showing the stage at a volume you can talk over makes for a best of both worlds. Sometimes you want to be right in the action. Sometimes you want to share a moment with friends, making a personal connection with the bands. It has the Cold Waves “goth summer camp” vibe with a smaller more relaxed venue.\n\nI’m going to fire off some quick impressions from of all the bands. Some that are long time favorites, some I saw for the first time. I’ll also include photos from the amazingly talented Jen Jeffery who really captured highlight moments from both nights.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pinknoisepix\n\nHelix – Starting out Friday night strong was the married duo of Mari Shear (Day Twelve, Mari & The Ghost) and Tom Shear (Assemblage 23) firing off blistering electropop with Mari’s powerful, smokey delivery. Her stage show was captivating and serpentine. A beautiful way to set the tone for everything to come.\n\nUnimaginable Place | Helix (bandcamp.com)\n\nRosegarden Funeral Party – Next up was Dallas TX dark rockers Rosegarden Funeral Party who I had previously reviewed for albums and singles. I had never seen them live, this became my favorite surprise of the weekend. Sometimes you really need to see the live show to get a full appreciation of a band. Leah was this glorious guitar sheading silver beam of light belting out lyrics with breath support to do Aretha Franklin proud. Thunderous live drums really his home the organic dark rock roots to give the impression of a wailing full band with only two people. I became an instant fan for life, can’t wait to dig into the new album “From The Ashes” available on bandcamp now.\n\nFrom the Ashes | Rosegarden Funeral Party (bandcamp.com)\n\nego likeness – I remember looking over to Collin right after Leah absolutely obliterated that stage and saying “I feel bad for whoever has to sing after her”. Then I saw it was Donna and went, never mind it’s Donna, she will be fine. With everything Donna and Steven have going (Poetry, Painting, Stoneburner, Audiobooks) sometimes it feels like Ego Likeness shows are a rare and glorious treat. Rick and Mike were here on stage to give the full experience of powerful percussion, wet crunching swamp riffs, and luring siren vocals. There is a reason Ego Likeness has stood the test of time between goth resurgences. Another call out from this performance, you can always tell a special band by how they react when something goes wrong. Tech issues happen, you can either let it under your skin, and lose focus. Or you can let the audience feel like they are a part of the inner circle, pop forward, and hit a higher level than you were when something went wrong. This is what the greats do.\n\nLive to Tell | ego likeness (bandcamp.com)\n\nBootblacks – This was my second time seeing the reinvented suave dark Italian disco Bootblacks sound and they have dialed it all the way in. I’ve seen a trend of bands moving towards this sound, but I think Bootblacks were the first American’s to the peak. The new single “When You Want” highlights the power of pacing change to create constant movement. Panther’s vocals have never felt more present and sensual. This performance had the whole crowd sweating both physically and metaphorically.\n\nWhen You Want | Bootblacks (bandcamp.com)\n\nAssemblage 23 – Tom Shear coming back to the stage for a second performance in one night. This marked another band I have listened to frequently but had never seen perform live. FuturePop fell in that middle place where I had given up on new music and got to re-discover recently. Hearing a top tier male vocalist delivering such crystal clarity free of effects is a powerful experience. Sometimes poetic lyrics feel a bit of an afterthought in the modern era. So hearing heartfelt emotive words delivered with a beautiful voice really stands out. I really need to see Tom play again when he is the focus of the night. Tom did promise to do an interview with me soon, so be on the lookout for that.\n\nMourn | Assemblage 23 (bandcamp.com)\n\nNight Club – I understand that some traditional goth fans don’t really want to embrace the darkpop cross over in the modern scene. I’m not one of them. Night Club was another band I had only reviewed albums of. On stage, they absolutely brought the house down. Sassy, dangerous, with pristine production, setting the stage for Emily’s undeniable star power. I know it when I see it, Night Club is dripping with it. What a way to close out an epic night one. Another of those bands I implore everyone to catch at an intimate venue like Small’s now. It’s won’t be long before main stream audiences catch on.\n\nMasochist | Night Club (bandcamp.com)\n\nAdding this selfie of Amaranth/Stoneburner/Black Rose Burning who will be playing together August 17th in Lancaster PA. An incredible night 1 where we Uber’d back to our Air B & B to crush previously acquired late night food which turned out to be some of the best Thai cuisine I have ever had.\n\nThe Love Part – George Grant (Black Rose Burning) once impressed upon me the importance of festivals including some local flavor in the mix. Night two is where Fixation let some Detroit talent shine. My partner Rachel has exceptional taste in music, so when she came running and dragged me to the stage (something she never does) to hear The Love Part I knew I was in for something wonderful. Swelling psychedlicgaze pastel ectoplasm with great charisma from the singer spinning Curesque romantic energy. I spoke with them a bit after and this was an early show for them. I think this project has a high ceiling. I love that Small’s took a chance on them, I love that they delivered in a big way.\n\nLet It Fall | The Love Part (bandcamp.com)\n\nAccess To Concrete – Another Detroit band that was my highlight surprise of night two. The Stringer brothers put together a full experience multimedia performance that took the best parts of Devo and Front 242 synthesized into chaotic SciFi sonic assault. They had multiple guest vocalists including Steph Strange (Schedule IV) in Nuruto/Tank Girl cosplay and Industrial Alice In Chains. It was fun, it was fury, it left me hungry for more.\n\nThe Robots In The Walls | Access To Concrete (bandcamp.com)\n\nLEATHERS – This was another showstopper highlight. The evolution of Shannon to ultrastar status has been a pleasure to behold. Having to do two sets in a night at this level of energy and precision is a feat within itself. This performance was a shooting star sparkling across the stage. Captivating and razor sleek Leather’s brings an otherworldly late 70’s glam energy that leaves you feeling how am I seeing this? It’s too bright, too beautiful to exist on this mortal realm. Last night they played Cruel World Fest on a stage with Duran Duran/Ministry/ect and I can’t help but feel like a dream realized for Shannon is hope for us all.\n\nCrash | LEATHERS (bandcamp.com)\n\nThe Bellwether Syndicate – Chicago darkscene legends that always rock Detroit like they have something to prove. William Faith (Faith and the Muse, Christian Death, Mephisto Walz, Shadow Project, The March Violets) throws the best rock star looks in the biz. Sara Rose and Philly have enough musical pedigree to fill 10 bands. They really create a mythical beast with gnashing punk rock teeth, a long slender synthpop neck, and expansive sharp post punk wings. Moving together in perfect harmony. It always feels like a complete experience, a big deal, every time they play. Vestige & Vigil is such a good album, I had to buy it twice on LP.\n\nVestige & Vigil | The Bellwether Syndicate (bandcamp.com)\n\nACTORS – How do they do it? How does a band I feel objectively plays one of the best live shows rather in a 300 person capacity club or a festival consistently raise the bar to amaze me? The sound is so sharp, crackling with spirit, engaging the crowd every night until we all leave feeling a part of something special. Some might think I sound crazy saying this, but in 6 short years since “It Will Come To You” Jason’s voice is reaching towards the discussion of all-time greats like Ian McCulloch, David Gahan level of impact. Actors might not have compiled that size of discography yet, but they are climbing towards it at a rate few others in the modern scene can keep pace with.\n\nAlso it is the love they show for their fans everywhere. After absolutely demolishing the crowd. Most of the band playing two sets that night. They must have been exhausted. I truly don’t expect folks to have the time and spoons to say hi to every reviewer. So Jason reaching out to have me come to the back for a headlight selfie and to say hello meant a lot. Actors aren’t just a band for a lot of us. They are a movement you are a part of.\n\nIn Real Life | ACTORS (bandcamp.com)\n\nStabbing Westward – I have seen Stabbing Westward several times. 16 year old Ken alone in his bedroom, eyeliner streaking down his face because some girl broke his heart and only Chris Hall could understand. I have never seen SW play 8 feet away from me for 90 minutes spanning their entire catalog in a room of rabid fans. The fact that 1) they took a show in a smaller room to do this festival 2) They brought the energy of 20 year olds for and hour and a half while walking through the crowd and meeting everyone catching the other bands. To have a band with as much impact as they did on me be that down to earth and considerate is such a glorious icing on a face melting show of a cake.\n\nI even managed to keep my cool when I went to introduce myself to Walter, who said “Yes Ken, I know who you are, nice to meet you”. We talked about the modern scene, how much he loved Actors, and how much he still enjoyed doing this. I feel like I maintained my pretend journalistic integrity the whole time my brain went SQUEEEEEEEEEE IM TALKING TO WALTER FLAKUS!!!. Hopefully I will have an interview with them soon and won’t sweat to much while I ask the questions. Overall it was the perfect cap to a perfect night.\n\nStabbing Westward – American Industrial Rock Band\n\nAnother smashing success in year two establishes that Small’s has built something here. That top talent is recognized and travel out of their way to play with like minds. My head is already spinning with the possibilities of who will be there next year. Detroit is a fun an economical alternative to some of the other big destination festivals. A beautiful diverse setting full of unique cuisine and friendly people looking out for each other. If you have heard mutterings to the contrary, my guess is you are talking to people who saw Detroit in a movie. Not folks who have spent time here. I’ll see you in 2025.\n\nLIVE CONCERT REVIEW\n\nArtist: Peter Hook & The Light\n\nDate: 23rd November 2023\n\nVenue: La Laiterie\n\nCity: Strasbourg France\n\nPeter Hook is my musical idol.\n\nHe learned about this when I spied him out from the audience during the PIL set in 1989. I held up a banner saying “Peter Hook you the greatest” (misspelled, but he got the message). He talked to me for a minute and signed it, mostly to get a freaked-out 15-year-old fanboy to shut up. When I met him again in 2013, I mentioned that to him, he said “Wait, was that you?” I said “Yes,” and he said, “Well you fucking grew up then”.\n\nWhen I was interviewing dUg Pinnick from the prog metal band “King’s X” we talked about other bassists. Pinnick himself, a legend in so many circles said “Man, Peter Hook is so innovative, he invented a style, and championed it, his work stands out in bass playing”. (He also said that Killing Joke was one of his favorite bands too, seriously high praise)\n\nIn the long history of “Non Top 40” music, there have been few bands to hold the title to have conquered the music world, and influenced so many bands, as have the Joy Division flowchart.\n\nJoy Division was the 2nd only to The Velvet Underground as far as who influenced so many bands that said ” I can do that”, and then tried, and so many succeeded, and we have all been blessed by it. None of us can say we don’t owe it to the Manchester band that shook the world for music fans.\n\nWe know the story of “Joy Division”, in the tragedy of the death of Ian Curtis, rising from the ashes to become “New Order”, then to move into countless other bands and projects.\n\nFor now, we have Peter Hook, the bassist who created his signature sound, that inspired so many, but no one has been able to steal his sound. He has everything in the world to be proud of for that.\n\nPeter Hook picked up with a local music school project in Manchester England, called “The Light” to do a cover with Rowetta of Joy Division’s haunting epic “Atmosphere” which sparked the urge for Hooky to pull “The Light” into a long-term touring outfit, with grueling tours, playing marathon sets of the New Order and Joy Division catalog.\n\nLiving in Germany at the moment, I saw that Hooky was playing a gig just over the border in Strasbourg France, another country I once called home. I have been ALL THINGS PETER HOOK, for 36 years, so naturally, I had to go.\n\nI drove down with a friend from high school, and we got in line and met punters from Germany, France, Belgium, and even England.\n\nWhile I was in the pit waiting I spoke to some punters who were much older than I am. One guy told me he had seen Joy Division in Paris, and Brussels, among countless Hooky and New Order shows. It seemed a strange honor to meet someone who had seen Ian Curtis perform. This guy had a solid opinion on the subject.\n\nAs I waited, I saw the venue was half full 10 mins to showtime. I was thinking this was going to be a bust, then 5 minutes to showtime, the venue filled in. I had no idea you could fit so many people in a venue like that.\n\nHooky came onto the stage with the same classical horn music for the intro he has had for years. He greeted the crowd with “Bonne Soire” and kicked off the “Substance” set thumping out on the two lowest strings, playing the tune I know so well, the first New Order song I ever learned to play “Ceremony”. From the 2nd note, the crowd went mad. Peter Hook sang the first verse then at the chorus “I bring them down, no mercy SHOWN!!!” The entire venue erupted with “HEAVEN KNOW’S IT’S GOT TO BE THIS TIME!!!”\n\nI have seen Peter Hook & The Light several times, and a privilege every time, this was by far the loudest I have ever experienced.\n\n“Everything’s Gone Green” did exactly what it was supposed to, we all found ourselves in a trance with the early new wave/post-punk synth on dark foreboding basslines that once they were first played, no one knew what to think. 40+ years later, we still don’t, just let the beats take over, and feel what the song makes you feel. “No More Mistakes”, it’s not a song to remember the lyrics, or even make meaning of them, they just take over your mind while you sway to the music.\n\nMy 2nd fave song, which is a staple of every show “Temptation” began and the punters were all howling the “Ooo ohhhh oooh oooh” so loud Hooky and the Bernard “Stand in” David Potts was overpowered. It is one of those songs that everyone knows, and we sang with them, it was a loud joyous experience. In taking on lead vocals, Hooky has been singing this one with as much intensity as when they recorded it in 81. We didn’t feel the haunting from the original version, but were thrilled to be in the substance version of this great song. A song about someone in your life that you can’t live without, never invited, always welcome, but as much as this person means to you, there is no place for them in your life. This song is an anthem to the great friendships that you just can’t understand. During Temptation Hooky came right in front of me and posed with his guitar as if it was a weapon or a Harley Davidson. Only Hooky could be so cool.\n\nEveryone danced their way through “Blue Monday” with Hooky’s most famous bassline, half James Bond, half surfer rock.\n\nDavid Potts, Hooky’s right-hand man since the Revenge project in 89 took lead vocals for “Thieves Like Us”, a song that had escaped setlists for New Order for a very long time, and it is always a welcomed tune in the Hooky setlists, otherwise no one hears it anymore live.\n\nA gem from the “Low Life” album “A Perfect Kiss” rode on top of the Bach-esque synth lines, and is the only New Order song that Hooky played “Traditional” bass in sound, and technique, up till the haunting bass solo, among so many other greats on the most underrated album in the world. This was New Order’s intensity at its purest given to us in those basslines.\n\nBy the time we got to “Bizarre Love Triangle” the venue was bouncing up and down through the intro, and the fun nuances added into the “Substance” album. However, by this time I found it hard to dance when the place was so packed you couldn’t fit a razor blade between the punters.\n\nThey finished out the New Order Set with “True Faith” with Pottsy singing the higher vocal sections, and he did sing the original lyrics “When I was a very small boy, a very small voice talked to me. Now that we’ve grown up together, they’re all taking drugs with me”. Giving it to us the way they meant to all those years ago.\n\nA short intermission, and the crowd wasn’t going to back off, I managed to get back up front for more pics, but the bouncers wouldn’t let the photographers back into the pit. So I stood right in front of the PA system for the Joy Division segment. We all knew what was coming, and were fine with knowing what was coming. For shows like this, there is no pressure to get in the songs from the “New Album”, we were all there to hear these songs. So many of us never got the opportunity to hear the Joy Division songs, so this is something that fans will jump on to get in to hear these songs that never got played, or run their course like other great music. We all wanted to hear these live, and Peter Hook is giving that to us almost 50 years later.\n\nThey gave us “New Dawn Fades” to sheer AWE, at this moment the crowd became irreverent showing their appreciation for this number, then without missing a beat we got “From Safety to Where..” then “Failures” songs normally missing from some of the Joy Division “Substance” sets I have heard over the years, but no one was complaining.\n\nThey played “Disorder” the opening track from “Unknown Pleasures”, and I have heard it performed by Peter Hook & The Light, and even by “The Slaves of Venus” but tonight it was so powerful, we felt like we were on a space ship being catapulted through space for this song. For some reason, this performance of the song could have been the audio soundtrack to a Stanley Kubrick flick.\n\nHe played “Warsaw” the opening song, sort of out of sequence, but what was so cool about it this evening was Hooky was playing it with the “New Order-esque” sounding bass, and it was so amazing hearing it this way, I had to snag this on my phone and share it here, for you all to “Get it”. I was honored to hear them mixing the New Order sound into the Joy Division songs. Somehow it felt like this was the way it was supposed to sound, or would have if Joy Division had stayed the course, thank you Hooky.\n\nAt “Digital” there was a supplied chorus singing “Day In, Day Out, Day In, Day Out”, as the band watched us kind of smiling knowing that we were going to be doing those parts for them. Maybe this one stood out to New Order fans because of the way it caught the moment watching the semi-biopic film “24 Hour Party People”. ( I have spoken to several people who were in that story, and they all said it didn’t happen quite that way, but it was a great movie anyway and caught the spirit of the story, even though as Hooky has said they got much of it DEAD WRONG.) This time “Digital” had more of the “Tuned” bass from the “Brotherhood” vintage.\n\nNow, I will just describe it as this, a completely packed venue, covering the span of age from teenagers, to people well into their 60s, all howling along “Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! TO THE RADIO” in perfect key as if it was a well-orchestrated sing-along, imagine that, because that is exactly how it was.\n\nHooky in his book “Substance, INSIDE NEW ORDER” realized how hard it was being the one to sing and play guitar. I have noticed that singing on top of basslines is really out of the wheelhouse of rock and roll. The bass is to give a rhythm for the guitar to ride on top of, but not play the notes that the vocalist had to focus on. Hooky has been able to master doing this with a 2nd bassist who can play the lines exactly from the album to play off of, while he also sings. In the multiple shows I have seen of Peter Hook & The Light, I have come to appreciate the “Jam” band experience of having two bassists in there playing the same style off each other. If you are a Peter Hook bass line fan, seeing them live like this is rather a remarkable experience. It’s not just the bass player’s ego, it’s how these songs were meant to be played, and adding to the dynamic like this makes the music almost 3 dimensional.\n\nDuring “Dead Souls” Peter Hook walked over and pounded the electric drum pad with his fists, off of Paul Kehoe the drummer, smiling at him also looking like he was taking out aggression and smacking them so hard.\n\nFor anyone who has seen Peter Hook perform live, you know that the guy has this charisma on stage, in how he plays, moves around, and interacts with everyone. He has a serious amount of swagger that I don’t see in bassists, but more in vocalists. His stage presence is tantamount to guys like David Gahan, Peter Murphy, and even Mick Jagger. He is on stage, and you just watch him while he does his thing, strangely, he has always been that charismatic frontman.\n\nHe closed out the show, dedicating the song “Atmosphere” to the memory of Ian Curtis, stating that it was no different tonight than any other performance of the song. We all enjoyed it and respected the performance for what it was.\n\nThe 16th beat and world-famous chords on the bass started the anthemic “Love Will Tear Us Apart”. The masterpiece of history, that will go down in the annals of music with Beethoven’s 9th, and Chuck Berry’s “Johnny Be Good”, and I’m sure with Handel Messiah too. It is the most covered non-pop song of all time. It has stood the test of time and will live on long after any of us. It was just an honor to hear it played by one of the original musicians.\n\nPeter Hook & The Light gives you the nostalgia for the music you got to hear as New Order, and the music few ever got to hear live as Joy Division. I have flown to San Francisco, and Denver to see them, and now even driven to France. Once you see them live, you will understand why.\n\n#peterhook #peterhookandthelight #joydivision #joydivisionforever #davidpottsmusic #bassgods #postpunk #newwave\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/peterhookandthelight\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DavidPottsMusic\n\nhttp://www.peterhook.co.uk/"
