        "text": "Let me start off by saying, by no means do I think his arrest should end up in jail time however that does not mean I don’t want him to be punished. Drunk driving isn’t a mistake, it’s a choice. And here’s why…. According to DUI Prevention, about 32% of all traffic fatalities in the United States that involve drunk driving are with a BAC of .08 or higher. Unfortunately, we will never know what Justin’s BAC was because he refused the chemical test 3 times according to the spokesperson for the Sag Harbor Police Department.\n\nPenalties for refusing a test in NY state are up to a possible 6 month license suspension and a fine between $500-$1000, according to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nWhat exactly is a chemical test?\n\nChemical tests use blood, breath, urine or saliva to measure the BAC of a person. If you are arrested for an alcohol or drug-related violation, the police officer will likely request that you submit to a chemical test. Under New York’s “Implied Consent” law, when you drive a car in this state you are considered to have already given your consent to take this type of test.\n\nChemical test refusal is a separate issue from whether you were guilty of an alcohol or drug-related violation. If you refuse to take the test after being arrested, your driver license will be suspended when you are arraigned in court on the alcohol or other drug-related charge. In addition, the fact that you refused a chemical test can be brought up in court when you are tried on the alcohol or drug-related charge. If a DMV hearing later confirms you refused the test, your driver license will be revoked even if you are found not guilty of the alcohol or other drug-related violation.\n\nLet’s get back to some more statistics.. between 2013-2022, approximately 11,000 people died every year in drunk driving related crashes, that’s ONE person every 39 minutes!\n\nWhy am I throwing out all these statistics at you? Because these are preventable deaths that seem to keep happening. They are ripping families apart all across the United States. Just look at some of these families that have been affected by these senseless deaths.\n\nIn 2006, Jessica Rasdall & her best friend Laura Gorman both 18 yrs old at the time, went out for a night of clubbing that included drinking. Jessica decided to drive home that night, only 1 person made it back alive. To read more about this night, read the ABC News story.\n\nIn 2016, another victim, Michelle Ramsey Hawkins suffered the unthinkable, the loss of her two sons due to 2 different drunk drivers on the road that fateful night. After hitting a trash compactor that had fallen off a pickup truck by a drunk driver, Michelle got her family off to the side of the road waiting for police to arrive, little did she know that only a few minutes later, her family would tragically be changed forever by another drunk driver ignoring the safety cones set along side of the road.. Read more of Michelle’s story at Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\n\nBut let’s go even deeper, in my state of Rhode Island, approximately 3000 drivers are arrested for driving under the influence each year according to the Department of Transportation of RI.\n\nIn 2022, nearly 70% of the arrested individuals refused to submit to chemical testing according to RI DOT Safety. And do you know why refusals are so high, because people know if they hire a good lawyer, they’ll be back out on the road. Because RI is full of DUI lawyers, who will find any loophole on that police report, get it down to nothing and the most you’ll be paying is your $500 fine and released. But this isn’t happening in just RI, it is happening all over the country..\n\nIn this story, originally published by The Boston Globe, it chronicles the long history of how repeat drunk drivers are consistently getting off with no real consequences who really should have had their licenses suspended thus letting them back out on the road.. StreetBlog Report..\n\nIn this 2020 documentary short, Blind Spot, an 11 month investigation into how the Massachusetts Registry has failed to protect drivers & have also neglected dangerous offenders, it really exposes how states lack of responsibility to enforce laws are preventing these dangerous drivers back out on the road.\n\nNow let’s get back to Justin Timberlake…. What I hope that will happen to him is an automatic 6 month suspension of his driver’s license and the maximum fine. After this story broke, social media was generally favorable of him getting arrested and was hoping he would be treated like everyone else.\n\nReactions from Instagram varied from disparaging to no big deal.\n\nWhat I wish would happen, is that all states make it mandatory for first time offenders to install Ignition Interlocks. This is a device that requires the driver to blow into a breathalyzer to measure their blood alcohol concentration (BAC) before allowing the vehicle to start. Currently, 31 states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring all offenders, including first-time offenders, to install an IID. An additional eight states—Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Wisconsin and Wyoming—require high BAC offenders—trigger levels range between .1 and .17—and repeat offenders to install IIDs. Five states—Georgia, Ohio, Massachusetts, Maine and Missouri—require only repeat offenders to install the devices. The remaining six states—California, Indiana, Nevada, North Dakota, Montana and South Dakota— do not have any statewide requirements regarding IIDs, but judges have the discretion to order offenders to install one if they consider it necessary. This info was taken from National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nRhode Island is the smallest state in the country so when a tragedy happens, especially to younger people, our small community tends to rally around victims & their families, lending support, donations, fundraisers, any type of support that family might need. These tragedies that could’ve been prevented are now being used to get harsher penalties for accused drunk drivers.\n\nTake Kristine Bouthillier of West Warwick. Her son was injured in a drunk driving crash & while he survived, his best friend, Matthew Dennison, was killed. Teenagers just driving to a hockey game on a fateful evening in February 2022. She is now advocating, along with other parents whose children have died by impaired drivers, for stricter laws. Right now, Rhode Island has the shortest period of looking back at prior offenses in New England. For example, a driver gets arrested for a DWI today but six years prior, they were also arrested for the same offense, the law prevents the officers from charging the accused with a second offense. Laws don’t need to just change in Rhode Island, this needs to be nationwide.\n\nTwo days ago, one of my best friend’s texted on a group text how sad she was because a good friend of hers was killed by a drunk driver. She was riding her bicycle down the long stretch of Rte 1A in North Kingstown, which boasts a very wide bike/breakdown lane. The accused is a retired Providence police officer, released on $20,000 surety bail, meaning he only paid $2000. This happened at 6:57pm on Tuesday, June 20, 2024. He made a choice.\n\nI’m going to tell you a story as I remember it.. the pieces may not all be correct but this is the story I remember being told…. On December 5, 1952, my grandmother & her friend were walking up to St Alexander Catholic Church on Main Street in Warren, RI. It was rainy, they were wearing dark clothes & maybe carrying an umbrella, I am not sure about that. A car was speeding down the narrow street, I’m not sure how fast, but it happened so quick.. my grandmother and her friend were hit, I believe my grandmother’s body may have landed on the church lawn but her friend was being dragged until he finally stopped. The story was this man that ran them down had been at some sort of party, like an engagement party, had a few drinks, I don’t even think he was arrested, he knew people on the police force. He was never charged, it was rainy, so I guess that was the reason for the accident. It was 1952, not sure how car accident offenses were penalized back then, was he drunk? I don’t know, in my mind I believe he was. My grandmother died that day, it changed my mom’s life forever. She was nine years old.\n\nPlease do not make this choice, it could be the very last one you make or you might regret it for the rest of your life.\n\nSo let me tell you how I came to know about Coco.. I received a message from her on IG letting me know about a new video she is releasing and if I could possibly interview her….so I guess you can figure how that went. Not only is she a very talented singer, lyricist and musician but I felt like I was speaking to a younger version of myself. After our Zoom meeting, It was like fate had brought us together, with the help of her manager, CJ Maurice, who is as awesome as she is.. so let’s get into it.\n\nQ: Talk about growing up in New York and your first memories of being moved by some piece of music… is that the moment you knew, this is what I want to do with my life?\n\nCoco: I grew up in The Bronx, NY, right on the border between Kingsbridge and Riverdale. I have a lot of memories of my parents playing music together.. CD’s like “Rubber Soul” by The Beatles and “Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me!” on NPR intermittently. I was quite interested in the music but I don’t think I was old enough to be moved by anything…there were lot of times as a child where I was genuinely moved by a piece of music but I think the first time I was moved enough to get serious about it was in my junior year in high school, in a different town outside of The Bronx. I was in the car with my friend Victoria (she had fantastic music taste and a wonderful voice), and she showed me Graceland Too by Phoebe Bridgers. I thought to myself, “this is maybe the best song I’ve ever heard in my life,” and I remember wanting to write music shortly after that. I still have that song somewhere up there with the greats in my mind.\n\nQ: You just finished your studies at Berklee School of Music in Boston. What is it like in that type of environment where thousands of students are competing to have successful careers in the music industry? Does it actually prepare you for the reality of an indie artist in the music business today? Stressful?\n\nCoco: Oh, Berklee is quite scary. Lotta “big fish, small pond” stuff, lot of people around me feeling the imposter syndrome. I had a lot of fun there, though. It’s hard to completely put the experience into words. Yes, it’s competitive, but once you meet the right people, you realize that they to build community just as much as you do. It’s so important to have your people, 1) because they can help you learn things that you don’t know and 2) because they are your general support system and 3) because it’s imperative to be around people you love. Once you realize that making music isn’t about “competing for spots” or “competing for gigs” i.e., it was about creating the “So-and-so might get the Sinclair gig I was gunning for, that rocks, I’ll get it next time” mentality, I had so many more things going for me. Being happy for your friends and learning from the things they accomplish was one of my largest takeaways i got from attending the school. Berklee does a great job, especially within the Pro Music major (which was my major) of teaching students to be independent musicians. They help you make your own EPKs, help with promotions (especially in the business classes) and they help you make valuable connections.\n\nQ: So you have a few singles out already but I’m sensing you are heading in a new direction with your new music that’s yet to be released?\n\nCoco: I have some music out! I’m very proud of the work my friends and I have done. I want to to start to go in an even more genuine direction with my music, something even more stripped down, something I can say with lyrics that carry more meaning. I want something the audience can deduce multiple layers of interpretation from.\n\nQ: Speaking of new music, you have a new video that’s releasing today, February 16th, Golden Soul (link above). What is the concept behind this song?\n\nCoco: We do have a new video out! We all worked super hard on it, earlier in the year. Golden Soul is about some family members of mine. It’s about how two people can be really kind and open-minded, but in a relationship together, it just doesn’t work. The two of them are “golden souls,” but one of them is looking for the other to provide them with something unattainable. In other words, the first person wants the sun when they have a “golden soul” right in front of them. It’s sort of triumphant, in a way. There is still lasting goodness in relationships that don’t last.\n\nQ: How did you and your team put the video together? Did you need to do any crowdfunding or fundraising campaigns to get the project off the ground?\n\nCoco: Adam Regenstreif is an extremely talented director and one of my close friends; he floated the idea to me right after I showed him the unreleased first draft of Golden Soul. His whole crew is fantastic, and they were able to dedicate weeks of their busy schedules to put this together, props and all. Adam has this idea of a couple meeting for a picnic date in the park – except the girl is carrying all of the date supplies on her bike and he comes with nothing and leaves her to clean it all up. The date goes well and they clearly like each other, but nevertheless, she proves more and it takes a toll on her. The producer, CJ Maurice, helped create financial spreadsheets to allot for the props ( most of which were food), and contributed storyline ideas and the setting of the video, which was Robbins Farm Park in Massachusetts. The team was happy to contribute what they had, Georgie Duddy was the makeup artist and let me use some of her clothing to make it look more authentic. We all borrowed as much as we could and set up a GoFundMe for the remainders. We ended up making as much money as we needed! And we had a great time setting it up!\n\nQ: Now you’re a big fan of Adrianne Lenker of Big Thief. What is about her music that you can relate to and draws you in? What did you learn from her online Songwriting Workshop?\n\nCoco: I love Adrianne Lenker to no end, as well as Big Thief! her songwriting touches this part of me that makes me feel like I’m in a movie or compilation of some sort. I love songs that do that to me. Her music also affirms the idea that songs can be poetic, they can be anything you want them to be. A lot of people think there’s a secret to lyric writing, and that it’s to not be too vague. To me, her lyrics make perfect sense, even if you can’t read them like a book. You can take them and make them about you, or you can create a story in your head and play it out with characters (I feel like a lot of movie directors and writers do this in the beginning stages of putting music in their art) or you can even speculate about what the words mean to her! That’s the fun part! I find lyrics to be a lot less fun if you know exactly what the songwriter is talking about. But one thing I learned from her songwriting class is the happy medium between being “too vague” and “too blunt”. She walks you through it exactly, with annotated lyrics for her own songs and interweaving imagery with surprising, blunt lines. I don’t like to think that some people are just geniuses, because that implies s lack of work on their part and that it’s just intrinsic, something you “have” or “don’t have”. I think Adrianne Lenker is very thoughtful, and I can only hope to become as tasteful or as impactful as she is to me.\n\nQ: Besides Adrianne Lenker, who are some other artists that you’d consider that have been some influence on you in any way? Whether it’s music, art, fashion, dance etc.\n\nCoco: Remy Charlip was a choreographer, writer and illustrator of children’s books, one being, “Arm in Arm,”. It’s an adorable book, most of my tattoos are from it. My mom passed it on to me. There are themes of Meta fiction, repeating of words sometimes no seeming significance (you can create the significance, again, that’s the fun of it), and cats! I love cats. His title comes from the line in one of his writings, and it’s not in the climax. I like to think that I took that writing style from him. Things that you seem to write in passing, that you want to hit the reader/listener so you make them your title. Thst one line could be the entire meaning of the song, and at the same time, not the most important line. Otherwise overlooked. Triumph despite the rest. Those are my favorite tropes. Alabama Shakes have a lot of those themes and messages in their music, as well as Pinegrove. They have a sort of, “hey, it’s all going to be okay” vibe to their songs that must make me cry every single time. Pinegrove mimics it with porosity in their driving bass lines, and Alabama Shakes does it with organ (something I’ve worked on with my keyboardist, Brandon Crockett), and rhythmic guitar. I just find it all to be so beautiful. I would like to create that.\n\nQ: Like myself, you are very passionate about music but is there anything else you may have a passion for? Love? Religion? Politics? Philanthropy? Animals? Social Issues? Food?\n\nCoco: Love! I’m so passionate about love. I find that even the people who seem to have everything else figured out they don’t have this one. I try to lead with love, and sometimes I lose sight of that in my regular day-to-day. That’s why music is so important. It reminds me of how to be good. I am also passionate about food. I get quite upset. I’ve learned that I need to have that aligned before I do anything else.\n\nQ: Name 3 things you like to do in your spare time that have nothing to do with music.\n\nCoco: I like to read and write. I just got my thoughts out, usually online these days. It helps me feel normal when there are a lot of corporate formalities required of me. I am convinced sometimes that we weren’t meant to work as much as we do, we were meant to enjoy each other’s company more. Sometimes working so much is a blessing, sometimes it is not. I also like to take photos. I’m not a photographer by any means, and my main camera is my phone, but it’s fun for me and almost compulsive. If I see something cool, I must capture it. I also love to learn about nature, but I don’t do that nearly enough, so I have a couple of Natl Geo magazines I have yet to read.\n\nQ: If you were the headliner on tour, which artists would you bring as your supporting acts? And why?\n\nCoco: This is an interesting question…Hmmmmm. I think if I were headlining I’d bring my good friend, Halligan Delaney. Every time she sings, I start crying. Its incredibly simple to me, and she’s the first one who came to mind. She doesn’t embellish too much, she just truly means what she sings and writes. I would love to play a venue with her and have us be protected under the lights and free beer! I’d also bring my friend Mori, who’s music constantly feels like the warmest hug. I feel like I can do anything when I hear her sing! No matter how sad the song is, and they are, quite. I’d also bring along my friend Abby, who’s artist name is Mingko. Their music makes me feel like I’m in a forest one minute and receiving a gut punch the next (in the best way). I’d also bring Simon Safran, a lyricist I can only wish to match. They are so thoughtful and put together so concisely and with musicality. The last person I’d bring along is my friend, Indigo, their artist name is chrysalis. They just sing so hard, if that makes sense. Not unhealthy, just hard in a way that it sits in your throat and makes you want to scream cathartically. Their lyrics are also a gut punch. These are my musician friends and they matter so much to me, I’ll bring them to the ends of the earth with me!\n\nQ: What music are you working on and where can fans find your music?\n\nCoco: Right now, I’m working on releasing a single and then an album, as well as a video with Berklee! You can find my music on all streaming platforms, under Coco Smith.\n\nCoco’s social media sites are: Instagram, Spotify and YouTube\n\nWow! What an interview!! Not only do I have to go watch Coco’s new video but I have to now listen to all of Coco’s friends’ music too! I think we’ll be seeing much more of Coco in the near future. Keep an eye out for her in your town and as always, remember to support your local venues!\n\nUntil then, I’m Your Music Stylist!\n\nAs I’ve stated before in other interviews, I love to read about bands, especially lesser known bands from other countries. I was scrolling along Instagram when I came across this teen band consisting of a brother (Riley) and sister (Georgia) from Australia. I got to speak with them last October about what is going on with the band.\n\nQ: When did each of you become interested in playing an instrument? How many can each of you play? And what makes your primary instruments (Riley – guitar) and (Georgia – drums) so exciting to play?\n\nA: (Riley) I developed an interest in playing an instrument at the age of 4 when friends of the family gave me a 3 piece drum kit and it just snowballed from there. I can now play 4 instruments ( guitar, drums, bass and keys), as well as vocals. For me, what makes guitar so exciting to play is the satisfaction that comes from perfectly nailing a particularly difficult riff or solo, it’s an incredible feeling.\n\nA: (Georgia) I used to watch my Dad play the drums when he jammed with Riley, and one day I thought I’d like to have a go. From the day I picked up the sticks, I’ve loved drumming. I can play 2 instruments (drums and flute) and starting to get more into vocals now too. I find the drums exciting to play because they are the heartbeat of every song, they are what holds everything else together. I love the feeling that comes from hitting the drums and as I am a naturally loud person too, this instrument matches my personality perfectly!\n\nQ: How did you come up with the name Twelve Parsecs? Big astronomy fans?\n\nA: Yes, parsecs is a measure of distance in space, however we came up with the name, Twelve Parsecs, as we have always been huge Star Wars fans — if you are not familiar with the movie, the relevance is from when the Millenium Falcon made the Kessel Run in twelve parsecs.\n\nQ: You’ve competed in a couple of Battle of The Bands competitions. Did you learn anything from the bands in the competition and did you learn anything from those experiences?\n\nA: The best part about playing in the Battle of The Bands competitions would have to be the experience of meeting and performing with, other like-minded and talented artists. It not only gives us an opportunity to perform live, but also provides us with more exposure, and a chance to play our original music. The feedback received from the judges is also beneficial for our music growth. We are stoked to have been announced as the winners of The City of Busselton competition back in February. The biggest learning experience we’ve had from both participating in these competitions is watching how other bands present and perform on stage. Everyone is different which is just so awesome.\n\nQ: What musicians would you say have had the biggest influence on your music?\n\nA: That’s an easy and also tricky one. We both share a love for many different styles of music – we have our parents to thank for that – so the list of influences is fairly extensive but some of the main ones would have to include Foo Fighters, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Led Zeppelin, The Living End, Nirvana, AC/DC, Silverchair and Green Day.\n\nQ: What songs have been your favorite to cover?\n\nA: There are so many songs that we’ve loved (and love) playing. Our most popular cover we’ve done to date is Black Dog by Led Zeppelin but some of our other faves include Evie Part I by The Wrights, Hard To Handle by Otis Redding covered by Black Crowes, D.A.F. by Powderfinger, Rosanna by Toto, You Really Got Me by The Kinks and recently we had a lot of fun with making our own version of The Muppets, Mah Na Mah Na.\n\nQ: What are some fun things you both like to do in your free time that are not music related?\n\nA: (Riley) I love to read at any opportunity, there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t have my head in a book. I have also developed a keen interest in cars, particularly performance cars, even though I’m still a few years off getting my driver’s license.\n\nA: (Georgia) I play club and district level Netball so in my spare time, you’ll often find me practicing my goal shooting. I also love to hang out with my friends.\n\nQ: The band has recently been in the studio to record some original music. What can fans expect to hear?\n\nA: We are very excited about the new release of our debut single, Off My Shoulders that was released on April 15. Fans can expect to hear a catchy alternative rock tune with high energy, cool riffs, and fun vibes that we believe provides a pretty good summary of our musical interests. Our single launch event is happening on April 22.\n\nQ: When you put in your earbuds today, a) What will be the first artist you listen to? b) What is your favorite song of the moment c) Would you rather watch a concert in a 50,000 seat venue or a 500 seat venue? And what would it be?\n\nA: (Riley) a) Queen b) The Day I Tried to Live by Soundgarden c) Go see Foo Fighters at a 50,000 seat venue, simply because it’s really something else to be amongst a crowd of thousands of people that share the same love of that music that you do.\n\nA: (Georgia) a) Foo Fighters b) Dani California by Red Hot Chili Peppers c) Definitely a 50,000 seat arena to see Foo Fighters or RHCP\n\nQ: What do your fans mean to you?\n\nA: We love the interaction we have with our fans. The positive comments and messages of encouragement and support we receive on a daily basis mean so much to us. This has been particularly special when it comes to our original music after building up such an awesome following from our cover versions. Our fans are what inspire us to continue sharing our music, both covers and originals.\n\nQ: Where’s the best place for people to find your music and for those who don’t live in Australia to see your performances?\n\nA: The best place for people to find our music would be on Instagram and Facebook as we post the majority of our videos and songs on there as well as details of our upcoming gigs, however you will also find us on our YouTube channel and soon on TikTok too. The following link will take you to all our social media links.. http://linktr.ee/12parsecsband\n\nAnd don’t forget… Twelve Parsecs kick off event for their debut single, “Off My Shoulders” for those who live in Fremantle, WA Australia & nearby areas will be at Clancy’s Fish Pub, Saturday April 22nd. For tix, http://heatseeker.oztix.com.au Anyone under 18 must be accompanied by a legal guardian at all times (even band members ✌🏼)\n\nCant wait to see video from that event! Thanks again to the band and their team. Hoping to have more interviews coming within the next couple of months.\n\nUntil then, I’m Your Music Stylist.\n\nI’m always scouring the Internet for new and interesting bands to learn more about and I kept reading in several online music magazines like Loudersound & The Guardian about how “the next big band to watch” or “bands you don’t want to miss in 2023” all kept coming back to The Heavy Heavy..so of course I had to find out for myself. And oh yes, I wholeheartedly agree.. Here’s my conversation with bandmates, Georgie Fuller and Will Turner of The Heavy Heavy.\n\nQ: Most recently, American Songwriter had named your band as “the ones to watch in 2023”.. it’s such a great honor but in the back of your minds, do you feel like you now have to live up to a certain level of expectations from the industry/fans & how much pressure does that put on you?\n\nA: It adds something —we wouldn’t necessarily call it pressure, but it’s certainly brought a new level of gravitas which we now are aware of. We are recording our debut album so it could be easy to “feel the pressure”, but we just have to trust the music.\n\nQ: The band has a very retro sound like a cross between The Mamas and The Papas and some 70’s jams at times. Your music doesn’t really sound like anyone else out there right now & that’s what makes your sound so refreshing. When did you start playing together as a band & had it always been your intent for the retro throwback sound?\n\nA: We formed The Heavy Heavy in 2019 off the back of Georgie laying down some backing vocals on some old demos from a previous retro sounding band of Will’s – both our hearts lie with that sound, so it was inevitable.\n\nQ: In November of 2022, you released a cover of Crosby, Stills and Nash’s Guinevere but sadly Crosby passed away on January 19 of this year. What did David Crosby mean to both of you and how has he influenced your music?\n\nA: David Crosby is a huge inspiration having grown up with his records. He is the ultimate product of the whole world – the Laurel Canyon scene in the late 60’s. Fearless and mystical, melodic yet intangible – his songwriting is uniquely dreamlike, if we can create anything close to evoking feelings he evokes in us, we are onto something.\n\nQ: Your debut EP, Life and Life Only, released last year took you on the road where you performed at some pretty incredible places including all over Europe and this September you guys will be performing at Red Rocks in Morrison, CO. What are your thoughts on playing at such a beautifully incredible venue knowing so many iconic bands have performed there?\n\nA: Performing at Red Rocks is a complete dream come true scenario. We visited Red Rocks on the last day of our debut US tour, looked down at the stage and the view beyond and said, “One day”. Well that “one day” came round pretty fast. It’s going to be a night we’ll never forget.\n\nQ: The band has performed and recorded a few cover songs. If you were to cover any song by any artist if the modern day pop world, who would it be and why?\n\nA: Can’t think of anyone at this point.\n\nQ: Looks like the band is playing in several music festivals this year starting with a tour in March. Any bands you are looking forward to seeing or maybe collab with on stage? May we see you at the Newport Folk Fest this year?\n\nA: No Newport Folk Fest this year as far as we know – one day we hope! We are on lineups with some incredible artists and these are some that we are hoping to catch – Sheryl Crow, Neal Francis, Marcus King, Kevin Morby, Courtney Marie Andrews – any one of these artists would be insane to collaborate with – we admire them all immensely.\n\nQ: Touring can be hard on bands, especially now with the price of inflation driving up all the costs that incur with tours. How does a Spring/Summer non stop tour take a toll on both of you emotionally? How are you guys doing?\n\nA: We feel good about it. On our previous tour, we didn’t have a bad day. We are so excited to see people and play the music, and we have an incredible band and team around us that we feel supported. I guess we are lucky.\n\nQ: If you were to recommend a new artist for me to listen to, who would it be?\n\nA: Neal Francis, The Nude Party, SG Goodman, Mapache or Oracle Sisters are some contemporary acts we are really digging.\n\nQ: Where can fans find your music?\n\nA: We are working on the debut album as we speak. It can be expected….soon. 🙂\n\nSpotify, Apple Music, Youtube, Bandcamp etc…all the usual places. We are most active on Instagram in terms of updates.\n\nThank you so much for the interview. I highly recommend taking a listen to this band as you will see their sound is not like anything you are hearing on many platforms these days. And if you are thinking of ways to support your favorite bands, you should probably be buying some of their merch at shows or directly through their website. Here is The Heavy Heavy site if you’d like to check their shop.\n\nI am hoping to post a new interview every couple of weeks so if you have any band suggestions, feel free to email me.\n\nUntil then, I’m Your Music Stylist.\n\nI’ve been wanting to interview Justin Harrington, aka Demeanor, for awhile now after I saw him perform at the Newport Folk Festival in 2021. To my surprise, they had announced they were having a rapper perform on the main stage of all places… as many people had gotten up from their chairs & blankets because they thought it was a good time to roam the grounds, I was able to move up closer to the stage & witness one of the most refreshing new acts to add to my discoveries that year. Here is my interview with Demeanor.\n\nQ: I first saw you perform in 2021 at The Newport Folk Festival. So many legendary artists have graced that stage, talk about that experience for you and the fact you were on the “main stage”, it takes some artists years to get to there.\n\nA: It felt like a dream honestly, going in, I figured I’d be on one of the smaller stages. When I arrived and the golf carts brought me to the main stage, it felt surreal. I had performed on that stage with my aunt some years prior so it felt like a beautiful full circle moment. Plus, I was able to bring out dear friends to perform with me, it was really important that I was able to share the experience with them. Newport is such an iconic festival, and to be the first to do an all hip hop set is something I will always cherish. Rap is folk! That felt like the first time I was able to show that side of my mission.\n\nQ: You have musical talent in your blood, your aunt Rhiannon Giddens, the incredibly talented singer/songwriter & composer. Did you realize you wanted to be in the music industry at a young age? When did you first pick up the banjo?\n\nA: Growing up, I wanted to be an actor. I went to a performing arts high school and went to Cincinnati College of Conservatory Music as an acting major my freshmen year of college. I started writing rap verses my senior year of high school just for fun. I had always been interested in music as a passion, yet never really saw myself as a professional music artist, I just knew I wanted to perform. Always a heavy fan of hip hop, once my aunt started teaching me how to play the banjo, certain rhythms and messages started to click for me. I dropped out of school, have been recording or performing everyday since and have never looked back. I started a non-profit with a few colleagues and now we’re working to empower the artist community to make it more feasible to others to create their own path.\n\nQ: Growing up in North Carolina, you can find string band music almost around every corner. But a lot of people don’t realize that bluegrass originally came from African American string band music and sort of evolved or intertwined into stomp & holler/bluegrass. Give us a little history on the two genres and the connection between the two.\n\nA: Growing up it was actually a rarity to ever hear or see an actual string band, especially composed of musicians of color. Greensboro is a college town, most of the shows and performances that I was exposed to were country bar gigs, punk house shows, open mics, hip hop shows and jazz nights on campus. Although we have a North Carolina Folk Fest at home here, I didn’t get to see any string band performances aside from my aunt. I didn’t even see people playing banjos. I’ve heard some bluegrass acts that come through every once in awhile, but I was never really a part of bluegrass culture. The old time music I was brought up with is made up of traditional Black/American banjo/fiddle music that was passed down from folks of color who were playing contradances and square dances for both black and white audiences. Both bluegrass and old time are pretty rooted in Blackface minstrelsy and in my experience one of the key differences between the two is that old time players seem to feel more of a responsibility to speak on that history. In old time, you don’t really get banjo solos like you do in Bluegrass, most people would be playing claw hammer style. Banjos are also built differently, bluegrass banjos have a big resonator around the head, old time banjos are a bit simpler in build. They are of two different sides of the same coin, of a traditional Black American music legacy. However…..ask black musicians which space feels safer for them.. Which is not to cast a net on all of the people in bluegrass, I personally have a good relationship with and much respect for Ganstagrass, Bela Fleck is a legend, and I’ve had incredible experiences with players at festivals of all kinds. but it’s important to speak about that reality. Especially when on another side of that coin – Country – you see unbelievably talented women of color who have been trailblazing for years – fighting constantly simply to be included, respected, and protected. A sad reality of the larger culture which is inclusive of all of us. We are all a part of This American history. It’s looking up though… Shout-out to Jake Blount, Rissi Palmer, Allison Russell, Amethyst Kiah, Kaia Kater, Brandi Pace and everyone who’s making these spaces more vibrant every day.\n\nQ: Three words…. Tiny Desk Concert…. How amazing was that? Who else did you perform with? When will it be available for viewing?\n\nA: It was the most nerve wracking thing I’ve ever done, partly because (love you Jake) I forget the words every single time we rehearsed. I thought I was going to wreck it lol. Plus this was the first time I ever actually met Jake in person, so it was a great show of faith for him to bring me out to do this tiny desk, I was so nervous that I was going to blow it. If he was concerned as I was, he sure didn’t show it. He just said, “I trust you” and on the day of filming everything went almost perfectly. It was absolutely incredible to be able to play with such a killer dream team of folks. And Jake should get his flowers because he does a lot of this stuff by himself, his band is phenomenal, but it’s so much work to also run the business side. I’m just glad to be a part of history lol, I’m sure that’s the first time anyone has rapped over a banjo on a tiny desk, a recurring theme in my career. It’s available right now on the Tiny Desk pages.\n\nQ: Have you and Jake ever collaborated on any music together?\n\nA: Yeah, I’m featured on a couple of his songs on his album, “The New Faith”, which is taking the world by storm right now. You should go check it out!\n\nQ: Talk about your latest singles, “Like A Drug” and “Now and Again”. What are these songs about?\n\nA: I’ve been spending a lot of time working on a pretty intimate and serious album. I feel a lot of pressure when it comes to the music I put out, so I’ve been sitting on it for a long time. Merging genre and exploring identity and figuring out ways to contribute to the culture in the best way that I can. I’m also 24 and I just want to have fun at the same time. I got together with a few good friends of mine, The Beat Monopoly and Chris Meadows, and we made this project, “Like A Drug”. I spent hours and hours in the studio with The Beat Monopoly trying to find my sound in the contemporary hip/pop space and I think we came up with a really colorful and fun project which is killer live. Now and Again was an attempt to merge my love for the pop punk bands I used to do the house show circuit with and the sounds of modern rap. Like A Drug is just my summertime love jam. Kind of like Sandy and Danny from “Grease” when they had their time at the beach, but this time it’s 2023 and the beach is in Greensboro lol.\n\nQ: Life changing moments for you , I’m going to assume, was being able to travel to S Africa to work on a project and record music. Just the cultural and historical experiences must have been overwhelming to be a part of…how did that trip change you for the better?\n\nA: I have too many lessons to know where to begin with my trip to South Africa. What I will say is that what started as a journey to explore similarities or differences between the Black American struggle for equality and the South African struggle for liberation became an unprecedented exploration of sound and identity and cultural empowerment and I can’t wait to share the documentary we made with the world.\n\nQ: What do you like to do when not performing music?\n\nA: If I’m not performing, I’m in the studio. If I’m not in the studio, I’m watching Avatar: The Last Airbender with my girlfriend.\n\nQ: Is there any musician alive or dead, that has influenced you in a way, that you’ve tried to emulate their style, values or overall way of life?\n\nA: Childish Gambino. Multi-disciplinary, genre bending, truth teller, writer, thinker, legend. Royce Da 5’9”, Kendrick, Cole, Chance, Vic all had impact on me but none stronger than Gambino. I hope once can hear that in my music.\n\nQ: What is Demeanor working on now?\n\nA: Right now, I just dropped a new single, All For Me, which is the lead single off my next album. It’s the first song I’ve ever put out that really sounds like me. Authentically Demeanor. I produced it, mixed it, wrote it and collaborated with my amazing friends to execute it. Everyone should go listen to it right now!\n\nQ: Where can fans find your music?\n\nA: I’m on all DSP’s, and I am the most active on Instagram @demxmusic\n\nThis was was one of the most interesting interviews I have done.. such great answers.. please go and listen to his music; superbly talented!!\n\nI have a couple of interviews coming out soon. 12 Parsecs Band from Australia, Christian James Koch, recently featured in The NY Times and singer/songwriter from India, Jordan Johnson.\n\nThanks to everyone who takes the time to read these interviews.. my hope is to bring more recognition to indie artists who aren’t being noticed as much but with your help by streaming their music, reposting on your social media and buying their merch, that can change.\n\nUntil then, I’m Your Music Stylist.\n\nThe Westerlies are a dream band for me. The secret is out now about how I would dream about conducting an orchestra in my mind while contributing my parts by playing the clarinet & the drums but alas that was only a dream… but this band has no woodwinds or percussion and is comprised of four brass players: Riley Mulherkar, Chloe Rowlands, Andy Clausen and Willem de Koch. This October, I got to speak with them about their music.\n\nQ: When did the band start performing together as The Westerlies? And where did you come up with the band name?\n\nA: All four of the original members grew up in Seattle, so we’ve known each other since childhood. We then moved to NYC one after the other for college, and formed the band out there. The name comes from the prevailing winds that blow from west to east.\n\nQ: The band has played with some notable contemporary artists including Fleet Foxes and Common. If you were to choose a “dream artist” you could perform with, who would you choose?\n\nA: We always love engaging in new collaborative projects with musicians from across the musical spectrum, so it’s tough to choose one “dream artist”! I’m sure each band member would give you a different answer but we’re all big time Beyoncé fans. If she called, we’d be there!\n\nQ: In March of this year, you released the album, Songbook, Vol 2. Does one person compose the music, both trumpet & trombone parts? How long does it take to put an album like this together?\n\nA: We all compose for the group, but our rehearsal process is very democratic, so often an individual will bring in a piece, and then it’ll go through a few rounds of revision based on feedback from the other band members. Since the pandemic we’ve all been honing our recording skills and producing more of our own recordings, so it’s getting easier and easier to put a body of music together and then get it “on wax”. For a shorter EP like Songbook, Vol 2., we were in the studio for about two days. Longer full-length albums generally require a week of studio time (and that’s not counting all of the hours and hours of rehearsal that happen before we go into the studio).\n\nQ: You just performed a show in Times Square with Carnegie Hall. What was the experiencelike? That must have been surreal.\n\nA: It was totally surreal. It was actually quite difficult to stay focused on the performance with so many people, sounds, lights, billboards and other distractions around. But it was also very cool to hear our sounds reverberating off the skyscrapers around us.\n\nQ: The band also just wrapped up a 6 date tour with Haley Heynderickx. She has a great loyal fan base…what did you most enjoy and learn from being on tour with her?\n\nA: Haley is one of our dear friends and one of our musical heroes. It’s a great pleasure to make music with her because her songs have lots of intricate, creative harmonic movement and rhythmic content – – there’s lot to chew on – – but they’re also incredibly catchy and playful. She strikes this amazing balance. Haley’s also very open-minded, so she gave us lots of room to try out different ideas and put our own creative voice into the music.\n\nQ: I want to mention Denzel Mendoza, fellow trombone player, aka Illegal Son. His story is one of thousands of people across the US right now.. how impressed were you with his passion and creativity for his music & himself as a person?\n\nA: Denzel is one of the most courageous artists we know. He brings incredible passion and energy to every performance he gives, so it was pretty mind blowing to see him do it night after night on tour – – I can only imagine how emotionally exhausting it is for him to go to a place of such catharsis and deep-feeling every night. We have the utmost love and respect for Denzel – – he lands an important voice to the undocumented immigrant experience.\n\nQ: The band had a 13 date tour over in Europe, did you get to do any sightseeing while you were there? Anything crossed off anyone’s bucket lists?\n\nA: Lots of good sightseeing! The food in Paris was amazing. Amsterdam was incredible. One of the best parts was getting the opportunity to play in so many historic theaters. The whole tour was a privilege, to say the least.\n\nQ: When the band isn’t performing, what type of things do you all do to stay stress free?\n\nA: We have all different interests and hobbies. For some of us, it’s reading, for some it’s cooking, for some of us, it’s playing video games. We all try to get exercise and stay active in various ways.\n\nQ: Will we be seeing some new music headed our way anytime soon?\n\nA: Most definitely! We have several recording projects “ in the can” so to speak – – it’s just a matter of getting the release timing right. Keep your eyes peeled for new releases coming this December and Spring 2023.\n\nQ: Where can fans find your music/merch?\n\nA: https://www.westerliesmusic.com/! The best way to support artists is to buy their music on Bandcamp.\n\nThank you Willem for answering the questions for the band. I have a feeling we will be seeing more of the band on national stages and events in the very near future.\n\nThe Westerlies have released their first ever live album recorded at The Tourists in North Adams, MA. Their first two singles off the album have been released, Saro and Robert Henry. Please make sure to listen to this amazing group of musicians, you will be moved. (If not, you may not be human)\n\nI’m on the lookout for bands/artists… who will be featured next?\n\nUntil then…. I’m Your Music Stylist.\n\nSweet Lizzy Project has quickly risen in popularity by opening for legendary acts such as Heart & Joan Jett. Electrifying vocalist, Lisset Diaz, producer and lead guitarist Miguel Comas, keyboardist Wilfredo Gatell, drummer Angel Millet and bassist Alejandro Gonzalez round out the band. The band is currently on a 15 date tour up and down the East Coast & as far as Texas. Their new album dropped on October 7th, Pirate Radio/Radio Pirata and I recently spoke with Lisset about their new album and journey on how they go there.\n\nQ: Now that you have started the tour, what can fans expect to hear from the band, in terms of song selection, from you during the tour?\n\nLisset: We can’t be more excited to finally go on tour with the new record out. Technicolor, (our previous record), release and tour got frustrated due to the pandemic in the beginning of 2020, so we are now taking all that excitement with us on tour. We are gonna be playing all of the new songs from the new album Pirate Radio and we will include some of the old songs, as well as some covers that we love.\n\nQ: You’ve released 2 albums, Pirate Radio (English) and Radio Pirata (Spanish). It’s not often a rock album is released in two languages at the same time. How proud are you to finally release this album? What does it mean to you and your band?\n\nLisset: Extremely hard, indeed. There was a lot of “first times” for this album. Even though Spanish is my first language, I’ve always written mainly in English, so writing a full album in Spanish was definitely a challenge for me. Also, the inspiration for this album was quite peculiar. For the first time, I was not talking about a personal love story or life in general. We wanted a concept album inspired by the story and the suffering of our country Cuba that has been under dictatorship for over 60 years. So, for the first time, I wanted to make the message clear and understandable as possible, especially for our Cuban people. This is why we decided to make the album in Spanish as well. However, we also wanted the songs to resonate with everyone, even if they had no idea about Cuba or its history. In terms of song writing, most of the songs were written in English first and then kind of translated into Spanish. This was by far, the hardest task, I’ve ever faced as an artist. During the process of writing a song, I repeat the same melody and the same words over and over again, make changes, find better words etc. until the song sounds perfect to me. To write these songs in Spanish was like forgetting everything I was already happy with and starting all over again. New sounds, rhymes, metrics…everything was different. Things would sound really cool in English were just tacky in Spanish and vice versa. It was a lot of work and quite stressful at times but we can’t be happier or prouder of the final product. The album is something of our own from start to finish, from the conception of the songs and recording them, to mixing and mastering. We did it all ourselves in workshop that we turned into a studio. The themes and emotions are relatable to anyone who has ever been in love, sacred, angry, sad or inspired to change their worlds. Realizing this album is not only our contribution to a cause that we consider fair and necessary which is the freedom of our homeland but it’s also a way to unburden ourselves by putting into songs the personal thoughts that we were never allowed to say them out loud.\n\nQ: The band is based out of Nashville but originally emigrated here from Cuba in 2017. In the early years in your country, Cuban radio had banned anyone perceived to be anti-Castro to have their music played on the airwaves…some of those artists included Celia Cruz and Gloria Estefan…this ban was finally lifted in 2012.. When you were performing music there, did you find it difficult to not being able to create a type of record that was true to the band, talk openly about issues that were personal to you? And how does this new record compare to being able to speak freely with no repercussions?\n\nLisset: There’s a lot you don’t think about when you are in Cuba.. Most of us were born and raised in a country without internet, no chance to travel outside the country, with the official press being the main, if not the only, source of information and the fact that you are not supposed to talk (or even think) about certain things is public knowledge. It takes you a minute to realize that things are wrong and that everything they have been telling you is a lie. And even when you notice that something is off, again, you can’t talk about it cause you can get in trouble. Instead, you keep moving forward as best as you can until you get the opportunity to change things in your life. In my case in particular, I don’t come from a music background. I was at school during my childhood and teenage years, studying to become a scientist. I studied Biochemistry for three years. When I was 15, my mom gave me a guitar that a family member brought from Spain and I learned how to play. I also enjoyed singing as a hobby. It was not until my fourth year at the University when I started writing songs and thought it would be cool to record them just to have them for myself. That’s how I met Miguel Comas, who was a full time musician and producer, and together we recorded a first album with his songs and my songs and put a band together to be able to perform that album. The songs were mostly about love, past relationships and life in general. We were not writing about political stuff, just because our heads were not there. Then the problems started..putting a band together in Cuba and starting performing is not remotely as easy as it is here. All the music venues were somehow connected to the government and for an artist to be able to perform live, you have to go through an audition to get into some sort of management agency (also controlled by the government) that basically allow you to work. You can’t do this independently, it is illegal. It didn’t matter that I was not talking about politics. My songs were written in English and the music genre was not traditional Cuban music. It had a clear foreign influence and they didn’t feel that. There was a lot of red tape involved and the band was banned for a while. In 2017, we got a record deal to come to Nashville and record our second album, Technicolor. That’s when we left Cuba but even while working on this album, I didn’t feel the need to talk about political issues. I was not even thinking about it. My mind was not ready yet. Freedom doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a process and it’s different for everyone. November was a very unsettling month for us. The dissidentSan Isidro Movement had started a hunger strike in Havana as a protest against the Cuban regime’s oppression. I had never seen anything like that. I wasn’t even aware of the existence of such a consolidated dissident group on the island. It was very touching and enlightening for me to realize that there were brave Cubans on the island fighting for basic rights. On top of that, one of the protestors had been my Immunology professor when I studied Biochemistry at the University of Havana. This made it even more personal for me. In that context, I remember when Miguel first talked about a new album, “Pirate Radio”. He came up with the perfect way of putting our next project where our hearts and our minds were at the moment. We wouldn’t only be voicing our solidarity but it would be a way to unburden ourselves by putting into songs the personal thoughts that we never never allowed to say out loud. We turned our house into a recording studio (one of the perks about having the entire band living together) and for the next nine months, the idea and the story of “Pirate Radio”, were my first thought when i woke up in the morning and the last one before I went to bed. That’s how “Pirate Radio” was born, a concept album that describes the story of a fictional character living in Cuba in the 70’s, when foreign music genres such as Rock and Roll were banned by the communist government. Admirers of these unauthorized forms of music created illegal antennas to secretly tune in to radio stations from different parts of the world, which made it possible for them to listen to bands such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and Elvis Presley. If caught at this activity, these music lovers were socially marginalized because they did not conform to the oppressive expectations of the recently triumphant Cuban Revolution. Frequently, they suffered arbitrary arrests, abuse and imprisonment, which ultimately forced thousands of Cubans to emigrate, legally or illegally, from the country. Many of these immigrants never reached the shore in the United States, but instead tragically lost their lives in the deep waters of the Straits of Florida. Pirate Radio is our tribute to this generation of Cubans with whose we are United by respect and love for music. It is an ode to freedom of expression and thought. It is an anthem to those who dream of change and struggle against oppression. It is our cry for, and commitment to, the end of fear, censorship and silence.\n\nQ: How did your life change after being featured in the PBS documentary, Havana Time Machine?\n\nLisset: Because of the documentary, we met Raul Malo of The Mavericks, who back then was starting a record label, MonoMundo Recordings. Because of Raul Malo’s Cuban roots and the fact that he loved the music we had already recorded in Cuba under such difficult conditions, he offered us the opportunity to come to Nashville to write and record the next two albums of the band. Our lives changed 360 degrees. It was a huge change professionally and personally. Very challenging. As much as we were enjoying our time at a nice studio recording new music, our tour all over the US and the experience of in a country with resources and infinite opportunities, it was hard to start from zero, far away from our friends, family and everything we knew. Different language, different culture, different life. We have learned so much and we are so grateful.\n\nQ: So the band released a new single this month, “Shake The Walls”. Give us some insight on what this song is about. (Since this interviews, the band has released the single, “Slip Away”)\n\nLisset: Since “Pirate Radio” is a concept album, we wanted all songs to be connected and kind of telling a story from beginning to end. For the purpose of writing the songs, I created a fictional main character. He is a 17 yr old boy born and raised in Cuba, who wants to put a band together and play rock and roll like the bands he secretly listens to on the pirate radio. His ideas take him to start fighting against the censorship till the point that he has to escape the country to avoid fatal repercussions. “Shake The Walls” is the very last song on the album and completes it with a message of hope and a rallying call to speak out “loud and proud” in the fight for freedom. This song expresses our desire that in the future Cubans will be free, and those who sought freedom all around the world will be able to return to our home country.\n\nQ: I love the album of covers released last year, SQS Vol 1, it’s quite a mix of genres. How did you choose the songs for the album? Has Brandi Carlisle heard your cover of The Joke? Will there be a Vol 2?\n\nLisset: During the pandemic, we started a series of shows at home that we called Sweet Quarantine Sessions. It would go live on Facebook and YouTube from our living room. It was the way we found to entertain our fans during such hard times and also to entertain ourselves. We played a show every night for months and then every weekend for almost a year. We played our songs of course but needed more and more songs to be able to have a different show every night. We learned over 300 songs over the 80 something shows we played. At some point, we were waking up in the morning and spend the day rehearsing learning 5 or 6 new songs to play that same night. Each show was different. We did theme nights like, the 80’s, 70’s, 90’s, acoustic night, British night, classics, jazzy, Latin night….So many!!! It’s all on YouTube (Best of Week 1). At the end of the pandemic, we chose the songs we liked the most from our performances and put them on an album so the fans could have something to remember our nights together during the pandemic. I don’t think Brandi has heard our version hahaha. We had plenty of material to make Vol 2, 3, 4.. but then we started working on the new album and that consumed all our time and energy.\n\nQ: Tell your fans how they can support local record stores and how to purchase your latest album,.\n\nLisset: The physical product, vinyl and CD, can be purchased directly on our website, Sweet Lizzy Project Merch, on Amazon or at a local record store. And of course, we will have them with us on tour.\n\nQ: Where else can fans find your music online? Where can they buy your merch?\n\nLisset: everything can be found at https://www.sweetlizzyproject.com\n\nThank you Lisset and The Sweet Lizzy Project. I really don’t know much about Cuban history except what we read in the media and to hear about the oppression first hand is eye opening. We shouldn’t take our freedoms in the US here for granted.\n\nI have a couple of interviews in a few weeks from Nordista Freeze and The Westerlies… working on some others so stay tuned.\n\nUntil then, I’m Your Music Stylist.\n\nOn September 23, The Foxies will release their much anticipated debut album, “Who Are You Now, Who Were You Then”. This pop punk trio from Nashville is ready to show music fans what makes them one of the most exciting energetic bands on the rise.\n\nI was lucky enough to catch up with the band to answer some burning questions I had for them… so here are The Foxies..\n\nQ: What I find most interesting about several of your new songs on the album that in a way, it’s somewhat of an unconventional love album….several songs mention relationships or wanting to be with someone. Am I wrong? How would you best describe what the concept of the new album is?\n\nJulia: You are very right! This album is lyrically painting the picture how I dealt with my relationship with a certain human, and how I dealt with the relationship with myself. Listening to the album from top to bottom is a rollercoaster, because that is what goes on in my head constantly when I am romantically involved with someone. But more importantly, this album is a journey of growth and acceptance.\n\nQ: Does everyone get in on the writing process… Julia, Jake and Rob? Do you all write lyrics and then kind of work the process putting the album altogether?\n\nJake: Our process has been really fluid over the years, but these days, the writing starts with Julia and me. We usually have a co-writer or two we enjoy working with, and the song gets pretty fully written and demoed from there. After that, we bring our favorite songs to the band and everyone picks their favorites before we go into the studio to record drums, vocals etc. Every song is different, but generally that’s the sequence of events.\n\nQ: Now there has been 4 singles released so far. 1) Overrated 2) Headsweat 3) If Life Were A Movie and 4) I Don’t Wanna Want It Give is a breakdown of the story behind each song.\n\nJulia: Overrated is a point-the-finger track to myself. I get so caught up in social media and trying to be on everyone’s radar, that creating becomes exhausting. I have to keep myself in check and remember why I do what I do. It’s easy to get lost and to lose yourself in this industry. Headsweat is a tune about sexual frustration. Wanting someone so badly that you’d cross the ocean for them. If Life Were A Movie is the realization track that the person you were so excited about, was really just in your head and their true being is not what you made them out to be. It’s a mean track for sure haha but it is about turning the tables and gaining control over heartbreak. I Don’t Wanna Want It is an honest track about falling back into the cycle of vices. You know someone or something isn’t good for you, and you hate that you want it, but deep down inside…you crave it.\n\nQ: I Don’t Wanna Want It is such a great tune…and you just released the video… how fun was it to work on this? Was it a crazy fun experience?\n\nRob: I really love working on all of our videos, Julia has such a creative visual mind, and it’s always fun to see it all come to life. Plus our boy Ryan Sheeby is amazing!!!\n\nQ: Let me congratulate you on the debut album… I love how I felt like I was listening to a soundtrack to a TV series or film….definitely music that one can easily relate to whether it’s about relationships, social media overkill or a state of mind…. Have you ever thought about if your songs were to be used on a TV soundtrack, what shows could you envision them on?\n\nRob: Well, I’d have to say, I would love for it to be on my favorite shows but they are long since over. As far as shows or movies, I wish or hope some day to be an opening song for a 007 movie. That would be epic!!!!\n\nQ: Let’s talk about the Nashville scene…being from such a musical city full of tremendously talented artists around every corner, how would you compare your sound as being unique compared to other pop punk bands from the area? What makes your band stand out?\n\nJake: We’re so lucky to have come from here. I think we are able to stand out right away in Nashville because our hybrid of punk music and dance music, specifically, wasn’t something you could find anywhere else. I think because we stood out right away, we’ve never had to fight for the validation that what we are doing is original, which I think for a new band is really lucky. I’m not entirely sure these days what makes us stand out, but we keep doing our thing and Nashville has really embraced it the whole time.\n\nQ: I can definitely hear a Gwen Stefani/No Doubt influence in your sound. Who are some bands that you would say that have influenced you music through the years?\n\nJulia: No Doubt has definitely helped me find my voice. But I would say that Green Day was the most pivotal band for me. I first saw them when I was ten on their “American Idiot” tour and then everything clicked for me. I thought to myself, “If he can play his music for millions people, then I can too.”\n\nQ: The album’s release date, 9/23, happens to be the first date of your European tour supporting Billy Idol (this makes me so happy for you guys – love him so much)… What was your reaction to hearing you’d be supporting a legendary alternative 80’s icon?\n\nJulia: Awe thank you! I’m happy too! It’s a total dream to support this legend. We got this opportunity to play a few shows with him last summer and it was such an amazing time. We honestly had no idea we would be getting a call offering us to support him in the EU but we are so grateful that we do. Him and his whole team are wonderful people.\n\nQ: What are your plans in October after coming back from Europe? Is there going to be a US club tour scheduled? Hopefully make it to the RI area??\n\nRob: Yes! I lived in Boston for almost 5 years so we need to get our butts to New England ASAP!!! We’ll do a little bit in the US this fall but 2023 will be when we really hit the road hard. Hope to get to Rhode Island and see you guys out there!!\n\nQ: Where can fans find your music? Where can they purchase your merch?\n\nRob: Our music can be found on whatever streaming platform you prefer. As far as merch, we have an online store on our website, http://www.TheFoxiesBand.com\n\nYou can also find The Foxies on IG @thefoxies\n\nThanks so much to the band for taking the time to speak with me. I’m telling you guys, this band is going to blow up real quick so get ahead of the game and start listening now!! You can say, you listened to them when…\n\nIf you or your band would like an interview, send me an email at mewzickkismylife@gmail.com. Until then, I’m Your Music Stylist!!\n\nLet me start off by saying, I have been waiting for this concert for two loooong years. Damn to COVID because it was originally supposed to be in 2020 & pushed back till now, August 19, 2022. I have been to Fenway Park many many times as I am a diehard Red Sox fan, the last though being in 2018 for their World Series Victory Parade. This was different, it was an “OMG, I can’t believe this is finally here” moment and boy did it not disappoint. So I am going to take you through to what I experienced last night.. PAWS UP EVERYONE, you ready?\n\nAfter we arrived in Boston, we decided to make our way down to where our restaurant reservation was, which happened to be part of The Verb Hotel, a cute spot called Hojoko, on Boylston Street, literally right in back of Fenway. They serve Japanese street food in small plates style w/ delicious cocktails. I tried some Izeko Sparking Jelly Sake, which I would highly recommend.. luckily our table was outside… yes it was extremely hot however Lady Gaga was having her sound check during this time. I actually thought it was just them playing her Chromatica record, she sounded that good.\n\nWe were in our seats over an hour till the lights went off and everyone went bananas. This isn’t a full video but it gives you an idea of kind of the several videos that were played before each segment of her show. I interpreted this as an arrival of this creature landing on Chromatica (almost like a rebirth)\n\nThis started approximately around 8:20pm… felt like a lifetime, but finally had arrived. It was dark and all of a sudden LET THERE BE LIGHT!!!\n\n.\n\nLet me say, I recorded most of my video from the big screen because although our seats were very good, my camera just wasn’t good enough (IPhone 12 Pro).. and also should say her dancers worked hard AF… they were beyond awesome & I wish I knew their names bc I would list them all, they were that good..\n\nShe literally banged out 3 of her mega hits right in a row without stopping, Bad Romance, Just Dance and Poker Face…. I didn’t sit down once the entire concert and danced, jumped up and down, swinging my arms like a maniac doing my best Little Monster Paws Up claw, knowing I was getting one of the best workouts of my life tonight.\n\nInteresting fact about Poker Face that I just learned within the last 2 days… the lyrics are: P P P Poker Face, F F Fuck her Face.. I just had been singing, Poker Face probably like everyone else. 😳\n\nAnother interlude that made feel like I was witnessing some sort of secret experiment that we were allowed in on then we finally arrived at ACT I\n\nFinally, we would see the first of many songs off her Chromatica album…. If you bought a ticket to this concert, you received a free Chromatica CD with your purchase.. I somehow ended up with 2 sets of tix, 2 yrs ago so I had gotten 2 of these albums, never opening them until recently because I had been listening through Spotify… she began with one of my favorites, ALICE.\n\nReplay was up next and didn’t disappoint.. Lady Gaga’s favorite phrase of the night was, “Put your fucking hands up Boston!”…. I think mainly to show off these cool armbands they gave everyone as you entered the park. They lit up to the beat of the music and in the dark they looked awesome.\n\nMonster was the final song of Act I & for the casual fans of LG, they might not know this song that well but for Little Monsters, this song was epic… not often played but certainly a favorite among dedicated Gaga fans.\n\nAnd so the next video begins…up close of flowers blooming and opening, more like a viscerally charged feeling of an awakening is how to best describe it. I felt like I was on some sort of acid or mushroom trip (not having taken either but how I imagined it would be) feeling very aware of everything around me.\n\nACT II started with one my favorite songs released from Chromatica in 911. If you’ve haven’t seen the music video for this gem, check it out. It’s actually very disturbing to me & sort of makes me uncomfortable watching it but aesthetically, it’s worth the watch. It’s actually more of a short film because of its length. For more in depth reading on this video, you can read the Vogue article here.\n\nShe then went into a shortened version of Sour Candy…she basically started in the middle when her part comes in…she actually doesn’t sing a ton in this song anyway since it features the South Korean group, Black Pink, and they sing much of the song. The video screens kept flashing the words, Sour Candy & Take a Bite… and then some Korean word that I only assume said, Sour Candy….\n\nOut of all of LG’s songs, Telephone, is probably the least favorite of mine. It’s definitely a banger & fun to dance to but just one that doesn’t give me the feels (sorry to all who love this song). But here’s a clip, for those of you that do love it.\n\nGaga’s The Fame album was released on this day, August 19, 2008 & one of the most iconic songs was LoveGame. The lyrics, “Let’s have some this beat is sick, I want to take a ride on your disco stick” leaves nothing to the imagination & most people can figure out the reference. This song was her 3rd Number one single on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart.\n\nAs the second act ended, it was time to feature the guitar players doing their hard work on stage.. Ricky Tillo, Jonny Good and Tim Stewart can be seen here, jamming like they always do and have been for Gaga on her tours.\n\nThis outfit is iconic… my favorite wardrobe outfit of the night.. this is where Babylon starts… it’s like the golden Alien Princess Queen has arrived…. Love this!!!\n\nChromatica has so many great tracks on the album, it’s so hard to choose, which is my favorite, but Free Woman is definitely right up there. By this time, I was bouncing up and down, my hips were aching.. I didn’t even care if I couldn’t walk the next day (I could) but you would’ve had to drag me out of there kicking & screaming before I took a break to sit down. During this song, Gaga made her way down the middle of the aisles through the crowd surrounded by her bodyguard and dancers, so no one could even reach out & dare touch her. She had now made her way to a smaller stage with just a piano (a piano that looked like a something out of a space aged horror story).\n\nI’m not honestly sure how LG got to this stage for her costume change.. but her dancers were doing their thing at the end of Free Woman so she could make her way for her next few songs at the piano..\n\nAnd there she appears, I’ll just say, probably from a lift in the hole of the stage.. again, I will apologize for the feed as many people were taking videos and dancing so my shots aren’t as smooth as I’d like them to be.\n\nBorn This Way is probably my favorite song of hers. The message this song has for so many people whether you feel like an outcast, don’t think you fit in or just don’t feel comfortable with who you are.. these lyrics are especially,\n\nI’m beautiful in my way\n\n‘Cause God makes no mistakes\n\nI’m on the right track, baby\n\nI was born this way\n\nDon’t hide yourself in regret\n\nJust love yourself, and you’re set\n\nI’m on the right track, baby\n\nI was born this way, yeah\n\nLady Gaga – Born This Way lyrics\n\nThis song resonates very closely with the LGBTQ community but it also rings true for others as well. Love Yourself cuz you were Born This Way baby!\n\nAnd then we were on to ACT IV….this concert was going by too quick, I really wanted for her to slow down the pace & just my luck, this is where her 2 slow songs began.\n\nThis set started off with 2 of her hit songs from her film with Bradley Cooper, Born This Way. Shallow (featured above) and Always Remember Us This Way… her vocal ability really shines through on this one… you know she’s a good singer but here is a song where you listen and think, Wait…she’s an amazing singer.. just a beautiful song.\n\nEdge of Glory was next acoustically on the piano..this is a great song as well but of course this video is too long so I am unable to upload. This is where Lady Gaga took the time to address the issues of what is happening to the rights of women in this country..\n\n1000 Doves was another song she played acoustically, which apparently she told a story of how she wrote this on her porch and would sit out there all day writing songs… originally this song she intended on being acoustic.\n\nAt this point, I truly realized that my legs need a lot more toning as I could feel my hips aching just a bit only to get worse with still about 4 songs left to go. Just another great dance song off of Chromatica.. I love watching the shots of the crowd dancing and singing.\n\nCan you believe it? The show is almost over. I had studied the set list for over a month so I knew the order of songs and when it was going to be towards the end of the show.. right before the Finale, this video was played.. I do not have the entire video.\n\nThe first single off Chromatica was Stupid Love way back in 2020. It seems light years away but Stupid Love is everything we needed in that terrible year and when it came out I remember smiling and laughing at all the parody videos that had begun to emerge. Good times…\n\nThe end of Stupid Love….just waiting for next one…\n\nOf all the songs off of Chromatica, none had me singing it everyday in my office as this one did.. Rain on Me is a duet with Ariana Grande & if I had to name any songs of hers, I would say this one and another duet with another fave of mine, Mika. Other than these two songs, I know almost nothing of her music or her…except for personal stories splashed about in the news that I could care less about. But I do care about this song, in fact I LOVE this song. The only thing I find fault in is that it is too short.\n\nAnd so we arrive at the ENCORE and the very last song was Hold My Hand from the Top Gun 2 Soundtrack… before I forget, the flames that shot up on the stage were so hot and I was sitting at least 50 rows back.. WARNING to those who are sitting close may or may not have eyebrows after the show.\n\nDuring this song, Lady Gaga told a story of how the last time she was at Fenway Park in 2017, during her Joanne tour, that the Boston crowd helped her through the show and she wanted to thank them for it. She said, “She’d always be there to hold their hand.” Awwwwww.\n\nSo this long 2 year wait is suddenly over and now I feel like there is this void in me wanting more Gaga and her music. I truly believe that Lady Gaga is that special type of person who can always make you feel better about yourself whether it’s through her lyrics, music, spoken words or kind gestures. Her positive outlook on life even when she herself is in pain just goes to show what a strong person she is. We need more Lady Gaga’s in our lives. And always remember, PAWS UP!\n\nAnd don’t forget to buy some merch… here’s my new Be Free tshirt\n\nThis is long I know…but I wanted to really review from beginning to end. More interviews to come in September..\n\nUntil then I’m Your Music Stylist….."
