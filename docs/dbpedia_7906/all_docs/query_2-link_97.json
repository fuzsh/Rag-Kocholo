        "text": "This blog post is dedicated to my dear friend,\n\nJeff Goldstein\n\nwho spent many happy hours @ The Fillmore East\n\nThe Story of the Fillmore East begins here...\n\nLocated at the southwest corner of Second Avenue and Sixth Street was a venue that opened in 1925 as a vaudeville theater. Over the years, it took on various names and in the 1950's it was operating under the name of the Village Theater and operated as a venue that was known for its live music. At some point the theater was closed. From time to time, it opened to present various rock & roll shows. In 1968, Bill Graham, looking to expand his small empire of music venues located in San Francisco decided to buy the Village Theater.\n\n\"When Bill Graham first set foot inside the venue, its condition could only be described as terrible. As he had now announced it would open on March 8, there were less than two weeks to have it up and running. Work needed to be done, and fast.\n\n'The derelict building,' said future manager Kip Cohen, 'was actually converted into the Fillmore East in twelve unbelievable days.' John Morris, Joshua White, and Kip Cohen got down to business, bringing in Chip Monck as lighting director. Everything started came together.\n\nAt the outset, Bill Graham wanted a state-of-the-art sound and lighting system, so bands would not have to bring in their own. With three acts playing two shows a night, it was vital to streamline the operation and prevent bands from parking forty-foot trucks outside and lugging heavy equipment in and out of the building.\n\nGraham then hired pioneering sound technician Bill Hanley to create a sound system for his new rock theater. The Hanley Sound System, as it became known, cost $35,000, and Graham only leased it from Hanley, who retained ownership. It consisted of twenty-six speakers, including some manufactured for civil defense alerts, strategically placed around the theater with a total power source of 35,000 watts. There were professional-grade mixing consoles, as well as a two-ton center cluster speaker system, suspended over the center of the stage using a series of fly weights. The sound level could often break the 100 decibel level, and the cluster had to be perfectly positioned, aiming the sound into the audience so there would be no echoing.\n\nOn February 29, 1968, during the height of the theater’s transformation, the first advertisement appeared in the Village Voice for the Big Brother and the Holding Company opening at Bill Graham’s Fillmore East. And the box office was now open for the reserved-section tickets, selling for $3, $4, and $5 dollars. Bill Graham had initially wanted to turn the Village Theater into a ballroom, but that proved too expensive. So he kept the 2,645 seats and introduced reserve seating, in the manner of a Broadway theater.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, March 8, a nervous Bill Graham and his team were still frantically putting the final touches to the Fillmore East right before they opened the doors for the very first show at the Fillmore East.\" (John Glatt, Live at the Fillmore East and West, Lyons Press)\n\n\"Up on the balcony level was the perfect stoned-hippie-food concession that offered up fresh fruit and juices, donuts, bagels with cream cheese, and best of all, Dannon Yogurt, in a wide selection of flavors.\n\nWhen he was in New York, Graham could often be found operating from a makeshift office at a rear table of Ratner’s Delicatessen, next door to the venue. It took a few months for the venue to get up to speed.\n\nAs was Graham’s practice at the original Fillmore, the venue booked two shows a night, usually three bands playing early and late sets, starting at 8 and 11:30, and often running extra-late, especially if the Grateful Dead were headlining. In the case of the three shows the Dead played with the Allman Brothers and Love , all three gigs ended after dawn.\n\nUnlike Graham’s unseated general admission shows in San Francisco, the Fillmore East cleared the house between shows, did a clean-up, and started over again. With a translucent rear-stage curtain used by the Joshua Light Show, the stage crew rotated custom wheeled drum risers and amplifiers for extra-quick set-changes. Above them, the Joshua Light Show kept fans entertained with cartoons and other visual amusements, in large part to keep the audience from overcrowding the tiny lobby areas.\n\nThe classic shows happened frequently in front of the tough New York crowds. The first year of the Fillmore East saw Sly Stone’s east coast breakout, Rod Stewart’s American debut (opening for the Dead with the Jeff Beck Group), and a pair of shows that began with Led Zeppelin as the opening act for Iron Butterfly and ended the other way around. There wasn’t music every night, and Graham shut the venue down almost entirely during the summers of 1968 and 1969. It was during that latter summer that the venue’s core staff became the basic team that staged Woodstock. The Fillmore East soon became the focal point in New York’s media eye. “After Woodstock, all the famous things happened, and then it went downhill,” Joshua White would observe.\" (The Gothamist)\n\nBill Graham outside The Fillmore East\n\non opening night March 8, 1968\n\nWhen the Fillmore East doors opened for the first time, everybody rushed into the lobby thereby causing mass confusion. Crowd control had not been considered by Graham and some of the attending celebrities had a difficult time making their way to their VIP seats. The Fillmore East opening was a smash and received massive coverage from the local press.\n\nAfter its initial opening concert, Fillmore East was off to a great start. Graham used his connections from his days at the Fillmore West to sign up all of the \"heavy\" bands to play his new venue in New York city.\n\n\"I went into the crowded lobby and I saw people in there, begging for tickets. I saw this girl who looked really dejected, and she was begging, and I didn’t want to beg. But, I’m good at looking dejected and sad. So, I copied the look of that desperate girl I saw, and a guy came up to me and said something like, “you look like you could use a ticket,” and he gave me one. He must have been a record company guy, he was handing out a few tickets.\n\nSo, this guy gives me a ticket. But, I wanted to save the ticket as a souvenir. So, I figured I would try my usual tricks to sneak in. I tried the guest list trick. There was a special entrance for guest list people, so I inched over to the guest list door and tried to sneak a look at the clipboard. I finally saw a name I could pronounce, it was in bold text, and it was easy to read off of the clipboard. The name was “Herb Cohen.”\n\nSo, I told the guy that I was Herb Cohen, and I got in.\n\nOnce I got in, I was awestruck, seeing everyone in the lobby. I was standing there, staring at all of the people, and after a while, I heard screaming nearby. The screaming was from the real Herb Cohen, who was mad that someone else used his name.\n\nThere was a big commotion and Bill Graham had to come up front. They got the real Herb Cohen in, and I disappeared in the crowd and they never found me.\" (Thom Lukas, Photographer)\n\nIn the March 28th edition of the Village Voice, Howard Smith noted in his Scenes column, “Bill Graham has been putting on some beautiful, well-run concerts at his Fillmore East,” describing how the promoter gave audience die-hards more than their money’s worth.\n\nOn occasion, the Fillmore East would spring for halftone photos when announcing such acts as Ravi Shankar (playing his sitar), or the first New York appearance of 'the reigning number one space group in the known world''\" (Village Voice)\n\nBesides setting up the Fillmore East with an excellent sound system, Bill Graham also employed visual excitement with the Joshua Light Show which played a major part in establishing a unique addition to his concerts. This was a tactic that he had learned a lot about during his early years as a promoter in San Francisco during the Summer of Love. The Summer of Love was a social phenomenon that occurred during the summer of 1967, when as many as 100,000 people, mostly young people sporting hippie fashions of dress and behavior, converged in San Francisco's neighborhood of Haight-Ashbury.\n\n\"'In fashion terms a Fillmore East opening night deserves as much coverage as the Philharmonic Galanosed Galas,' claimed the Village Voice shortly after the rock auditorium opened in March 1968. 'It's a scene-making pageant whether they're seeing Lenny at Lincoln Center or Jimi at the Fillmore.' In 1968, Bill Graham...tied together the pageantry in the audience with the fireworks on stage when he organized a mini fashion happening during an interval in the evening's mixed bill. Unheralded, Barbara Mott, wife of designer Michael Mott, zoomed up the center aisle of the rock palace on an enormous Harley Davidson. Dressed in Mott's black leather bra top and miniskirt pegged with hobnail studs, she tore up a ramp to the stage and parked her vehicle to the accompaniment of a cannonade of cheers from the Fillmore's audience.\" (Joel Lobenthal,Radical Rags: Fashions of the Sixties, Abbeville, 1990)\n\nThe Fillmore East was quickly dubbed \"The Church of Rock and Roll,\" with two-show, triple-bill concerts several nights a week. With the immediate success of the venue, things got very hectic for Bill Graham as he travelled back and forth to the west coast to administer his shows there and then fly back to New York to handle the Fillmore East shows. His solution to this was to wear two wrist watches, each one set to a different time zone.\n\nMarch 22nd & 23rd The Doors, Ars Nova, Crome Syrcus\n\nOne of the biggest attractions in the early days of the Fillmore East took place when The Doors performed at the venue on March 22nd 1968.\n\n\"On Friday, March 22, The Doors headlined the first weekend of sold-out shows at the Fillmore East. At the Friday early show, Jim Morrison introduced a new song called Unknown Soldier before going into an extended Celebration of the Lizard. The late show began with the band onstage but no sign of Morrison. Then, as keyboardist Ray Manzarek played the haunting first notes of When the Music’s Over, the leather-clad singer appeared, launching himself over the drum kit and grabbing the microphone just in time to scream the opening line. During an extended version of Light My Fire, he swung the microphone over the heads of the audience lariat-style, letting it out a little more with each circle. A worried Bill Graham then tore straight into the audience at the front of the stage, frantically waving at Morrison. ‘I could see that sooner or later he was going to lose it and I didn’t want it to hit anybody. I was standing maybe ten people back, waving my arms trying to catch his attention, and then he loses it. And out of two thousand people in the hall, it hits me right in the head!’ Back in the dressing room after the show, Graham nursed his injured head and joked about it. The next time The Doors played for Graham, the singer brought him a pith helmet for protection.” (John Glatt, Live at the Fillmore East and West, Lyons Press)\n\n\"In the early show on Friday, giving his all and extremely stoned, Jim falls into the lighting pit! Later during the same performance, Jim introduces the New York premiere of The Unknown Soldier by pretending to be a college professor and asking the “class” to pay close attention to the movie because afterward there will be an exam. After the movie they play The Unknown Soldier followed by what is possibly the first full length rendition of The Celebration of The Lizard.\n\nIn the late show on Friday, The Doors open with When The Music’s Over in which Jim, seemingly absent, comes flying over the drum kit and leaping down in front of the microphone just in time to scream the opening and signals the beginning of what is to be a totally outstanding show.\n\nIn the early show on Saturday, the audiences on their way to the Fillmore has picked a considerable amount of daffodils and throughout the show they are flung onto the stage. Jim picks some up and methodically places a few on each members instrument and between songs seemingly picks on John by placing many on his drums and under his nose in an attempt to get him going.\n\nIn the opening number of the second show on Saturday, Jim holds onto the rising curtain to the point of maximum safe height and even a little more before letting go at the very last second soaring down right in front of the microphone in perfect timing to open the show with his characteristic introductory scream. The band plays The Unknown Soldier and follows it up with live performances of the song during each show this evening and do Celebration again during the late show. After Saturday’s late show The Doors are in such a good mood they tell Bill Graham they want to do another encore. Graham comes out on stage as the audience is filing out and asks them if they want some more, which they graciously accept, and the band ends up playing another entire set lasting over an hour.\n\nAfterward, Bill Graham took Jim and the band to Ratner’s, the old Lower East Side kosher dairy restaurant next door to the theater, for an early breakfast of blintzes and potato pancakes. Albert Goldman, who was profiling Jim for Vogue, noted that Jim automatically sat at the head of the table, and decided he must have an authoritarian personality.\" (boweryboogie.com)\n\nThe fourth weekend of the Fillmore East’s existence was headlined by The Who, April 5th and 6th, 1968. \"The Who arrived in New York in classically belligerent mood. They were at the end of a long US tour and had already been forced to move hotels after Keith Moon started blowing up bits of the Waldorf Astoria. On the morning of the rehearsal, the exhausted group were photographed by Life slumped by a statue in Morningside Park, sleeping under a Union flag. The Who had played this venue the previous year when it was called the Village Theater, but this was the first time they’d performed there since Billy Graham turned it into the Fillmore East in March 1968. Midway through the show, Townshend and Daltrey recall that in its previous incarnation it was a pisshole. The original plan was to play four short shows over two nights, but due to security concerns following MLK’s death, the band instead agreed to play two longer shows. That’s what allowed them to draw out the extended My Generation, and to deliver a couple of mid-set mini-epics in the form of A Quick One and a wild 11-minute take on Relax, one of The Who’s more psychedelic songs. That day The Who delivered a show with the muscular sincerity that made The Who such a compelling and memorable live act.\" (Rock Prosopography 1010 blog)\n\nApril 12th & 13th Butterfield Blues Band, Charles Lloyd, Tom Rush\n\n\"The Butterfield Blues Band had come out of Chicago in late 1965 as America’s premier white blues band. They featured guitarists Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop. Bloomfield had moved to San Francisco and started the Electric Flag by this time, but Bishop was still in Butterfield’s group. The group had just released The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw (Elektra Feb 68) heralding Bishop’s newly-prominent role. However, rather than the guitar-oriented Chicago style blues of the first two albums, Butterfield’s new sound was closer to soul, with a three-piece horn section.\n\nElvin Bishop would leave the Butterfield band within two months of this show, and he too would move to the Bay Area and start his own band. Mark Naftalin, the group's original keyboard player, was also still with the band, but he too would leave shortly after this and move to the Bay Area. The other members of the group were probably Bugsy Maugh on bass, Philip Wilson on drums and Gene Dinwiddie (tenor sax) and Keith Johnson (trumpet) on horns, possibly with Dave Sanborn (alto). Sanborn had toured with the group in late 1967 and early 1968, but I don't know how long he stayed.\n\nThe Butterfield Blues Band already had a lengthy and fruitful relationship with Bill Graham at the Fillmore, but it is worth noting that this is the third act managed by Albert Grossman that headlined the theater in its first six weeks of operation. That being said, the original powerhouse Butterfield Blues Band, with Mike Bloomfield in his prime, had played some seminal shows at the original Fillmore, helping to make both the venue and the band, so they were a great choice to help establish the Fillmore East.\n\nCharles Lloyd, a tenor sax player, was a regular at the SF Fillmore. His group, playing undiluted modern jazz in the style of Miles Davis, may still have included Keith Jarrett, Ron McClure and Jack DeJohnette. Lloyd was the first jazz act to become a regular in the hippie ballrooms around the country, and while his jazz remain undiminished he found himself a whole new audience that served him well. He even recorded an album at The Fillmore, a fine record called Love-In, released in January 1967. His current album was In Europe (Atlantic 1968).\n\nTom Rush was a popular Cambridge, MA folkie. He had signed to Elektra and started to make folk-rock albums His 6th album, The Circle Game (Elektra 1968) featured two songs by Joni Mitchell as well as songs by then-unknowns Jackson Browne and James Taylor. Although he is largely forgotten today, Rush was instrumental in bringing attention to these writers. Kostelanetz reports that the light show was halted for ‘serious’ folk performers like Tom Rush or Richie Havens.\" (rockprosopography101.blogspot.com)\n\nApril 19th & 20th Mothers Of Invention, James Cotton\n\n\"The Mothers lineup for this show would have been FZ, Don Preston (organ), Ian Underwood (keyboards, reeds), Bunk Gardner (reeds), Motorhead Sherwood (baritone sax), Roy Estrada (bass, vocals), Jimmy Carl Black (Indian of the group, drums) and Artie Tripp (drums, percussion). Ray Collins (sometime lead vocalist) had an ambiguous status and may or may not have appeared.\n\nHarmonica master James Cotton had replaced Little Walter in Muddy Water’s band in the late 1950s, and now led his own group, probably featuring Luther Tucker on guitar, Albert Gianquinto on piano (who later wrote some songs for Santana), and Francis Clay on drums.\" (liveshowshistory.com)\n\nApril 26-27, 1968: Traffic, Blue Cheer, Iron Butterfly\n\nThis was Traffic’s first American tour, which began on March 14 in San Francisco at The Fillmore. The group was originally a quartet, with Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Chris Wood and Dave Mason. However, the mercurial Mason quit and rejoined the group regularly, and he had apparently left the group prior to their American tour, which had begun in March.\n\nTraffic was one of the first groups to emphasize overdubbing as a means of creating different sounds on different songs. Winwood, Mason and Wood played numerous instruments, and clever use of the studio meant that Traffic songs could be anything from frothy pop ballads with flute and sitar to heavy rock with twin lead guitars and organ. Live, however, Traffic’s sound was very different, as it depended on Winwood’s versatile organ playing (including the bass pedals), and they were more like a typical (if excellent) British R&B combo. For whatever reasons, Dave Mason reappeared in New York and joined the group onstage for at least one of the four performances. He would rejoin the group for the recording of their next album.\n\nBlue Cheer were an SF power trio, backed by LSD king Owsley Stanley, and named after a brand of his acid. Owsley bought the band tons of equipment (supposedly Blue Cheer had 12 Marshall Stacks, 6 each for bass and guitar), and they were famously loud. Unlike other peace-and-love SF bands, Blue Cheer had a noisy, nasty sound and demeanor. Their quasi-hit, a remake of Eddie Cochran’s “Summertime Blues” is a precursor to Heavy Metal.\n\nIron Butterfly were originally from San Diego, and had relocated to Los Angeles in late 1966. They were touring behind their first album Heavy.\n\n\"The first appearance of the Jefferson Airplane at the Fillmore East featured the classic Airplane with Grace Slick and Marty Balin (along with Kaukonen / Kantner / Casady / Dryden), the flagship of San Francisco’s Summer of Love. The current album was After Bathing At Baxter’s. Unlike almost every other band at Fillmore East, the Airplane did not use the Joshua Light Show, but their own light show (Glenn McKay’s Head Lights). For the encore on Saturday night, some reports indicate that various drummers sat in for Spencer Dryden, the first being Mitch Mitchell (of the Jimi Hendrix Experience). All four sets of the Airplane were casually recorded by Fillmore East soundman John Chester.\" (liveshowshistory.com)\n\nMay 10, 1968 Jimi Hendrix Experience & Sly and The Family Stone\n\n\"The Friday night bill at Fillmore East was a rock bill for the ages, featuring one of the biggest rock acts in the world, supported by a group that would soon join Hendrix at the mountaintop. Jimi Hendrix Experience were big and getting bigger, but Bill Graham always excelled at persuading bands and their management that performing at his showcases in San Francisco and New York always paid more dividends than playing a larger place.\n\nThese shows featured the original Experience, with Noel Redding on bass and Mitch Mitchell on drums.One of Hendrix's shows featured a 17-minute performance of Red House, and the lucky patrons who caught either the early or late show never forgot it.\n\nSly and The Family Stone were truly electrifying performers, and in Joel Selvin’s biography of the reports that their set culminated with Sly, Freddie and Larry Graham dancing into the aisles and leading the crowd out into the street, while Gregg Errico and the horn section wailed away. They absolutely killed the house, and that was before Hendrix came in and shattered the place, and they did it all over at the late show. Truly a night to remember at Fillmore East.\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience never played the Fillmore East again, although Band Of Gypsies did play there (in 1970). However, Hendrix hung out regularly at Fillmore East, when he could, and was a familiar figure backstage.\" (Rock Prosopography 101 blog)\n\nShortly after the Fillmore East opened, one of the sound technicians secretly fed a wire from the mixing consul out of the Fillmore to an upstairs apartment to record all the shows in two-track stereo on ten-inch reel-to-reel tapes. Many years later, these priceless recordings of hundreds of Fillmore East shows would become part of the Bill Graham Archives, later to be bought by Wolfgang’s Vault and made available to the public.\n\nCountry Joe & The Fish\n\nSoon enough, the Fillmore East was taking off as audiences flocked to see the eclectic bills that Bill Graham now presented. In May, Country Joe and the Fish had played shows at the Fillmore Auditorium and Winterland in San Francisco before making their debut at the Fillmore East a week later.\n\nThe two opening acts were Pigmeat Markham, who had just had a huge hit with the novelty song “Here Comes the Judge,” and Blue Cheer, probably the loudest band to ever play there. Pigmeat Markham and Blue Cheer?! My mind reels at the thought of it.\n\nOn the weekend of June 14, 1968, the Grateful Dead played the Fillmore East for the first time. Former Yardbirds’ guitarist Jeff Beck opened for them, with future Rolling Stone Ron Wood and his then-unknown singer Rod Stewart, making his American debut.\n\n\"By the end of 1968, ushers had started handing out programs to patrons at each concert. These pamphlets contained performers’ biographies, editorials, public service announcements, and even a guide to other music events around town. Bill Graham was also branching out with eclectic bills, pairing artists from all over the musical spectrum and introducing them to his young rock audience. On January 17, veteran jazz drummer Buddy Rich and his orchestra headlined the Fillmore East, with the Los Angeles rock band Spirit opening. Bill Graham knew he could even risk booking lesser-known jazz greats like Woody Herman or Charles Lloyd, who wouldn’t be able to headline, as long as he had a big draw like Led Zeppelin or the Jimi Hendrix Experience.\" (John Glatt, Live at the Fillmore East and West, Lyons Press)\n\nMay 10th 1968 Jimi Hendrix, Sly & Family Stone\n\n\"On May 10, 1968 the Jimi Hendrix Experience played two shows at New York City’s famed 2,600 seat Fillmore East. Hendrix was in town working diligently on his upcoming record yet to be named, Electric Ladyland. It worked out perfectly that while Jimi was recording in the city at the Record Plant, he could and would also play some local concerts.\n\nThis particular era for the Experience found them enormously popular, prolifically creative and playing seditious concerts throughout the year that left audiences stunned while growing Hendrix’s legend. Jimi’s fame was ascending at a furious rate and he was revolutionizing guitar with every concert and recording produced. Which takes us back to May 10, 1968’s evening performance. Following the afternoon concert and evening concert’s opening act, Sly and the Family Stone, Hendrix took the stage to a sold out room. The Joshua Light Show morphing the stage into a pulsating, liquescent musical mass.\n\nThe evening begins with ‘Lover Man’, an extended introduction features an exotic bit of riffing illustrating Hendrix is feeling frisky this spring evening in NYC. Jimi’s guitar tone is paunchy and the sound of Bill Graham’s room is crystalline. The Experience stomps through their opening number with deft precision. The first Hendrix solo takes off with Redding’s giant bass grumble setting the foundation. Jimi immediately struts his stuff with a vertiginous series of soaring and diving bends. Devastating stuff, and the crowd responds in kind.\n\nA searing reading of ‘Fire’ follows hot on the heels of ‘Lover Man’. The band has the arrangement in their crosshairs. Mitch Mitchell is punishing his kit filling each empty pause in the song with a crashing series of alien triplets.\n\nHendrix is obviously in a groovy mood as he and Noel Redding takes a chance to speak to the crowd following ‘Fire’. 'Foxy Lady' follows and begins with the buzzing of electricity and hissing of overdriven amplifiers. The band is frightening in their sound, Jimi barley stays tethered to the earth during the first solo spot. What begins as a smooth bluesy exploration quickly becomes a clinic of molten strings and elongated bends.\n\nA pause between the songs, features someone from the crowd yelling to the stage, ‘Take off your hat!’ To which Jimi replies, 'I’ll Take off my hat if you take off your pants’. The centerpiece of the show then follows and is a deep and conversational reading of a 15 minute ‘Red House’. The following ‘Red House’ ranges from delicate to distorted and then decorated with silvery strands of feedback. Hendrix does a call and response throughout the verses with his six string vocals\n\n‘Red House’ begins, with a delicate groove and smooth probing by Hendrix. His tone, a sweet velvet beam, or a musical insect exploring for the rich pollen payoff. While ‘Red House’ was nearly always a highlight of Hendrix shows, here it ascends to different and multiple levels. The journey over yonder is filled with detours and unique fragments maybe not always related buy nonetheless stunning. Hendrix’s guitar positively moans during the prelude. The sound improves on the recording unbelievably as the cymbals and bass are not as loud so Hendrix’s tone can be discerned reverberating off of the walls of the hall.\n\nHendrix lets loose with a plethora of rutted and gravel filled licks and with a nonverbal signal takes a spin around the drive with dirty trill to which Mitchell matches with a tempo increase. Let off his leash Jimi begins to move at a different time and space than Noel and Mitch diverging into his rock and roll tool belt with some inexplicably abrasive takes on recognizable licks. At seven minutes, Redding and Mitchell come to the forefront as a delicate shuffle coagulates. Hendrix taps his strings, a breeze pushing the jam forward. Mitchell takes a brief solo spot as Redding and Hendrix fade. The crowd appreciates his abilities and responds in kind. At around ten minutes Hendrix returns with a succulent watery tone from his wah-wah, the band drops out as Jimi constructs a hallucinatory narrative. A return to the verses is a welcome relief from the jaw clenching Hendrix solo spot.\n\nA substantial wall of soaring feedback follows and precedes a strutting and crowd pleasing ‘Hey Joe’. This is the Jimi Hendrix Experience at the peak of their fame in one of the most famous music venues in history, playing one of their most popular cuts. The song is ignited with high octane gas and burned to ash.\" (talkfromtherockroom.com)\n\nMay 17-18, 1968\n\nThe Byrds, Tim Buckley, The Foundations\n\n\"The Byrds had been major rock stars since 1965. They had even played the venue in its previous incarnation, The Village Theater (on July 22, 1967, supported by The Seeds and Vanilla Fudge). By 1968, however, while still popular, The Byrds had been through numerous personal and musical changes, and were not as highly ranked in the firmament as before.\n\nThe review in Billboard magazine was a crucial element of Fillmore East's importance. Billboard was the leading music industry trade journal, and in many ways the only source of information about bands on tour. One of the weekend performances in Fillmore East was always reviewed in each week's Billboard, so that meant that all three bands on the bill got National exposure. Managers, particularly of English bands, liked to start tours at the Fillmore East because a good review in Billboard could go a long way towards creating interest in their group amongst booking agents and promoters.\n\nThe Foundations are mainly known for their 1968 hit Build Me Up Buttercup. Much to the surprise of everyone who recalls the song, they were actually an English group (with some West Indians and a Sri Lankan thrown in for good measure). The Foundations were one of the few English groups to have success playing in a soul style. They had plenty of live experience in England, and they were probably a pretty good live band. In Hjort's book, Foundations bassist Peter Macbeth recalled that their equipment was stolen and that the Byrds wouldn't let them borrow theirs. Equipment hassles were particularly critical at the Fillmore East, since bands rightly felt the pressure of needing to have a great performance there in order to have a successful tour.\" (rockprosopography101.blogspot.com)\n\nMay 27th - 30th\n\nRichie Havens, The Troggs, United States of America\n\nMay 31st - June 1st\n\nMoby Grape, The Fugs, Gary Burton\n\n\"Moby Grape had been hyped as the best band to come out of San Francisco. That may have been true, as it happened, but the hype did them in. Moby Grape was made up of 5 experienced musicians, all good singers, performers and writers, and handsome to boot. Their second album Wow! had been released just before this show. It was a good album, but not as good as their epic first album, and the underground suspicion of anything popular undermined them. They were beset with management problems and other frustrations, and their best songwriter and resident genius Skip Spence started to have serious drug and emotional problems at this time, so the net effect was very difficult for the band. By all accounts, what should have been a triumphant appearance at the Fillmore East was rendered somewhat ragged because Peter Lewis, angry at the band for various reasons, skipped out on the tour and went home early.\n\nSadly, these Fillmore East shows were Spence's last stand with the Grape for some decades, as shortly after these shows, Skip Spence had an episode where he lost touch with reality, went AWOL for a few days and tended up in the Psych Ward at Bellevue Hospital. In any case, after the Fillmore East Moby Grape were effectively reduced to a four-piece band, albeit a very talented one (guitarists Jerry Miller and Peter Lewis, bassist Bob Mosley and drummer Don Stevenson). Although they still had plenty to offer, they now had to live down their previous success rather than just be themselves. Moby Grape were a great band, and their debut album is a 60s classic, but their entire history is a frustrating tale of what might have been.\n\nThe Fugs were often considered as a Greenwich Village version of The Mothers of Invention, although a more accurate comparison might have been Berkeley’s Country Joe and The Fish. The Fugs were not particularly memorable musically, but they were provocative and exciting. They had been around for some time, and in fact had played the first Bill Graham Mime Troupe Benefit on November 6, 1965. In complete contrast to Zappa, they were very political, but only barely musical, singing songs like Kill For Peace and Coca-Cola Douche.\n\nGary Burton was a jazz vibraphonist, raised in Nashville and like many young jazz musicians in New York at the time, he liked everything, not just jazz. The original lineup of the groundbreaking Gary Burton Quartet, featuring guitarist Larry Coryell had opened for Cream at San Francisco's Fillmore, among many other rock gigs, and they had released some sensational albums that still sound great today (including Duster and Lofty Fake Anagram on RCA in 1967). By the time of the Fillmore East shows, Coryell had left the group, replaced by the less well-known but still tremendous guitarist Jerry Hahn, formerly with John Handy amongst various others.\" (rockprosopography101.blogspot.com)\n\nOther Scenes (Village Voice, June 1 1968)\n\nJune 14th, 1968\n\nGrateful Dead perform \"Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks)\"\n\ninto \"Feedback\" at the Fillmore East\n\nJune 21st\n\nVanilla Fudge, James Cotton Blues Band, Loading Zone\n\n\"The Vanilla Fudge practically invented ‘heavy’ rock, doing songs slow and loud, with plenty of Hammond organ and feedback mixed in with highly emoted R&B style vocals. Bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice were very well-recorded, and their thunderous attack was transformational for English musicians, particularly or members of the yet-to-be-formed Led Zeppelin. The Fudge had released a heavy rock version of the Supremes You Keep Me Hanging On (the album version of which was 7 minutes long), and the effect was enormous. In America and England, musicians everywhere realized you could turn one kind of music into another.\" (All Music)\n\nSeptember 1968\n\nThe Chambers Brothers\n\nBlood Sweat & Tears\n\nOct. 4th & 5th 1968 Sly & The Family Stone\n\nFor whatever reason, Bill Graham didn’t see what other people saw in Sly and The Family Stone. Initially he wasn’t won over by their unique brand of dance music. As a result, he was reluctant to book Sly Stone and his band. Eventually, though, Bill Graham was persuade to go and see Sly and The Family Stone live. This changed his mind.\n\nSly and The Family Stone in full flight were a musical powerhouse. Their fusion of soul, funk and psychedelia was winning friends and influencing people. They certainly won over Bill Graham. So much so, that Bill Graham booked Sly and The Family Stone to open for Eric Burdon and The Animals at four concerts a the Fillmore East in October 1968.\n\nFrom the moment Sly and The Stone strike up Are You Ready, they’re in the funkiest of grooves. They work their way through Colour Me True, Won’t Be Long, We Love All (Freedom) and a medley of Turn Me Loose, I Can’t Turn You Loose. By then, Sly and The Family Stone have won over the Fillmore East. While they were just the support band, they were more than making an impression. Closing the show, were two tracks from Life, Chicken and Love City. As Sly and The Family Stone walked of the stage of The Fillmore East, it was to a standing ovation.\n\nWhen Sly and The Family Stone opened their late show, it was with two different tracks. M’Lady from Life opened the show, before they turned their attention to Don’t Burn Baby from Dance To The Music. Then Sly and The Family return to Colour Me True and Won’t, Be Long. From there, they drop in St. James Infirmary, which was already a staple of Sly and The Family’s live show. Somehow, Sly and The Family were matching, and sometimes, surpassing the quality of the early show. They were on a mission.\n\nIt was the perfect time to drop in their medley of Turn Me Loose, I Can’t Turn You Loose, and then Dance To The Music. By now, everyone in The Fillmore East seems to be on their feet. Now that Sly and The Family Stone have them where they want them, they close the show with Music Love and finally, a medley of Life and Music Lover.\" (dereksmusicblog.com)\n\nOctober 18th & 19th 1968 - Jeff Beck, Tim Buckley, Albert King\n\nJeff Beck hitting the groove\n\nOct / Nov 1968\n\nNovember 9th 1968 - Steppenwolf, Buddy Rich, Children Of God\n\nNovember 22nd & 23rd\n\nIron Butterfly, Canned Heat & The Youngbloods\n\n\"It was a Friday, two weeks after my 20th birthday. I’d started playing bass about a year-and-a-half before, rock and blues. More recently, I’d fallen deeply in love with soul music, Otis Redding, above all. Otis had died almost exactly one year before and I regretted that I would never get to see him live. But my other Stax/Volt favorites, Sam & Dave, were playing that night at the Fillmore East, which had opened in February of that year. No way was I going to miss this show.\n\nAs I recall, I went by myself, walked up to the box office and bought a ticket, which cost around $4. I sat somewhere in the middle of the orchestra and settled in for the show, a triple bill, like most Fillmore concerts.\n\nThe opening act was Earth Opera, a Boston band which starred then-unknowns Peter Rowan and David Grisman. I don’t remember a thing about their set.\n\nBut the second act was a different story: Super Session with Al Kooper and Mike Bloomfield. At first I was a bummed out that Stephen Stills, who played on the first Super Session album, was not present, but I was still psyched to hear Kooper and Bloomfield. I was a big Al Kooper fan from his work with the Blues Project. And from the moment I fell in love – hard – with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Bloomfield was one of my guitar favorites. And I had witnessed Kooper and Butterfield on stage together once before at what turned out to be an historic event: Bob Dylan’s 1965 concert in Forest Hills (the one where a riot broke out).\n\nNot far into the Super Session set, Bloomfield stepped up to the microphone and, as I remember it, told a story about encountering this musician from Texas – 'the baddest motherfucker' – the night before at a Manhattan rock club, Steve Paul’s The Scene. And then Bloomfield introduced Johnny Winter.\n\nA wraith-like figure in black, the better to set off his milk white skin and flowing corn silk hair, walked across the stage. The band went into a blues number. Johnny pulled out a harmonica and started to wail. Absolutely killer.\n\nThe next song, B.B. King’s It’s My Own Fault, kicked off with a Bloomfield solo. When it was time for the vocal – surprise! – not Kooper, not Bloomfield, but Winter started to sing. Oh. My. God. How was all that sound coming out of this freak’s stick figure body?\n\nAnd then he picked up a guitar and started to play. You have to imagine the context to appreciate the impact of this audacious unknown. He wasn’t just playing taking a solo, he was daring to follow the great Mike Bloomfield – and more than holding his own. Stunning. Was this skeletal apparition the next blues/rock guitar god?\n\nOn that night in 1968, the Fillmore audience was blown away by Kooper and Bloomfield and especially Johnny Winter, who came riding out of nowhere like an albino vision of a wild west gunslinger. But the show was far from over. Unbelievably, it got even better. Sam & Dave came onstage backed by a huge band featuring two drummers and about a dozen horn players, as if hellbent on blowing away the Fillmore hippies, a far different crowd than their usual audience. And it worked. Sam & Dave’s combination of fiery vocals and exuberant showmanship won over the Fillmore as surely as Otis conquered the Monterey International Pop Festival. Suffice to say, I got far more than my four dollars worth at the Fillmore.\" (thekatztapes.com)\n\nDecember 18 - MC5\n\nWayne Kramer shares his memories of the show he and his band, the MC5, played at the Fillmore East: \"Elektra Records wanted to present their new acquisition. The MC5, to New York City with a big bang. It was a bang too, but not the one they had in mind. A climate existed in the Lower East Side of Manhattan where a group of militant radicals called the 'East Village Motherfuckers' had forced promoter Bill Graham to let them use the Fillmore on Wednesday nights. Community Nights was what they called them. Anyhow, we went in and played a free and unadvertised Wednesday night show for our comrades in the Community. The gig went down fine and a good time was had by all.\n\nThe following Wednesday, Elektra rented the Fillmore and did a huge radio promotion with ticket giveaways on the air and all the accompanying hoopla. The Motherfuckers were pissed off about losing their night and demanded Graham give up free tickets for them and their peeps. Graham was not the kind of guy to back down to intimidation, so he stood out in front of the theater and held the Motherfuckers off with sheer heart and moxie. For his bother, some Motherfuckers beat him with a chain and broke his nose. Graham, in his delirium, thought MC5 singer Rob Tyner was the chain wielder, and promptly banned the MC5 from working at either Fillmore, or, for that matter, any other venue he controlled. He also used his considerable influence to make sure that we didn’t work for any of his friends in the promotion business either.\n\nMeanwhile, as all this is going down out front, the band is on-stage trying to do our big NYC debut show. The stage wings were crowded with Motherfuckers waiting for us to give the word to burn the place down. Of course we weren’t about to give any such command and their anger started to turn on us. I tried my brush back technique and got little in the way of working room. Tough crowd. We finished our set and escaped to the dressing room while the motherfuckers and the street maniacs tried to run out the door with our gear. Our crew valiantly battles to hold on to our stuff and the greatest blunder in record business tactics imaginable happens: two limousines show up to carry the band back to the hotel. The revolutionaries saw red! “Limos!” The symbol of capitalist imperial-ism. Limos. The Motherfucker women were screaming and weeping about how we had sold the revolution out. They were smashing our records against the Cadillac limos tail fins. Crying at the top of their lungs: 'Bastards! Pigs! Phonies! Sell-outs!'\n\nI stopped in the street as the guys ran for the cars. I knew I had to straighten this out ASAP. This was bad, bad, bad. They got it all wrong. They didn’t understand. I need to fix this. So there I stood, in the middle of an angry mob trying to explain White Panther/MC5 political theory, while Motherfuckers are agitating the speed freaks and street nuts into taking swipes at me with their knives. Finally, two Motherfucker lieutenants pick me up and cover me with their bodies to get me out of the crowd and down Second Avenue to safety. Not a giant riot, but a sure thrill for my young ass.\"\n\nDecember 31 New Year's Eve\n\nChambers Brothers, Mother Earth, Joshua Light Show\n\nI came across this article about the Fillmore East that was written by a fella named Charlie Finch. He describes his experiences at Bill Graham's fabled music venue:\n\n\"Oh to be 16 again, dangling your legs over the balcony rail at the Fillmore East, a big bag of weed on your lap, your longhaired, free-loving babe snuggling your shoulder, and a sheet of water-pure windowpane acid in the pocket of your flannel shirt. On stage, the most beautiful woman in the world, Grace Slick, leans against an amp, intoning her immortal Bear Melt while the oil-based mandalas of Joshua Light bounce around her. Bliss!\n\nJust remembering the bills I saw at Bill Graham’s East Village pleasure palace sends flashbacks up my spine: The Dead, Love and the Allman Brothers; The Mothers of Invention and the Youngbloods; The Kinks and the Byrds. Of course, there were the phenomenal Jefferson Airplane concerts that were always followed the next day by an even longer, better, more cosmic, free set in Central Park. And who can forget those weird Fillmore opening acts: Sea Train, The Sons of Champlin, Stone the Crows and a guy named Chris who played gongs with various parts of his body and always opened for the Airplane?\n\nFillmore habitués were divided into two classes: Airplane freaks (like yours truly) and Deadheads. Each liked and respected the other’s group, attending each others’ gigs, but there were differences. For Airplane freaks, Ms. Slick was Alpha and Omega, her searing voice and long dark hair riding the chuggachuggachugga of Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen. Marty Balin and Paul Kantner took stage turns as her consort. The Airplane had a driving sexuality and a commitment to the ethic of free love that drove a true acidhead couple to the heights of ecstasy.\n\nThe Dead’s main icon at the time was not so much Jerry Garcia as that ultimate biker Ron McKernan (a.k.a. Pigpen). Pigpen had a gravelly voice, no commercial potential and was a primo stagehog. Deadheads, a bit alienated and often unable to get laid, strongly identified with Pig’s sense of danger and self-destruction. Yet it cannot be denied that the Dead made their best music in 1967-69, with the immortal discs Anthem of the Sun and Aoxamocoa (pronounced \"Wazamozoa\"). These records, along with the Dead’s best tune, Dark Star, were the Kant and Kierkegaard of LSD philosophy. Who was St. Stephen, anyway? (He was Stephen Gaskins, the head of a Memphis cult which supported itself by marketing molasses.) The Dead philosophy embodied the acceptance of mortality and timelessness: 'he knows he has to die' is the main refrain of Anthem. The Angels, the leather, the menacing Pigpen turned each Dead gig into a crystal ship moving towards the heart of darkness.\n\nDead concerts put the green-shirted staff of the Fillmore East on red alert, though these ushers were lambs compared to today’s steel-brained club bouncers. The biker fraternity hung around the Fillmore’s bathrooms looking to pick up badges of courage: a knife fight or an overdose. At the Airplane concerts, the johns were reserved for nymphettes and free love.\n\nThe dominant dude at the Fillmore East was the Brooklyn-born ex-crony of Frank Sinatra, Bill Graham, who seemed to cross the country as if by magic from his West Coast clubs, Fillmore West and Winterland, on any given weekend.\n\nGraham argued with audiences from the stage, checked crowds at the door and engaged in harangues with those protesting the high price of tickets ($4!). One-time performance pioneers Julian Beck, Judith Malina and the Living Theater attempted to turn the Fillmore East into a free theater, only to have Graham drive them out in defense of his right to make a profit. But, the Fillmore had no drug busts, there was always a doctor in the house and vibes were good. The intimate lower balcony and steep cheap seats put everyone on top of the stage. Graham even provided cute little programs, which are probably worth a fortune in flea markets.\n\nIn many ways the crowd was the show. Frank Zappa habitually sent most of his band members, like Native American drummer Jimmy Carl Black, into the aisles for the duration, dancing and choogling. Banana of the Youngbloods brought young girls on stage to tinkle his piano, and Pigpen used to leap into the first row. As most of the audience used psychedelics, contact highs were common. No fear of sex, no burnout, just free love. Instead of old winos, beautiful 14-year-old girls in beads and shawls, just in from the coast, panhandled in the lobby.\" (www.artnet.com)\n\n1968 Concerts @ The Fillmore East\n\nMARCH\n\n08 - Big Brother and the Holding Company, Tim Buckley, Albert King Lights: Joshua Light Show,\n\n22 / 23 - Doors, Ars Nova, Crome Syrcus, Joshua Light Show\n\n29 / 30 - Richie Havens, Troggs, United States Of America, Joshua Light Show\n\nAPRIL\n\n05 / 6 April 1968 - The Who, Buddy Guy, Free Spirits, Joshua Light Show\n\n12 / 13 April 1968 - Butterfield Blues Band, Charles Lloyd, Tom Rush, Joshua Light Show\n\n19 / 20 April 1968 - Mothers Of Invention, James Cotton, Joshua Light Show\n\n26 / 27 April 1968 - Traffic, Blue Cheer, Iron Butterfly, Joshua Light Show\n\nMAY\n\n03 / 04 May 1968 - Jefferson Airplane, Crazy World Of Arthur Brown Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\n10 May 1968 - Jimi Hendrix, Sly & Family Stone Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\n11 May 1968 - Autosalvage, Group Therapy, Joyfull Noise Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\n17 / 18 May 1968 - The Byrds, Tim Buckley, Foundations Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\n24 May 1968 - Ravi Shankar, Alla Rakha\n\n25 May 1968 - Country Joe & The Fish, Blue Cheer, Pigmeat Markham Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\n31 May 1968 - Moby Grape, Fugs, Gary Burton Quartet Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\nJUNE\n\n01 June 1968 - Moby Grape, Fugs, Gary Burton Quartet Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\n02 June 1968 - Bill Cosby, Janice Nian, Frankie Dunlop & Maletta Lights: Light By Pablo\n\n05 June 1968 - Incredible String Band, , WBAI-fm Benefit,\n\n07 / 08 June 1968 - Electric Flag, Quicksilver, Steppenwolf Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\n14 / 15 June 1968 - Grateful Dead, Jeff Beck, Seventh Sons Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\n21 June 1968 - Vanilla Fudge, James Cotton, Loading Zone Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\n22 June 1968 - Georgie Fame, James Cotton, Loading Zone Lights: Joshua Light Show\n\nJULY\n\n19 / 20 July 1968 - Jefferson Airplane, H.P.

In the short time they've' been together, they have had phenomenal success in both personal appearances and record sales in the U.S. Within a few weeks, their LP is in the top twenty on the national charts and is still climbing rapidly. Their first concert at the Fillmore East in NY several weeks ago brought the roof down.\n\nTheir opening number at the Fillmore was the Train Kept a Rollin, an old Yardbird's tune. (Incidentally, Jimmy played on the original version recorded by Lord Sutch about four years ago.) It really got things rolling as they proceeded to create a total sensual experience in sight and sound. Dazed and Confused resembles a musical battle as Plant's shrill cries and Page's piercing tones mimic and answer each other in perfect time. Jimmy switched to acoustical guitar for his solo, Black Mountain Side. Everyone left the stage, all the lights dimmed except for one spotlight on Jimmy seated on a chair. This was the only moment of the concert that it remained completely silent. The audience seemed mesmerized watching him. Again they broke into a hard rock number with Communication Breakdown. Their version of You Shook Me was exceptional. Plant's vocal on How Many More Times and Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You was nothing short of SUPERHUMAN. UNBELIEVABLE!!!! I Can't quit You Babe was done in a slow, grinding blues tempo with Page breaking into another solo. Drummer Bonham was then given the stage for his extraordinary solo which lasted about 15 minutes and their seats. Their last song was Season of the Witch and it set the listeners into a frenzy.\n\nIt was definitely one of the most exciting shows I've ever seen. They left NY to do a tour of the states. This is a group that has to be seen!\" (Denise Kelley, World Countdown, Feb. 1969)\n\n\"On the strength of Led Zeppelin’s debut LP on Atlantic, we dragged ourselves off a sickbed to venture down to the East Village rock showcase to see what they were like in person. It would make an interesting story indeed to be able to say that after hearing them perform, we were dancing in the aisles and subsequently ran all the way home. Suffice to say that the thought entered our mind, and though the spirit was willing, the flesh was weak.\n\nIn other words, through the Zeppelin album is very, very good, the group in person is even better and the excitement they generate hasn’t been felt in the Fillmore since the last appearance of Big Brother & the Holding Company.\n\nVocalist Robert Plant falls into the Terry Reid class (a nice class indeed), but the group’s musical talents are in a class by themselves and the combination of the two can only indicate super-stardom. A subtle hint of the group’s quickly growing status can be found in the fact that while their album had only been out a week and a half, fully half the audience was familiar with it. Need we say more?\" (Cashbox / Feb. 1969)\n\nJanuary: Terry Reid opening for B.B. King\n\nFebruary 12, 1969\n\nJanuary 24th & 25th\n\nBlood Sweat & Tears\n\nJethro Tull\n\nSavoy Brown Blues Band\n\nOn February 1st 1969,\n\nLed Zeppelin debuted at the Fillmore East,\n\nopening for Iron Butterfly\n\n\"An opening set for Iron Butterfly and a very intense and show stealing one at that! Zeppelin was infinitely better than the Butterfly as this set amply shows. Robert's voice in all of its high pitched, amazing 1969 glory and the band playing as well as ever thus far in their short time together. Jimmy is on fire!\n\nAs expected, Led Zeppelin destroyed the audience at the Fillmore East last weekend. Second show Friday night they remained onstage for 90 minutes of absolutely incredible musicianship up and down the entire blues scene.\n\nThe group's success here - their first album swung into both charts this week with sales figures well over 100,000 - was marred only by the fact that John Bonham, 21-year-old drummer had to return to England suddenly after his small child (Jason) had an accident that required stitches in his head. But he flew back in time for the Zeppelin's concert's in Chicago at the weekend.\" (J. Harris, NME, Feb. 1969)\n\nFeb. 15th 1969\n\nChuck Berry\n\nWinter. Savoy Brown, Aorta\n\nJoshua White\n\nJoshua Light Show\n\n\"Writing for the New York Times in a 1969 article titled 'You Don’t Have to Be High,' Barbara Bell reported on her sojourn to Bill Graham’s Fillmore East rock club on freaky Second Avenue, where she saw the Joshua Light Show produce 'Mondrianesque checkerboards, strawberry fields, orchards of lime, antique jewels, galaxies of light over a pure black void and, often, abstract, erotic, totally absorbing shapes and colors for the joy of it—each a vision of an instant, wrapped in and around great waves of sound . . . first-nighters stagger out dazzled, muttering to themselves about amoebas in colored water.'\n\nSuch associative attempts at articulating the character of psychedelic light shows were not uncommon. Visual music historian William Moritz wrote that, in its finest instantiations, light shows constituted 'a living art work of organic complexity considerably more interesting, challenging and satisfying than any of the flat, static art styles of the past, including painting and the traditional fictional cinema.' Curator Christoph Grunenberg has written that of the scores of light shows that arose in the mid-to-late 1960s, the Joshua Light Show was 'the most complex and sophisticated.'\n\nThe original members of the Joshua Light Show were resident artists at the Fillmore. From March 8, 1968, until the venue closed in on June 27,1971, the group performed multiple shows every weekend for up to a total of ten thousand people, receiving nearly equal billing to such acts as the Who, the Doors, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Albert King, Chuck Berry, and Iron Butterfly. Joshua White, who had studied electrical engineering, theatrical lighting, and magic-lantern techniques at Carnegie Tech and filmmaking at the University of Southern California, where he made a number of stop-motion and direct animation shorts, founded the group. The JLS consisted of six to eight members during its initial run, with the most stable lineup including White, Tom Shoesmith, and Bill Schwarzbach, who met at Columbia University while studying theatrical lighting and electrical engineering; Cecily Hoyt, a photographer and painter; and Jane Ableman, an art student.\n\nThe group employed a panoply of image-making apparatus to achieve diverse visual effects: three film projectors, two banks of four-carousel slide projectors, three overhead projectors, hundreds of color wheels, motorized reflectors made of such materials as aluminum foil, Mylar, and broken mirrors, two hair dryers, watercolors, oil colors, alcohol and glycerin, two crystal ashtrays, and dozens of clear glass clock crystals. White and his cohort designed a rear-projection system, situated roughly twenty feet behind the Fillmore stage, where several tons of equipment was arrayed on two elevated platforms.\n\nThe conventional seated theater setup of the Fillmore, however, meant the group focused their efforts on a single screen rather than attempt to establish a West Coast or discotheque-style overall light environment. Using eight 1,200-watt airplane landing-strip lights to project imagery onto a twenty-by-thirty-foot vinyl screen, JLS built their shows from four elements. The first involved the projection of pure colored light through various handmade and modified devices. The second element was concrete imagery, which included film footage shot by the group, hand-etched film loops, segments from commercial cinema, and, eventually, closed-circuit video, which was used to project enlarged images of the musicians performing onstage in real time. The group’s collection of concrete imagery also included hand-painted slides, slides containing geometric patterns, historical art slides featuring paintings by Goya and Manet, and slides consisting of text such as the line attributed to both Warhol and McCluhan, 'Art is anything you can get away with.'\" (www.joshualightshow.com)\n\n\"The Joshua Light Show was now an integral part of the Fillmore East experience. As well as providing an exciting visual accompaniment to the bands, it also started screening cartoons between the sets of music. A particular favorite was a trippy 1935 cartoon called The Sunshine Makers, featuring elves who bottled beams of sunlight. In the cartoon, the bottles would be given out to people who then drank from them, which caused each imbiber to start singing and dancing.\" (John Glatt, Live at the Fillmore East and West, Lyons Press)\n\nThe Sunshine Makers\n\nMarch 28th & 29th 1969\n\n-Steppenwolf, Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger And The Trinity, John Hammond\n\nMay 2nd & 3rd\n\nJeff Beck, Joe Cocker & The Grease Band, NRBQ\n\nMay 11 1969\n\nThe Band\n\nThe Band finally made their East Coat debut at the Fillmore East in May. Performing an hour long set, The Band played most of the songs from their debut album Music From Big Pink and introduced those songs as mountain music. The crowd was so excited by The Band's performance that they demanded three encores.\n\n\"We played four sold-out shows at the Fillmore East on Second Avenue in Manhattan. Cat Mother and the All-Night Newsboys opened, and the audience was with us from the minute we stepped onto the stage in what we described in the press as 'suits and ties'. These were actually dark western-cut clothes, string ties, and black boots, plus assorted hats from Richard's collection. We tuned in the dark for a moment - the light show had been given the night off - the lights came on, and the New York audience began to scream. Standing ovation. Looming over the Lowry organ, Garth looked like a biblical prophet in his untrimmed black beard. We were very tightly rehearsed, because we wanted the performance to sound like the records. We stayed close to those arrangements and didn't stretch it out. We did music from Big Pink - Tears of Rage, This Wheel's on Fire, Caledonia Mission, - and we couldn't believe the wild response. We mixed these up with Get Up Jake, (from the California sessions), the Four Tops' Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever, (Richard sang great on a nod to our Motown fandom), Little Birds. 'Levon's Dad taught us this one,\" Robbie announced. 'We hope you like country music here in New York.'

'On the opening night I was more excited than usual,' recalled Townshend, 'and we were bullish that we’d have a good show.' To get in the mood, each band member had a bottle of brandy backstage, as well as another on Keith Moon’s drumhead for refreshments during the performance.\n\nToward the end of their first show, somebody hurled a Molotov cocktail into the Lion Supermarket that shared a wall with the Fillmore East. As firefighters arrived to put out the three-alarm blaze, fire chiefs reassured Bill Graham there was no imminent danger to his audience. So he decided to wait until the end of Tommy before evacuating the theater. Fillmore East usher Allan Arkush smelled smoke and then looked outside to see flashing lights and firemen all over Second Avenue. The focus in the theater was on The Who and the energy of their performance was lifting everyone.' Suddenly a plain-clothed tactical force detective appeared from the wings at the right of the stage and tried to grab the microphone out of Roger Daltrey’s hands, yelling, 'Give me the mike!' Without missing a beat, Townshend lined up a kick to the detective’s testicles with his Doc Martens. 'He came from nowhere,' said Arkush, 'and Townshend kicked him in the balls. Somebody from the stage crew grabbed him and dragged him off and the entire audience jumped to its feet. It was positively a Roman spectacle.' As more police raced toward the stage, The Who carried on playing as if nothing was happening. The audience thought the thickening smoke inside the theater was all part of the show.\n\nPete Townshend getting booked for assaulting NYC detective\n\nduring a Fillmore East show\n\nAfter they finished Tommy with that fantastic note the audience went crazy. Then The Who just counted off and lit into ‘Summertime Blues.’ Finally, Bill Graham managed to get Townshend’s attention and went onstage to tell him about the fire next door. 'And I could see them whispering,' said Arkush, 'and The Who kind of brought it way down. It was like a rocket ship turning off its boosters and the audience is standing there panting.' Then Graham went to the microphone and was so cool. He said, We have a little problem. He announced that the ushers were going to clear the theater until it was safe to return, and then The Who would finish the set. 'That building was empty within three minutes,' said Arkush. 'And of course there was no late show, as the smoke was really too thick in the theater.' Later that night, Townshend was charged with assaulting a police officer, and a warrant was sworn out for his arrest. The next morning he turned himself in, spending a few hours in the tank until Bill Graham bailed him out. On Saturday and Sunday nights, The Who were back at the Fillmore East, playing four more sensational shows.\n\nA couple of weeks later, a New York City court fined Townshend $75 for a misdemeanor. On June 17, The Who played the first of three nights at the Fillmore West. This time Pete Townshend told Bill Graham they would play only one show a night instead of two. 'But he was intractable,' said Townshend. 'We made our first set very short as a challenge to his so-called authority, so he had a disgruntled audience on his side, too.' Finally, Graham backed down, and The Who never played more than one show a night for him again.\" (John Glatt, Live at the Fillmore East and West , Lyons Press)\n\nMay 30th & 31st 1969\n\nLed Zeppelin, Woody Herman & His Orchestra, Delaney & Bonnie\n\nSeptember 29 - Horror Rock Fest\n\n\"Horror Rock\" fest with Elephant's Memory, Prodigal Son, Brother Theodore, and a screening of Frankenstein, all MC'd by Zacherle!\n\nNovember 7 & 8\n\nSantana\n\nHumble Pie\n\nPaul Butterfield Blues Band\n\nNovember 21st & 22nd\n\nJoe Cocker & His Grease Band,\n\nFleetwood Mac, King Crimson, Voices Of East Harlem\n\nDecember 1969 Allman Bros first show @ The Fillmore East\n\nDecember 29 - The Nice\n\n\"Fillmore East, New York Two Shows Prior to their two concerts later that evening, Jimi Hendrix and his Band Of Gypsys held an afternoon sound check and rehearsal at the Fillmore East. Later that evening, before a sold out crowd of 2,639, Hendrix rang in the New Year and new decade with two unforgettable performances. The evening’s festivities opened with a spirited set by the Voices Of East Harlem, an enthusiastic young gospel ensemble. With the anticipation of the sold out Fillmore audience heightened to fever pitch, Hendrix led his trio through a scintillating, seventy-five minute opening performance. None of the eleven songs presented had yet to grace an Experience album. In the place of signature songs like Purple Haze and All Along The Watchtower were confident renditions of Izabella and Hear My Train A Comin’. At midnight, Kip Cohen, the venue’s master of ceremonies, rang in the new year and decade buffeted by Guy Lombardo’s Auld Lang Syne. Never one to be upstaged, Jimi and company greeted the joyous house with their own inspired reading of the holiday staple. For Amalie Rothschild, the Fillmore East’s house photographer, the experience was an unforgettable one. 'Then there was the countdown at midnight. It was the countdown that was a real scream. We’re talking about the end of the Sixties. December 31, 1969 turning into January 1, 1970–.A new decade. This was significant. After all, we were living through it and we knew that the Sixties were the Sixties. We had this big countdown on the Joshua White light show screen with this big clock 10, 9, 8, 7, 6…and everybody is yelling together. Then the light show screen pulls up and everybody is on stage–all the crew and the musicians. Hendrix, who is now on stage, launches into this amazing rendition of Auld Lang Syne and I filmed it. This was history in the making. You could not miss this. His performance was just so inspired. It was just terrific and I can’t find the words to describe it.'

When they finally booked a run of shows at the Fillmore East that summer, demand for tickets was off the charts. Fans lined the block four deep the night beforehand just to get their hands on one. Though they may have rubbed the Fillmore East crew the wrong way with their demands to block the Joshua Light Show and bring in their own sound equipment, the results onstage spoke for themselves. The sets were broken down into two portions, electric and acoustic, and each man was allowed their own time in the limelight to show what they could do. After the final performance on the final night, the audience simply refused to leave, so Graham himself went to the band and begged them to do an encore. Crosby demanded cash before they would agree to go on again, so the promoter started slipping $100 bills under the door.

The ad warned that managers, agents, and rock bands were pricing themselves out of the theater concert business. 'Economics have taken the music from the clubs,” stated Graham, “from the clubs, ballrooms and concert halls to the larger coliseums and festivals.' And he warned that his twin temples of rock were in imminent danger, as there were not enough major acts to replace the ones now playing the bigger venues like Madison Square Garden. 'Once one got to the Seventies,' said Kip Cohen (manager of Fillmore East), 'there was a big shift and things got harder and uglier. There was a change. A change in the music. A change in the audience. A change in the attitude.' Cohen said that the Fillmore venues could no longer compete with the bigger venues that paid the artists far more money and satisfied their increasingly inflated egos. 'We had something to sell for three years,' he said, 'and then it was not something that we could sell anymore. Could we sell it to the audience? Yes. But not to the artist.'\" (John Glatt, Live at the Fillmore East and West, Lyons Press)\n\nSEPTEMBER\n\nSeptember 27th Pink Floyd\n\nAlbert King\n\nVan Morrison\n\nThe Byrds\n\nNOVEMBER\n\nNovember 18th / 19th Traffic\n\nNovember 20th & 21st\n\nLeon Russell, Elton John, Mckendree Spring\n\n\"Elton John performed four shows on Nov. 20-21, 1970 at New York's Fillmore East, and something magical happened.

But as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. The Fillmore East would be shuttered by the end of the summer, but not before one last run of Dead shows. The five-night run would serve as the band’s last hurrah at Bill Graham’s legendary East Village venue...\n\nThe band wastes no time and dives right into a roaring Truckin' to open the show. It’s a crisp, early version of this Dead classic to-be that was barely a year old at the time. It would also serve as the opener for three other shows during this Fillmore run. After requesting some cranking up of the monitors, Jerry Garcia then leads the group through Loser, carrying over the alt-country psychedelic vibes established earlier by the New Riders. A short, but hauntingly beautiful guitar solo from Garcia highlights this one. The collective mood then gets lifted in a major way with Hard To Handle. The charismatic Pigpen, who has several shining moments during this show, takes the lead on vocals in his signature, blues-riddled style. Garcia and drummer Bill Kreutzmann seem to take turn raising the fervor and intensity which yields a hearty early jam...\n\n...the show resumes with Me And Bobby McGee, this time with Bob Weir leading the way on vocals. Afterwards Weir shouts out some more friendly advice to the monitor guy before Cold Rain And Snow lifts off. Garcia's agressive guitar tone and the thunderous bass notes from Phil Lesh give this always emotional number a little something extra. This sets the stage for Pigpen to take charge once more, this time with harmonica in tow for The Rub. This Lightnin' Hopkins song, also known as Ain't It Crazy, would only be played 13 times by the Dead, properly shelved for good after Pigpen's passing.\n\nWeir then gets back on the mic for Playin’ In The Band, another soon-to-be Dead classic. It’s essentially just a run through of the composed portion, with no jam to speak of with the song still in its nascent stage. Garcia then notes that 'we used to do this song acoustically' before an uptempo rendition of Friend Of The Devil takes place.\n\nThe first set then wraps up with a few already established staples of the Grateful Dead’s live catalog. The instrumental segue between China Cat Sunflower and I Know You Rider is near-seamless, with Garcia delivering a flurry of emotional guitar fills on the latter. Casey Jones then drives the Fillmore crowd off to intermission, capping off a whirlwind first set. Garcia and Weir both take it upon themselves to advise everyone they’ll return shortly.\n\nThe Dead kick off the second set at the Fillmore in grand fashion with a supercharged Morning Dew. Steadily progressive rhythms supplied by Lesh and Kreutzmann secure the framework for another Garcia guitar solo that drips with emotion, much to the crowd’s delight. After a quick run through Beat It On Down The Line, it’s Pigpen’s turn again as he and his harp rip through a cover of the bluesy Next Time You See Me.\n\nPig then gets back behind the organ for Bertha, another fresh tune at the time, debuted only months ago. This clears the deck for Sugar Magnolia. Garcia has the wah effect on full blast for this one, almost overpowering everything else. After some more griping about the in-house monitors, the Dead’s cover of Smokey Robinson and The Miracles’ Second That Emotion smooths everything over. It would the fourth performance of this song that the band only ever played five times – all in April of 1971.\n\nBut this would not be the cover selection that blows the doors off the second set. That honor belongs to the Good Lovin' that follows, sung in Pigpen’s signature style and immediately supplemented with a majestic drum solo from Kreutzmann. As the wave of Drums begins to recede, a loose form of Good Lovin' reemerges, spurred on by Pigpen and his improvisational crooning. With the rest of the band fully locked in behind him, this sequence sees the Dead at their full powers and steals the show.\" (nysmusic.com)\n\nApril 27 The Grateful Dead & The Beach Boys Jam\n\n\"In 1971 at the Fillmore East in New York, the Grateful Dead welcomed pop-rock behemoths The Beach Boys to the stage for a special jam session. It was an everyday occurrence for fans of The Grateful Dead, picking up special guests with the ease of wind picking up grains of sand, the band were experts in welcoming stars to their stage. Even by 1971, with the band still in their comparative infancy, the Dead were more than happy to welcome some huge names to share the stage with them, including The Beach Boys.\n\nThough the crowd would let out a half-moan following Jerry Garcia’s announcement that 'We got another famous California group, it’s the Beach Boys,' they would soon be shown why exactly Garcia was so pleased to introduce the hugely influential band. Deadheads are loyal to their group, and the rumbles of discontent were certainly short lived as the other giants of the West Coast made their way across the country to bolster the arsenal of their Californian pals.\n\nThe Beach Boys were not as revered for their innovative style back in 1971 as they are today. Back then they were kind of square and represented, at the very least, an estuary of the mainstream, which to Deadheads at the time, was unthinkable. They had topped charts and broken records, they had written a heavy catalogue of pop tunes, and despite the seminal album Pet Sounds, the group were not considered in the realms of cool. But The Grateful Dead knew better.\n\nThe Beach Boys may not have been the subversive cultural phenomenon that the Dead had become through their live shows, but the Cali band still had heaps of value to their work, and they were determined to show it. Without Brian Wilson, the group took to the stage alongside the Dead and by the end of the show had the whole audience on their side. It’s a testament to the kind of players Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston are that they could keep up at all.\n\nThe stage was set at New York’s iconic Fillmore East and had seen the Dead already perform two shows of their scheduled five-night run. The previous evening on April 26th the band had been joined by Duane Allman, whose own band, The Allman Brothers, had opened for the Dead the year earlier at the venue. But for the 17th they had something really special planned.\n\nThe band were well into their set before they invited the California band out. They had already treated the audience to fan-favorites such as ‘Bertha’, ‘Hard To Handle’, and ‘Sugar Magnolia’, which meant the audience was duly sated. The group had just wound down the countrified ‘Dire Wolf’ when Garcia made the announcement.\n\nWith the band now swelled to a chunky 10 piece arrangement, (the Dead line-up at the time was Garcia, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Ron McKernan and Bill Kreutzmann) there was a lot of people to organize on stage. Rather than try to play one another’s songs they decided the best thing to do would be to rely on the oldies. The two bands ripped through the Coasters’ ‘Searchin' as well as the Robins’ ‘Riot in Cell Block #9’, following which the Dead left the stage and let The Beach Boys takeover awhile, keeping the fans happy as they did.\n\nIf you ignore Mike Love’s desperate attempts to be “hip” by retelling a story about getting stoned with Buffalo Springfield the performance is pretty tight. Of course, without Brian Wilson, The Beach Boys were never quite at full tilt, yet their renditions of ‘Help Me, Rhonda,’ ‘I Get Around’ and ‘Good Vibrations’ were all welcomed with open arms.\n\nBy the end of ‘Help Me, Rhonda’ the Dead had begun to re-enter the stage for two more songs with the Cali band. As well as taking on a cover of Merle Haggard’s ‘Okie from Muskogee’ they finished the night with a rendition of Chuck Berry’s ‘Johnny B. Goode’. And this crazy night with The Grateful Dead was later brought to a close.\" (Far Out magazine)\n\nMay 30th Laura Nyro, Spencer Davis & Peter Jameson\n\nJune 11th & 12th Blood Rock, Alice Cooper, Glass Harp\n\nBy the summer of 1971, Bill Graham was officially fed up with the asking prices for the acts he did book were borderline cost-prohibitive. Eventually, Graham decided to close the Fillmore East.\n\nSince Graham wanted the Fillmore East to go out in style, he booked The Allman Brothers to play for the Fillmore East's audience one final time. On June 27th, this memorable show lasted into the early morning hours.\n\nDickie Betts: “'That was a special show, We played until daylight that morning. I remember it was dark in there, and when they opened the door, the sun about knocked us down. We didn’t realize we had played until seven, eight o’clock in the morning. Bill Graham just let us rattle and nobody said, ‘We gotta cut the time.’ It was just a really free kind of thing.\"\n\n“'We played for roughly seven straight hours with everything we had,' drummer Butch Trucks remembered. 'The feeling was just so overwhelming that I just started crying. Then we got into a jam, I think it was ‘Mountain Jam,’ that lasted for four straight hours. Nonstop. And when we finished, there was no applause whatsoever. The place was deathly quiet. Someone got up and opened the doors and the bright morning sun came pouring in.” (John Glatt, Live at the Fillmore East and West, Lyons Press)\n\n\"The last night at the Fillmore East. It’s been called The Holy Grail of Allman Brothers Band shows. The night the fan who shouted, 'Play all night!' on the live Fillmore East album got his wish. Dickey has been quoted as calling it the best show they ever played. The fact that there are no known recordings of this show only adds to the mystique. If you were there, you heard it. If you weren’t, you can only listen to shows from that era and imagine one that went on for hours, ending with a stupendous jam. Kirk West says, 'they had the recording equipment there but no one turned it on.' Can you imagine? The closing concert at the Fillmore East and no one recorded it?! Perhaps, locked away in some secret vault in the Bill Graham organization, lies a tape, waiting for the right moment to surface. Or perhaps it’s in some fan’s attic, long forgotten, oxide slowly turning to dust with the memories.\n\nGoing to a concert was so much more than just going to hear a band. It was a group social event. Five or six friends jammed into a car, passing food and refreshments around, playing tapes, singing along, journeying to Deepest Darkest New York City!\n\nAfter seeing a couple of shows, the Allmans became my favorite band. I loved their albums but nothing matched seeing them live. To me there was music, and then there was the Allman Brothers Band. No other band’s music reached out and grabbed my heart and soul the way the Allmans’ did. I felt like they touched my emotions, the very center of my being, directly and personally. When Duane played a solo, I knew exactly what he was feeling.\n\nI enjoyed other concerts, but they were just artists belting out their hits, impressing us with their musical talent, getting us on our feet, dancing and yelling. But none of them made me close my eyes tight and feel the emotions jamming in my brain, down my spine, clenching the muscles in my legs, right into the soles of my feet. No other musicians made me feel so connected to their souls as they played. It was like the difference between acting and living. Other bands seemed to be aware of the fact that they were on a stage and making music. The Allmans seemed to be living and feeling the things they were playing right there in front of us.\n\nWe went to a lot of shows, indoors and out, but our favorite spot by far was Bill Graham’s Fillmore East. The Fillmore was a concert hall in the old tradition, seating only a few thousand people. There was a balcony and three sections of theater-style seats. The Fillmore staff allowed us to bring in our own munchies, and we always had a mix of healthy food and junk food: brownies, apples, carrots, cookies, you name it.\n\nThe ushers at the Fillmore kept busy running around the theater shining flashlights on people flaunting the 'no smoking' laws, but there was always plenty of olfactory evidence that the cigarette lighters were winning the battle with the ushers. The Fillmore had wonderful acoustics, something sadly missing from most concert experiences these days. Who decided that rock music sounds fine in amphitheater sheds, football stadiums, and gymnasiums, anyway? It’s great that the Brothers still play real theaters like the Beacon and the Warfield even though they could make more money filling a 20,000 seat amphitheater.\n\nThe Fillmore East was nestled in New York’s East Village, where the real hippies moved when Greenwich Village went commercial. You couldn’t walk a block in the East Village without getting hustled for dope or spare change. It was downright seedy, even by New York’s standards. But traveling in a group of five or six, we were probably relatively safe. And on concert nights, the streets were full of other kids streaming in from the suburbs, all trying to look like they lived in the East Village.\n\nThe NY music scene was hot; we were proud of it, and we took it for granted. And so we couldn’t have been more surprised that day in early spring ’71 when we heard the news: 'You won’t believe this: Bill Graham’s closing the Fillmore!' Impossible! Bill Graham and the Fillmore were synonymous with rock concerts at their finest. Why on earth would he quit? The news reports over the next couple of weeks told the story of a burned out, jaded Bill Graham who was weary of the hassles of rock concert promotion. The bands were demanding more money, which he felt would price them out of the market (imagine what he would say about some of last summer’s ticket prices!). He said the crowds were getting unruly and were less knowledgeable and selective about the music. He thought they were just “yelling for more” no matter how the music sounded.\n\nSlowly it sunk in that this was for real, and that there would soon be a 'last night at the Fillmore.' We got the news of the final stand: there would be four public concerts, a late and early show each night, on Friday and Saturday, June 25 and 26th; and then an invited guests only private concert on June 27th that would be broadcast over the radio. The bands for the public shows would be: Albert King, the J. Geils Band, and headlining, the Allman Brothers Band. Talk about mixed emotions . . . the joy of seeing the Bro"
