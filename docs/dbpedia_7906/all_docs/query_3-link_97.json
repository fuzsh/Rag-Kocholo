        "text": "The song, which sold more than three million copies, tells the story of Blunt seeing an ex-girlfriend on the subway with another man.\n\nThe musician, 40, added his music had been marketed to women, and had therefore lost out on male fans.\n\n\"The marketing also painted me out as an insanely serious person, an earnest person and, as all my friends know, I'm anything but,\" Blunt said.\n\n\"I have a couple of over-emotional miserable songs that I'm known for, but I think it's turned that corner now.\"\n\nThe album that contained the song, \"Back to Bedlam\", was the most-sold in the United Kingdom in the 2000s and went platinum all over the world."
