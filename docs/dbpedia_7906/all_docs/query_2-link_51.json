        "text": "Talkin’ ’bout the Claudettes…\n\nPRESS FOR THE CLAUDETTES GO OUT! (2022)\n\nGRANT BRITT, NO DEPRESSION Sleek, sensuous vocals….Ulseth’s sultry stylings have brought the band closer to mainstream consciousness….With Iguana’s piano sounding like a venerable, beer-soaked saloon denizen, “Dozing in the Crypt” choogles along smartly enough to get listeners up and prancing until Iguana unearths a bucketload of head-spinning Phantom of the Opera-ish riffs….’Exposure’ is a mind-bending approximation of the B-52’s covering Devo on a spaghetti western odyssey…Iguana’s impressive songwriting skills are on display throughout the album….Ulseth comes across like Marianne Faithfull warbling on a lost track from a late-’60s Stones release…Even approaching a more mainstream soundscape, it’s still the quirkiest sound around.\n\nSTEPHEN THOMAS ERLEWINE, ALLMUSIC Rich, layered…the execution is sophisticated, suggesting a band bashing out 1960s pop after hours at a dive bar, sometimes so thoroughly connecting with the lateness of the hour that they drift into dream-pop. Even if there are some shimmering, ethereal touches, the hard-swinging piano of chief songwriter Johnny Iguana and the sweet, steely purity of vocalist Berit Ulseth give the Claudettes an earthy, human hook. (FOUR STARS)\n\nJIM HYNES, MAKING A SCENE Their 2020 album ‘High Times in the Dark’ was described by this writer in another outlet as their best yet. While that was a coming-out party for trained jazz vocalist turned pop singer Berit Ulseth, this one smooths out any remaining rough edges and may be even a little better….Besides Ulseth, the quartet is still very much centered on Johnny Iguana’s punk-blues garage-rock piano….’A Lovely View’ (is) a wistful but haunting, hazy and dreamy track….Ulseth brings her enchanting best….Verdoorn’s heavy guitar licks pack a punch here but it’s clearly Ulseth’s time to shine….With each album, the Claudettes sound becomes more refined. Ulseth’s vocals blew us away last time. Here we have to give the edge to the songwriting which stands apart from any band out there. In fact, we can apply that last clause to the band itself. Nobody else brings this infectious stew of jazz, punk, and piano driven power pop.\n\nJ. POET, ROCK & ROLL GLOBE Iguana’s songwriting blends all these elements into a sound that brings to mind the pop standards of the ’40s and ’50s. It’s music for sophisticated listeners.…’Exposure’ is a kinetic mover, with Verdoorn laying down driving, punky surf guitar hooks….’The Claudettes Go Out!’ shows the band’s mastery of every era of American music, from the roots of the blues, to today’s modern pop….the Claudettes pen standards for a new generation.\n\nROBERT RODI, NEW CITY (CHICAGO) Chicago’s much loved, genre-devouring party band serves notice that they’re once again ready to engage head-on with the world….Ulseth’s voice is tinged with a gorgeous ache….Iguana provides the sparest, most crystalline playing we’ve ever heard from him…manages to draw you in like a tractor beam….topflight performances….Ulseth in particular keeps her singing cool and minimalist, so that she’s able to achieve dramatic effects with the most subtle of inflections….beautifully evocative.\n\nJOSEPH NEFF, THE VINYL DISTRICT With an expansion of lineup comes refinement, as their latest is full-bodied smart pop enhanced with a subtle roots edge and early Alternative rock punch. And yet, much of the record has a contemporary feel…expertly blending pop sophistication and earthy soulfulness…deftly constructed pop elevated through inspired ensemble execution. (Grade: A-)\n\nJOHN APICE, AMERICANA HIGHWAYS This album gets off to a sparkling start with ‘A Lovely View’….Their tight approach to varied musical genres is adorned with no gimmicks, nothing superficial and everything suited to inspiring melodies and spirited lyrics….The band rocks on ‘Dozing In the Crypt’ with its rousing thunderclouds of music….These excellently arranged, performed & produced songs make up the 10-cut ‘The Claudettes Go Out!’….My first impression was this was a dance record, a ’60s-inspired girl-group endeavor–but it’s not. It’s way better than that.\n\nBILL KOPP, MUSOSCRIBE Fronted by the gentle and deeply expressive vocals of Berit Ulseth, the group makes music that doesn’t fit easily into any musical category….It’s a work of grandeur and beauty…a wonderful kind of cross between Petula Clark and Joe Jackson…hints of the classic Brill Building style…combines goth and cabaret styles, with a stomping backbeat and slashing guitar…Ulseth delivers her vocals with a perfect balance of enthusiasm and exquisite ennui…it’s executed with style and conviction….All ten tracks on ‘The Claudettes Go Out!’ are winners.\n\nEMILY DUFF, ROCKING MAGPIE (UK) Your new favorite band have made a stellar, timeless record….An earful of delight…cleverly crafted songs, skillful and soulful musicians, a pear-shaped voice that is sent straight from the angels…I am here to tell you that you can…and you should believe the hype…angelic, breathy vocals…tracks so diverse in genre that they recall Everything But The Girl, The Jam, Leon Russell and DEVO all at once…’Time Won’t Take Our Times Away’ is the song I can’t stop listening to. Recalling an early Elton John/Bernie Taupin vibe with lyrics that compel the listener to tune out the world and finely tune in the song (what music is supposed to do), I keep going back for more, discovering another layer to investigate and love with each and every listen….Wrecking Crew good vibrations…’The Show Must Go On (And Then The Show Must End)’ channels a lost track from The Who’s ‘Tommy’ and that’s no understatement…the album draws to a satisfying close, and you realize that you have a new favorite band who have made a stellar, timeless record that you will enjoy for the rest of your life.\n\nJEFF BURGER, BLOGCRITICS (Their) strongest album to date….What will grab you first are the jazz-influenced, silky vocals of Berit Ulseth, who sounds a bit redolent of the Sundays’ Harriet Wheeler. But the Claudettes’ music is more adventurous and rewarding than anything the Sundays ever issued. Drawing on everything from punk and blues to pop and country, ‘The Claudettes Go Out!’ delivers a richly textured, surprise-filled journey you’ll want to take again and again.\n\nLORING WIRBEL, COLORADO SPRINGS INDEPENDENT Fabulous…keyboardist/composer Johnny Iguana crafted a set of tracks to show off vocalist Berit Ulseth’s torch-song talents…but Ulseth offers more than slow-burn love songs on this album…stunning.\n\nDANNY McCLOSKEY, THE ALTERNATE ROOT Ulseth polishes and carves out the songs with chameleon emotions…with a calm vocal as melodies swirl and lush orchestration keeps the delivery warm….Piano wizard Johnny Iguana concocts a heady brew of scenarios that welcome characters created by the listener as much as the author…bright melodies…cautionary tales…sultry and cinematic.\n\nGARY GRAFF, OAKLAND PRESS (MI) Those who tap in will find something that’s delightfully varied and wholly accessible, never staying in the same lane for too long but always reaching an exciting destination.\n\nHOT WAX ALBUM REVIEWS (BY THE ROCK DOCTOR) Smart pop music with attitude and feeling, a punkishness at times that is totally refreshing and fun…It does not disappoint….No show-offy soloing here…with the Claudettes, it’s all about the songs….Tie that to some jaunty and occasionally unexpected melodies, and you’ve got something special…and pretty dang cool.\n\nCLEVESCENE It would be unbelievably inaccurate to confine Chicago band, the Claudettes, to a solitary genre. The band fuses jazz, blues, vaudeville, soul, and classical. Though their diverse yet structured style is fresh, their live shows are a throwback to early 20th century performances from a 1930s big band club to a 1920s speakeasy.\n\nBILL FORMAN, THE GAZETTE, CEDAR RAPIDS, IA Ever-changing moods….chameleon colors…A band whose music reinvents itself from song to song, or even within songs, in ways that defy categorization…’The Waves,’ one of the standout tracks on the forthcoming ‘The Claudettes Go Out!’ album, sounds more like Philip Glass producing Mazzy Star……incurable eclecticism.\n\nMICHAEL DOHERTY’S MUSIC LOG One thing that is particularly remarkable about this band is the songwriting. Their songs aren’t quite like those of any other band…..There is something dreamlike in Berit Ulseth’s vocal delivery….sweet and endearing…earnest, and gorgeous…fantastic…delightful…it is all over much too soon.\n\nAMERICAN BLUES SCENE Chicago’s finest indie-blues combo….Replete with strong hooks, the new album is a showcase for their brand of piano-propelled, cabaret blues at its best\n\nUNDER THE RADAR A distinctive style…of bluesy piano lines, soul-tinged harmonies and outsider punk noir undercurrent….’A Lovely View’ is a gorgeously understated effort…winding melodies…yearning vocals…mixes the band’s vintage soulful bent with a dramatic ear for melody.\n\nSCENE POINT BLANK The Claudettes have found their unique sound. I have never heard something like them. Their sound is still capable of transporting me to somewhere else, and that is something I enjoy highly….Although the piano is still the center, the driving force of the band…what hasn’t changed is the, to me, biggest selling point of the band: Berit Ulseth. She again steals the show. It doesn’t matter if she sings a smooth, soft song or the more bluesy or rocky songs, she can do it all. When she starts singing, she demands your full attention. Her performance her is captivating. Again. (5 stars; 8.7 out of 10)\n\nTHE GINGER QUIFF (Music blogger Neil Hodge, ex-Louder Than War music writer) The Claudettes have once again hit the mother lode with a selection of new songs packed with the extraordinary musicianship I’ve come to expect from Johnny Iguana and co. The ten songs on “Go Out!” pack a hefty emotional punch, too, by virtue of the elegantly alluring and impassioned vocal delivery from Berit….Another triumphant release from the magnificent Claudettes.\n\nALT COUNTRY FORUM (The Netherlands) The Claudettes have a knack for refining their signature recipe without compromising the whimsy, diversity and adventurous nature…glorious musicality…the strongest, richly structured and most balanced album of the band.\n\nDAGGER ZINE Swingin’ R&B…Berit Ulseth has a gorgeous set of pipes…rollicking piano work…the steady rhythm section of Michael Caskey on drums and bassist Zach Verdoorn keep all the sections intact most righteously…come to the party, come one and all!\n\nISTHMUS (Madison, WI) Anchored by Johnny Iguana’s masterful, blissfully chaotic piano, the Claudettes mix blues and pop into their own blend. Following up on acclaimed albums “Dance Scandal at the Gymnasium!” (2018) and “High Times in the Dark” (2020), the new studio album, “The Claudettes Go Out!,” delivers another set of foot-stomping rock and blues excitement, but the best way to experience the band is live and in-person.\n\nHABLO ENNUI (music blog of ex-Fufkin.com writer/CHIRP radio DJ Mike Bennett) This Chicago band has evolved, and currently creates wonderful soft pop songs with lovely melodies. These are songs that would slot well between Dionne Warwick, the softer side of The Zombies, and Judee Sill. Beret Ulsith is the perfect singer for these sophisticated slices of tuneage, and the rest of the band perfectly colors in the sounds, especially the great Johnny Iguana on piano and other keyboards. (Picked as a Top Album of 2022)\n\nDAILY HERALD (Suburban Chicago) Part rock, part blues, the Claudettes are a sum of many influences. Their recently released “The Claudettes Go Out!” is an exhilarating showcase for their style, challenging musical compositions driven forward by Ulseth’s sultry vocals.\n\nLORING WIRBEL (Longtime CO Springs Independent writer) Johnny Iguana crafted this as a slower and somewhat torch-style delivery for the vocal talents of Berit Ulseth. Best opening song on an album this year. (Picked as one of the best albums of 2022)\n\nALLMUSIC One of the Favorite Blues Albums of 2022\n\nILLINOIS ENTERTAINER One of the Top 10 Albums of 2022 (list by Jeff Elbel)\n\nTWANGVILLE Reader’s Pick: Favorite New Release of the Week\n\nJEDD BEAUDOIN/STRANGE CURRENCY (KMUW, Wichita NPR station) #8 on list of 25 best albums of 20222\n\nPRESS FOR HIGH TIMES IN THE DARK (2020):\n\nLA WEEKLY The band refers to their sound as “garage cabaret” and that fits beautifully…’High Times in the Dark’ is Chicago band The Claudettes’ fifth album, and it’s an absolute gem. The key is the punk-blues piano of Johnny Iguana blended with the gorgeous vocals of future breakout star Berit Ulseth…The band is composed of super talented musicians…But damn, Ulseth’s voice…her work here is captivating…There’s no filler here…enthralling…It’s a record that ends and you want to hit ‘play’ again. Don’t resist. (Album of the Week)\n\nNPR MUSIC Chicago’s original recipe band…The Claudettes’ sonic playing field is the blues and everything after, all tastefully and artfully blended together….Perhaps the band’s greatest super power: songwriting…The Claudettes showcase the band’s range of motion, setting a lingering mood with ‘The Sun Will Fool You’ as Ulseth’s ethereal voice and Iguana’s piano sweetly sing a sad ballad that would not be out of place in an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.\n\nLOUDER THAN WAR (UK) Eleven prime fresh cuts of glorious attitude-packed musicianship, with vocals delivered by an angel…Berit’s voice is somehow simultaneously formidable and serene & heavenly…superb…achingly beautiful…will have you reaching for the repeat button.\n\nSTEPHEN THOMAS ERLEWINE, ALLMUSIC.COM ‘High Times in the Dark’ is filled with clever, soulful rock & roll that’s rooted in blues, jazz, and R&B but veers toward classic pop: music that’s designed to be played in the heart of the night but is snappy and catchy enough to shine brightly during the day….Iguana has tightened his writing, a refinement that helps Ulseth command attention with her lithe vocals. She plays with her phrasing like a jazz singer but keeps her focus on the stories of the songs, sounding as convincing on the MeToo takedown ‘Declined’ as she does on the sly rocker ‘Grandkids, Wave Bye-Bye.’ It all adds up to a vibrant listening experience, one that feels fresh even as it flirts with the past. (4 stars, Editor’s Choice)\n\nNO DEPRESSION (Amos Perrine) The most intriguing and the most difficult to describe of this bunch…hard-driving New Orleans-inspired piano anchors a wall-of-sound approach…Berit Ulseth’s vocals sometimes simmer, sometimes soar, marking this as an ambitious, elegant record, the likes of which are in short supply…what these four have done is no small feat…if (it) doesn’t grab you, then I don’t know what will.\n\nJOHN APICE, AMERICANA HIGHWAYS Johnny Iguana’s piano adds colorful melodic lift, and the dynamics of the production are filled with energy and enthusiasm. But the rich vocals of Berit Ulseth are the real personality charm of the band…Berit really asserts herself on each song as the LP goes deeper….The beauty of the rolling piano notes drive ‘You Drummers Keep Breaking My Heart’…its superbly recorded vocals are a stunner. If I had to give stars, this LP gets 5.\n\nGLIDE MAGAZINE This may well be a coming-out party for vocalist Berit Ulseth…it’s blues-jazz-soul with a vocalist that sings rather than shouts…the Claudettes keep it full-throttle…this recording will send echoes from Julie London to Allen Toussaint to garage rockers like the Detroit Cobras and the Black Keys…exceptionally strong and musically rich…’High Times in the Dark’ is the band’s fifth release and by far the best yet.\n\nPOP MATTERS A particularly potent batch of compositions that highlight the quartet’s undeniable chemistry. Johnny Iguana’s piano remains a driving force within the group while Berit Ulseth’s inimitable vocal style remains front-and-center. The Claudettes have stepped comfortably into their finest moment yet via ‘High Times in the Dark.’ The new single is ’24/5,’ which spotlights the group’s ability to marry humor with uncompromising musical ferocity.\n\nTHE ALTERNATE ROOT Gypsy accents…majestic theatrics…soul-saving boogie…carnival cabaret…’High Times in the Dark’ sets up as main stage, big tent, taking the audience away from the troubles of day-to-day life with the merry melodrama of the Claudettes….The band put the bomp into pomp…(A) beautiful mash-up of coordinated chaos.\n\nGOLDMINE MAGAZINE For their fifth album, the Claudettes are having some ‘High Times In The Dark,’ for it is here where this eccentric eclectic Chicago band elevates its lead singer into diva territory. Berit Ulseth is that good. So is the Jerry Lee Lewis/Memphis Slim piano of band founder Johnny Iguana….Rooted in a kind of mix’n’match rootsy 1960s hippiedom…the songs come totally alive. Ulseth is a great communicator. You believe her….and the desire that permeates her soul…in track after track. She emotes. And I don’t remember them ever being this good!”\n\nDITTY TV So fun and lively and energetic…(a) wonderful blend of musical genres that gives the Claudettes such a distinctive sound…we love the album.\n\nMOUNTAIN STAGE (NPR) If you like NRBQ, Medeski Martin and Wood, or any combination of amped up piano soul, then you’ll like the Claudettes.\n\nBILL KOPP/MUSOSCRIBE What the Claudettes do is truly special: their music can’t be described in a few words, and it’s so damn good that one doesn’t even want to try. Let the music speak for itself…You’ll hear echoes of blues, R&B, punk and postwar jazz…and it all rocks with an undeniably sophisticated, sexy swagger.\n\nNEW CITY (Chicago) The latest, wittiest outing from the rollicking post-lounge, acid-cabaret, piano-driven alt-boogie ensemble (and if you’ve got a better descriptor, let’s hear it). (Music Top 5, May 2020)\n\nBLOGCRITICS (Jeff Burger) Their challenging, exhilarating sound profits substantially from the piano work and adventurous compositions of Johnny Iguana. But their biggest asset is singer Berit Ulseth, whose captivating vocals variously recall artists as diverse as Julie London, Ruby & the Romantics and Blondie’s Deborah Harry. This inventive fifth album, which finds her singing largely about love, lust, and heartbreak, is arguably their best.\n\nILLINOIS ENTERTAINER (Jeff Elbel) Chicago’s baffling, delightful, and utterly unique band…its crowning achievement, “High Times in the Dark” is packed with memorable melodies, stunning performances, and stories that are witty and wise, as well as touching and timely…a sophisticated, satisfying, and quixotically cohesive sound. The Claudettes are grand champions leading a genre of precisely one band.\n\nBLUES ROCK REVIEW A pretty voice and lots of piano don’t seem like a natural combination for blues-inspired rock and roll but the Claudettes rock hard using both….Iguana’s keyboard work deftly slips in and out of genres, often before you have time to process what he’s doing. Mostly because you’re distracted by Ulseth’s voice, which is breathy and flirty, but also intimidating…an impressively strong set of music…11 songs that merge ’50s rock, disco, classical, and pop…8.5 out of 10.\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS INDY If this Chicago bluesy rock band offered a high-school confidential with their 2018 album, its follow-up is a riff-filled rocker that never flags in energy. Lead singer Berit Ulseth has never soungain.ded more sultry, like a good-natured Lana Del Rey out to own the juke joint….A party-starter, perfect for the days when parties can be started again.\n\nTHE VINYL DISTRICT The band pulls off the difficult feat of being clearly roots cognizant while never sounding like a dusted-off relic….’High Times in the Dark’ is not a bit hackneyed, which is an absence worth celebrating….a sound that smartly puts Ulseth’s skills up front….she brings appealing soul music verve to the proceedings….As this set unwinds there’s considerable pop savvy on display, and in spots the LP is kinda like a 21 century version of what Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd, and the Dixie Flyers were doing.\n\nWINNIPEG FREE PRESS Great bands often lurk in between the cracks of more popular tastes….The Claudettes mix and meld their sound into something not quite conventional yet soulful, bluesy and at times even jazzy….fronted by the sultry and sweet vocals of Berit Ulseth….Ulseth’s singing has an easy charm, with a vibrant falsetto….(Iguana’s) keyboard work is fantastic everywhere on the record; his immaculate flourishes and lead melody lines really inform everything….The opening track, “Bad Babe, Losin’ Touch,” is a near perfect pop song with an ensemble kick that Ulseth rides above. (4 out of 5 stars)\n\nNPR MUSIC: STATION BREAKS (The Best New Songs from NPR Member Stations) This high-octane piano rocker (“Declined”) boasts a ton of swagger, especially from vocalist Berit Ulseth. She gives the most tasteful rejections imaginable.\n\nSPILL MAGAZINE (TORONTO) The musical talent of the Claudettes is impressive, and never more so than in ‘High Times in the Dark,’ in particular that of keyboardist Johnny Iguana….Lead vocalist Berit Ulseth then steps in and the music is taken to another level….Ulseth’s almost jazz-like delivery of the lyrics pair flawlessly with the incredible piano performance of Iguana….Altogether, the album is a fresh and unique update on the sounds of the past. (4 out of 5 stars)\n\nJOHN B. MOORE, NEUFUTUR MAGAZINE A beautifully bastardized child of cabaret, pop, punk and rock, ‘High Times in the Dark’ is the band’s strongest offering to date…’You Drummers Keep Breaking My Heart’ is easily one of the best song yet dedicated to those who sat behind a kit….Over the course of five records, the Claudettes have managed to find their niche and perfect a sound that is both impressively broad and wildly fun. ‘High Times In The Dark’ is just further proof that the band deserves a much bigger stage.\n\nFOLK/TUMBLE (Ireland) ‘High Times in the Dark’ sees Chicago-based outfit the Claudettes return with a moody noir sound….Johnny Iguana’s keyboard skills on the record are sublime. Heavy pounding chord runs are mixed with subtle fills to hint at a style that lands somewhere between the works of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard. Add in the cabaret-punk vocal of Berit Ulseth to the mix alongside the booming drums of founding member, Michael Caskey, and the bass and guitar of Zach Verdoorn and the unique sound of The Claudettes really finds its feet….‘High Times in the Dark’ is a classic noir-infused rock-and-roll record that is full of eccentricity and emotion.\n\nCOACHELLA VALLEY WEEKLY Stylistically, the music of The Claudettes is all over the map. That’s a good thing….The Claudettes effortlessly offer a smorgasbord of sounds…Berit’s elastic style lands somewhere between Teutonic chanteuse Ute Lemper and the willowy grace of Sundays front-woman, Harriet Wheeler. Johnny’s inventive keyboard prowess anchors each song, mercurial one minute and tranquil the next. Ultimately, High Times In The Dark is a rollicking good time.\n\nGRANT BRITT, NO DEPRESSION ‘Creeper Weed’ features Iguana banging away like Jerry Lee and Ulseth warbling frenetically over the top like a chanteuse on Ritalin…’24/5′ is metal-clad boogie-woogie laid over a relentless head-banging rhythm section…’Declined’ is a rattly rocker barely restrained from kicking out the jams by Ulseth’s velvety delivery….Always unpredictable, deliciously abnormal, ‘High Times in the Dark’ is a happy hour you’ll hang around for till last call.\n\nBIG TAKEOVER Wild-eyed and thoroughly fun, the Claudettes cook up an eclectic brew of brash pop and moody cabaret on the vastly entertaining “High Times in the Dark”….Ulseth plays the smoky cocktail chanteuse or the brassy blues shouter with equal authority….This smart, snappy album will make bad times a little easier to bear and turn future good times into a party.\n\nROOTS HIGHWAY (Italy) A band that really has a lot to teach to the myriad blues bands that too often are content to follow the twelve bars without too much originality….A series of songs where frenzied rhythms and pianos with Jerry Lee Lewis in the engine punch with melodic structures swinging and caressing. A union that works, and indeed avoids the affectation that has often infected the swing revival…making the Claudettes, despite all their retro mania, a group that manages to stand out from the crowd.\n\ninMusic (Germany) The Claudettes surprise with a wonderfully varied mix of blues,soul, R&B, rockabilly and jazz…especially the inimitable vocals of singer Berit Ulseth.\n\nTHE BLUES AND ROOTS MUSIC BLOG (Australia) There’s a lot going on with this album, and it’s all good. The multi-talented and genre-defying Claudettes have a sound that’s steeped in American roots and they present it in an intoxicating and seductive style that is fresh and expansive. The ’60s sound is certainly evident and the top-flight vocals of Berit Ulseth blend in perfectly with the energetic and skillful musical talents of Johnny Iguana, Zach Verdoorn and Michael Caskey. Producer Ted Hutt has done a sterling effort mixing it all together and has captured the essence of their eclectic sounds with poetic perfection.\n\nHIPPO PRESS (New Hampshire) This female-fronted Chicago band…can come out and surprise you with beautifully airy ’70s-cruising pop when you least expect it (“I Swear to God I Will” melts in the ears like chocolate mousse)…Amanda Palmer without the over-amped melodrama, or maybe Carole King with a quicker pulse. (Grade: A)\n\nAMERICAN SONGWRITER It nods from diverse influences to piano blues and rockabilly to roots, jazz and soul. They’ve cultivated a sound that’s equally clamorous and shimmering–hence the term ‘garage cabaret’…a sense of bravado, both vocally and instrumentally.\n\nSCENE POINT BLANK GIMME THAT CLAUDETTES ALBUM! PLEASE!…By the time the band starts their third song “I Swear To God I Will” you know you are in love with the singer. What a voice! She seduces, she entrances….their fifth album…is their best ever. (9 out of 10 stars)\n\nHISTORIA DEL BLUES (Bogota, Colombia) A kind of catharsis…with much love and humor…’High Times in the Dark’ is an unpredictable album…based on Chicago blues but it has many New Orleans touches…it moves through rock, jazz, R&B and punk, without establishing a boundary between them…a very fresh sound that likes to flirt with the past.\n\nTHE ROCKING MAGPIE (UK) The Claudettes draw enthusiastically on a variety of classic forms and styles….Johnny Iguana dominates with some marvelous barrel-house New Orleans piano, while the silky vocals of Berit Ulseth wind their way in and out in a soulful manner over a sharp rhythm section of Zach Verdoorn and Michael Caskey…veering at times between Bo Diddley and Sade….The album brings together a variety of styles in a sharply performed manner and it’s a fine taster for the live arena, where the dynamics of the band’s sound will surely excel. Hopefully it won’t be too long before they make these shores for me to find out!\n\nBLUES NEWS (NORWAY) An engaging mix of blues, rock and pop….The songs are excellent, varied and exciting, and the playing is inspired, playful, relaxed and cool. Berit Ulseth is a true find–super cool in her expression, with style and attitude…highly recommended….It is like a blues/rock/pop/punk cabaret….unpredictable, and highly entertaining.
