        "text": "Well, after about two years away, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has recently released its 2023 ballot, and while I’m two weeks behind, better late than never.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockhall.com%2Frock-roll-hall-fame-foundation-announces-nominees-2023-induction&psig=AOvVaw3_c2Dz11FwEFOLRgQu4Eho&ust=1675560871147000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjhxqFwoTCJDLgfTc-vwCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAR\n\nKate Bush\n\nGenres: Art Rock, Baroque Pop, Progressive Pop\n\nKey Recordings: The Kick Inside [1978], “Breathing” [1980], The Dreaming [1982], Hounds of Love [1985], “Don’t Give Up” [1986; with Peter Gabriel (2010 w Genesis/2014)], The Sensual World [1989]\n\nEligible Since: 2003\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2018, 2021, 2022\n\nKate Bush returns to the ballot for her fourth nomination, now armed with her resurgence courtesy of the use of her hit “Running Up That Hill” on Stranger Things. As far as Bush’s career, what can I say? From her debut single “Wuthering Heights” in 1978 at the tender age of 19-becoming the first female artist to hit #1 on the UK charts with a self-penned song-to being one of the earliest artists to utilize the Fairlight CMI on a commercial record, from being the first known artist to use a headset with a wireless microphone onstage to collaborating with mega elites like Peter Gabriel (2010 w Genesis;2014), Prince (2004), Elton John (1994), and David Gilmour (1996 w Pink Floyd), influencing and/or being covered/sampled by the likes of Radiohead (2019), PJ Harvey, OutKast (seriously, Big Boi is a MAJOR Kate Bush fanboy), Adele, Tupac (2017), Pat Benatar and Neil Geraldo (2022), Herbie Hancock, St. Vincent, Björk, Coldplay, Florence And The Machine, Boy George, Brazilian thrash band Angra, Tank, free jazz guitarist Sonny Sharrock, John Lydon (2006 w The Sex Pistols), The Prodigy, Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Kim Petras, Lady Gaga, you name it.\n\nKate Bush is a brilliant artist, simply put. And while this is obviously not her first time on the ballot, the aforementioned resurgence means this is the best shot she’s ever had. I am definitely routing for Kate, she is a true diamond in the rough who’s shine has never dimmed but rather brightened as time goes on.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest\n\nMembers: Kamaal “Q-Tip” Fareed, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Malik “Phife Dawg” Taylor†, Jarobi White\n\nGenres: Alternative Hip Hop, Jazz Rap, East Coast Hip Hop, Progressive Hip Hop\n\nKey Recordings: People’s Instinctive Travels And The Paths Of Rhythm (1990), The Low End Theory (1991), Midnight Marauders (1993), We Got It From Here…Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)\n\nEligible Since: 2015\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2022\n\nA Tribe Called Quest, one of Alternative Hip Hop’s pillars in the early 1990s, make their second consecutive appearance on the ballot. The biggest act to come out of the Native Tongues collective, A Tribe Called Quest played a crucial development in the development of alternative hip hop, being among the first acts to based their sampling around jazz rather than the likes of James Brown and Parliament-Funkadelic as well as bringing forward more abstract lyricism and consciousness into hip hop. In addition, their album The Low End Theory has recently been inducted into the Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry, which is for sound recordings considered “historically, culturally, and/or aesthetically significant, and/or reflects life in the United States”.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest, a phenomenal group, a group that really opened the doors for so many others such as The Roots, D’Angelo, Kanye West, J Dilla, Consequence, Scarface from the Geto Boys, OutKast, really, almost all alternative hip hop. It’s unfortunate that Phife Dawg isn’t with us anymore, but nonetheless, Tribe’s work and legacy speak for themselves, and the group would be a very welcome addition to the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. Can definitely see ?uestlove doing the honors of inducting them. Excellent pick, glad to see them back on the ballot.\n\nIron Maiden\n\nMembers: Clive Burr†, Paul Di’Anno, Bruce Dickinson, Janick Gers, Steve Harris, Nicko McBrain, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, Dennis Stratton\n\nGenres: Heavy Metal, NWOBHM, Progressive Metal\n\nKey Recordings: Iron Maiden (1980), Killers (1981), Number Of The Beast (1982), Peace Of Mind (1983), Powerslave (1984), Live After Death (1985), Somewhere In Time (1986), Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son (1988), Brave New World (1999)\n\nEligible Since: 2005\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2021\n\nAh, yes, Iron Maiden. One of the most iconic metal bands of all time, over 130 million albums sold worldwide-all with little radioplay or mainstream support, might I add, the metal mascot of metal mascots in Eddie, one of the most influential rock or metal bassists Steve Harris, an array of British stamps in the band’s honor (joining the likes of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, and Queen), revered as one of the greatest live bands of all time, leading figures in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, one of the most rabid fanbases you’ll find in rock and metal, or all of popular music for that matter, you name it.\n\nGiving Judas Priest getting in last year (through a back door induction, but I digress), it was only time before Maiden returned to the ballot, and while I wish Motörhead was occupying this spot, Maiden is certainly worthy of induction. And while I always figured on the Piece of Mind lineup plus Di’Anno and Burr being inducted, it is a pleasant surprise to see Dennis Stratton included, and I can’t complain about longtime guitarist Janick Gers being included as well. I can heartily agree with this one, no issue at all.\n\nThe Spinners\n\nMembers: Henry Fambrough, Billy Henderson†, Pervis Jackson†, Bobbie Smith†, Phillipe Wynne†\n\nSnubbed Members: G.C. Cameron, John Edwards\n\nGenres: R&B, Soul, Philly Soul, Funk, Disco\n\nKey Recordings: “It’s A Shame” (1970), Spinners (1973), New And Improved (1974), Pick Of The Litter (1975), “The Rubberband Man” (1976), “Workin My Way Back To You/Forgive Me, Girl” (1979), “Cupid” (1980)\n\nEligible Since: 1987\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2012, 2015, 2016\n\nAfter seven years, The Spinners make their return to the ballot. From their early days in Detroit to their breakthrough with 1970’s “It’s A Shame” (co-written and produced by 1989 inductee Stevie Wonder), their move to Atlantic Records and collaborating with writer/producer Thom Bell to produce a string of hit songs and records that helped define 1970s Philly Soul. Though they haven’t always gained the same recognition of their peers at Motown or even some of their Philly Soul peers like The O’Jays, The Spinners have certainly made their impact. They remain a popular touring act, even with most of the classic members having passed on; they’ve influenced or been covered/sampled by the likes of David Bowie (1996), Elvis Costello (2003), Elton John (1994), Todd Rundgren (2021), The Doobie Brothers (2020), Boyz II Men, the Bee Gees (1997), Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five (2007), Wu Tang Clan member Raekwon, legendary session guitarist Paul Jackson Jr., What Is This? (featuring members of Queens Of The Stone Age, 2012 inductees Red Hot Chili Peppers, and 2017 inductees Pearl Jam), DMX, Darryl Hall And John Oates (2014), Seal, Regina Belle, Jay Z (2021), 2Pac (2017), LL Cool J (2021), James Taylor (2000), Gladys Knight (1996 with The Pips), and MF DOOM among others; their music has been used in media such as Stripes (1981), Spaceballs (1987), Avengers: Infinity Wars (2018), Twins (1988), Black Joy (1977), That 70’s Show (1998-06), Malcolm In The Middle (2000-06), Donnie Brisco (1997), Cold Case (2003-10), Beauty Shop (2005), and True Blood (2008-14).\n\nVery nice to see The Spinners back on the ballot, they’re way overdue for induction. I will say that I question the absence of two people-G.C. Cameron, Phillipe Wynne’s predecessor and cousin who sang lead on “It’s A Shame”, the group’s breakthrough hit that paved the way for the run on Atlantic, plus bringing Phillipe onboard, and then Wynne’s successor John Edwards, who was in the group for over twenty years and appeared on hits like “Workin’ My Way Back To You/Forgive Me, Girl” and “Cupid”. Hopefully, this is rectified by the Hall before too late, especially since they’re the only two 70’s members besides founding member Henry Fambrough still with us.\n\nSoundgarden\n\nMembers: Matt Cameron*, Chris Cornell†, Matt Shepherd, Kim Thayil, Hiro Yamamoto\n\nGenres: Grunge, Alternative Metal, Heavy Metal, Hard Rock, Neo-Psychedelia\n\nKey Recordings: Louder Than Love (1989), BadMotorFinger (1991), Superunknown (1994)\n\nEligible Since: 2013\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2020\n\nMaking their second appearance on the ballot is 2020 nominee Soundgarden. Grunge pioneers, their rise helping establish Sub Pop as a premier indie label (and influencing Kurt Cobain’s decision to sign Nirvana with the label), also helping bridge alternative and heavy metal alongside peers like Jane’s Addiction and Faith No More. Albums like BadMotorFinger and Superunknown are staples of 90’s Rock, Matt Cameron is among the greatest rock drummers of his generation, Kim Thayil a gifted guitarist in his own right, Hiro Yamamoto and Ben Shepherd are great bassists, and of course, you have a top flight singer, songwriter, and frontman in the late great Chris Cornell.\n\nHonestly, I figured it was only time before Soundgarden returned to the ballot, but I’m nonetheless very pleased to see them here. I love Soundgarden, they really were the full package-the band, the singer, the songwriting, a signature sound all while continuing to expand their horizons. And giving that the ballot isn’t as jam packed with hard rock and heavy metal this year, Soundgarden has a much better shot this year than they did last time. And with their induction, this would be a second induction for Matt Cameron after being inducted with Pearl Jam in 2017. In addition, Cameron and Cornell going in this year would make Temple Of The Dog the second group after The Traveling Wilburys to have each member inducted without the group itself being inducted.\n\nThe White Stripes\n\nMembers: Jack White, Meg White\n\nKey Recordings: De Stijl (2000), White Blood Cells (2001), Elephant (2003), Get Behind Me Satan (2005), Icky Thump (2007)\n\nEligible Since: 2023\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nThe first newly eligible nominee on the ballot is power duo The White Stripes. One of the central bands in the 2000s garage rock revival, pillars of indie rock, one of the most critically acclaimed acts of their era, while also gaining commercial success thanks to their minimalist style, their unique aesthetic based around simple reds, whites, and blacks, the no-nonsense playing of leader Jack and drummer Meg, and the blending of punk, blues, and garage rock. And since disbanding in 2011, the group’s stature has arguably only grown.\n\nWhat more can I say about The White Stripes? Easily one of the best rock groups of the 2000s at a time when we stuck in the middle of post-grunge and nu metal circling the drain, we had two supposed-siblings-who-were-actually-amicable-exes-but-acted-as-siblings-to-keep-the-focus-from-their-music coming in with no frills, no nonsense rock and roll filtered trough raw punk and blues. Album-wise, you really can’t go wrong with The White Stripes and breaking up when they did may very well have been the way to go, because they went out on a high note. With The White Stripes being inducted, that would make the fourth year in a row with a FYI, and I am naturally curious if the famously private Meg White performs with Jack or even attends.\n\nJoy Division/New Order\n\nMembers: Ian Curtis†, Gillian Gilbert, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris, Bernard Sumner\n\nGenres: Post-Punk, Gothic Rock, New Wave, Alternative Dance, Electronic Rock\n\nKey Recordings: Unknown Pleasures (1979; Joy Division), “Transmission” (1979; Joy Division), Closer (1980; Joy Division), “Love Will Tear Us Apart” (1980; Joy Division), “Ceremony” (1981; New Order/Joy Division), “Temptation” (1982; New Order), Power, Corruption, & Lies (1983; New Order), Low-Life (1985; New Order), “Bizarre Love Triangle” (1986; New Order), “True Faith” (1987; New Order), Technique (1989; New Order), Republic (1993)\n\nEligible Since: 2004\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nJoy Division and New Order. What would modern indie or popular music be without these two intertwined groups? In Joy Division, you have THE post-punk band, a pioneer in gothic rock, one of the most influential vocalists of alternative music in the late Ian Curtis, a truly creative and unorthodox bassist in Peter Hook, an equally innovative and original guitarist in Bernard Sumner, a solid drummer in Stephen Morris, and a maverick producer in Martin Hannett. They put Factory Records on the map and showed that punk could be more than righteous fury but just as easily in mood and atmosphere. Hooky, along with Public Image Ltd’s Jah Wobble and Talking Heads’ Tina Weymouth, really established the bass as a crucial cornerstone of punk and widened its sonic palette in the process. And in New Order, you have a band overcoming the tragic death of their singer and beginning a new chapter. In the process, they would create a legacy that proved rich and vibrant in its own right, pioneering Alternative Dance in the process and achieving commercial success in the process. But most importantly, they are a musical phoenix, a symbol that things can always improve and get better.\n\nWhat can I say? I love Joy Division and New Order, two amazing bands whose work has stood the test of time, both long overdue for induction. I don’t have a problem with them being inducted together, since not only do you have three of the same people in both groups, but even overlap in musical DNA. Let’s face it, Movement is probably not too far off from what a third Joy Division record would have sounded like, considering that the band had already begun experimenting with synthesizers before Ian’s death. Likewise, “Ceremony” began life as a Joy Division song before evolving into what became New Order.\n\nRegardless, very pleased to see JD/NO on the ballot. And who knows? Maybe a reunion with Hook? Well, we can dream, at least.\n\nGeorge Michael†\n\nGenres: Pop, Blue-Eyed Soul, Dance-Pop, Post-Disco, R&B\n\nKey Recordings: “Careless Whisper” (1984; Wham! Featuring George Michael), Faith (1987), Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 (1990), “Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me” (1991; with Elton John)\n\nEligible Since: 2010\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nFrom one eighties alternative mainstay to one eighties pop mainstay, the late George Michael makes his first appearance on the ballot. From his time with Wham! where he and partner Andrew Rigley scored hits such as “Wake Me Up Before You Go”, “Last Christmas”, and especially “Careless Whisper”, to his mega success as a solo artist, over 125 million records sold, with Faith alone selling 25 million to date, two time Grammy winner, collaborator with the likes of Elton John (1994), Queen (2001), Ray Charles (1986), Aretha Franklin (1987), Whitney Houston (2020), Paul McCartney (1988 w The Beatles/1999), and Mary J Blige, in addition to being an LGBT rights and HIV/AIDS research activist. And since his death on Christmas Day 2016 (giving “Last Christmas” a bit of cruel irony in hindsight), his legacy and popularity has continued to endure.\n\nI can’t claim to be the biggest George Michael fan, but I do like some George Michael. Very talented guy, great singer, and really, you just can’t resist that saxophone kicking off “Careless Whisper”. An induction would obviously be bittersweet giving his death, but I’m sure plenty of artists would be happy to perform in honor of him. Also, if he is inducted, I’d love to see Ryan Reynolds induct him. Deadpool does love him some George Michael and Wham!\n\nDuly noted. Make It Big did earn them that exclamation.\n\nRage Against The Machine\n\nGenres: Rap Metal, Funk Metal, Alternative Metal, Hard Rock\n\nMembers: Tim Cummerford, Zack de la Rocha, Tom Morello, Brad Wilk\n\nKey Recordings: Rage Against The Machine (1992), Evil Empire (1996), The Battle of Los Angeles (1999)\n\nEligible Since: 2017\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022\n\nRage Against The Machine appears on the ballot. Again. A significant act in 90s Alternative and Funk Metal, pioneers in Rap Metal, politically and socially conscious lyrics and activism that resonates as much today as it ever did, very innovative and unconventional guitar work from Tom Morello, some classic tracks and records in the process (particularly the debut).\n\nI’m going to be blunt, how many times are we going to see them on the ballot? It’s getting tiring at this point, not least because of Morello’s place on the Nominating Committee, which totally doesn’t look at least a little shady, plus all of their contemporaries who’ve struggled to get on the ballot. And for the third year in a row? They (really, Tom) do realize that the more you push an act on the ballot, the more apathetic voters get, right?\n\nPutting that aside, I won’t complain about seeing them inducted, and it is fairly interesting that Soundgarden AND Rage could both be inducted, which would make Audioslave the third group to have each member inducted without the group itself being inducted. Beyond that, I’m not super blown away by this one.\n\nSheryl Crow\n\nGenres: Rock, Roots Rock, Country Rock, Pop, Adult Alternative\n\nKey Recordings: Tuesday Night Music Club (1993), Sheryl Crow (1996), The Globe Sessions (1998), C’Mon, C’Mon (2002), “Picture” (2002, with Kid Rock)\n\nEligible Since: 2019\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nOur third first time nominee appears in the form of singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow, who had previously inducted Fleetwood Mac in 1998 as well as taking part in the 2014 tribute to that year’s inductee Linda Ronstadt. Over 50 million records sold worldwide, nine Grammy wins (out of 32 nominations to date), being the rare winner of “Best New Artist” to not suffer the “curse” of the award, has collaborated with the likes of the aforementioned Fleetwood Mac, Johnny Cash (1992), The Rolling Stones (1989), Sting (2003 w The Police), Loretta Lynn, Vince Gill, Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton (1992 w The Yarbirds;1993 w Cream;2000), Michael Jackson (1997 w The Jackson 5;2001), Leon Russell (2011; Award For Musical Excellence), Prince (2004), Jerry Lee Lewis (1986), Smokey Robinson (1987), Barry Gibb (1997 w The Bee Gees), Miley Cyrus, Chris Stapleton, Stevie Wonder (1989), Scott Weiland, and so many more, in addition to contributing a James Bond theme with “Tomorrow Never Dies” as being accomplished on guitar, piano, harmonica, bass, accordion, ukele, cello, and autoharp.\n\nWhile I might not be the biggest Sheryl Crow fan, I don’t have an issue with her, very talented and accomplished woman. For somebody that a lot of people initially dismissed as a flash in the pan, Sheryl has truly proven herself as an enduring presence in popular music across multiple genres, and has generally stayed true to herself in the process. All of that in addition to being a breast cancer survivor and subsequently doing a lot for breast cancer awareness and research, I definitely have nothing but respect for her, so no problem at all with her being on the ballot OR being inducted.\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nGenres: New Wave, Pop Rock, Synthpop\n\nKey Recordings: She’s So Unusual (1983), “Goonies R Good Enough” (1985), “True Colors” (1986)\n\nEligible Since: 2009\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nCyndi Lauper, the one and only. Icon of the 80s, fashion, and feminism, humanitarian, LGBT rights activist, inspiration to the likes of Katy Perry, Lagy Gaga, Kim Petras, and Tegan and Sara, Songwriter Hall of Fame inductee, Hollywood Walk of Fame Star recipient, key figure in the Rock and Wrestling crossover of the 1980’s,composer of popular Broadway musical Kinky Boots, just one Oscar short of being in the EGOT Club, singer of the Goonies’ theme song. Cyndi Lauper has seen it all, done it all, with her debut album She’s So Unusual remaining a cornerstone of the 80’s, to the point of being inducted by the Library of Congress into its National Recording Registry, which recognizes recordings that historically, culturally, and aesthetically significant.\n\nCyndi Lauper is a name I wasn’t necessarily expecting to see on the ballot, but I certainly welcome it. Not only because I’m happy for the people at InductCyndiLauper, but also because she really would be a welcome presence at the Hall. And they’ve already got her in the Women Who Rock exhibit, so a solid pick all around.\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nGenres: Country, Outlaw Country, Blues, Jazz, Gospel\n\nKey Recordings: Shotgun Willie (1973), Phases and Stages (1974), The Red Headed Stranger (1975), Wanted! The Outlaws (1976; with Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser), “Mammas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys” (1978; w Waylon Jennings), Stardust (1978), Always On My Mind (1982)\n\nEligible Since: 1986\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nAfter Dolly Parton’s induction last year, we have another country music icon on this year’s ballot in the Red Headed Stranger himself, Mr. Willie Nelson. One of the founding fathers of the Outlaw movement, American icon, one of the great songwriters even before hitting stardom in the 70’s, countless awards, produced and starred in the pilot of long running and much beloved series Austin City Limits, 60 million records sold worldwide, multiple stabs at acting, a beloved figure among young and old, liberal or conservative, and many people across different walks of life.\n\nSuper cool to see Willie on the ballot, a true legend and icon. Giving that Paul Shaffer has pushed for Willie, and he’s likely not the only one, it makes total sense to see Willie’s name on the ballot, and he’s a welcome addition to the ballot. Country music is one of the key genres that gave birth to the bastard we know and love as rock’n’roll, and Willie is more rock’n’roll than most the rock bands currently inducted. And definitely get him in while he’s still here, especially as the man is turning 90 this year.\n\nMissy Elliott\n\nGenres: Hip Hop, R&B, Progressive Hip Hop\n\nKey Recordings: Supa Dupa Fly (1997), Miss E…So Addictive (2001), Under Constrution (2002)\n\nEligible Since: 2023\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nThe Queen of Rap herself, Missy Elliott, is the second newly eligible nominee on this year’s ballot. Singer, songwriter, rapper, actress, producer, you name it, Missy “Misdemeanor” Elliott has done it. Since the release of her debut Supa Dupa Fly in 1997, which had the highest chart debut for a female rapper at the time at #3, she has sold 40 million records worldwide, won four Grammys, received the MTV Video Awards’ Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, and became the first female rapper inducted into the Songwriters Hall Of Fame.\n\nVery pleasant surprise to see Missy on the ballot, she’s extremely deserving of recognition, and I’m naturally happy for Mary at the Rock Hall Watchers podcast since she’s been passionate about seeing more women inducted and particularly seeing female rappers be nominated and inducted. And honestly, I’d say she has a very strong chance of being inducted this year, which could give 2023 two FYI artists in Missy and The White Stripes.\n\nWarren Zevon\n\nGenres: Rock, Folk Rock, Hard Rock, Blues Rock, Singer-Songwriter\n\nKey Recordings: Warren Zevon (1976), Excitable Boy (1978), Sentimental Hygiene (1987), Life’ll Kill Ya (2000), The Wind (2003)\n\nEligible Since: 1995\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nLast but not least, maybe the one nominee that truly surprised me, the late Warren Zevon is receiving his first nomination, perhaps thanks to a letter by 1999 inductee Billy Joel. While most know him for “Werewolves of London” and “Lawyers, Guns,& Money”, the man was a songwriter’s songwriter. Known for his wit and sardonic lyrics, what Warren lacked in regular commercial success he more than made up for with the admiration and respect of his peers. Among those who’ve covered him, expressed admiration for him, or even collaborated with him are the likes of Linda Ronstadt (2014), Jackson Browne (2004), Bonnie Raitt (2000), Hank Williams Jr., Bruce Springsteen (1999), Pixies, The Everly Brothers (1986), The War On Drugs, members of both Fleetwood Mac (1998) and Eagles (1998), George Clinton (1997 with Parliament-Funkadelic), Carl Wilson (1988 w The Beach Boys), R.E.M. (2007), Tom Petty (2002 w Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers), Bob Dylan (1988), and GG Allin.\n\nI’ll admit that Warren Zevon is an artist I didn’t immediately “get” when I was younger, though I could always recognize and respect the man’s talent. But who knows? Maybe it was the pandemic aging me to a certain extent, but I’m really glad I’ve revisited Warren Zevon, because I *get it* now. And of course, I’m naturally very happy that he’s shown up on the ballot after all these years. And giving just how revered he is in the biz, Warren’s arguably one of the safest bets this year.\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTS:\n\nThat is the 2023 Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame ballot. There’s maybe a nitpick or two, but overall, a pretty good if rather small ballot. I am a little bit disappointed not to see at least three or four more names on here, and as Mary rightfully pointed out, you could easily have put women like Grace Jones on the ballot, or bring Mary Wells or The Marvelletes back, maybe even finally nominate Diana Ross solo. And of course, I can think of other names that could be on the ballot, but that’s for another post.\n\nNo matter, it’s smaller than it could or really should be, but it’s a respectable ballot, and I can’t gripe too much. I’m not going to predict the Class just yet, I’ll save that for when we get closer to the Class being officially announced, but welcome back to The Musical Zamboni, happy to be back after all this time.\n\nThe Class of 2021 is here, folks! The first ballot with John Sykes as Chairman of the Nominating Committee, the most gender-diverse in the Hall’s history and the most racially diverse in who knows how long.\n\nI shared my predictions not long ago, and let’s see how I did this year. In 2019, I got 5 out of 7 right, and in 2020 I got 3 out of 6 right. How will my odds be this year?\n\nTina Turner*\n\nMy first prediction to turn out correct right out of the gate, Miss Tina Turner herself.\n\nCarole King*\n\nJust as I suspected, Carole and Tina both get their second inductions this year. Beginning as a songwriter with former husband Gerry Goffin, Carole would go on to become a highly accomplished performer in her own right.\n\nWith this induction, Carole becomes\n\nThe third woman to be inducted twice\n\nThe second person to be inducted into two or more categories after Ringo Starr, who received the Award For Musical Excellence in 2015 after his 1988 induction with The Beatles. She also surpasses Ringo for the longest period between inductions at 31 years.\n\nThe second two time inductee this year.\n\nShe’s the first person to be inducted as both a performer and non-performer.\n\nWhile people were not quite as confident in Carole’s induction as they were in Tina’s, I still felt pretty safe predicting her. Just like Tina, it took far too long for Carole to return to the ballot, but once she’s there, she had it in the bag.\n\nThe Go Go’s (Belinda Carlisle, Charlotte Caffey, Gina Schock, Kathy Valentine, Jane Wiedlin)\n\nThree in a row, man. The five gals who became the first self contained all female band to top the Billboard Album Charts, their debut being a landmark of American New Wave and putting IRS Records on the map.\n\nI knew it, I just knew it would happen. The stars were aligned for these ladies. With this induction, the Go Go’s become\n\nThe Foo Fighters (Dave Grohl*, Taylor Hawkins, Rami Jaffee, Nate Mendel, Chris Shiflett, Pat Smear)\n\nJust as virtually everybody expected, The Foo Fighters are being inducted this year. One of the biggest bands of the past 25 years or so, born out of the ashes of Nirvana, the Foo Fighters may not be the most innovative band, but they’re like the Doobie Brothers-a good, solid, likable band you can depend on. And you know what? Sometimes, that’s all you really need.\n\nWith this induction, Dave Grohl becomes…\n\nThe third two time inductee this year, and the only man being inducted a second time this year.\n\nThe twenty sixth person to receive a second induction.\n\nThe second Clyde McPhatter Club member to receive both inductions on the first year of eligibility after John Lennon.\n\nThe second drummer to be inducted twice after Ringo.\n\nJay-Z\n\nJay Z is my fifth prediction in a row to come true, and I’m right back to 2019 for momentum. He’s taking us back into the New York Groove for our potential first post-COVID ceremony, and besides that…\n\nHe’s the first living solo rapper to be inducted and the third solo rapper overall after 2Pac (2017) and The Notorious B.I.G. (2020).\n\nThe eighth hip hop inductee overall, and fifth to be inducted for the First Year of Eligibility.\n\nThe second FYE inductee this year after The Foo Fighters.\n\nTodd Rundgren\n\nWell fellow Hall Watcher Nick Bambach, you got me motherfucker!\n\nFor me, it’s not so much Todd going in at all but more that he’s being inducted as a Performer rather than for the Award For Musical Excellence, which is how I always figured he’d be inducted. No matter, this maverick of rock is being honored, and he’s more than deserving.\n\nBut wait! There’s more! More categories to cover, so let’s get it on!\n\nNon-Performers:\n\nClarence Avant\n\nInducted into the Non-Performers category this year is the Black Godfather himself, Mr. Clarence Avant.\n\nWhile many here may not be that familiar with Avant, let me give you a rundown as well as a recommendation of The Black Godfather on Netflix. To sum it up, Clarence Avant…\n\nHas managed artists such as Little Willie John (1996), Freddie Hubbard, Tom Wilson (producer of Bob Dylan, Zappa and The Mothers Of Invention, Kim Weston, Jimmy Smith, and pianist and score composer Lalo Schifrin.\n\nFounded Sussex Records, which launched Dennis Coffey (“Scorpio”), Bill Withers (2015), and Searching For Sugar Man subject Rodriguez.\n\nServed as executive producer on Save The Children, the 1972 benefit show and 1973 film which notably brought together all of the major labels of popular black music at the time (Motown, Stax, Atlantic).\n\nLater founded Tabu Records, which notably helped launch Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis’ careers as producers and songwriters.\n\nWas a key figure in getting Soul Train off the ground.\n\nNeedless to say, a rather accomplished man. And giving that he just turned 90, good to see him being honored while he’s still kicking.\n\nEarly Influences:\n\nCharley Patton†\n\nThe Father of The Delta Blues, Mr. Charley Patton. He wasn’t already in? Wow. So while we’ve been getting more modern, it’s nice to see our history still remaining apart of the Hall.\n\nKraftwerk (Karl Bartos, Wolfgang Flür, Ralf Hütter, Florian Schneider†)\n\nI’ll be a ding dong dally, Kraftwerk. Electronic pioneers that have done so much to shape popular music in the past 40+ years. Honestly, popular music of the past 40+ years is unthinkable without Kraftwerk. But they have had to keep reappearing on the ballot, go figure.\n\nShould they be in as Early Influences? Sure, hey’re actually finally in as they should already be.\n\nGil Scott-Heron†\n\nSon of a bitch, Gil Scott-Heron! The great Gil Scott-Heron, Jazz poet and hip hop pioneer, a man who’s work is as relevant as ever. Very pleasant surprise here, indeed.\n\nAward For Musical Excellence\n\nBilly Preston†\n\nAfter all these years, the Black Beatle himself is finally in.\n\nBesides his work with the Beatles (Let It Be, Anney Road, “Get Back”, the rooftop show, and on several of the band members’ solo projects), he was also…\n\nThe protege of Ray Charles (1986) and would often work with Charles in later years.\n\nAppeared on Nat King Cole’s show as a child, duetting with Cole on “On Blueberry Hill”.\n\nPerformed with artists such as Mahalia Jackson, Sam Cooke, Little Richard, The Everly Brothers (all 1986), The Rolling Stones (1989), Aretha Franklin (1987), Eric Clapton (1992 with The Yardbirds;1993 with Cream;2000), Sly & The Family Stone (1993), Red Hot Chili Peppers (2012), King Curtis (2000), and Elton John (1994) among many others.\n\nCo-wrote “You Are So Beautiful”, which became a hit for Joe Cocker.\n\nServed as the namesake for a track off Miles Davis (2006)’s Get Up With It.\n\nWas the first musical guest on Saturday Night Live.\n\nAlso had hits of his own as a solo artist. Among them are “Will It Go Round In Circles”, “Nothing From Nothing”, and the clavinet instrumental “Outa Space”. Seeing as this is theoretically a catch-all type of award, Billy is a perfect choice as somebody who had success in multiple areas.\n\nSadly, Billy Preston had a fairly tragic life and died in 2006 after years of addiction and health issues. With that said, his career is more than deserving of recognition, and I’m very pleased to see him get his due.\n\nRandy Rhoads†\n\nYes, guitar god Randy Rhoads is in the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame. A classically trained guitarist who set his first foot in the world of rock as co-founder of Quiet Riot, Randy got his big break as the lead guitar player for ex-Black Sabbath (2006) vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. Appearing on Blizzard of Ozz and Diary Of A Madman and hits like “Crazy Train”, “Flying High Again”, and “Over The Mountain” among others, Randy became one of the first true shred icons after Van Halen before his tragic death in a plane crash in 1982.\n\nWhile it’s disappointing to see Metal be underrepresented once again, it’s definitely good to see Randy receive recognition. We’re coming up on forty years since his death, yet he continues to endear and inspire. Giving that Tom Morello has talked about getting a Randy honored in the past, it’s not too surprising that he’s being inducted this year.\n\nAn amazing musician and a good guy by all accounts, the world lost a great deal when we lost Randy. So here’s a toast to Randy, may he Rest In Peace.\n\nLL Cool J\n\nFor our third and final Musical Excellence Award recipient, we have hip hop legend and repeat nominee LL Cool J.\n\nI admit, I’m a bit puzzled he’s going in this way while Todd goes in as a Performer despite being a better fit for this category, but I digress. LL Cool J is finally in for his contributions as hip hop’s first solo star, and we have one less name to keep sitting through every year.\n\nOverall Thoughts:\n\nNeedless to say, I did not see a lot of this coming, doubt most did. Not saying they’re bad surprises, they’re not, but there you go. Let’s get the cons out of the way.\n\nHowever, women appear in any of the additional categories, broadening the gender gap further. In the Early Influence category, for example, you could have honored Big Mama Thornton. Then there’s the Carter Family, which would give you about six women in Maybelle, Sara, Janette, Helen, Anita, and of course June. Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie? In the Non-Performers, you could have honored somebody like Sugarhill Records CEO Sylvia Robinson or Stax co-founder Estelle Axton. Musical Excellence, you could honored somebody like Carol Kaye or Merry Clayton. Everybody being honored this year is deserving, but if we’re trying to be more inclusive and address the gender gap, I feel the Hall missed an opportunity here.\n\nAnother missed opportunity would be Fela Kuti. Certainly can’t help but feel bad for his fans, who truly went in thinking “we might get Fela into this institution. And if he’s seem, then maybe we’ll be seen.”The Hall has faced criticism for being too American centric, and seeing as only one recipient comes from another country, a Fela Kuti induction would have been a good chance to widen their scope and audience. His darkhorse victory in the Fan Vote is certainly a testimony.\n\nAnd of course, the blurring of categories, let’s just get that out of the way. First, I want to reiterate that everybody being honored is worthy of induction. Any criticism is aimed at the process, not the artists themselves.\n\nThe current definitions of the Performers, Early Influences, and Award For Musical Excellence are as follow:\n\n[An award given to artists] who, in their careers, have created music whose originality, impact and influence has changed the course of rock & roll.\n\n[An award given to artists] whose music and performance style have directly influenced and helped inspire and evolve rock & roll and music that has impacted youth culture.\n\n[An award given to artists] whose originality and influence creating music have had a dramatic impact on music.\n\nThe definitions are so generic and vague that you honestly have to wonder “why have categories?” There’s clearly a reason for them, yet they’re rendered so meaningless now that literally anybody can go in.\n\nWith the Early Influences category, now the Influences category, you risk pushing aside the artists the award was meant for. There aren’t any shortage of acts to honor in this category-the fact that we’re only now recognizing Charley Patton says it all. And if we’re just using this category to shoehorn in acts we haven’t gotten inducted through their proper category, we’re essentially kicking people like Big Mama Thornton, Sonny Boy Williamson II, The Weavers, The Dominoes, and Blind Lemon Jefferson to the curb.\n\nEven if one wants to argue “oh, the Early Influence is being updated to now mean 50+ years, the Hall’s just updating it and evolving it.” Why not update and evolve the Performers category? That’s where most of the issues lie to begin with. Besides, all inductees are supposed to be influential, so what is different about these acts? Why have a “Influences” category?\n\nWith the Musical Excellence Award being turned into what essentially looks like a consolation prize, you’ve taken away from many side musicians and artists a chance to rescue the credit and recognition they’re so rarely afforded. Or people that are considered worthy of recognition by the Hall yet don’t quite fit into a category. Wouldn’t Todd have made more sense than LL, who’s clearly a Performer?\n\nWith artists being rushed through regardless of getting enough votes for the Performers category, you not only reduce these honors to a Consolation Prize and take away from people in arguably greater need of recognition, you also have to wonder what’s the point of voting? I mean, if the Hall will just induct whoever, not even respecting their own process, some voters naturally have to wonder “why bother?”\n\nNeil from Future Rock Legends has suggested having an artist of the Nominating Committee’s choosing honored, and that’s actually an idea worth contemplating. You can also, you know, simply induct more Performers and allow voters to pick more artists to honor. I’m sure that wouldn’t hurt. You could even have a Fan Vote selected inductee as some have suggested. It allows the public to feel engaged and provides the Hall with a headliner for a ceremony. There’s no reason why we have to choose between crowd pleasers and pioneers, both can coexist.\n\nSeeing as I don’t want to be all negative, I feel it’s only right for me to acknowledge the good points this year. So here they are….\n\nCounting additional categories, we have a total of thirteen inductees this year. This is the largest class we’ve had since 2012 (seventeen-six performers, the six backing groups being retroactively inducted alongside their frontmen, one non-performer, one Early Influence, and three Award For Musical Excellence recipients). Giving the massive backlog (which I plan to cover in depth in the future), a larger class is the best thing the Hall could do at this point. Whatever complaints I’ve had about the way this class was achieved, the scope is not among them.\n\nLiterally half the acts honored in the Performers involved women-3, the most since 1996. With the Go-Go’s, we finally have an all female band in the Hall, and five more women that can vote on future ballots.\n\nTina Turner is finally being honored for her solo career. The woman has been through pure hell, has touched innumerable lives, and she’s finally in as a solo artist.\n\nDitto for Carole King. Such an accomplished woman, so many classic songs, has enriched our lives both through her own work and through her contributions to other people’s career. And both she and Tina are still alive to enjoy their solo inductions.\n\nWe have three people joining the Clyde McPhatter Club (those who’ve been inducted two or more times), the most since 1997 (when David Crosby went in with CSN, Neil Young with Buffalo Springfield, and Stephen Stills with both). And two of them are women! A first for the Hall, and hopefully it will happen again in the future.\n\nWe also have the most racially diverse class since 2015, which had eight people of color. That is the same number we have this year, with three of the Performers featuring a person of color (two being black and one being biracial), and the Non-Performer, two of the Influences, and two of the Musical Excellence Award recipients all being black. With a larger class, that can potentially increase the likelihood of representation in future classes.\n\nWarts and all, this is still a very solid class and a step in the right direction for the Hall. The work isn’t done by any means, but there’s potential for things to get better.\n\nIt’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ballot season! So the ballot was announced on February 10, 2021 at 10:00 am. I previously made a predictions list back in September, and to recap, I predicted…\n\nJohn Sykes, the new Chairman of the Nominating Committee and former chairman, would have a noticeable impact.\n\nThere will be more women and people of color on the ballot this year.\n\nSixteen artists on the ballot.\n\nThere would a mixture of old and new (60s/70s vs 80s/90s).\n\nSo now, the ballot is officially out!\n\nThe ballot is…\n\nMary J Blige\n\nGenres: Hip Hop Soul, R&B/Soul\n\nKey Recordings: What’s The 411? (1992), My Life (1994), No More Drama (2001), The Breakthrough (2005), “Mighty River” (2017)\n\nEligible Since: 2018\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nFor our first nominee, we get singer-songwriter and contemporary R&B star Mary J Blige. The Queen of Hip Hop Soul herself, Blige reinvented and reinvigorated R&B music with hip hop production and arrangements in addition to broadening the representation of women and particularly black women in the typically male centric world of hip hop. To date, she has won nine Grammys, four American Music Awards, twelve Billboard Music Awards, six Soul Train Awards, six BET Awards, two World Music Awards, two Critics Choice Awards, and one VMA. And that’s on top of receiving ASCAP’s Voice of Music, Black Girls Rock!’s Icon Award, various awards and nominations for her contributions to the 2017 film Mudbound. She’s also the only person to win at least one Grammy in the R&B, hip hop, pop, and gospel categories as I’m typing this post.\n\nI’d seen other Hall Watchers predict Mary J. Blige, and while I didn’t have objection to her nomination, I still figured she’d be a long shot at best. Well, that shot fired. While I don’t feel she should be inducted before many artists who paved the way for her, but I digress. She’s a mega talent and more than worthy of her recognition and success. And her induction would provide the Hall with another woman and another person of color, and one who will be eligible to vote on all ballots moving forward.\n\nKate Bush\n\nGenres: Art Rock, Baroque Pop, Progressive Rock, Progressive Pop\n\nKey Recordings: The Kick Inside (1978), “Breathing” (1980), The Dreaming (1982), Hounds Of Love (1985), “Don’t Give Up” (1986; with Peter Gabriel), The Sensual World (1989)\n\nEligible Since: 2003\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2018\n\nKate Bush makes her return to the ballot after being nominated in 2018. Though her output has been relatively sparse, it’s nonetheless proven quite impactful. She is one of the first, if not the first, artists to use a headset with a built-in wireless mic as well as a major figure in combining music with dancing, both of which would later be adapted by the likes of Madonna (2008) and Peter Gabriel (2010 with Genesis;2014). She was also among the first artists to make prominent use of the Fairlight CMI, a pioneering digital workstation that is also credited with coining the term “sampling” in music. Just to list a few artists who’ve admired her and have taken inspiration from her-David Gilmour (1996 w Pink Floyd), Ellie Gould, Coldplay, Adele, Tegan and Sara, k.d. lang, Pat Benatar, Tori Amos, Björk, Stevie Nicks (1998 with Fleetwood Mac; 2019), Big Boi of OutKast fame, Suede, Steven Wilson, John Lydon (2006 with The Sex Pistols), Prince (2004), Robert Smith (2019 with The Cure), St. Vincent, Liz Phair, and so on and so forth.\n\nI did not predict Kate for this year’s ballot, but I did, funny enough, predict her for 2020. So I was just off by a year. That said, she is more than worthy of nomination and induction, and has a fairly decent shot at being inducted. And she is one more woman on the ballot this year, and thus one more female voter should she be inducted.\n\nDevo\n\nGenres: New Wave, Synthpop, Electronic Rock\n\nMembers: Bob “Bob 2” Casale†, Gerald Casale, Bob “Bob 1” Mothersbaugh, Mark Mothersbaugh, Alan Myers†\n\nKey Recordings: Q: Are We Not Men! A: We Are Devo! (1978), Duty Now For The Future (1979), Freedom of Choice (1980), “Through Being Cool” (1981)\n\nEligible Since: 2003\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2019\n\nFrom right out of the Hall’s home base of Cleveland, OH, we have Devo. Named for their theory of “de-evolution”, in which mankind has regressed rather than evolve, Devo came to fame with a mix of sci fi kitsch, sardonic satire and humor, and futuristic synthesizers. With records like their debut Q: Are We Not Men! A: We Are Devo! and hits such as “Whip It” and their reinvention of The Rolling Stones’ “Satisfaction”, Devo have left a mark on multiple artists such as LCD Soundsystem, Radiohead (2019), Soundgarden, They Might Be Giants, Rage Against The Machine, Sepultura, Nirvana (2014), Moby, Spoon, Weird Al, Clawhammer, A Perfect Circle, Fu Manchu, and so many more. In addition, members such as Mark Mothersbaugh and Bob Casale both established notable careers scoring film and television, with credits on Rugrats, Pee Wee’s Playhouse, several of Wes Anderson’s films, Happy Gilmore, Regular Show, House of Lies, and the 21 Jump Street films among others.\n\nThis marks Devo’s second nomination to date, and it’s a well earned nomination. Truthfully, I think it will take the right year and the right ballot for Devo to make the cut. Rather or not this year will be their’s remains to be seen, though Bob #2 and Alan Myers sadly won’t be here to enjoy it. Hopefully we won’t have to lose any more members before they’re honored.\n\nThe Foo Fighters\n\nGenres: Alternative Rock, Post-Grunge, Hard Rock\n\nMembers: Dave Grohl*, Taylor Hawkins, Rami Jaffee, Nate Mendel, Chris Shiflett, Pat Smear\n\nKey Recordings: Foo Fighters (1995), The Colour And The Shape (1997), There Is Nothing To Lose (1999), “All My Life” (2002), “The Best Of You” (2005), “The Pretender” (2007), Wasting Light (2011)\n\nFirst Eligible: 2021\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nNearly everybody figured that the Foo Fighters would be nominated on their first year of eligibility, and nearly everybody ended up being correct. The band that Dave Grohl formed in the wake of Nirvana’s demise, the Foo Fighters have consistently delivered a steady stream of hit singles and records over the years. They’re essentially the alternative equivalent of the Doobie Brothers, a good, solid, likable group that may not fully reinvent the wheel, but you can count on them as a constant.\n\nNaturally, I predicted the Foo Fighters for this year’s ballot, making them the first one of my predictions to come true. It does, however, look fairly iffy to put them on the ballot when their frontman is on the Nominating Committee. But then again, this is the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame. That’s sort of par for the course, isn’t it? No matter, the Foo Fighters are on the ballot. As far as representation, you have Pat Smear, who is of African-American, Native American, and Jewish descent, and Rami Jaffee, who is also of Jewish descent.\n\nThe Go-Gos\n\nGenre: New Wave, Pop Rock\n\nMembers: Charlotte Caffey, Belinda Carlisle, Gina Schlock, Kathy Valentine\n\nKey Recordings: Beauty And The Beat (1981), “Vacation” (1982), “Head Over Heels” (1984)\n\nEligible Since: 2006\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nThe buzz around the Go Go’s has been building for some time, their documentary has gotten a strong reception, so now we finally see them on the ballot. The first all-female, self-contained rock group to hit #1 on the Album Charts (and sadly they remain the only one), the Go-Go’s rose out of the Los Angeles punk scene to take America by the balls and deliver premier New Wave. “We Got The Beat” is among the Hall’s 500 Songs That Shaped Rock And Roll and has been used in God knows how much media over the years. They are still among the few acts to hit #1 with their debut, and doing so in the pre-SoundScan era, and their debut would end up putting I.R.S. Records on the map, paving the way for the likes of R.E.M. to break through.\n\nThis is the second prediction of mine to come true, and I’m extremely happy to see I was right about this one. Unfortunately, I didn’t really know that much about the Go Go’s’ career until recently, and I’m happy to have rectified. Certainly happy for the likes of Mary from the Hall Watchers podcast (and also the InductDennisWilson campaign) and Evelyn McDonnell, who’s been pushing for more women to be recognized by the Hall. And right here at the fifth act, we already have more women on the ballot than any other since 2015 (which also had seven women in total, with four coming from the Marvelletes and two from Chic).\n\nNeedless to say, their induction would provide the Hall with five more women being inducted and able to vote on future ballots. I will say I think their chances are actually pretty solid this year, this past year or so has really been their moment.\n\nFun Fact: Frontwoman Belinda Carlisle, under the name “Dottie Danger”, was a one time drummer for LA punk staples The Germs, which featured future Foo Fighter Pat Smear on guitar.\n\nIron Maiden\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal, NWOBHM\n\nMembers: Clive Burr†, Paul Di’Anno, Bruce Dickinson, Janick Gers, Steve Harris, Nicko McBrain, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, Dennis Stratton\n\nKey Recordings: Iron Maiden (1980), Killers (1981), The Number Of The Beast (1982), Peace of Mind (1983), Powerslave (1984), Live After Death (1985), Somewhere In Time (1986), Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son (1988), “Fear Of The Dark” (1992), Brave New World (1999)\n\nEligible Since: 2005\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nThis year’s ballot is up the Irons with Iron Maiden! Formed on Christmas Day of 1975, the band would rise to become leading figures of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal and become one of the most iconic metal bands of all time. Rather it be the bass work and songwriting of Steve Harris, the vocals and showmanship of Bruce Dickinson, the twin guitar attack of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith, or perhaps the most famous metal mascot in Eddie the Head. Their music is grand and epic in scale, their imagery (courtesy largely of Mr. Derek Riggs) helped shape the look of metal to this very day, and they continue to pack places all over the world. Plus their singer flies their plane, how cool is that?\n\nFor this year, I predicted that the likes of Tom Morello would be more strategic after all the hard rock and metal bands cancelled each other out last year. I also predicted that regardless of rather or not they want it that way, they’ll likely hold off on the likes of Priest or Motörhead and let Maiden have their turn on the ballot. It appears I was correct on both accounts, and seeing as Maiden performed extremely well in the Fan Kiosks, I figured their appearance on the ballot would be inevitable.\n\nCompared to Priest or Motörhead, I’d say Maiden has a better shot of induction. Regardless of how right or wrong it is, Maiden has more mainstream cache, will sell more tickets to a ceremony, and their performance will look good for an HBO broadcast. I am well aware that Bruce Dickinson had talked about the Hall being “an utter and complete load of bullocks”, and how music is dead once it’s put in a museum. On one hand, I’ve seen too many talk like this then act all happy once they’re in (<cough>Def Leppard<cough>), but then again the band hasn’t acknowledged the nomination so far on their social media. Just have to wait and see.\n\nIt’s also a pleasant surprise to see Dennis Stratton, Adrian’s predecessor who played on the debut, being included. So let’s move onto the next act.\n\nJay-Z\n\nGenre: Hip Hop, Mafioso Hip Hop\n\nKey Recordings: Reasonable Doubt (1996), In My Lifetime Vol. 1 (1997), “Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)” (1998),”Big Pimpin” (1999), The Blueprint (2001), The Black Album (2003), “Empire State Of Mind” (2009; featuring Alicia Keys), Magna Carta Holy Grail (2013), 4:44 (2017)\n\nEligible Since: 2021\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nDebuting as part of Big Daddy Kane’s crew, Jay-Z would climb his way to the big time with a stark lyrical viewpoint and a meticulous flow, backed by some of the top producers in hip hop. After Biggie’s death, the throne of East Coast hip hop was left up for grabs, and it would be a former drug dealer that would ultimately succeed The Notorious B.I.G. as King of The East Coast. Through his career, Jay-Z has helped a launching pad for many more notable artists and producers such as The Neptunes, Kanye West, Memphis Bleek, Rihanna, Ne-Yo, Just Blaze, the solo career of future wife Beyoncé, and many more. With 22 Grammies, 6 Billboard Music Awards, 17 BET Hip Hop Awards, 7 BET Awards, 7 MTV Music Video Awards, nearly forty ASCAP awards, becoming the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2017, and his album The Blueprint being inducted into The National Recording Registry in 2019, Jay-Z is among the most critically acclaimed artists in hip hop and popular music as a whole. He’s also among the best selling artists of all time at 50 million albums and 75 million singles sold worldwide, in addition to having the most #1 albums of any artist on the Billboard 200 at 14.\n\nAnd this is without going into his entrepreneurial skills-founder of his label Rock-A-Fella through which he’d release his debut and several other releases, CEO of Def Jam, founder of full-service agency Roc Nation, and running the streaming service Tidal. Beyond music, he’s also founded clothing retailer Rocawear and luxury sports bar chain The 40/40 Club, both becoming multi-million dollar corporations. With all of this in addition to his involvement in other major corporations and franchises such as Budweiser and Brooklyn Nets, he’s set himself up as the rare artist with to succeed in both sides of the music business. In 2019, Jay-Z became the first hip hop billionaire and is currently the fifth wealthiest African American of all time as well as the wealthiest American musician.\n\nOther than The Foo Fighters, Jay-Z was the one other artist that I and practically everybody else felt completely secure in predicting for the ballot. And frankly, I and most others would be more surprised if he’s not inducted.\n\nFun Fact: For another connection between nominees, Jay-Z’s debut Reasonable Doubt opens with a duet between Jay-Z and Mary J Blige entitled “Can’t Knock The Hustle”.\n\nChaka Khan\n\nGenres: R&B/Soul, Funk, Disco, Pop, Jazz, Gospel\n\nKey Recordings: “Tell Me Something Good” (1974; with Rufus), Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan (1975; with Rufus), Ask Rufus (1977; with Rufus), “I’m Every Woman” (1978), Masterjam (1979; with Rufus), Chaka Khan (1982), “Ain’t Nobody” (1983; with Chaka Khan), I Feel For You (1984), ck (1988)\n\nEligible Since: 2004\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2012 (with Rufus), 2016, 2017, 2018 (with Rufus), 2019 (with Rufus), 2020 (with Rufus)\n\nAllow Mr. Melle Mel take it away…\n\nThe Queen of Funk herself, from fronting Rufus to a successful career over four plus decades. Chaka Khan has taken the bull by the horns, tackling everything from seventies funk to electro pop, along with the odd dabble in jazz music. To date, Khan has collaborated with the likes of Quincy Jones (2013 Ahmet Ertegun Award recipient), Joni Mitchell (1997), The Gap Band, Stanley Clarke, Chicago (2016), Rick James, Grandmaster Melle Mel (2007 with Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five), Stevie Wonder (1989), Prince (2004), Ray Charles (1986), Ry Cooder, De La Soul, and many more.\n\nTo date, Khan has won ten Grammies, has sold an estimated 70 million records worldwide, and has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. With her hit cover of Prince’s “I Feel For You”, she is the first R&B star to have a crossover hit featuring a rapper, a trend that would eventually become common place in popular music. Khan has also influenced and/or been covered/sampled by Cyndi Lauper, Janet Jackson (2019), Anita Baker, Whitney Houston (with Khan’s hit “Clouds” being one of Houston’s earliest appearance on record) (2020), Macy Gray, Mary J Blige, Faith Evans, Sam Smith, Teena Marie, Brandy, En Vogue, Pitbull, Cher, Madonna (2008), Stardust, Kanye West, Charlie Puth, Eminem, DJ Rashed, the aforementioned Prince, Barracuda, Aretha Franklin (1987), Common, 2Pac (2017), Missy Elliott, and many more.\n\nChaka Khan has become another repeat nominee akin to The Stooges or Chic, either appearing with her band Rufus or on her own. This year, she appears as a solo artist, bringing us up to eight women now (equaling 2013’s ballot). As far as her chances of induction this year, she has a better than some others, not as good as others. She has maybe 50-50 odds at best.\n\nFun Fact: Chaka Khan has previously worked with fellow nominee Mary J. Blige, collaborating on “Disrespectful” off Khan’s 2007 effort Funk This.\n\nCarole King*\n\nGenre: Singer-Songwriter, Pop\n\nKey Recordings: Tapestry (1971), “Jazzman” (1974), “Nightingale” (1975)\n\nEligible Since: 1986\n\nPreviously Nominated: 1989\n\nNow we see the great Carole King on the ballot. After establishing herself as a successful writer in the Brill Building, often in conjunction with ex-husband Gerry Goffin, Carole would soon establish herself as an accomplished performer. With her sophomore effort Tapestry, Carole launched herself as a premier singer-songwriter, paving the way for many more in the process such as James Taylor (2000) and Tori Amos. Though subsequent efforts never achieved the same sales or acclaim, King would continue producing a solid string of hits, all while seeing her songs covered or sampled by the likes of the Carpenters, Rod Stewart (1994; 2012 with Small Faces/Faces), Aretha Franklin (1987), Mickey Dolenz of The Monkees, The Isley Brothers (1992), The Stylistics, Gloria Estefan, The Supremes (1988), Isaac Hayes (2002), Woody Herman, Johnny Mathis, Michael Jackson (1997 with The Jackson Five; 2001), The Flaming Lips, Wu Tang Clan, Al Green (1995), Dusty Springfield (1999), Donny Hathaway, LaBelle, Paul Gilbert, Elton John (1994), all among many others.\n\nEstimated to have sold 75 million worldwide, Tapestry held the record for most weeks at #1 by a female artist for over twenty years and is currently in the Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry. She has won four Grammies in addition to receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, Kennedy Center Honors, Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She’s also been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Long Island Music Hall of Fame, and the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame as a Non-Performer for her work with Gerry Goffin.\n\nNaturally, Carole could potentially be the second or third woman to be inducted twice, the second person to be inducted in more than one category, and the first woman to be inducted in more than one category. She does have a solid shot, though not a guaranteed one.\n\nFela Kuti†\n\nGenre: Afrobeat, Highlife\n\nKey Recordings: Fela’s London Scene (1971), Why Black Men Dey Suffer (1971), Gentleman (1973), Confusion (1975), Expensive Shit (1975), Zombie (1977)\n\nEligible Since: 1997\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nWow, Fela Kuti is on the ballot. Granted, one of the committee members mentioned him last year, Questlove brought him up at one point. But still, I was stunned like everybody else to see him appear on the ballot.\n\nMany people don’t know him off the top of their heads, and they really should look into the man’s life and career. To recap, Fela Kuti was…\n\nThe son of Nigerian women’s liberation activist Fummilayo Ransome-Kuti and educationist and clergyman Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, the first President of the Nigeria Union of Teachers.\n\nStudied classical music in London, where he would become exposed to various forms of Western music.\n\nThe pioneer of Afrobeat music that melded traditional Yoruba music with that of blues, jazz, and funk.\n\nA talented multi-instrumentalist who was proficient on saxophone, piano, guitar, trumpet, and drums.\n\nA highly energetic live performer whose shows were known as the “Underground Spiritual Game”, and you better believe it was a spiritual event, just ask Mr. Bootsy Collins (1997). They didn’t call Mr. Kuti the African James Brown for nothing.\n\nA prominent collaborator of late Cream drummer Ginger Baker (1993) during Baker’s post Cream career.\n\nAn outspoken voice against the rampant corruption within his native Nigeria’s government.\n\nContinued to fight the corruption and oppression in Nigeria even as he was constantly beaten, arrested, imprisoned, threatened, and his livelihood constantly left on the ropes.\n\nSet up his own communal compound which he declared the independent Kalakuta Republic.\n\nWas married to 27 women. At once.\n\nDelivered political columns in the advertising space of various daily and weekly newspapers, bypassing the editorial censorship of Nigeria’s state controlled media. Titled “Chief Priest Say”, these discussed the role of cultural hegemony in the subjugation of Africans as well as the exploitative nature of Christianity and Islam, as well as that of multinational corporations. Also prominent were deconstructions of Western medicine, sex, pollution, and poverty.\n\nAn advocate of Pan-Africanism, which seeks to encourage and strengthen bonds between all ethnic groups of African descent, indigenous or otherwise.\n\nPassionately preached peace and unity among Africans as well as committing to their native religion and culture.\n\nWas highly critical of many American policies and how Africa was and is spoken of as lesser and as “Third World”.\n\nIn 1979, he founded the political party Movement Of The People and ran for presidency. He didn’t win, though.\n\nUpon his passing in 1997 due to complications from AIDS, over one million Nigerians attended his funeral.\n\nHow the man’s life has not been made into some award winning film, I don’t know. As far as the music goes, his sound has not only spawned a whole genre, but has been an inspiration to so many musicians across all walks of life-Brian Eno (2019 with Roxy Music), Talking Heads (2002), James Brown himself (1986), the aforementioned Bootsy Collins (1997 with Parliament-Funkadelic) and Ginger Baker, Blur frontman and Gorillaz co-founder Damon Albarn, Beyoncé, The Roots, Parliament-Funkadelic (1997), Common, African Head Charge, Gil Scott-Heron, Peter Gabriel (2010 with Genesis; 2014), D’Angelo, Missy Elliott, Nas, Mos Def, Paul McCartney (1988 with The Beatles; 1997), Niles Rodgers (Musical Excellence Award Recipient in 2017), and of course son Fema, who has continued his father’s legacy. And that’s just a few.\n\nTo see Fela on the ballot is just incredible and could really broaden the horizons of the Hall moving forward. As I’m writing this, Fela is leading the Fan Vote with most of his votes coming from Africa, a continent that you don’t normally think of as being part of this conversation.\n\nAs far as his chances, I actually think he could have a pretty good shot at being inducted, though he’s not necessarily guaranteed.\n\nLL Cool J\n\nGenre: Hip Hop\n\nKey Recordings: Radio (1985), Bigger And Deffer (1987), Mama Said Knock You Out (1990)\n\nEligible Since: 2010\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2010, 2011, 2014, 2018, 2019\n\nLL Cool J is back, once again. With “I Need A Beat” and its parent album Radio, LL Cool J became one of hip hop’s earliest mainstream successes alongside Kurtis Blow and 2009 inductees Run DMC. From there, he’d become hip hop’s first solo superstar, becoming the first rapper to appear on American Bandstand and setting the path for what eventually became the norm in the genre. His early efforts as produced by Rick Rubin took the genre out of the more disco and funk base and into a harder street sensibility as well as paving the way for rap rock. While he might be better known now from CSI, hosting the Grammies, or his duet with Brad Paisley that wound up living up to its title, make no mistake whatsoever. Mama said knock you out, and she meant it. Hip hop, rock and roll, and popular music as a whole would be extremely different without LL Cool J’s contributions.\n\nAs of now, LL Cool J has won two Grammies, one MTV Music Video Award as well as Lifetime Achievement Award, four NAACP Image Awards, two Soul Train Music Awards, and their own Lifetime Achievement Award. He was Billboard‘s Top Rap Singles Artist in 1991, has been inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame, and has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an Honorary Doctor of Arts from Northeastern University, and was the first hip hop artist to be receive a Kennedy Center Honor.\n\nThis now makes six nominations for LL Cool J, and we really shouldn’t still be talking about him. This also marks the sixth ballot to have two hip hop artists after 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. In the case of 2008, 2011, and 2014, the two cancelled each other out, and in the remaining classes, just one was inducted. I can’t help but feel that’s going to be the case with this ballot.\n\nThe New York Dolls\n\nGenre: Proto-Punk, Glam Rock, Rock And Roll\n\nMembers: David Johansson, Arthur “Killer” Kane†, Billy Murcia†, Jerry Nolan†, Sylvain Sylvain†, Johnny Thunders†\n\nKey Recordings: The New York Dolls (1973), Too Much Too Soon (1974)\n\nEligible Since: 1998\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2001\n\nLet us tackle our personality crisis with the New York Dolls. Coming out of the Big Rotten Apple, the Dolls gained notoriety for their trashy glam look, rambunctious take on rock and roll, and their chaotic and hedonistic lifestyles. As one of the Big Three/Four of Proto-Punk, they are naturally a forerunner to punk rock in addition to alternative, hard rock, heavy metal, and glam metal.\n\nWith a Martin Scorsese documentary on the way, MC5’s struggles with the voters, and the recent passing of Sylvain Sylvain, I just knew they’d show up on the ballot. And I turned out to be right on the money, making this my fifth prediction to come true.\n\nIt’s pretty awesome to see the Dolls actually on the ballot for the first time in twenty years, and I’m pleasantly surprised to see original drummer Billy Murcia appear on the ballot despite not actually appearing on the debut (though he was apart of its development and can be heard on Lipstick Killers). It’s also bittersweet since now, only David Johansen will be there to enjoy it. Billy, Jerry, and Johnny had all already died when the New York Dolls were first eligible, but there’s no reason that Sylvain or Killer Kane shouldn’t have been able to see the band get inducted.\n\nInduct people while they’re alive is what I’m saying.\n\nRage Against The Machine\n\nGenre: Rap Metal, Funk Metal, Alternative Metal, Rap Rock\n\nMembers: Tim Cummerford. Zach de la Rocha, Tom Morello, Brad Wilk\n\nKey Recordings: Rage Against The Machine (1992), Evil Empire (1996), Battle Of Los Angeles (2000)\n\nEligible Since: 2017\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2017, 2018\n\nFor a politically and socially tumultuous time in our country, who better to appear on the ballot than Rage Against The Machine? Bursting into the early nineties scene with their self-titled debut, Rage achieved notoriety with their politically outspoken lyrics, social activism, and a sonic Molotov cocktail of hard rock, metal, punk, and hip hop. Particularly of note was guitarist Tom Morello’s unconventional approach, acting not so much as a lead guitarist but a DJ, creating an assaultive sonic soundscape of war and revolution. To date, Rage has sold 16 million records worldwide in addition to winning two Grammies, being selected as NME’s Heroes Of The Year in 2010, their Christmas #1 and Free Concert being named that year’s Event of The Year by the Classic Rock Roll of Honours Award, and being inducted into Kerrang!‘s Hall Of Fame in 2008. The band has proven to be a crucial influence on the development of rap metal and nu metal (which has been…a mixed blessing, admittedly). This is in top of Tom Morello’s collaborations with the likes of Primus, Bruce Springsteen (1999), Shooter Jennings, Run DMC (2009), Joe Strummer (2003 with The Clash), Johnny Cash (1992), and members of Alice In Chains, Tool, and Jane’s Addiction. And of course, most of the members played with Chris Cornell in Audioslave as well as Chuck D (2013 with Public Enemy) in Prophets of Rage, not to mention Brad Wilk playing with Black Sabbath (2006).\n\nSeeing as Tom Morello is on the Nom Com, I doubt anybody is really that shocked to see them back on the ballot. Giving who they’re up against, I can’t say they’re guaranteed to be inducted. However, with the year we’ve had and three being the magic number, I also can’t rule them out entirely. And as far as representation goes, de la Rocha is of Mexican-American, African, and Jewish descent while Morello is of Kenyan descent on his father’s side.\n\nTodd Rundgren\n\nGenre: Rock, Pop, Progressive Rock, Art Rock, Experimental Rock, Soft Rock, New Wave, Electronica, Blue-Eyed Soul, Power Pop\n\nKey Recordings: Runt. The Ballad Of Todd Rundgren (1971), Something/Anything? (1972), A Wizard, A True Star (1973), Todd (1974), Hermit Of Mink Follow (1978), “Bang The Drum All Day” (1982), A Capella (1985)\n\nEligible Since: 1996\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2019, 2020, 2021\n\nTodd Rundgren, the rock and roll maverick himself, gets his third nomination in a row. I’ve said before that if and when Todd gets inducted, it will be for the Award For Musical Excellence. I still stand by that, and truthfully, a catch-all award might actually be appropriate in Todd’s case.\n\nFrom Top 40 hits such as “I Saw The Light” and “Hello, It’s Me” to progressive explorations on records such as Wizard and with his band Utopia, cheeky pop with “Bang The Drum All Day” to an album made up entirely of vocals both natural and electronically enhanced (an approach later repeated by the likes of Bjork and Mike Patton), Todd has practically done it all. And that’s without all else he has done. He’s played in bands with the likes of various members of 2018 inductees The Cars and 1988 inductee and fellow Musical Excellence Award recipient Ringo Starr. He’s made many technical innovations-organizing the first interactive television concert in 1978, designing the first color graphics tablet in 1980, releasing the first interactive album in 1994, releasing one of the first music videos aired on MTV, creating one of the first computer paint programs, co-developing the screensaver system Flowfazer, being an early adopter of the Video Toaster system that provided quality film editing for affordable prices (in turn helping propel indie filmmaking), and being among the first major artists to utilize internet distribution.\n\nAnd of course, being among the first to make their name as both an artist and as a producer. To date, Todd had produced or engineered fellow nominees The New York Dolls, The Band (1994), Cheap Trick (2016), Hall & Oates (2014), Sparks, Badfinger, Patti Smith Group (2007 for Patti at least), Bad Religion, The Tubes, Felix Cavaliere (1997 with The (Young) Rascals), and of course Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell. Seriously, a big, fat, ugly dude called Meat Loaf performed Broadway rock. Who could possibly make that into a blockbuster record, one of the biggest selling of all time to this day? Todd fucking Rundgren can!\n\nNeedless to say, Todd is a renaissance man of many talents and accomplishments. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, if and when Todd goes in, the Award For Musical Excellence is almost certainly how it will happen. And you know what? I’m good with that, a catch all award might be the only one that could do Todd justice. Ditto for Brian Eno. No matter, Todd is another prediction of mine that came true, giving me six at the moment.\n\nI know Todd, like Iron Maiden, has talked about how he doesn’t care about the Hall, getting inducted, anything of that nature, but giving how much he’s talked about not caring about the award, he probably does. I don’t know, maybe it’s the fact that almost nobody who says that ever sticks by it upon induction. Bowie, Thom Yorke, and the Sex Pistols,, but that’s really it.\n\nTina Turner*\n\nGenres: R&B/Soul, Rock, Pop, Rock And Roll\n\nKey Recordings: “Acid Queen” (1975),Private Dancer(1984), “We Don’t Need Another Hero” (1985), “The Best” (1986), “I Don’tWanna Fight” (1993)\n\nEligible Since: 1998\n\nFirst Nomination\n\nThe Queen Of Rock n Roll herself, Tina Turner is…Tina Turner. What can you really say? Voice and face of one of late sixties and seventies soul’s most dynamic acts in Ike and Tina Turner, dynamite voice and performer, played the Acid Queen in The Who (1990)’s Tommy, got out of an abusive marriage and gradually rebuilt her life and career, becoming a solo superstar who’s life has been turned into a hit movie and a musical. And if somebody dislikes Tina, you should dislike them. Seriously, disown anybody who disses Tina Turner.\n\nLike most, I was truly shocked to find out she wasn’t in as a solo artist, and I always figured that if and when we start seeing more women on the ballot, Tina would be there right away. I predicted her this year and, if my memory is correct, 2020, and she is my seventh prediction to come true. And her presence now brings us up to the 2010 ballot, which had a total of ten women (give or take) present thanks to the Chantels.\n\nDionne Warwick\n\nGenres: R&B/Soul, Pop, Gospel, Easy Listening\n\nKey Recordings: “Walk On By” (1964), “Alfie” (1966), The Windows Of The World (1967), “Fo You Know The Way To San José” (1968), “I’ll Never Fall In Love Again” (1969), “I’ll Never Love This Way Again” (1979), “Heartbreaker” (1982)\n\nEligible Since: 1987\n\nLast but not least, Dionne Warwick. A living legend just like Tina, one of the great pop divas, one of the most charted female singers with 56 singles making the Hot 100 between 1962 and 1998, and one of the most famous artists behind the mic for Burt Bacharach and Hal David’s compositions. To date, she has influenced or been covered/sampled by Isaac Hayes (2002), Laura Nyro (2012), Anita Baker, Luther Vandross, Michael Jackson (1997 with The Jackson Five; 2001), The Bee Gees (1997), Elton John (1994), The Spinners, Alicia Keys, Cyndi Lauper, Mariah Carey, The Stylistics, Carpenters, Chic, Donna Summer (2013), Usher, Mos Def, Dusty Springfield (1999), Linda Ronstadt (2014), Martha & The Vandellas (1995), and of course her cousin Whitney Houston (2020), and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nDionne is another name that surprised me, but it also makes total sense. She’s been doing really well for herself lately, particularly in her profile on social media, plus her cousin Whitney was inducted last year. So it’s been a good period for her, and it would be cool to see her honored. Rather or not she will be, I’m not as sure. But I have no complaints about her being on the ballot. And with her presence, we have now surpassed the number of women that were on the 2010 ballot.\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTS\n\nFrom my predictions list, I correctly predicted seven artists on the ballot and correctly predicted the total number of nominated acts. I am also happy to see I was correct in predicting more women and people of color on the ballot. This is the most women we’ve had on the ballot in the Hall’s history, currently standing at seven female acts on the ballot and eleven women overall. We see the first all-female band to appear on the ballot, and the first all-female group to appear since The Marvelettes in 2015. In addition, we have ten people of color on the ballot, the most we’ve had since\n\nI know John Sykes mentioned wanting to move forward from the sixties and seventies. At first glance, this appears to be the case. Certainly not as many classic rock staples on the ballot as in previous years other than Todd. That said, Dionne goes back to the sixties. And from the 70s, you have Todd, Tina, the Dolls, Carole, Chaka, Fela, and Devo to a lesser extent. So the balance between 60s/70s and 80s/90s is there as I predicted.\n\nCompared to the past two years where I got nine or ten acts right, this year only gives me seven. Not anything to complain about, and it’s actually kind of nice to not get as many right. Maybe they won’t be quite as stale going forward.\n\nHowever, while I do give Sykes credit for addressing the problem of representation, there is still a way to go as far as making the Hall the best it can be and as far as building trust between the Hall and the public. For one thing, address any potential conflict of interest such as having two Nom Com members with their band on the ballot.\n\nOverall though, the ballot is quite promising, and while I hope several of the pioneers won’t be completely abandoned, I do look forward to seeing where things will go from here on out.\n\nThat’s my thoughts on this year’s ballot, and I apologize for the delay."
