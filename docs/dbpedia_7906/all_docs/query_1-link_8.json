        "text": "In article <3n64ta$q...@necco.harvard.edu> j...@endor.harvard.edu ( ghost ) writes:\n\n>Here's a couple much-touted locals:\n\n>\n\n>Lynn Saner\n\n>Maria Sangiolo\n\n>\n\n>both utter dreck, for vastly differing reasons.\n\n>Saner is a master of inanity, with tunes to match.\n\n>Sangiolo is cluelessly pitiful most of the time.\n\n>Too long to go into before lunch. Except to emphasize that I'm talking\n\n>bad writing here, not \"lacking in prettiness of voice\".\n\nNow for the exposition part:\n\nLynn Saner:\n\nMid-range alto voice. Very smooth, sophisticated, but not unctuous;\n\njazz-lite \"vocalizations\" at the ends of some cuts, but not to the point of\n\ncomplete obnoxiousness.\n\nHas gotten tons of praise, justly deserved, at putting out a very\n\n\"profesional-sounding\" self-produced album.\n\nThe reviews imply \"on a very small budget\"; from Saner's on-air interview\n\ncomments about her own life-style (huge lawn-tent wedding, years in the\n\nplanning) & her day-job before she quit it (something at the Harvard Business\n\nSchool, where even the pencil-sharpeners get fairly high-status pay; else it\n\nwould reflect poorly on their high-status bosses. This isn't rumor, its fact,\n\n& a matter of public record. The salaries posted for identical jobs in\n\ndifferent Harvard departments are not identical salaries) I have my doubts as\n\nto the smallness of it, but could be wrong about this.\n\nStill, you can't automatically dismiss the s/ser because they're rich,\n\nor have married rich; Leonard Cohen is the heir to a typewriter fortune.\n\nYou have his word that his mother made him suitably neurotic for his job.\n\nGram Parsons was some kind of millionaire, albeit with a stepfather right\n\nout of extreme Southern Gothic central casting.\n\nCarly Simon (hardly in their class, but no slouch) is the heir of a\n\npublishing dynasty. Maybe if her family had tortured her she'd be in\n\ntheir class?\n\nBeth MacIntosh, hardly in anybody's class, but the author of at least one\n\nmemorable song \"Memories of Hickory Lane\", can afford (she says in on-air\n\ninterviews) to *fly* to all her widely-seperated western shows, but seems to\n\nthink her reason, rather than that she *can* afford it, is because\n\n\"its lonely to drive long distances alone\". She's also a complete &\n\ntotal air-head on every subject imaginable (on-air interviews). Nevertheless,\n\nthere's that one memorable song.\n\nNow to Saner's songs, at least the ones I've heard that I can remember,\n\nnot that I necessarily want to:\n\n\"An ode to chocolate\".\n\nDecent song. I haven't heard it in months, & can't remember it, though.\n\nLiked it OK on hearing it.\n\nI can, however, remember much of Jeannie Stahl's (original or co-written?\n\nI forget) ode to chocolate after not hearing it for about 8 years,\n\nso it would win the cut as \"better chocolate ode\".\n\nOdes to chocolate do seem to bring out the best in ss-ers.\n\n\"One Wore Blue And One Wore Grey\"\n\nThe trad ballad about 2 brothers or friends who wind up fighting on\n\ndiff sides in the Civil War. Nice but not spectular. I wonder about\n\nthe reason for its inclusion on the album, but not enough to buy\n\nthe album to find out.\n\n\"A Child Once\"\n\nNow we get to the bad stuff. Really, really bad stuff.\n\nThe title cut.\n\nRepeating phrase-packet__you wouldn't call it a chorus__\n\nabout some unfortunate somebody:\n\n\"He was a child once\n\nI was a child once\n\nYou were a child once\n\nWe all were children once\n\nHe was a child once\n\nA child once\"\n\nI may be paraphrasing a little; I wouldn't want to ever have to hear\n\nthis song again to find out.\n\nSwoopy circular musical pattern__you wouldn't call it a tune__\n\nthat noodles around for while, then comes back to the point where\n\nshe can repeat this profound-to-Saner phrase-packet.\n\nAnd comes back.\n\nAnd comes back.\n\nAnd...\n\nPseudo-jazzy instrumental surroundings, very cleanly executed,\n\nthat can't disguise that this song doesn't *have* a tune.\n\nNeither does it have enough going in the way of structure for the\n\nmusicians to develop whatever jazz musicians like to have available\n\nto develop, though they try very gamely to disguise that.\n\nDo I care that Lynn Saner, or anyone else, by the time I get through\n\nhearing this dreck, was a child once, or is an adult now, or was ever\n\nborn? No. I wonder instead \"is there any good music left in the world?\"\n\nIf Saner were Black, they'd be playing this on the Quiet Storm\n\n(which *has* improved with change of head-DJ/programmer, but not by that much).\n\nIs this the best she has to offer? The Chocolate song & the Civil War song\n\nare better by far. But it *is* the title cut. Someone must\n\nthink so.\n\nThe album has a picture of Childe Lynn on the *cover*. Not the back, the\n\ncover. I don't *care* what Lynn looks like as a child; I want to know what\n\nLynn looks like as an adult, so, as an adult, I can avoid any\n\nsinging-thing where I see her coming.\n\nIf you've already got a huge following (Iris DeMent, 2nd album;\n\nJoan Baez, Baptism album; others, probably) you can put your baby pictures\n\ndiscretely on them somewhere it you really want to; your huge, somewhat\n\ncurious following will probably think it endearing. I find Saner's cover\n\nhighly pretentious.\n\nAnother song:\n\n\"The Standing In My Condo Being Indecisive Blues\"\n\nOK, that's not the title; so what.\n\nThis one has more of a tune, though I can't remember it.\n\nStandard mellow, not-the-real-blues blues tune, but at least listenable.\n\nHowever, the lyrics are\n\n\"I'm standing in my living room, being indecisive, I don't know what to\n\ndo, I don't know what to do.\"\n\nOk, those are not the real lyrics, but they're damn close.\n\nI heard a couple verses & choruses of this at work, had to go down the hall\n\non an errand, was gone about 5 minutes, came back, & she was still singing\n\nthe same damn thing. Obviously, not much had happened while I was gone.\n\nIts a *looooong* song. Or maybe it just felt like one.\n\nShe explained what the song was about in a 3-song segment she got at a\n\nrecent \"women songwriters\" showcase (so I do now know what she looks like,\n\nsort of):\n\nIts about after waiting for many years for someone to ask her\n\nto move in with them, being asked to move in with them, & being indecisive\n\nabout her response\n\nI didn't actually catch this from a casual listen to the song, so I guess its\n\nuseful information.\n\nAt least, I *think* the song I heard in the concert was the song from the\n\nalbum. With something this boring its hard to remember enough to be able\n\nto tell.\n\nI don't care about either of the people in this song. I don't have an\n\nopinion other than \"why are you boring me with this?\". Shouldn't a song\n\nlike this do *something* to you emotionally, especially a blues song?\n\nI don't have any empathy for either of the characters, or much patience\n\neither.\n\nJoni Mitchell, on the other hand, can write songs about the kind of people\n\nI actively despise, herself being one of the people, & have me completely\n\nsympathetic by a few lines in. Brilliant lyrics, amazing, complicated but\n\ncompletely memorable tunes.\n\nYou'd wish some of these new singer/songwriters would have *some* models.\n\nI'd be curious to know what they listen to when they're not\n\nsinger/songwriting. But not that curious.\n\nThere are other songs on Saner's album, but I can't remember anything about\n\nthem except \"more jazz-lite, no tunes to speak of on many or most of them, more\n\nself-indulgence\". Just as well.\n\nSaner, I hope obviously, has been chosen as the example of\n\n\"songs you should be singing to your analyst, backed by lame music\",\n\nexcept that this stuff is also so lame lyrically that, so as not to antagonize\n\nher analyst, she should be singing it to her wallpaper. Not to me.\n\nThis stuff is not something that would give you hives or a stomach ache\n\non 1st hearing, though it might if someone threatened to play it after you\n\nalready got familiar with it, to the extent that this is possible for\n\nsomething so unmemorable; its most annoying for all the space it takes up that\n\ncould be used to play something brilliant.\n\nSaner has terrific poise, stage presence, etc, important to know for those\n\nwho find that sort of thing important; everything but terrific\n\nmaterial.\n\nIn article <3n8g5i$b...@ixnews4.ix.netcom.com> rfr...@ix.netcom.com (Robert Franke) writes:\n\n>Forgive me for not wanting to reprint J...@endor.harvard.edu's attempted\n\n>artistic assassination of Lynn Saner: you can look for it if you like.\n\n>In JMF's defense, he was dared to write such a piece, and he did\n\n>qualify some sections of it as referring to his own taste. That's all\n\n>the defense he gets from me. I find it both interesting and abhorrent\n\n>that, with all the mediocrity out there, he picks local developing\n\n>artists and not established industry people for his \"analysis\". I have\n\n>to go to a recording session at the moment (time flies when you're\n\n>pissed off), but for the moment, and for the record, let me say that I\n\n>have had the honor to have included Lynn Saner in one of my songwriting\n\n>classes, and she's one of the most brilliant artists I've ever worked\n\n>with. I hate mediocre songwriting, and Lynn is nowhere near mediocre.\n\n>There are lots of other issues here, and I'll get back to some of them.\n\nI don't *listen* to enough mainstream/established people whom I find\n\nboring & irrelevant as they tend to appear on stations that play music I\n\ndon't like. \"Local developing artists\" that I don't like get hyped to death\n\non stations that play them intersconced with music I *do* like; it makes\n\nit hard to avoid them.\n\nI find Saner *very* boring, for the reasons I listed.\n\nShe also has some very rudimentary skills at composition & lyric writing\n\nthat *aren't* being developed as far as I can tell; perhaps if she had\n\nless stage presence, voice & general self-assurance she'd have to have\n\nbetter songs?\n\nI think she has everyone bowled over by the \"force of personality\" thing;\n\nher *better* material (except for the chocolate song, which I like)\n\nis material that is rendered vaguely tolerable only for as long as she's\n\non stage. It does not hold up on record.\n\nKnock some more-famous people (besides Werner, who goes without saying)?\n\nPrism, Patty Larkin & (circa 1972-6)\n\nPeople should look up recordings, if there were any, by an entity known\n\nas \"Patty Larkin & Prism\", which Patty (it *is* the same Patty, believe it\n\nor not) has pretty-much disowned. Larkin was *at least* as horrible back\n\nthen as Saner is now, for much the same reasons musically (except that,\n\nit being the early 70s, her lyrics went on-&-on about mystic crystal\n\nrevelations & such rather than we-think-we're-sophisticated relationships.\n\nI was almost unwilling to listen to anything by Larkin after being\n\nsubjected to this stuff as opening act time & again way back when;\n\nThen she came out with\n\n\"Back In Your Arms\"\n\n& progressed to such things as\n\n\"It Was Your Dream (but its my life now)\", probably her best song yet\n\nI think her latest stuff is a misguided attempt to be trendy & hip;\n\nif Richard Thompson can't get richer & more famous being Richard Thompson,\n\nwhy should a pale stylistic-imitation of his throwaway filler succeed?\n\nIt could happen, though.\n\nAnd Larkin can still write stuff like\n\n\"Who Holds Your Hand (when you're alone)\"\n\n& the title cut of\n\n\"Angels Running\",\n\nwhich I *think* I like a lot, but its so depressing that\n\nit never gets enough airplay for me to tell\n\nSo if Larkin, who had pretty much the same incapacitating attributes as\n\nSaner when she started out, can improve so much, is there hope for Saner?\n\nI think all this discussion does is highlight the pitfalls of writing\n\ngroups.\n\nTo bad to have Mr. Franke mad at me, as I like his writing very much\n\n(even if Jesus does tend to show up in the final verses & save everybody).\n\nBut why do people think this kind of thing can be taught in the 1st place??\n\nIt can be polished, & in some cases obviously polished to show off\n\ndispleasing (to me) grains, but taught?\n\nj...@endor.harvard.edu (ghost) writes:\n\n>And Larkin can still write stuff like\n\n>\"Who Holds Your Hand (when you're alone)\"\n\n>& the title cut of\n\n>\"Angels Running\",\n\n>which I *think* I like a lot, but its so depressing that\n\n>it never gets enough airplay for me to tell\n\n>So if Larkin, who had pretty much the same incapacitating attributes as\n\n>Saner when she started out, can improve so much, is there hope for Saner?\n\n>I think all this discussion does is highlight the pitfalls of writing\n\n>groups.\n\nThis discussion hasn't touched on writing groups at all. I'll be happy to\n\ntouch on what goes on in mine, but first I have to say that a great voice, a\n\ncharismatic stage presence, and a fluid and inventive guitar technique (all\n\npresent in both Patty and Lynn) don't strike me as incapacitating attributes.\n\nCan they mask bad songwriting? Sure. They can make it hard to hear good\n\nsongwriting as well, if you've got your mind on other things, or if you're\n\nstressed out.\n\nBoth Patty and Lynn have songs of greater or lesser depth, and that's\n\nprobably because each of them writes for performance, which dictates a\n\nnecessity for a little breathing space between the hard-hitting songs. I've\n\nknown Patty's work for many years, and she has never struck me as being\n\nmediocre. Her entertaining songs are entertaining, and her heart songs come\n\nfrom the heart. If she had *never* written a bad or mediocre song, then she\n\nwould not human like the rest of us, but I'm willing to forgive any few sins\n\nof her youth if she's willing to forgive those of mine. I believe that Lynn\n\nis in the same league, and that she's way beyond the level of competence that\n\n(ghost) allows her. One needs both brains and guts to do this stuff on the\n\nlevel of art that has healing power: Lynn has both, and has done the job more\n\nthan once that I have witnessed, which is not to say that she won't get\n\nbetter.\n\nI'm a bit disappointed by (ghost)'s descending to the ill-conceived\n\ninvitation to flame contemporary songwriters, because I do think that such\n\nflames distract from real issues that have been brought up by this\n\ndiscussion, on some of which (ghost) and I might agree. Some are\n\ngenerational: older people have some different issues from people in their\n\ntwenties or teens as well as some of the same issues. What hits the mark with\n\none age group will sometimes bore another. I don't believe that songwriters\n\nof the current generation are necessarily less talented that those of\n\nprevious generations: there are bad songwriters in every generation, and we\n\ntend to remember the good ones. To me, that's one mark and one genius of folk\n\nmusic: songwriting is 90% editing, and audiences tend to forget the bad, and\n\nrework and remember the good. The older songs that audiences remember set\n\na standard that songwriters ignore at their peril. There are plenty of\n\ncontemporary songwriters who do just that, but there are those that don't,\n\ntoo. I haven't spent a lot of time with Susan Werner's work, but offhand she\n\nstrikes me as someone who has done her homework. I was a bit put off by her\n\nbaby boomer bashing song, but on the other hand, boomers such as she\n\ndescribes in it deserve such bashing. For my money, mine was the first\n\ngeneration to utter the idiot slogan \"never trust anybody over 30\" and then\n\nupon reaching 30, proceed to live out the rest of its life doing its best\n\npolitically to justify that slogan. Perhaps sometime someone will issue the\n\ncollected kinescopes of the old \"Hootenanny!\" show of the early '60s, and we\n\ncan all refresh our memories of some of the singer-songwriters of the time we\n\nwould much rather forget.\n\nI think that the industry's current interest in \"acoustic\n\nsinger-songwriters\" (as opposed to the hopelessly out-of-it and aging\n\n\"folksingers\" like myself) does tend to draw more chaff than wheat into the\n\nmill: now that fame is part of the equation for some, there will be more\n\nfolks in the market who care more about getting famous than about getting\n\ngood. But the number of true artists is no smaller now than it ever was. Song\n\nis a very powerful, very portable medium that deserves better than radio\n\nusually gives it: commercial radio, because it wants the ads to be the most\n\nmemorable content, and even public radio at this point, because it's scared\n\nof Newt and his ilk. Major labels tend to look for visuals and demographics,\n\nand are more likely to invest $100,000 or so at a shot into songs that are a\n\nmile wide and an inch deep. These pressures affect even good writers and\n\nartists, and sometimes diminish their work. I trust the selection process of\n\nfolk music much more than that of the industry. As more monetary investment\n\ncomes in, it's harder to hear the voice of the audience through the paid\n\nhype.\n\n(ghost) and I are both disappointed that we don't get to hear enough of\n\nthe best of songwriters we both know are good, and we both happen to live in\n\na relatively good area for folk radio. I think (ghost)'s general criteria for\n\ngood songs may be pretty sensible as well. I would add (as (ghost) seems to\n\nimply) that there is such a thing as truth, as relative as it may seem at\n\ntimes, and that songwriters have some kind of obligation to express it as\n\nclearly as they can.\n\nHere are a few things I do in my songwriting groups, which affirm artists\n\nof such wildly different styles and temperaments as to permanently disabuse\n\nany witness of any \"homogenizing\" quality. Firstly, I get songwriters into\n\nthe same room and help teach them to deal with another. Art on the one hand,\n\nand madness and addiction on the other, do tend to straddle a fine line (see\n\n\"Witness to the Fire: Creativity and the Veil of Addiction\" by Linda Schierse\n\nLeonard, published by Shambhala Press). Like those who put 3 people each of\n\nwhom thought they were Jesus in the same living situation (see \"The Three\n\nChrists of Ypsilanti\", author and publisher unknown) I help them to discover\n\ntheir issues in common, and thus reduce their isolation and tendency toward\n\ndelusion (even as I reduce my own). I outline my own answers to the question\n\nof why one writes a song in the first place, when there are so many good ones\n\naround already. I talk a little about various cultural and spiritual\n\nresources that are available to songwriters. Then I ask each student \"what\n\nkind of song do you sort of admire, but can't imagine yourself writing?\" Then\n\nwe work out an individual songwriting assignment to be worked on for the\n\nduration of the class. Because each student picks a real hump to get over,\n\neverybody is a beginner in a sense; because each picks her or his own\n\nobstacle, sometimes some important growth gets done. In any case, for the\n\nrest of the class we share the process and the product with an eye to\n\ncompassion for the songwriter's audience as well as the songwriter. Some\n\nsongs work better than others because the human brain seems to be built in a\n\ncertain way; other songs (sometimes the same songs) work because they are\n\ntrue documents of the human heart. Lots of decisions have to be made, and\n\nlots of editing has to get done. Whatever level people are functioning\n\nat, most of them report that they've learned something, and sometimes\n\nsomething important to them. I am as surprised as anyone that this\n\nhappens, but I believe it does, because I've seen it time and again.\n\nIt's a painful process, and it requires more courage than is required\n\njust to talk about songs that others write, although anyone who cares\n\nenough about songwriting to look for the real thing has also to have a\n\ncertain kind of courage.\n\nI myself got hooked by the medium, and in the traditional musics\n\nthat nourished it and gave it a standard to live up to, just after the\n\nbust of the '60s folk boom. I was too dumb to stop, and by the time I\n\nwas old enough to know better I had discovered that good songs had the\n\npower to heal and clarify lives, and to help people celebrate them. I'm\n\ngratified that (ghost) thinks well of my writing in spite of Jesus\n\npopping up in the last line. I've been thinking of a song in which\n\nJesus shows up in the *first* verse, goes fishing with Greg Brown, mall\n\nshopping with Patty L., has a few beers with Bill Morrissey (and nurses\n\nhim through his hangover), organizes a strike with Sy Kahn, thumbs his\n\nnose at a TV evangelist with Bruce Cockburn, and _then_ saves\n\neverybody. I get more realistic as I get older. Then again, I've never\n\nbeen convinced that Jesus was looking for that kind of attention.\n\n"
