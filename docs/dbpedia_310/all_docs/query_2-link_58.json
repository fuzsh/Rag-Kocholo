        "text": "Raúl Ruiz, a Chilean director who presented a labyrinthine, cryptic picture of individual psychology and social relations in “Mysteries of Lisbon” and more than 100 other films, died on Friday in Paris. He was 70.\n\nHis death was announced by Chile’s minister of arts and culture, Luciano Cruz-Coke. The cause was complications of a lung infection, François Margolin, who produced several of Mr. Ruiz’s films, told The Associated Press.\n\nAlthough most of Mr. Ruiz’s films played in arthouses and film festivals, he began reaching a broader audience when “Three Lives and Only One Death,” starring Marcello Mastroianni, was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 1996, after which he began making films with international stars.\n\nThese included “Genealogies of a Crime” (1997) with Catherine Deneuve, “Comedy of Innocence” (2000) with Isabelle Huppert, and several films with John Malkovich, including the Austrian biographical film “Klimt” (2006).\n\nHe also made American films, including the Hitchcockian “Shattered Image” (1998), which starred William Baldwin and Anne Parillaud.\n\n“Time Regained” (1999), his retelling of the Proust novel, was a grand period piece that reflected his lifelong attraction to complex, interwoven social dramas, with a lineup of stars that included Ms. Deneuve as Odette de Crécy, Mr. Malkovich as the Baron de Charlus and Emmanuelle Béart as Gilberte.\n\nMr. Ruiz later indulged his passion for storytelling on a large social canvas in the 2010 film “Mysteries of Lisbon,” a twisting, incident-packed chronicle of the Portuguese aristocracy during the civil wars of the 19th century, which many critics regarded as the capstone to his career.\n\nBased on a sprawling 19th-century novel by Camilo Castelo Branco that was originally published in serial form, the film was shown in Europe as a television series stretching over six hours before being edited to a film of just over four. It made its debut in the United States at the New York Film Festival in 2010 and captivated critics with its scope and narrative complexity, full of deft twists and turns. “The world of his movies — as experienced by the characters and the audience alike — is at once soothingly, elegantly familiar and booby-trapped with surprises,” A. O. Scott wrote in a profile of Mr. Ruiz for The New York Times Magazine in July. “There are sudden disappearances, long-buried secrets coming to light, supernatural happenings and bizarre coincidences. In his universe, improbability is the rule.”\n\nRaúl Ernesto Ruiz Pino was born on July 25, 1941, in Puerto Montt, in the south of Chile, and grew up in and around Valparaiso. His father was a merchant marine captain with whom he sailed all over the world on his summer vacations.\n\nHe began writing plays at a furious rate while still a teenager, and although he studied law and theology at the University of Chile, he gravitated toward the film club and the department of experimental film.\n\nAfter spending a year at the film school run by Fernando Birri in Santa Fé, Argentina, he worked as an editor on television news programs in Chile and as a scriptwriter for soap operas produced by Televisa in Mexico, an experience reflected in his career-long fascination with popular culture and the conventions of serial narrative.\n\nMr. Ruiz came of age as a filmmaker soon after the socialist politician Salvador Allende was elected president of Chile in 1970. He had already built a small reputation for his first feature, the experimental sociopolitical comedy “Three Sad Tigers,” which won the top prize at the Locarno International Film Festival in 1969.\n\nIn an interview with Bomb in 1991, he called it “a film without a story,” describing it in terms that indicated his natural bent toward artistic subversion. “All the elements of a story are there but they are used like a landscape, and the landscape is used like story,” he said.\n\nEmployed by the state film agency, Chile Films, Mr. Ruiz took an oblique, surreal approach to political issues in several idiosyncratic films dealing with pressing social questions, notably “The Penal Colony,” a fanciful reinterpretation of the Kafka story, and “The Expropriation,” about an agronomist who is sent to take over a landowner’s estate and encounters a web of social contradictions.\n\nAfter Allende was overthrown in 1973, Mr. Ruiz sought asylum in France with his wife and sometime collaborator, the filmmaker Valéria Sarmiento, who survives him. There he embarked on an astonishingly varied and productive career as a director for film, television, video and the theater in a half-dozen languages, earning a critical reputation as one of the most compelling, idiosyncratic and elusive talents in the cinema.\n\nIn France, where he tended to use the French spelling of his first name, he translated his personal situation into a film, “Dialogue of Exiles” (1974), about a group of displaced Chileans struggling to find a footing in Paris. He then embarked on a series of films made for European television, notably the dislocated, experimental “Man Scattered and World Upside Down” (1975), made for German television, and “The Suspended Vocation” (1977) and “The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting” (1978), both made for French television.\n\nIn the early 1980s he returned to theatrical filmmaking, beginning with “The Territory,” co-produced by Roger Corman, which followed the fortunes of a group of tourists who lose their way in the forest and descend into barbarism. In the absurdist, parablelike “Top of the Whale,” also made in 1981, an anthropologist studying the last two members of an Indian tribe in Tierra del Fuego finds that they speak a language consisting of one word.\n\nWith “The Three Crowns of the Sailor” (1982), a set of complex, interwoven narratives related by a sailor to a student for the price of three Danish crowns, Mr. Ruiz entered into his mature phase and began attracting international attention. As with many of his subsequent films, including “City of Pirates” (1983), he played expertly with, and slyly confounded, conventional notions of storytelling, character and point of view. “If you can make it complicated, why make it simple?” he said in an interview at the 2004 Rotterdam film festival.\n\nIn 1985 Jack Lang, the French culture minister, appointed him director of the House of Culture in Le Havre. For the Avignon festival, he directed his first play, Calderón de la Barca’s “Life Is a Dream,” which he later reconceived as a film, with the same title, about a member of the Chilean resistance who forgets information vital to the movement and can only recapture it by watching science-fiction films that evoke the Calderón play.\n\nAt his death he had just completed “La Noche de Enfrente” (“The Night Ahead”), based on stories by the Chilean writer Hernán del Solar."
