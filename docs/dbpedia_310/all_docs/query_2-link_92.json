        "text": "Australia's greatest-ever single Olympic day has propelled the nation's overall golden tally to new heights.\n\nSailor Matt Wearn, skateboarder Keegan Palmer, Australia's four-strong men's team pursuit track cycling team and pole vaulter Nina Kennedy all saluted on Wednesday.\n\nIt pushed the title total from 14 to 18 in barely six hours, while most of Australia was asleep, their golden tally now clear of the 17 achieved in Athens and Tokyo.\n\nTwo bronze, to walk relay team Jemima Montag and Rhydian Cowley, along with history-making discus thrower Matt Denny, meant Australia has never had a better day at the Games.\n\nWearn started the parade when he became the first man to defend the Olympic dinghy title, while 21-year-old Palmer made it two-from-two since park skateboarding's introduction.\n\nFresh off breaking the world record to qualify for the final, Australia's quartet of Sam Welsford, Kelland O'Brien, Oliver Bleddyn and Conor Leahy held off their British rivals to add a third gold in barely two hours.\n\nKennedy then defied an early miss to vault herself and Australia to new heights.\n\n\"I didn't know that (until just now) that is just insane,\" Kennedy said after walking off the Stade de France track.\n\n\"I can't wait to go home and watch a replay of the whole Olympics.\"\n\nThe brilliant day eclipsed the record that had been set just three years ago in Tokyo.\n\nBack then, Wearn, BMX whiz Logan Martin, swimmer Emma McKeon and the 4x100m medley relay team all scooped a quartet of gold on the same day, but there were no minor medals.\n\nAustralia won gold on each of the first eight days in Paris - the previous best was four - and has won a title on all but one day so far at the 2024 Games.\n\nAnd with four days to go there remain several live chances to push the bar higher.\n\nBoxers Caitlin Parker and Charlie Senior have semi-final bouts on Thursday, while the women's water polo, beach volleyball and basketball teams are all in semis.\n\nMinjee Lee is lurking within reach with three rounds to play in the women's golf and canoe sprint pair Jean van der Westhuyzen and Tom Green are defending their Tokyo crown, albeit over 500m rather than the 1000m raced in Japan.\n\nMaddison Keeney (3m springboard) and Cassiel Rousseau (10m platform) shape as Australia's best medal hopes in diving.\n\nAUSTRALIA'S MOST SUCCESSFUL OLYMPICS\n\n* Paris (2024): 18 gold, 12 silver, 11 bronze (41 total)\n\n* Athens (2004): 17, 16, 17 (50)\n\n* Tokyo (2020): 17, 7, 22 (46)\n\n* Sydney (2000): 16, 25, 17 (58)"
