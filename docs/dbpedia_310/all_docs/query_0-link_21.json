        "text": "Animal Farm returns with a deep dive into those denizens of the depths, the bashful, burrowing mole. You’ll see plenty of the small, squinty-eyed subterranean mammals on screen here, digging up a storm in films like Fantastic Mr. Fox and Fast, Cheap & Out of Control, as well as the underground tunnel-dwelling human subjects of Dark Days, the hollow earth mutants of The Mole People and, for good measure, some homograph “moles,” including the deep cover agents of The Departed and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, and Marilyn’s beauty mark (albeit a fake, her real one is covered up!) in Some Like It Hot.\n\nTo mark the publication of the first English-language edition of Chris Marker’s 1982 photo-essay Le Dépays by Film Desk Books, Metrograph offers a program of films that touch on some of the director’s recurring obsessions, as evidenced in this remarkable volume. A program of short films explore some of his favorite animal avatars (Cat Listening to Music, An Owl is an Owl is an Owl), and his profound connection to Japan (The Koumiko Mystery, Sans Soleil, Tokyo Days), followed by a panel discussion with Paul Chan and Lynne Sachs, moderated by Sadie Starnes, while A.K., Marker’s portrait of Akira Kurosawa on the set of Ran (1985), screens in a very special double bill.\n\n“Inventing Japan is just another way of getting to know it. Once you’ve gotten beyond the clichés, once you’ve outwitted the cliché of cutting through the clichés, then the chances are mathematically the same for all, and consider the time you’ve saved! Trust appearances, consciously confuse the décor with the drama, never worry about understanding, just be there—dasein—and everything will come your way. Well, something, at least.”—Marker, in Le Dépays\n\nWith intros and Q&As from series curator Sadie Starnes, artist and writer Paul Chan, filmmaker and poet Lynne Sachs, and writer Ethan Spigland."
