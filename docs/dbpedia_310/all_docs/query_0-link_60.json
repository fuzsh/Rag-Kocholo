        "text": "In 2023, huge movies will be everywhere. The latest blockbuster sequels and franchise movies dominate the box office, but streaming services are challenging the big screen with major stars and directors dropping new films on Netflix, Apple TV, Disney Plus and more. From Indiana Jones and John Wick to the Expendables and the Fast and Furious crew, will any of these countless sequels match the mega-success of last year's Top Gun: Maverick and Avatar 2, or will we see another word-of-mouth original hit like Everything Everywhere All at Once?\n\nThese are the latest dates for your calendar as we celebrate the big films (and hopefully a few smaller ones) hitting the big screen and streaming services in 2023 and beyond. Scroll down for a chronological list of release dates.\n\nWhat's coming out in the coming year?\n\nLots of familiar faces. The Saw and the Fast and Furious franchises hit their 10th entry, while Tom Cruise will be looking to repeat his Top Gun: Maverick mega-success with Mission: Impossible movie no. 7. Look out for sequels involving John Wick, The Expendables, Ghostbusters, Creed and Kenneth Branagh's version of Hercule Poirot. Netflix is bringing back hugely popular action flick Extraction and TV detective Luther. Even Magic Mike is having one last ride. And Harrison Ford may be in his 80s, but that won't stop the fifth Indiana Jones adventure swinging into theaters.\n\nWe've lost count of how many Transformers movies there are, but there's a new one in 2023. We also return to the world of the Hunger Games and Willy Wonka with new prequels. It's another big year for horror, too: after M3gan was a hit, the Conjuring and Insidious franchises keep rolling, while horror icons The Exorcist and The Evil Dead rise again.\n\nSpeaking of sequels and franchises, of course there are a ton of superhero movies. Marvel's Ant-Man and the Wasp kick things off for the MCU, with the Guardians of the Galaxy in action for a third and possibly final time before newer heroes cross over from Disney Plus for team-up adventure The Marvels. Outside of the MCU, the much-anticipated Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse also drops, and we'll see another Venom-style Spider-spinoff, Kraven the Hunter. Meanwhile comic book rivals DC bring back Aquaman and the Flash, and also introduce new face Blue Beetle.\n\nIt's not just comics being plundered for the big screen: This year's toy and game adaptations include Dungeons and Dragons, Super Mario Bros. and Gran Turismo. Meanwhile Disney celebrates its 100th anniversary with the new cartoon Wish, theme park-inspired Haunted Mansion and a live-action reboot of The Little Mermaid, not to mention Pixar film Elemental and an as-yet-unknown film in December.\n\nSome of the year's sequels and blockbusters are at least helmed by directors we're happy to see more of, like Nia DaCosta, Steven Soderbergh, Neil Blomkamp and Paddington's Paul King. Indie horror icon Ben Wheatley directs Jason Statham punching a megashark in The Meg 2, while Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part 2 have viewers hyped. Zack Snyder also fills in the gap left by the lack of a Star Wars or Avatar in theaters this Christmas with Rebel Moon on Netflix.\n\nSpeaking of cool filmmakers, we'll also see original films from Christopher Nolan, M. Night Shyamalan, Taika Waititi, Nicole Holofcener, Kenya Barris, Luca Guadagnino and Adele Lim. And as ever, January's Sundance Film Festival showcases talented indie and up-and-coming filmmakers telling unique and unexpected stories.\n\nBut delays are still happening: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, the Mario movie, Aquaman 2, Madame Web and The Flash have all shifted in the schedule. Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible 7 and 8 have been pushed back multiple times, while delays to Blade have reshuffled phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nIt's been tough to keep up with all the changes, but we've got you covered on the latest US release dates for the end of 2022 and into 2023. If these dates are still in flux, we'll let you know about the latest changes as new dates are announced.
