        "text": "LONDON, United Kingdom -\n\nFar-right demonstrations that had been anticipated by police in dozens of locations across Britain failed to materialize Wednesday as peaceful anti-racism protesters instead showed up in force.\n\nPolice had prepared for another night of violence at 100 locations following a week of rioting and disorder fueled by misinformation over a stabbing attack against young girls. Many businesses had boarded up windows and closed down in fear of what lay ahead.\n\nStand up to Racism and other groups had planned counter-protests in response, but in most places they reclaimed their streets with nothing to oppose.\n\nIn London, Bristol, Oxford, Liverpool and Birmingham, large, peaceful crowds gathered outside agencies and law firms specializing in immigration that had been listed by internet chat groups as possible targets of far-right activity.\n\nDownload the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories\n\nIn resounding choruses they chanted: \"Whose streets? Our streets!\"\n\nIt was a vast change from the chaos that has erupted on streets throughout England and Belfast, Northern Ireland, since July 30.\n\nCities and towns have been wracked by riots and looting for the past week as angry mobs, encouraged by far-right extremists, clashed with police and counter-demonstrators. The disturbances began after misinformation spread about the stabbing rampage that killed three girls in the seaside community of Southport, with social media users falsely identifying the suspect as an immigrant and a Muslim.\n\nRioters spouting anti-immigrant slogans have attacked mosques and hotels housing asylum-seekers, creating fear in Muslim and immigrant communities. In recent days, reports have emerged of violent counterattacks in some areas.\n\nThe head of London's Metropolitan Police Service said earlier Wednesday that officers were focused on protecting immigration lawyers and services. In addition to thousands of officers already deployed, about 1,300 specialist forces were on standby in case of serious trouble in London.\n\n\"We'll protect those people,\" Commissioner Mark Rowley said. \"It is completely unacceptable, regardless of your political views, to intimidate any sector of lawful activity, and we will not let the immigration asylum system be intimidated.\"\n\nBy early late evening, though, with the exception of scattered disturbances and some arrests, trouble had not erupted.\n\nA crowd of immigrant supporters that quickly grew to several hundred in the London neighbourhood of North Finchley found themselves largely alone with several dozen police officers.\n\nA police van burns as an unruly crowd clashed with police, July 30, 2024, in Southport, northwest England, near where three girls were stabbed to death in a dance class the day before. (Richard McCarthy/PA via AP)\n\nThe crowd chanted \"refugees welcome\" and \"London against racism.\" Some held signs saying \"Stop the far right,\" \"Migration is not a crime\" and \"Finchley against Fascism.\"\n\nAt one point, an unruly man who had been shouting at the group and pulling his shirt up to show off an eagle tattoo was punched by a protester. He was led away by someone and officers questioned a possible suspect.\n\nOutside an immigration center in the Walthamstow area in east London, an anti-racism protest leader barked \"fascist scum\" to which a crowd of hundreds responded: \"off our streets.\"\n\nIn Liverpool, hundreds showed up to defend the Asylum Link immigration center. A grandmother held a placard reading \"Nans Against Nazis\" and someone else held a sign saying, \"When the poor blame the poor only the rich win.\"\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer has described the previous disturbances as \"far-right thuggery,\" rejecting any suggestion that the riots were about the government's immigration policies. He has warned that anyone taking part in the violence would \"face the full force of the law.\"\n\nPolice have made more than 400 arrests and are considering using counter-terrorism laws to prosecute some rioters. The government has pledged to prosecute those responsible for the disorder, including those who use social media to incite the violence.\n\nFollow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp\n\nAmong the first to be sentenced was Derek Drummond, 58, who received three years in prison after admitting to violent disorder and punching a police officer in the face in Southport on July 30. He was one of three men jailed after their cases were heard Wednesday at Liverpool Crown Court.\n\n\"The three men sentenced today are the tip of the iceberg, and just the start of what will be a very painful process for many who foolishly chose to involve themselves in violent unrest,\" said Jonathan Egan, the senior district crown prosecutor. \"Many of those involved will be sent to prison for a long time.\"\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a post on X that the police, city hall and community leaders were working to protect targeted buildings and places of worship.\n\n\"I know the shocking scenes have left many Muslims and minority ethnic communities scared and fearful, so I ask my fellow Londoners to check on their friends and neighbours and show them that care and compassion is what Londoners are all about,\" he said.\n\nIn Walthamstow, real estate agents shut down storefronts early and told staff to work from home. The Nags Head pub informed customers via social media it wouldn't open because of \"potential protest.\" The council closed the local library.\n\nSmaller communities were affected as well. Businesses owners in Westcliff-on-Sea, in southern England, boarded up shopfronts.\n\nSaira Hussain, who runs a small architectural practice, described the unrest as \"upsetting.\"\n\n\"I'm a third-generation British Pakistani,\" she said. \"I was born here, studied here, trade here and employ people from this country. I bet I've contributed much more to this country than any of these people that are causing trouble.\"\n\n------\n\nAssociated Press writers Niko Price and Alix Kroeger in London contributed."
