        "text": "Chapter Text\n\n126 AC, The Vale\n\nThe Eyrie was ancient and vast, sprawling high above the mountaintops. Perched on Giant’s Lance, it offered a breathtaking view of the valley far below. Though it was the smallest of the great castles, it was considered to be impregnable - no army had ever breached its Bloody Gate.\n\nIts High Hall boasted walls of blue-veined marble, adorned with the finest carpets and tapestries that money could buy. The Arryns, to no surprise, were warm and welcoming to their royal guests. They were her mother’s house, and that bond ran strong, even now. During their stay, the Arryns hosted several lavish feasts, where their table always flowed with meats and cheeses and arbor wine.\n\nThey had gathered here tonight, enjoying an evening meal before the day came to an end.\n\n“Ser Harwin, I’m curious to hear your thoughts about this royal tour,” Ser Arnold said, taking a sip of his wine. “After Princess Rhaenyra is crowned, will you spend much time in the Vale? After all, you will be King someday. I’m sure you hold an opinion on the matter.”\n\n“Consort,” Harwin replied without missing a beat. His eyes flickered across the table to Rhaenyra, then back to Ser Arnold. The room went silent.\n\nArnold set down his wine. “Pardon?”\n\n“The husband of the Queen is the King Consort,” Harwin explained. “I have no Targaryen blood, and no intention of ruling in my wife’s stead.”\n\nEveryone at the table knew Arnold was aware of this, but no one dared to comment on it.\n\n“Curious,” Arnold muttered under his breath, but didn’t elaborate further. Rhaenyra felt her jaw clench, but said nothing. Instead, she turned her attention back to her empty plate.\n\nHer time in the Vale had been pleasant enough, except for Ser Arnold. He had been a constant pain in her side. When he wasn’t subtly challenging her or Lady Arryn, he would give Rhaenyra looks that left her feeling uneasy. His blue eyes would stare fiercely into hers before drifting down her body, lingering just a bit too long on her curves.\n\nHarwin had noticed, too. And it made his eyes gleam with barely concealed rage. If they hadn’t been guests at her cousin’s table, Harwin would’ve leapt across it.\n\nRhaenyra shifted uncomfortably in her chair. “This has been lovely,” she said, setting her napkin on the table. “But I think I will retire for the night.” As she stood, everyone else began to rise, but she raised a hand to stop them. “No need. Please stay seated.”\n\nRhaenyra made her way out of the hall without a second glance, following the dim light of torches that illuminated the path to her chambers. But as soon as she reached her door, she heard the faint echo of footsteps following closely behind her.\n\nShe whirled around in alarm, finding herself face to face with Ser Arnold. “What are you doing?” Rhaenyra asked sharply. The anger she had kept in check during dinner was now boiling at the surface.\n\n“Princess Rhaenyra,” he greeted, and then bowed quickly, nearly forgetting his manners. “I was hoping to catch you before you went to bed. There’s something that I wanted to discuss with you, privately.”\n\nShe bit the inside of her cheek. “The hour is late.”\n\n“It will only take a minute,” he insisted. He stepped a little closer, so close that she could sense the warmth radiating from his body. The stench of wine lingering on his breath.\n\n“What is it that you want?”\n\n“The Eyrie.”\n\nRhaenyra raised an eyebrow. “What about it?”\n\nHis face flushed, though whether it was from wine or embarrassment, she couldn’t tell. He slowly rocked back on his heels, as if contemplating what to say. Having already started on the wrong foot with the Princess, he wasn’t looking to make matters worse.\n\nSer Arnold cleared his throat. “Out of respect for your late mother,” he began, “and respect for your position, we have allowed you to stay here. But at great cost to our coffers.”\n\nRhaenyra glared at him, her irritation poorly masked. “And now you’re seeking repayment.”\n\n“If you would like to call it that,” he responded defensively, though his intention was obvious. He ran a hand through his cropped brown hair. “But it doesn’t need to sound so harsh. We’re all family here. I’m helping you with your birthright, and I was hoping you might help me with mine.”\n\nShe scoffed, not believing what she was hearing. “You’ve spent half your time blatantly ignoring me since my arrival, and the other half challenging me at every turn. And now you expect my help?”\n\n“Isn’t that your role as the Princess?”\n\n“And your future Queen,” she added. A reminder that he apparently needed tonight.\n\n“Right,” he said, though he didn’t sound too convinced.\n\nWith that, the pieces began to fall into place. This knight didn’t care about her or her birthright. Not at all. Instead, he was seeking her assistance for his own personal gain, and would betray her as soon as the opportunity arose.\n\nRhaenyra crossed her arms. “I suppose it’s not just my position that threatens you, but all women in power,” she snapped. Her eyes flickered down the hall, then back to his face. “Does Lady Jeyne know you plan to overrule her, or are you too stupid to believe she won’t find out on her own?”\n\nArnold was a little too calm for her liking. His face was unreadable, almost unnervingly so. “I’m hurt that you overestimate my intentions. Perhaps it’s the wine in my belly, but I’m confident I could convince you to change your mind.”\n\n“And how would you accomplish that?”\n\nA smirk curled at the edge of his lips as he leaned forward and whispered, “Invite me into your bed.”\n\nRhaenyra’s eyes widened. She took a step back, then another, creating some distance between them. “You think I would accept this?”\n\nArnold nodded. “I think you can do whatever you like, Princess.” He leaned an arm against the door behind her, caging her in. “Ser Harwin Strong was your sworn shield during your first marriage, and then became your doting husband just months later. Imagine that.” He let out a soft laugh. “And considering Laenor’s afflictions, and your…reputation, it doesn’t surprise-”\n\nBefore he could utter another word, Rhaenyra slapped him across the face. Hard.\n\nOne moment Arnold was standing, and the next moment he was stumbling backward, holding his reddened cheek. His mouth gaped open. As he stood there in stunned silence, Rhaenyra towered before him. Reclaiming her power.\n\n“It is my fault you have forgotten to fear me,” she said, her words both a warning and a curse. Her voice lowered to an almost deadly tone, promising rage and retribution. Fire and blood. “Perhaps living in the Eyre has given you a false sense of security. Maybe you’ve grown too comfortable here, thinking you’re untouchable, believing you’re beyond reach or reproach.” She slapped him again, a little harder this time. “Or perhaps my cousin gives you too long a leash. But know this, Ser Arnold, if you dishonor me again, I’ll return to the Vale and burn you alive.”\n\nRhaenyra raised her hand to strike him a third time, but Arnold caught her wrist before she could swing. “You have some nerve-”\n\n“Step away from the princess,” Harwin’s voice said behind Arnold.\n\nThe knight whirled around to face her husband, who stood in the middle of the hall. His presence was both ominous and terrifying, like an omen of doom. A harbinger of death. The air seemed to grow colder as Harwin’s hand rested on the hilt of his sword, the sharp blade glinting in the torchlight. “I won’t ask again,” he warned him.\n\nArnold did not back down. Did not even flinch as he held his ground.\n\nRhaenyra’s eyes drifted to Harwin, then to Arnold. Neither man would yield to the other, she realized, and neither would go down without a fight.\n\nHarwin was also quick to recognize this. He had dealt with men like Ser Arnold before - pompous knights who were used to getting their way. They wouldn’t respect authority unless it was demanded with force. But as Harwin began to draw his blade, Rhaenyra intervened.\n\n“Don’t,” she commanded, raising a hand to stop him. She wouldn’t raise weapons in her cousin’s house.\n\nArnold let out a low, taunting laugh. “I see you’ve traded your dragon for a dog,” he sneered, his voice dripping with disgust. He jerked his chin toward Harwin. “Call him off.”\n\nShe would do no such thing. Instead, she pushed Arnold away and moved closer to her husband, placing herself in front of him. “You should leave, Ser Arnold,” she warned him. “Now.”\n\nArnold took a long look at Rhaenyra. Studied her, and then determined she was an immovable force, not worth his time or effort. With a defeated grimace, he brushed past them, making his way back to the main hall.\n\nHarwin began to follow.\n\n“Don’t go after him,” Rhaenyra called out softly. When Harwin kept walking, she raised her voice. “That’s an order from your Princess.”\n\nHe immediately stopped in his tracks, but didn’t turn around. “You have never ordered anything from me before,” he said, his back still turned to her. His hands clenched by his sides.\n\n“Well,” Rhaenyra began, “I am ordering you now. I don’t need you to defend me.”\n\nHe finally spun around, and his face was a mixture of surprise and frustration, unlike anything she’d ever seen from him before. “If that’s the case, then why am I here?”\n\nRhaenyra shot him a look. Her lingering anger from Ser Arnold was slowly shifting Harwin’s way, and she had no desire to stop it. She didn’t have time for this. For some reason, she wanted to prove herself, and that underlying insecurity was now rearing its ugly head.\n\n“You are my consort,” she stated simply.\n\nHarwin scoffed, unimpressed with her answer. “Is that all?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Is that all I am to you?” His blue eyes met hers, silently pleading with her, making her feel a pang of guilt in her chest. But instead of comforting him, she quickly averted her gaze.\n\n“Did you need something from me?” Rhaenyra asked, shifting the topic. Her demeanor was cold and guarded. More distant than ever before.\n\nA flicker of disappointment flashed across Harwin’s face. He held up a scroll, then tossed it her way. “A raven,” he said as she caught the scroll. “From Daemon.” He gave her one last look, wondering if she’d say anything more, but when she didn’t, he whispered, “Goodnight, Rhaenyra.”\n\nHarwin didn’t come to her chambers that night. And she didn’t seek him out.\n\nThe North was as beautiful as his Mother claimed.\n\nAs Vermax and Moondancer descended from the skies, their majestic wings cast shadows over the earth below. A lingering chill greeted them as they landed upon the lush clearing that stretched beyond Winterfell's gates, wrapping around them like a gentle caress.\n\n“The North,” Baela breathed out, shivering as her breath fogged in front of her. Her eyes twinkled with astonishment at the vast lands around them, the falling flakes coating her hair with sparkling crystals of ice. Wrapping her cloak tightly around her shoulders, she slipped gracefully from her saddle, her boots crunching in the fresh snow beneath them. “I’ve never been up here before.”\n\nJace’s response was as gentle as the breeze ruffling through his curls. “Neither have I,” he said softly. As he spoke, his gaze lingered on her, taking a quiet moment to admire her fully. “The North already suits you well, my Lady.”\n\nHe had come a long way, he thought, from being repulsed by the idea of his betrothal. Such boyish notions no longer mattered to him.\n\nNow, whenever he looked at Baela, he understood why they wrote songs and ballads about love and heartbreak. He understood why men went to war for their lovers, only to never return.\n\nBaela flashed him a grin as she pulled her bag from Moondancer’s saddle. “Planning on moving anytime soon?”\n\nJace couldn’t help his soft chuckle. “I’m not entirely convinced that Vermax would be so tolerant of my decisions.” With a quick snap of his saddle’s buckle, he slid down his dragon’s wing, landing just a step behind her. “But I’d follow you anywhere you wished,” he added with a charming smile, “just maybe someplace with more sun.”\n\n“King’s Landing has plenty of sun,” she teased, playfully biting her lip. Jace quickly marked the movement, moving even closer, and with a mischievous glint in his eyes, he reached up to gently press his thumb against her soft mouth.\n\n“If King’s Landing doesn’t have you, then I don’t want it.”\n\nThe ancient Weirwood tree loomed high above the heart of the Godswood, its splintered branches reaching towards the sky like fingers pointing to the heavens. Whether it was an omen or a warning, Jace wasn’t entirely sure.\n\nHe didn’t know much about the old gods. Frankly, he didn’t know much about the new gods, either. These gods, these customs - they were all so strange to him. Winterfell was strange to him.\n\nBeyond its brutal winds, the North had been warm and inviting, full of unexpected hospitality from the brute man that stood before him. Lord Cregan carried himself with a grace and poise of a man hardened well beyond his years, something Jace very much understood. They had gotten along rather quickly, spending their nights drinking and their days hunting, but despite their shared camaraderie, Jace had grown weary.\n\nThey had spent months in these snowy lands with little to show for it. Although the North had been pleasant enough, and Cregan was as gracious a host as any, Jace found himself thankful for the small comfort of Baela by his side - an anchor to keep him steady, keep him focused.\n\nThey were at peace, she reminded him. But peace could be deceiving. Fickle, like the changing tides of the sea. Even tranquil waters could be dangerous, hiding hideous beasts that lurked beneath the waves, readying to strike. Is there really peace if the sailor knows there’s a calm before the storm, or should they ready their sails and set the course?\n\nThe Northerners were proud men, and Cregan loved his people. But when the dawn came, and push came to shove, Jace wasn’t entirely sure if he’d spare those people to support their Queen. And Jace knew, deep down, there was no room for missteps. He would gain the support of the North by any means necessary.\n\n“It is just a tour,” Baela had reassured him, brushing a stray curl behind his ear. “We are here to gain allies, and the Starks have never broken their oaths. Today will not be the day they do.”\n\n“We will see about that.” Jace’s face was drawn as he started across the Godswood, where Cregan had been waiting. Each step crunched over frosted grass, leaving heavy footprints across the white ground. He instinctively buried his frozen hands deep into the fur-lined pockets of his cloak as he matched Cregan's broad stride, moving in unison through the forest. Baela purposefully lingered behind, granting the two men some semblance of privacy as they spoke.\n\nCregan cleared his throat as he ducked under a low-hanging branch. “I know you are wondering why I haven’t fully pledged my house’s support to Princess Rhaenyra.”\n\nJace nodded silently, keeping pace.\n\n“It is difficult,” Cregan explained, “for me to have blind faith - not just with you, or your house, but with anyone who’s not a Northerner.” He waved a hand, gesturing to the snowy lands around them, the trees stretching high and far on either side. “Here, we are so isolated from the rest of the realm. And sometimes, I wonder if the rest of the realm has forgotten us entirely. My people are strong, hardworking men and women alike, and it’s difficult for me to imagine putting them in danger. If your uncle decides to challenge your mother, then I’ll be doing just that - endangering their lives. And to what end? Aye, I am a Stark, and I keep my oaths, but it may take a great sacrifice to put your Mother on that throne.”\n\nJace carefully weighed every word, frowning as he stared up ahead. “You’re expecting something in return,” he said plainly.\n\n“Why shouldn’t I be? I don’t mean to offend, my Prince, but what has the Crown ever done to support the North?” Cregan reached for the flask clipped to his belt, his thumb flicking open the cap with an audible click before tilting it forward. An offering - one that Jace heartily accepted.\n\n“Thanks,” he said, taking a hearty swig of the foul liquid. It burned down his throat, warming and pooling at his belly. He handed the flask back to Cregan. “What did you have in mind?”\n\nCregan took a deep breath, as if he was afraid to answer directly. “You’ve met Sara,” he said. It wasn’t a question.\n\n“I have.”\n\n“And?”\n\n“And?” Jace asked, unsure of where the conversation was leading. He settled on a safe response. A diplomatic answer. “She seems like a lovely lady.”\n\n“How would you feel about marrying her?”\n\nJace’s cheeks reddened at the word. “Marriage?” he asked, shooting a glance back to the thicket where Baela would surely be waiting for them. Part of him felt that she should be present for this conversation.\n\nCregan noticed his hesitation and quickly added, “Please don't take it as a slight.”\n\n“Any slight to Baela is a slight to me. We are one and the same.”\n\n“So, you are committed to your betrothed,” Cregan commented, flashing him a soft smile. He patted him hard on the back. “Most men would sway from their oaths if they had the chance.”\n\n“I am not like most men.”\n\n“I can see that.” Cregan peered at the horizon, where a dusty layer of snow was settling in. “I suppose I’m just looking for reassurance that the North won’t be forgotten when it’s time to put your blood on the throne.”\n\n“And I was reassured that the North prides itself on loyalty to their oaths. Unwavering loyalty.” He stressed those last words, his shoulders tense. “It feels like we are at a standstill, Lord Stark.”\n\nThe words weighed heavily in his gut. Think, his mother would tell him. A good ruler thinks of those affected by their choices and considers what's best for all.\n\nThat was easier said than done.\n\nHe let out a puff of breath, watching it evaporate in the cool winter air.\n\nWith war looming on the horizon, there was no time to delay. They needed to act. If he was to become king one day, he'd have to make logical choices, carve the right path. Despite what some may say, he was a man now - as much of a man that one could be at his age. His life experiences had aged him well beyond his years, and he’d been trained for this. His mother had made sure of it.\n\nHe bit his lip as he pondered his options. There weren’t many to choose from.\n\nHis sister, Visenya? Merely a babe, and not his to offer. He would not speak for her hand.\n\nBut then it hit him.\n\nJace turned to Cregan, meeting his brooding gaze. The color paled from his frostbitten cheeks. “I have another idea.”\n\n“What?”\n\nHe dragged a hand through his curly hair as he said, “If I were to bear a son, he would be heir to the Iron Throne. Wed my son to your firstborn daughter, and bind our houses. The Targaryens and the Starks will be forever forged in the history books, with a dragon King and northern Queen by his side.”\n\nHe had never thought about children before, and now here he was, promising some nameless offspring to another. Deciding the fate of someone before they even existed.\n\nPerhaps this was what Mother meant during those endless lectures she bestowed upon him time and time again, when she spoke of duty and warned of the sacrifices to be made. Doing the right thing was not always easy, and doing the easy thing was not always right. A good ruler knew when to act, when to play their hand, and when to hold back.\n\nJace was beginning to understand this now. Everything held a cost, but he wondered if the price was worth the payment.\n\nCregan let out a laugh. “You pride yourself highly on offspring you currently do not have.”\n\nHis head snapped towards him. “And you pride yourself highly on your Winter Wolves, an army I have not yet seen.” Jace’s eyes flickered with challenge. “My word is true, and our grandchildren would rule with ice and fire in their veins.”\n\nCregan’s brow raised as thought about this. And then a slow smile spread across his face. He extended a gloved hand towards Jace, which he eagerly grasped. “We will call it the Pact of Ice and Fire,” Cregan said. “I look forward to binding our houses.”\n\nAs Cregan began walking away, Jace remained in the clearing. The gentle drift of snowflakes blanketed his dark curls as he waited for Baela to catch up with him, emerging from where she’d been quietly following behind.\n\nHer eyes scanned his face, searching for an answer to questions left unspoken. Could she have known what they discussed in the forest? Did she believe his duty to her wavered, even for a minute?\n\nJace gently circled her wrists, bringing them to rest against his chest. Her fingers splayed across the leather there - a small comfort, which was all she allowed herself. To touch him so freely when they were not yet wed, to feel his heartbeat thrumming beneath her palms. As if each beat was a song completely devoted to her.\n\nMarriage. She hated that it bothered her. Hated that it made her feel so insecure.\n\nHer mother would have thought such things were trivial. Completely unimportant in the grand scheme of things. And they were unimportant, she supposed, to a degree. Binding oneself to another for all eternity was no laughing matter, but at the end of the day, it didn't take away what she was.\n\nShe was a dragonrider, with the blood of Old Valyria coursing through her veins. The heir to the Driftwood Throne. No matter what happened to her, or who she was wed to, no one could ever take that away from her. It was in her very blood.\n\nJace seemed to read the conflicting emotions spread across her face, noting the small wrinkle forming between her brows whenever she worried too much. He waited until Lord Cregan was completely out of earshot before whispering, “I have never wavered, not once. I intend to take you as my wife, my Queen, and my word…our word, will become law.”\n\nSomething restless settled deep inside her. “Thank you, my Prince.”\n\n“Jace,” he corrected. Baela simply stared at him, shock coating her delicate features, and she was about to protest when he said, “Never above you. Always besides you. We will be equals in every way that matters.”\n\nHer fingers tightened on his vest. “I’d like that, Jace.”\n\nHis answering smile was bright enough to melt the falling snow around them. “Me too.”\n\nRhaenyra had a plan.\n\nIt wasn’t a well-thought-out plan, but it was a plan, nonetheless. Or some semblance of a plan.\n\nShe hadn’t spoken to Harwin since last night, and she had no intention of breaking that silence.\n\nIt wasn’t his fault for caring. But she was just too angry, and she couldn’t exactly explain why. The anger wasn’t directed at him, but he had caught himself in the line of fire. Words had been exchanged, and now she regretted them. And the longer she left things unresolved between them, the worse it became.\n\nShe knew she needed to break the silence eventually and apologize, but she just wanted to be angry. And maybe she wanted someone to be angry at her back. It was easier to let him resent her than to admit she overreacted.\n\nThe High Hall had been transformed, its long table pushed to the side to allow for dancing and conversation. Houses Royce, Runestone, and Corbray were all in attendance, joining the celebrations as the royal party finished this leg of their tour.\n\nIt was there that she spotted Ser Arnold, looking more somber than usual. He pressed a glass of wine to his lips as he watched the small orchestra prepare for their next song.\n\nRhaenyra made her way through the crowd, cautiously approaching him. “Ser Arnold,” she greeted, extending her hand. “May I have this dance?”\n\nHe gave her a curious look, briefly hesitating, but then couldn’t resist the temptation. He took her hand, allowing himself to be led to the middle of the floor. Harwin watched the entire interaction with a sidelong glance.\n\nRhaenyra placed her free hand on his shoulder. \"Are you too proud to accept an apology?\" she asked as she swayed to the music. Her violet eyes flickered up at him through her long lashes. \"I'm sorry for my behavior last night. I was...tired. But now, I find myself intrigued by your proposal.\"\n\nShe failed to mention which proposal that was.\n\nA look of interest flashed across Arnold’s face, and he regarded her with wide eyes. But he remained silent. Part of him didn't trust her completely, and she didn't blame him. They had been constantly at odds with each other, and last night it had reached its boiling point. Gaining his trust would not be easy.\n\nWhich meant she'd have to pry a little deeper.\n\nRhaenyra licked her bottom lip, and Arnold tracked the movement. “Tell me more about your troubles with the Eyrie,” she insisted. “I’m curious about how I could help.”\n\n“Ah,” he finally spoke. “Where do I begin?” His eyes drifted to Jeyne, who sat in the corner beside Jessamyn. The pair had been inseparable since childhood, and it was rumored that Jessamyn spent more time in the Vale than at her own home. “She is too soft to rule.”\n\nInteresting. But not unexpected from him. “Do you think all women are like this?” Rhaenyra asked.\n\n“No,” he answered quickly. He turned back to her, his eyes roving over her dress - a tight, maroon gown she had deliberately chosen for tonight. “You are…soft in other ways.”\n\n“Thank you,” she managed to say, her voice straining with the effort.\n\nA brief silence fell between them as they circled the room. Out of the corner of her eye, Rhaenyra pretended to ignore how Harwin’s face darkened with each passing second.\n\nArnold’s hand pressed into her lower back, his thumb tracing along her spine. “I was at your marriage tour, you know. Your second one.”\n\n“I hardly remember it,” Rhaenyra lied. “I was forced into marriage by my council to secure my claim. Harwin was merely a convenient choice. Readily available.” Another lie.\n\nArnold didn’t catch her with it. “You have heirs, Princess, while Jeyne does not. Instead, she spends her time with Jessamyn…her dear companion.” It was hard to miss the bitter tone of his voice as he spoke about her. “The Eyrie rightfully belongs to me. And my Father and I plan to challenge her.”\n\nHis words were carefully selected, hinting at a plan he’d been crafting for months. And Rhaenyra didn’t doubt his ability to see it through.\n\nAs the song came to an end, Rhaenyra seized the opportunity to lean in close, her lips nearly brushing his earlobe. “Thank you,” she whispered softly, feeling him shiver. “For telling me this. When the time comes, please let me know.”\n\nRhaenyra exited the hall almost as quickly as she arrived, heading back to her chambers without sparing a glance towards Harwin, who had decided to follow her.\n\n“Rhaenyra,” he called out after her, but she ignored him, continuing to walk until they were well out of earshot. “Rhaenyra,” he repeated, his voice cracking as he said her name.\n\nShe turned around to face him. “Yes, Harwin?”\n\nHis brow furrowed as he gestured to the main hall, looking for answers to what just happened. “What was that?”\n\nRhaenyra shook her head, dismissing him. “It was nothing.”\n\n“Nothing,” Harwin repeated. A hint of jealousy laced his tone, and he didn’t bother to hide it.\n\nRhaenyra didn’t confirm or deny. She didn’t think she had to.\n\nThe flirtation with Arnold only made her feel disgusted, as if rot and decay were setting into her very bones. She could have explained this all to Harwin. But instead, she let her anger drive her, snapping back at him instead. Just to see what he’d do about it.\n\n“And…if it was something?” Rhaenyra challenged, raising an eyebrow. “What would you do?”\n\n“You know what I would do.”\n\nNot good enough.\n\nShe took a step forward, so close they were nearly touching. Harwin was so tall that she had to tilt her head back to meet his gaze. “I want to hear you say the words,” she said, her voice barely a whisper.\n\n“Why?” Harwin asked, but then quickly backtracked. He looked away, unable to meet her eyes any longer. It was too painful. “I don’t care what you have to do,” he admitted reluctantly. \"I’m not here to stand in your way.”\n\nShe blinked, taken aback. His answer surprised her - it was different from what she expected. He was so agreeable, while she was consumed by her own anger.\n\nRhaenyra crossed her arms. “Would it surprise you if I took another rider, considering how we started?”\n\nThere was a long pause before he answered. It was as though his worst fears were coming to light, and she was seeing just how far she could push him.\n\n“That was very different,” he said quietly.\n\nShe shook her head. “I’m not asking if it’s different. I’m asking if it would surprise you.”\n\n“You are free to do whatever you wish,” he said, though the words sounded forced. Insincere.\n\n“Is that so?”\n\n“That is the way of things.”\n\nRhaenyra let out a dry laugh. “Yes, I suppose lords can sire a dozen bastards and no one blinks an eye. If I had sired bastards with Laenor, however, the Greens would demand for my head on a spike. How quickly you forget how Jacaerys’s own parentage was so sharply questioned mere hours after his birth.”\n\nHarwin backed away and began pacing the narrow hallway in frustration. He didn’t want to have this conversation here, especially so close to prying ears. “I didn’t forget, I just-” He paused to run a hand through his dark curls. “Is there an answer that you’re looking for? Have I done something to offend you?”\n\n“Maybe I just want you to be angry at me.”\n\nHe let out an exasperated sigh, throwing up his hands in defeat. “Why? For defending you? For defending your birthright? The crown you’ve always wanted?”\n\n“Not just my birthright, Harwin,” Rhaenyra argued. “But Jacaerys’s, and his children, and his grandchildren. Our grandchildren. I am burdened by a prophecy I have no choice but to shoulder. It cannot exist without me, and yet, I fear I will be forgotten to the histories, desperate and grasping for power until I’m cold in my grave.”\n\nThere was a long moment of silence where neither of them knew what to say. Rhaenyra took a step back, and Harwin did the same. This was uncharted territory for them. They had never fought like this before, especially not about this.\n\n“Then give it up. I know you’ve considered it,” Harwin murmured quietly, breaking the silence. “No one will fault you for stepping down.”\n\nRhaenyra shook her head. “I will fault myself. And our children will be put to the blade. I now know there’s no other option but forward. And Alicent will block my way.” When Harwin opened his mouth to respond, she cut him off. “You promised to support me, and now you look like you regret that.”\n\nHis jaw dropped. “I came to the Vale in support of you, Rhaenyra. What more do you want?”\n\nThat was the thing - Rhaenyra wasn’t sure what she wanted. Perhaps she just wanted to be angry, even if that meant being childish. Perhaps she wanted to test him for some reason, to see if he would care. To see if Harwin would push her away, or if he would still accept her, even after he saw the ugliest parts of her.\n\nRhaenyra took a deep breath. “Would it bother you if I fucked him?”\n\nHarwin’s head snapped in her direction. “What?”\n\n“Would it bother you if I fucked Ser Arnold?” Rhaenyra repeated slowly, taking care to emphasize his name.\n\nHarwin didn’t know how to respond. Every answer would lead to heartbreak and defeat.\n\nHe took a sharp breath before answering, “No.” He stared at her, revealing absolutely nothing on his face, but the tightness of his jaw gave him away.\n\n“You’ve never lied to me before,” Rhaenyra admitted, then opened her chamber door. She gave him a knowing look. “And you’re not very good at it.”"
