        "text": "After the overthrow of Salvador Allende, in 1973, the Chilean director Raúl Ruiz emigrated to Paris. There, he became something of a cinematic ambassador for magical realism, bringing a welcome dose of fantasy to the French cinema. A prolific filmmaker who died in 2011, Ruiz is the subject of a retrospective at Film Society of Lincoln Center (it runs through Dec. 22). Its grandest revelation is “Time Regained” (Dec. 19), his sumptuous 1999 adaptation of the greatest modern French literary work, Marcel Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time.”\n\nRuiz distills Proust’s seven-volume work into a mere two hours and fifty minutes, centering the film on the final volume while ranging freely through its other books as well. The movie is constructed as a series of flashbacks from the bedridden author’s last days, when he’s struggling to complete that final volume. The ailing writer (André Engel), jogging his memory with a stack of photographs, conjures visions of himself as a precocious child (Georges Du Fresne) and then as an adult (Marcello Mazzarella) who frequents high-society realms while unsparingly chronicling and dissecting them.\n\nThe film’s fragments of action—much of it set amid the patriotic pomp and urbane corruption of the First World War—involve Marcel’s friendship with the Baron de Charlus (John Malkovich), who is in love with the young musician Charles Morel (Vincent Perez); the author’s long-broken engagement to Albertine (Chiara Mastroianni); his platonic relationship with Gilberte (Emmanuelle Béart) and with her husband, Robert de Saint-Loup (Pascal Greggory), who’s having an affair with Morel; and his shared confidences with the elderly Duchess de Guermantes (Édith Scob) and with Gilberte’s mother, Odette de Crécy (Catherine Deneuve), whose salon is a center of Marcel’s social life.\n\nWorking with a script that he co-wrote with Gilles Taurand, Ruiz turns the play of the author’s memory into a primordial Surrealism by way of bold visual analogies and sonic associations akin to rhymes. Throughout the film, Ruiz lets loose with a phantasmagorical barrage of audacious effects—including rear-screen projections that freeze the adult writer into a dashing posture while he rushes through shifting landscapes of his mind—that dramatize the very act of creation and, for that matter, the impact on Proust of the early cinema. (In one astounding scene, the writer is seemingly airborne in front of a movie screen, and meets his childhood self, who’s manipulating a movie projector.)\n\nBut “Time Regained” is also a triumph of classical cinematic values, reviving Proust’s era with an obsessive attention to detail: the trim of mustaches and the cut of collars, a cortège of umbrellas straight out of a painting by Renoir, and hypnotically opulent furnishings seemingly borrowed from movies of the era. Many of Ruiz’s films, such as “Three Crowns of the Sailor” (Dec. 20) and “City of Pirates” (Dec. 22), involve tricks of time and memory; working with Proust, Ruiz seems to mind-meld with him, raising his own artistry to exquisite new heights. ♦"
