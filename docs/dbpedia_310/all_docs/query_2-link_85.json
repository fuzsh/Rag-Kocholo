        "text": "Emily is still in Paris, Zack Snyder unleashes his latest “Snyder Cuts,” the Hargreeves children have to save the world one more time, the Terminator goes animated and a host of AMC gems are among the highlights of a busy month of new releases on Netflix.\n\nOn Aug. 1, the six-part mystery series A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder debuts on Netflix. In the show, Wednesday star Emma Myers (with a solid British accent!) plays a teenage gumshoe who gets to the bottom of a homicide case years earlier in a small English village in this adaptation of Holly Jackson’s popular YA novel. Created by Poppy Cogan the show has Miss Marple vibes and also stars Zain Iqbal, Asha Banks, Mathew Baynton, Gary Beadle and Anna Maxwell Martin.\n\nHoping to repeat the “Snyder Cut” magic on Aug. 2, Netflix releases director’s cut versions of Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire and Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver. Both director’s cut versions are R-rated, so expect much more violence and gore, particularly around Ed Skrein’s Admiral Noble character, as well as more scenes that better build out the world.\n\nThe fourth and final season of Netflix’s The Umbrella Academy launches Aug. 8. The superpowered Hargreeves children are tasked yet again with saving the world as they travel back and forth through time after the dramatic showdown at the Hotel Oblivion at the end of the last season. Season four, made up of six episodes, sees Nick Offerman Megan Mullally and David Cross join the cast.\n\nOn Aug. 15, we discover that Emily, as well as Mindy, Gabriel, Camille, Sylvie, Luc, Julien and Alfie, are still in Paris, as Netflix’s hit show Emily in Paris returns for its fourth season. Season four picks up after the dramatic events of Camille (Camille Razat) and Gabriel’s (Lucas Bravo) wedding, with Emily (Lily Collins) reeling as she has strong feelings for two men: Gabriel and Alfie (Lucien Laviscount). Emily in Paris season four will premiere in two, five-episode installments, with part one being released Aug. 15 and part two on Sept. 12.\n\nAug. 19 is a big day for Netflix, with a host of AMC originals hitting the platform for the first time, following a landmark deal between the two companies. AMC describes the deal as a “curated selection” of shows, which will be available for 12 months. First up, are The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season one, Anne Rice’s Interview With the Vampire season one, Anne Rice’s Mayfair Witches season one, Monsieur Spade season one, A Discovery of Witches seasons one to three, Dark Winds seasons one and two, Fear the Walking Dead seasons one through eight, Gangs of London seasons one and two, Into the Badlands seasons one to three, Kevin Can F*** Himself seasons one and two, Preacher seasons one through four, That Dirty Black Bag season one and The Terror season one.\n\nThe Terminator franchise gets a new lease of life Aug. 29, when Terminator Zero debuts on Netflix. The eight-episode series, the first Terminator animated project, hails from Japanese animation studio Production IG and is directed by Masashi Kudo. The show tells the story of Eiko, who has been sent back in time to protect scientist Malcolm Lee as he develops Kokoro, an advanced artificial intelligence, built as a rival to the malicious Skynet. The voice includes André Holland, Ann Dowd, Timothy Olyphant and Rosario Dawson.\n\nMovies added to Netflix in August include Fury, Godzilla Minus One/Minus Color, Jack Reacher, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Monster House, Mr. Deeds, The Next Karate Kid, The Emoji Movie, Red, Red 2, Room, Save the Last Dance, The Spectacular Now, Tarot, White Chicks and World War Z.\n\nMissed what came to Netflix last month?
