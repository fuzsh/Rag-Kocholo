        "text": "In 1978, Raúl Ruiz was commissioned to make a television documentary about the French elections from the viewpoint of a Chilean exile in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. But, contrary to the producers’ expectation, the Left lost. Ruiz seized on this anti-climax to make a documentary about nothing except itself – a film whose central subject is forever lost in digression and dispersal, harking back to his Chilean experiments of the ‘60s.\n\nThe film’s political content is deliberately left negligible: it’s hard to tell at the end, without external knowledge, who did actually win the election, let alone why.\n\nOf Great Events and Ordinary People is the best, and certainly the funniest, of reflexive deconstructions of the documentary form – and it remains astonishingly modern in an arena where the debates tend to turn very slowly around the same old chestnuts: reality/fiction, objectivity/subjectivity, intervention/distance, essay-film/cinéma-vérité ...\n\nRuiz’s special target here is television documentary. Ruiz drolly exaggerates every hare-brained convention of TV reportage, from shot/reverse shot suture and the use of talking-head experts, to establishing shots and vox pops (narrator’s note to himself: “Include street interviews ad absurdum”.) Every fragment of reality (eg., polling booths on voting day) comes through the lens as a prefabricated televisual cliché (“What we film, we have already filmed”).\n\nWhen a genuine TV news clip is included – a crazily kitsch extract from the election coverage, complete with tacky graphics and the countdown to a computed poll result – the effect is devastatingly hilarious. (It would be fascinating to compare Ruiz’s re-edit, from this same period, of typical tele-discussion footage in Images de debats [1979].)\n\nIf we were to peg Of Great Events and Ordinary People in its time and place, we could call it a film about simulacra – and indeed, uncredited on the soundtrack (according to Ruiz’s admission) lurks the voice of mirage-man Jean Baudrillard as one of the narrators (their friendship would later fray, as we learn from Ruiz’s diaries, when Jean B. leaned ever more to the political right).\n\nBut Ruiz increasingly spices up this Cubist lesson in documentary deconstruction with surreal elaborations – such as progressively shorter re-edits of the entire film, avant-garde decentrings of image and sound, and crazy runs of secondary elements such as particular colours, angles, gestures and camera movements (collect all shots that pan to the right … ).\n\nThe critical agenda tends to merrily lose itself in such diversions – which is a mercy in our relentless 21st century age of rigidly theory-driven essay-films. Some cinephile viewers will be especially diverted by the presence of expert witness Michael Rubbo – whose directorial career has taken him from groundbreaking New Journalism-inspired documentaries and features for children in 1960s Canada through to an intimate role in Chilean Marilú Mallet’s confessional classic Unfinished Diary (1982), and production of the high-flying Australian TV series Race Around the World (1997-1998) – on which I myself briefly appeared as a judge.\n\nBut this drift of detail in Of Great Events eventually winds itself into an arresting and rather unique structure. The first two-thirds poses as a diary of sorts, a record of ten days in which the filmmaker collects random materials. But suddenly, halting this reconnaissance, there is an eruption of footage from other films, as if invading the diegesis of the one we have been watching and following.\n\nThen Ruiz begins winding back, in various ways and in various orders, over the previous material: so that, now, the in-process diary has become a provisionally completed object. This is a paradoxical, atemporal form we find also in Godard: the always-already-made film meets the unfolding film-in-process-of-making-itself, which then meets what Ruiz here calls the “future documentary” or, as in the title of his 1997 short, the film to come.\n\nI cannot agree with those commentators who celebrate in Of Great Events a Bazinian residue of material reality amid the confusions of our spectacle-society – for there is not a single supposedly real moment that Ruiz does not mock, expose or save up for a switcheroo gag later.\n\nTake the category of “local colour” (or whimsical, suburban detail), for instance: when Ruiz is not nailing sociological clichés by duly reproducing them (such as interviewing the local newsagent, or a typical mum-with-kids), he matter-of-factly gives away the kinds of workaday, sleight-of-hand tricks that the media normally keep hidden – for instance, when the neighbourhood bar proves unavailable for filming, he simply substitutes a bar from somewhere else!\n\nOr, more subtly, Ruiz engages in a formalist undermining of the material, bringing pieces back in the montage but with a disquietingly just-slightly-different take – for reality is not meant to have alternate versions or out-takes!\n\nThe same goes for the deadpan treatment of spontaneity – supposedly the sovereign province of documentary – from a reflection on how many pauses are needed to create an “effect of the everyday”, to the riveting spectacle of Cahiers du cinéma critic Pascal Bonitzer (later an important script collaborator for Ruiz) fumbling to light a match as the Michael Snow-style 360-degree pan implacably rolls past him and his monologue …\n\nIn all this, Ruiz locates the wayward truth of documentary in its contradictory extremes: the only things that strike us as real within the realm of audio-visual spectacle are those moments when either nothing is happening (the banal ordinary) or history is inscribing itself hysterically (an event).\n\nMediating those extremes is the eye (and ear) of the filmmaker – but Ruiz does all he can here to detonate his burgeoning auteur status, right down to a strange, unreadable moment that admits to the “only autobiographical element” in the piece. But one is never less oneself, it seems, than when asked by the institution of television to perform oneself.\n\nAs an essay-film, Of Great Events contains many echoes – and a cheeky critique – of the sophisticated political filmmaking of Chris Marker and his comrades (in reality, Marker and Ruiz were friends and deeply respected each other). Where Marker’s & Pierre Lhomme’s Le Joli mai (1963) ends with a stirring left-humanist anthem – “As long as poverty exists, you are not rich; as long as despair exists, you are not happy; as long as prisons exist, you are not free” – Ruiz turns this sentiment around to a jaded reflection of modern complacency: “As long as poverty exists, I am rich; as long as despair exists, I am happy; as long as prisons exist, I am free”...\n\nThis nicely shifts the critique of documentary cinema, for a change, onto the documentary spectator – forever comfortably taking in images of oppression and misery on the History Channel.\n\nMORE Ruiz: Dark at Noon, That Day, Three Lives and Only One Death, Time Regained, Three Crowns of the Sailor, Shattered Image, The Tango of the Widower and Its Distorting Mirror, Mysteries of Lisbon, La noche de enfrente"
