        "text": "The seduction works in counterpoint to the opacity of the dialogue. The hypnotic voiceovers, which evoke B-movies by Jacques Tourneur or Edgar G. Ulmer, envelop us in the illusion of a coherent narrative, whereas there is only the surface of the screen. As a character in Three Crowns of the Sailor says: \"The world has two dimensions . . . the world is a lie.\" In this sublime film a sailor condemned to eternal exile searches for truth, for a meaning to his life.\n\nEthan Spigland\n\nDecember 9, 2016\n\nThis mid-period masterpiece by the Chilean expatriate unfolds over the course of single evening through a series of first-person flashbacks, nesting the fantastical within the historical in feverish, quintessentially Ruizian fashion... Crystalizing many of the sensorial flourishes he'd soon turn into shorthand, Ruiz pushes past the constants of verisimilitude only to arrive at one his most gut-wrenching finales.\n\nJordan Cronk\n\nMarch 11, 2015\n\nRaul Ruiz's compendium of old sea stories, drawn from Dinesen, Andersen, Stevenson, and Conrad, and knitted together into a tale of wonderful complexity... Paradoxes build on paradoxes and logic on illogic, and yet the game has a serious end, building toward a world stripped of substance, in which everything signifies but nothing means.\n\nDave Kehr\n\nMarch 11, 2015\n\nFuse\n\nThree Crowns of the Sailor stands in an ironic, undefined category of its own. The film elegantly plays with a bevy of traditional narrative structures – hence the pleasure and fascination it creates. Its apparent timelessness comes from its central trope: the _immortal_ story, a self-generating fiction.\n\nBérénice Reynaud\n\nJanuary 1, 1985"
