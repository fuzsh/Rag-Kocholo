        "text": "BUILDING A DREAM\n\nThe Hollywood studios were developed by T. Ince following the example of the Ford factory system (assembly line). The studios became manufacturers that specialized in dreams.\n\nThe period from 1927 (the end of the silent era) to 1948 (the end of the studios oligopoly) is considered the Golden Age of Hollywood. During this time, there were five companies that were considered the major studios: Paramount, MGM, Fox, Warner Brothers, and RKO. Three other companies were referred to as the smaller studios: Universal, Columbia, and United Artists. All of them owned back-lots, facilities, equipment, human resources, distribution channels and movie theater chains.\n\nBy controlling production, distribution and exhibition, the studios had achieved Vertical Integration, making them very powerful enterprises that were always able to sell the films they produced. To minimize competition in exhibition, the big five studios divided the country in five geographical areas assuring the control of the first run theaters.\n\nIndependent theaters were forced to rent packets formed by multiple films bundle together with one lead film, and the rest being a combination of less important A and B-movies. This practice was called Block Booking. Some times independent exhibitors were even forced to Blind Bidding, which meant having to rent films from distributors without seeing them, maybe just knowing their genre or the name of the star in them.\n\nIn the 1930s Hollywood dominated 80 % of the worlds' screens and new movies were premiered every week. The studios wanted to insure consistent productivity and quality, with predictable revenues. Assembly line techniques and mass production brought costs down, increasing profits. However, this formula also allowed for complete control of the product in the hands of the smallest group, the heads of production.\n\nThe studios had thousands of people on their payroll: actors, producers, directors, writers and technicians. Their hierarchical structure resembled a family, with the production chief heading the Front Office. Their grounds were run like a small city: some had their own fire department, their own chapel, and their own post-office.\n\nSound stages were in production twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, with three shifts per day, accommodating multiple productions at the same time. The lack of Unions meant that technicians worked for decades without days off. In the middle of the Great Depression, the only successful industry that never slept and did not know the meaning of the word unemployment was the \"Dream Factory\", Hollywood.\n\nWhile the head of any studio would run the day-to-day operations and had control of production in Los Angeles, most studios were part of major corporations and the ultimate power was in the hands of corporate presidents in New York City.\n\nDespite using the same techniques and production formulas, all studios were different. Each studio had an individual style that identified their product. Paramount specialized on sophisticated \"European\" comedies, many directed by German filmmakers that had left the UFA studios. Warner focused on urban melodramas with a fast pace, the type that could appear on the headlines of a newspaper.\n\nMGM was known for its lavish spectacles with big stars and glamorous art direction. Fox produced quality products that yielded a profit. Lastly RKO, the smallest of the majors, employed many independent filmmakers that mostly made musicals and special effects movies.\n\nIronically, the term Hollywood Style refers to a visual style so polished that it is invisible, in which camera techniques should not be noticeable, and editing had to be seamless.\n\nThe Hollywood studios saw actors as property. They were considered valuable investments: expensive, well trained and protected from any wrongdoing by the studio's legal department. Like anyone else, stars were also owned by the studios; under contract, they were sometimes loaned or traded to other studios.\n\nStars were created from scratch. The studios would change actors' names, their appearance, teach them how to do public speeches and perform for the camera, and would fabricate their social lives to increase the stars' box-office appeal. Bigger than life, most stars had fan clubs fueled by the studio's publicity department. The most profitable stars would gain some privileges regarding script approval, and selection of director, producer or cast.\n\nStars were classified into character types (i.e. the \"Latin Lover\", the \"dumb blond\", etc.) Those who did not want to be typecast would take on smaller but more challenging roles. Other stars would usually play themselves and were considered \"personality-stars\".\n\nThe studios developed all sorts of marketing strategies to best position their products. In addition to fun clubs, and absolute control of the press, the studios made movies that showed the best features of their most recognizable assets: the stars. Those movies were called \"star vehicles\".\n\nClark Gable, also known as the \"King of Hollywood\", Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich, Lionel Barrymore, and Jean Harlow were some of the biggest names of this era. Even some cartoon characters got start treatment, like Disney's Mickey Mouse and Snow White.\n\nAfter WWI, American audiences considered European films artsy, downbeat, very slow, even pessimistic. In the 1920s and 30s, following the taste of moviegoers, Hollywood focused on unpretentious, optimistic, fast moving, success stories. These movies were pure entertainment, allowing the viewers an escape from their own reality.\n\nThe third most important element for the studios to be profitable was the System of Genres. Genre films referred to popular story types with similar elements (i.e. western, musical, etc.) that people could identify easily, creating a group of followers. The Hollywood factory was making formula pictures; like in a cooking recipe, they would combine different ingredients (i.e. humor, romance and music) and would obtain predictable results.\n\nGenre pictures were, and still are, profitable because they were predictable: they follow a formula. Once the formula worked it was easy to imitate. With a simple substitution of some ingredients in the formula they studios would get a different movie! And the box-office would produce the expected results, with just a few exceptions. Most of these genre pictures were considered B-movies; with no stars and small budgets. It was easier to generate revenue. In addition to profits, Genre films became important to the studios because they were also used as testing grounds for new actors and directors without risking a big investment.\n\nDuring the Silent era the most profitable genres were westerns, slapstick comedies and melodramas with happy endings. Those genres never disappeared they just took a step back.\n\nA few changes took place during the Sound era, the first of which was very predictable: the Musical was born. The second change referred to the rise of Gangster films, but if we analyze those movies, they are basically westerns at heart. Lastly, Slapstick Comedies yielded their place to another form of comedy, the Screwball Comedy.\n\nWhile Silent movies only had a storyline before they were filmed, sound pictures required dialogue and the studios had several people writing the talkies, including producers, directors, stars and scriptwriters. Many films were adaptations of literary properties: theater plays, novels, and short stories. Most followed the rules of what became Classical cinema. It was based on the classic Greek theater and focused on the story with linear narrative structures in the form of a journey, a chase or a search. The conflict was set between the protagonist who initiated the action, and the antagonist who resisted it. The conflict escalated to the moment of maximum tension, the Climax, which was followed by a confrontation and resolution, and ended with any of the formal regular closures: death, return to normal or a happy event.\n\nSome of the criticism of the formula pictures was that many became a cliché, predictable and boring. Only some of the best producers demanded the creative idiosyncrasies of good stories. The rest were more focused on the revenues.\n\nDISINTEGRATION\n\nIn 1948, the vertical integration of the Hollywood studios got abolished. In an antitrust lawsuit the Supreme Court ordered the complete separation between the production-distribution and exhibition enterprises. It is known as the Paramount Decision. With this separation, Block Booking also came to an end.\n\nRKO was the first studio that began to sell their movie theater chains. This was because it was the studio with the least amount of theaters, and because the studio saw the opportunity to improve its status if the other studios with large amounts of theaters were forced to sell. RKO was followed by Paramount, and that became the end of the studio-lawyers' argument that \"it couldn't be done\".\n\nCoincidentally, the advent of Television during the same years brought another round of instability to the already rocky state of the film studios.\n\nNEW PLAYERS\n\nThe structures of Studio System were shaky, allowing for some changes to occur. Independent producers replaced the omnipotent figures of the production moguls. The Stars negotiated the end of their contracts and went independent, some creating their own production companies. Hollywood was about to face a radical transformation."
