        "text": "Halfway through 2024, we’ve already been treated to a rich banquet of TV—from the surprise success of Shõgun to the virality of the out-of-nowhere Baby Reindeer. Here’s our running list of the year’s best shows—many of them, Emmy nominees—and a sneak peek at the series we’re most excited about for the fall. You’ll find dramas and procedurals, sci-fi galore, and enough historical epics to keep you occupied.\n\nCriminal Record on Apple TV+ (January)\n\nIf you’re a soft target for British crime procedurals and have fond memories of the Scottish actor Peter Capaldi dominating Armando Ianucci’s classic political series The Thick of It, Apple TV+’s Criminal Record is just the thing. In this eight-episode London-based series, Capaldi and Cush Jumbo go toe to toe as warring detectives—veteran and rookie—re-litigating a high-profile murder case. —Taylor Antrim\n\nExpats on Prime Video (January)\n\nLulu Wang follows up her heartfelt 2019 film The Farewell with this rich and layered limited series. Like The Farewell, which told the story of a young Chinese American woman returning to China to spend time with her dying grandmother, Expats is (unsurprisingly) concerned with the experience of living between cultures. Here, the subjects again are Americans living abroad in Asia, a trio of women whose lives are intertwined with each other and with a random-seeming tragedy. The show resists easy categorization; in some ways, with its lush attention to the frenetic urban landscapes of modern-day Hong Kong, it bears the imprint of Wang’s previous creations, feeling like a vision-driven independent film. There’s a mystery associated with the tragedy, but this is hardly a whodunnit. Instead, it’s an examination of how people build a home in a foreign place, and how fragile those constructions can be. Nicole Kidman gives a harrowing performance as one of the trio of women, but it is Ji-young Yoo, playing a disaffected and aimless young Korean-American college graduate, who steals the show. —Chloe Schama\n\nFeud: Capote vs. The Swans on FX/Hulu (January)\n\nBased on historian Donald L. Miller’s bestseller, Masters of the Air follows the American bomber boys of the 100th Bomb Group (dubbed the Bloody Hundredth) as they engage in treacherous raids over Nazi Germany. Executive produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, the show has a traditional feel, foregrounding the psychological and emotional toll paid by these young men. But there’s plenty of visual splendor to luxuriate in, with directors like Dee Rees behind the camera and in front of it the impossibly coiffed crème of handsome young Hollywood (Barry Keoghan, Austin Butler, Callum Turner) and Colleen Atwood’s costumes (indulgent thick leather bombers with shearling collars). —Lisa Wong Macabasco\n\nMonsieur Spade on AMC+ (January)\n\nSome of us are prepared to travel wherever Clive Owen takes us, which in the case of the AMC+ crime series Monsieur Spade happens to be the south of France. These six episodes came to us from the writer-director-producer Scott Frank (The Queen’s Gambit) and tell the story of the iconic hardboiled detective Sam Spade (of Dashiell Hammett’s 1930 novel The Maltese Falcon) in retirement in Bozouls, where, bien sur, a group of nuns is murdered. Owen is dashing with a cigarette and suit, and the twisty plot pulls in Cold War, religious doings, and espionage. Satisfying, grown-up entertainment. —TA\n\nTrue Detective on Max (January)\n\nSet during the eternally dark and snowy days of late December in a remote Alaska town where Indigenous locals and a mining company coexist uneasily, the newest iteration of True Detective bears the closest resemblance to the thrilling first season 10 years ago. This time around, though, with Mexican writer and director Issa López at the helm, women are the heavies: Jodie Foster brandishes the badge for the first time since Silence of the Lambs 32 years ago, while real-life pro boxing champ Kali Reis more than holds her own as her tough-as-hell partner. Both are haunted by ghosts from their traumatic pasts as they attempt to solve a grisly massacre at a scientific outpost. It’s the perfect binge, not to mention scary as hell, and both True Detective diehards and those who have never heard of “time is a flat circle” are sure to enjoy the eerie, supernatural, supremely satisfying ride. —LWM\n\nThe Woman in the Wall on Showtime (January)\n\nRuth Wilson can be an incendiary performer—who could forget her turn as a manipulative psychopath in Luther?—and she’s at full boil here in this BBC mystery (airing in the US on Showtime and streaming on Paramount+). We’re in a small village in Ireland, where Wilson’s troubled character, Lorna Brady, suffers from extreme bouts of sleepwalking—and wakes up one day to find a corpse in her home. This crime connects to the trauma in her past: as a teenager she was sent to one of Ireland’s notorious Magdalene Laundries to conceal a pregnancy. Bereaved and borderline insane, Brady may be a killer, or whoever murdered one of the village’s priests in Dublin may be responsible. The appealing and mordantly witty Daryl McCormack is the detective trying to untangle it all. —TA\n\nConstellation on Apple TV+ (February)\n\nApple’s streaming service continues to take big swings with sci-fi; check out Foundation, Invasion, or Silo…or don’t! For all of their ambition, none of Apple’s splashy sci-fi series have so far become essential viewing. But Constellation is absolutely worth your time: a space-drama-meets-conspiracy-thriller starring the always-good Noomi Rapace and Jonathan Banks (whom we loved in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul). The UK writer Peter Harness is behind the eight-episode series, and the promise of his track record (McMafia, Wallander, Dr. Who) pays off with an unsettling story that twists through space exploration, high-level physics, and the spooky sense that reality itself is coming undone. It’s just a shame that Apple TV+ has decided not to renew it. —TA\n\nDrive to Survive, Season 6 on Netflix (February)\n\nThe hugely popular F1 racing series that started the whole reality-TV-sports documentary craze has come back for a speedy, escapist sixth season. If you’re an F1 fan you already know what went down during the 2023 season, but Drive to Survive is so well-paced and edited that reliving it is nothing but pleasure. —TA\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith on Prime Video (February)\n\nPrime Video’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith stars Donald Glover and Pen15’s Maya Erskine as a pair of spies navigating dangerous weekly missions—often around New York, where they’re based in a gorgeous townhouse, but also sometimes in the dramatically beautiful Dolomites, or the Costa Rican jungle, or on the shores of Lake Como—while also attempting to maintain their arranged marriage, one that quickly evolves from a strange shared burden to a font of real passion and pleasure, as well as conflict and competition. The 2005 film of the same name, starring Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, inspired this series, but Glover and Erskine are doing entirely their own thing—and the results feel exciting and fun. Plus, the show boasts a murderers’ row of supporting actors, among them Sarah Paulson (fabulous as a batty couples therapist), Alexander Skarsgård, John Turturro, Sharon Horgan, Paul Dano, Michaela Coel, and Parker Posey. —Marley Marius\n\nThe New Look on Apple TV+ (February)\n\nCan fashion history make for compelling drama? The New Look, a series from Apple TV+ that begins in Paris under Nazi occupation and charts the rise of Christian Dior after WWII, brings star power and a veteran TV creator to the task. Here is Ben Mendelsohn as an exquisitely dignified Dior, working in obscurity for the couturier Lucien Lelong (and reluctant to design dresses for Nazi wives), and Juliette Binoche as his high-profile rival Coco Chanel, comporting with members of the Third Reich and living at the Ritz. The creator is the genre specialist Todd Kessler, known for pulpy entertainments like Damages and Bloodline, though with The New Look he’s aiming for something more high-minded and polite (think The Crown, but with fashion designers instead of royals). The series has escapist sweep and is packed with familiar faces: Emily Mortimer as socialite Elsa Lombardi, John Malkovich as Lelong, Maisie Williams as Dior’s sister Catherine (arrested and imprisoned at a concentration camp), and Claes Bang as Chanel’s aristocratic Nazi boyfriend, Baron Hans Gunther von Dincklage. Mendelsohn is the moral and creative hero, but the striving, anything-to-survive Binoche gives the series a ruthless spark. —TA\n\nOne Day on Netflix (February)\n\nIn the quest for the next culture-dominating Game of Thrones-esque series, consider Netflix’s big bet: 3 Body Problem, an adaptation of Chinese novelist Liu Cixin’s 2008 science fiction novel (the tote-around paperback for the haute-nerd set). It’s no small thing to transform Cixin’s extremely complex, time-jumping, alien-invasion story to the screen, but this is a show with ambition on hyperdrive: among the clutch of big name producers, none other than David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (of Thrones) serve as writer/producers, along with Alexander Woo, who was responsible for the excellent The Terror: Infamy. —TA\n\nThe Gentlemen on Netflix (March)\n\nGuy Ritchie returns! Sometimes you just want to cheer the streamers for handing over a big budget to someone with the verve and vision of Ritchie. Another White Lotus star, an extremely charismatic Theo James, is the second son of a recently departed duke, who (first episode mild spoiler here) is unexpectedly named his father’s heir. The reasoning quickly becomes apparent as the extent of the first son’s dissolute disfunction unfolds. Further revelations ensue: namely, a criminal operation that is part of the inheritance. Ritchie feels like he’s back in beloved territory, among the charming rakes and bullish thugs of the British underworld. The British actor Kaya Scodelario (perhaps, like me, you remember her as the singular Effy from Skins) is creepy and convincing as a woman confidently navigating that seedy scene. —CS\n\nGirls 5Eva, Season 3 on Netflix (March)\n\nIf you’re in the market for a sitcom that packs in maximum jokes per minute, à la 30 Rock or The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, look no further than this Peacock series (now available on Netflix) that chronicles the improbable mid-40s reunion of an early-aughts girl group. Girls5Eva admittedly took a few episodes to find its footing, but its highly Tina Fey-influenced comedic voice and bevy of magnetically watchable stars (Renée Elise Goldsberry playing a clear piano! Busy Philipps as a dippy influencer type! Paula Pell, enough said!) make it well worth seeking out. —Emma Specter\n\nManhunt on Apple TV+ (March)\n\nThe reason to put Manhunt on your to-watch list is its 49-year-old star, Tobias Menzies, recently of The Crown and Outlander and You Hurt My Feelings and a clutch of TV shows before that (This Way Up, Catastrophe, The Terror)—each one of them worth watching precisely because of the steady, slightly raffish sophistication that Menzies brings to any project he’s in. Manhunt is an adaptation of a nonfiction bestseller about the hunt for President Lincoln’s killer in 1865, and Menzies plays Edwin Stanton, Lincoln’s Secretary of War and the lead detective—of a kind—in the search for the man who pulled the trigger, John Wilkes Booth. Call it true-crime-meets-historical fiction. —TA\n\nPalm Royale on Apple TV+ (March)\n\nCall it the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel effect: a certain type of TV show that presents a super-saturated, candy-coated vision of the past. Palm Royale, which stars Kristin Wiig as a beauty pageant queen who marries up, sets its sights on Palm Beach society. Like a Lilly Pulitzer fever dream, the show is awash in tangerine and flamingo pink, a confectionary visual delight. The plot is nominally an outsider narrative, with Wiig’s character attempting to infiltrate the upper echelons of that milieu, but it’s really the fashion and the slightly camp but still enjoyable performances from the cast (Allison Janney, Laura Dern, Kaia Gerber, Ricky Martin—does the man ever age?) that keep the show afloat. —CS\n\nFallout on Prime Video (April)\n\nVideo-game TV adaptations are usually a case of hype cycles run amok—even though HBO’s The Last of Us was a genuine prestige-TV hit in 2023 (and has been renewed for a second season). Prime Video’s adaptation of the post-apocalyptic role-playing game Fallout has gold plated executive producers, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy of Westworld, and proved to be an interesting stew of cowboy action, robot mayhem, and kooky world-building. —TA\n\nRipley on Netflix (April)\n\nAnother recycled story that holds its own appeal. This time the beloved Andrew Scott stars as Tom Ripley in an adaptation of the gripping Patricia Highsmith novel. Scott is joined by Dakota Fanning and Johnny Flynn, and the sun-soaked palette is replaced by an austere black-and-white scheme. Written and directed by Steven Zaillian, creator of the gripping and dark HBO procedural The Night Of, this Ripley has a distinctly noir feel, and a different tone overall than the sun-drenched Matt Damon and Jude Law version. Scott delivers a subtle and sinister performance. —CS\n\nUnder the Bridge on Hulu (April)\n\nBased on acclaimed author Rebecca Godfrey’s gripping 2005 bestseller, Under the Bridge recounts the true story of 14-year old Reena Virk (Vritika Gupta), who in 1997 went to meet friends at a party and never returned home. Trailing Godfrey (played by Riley Keough) and a local British Columbia police officer (Oscar nominee Lily Gladstone), the series delves into the hidden world of the young girls accused of the murder, revealing shocking truths about the unlikely killer.—LWM\n\nBaby Reindeer on Netflix (May)\n\nWould you believe it? Another reality-bending sci-fi-esque thriller from Apple TV+ (see also Constellation, Severance, Invasion, Silo). Dark Matter could seem like run-of-the-mill prestige TV—adapted from a bestselling book (by Blake Crouch), noir-ish in look and tone—except its cut-above cast raises the stakes. The usually excellent Joel Edgerton plays a physics professor who slips into an alternate reality and has to fight his way back to save his wife, played by Jennifer Connelly. —TA\n\nHacks, Season 3 on Netflix (May)\n\nWith its third season, Hacks overcame the nearly impossible feat of topping itself. After a strong sophomore season, many viewers wondered how the odd-couple comedy would continue its trajectory. Now, it’s clear there was no reason to worry. The show’s latest installment is funnier, smarter, and more poignant than ever, especially thanks to Jean Smart, who delivers bigger laughs and gut punches as Deborah Vance—whether she’s turning an NA meeting into a tight 10, or scheming to get her own late-night show. The promotion of Meg Stalter and Paul W. Downs to series regulars has added a delightful B-plot to the series, and Hannah Einbinder continues to bring greater depth to Ava with every passing episode. Lucky for us a fourth season is on its way.—Hannah Jackson\n\nBabylon Berlin, Season 4 on MHz Choice (June)\n\nThe first two seasons of this brilliant German-language crime epic set during the Weimar Republic debuted back in Netflix’s halcyon, try-anything days (before the Floor is Lava era). It was one of the most rewarding discoveries on streaming, and acquainted American audiences with the charisma of its lead actors, Liv Lisa Fries and Volker Bruch, whose characters worked for the Berlin police, uncovering misdoings (Fries’s Charlotte Ritter was also a part-time prostitute). Season 3 later appeared on Netflix before the series disappeared from the platform altogether. Now all three seasons have returned on the service MHz Choice (which, if you’re into Euro TV, is well worth a trial subscription). The new Season 4, which brings Weimar Berlin ever closer to the grip of Nazism—heretofore unavailable to US viewers—will debut in June. —TA\n\nThe Bear, Season 3 on FX/Hulu (June)\n\nThe third season of The Bear, focused on the titular restaurant’s rocky first months of operation, proved its most divisive yet. At times the show abandoned the larger plot for more intimate character studies, leaving viewers yearning for some form of resolution in Carmy and Claire’s relationship, Carmy and Richie’s relationship, and Carmy’s relationships with pretty much everyone else. But the choice also gave us my favorite episodes of the season, “Napkins,” a closer look at Liza Colón-Zayas’s Tina (and Ayo Edebiri’s directorial debut) and “Ice Chips,” which follows Natalie, a.k.a Sugar (Abby Elliott), as she is forced to lean on her mother, Donna (Jamie Lee Curtis), for support when she goes into labor. Let’s just consider Season 3 an amuse-bouche; with Season 4 already filmed, we know the main course is on the way. —HJ\n\nBlue Lights, Season 2 on BritBox (June)\n\nYou can watch this show with intimate familiarity with the book and Harrison Ford film, or you can come to it—as I did—with absolutely none, and fully enjoy it. (We ran an experiment with a sample size of two in our household, and this was our definitive conclusion.) It’s not that surprising, actually, when you consider the caliber of the cast: Jake Gyllenhaal as the wrongfully (or is he???) accused lawyer fending off a life-damning murder charge; Ruth Negga as his long-suffering wife; Peter Sarsgaard as the smarmy colleague out to get him; the luminous Renate Reinsve (The Worst Person In the World) as the murdered girlfriend; Bill Camp—a revelation—as the lawyer and best friend defending Gyllenhaal’s character. It’s a powerhouse collection, and they are all doing their part to weave together this supremely watchable and classy show. The story seems to be setting itself up for resolution in the final episode, but with a second season already announced, we can look forward to more suspense to come. —CS\n\nTour de France: Unchained, Season 2 on Netflix (June)"
