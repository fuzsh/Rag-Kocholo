        "text": "THREE CROWNS OF THE SAILOR\n\nDir. Raúl Ruiz, 1983\n\nFrance, 117 min.\n\nIn French with English subtitles\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 5 – 7:30 PM\n\nMONDAY, MARCH 16 – 10 PM\n\nFRIDAY, MARCH 20 – 7:30 PM\n\nSUNDAY, MARCH 22 – 7:30 PM\n\nOne of the 1980s’ art house masterpieces, Raúl Ruiz’s THREE CROWNS OF THE SAILOR is an absolutely absurd if not profound ghost ship tall tale that sails on a existential nonsense map to nowhere. Spoken in strange code, most of the cryptic language answers questions that were never asked and revels in its fractured fake histories. It is a story that is on another realm with multiverses being pulled through a singular and revelations of alternate characters that may have not existed. The film comes as a strategic stream of conscience that tries to shoe lace faded memories to the fragmented damaged stories. THREE CROWNS OF THE SAILOR is filled to the brim with over complicated ideas and none of them would work if humor and a grain of salt wasn’t included."
