        "text": "University of Minnesota Twin Cities College of Science and Engineering Professor Bharat Jalan was named an American Vacuum Society (AVS) Fellow. The prestigious fellowship recognizes AVS members who have made outstanding scientific and technical contributions.\n\nJalan, who holds the Shell Chair in the University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, received the award in recognition of his groundbreaking contributions to materials science and condensed matter physics through the invention and development of Hybrid Molecular Beam Epitaxy (Hybrid MBE), an experimental method for synthesizing quantum materials.\n\nThis innovative method has revolutionized the synthesis of complex oxide thin films, addressing long-standing challenges in materials science. Some of these challenges include maintaining stoichiometry, or the proportions in which elements or compounds react with one another, and achieving full oxidation of hard-to-oxidize elements.\n\nJalan’s research has applications in the areas of materials science, materials chemistry, physics, and engineering, and provides the fundamental science needed to develop the next generation of quantum and electronic devices. His research has garnered international attention, influencing both industry and academia, and solidifying his position at the forefront of materials synthesis.\n\nIn the past, Jalan has received numerous awards including the 2023 Schieber Prize from the International Organization of Crystal Growth (IOCG); a 2022 Invitation to National Academy of Engineering Frontiers of Engineering Symposium; the 2021 Peter Mark Memorial Award from the American Vacuum Society (AVS); 2020 and 2018 TechConnect Innovation awards; the 2019 Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE); the 2017 AVS Paul Holloway Young Investigator Award; and the 2016 Air Force Office of Science Research Young Investigator Award to name a few.\n\nJalan joined the faculty at the University of Minnesota in 2011 and was named a full professor in 2022. He received a bachelor’s dual degree in materials science from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras in 2006 and a Ph.D. degree in materials science from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2011.\n\nAVS fellows will be recognized at an awards ceremony during the AVS 70th International Symposium and Exhibition in Tampa, Fla., in November 2024.\n\nRead more about the fellowship and see the full list of recipients on the AVS website."
