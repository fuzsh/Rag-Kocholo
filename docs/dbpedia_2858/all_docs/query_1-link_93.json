        "text": "Recently, I came across this comment on a Huffington Post article about nonprofit salaries:\n\n“Here’s why I don’t donate to non-profits. There is no legal cap to the salaries paid to executives. Really? Do y’all think I donated to feed the pig CEO, or the needy? See a poor person in the street, give them the money. They may buy a bottle, but at least they will see the money, with no strings attached.”\n\nAt some level, he has a point.\n\nIf the goal of a nonprofit is to solve a societal problem, shouldn’t as much money as possible go directly to the people being helped? Isn’t it true that every dollar paid to the “pig” CEO is a dollar pulled away from achieving the mission?\n\nIt’s exactly this commenter’s attitude that makes nonprofits frightened about “overhead.” I’ve written before about whether nonprofit overhead is too high. Today I want to explore something a bit more specific.\n\nIs it inappropriate for nonprofit leaders to be well paid? And how can nonprofits – especially smaller ones that don’t have big budgets — navigate this dilemma?\n\nI WAS ONCE A WELL PAID NONPROFIT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\nAs you may know, in the years before I started Joan Garry Consulting, I served as the Executive Director at GLAAD, a mid-size gay rights nonprofit.\n\nDuring my tenure, a leading publication conducted an annual survey of the salaries of executive directors in our particular sector. My colleagues and I dreaded the day this article hit the newsstand every year.\n\nWhy?\n\nNo one wanted to be at the top of the list.\n\nHit the top and you became a target. Your board starts asking questions about comparable compensation and folks in general just start making comments – and not of the “you’re worth every penny” variety.\n\nI call this phenomenon “salary angst.”\n\nSalary angst doesn’t happen in the private sector. CEOs fight for the honor of making the biggest salary. Right or wrong, it’s considered a measure of effectiveness. It means you’re a good negotiator. Companies fall over themselves to pay more money to attract the candidates they consider the best.\n\nNot remotely so in the nonprofit sector.\n\nOne year I hit the #1 spot on the salary survey. Ugh. Salary angst.\n\nWhat made this even worse was that GLAAD wasn’t the largest organization in the movement. Why should I be making so much money? Never mind that it was a major pay cut from what I made in the private sector before I came aboard.\n\nI found myself having to justify being well compensated. It made no difference that I had been, by many measures, an effective leader, manager, strategist, public voice, and movement leader.\n\nWhile I no longer work as an executive director, I sure do work with a lot of them. Some of them feel a sense of guilt at making a semi-reasonable salary. Others resent making so little. But for most of them, their salary isn’t something they feel particularly good about. They have serious salary angst.\n\nThis has big consequences.\n\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SALARY ANGST\n\nNonprofits exist in a free market. They need to be competitive in order to attract the best talent.\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\nBig companies pay big bucks.\n\nStartups attract outstanding leaders by offering company shares that can eventually make the CEO very rich.\n\nStrong leadership is not just important for a nonprofit – it’s absolutely critical. This person is the voice and face of your organization. The strategist. The visionary. The lead fundraiser. The advocate. A leader in your sector.\n\nWithout strong leadership, nonprofits die.\n\nSo no – it’s not true that every dollar paid to the “pig” CEO is a dollar pulled away from achieving the mission. To the contrary, a healthy nonprofit with outstanding leadership will be able to help more people in a more effective and bigger way for a much longer time. They achieve their missions faster.\n\nWhen a terrific leader from the private sector is considering a position at a nonprofit, there’s only so much of a pay cut she’s usually willing to take. Yes, it’s an opportunity to do good in the world… to make a real difference… and that has serious value all by itself. But that doesn’t put her kids through college. And there are plenty of ways to do good in the world while working in the private sector and making a lot more money.\n\nDo you see how short sighted nonprofits shoot themselves in the foot by not paying competitive salaries to their top leaders?\n\n6 WAYS NONPROFITS MAKE THEIR LEADERS FEEL SALARY ANGST\n\nBoards that overly focus on reducing overhead at the cost of not attracting the very best available leadership tend to screw up contract discussions. This is a great way to make the leader feel the salary angst. It’s also the fast lane to a leadership exit.\n\nFor example:\n\nThey avoid salary discussions. When the ED has to nag the board chair to remind her that it is well past 12 months since the last annual review and compensation discussion. No one ever wants to nag the boss for a raise.\n\nThe process takes forever. It never feels like it is taking forever to board members. They are busy people and lose track. Meanwhile the ED sits and waits. And gets frustrated and feels de-valued.\n\n“Conversations” happen via email. Discussions about how much money you make should not happen in email. Email is voiceless, toneless, and never can communicate the sense of value and appreciation that ED’s need to hear.\n\nBoard Chairs say “You know our organization can’t afford to do any more.” If I’m an ED, I hear that and realize that my board is not making any connection between my salary and their ability to fundraising aggressively on behalf of the organization. And you know how I feel? Really angry.\n\nBoard member says “The joy and privilege of working at a nonprofit has to be considered as part of your compensation.” It is a joy and a privilege but don’t let this one go if someone says it. As I wrote before, there are lots of ways to do good and important things in this world. Why should the ED want to stay at this nonprofit.\n\nYour spouse’s high paying job is mentioned during your salary negotiation. This happens more than you’d imagine. Honestly, it’s offensive. What your spouse makes has nothing to do what you should make. NOTHING. It’s wishful thinking on your board’s part that you’d work for cheap (or free?) But why should you? You are a high performing ED. You have power in these discussions. If I found myself in that position, I’d either say, “I’m going to pretend you didn’t say that” or “That comment and information is both irrelevant and offensive.”\n\nHOW CAN SMALLER NONPROFITS DEAL WITH SALARY ANGST?\n\nHere’s the dilemma. It’s all well and good to say that nonprofits need to pay competitive salaries. Perhaps you’re thinking, “I’m sure a UNICEF or Red Cross can afford to do that. But I work at a 6-person nonprofit with less than a million dollars in revenues. Do you actually expect us to pay 25% of our total budget to the Executive Director?”\n\nIt’s true. Smaller organizations may not be able to compensate their EDs as well as they deserve. There are hundreds of thousands of 501c3 organizations in the US with budgets under $500,000.\n\nPrivate sector startups without much or any revenue handle this by offering stock options. That’s not something nonprofits can do.\n\nBut what you can do is make the ED feel like a million bucks. At the end of the day, it’s the combination of a reasonable wage and solid value and appreciation that will fire up an ED to deliver a five-star performance.\n\nHere are 8 things smaller nonprofits can do to make their EDs feel valued, especially if they’re not in a position to offer competitive salaries.\n\nAnnual review. Formal and on time. Get out in front and alert your ED that you know it’s coming up. Don’t make the ED nag.\n\nOffer a contract. Ask your ED if she would like a 2 or 3 year contract. Just the request alone tells her that you want her to stay and value her contribution.\n\nGet creative about money. Maybe the organization cannot afford a raise. Tell her that and also tell her that the board is going to take responsibility for a year-end bonus of some sort based on some simple achievements. Then, unbeknownst to the ED, each board member gives (stretches if they have to) to reach a very nice amount. Can you imagine how much that would mean to an ED?\n\nTime off. Add more vacation time. And then it must be the board chair’s obligation to check in and ensure that it is being taken.\n\nGet creative about assets. Consider assets that the board has that can be part of a compensation package. A one-week vacation at a board member’s second home while the board member is out of town. Or even a long weekend.\n\nMake sure the salary is reasonable. Do your homework. Be sure your ED is being paid on par with other nonprofit ED’s in your size and geography.\n\nRespond. Make a board commitment to respond to every ‘success’ email the ED sends (if you believe you can deliver on it). ED’s talk all the time about the “radio silence” they get to exciting emails about program successes. If a board could change that dynamic, the level of appreciation an ED feels skyrockets.\n\nOffer a sabbatical. How about a month off with pay? Great way to test drive the organization with the board and other staff driving. Great way for an ED to re-charge. Note: Please give this some thought and not through a corporate or even an academic lens. Boards often reject this out of hand because it is not in their frame of reference. Don’t take my work for it. Read this article from the Stanford Social Innovation Review.\n\nA FINAL THOUGHT\n\nTo all of you who sit on a board, a search committee. To search firms. To EDs who are timid about salary negotiations.\n\nTo everyone in the nonprofit world who has salary angst.\n\nLet’s revisit the comment I mentioned at the beginning.\n\n“Here’s why I don’t donate to non-profits. There is no legal cap to the salaries paid to executives. Really? Do y’all think I donated to feed the pig CEO, or the needy? See a poor person in the street, give them the money. They may buy a bottle, but at least they will see the money, with no strings attached.\n\nThis is what we are up against.\n\nIf you are a board member and feel even the slightest bit of this, it is time for a serious attitude adjustment.\n\nThink of it this way. As a board member, you are an ‘owner’ of the enterprise. The success of all of you is dependent on the folks at the top and their ability to deliver on the promise. Whether you run a tiny, mid sized or large organization.\n\nPlease start thinking that way. Put yourselves in the shoes of your current leader and remember:\n\nYour leader is outstanding. He has plenty of other options. And the joy and privilege of service is actually NOT priceless."
