        "text": "Bridget Rogers, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, has been elected president of the American Vacuum Society (AVS). She will serve a three-year term as president-elect in 2024, president in 2025, and past president in 2026.\n\n“I am proud to have been an active AVS member for almost 35 years. My AVS experiences have led to collaborations and friendships that have lasted decades,” Rogers said. “I will work with AVS leaders and the Board of Directors to build on our experience and the talents of our diverse membership to leverage the renewed interest in domestic manufacturing to strengthen all aspects of the AVS.”\n\nRogers has been active in the AVS since 1989 and has held responsibilities at all levels, including local chapter, division and group, national-level committees, Board of Directors and Trustees. She currently is on the executive committee for Manufacturing Science and Technology Technical Group. She was elected an AVS fellow in 2009.\n\nRogers’ research focuses on the formation, characterization and microstructure evolution of surfaces, interfaces and films of technically important materials to determine a materials performance in a targeted application. During the last five summers Roger’s has shared her expertise working as a Faculty Fellow with the Sensors Directorate of the Air Force Research Labs in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nPrior to joining the Vanderbilt engineering faculty, Rogers worked in Motorola’s semiconductor products sector for 14 years in positions that included process engineering, process development, device engineering and materials characterization.\n\nRogers’ awards and honors include a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) in 2004, and a National Science Foundation Career Award in 2001. She received the Distinguished Faculty Award from the Vanderbilt University Organization of Black Graduate and Professional Students in 2016.\n\nAVS is comprised of approximately 4,500 members worldwide among academic, industrial, government and consulting professionals involved in emerging interdisciplinary research related to materials, interfaces and processing.\n\nContact: brenda.ellis@vanderbilt.edu"
