From the harm caused by oppressive traditions like female genital mutilation (FGM) and child marriage, the authoritarianism of illiberal ideologies, and Islamist violence, the foundations of our society are rupturing, while many stand by silently as they watch our hard-won freedoms slipping away.\n\nAHA Foundation refuses to remain silent. We have over 15 years of expertise and a proven track record in protecting womenâ€™s rights, defending free speech, and exposing Islamist extremism. We are the national leader in tackling FGM.\n\nAs a non-partisan organization, we believe that these fights can be won only when we stand together, regardless of our political affiliations. By standing with us, you support a vision of a world where universal human rights reign supreme over tyranny, tribalism, and oppression of all kinds.\n\n_____________"
