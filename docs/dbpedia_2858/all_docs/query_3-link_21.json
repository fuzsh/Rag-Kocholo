        "text": "In January, OCSEF announced 22 special awards to be given at the 66th Annual Orange County Science & Engineering Fair by donors and organizations that promote and advocate STEM excellence. The Southern California Chapter of the American Vacuum Society (ACCAVS) Award was given to two students in 2020, and we are very grateful for the return of the AVS to the fair this year as well.\n\nThe Southern California Chapter of the American Vacuum Society (SCCAVS) is dedicated to promoting the fields of vacuum science and vacuum-related technologies through technical symposia, educational outreach, and other programs that encourage discussions and provide topical information to members in this region.\n\nSCCAVS is committed to serving the Southern California technical community through technical symposia, educational outreach, and other programs that provide information to members and non-members in their region. Their areas of interest include vacuum science and vacuum-related technologies, surface and thin film science, nanotechnology, the understanding of materials properties, and the development of new materials.\n\nMembers of the SCCAVS are from industry, academia, government, and equipment sales and marketing. Membership to the local chapter may be obtained through the National AVS organization. SCCAVS members and non-members are welcome to attend the chapterâ€™s monthly executive board meeting, which provides an opportunity both to contribute to and make new connections with the Southern California technical community. The discussions focus on developing activities such as speaker meetings, technical workshops, science fairs, newsletter, field trips and the annual symposium and equipment exhibition.\n\nThe organization also offers an AVS Technical Library which provides convenient online access to AVS conference presentations as well as online educational training in fields related to materials, processing, and interfaces (Recommended Practices, books, monographs, videos, webinars, virtual programs, etc.).\n\nAVS is known for its community feeling, and advancement of a broad range of high quality science and technology in the fields of materials, processing, and interfaces. Each year, AVS hosts local and international meetings and exhibits, publishes four journals, honors members through its awards and recognition program. With so many outlets that they offer you can always stay up to date.\n\nAVS also offers scholarships. The Elmer Carvey Memorial Scholarship is awarded to undergraduate students attending public, four-year colleges in California. The stipend is $1,500 for one year and is applied toward tuition during the 2021-2022 school year. Applications from students in physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, whose desired career goals are in areas of interest to the society are encouraged. High school seniors and current college students may apply."
