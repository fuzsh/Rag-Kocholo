        "text": "Non-profits & Social Entrepreneurship\n\nBridging Disciplines Programs allow you to earn an interdisciplinary certificate that integrates area requirements, electives, courses for your major, internships, and research experiences.\n\nThe Non-profits & Social Entrepreneurship BDP brings together students who are interested in pursuing a career in the public service sector and expanding their involvement in the community. Non-profit leaders for the 21st century must increasingly understand the blurring of lines among private, government, and non- profit sectors.\n\nUpon completion of 19 credit hours from the options listed below, you will earn a certificate in Non-profits & Social Entrepreneurship.\n\nThis program’s title has recently been changed from Social Entrepreneurship & Non-Profits. Students graduating in Fall 2024 or later will receive a certificate in Non-profits & Social Entrepreneurship. Students graduating before Fall 2024 will receive a certificate in Social Entrepreneurship & Non-Profits.\n\nNote: Course descriptions available here are from a recent offering of the course, and they may not reflect the description for the next offering of the course.\n\nView all courses\n\nForum Seminar Courses (1 credit hours)\n\nAll students in the Non-profits & Social Entrepreneurship BDP are required to take the Forum Seminar.\n\nFoundation Courses (6 credit hours)\n\nYou must take a total of six credit hours from the Non-profit Foundations and/or Social Entrepreneurship Foundations categories. Feel free to take courses from either or both of these categories, depending on your interests and the skills you would like to develop.\n\nConnecting Experiences (6 - 9 credit hours)\n\nYour BDP advisor can help you find internships and research opportunities that connect Non-profits & Social Entrepreneurship to your major, and that connect the content area of your Strand with the issues and skills explored in the Foundation Courses. We call these opportunities “Connecting Experiences” because they play such an important role in integrating your studies.\n\nAt least one of your two required Connecting Experiences (3 credit hours each) must have a research emphasis. This can either be a research Connecting Experience, or an internship Connecting Experience in which your internship responsibilities include a research project. Examples of research projects an intern might assist with include, but are not limited to: market research, researching new funding sources, researching a problem for the need statement of a grant proposal, conducting an evaluation to measure the success of a program, research that validates new engagement strategies, or developing a proposal for a new program or initiative.\n\nFor more information and for examples of past Connecting Experiences, visit the BDP website and consult your BDP advisor. BDP students must propose Connecting Experiences to the BDP office. Current BDP students should view the BDP Advising Canvas site for Connecting Experience resources and proposal instructions.\n\nStrand Courses (3 - 6 credit hours)\n\nIn addition to your Foundation Courses and Connecting Experiences, you must complete 3-6 credit hours of approved Strand Courses, to bring your total credit hours toward the BDP certificate to 19 hours. You should work with your BDP advisor to choose Strand Courses that will focus your BDP on your specific interests, and that will provide you with an interdisciplinary perspective on your BDP topic.\n\nYou have the option of choosing courses from one of the Strand concentrations below or developing your own concentration in consultation with the BDP advisor and the faculty panel.\n\nArt and Social Change\n\nCommunity Welfare and Social Justice\n\nEnvironment\n\nHealth and Health Care\n\nGlobal Non-profits and Non-governmental Organizations\n\nYouth and Family\n\nIn order to create an interdisciplinary experience, you must choose courses from a variety of disciplines. Only one of your Strand Courses may come from your major department(s), or from courses cross-listed with your major department(s).\n\nIntegration Essay\n\nA 3-4 page essay in which you reflect on what you learned and accomplished through your BDP experience.\n\nImportant Notes on Fulfilling Your BDP Requirements\n\nPREREQUISITES: Some courses may have prerequisites. Please consult your BDP advisor to determine your eligibility for enrolling in specific courses.\n\nCROSS-LISTINGS: Note that many courses on this list may be cross-listed with other departments. You may take these courses under any of the cross-listed numbers. Please consult the course schedule or your BDP advisor for cross-listing information.\n\nGRADES AND GPA REQUIREMENTS: In courses taken for a letter grade, you must obtain a grade of C- or better to meet BDP requirements. The cumulative GPA of all courses counting toward your BDP certificate must be at least 2.0.\n\nPASS/FAIL: Only one BDP course, including connecting experience courses, may be taken pass/fail. Any exceptions will be considered by the faculty panel on an individual basis.\n\nSIGNATURE COURSES: Many of the First-Year Signature Courses (UGS 302 and UGS 303) that include significant content related to Non-profits & Social Entrepreneurship may also count toward your certificate; please consult your BDP advisor for more information.\n\nPETITIONS: You may be able to count courses toward your BDP certificate that do not appear on this curriculum sheet, if enough of the course content relates to your BDP topic. Please consult your BDP advisor if you would like to petition for a course to count toward your BDP. See the BDP calendar for fall and spring petition deadlines. Current BDP students can find the petition form on their MyBDP dashboard."
