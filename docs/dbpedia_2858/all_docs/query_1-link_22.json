        "text": "The American Vacuum Society (AVS) recognized Manos Mavrikakis, Vilas Distinguished Achievement Professor and Paul A. Elfers Professor in chemical and biological engineering, with its 2017 Prairie Chapter Outstanding Researcher Award. Mavrikakis was honored for his cumulative work in the computational chemistry of catalysis and his contributions to the AVS, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the science and technology of vacuum, materials, surfaces, interfaces, thin films, and plasmas.\n\nThe Prairie Chapter, one of 15 AVS area chapters, covers Illinois, Indiana, and eastern Wisconsin. Mavrikakis will receive the Outstanding Researcher Award and give an honorary lecture at the Prairie Chapter Fall Symposium, held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Sept. 7, 2017."
