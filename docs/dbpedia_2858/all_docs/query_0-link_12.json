Get in touch for more information! If you wish further information, contact one of our Executive Officers.\n\nWe are the oldest chapter in AVS. Seeing a need for energetic, nonprofit work in this area, we formed our chapter to provide sensible solutions. We've consistently grown since then, all thanks to the helping hands of this amazing community! More about our history coming soon!\n\nWe are one of the local chapters of the AVS, a nonprofit organization which promotes communication, dissemination of knowledge, recommended practices, research, and education in the use of vacuum and other controlled environments to develop new materials, process technology, devices, and related understanding of material properties for the betterment of humanity. We have members in industry, academia and government labs. The Chapter is entirely run by volunteers. We offer a number of technical programs and do scientific outreach to the community. The Chapter serves the Northwest geographic region, which is approximately defined by Alaska, British Columbia, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington."
