        "text": "In March of 2020, students at the University of Massachusetts Medical School founded the student Crisis and Emergency Preparedness Committee (CEPC): a student-run interdisciplinary organization that sought to coordinate UMass Chan student volunteer efforts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 2020 and 2021, CEPC organized opportunities for student engagement, including vaccination clinics, efforts to reduce vaccine hesitancy in the community, outreach with multilingual vaccine education, and support for clinical healthcare workers. CEPC has also worked closely with UMass Chan administration and local public health leaders to deploy student volunteers to administer the COVID-19 vaccines at vaccination sites across Central MA.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, CEPC has changed its mission to encompass more aspects of emergency prevention and response. CEPC is dedicated towards, but not limited to, several main goals. Coordinating and staffing vaccine clinics around Worcester, Working with faculty and local administration to coordinate preparedness efforts related towards any crisis that may afflict the community, and Educating students on a variety of topics to better respond to and prevent emergencies.\n\nThe Gold Humanism Honor Society (GHHS) is guided by the Arnold P. Gold Foundation’s vision statement: “Healthcare will be dramatically improved by placing human interests, values and dignity at the core of teaching and practice.” The University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School Chapter consists of select medical students, residents, and faculty recognized for their qualities of integrity, dedication, compassion, altruism, respect, empathy and curiosity. Student members from the UMass Chan chapter work with residents and faculty members to champion a culture where humanism is the cornerstone of medicine. This year, GHHS developed five pillars to encompass the vast reach of humanism in medicine. Each pillar has an overarching theme with members working on projects that focus on advancing these themes at UMass Chan.\n\n1. Advancing & Transforming Medical Education\n\n2. Wellness for Students and Residents\n\n3. Community Outreach and Advocacy\n\n4. Honoring Identity, Self and Diversity\n\n5. Humanism and Narrative Medicine\n\nPower of Presence is a student group that aims to ensure no one is alone at the end of their life. Our volunteers provide a caring presence for lonely patients and respite for families who can’t always be with their loved ones. Being present with someone in this capacity is a truly intimate, meaningful experience and a great privilege. Volunteers are trained on how to provide companionship, to listen actively, and to respond to non-verbal communication. They may read out loud to patients or give therapeutic hand massage. We also hold lectures a few times a year exploring different themes pertaining to end of life care.\n\nThe primary focus of Practice Safe Skin is creating and providing sun safety education to outdoor workers and youth groups. Our education includes, but is not limited to, discussions about the effects of harmful UV rays, how to best protect yourself from sun exposure, and basic identification of skin cancers. Practice Safe Skin is also helping with the transition of UMass Chan Medical School becoming a recognized Indoor Tan-Free “Skin Smart Campus” by the National Council on Skin Cancer Prevention. Ensuring the well-being of our students, UMass Chan Medical School will be providing a safe and healthy learning and living environment on and off campus, pledging to keep indoor tanning devices off our campus and our affiliated buildings. We also promote skin cancer prevention policies. The Indoor Tan-Free Skin Smart Campus Initiative is sponsored by the National Council on Skin Cancer Prevention in response to the 2014 U.S. Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer which concluded that there is a strong association between increased risk of skin cancer and indoor tanning use. UV radiation exposure from indoor tanning is completely avoidable which allows for interventions to help reduce skin-cancer related illness and deaths. Numerous studies have found that skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States, with melanoma as one of the most common cancers diagnosed among young adults. According to The International Agency for Research on Cancer Working Group, the use of indoor tanning facilities before the age of 35 increases the risk for melanoma by 75 percent.\n\nAs doctors, nurses, paramedics, medical students, and healthcare providers in the United States, we are committed to protecting our patients' physical and mental health and wellbeing. Every day, we use data obtained through rigorous scientific research to counsel our patients about how they can best protect themselves and their families from medical risk. As we bear witness to the devastation of firearms, we cannot remain silent about the significant danger that gun violence poses to our patients. As guardians of health and wellbeing, the medical community has a responsibility to address gun violence. This responsibility knows no political barrier. Unfortunately, after landmark research showed that the presence of firearms increases the risk of both homicide and suicide death in the home, political divisions limited funding for this subject. This limitation continues to impair our ability to develop the knowledge necessary to advise our patients. (1,2) SAFE is naming gun violence for what it is - a health threat of epidemic proportion - in order to rally the medical community to fight for the interests of our patients. It is time for us to bring the same urgency and dedication to the task of eliminating gun violence as we have to exposing other health risks, such as cigarette smoking. Gun violence threatens personal and public health. Through research, education, and support of evidence- backed policy, we can determine how best to arm our patients with facts and information that allow them to make the most informed decisions surrounding firearms.\n\nThe Indoor Tan-Free Skin Smart Campus (SSC) Initiative is sponsored by the National Council on Skin Cancer Prevention in response to the 2014 U.S. Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer. The SSC Initiative awards colleges that promote skin cancer prevention education and prohibit indoor tanning devices on campus and in college-affiliated buildings. The Skin Smart Campus Leadership Initiative helps colleges across the country become Skin Smart Campus recognized. We are passionate about this effort as there is a strong association between skin cancer and indoor tanning. Some research has demonstrated that tanning salons are particularly concentrated near colleges. A study out of UMass Chan found that of the top 125 US colleges listed in US News and World Report, 48% had indoor tanning facilities either on campus or in off campus housing and 14% allowed campus cash cards to be used to pay for tanning.\n\nThe purpose of this initiative is to build a program to provide tutoring for students at North High in various subjects including math and science courses (including AP courses) as well as SAT exam preparation. Our goal is to help students build a solid foundation in math and science and establish learning and studying methods while in high school before heading off to college. Along with that, we hope to help students by allowing them to have a platform to establish connections with medical students to look up to and to ask questions as they start their endeavor in STEM, since people in medical school come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds.\n\nThe Gold Humanism Honor Society (GHHS) is guided by the Arnold P. Gold Foundation’s vision statement: “Healthcare will be dramatically improved by placing human interests, values and dignity at the core of teaching and practice.” The University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School Chapter consists of select medical students, residents, and faculty recognized for their qualities of integrity, dedication, compassion, altruism, respect, empathy and curiosity.

Humanism and Narrative Medicine.\n\nQMass is a student interest group committed to making UMass Chan a more LGBTQIA+ inclusive and supportive place for students, patients, and community members. Our mission is to provide resources, hold community events, and spearhead advocacy initiatives to build connections, raise awareness, and promote the well-being and acceptance of LGBTQIA+ individuals both within and connected with UMass Chan. In addition, QMass aims to provide professional, emotional, and social support for students at UMass who identify as LGBTQIA+ or who are interested in LGBTQIA+ related topics. We are committed to improving diversity, equity, and inclusion across the curriculum, students, and faculty at UMass Chan Medical School. QMass West is the PURCH/Baystate chapter of the QMass LGBTQIA+ group. QMass West is based at Baystate and is focused on the above goals with regards to PURCH students, faculty, and community members, as well as general T.H. Chan School of Medicine students rotating at Baystate. Similar to the main QMass group, QMass West aims to increase advocacy for LGBTQIA+ patients, students, and community members, promote LGBTQIA+ health education, and provide resources for LGBTQIA+ T.H. Chan School of Medicine community members.\n\nClimate change is the greatest global public health crisis of our generation as evidenced by the increasing incidence of natural disasters, heat-waves, ocean rise, food instability, and the changing patterns of infectious diseases. Importantly, rising global temperatures disproportionately affect vulnerable populations such as children, elderly, and individuals with predisposing illnesses. International efforts are lacking in attempts to curb the climate crisis so it is imperative that swift action be taken on an individual and organizational level. As future healthcare providers, we must not only be educated about the effects of climate change but also use our collective voice to generate institutional change to better serve our patients. The UMass Chan Coalition for Climate Action aims to bring awareness to the climate crisis, educate current and future physicians to the health effects of climate change, and collaborate with the UMass Chan Medical School administration and other student organizations to bring more sustainability initiatives to both the UMass and greater Worcester communities.\n\nThe UMass Chan Medical School American Muslim Medical Student Association provides for the first time an avenue of interaction and discourse amongst Muslims and all others throughout the medical school system within Worcester, including those in the UMass Memorial Healthcare system. We aim to be a source of local events, whether in the form of celebrating Islamic holidays, volunteering efforts for cultural immersion, or learning more about Islam and its tenets. We invite those who work or study on the campus, whether as medical students, residents, nurses, physicians, professors, or other healthcare workers. In particular, this group is open to all, as we hope to establish elements of cultural humility, understanding, and interfaith. We also aim to promote awareness of issues that affect Muslims throughout today’s world and in the process aim to shed light on our collective human nature. Welcome!\n\nThe goal of the Urban Health Scholars Longitudinal Enrichment Elective is to encourage student interest in primary care, particularly to serve culturally and linguistically diverse, traditionally underserved populations. The longitudinal elective, spanning four years of medical school, is partnered with the Rural Health Scholar Longitudinal Enrichment Elective; both are supported by MassAHEC. In T.H. Chan School of Medicine Year 1, students complete didactic and experiential opportunities related to urban health and be assigned an LPP at an urban health center. The students will meet regularly with faculty to reflect on and process what they are learning and the implications for their future profession; attaining mastery includes repeated reinforcement and ongoing reflection. Students will be supported in the development of a Capstone and Summer Assistantship. In T.H. Chan School of Medicine Year 2, the students will participate in 5-10 hours of didactic/experiential opportunities with the incoming class, continue their LPP placement and Capstone. Students will be prioritized for a Population Health Clerkship which responds to their interest. In T.H. Chan School of Medicine Years 3 and 4, students will strengthen their leadership skills by co-leading the seminars and skills sessions, complete their Family Medicine clerkship, urban health FCEs, Capstone and present/publish as opportunities arise (e.g. Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, National Association of Community Health Centers). Students will be supported by Kendra Marien, MSW, Director, Central MA AHEC (faculty appointment in process), Linda Cragin, MS, Director, MassAHEC and Warren Ferguson, MD, MassAHEC Medical Director, and family medicine faculty based at their LPP sites. Suzanne Cashman, ScD, as co-director of the Rural Health Scholars Longitudinal Enrichment Elective and evaluator of the AHEC grant is also significantly involved.\n\nThe CARE (Collaborative Advocacy for Resilience and Empathy) Committee is a medical student committee affiliated with the UMass Chan Committee of Student Well-Being. We strive to promote diverse wellness efforts in small, meaningful doses to medical students at the T.H. Chan School of Medicine. We work with and help support various student organizations and OEEs to further their promotion of wellness on campus. Each semester typically has 5 sessions which run from 5:30pm-8:00pm. The session begins with a collaborative cooking experience where all the involved students cook a meal while learning new recipes, incorporating alternative ingredients, and acquiring new culinary skills that can be incorporated into daily practice. Following the cooking segment, everyone joins together and eats while a guest speaker joins and shares their knowledge about the specific topic of the session. These topics have included: Food insecurity, cooking for diabetes, cooking for IBD, Prenatal health, and an introduction to plant-based eating. This OEE welcomes all students from any of the 3 schools in UMass. No prior cooking experience is necessary!\n\nAdapted from The Moth storytelling radio show and podcast, Med Moth was established by medical students at UMass Chan in 2016 to provide a forum for those in the medical community to share reflections on their experiences in medicine. The goal of Med Moth is to promote humanism in medicine through storytelling by all members of the UMass Chan medical community. In the past we have heard from a diverse variety of voices including the Chief of Pediatric Surgery, registered nurses, and medical students. Our events are very simple. We typically have 6-8 speakers share 5-10 minute stories. Past talks have been about the speaker's journey into medicine, meaningful patient encounters, or other experiences that have shaped their personal or professional identity in health care. Some have been humorous (a horrible first day of internship) and others have been more serious (coping with the guilt of making a medical error). This provides the opportunity for individuals to not only reflect, but also learn from the diverse perspectives and experiences of their peers.\n\nThis OEE will be a unique opportunity for undergraduate medical students to explore the integration of medicine and the visual arts. Art is an extremely useful tool for physicians. Physicians can use art to communicate complex procedures and medical concepts to patients, to provide therapy to patients, or to raise awareness about issues in healthcare. Physicians can also use art for self-reflection, well-being, and prevention of burnout. Students will learn about the history and importance of medical illustrators and art therapists. Students will also gain basic art skills in the context of medical illustration, graphic medicine, and art therapy. Students will be able to practice and use these skills to create a final project showcasing what they have learned during the OEE.\n\nMore than 25% of the United States qualifies as disabled. However, despite being the largest minority, disability is still rarely addressed in medical education. This OEE endeavors to expand the understanding of the rich, complex culture and history of disability in the United States. From the disability rights movement to the intricate system of special education and IEPs, this course will teach participants about the realities of being disabled in this country. We feel exposure to the experiences of people with disabilities, both healthcare related and not, is important for future providers to understand some of the perspectives of patients impacted by disability. This OEE will delve into the complexities of advocacy and medical decision making but it will also highlight the joy and beauty of the disability community. Furthermore, each session will include the perspectives of people with disabilities, giving learners the chance to interact directly with a population that is rarely given a platform to share their own experience.\n\nTraditionally, undergraduate medical education has been based upon a two-pillar model: basic science and clinical science. In recent years, various medical schools have taken steps to incorporate a third pillar into their medical curriculums, termed “health systems science (HSS).” In this third science, medical students gain an understanding of the system of healthcare delivery, including health policy and economics, quality improvement, value-based care, interprofessional care, social determinants of health, and healthcare technology among others. Exposure to these topics will prepare students to navigate the complex landscape of modern medical practice.\n\nAlthough our current medical curriculum smoothly integrates some of these topics, such as social determinants of health, many of the aforementioned topics are more vaguely addressed, even as VISTA includes HSS as a curriculum pillar. Through the elective, we will define and explain the current health system that we are a part of both locally and nationally, how we got here, and where we may be headed. We will build on of-the-moment topics in healthcare, including AI and wearable technology in medicine and the potential for a single-payer health system in the US. Furthermore, we plan to delve into more specific topics to inform students on the foundations of health care financing, how financing affects health care delivery, how the biotechnical and pharmaceutical markets play a role, and how health economics advises the field.\n\nThe Music and Medicine curriculum contains a number of modules about specific topics in music and healing. These topics include:\n\n− Reasons for studying music and medicine\n\n− Music and the mind and brain\n\n− Music as a field of medical humanism\n\n− Music and healing: How music therapists work\n\n− Music and communities\n\n− Music and illness: Occupational health of musicians\n\n− Combining music and medicine in medical school\n\nEach module has a list of goals, objectives, core competencies addressed, classroom activities, speakers. Some activities include:\n\n− Invited guest speakers, particularly UMass faculty and patients/patient families\n\n− Group outings to musical events and shadowing music therapists\n\n− Coordinating wellness concert for the UMass Chan community\n\n− Practice listening and interpreting music to improve empathy, and how to employ this skill in the patient\n\nencounter\n\n− Experience and practice how music uses non-verbal skills to communicate amongst musicians and build\n\nteamwork\n\n− Learn about how community based music groups enhance a community’s well-being and explore how music\n\nused for healing has been used for advocacy and social justice\n\n− Study cross-cultural perspectives on music and healing (e.g., drum circles, drumming for PTSD, Native\n\nAmerican healing music, etc)\n\n− Invite physicians who have combined a career in music and medicine to speak\n\nOverall course goals include:\n\n− Recognize how music can be used to promote health, healing, and well-being\n\n− Describe how music has been incorporated into the field of medical humanism\n\n− Discuss how the study of music and cognition has contributed to improved understanding of neurology and\n\nbrain science\n\n− Examine in depth how music can be used therapeutically in clinical settings\n\n− Explain what doctors can learn from musicians and how music can enhance the education of physicians\n\nIn the last ten years, a growing number of medical institutions have established narrative\n\nmedicine curricula as a training method for healthcare providers.1 Research demonstrates the\n\nefficacy of such training. In October 2013, the American Association for the Advancement of\n\nScience published a study demonstrating that readers of literary fiction performed better on tests\n\nof affective and cognitive theory of mind compared with those who read nonfiction, popular\n\nfiction, or nothing at all.2 Theory of mind tests measure the ability of an individual to detect and\n\nunderstand another person’s knowledge, beliefs, emotions, and intentions, and use that\n\nunderstanding to navigate social situations. Recent social psychology research suggests that\n\n“narratives, when compared with reporting statistical evidence alone, can have uniquely\n\npersuasive effects in overcoming preconceived beliefs and cognitive biases.”3 Through narrative\n\nmedicine programs, providers can become equipped to deliver more empathetic, compassionate,\n\nculturally-sensitive, and ultimately, higher quality care.\n\nThis course will explore the power of narratives—in written, oral, and visual forms—to\n\nshape the way we, as medical students, conceptualize and practice medicine. The care of the sick\n\nunfolds in stories and effective healthcare demands the ability to recognize, absorb, interpret, and\n\nengage with the stories of others.\n\nIn each session, students will be asked to critically examine portions of short stories,\n\npoems, articles, research, and other narrative forms. As students read, write, and reflect together,\n\nwe will use the skills of close reading and listening for different perspectives and challenge each\n\nother to practice medicine with the parallel skills of attentive listening and empathy. Our\n\nselection of stories will explore themes such as race, gender, cultural identity, and mental health.\n\nThere will be two components to each workshop: close reading and group discussion.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to read or listen to the assigned narrative(s) before the session.\n\nCourse instructors will provide prompts to guide students to think critically about the assigned\n\nreadings in preparation for the group discussion to follow. Our intent is to help students organize\n\ntheir thoughts and foster richer conversation. The group, including the faculty, will reflect and\n\nexplore the works together.\n\nOur group is a branch of a larger organization that has chapters across New England. Our goal is to get healthcare students and professionals at UMass involved in fitness events. Be on the lookout for a race schedule, group training events, nutrition classes, and more! Medicine in Motion is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with multiple chapters across New England that aims to fight burnout in the medical field. Membership is composed of a diverse group of healthcare providers, and our mission is to address medical burnout through fitness, interdisciplinary community building, and philanthropy. We encourage healthy lifestyles and fitness among medical professionals to optimize performance and patient care, reduce medical burnout, and provide better and healthier examples for our patients.\n\nWe aim to share our love for the outdoors with all interested members in the UMass Chan community - whether you are a seasoned mountaineer or you are interested in going on your first hike. We lead hikes at various levels and in all seasons, locally and in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. We also host workshops and gear demonstrations to educate members on safe hiking practices in all seasons. Our monthly trips provide an opportunity to meet other students from all three schools, while enjoying safe and challenging adventures that serve as an excellent break from your studies. Email the student leaders to sign up for our mailing list."
