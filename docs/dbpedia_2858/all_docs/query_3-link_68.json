        "text": "OAK RIDGE, Tenn, June 29, 2017 – Arthur Baddorf and An-Ping Li, researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, have been named fellows of the American Vacuum Society.\n\nAVS fellowship is a selective and prestigious honor reserved for members who have made sustained and outstanding technical contributions in research, technical advancement, academic education or managerial leadership for at least 10 years.\n\nBaddorf is the leader of the Scanning Probe Microscopy group at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, a DOE Office of Science User Facility at ORNL. He has more than 25 years of materials research experience and serves on a number of ORNL and national advisory boards.\n\nAVS recognized Baddorf \"for studies of surfaces relating atomic structure to dynamic responses of phonons, thermal expansion, ferroelectric response and electrical transport.\"\n\nLi is a senior researcher and theme leader in the Scanning Probe Microscopy group. He is also a joint faculty professor at the University of Tennessee and recipient of multiple research and performance awards from ORNL.\n\nAVS honored Li \"for pioneering contributions to the fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in low-dimensional materials through controlled material synthesis and innovative use of scanning probe microscopy techniques.\""
