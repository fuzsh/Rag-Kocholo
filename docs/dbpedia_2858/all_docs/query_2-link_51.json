We participate in educational outreach through the Colorado Association of Science Teachers (CAST) to provide monetary awards to outstanding physical science teachers at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. The Chapter sponsors one teacher each year to attend the Science Educators Workshop at the International AVS Symposium.\n\nGet in Touch\n\nWe are always interested in expanding our membership and finding candidates who would like to be more involved. If you are interested in serving in a chapter leadership position or participating in one or more of our activities please contact us"
