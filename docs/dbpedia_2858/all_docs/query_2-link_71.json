        "text": "HEPA is a type of pleated mechanical air filter. It is an acronym for \"high efficiency particulate air [filter]\" (as officially defined by the U.S. Dept. of Energy). This type of air filter can theoretically remove at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria, and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns (µm). The diameter specification of 0.3 microns corresponds to the worst case; the most penetrating particle size (MPPS). Particles that are larger or smaller are trapped with even higher efficiency. Using the worst case particle size results in the worst case efficiency rating (i.e. 99.97% or better for all particle sizes).\n\nAll air cleaners require periodic cleaning and filter replacement to function properly. Follow manufacturer's recommendations on maintenance and replacement.\n\nMinimum Efficiency Reporting Values, or MERVs, report a filter's ability to capture larger particles between 0.3 and 10 microns (µm).\n\nThis value is helpful in comparing the performance of different filters\n\nThe rating is derived from a test method developed by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) [see www.ashrae.org ].\n\nThe higher the MERV rating the better the filter is at trapping specific types of particles.\n\nMERV Rating\n\nAverage Particle Size Efficiency in Microns\n\nRelated Questions"
