        "text": "What Is a Stakeholder?\n\nA stakeholder is an individual or a group of individuals with an interest, often financial, in the success of a business. The primary stakeholders in a corporation include its investors, employees, customers, and suppliers.\n\nWith the increasing attention on corporate social responsibility, the concept has been extended to include communities, governments, and trade associations.\n\nUnderstanding Stakeholders\n\nStakeholders can be internal or external to an organization. Internal stakeholders are people whose interest in a company comes through a direct relationship, such as employment, ownership, or investment.\n\nExternal stakeholders do not directly work for or with a company but are affected by the actions and outcomes of the business. Suppliers, creditors, and public interest groups are all considered external stakeholders.\n\nExample of an Internal Stakeholder\n\nInvestors are internal stakeholders who are significantly affected by a company and its performance. If, for example, a venture capital firm decides to invest $5 million in a technology startup in return for 10% equity and significant influence, the firm becomes an internal stakeholder of the startup.\n\nThe return on the venture capitalist firm's investment hinges on the startup's success or failure, meaning that the firm has a vested interest.\n\nExample of an External Stakeholder\n\nExternal stakeholders do not have a direct relationship with the company but may be affected by its operations.\n\nWhen a company goes over the allowable limit of carbon emissions, for example, the town in which it is located is considered an external stakeholder because its residents may be harmed by the increased pollution.\n\nExternal stakeholders in some cases can have a direct effect on a company. The federal government, for example, is an external stakeholder. A policy change on carbon emissions affects the operations of any business that burns a significant amount of fossil fuel.\n\nIssues Concerning Stakeholders\n\nA common problem is that the interests of various stakeholders may not align. In fact, they may be in direct conflict.\n\nFor example, the primary goal of a corporation, from the perspective of its shareholders, is often considered to be the maximization of profits to enhance shareholder value.\n\nSince labor costs are unavoidable for most companies, a company may seek to keep these costs under tight control. This is likely to upset another group of stakeholders, its employees. The most efficient companies successfully manage the interests and expectations of all their stakeholders.\n\nStakeholders vs. Shareholders\n\nShareholders are only one type of stakeholder.\n\nAll stakeholders are bound to a company by some type of vested interest, usually for the long term. A shareholder has a financial interest, but shareholders can sell their stock; they do not necessarily have a long-term need for the company and can usually get out at any time and reduce their losses.\n\nOthers cannot. The vendors in a company's supply chain might suffer if the company limits production and reduces or eliminates its services. Employees of the company might lose their jobs.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nStakeholders are individuals, organizations, or other entities that have a vested interest in the success or failure of a company or an endeavor. Stakeholders can be internal or external and range from customers and shareholders to communities and even governments."
