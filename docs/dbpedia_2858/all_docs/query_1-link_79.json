        "text": "Welcome to the Vacuum Cleaner Collectors Club\n\nThe Vacuum Cleaner Collectors Club is a non-profit collectors group dedicated to the preservation and restoration of an integral part of industrial history. Vacuum cleaners were part of the electrical pioneer movement in the United States and elsewhere. The variety of machines from the early primitives to the highly stylized reflections of the mid-20th century and beyond are excellent examples of industrial design that trace the evolution of style and mechanical innovation. Members from a wide variety of backgrounds collect, restore and preserve this fascinating aspect of industrial heritage. The club provides a forum that fosters collecting and cataloging of historical materials, exchange of information, and sharing of an interest in vacuum cleaners between collectors.\n\nOur club was featured on How To With John Wilson “How to Watch the Game” Season 3 episode 4"
