Since its inception, SME has continued to evolve over the years to stay abreast of industry changes and to reflect the ever-broadening interests of its members. SME is organized into eight distinct divisions: coal & energy, environmental, health & safety, industrial minerals & aggregates, mineral and metallurgical processing, mining & exploration, underground construction association, and the woman’s auxiliary to the AIME. More than 60 local SME sections facilitate the exchange of information and increase grassroots participation in SME programs and services.\n\nThis organization gives 1st place ($500) and 2nd place ($300) awards in the Senior Division and 1st place ($300) and 2nd place ($200) awards in the Junior Division for projects that best demonstrate excellence relating to mineral science or engineering, including mineral exploration, mining, reclamation, metallurgy and mineral processing.\n\nThe Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety (DRMS) is responsible for balancing the need for mineral resource production with the protection of the public and Colorado’s natural resources. DRMS consists of four programs: the Coal Regulatory Program, the Minerals Regulatory Program, the Inactive Mine Reclamation Program, and the Mine Safety and Training Program. Our mission is to protect the public, certified active miners, and the environment during current mining operations, and to restore abandoned mine sites, ensuring that all mined land is reclaimed to beneficial use. The Office of Mined Land Reclamation issues reclamation permits and is responsible for the regulation of all mining and reclamation activities at every coal, metal, mineral, and aggregate mine throughout the state. The primary objectives of this program are to review and evaluate all mining and reclamation permit applications and inspect active operations to ensure that approved reclamation plans and regulations are followed. The Office also provides essential safety training for mine operators and employees. DRMS staff, along with the array of other esteemed organizations, are proud to lend our continued support to the CSEF in the form of Junior and Senior Division Special Awards. It’s safe to say, though, each year the true excitement arises when we meet these exceptional student-scientists, have the opportunity to learn from them directly, and are left buoyed into the future on ripples from their energy and ideas.\n\nThis organization gives one $75 award in both divisions to the projects best related to Earth or environmental sciences.\n\nThe Biophysical Society (BPS) is a non-profit international organization founded in 1958 to lead the development and dissemination of knowledge in biophysics. Membership to the Society is open to those who have educational, research, or practical experience in biophysics or in an allied scientific field, such as physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. BPS supports members in all stages of their career. Through the Society’s programs, networks, and outreach efforts, BPS helps students and researchers develop their interests, skills, and career in biophysics.\n\nThis organization gives one cash award in the Senior Division to the project best related to the area of biophysics or allied science (physics, chemistry, biology, engineering).\n\nFor 7 years beginning in 2006, the Colorado State Science Fair engaged and inspired Sara Volz who was the top winner of the 2013 Intel Science Talent Search and is now finishing her PhD in Biophysics at the University of California in Berkeley where she is studying the fundamentals of protein folding. Sara and her family would like to encourage other students to pursue their scientific passions.\n\nThis family gives two $300 awards in the Senior Division to projects that best contribute to fundamental research, meaning research to expand the knowledge base, improving theories for better understanding.\n\nTrout Unlimited is a nonprofit volunteer organization that is dedicated to improving Colorado’s fishing habitats and the preservation of their cold water ecosystems. Trout Unlimited through its state council Colorado Trout Unlimited along with the local chapter Boulder Flycasters, works to conserve, protect and restore North America’s cold water fisheries and watersheds. By the next generation, Trout Unlimited will ensure that robust populations of native and wild cold water fish once again thrive within their North American range, so that tomorrow’s children can enjoy healthy fisheries in their home waters.\n\nThis organization gives one 1st place ($200), one 2nd place ($125) and one 3rd place ($75) award in either division for the projects best related to the preservation, assessment or monitoring of cold water ecosystems.\n\nAir Force ROTC Detachment 90 at Colorado State University is the tenth largest Air Force ROTC unit in the nation. The mission of Detachment 90 is to commission highly qualified Air Force officer candidates by recruiting, educating, training and motivating cadets at both CSU and the University of Northern Colorado and prepare them to lead in the world’s greatest air, space, and cyberspace force.\n\nThis organization gives four awards (over-the-shoulder sling pack, power bank charger, dog tag USB flash memory drive, dual USB car charger) in either division for the projects best related to aerospace technology.\n\nThe Office of Naval Research is an executive branch within the Department of Defense that provides technical advice to the Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary of the Navy. Science and technology investments enable the technical superiority of our naval forces by producing knowledge and transitions and growing a healthy science and engineering workforce. ONR has six science and technology departments that coordinate and execute the research: Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare & Combating Terrorism; Command, Control Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Ocean Battlespace Sensing; Sea Warfare and Weapons; Warfighter Performance; and Naval Air Warfare and Weapons.\n\nThis organization gives four awards (medallion) in the Junior Division and three awards ($75 gift card and medallion) in the Senior Division for the projects that best show an understanding of the subject and the scientific process (teams are not eligible for these awards).\n\nThe Wilkins family recognizes the critical role of research and development in sparking the next generation of innovative start-up companies. The award is given to a student that has created an invention or innovation in computer science or engineering, and has undertaken further steps to realize its commercial potential.\n\nThis family gives one $750 award in the Senior Division for the best project invention or innovation with clear commercial potential, where the student has undertaken steps to realize the potential.\n\nThe Paul Wojtaszek Memorial Award is sponsored by Paul’s family and friends and given to the project deemed to be the foremost study in the field of medicine & health in the senior division. The award is named for Dr. Paul Wojtaszek, who for decades was a judge for the CSEF in the senior division for medical projects.
