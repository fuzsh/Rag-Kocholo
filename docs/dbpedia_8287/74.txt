Logic programming is based on the idea of using facts and rules to describe the state of the world and the relationships between entities. Facts are statements that are true in the domain of interest, such as "Alice is a programmer" or "Bob likes pizza". Rules are conditional statements that derive new facts from existing ones, such as "If X is a programmer and Y likes pizza, then X and Y are compatible". Logic programming languages use a syntax that resembles mathematical logic, such as Prolog, which stands for Programming in Logic.

Well... your example doesn't show how you derive new facts from existing facts. Saying that I can go from B to C and that I can go from A to B we can assume that (with enough energy) we can go from A to C. But the given examples looks random. I used Bing AI to ask about logic programming, and the example given was PROLOG. And, there, the examples made sense. If we first declare a list of parent/child (any order)... later you can ask if 2 children are siblings (they should share at least one parent). That logic made sense.

Logic programming works by using a process called inference to find solutions that satisfy the facts and rules. Inference is a technique that applies logical reasoning to deduce new information from existing knowledge. For example, given the facts and rules above, inference can conclude that Alice and Bob are compatible. Logic programming languages use a specific form of inference called backward chaining, which starts from a goal and tries to find facts and rules that support it. For example, given the goal "Who is compatible with Alice?", backward chaining would search for facts and rules that match the pattern "X and Alice are compatible".

I program since I was 11 years old. When I was up to 18, I didn't like pizza. So far, I don't like many American pizzas. So... pizza lovers love me, or am I supposed to love pizza?... or I am still having illusions that I ever programmed a computer?

Logic programming offers several benefits that can make software development easier and more efficient. The declarative nature of logic programming allows you to focus on what you want to achieve, instead of how to achieve it, which can simplify the design and implementation of your program and reduce the chances of errors and bugs. Additionally, logic programming supports modularity, allowing you to separate your program into independent modules that can be reused and combined in different ways. This can improve the readability and maintainability of your code, as well as facilitate collaboration and testing. Expressiveness is another advantage of logic programming, as it allows you to represent complex and abstract concepts in a concise and natural way. This enhances the clarity and elegance of your code, enabling you to solve problems that are difficult or impossible to solve with other paradigms. Lastly, logic programming provides reasoning capabilities which can help you to verify the correctness and validity of your code, as well as discover new insights and solutions.

Logic programming is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a range of problems requiring logical thinking and reasoning. It is often applied in the fields of artificial intelligence, data analysis, web development, and software engineering. For instance, it can be used to create natural language processing systems, manipulate and query data in an efficient manner, develop dynamic web applications, and support various aspects of software engineering. Additionally, logic programming languages can integrate with other web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML. Ultimately, logic programming provides the tools and frameworks necessary to automate and simplify tasks such as specification, verification, testing, debugging, and documentation.

Logic programming is an incredibly rewarding paradigm for software developers to explore. To get started, you must first choose a language â€“ Prolog is the most popular and widely used, but there are other options like Datalog, Answer Set Programming, Constraint Logic Programming, and Logic-Based Hybrid Languages. Then, you must understand the syntax and semantics of facts, rules, goals, variables, and constants as well as how inference and backward chaining work. After that, you can practice with examples from online resources and create your own problems and solutions based on your interests. Finally, you can explore the advanced features such as lists, structures, arithmetic, recursion, backtracking, cut, negation, meta-programming, modules, and libraries.

The idea of the paradigm is great... yet, the article reduces it to a strange version of just declarative programming, with examples that just don't make sense to explain the concept. Maybe giving some examples on some of the languages that are said to implement the paradigm could help... but definitely the examples need to be remade.
