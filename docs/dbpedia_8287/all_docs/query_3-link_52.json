        "text": "Hi Mark,\n\nIf you're new to the exciting world of Logic 9, then I would like to recommend some excellent resources that help new users become \"pro\" users:\n\n1. http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pro-Training-Logic-Express/dp/0321636805\n\nThe content is presented in the context of working on various projects. Logic features, tools, and tips are presented when needed during the course of completing a project. It starts off very easy but incrementally progresses to more complex levels. The really cool part is that, because the information is broken down into manageable bits, coupled with a very clear style of writing, the learner experiences a very smooth transition from beginner to experienced user.\n\n2. http://www.groove3.com/str/logic-9-explained.html\n\nBeing a tutorial junkie, I can say with a high degree of certainty that there is no finer, comprehensive video introduction to Logic 9 that this tutorial. Highly recommended!!! Again the content is presented in manageable bits in the context of working on a project. Project files are included.\n\nI have absolutely no affiliation with Groove 3. I do however, have their complete Logic line up which has elevated my Logic skills in a most enjoyable manner.\n\nBest regards,\n\nWally\n\nI agree: tutorials work for me too. Especially when you can follow and understand why you're doing what you are.\n\nThanks. Yes, I had seen these. But they seemed a little pricey without really knowing what they're like. Shall return to the site now, thanks to your recommendations and see if I can find a sample video.\n\nHi Mark,\n\n(Thanks Wally for your continued endorsements!) I am the author of the Groove 3 Logic 9 Explained videos. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or want any additional info about them. There is a sample video available at the Logic 9 Explained page at the Groove 3 web site. Obviously it's hard for me to be objective ðŸ™‚ but I think they do give a comprehensive overview of Logic's main \"bread and butter\" features.\n\nHi Wally,\n\nThanks very much for that. I've scanned almost every resource I could find. Am working my way through Lynda atm.\n\nYes, I've begun that. Found it a little unsatisfactory in that it says, \"Do this; Do that\" without always explaining why. Shall persevere, though ðŸ™‚.\n\nYour help greatly appreciated!\n\nHi Mark,\n\nSince you have access to Lynda, then put your mind at ease, and dig into the L9 Essential Training by Scott Hirsch. I skimmed through a very chapters recently and found it to be very informative at a nice, easy going pace.\n\nThe funny thing about the \"Do this; Do that\" approach is that it all starts to make sense when you reflect back on what you accomplished at the end of each chapter. Silly to say that I found taking the quizzes seemed to help crystallize the information.\n\nVideos provide immediate gratification and understanding of certain procedures.\n\nWorking through the Apple Pro book is a much slower process. However I found that to be very helpful as reading the text while looking at the screen shots and my computer monitor put me in a more reflective, deep-thinking mode to better absorb the content.\n\nI would encourage you to keep working through the book as the real payoff is the cumulative understanding you gain when you reach the end.\n\nUltimately, a combination of book and video seems to really work well.\n\nBest regards,\n\nWally\n\nEli, Hi!\n\nThanks for that. Certainly looks interesting.\n\nBut I'm still not sure which package is right for me: I've been using Logic Pro 9 for about a month. Never used GarageBand. I'm interested in writing 'classical' music. So drums and loops and audio are not a high priority.\n\nEvery time I think I've got a hang of the basics, something like this MIDI track thing (this thread) comes along and puts me in my place.\n\nSo it's extremely important for me to get as close to a total understanding of the relevant basics of LP as I can.\n\nIn that case, which package (I confess to being a little confused: you seem to have so much on offer) I ought o go for.\n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations ðŸ™‚.\n\nHi Mark,\n\n(Thanks Wally for your continued endorsements!)

Obviously it's hard for me to be objective ðŸ™‚ but I think they do give a comprehensive overview of Logic's main \"bread and butter\" features.\n\nAm I the only one who has a problem learning audio applications through a book? I probably shouldn't say this, because I write books for a living (although fiction), but for me it's much, much easier to watch someone like Eli demonstrating and then following along.\n\nA book is great for quick reference questions, but real learning comes from seeing and hearing, I think.\n\nJust my opinion.\n\nWatching a video is without question a much easier way to grasp how things work. I imagine it be similar to a time when the apprentice learned by watching, then assisting the master craftsperson before being deemed competent to go it alone.\n\nBut there is something about the way the Apple Pro books are scripted to promote learning that I find very appealing. Right now, I'm reading through the Apple Pro book on Final Cut Express. It's slow going, but I'm digesting the content and retaining it. I just started viewing the Lynda FCE tutorial which is excellent but a bit fast paced.\n\nMy impression is that I'm able to follow the online video tutorial as well as I ams because of time spent with the book. I suppose the oppose might be true: starting with a video, then reinforcing the learning by working through a book. Both has given me something useful.\n\nI agree with you that learning comes from seeing and hearing, but then also doing on a routine basis.\n\nWally,\n\nI couldn't agree more!\n\nI was an educator for 20 years: working with as many media as possible is generally preferable. I intend to pursue in parallel the sources you've all been kind enough to recommend here ðŸ™‚. Thanks!\n\nJust that the book does still tend to lead you through a kind of algorithm without always explaining why you're doing it. You do it successfully, all right. But unless it's in a context that includes why, you do tend to forget. Or, I do!\n\nI know that the more I do, the more mistakes I make, the more I come at something from many angles, the more rounded will be my understanding.\n\nVideo is certainly easier on the neck too ðŸ˜€!\n\nI've asked Eli for a recommendation from among his several packages. Am looking forward to it.\n\n...I'm able to follow the online video tutorial as well as I ams because of time spent with the book. I suppose the oppose might be true: starting with a video, then reinforcing the learning by working through a book. Both has given me something useful.\n\nI agree with you that learning comes from seeing and hearing, but then also doing on a routine basis.\n\nI'd recommend checking out the Core Logic 101 which is the perfect place to start your Logic journey:\n\nhttp://www.macprovideo.com/tutorial/logic9101\n\nIsn't Core Logic 101 essentially the Logic 8 version with a few bits of Logic 9 thrown in? ðŸ˜‰\n\nI would think that someone new to Logic as of version 9 would want Logic 9-specific content.\n\nThe Groove 3 Logic 9 Explained is all new content and not a repackaged version of the Logic 8 tutorial.\n\nWow... That's both unfair and not relevant IMHO... ðŸ˜‰\n\nI don't know if you're familiar with the Apple Certified Guide : Logic 101: Introduction to Logic Express 8 and Logic Pro 8 book by David Nahmani and the book for Logic 9?? (You linked to the later above). The content is exactly the same aside from a few minor changes throughout the book to reflect changes relevant to Logic 9... However, I had to pay full whack to get the new edition... I'm not complaining as I feel it is a good book and of course as an Apple Certified Trainer I use it as the basis when teaching Logic Certified courses.\n\nThe macProVideo.com Core Logic 9 101 is the Logic 8 101 with additional videos and some replaced videos & content relevant to any changes in Logic 9. The interface and 95% of the functions etc are exactly the same otherwise! There's no need to reinvent a highly acclaimed and popular wheel just for the sake of it.\n\nYou know macProVideo charge existing owners of the Logic 8 101 only $5 to upgrade to 9... we'd rather do that and make less money than create new content for the sake of it in order to convince customers they \"need\" a brand new tutorial when the existing one ticks all the boxes.\n\nAside from that Flex Time and other major additions are either covered in their own tutorials or in the free \"Logic 9 first look\" tutorial:\n\nhttp://www.macprovideo.com/tutorial/logicfirstlook\n\nI didn't reply to (and answer) Mark's original question to promote macprovideo tutorials... I replied in order to explain the concept of Chase MIDI note events.\n\n@ Mark, there are plenty of options available as you can see from this discussion. I hope you find the one's that suit your learning style and needs best. I'd like to add that an additional option not yet discussed is one-to-one training or attending the 3 day Logic 101: Introduction to Logic Express 9 and Logic Pro 9 course at your local Apple Authorised Training Centre. At the end of the 3 days you have the option to take an exam which will give you the title of Apple Certified Pro in Logic 9 level 1. Although all the content is based on the Logic 9 book by David Nahmani, I've had students who feel they've gained a lot from attending course over reading the book at home. Of course this option is more costly, but some people appreciate the intensive hands-on approach...\n\nhttp://training.apple.com/creative/logic101\n\nOtherwise, all the links to videos and books and using forums like this one will, I'm sure, be of huge benefit in helping you get the most out of Logic!\n\nGood luck!\n\nRounik\n\nHi Mark,\n\nThanks for your email. Sorry for the delay responding - I just got back from an out of town gig with my band.\n\nI hear what you are saying about being interested mostly in MIDI. The thing is that nowadays, the line between audio and MIDI is blurred. It's not an \"either - or\" thing. When you are using software instruments - and I am assuming that you either are or will be using at the very least, some - working in the audio stream becomes relevant. You still need to mix your MIDI tracks. And if they are not coming from software instruments, then you'll probably want to either route or record your external synths into Logic. So, audio pays a role even when working strictly with MIDI.\n\nMy videos do deal with audio, loops, and drums, etc; but always in the service of learning about the broader concepts involved. I think you would probably be well served with the Logic Explained videos; and then the Logic Qwik Trix videos. Start with Logic Explained though. It will help you get up and running and comfortable with the basic workflow within Logic. The actual content of the examples may not be your cup of tea. But I think if you can look past this; you will find them to be very useful."
