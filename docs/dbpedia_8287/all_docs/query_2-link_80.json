        "meta_description": "Hi. I am currently completing a research project in college to do with the accessibility of Apple's logic suite, and it would be very valuable if some of the logic users out there in the Applevis community could share their experiences, both positive and negative, with logic and VO. As a music technology student, I use Logic pro every day, and I'm aware of many issues and workarounds. I am very interested to know the wider community's knowledge and opinion on these. It would be great to hear people's real life examples of issues and workarounds that they have developed.",
