        "text": "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the need for software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers is growing. The demand for new smartphone and tablet applications is driving the need for skilled professionals. That means Swift jobs are some of the most in-demand occupations today.\n\nLearning Swift could be an excellent starting point for those who want to build a career in software development. Apple created the Swift programming language specifically for building iOS and Apple products, Mac, and Linux systems. Apple Insider says the ability to run C, Objective-C, and C++ within a single program is Swift’s most noteworthy feature.\n\nSince it's open-source, developers can also incorporate Swift into other areas, including web design. If you’re wondering how to learn Swift, there are multiple routes you can take, from free online courses to Swift bootcamps. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nCoding Bootcamps\n\nA short, intensive coding bootcamp helps learners develop programming language, software, mobile app, and web development skills. Students may not gain the same depth or scope of education as a computer science degree. However, a Swift bootcamp can be a great choice for learners who want to focus on programming for Mac, iOS, or Linux.\n\nAdditionally, a Swift bootcamp can be the start of a career in tech or a step toward career advancement. Graduates from a coding bootcamp typically come away with a portfolio of projects illustrating their skills. Not only that, but the best coding bootcamps work with industry partners to offer graduates job placement opportunities.\n\nNot all coding bootcamps provide the same quality education. Also, they're typically not accredited. But some of the best bootcamps work with the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR). The organization's standards help prevent deceptive graduation and job placement claims.\n\nCoding Bootcamps for You\n\nOnline Courses\n\nCoding bootcamps can be expensive, but they aren't the only option. Apple offers an app solution that gamifies learning Swift with interactive puzzles to help students master the basics. There's no experience necessary. Learners can download Swift Playgrounds for iPad or Mac and create real-life apps with Apple-designed interactive walkthroughs.\n\nFree and inexpensive online courses are another choice if you’re looking into how to learn Swift.\n\nLearn Swift: Students learn fundamental programming concepts in this free course from Codecademy. Lessons include variables, conditionals and logic, loops, arrays and sets, dictionaries, functions, structures, and classes. There are no prerequisites. The course takes around 25 hours to complete, and learners graduate with a portfolio of projects.\n\nSwift for Beginners: This free course teaches Swift basics and reviews its core problem-solving features. Students learn to construct algorithms and build feature-rich mobile applications through videos led by industry professionals and practice exercises. It takes approximately seven days to complete four lessons on variables, strings, if statements, and functions.\n\nBuild iOS Apps with SwiftUI: This beginner's course includes Swift, SwiftUI, wireframing, and creating a project in Xcode. Students learn to build iOS from start to finish using Apple's UI framework, then publish it to the App Store. They study core Swift language features, including Arrays and Dictionaries. This skill path requires a subscription to Codecademy Pro.\n\nIntroduction to Programming in Swift 5: Students learn the basics of the Swift programming language, Swift concepts, tools, and object-oriented programming. This self-paced beginner course takes around 11 hours to complete. Introduction to Programming in Swift 5 is the first of four courses in the Swift 5 iOS Application Developer Specialization.\n\nTables, Data & Networking in iOS: Students learn to get apps working with servers and external data and create a ToDo app in this advanced-level class. They gain experience using tables and collections to create visual displays and use core data to build more robust applications. The course takes around 16 hours, and students earn a shareable certificate upon completion.\n\nOnline Courses vs. Bootcamps\n\nOnline Courses Pros Cons\n\nFree or inexpensive\n\nSubscriptions that include access to various courses\n\nSelf-paced\n\nBeginner-friendly\n\nLess accountability\n\nLimited support services\n\nLimited interaction with classmates or instructors\n\nNo job placement or career services\n\nBootcamps Pros Cons\n\nInteraction with classmates and instructors\n\nAccountability\n\nCertification\n\nStudent services, career services, and job placement\n\nScheduled meeting times\n\nMust maintain an intensive pace\n\nCan be expensive\n\nMay need prior education or coding experience\n\nCoding Bootcamps to Learn Swift\n\nSwift Jobs\n\nA Swift certification validates a professional as an expert in the iOS programming language. The certification can help you start a career or open the door to new opportunities. Employers can count on the fact that candidates with certifications from reputable programs have industry-level skills.\n\nBelow are some careers you can pursue once you have a strong foundation in Swift.\n\nWeb Developers and Digital Designers\n\nThe BLS projects a 13% increase in the need for web developers and digital designers between 2020 and 2030. These professionals collaborate with management and clients to develop the design and functionality of an interface or website. Digital designers create the look and user experience, while web developers often specialize in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development.\n\nMedian Annual Salary (May 2021): $77,200\n\nSoftware Developers, Quality Assurance Analysts, and Testers\n\nAccording to the BLS, software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers accounted for approximately 1.8 million jobs in 2020. They typically work in teams with designers and programmers. Software developers create computer and mobile applications and systems, while quality assurance analysts and testers identify problems within the software.\n\nMedian Annual Salary (May 2021): $110,140\n\nComputer and Information Research Scientists\n\nThe BLS projects job openings for computer and information research scientists to increase by 22% between 2020 and 2030. These scientists design computer architecture, study and design new programming languages, and make the software more efficient. Additionally, computer and information research scientists may specialize in fields such as medicine or biology.\n\nMedian Annual Salary (May 2021): $131,490\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Learning Swift"
