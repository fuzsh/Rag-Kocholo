        "text": "Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problems using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. There are lots of programming languages that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms. Apart from varieties of programming languages, there are lots of paradigms to fulfill each and every demand. They are discussed below as follows:\n\nFunctional Programming is a type of programming paradigm in which everything is done with the help of functions and using functions as its basic building blocks. In it, we simply try to bind each and everything in a purely mathematical functionsâ€™ style. Programs are generally written at a higher level and are therefore much easier to comprehend.\n\nLogical Programming is a type of programming paradigm that uses logic circuits to control how facts and rules about the problems within the system are represented or expressed. In it, logic is used to represent knowledge, and inference is used to manipulate it. It tells the model about how to accomplish a goal rather than what goal to accomplish.\n\nNow let us go through the major key differences between them after going through the basics of both of them. Differences are shown below in a tabular format as follows:"
