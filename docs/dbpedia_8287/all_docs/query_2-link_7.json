You don’t need any programming knowledge to use the plug-ins created in this environment, but you can view and modify them with the built-in script editor. Once authored and stored as a setting or patch or as part of a concert or project file, you can use the plug-in just like any other. A number of pre-built Scripter processors are included.\n\nIf you’re an advanced user, you can create your own custom MIDI plug-ins. See Use the Script Editor.\n\nThe Scripter plug-in has one global parameter. Further parameters, defined by the JavaScript script that is currently running, are shown below the global parameter."
