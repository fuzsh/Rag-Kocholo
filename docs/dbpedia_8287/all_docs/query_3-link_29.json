        "text": "Logic is an order of magnitude more powerful than GarageBand.\n\nFor a start it is more object orientated than GarageBand.\n\nIn Logic, every region or even note has its own parameters which are non destructive. You can mute, quantise, transpose, delay, all sort of stuff each midi region independently. You can even mute individual midi notes\n\nFor audio you have similar non destructive parameter per region and can stretxh, warp, tune etc the audio. You can also take drum loop, say, and with one command turn it into a sampler track with one hit per key via the transient markers and logic automatically generates the midi file to play it back seamlessly. You can then do things like make a groove template based on this region and quantise other midi parts with the same timing. So you can steal the feel of a loop.\n\nFor midi you get a step editor, event list, score and transform as well as the piano roll. There are lots of features for mucking with midi, converting and mangling all sorts of stuff\n\nThere is much more content. You get lots of plug ins, synths and a sampler. The synths are pretty nice. Some are very old, not that that matters, but the Ui on a lot of them is archaic. Apple have been updating many but some, like the Exs24 sampler still look very 1999. Alchemy is fantastic and cost pretty much the same as the whole of Logic before Apple bought camel audio. Add in CamelPhat and camelspaxe, two of my favourite plug ins, and the camel stuff did cost more than Logic. And they’re all included.\n\nIf you are creating, logic gives you much much more. If you are just mixing audio tracks then GarageBand is probably enough unless you want to be able to stretch, tune and warp the audio.\n\nFor the price of a decent limiter, Logic also adds a lot of tools for mixing and mastering. It also has lots of mixing features such as busses, aux tracks, track grouping, etc.\n\nLogic is far more pro than GB but this brings with it lots of baggage too. Logic can be quite hard to get your head around sometimes and in places it’s age is showing. It can feel sometimes like some of the features are inelegantly bolted on.\n\nBut there’s an easy answer. GarageBand is free and it’s projects can be opened in Logic. Start with GB and if you find it’s limiting you too much then there’s an easy upgrade path. And it’s a pretty huge upgrade.\n\nWell, I've just spent the last hour or so recording guitar into GarageBand on my Mac, and it's already a much nicer experience.\n\nBeing able to loop sections is great, for instance. And so is combining the iPad and the K-Mix into an aggregate device so I can record Egoist. No MIDI sync between iPad and Mac, which is a shame, so that's probably one reason to get Logic.\n\nSo, a good decision so far. I will keep digging around, and see if there's anything else I'm lacking. One big one is still not being able to copy/export a region of audio.\n\n@klownshed Thanks for the detailed rundown. It seems like GB is enough for now.\n\nBeen using logic since version 5 on the PC, and the big selling point was Logic has the best stock plugins of the DAW’s. The compressor, convolution reverb, EQ, amp modeler, and pedalboard especially leave nothing to be desired. The soft instruments library and the tight integration with the EXS24 sampler for making new instruments is great.\n\nI was starting to learn Ableton, but there were so many roadblocks for doing things that are easy with logic. I decided I just needed to learn logic’s arrangement tools better, for being fluid trying different arrangements. And once you get your key commands down, you can fly with the editing.\n\nLately I’ve been using Shuffle mode for piecing a podcast together, very handy and quick. Tons of great, time saving editing tools hiding in there. Done some sound for video with it as well, and was impressed how painless it was to sync things with the video and replace the audio with your mix. Dabbled in some surround sound as well, again, things work the way you think they would work.\n\nThere are many choices for DAW’s and honestly they are all pretty good at this point. I stuck with Logic for the quality of the stock effects, and because whatever my problem was, there’d always been a way to move forward."
