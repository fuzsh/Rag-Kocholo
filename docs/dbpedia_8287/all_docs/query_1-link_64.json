        "text": "1. Which of the following statements express the purpose of logic models, as presented in this CORAL cell? (True/False?)\n\n1. Program stakeholders can gain a better understanding of the program from its logic model.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\n1. True: Communicating information about a program to stakeholders in a reader-friendly, visual manner is one of the purposes of a logic model.\n\n2. Logic models can help us identify which types of information are most relevant for evaluating a program’s effectiveness.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\n2. True: Our expectations about a program, as represented in a logic model, provide a foundation for identifying pertinent performance measurement data with which to evaluate a program’s effectiveness.\n\n3. Unrealistic expectations about how program outcomes will be achieved can be flagged by developing a logic model.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\n3. True: The process of developing a logic model allows us to verify that our expectations for the program’s effectiveness are sound and realistic.\n\n4. Once a logic model has been developed, the evaluation of a program is complete.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\n4. False: Logic models guide the development of program evaluation strategies, but they do not constitute a completed program evaluation in and of themselves.\n\n5. Logic models are a tool for evaluating the efficiency with which a program is delivered.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\n5. False: Though the components of a logic model could be used as one source of information for evaluating how efficiently a program is delivered, logic models are most directly pertinent to the evaluation of a program’s effectiveness.\n\n6. When there is evidence that a program is not achieving its expected outcomes, a logic model can help us interpret this information and understand why.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\n6. True: 1. A logic model depicts how we anticipate that expected outcomes will be achieved. When a program outcome is not achieved, we can refer back to the logic model in order to verify whether the inputs, activities, and outputs leading to this outcome occurred as planned. If on the other hand they DID occur as planned, this could be an indication that the logic model was not sound and/or that influences external to the program are hampering the program’s effectiveness.\n\nWhich of the following statements about the components of a logic model are True/False?\n\n1. The expected outcomes must first be achieved before the program’s products and services can be delivered.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\n1. True: 1. Program activities are the actions carried out, using the resources invested in the program.\n\n2. Activities are the actions taken to produce products and services.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\n2. True: Our expectations about a program, as represented in a logic model, provide a foundation for identifying pertinent performance measurement data with which to evaluate a program’s effectiveness.\n\n3. The components of a logic model illustrate our expectations regarding how the invested resources (inputs) are used (activities) to produce products and services (outputs) that result in intended changes (outcomes).\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\n3. True: Program logic models typically represent our logical/reasonable assumptions regarding how the program inputs, activities, and outputs will lead to expected program outcomes.\n\n4. (BONUS) Immediate outcomes are more directly within the control of the program than are intermediate and ultimate outcomes.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse"
