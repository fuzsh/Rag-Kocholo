        "text": "What is a PLC and PLC programming\n\nA programmable logic controller (PLC) is a modular industrial computer used to automate the processes through real-time data collection. PLC programming is special computer code language used to control factory machines or processes. Bit Logic (1’s and 0’s) are what makes up the core foundation of the PLC code. A PLC monitors machinery through input devices, uses their vitals to make decisions and deploys control output to take actions based on the results of the program logic.\n\nPLC programming is the real reason this industrial unit has become the standard system for control and automation in industries. Through PLCs, engineers don’t need to rewire every time a change occurs in the industrial process. They can simply program the PLCs again to serve the new purpose, saving time and resources!\n\nHere are three major components you will find in a PLC\n\nI/O modules\n\nAn I/O module in the PLC can be analog inputs, analog outputs, digital inputs, digital outputs, or a combination of the these. The I/O module is the bridge between I/O devices and the command unit. The input module collects information in the form of signals from actuators, sensors, switches, or push buttons. After processing according to the programmed logic of the PLC, the output modules send the signals to control devices like relays, valves, motor starters, alarms, and pumps.\n\nA CPU module\n\nBased on a microprocessor, the CPU module deals with all the processing and mathematical manipulation involved in the automation processes. It energizes or de-energizes the output in response to the input, manipulates memory locations, performs arithmetic and logical operations, transfers data between the ladder logic and itself, and executes the application program.\n\nYou will find two types of programs in a PLC CPU:\n\nOperating System –Supervisory set of permanent instructions loaded during manufacturing.\n\nApplication Program –A customized program that determines the functionality of PLC on the basis of the customers’ demands.\n\nProgramming Device\n\nThe key component required for PLC programming is an external programming device. A PLC programming device can be a hand-held unit, a PC, or a desktop unit. Some of these require software, while others need a special interfacing card to interface with a PLC. An application program, generally in the form of ladder logic or C, is created in these devices and loaded into the PLC.\n\nOnce transferred, the programming device can connect to other PLCs to load other application software in their non-volatile memory. Hence, PLCs do not require a connection with a programming device to function.\n\nThe inception of PLC Programming\n\nIt was in 1968 that PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) was first invented before which industries and companies used relays to control their processes. PLC programming is basically giving the controller the required instructions in a form that the PLC can interpret. When General Motors designed specifications for a standard machine controller, they added some requirements to be met for the PLCs to be manufactured, which included modularity and expandability as well as its ability to be easily programmed and reprogrammed. The Bedford Associates produced the first PLC, named Modicon 084.\n\nAlthough all computers use Boolean logic, the industrial engineers used ladder diagrams incorporated by the previously used relay systems. Richard E. Morley came up with the idea to use ladder logic in the control system, which made the PLC programming easier to understand for those engineers. Initially, there was no proper way to document the PLC programs, and so they needed to be hand-written or drawn using draft boards. Then in the 1980s, as computers became more common, PLC programs were made on them as they were much faster than previously used methods. And today, PCs have become a lot faster than in the previous decades, and PLC programming is done using them!\n\nHow does PLC programming work?\n\nPLC programming usually refers to creating internal logic in a PLC, using a specific programming logic recognized by the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) standards.\n\nThere are two programs running in a PLC: the operating system and the user program.\n\nThe Operating System:\n\nThe operating system is the built-in PLC software that allows it to turn on, determine instruction sequences and implement all functions other than those related to control.\n\nImportant duties of a PLC OS are:\n\nHot and Cold Start\n\nInterrupt Handling\n\nExecuting Custom User Programs\n\nInterfacing with External Programmable Devices\n\nDealing and Updating the I/O Device Data\n\nThe User Program:\n\nThe user program, added into the PLC according to the user requirements, uses an IEC standard programming language and implements control functions such as fault detection, temperature control, automatic filling system, stopping and starting escalators and elevators, etc.\n\nThe user program consists of multiple functions that allow the industry to dictate the output of PLC. Unlike the operating system, the user program is editable, making PLC a popular control device.\n\nProfessional PLC manufacturers have pre-designed user program logics and templates to decrease the overall deployment time. Once you make the order, they can make final changes to these pre-made implementations to create the final product.\n\nYou can stay in contact with your professional team to generate continuous upgrades and error handling according to your industry’s requirements. Also, every time you decide to introduce changes, your trusted team of professionals can make the necessary changes in the user program to complement the new processes.\n\nHence, you do not need to have your user program created from scratch every time a change arises in your factory or facility.\n\nPLC Programming Languages:\n\nLadder logic revolutionized the field of PLC programming and hiked the popularity of Modicon 084, the first PLC in the 1960s. Morley’s genius idea dominated PLC programming for years until IEC was formed, and today, there are five internationally acceptable PLC programming languages under IEC61131-3. These languages can be divided into two categories:\n\nTextual Programming Languages\n\nInstructions List (IL)\n\nStructured List (SL)\n\nGraphical Programming Languages\n\nLadder Diagram (LD)\n\nSequential Flow Chart (SFC)\n\nFunction Block Diagram (FBD)\n\nInstructions List (IL):\n\nInstructions list closely resembles assembly language and is commonly known as “Op-code.” Due to its textual nature, it consumes very little space. Hence, it works best with hand-held devices with limited memory but higher portability. You may recognize it by the symbols it uses, for instance, Input=I, Output=Q, Counter=C, and so on.\n\nHowever, many programmers do not prefer Instructions Lists as it demands a large amount of time to detect bugs, maintenance and updates are harder due to their non-visual structure, and complex mathematical functions are hard to implement through them.\n\nSome key features of the Instructions List are:\n\nConsists of lines of code, with each line representing exactly one operation\n\nStep-by-Step Layout\n\nEasier addition of simple mathematical functions\n\nPortability and multi-hardware support\n\nFaster execution in PLCs\n\nEditable without software, mouse, or laptop due to simple lines of code\n\nSuitable for simple and small PLC programs\n\nStructured List (SL):\n\nStructured language is a popular programming language that resembles high-level languages like PASCAL, C, and C++. It includes decision loops, case statements, IF-Then logic, and other features of high-level languages, making it one of the most powerful PLC programming languages to exist. Structured List is quickly being adopted out of all the IEC standard languages, and today hybrid languages involving SL and LD designs are also available.\n\nDue to its textual nature, it requires proper structuring for easier maintenance, and it is not available on all makes and models of PLCs.\n\nSome key features of Structured List are:\n\nConsists of decision loops, pointers, and case statements\n\nIndents, list spacing, and loop structure layout\n\nQuick addition of complex process logic\n\nHighly portable from one hardware to another\n\nFaster execution in PLCs than graphical languages\n\nEasily understandable for fresh graduates\n\nSuitable for large and complex PLC programs\n\nSequential Flow Chart (SFC):\n\nSequential flowchart is the simplest type of PLC programming language, consisting of only decision logics. It is similar in form and operation to the flowcharts programming students learn to make in their early days, with a start point, decision boxes, and actions boxes. Inside the action boxes, there is a repeatable set of instructions written in a language of programmers’ choice; for instance, a pick and drop task involves only one active set of instructions with exceptions.\n\nSFC programming can lead to extremely long charts if the logic is complex and is not convertible into any other language.\n\nFunction Block Diagram (FBD):\n\nFunctional block is the second most popular programming language due to its graphical nature and easy-to-read structure. It resembles a ‘wiring structure,’ connected together in an easy-to-follow path.\n\nSome key features of the Function Block Diagram are:\n\nEasiest to read\n\nSuitable for simple programs that implement digital logic\n\nVisually understandable for most viewers\n\nRequires large space\n\nFlow is hard to design and requires pre-planning\n\nLadder Logic (LD):\n\nLadder Logic is the most widely utilized PLC programming language all over the world, and rightly so. With its control-circuit-like structure, consisting of rungs and power rails on either side, this language was a convenient alternative to the relay logic of the 70s.\n\nLadder logic rungs have symbols representing the element connected to them, including contact symbols, comparisons, timer delays, output symbols, etc. As each input becomes ‘true,’ the outputs become activated.\n\nSome key features of Ladder Logic are:\n\nConsists of symbols, rungs, and power-rails\n\nWire-like graphical layout\n\nImplements timers, comparisons, basic math, trigonometry, and data analysis\n\nSuitable for both simple and complex programs\n\nExtensively large ladder handling is difficult\n\nIt can be directly implemented without pre-planning\n\nSuitable for programmers and non-programmers alike\n\nTroubleshooting, bug handling, and maintenance are quick and simple\n\nWhy do you need effective PLC Programming?\n\nPLCs can increase production, reduce workforce and duplication and save you from expensive shut-downs and equipment malfunctions. But for that, you need an effectively programmed PLC.\n\nBy getting your PLC programmed by skilled professionals, you can unlock its full potential. Otherwise, your investment in the automation system can go directly down the drain.\n\nHere’s how effective PLC programming can help your business:\n\nScalability: With effective PLC programming, you can future-proof your workplace and keep the options of scaling your equipment open.\n\nIntegrating new equipment: Skilled programmers will reduce your expenses of reprogramming every time different system integration is introduced. You will be able to integrate new equipment without updating or renewing your PLC programs.\n\nHigh performance: Correct PLC programming means you are not underutilizing any of your machines and equipment’s capacity or capability.\n\nEnhanced Security: Your programming expert will ensure that your PLC-based system prevents your machines from malfunctioning, going out of sync, working beyond their capacity, or breaking down due to temperature hikes.\n\nSafety from Cyber Threats: Technological advancements have increased the threats of cyber-attacks and data theft. By employing a skilled set of professionals, you will be able to ensure that your systems are robust and resilient from external attacks.\n\nHow You Can Choose a Skilled PLC Programmer\n\nBefore hiring a programmer to program your PLC for it to work perfectly as you desire, you need to ensure that he has the following skills:\n\nKnows Multiple Languages:\n\nLadder logic is the most widely used PLC programming language because of its graphical styles, but it isn’t the only one. The standard IEC 61131 has multiple PLC programming languages that can be used to program the PLC.\n\nSee which one suits your style and which one you are comfortable working with since the control of your entire system will depend on it. Since your PLC programmer will know multiple languages, he can guide you through all of them, which can help you with the selection process.\n\nCan Incorporate a Modular Design:\n\nModularity in your PLC system will increase the system’s flexibility which will allow you to do multiple tasks easily, like adding I/O devices or organizing the system for better usability. Your PLC programmer should be able to know how to do that.\n\nConfigure Error Messages Properly:\n\nConfiguring error or fault messages across all devices helps to provide a standardized message system that will assist you in understanding any issue anywhere in the system. In case of improper configuration, you may not be able to understand what exactly the problem was, and so you might not be able to solve it!\n\nProper Coding and Commenting:\n\nOnce the code has been written, it may be needed to make some alterations in case of any required changes or some error. If the structure isn’t according to how you wanted it to be or has not been commented on properly, this process may be hideous and difficult. A PLC programmer that will code according to your preferred structure with proper commenting practices can prove to be highly beneficial in the long run.\n\nSimplest PLC Ladder Logic Elements\n\nThese are some, but not all, of the logic elements (also called programming instructions) found in PLC programs\n\nAdvanced PLC Ladder Logic Elements:\n\nThese are some, but not all, of the more advanced PLC instructions\n\nUser-Created PLC Ladder Logic Elements:\n\nThese are some examples of user created PLC instructions\n\nPLC Programming Tag Structures:\n\nThese are some examples of PLC tag structures\n\nPLC Programming Languages:\n\nThese are four typical languages that can be used to program a PLC. They can all be used for any of these applications, but sometimes are better suited for what they were traditionally used to accomplish.\n\nYou can find the full instruction set for a PLC here.
