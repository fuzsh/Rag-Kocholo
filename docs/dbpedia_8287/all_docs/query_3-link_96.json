        "text": "I had a few piano songs recorded in Reason. But i wanted to copy the midi from Reason to Logic because thatâs the softwareÂ I use to record things now.\n\nLast time I used Reason was when version 3 was released. So it was quite a long time ago. Could it have been around 2006? Howeverâ¦ my first thought was to get hold of Reason 3 somehow and see if i could manually copy the midi tracks. Turns out that wasnât needed at all.\n\nReason 9\n\nPropellerhead has made Reason 9 available to use as a trialÂ for 30 days. So i installed the trial version and tried to open my old recordings. And thankfully it worked well! Even if i used some plugins or instruments that didnât exist in the new version i could still see that the song was there, but i couldnât listen to it.Â If you get this window when opening your song you can just close it.\n\nNext click the FileÂ menu and select Export midi fileâ¦ and save it where ever you like.\n\nLogic\n\nNow open up a new project in Logic and go to File-> import -> Midi file and select the midi file you just exported from Reason.\n\nLogic will add the tracks for you. You will get a question about the tempo of the song. i choose not to import the tempo. Not sure why thoughâ¦ iâm a developerâ¦ not a producerâ¦ donât ask me those hard questions!"
