You will use it to add Swift or Objective-C code to your iOS application.\n\nThe Kotlin plugin is bundled with each Android Studio release. However, it still needs to be updated to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.\n\nTo update the plugin, on the Android Studio welcome screen, select Plugins | Installed. Click Update next to Kotlin. You can also check the Kotlin version in Tools | Kotlin | Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates.\n\nThe Kotlin plugin should be compatible with the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin. Refer to the compatibility table."
