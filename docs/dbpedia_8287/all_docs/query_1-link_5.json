You can view and change these parameters in the Object inspector, shown in the Environment when an object is selected.\n\nThe following parameters are shared by all object types:\n\nName: Appears next to the disclosure arrow and can be edited by clicking. You can also edit the name by clicking the object with the Text tool.\n\nIcon: Represents the object in the Environment and main window, and can be changed by clicking.\n\nAssignable checkbox: Makes the object visible in the Reassign Track shortcut menu in the Tracks area. (See Assign tracks to different channel strips.) This is useful for instrument objects, but can also be useful for other objects such as touch tracks and chord memorizers."
