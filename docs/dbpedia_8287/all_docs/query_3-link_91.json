        "text": "According to Statista, JavaScript is the number one most popular programming language among developers worldwide, with Java ranking in seventh place [1]. Though Java and JavaScript share half of a name, the two are far from the same. When looking at Java versus JavaScript syntax, you can see they look pretty different on the surface, and the differences go much deeper than that.\n\nLetâs look at both Java and JavaScript's differences, history, features, uses, advantages, and disadvantages.\n\nWhat is the difference between Java and JavaScript?\n\nWhen considering Java versus JavaScript, youâll notice a few key differences. Java is a compiled language, meaning that you write code, then run it through a compiler and create bytecode. The bytecode is then run in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is likely the software you have on your computer. JavaScript is an interpreted language. It doesnât get compiled but is interpreted as the script runs. It's commonly used to create interactive websites. Youâre reading this right now on a page running JavaScript.\n\nWhat is Java?\n\nJava launched with a âWrite once, run anywhereâ promise. Since its launch, it quickly became very popular for creating client and server-side applications. It has a similar syntax to C and C++. Still, it is easier to understand and has fewer low-level features because that functionality is handled automatically by the compiler and JVM.\n\nRead more: Java vs. C++: What are the Differences in These Programming Languages?\n\nFeatures of Java\n\nJava has been around for some time, and as such, has developed a large community with a host of tools and educational content related to the language.\n\nItâs on par or faster than most other modern compiled languages and much faster than interpreted languages, making it a good choice for robust native applications. Unlike JavaScript, Java is a multi-threaded language, meaning it can do multiple things simultaneously rather than wait for each task to finish before beginning the next one.\n\nJava is very secure. It has private methods and variables built in, so there can be no unauthorized access to the underlying data and functionality. Additionally, the compiled app runs in a virtual machine which keeps itself separate from the underlying device it is running on.\n\nWhat is Java used for?\n\nAlmost any desktop application, mobile application, game, website backend, or server can be created using Java, and it can even run machines. Wikipedia uses Java to execute its queries when you search on their website or app, and it even controls the systems in Mars rovers. Netflix, Google, Twitter, and several other big-name tech companies all use Java in some form to provide their services.Â\n\nAdvantages of Java\n\nThere are many reasons why Java is one of the most widely used programming languages. Designed to be easy to use, Java is simpler to write and makes it easier to compile, debug and learn than other languages. Itâs also an object-oriented programming language, meaning you can create modular programs and reusable code. One of Javaâs most significant advantages is that itâs platform-independent. Itâs able to move easily from one computer system to another.\n\nJava is a robust language. Because itâs easy to use, platform independent, and has security features, it has become a language of choice for building internet of things.\n\nDisadvantagesÂ of Java\n\nThough Java touts many excellent qualities, it lacks in performance. Java tends to run more slowly than languages like C and C++ and consumes a significant amount of memory. That extra memory is going to require more hardware to keep things running. More hardware means more money spent. Lastly, there is virtually no support for low-level programming.Â\n\nWhat is JavaScript?\n\nJavaScript has no direct relation to Java besides being used for web technologies. The name choice was a marketing move to encourage adoption.\n\nFeatures of JavaScript\n\nJavaScript has critical features that led to its widespread adoption. It runs live in the browser without having to compile beforehand, a process called just-in-time compilation. Every major web browser uses the language. It is responsible for many of the interactions you see on websites, like fetching new data without reloading the page, animations, checking forms for errors, chatting, posting comments, and much more.\n\nWhat is JavaScriptÂ used for?\n\nJavaScript is used by 98.8 percent of all websites as of November 2023, according to W3Techs [2]. There are over 1.98 billion websites on the internet today, according to First Site Guide [3]. Thatâs a lot of JavaScript. It can turn a static brochure-style website into a functioning application that lives in your web browser.\n\nItâs not only for the front end, though. JavaScript can run in Node environments, allowing you to write JavaScript for the back end. It can perform routing, controller functions, an API service, or all of those things at once. Node enables you to have a fully JavaScript stack.\n\nYou can also make games in JavaScript. It is particularly suited for mobile and browser games, meaning you can make games for almost any device with a web browser.Â\n\nAdvantages of JavaScript\n\nThe ability to run in a browser is a massive advantage for JavaScript. Itâs one of the reasons that it has been the more popular language used in GitHub projects for several years in a row. Web browsers exist on a wide array of devices. All desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones have browsers, and many game consoles and smart TVs also have browsers.\n\nWhen considering Java versus JavaScript for web development, JavaScriptâs extreme versatility makes it an excellent choice. Being a full-stack engineer no longer means you must learn multiple languages. You have to know an array of ideas, patterns, and paradigms, but you only need one syntax to bring all of it together.\n\nRead more: What is a Full-Stack Developer?\n\nBecause of its popularity and pervasiveness, thereâs an abundance of educational material about JavaScript. You can find books, videos, courses, articles, and podcasts on just about every facet of the technology. Itâs not difficult to find someone with the information you need to accomplish your goal.\n\nDisadvantagesÂ of JavaScript\n\nEven though every modern browser runs JavaScript, different browsers can sometimes behave a bit differently. Browsers have code that interprets the JavaScript at runtime called engines. Chrome and Brave, for example, use the V8 engine, while Firefox uses the SpiderMonkey engine. These engines often interpret the code in the same way, but there are instances where there is different behavior than you might expect. Thereâs always a workaround for consistent behavior and plenty of resources documenting the flaws and fixing them.\n\nSome may say that JavaScript's dependence on the browser is a flaw. While the statement is somewhat true, as mentioned, it can now run in different environments with Node. And with tools like React Native, you can create stand-alone apps that run on the most popular environments, like Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android. Thereâs a learning curve you should be aware of, though.\n\nSpeed is another factor to consider. Programming languages are technically just doing complicated math very, very quickly. JavaScript is a high-level language, meaning itâs abstracted from the low-level workings of the computer it is running on. Reducing high-level programming calculations to low-level execution takes time. Itâs not much time by human standards, but it will start to be noticeable over a few thousand functions and calculations.\n\nStart learning Java or JavaScript today on Coursera\n\nWhether you're just getting started with programming or want to level up by learning a new language, you can learn at your own pace from leading companies and universities on Coursera.\n\nIf JavaScript will be your first programming language, consider enrolling in an introductory online course like JavaScript for Beginners from the University of California, Davis. You'll also practice working with jQuery.\n\nIf you have experience with another programming language already, focus on Java fundamentals like data analysis, debugging, and design with an online course like Object Oriented Programming in Java from Duke University."
