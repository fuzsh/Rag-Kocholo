        "text": "What’s a Smart Form?\n\nIn the most basic sense, smart forms are dynamic. Instead of static, smart forms can change the fields and questions based on how a user interacts with your form using conditional logic. If you need to segment questions to different types of users or perform complex calculations, smart forms can get the job done.\n\nWhat is conditional logic?\n\nConditional logic uses IF/THEN checks to determine an outcome. The IF statement is the condition or trigger while THEN is the action to perform or outcome. Conditional logic has since then evolved into a framework used to automate workflows.\n\nWhen is conditional logic needed most?\n\nConditional logic is useful when you need to perform tasks conditionally — like performing calculations, sending a custom email, showing a message, or toggling certain form elements’ visibility — based on how a form filler answers the questions on your form.\n\nWhy is conditional logic important?\n\nConditional logic helps cut out user error by automating tasks. Here are some scenarios where conditional logic could come in handy:\n\nSending emails to different addresses according to user answers\n\nShowing additional questions when a user chooses a specific answer\n\nSkipping pages in a multipage survey depending on user answers\n\nOffering different PDF downloads depending on the user’s choice\n\nShowing a different Thank-You message based on user answers to a quiz\n\nPassword protecting a form\n\nNot showing the submit button until the user makes a particular choice\n\nSign up for Jotform so you can create smart forms.\n\nHow to add conditional logic to your form\n\nTo create conditional logic\n\nIn the Form Builder, go to Settings at the top.\n\nSelect Conditions on the left.\n\nChoose and configure your desired conditional logic type.\n\nHere’s what each conditional logic type can do:\n\nShow/Hide Field — Change form elements’ visibility. Useful for showing follow-up questions or implementing conditional access to form fields. See How to Show or Hide Fields Conditionally to learn more.\n\nUpdate/Calculate Field — Assign a value or perform calculations to form fields. See How to Insert Text or Calculation Into a Field for more information.\n\nEnable/Require/Mask Field — Toggle form fields’ “required” flags or implement an input mask. See How to Conditionally Make a Field Required and How to Set an Input Mask Conditionally to learn more.\n\nSkip To/Hide a Page — Skip Logic allows you to jump to or change the visibility of a form page. See How to Skip Pages Using Conditional Logic for more information.\n\nChange Thank You Page — Display a custom message or redirect your form after submission. See How to Change Your Thank You Message Using Conditional Logic and How to Redirect Your Form Conditionally to learn more.\n\nChange E-mail Recipient — Override your default email alerts. See How to Send Emails Conditionally for more information.\n\nOnce you’re done, save and test your interactive form. Ensure that the condition is working properly before adding more conditions.\n\nIntroduction to Form Building\n\nAdding Conditional Logic Elements\n\nGo to course :Adding Conditional Logic Elements"
