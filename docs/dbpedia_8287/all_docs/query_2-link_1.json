Plug-in creation is in real time, which means that you can change and test your plug-in functions immediately. You can define interface elements, such as sliders and menus, that are shown in the Scripter plug-in window and can create the underlying logic and functions addressed by these onscreen controls. Some examples of utilities you can create with the Scripter plug-in are a chord strummer, a legato processor for stringed instruments, a harp glissando generator, and an algorithmic composer."
