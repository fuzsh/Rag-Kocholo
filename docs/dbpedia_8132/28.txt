Lloyd, the son of an itinerant commercial photographer, began acting as a child. He settled in San Diego, California, where in 1913 he started playing minor parts in one-reel comedies. He mastered the art of the comic chase in the short time he was a member of Mack Sennett’s Keystone comedy troupe. In 1915 Lloyd joined the new acting company formed by Hal Roach, a former actor who had turned producer. During this period he experimented with a comic character, the bewhiskered Willie Work. The most consistently successful of his early films, however, were those of the Lonesome Luke series, which began with Spit-Ball Sadie (1915). Luke quickly became a popular American screen character, appearing in dozens of movies over the next two years.

By 1918 the figure of the ordinary white-faced man in round glasses had replaced Luke as Lloyd’s screen trademark. This persona eclipsed Lonesome Luke in popularity, and by 1922 Lloyd was making feature-length movies. He developed his humour from plot and situation and was the first comedian to use physical danger as a source of laughter. Lloyd performed his own stunts and was known as the screen’s most daring comedian. In Safety Last! (1923), an outstanding success, he hung from the hands of a clock several stories above a city street; in Girl Shy (1924) he took a thrilling ride atop a runaway streetcar; in The Freshman (1925), one of the most successful of all silent pictures, he stood in for the football tackling dummy.
