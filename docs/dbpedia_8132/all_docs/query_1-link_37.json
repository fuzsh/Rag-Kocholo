        "text": "In the 1985 movie \"Back to the Future\", Christopher Lloyd's Doc Brown character requires 1.21 gigawatts of electricity to power his DeLorean time machine and travel through time.\n\nIn a similarly outsized manner, Post Malone's \"F-1 Trillion\" album, recently announced as arriving on Aug. 16 appears to be engineered for riding roughshod like a mega-sized Ford truck over country and pop's mainstream in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nDrive near Music Row and in the shadow of The Tennessean's offices, the 36x38 foot \"Nashville sign\" hearkens to the arrival of pop-to-country crossover superstar Malone's sixth studio album.\n\nPost Malone's successful two-week turn as a country and pop superstar\n\nMalone's entree into country music continues to grow more entrenched in Music City by the day.\n\nIn the past two weeks, he's spent time making appearances at CMA Fest alongside Blake Shelton, playing his classic hits at a 700-acre farm at the Bonnaroo Festival in Manchester, Tennessee (featuring a guest appearance by Billy Strings), while on Monday night, he played an intimate songwriting round set (featuring ERNEST, Lainey Wilson, and chart-topping songwriter Ashley Gorley) of acoustic takes on hits and unreleased songs at West Nashville's legendary Bluebird Cafe.\n\nThis follows a consistent series of stops in Nashville over the past year, presumably compiling the work that will reveal itself as \"F-1 Trillion.\"\n\nRumored album guests include Luke Combs, ERNEST, Blake Shelton and Wilson, among many others.\n\n'I Had Some Help': Morgan Wallen collab soars\n\nIt would seem evident that Malone's Morgan Wallen collaboration \"I Had Some Help\" would appear on \"F-1 Trillion.\" In a manner consistent with the immediate success of Wallen's 2023 smash \"Last Night,\" his latest has already assumed a month-plus long grip on the top of Billboard's all-genre Hot 100 chart.\n\nIt's also swiftly rising at country radio.\n\nHow quickly?\n\nOutside of Garth Brooks' \"More Than A Memory\" in 2007, \"I Had Some Help\" is the fastest-rising single on the country charts in 20 years.\n\nOnly five songs, including \"I Had Some Help\" and \"More Than A Memory,\" have reached the top 10 on country's charts in under a month in a quarter century: Alan Jackson's \"Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning),\" Darryl Worley's \"Have You Forgotten?\" and Tim McGraw's \"Live Like You Were Dying.\"\n\nThe single was written by Malone, Wallen, Grammy-nominated producer Louis Bell, Ryan Vojtesak, recent CMA Triple Play Award winner and 75-plus-time country chart-topping songwriter Gorley, ERNEST, Chandler Walters, and Hoskins. Bell, Charlie Handsome, and Hoskins produced the track.\n\nWhat else can be expected on 'F-1 Trillion?'\n\nAs he noted at the Stagecoach Festival, Malone \"f***ing loves\" country music.\n\nTo wit, he has nearly two dozen country and Americana favorites he's capably performed in a live setting over the past five years.\n\nThus, the broadest spread possible of the genre's influences could be expected on the album.\n\nAt Stagecoach, Malone brought out special guests for his first-ever 45-minute country cover set on the Mane Stage. The event included appearances from Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley and Sara Evans.\n\nHis set opened with Tyler Childers' \"Whitehouse Road.\" Yoakam joined for \"Little Ways,\" Paisley for \"I'm Gonna Miss Her\" and Vince Gill's 1992 hit \"One More Last Chance.\" Evans arrived and performed \"Suds in the Bucket.\"\n\nMalone also played Tim McGraw's \"Don't Take The Girl,\" John Michael Montgomery's \"Be My Baby Tonight,\" \"Chattahoochee\" by Alan Jackson, Toby Keith's \"Who's Your Daddy\" and George Strait's 1995 chart-topper \"Check Yes or No.\"\n\nFive months prior, at 2023's CMA Awards, the \"Rockstar\" vocalist sang Joe Diffie's \"John Deere Green\" and \"Pickup Man\" with HARDY and Wallen.\n\nOther highlight moments in years past included performances of Sturgill Simpson's \"You Can Have the Crown\" and Paisley's \"I'm Gonna Miss Her\" during Matthew McConaughey's \"We're Texas\" fundraising event after Winter Storm Uri in 2021."
