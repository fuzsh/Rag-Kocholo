        "text": ".\n\n.\n\nThe actor Harold Lloyd belongs to the most popular comedian stars of the silent movie era.\n\nIt all began in 1912 when Harold Lloyd got first engagements as an extra for the Edison Company. Only one year later he was already in Hollywood where he met another extra with the name Hal Roach. When Hal Roach made an inheritance of 3'000 dollars the same year, Roach became a producer and signed Harold Lloyd on as his star comedian.\n\nAfter some less successful movies where they both looked for an independent character, they shot movies like \"The Old Monk's Tale\" (13), \"Hide and Seek\" (13), \"Algy on the Force\" (13) and \"Miss Fatty's Seaside Lovers\" (15).\n\nFinally the figure of Lonesome Luke came into being who Harold Lloyd impersonated in countless movies between 1915 and 1917. That this figure was an imitation of Chaplin wasn't to overlook but still the movies had a great success. To these movies belong \"Lonesome Luke\" (15), \"Lonesome Luke, Social Gangster\" (15), \"Luke and the Rural Roughnecks\" (16), \"Lonesome Luke, Circus King\" (16), \"Luke, the Gladiator\" (16), \"Luke's Double\" (16), \"Luke Laughs Last\" (16), \"Luke Joins the Navy\" (16), \"Luke's Lost Liberty\" (17), \"Luke's Busy Day\" (17), \"Stop! Luke! Listen!\" (17) and \"Lonesome Luke Loses Patients\" (17).\n\nHarold Lloyd found his real character only in 1917. He left the makeup out and instead of it he fitted himself out with a circular, prominent horn-rimmed spectacles - his straw hat followed later. With this figure he created the shy young man next door who intended to do his best but time and again was his own impediment.\n\nIn the following three years came many other movies into being, among them \"The Lamb\" (18), \"A Gasoline Wedding\" (18), \"Kicked Out\" (18), \"The City Slicker\" (18), \"Take a Chance\" (18), \"She Loves Me Not\" (18), \"On the Fire\" (19), \"Si, Senor\" (19), \"The Marathon\" (19), \"Heap Big Chief\" (19), \"His Only Father\" (19) and \"Captain Kidd's Kids\" (19).\n\nThe 20's began very unlucky for Harold Lloyd. When he posed for publicity photos and hold a bomb dummy for a shot, the bomb dummy turned out to be real. Harold Lloyd lost his thumb and his forefinger of the right hand when the bomb exploded, moreover he was blind for a time.\n\nWhen his eyesight came back he returned to the big schreen. He concealed his disabled hand with a flesh-coloured glove so that the audience didn't get his injury.\n\nHarold Lloyd inspired the audience with hair-raising stunts and with gags aiming at the risible muscle.. To his great successes for Hal Roach belong among others \"Haunted Spooks\" (20), \"High and Dizzy\" (20), \"Number, Please?\" (20), \"I Do\" (21), after that followed first feature films like \"A Sailor-Made Man\" (21), \"Grandma's Boy\" (22), \"Doctor Jack\" (22), \"Safety Last\" (23) with his most famous scene where he hung at a come loose dial on a tower block and \"Why Worry?\" (23).\n\nHarold Lloyd got married with the actress Mildred Davis in 1923 and left Hal Roach to become his own producer. He realised the well-constructed movies \"Girl Shy\" (24), \"The Freshman\" (25), \"For Heaven's Sake\" (26) and \"The Kid Brother\" (27), which marked the height of his career.\n\nAlthough his first talkies were much promising - \"Welcome Danger\" (29) and \"Feet First\" (31) - he went through a bitter setback with \"Movie Crazy\" (32). He began to experiment with different kind of comedies and shot \"The Cat's Paw\" (34) and appeared under Leo McCarey's direction in \"The Milky Way\" (36). But new comedians controlles the film business now, Harold Lloyd was push awas continuous.\n\nHe took part in \"Professor Beware\" (38), after that it lasted nine years till he appeared in his last movie \"The Sin of Harold Diddlebock\" (47).\n\nHarold Lloyd's lifework was crowned with the Honorary Award in 1953.\n\nOther movies with Harold Lloyd:\n\nCupid in the Dental Parlor (13) The Twelfth Juror (13) Hulda of Holland (13) His Chum the Baron (13) Curses!
