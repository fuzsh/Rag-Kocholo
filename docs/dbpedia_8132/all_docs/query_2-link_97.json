        "text": "A silent movie has won the academy award! Wow. In addition to best picture, The Artist won academy awards for best director, costume design, original score, and performance by an actor. What with all the hype, you may even be tempted to see it.\n\nI’ve been looking for it to come to my theatre for months, but I’m still waiting, and will probably be waiting a while longer.\n\nSo while I wait, I have newsflash for you: silent movies are awesome! I’ve been watching them via Silent Sunday Nights on TCM for many years now. They can take you on an emotional roller coaster and catharsis just like the talkies can.\n\nIf you’ve never watched a silent film, you’re missing out. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of bad ones out there, just as with current movies. Sometimes, one rotten one can spoil the whole experience.\n\nI could give you a list of standard must-see silent films starting with The Hunch-back of Notre Dame, Nosferatu, and The Phantom of the Opera; a list of the great influencers like Metropolis and The Birth of a Nation; or ones with famous actors like The Gold Rush, Son of the Sheik, City Lights, and The Freshman.\n\nI could… but (since I haven’t seen it myself yet–it sounds like a more sober Singin’ in the Rain) I read a review that said The Artist was just plain fun. So instead of choosing the ‘greats’ I chose the movies that made me fall in love with silents–and ones that will make you feel good. Well, mostly.\n\nThe Kid (1921) this Charlie Chaplin plays his beloved Tramp who finds and cares for an abandoned baby. When the child reaches age 5, his birth mother finds him. For a long time, I avoided Charlie Chaplin because I just didn’t feel he was for me. This movie proved that wrong.\n\nGirl Shy (1924) Harold Lloyd, a famous silents comedian stars in this film about a socially inept (at least when it comes to girls) boy who falls in love. Again, I didn’t think Lloyd was my style, and I don’t like some of his other films, but this one held my attention the whole way through and was fun to watch.\n\nMy Next Suggestion is kind of cheating… Mary Pickford. That would be it. I can’t think of one of her movies that I don’t like, but those listed below are some of my absolute favorites. Known as America’s Sweetheart, Pickford played children well into her 30’s, at audience demand. And allow me to gush for just a moment here–my hands fit perfectly inside her imprint at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre.\n\nMy Best Girl (1927) The son of a millionaire owner of a chain of stores decides to work undercover within the company to prove his worth. He falls in love with poor stock girl Pickford and the couple encounters problems as they try to integrate their lives. This was a common theme for Pickford–one that she grew to dislike, along with constantly playing children, but the movie is awesome and brilliantly acted. Probably my favorite silent film.\n\nTess of the Storm Country (1914 & 1922) Yep, you read that right. Pickford played the same role twice. I’ve seen and recommend the later version. This is actually the first silent film I’d ever seen, so I love it in a special way. I turned on the television one night to help me fall asleep and was too engrossed to actually do it. I can’t even begin to explain this complex and ridiculous plot… so we’ll go with poor girl falls in love with rich boy. There’s also murder, an illegitimate child (back in the day this was scandalous), and some crazy, symbolic nature.\n\nLittle Annie Rooney (1925) A girl must make difficult choices when the boy she loves is accused of killing her policeman father. Yeah, I know. By now, you probably feel like you’re on repeat. But I can’t help it. They’re all worth watching, just for Pickford’s performance. And despite the drama, they’re all feel-good pieces. So watch them all. Then you can tell me which you like best!\n\nHonorable Mention: Sparrows (1926) Okay, the plot of this is utterly absurd, but that’s what makes it worth watching. Did I mention there’s a crocodiles-in-the-swamp-that-want-to-eat-escaping-children scene? It’s like an early version of human trafficking… so maybe the plot is not so absurd. Anyway, Pickford plays the eldest child at Mr. Grimes’ farm where kidnapped children are brought and forced to work as slaves. When the police close in to investigate the kidnapping of the daughter of a wealthy citizen, Pickford’s character must protect the younger children from Grimes’ evil plot.\n\nHere’s a bit of trivia for you: Pickford was 34 when she played what is now known as a preteen in Sparrows.\n\nLiar Liar Pants on Fire: I know I promised all feel-goods, but the movie The Wind (1928) Starring Lillian Gish is an interesting one. Letty moves to the Texas desert and finds a constant, terrifying companion in the windstorms. This movie used to be more depressing that it sounds, but the test audiences reacted so badly to it that happier bits were added. So see, I didn’t cheat that much.\n\nThat’s all I have for you for now. Once you finish and inevitably fall in love with those, you can start watching the ones listed in the beginning. Metropolis is worth watching just for the score.\n\nHave you seen The Artist? Any of the original silents? What do you think?"
