        "text": "Actor filmography\n\nThese are the known films of Harold Lloyd (1893–1971), an American actor and filmmaker most famous for his hugely successful and influential silent film comedies.\n\nMost of these films are known to survive in Lloyd's personal archive collection and in various film archives around the world. Some are also available on DVD or Blu-ray. The negatives of many of Lloyd's early short films were lost in a fire at his estate in 1943. The losses include five of the six Willie Work films, 53 of the 67 Lonesome Luke films, and 15 of the 81 one-reel Glasses character films.[1] All of Lloyd's films from Bumping into Broadway (1919) onward exist in complete form in the archives. He carefully preserved his feature films, and they remain in excellent condition. All of the films are listed in order of release date.\n\nIn most of Lloyd's early films, he appeared as an uncredited extra or in a minor supporting role.\n\nNo. Title Release Date Director Archive Status 1.
