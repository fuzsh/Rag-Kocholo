Included are excerpts from \"Safety Last,\" \"The Freshman\" and \"Hot Water.\" These are followed by longer sequences from \"Why Worry?,\" \"Girl Shy,\" \"Professor Beware\" and \"Movie Crazy.\" The movie is capped with Lloyd's routine from \"Feet First,\" where he hangs off the clock of a skyscraper.",
