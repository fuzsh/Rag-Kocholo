Adventures include a ride on a crowded trolley with a live turkey, a wild spin in a new auto with the in-laws in tow, and a sequence in which Hubby accidentally chloroforms his mother-in-law and is convinced that he has killed her. When she begins sleep-walking, he thinks that she has returned to haunt him.\n\nCountry doctor Jack Jackson is called in to treat the Sick-Little-Well-Girl, who has been making Dr. Saulsbourg and his sanitarium very rich, after years of unsuccessful treatment.
