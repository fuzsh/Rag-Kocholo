        "text": "From early 1919 through mid 1921, Harold Lloyd and Noah Young stood together (and moved) before the same camera in approximately 48 silent short comedies. Their teamwork in these one- and two-reelers was usually overshadowed by Bebe Daniels and Snub Pollard’s collaborative contributions, not to mention equal billing with Mr. Lloyd, in at least 40 of these films. But unlike Ms. Daniels and Mr. Pollard, Mr. Young continued an on-camera relationship with Harold Lloyd well beyond these silent one- and two-reelers. Following their last silent short-comedy collaboration, these two teamed in three feature-length silent comedies and four feature-length talkies. Mr. Young’s size (he was slightly taller and much brawnier than Mr. Lloyd) and demeanor (he often played a slow-witted, punch-drunk, and/or menacing type) cast him often as a sidekick, foil, or heavy to Mr. Lloyd’s lead. Although he persevered through four talkies with Mr. Lloyd, Noah Young bowed out of movies in 1935, never quite feeling comfortable in speaking roles owing to a loss of several teeth in his younger rough and tumble days. Harold Lloyd, similarly, bowed out of playing roles in front of the camera in 1938 (returning only once in 1947’s The Sin of Harold Diddlebock). He did continue playing roles behind the camera as producer, director, even advisor, through 1967, offering gag tips one last time for the making of the wedding scene in The Graduate.\n\nHere is a list of their movies together:"
