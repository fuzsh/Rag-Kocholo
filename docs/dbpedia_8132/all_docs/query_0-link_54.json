If this\n\nbook serves to inspire us to greater achievements\n\nand to arouse the spirit of those students who will\n\nsucceed us; if in later years it enables us to recall\n\nmemories which will renew love and devotion to\n\nour Alma Mater, our efforts in trying to preserve\n\nthe \"atmosphere\" of our campus life by compiling\n\nthe activities of this year will be rewarded.\n\nMay it justify the hope of those who have\n\ntoiled in its making\n\nCONTENTS\n\nAdministration\n\nClasses\n\nMilitary\n\nAthletics\n\nFeatures\n\n. Activities\n\nSnaps and Ads\n\nTo Elnora Mertins and Eliza-\n\nbeth Lee, who have merited the\n\nsincere admiration of the facul-\n\nty and students alike; whose\n\nloyalty, integrity, and friendli-\n\nness fully exemplify the spirit\n\nof these institutions; who have\n\nbeen untiring in cooperation,\n\nand efficient in service, we dedi-\n\ncate this our annual for 1940.\n\nMiss Elizabeth Lee\n\nSecretary\n\nDEDICATION\n\nTHE\n\nEditors\n\nSAY. . .\n\nWe've worked together,\n\nWe've worked apart,\n\nThis annual to release.\n\nWe've fussed and fumed.\n\nWe smiled and said,\n\n\"The labor shall not cease.\"\n\nWe've done our job.\n\nNow you do yours\n\nJust praise this to the summit.\n\nAnd if you say this book's no good-\n\nWell, if you don't like it\n\nLump it!\n\n/\n\n^\n\nThe main entrance of our\n\n15-yeai--old building is one of\n\npopularity as well as of beauty.\n\nIE\n\nPresident\n\nTHE IDEALIST\n\n' highest privilege of the teacher is to oyjen to\n\nsome new vista of opportunity and to lead them\n\n\"d to some new height of outlook and greater\n\n:h of vision. The heart of the challenge I would\n\nto you is that you should recall idealism to its\n\nal and lofty purpose in your living and feel in\n\nfilire of 3-otir being its commandng solicitation.\n\nn age when so much emphasis is put upon the\n\n;al and utilitarian values of life, idealism has\n\npearance of remoteness and intangibility and\n\nity. Still you must know that it is precisely this\n\n;nt inaccessibility that gives to idealism its\n\nnge to the spirit of youth. It is like the inac-\n\nility of a rugged mountain peak, which pro-\n\nthe desire to climli. As one laboriously ascends,\n\n;ntly with tired muscles and aching limbs, and\n\nwith the knowledge that we may never Cjuite\n\nits summit, we are still exultant in spirit for we\n\nthe great world at our feet. \\\\'hat seemed a\n\nngless tangle as seen from below gets perspec-\n\nnd meaning when seen from above. Thus the\n\nr view and broader horizon Isecome the reward\n\n; idealist.\n\nd so, fellow-students. I call upon you to make\n\nscent of Life, remembering that whether you\n\nit toward Beauty, or Truth, or Goodness, the\n\nsuccession of steps is taken and the same\n\n/eness is disclosed. For the student, whatever\n\n<ecial interest whether it be Science, or Art, or\n\nature, or Morals he is in every case solicited\n\n1 unsealed height.\n\nu should remember that there are moral condi-\n\nof scholarly achievement. A scholar must be not\n\ncreative, but sincere. An undefiled character\n\nyou not only a finer morality, hut a finer in-\n\nYour eyes are clear because your heart is pure,\n\nshall it come to be with you as it is written in the\n\nof Books \"Tlie Pure in heart shall see God.\"\n\ntRIC W. HARDY, President.\n\nAdministrative Heads\n\nat Work\n\nTHE DEAN ^ jj^\n\nI have been asked to write a brief message to you;\n\nbut, because there are so many good things in life I want\n\neach of you to have, I find it difficult to formulate a\n\nmessage that will convey all m\\- desires for you. In short,\n\nI shall simply wish for each of you happiness and success\n\nin your lives as you leave school.\n\nTo achieve happiness and success, you must remem-\n\nber that these attributes are not to be measured alone by\n\nthe mere acquisition of material wealth and possessions.\n\nThe man who places such homely, sterling virtues as\n\ncharacter, honesty, perseverance, industry and thrift,\n\nand last, but not least, reverence to God, foremost in his\n\nlife will be richly rewarded. The world now has a great\n\nand crying need for men and women of character, devoted\n\nto the service of their country and of their fellow men.\n\nThe hope and salvation of our country lie in the hands of\n\nour youth ; it is your privilege to lead onward and upward.\n\nIt is my hope that you may happily combine the\n\nidealistic and the materialistic aspects of life, and achieve\n\nthat measure of success and happiness that is your due.\n\nA.

As the spokesman of\n\nthe faculties, I respectfully dedicate the following\n\nsimple lines to Miss Elenora Mertins and Miss\n\nElizabeth Lee.\n\nJust you, with each day's new dawning,\n\nJust you, with each morning's good cheer.\n\nJust you, who lighten our burdens,\n\nJust you, SO' happy and near.\n\nJust you, when our hearts grow heavy.\n\nJust you, when we're lonely or sad.\n\nJust you, when all others have failed us.\n\nJust you, when the world's gone mad.\n\nJust you, how patient and kindly.\n\nJust you, the fairest and best.\n\nJust you, true friends, and so loyal,\n\nJust you, with your life and your zest.\n\nJust you, how tenderly we cherish.\n\nSo lovely, so brave, and so true\n\nWe pour out our daily libations.\n\nAnd thank God for the twO' just you.\n\nE.

From this time forth I shall look them square in the eyes instead of bashfully gazing at\n\ntheir feet. Yessir, I'll mow 'em down with stares !\n\nI, Eric West Hardy, do resolve not to invite the Board of Education to inspect the institution on\n\nWashington's Birthday (and incidentally, give them a good dinner in the lunch room) with the sole\n\nintention of extracting an appropriation from them. ,\n\nI, Joseph R. Moseley, do hereby resolve, hereafter and forevermore, never to leave the subject of\n\nmathematics while conducting my classes. From this time forth, I will restrain, cease, and absolutely\n\nquit remarking about and discussing the European situation, my farming problems, domestic luisad-\n\nventures, and other peculiar subjects.\n\nI, Henry Osgood Read, do resolve to remain in m\\' home-room after nine o'clock, and to leave the\n\nmanagement of inane conduct in the corridors to other members of the faculty, in order that one of\n\nthese might acquire my reputation.\n\nI, George Ridgway, do resolve not to waste any more time teaching school, but rather to spend\n\nthat tiiue resting, sleeping, and eating.\n\nI, Chester Arthur Scruggs, do resolve that hereafter I shall cease philosophizing, restrain my\n\nimagination from having such free range, dispense with advancing my impractical theories, and in short,\n\ntry not to mesmerize my students. Rather I shall spend more time on the Essentials of Chemistry.\n\nI, Chester M. Sutton, do' resolve to require more work of my English classes. I am tired of students\n\nand faculty memliers' accusing me of ofifering \"crip courses.\"\n\nI, LeConte Talley, do resolve to cease doling out indefinite and impractical theories to poor, de-\n\nfenseless Physics students.\n\nA Stiidenf s Impression\n\nof the Faculty\n\nA's the teacher who gave us this book\n\nB's the librarian with the silencing look\n\nC's the leader of our promising band\n\nD teaches the language of a far away land\n\nE's too handsome to really be true\n\nF tells the camera club just what to do\n\nG and his glee club are really a riot\n\nH thinks the hall should be kept very quiet\n\nI for idiots (and there are quite a lot)\n\nJ's a joke by George Milton Scott\n\nK's \"Unkle Bill\" who knows all the tricks\n\nL is the teacher who's known as \"Big Six\"\n\nM is our dean and every student's friend\n\nN is the nothing we've learned in the end\n\nO's the one with the MUSKETEER\n\nP's our politics worse every year\n\nO's the \"big question\" on a C.G.C. test\n\nR's the \"Baron\" and one of the best\n\nS knows his chemistry or so it is said\n\nT is the man with the hair that's so red\n\nU for us who make up each class\n\nV is the victory when all of us pass\n\nW's for \"Sergeant\" who makes the boys drill\n\nX used to be unknown ; I guess it is still\n\nY is for no other person than you\n\nZ's for the zero which means that you're through.\n\nConnie seems very much\n\ninterested in the Baron.\n\nSnaps\n\nCould this diHgent work have\n\nbeen real?\n\nCol.

V_><. l\\.\n\nThe J.C.A. Sophomores had no troulile in\n\nthe selection of their officers for this year's\n\ngroup of students. Alfred Battey, presi-\n\ndent, has steadily risen in popularity\n\namong the students. Elle Carswell is our\n\nown little ray of sunshine, cheering us up\n\nwith a congenial word a day. Margaret\n\nSheftall is typical of our vim, vigor, and\n\nvitality ; and she is very much responsible\n\nfor the success of our annual. Tommy\n\nHouck is a most efficient treasurer. Betty\n\nAndrews and Jack Hains are our popular\n\nstudent council representatives. Inciden-\n\ntally, Betty was voted the most popular\n\nJ. C. A. girl and Jack, the best all-round\n\nJ. C.

That's what Milton would do.\n\nBut, gosh! I'm no Milton and neither are you.\n\nSo Sleep, gentle Sleep, the \\ictory is yours.\n\nYou ma}- hold here full swa}- \\^-hile my fantasy soars.\n\nBut say! What's this place? I've not been here before;\n\nAnd what's on this sign that is hung on the door?\n\nJ.C.A.'S GRADUATES OF '40 WILL DINE\n\nAT A BIG CLASS REUNION THIS EVENING\n\nAT NINE.\n\nSo, in I walked and down I sat.\n\nAnd listened to news of this and that.\n\nThe more I listened, the more I learned,\n\nAnd here's the gist of what I discerned.\n\nAlfred Battey, handsome and tall.\n\nWas selling tickets to the President's Ball.\n\nIn some big city he was chief M. D.,\n\nAnd his choice expression was, \"Now let me see.\"\n\nEddie Pierce so they say.\n\nWent exploring in old S. A.\n\nShe found some animals with 3-ellow fur,\n\nAnd science still wonders what they were.\n\nMargaret Sheftall, tall and slim,\n\nWas modeling clothes for the perfect femme,\n\nUntil one day she tripped on her gown\n\nWhen she saw a certain guy from her \"ole home town\".\n\nCason Bruker, fiddle in hand,\n\nWas the proud conductor of a concert band.\n\nHe had promised to play his new composition\n\nTo write a hundred was his ambition.\n\nBetty Andrews, chic and fair.\n\nWas wearing jewels in her hair.\n\nShe introduced the \"Riders' Club Plan\"\n\nAnd smiled as only Betty can.\n\nVirginia Anderson, keen and smart,\n\nWas a star detective right to the heart.\n\nShe had cracked some tough cases not long before.\n\nAnd now she's guarding the Hardy's front door.\n\nJack Hains, the \"colonel\", with a dame on his arm.\n\nWas bemoaning the loss of his \"model\" Farm.\n\nHe went on a cruise and mortgaged his land\n\nHe lost the farm, but the trip was grand.\n\nElisabeth Bryans, in a new red dress.\n\nHad a new degree M.R.S.\n\nShe now could give up that burden she'd borne,\n\n^^'riting her column \"Advice to the Lovelorn\".\n\nSara Jane Chapman, just back from \"Paree\",\n\nWhere she told all the Frenchmen what fashions\n\nwould be.\n\nCame to the banquet and startled the class\n\nIn her gown trimmed with feathers and woven of glass.\n\nCarl Simon, of Wall Stjrtet and financial fame,\n\nLost all his \"dough\" in a poker game.\n\nNcAv he's back in Augusta and resolved to stay.\n\nHe'll design new lamp-posts for Walton Way.\n\nCeleste Bignon, once a good nurse.\n\nHad a patient with measles, or something far worse.\n\nWhen they asked her quite simply, \"And did the\n\nman die?\"\n\nShe said. \"'No, my goodness I I married the guy.\"\n\nConstance Elliott, smart and keen,\n\nDesigns for a leading magazine.\n\nShe looks just like a fashion plate.\n\nTall, beautiful, and so sedate.\n\nIn town while on tour was \"Romeo Bo\"\n\nWho'd given up medicine to be a golf pro.\n\nHis 9:30 practice helped him achieve fame,\n\nNow even nut sundaes are bearing his name.\n\nTeeny Tucker has changed her name\n\nAnd thO'Ugh she hasn't achieved such fame,\n\nStill she's a happy and homeloving wife.\n\nMy, how she's changed since her college life.\n\nGeorgia Paquette and Maxine Farr\n\nAre now in a play in which they star.\n\nThey love New York and there they'll stay,\n\n'Cause their names shine brightly on Old Broadway.\n\nTommy Houck, long and lanky.\n\nWas selling equipment to every Yankee.\n\nHis salesman's ability didn't go so far\n\nNow he's writing a poem, \"On A Star\".\n\nA business executive was Mary E. Paulk,\n\nHer wonderful efTiciency was all the talk.\n\nThey made her chairman of all the committees,\n\nAnd her name was well known in all the big cities.\n\nA great engineer was Francis Jenny.\n\nAlthough his work cost a \"pretty penny,\"\n\nHe was the most popular contractor in town.\n\nAnd met all his problems with that dignified frown.\n\nMartha Stelling has a band\n\nThe best \"All-Girl\" one in the land.\n\nDorothy Timm sings songs so blue.\n\nWe knew they'd never separate these twO'.\n\nFile Carswell, tiny and gay\n\nStill laughing and talking as yesterday,\n\nIs in a large city hospital far away\n\nAnd an efficient nurse she's destined to stay.\n\nJulia Hill, now teaching French,\n\nSays teaching this language is really a cinch.\n\nBut since her life now is all work and no play,\n\nShe's slowly but surely turning quite gray.\n\nTHE\n\nOFFICERS\n\nPresident Walter Reiser\n\nVice-President . . . Jinimie Cooper\n\nSecretary .... Dorothy Douglas\n\nTreasurer Harry Pund\n\nStudent Council . . . Louis B-ittey\n\nStudent Council . . . Pat Calhoun\n\nOur F'reshman officers are a carefree, intelligent group of students who believe that this year's\n\nFreshmen are tops. When we notice who represents this class, we find it easy to believe that it would\n\nbe hard to' beat. Walter \"Sonny\" Reiser is one of the most popular, and one of the most intellectual,\n\nboys in the school. His scholastic record is something for his classmates to aim at. Jimmie Cooper\n\nfinds time to play some swell basketball and take part in school activities. The one and only girl in the\n\ngroup is Dottie Douglas, who is a good representative of all Junior College girls. Dottie was unanimously\n\nvoted the most popular Freshman girl. Harry Pund is \"one of the boys\" in every sense of the phrase.\n\nHe thinks the clubs in the school are very important fur every bov Pat Calhoun and Louis Battey\n\nmake able Student Council members. Both of these boys are popular, intelligent, and active J.C.A.\n\nFreshmen. Next year's leaders will have to be superlative to pass these officers in any phase of Junior\n\nCiillege activitv.\n\nWalter Reiser Louis Battey Pat Calhoun Jinimie Cooper Dot Douglas\n\nHarrv Pund\n\nJ.C.A.

Its founder\n\nand original planner was the late Dr. George P. Butler, who became its first president. Unlike many\n\neducational institutions, it was n<i spurious grt)wth, but it came into e.xistence in response to a genuine\n\ncommunity need, and from the outset has had the enthusiastic support of the community which it\n\nserves. These considerations are its primary elements of strength and offer the jn-incipal assurance of\n\nits outstanding growth and perpetuity.\n\nThe Junior College of Augusta was one of the fist public junior colleges founded in this section of\n\nthe South. ]\\Iany others ha\\e come into existence in this section since the date of its founding, but this\n\ninstitution has held a unique place of leadershi]i among them from the very beginning. This has been\n\ndue largely to the wisdom of its founders in setting up curricula which were in every sense standard\n\nanfl the equixalent of the first two years in the best four-\\ear standard colleges and universities. In\n\naddition to this, its instructional staff has always been composed of men who represent the best\n\nscholarship of man\\' of the best .American universit'es, and who have been carefully selected because\n\nof their rich experience and eminent success as teachers.\n\nAlmost immediately after the Junior College began to function, it was admitted to membership in\n\nthe Southern .Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, and the American Association of Junior\n\nColleges. It is also a member of the Georgia Association of Colleges (senior) and the Association of\n\nGeorgia Junior Colleges. The strength of its exam[)le and the leadership of its Faculty have been\n\nstrongly felt in the counsels of these associations.\n\nAs important as these things are in the life and standing of an educational institution, the final\n\nmeasure of its greatness must be found in its jiroduct. That its pri)duct is good is e\\'idenccd by the eag-\n\nerness of the senior colleges and universities to get these jiroducts. The ])remiums th.ey are willing to\n\npay are shown bv the thousands of dollars worth of schoIarshi])s that ha\\e been made available to the\n\ngraduates of the Junior College of .\\ugusta. By actual count these graduates have gone into more than\n\none hundred dififerent .\\merican Colleges and Universities. The triennial reports on their success, which\n\nhave to he made to the Southern Association of Colleges, show that they have all been able to do the\n\nwork of the higher institutions not only with outstanding success, but in many cases with great dis-\n\ntinction. This holds true not only of those going to the Liberal Arts Colleges, but also of those who\n\nhave gone into the schools of Law, Medicine and Engineering.\n\nThe enrollment of the Junior College has been steadily increasing. __The total for the present\n\nsession, 1939-40, is 270 students, about equally divided between young men and young women. In its\n\nshort life, the Junior College of Augusta has graduated approximately 700 students, approximately\n\n60% of whom have gone on to higher institutions. The total saving to the community has been in round\n\nnumbers around $2,000,000.00. There has been no enterprise of any kind which has yielded such a\n\ndividend in dollars and cents saved, to say nothing of the enrichment of the young life of the community\n\nthrough their contacts with men of fine ideals and high scholarship.\n\nThe Junior College of Augusta has the physical equipment with which to do high-grade work.\n\nNo college in the state has better laboratories. One of the fastest growing features of the college is its\n\nsplendid Library, hc>using now over eight thousand carefulh- chosen \\olumes and hundreds of unbound\n\npublications. It is receiving net accessions of approximately 1500 volumes each year. The greatest im-\n\nmediate need of the Junior College is a special building to take care of its rapidly growing library. Here is\n\nthe opportunity for some wealthy citizen to build for himself a monument that will outlast the stone\n\nand steel that may go into it.\n\nMore important than physical equipment is the philosophy of education to which officers and\n\nteachers ::ubscrihe. The Faculty agrees unanimously that in the process of true education there is no\n\nplace for sham or superficiality. They subscribe to the proposition that the world needs only men and\n\nwomen of cultivated brains, but above all else of stable character. They believe that the Christian ideal\n\nis the finest thing in the world ; that there can never be true culture without Christian character. In\n\nthe midst of a world of cynicism and change, they believe that there are moral values which are eternal\n\nand unchanging.\n\nFinally, it should be said that there is no place in the class-rooms or on the campus for the pro-\n\npagandist of any creed or doctrine subversive to the spirit of America. The Junior College of Augusta\n\nwill maintain at whatever cost the traditions of patriotism and unspoiled Americanism that Ijelong\n\nhistorically to the Community that it will continue to serve.\n\nHenry Caver\n\n-k\n\nSENIORS\n\nOfficers\n\nPresident Henr\\' Ca\\er\n\nVice-President Bul'jlier Cole\n\nSecretary Ralph Chaney\n\nTreasurer Rudolph Chaney\n\nStudent Council Bernard Mitchum\n\nStudent Council Louis Ross\n\nThe Senior Class officers this year\n\ncombine brawn with brains to make\n\noutstanding- officers. All of the boys\n\nhave impressive athletic and scholas-\n\ntic records. Our president, \"Hank\"\n\nCaver, illustrates what we mean by\n\nbrawn. He started out as a freshman\n\nplaying' real football. Since then, he\n\nhas regularly been a member of the\n\nfootball and track teams, each year.\n\nHis presidency climaxes his record\n\nof popularity among his classmates.\n\nRubber Cole shouldn't be over-\n\nlooked when anyone talks of \"he-\n\nmen\", either. He has been a triple-\n\nthreat ever since he joined the\n\nRichmond football team. Bubber was\n\nrecently voted the most popular\n\nSenior by the A. R. C. student body.\n\nRalph and Rudolph Chaney have\n\nrecords that should make anyone\n\nenvious. Both are honor students,\n\nvcrj' active in student activities, and\n\nboth are excellent swimmers. A\n\ncombination within a combination.\n\nBernard Mitchum is an important\n\nmember of the Academy Rifle Team\n\nand an even more important mem-\n\nber of our football team.\n\nRubber Cole\n\nRalph Chaney\n\nRiultjlpli Chaney\n\nLouis Ross is one of the \"big\"\n\nmen in the Academy. No one knows\n\ntliat better than the beaten football\n\nplayers who have had the misfortune\n\nto tangle with him. Louis won the\n\nhonor of being named on the All\n\nG.l.A.A. football team.\n\nWith such a student government,\n\nthe Senior Class can not fail to\n\nprogress.\n\nBernard Mitclui\n\nLouis Ross\n\n^\n\nADAMS, AL G.\n\nALLERTON, S.

Somewhere among the pages of that ponderous \\olume was a Senior Class Prophecy\n\nwhich was written by a certain J.C.A. Freshman whom we shall call Richard Roe. On the faculty of\n\nthe school at that time was E. M. Allen, professor of French and faculty adviser for the \"1940 Rainbow\".\n\nWhen the \"Rainbow\" was printed and Prof. Allen saw the Senior Class Prophecy, he uttered a blood-\n\ncurdling yell and tore out after poor Roe with bloodv murder in his eve.\n\nThis chase lasted for twenty long years over land and sea. Finally, just this morning, they happened\n\nto come back to Augusta; and from the signs on Broad Street, it was evident that everything which\n\npoor Richard had prophesied had been realized. Accordingly, Prof. Allen decided to give up the chase,\n\nand he retired to the Mulherin Home for Weary Professors, Steve and Pat, proprietors. Thus freed\n\nfrom his great danger, Richard strolled up and down Rroad Street greeting his friends of the class\n\nof 1940.\n\nThe first person he encountered was Ralph Chaney of the law firm of Chance, Chance, Chaney, and\n\nChaney. Ralph said that their last client had been Leonard Powell in his suit against Major W. A.\n\nElliott. Powell collected $100,000 because his arches had fallen from so much extra drill back at the\n\nAcademy. Further down the street was a sign which read thus : \"Rice and Rice, Piano Tuners. Let\n\nPat and Leo Put You Back on the Right Key.\" In the window of the Rices' store was a poster announc-\n\ning the coming championship l:)oxing match between \"Slugger\" Xorman and \"Bloodv Butch\" Watkins.\n\nThe bout will be staged in Cliff Ward's new giant arena, and the third man in the ring will be that dean\n\nof referees. Willie Wallace.\n\nOn the directory of the old S.F.C. Building (now called \"Cooper's Castle\", since Billy Cooper and\n\nhis partner. Bo Farris, added twenty more stories to it) the following doctors were listed : Baliy\n\nS]3ecialists S. Pomerance, W. H. Cato, and E. S. Wolfe; Dog Doctors R. H. Patrick. R. L. Comley,\n\nJ. Kearns, and Francis Dales. Among the many law firms listed was the firm of Stringer, Stringer,\n\nStringer, and Turbyfill. The soda fount in the lobbv was owned by Leon D. Rountree. and the chief\n\nsoda-jerker was Nic Gavalas. As Richard passed through the building, Nic waved a greeting to him.\n\nAt the back of the building was Aledlin's Barber Shop. Seated in one of the chairs was Guy Lewis, a\n\nlocal bricklayer. Other barbers in the shop liesides Medlin were Carl Wilson, Lance Card, Charles Al-\n\nlen, and Jack Black.\n\nRichard turuiid around and came out of the building, and just as he got outside he happened to\n\nlook up and see an airplane flying over with a sign announcing the coming of Robert Wilkinson and\n\nhis famous orchestra to Bill Brotherton's new Supper Club on the Washington Road. Wilkinson's musi-\n\ncians are Hugh Elrod and Walton Hamilton, trumpets; Walter Jones and Marshall Brandenburg, clari-\n\nnets; George McLendon, bazooka ; Luke Krewson, washboard ; Jack Hoops, jug; Herbert Collier, ocarina ;\n\nDavid Ste\\-ens, drums ; and Clyde Sexton, vocalist. Also featured with the band are Brennan Purkall\n\nand Spann Greene, comedians.\n\nGlancing down again, Richard saw a row of pawn shops just below Sears-Roebuck, which, by the\n\nway, is under the capable management of George Wright and Jimmy Lang. These pawn shops were all\n\nunder the supervision of Stanley Goldstein, ^Morris Goldstein, Ben Pojikin, and Lloyd Horton. They sold\n\neverything from straight pins to Xevin's all-steel airplanes. Just below these shops was the nld Miller\n\nTheatre, now the Hammack Opera House, which was closed for repairs.\n\n.\\fter leaving the Opera House, Richard was unable to find any more of his old friends; so he went\n\nover to the editorial offices of the Augusta Chronicle to inquire about them. The first person he met\n\nin the office was Marcus Phillips, reporter for the paper. When Richard inquired about the rest of the\n\nclass of 1940, Marcus replied, \"Well, they've all gone dift'erent ways. Of course, you've heard about\n\nHank Caver? He's a cowboy in the movies. Idis Cater is also in the movies; he's a leading man. Paul\n\nAmos and Charlie .AUerton are radio announcer.- \"^^ CBS.
