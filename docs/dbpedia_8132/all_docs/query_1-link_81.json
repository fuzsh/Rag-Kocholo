        "text": "Boxing Day\n\nCitizen Kane\n\n(Orson Welles, 1943) 10.30am, BBC2\n\nDirected, co-written by, and starring the brash 25-year-old debutant Welles, Kane sets about unravelling, through a series of brilliantly-interwoven flashbacks, the significance of a newspaper tycoon's (closely based on William Randolph Hearst) deathbed utterance: \"Rosebud\".\n\nMary Poppins\n\n(Robert Stevenson, 1964) 10.50am, ITV1\n\nIt's always a jolly seasonal holiday with Mary: Julie Andrews flies in to No 17 Cherry Tree Lane to put the Banks family right. David Tomlinson's fuddy-daddy steals the show, while Dick Van Dyke's gorblimey- guv chimney sweep is unintentionally hilarious. It really is supercali... bloody good.\n\nThe Hunchback Of Notre Dame\n\n(Gary Trousdale, 1996) 2.15pm, BBC1\n\nThis is the Disney version of Victor Hugo's classic tale of unrequited love. But although the misshapen bell-keeper Quasimodo and his Gypsy girl Esmeralda are cartoon characters, this is a surprisingly complex, adult film - it tackles social ills, alienation, and even alludes (modestly, of course) to the sexual tension between the pair.\n\nDeath On The Nile\n\n(John Guillermin, 1978) 3.40pm, ITV1\n\nAnother Agatha Christie mystery, acted out by a stellar cast. Peter Ustinov makes an impressive Hercule Poirot, faced with a luxury cruise-liner full of suspects after the killing of spoilt heiress Lois Chiles. Among those on board are Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Maggie Smith and Mia Farrow.\n\nThe Wizard Of Oz\n\n(Vincent Fleming, 1939) 4.25pm, Five\n\n\"East or West, home is best\" - sentimental homespun philosophy, but the MGM musical classic carries it off ecstatically. Sixteen-year-old Judy Garland joined cinema's immortals as displaced Kansas gal Dorothy, searching for the Wizard and a way out of Oz: which, underneath all the cheery smiles, is a terrifying place.\n\nThe Bridge On The River Kwai\n\n(David Lean, 1957) 6.05pm, C4\n\nThe bridge sags a bit under the weight of its seven Oscars, but Alec Guinness deserved his best actor award in this classic war film. His Colonel Nicholson, commander of the British PoWs in a camp in Burma, is a moving study of courage and muddled pride.\n\nThe Naked Spur\n\n(Anthony Mann, 1953) 6.30pm, BBC2\n\nOne of the fine westerns Mann made with James Stewart, in which the physical action is matched by the hero's inner struggle. Stewart plays a bounty hunter bringing Robert Ryan's sneering villain to justice.\n\nThe Man Who Sued God\n\n(Mark Joffe, 2001) 9pm, Five\n\nBilly Connolly is in his element as Steve Myers, a Sydney lawyer who quit in disgust to become a simple fisherman. But when his boat is destroyed by a bolt of lightning and the insurers refuse to pay out on an \"act of God\" he sues Him, in the form of His earthly representatives in the Church.\n\nBlazing Saddles\n\n(Mel Brooks, 1974) 11pm, BBC2\n\nBrooks's spoof western gallops along with coarse good humour. Cleavon Little is the black sheriff who teams up with Gene Wilder's Waco Kid - an alcoholic gunslinger so fast on the draw you don't see his hands move - to save Rock Ridge from evil speculator Harvey Korman.\n\nYentl\n\n(Barbra Streisand, 1983) 1.05am, ITV1\n\nA pleasant little Isaac Bashevis Singer story gets the works from Streisand, who directed, produced and co-wrote with Jack Rosenthal. She also stars, as a young turn-ofthe- century Polish woman who pretends to be a boy in order to study the Talmud. An all-singing, all-dancing plod.\n\nMonday December 27\n\nThe Tigger Movie\n\n(Jun Falkenstein, 2000) 11.40am, BBC1\n\nApart from the simple pleasure of seeing Disney's animated versions of AA Milne's charming drawings, there's not a whole lot going on here: Pooh and pals have to rally round when Tigger starts searching for his long-lost family.\n\nThe Jungle Book\n\n(Stephen Sommers, 1994) 2.25pm, BBC1\n\nThe Bare Necessities and the rest of the songs from the Disney animated classic are deemed unnecessary in this live-action remake that's closer in spirit to the Kipling original. Jason Scott Lee is orphan Mowgli, raised by jungle animals, Lena Headey the young woman smitten by his wild ways.\n\nThe Charge Of The Light Brigade\n\n(Michael Curtiz, 1936) 2.40pm, BBC2\n\nThe one in which, as cavalryman David Niven recalled, Hungarian director Curtiz famously yelled \"Bring on the empty horses!\". The climactic ride into the Valley of Death is so spectacular and stirring you want to saddle up and go with them. Dashing Errol Flynn leads the glorious, suicidal attack on the Russian guns.\n\nMurder On The Orient Express\n\n(Sidney Lumet, 1974) 3.35pm, ITV1\n\nAn Agatha Christie murder mystery as old-fashioned as a game of Cluedo: who killed industrialist Richard Widmark, on the train, with the knife? Albert Finney, as detective Hercule Poirot, must solve the case before the Orient Express hits Paris in a lustrous and fascinating thriller.\n\nMatilda\n\n(Danny DeVito, 1996) 4.10pm, BBC1\n\nA delicious adaptation of Roald Dahl's vicious novel about 'orrible adults, and how to punish them. Matilda (Mara Wilson) is a feisty freedom fighter with magical powers, leading oppressed schoolchildren against the sadistic Miss Trunchbull (Pam Ferris).\n\nMosquito Squadron\n\n(Boris Sagal, 1969) 6pm, BBC2\n\nThe highly unlikely plot has David McCallum's bomber squadron leader attacking German rocket bases and flying into an affair with the wife (Suzanne Neve) of his best pal (David Buck), who's missing in action - until he turns up as a captive at the chateau that is McCallum's next target.\n\nLara Croft: Tomb Raider\n\n(Simon West, 2001) 8.30pm, BBC1\n\nThe videogame heroine is brought to dazzlingly daft but lovable life in this all-action adventure. Angelina Jolie throws herself into the role with real gusto, despite the dumbfounding (or plain dumb) plot which has her tearing around fighting all manner of monsters while trying to stop the dreaded Illuminati grabbing the Clock Of Ages.\n\nThe Mother\n\n(Roger Michell, 2003) 9pm, BBC2\n\nRemember that Anne Reid, out of TV's Dinnerladies? Well, you'll never guess what! She's playing a widowed pensioner who has a passionate affair with a builder half her age (Daniel Craig)... To be fair, director Michell and scriptwriter Hanif Kureishi mainly avoid sensation and bring a pained poignancy to the tale of a woman rediscovering her inner spark after a lifeless marriage: a pity it dissolves into hysterics at the end.\n\nStill Crazy\n\n(Brian Gibson, 1998) 11.30pm, BBC1\n\nThis rock comedy in the great tradition of This Is Spinal Trap has the members of 1970s band Strange Fruit ripe for a return to the stage in the 1990s. There's a spot-on screenplay from Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, and the boys in the band - Bill Nighy, Stephen Rea, Timothy Spall, Jimmy Nail, plus roadie Billy Connolly - make great old rockers.\n\nGreat Expectations\n\n(Alfonso Cuaron, 1997) 12.40am, C4\n\nThe shadow of David Lean's masterly adaptation looms over Dickens's novel but the Mexican director Cuaron has risen to the challenge with this assured remake. He updates the action to 1970s Florida, then 1980s New York, breathing a new urgency into the classic tale, and the cast is terrific: Ethan Hawke as Finn, aka Pip; Robert De Niro the escaped convict; Anne Bancroft as the mad auntie and Gwyneth Paltrow an icy Estella. It does for Dickens what Baz Luhrmann's Romeo And Juliet did for Shakespeare.\n\nTuesday December 28\n\nApollo 13\n\n(Ron Howard, 1993) 12.55pm, ITV1\n\nHouston, we have a problem... an understatement for the crew of Apollo 13 in 1970, when somewhere near the moon it lost power, and the oxygen supply began leaking into the void. We know astronauts Lovell, Haise and Swigert got back to earth: but there's still sweaty-palmed tension in how they did it. Incredibly, it seemed to come down to technicians back at Nasa doing a Blue Peter job with a table load of plastic odds-and-ends. With Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon.\n\nBabe: Pig In The City\n\n(George Miller, 1998) 1.40pm, BBC1\n\nIn this Hollywood-influenced sequel to the enchanting Australian comedy, even the bright-eyed and curly-tailed talking piglet loses some of his charm. James Cromwell's admirable Farmer Hoggett is sidelined early on, leaving Babe to move away from the farmyard to the big city, where a frenetic bout of by-the-numbers big chase thrills ensues. But although it has lost some of its idiosyncratic appeal, it's still great fun for the kids.\n\nThe Return Of The Pink Panther\n\n(Blake Edwards, 1974) 2pm, C4\n\nThat restless Pink Panther diamond has gone missing again, and much as long-suffering chief detective Herbert Lom hates it, the only sleuth who can solve the mystery is the legendary Clouseau. Peter Sellers, in his third appearance as the bungling inspector, is as fallabout funny as ever.\n\nSmall Soldiers\n\n(Joe Dante, 1998) 3.10pm, BBC1\n\nWith the likes of Piranha and Gremlins behind him, Joe Dante is no stranger to the world of aggressive little critters, and here he has an army of computerised Action Men marching into battle. Only smart young kid Gregory Smith and his chum Kirsten Dunst can save the amiable Gorgonites from this malevolent taskforce in a well-crafted tribute to the tricksiness of CGI technology.\n\nI Capture The Castle\n\n(Tim Fywell, 2003) 6.10pm, BBC2\n\nAn enchanting tale of genteel poverty, as recorded by 17-year-old diarist Cassandra Mortmain (Romola Garai). Her family - blocked novelist Dad, Bill Nighy, flighty stepmother Tara Fitzgerald and siblings - inhabit a Cold Comfort Castle on the 1930s Isle of Man: their colourful, bohemian lives are suddenly stirred up by the arrival of two young American brothers (Henry Thomas, Marc Blucas).\n\nHome Alone 2: Lost In New York\n\n(Chris Columbus, 1992) 6.45pm, C4\n\nYou'd think, after the events of the first Home Alone, that young Macaulay Culkin's parents would take better care of him, but no, here they go again, flying off to Bermuda and inadvertently leaving him in New York. What are they like? An enjoyable but routine sequel, with Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.\n\nTopsy-Turvy\n\n(Mike Leigh, 1999) 10pm, BBC2\n\nIt seemed a topsy-turvy world when Mike Leigh went all period-drama in this account of odd-couple operetta stars Gilbert and Sullivan.\n\nBut underneath the make-up is a cast of characters with all the familiar vulnerabilities. Among the wonderful ensemble are Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner as G&S; plus Timothy Spall, Ron Cook and Alison Steadman.\n\nFor A Few Dollars More\n\n(Sergio Leone, 1964) 11.15pm, ITV1\n\nLeone's superior sequel to the groundbreaking A Fistful Of Dollars teams Clint Eastwood's vagabond gunslinger, the Man With No Name, with Lee Van Cleef's dapper Colonel Mortimer. The bounty-hunters form an uneasy alliance in their search for the psychopathic Indio (Gian Mario Volonté, the villain of the earlier film).\n\nWednesday December 29\n\nMouse Hunt\n\n(Gore Verbinski, 1997) 11.25am, BBC1\n\nNathan Lane and Lee Evans are dimwit, Laurel-and-Hardy-like brothers who inherit dad's string factory and a crumbly mansion. There's a string attached, too, in the form of a mouse with a territorial sense that would put a pitbull to shame.\n\nOdd Man Out\n\n(Carol Reed, 1946) 12.15pm, BBC2\n\nJames Mason plays one of Carol Reed's displaced heroes, the doomed IRA gun-runner Johnny McQueen. Badly wounded in a stick-up gone wrong, he searches out true love Kathleen Ryan and his only friend, Robert Beatty, as the police net inexorably draws in.\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\n(George Lucas, 1977) 12.50pm, ITV1\n\nWhen it was released a long, long time ago we knew this simply as Star Wars; now we know the New Hope referred to the director's dream of a world enslaved by his merchandising empire. Still, it was a terrific adventure, pitting Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and space maverick Han Solo (a little-known Harrison Ford) against Darth Vader and the Empire.\n\nHoney, I Blew Up The Kid\n\n(Randal Kleiser, 1992) 1.20pm, BBC1\n\nOr maybe, The Attack Of The 50ft Boy: in this sequel to Honey I Shrunk The Kids, batty scientist Rick Moranis is back, this time accidentally turning his son into a King Kong-alike. A similar goofy 1950s sci-fi feel to the action.\n\nThe Sound Of Music\n\n(Robert Wise, 1965) 2.45pm, BBC1\n\nHigh-soaring screen version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, filmed very effectively on location around the Alps and in pretty Salzburg. In this much-loved, true-life story, singing nun Maria (Julie Andrews) is attached first to the seven Von Trapp children, then the Von himself (Christopher Plummer), before all flee the Nazis in eve-of-war Austria.\n\nScott Of The Antarctic\n\n(Charles Frend, 1948) 6.15pm, BBC2\n\nFrend's stirring account of that great British iceman, Captain Scott, and the ill-fated British expedition beaten to the South Pole by Amundsen in 1911 took four years to complete, with lots of location work in frozen Norway and Switzerland.\n\nTraining Day\n\n(Antoine Fuqua, 2001) 10.25pm, BBC1\n\nEthan Hawke's rookie cop has a hellish first 24 hours in an elite LA narcotics squad: not so much because of the traditional gallery of drug-runners, gangsters, muggers and rapists he encounters, but because of the bad cop supervising him: Denzel Washington.\n\nGet Carter\n\n(Mike Hodges, 1971) 10.35pm, Five\n\nThe guv'nor of British gangster films, with Michael Caine's impassive, amoral Jack Carter now raised to the status of screen icon. He's a very 'eavy London 'ood who goes up to Newcastle to sort out his brother's killers: \"You're a big man, but you're aht of condition...\"\n\nThe Good, The Bad And The Ugly\n\n(Sergio Leone, 1966) 11pm, ITV1\n\nLeone had more money to play with after the success of the two Dollars movies, so this third adventure of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name is on a much larger scale: it takes in a full-scale civil war battle. The picaresque plot has Clint, the Good, vying with the Bad killer (Lee Van Cleef ) and the Ugly bandit (Eli Wallach), for treasure buried in a vast cemetery.\n\nDesperado\n\n(Robert Rodriguez, 1995) 11.05pm, C4\n\nBig-budget reworking of Rodriguez's El Mariachi that blows big bucks on a storm of pyrotechnic action. Antonio Banderas is the cool Clint-esque stranger gunning down hordes of seedy-looking hoods, aided by Salma Hayek's deadly, dark-eyed beauty.\n\nThe Likely Lads\n\n(Michael Tuchner, 1976) 12.20am, BBC1\n\nNot the best of translations from the small screen to the big: the TV series writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais try gamely to expand horizons on a tour of the north-east coast, but at heart its appeal was always about small-scale, nostalgia-drenched working-and- shirking lives.\n\nThursday December 30\n\nThe Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\n\n(Tony Richardson, 1962) 12.15pm, BBC2\n\nAnother sullen adaptation of an Alan Sillitoe novel: like Saturday Night And Sunday Morning the message is \"Don't let the bastards grind you down\". Tom Courtenay is just right as the borstal boy persuaded by snooty governor Michael Redgrave to run in a cross-country race against the local public school, recalling his dismal past along the way.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\n(Irvin Kershner, 1980) 12.50pm, ITV1\n\nThe grown-up, and best, episode of George Lucas's epic enterprise. The opening battle on the frozen planet of Hoth, in which the rebel army is forced to flee the imperial forces, sets the chilly tone. Luke (Mark Hamill) discovers that the struggle against the dark side is an internal one, when Darth Vader is revealed as his father: even Han Solo's (Harrison Ford) trusty Millennium Falcon fails him and, by the end, the Empire is in the ascendant.\n\nThe Pink Panther Strikes Again\n\n(Blake Edwards, 1976) 1.20pm, C4\n\nGet Clouseau is nearer the mark: in this fourth of the Pink Panther series, the winning formula is still potent, with Peter Sellers sublime as the bungling French detective. But his astounding stupidity has driven Herbert Lom round the twist.\n\nGetting Even With Dad\n\n(Howard Deutch, 1994) 1.45pm, BBC1\n\nMacaulay Culkin plays another of his Home Alone smart-aleck kids, here saddled with an ex-con dad (Ted Danson) who is more interested in his next heist than his son. Only moderately funny, but Danson and Culkin work up a touching family relationship.\n\nSuperman II\n\n(Richard Lester, 1980) 3.30pm, BBC1\n\nThis superior sequel has the nous to pit Christopher Reeve's man of steel against some seriously heavy villains: fellow super-powered Kryptonians Terence Stamp, Jack O'Halloran and Sarah Douglas, accidentally released from their cosmic jail.\n\nThe League Of Gentlemen\n\n(Basil Dearden, 1960) 6.10pm, BBC2\n\nProof that the Brits could pull off a heist movie to match the Americans. Bitter ex-army colonel Jack Hawkins gathers a gang of rogues and misfits and sets about a £1m bank robbery with military precision. Quality cast includes Richard Attenborough, Nigel Patrick and Roger Livesey.\n\nAI: Artificial Intelligence\n\n(Steven Spielberg, 2001) 8pm, BBC1\n\nAs a sci-fi fairy tale about a lost child, and dressed with stunning special effects, it's similar to ET, but this is an altogether darker world. The boy in question, Haley Joel Osment's David, is in fact a robot programmed to love, who joins a married couple (Frances O'Connor, Sam Robards) whose own desperately ill son is cryogenically frozen; when he recovers, David is abandoned in the woods to fend for himself.\n\nOnly The Lonely\n\n(Chris Columbus, 1991) 8pm, Five\n\nMaureen O'Hara, tousled, luscious redhead from an earlier era, came out of 20 years' retirement to play cantankerous mum to poor Chicago cop John Candy in this amiable comedy. Stuck with James Belushi for a sidekick, life looks black for big John, until shy Ally Sheedy, corpse beautician at the funeral parlour, livens up his life.\n\nSerendipity\n\n(Peter Chelsom, 2001) 10.35pm, BBC1\n\nThis bland, unambitious romcom is partially saved by its always interesting star, John Cusack, and the fact that it's set very topically at Christmastime. He's a sharp New Yorker who happens on English rose Kate Beckinsale at the glove compartment in festive Bloomingdale's. They spark, and part. Is it true love? Years later, as both are about to marry badly, they begin simultaneous quests to find each other (hence the title, I'd say).\n\nNew Year's Eve\n\nAnimal Farm\n\n(John Halas, Joy Batchelor, 1954) 12.05pm, C4\n\nHalas and Batchelor directed, produced and wrote this fulllength animated version of George Orwell's satire. No barnstormer, but a faithful rendition of piggy Napoleon's rise to become the great dictator of Jones's farm, agreeing with his four-legged comrades that all animals are equal, \"but some are more equal than others\".\n\nThey Died With Their Boots On\n\n(Raoul Walsh, 1941) 12.20pm, BBC2\n\n\"They\" being the Seventh Cavalry at the Little Big Horn. This was the first of several spectacular Walsh/ Errol Flynn films, Flynn's Custer riding roughshod over historical truths, turning the arrogant general into a peace-seeker and sympathiser with the Plains Indians.\n\nReturn Of The Jedi\n\n(Richard Marquand, 1983) 12.35pm, ITV1\n\nThe concluding chapter of the original trilogy. The opening section, in which Luke Skywalker and friends rescue Han Solo from the clutches of gruesome Jabba the Hutt, is a humdinger: but after that the Force is pretty much spent. When the future of the galaxy rests in the furry paws of the Ewoks, you know you're in trouble.\n\nThe Guns Of Navarone\n\n(J Lee Thompson, 1961) 1.25pm, C4\n\nThis all-star wartime adventure was box-office dynamite, with audiences flocking to see Gregory Peck lead a heroic band of saboteurs in an attempt to destroy two enormous German guns threatening allied shipping. With David Niven, Anthony Quinn and Stanley Baker.\n\nHocus Pocus\n\n(Kenny Ortega, 1993) 1.35pm, BBC1\n\nBette Midler fits the bill perfectly as one of three Salem witches accidentally returned to life and visiting a little mumbo-jumbo-GBH on the community that once persecuted them, but three capable, Home Alone-type kids put spokes in their broomsticks. With Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nJumanji\n\n(Joe Johnston, 1995) 3.55pm, BBC1\n\nIf the kids sound like a herd of elephants up in their room, maybe they're playing Jumanji: a junglesurvival board game that whisks real live beasts into the house, and players into the wild. Robin Williams stars, as a man trapped in Jumanji since childhood, who now has a chance to escape.\n\nThe Italian Job\n\n(Peter Collinson, 1969) 5.55pm, BBC1\n\nTrendy 1960s caper movie (poorly remade recently with Mark Wahlberg), designed to show how London hoods are smarter, intellectually and sartorially, than even the mafia. Crooked Noel Coward masterminds the Turin bullion robbery from behind bars, while Michael Caine is the secondin- command who gets to utter the immortal line: \"You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!\" Real stars are the three cheeky Mini Coopers in which the thieves attempt their getaway - over the rooftops.\n\nDon't Say A Word\n\n(Gary Fleder, 2001) 9pm, BBC1\n\nRegulation Hollywood thrillerfare. But at least it has the always interesting Michael Douglas starring as psychiatrist and doting dad Nathan Conrad: when his young daughter is kidnapped by scheming, scenery-chewing Sean Bean, he has to delve into the mind of a apparently catatonic teenager (Brittany Murphy) to unlock the mystery of the missing loot (you can imagine the pitch: Coma meets Ransom!). With Jennifer Esposito.\n\nThe Wicker Man\n\n(Robin Hardy, 1973) 11pm, ITV1\n\nStaunch Christian policeman Edward Woodward goes to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to find a missing girl, but uncovers ancient pagan rites. Anthony Shaffer's intelligent screenplay slowly stokes up the sinister, erotic atmosphere, with the old devil Christopher Lee presiding as local laird.\n\nBugsy\n\n(Barry Levinson, 1991) 12.05am, Five\n\nStylish portrait of mobster Bugsy Siegel, with Warren Beatty smooth and surprisingly menacing in the title role. James Tobach's script wittily charts his rising fascination with glitzy Hollywood as he moves in to tidy up mob business.\n\nThief\n\n(Michael Mann, 1981) 12.20am, BBC1\n\nThis second feature from Michael Mann is a typically classy, confident thriller. Spare and elegant, it has James Caan as the ace thief taking on one last job before settling down at Dunrobbing with Tuesday Weld. But he's never going to make it: the mob won't let him.\n\nThe General\n\n(John Boorman, 1998) 2.25am, Five\n\nThis may be Boorman's anthem to Ireland, his adopted home, but in tone it's a throwback to his brutal Lee Marvin thriller, Point Blank. Shot in stark black-and-white, it opens with the slaying of Dublin crime boss Martin Cahill in 1994, then backtracks to follow his life, rising from petty theft to godfather."
