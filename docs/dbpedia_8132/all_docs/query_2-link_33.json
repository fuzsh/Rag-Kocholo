        "text": "When it comes to silent films, most people probably think of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Then there’s the other guy, Harold Lloyd. Like Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd has a very distinct look that seems to be pretty consistent across his filmography. Chaplin had his cane, hat and moustache. Keaton had his hangdog expression. Lloyd has his glasses and straw hat that I didn’t even realise were familiar to me until the movie started. The same reaction I had to a very iconic shot at the end of Safety Last.\n\nBut before I get to the end, I should probably go back to the start. Lloyd plays the Boy, leaving his mother and finance (Mildred Davis) in South Bend, headed for fortune in the big city. But instead of his fortune, he finds a bottom wrung job behind the fabric counter in a department store, and an equally broke housemate (Bill Strother). According to letters back home, the Boy is rapidly climbing the corporate ladder, so his fiancé decides to movie out ahead of schedule.\n\nOnce in the big city, we get some great pieces of physical comedy as Lloyd tries to hide his low status job from his fiancé, and his fiancé from his superiors. All of this deception mounts up until Lloyd is climbing the outside of the 12 story department store building in an elaborate sequence that takes up at least a third of the movie.\n\nBefore this, I had been thinking to myself that compared to Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd seemed pretty boring in the physicality department. Then this amazing sequence kicked off and just got more and more impressive. Until the point where Lloyd was hanging from a clock and realised I was watching one of the most famous silent film sequences of all time. The jokes were entertaining enough until this point, but this sequence really takes Safety Last to the next level that makes it so iconic still today.\n\nTwo years later, Lloyd starred in the title role in The Freshman. Once again, he leaves his home town, this time headed for college. He’s spent his entire summer learning to copy his hero, a movie character from a film called ‘The College Hero’. He’s out of his element before he even leaves home and is straight away the oblivious butt of every joke on campus once he arrives.\n\nThe cool kids make fun of him and take advantage of his eager to please nature. The football coach abuses him and lets him think he’s on the team when he’s really just the water boy, and the college dean appears regularly to inadvertently be pissed off by an oblivious Lloyd in a great running gag.\n\nThe big football game finale is fine and has its moments, but it’s nowhere near as impressive as the building climbing scene in Safety Last. And The Freshman really made me notice Lloyd’s lack of physical prowess compared to Chaplin, and especially Keaton. But the jokes are solid. And both movies prove that a good joke is a good joke. Completely timeless, even in a movie set in a time that has almost nothing in common with today.\n\nSafety Last\n\nDirected By – Fred C Newmeyer, Sam Taylor\n\nWritten By – Hal Roach, Sam Taylor, Tim Whelan"
