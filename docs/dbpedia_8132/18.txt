full name: Fred Richard Newmeyer

born August 9, 1888, in Central City, CO

died April 24, 1967, in Woodland Hills, CA

With this filmography, I'm favoring the cast and crew lists shown in The Harold Lloyd Encyclopedia by Annette D'Agostino Lloyd, which differ from the information shown in The Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Until there is further evidence, I'm ignoring Newmeyer's alleged appearances in the earliest Lonesome Luke films, since Ms. Lloyd doesn't credit him with these.

Newmeyer went to school in the same one-room schoolhouse as Harold Lloyd, who was five years younger, but there was at least some overlap in their attendance. He was also acquainted with Robert McGowan during this early period while living in Denver. According to Annette D'Agostino Lloyd, Newmeyer became a baseball pitcher, and reportedly played for Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics before an arm injury brought a premature end to his career. It should be noted, however, that the baseball almanac published by the Sports Encyclopedia does not mention Newmeyer as part of the roster of any of the Athletics teams during this period.

1913

Newmeyer found work as a cowboy extra at Universal, where he became reacquainted with Lloyd, and also met Hal Roach and Charles Oelze.

1914

The earliest reference to Newmeyer in the Internet Movie Database is a J. Warren Kerrigan film of 1914. Kerrigan had joined Universal the same year.

1916

According to Annette D'Agostino Lloyd, Newmeyer was invited by Harold Lloyd to join the Rolin company in early July as a character actor. However, she also states that Newmeyer's first appearance was in "Luke Rides Roughshod," a July release filmed in March. IMDb adds three earlier Luke films to Newmeyer's list, "Luke, The Candy Cut-Up," "Luke's Late Lunchers," and "Luke's Society Mix-Up."

IMDb also credits Newmeyer with appearing in "All Aboard," one of Harold Lloyd's earliest 'glass character' films. Newmeyer remembered quitting the Rolin company after Roach told him he was the worst actor on the lot. He worked for a short time at Fox with Henry Lehrman and Bill Campbell, and then after WWI began, he worked at a shipyard. Judging by the shooting dates, his departure from Rolin probably took place in October.
