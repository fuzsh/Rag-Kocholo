        "text": "MADRID — Peter Stephan Jungk’s novel “The Perfect American” is a surreal, meditative, episodic account of the last days of Walt Disney.\n\nIt seems at first glance to be an ideal source for an opera by Philip Glass, whose surreal, meditative, episodic explorations of the lives of famous men — always men — have formed the bulk of his prodigious operatic output.\n\nAvoiding the long arm of the Disney Company’s lawyers by using only the most stylized versions of its subject’s famous images, the opera, a pleasure to listen to but dull as drama, had its premiere at the Teatro Real here last week. It has been one of the crowning events of the past year’s globe-trotting celebration of Mr. Glass’s 75th birthday. (He turned 76 on Thursday.)\n\nAt the fourth performance on Wednesday, the subtle, moody score, at war between its propulsive and serene impulses, felt more than equal in quality to the festive occasion. While criticisms of Mr. Glass’s music as cookie-cutter have always been misguided, “The Perfect American” finds him in especially unpredictable form, experimenting with sonorities, textures and pacing.\n\nLed by the Glass veteran Dennis Russell Davies with careful attention to both its underlying pulse and its twists of temperament, the opera opens with an ominous, low murmur punctuated by sharp, syncopated percussion snaps. The sound gradually expands through the orchestra and warms into something that, under Mr. Davies, has more gentle swing than the relentless forward motion generally associated with Mr. Glass.\n\nThe music often seems devised to trail off, to run out of steam as it expresses Disney’s struggle with the cancer from which he died in 1966 at 65. But there is nothing exhausted about its inventiveness. Simultaneously eclectic and cohesive, the score incorporates strange, fractured brass fanfares out of Janacek’s “Makropulos Case” and lilting, seductive rhythms that feel almost foxtrotty, like a misty echo of the 1930s.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
