        "text": "This is my opinion as an American. The past perfect is not gone, but it is my impression that we don't use the past perfect when the simple past is sufficient to relay the intended meaning. Most of the time, as in your sentences, there are other constructions to supplement the simple past and convey it as perfect past.\n\nI heard about her before I met her.\n\nThe temporal marker \"before\" supplements \"met\", turning this simple past into the past perfect. But the following certainly wouldn't sound foreign to an American.\n\nI had heard about her before I met her.\n\nor, using the contraction...\n\nI'd heard about her before I met her.\n\nAs for the following...\n\nYesterday, I heard about her for the first time.\n\nThis isn't past perfect. It's simple past, but an American might say the following.\n\nI had heard about her when I met her yesterday.\n\nWithout the temporal marker \"before\", the past perfect is essential to convey the meaning. However, for that sentence to sound natural, I'd have to hear it as a response to a question, such as, \"Didn't someone tell you about her?\"\n\nAs for the following statement:\n\nBy the time he got to Phoenix, he had had enough to drink to make him stagger.\n\nThis is something that Word will fuss about and I'll ignore or modify to mollify. Word isn't the expert; it's a tool to help those who aren't. If you're an expert and Word is catching stuff, either it's wrong or you're too tired. An easy way to modify the above sentence and more closely resemble how I would actually speak it is to use a contraction.\n\nBy the time he got to Phoenix, he'd had enough to drink to make him stagger.\n\nOn the other hand, you can turn the verb around.\n\nBy the time he got to Phoenix, he had drunk enough to make him stagger.\n\nThe past perfect isn't gone in American English; we don't always use it when we don't have to.\n\nAs an American speaker of English, what is happening (as experienced by me listening to media and native speakers in everyday life) is that the past perfect is NOT used when it should be.\n\nThe first two sentences in the OP's questions (in fact all three) are typical utterances in English. There is nothing ungrammatical about them in fact.\n\nAmericans do not use the \"had loved\" in lieu of preterite (simple past).\n\nHere is what somewhat uneducated speakers do:\n\nThey use the SP incorrectly in conditionals.\n\nIf I did it, it would have been because I wanted to. to mean: if I had done it\n\nIf he went, he would have seen the movie. to mean: if he had gone.\n\nIn other words, they don't put the PP after IF for past-tense conditional utterances. This is extremely common.\n\nAnd sometimes, they leave out the PP when it would be better to their intended meaning. Now, this is very difficult to google or use NGRAM for. You just have to trust my ear because I can't search database recordings for the types of utterances I am discussing here.\n\nVery often, when the past perfect could be used by a speaker to be more precise, they don't use it:\n\nSo, both:\n\nThey had arrived before us.\n\nAND\n\nThey arrived before us.\n\nare grammatical. But in listening to people, they might mean, but don't say, the first. Sometimes, it doesn't matter in terms of their conversation. At other times it does.\n\nThat said, I find that the more educated the speaker, the less they use only simple past instead of past perfect when past perfect would be more appropriate to their meaning.\n\nAlso, when two speakers get into a muddle or do not understand each other, you often also hear one speaker say to other: you mean had arrived before you?\n\nThis is almost unconscious because these kinds of speakers aren't really aware of grammar, but they know instinctively in these situations that had + past participle means that the action preceded some other in the past."
