Paul Lawrie, the 1999 Open champion and Ryder Cup player, has had his great, voluntary work off the golf course recognised with the award of an OBE.

Aberdeen-born and based Lawrie, a PGA-trained professional, received the award for ‘voluntary services to golf’ from Prince Charles in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

He was named in this year's Queen's Birthday honours list for his work with the Paul Lawrie Foundation which he set up in 2001 and is now supported by the R&A.

Thousands of youngsters have already benefited from the Paul Lawrie Foundation which was set up to support junior golf in the north-east of Scotland but now includes a variety of sports such as football and hockey.

Paul was made an MBE in the New Year list in 2000 after winning the 1999 Open at Carnoustie in a dramatic play-off against Frenchman Jean Van de Velde and American Justin Leonard.

Lawrie said he and his wife Marian, who have two boys, Craig, who recently turned pro, and Michael, had spent of lot of time, effort and money getting the Foundation to the stage it is currently at.

"We started it in 2001 to help youngsters get started in golf and now we also have football, rugby, hockey and tennis included in our programme," he said of the foundation.

"The main bit is still the golf and the basic idea remains the same - to take the cost away from the parents so it's very cheap or free for their children, boys and girls, to do pretty much everything in the foundation.”
