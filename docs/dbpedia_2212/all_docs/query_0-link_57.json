        "text": "In this episode, Paul takes us through his happy childhood just outside Aberdeen and how he enjoyed playing football before the taxi drivers who worked for his father got him into golf, and made him some pocket money at the same time. He takes us back to his first golf club where he honed his famous short game and the club where he was spotted by the professional and invited to join the club staff and turn professional while still in possession of a five handicap.\n\nThose who knew and know him talk of his work ethic and determination to succeed and how his first sponsor gave him his nickname 'Chippie', still remains his friend to this day and accompanied him to Augusta National. His love of his home town shines through as he visits Pittodrie, home of his beloved Aberdeen FC, where he paraded the Claret Jug after his famous Open Championship win in 1999.\n\nHis dramatic play-off victory at Carnoustie came under the tutorship of coach Adam Hunter, and Lawrie opens up about his emotions following his great friend's sad passing from leukaemia at the age of 48 in 2011.\n\nFamily man Paul also talks about wife Marian and their work with the Paul Lawrie Foundation and Paul Lawrie Golf Centre, and his pride in sons Michael and Craig.\n\nThis is the fourth episode this season showcasing the truly international nature and varying cultures present on the DP World Tour and wider golf family, where we hear from each player, speak to their friends, families and coaches and see the places that set them up for a shot at the very top. Featured so far have been Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts, G4D star Kipp Popert and Lawrie's fellow Open Champion Shane Lowry.\n\nFrom multiple wins and Ryder Cup glory to having to step away from the game due to life-threatening illness, Colsaerts revealed how his golfing journey began, his love for hockey and music, and how time with his family has changed his outlook on his career.\n\nPopertâ€™s remarkable and inspirational story detailed how through his love for the game of golf and ambition and dedication, he has overcome 10 major surgeries in his formative years to reach the summit of disability golf.\n\nLowry comes from a sporting background but revealed there were many times of self doubt between his win as an amateur at the 2009 Irish Open and lifting the Claret Jug ten years later, with his family and friends in his native Offaly giving him support and strength."
