        "text": "It was a dreich day at Carnoustie on July 18, 24 years ago.\n\nAs the final round of the 1999 Open began, Frenchman Jean van de Velde held a five stroke advantage. Going into the final hole, he remained up by three. Victory seemed assured. But disaster would soon strike.\n\nA combination of poor conditions, bad luck, and faulty execution would lead to one of the worst collapses in golfing history; and aid its greatest comeback.\n\nREAD MORE: Calvin Ramsay 'can't wait' for Aberdeen reunion after officially joining Preston\n\nVan de Velde pushed his first shot far to the right, onto the 17th hole. His second shot ricocheted off the grandstand into the rough. Attempting to get out of the thick grass, his third shot landed in the nearby Barry Burn.\n\nAs the crowd watched in shock, van de Velde stripped off his socks and loafers and entered the water as rain continued to fall. He retrieved the ball, and another three shots later, he finally made the putt - on his seventh attempt - a triple bogey.\n\nWith his lead evaporated, van de Velde went to a four hole playoff with American Justin Leonard and Aberdeen’s own Paul Lawrie.\n\nLawrie, ranked 159th in the world at the time, trailed van de Velde by 10 shots when the round began that morning. But on the strength of six birdies, he was now tied going into the playoff. Lawrie recalled the start of the playoff for NBC Sports in 2018.\n\nHe said: “I looked at Leonard, and he looked like he had all the weight on his shoulders, because he had won it before [in 1997] and he looked like he was under huge pressure. And then Jean came on the tee. He didn’t look in the best frame of mind, either. Straight away I felt better. I felt calm.”\n\nDespite a slow start, Lawrie began to pull away on the 17th hole with a 12 foot birdie. By the 18th, after Leonard hit a ball into the burn for the second time, Lawrie was poised to win.\n\nOn his website, Lawrie describes the clinching putt: \"The crowd was going wild and I felt confident and calm. I hit a really good drive, Jean pulled his left, and Leonard was way back after using a three-wood.\n\n\"I went through my normal routine, I picked out the Rolex clock as my line and told myself to make a smooth swing… and it was over. I then knew I was the Open champion and boy did it feel good.”\n\nJust seven hours after beginning the day ten strokes back, he had become the first Scot to win the Claret Jug on his native soil in 68 years.\n\nIn 1999, he told the BBC: \"I think I'm going to cry...it can't be any better. I can't believe it… I don't know how I kept my cool for the four extra holes. I took it one at a time.”\n\nLawrie's furious rally remains the biggest final comeback in PGA Tour history. He is the last Scot to win a major tournament but won't be competing at this week's Open at Royal Liverpool."
