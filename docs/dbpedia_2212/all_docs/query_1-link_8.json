He has also played multiple times for Great Britain & Ireland in the Seve Trophy, as well as being part of Scotland sides at the Dunhill and World Cups.\n\nOff the course, Paul plays a significant role in grassroots golf through his eponymous junior foundation and has three times hosted the Paul Lawrie Matchplay tournament on the European Tour. He was made a Member of the British Empire (MBE) in 1999 and awarded an OBE (the Order of the British Empire) in 2013."
