        "text": "On Sunday the 26th of August, Scotland's Paul Lawrie won the Johnny Walker Championship to secure his place in this year's Ryder Cup European Team. This week's player profile highlights some of the recent career milestones that have seen this talented player from the home of golf return to the spotlight.\n\nLawrie was born in Aberdeen, Scotland in 1969. Growing up in the birthplace of golf, Lawrie enjoyed ample exposure to the game as he developed his skills on the golf course as a teenager. In 1986, Lawrie turned professional at the young age of 17 and has since enjoyed a long and varied career on the European Tour, which he joined in 1992.\n\nLawrie's early years on the European Tour saw the young golfer refining his skills as he weathered the high level of competition on Europe's premier golf circuit. His first impressive finish came at the 1993 Open Championship, where he carded a sixth-place finish. Lawrie won his first event on the European Tour in 1996 at the Catalan Open, joining the winner's circle for the first time.\n\nIn 1999, Lawrie enjoyed a successful season that brought him under the attention of golf fans and the media alike. After winning the Qatar Masters, Lawrie surged to victory at the 1999 Open Championship, winning a major title in an impressive display of form in the final round.\n\nFollowing these victories, Lawrie has been a frequent contender and winner on the European Tour. The Scotsman was victorious at the 2001 Dunhill Links Championship and the 2002 Wales Open.\n\nLast season, Lawrie won the Andalucia Open in Spain, returning to the European Tour's winner's circle. This season has been equally successful for the Scotsman as he carded victories at the Qatar Masters for the second time, as well as Sunday's victory at the Johnny Walker Championship.\n\nLawrie has also played on the US PGA Tour in the mid-2000s, and established the Lawrie Foundation which aims to encourage an interest in golf among young people under 18."
