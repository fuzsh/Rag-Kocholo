        "text": "A new event – the Paul Lawrie Match Play presented by Petsure.\n\nThe Legends Tour returns to Hanbury Manor Marriott Hotel & Country Club in 2024 with a new event and a new host too!\n\nThe format is all set to provide great drama for spectators throughout the week – not least with it being hosted by two-time Ryder Cup player Paul Lawrie.\n\nThe matchplay knockout tournament begins on Thursday with 64 players, reducing to 32 for round 2 on the Friday. The weekend provides two sessions per day, Saturday morning for the last 16 before the quarter-finals in the afternoon.\n\nOn our Super Sunday finale, the semi-finals are played in the morning before the play-off for 3rd place and the all-important final in the afternoon to decide who takes the title.\n\nIn celebration of the tournament being sponsored by Petsure, spectators are also encouraged to bring their dogs to this event so that man’s best friend can also enjoy the week.\n\nDog owners must be aware of some rules in place for those attending with their pets:\n\nDogs must stay on their owner’s leads at all times, with the exception of a ‘run zone’ which is a designated fenced off area to allow dogs to run freely.\n\nDogs are not permitted inside any of the buildings.\n\nSee our Spectator Info/FAQ’s for T’s & C’s.\n\nThe Harry Vardon parkland course was re-designed by Jack Nicklaus II and played host to the Legends Tour Trophy in 2023, won by Bradley Dredge in his rookie season.\n\nIt plays at more than 7,000 yards and provides a true test. Hanbury Manor has previously hosted many tournaments on the Legends Tour, DP World Tour and the Ladies European Tour, producing winners such as Trish Johnson, Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood.\n\nThe Paul Lawrie Match Play was also an event staged on the DP World Tour from 2015-2017 with the titles won by Kiradech Aphibarnrat, Anthony Wall and Adrián Otaegui."
