        "text": "European Ryder Cup winning golfer Paul Lawrie dropped into FirstGroup headquarters in King Street, Aberdeen, this afternoon to chat with staff about his incredible Ryder Cup victory and sign copies of his autobiography, ‘An Open Book’.\n\nFirstGroup has been one of Paul’s sponsors since 2007 and its logo features on Paul’s right sleeve. First has also been a major supporter of the ‘Paul Lawrie Foundation.’ Earlier this year First confirmed it will continue its sponsorship of the former Open Champion in 2013.\n\nPaul said: “It is great to be back at First, the support it has provided over the years for both the Paul Lawrie Foundation and myself has been excellent and I’m delighted that First will be behind me in 2013.”\n\nFirstGroup Marketing Manager Avril Gill said: “Paul’s autobiography is an excellent Christmas present and our staff were delighted to have the opportunity of meeting Paul and getting a signed copy of the book."
