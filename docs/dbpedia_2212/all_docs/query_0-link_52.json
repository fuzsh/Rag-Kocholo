        "text": "Two-time Ryder Cup player and PGA Professional Paul Lawrie has revealed his pride after being awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for the work of his foundation.\n\nAberdeen-based Lawrie, who received an MBE after winning the 1999 Open Championship, set up the foundation in 2001 to encourage and support young people to play golf.\n\n\"I'm very proud because it's for the foundation this time as opposed to what you do on the golf course,\" said Lawrie.\n\n\"I got a letter through a few weeks ago. It's been quite difficult keeping it quiet. It's a huge honour.\n\n\"The foundation is very, very important to my wife Marian and I. We've spent a lot of time and a lot of effort and money with the help of some sponsors getting it to where it is.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who work very hard behind the scenes. I'm the one that gets the accolades and they give the nice awards to, but there are an awful lot of people who do a lot of good.\n\n\"I wanted to do it before I won The Open but we didn't think I was a big enough name and enough sponsors and kids would want to participate. Right from the second I won The Open, the plan was always to have as big foundation as we could.\n\n\"We started in 2001 and now we do football, golf, rugby, hockey and tennis. The main bit is still the golf and the idea is to take the cost away from the parents so it's very, very cheap or free to do pretty much everything in the foundation.\n\n\"I would rather one of the foundation kids won a tournament than I did. I get a huge kick from it.\"\n\nThe honour comes days after Lawrie was presented with the Tooting Bec medal for the lowest round by a PGA Member at the 2012 Open Championship.\n\nLawrie, who was presented with the medal by PGA chief executive Sandy Jones at the 2013 US Open (pictured), carded a 65 during the tournament at Royal Lytham & St Annes.\n\nBrian Mair, secretary of The PGA in Scotland, said: \"I know I speak for everyone associated with The PGA in Scotland when I say how proud we are of Paul.\n\n\"Whilst everyone is very aware of his success on the course, it is wonderful for Paul to receive recognition for his tremendous contribution to the development of Junior golf via The Paul Lawrie Foundation.\n\n\"Paul is a credit to Scottish Professional golf and we are very fortunate to have such a fine ambassador‚Äù."
