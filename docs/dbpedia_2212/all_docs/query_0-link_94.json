        "text": "Following Paul Lawrie’s heroics at the Ryder Cup, one of his sponsors, Aberdeen based FirstGroup, has confirmed it will continue its sponsorship of the former Open Champion throughout 2013.\n\nFirstGroup has been one of Paul’s valued sponsors since 2007 and its logo features on Paul’s right sleeve. First has also been a major supporter of the ‘Paul Lawrie Junior Golf Foundation.’\n\nPaul Lawrie is delighted to continue this partnership and said: ‘I’m very grateful to FirstGroup for its continued support of me, both personally and through my foundation. I have a long standing relationship with them, as one of my early sponsors and am delighted to continue our association throughout 2013’.\n\nFirstGroup’s Marketing Manager, Avril Gill, said: “Paul’s contribution at the Ryder Cup was remarkable. As a company we are very proud of his overall achievements and in particular his contribution to golf in the north east of Scotland.”\n\nShe continued: “His performance at the Ryder Cup did not influence our decision to continue our sponsorship of Paul. We have a long and successful relationship with him and indeed we named one of our coaches in Paul’s honour earlier this year following his victory at the Qatar Masters.\n\n“I think the whole country was delighted with Paul’s performance at the Ryder Cup, especially our staff here at FirstGroup. We’re looking forward to seeing what fantastic achievements are in store for him in 2013.”"
