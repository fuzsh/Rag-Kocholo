        "text": "Age: 38\n\nWhat he does: Professional golfer who might also be called the unknown British Open champ.\n\nWhy's that: Lawrie would like to get a little more acclaim for the way he played on the final day of the 1999 British Open. After all, Lawrie had one of the greatest closing rounds in Open history, considering the unforgiving course and nasty weather at Carnoustie. His 10-shot comeback is a major championship record. His next-to-last shot — a 4-iron to within 3 feet that sewed up his playoff victory — was about as good as it gets. Yep, Lawrie's name is forever on the Claret Jug. It's just not etched in anyone's mind. He won the Open that Jean Van de Velde lost.\n\nHis take: \"I would have liked to have seen a little bit more of 'Jean Van de Velde blew the Open but, by God, Paul Lawrie shot 67 and won the tournament by two shots by hitting the best shot anyone has ever seen down at the last hole,'\" Lawrie said, sounding both sad and perturbed. \"But that didn't happen very often.\" Even now, eight years removed from his biggreatest victory, Lawrie is still getting overlooked. This should be a moment of triumph — the former champ returning to Carnoustie — but the buildup provided more replays of Van de Velde standing barefooted in the Barry Burn than Lawrie holding up one of golf's most treasured prizes.\n\nLocal hero: Rest assured, there will be plenty of cheers from the Scottish fans for one of their own when Lawrie, who was born and still lives right up the road in Aberdeen, is introduced. Then, all eyes will shift to the world's No. 1 player, as Tiger Woods tries to become the first golfer in a half-century to win the oldest major three years in a row.\n\nSlippage since: Lawrie has only two wins since that magical day along the North Sea, the last coming five long years ago at the Wales Open.\n\nPeer review: \"It's not overlooked. I recognize, having been here that year, how incredible 67 was the last day, and to come from 10 shots back. It's a miracle round.\" — Justin Rose\n\nSource: The Associated Press"
