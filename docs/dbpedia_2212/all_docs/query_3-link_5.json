        "text": "Lawrie History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nScotland\n\nIreland\n\nEngland\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Lawrie family\n\nThe surname Lawrie was first found in Dumfriesshire (Gaelic: Siorrachd Dh√πn Phris), a Southern area, bordering on England that today forms part of the Dumfries and Galloway Council Area. \"Laurieston in the parish of Balmaghie, stewartry of Kirkcudbright takes its name from William Kennedy Laurie, Esq., proprietor of the lands on which it is built, near Lochinbren, a sheet of water abounding with trout. \" 1\n\nThere are two other places named Laurieston in Scotland: an ecclesiastical district, within the jurisdiction of the city of Glasgow; and in the parish of Falkirk, county of Stirlinge village. Of the former, we can find no notes about the origin; of the latter, it was derived from \"the name of Laurencetoun, of which its present appellation is a contraction.\" 1\n\n\"This surname is derived from the name of an ancestor. 'the son of Lawrence.' In the Lowlands and on the Borders, popularly Lowrie or Laurie, whence the many North English and Scottish variations of this name. \" 2\n\n\"The name has been also explained, with still less probability; as from Scots lowrie, 'foxy'. The name of Gavin Lawrie, governor of New Jersey during the colonial period, is spelled in a letter quoted in The Haigs of Bemersyde as Lowry.' 3\n\n\"Hence 'Lowrie-like,' having the crafty look of a fox. The full name Lawrence was also applied to the fox, proving that Lowry and Lawry are the true offspring of the name.\" 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Lawrie family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Lawrie research.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Repullulat\n\nMotto Translation: It buds afresh.\n\nCitations +\n\nLewis, Samuel, A Topographical Dictionary of Scotland.
