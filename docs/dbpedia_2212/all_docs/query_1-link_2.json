        "text": "He took the Scottish Senior Open title in his first season and went on to win the 2019 Rookie of the Year award after finishing 11th on the Order of Merit.\n\n2022 would see Paul win twice, a wire-to-wire win at the Farmfoods European Legends Links Championship, then the Farmfoods European Senior Masters which he took after winning a play-off with Michael Jonzon.\n\nA Major winner, a two-time Ryder Cup player and honoured with both the MBE, in 2000, as well as the OBE in 2013 for voluntary services to golf – a reflection of his tireless efforts to promote golf in Scotland, especially to youngsters.\n\nAffectionately nicknamed “chippy” by his peers, due to the strength of his short game, his crowning moment came in July 1999 when he overtook the faultering Frenchman Jean Van der Velde in a four-hole play-off at Carnoustie to claim the Claret Jug.\n\nAn eight-time winner on the DP World Tour, Lawrie played in 621 of their events and was appointed onto the European Tour Board as a Non-Executive Director in 2022. He was a part of the 1999 European team at Brookline in the Ryder Cup and then 13 years later played his part in the “Miracle of Medinah” in 2012 to help win the trophy. Paul would chip in from off the green at the 4th hole in the Sunday singles before eagling the 5th hole in a 5&3 win over Brandt Snedeker. Paul was also a vice captain to Darren Clarke at Hazeltine in 2016.\n\nA big supporter of Aberdeen FC, Lawrie also runs the Paul Lawrie Golf Centre in his hometown and promotes grassroots golf through the Paul Lawrie Foundation."
