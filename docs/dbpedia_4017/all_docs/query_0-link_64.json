        "text": "Yes but suppose someone, we can call him J, is Greek Catholic because his family used to be Orthodox, then his family moves to the US, and they become Roman rite while he I young. Now he grows up. Now because he was only a child before, he is allowed to change rites, an he joins a rite like that Maronites so he can be part of an eastern church. Now upon later examination, he decides he really does believe more like a melkite than a Maronite. Is he sinning or a heretic or anything I he doesn't accept things that Melkites don't have to accept? How should J approach this?\n\nHm. That is a tough one, and really gets to the heart of why switching Churches in the first place is kind of a bad idea.\n\nI mean, ultimately speaking J can go to whatever Mass he wants. There is no rule that Maronites have to attend a Maronite Liturgy all the time, or over half the time, or anything like that. So on the day to day level it makes no difference if J is 'officially' Maronite but attends a Melkite church for Mass.\n\nAll other things being equal, a person born into a family that is culturally part of the Greek church should stay within that Greek Christian family. Frankly, the situation you are describing has me stumped in terms of what a preferable scenario would be, besides simply \"it would have been better if nobody had switched in the first place.\"\n\nI would not think that there is any sin attached to anything you are describing here though. More of a jurisdictional oddity, and possibly a small issue when sacraments such as marriage are concerned.."
