        "text": "The Maronite community in Detroit began with the arrival of Lebanese Maronite immigrants in the late 19th century. Many more quickly followed, making Detroit one of the largest Maronite communities in the United States. The paths from the Middle East to Detroit were seldom direct. Routes commonly went through states such as New York, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Also, people found their way to Detroit via other countries such as Canada, Mexico, and even Costa Rica. Once arriving in Detroit, people settled in the area of East Congress Street which would become the epicenter of the then Maronite community.\n\nThe community was well-represented by various villages from Lebanon. Between 1880 and 1890, people from towns such as Serhel, Hasroun, Tourza, Arbit-Ozhia, Knwair, Zahle, Kubayyat, Acor, and the Kesrawan and Metn districts all lived together. The presence of large numbers from these specific regions resulted in the development of village social clubs, such as the St. Laba Hasroun Society and the Kesrawan Society. These served to preserve and celebrate their regional and religious heritage. Events like weddings, funerals, and religious celebrations brought groups together, often under their village banners. The village social clubs were a means of support for the immigrants, providing an opportunity to socialize and help those in need. They also created a cultural familiarity among a city backdrop.\n\nAs the Maronite community grew larger, the need for their own place of worship became more apparent. Up until this time, Saints Peter and Paul Church in downtown Detroit, and its Saint Catherine Chapel, served the Maronite faithful for worship and for education. When the community was large enough to warrant the building of their own church, a call was placed to the Maronite Patriarchate in Lebanon, which resulted in the establishment of the first Maronite Catholic Church in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nSt. Maron Catholic Church, located at 1555 East Congress Street, was formally dedicated on April 30, 1916. The first Maronite Rite Divine Liturgy was celebrated by Monsignor Joseph Shebai’a.\n\nFather Elias Asmar then began a long tenure as the first pastor of St. Maron Church from 1916 to 1933. Under his guidance, the Maronite church and community made many important advances, including the building of a convent, rectory, and school. The school provided accommodations for first through the eighth grade, and the education provided went beyond academics. Students also received formation in religious studies and lessons in the culture of their ancestors. The school served the community until its last graduating class in 1934.\n\nThe community continued to migrate as the area enjoyed economic prosperity. Following a pattern of suburban development taking place throughout the country after World War II, families moved north along Jefferson Avenue into the eastern flourishing suburbs of Detroit like Grosse Pointe and Saint Clair Shores. As people moved from the old neighborhood, the center of the Maronite community also shifted. St. Maron Church was relocated in 1966 from East Congress to the corner of Kercheval and St. Jean.\n\nIn June of 1966, St. Maron Church was established as a Cathedral under the Maronite Exarchate there. His Excellency, the most Reverend Francis M. Zayek, was appointed the first Bishop of the Maronites in the United States by Pope Paul VI. Bishop Zayek assigned Monsignor Michael Abdoo to be the first rector of St. Maron Cathedral, then in 1967 Father Ferris Kleem was appointed vice-rector.\n\nAs the community continued to grow and expand, the necessity of a new church became reality. During the pastorate of Chorbishop Joseph Feghali, the St. Sharbel complex was acquired in April of 1987 in the city of Warren. The establishment of two churches within one parish became known as St. Maron/St. Sharbel. Upon Chorbishop Feghali’s request, he was granted a co-pastor by His Excellency Archbishop Zayek. On October 1, 1990, Monsignor Kenneth Michael filled this role. Several years later, Monsignor Michael was appointed as the first Pastor of St. Sharbel Church in Warren, Michigan.\n\nIn 1993, a new St. Sharbel Church and Banquet Hall were constructed on the property located at 31601 Schoenherr Road, north of 13 Mile Road in Warren, Michigan.\n\nAfter serving as pastor of St. Sharbel Church for ten years, Monsignor Kenneth Michael retired from his administrative duties.\n\nIn 2001, the Most Rev. Robert J. Shaheen, Bishop of the Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon, appointed Chorbishop Michael Kael as the pastor of St. Sharbel Church. Rev. Backos Chidiac was then appointed pastor for a short time, followed by Rev. Gary George, for another short term. Msgr. Joubran Boumheri was next appointed pastor until December, 2011 at which time Bishop Shaheen appointed Chorbishop Alfred Badawi as pastor.\n\nThe clergy of St. Sharbel Church served the community of St. Rafka Mission in Livonia from 2003 until 2014 when it was established as St. Rafka Maronite Church.\n\nOver the years, the community of St. Sharbel Church continued to grow and our families began moving to suburbs north of Warren. Major costly repairs and necessary updates to the aging facilities also became a reality. A milestone in the history of Michigan Maronites was about to take place.\n\nAfter much deliberation and prayerful consideration, a decision was made to sell the complex in Warren and move to a more central location in the city of Clinton Township. With a spirit of hope and excitement, following years of planning, due diligence, and hard work, we have arrived at our destination.\n\nThis move to Clinton Township secures the foundation of our future and safeguards the mission of the Maronite community, allowing us to continue to grow in faith and spirit, and preserve the treasures of our traditional values and culture for decades to come."
