        "text": "OP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 324\n\nAre there any Eastern Catholics or Orthodox Christians here who have come from the Latin Church or from Protestant traditions and who have had to overcome a sense of not belonging to an ethnicity that was not his own?\n\nI find myself...exploring, I suppose would be the best word...the Eastern Church of late. Testing the waters, you might say. I found myself at first taken by the aspects of Roman Catholicism that I have been uncomfortable with and which seem to be (refreshingly) absent in Eastern Christianity.\n\nBeyond not seeing in the Eastern churches things I would rather not see in my own, I also find myself drawn in and positively attracted to the Eastern liturgy, and to the rather different perspective on various things that Eastern Christians seem to have that I am beginning to notice.\n\nOne thing that keeps me at a distance, though, is that it seems to me that Eastern Christian churches are heavily tied up with various ethnicities, in a way that Roman Catholicism is not. While Roman Catholicism seems to me to have a universality about it, Eastern Catholicism and Orthodoxy seem, by contrast, heavily ethnically-oriented (no pun intended). One feels like something of an outsider for that reason. One's name doesn't end in \"akis\" or \"apolous\" or \"chev\" or \"evsky\" and one feels like a foreigner as a result. It would seem that for a Roman Catholic to switch to an Eastern Catholic milieu, one would almost be \"converting\", so to speak, to an Eastern or Eastern European ethnicity. It would seem odd, for example, to say, \"I'm a Ukrainian Catholic\" if one were not Ukrainian, or \"I'm Greek Orthodox\" if one were, in fact, Irish or French or Mexican. No one, on the other hand, expects Roman Catholics to be from Rome, obviously.\n\nThere is something that I find more...authentic, I think...about the Eastern Church. Something more in tune and harmonious with the ancient Church. Heaven help me, much of what I read concerning Orthodoxy makes alot of sense to me whereas so much about Roman Catholicism never quite did. There are things like the \"Filioque\" issue that I can't possibly worry about because I'll never understand it either way. That would never lure me out of Roman Catholicism. But other things...\n\nAt any rate, I say what I have said with all due reverence, guarding due deference to the Magisterium. Those are simply thoughts I confess to have been having lately. But one thing that still seems compelling, to me, about the Roman Catholic Church is the fact that it is not wrapped up in any particular ethnic milieu. It is universal. You can be Irish, you can be American, you can be Japanese, you can be British, French, Portuguese, Hungarian, Indian...and not feel like a fish out of water...because the RC church includes every ethnicity under the Sun.\n\nBut Eastern Catholicism or Orthodoxy seem, to me, at any rate, geared toward various ethnic groups and lack that sense of all-inclusiveness. What I would like to hear is feedback of Eastern Catholics or Orthodox who did not belong to any of the ethnic groups that the various Orthodox churches are named after or which they cater to (forgive my terminology), yet who somehow managed to overcome that \"impediment\", as it were, to feel at home in the Church of the East.\n\nAlso, is there a \"brand\" of \"Eastern\" Christianity that is not ethnically \"Eastern\" at all, which, while retaining the liturgical and spiritual heritage of the churches that are considered \"Eastern\", cultivates that sense of universality that one sees in the RC Church?\n\nIt would seem to me that I would feel very much at home in a church that had what Eastern churches have but which was not really \"Eastern\" at all. I haven't a drop of \"Eastern\" blood coarsing through my veins, and so to consider myself somehow \"Eastern\" would be bizarre. But that magnificent liturgical heritage of the Eastern churches does seem to be calling to me.\n\nOP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 324\n\nPenthaetria:\n\nThank you for your insights. Let me just make it very clear that for me it isn't a matter of needing to avoid any particular ethnicity or ethnicities that aren't my own. I say that only in the event that some might get that impression from my, perhaps, ineptly-worded posts at times.\n\nIn my own Latin Rite tradition I revel in ethnic parishes. Irish-American though I am, I often go to a local Italian-American parish in the city that offers both a Latin Mass and an Italian Mass on Sunday (no English Mass...can you believe it). I like their festivals and feats. It's great. There are a few heavily Polish parishes nearby whose traditions I likewise enjoy.\n\nWith respect to my recent foray into the East, I enjoy the Ukrainian church I've been attending recently (even if they do all sit in the back three pews so that a newcomer forced to sit ahead of them and cannot, therefore, follow the congregation and is frequently left standing long after everyone else has sat down ). I recently marvelled at a Coptic Orthodox evening praise service, where I was very warmly welcomed and made to feel very much at home.\n\nSo I don't mean to say that I want to avoid ethnic experiences that are foreign to my own or that I would not feel comfortable in a parish that happened to be dominated by some ethnicity or other that was not my own. I don't mean to say that at all, really.\n\nMy concern is more with being able to identify, if that makes sense. In any Roman Catholic parish, regardless of the ethnic makeup, I sense that I belong completely because the Roman Catholic Church, itself, is not centered around or based upon any one particular ethnic heritage. I could be at Mass in Tokyo and I would have no sense of being the odd man out; I would simply perceive that I was amongst fellow Roman Catholics.\n\nNow, at the Ukrainian Catholic parish I've been attending, I am certainly sensible of the fact that I am likewise in the presence of my fellow Catholics. But I am also very sensible of the fact that I, unlike everyone else there, do not participate in what the Church...is designated as.\n\nAgain, it doesn't vex me, so that I cannot feel comfortable there; I am comfortable. But I am at the same time aware that I am in the parish of a national Church that is specifically for persons of a certain ethnic heritage. That isn't the same as sitting in the pews of a parish that happens to be dominated by a particular ethnicity because of the neighborhood it's in.\n\nNow, if I were to change rites...which I am not going to, but just for the sake of argument let's say I were to...I would never be able to really convince myself that I was a \"Ukrainian\" Catholic...not being Ukrainian. If I were to become Orthodox (which I am not going to), it would be fine if it stopped at simply \"Orthodox\". I could call myself \"Orthodox\" just as I call myself \"Catholic\". There's nothing ethnically-oriented about the designation \"Orthodox\". But how could I convincingly call myself \"Greek Orthodox\" not being Greek, or \"Russian Orthodox\" not being Russian?\n\nBut the designation \"Byzantine Catholic\" I could identify with (again, I'm not planning to switch rites, but if I were to). That designation makes sense to me as a style or tradition of Catholicism that isn't necessarily tied up with a particular ethnicity (even though it may, in fact, happen to be). But the style \"Byzantine Catholic\" would, of itself, have no more ethnic connotation than would the style \"Roman Catholic\". Both words speak, to me, more of history and tradition than they do of any one particular nationality or ethnic heritage.\n\nIf Eastern Christianity, then, were just a matter of \"Byzantine Catholic\" or \"Orthodox\" I could perceive a universality about the traditions as opposed to a provinciality. In fact I do perceive a universality in the liturgical and spiritual traditions, in the art and architecture, in the music and so forth, in the various component elements in and of themselves. In and of themselves, all of it speaks to me of the universal Church, and not of something specifically national or even necessarily specifically \"Eastern\" for that matter.\n\nI suppose my question, then, for those \"Eastern\" Christians who are not of the ethnicity of the ethnically-specific Church within the Eastern Catholic Church or within the Orthodox Church that they belong to (either because they converted, switched rites, or married in), is there a sense in which you find yourselves able to identify with that broader universality without being sensible of an ethnic isolation?\n\nAlso, is there, perhaps, any agitation or movement toward removing the various ethnic walls that compartmentalize Eastern Catholicism or Orthodoxy so that the universality inherent in the Christian traditions of the so-called \"East\" might be more readily underscored and experienced?"
