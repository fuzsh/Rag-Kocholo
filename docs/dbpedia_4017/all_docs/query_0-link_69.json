Peter and Paul,” and to meet with Pope Francis, who he regarded as “a charismatic leader of the whole world, not only of the Catholic Church.”\n\n“Every time, the Holy Spirit provides proper leaders for the church,” the bishop said.\n\nPope Francis’s “approach, the generosity, the kindness, the mercy of God is being revealed through his words, through his actions, and we all appreciate him, and we ask God to bless him to lead the holy mother church,” he said."
