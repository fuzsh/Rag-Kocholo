We hope to see you then!\n\nBlessed Massabki Martyrs is a Catholic Mission of the Maronite Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon in South Bend, Indiana.\n\nThe Syriac Maronite Church of Antioch is one of the twenty four Eastern Catholic Churches in full communion with the Pope of Rome, and represents one of the many rich spiritual treasures of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Maronite Church is\n\nCatholic\n\nThe Maronite Church is the only Eastern Church that has never broken communion with Rome. In its unwavering Catholic faith, Pope Leo X called the Maronite Church: “A rose among thorns, an impregnable rock in the sea, unshaken by the waves and fury of the thundering tempest.”\n\nWe pray for the Pope in every liturgy.\n\nApostolic\n\nThe Maronite Church follows the faith of Christ, brought to Antioch by the Apostle Peter, her first bishop. It was at Antioch that the disciples of Christ were first called ‘Christian’ (Acts 11:26).\n\nSyriac\n\nThe Maronite Church is part of the West Syriac Tradition, that draws on some of the most ancient customs and rites of Christianity that developed in Jerusalem, Antioch and Edessa. The liturgical language is Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, the language of Jesus.\n\n“Come, let us bow down and worship Him!”\n\n(Ps. 95:6)\n\nJoin us for Divine Liturgy every Sunday at 11AM!\n\nDivine Liturgy is offered every Sunday at 11AM during the academic year at the Chapel of Saint Thomas More in the Law School Building of Notre Dame - donuts and coffee follow!\n\nBe sure to check out the liturgies and announcements tabs for updates!\n\nCONTACT\n\nName *\n\nEmail *\n\nSubject *\n\nMessage *\n\nThank you!"
