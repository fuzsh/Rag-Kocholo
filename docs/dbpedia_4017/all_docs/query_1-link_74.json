        "text": "The Maronite liturgy is rather of a ‘popular’ or public type. The faithful and the servers have a large part in its performance. The music and the chants are usually of uncomplicated structure, and are well-known to the faithful. The prayers and hymns express deeply the feelings and needs of the people.\n\nThe languages used in the Maronite Liturgy are ancient Syro-Aramaic for certain fixed parts (the Trisagion, Qadishat aloho; the two approaches to the Altar; and the Consecration of the bread and wine), along with Arabic, and the other local languages of the countries of expansion.\n\nThe Maronite Mass, like any other Mass, includes the Service of the Word, and the Service of the Holy Mysteries (the Eucharist). It can be concelebrated by any number of priests at the Altar together. The bread and wine are prepared by the celebrant right before Mass on a side-table. At ever Mass incense is used to purify and sanctify the people and gifts as they are offered to the Lord.\n\nThe Service of the Word always has two readings: from St Paul and the Gospel. There are two lecterns: one for the Epistle; and one for the Gospel, used only by the priest or deacon. This part is led by the priest standing by the side of the Altar.\n\nAt the end of the Service of the Word comes the Nicene Creed, said at every Mass; then the Procession of the gifts of bread and wine.\n\nThe Major part of the Liturgy of the Eucharist is called the Anaphora (equivalent to the ‘Eucharistic Prayer’ in the Latin Rite) conducted at the Altar. At present, there is a choice of six Anaphoras.\n\nThe main parts of Mass proceed as in any other Catholic rite: the Anaphora, the Intercessions, our Father, Holy Communion, and final blessing.\n\nThe ordination of a deacon, priest or bishop takes place in the Divine Liturgy after the bishop and priests have received Communion and before the people have received Communion. The Bishop places his left hand over the Holy Eucharist which is on the Altar, and his right hand on the candidate’s head. This particular ritual shows the profound link between the priesthood and the Eucharist. There are three processions in the ceremony: first, as he incenses the people whom he is to lead in worship; second, with the Gospel Book, with which he is to preach to the people; third, with the Holy Eucharist in a chalice over his head­, the Sacred Mysteries which he will dispense to the people for the forgiveness of sins and eternal life."
