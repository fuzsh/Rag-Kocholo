        "text": "WELCOME!\n\nWe have been waiting for you and believe every person who enters this special place was sent by God. Our desire is to express Christ’s love to you with genuine, heartfelt warmth We are excited to share with you the many ways God is working in our Church and in your life.\n\nMARONITE CATHOLIC?\n\nThe Catholic communion of churches is made up of both the Eastern and Western Churches all equal in dignity. Most Catholics in this country belong to the Roman or Latin Church; whereas, Maronites belong\n\nto one of the eighteen Eastern churches.\n\nOur Liturgy is from the ancient cities of Antioch and Edessa. What makes us all Catholic is our union with the Pope.\n\nThe Maronite Church has one of the oldest traditions in the Catholic Church. Before Saint Peter established the Church in Rome, he founded the Church in Antioch where Saint Paul preached. It was in Antioch that those who believed in Jesus Christ as the Son of God were first called CHRISTIANS.\n\nWHY MARONITE?\n\nOur name is derived from our founder, Saint Maron. After the Fourth Ecumenical council (Chalcedon) in 451, which was held to settle a dispute regarding the divinity and humanity of Christ; many did not accept the Council’s decision and abandoned their Catholic faith. Maron staunchly defended the Council’s teachings. Later, he followed God’s call to go into the desert to devote his life to prayer. He settled on the banks of the Orontes River and converted a temple into a Church. Having received the gift of spiritual insight and physical healing, many sought him out and a Christian community developed. Later, a monastery was established known as “Beit Maron” or House of Maron which became the largest monastery of its day.\n\nWHAT IS DIFFERENT?\n\nThe ritual of the Maronite and Latin Churches are similar in format: Liturgy of the Word, Offertory and Anaphora (Canon). Our liturgical language is Syriac, the written form of the ancient Aramaic language which Christ spoke. You will hear it used especially at the Words of Institution.\n\nThe Sign of Peace comes before the Consecration, of Biblical initiative; whereas, the Intercessions come after the Consecration.\n\nMaronites stand for prayer as we believe this posture prepares us to agree the risen Christ when He comes again in glory. Kneeling is a passive posture of the body requiring time and energy to respond to a guest. Standing has the believer anticipating the great Guest, Jesus Christ. Our Maronite Liturgy focuses the worshiping community on Christ's return to glory. The future coming of Christ gives rise to our standing alert, attentive and ready.\n\nEvery celebration of the Holy Ministries is a commemoration of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The emphasis on the resurrection focuses our attention in anticipation of the greatest of the end of our Christian faith. Our prayers are rich in imagery relating the story of salvation using biblical concepts.\n\nOur liturgy is of course in theology, employing spiritual poetry to give praise, honor and thanksgiving for the loving mercy and forgiveness God grants us.\n\n“You have united, O Lord, Your divinity with our humanity and our humanity with Your divinity; Your life with our mortality and our mortality with Your life. You have assumed what is all ours and given us what is Yours for the life and salvations of our souls. To You be glory forever.” (Maronite Liturgy)\n\nCatholics believe when the priest prays the prayer of\n\nconsecration, the bread and wine are changed into the Body and Blood of Christ."
