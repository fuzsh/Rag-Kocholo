        "text": "The Eastern Catholic Churches Churches are churches that follow the ancient liturgical traditions of the East, while being in full communion with the Roman Catholic Church and placing themselves under the authority of the Bishop of Rome.\n\nSome of these churches, like the Orthodox Church, follow the Byzantine tradition, while others follow other liturgical traditions. The history of each Eastern Rite Catholic church is unique, some having sided with Rome at the time of the Great Schism and some being joined to Rome after that time.\n\nThey are sometimes referred to as Uniates, a term which many Eastern Catholics reject as derogatory, although it was historically used by both Eastern Catholics and the Latin hierarchy, as well.\n\nMany of these churches have a direct non-Catholic (usually Orthodox or Oriental) counterpart. Others exist only within the Catholic Communion as they were either entirely received into communion with the Roman See or never left that communion.\n\nList of Eastern Catholic Churches\n\nByzantine Rite (also Greek Catholic) Churches\n\nAlbanian Catholic Church (Latin rite hierarchy)\n\nGreek Catholic Church\n\nBelarusan Catholic Church (Latin rite hierarchy)\n\nBulgarian Catholic Church\n\nByzantine-Ruthenian Catholic Church\n\nByzantine Catholics of Former Yugoslavia\n\nGeorgian Catholic Church (Latin rite hierarchy)\n\nHungarian Catholic Church\n\nItalo-Albanian Catholic Church\n\nMelkite Greek Catholic Church\n\nRomanian Catholic Church\n\nRussian Catholic Church (Latin rite hierarchy)\n\nSlovak Catholic Church\n\nUkrainian (Greek) Catholic Church official website (English, Ukrainian, Russian)\n\nNon-Byzantine Eastern Rite Catholic Churches\n\nArmenian Catholic Church\n\nChaldean Catholic Church\n\nCoptic Catholic Church (official Web site)\n\nEthiopian Catholic Church\n\nMaronite Catholic Church\n\nSyrian Catholic Church\n\nSyro-Malabar Church\n\nSyro-Malankara Catholic Church\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Council of Lyons (1274)\n\nSee Councils of Lyons\n\nCouncil of Ferrara-Florence (1439)\n\nMain article: Council of Florence\n\nUnion of Brest (1596)\n\nSee Union of Brest\n\nOther Unions\n\nOrientalium Ecclesiarum (Vatican II) and the Post-Council Period\n\nOrientalium Ecclesiarium, the Decree on the Eastern Catholic Churches, was promulgated at the Second Vatican Council by Pope Paul VI on November 21, 1964. This decree instructs Eastern Catholics to \"preserve their legitimate liturgical rite\" and was in many ways a move away from previous episodes of open Latinizations. The Eastern liturgical traditions, at this time often heavily Latinized, was affirmed by the Council. In situations where the Eastern Tradition was lost, it was to be reclaimed. An example of this is the practice of infant Chrismation and communion and the singing of the Divine Office (i.e. Vespers and Matins) which, largely lost in many Eastern Catholic Churches, was slowly reclaimed after the council.\n\nThe rights and privileges of Eastern Catholic patriarchs were also emphasized in this document. The Synod as a form of government is given specific autonomous powers to, depending on the Church and territory in question, establish eparchies (dioceses) and exarchates, nominate and transfer bishops, and to legislate other items such as the date for Easter, appropriate liturgical texts, and the formation of clerics.\n\nThe document also discusses issues pertaining to the Orthodox Church. Eastern Christians are exhorted to recognize their role in ecumenism and to remain faithful to their liturgical traditions as an example. Eastern Orthodox clerics that enter into communion with the Roman See have recognized orders and are to be incorporated into their corresponding Eastern Catholic Church. (i.e. a Ukrainian Orthodox clergyman in Canada would be received into the Ukrainian Catholic Church and not into the Latin Church or another Eastern Catholic church) The document also controversially gives permission for Orthodox Christians to receive the sacraments in Catholic churches (Eastern or Western) without impediment.\n\nIt has been received in different degrees depending on the Church in question. Generally, however, Eastern Catholic Churches have slowly begun to reduce Latinizations and practice their Eastern Tradition. This is especially true among younger clergy who have not attended Roman seminaries and are educated in their Tradition. These rights were formally legislated in the 1990 Eastern Code of Canon Law and the 1996 Instruction for Applying the Liturgical Prescriptions of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.\n\nThe text of the document is available at: The Decree on the Catholic Churches of the Eastern Rite\n\nEastern Catholic Theology\n\nRelationships with the Orthodox Churches\n\nEastern Catholic Churches with Counterparts in Non-Catholic Churches\n\nThe following Eastern Rite Catholic Churches have \"counterparts\" in the Orthodox Communion.
