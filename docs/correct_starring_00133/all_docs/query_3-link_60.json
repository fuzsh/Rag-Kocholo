        "text": "The private signing event held on Saturday, September 28th by Leeloo Multiprops was in itself a year-and-a-half in the making according to co-owner Ashley DiGennaro.\n\n“We all love Clerks and with the 25th anniversary coming up we wanted the Unicorns of the View Askew-niverse,” said DiGennaro. “We wanted Jeff Anderson.“\n\nKevin Smith, Jason Mewes, and Jeff Anderson were able to spend time together in the same room Tthanks to the efforts of Leeloo Multiprops and ZSC Entertainment. The three were assembled to sign both fan memorabilia and props sent to them for signing as well as unique items offered for sale via the Leeloo Multiprops web site. “If it wasn’t for ZSC Entertainment helping us organize all three people,” said DiGennaro, “it wouldn’t have happened!”\n\nWhen asked by Smodcast News how it felt to know that Clerks 3 was now a reality, Smith said, “Clerks III coming back to life feels like a fairy tale come to life. But since Clerks itself felt like a fairy tale come to life, it stands to reason. I cannot wait to show you how it all ends!”\n\nClerks 3 has been in the news recently when fans were treated to a special charity event reading of Smith’s original Clerks 3 script to help raise money for the First Avenue Playhouse in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey back in August. The First Avenue Playhouse had a key role in the history of both Kevin Smith and Clerks as the location where auditions were held for the original Clerks and the charity event featured some of the film’s original cast. Prior to the reading, Smith described this version of the Clerks 3 script as \"the 'King Lear' of View Askew movies.\"\n\n“This won’t be the old script we almost made a few years back,” Smith shared in this new Clerks 3 announcement. “This is a completely new screenplay that I just started writing last night!”\n\nThis announcement is great news for Kevin Smith fans just two weeks prior to seeing Clerks alumni characters Jay and Silent Bob return to the big screen in Jay & Silent Bob Reboot. To get tickets to see Jay & Silent Bob Reboot check out the Fathom Events screenings at a theater near you on October 15th and 17th and see special screenings through the Jay & Silent Bob Reboot Roadshow that starts October 19th.\n\nFor more information about Leeloo Multiprops go to their website at leeloomultiprops.com.\n\nFor more information about ZSC Entertainment go to their website at zscentertainment.com."
