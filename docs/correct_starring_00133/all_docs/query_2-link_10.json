        "text": "Jamaican-born actor (born 1946)\n\nJeffrey Anderson-Gunter (born 17 September 1946) is a Jamaican-born actor.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe was born 17 September 1946 in Jamaica's capital of Kingston. He spent his entire childhood in Jamaica. Jeffrey wasn't a child star, he had a fairly normal childhood. He left Jamaica and moved to the US in 1968. When he moved to America he wasn't fully immersed in the realm of acting quite yet. Before he became famous he had various jobs including a sales clerk at a clothing store. Spending his early days having varying jobs like most teens kept him grounded. The occupations he is famous for include acting, teaching and directing. Not only did he act on the big screen, he also was a Broadway actor. Before getting his big break in Hollywood he attended Boston University, and after graduating he then studied at London's Academy of Business and Dramatic Arts. He broke into the business in 1991 after premiering in Michael Jackson's Black and White music video. Along with when a large picture of him appeared on the cover of The New York Times. That's how he got his start in Hollywood. Though nowadays he tends to stay out of the news, he prefers to keep his life private. He now currently resides in Los Angeles. Where he not only uses his passion for the dramatic arts acting in front of the camera. Though he also likes spending time behind the camera as a director. He also spends some of his time teaching, in hopes of keeping the arts alive.\n\nHis favourite childhood memory from when he saw his first movie, One Potato, Two Potato.
