        "text": "Michael Cera has reportedly joined Wes Anderson’s next movie cast, according to Jeff Sneider of The Hot Mic.\n\n“I am told by reliable sources that Wes Anderson has begun casting his next movie and that the first cast member is, in fact, one Michael Cera,” Sneider said of Wes Anderson’s next movie cast. “Michael Cera to star in Wes Anderson’s movie for real this time.”\n\nCera was briefly attached to star in Anderson’s Asteroid City, which arrives in theaters on June 16. However, Cera will not appear in the film.\n\nWhat to Expect in Wes Anderson’s Next Movie?\n\nWhen asked for more information about Anderson’s next project, Sneider said, “I don’t have a title. I don’t have a logline. I got nothing,” Sneider said. “All I know is that Michael Cera, who he tried to get in Asteroid City, is going to star in what will be his next film.”\n\nAnderson will be busy in 2023 with two films set to premiere: Asteroid City and The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. First up will be Asteroid City, which will have its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 23. The official synopsis reads: “In 1955, students and parents from across the country gather for scholarly competition, rest, recreation, comedy, drama, and romance at a Junior Stargazer convention held in a fictional American desert town.”\n\nAnderson’s films are known for star-studded casts, and Asteroid City is no different. The ensemble features Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Tilda Swinton, Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Steve Carell, Maya Hawke, Willem Dafoe, Margot Robbie, and Jeff Goldblum.\n\nThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is based on the short story by Roald Dahl about a man who can predict the future and see through objects after stealing a book. Benedict Cumberbatch as Henry Sugar, alongside Ralph Fiennes, Dev Patel, Rupert Friend, Richard Ayoade, and Ben Kingsley. The film is scheduled to be released sometime in 2023 on Netflix.\n\nAfter not appearing in a live-action film since 2018, Cera is starring in three films set to premiere in 2023: The Adults, Dream Scenario, and the highly-anticipated Barbie. In Barbie, which will be released on July 21, Cera plays Allan, the buddy of Ryan Gosling’s Ken."
