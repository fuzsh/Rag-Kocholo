        "text": "Some notes:\n\n- The emotional high point of this movie for me came in its opening seconds, when Dante (Brian O’Halloran) arrives to open the Quick Stop and Randal (Jeff Anderson) strolls out of the neighbouring cannabis store (formerly, of course, a video store). I loved Kevin Smith’s original 1994 Clerks when I was a teenager and watched it many times. If you show me the guys from that movie looking older, I’m going to feel a little emotional.\n\n- Kevin Smith’s early films were dominated by scenes in which actors arranged in simple visual compositions delivered reams of dialogue in long, static takes. In the process, he developed a reputation for being a careless and unimaginative visual stylist. The…\n\nClerks III is not a perfect movie. Some running gags go on for way too long, the filmmaking is not a strong suit and they really make NFT references (ew).\n\nBut with that said, this is probably the most I've seen Kevin Smith just put his whole heart into a film. If anything, this film is just Smith fully putting his thesis from Clerks II to full use. It's Smith's love letter to the film and the characters that put him on the map. A showcase of how far Smith has come (for better or worse) and really does not hold back at points with how raw the emotion plays out. Jeff Anderson gets talked about a lot (and he's…\n\nSeeing Kevin live this time around (I don't want to say how many other times I've seen him) it really put into perspective how much he detests his fans and yet gets off on their unwavering adulation. Nothing more pathetic than the Kevin Smith hive of cows cheering like its Rocky Horror Picture Show at every one of his stupid movies. It was really sick when Brian O'hallaran showed up trashed out of his mind and kept saying \"If I would have time traveled back in time and told my younger self that I would be reenacting scenes from Clerks 30 years later, and that clerks would be the peak of my career I would slit my throat on the…\n\nThis felt more like a Clerks retrospective than a true sequel and I have to admit that the first 10-15 minutes felt pretty rough in part because of how old everyone looks. (With Rosario Dawson, Kevin Smith and Ben Affleck being the exceptions). It effectively starts you off with the feeling that maybe we’ve gone back to the well one too many times. BUT when you get reacquainted with these characters and they fall back into their familiar roles, the film finds it’s groove. It’s absolutely dependent on at least having seen the first 2 films. There are sooooo many references to events of those movies that I don’t think that this would really be at all enjoyable if you hadn’t…"
