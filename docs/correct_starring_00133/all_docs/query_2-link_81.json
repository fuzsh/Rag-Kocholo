        "text": "J\n\nJeff Nichols sat in the dark, listening. It was 2015, just after New Year’s, and the writer-director was completing a mix inside a cavernous dubbing stage on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California. Nichols and his team were in the process of weaving hundreds of tracks of dialog, music, and sound effects to create the aural backdrop for his fourth film, a sci-fi thriller called Midnight Special. An explosion was “too wonky,” the music “a little too hot.” Moviegoers can only truly register so many elements at once, Nichols said. “You don’t want to highlight the way it’s put together. You want it to be experiential. Moving.”\n\nIf you had to choose two adjectives to describe Nichols’ earlier three films, you could do worse than experiential and moving. His debut, 2007’s Shotgun Stories, was a revenge story filled with foreboding. His next film, 2011’s Take Shelter, was a paranoid, apocalyptic tale that explored what a man will do to protect the ones he loves. Then came Mud, in 2012, a coming-of-age story built around two boys’ discovery of a fugitive (Matthew McConaughey) living on an island in the middle of the Mississippi River.\n\nAll three films had been acclaimed but, as Nichols acknowledged, “underseen.” He had resolved not to let this happen again, which is why he was here, in this tricked-out dubbing stage—the same one, the Arkansas native delighted in pointing out, where another one-time indie darling, Christopher Nolan, had mixed his 2014 blockbuster Interstellar. If Nichols had anything to say about it, Midnight Special would do better than any of his other movies and be a stepping-stone to something even bigger. To experiential and moving, Nichols wanted to add blockbusting.\n\nA few more tweaks and Nichols announced it was time for a break. Blinking as we stepped into the bright LA sunshine, we headed for the studio’s commissary. We took our burgers to a picnic table outside, and as soon as we sat down, Nichols’ usually voluble Little Rock twang dropped to a whisper. “Wow!” he hissed, his eyes locked on a gray-haired, lanky guy about 100 feet away. “There’s Clint Eastwood! Right there!” I looked, and, yep, there he was.\n\n“Oh, man, that’s rad,” Nichols said, giddy as any fan. “I’ve eaten here, like, a million times, and I’ve never seen anyone famous.”\n\nThe path from Southern Gothic indies to superheroes isn’t an obvious one—and not one that everybody with the film-school cred of Nichols would want to walk.\n\nThis felt like more than a star sighting. At 85, Eastwood is a movie icon and Warner Bros.’ longest-reigning auteur, having made 37 films there over 45 years. His no-­nonsense directing style is something that Nichols consciously emulates. It was hard not to see Dirty Harry’s walk-on cameo as some sort of an omen. “Nobody effs with Clint Eastwood!” Nichols said. “Anywhere, much less here.”\n\nHe took another bite of hamburger as we talked directors. “There’s a short roster of people who can step in and direct these $100 million and $200 million films,” Nichols said.\n\nDid he want to be on that short list? “If it’s good, and if I’m given enough rope to hang myself, totally!”\n\nLittle by little, strategic decision by strategic decision, Nichols has been preparing to make not this movie so much as the next one or perhaps the one after that. At a distinctly unwhopping $23 million, Midnight Special’s budget is more than twice as big as those of his first three movies combined. This film is about a boy with extraordinary powers on the run across the South with his dad, with special effects and car chases and a real live marketing budget from a real live movie studio—Warner Bros., a place where auteur directors, from Eastwood to Nolan, take on giant projects.\n\nThe path from Southern Gothic indies to superheroes isn’t an obvious one, though—and not one that everybody with the film-school cred of Nichols would want to walk. But he does, even if the things that make Nichols a great director might mean he won’t get the chance.\n\nDon’t worry, though. Jeff Nichols has a plan.\n\nJune 2004 Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nNichols wrote the script for his first movie, Shotgun Stories, with an actor in mind: Michael Shannon. They’d never met, but after seeing Shannon in 8 Mile and High Crimes, Nichols decided he wanted him in every movie he would ever make. Through a former professor, Nichols—then just 24—tracked Shannon down and persuaded him to read the script. “Your agent’s always telling you, don’t work with first-time directors, work with somebody who knows what they’re doing,” Shannon told me. “But I got the impression from Jeff the first time I talked to him that he knew what he was doing.”\n\nThat’s because Nichols has been thinking about movies for a long time. His dad and uncle own a furniture store in Little Rock. But during off-hours, when most dads might take their sons fishing, Nichols’ dad would take Jeff to the multiplex. Nichols loved John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, John Sayles, Ridley Scott, and “anything with Paul Newman in it.” He read a lot too—S. E. Hinton, the master of young-adult fiction, made a huge impression, especially with The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. (Motorcycle Boy has “the best name ever,” Nichols said.)\n\nNichols studied filmmaking at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, which he describes as more like a trade school in that it stresses skills over theory. Before Nichols wrote his first screenplay, he told his father that it would be about New York mobsters. Gently, his dad suggested that, instead, he write about “a place you know that others don’t.” The result was Shotgun Stories, set amid the cotton fields and back roads of southeastern Arkansas.\n\nShotgun Stories became the beginning of a self-styled curriculum. Nichols set out to teach himself lessons that would let him make bigger movies down the line.\n\nShannon signed on and even agreed to work for free. Nichols’ mom cooked for the crew, and his dad ferried people to and from the set. At one point, Nichols realized he was going to run out of celluloid—“it was costing me and my family $365 a minute every time we rolled film”—so he cut back on the number of takes. Still, despite the ragtag nature of the production, Shannon was impressed. “I consider Jeff a member of the Southern culture—not necessarily the culture of Nascar-­watching, beer-­drinking people but people like William Faulkner and Flannery O’Connor,” he said.\n\nBut if Nichols was to become an important voice in the Southern storytelling canon, he still had a lot to learn. Nichols “had a lot of ideas and a lot of charisma, but I think he also still had a lot of uncertainty,” Shannon said, remembering how Nichols pressed him for advice. So Shotgun Stories became the beginning of a self-styled curriculum. Nichols set out to methodically teach himself lessons that would let him make bigger movies down the line.\n\nThough he thought the movie was makeable for under $50,000 (“I didn’t move the camera and shot all exteriors during the day”), Nichols had to borrow and scrape to get it done. He wrote the script in his father’s furniture store, “surrounded by mattresses,” and edited it in his laundry room. Lack of money and distribution muscle meant the movie, shot in 2004, didn’t get to theaters until 2007.\n\nFebruary 2014 Southern Louisiana\n\nJeff Nichols sat facing the wind, watching. He and about half his 150-person crew had been on this gravel-strewn logging road in the Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, about 45 minutes north of New Orleans, since dawn. It was day 30 of production on Midnight Special, and the winter had been one of the coldest in Louisiana’s history. Even though the sun was out, everyone was hunched in parkas.\n\nLooking at the director—clear-eyed and stubble-faced in gray jeans, brown work boots, a red-and-blue plaid shirt under a navy V-neck sweater—you wouldn’t sense any jitters. He joked easily with his cast and crew while projecting an air of knowing precisely what he wanted. “You never really have a question for him that he can’t answer,” Joel Edgerton, who plays a state trooper in the film, told me between takes. “I presume if you hid a GoPro in the corner of the room where he writes, he probably runs around and acts it all out.”\n\n“I never wanted to make movies just for me,” Nichols says. “I want to make movies that people watch.”\n\nIndeed, Nichols said, while on set he sees the whole movie in his mind’s eye, at least as he imagined it while writing the script. But directing is “a weird job,” he said, because it requires “this constant balance between the original idea and the fluidity on set. I work really hard on these scripts. I don’t take changes lightly. But I know there has to be a balance.”\n\nThe day’s scene involved all of Nichols’ main cast members—Edgerton, Shannon, Adam Driver (playing a federal agent), 13-year-old Jaeden Lieberher (who plays Alton, a mysterious glowing-eyed boy), and Kirsten Dunst (as Alton’s mother). The shot demanded that a black Prius drive toward a red Isuzu Rodeo and stop short, nose-to-nose. Nichols wanted to show the cars in profile. There was just one problem: To get the shot, the only place for the camera was in a bog nearly 4 feet deep. “There’s one right place to put the camera. I’m a big believer in that,” he said. “You’d think you could put it anywhere. Nope. It’s like a diet of the mind.”\n\nSo Steadicam operator Matt Petrosky and first assistant cameraman David Regan went out on the water in a flat-­bottomed boat—a luxury, all the indie veterans there agreed, possible only because of Warner Bros.’ largesse. They pushed with long poles to float the camera and themselves into position. But the boat kept wobbling, threatening to ruin the shot.\n\n“Don’t worry, I have another pair of pants,” Regan said, taking off his shoes and socks and jumping overboard. Rooting himself in the muck, water to his navel, he held the boat steady, saving the day.\n\n“Dave, is that water really cold?” Nichols asked, teasing but grateful.\n\n“Nossir,” Regan said.\n\n“A little cold?” Nichols persisted.\n\n“Nossir!”\n\nOne hallmark of a great director is the ability to inspire loyalty. Shannon has appeared in all five of Nichols’ films; he says he plans never to miss one. Adam Stone, the cinematographer, has shot all five. Will Files, his rerecording mixer, has worked on four and went to Nichols’ wedding. Julie Monroe has edited three. After Midnight Special wrapped, Edgerton immediately signed up to star in Nichols’ next film.\n\nBut to become that thing our culture so exults in—the bravura director who parlays small, personal films into a place at the helm of a blockbuster—you must be more than likable, or smart, or idea-driven. You must have opportunities to build expertise. In 2000, for example, Nolan made Memento for about $9 million. In 2005 he directed Batman Begins, a $150 million tentpole. But between the two he made (for Warner Bros.) the $46 million Insomnia. It was his midrange training ground.\n\nThose kinds of jobs—and those budgets—exist less and less today. A successful $23 million movie like Spike Jonze’s Her may make $47 million worldwide, but it also eats up a release-date slot that could be occupied by a $150 million movie that could make $500 million.\n\nSo how are talented young directors supposed to learn? Might Hollywood have avoided debacles like last year’s Fantastic Four if it had given its young director, Josh Trank, a shot at something in the middle range after his much-admired, very-low-budget debut feature, Chronicle?\n\nMaybe. What’s striking about Nichols is that, after Mud, he created that opportunity for himself. Lots of studios wanted to read Nichols’ next script. He could’ve tried to start a bidding war. Instead, he showed Midnight Special only to Warner Bros.\n\nWhy Warner Bros., I asked him, and not some other studio? It had a good track record with serious filmmakers: Paul Thomas Anderson, Jonze, Nolan. More important, Nichols had heard great things about its president of worldwide marketing and distribution, Sue Kroll. She could get movies seen. “I never wanted to make movies just for me. I want to make movies that people watch,” Nichols said.\n\nMeeting with then–president of production Greg Silverman, he handed over the initial script for Midnight Special. “Look, I want to be a Warner Bros. director,” Nichols told him. “I want this to be a Warner Bros. film. I’m not playing you.” He’d flown from Austin to LA for just the day, for just the one meeting. “I said, ‘I need two things: Michael Shannon and final cut. Well, three things, because: $20 million.’ Then I left.”\n\nIt was a ballsy roll of the dice. But Silverman’s boss, Warner Bros. president Jeff Robinov, had seen Mud and loved it. Robinov decided he wanted to be in the Jeff Nichols business, and for Nichols that meant the chance at a higher education.\n\nJuly 2014 Austin, Texas\n\nJeff Nichols sat in an ugly office chair, waiting for feedback. Several filmmaker friends had piled into a room with cardboard-covered windows in Nichols’ nondescript production headquarters on East Avenue in Austin to watch Midnight Special. (“Sort of a test screening before the test screening,” he told me.) The effects weren’t done. The music wasn’t locked. He offered the group Dr Pepper (his crutch of choice; he doesn’t drink coffee or smoke cigarettes) and pushed Play.\n\nWhen the lights came back up, Nichols led the group out of his office, past posters for Starman and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, to a conference room. They cracked open beers from a local microbrewery, and talk turned to one very specific criticism: Nichols’ determination to not explain too much. “My feedback would be that I think you’re afraid of exposition where you shouldn’t be,” said Nichols’ old film-school buddy David Gordon Green. “Sometimes you’re holding back, and it’s distracting.”\n\nTodd Rohal, another indie director, agreed. “If the characters know more than we do, that’s an interesting mystery,” he said. “But if the movie clearly knows more than we do, then we get frustrated.”\n\nThis is a central issue for Nichols. He is fascinated by an audience’s “threshold for ambiguity.” With less spelled out, viewers become active participants in the unfolding of the story, he said. “And that’s really cool, if you can get people to basically rewatch scenes in your movie in their heads while it’s still going on. What’s really important is the bigger themes and emotions that you’re trying to get people to access.”\n\nNichols is fascinated by people’s threshold for ambiguity—with less spelled out, the audience gets more engaged.\n\nLike Nichols’ other films, Midnight Special was an opportunity to give himself another creative assignment: Learn to shoot crosscutting action, a technique he has rarely used. The idea is to toggle between two things happening at the same time in different locations. It builds tension and momentum, and it’s a tool for creating suspense. Notably, crosscutting is a hallmark of big-budget action.\n\nNichols, though, was determined to stick to another self-imposed rule. “You keep moving, and any character who can’t move with you is left behind.” By which he meant, sometimes never seen again.\n\nNichols knew that there was a limit to how much confusion any audience could take. And he always bumped right up against it. In each of his previous films, he’d omitted an explanatory scene he’d believed was essential. He’d never regretted it.\n\nCase in point, Shotgun Stories: Nichols filmed a scene that explains how Shannon’s character got gruesome shotgun scars on his back. “Deleting that scene was the smartest thing I’ve ever done. The story got better, because the audience began building that story for themselves. And it clarified for me what my approach needs to be. Like, OK: no backstory,” he said. He acknowledged, however, that in removing much of the exposition in Midnight Special he’d “taken that concept possibly too far.”\n\nIn studio films, loose ends get tied up with bows. Was it really a good idea to always take the shotgun story out of Shotgun Stories? Movies often overdo exposition; people too often launch into monologues about things other characters already know. But cutting all that at the expense of coherence? That didn’t seem like a path to a nine-figure budget.\n\nIn July 2015, Warner Bros. announced that it was postponing Midnight Special’s release from Thanksgiving to the spring of this year. So much time has passed since the end of production on Midnight Special that Nichols has already directed another indie feature he wrote. He even shot a commercial (his first ever) for Procter & Gamble, in Uruguay, Romania, and Shanghai. It put, he said, “a lot of money” in his pocket— a “financial cushion” that he hopes will allow him to make wise creative decisions without worrying about feeding his family, at least for a while.\n\nOn the plus side, Warner Bros. honored the deal he had struck with Robinov—same budget, same marketing, and final cut. In February 2015, Nichols finished his first studio film, and even before it has seen the light of day he could name the lessons learned. “I can talk to execs very clearly, very plainly. I don’t get nervous in front of them anymore.” A beat, and then he added: “I think I needed to tick that box before going into the next phase.”\n\nMarch 2016 In theaters nationwide\n\nBy the time you read this, Midnight Special will have had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival, headed toward a March 18 release in New York and LA and then a six-week rollout in theaters nationwide. You will likely have seen the movie’s evocative poster, which features a boy with glowing eyes, his head poking out E.T.–style from under a blanket, hands aiming a flashlight at a treasured Superman comic (“He’s not like us,” the poster warns). “Listen, I made the film we all want to see,” Nichols said. “I made the film we all sit around saying, ‘God, I wish I could have a film experience like watching Close Encounters again.’” He laughed, knowing full well that he hadn’t made Close Encounters. The thing Midnight Special doesn’t have that Spielberg’s films do is naked sentiment. “I do awe, but I don’t do wonderment.” But the difference between awe and wonderment might also be the difference, he admitted, between a movie that grosses $20 million and one that grosses $1 billion.\n\nMidnight Special’s relatively small budget means that it could never be a John Carter–sized flameout.\n\nOf course, Midnight Special doesn’t have to sell a billion dollars’ worth of tickets to be a success. Its relatively small budget means that it could never be a John Carter–sized flameout. But how it performs relative to Warner Bros.’ marketing investment (in the $20 million range) will have repercussions. As the releases neared of Midnight Special and Nichols’ other new movie, an independently financed drama called Loving, Nichols seemed to be trying to manage expectations—both for his movies and for himself. “Part of me feels like, ‘OK, if you’re going to do it, Nichols, you gotta do it now: Go get somebody superfamous and get a giant movie, or write one, but make it big and take your shot,’” he said. “But there’s a caveat to that, which is that by June I’ll know if these two films that I spent the last three years of my life making worked on any level.” It’s a grim calculus: director jail after two flops, or success and, what, a Star Wars? Or maybe, he said, he’d try to come up with his own franchise. “Like, why can’t we have more Terminators, more Avatars? Let’s do that! I’ve never just said, ‘Let’s do some world-building.’ Maybe I’ll pull it off, maybe I won’t. But that’s what I want to do.” Shannon thought his friend was in a bit of a bind. “He doesn’t want to put himself into a situation where he’s superfluous. You know? I mean, it’s a unique skill to be able to direct a movie of that size and actually have any sort of auteurness about it,” Shannon said. “But there are a lot of ­people who wind up making them; I couldn’t tell you who the hell they were, or where they came from, or where they’re going. It’s like some name on a poster. I’m pretty sure Jeff doesn’t want to be just the name at the bottom of the poster.”\n\nNichols had two screenings of Midnight Special in front of test audiences in and around Los Angeles. The first didn’t go so well; the second one did. Partially that was because the visual effects were done, but possibly Nichols had picked up a lesson from making it that he had not expected. Even though Warner Bros. had honored his final cut, studio execs had still given him notes. And he had actually taken some of them. They had resonated. Nichols had found a balance between standing up for his vision and being smart enough to act on constructive criticism.\n\nHe admitted it had been painful. He doesn’t like to do reshoots or loop in new dialog in post­production. Yet, in the end, Nichols shot one extra scene for Midnight Special. He actually had the money to do it this time, and it enhanced plot clarity. He even rerecorded dialog—five times.\n\nIn recent months, Nichols has worked with the studio’s marketing team to develop trailers that don’t give away too much but still convey “smart sci-fi.” And he has enjoyed the collaboration. “For once, I’m not the only excited person on a phone call,” Nichols said.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I’ve seen Midnight Special. That sound mix he’d worked so hard on? It paid off—the thrumming engine of the getaway car, a 1971 Chevelle, was nothing short of luscious. Several scenes were so haunting that I found myself rewatching them in my head, just as Nichols had hoped. The effects were great; awe was engendered. But more than that, I was struck—or should I say leveled?—by the film’s exploration of parental devotion and the need, ultimately, to let your child go. In other words, yes, I cried in a Jeff Nichols sci-fi movie. Experiential? Check. Moving? Very. A master class in blockbusting? That’ll be up to him.\n\nAmy Wallace (@msamywallace) wrote about a fight over sexism and racism in science fiction in issue 23.11.\n\nThis story appears in the March 2016 issue.\n\nGrooming by Amber Griffin"
