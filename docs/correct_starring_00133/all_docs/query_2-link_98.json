        "text": "GLEN WELDON, HOST:\n\nWriter-director Wes Anderson's latest film is \"Asteroid City.\" It's about a tiny town in the middle of the American desert where several young scientific prodigies gather to receive a distinguished award. Also, there's an alien. If you know Anderson's work, the themes are familiar - teenage awkwardness, grief, wistful alienation, strained familial bonds. The ensemble includes many Anderson go-tos like Jason Schwartzman, Jeffrey Wright and Tilda Swinton. But there is some new blood in the mix - Tom Hanks, Steve Carell and Maya Hawke. And, of course, there's those characteristic Wes Anderson formalist visuals, so recognizable, so stylishly symmetrical, so memeable. I'm Glen Weldon, and today we're talking about \"Asteroid City\" on POP CULTURE HAPPY HOUR from NPR. Joining me today is one of the hosts of The Indicator From Planet Money, Wailin Wong. Welcome back, Wailin.\n\nWAILIN WONG, BYLINE: Thanks - great to be back.\n\nWELDON: Great to have you. Also with us is writer Chris Klimek. Hey, Chris.\n\nCHRIS KLIMEK: I saved Latin, Glen. What did you ever do?\n\nWELDON: There you go. \"Asteroid City\" is set sort of in the tiny desert town of asteroid city, population 87, 1955. I say sort of because what we're watching is actually a television broadcast hosted by a narrator played by Bryan Cranston of the making of a play called \"Asteroid City.\" Got all that?\n\nThe central plot of the play \"Asteroid City\" has to do with five young people receiving the Space Cadet Award - Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson and an Andersonian (ph) ensemble of actors play both characters in the play, which is to say the movie we're watching, and the actors playing them. So at every layer of storytelling, TV broadcast, play, movie, pretty much everyone's grappling with what it all means and how to render it truthfully. This is writer-director Wes Anderson's 11th film, and it's in theaters now. Wailin, lots to chew on, so bite me off a piece. What did you think?\n\nWONG: I was very charmed by this movie. And it's been a while since I really connected emotionally with a Wes Anderson film. I think the last few, they didn't quite do it for me, and I was thinking about why this one did do it for me. And I think it's because, you know, I connect most with Wes Anderson films that are about like oddball, precocious children, which is obviously like a big recurring theme of his. But, like, even more importantly, like, in those films, I like that the adults take the children seriously. Like, that's what's really important to me, that kind of theme, which is why I like \"Rushmore,\" which is why I like \"Moonrise Kingdom,\" like, \"Royal Tenenbaums\" I would, like, throw in that category as well.\n\nWELDON: Right.\n\nWONG: And I think that it's something may be kind of Proustian for me - I don't know - because being a kind of like an odd child who was just kind of like into stuff that not necessarily, like, my other peers are into, and then now being, like, the mother to a bit of an odd duck kid who's very like precocious as well. And I think it all just kind of clicks into place for me emotionally.\n\nDid you guys ever play with, like, Calico Critters or, like, Maple Town or Sylvanian Family? Those are, like, these little toys that are, like, woodland creatures, and they wear, like, old-timey clothes, and you can get play sets for them. When I watch a Wes Anderson film, that's what it reminds me of. I used to play, like, \"People's Court\" with my Maple Town families. And I had like the school room set for them and everything with these, like, tiny books. So when I'm in this world with these, like, deeply serious nerdy children and their grown-ups, I just - I love it. I, like, can't get enough of it. So that's kind of why I liked it so much.\n\nWELDON: That's really interesting. You found a connection, a throughline through some of this awkward teenage, you know, child prodigy, child genius kind of thing to kind of give yourself a way in. That's interesting. Chris, what did you think of the movie?\n\nKLIMEK: I loved this. I mean, when it comes to Wes Anderson, I am predictably a stan. I feel like this movie is maybe slightly a bit of a course correction from him after \"The French Dispatch,\" which I loved, the sort of nesting dolls structure of this thing where we're watching the TV broadcast of the stage production of this incident, that is even more ornate in \"The French Dispatch\" to a point where, like, even though you get broadly that we're seeing different features in the same issue of the magazine dramatized, it becomes difficult to follow. And the number of people I talked to who told me they started that film but didn't finish it was kind of surprising.\n\nI didn't find in the case of \"The French Dispatch\" that nesting dolls within nesting dolls kind of structure forbidding. But I do feel like going into this, Anderson wanted to simplify it a bit, and I think it worked. I think that overcame the coldness that with which some people receive his films. I mean, I never did, you know? \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" makes me cry every time. And I know that's the one that people often cite as like, well, you know, I liked your early work, Wes. But yeah, no, I loved this.\n\nWELDON: All right. Well, OK. This is the across the board, 10s across the board, because I dug it. I love this era of American life. Let me clarify. I love the aesthetics of this era of American life. A lot of bad things going on. But, like, having a Wes Anderson interpret those and juice them and goose them the way he has, this film is a joy to look at. And look. You both mentioned it. This guy delivers what he delivers and no one else delivers it. That's a pretty good working definition of a stylist, right?\n\nSo this is why the critique we're going to get when this film comes out, we always get the same critique. It's style over substance, aesthetic over emotion, dioramas over drama, which I just made up, but I think is pretty good, affectless, cold. He's doing what he does, right? Is he accomplishing what he sets out to do? I think he is. And if that makes me an apologist, then I am. You don't go into Jo-Ann Fabrics looking for a power drill. You don't chomp into a Hershey bar and say it doesn't taste enough like lasagna. He does this, this precise thing. This is what he does. And if you don't like it, that's fine. That's taste.\n\nBut complaining that you're not getting the kind of emotionalism that you'd get out of a Spielberg or a Barry Jenkins, you're going into a butcher shop and you're asking for mung beans, and he doesn't owe you mung beans. But you both kind of proactively pushed back on that point that I made there because you say in films like - and, again, it's always \"Rushmore\" and \"Tenenbaums\" - where he's doing more in terms of emotion than he's doing here. So what do you think is - like, this distancing technique of these framing devices - he's not a filmmaker I would go to and say, you know what, Wes, maybe a little bit more distance from these characters. Maybe that should be a thing you should do. If you do feel an emotional connection, where is the emotional connection coming from?\n\nWONG: For me, it's like - I guess I should preface this by saying that I approach, like, all films and books and TV with my emotional drawbridge, like, fully down all...\n\nWELDON: OK.\n\nWONG: ...The time. So, like, if the person making that art is, like, sincere about it and even, like, reaching out a little bit, I am, like, going all the way to meet them, right? And I'm, like, always looking for something in my own kind of, like, inner psyche that I can bond with. I've never found Wes Anderson chilly in that way, and maybe it's also because his visual style appeals to me, but I do go into it kind of, like, fully open and wanting to feel something. So whatever he's giving, even if it's, like, a little bit and it's, like, very tightly controlled and in the form of just, like, a exquisitely designed sign at a diner, like, I'm there and I'm, like, reaching for it and I'm grabbing onto it. But I think it's, like, what I connected with emotionally is, like, there are these kids who are, like, geniuses and they don't have, necessarily, like, the most kind of open affects, right?\n\nLike, you can - you know that they're thinking a lot of big thoughts and big feelings that are, like, too big for their, like, adolescent brains. And they're also, like, trying to relate to the grown-ups in their lives, who - grown-ups who, again, like, take them seriously, who support them, who have, like, brought them all the way out to this, like, teeny-tiny town to get this award because it's important to their, like, development and what they're interested in. But even within those grown-up relationships, it's, like, they have trouble relating to each other. Everyone is, like, feeling feelings that they can't say - right? - and that is, like, very clear in the Jason Schwartzman storyline.\n\nWELDON: Sure.\n\nWONG: But I guess I just really love the marriage of this, like, extremely locked-down, detailed, fastidious visual style with this idea that everyone is feeling big feelings that they can't, like, express in a big way. For me, it's like almost meta. It's, like, looping back on...\n\nWELDON: Yeah.\n\nWONG: ...Itself where, like, maybe Wes Anderson is feeling some really big feelings, but he's not the kind of guy who is going to have someone, like, shouting something from the top of a building. So instead, he builds an incredibly detailed diorama and then has these people saying things to each other where there's a lot going on beneath the surface, but they're only saying, like, a tiny little bit or they're just staring at each other. And I really like that, you know.\n\nWELDON: Yeah, I go through life with my drawbridge up and the portcullis down and a row of archers just kind of looking out. So we approach these films differently, and I have a visceral reaction against sentimentality - not sentiment, but sentimentality. And that's nothing - something I've never accused Wes Anderson of because again, he writes about these characters who are so disaffected because they're broken because - it's exactly as you said, Wailin, they're afraid to connect. Yes, it also happens that they're standing very still, so the composition of the shot looks good, but filmmakers are drawn to a kind of persona, a kind of personality, a kind of personality disorder. And, you know, I think Schwartzman, as you mentioned, is great here. He gets to emote as much as anyone...\n\nKLIMEK: Yeah.\n\nWELDON: ...In an Anderson film has ever emoted - not necessarily as the character of Augie, who's the guy in the play, but as the actor in the behind-the-scenes stuff. He gets to do a lot more stuff than I usually see Jason Schwartzman doing.\n\nKLIMEK: Yeah, that, for me, is the emotional throughline of this, Glen, is just watching that evolution of Jason Schwartzman from \"Rushmore\" to this. You know, he's an adolescent in that movie, and in this, he is a widower. You know, he's a dad in his 40s who's responsible for these four children. He has withheld the news of their mother's death from them. Like, she died weeks ago, and he has not yet found a way to tell them, you know, and he's holding all that internally. And, you know, although his...\n\nWONG: And in a Tupperware container.\n\nWELDON: Hello, 1955.\n\nKLIMEK: Exactly. Yes. He is holding emotionally, internally and he is holding the remains of his wife in Tupperware. And what you said about sort of monotone acting style that accompanies the very rigidly controlled, symmetrical, you know, pastel kind of visuals of these movies, I mean, I think Wes Anderson movies are kind of useful for helping people to understand what subtext is, what actors do, all the things that they're thinking but not saying. And I think Anderson really likes to sense - one of the things that I find so delightful about him as a director is that he likes to reuse this same company of actors over and over again to the point that I'm watching this...\n\nWELDON: Yeah.\n\nKLIMEK: ...And I'm like, oh, when are we going to see Tilda? You know, when is...\n\nWELDON: That's something I ask myself all the time just in my life.\n\nKLIMEK: I know. I know, Glen. But much more recently, a delightful recent addition to the Wes Anderson players as of \"The French Dispatch\" is the magnificent Jeffrey Wright...\n\nWELDON: Yeah.\n\nKLIMEK: ...Who is...\n\nWONG: Love him.\n\nKLIMEK: ...Absolutely the star of that movie - of \"The French Dispatch,\" I mean - playing this sort of James Baldwin-like figure where he gets to be very emotional. And then in this film, he's the military man, right? He's the general...\n\nWELDON: Yeah.\n\nKLIMEK: ...Overseeing this quarantine of this town where the, you know, the government isn't sure that they want to go public with this story of a maybe, maybe not UFO visitation. So I love that. I love that we take Jeffrey Wright and use him this way and we got to use him again, but we're going to use him in a completely different way. I find that very satisfying as you look at, you know, all of these movies in the arc of Anderson's career.\n\nWONG: Oh, I was going to ask if when you were watching Jason Schwartzman in this role, if you thought about whether or not this was kind of like Max Fischer grown up and now parenting weird kids of his own, 'cause obviously the timelines don't work out. But kind of in this...\n\nKLIMEK: Yeah.\n\nWONG: ...Like, alternate...\n\nWELDON: Sure.\n\nWONG: ...Timeline where Max Fischer lived in this time, he, like, grew up and now has this, like, really cute teenage kid who loves science. And, you know, he, like, drove him out to get this, like, special award. I had all that going on emotionally in my head when I was watching this. And it felt really poignant 'cause it's like we've grown up with Jason Schwartzman.\n\nWELDON: Yeah.\n\nWONG: You know? And I'm like, I cannot believe I've been watching this collaboration between director and actor for all of this time. It made me feel old but not necessarily in, like, a bad way, just in kind of, like, a poignant way.\n\nKLIMEK: Yeah.\n\nWELDON: Yeah, me too. But there is an addition to the Anderson ensemble in this movie, too, and that's Tom Hanks. He plays the father-in-law of Jason Schwartzman's character, Augie. And look. The dig against - and my dig for - Anderson's style is, like, it's a mannered style of acting. There is an archness to it. There is a stiffness. None of those words are associated in the popular mind with America's dad, Tom Hanks. So does he make a good fit? What did you think of Tom Hanks in this?\n\nKLIMEK: I think the way that a big star like Hanks is willing to subordinate himself to the company here is really terrific. And I think he gets the Andersonian, restrained delivery without sacrificing the Hanks. The best example I can think of is - and I wish I could remember if it was Hope Davis or Scarlett Johansson who he's speaking to when there's this conversation where there are six other things going on. And he just slides up to her and just says, like, are you married, which - you know, to a man of his generation, like, that's the most explicit come-on that you could imagine, right?\n\nWONG: I really liked him in this. And I was thinking, would I watch Tom Hanks do Steve Zissou in \"Life Aquatic\"? And I don't think that would have worked. But I think Tom Hanks really works in this one, I think because it's limited and because it's a very specific kind of thing he's doing where he is kind of buttoned up. Right? He's emotionally reserved. You can tell he's also, like, quite broken, but he's, like, making an effort. And, you know, he comes to get his grandchildren. And where I think the Tom Hanksiness (ph) allowed to shine through a little bit, you know, is when he's talking to his granddaughters.\n\nWELDON: Exactly.\n\nWONG: And they're figuring out, you know, what to do about the mom's ashes. It's a beautiful scene. I think I cried in that scene because it's like, you don't necessarily expect him to be so, like, indulgent of these children and their feelings, but he completely is. Do you know what I mean? He lets them direct what is happening with their own grief journey and what they need to do to process what's happened to their mother. And I thought that was beautiful. And I thought that having the Tom Hanks aura come in there was really lovely. And, you know, it was great to see Tom Hanks doing that.\n\nWELDON: Right. Well, to Chris' point, this is - you are imposing all these, like, restrictions on your actors. Like, the Tom Hanks character is gruff and a little broken and certainly closed off. But within those tiny parameters, you get to see the warmth of Tom Hanks peeking through. The same thing happened in \"French Dispatch\" with Jeffrey Wright. It's exactly the same kind of thing where, when you're hemmed in by either genre constraints or any kind of creativity, there's room in that little, tiny space to really innovate and really create and really make a huge impression. All right. Well, we want to know what you think about \"Asteroid City.\" You know what we do. We like it. Find us at facebook.com/pchh. Up next, What Is Making Us Happy This Week.\n\nNow it is time for our favorite segment of this week and every week, What Is Making Us Happy This Week. Wailin Wong, kick us off. What's making you happy this week?\n\nWONG: OK. So recently I saw a tweet from someone who said that they used to put on the DVD of \"The Social Network\" in the background and just watch and listen to the DVD menu over and over in the background. And so then I was like, oh, yeah, that was a really good DVD menu. So then I just found it on YouTube because I didn't feel like digging out my own \"Social Network\" DVD, which is in the basement somewhere. So I put on just the YouTube video, and I was like, this is amazing. There's, like, the sound of, like, a luxurious envelope sliding under a door. There's ambient noise from the Harvard campus. There's a clacky (ph) keyboard, which to me was very, like, proto-ASMR. And then there's a few bars of the Trent Reznor-Atticus Ross score.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF KEYBOARDS CLACKING)\n\nWONG: This is what's making me happy because it was something I hadn't thought about in a long time that, when I discovered it, gave me, like, a very simple moment of pleasure. And, like, the DVD menu itself seems like a piece of pop culture ephemera that's...\n\nKLIMEK: Yeah.\n\nWONG: ...Getting memory-holed because we don't really have physical media anymore. And, like, one day I'm going to be trying to explain what the DVD menu is to my grandkids. It's going to be that meme where it's like, OK, Grandma, let's get you to bed. And I'll be like, no, you don't understand. You heard, like, one bar of music from the score of \"The Social Network,\" and it was amazing. So I recommend everyone check out - just look up on YouTube the DVD menu from...\n\nKLIMEK: Wow.\n\nWONG: ...\"The Social Network.\"\n\nWELDON: All right, the DVD menu from \"The Social Network\" and DVD menus writ large...\n\nKLIMEK: Sure.\n\nWELDON: ...Going the way of the dodo.\n\nWONG: Exactly.\n\nWELDON: Awesome - love it, love it. Chris Klimek, what's making you happy this week?\n\nKLIMEK: Glen, sometimes I like to come in, as I occasionally do, to endorse a book that I wish I had thought to write. That is the case this time. What is making me happy and deeply envious is Nick de Semlyen's \"The Last Action Heroes: The Triumphs, Flops, And Feuds Of Hollywood's Kings Of Carnage.\" This is a series of profiles.\n\nWONG: Ooh.\n\nKLIMEK: It's Stallone. It's Bruce Willis but also some people who came to the United States to make it big in action movies. So we get Jackie Chan. We get Jean-Claude Van Damme. I did learn the origin of the famous shot in \"Predator\" when Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers greet each other and then there's the close-up of their bulging biceps as they're clasping hands. But what is making me happy and envious is Nick de Semlyen's \"The Last Action Heroes\" - great book.\n\nWELDON: Great recommendation. And, Chris, I'm sorry. What's making me happy this week is \"Dungeons And Drag Queens.\" Hey.\n\nKLIMEK: Wow.\n\nWELDON: Who's got two thumbs and feels ruthlessly targeted? Who feels heavily marketed to? It's this guy. It will premiere on June 28 on Dropout, which - I never know how to explain this kind of stuff, but it's an independent, nerdy comedy streaming service app. And the players of this game of Dungeons And Dragons in \"Dungeons And Drag Queens\" is Bob the Drag Queen, Monet X Change, Jujubee and Alaska. That is a solid group. And maybe more importantly, the GM, the game master, the guy who's taking them through the world of the game, will be Brennan Lee Mulligan, who is very, very, very good at what he does. I haven't seen it yet, to be clear. But the Dropout people know what they're doing. I am on tenterhooks about \"Dungeons And Drag Queens\" - say it soft, and it's almost like praying - which is coming out on dropout.tv starting June 28.\n\nAnd that is what's making me happy this weekend.

Wailin Wong, Chris Klimek, thank you so much for being here.\n\nWONG: Thanks.
