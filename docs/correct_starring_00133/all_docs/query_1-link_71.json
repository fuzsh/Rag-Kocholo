        "text": "Some twelve years after establishing his reputation with the uber-indie movie Clerks, Kevin Smith returned to The Quick Stop and Leonardo, New Jersey in 2006 to catch up with Dante (Brian O’Halloran) and Randall (Jeff Anderson) for Clerks 2.\n\nStarting out with the Quick Stop convenience store being burnt down as Dante arrives for work a decade on from the events of the original we soon jump another year ahead and find our ‘heroes’ in almost literal McJobs as they are working (supposedly, as with the first not a lot of work is done) flipping burgers for Mooby’s, a burger chain established in some of Smith’s previous films in his so called ‘View Askewniverse’.\n\nFrom there we meet some new characters, restaurant manager Becky (Rosario Dawson), junior ‘clerk’ Elias (Trevor Fehrman) and Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach), along with some familiar faces, specifically Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) and a story with certain parallels to the original then unfolds.\n\nThat story is, once again, concerning Dante’s somewhat unlikely love life with almost a flip of the original’s conceit and that underpins the film as a whole, alongside which run a series of skits of increasingly ridiculousness (including a big dance number that comes out of nowhere).\n\nWhile the original did similar and couched it in a kind of veritè style, here Smith presents it in the glossiest of modern film ways which makes it far more like his then more recent work but robs it somewhat of something that made the original what it was with a far more cartoony aspect – though likely had he reverted to the original’s style here it would have felt false, I’ll admit.\n\nWhile it doesn’t quite have the wit and charm of the first film, and some aspects of it feel strangely more dated despite it being over a decade newer, the highlights really do still come when the characters are just chatting about pop culture.\n\nThis is reflected here with Randall being very much the Generation X pop culture representative while Elias represents something newer, particularly where talk of Star Wars vs Lord Of The Rings or Transformers are concerned which becomes a running trope that was far less tiresome than I’d remembered.\n\nAlong with that Rosario Dawson is terrific as one of Dante’s rather unlikely love interests and, while she may not be given the best role in the world thanks to Smith’s unique style of writing, she does her utmost with it in a way that rings surprisingly true.\n\nThe highlights really though come when we go back to Dante and Randall together as they still have the same chemistry they did in the original and again find a balance between serious talk and pointless chat that was such a hallmark of the original, and if I’m honest more of them just chatting may well have improved this film greatly.\n\nThroughout the film cranks up the offensive and the ridiculous in its humour to truly eye watering degrees, but certainly brought more than a few laughs (some exceptionally guilty) with it, and though I’m pretty sure no studio would go near some of the things in the script today, a part of me is glad they once did."
