        "text": "GOD’S COUNTRY SONG Star Coffey Anderson Encourages Christians to Support Uplifting Content\n\nBy Movieguide® Staff\n\nCountry star Coffey Anderson, who stars in the new PureFlix movie GOD’S COUNTRY SONG, shared why he wants to use uplifting content to prepare the next generation.\n\nWhether through his music career or now his roles on screen, Anderson said that he wants to contribute to having more positive movies and TV.\n\n“I jumped into this project because I’m a dad that’s a believer, and I want more content like this on their phones,” he told The Christian Post. “I want more content like this on our television. So what better way to get them to watch it than have their daddy in it?”\n\nAnderson shares three children with his wife, Criscilla. From the start of Coffey’s career in the spotlight, his heart has been to preach the gospel to younger generations.\n\nWith GOD’S COUNTRY SONG, Anderson now pursues that goal through movies.\n\n“Christian parents need to support more films like this because Hollywood follows the money, no matter what,” he said. “If we put our money in films like this, all of a sudden, they pivot and start writing it. All of a sudden they pivot in the music studio and start putting out family-friendly content. When you start boycotting places that do trash content or don’t align with what we believe, they feel it. You can say a lot by not going; you will say a lot by not swiping.”\n\nIn the movie, Anderson plays Colt Young, a mentor to the main character Noah, played by country singer Justin Gaston.\n\nMovieguide®’s annual Report to the Entertainment Industry has outlined, year after year, that audiences vote for what content they want to see on screen with their wallets."
