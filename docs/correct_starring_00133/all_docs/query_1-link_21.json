        "text": "Dreams do come true for Jay and Silent Bob ... and Kevin Smith.\n\nOn Tuesday, with just two weeks left before the opening of his “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,” the director announced on social media that “Clerks III” is a go.\n\nPreviously, Jeff Anderson, who played Randal Graves in “Clerks\" and “Clerks II,” did not sign on to the project, and Smith shelved the “Clerks III” script. But the director continued to hold a candle for the unmade film. In August, he hosted a reading of the script to benefit the First Avenue Playhouse in Atlantic Highlands. When Smith finished the first draft of the script in 2013, he called its 137 pages “the ‘Empire Strikes Back’ of the ‘Clerks’ trilogy.”\n\nNow, Anderson is back onboard the “Clerks” train, and Smith is teasing a new script that he just started to write.\n\nSmith, 49, a Red Bank native who grew up in Highlands, shared the news on Instagram, where he shared a photo with Jay Mewes and Anderson. They had talked about making the movie when they were signing “Clerks” merchandise.\n\n“We talked about making a movie together,” Smith said. \"It’ll be a movie that concludes a saga. It’ll be a movie about how you’re never too old to completely change your life. It’ll be a movie about how a decades-spanning friendship finally confronts the future. It’ll be a movie that brings us back to the beginning - a return to the cradle of civilization in the great state of #newjersey.\"\n\nWhether that confirms the movie will be filmed in New Jersey is unclear, but seems likely, although “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot” was filmed in New Orleans.\n\n“It’ll be a movie that stars Jeff and @briancohalloran,” Smith continued, “with me and Jay in supporting roles. And it’ll be a movie called CLERKS III! To be great is to go on. To go on is to go far. To go far is to return. And we’re all gonna return to the scene of the crime! This won’t be the old script we almost made a few years back: this is a completely new screenplay that I just started writing last night! And so far, it’s like a dream come true!”\n\nSmith also talked about how his big reunion with Ben Affleck (who plays a part in Jay and Silent Bob reboot, as his “Chasing Amy” character, Holden McNeil, alongside Matt Damon, who reprises the role of Loki from “Dogma”), inspired his reunion with Anderson.\n\n“After mending fences with @benaffleck earlier this year, I was hoping for a chance to do the same with Jeff,\" Smith said.\n\n“The biggest thanks ever go to Jeff, for being receptive to the idea at all,” he said. “This means I’m gonna get to play with my two favorite inaction figures again: Dante & Randal!”\n\n“Clerks” was the black-and-white comedy that made Kevin Smith a name in Hollywood after its premiere at Sundance in 1994. Old Bridge’s Brian C. O’Halloran, now 49, starred as Dante Hicks, who manned the register at the QuickStop in Leonardo and “wasn’t even supposed to be here today.\" Anderson, also 49, who grew up in Atlantic Highlands and went to high school with Smith, played video store employee Randal Graves, who is always busting Dante’s chops or generally neglecting his duties.\n\nSmith would go on to make a string of movies set in his New Jersey “View Askewniverse,\" many of which get mini-sequels or tie-ins in the forthcoming “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot.\" The director filmed “Clerks” after his own shifts at the QuickStop. The store makes a reappearance in “Reboot.\" Its facade was reconstructed in New Orleans, bringing Smith to tears.\n\nThis year, Smith marked the 25th anniversary of the “Clerks” premiere. The movie’s official release was almost exactly 25 years ago, on Oct. 23, 1994. Made for a budget of $27,000, “Clerks” went on to gross $3,151,130 domestically. “Clerks II” followed in 2006.\n\nThe cast of “Clerks,” apart from Anderson and Jackson’s Lisa Spoonauer (Dante’s ex-girlfriend, Caitlin Bree) who died in 2017, make one in a long line of guest appearances and cameos in “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,” which will debut in a two-day Fathom Events screening on Oct. 15 and 17 before Smith and Jason Mewes take the movie on the road for their Reboot Roadshow, which launches in Asbury Park on Oct. 19.\n\n“Two weeks from the debut of @jayandsilentbob Reboot (on @fathomevents screens 10/15 & 10/17, link in my bio), I’m ecstatic to announce our imminent return to Quick Stop!\" Smith said. “So I assure you: we’re open!”\n\nIn 2012, Smith said that Anderson and his other longtime collaborator, “Clerks\" producer Scott Mosier, would not be a part of a “Clerks III” until an audit of residuals from “Clerks II” was settled with The Weinstein Company, which had produced the film. After the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein came out in 2017, Smith pledged to donate all residuals from his Weinstein-backed films to a nonprofit, saying he would contribute $2,000 each month to Women in Film, a group that works to advance the careers of women in the film industry. He also offered to serve as a mentor to women filmmakers.\n\nOf course, there wouldn’t be any “Clerks” sequels if Smith had stuck with his original ending for the first movie, in which Dante is shot dead by a customer who loots the cash register.\n\nHave a tip?
