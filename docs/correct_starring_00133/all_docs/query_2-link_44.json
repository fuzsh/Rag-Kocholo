        "text": "Serial killers Mark Witver and his son Adam murder artist Elizabeth Anderson by staging her death to look like a suicide.\n\nAfter working an arrest with his partner Kelly Alderman, LAPD homicide detective Jeff Anderson notices two men on the street when he comes home to his apartment. After putting their young son Frankie to bed, Jeff finds his wife dead in the bathtub.\n\nThree months later, Jeff obsessively continues investigating suicide scenes. Having taken the captain promotion Jeff was in line for, Kelly reprimands Jeff for not letting Elizabeth’s death go. Jeff insists his wife murdered. Jeff is also admonished by his mother Angela for neglecting his son, whom he left in Angela’s care while looking into Elizabeth’s death.\n\nThree more months later, a woman named Jane Wilson survives one of Mark and Adam’s attacks, proving Jeff’s suspicion about killers staging murders to look like suicides. Jeff connects 19 cases of prominent women who supposedly killed themselves that he thinks could be the work of the Witvers. Jeff also identifies potential targets, but Kelly refuses to devote the necessary resources for protection without any hard evidence.\n\nJeff personally stakes out the homes of notable women he thinks could be killed next. Jeff eventually ends up catching Mark and Adam in the act of assaulting Amanda Tyler. Mark instructs Adam to enact their contingency plan. Adam escapes while Mark surrenders to the police.\n\nDuring subsequent questioning, Jeff learns Mark murdered his own mother as well as his wife out of career envy, but staged both deaths to look like suicides. Mark’s interrogation ends when Angela reports Adam kidnapped Frankie and the boy is being held as leverage to obtain Mark’s release.\n\nJeff angrily pulls his gun on Mark. Mark gets the weapon. Mark kills Kelly and forces Jeff to drive him away from the station.\n\nJeff ultimately gets his gun back. Jeff drives Mark to the desert and shoots his kneecap over the phone to force Adam to show up with Frankie.\n\nAdam refuses to produce Frankie when he arrives at the desert location. Jeff shoots Mark several more times and finally kills him as Adam continues to threaten Frankie. Jeff and Adam fight. Jeff beats Adam to the ground. Jeff prepares to shoot Adam just as Frankie frees himself from the trunk of Adam’s vehicle.\n\nJeff puts Frankie in his car and handcuffs Adam. Jeff discards his police badge, but Frankie recovers it while telling his father people need him to catch bad guys. Jeff drives away with Frankie, leaving Adam behind to be arrested.\n\nReview:\n\nThe first rule of unshaven maverick movie cops is they must have something to obsess over. For LAPD homicide detective Jeff Anderson, it’s the haunting death of his wife Elizabeth.\n\nSeveral months ago, Jeff came home to find his wife with slit wrists and a belly full of sleeping pills. Jeff was immediately suspicious. Elizabeth wasn’t suicidal. Their young son Frankie mentioned a nightmare involving someone strange in their apartment. And Jeff remembers seeing two men in the shadows on the street before he went upstairs.\n\nConvinced his wife was a serial killer’s victim, Jeff has been immersed in the mystery ever since. Jeff’s partner Kelly took the promotion he punted due to the tragedy, and she isn’t impressed with how deeply Jeff remains devoted to proving his hunch. Neither is Jeff’s mother Angela, who has been saddled with raising Frankie because Jeff’s doggedness only leaves enough personal time to forget Disneyland plans with his son.\n\nKelly and Angela join Jeff’s side when another woman survives a frightful encounter with a deadly father-son duo. Jeff connects several supposed suicides of prominent women to the murderous men’s M.O. and sees a pattern whose path cut right through his home. Catching these killers was already personal. It becomes even more so when the men detect Jeff on the hunt and decide to turn their “suiciding” spree into a family affair once again.\n\nPreviously titled “Anderson Falls,” and not to be confused with a 2003 horror film bearing the same title, “Darkness Falls” is a dramatic crime thriller that’s more dramatic than thrilling. A breezy 84-minute runtime edits for an even rhythm that operates at a steadily safe pace. Although cinematography stocks up on familiar establishing shots like downtown L.A. skylines and overhead travel tracking drones, visuals are still appealingly crisp. Persistent music maintains a heavy mood too. But because “Darkness Falls” swims in a shallow pool of cop and killer clichés, the film plays like a “Law and Order: Criminal Intent” two-parter or similarly pedestrian police procedural that’s been tamed down to fit small screen standards.\n\nIt’s impossible to fall behind the plot’s development since dialogue enjoys dealing in declarative exposition. Viewers are constantly kept in the know with characters conveniently speaking in awkwardly informative sentences such as, “his wife killed herself three months ago. He’s been prowling suicide scenes ever since.” We’re similarly caught up on the conflict between Jeff and his former partner-turned-boss when she reminds him, “I didn’t steal your job. I took the damn job because you threw it down the toilet.”\n\nInherent design limitations prevent the story from moving any faster than its 55 mph baseline. One reason why suspense never breaks a sweat has to do with how long it takes Jeff to catch up to what the audience finds out in the prologue. Another reason relates to the sedated tactics the murderers use to dispose of their victims, which isn’t cinematically exciting at all.\n\nThe first scene features the father and son killers forcing Jeff’s wife to swallow pills before dragging her drugged body to the bathtub. It’s a weirdly long one-er filmed in a wide shot from an adjacent room. That far distance combined with a lack of close-ups to quicken the pulse puts a thick pin in a balloon wheezing to fill up with tension. This setup stays a fair cry from being totally boring, though it’s not exactly invigorated with energetic shocks either.\n\n“Darkness Falls” additionally infuses dark clouds into its DNA through persistently draining storms of sadness. When a would-be victim recounts how her boyfriend interrupted the attempt on her life, Jeff has the unfortunate duty of informing the beaten woman that her beau was subsequently shot and killed. On cue, the woman has an ugly cry breakdown in her hospital bed. This inessential moment doesn’t advance anything. It merely injects more anguish into an atmosphere already blanketed by bleakness when it could have avoided psychologically torturing a single-scene side character altogether.\n\nGrey skies see brief balancing from the melancholy of Jeff’s memories. Tears well in Jeff’s wide eyes when bright flashbacks recall watching the sunset with his wife or laughingly cuddling in bed while piano keys echo underneath. The death grip “Darkness Falls” puts on heartstrings tugs so desperately, it’s a wonder each rental doesn’t come with a custom tissue box.\n\nHow does “Darkness Falls” roll a saving throw against all of these arrows of apathy? Even stuffed with stereotypes, the film earns its stripes from a competent cast of reliable, often undervalued character actors stepping up into spotlight roles.\n\nUnintentional snickers arise when Jeff viciously shouts “I hate you” at his Charlie Day conspiracy wall of female faces so he can climb into the heads of the killers and learn to “think like them.” Hardly an approved profiling tactic, Shawn Ashmore nevertheless maintains a serious tone even when it’s counterintuitive to cursory writing. Ashmore’s determinedness to give Jeff more conviction than his thin characterization deserves results in a sympathetic presence, and a performance that’s as robust as it can realistically get.\n\nGary Cole does the same as Mark, the elder half of the two killers. Mark doesn’t do more than the customary gloating and goading consistent with any bad guy playing cat-and-mouse games with an on-the-edge police officer. Ever the professional, Cole stills cocks a sneering smirk and chews as much of the scenery as his dialogue’s dentures permit. He’s no Hannibal Lecter, not even close, yet he fits the bill fine as this week’s guest star on an extended episode of “Criminal Minds.”\n\nWhich links back to the introductory analogy. The inoffensively beige creativity of “Darkness Falls” situates it comfortably alongside the likes of any “watch while folding laundry” show following Dick Wolf’s famous recipe. Professional polish and actors resigned with “let’s just give it a go” attitudes keep the movie’s mouth breathing above the waterline where average separates “alright” from forgettable waste of time. Some opinions will sink below that level, though there’s something to be said for midline entertainment that only requires minimal audience engagement to get a remedial job done.\n\nReview Score: 55"
