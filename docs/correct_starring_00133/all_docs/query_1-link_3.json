        "text": "For other people with the same name, see Jeffrey Anderson (disambiguation).\n\nAmerican film actor, film director, and screenwriter\n\nJeffrey Allan Anderson (born April 21, 1970) is an American film and television actor, director, and screenwriter best known for starring as Randal Graves in Clerks, Clerks II, and Clerks III. In between, he has appeared in other Kevin Smith-directed films and has written, directed, and starred in Now You Know.[2]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Connecticut and raised in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, Anderson attended Henry Hudson Regional High School, with his friend, aspiring writer Kevin Smith; they graduated in 1988.[3]\n\nWhile Anderson was working at AT&T, Smith was working on his debut movie Clerks. As a joke, Anderson auditioned for the role of \"Jay,\"[citation needed] and based on this audition, Smith later offered Anderson a lead role as video store employee Randal Graves, a foul-mouthed apathetic slacker, who patronized, angered, and mocked his customers while avoiding any real work opportunities.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nFor his role in Clerks, Anderson was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Debut Performance.[4]\n\nIn 2002, Anderson wrote, directed, and starred in Now You Know. The writing process lasted only three months. Anderson received a nomination for Best Male Performance at the Chicago Film Festival for his role in Love 101, and has been seen in Peter Bergstrom's Something Cool. Anderson also started his own production company in Hollywood.\n\nAnderson was initially reluctant to reprise his role as Randal, but changed his mind after reading Kevin Smith's screenplay for Clerks II, and in 2006 appeared in the sequel.\n\nIn 2008, Anderson appeared in Smith's romantic comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno as Deacon, the cameraman and film editor for the porno made by leading actors Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.\n\nOn September 14, 2010, Anderson made his first appearance on Smith's SModcast filling in for Scott Mosier on SModcast #134. In his podcast, Anderson stated he had moved out of Los Angeles and into a \"retirement community in the mountains\" where he is \"the youngest person there by 20 years.\" He also said he remarried in 2009, to an actress named Barbara Jacques[5] he met while house sitting for Kevin Smith.[1]\n\nIn April 2017, Anderson declined to reprise his role as Randal for Clerks III; the reasons have not been made public. An $8 million budget had been obtained, locations were being scouted in Philadelphia and a crew was being assembled, and the start of production was less than two months away. Due to Anderson's decision, production on the film was halted indefinitely, with Smith saying he would not recast the role.[6][7] On October 1, 2019, Smith announced on Instagram that Clerks III was happening and that Anderson agreed to reprise his role as Randal. \"It'll be a movie that concludes a saga. It'll be a movie about how you're never too old to completely change your life. It'll be a movie about how a decades-spanning friendship finally confronts the future. It'll be a movie that brings us back to the beginning â€” a return to the cradle of civilization in the great state of #newjersey. It'll be a movie that stars Jeff and Brian O'Halloran, with me and Jay in supporting roles. And it'll be a movie called CLERKS III!\"[8] Clerks III was released in 2022, completely rewritten from the 2017 version.[9]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm work by Jeff Anderson Year Title Role Notes 1994 Clerks Randal Graves 1999 Dogma Gun Salesman 2000 Love 101 Phil 2000 Vulgar Surly Duck Voice role; uncredited 2001 Stealing Time Buddy 2001 Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back Randal Graves 2002 Now You Know Gil also director and writer 2002 The Flying Car Randal Graves Short film 2004 Clerks: The Lost Scene Randal Graves Short film; voice role 2006 Clerks II Randal Graves 2008 Zack and Miri Make a Porno Deacon 2014 Finding London Sam Short film 2022 Clerks III Randal Graves Also executive producer TBA Nasa Seals Dr. Jay Lavely filming\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision work by Jeff Anderson Year Title Role Notes 2000-2001 Clerks: The Animated Series Randal Graves Main role; 6 episodes, voice role 2011 Star Wars: The Clone Wars Smug Episode: \"Wookiee Hunt\"; voice role\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nVideo game work by Jeff Anderson Year Title Role Notes 2014 Randal's Monday Randal Hicks Voice role\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
