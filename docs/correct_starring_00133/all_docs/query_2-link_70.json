        "text": "Preview:\n\nGillian Anderson is the latest person cast in ‘Tron: Ares’.\n\nShooting has now kicked off on the movie following a delay.\n\nThe movie should be on screens next year.\n\nIt has been a long road to the screen for the third ‘Tron’ movie. In development since the second film, 2010’s ‘Tron: Legacy’, arrived, ‘Tron: Ares’ (as it is currently called) has faced multiple challenges so far, not the least of which was being shut down before it could begin shooting last year when the writers and actors’ strikes hit.\n\nBut now, it has turned a corner (or swerved on a right angle given how the iconic Light cycles work), and the cameras are finally rolling on the long-anticipated sequel, which follows both ‘Legacy’ and the 1982 original ‘Tron’, which sees humans drawn into a virtual world.\n\nNow, with Jared Leto starring as a character called Ares, it looks like the opposite will be happening, and Gillian Anderson is the latest addition to the cast, playing an unknown role.\n\nWhat’s the story of ‘Tron: Ares’?\n\nWritten by Jesse Wigutow and Jack Thorne, the script follows Leto’s computer program Ares on a journey from the digital world to that of humans.\n\nThere’s no word yet on whether Jeff Bridges (who starred in the original and also showed up in ‘Legacy’) or ‘Legacy’ stars Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde will be back, though we’d especially have to doubt Wilde’s return for anything other than a cameo given her busy directing career.\n\nRelated Article: Joachim Rønning Directing Jared Leto in New Sci-fi Sequel ‘Tron: Ares’\n\nWho stars in ‘Tron: Ares’?\n\nWith Leto taking the title role and Anderson now aboard, ‘Tron: Ares’ also stars Evan Peters, Greta Lee, Sarah Desjardins, Cameron Monaghan and Jodie Turner-Smith.\n\nWho is making ‘Tron: Ares’?\n\nJoachim Rønning, who has plenty of Disney sequel experience following ‘Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales’ and ‘Maleficent: Mistress of Evil’, is behind the camera for the new movie, and he celebrated finally getting to start rolling the cameras with an Instagram post…\n\nHe previously bemoaned the delay in shooting:\n\n“Today was supposed to be our first day of principal photography on ‘Tron: Ares’ (a movie subsequently about AI and what it means, and takes, to be human). Instead, we are shut down with over a hundred and fifty people laid off. It’s indefinite, which makes it exponentially harder for everyone. The AMPTP, SAG-AFTRA and WGA need to speed up the negotiating process and not leave the table until it’s done. This is Hollywood. We close deals for breakfast. Why do we suddenly have all the time in the world when every day is so precious? These tactics are extremely frustrating. It’s time for diplomacy so we can get back to work –– under conditions that are fair to everybody.”\n\nWhen will ‘Tron: Ares’ be in theaters?\n\nDisney has yet to confirm whether the film –– which will require plenty of post-production work –– will maintain a 2025 release date, but the fact that it’s now shooting is a hopeful sign.\n\nOther Movies Similar to ‘Tron: Ares':\n\n'The Black Hole' (1979)\n\n'Tron' (1982)\n\n'WarGames' (1983)\n\n'Johnny Mnemonic' (1995)\n\n'The Matrix' (1999)\n\n'Avatar' (2009)\n\n'TRON: Legacy' (2010)\n\n'TRON: The Next Day' (2011)\n\n'Her' (2013)\n\n'Transcendence' (2014)\n\n'Ex Machina' (2015)\n\n'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' (2017)\n\n'Ready Player One' (2018)\n\n'Free Guy' (2021)"
