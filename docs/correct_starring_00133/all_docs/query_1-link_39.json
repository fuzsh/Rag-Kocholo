        "text": "The sequel to the Kevin Smith movie Clerks (1994) began on cinematic fire. A dozen years later, Clerks II (2006) brings back Brian O’Halloran as Dante Hicks, whose world makes a move to Mooby’s fast food after Randal Graves, as portrayed by Jeff Anderson, sends their collective slacker dreams up in smoke with a pot of coffee left on overnight.\n\nThe move to Mooby’s, which takes place at what clearly is a former Burger King restaurant, comes moments after Dante discovers that the Quick Stop with adjacent RST Video of the original Clerks movie had burned Randal had caused a fire the night before. The discovery comes upon opening the notorious anti-theft doors of that original movie. The discovery is presented to Dante’s comic disbelief, followed by efforts to extinguish the total loss of a fire that introduces the search for what becomes the location for a movie set ten years after the original film.\n\nA decent amount of time passes between that devastation and our seeing Randal working with Dante in fast food. We are quickly introduced to the pair’s new manager, Becky Scott as portrayed by Rosario Dawson. Dante continues with his plan to move on from his minimum wage lifestyle, still, with his overbearing fiancée Emma Bunting presented as a tonic to this ailment. Bunting, as portrayed by Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, brings with her a move to Florida plus a home and the operation of a carwash as furnished by her wealthy parents as a means for setting the couple up after marriage.\n\nThe tension for Randal that the pending move brings outweighs the better nature of his wishes for Dante’s longer term happiness. Randal does go about planning a proper sendoff for Dante, while an elaborate day in the life story at Mooby’s introduces the writing humor of screenplay writer Kevin Smith that we met with the original Clerks. Beyond the clear feelings that Dante has developed for his boss at the restaurant, Becky, we take notice of the lackadaisical approach Randal takes to his work. Not only is he leaving much of the work to devout Christian teenager Elias Grove, as portrayed by Trevor Fehrman, we see Randal planning a bachelor party for Dante that evening at Mooby’s that brings in Sexy Stud as portrayed by Zak Knutson.\n\nA string of cameos filled by customers fills out the restaurant operation as the core tension of the movie takes place. We are reacquanted with Jay and Silent Bob, as portrayed by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith respectively, along with fleeting roles by Kevin Weisman in the role of Lord of the Rings geek. Jason Lee, Wanda Sykes, Earthquake (aka Nathaniel Martin Stroman), Ethan Suplee, Ben Affleck, Scott Mosier and Walter Flanagan. The delivery of Jay and Silent Bob to what presents itself later in the film, after the tension reaches its highest pressure point, lends itself to a second sequel that we know appeared in 2022.\n\nI largely found the second installment of Clerks offered the sensibility of the original while getting into the graphic style of humor that made the film a cult classic. The humor landed a bit more strongly than did the peace of mind in life that endeared many to the writing of Kevin Smith in the first place. I give Clerks II as written and directed by Kevin Smith 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, November 15, 2023"
