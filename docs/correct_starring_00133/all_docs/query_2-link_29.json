        "text": "Asteroid City, as described by David Ehrlich, is “a film about a television program about a play within a play ‘about infinity and I don’t know what else’ (as one character describes it)”. A cosmic onion, if you will; layers within layers, made with the director’s self-described “peculiar methods”, which are intrinsic to his meticulous processes (and all new to Tom Hanks, but we’ll get to that). The film is a spiritual sibling to The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited: there is family melancholy, and the kind of winding journey that lost souls take to navigate their grief (a funeral scene in Darjeeling set to ‘Strangers’ by The Kinks remains one of my favorite Anderson creations).\n\nAnderson arrives from the adjacent balcony, pointing to the sky and telling me that Coppola and their third musketeer Jason Schwartzman have their bedrooms in the two windows above our heads. The filmmaker is picture-perfect against the coastal backdrop in his blue-and-green checked shirt, blue pinstripe trousers and pink ribbed socks (no shoes). A tiny cup of espresso, blue tinted sunglasses, his singular Southern lilt, and we are ready to roll. It’s a moment you’d imagine as a work of Anderson’s own fiction, but this day is very real.\n\n“We became a little team on Darjeeling,” Anderson says of his hotel neighbors and emotional brothers. “We’ve been like that ever since.” The Darjeeling Limited was selflessly designed to give Schwartzman a role that Coppola and Anderson knew he was capable of. Selfishly, it also gave Anderson the chance to explore India, a country he’d forever been fascinated by. “We wanted to act out the movie in real life, as foreigners in this country. We knew the sort of story we wanted to tell, but we let it come to us as we traveled.”\n\nSixteen years later, the trio took their storytelling circus to Spain, during the 2021 part of the pandemic, for Asteroid City. As Nicolas Nomas points out: “This film focuses on the beauty of storytelling rather than focusing on the story that is being told.” No part of the tale is lacking in beauty, but it’s between the lines of the 1950s theater troupe and the nuclear families quarantined in Asteroid City that sparks begin to fly. And it is, above all else, the young people who keep this matryoshka world alive.\n\nAsteroid City platforms kid geniuses; junior stargazers and kid witches and aliens. Anderson has never ignored the next generation—The Royal Tenenbaums is about the children left behind; Moonrise Kingdom would be nothing without those running away—but in this one, they lead, and I’m keen to hear how the young ensemble went with the responsibility.\n\n“When you have young people in a movie, because they don’t have as much experience, they sometimes don’t have as much wisdom. Some gain wisdom, but not everyone,” Anderson says, while I worry. But then: “But young people do, I think, possibly, technically, have better brains.”\n\nThe filmmaker recalls an incident with Grace Edwards, an Anderson newcomer playing Junior Stargazer Dinah Campbell, daughter to Scarlett Johansson’s Midge Campbell, as a moment of reflection that made him wonder how he really directs anyone. “I was caught off guard, because Grace was fifteen and she would be very quick to say, ‘Are you sure about that?’ about something I would say,” Anderson recalls. “But I began to realize that when she said that, it was because I was contradicting something she’d already been told was the plan, which came from me.”\n\nHe adds of his young stars: “When everybody is given a script, the young people will know it utterly. When something’s going on on the set, whether it involves them or not, they seem to know the movie the best, and can always guide us. Young people tend to be the most prepared, and they know what the important points are. I love working with young people.”\n\nWe chat about Ryan’s body language, the way his mannerisms between different film roles are uncannily recognisable (“He has this thing where he goes like this,” Anderson says, clicking his thumbs and pulling up finger guns. “It’s almost, I think, a condition.”). So much of an actor’s allure is in how they move, but Ryan, like many of the Junior Stargazers, really surprised Anderson on this one.\n\n“He’s a better actor than I knew he was,” Anderson says. “I knew he was someone who had an interesting face and voice. But then we had a scene with Scarlett Johansson on the train, where there was more than one option for who gets that scene. The instant I looked at Jake in the reading I just thought, ‘Oh, wow, he’s a real actor.’ He did everything I wanted with that scene—he was better than I intended it to be.”\n\nAsteroid City is fueled by young geniuses, but their elders still steer the spaceship; wounded, mournful grown-ups trying to figure out how to put one foot in front of the other when it feels like a whole town of rubble has fallen on your shoulders. There’s Schwartzman as war photographer Augie Steenbeck (my heart sang when I watched him fussing over his developing prints; I have made sure to pack my Polaroid camera today). There’s Johansson as Marilyn Monroesque starlet Midge Campbell, Stephen Park and Hope Davis as parents to geniuses, Maya Hawke as the even littler geniuses’ school teacher, motel manager Steve Carell, scientist Tilda Swinton, general Jeffrey Wright and tons more.\n\nFirst, there’s what Hanks signed up for: “We have some peculiar methods of how we do the movies,” Anderson says. “We don’t have trailers, we bring the costumes to the people’s rooms where they sleep, we all live in one place together. They come to the set already ready, and there’s nobody else there. There isn’t any kind of rehearsal period before the cameras are in place, they arrive, and we start doing the movie. It’s a great thing, when someone who has done every version of making a movie, says, ‘I’m totally open. I’m on board for everything you’re doing, and I’m happy.’ That’s what we had with Tom Hanks.”\n\nAnd then there’s what you get when you sign Hanks: “Sometimes the best direction I can give is to just not say anything, because so many times I’m watching the dailies, and I can hear me give the direction that ruins it,” says the director, laughing at the way he knows his hyper-controlled sets sound anything but left to chance. Still: “Every take after I’ve interfered, I’ve messed up somebody who was on a path and they’re now trying to do what I want, but it doesn’t suit them.” But Hanks? He belongs to the category of actors that Anderson—who at this point has dealt with almost every category of actor, including “actors playing actors”—likes best.\n\n“Some actors, you can’t hurt them,” Anderson says. “You can say what you want, and they can use it. He’s somebody who, whatever you say, he says”—Anderson imitates Hanks’ thumbs-up—“‘Got it, I should have thought of that.’ It is fun to work with actors who want to be directed where it helps them, and it’s not always the case. I’ve had great actors where I know that the best thing I can do is the least.”\n\nAnderson pays “just slight homage” to a scene in Robert Wise’s The Day the Earth Stood Still, in which armed humans point guns at the humanoid visitor, Klaatu. (“All the men have guns, which is a special American thing,” the director notes. “You don’t really find that in other countries during peacetime.”) Klaatu is shot several times during his attempts to warn Earthlings about their nuclear proliferation. “The alien has the ability to heal, but he cannot convince them to reduce their fear and to control their fear enough to welcome him in any way.”\n\nAnderson’s extraterrestrial is pretty laid-back but speaks to much of the film’s sentimental ambition. As General Grif Gibson, “Jeffrey Wright considers that he might need to kill this alien, but the alien is careful, he’s cautious,” says Anderson. “Our alien ultimately isn’t going to do much. He’s there to show us he exists, and that he has meaning and he’s more like some part of a poem, I think.”\n\nYou could imagine that poem being read aloud by Goldblum, who is credited as The Alien in Asteroid City, despite the scenes featuring the alien in fact starring animator Kim Keukeleire. She has worked on Anderson’s Isle Of Dogs and Fantastic Mr. Fox, as well as Claude Barras’ lovely My Life As A Zucchini and Guillermo del Toro’s Oscar-winning Pinocchio.\n\nAnderson explains Keukeleire was playing the puppet as Goldblum: “Not imitating a performance he’d given, even though we did film him doing all sorts of things. The movie has so much to do with actors, performing, the emotions of just playing on the stage and so on, that I liked that our alien is an alien. But he’s also Jeff Goldblum.”\n\nSo Wes and Freya watched it together, and everything changed. “She became totally fixated on it,” he says. “Everything is Star Wars. I have to train her to be a Jedi, each day we do practice.” Anderson can see in his daughter’s eyes exactly what’s going on, and there’s no human way of fighting it. As for so many filmmakers around him, George Lucas’s space odyssey is the key to it all. “I don’t know if I would have ended up wanting to do this if I hadn’t seen Star Wars,” he says. “It’s not even the kind of movie that I became interested in doing, but it certainly made me want to go into these movies, these cinemas, and sit there.”\n\nSomething shifts in his eyes, then—in the way Augie’s so often do in Asteroid City when looking at his three little daughters and teenage son, trying to understand how to help them grow with and without him. “If you’re my age, you start to see time and these cycles quite differently,” says Anderson. “It’s a very strange thing. Some decades from now, you’ll have the experience of seeing somebody grow up around you. It’s odd.”\n\nHis words make me think of a particularly moving review of Asteroid City, in which Brooke Burns writes: “Uncertainty and unknowns can create a well of loneliness but that doesn’t mean you have to stay there. You can keep going because life is still happening here and now. Grieving time isn’t a new sentiment, but it does remind us to hold onto the ones around us and the moments we get with them. I am feeling lucky, even when I don’t understand. Especially watching this with my favorite people.”\n\nToday, Anderson’s name is very much cinema shorthand for a certain kind of singular aesthetic; for many cinephiles who have grown up with his work, he was there first. But Wes is all too aware of the history that precedes him and the generations looking up to him; as such, he readily and happily owes much to the 20th-century Indian filmmaker, illustrator, composer and lyricist Satyajit Ray, a longtime inspiration.\n\n“When you make a movie, people think, ‘Oh, you pay homage to this,’ but I am never deliberately paying homage,” he says. “I’m always stealing from a movie to try to make my movie better. But I like it when I can then tell people what I stole from. And they say, ‘Well, I’m gonna look at that.’”\n\nI need to know which of his beloved Ray’s films the director looted for Asteroid City. Anderson credits a specific moment: A memory game at the heart of the film sees the Junior Stargazers showing off just how many names they can remember, speaking to their stubborn charm and desire to connect in the only way they know how. “We stole that absolutely wholesale from Satyajit Ray, from Days And Nights in the Forest. It’s a great movie,” he says. “If that movie had a genre, it would be whatever genre The Darjeeling Limited is in. These guys get in a car and go off somewhere together, and they discover things.”\n\nAnderson himself is almost ready to go off somewhere: a Cannes photo call with his film family, where he’ll add a matching pinstripe jacket to his outfit. But first, he politely sits for my tiny photo-call-of-one. The filmmaker blinks as the Polaroid flashes. I count him down for another. We’ve got it."
