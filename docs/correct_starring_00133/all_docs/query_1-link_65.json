        "text": "Sixteen years since the events of Clerks 2, we pick up with Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) still sitting behind the tills at the famous Quick Stop, and though they now co-own the Quick Stop, things don't seem to be going well for our now middle-aged clerks. Dante finds it impossible to get over the loss of his wife, Becky (Rosario Dawson). Though Randal and Dante own the store in which they're working, and Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) now sell weed from their video-store-turned-dispensary next door rather than from in front of the Quick Stop, they all still seem to be stuck in a state of perpetual arrested development. When Randal has a heart attack, however, he calls on Dante and the rest of the gang to help him make a black-and-white, independent film revolving around the one thing he knows best: life at the Quick Stop.\n\nKevin Smith's career has been, to say the least, very much all over the place. He started, of course, as one of the most respected and beloved filmmakers of the 1990s. But after seemingly capping off his \"View Askew\" series of films with Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back in 2001, his next two decades as a writer/director have been, in short, a total dumpster fire. Alternating between unnecessary dips back into the \"View Askewverse\" with often more experimental standalone films, almost every movie he released since (and including) Jersey Girl in 2003 was either rubbished by the critics or ignored by audiences – and usually both. Frankly, it is a wonder that he hasn't given up making films years ago.\n\nAll the more so because whether writing comic books, directing episodes of his favourite DC superhero shows, and, most crucially, becoming arguably THE pop-culture commentator of the 21st century with various podcasts, YouTube videos and public appearances, it's hard to imagine that the negligible rewards were ever worth the effort of making his own films over these past couple of decades.\n\nI, for one, remain a fan of Smith's early films (though I am rather afraid to go back and rewatch them), but these days, I am very much more of a fan of the man himself than his work. Not only does Kevin Smith seem like a genuinely good dude, but his passion for all things geeky is infectious. He's no critic, of course, as he seems to adore the hell out of everything he talks about, but there are few people on the planet who I'd rather hear wax lyrical about all things pop culture than him.\n\nSo, when Clerks III was announced, I was – well, let's just say I was much more interested in having Smith show up on Seth Myers or Stephen Colbert to talk about the film than the film itself. And, unsurprisingly, his appearances on these talk shows while promoting the film was a total blast and were indeed – spoiler – much funnier than anything in Clerks III.\n\nI was definitely going to watch it. How could I not? Though I only discovered the original Clerks in the very late '90s, some five years after its release and a semi-generation apart (yup, I'm a \"xennial\"), it meant a lot to me and was, in many ways, my gateway into dialogue-heavy, independent (or at least independently-spirited) films, so there was no way that I wasn't going to check out what was billed as the final film in the Clerks story. And I have certainly loved the short-lived Clerks animated show and, yeah, even some Clerks comics in my day.\n\nPlus, even if Clerks II is middling in the extreme and a poor follow-up to such a ground-breaking original (despite the addition of the always luminous Rosario Dawson), it does have sentimental value for me. My review of it was my very first to be published professionally – in, as it happens, a sadly short-lived local movie magazine.\n\nClerks III, as it turns out, actually has a lot going for it. Well, a lot going for it, that is, if you try and pretend it's not a comedy.\n\nIt's astonishing that while Kevin Smith is a naturally funny person, you wouldn't know it from either the painfully unfunny Jay and Silent Bob Reboot or from Clerks III. Admittedly, with more constrained roles here, Jay and Silent Bob themselves actually fare an awful lot better than they did in their last film and are responsible for most of the film's funnier moments, but Smith's rediscovery of what makes his signature duo funny sadly doesn't extend to most of the rest of the cast – or the rest of the film. There are some cameos that do raise a titter, it's true, but having actual professional actors and funny people (I won't spoil who) raise more giggles in 30 seconds of screen time than most of the actual cast of the film do in 100 minutes only drives home how much of a comedic miss the whole thing is.\n\nFor a start, the signature banter between Dante and Randal is beyond stale at this point. Yes, a part of the point of the film is that the characters themselves recognise this, but that doesn't change how leaden it all feels. That it now reminds me of Smith's godawful reality TV show, Comic Book Men – a show that is apparently based entirely on the idea of proving general conceptions about comic book stores right – certainly doesn't help, either. The Comic Book Men themselves actually do reprise their roles as Dante and Randal's hockey friends, but they are thankfully kept to being nostalgic visual Easter eggs, with nary a line of actual dialogue uttered between them.\n\nThe worst offenders of all in the film's affront to all things comedic, though, is Trevor Fehrman as Dante and Randal's protégé, Elias, who was introduced in Clerks II to similarly groan-worthy effect. I hate to pick on someone who is, for all intents and purposes, not really an actor (his last film credit was, would you believe it, Clerks II!), but that's true of virtually everyone in the proper cast, and none of them is anywhere near as awful as he is.\n\nMind you, this is more Smith's fault than Fehrman's because while the rest of the amateur cast are given roles that they can pull off well enough - sometimes more than well enough - Smith decided to rest most of the film's alleged comedy on someone who has all the comedic timing of a funeral. His whole subplot of being this evangelical Christian turned Evangelical Satanist after he believes that Satan, not Jesus, saved Randal from his heart attack runs throughout the film and it's horribly written and horribly performed stuff that almost single-handedly tanks the entire enterprise.\n\nIt doesn't, though, because however much Clerks III fails as a comedy, overall, it works both at using nostalgia to genuinely impressive effect and at being a very, very moving character-driven film about two men facing an existential crisis as their fifties approach and death hovers over them. The final forty minutes or so of the film, in fact, turn from being an outright comedy into a drama with some comedic moments thrown in to punctuate it (and these comedic moments land far better than almost anything in the preceding hour), and it's wonderfully truthful, emotional stuff that will resonate especially strongly with all of us who discovered Clerks in our late teens/early twenties back when the film had real cultural cache.\n\nRosario Dawson, who's around less this time for plot-related reasons, still manages to help things along a lot in some pivotal moments. Real credit has to go to Smith himself for seriously upping his dramatic chops as a writer and director. Still, I especially can't say enough good things about Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran as Randal and Dante, respectively. Again, we're dealing with two actors who aren't exactly what anyone would call A-list (though O'Halloran actually has some 52 credits to his name and Anderson a quite respectable 19), but they both bring raw emotional clout to their roles this time around and easily manage to sell everything that Smith throws at them.\n\nSo, yes, Clerks III is a bit of an unfunny mess, and it often highlights Smith's weaknesses as a filmmaker (Randal's heart attack plays out pretty much exactly like Smith's own, but his recounting of it in interviews is funnier and more compelling than it is in the film) but when it works, it really, really works. Those who aren't familiar with Clerks need not apply, but it's a must for those of us who have been with Dante and Randal from the beginning (or near enough), and frankly, it wouldn't be a half-bad way for Smith himself to bow out of filmmaking, should he choose to do so."
