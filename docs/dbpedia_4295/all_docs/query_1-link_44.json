        "text": "Why should I learn Japanese on AmazingTalker?\n\nAmazingTalker’s one-on-one Japanese tutors are suitable for everyone who wants to learn Japanese efficiently and effectively. We have professional Japanese tutors for toddlers, small children, older kids, middle and high school students, and adults of all levels, including tutors for beginner, intermediate and advanced Japanese language classes.\n\nOur Japanese tutoring services can help you to improve in all aspects of the language - listening, writing, reading, speaking, pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary. You can also customize your study focus (for example, a business Japanese program). Whether your goal is to improve your Japanese conversation skills for fun, prepare for a test or speak more fluently at work, AmazingTalker’s Japanese tutors are here to help.\n\nHow much do Japanese sessions cost?\n\nOn average, Japanese sessions cost $10 - $30 per hour. However, rates vary by tutor’s nationality, experience and popularity. Check out the Japanese session rates in your country.\n\nHow do I find the right Japanese tutor?\n\nYou can browse tutor profiles to get a better idea of their background and specialties, and whether they meet your needs. You can also start with top tutors rated by our students, or use our tutor recommendation tool.\n\nCan I find high-quality Japanese tutors at reasonable prices?\n\nCertainly! You can find a great tutor within your budget. Here is a list of professional Japanese tutors at lower prices.\n\nWho are our Japanese tutors?\n\nAmazingTalker handpicks only the best local and international Japanese tutors.\n\nEach prospective instructor must undergo a rigorous selection process before becoming an AT Japanese tutor, after which their performance is constantly monitored. Try a class and start learning today.\n\nHow do I find a Japanese tutor?\n\nIf you want to find a Japanese tutor near you and you have a clear idea of your criteria for choosing one - such as any learning objectives, target cost for Japanese tutoring, etc. - you can use the search function to find a Japanese tutor near you who suits your needs. You can then contact the tutor or book a trial class to start your learning adventure.\n\nHowever, if you're not sure where to start, we're here to help. Try using our tutor recommendation system, and you'll automatically get matched with Japanese tutors who fit your criteria!\n\nWhat's the best learning environment for me? Should I choose a native speaker as my Japanese tutor?\n\nOne of the best ways to learn Japanese is to immerse yourself in an environment where you try to use only Japanese.\n\nHowever, if you do not currently have a solid base in spelling and/or vocabulary, we recommend you choose a bilingual tutor who speaks your target language and your native language, as you will likely have a better learning experience during your one-on-one private tutoring.\n\nIf you have a good range of vocabulary but lack the opportunity to practice, then we recommend you choose a native Japanese coach.\n\nWhere can I learn Japanese near me?\n\nYou can start learning Japanese with an online Japanese tutor from home now! For local instructors, our platform makes it easy to find Japanese tutors serving your area.\n\nWhen can I learn Japanese with Japanese tutors online?\n\nIn terms of scheduling, you can set up your lessons for whenever is convenient. You can set up classes with your private Japanese tutor for the morning, afternoon, evening or late night in your time zone. If you don't have much availability during the week, we have Japanese tutors available on weekends as well.\n\nHow much is the cost per hour?\n\nAll fees and tuition are set by the Japanese tutors themselves, not by AT. For reference, most of our tutors charge roughly USD$10-30 per hour.\n\nHow do I pay for the cost of learning Japanese?\n\nYou can pay with PayPal or credit card (American Express, Mastercard, or Visa). For certain international markets (e.g. Taiwan), we also accept local methods of payment, such as payment via ATM or convenience store.\n\nWhat makes AmazingTalker unique?\n\nWith AmazingTalker, you can work with high-quality Japanese tutors at affordable prices from the convenience of your own home, while getting customized learning plans and 1-on-1 attention.\n\nUnlike many other online language learning platforms, AmazingTalker believes that the best way to learn Japanese is by working with real native speakers and tutors. Regardless of which of our 60+ languages or topics you want to focus on, we believe that the way you learn should be designed for your needs and goals.\n\nWhat if I want to become an online Japanese teacher at AmazingTalker?\n\nIf you're interested in becoming an online Japanese teacher, please visit our \"apply to teach\" page. At AmazingTalker, you can teach on your own schedule and set your own rates.\n\nWhat if I have more questions?\n\nOur FAQs section here should have answers to most of your questions. If you can't find answers to your question in the FAQs, you can find more information or contact us by clicking the red question mark icon on the bottom right of your screen."
