Sections of note include:\n\nThe capitalization of a trust company shall not be less than $200,000 pursuant to SDCL 51A-6A-19.\n\nA fidelity bond and director's and officer's liability insurance policy coverage of at least $1,000,000 each are required pursuant to SDCL 51A-6A-19.\n\nA deposit pledged to the Division shall not be less than $100,000 pursuant to SDCL 51A-6A-19.\n\nA South Dakota-chartered trust company is subject to an annual supervisory fee computed at the rate of seven cents per $10,000 of total trust assets under management, administration, or custody as reported as of the end of December. The minimum annual fee is $3,750 and the maximum annual fee is $20,000 for private trust companies, while the minimum annual fee is $4,500 and the maximum annual fee is $30,000 for public trust companies. In addition, trust companies shall pay the actual cost for each on-site examination and the additional supervision costs for any trust company operating under an enforcement action. These fees are pursuant to ARSD 20:07:22:01.\n\nSDCL 51A-06A-11.1, SDCL 51A-6A-11.2, and SDCL 51A-6A-11.3 establishes jurisdiction criteria needed to establish South Dakota situs.\n\nPublic Trust Company Mandates\n\nPrivate Trust Company Mandates\n\nTrust Company Examination Procedures\n\n-back to top-\n\nFinancial Institution Tax\n\nSouth Dakota chartered trust companies are defined as a financial institution pursuant SDCL 10-43-1, which imposes a net-income-based tax on South Dakota sitused financial institutions. However, SDCL 10-43-90 imposes a minimum financial institution tax on South Dakota chartered trust companies. The minimum financial institution tax applied to South Dakota chartered trust companies is tiered over the first five years of operation. The annual minimum tax is $500 for fewer than 12 months of operation; $2,000 for over 12 months but less than 24 months of operation; $5,000 for over 24 months but less than 36 months of operation; $10,000 for over 36 months but fewer than 48 months of operation; and $25,000 annually after 48 months.\n\n-back to top-\n\nSupervisory Guidance\n\nThe following guidance is generally derived from best business practices utilized by South Dakota-regulated financial institutions to mitigate business and fiduciary risks. The examination process is structured to assess each institution’s risk management processes and to assist management in addressing any areas of identified weaknesses. Examination observations regularly reference supervisory guidance to provide management with examples of sound risk management practices and to assist with corresponding risk mitigation. While examinations do not cite violations of supervisory guidance, deviations from the guidance could heighten the institution’s overall risk profile which may negatively impact regulatory assessments. Please note that the supervisory guidance is general in nature and designed to assist management with developing a comprehensive risk management program. Therefore, the guidance should be modified as needed to correspond with each institution’s unique business model.\n\nAccount-Level Administrative Review Guidance\n\nAccount-Level Investment Review Guidance\n\nBank Secrecy Act Guidance\n\nCustomer Identification Guidance\n\nDue Diligence Review Guidance\n\nFiduciary and Related Services Report Instructions\n\nForeign Trust Acceptance and Oversight Guidance\n\nForeign Trust Taxation and Reporting Guidance\n\nInternal Audit Guidance\n\nInterstate Trust Guidance\n\nInvestment Policy Guidance\n\nPooled Investment Guidance\n\nReal Estate Oversight Guidance\n\nRegulation R Guidance\n\nStatement of Principles of Trust Management\n\nStatement of Principles of Trust Management - Custodial\n\nWritten Policies and Procedures Guidance\n\n-back to top-\n\nLegislative Updates and Memorandums\n\n10-001 Situs Clarification (November 20, 2001)\n\n10-002 Regulation R (July 9, 2010)\n\n10-003 Bank Secrecy Act (June 6, 2011)\n\n10-004 Interstate Trust Guidance (April 3, 2015)\n\n10-005 Interstate Trust Guidance Addendum (October 13, 2015)\n\n10-006 Office Space Reminder (June 30, 2017)\n\n10-007 Pandemic Planning (March 23, 2020)\n\n10-008 FinCEN Final Rule dated September 15, 2020 (January 5, 2021)\n\n20-002 New Trust Legislation (June 6, 2008)\n\n20-004 New Trust Legislation (April 26, 2007)\n\n20-005 New Trust Legislation (June 12, 2009)\n\n20-007 New Trust Legislation (June 8, 2010)\n\n20-008 New Trust Legislation (June 23, 2011)\n\n20-009 New Trust Legislation (June 8, 2012)\n\n20-010 New Trust Legislation (October 22, 2012)\n\n20-011 New Trust Legislation (June 10, 2013)\n\n20-012 New Trust Legislation (June 12, 2014)\n\n20-013 Situs Reminder (June 12, 2014)\n\n20-014 New Trust Legislation (June 19, 2015)\n\n20-015 New Trust Legislation (July 8, 2016)\n\n20-021 New Trust Legislation (June 30, 2017)\n\n20-023 New Trust Legislation (June 15, 2018)\n\n20-024 New Trust Legislation (June 19, 2019)\n\n20-027 New Trust Legislation (June 3, 2020)\n\n20-028 New Trust Legislation (June 10, 2021)\n\n10-009 Special Purpose Entity Oversight Guidance (July 8, 2022)\n\n10-010 FinCEN Consent Order (May 5, 2023)\n\nback to top\n\nContact Information"
