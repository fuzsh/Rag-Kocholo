        "text": "Choose A Facility:\n\nJohn Lance Arena/Whetzel Court\n\nChampions Club Rental (2019-20)\n\nThe Pittsburg State University men's and women's basketball and volleyball teams make their home in John Lance Arena, which is housed in the Garfield Weede Building.\n\nJohn Lance Arena is named in honor of legendary head coach John Lance, who won 582 games during his illustrious career at Pittsburg State and 656 games overall.\n\nLance, a candidate for enshrinement into the College Basketball Hall of Fame, led the Gorillas to an amazing 47 consecutive victories during one stretch of his 40-year tenure that spanned from 1923 until 1963. PSU was 20-0 during the 1929-30 campaign and 21-0 the following year. The streak finally ended in the seventh game of the 1931-32 season when the Gorillas were defeated by Henry Iba’s Northwest Missouri State University squad, 20-18.\n\nIn the spring of 2010, the hardwood and track in John Lance Arena was taken up and renovations on the facility began. Wall-to-wall maple hardwood was installed in the arena, providing three main courts to allow the men's and women's basketball teams and volleyball to practice all at the same time if necessary. Up to four courts can be utilized for summer camps for all three teams. Chairback seating was installed on the north and south ends of the arena, as well as in the mezzanine area. The new court was dedicated on January 5, 2013 and named in honor of PSU benefactors, Alan and Roberta Whetzel, who gave the lead gift that allowed the renovations to happen.\n\nIn addition, the Whetzel Family Mezzanine opened. The Whetzel Family Mezzanine houses the Champions Club, offices overlooking the court for the head volleyball and men's and women's basketball coaches, a state of the art video control room and a conference room, which is also used for post-game press conferences. Fans can rent out the Champions Club on a game-by-game basis by contacting the athletic department.\n\nMen's Basketball\n\nThe Gorilla men truly have built a decisive home court advantage in John Lance Arena by posting a 139-56 (.712) record on the court during the past 15 seasons. Pittsburg State won a school record 40 straight games in “The Pitt,” before losing a heartbreaker, 76-74, to Truman State University in the semifinals of the MIAA Tournament on February 24, 1999.\n\nThe Gorilla men have ranked among the top 30 schools in NCAA Division II for home-court attendance in 12 of the last 14 seasons, including a top 10 national ranking in 2011. The Pitt State men have averaged 1,984 fans in their last 191 home games and 2,373 fans in their 132 MIAA home games (regular season & post season) in the last 14 years.\n\nPittsburg State began play at John Lance Arena during the 1971-72 season. The Gorillas posted a 69-67 victory against Missouri Southern State University in the first game played on the John Lance Arena hardwood on Dec. 4, 1971. The PSU men have compiled a 378-179 (.679) overall record in the facility.\n\nHome floor success has been strong throughout the history of the PSU program. Prior to John Lance Arena, the Gorillas played 49 seasons in College Gymnasium, located between the present site of Yates Hall and the Jack Overman Student Center. During those years (1923-71), PSU posted a 394-130 (.752) record in the facility. Prior to that time, PSU posted a 50-31 (.617) home record between 1909-22.
