In order to maintain and extend this high quality of leisure services to an ever-growing population base, the preparation of this Leisure Services Master Plan is a requirement of the Michigan DNR to be eligible for any potential grant funding available through the DNR.\n\nThis plan identifies the demand for new leisure activities, condition, and location of and utilization of existing parks and facilities, and the potential opportunity to embark on a community-wide comprehensive green ways program to link subdivisions and neighborhoods, and parks and facilities together to form a cohesive recreation and leisure services complex.
