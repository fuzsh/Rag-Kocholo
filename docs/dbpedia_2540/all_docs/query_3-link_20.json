        "text": "The Trusts Arena is owned and operated by a Charitable Trust (Waitakere City Stadium Trust) that operates the Arena’s facilities with a community heart and commercial westy_wavedisciplines. We are continually looking for ways to support future development of the Arena and support the community use of the Arena at heavily discounted rates for our community. Should you wish to support the Arena in any way please get in contact with our CEO.\n\nThe Waitakere City Stadium Trust (the Arena’s owner/operator) has enjoyed the support of several funding agencies, friends and supporters none more significant than our two key funding partners that have each invested several million into the facilities on site:\n\n‘The Trusts’ in West Auckland (Portage and Waitakere Licensing Trusts) are independent, democratically elected, socially responsible organisations. They are owned by the people, for the benefit of the community. Completely independent of local councils, they have one purpose only: to raise money through business and gaming and give it back to the community. There are no private investors or shareholders and no dividends to pay out. Just grants and donations to distribute to communities. The Trusts’ commercial ventures include selling alcohol, food, accommodation, refreshments and operating gaming machines. The Trusts Charitable Foundation (TTCF) holds the Operators Licence for gaming machines located in Portage and Waitakere Trust outlets and ‘The Trusts’ hold the Venue Licence."
