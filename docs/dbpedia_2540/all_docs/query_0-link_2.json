The Arena was developed by the Waitakere City Stadium Trust in partnership with Waitakere City Council and The Trusts and aims to be an icon for Waitakere City, a place for the community to gather and enjoy a wide range of cultural, community, sporting and corporate events. The Waitakere City Stadium Trust (the Arena's owner/operator) maintains a strong focus on being an icon for Waitakere City and a \"hub\" for our community. The economic and social returns provide ongoing benefits for our community. Commercial activity and key funding partnerships with The Trusts and Waitakere City Council keep the stadium doors open to our community at heavily subsidised rates. Each year over 600,000 people from across the country descend on the Arena for a variety of events, over half of these people are local people here to play sport and attend community arts and recreation events. We pride ourselves on the fact that over 51% of all visits to the stadium are locals and less than 6% of income is derived from this. We believe we have the most versatile, and available community facility in the country, staffed by the best people who all live and love West Auckland. We look forward to seeing you at an exciting range of community and commercial events and a host of sporting and recreation opportunities that we have planned in the future.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttps://thetrustsarena.co.nz/\n\nExternal link for The Trusts Arena\n\nIndustry\n\nSpectator Sports\n\nCompany size\n\n11-50 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nAuckland\n\nType\n\nNonprofit\n\nFounded\n\n2005"
