        "text": "About\n\nFrom 2011-2013, AMALIE Arena had more than $62 million in improvements that have clearly revolutionized the industry and made it the premier entertainment venue in the state of Florida.\n\nWith a wide array of venues spread throughout the United States, it can be difficult to find one that distinguishes itself from the others. That is not the case with the renovated AMALIE Arena, Florida’s premier entertainment venue and home of the three-time Stanley Cup champions, Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nBoasting unique features like lightning-throwing Tesla coils, the 11,000 square-foot Budweiser Biergarten with incredible views of the city and a massive five-manual, 105-rank digital pipe organ, AMALIE Arena consistently ranks among the very best venues in the United States. The best part? This is only the beginning.\n\nA new era in Tampa Bay has arrived and it’s time you be a part of it. Our owners are committed to providing fans with a world-class experience at every game, concert and event.\n\nHistory\n\nThe doors to the 670,000-square-foot AMALIE Arena (originally called the Ice Palace) first opened on October 12, 1996 with its first event, the Royal Hanneford Circus. The Circus was followed shortly thereafter by the first Lightning game played on October 20, 1996. The Lightning won 5-2 over the New York Rangers.\n\nThe arena has hosted numerous high-profile events including the 1999 NHL All-Star Game, the 2007 ACC Men’s Basketball Tournament, the 2008 NCAA Women’s Final Four, the 2009 SEC Men’s Basketball Tournament, the 2012 Republican National Convention, the 2012 NCAA Men's Frozen Four and more.\n\nIn 2002, the building was renamed from the Ice Palace to the St. Pete Times Forum as part of a new partnership with the St. Petersburg Times.\n\nFrom 2011-2013, the publicly-owned AMALIE Arena underwent a $62 million transformation that was privately funded by Tampa Bay Sports and Entertainment owner and chairman, Jeff Vinik.\n\nOn December 31, 2011 the St. Petersburg Times changed its name to the Tampa Bay Times, and the arena was unveiled as the Tampa Bay Times Forum to follow suit.\n\nIn August 2014, local Tampa Bay Company AMALIE Oil entered an agreement for the naming rights to the arena.\n\nPlease Note: By clicking on any of the links on this page you may be leaving our website and entering a third-party website over which we have no control."
