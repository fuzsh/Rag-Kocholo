        "text": "PHOTO GALLERY\n\nHistory\n\nDonald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium (DWRRS), following a major expansion and renovation project completed prior to the 2001 season, gives the University of Arkansas one of the finest football facilities in the nation.\n\nThe $110 million project, which included a $20 million gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, saw the capacity of the stadium increased from 51,000 to 72,000.\n\nThe concrete and steel below the stands were completely enclosed with a brick and glass facade. In addition to covering the steel and concrete, the concourses are wider and concession areas and restrooms were replaced.\n\nThe east concourse is “Championship Alley” with displays of conference championships, the 1964 national title and every football letterman. The south end zone concourse is “All-American Alley” and is dedicated to Razorback All-Americans. The west concourse is “Bowl Alley” with tributes to each bowl team.\n\nOther than the facade covering, the other most noticeable addition was the enclosure of the south end zone, which features chairback seating and the addition of approximately 7,300 total seats with space for an additional upper deck that would push the capacity to 80,000. The enclosure also includes a food court with space for five vendors.\n\nStadium Facts\n\nCAPACITY FIRST GAME DEDICATED DWRRS RECORD FAYETTEVILLE RECORD 72,000 Sept. 24, 1938 Arkansas 27, Oklahoma A&M 7 Oct. 8, 1938 168-84-2 (.665) 288-117-10 (.706)"
