As a result of their financial gift, First Bank & Trust will also hold the naming rights for the new venue.\n\n“We couldn’t be prouder to continue our partnership with First Bank & Trust. First Bank & Trust has meant so much to the university, the community, the state, and the region,” said SDSU Athletic Director Justin Sell. “To enhance the footprint of the Stanley J Marshall Center and create a first-class facility for our student-athletes, coach, and fans is incredibly exciting.”\n\nFrost Arena, which was named after former SDSU AD and basketball coach Jack Frost, opened in 1973. It’s currently home to the wrestling, volleyball, and men’s and women’s basketball teams of SDSU.\n\nFrost Arena’s current capacity is around 6,500. With new premium seating areas, suites, and a larger concourse, the venue capacity of First Bank & Trust Arena will drop to around 5,500.\n\nThe renovation process will take around two years, but because it’ll be done in increments, teams won’t have to relocate to an alternate venue while construction takes place."
