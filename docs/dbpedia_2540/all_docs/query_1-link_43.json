        "text": "Since cave paintings and prehistoric sculptures, art has served as a medium to capture emotions and convey feelings.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, with emotions overflowing and feelings scattered, musicians had the large task of making sure the nationâ€™s wide-ranging attitudes towards the tragedy would live on forever.\n\nAt the time, major media companies like Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) urged its 1,100+ radio stations not to play over 150 songs due to potentially offensive material.\n\nBut despite occasional media censorship, these 10 artists managed to capture the countryâ€™s diverse feelings around the events of September 11th.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//tHlYLt7Vt2c' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nColdplay, \"Politik\"\n\nAccording to the book Coldplay: Look at the Stars, \"Politik\" was heavily inspired by the September 11 attacks.\n\n\"I wrote the song on 9/11 and we recorded it on 9/13. We were all a little confused and frightened,\" said lead singer Chris Martin. \"I want to write songs and do things, 'cause you never know what might happen. You got to live in the moment.\"\n\n\"Politik\" served as the intro track for the bandâ€™s GRAMMY-winning A Rush Of Blood To The Head'' album. The songâ€™s transcendent production paired with its inquisitive lyrics reflect the nationâ€™s harsh realization of mortality after 9/11.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//AeHzHNGdLAU' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n50 Cent ft. Eminem, \"Patiently Waiting\"\n\nDespite the song mainly focusing on their respective rivals, both 50 Cent and Eminem incorporated memorable lines about the September 11 attacks on the 2003 track \"Patiently Waiting\".\n\n\"I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead, destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11,\" 50 Cent raps on his opening verse.\n\nWhile the line may catch some off guard on first listen, 50 Cent is essentially stating the innocence of the 9/11 attack victims who lost their lives.\n\nEminem conveys the shared feeling of how close to home the attacks hit with his line, \"Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers.\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//QsZlY0Vz4-o' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nJay-Z ft. Alicia Keys, \"Empire State Of Mind\"\n\nFollowing 9/11, American patriotism reached new heights. At the center of the countryâ€™s newfound patriotism was the site of the initial attacks, New York City.\n\nJay-Zâ€™s and Alicia Keysâ€™ \"Empire State Of Mind\" perfectly captured the love and pride the nation shared with New York. \"Long live the World Trade,\" raps the 23-time GRAMMY winner on his second verse.\n\nThe New York-centric track went on to earn two GRAMMYs at the 53rd GRAMMYs for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Rap Song.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//K1u5VjSx3jg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nHeems, \"Flag Shopping\"\n\nWhile 9/11 turned many Americans to patriotism, it also pushed many to harmful lanes of pride like nationalism and racism.\n\nHeems, an American rapper of Punjabi-Indian descent, touches on how he and his family unfairly faced backlash after the September 11 attacks.\n\n\"I know why they mad, but why call us A-rabs?\" he raps on \"Flag Shopping.\" \"We sad like they sad, but now we buy they flags.\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//cJNjpSOiXG8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nSheryl Crow, \"Out of Our Heads\"\n\nReleased in 2008, \"Out of Our Heads\" is an anti-conflict song aimed at the Iraq war.\n\nMany of the lyrics were targeted at U.S. leaders, accusing them of manipulating the nationâ€™s anger following the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\"Someone's feeding on your anger. Someone's been whispering in your ear. You've seen his face before. You've been played before. These aren't the words you need to hear,\" sings Crow.\n\n\"Out of Our Heads\" was released as part of Crowâ€™s 2008 album Detours, which earned a GRAMMY nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 51st GRAMMY Awards.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//mNNzGhzIAVo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nJohn Vanderslice, \"Exodus Damage\"\n\nFor every Sheryl Crow urging peace, there was also a John Vanderslice looking for a way to let out feelings.\n\n\"Saw the second plane hit at 9:02,\" sings Vanderslice at the top of the second verse. \"An hour went by without a fighter in the sky/ You said thereâ€™s a reason why/ Tell me now, I must confess/ Iâ€™m not sick enough to guess.\"\n\nThroughout the song, Vanderslice recounts a conversation with a conspiracy theorist friend on the day of the attacks and questions why the nationâ€™s leaders didnâ€™t immediately respond with force.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//0-cpL--0AQA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nJadakiss, \"Why\"\n\nIf the songâ€™s title didnâ€™t give it away, Jadakiss questions a lot of agreed-upon narratives in \"Why\".\n\nOf the 100 or so inquiries in the song, one was a famous conspiracy theory centered around then-president George W. Bushâ€™s supposed role in the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\"Why did Bush knock down the towers?\" he demands on the popular track. The track was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 47th GRAMMY Awards.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//xJinRZkANVs' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nDream Theater, \"Sacrificed Sons\"\n\n\"Sacrificed Sons\" opens with a combination of news station soundbites from September 11th before Dream Theater delivers an emotional remembrance to all the lost lives.\n\n\"Burning City, smoke and fire, planes, we're certain, faith-inspired,\" questions the two-time GRAMMY-nominated band. \"No clues, a complete surprise. Who'll be coming home tonight?\"\n\nLyrics by James LaBrie, \"Sacrificed Sons\" captures the nationâ€™s confusion, surprise and grief across 10 minutes.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//ylt1ZqPZYOc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nBruce Springsteen, \"Into The Fire\"\n\n\"Into the Fire\" recounts the tragic events of 9/11 from the point of view of a firefighterâ€™s spouse.\n\nWith lyrics like \"love and duty called you some place higher, somewhere up the stairs, into the fire\" and \"may your strength give us strength\", the five-minute track serves as a touching tribute to first responders and their families.\n\n18 years after the songâ€™s 2002 release, Springsteenâ€™s son Sam Springsteen joined the Jersey City Fire Department.\n\nThe tribute was a part of Springsteenâ€™s The Rising album, which won Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Album at the 45th GRAMMY Awards.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//KiO2-R8yKjE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nImagine Dragons, \"America\"\n\nWith lyrics like \"from farmers in the fields, to the tallest of the towers that fall and rise, 1-7-7-6, the names upon the list, for all the ones that gave until they died,\" Imagine Dragonsâ€™ \"America\" captured the resilient nature of the country following the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\"America, donâ€™t you cry,\" the band sings in the chorus. \"Lift me up. Give me strength to press on.\"\n\nIt's The One: 45 Years Of Bruce Springsteen's 'Born To Run'\n\nFor Reynolds, playing live to sold-out arenas and seeing thousands of strangers singing â€” just like writing songs â€” is therapeutic. Sporting a plain white t-shirt, with a rack of guitars behind him, the singer-songwriter discussed navigating change, catharsis, the inspirations behind Loom, and why he makes music today is no different than what led him to penning his first-ever song.\n\n\"Iâ€™m in therapy every week and I have been since I was young,\" says Reynolds, adding that he started writing music at age 12 to handle emotional distress. \"I didnâ€™t know how to say what I was feeling and it wasnâ€™t working by just writing it in a journal. Something about singing those words and putting it over a sonic soundscape felt cathartic. This record was no different and it felt really good.\"\n\nAhead of Loomâ€™s release on June 28, GRAMMY.com chatted with Reynolds via Zoom about the inspirsations behind what he considers the bandâ€™s most colorful record. The 36-year-old melody maker appeared affable, admitted to currently being sober, and that he was excited to hit the road again with his bandmates for a 30-plus date North American tour that begins at the end of July.\n\nA Sense Of Foreboding, Good And Bad\n\nMultiple members of Imagine Dragons threw out names for their new record, Reynolds notes. \"'Loom' just came to me out of nowhere during the filming of our first video. I was like, 'Guys, what do you think?' Within minutes they all loved it.\"\n\nReynolds likes the ideas and connotations that come with such a simple word: that something is coming. \"The word feels ominous, but it can also be positive,\" he explains. \"This record really dives into change as a lot of change was happening in my life when I wrote these songs.\"\n\nBeyond those looming feelings, good and bad, Reynolds says he also loved \"loom\" as a noun. \"Itâ€™s a very colorful record and a loom brings to mind the intertwining of different colors.\"\n\nMattman & Robin\n\nAfter working with Rick Rubin and having several \"cooks in the kitchen\" on the last record, Swedish duo Mattman and Robin (Mattias Per Larsson and Robin Lennart Fredriksson) were the sole studio chefs spearheading this production. The difference is reflected in Loom's finished sound.\n\n\"This record is solely Mattman & Robin and because of that itâ€™s our most cohesive, concise and pointed record,\" Reynolds says. \"For our own sanity, this time we wanted to make a record that told a very specific story and that sounded like a specific color. I believe we accomplished that better than ever before because we worked with only one producer.\"\n\nStarting From Square One\n\nThe creation of the Imagine Dragonsâ€™ sixth album also differed from all their previous projects when it came to the artistic approach and the song-selection process. \"For every other record, I arrived at the studio with 150 or more demos that I had put down over a two-year period,\" Reynolds recalls, adding that the group brought in about 200 demos, selected 70, and recorded 50 during their sessions with Rick Rubin.\n\nWhile Reynolds had about 150 demos this time around, Mattman and Robin suggested that they \"wipe the slate clean, throw out all these demos, and start from square one.\" Reynolds loved the idea, \"because I love to write and Iâ€™m always writing.\"\n\nHe wrote about 30 new songs in the studio over four to six months, and then narrowed those down. \"It was all very collaborative.\"\n\nFeeling Colors\n\nReflecting about the completed record, Reynolds admits that Loom feels like the most up-tempo, concise body of work Imagine Dragonsâ€™ has ever done; itâ€™s also the most colorful.\n\n\"Thatâ€™s the reason we chose the sunset/sunrise artwork for the cover because the image can be perceived either way,\" Reynolds explains. \"The record feels like the beginning of things and also the death of things â€¦ It's all about change. There are definitely more bright songs than any other record weâ€™ve done, but there are also moments of reflection and heartache.\"\n\nReynolds is not one to keep a diary or write notes on his phone. Music is his journal.\n\n\"Iâ€™ve never been a person to write down an idea and then work on that idea,\" the songwriter explains. \"I always write the same way: I sit down at a piano, with a guitar or at a computer with no theme in mind and create a soundscape that is an honest output of whatever Iâ€™m feeling. I then write lyrics and melody to that feeling. Itâ€™s been that same way since I was 12 and started writing songs â€¦ What Iâ€™m feeling in the moment is usually what itâ€™s going to be.\"\n\nThe Beauty & Safety Of Metaphor\n\nEver since Reynolds started processing his emotions through music and penned his first song as a pre-teen, he hid behind metaphors â€” afraid to speak his truth. During these formative years, this truth-telling usually centered on his religious beliefs. Reynolds was raised, along with his nine siblings, as a follower of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Reynolds admits that he relied too heavily on figures of speech as a writer, especially when it came to describing his relationship with Mormonism.\n\nToday, the artist no longer hides behind his words. \"When I started writing, I was fearful of the people I love understanding what I was saying,\" Reynolds explains. \"I was not thinking back then about the common listener; the only ones who heard my music, from the time I was 12 to 14, were my parents and I sure as hell did not want my mom to hear a song and think, â€˜Are you doubting Joseph Smith!â€™\"\n\nReynolds leaned into metaphor. \"so my mom would not know what I was talking about\" â€” and that trajectory continued into his writing style on the first few Imagine Dragons records.\n\n\"When I listen to Night Visions, itâ€™s very metaphorical,\" Reynolds reflects. \"'Radioactive' is a song about depression; yet, most people hear it and think itâ€™s a song about the apocalypse!\"\n\nHowever, some of Reynoldsâ€™ favorite songwriters â€” Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens â€” are not overly metaphorical. Working with Rick Rubin on the previous Imagine Dragons double record really helped the songwriter reduce his reliance on imagery and be more authentic. \"Rick was always telling me to peel back a little bit, become more vulnerable and stop being such a scaredy-cat,\" he says.\n\nMetaphors and deeper meanings aside, Reynolds stresses that while he tries to add some lyricism to his words. What matters most, he notes, is that he sings his truth and itâ€™s believable.\n\nCh-Ch-Ch-Changes\n\nChange is a constant in life and that theme weaves throughout Loom. Like French writer Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr wrote in 1894, \"plus Ã§a change, plus câ€™est la mÃªme chose.\" This aphorism, loosely translated, means the more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\n\"There are some things in my life that never change and Iâ€™ve accepted that,\" Reynolds says. \"One of them is that mental health has always been a bit of a struggle for me, but music helps a lot. At the same time, other things do change. Iâ€™m 36 now and Iâ€™m not the same person I was when we put out our first record and I was 22.\"\n\nThe throughline in Imagine Dragons' sound is \"the human experience told from a self-reflective narrative view,\" Reynolds continues, adding that Loom felt cathartic.\n\nFalse Empowerment\n\nLoomâ€™s first single, \"Eyes Closed,\" arrived May 3. The genre-bending song fuses rap, rock and pop, to create another Imagine Dragons anthem.\n\n\"'Eyes Closed' is about something that looks perfect and idyllic and then you tap it and it falls into a million pieces,\" Reynolds explains. \"The idea behind that song is that I could do this with my eyes closed, itâ€™s so easy, but the reality is I was not really loving myself or feeling any of those things I was writing about.\"\n\nIt's a theme Reynolds revisits often. \"I write a lot of songs because Iâ€™m in a bad place and Iâ€™m trying to bring about a false sense of confidence, security and empowerment,\" he says. \"I meet people and they say, â€˜I work out to this song every morning and it gets my day going,â€™ and I reply, â€˜Iâ€™m glad because I really wasnâ€™t going that day!â€™\"\n\nJay-Z has made more critically beloved albums than Vol. 2 (Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint both fall in that category). He has made albums with bigger hits (The Blueprint 3 had a No. 1 hit with \"Empire State of Mind\"). But he has never made a more important LP.\n\nVol. 2 was the album that made Jay a superstar. Its Annie-sampling title track (produced by the late 45 King) sent him to the stratosphere â€” a process he actually documented on his follow-up album. But the record wasnâ€™t just a commercial novelty. It showed Jay at the absolute top of his game: cocky, funny, and brilliant. Case in point: his novel approach to storytelling in \"Coming of Age (Da Sequel),\" where all the important action takes place in just a few seconds, inside the charactersâ€™ heads.\n\nRead more: Songbook: How Jay-Z Created The 'Blueprint' For Rap's Greatest Of All Time\n\nLudacris - 'Word of Mouf' (2001)\n\nAround the turn of the millennium, Def Jam had its sights set on conquering new territory. Specifically, the South. So they set up Def Jam South and hired Scarface to head it up. The entityâ€™s biggest success came from an Atlanta DJ who went by Chris Luva Luva on the air, but began rapping as Ludacris.\n\nWord of Mouf was Ludaâ€™s second album, but it was the one that really cemented his stardom with songs like \"Rollout (My Business),\" \"Area Codes,\" and the immortal \"Move Bitch\" (the last of which has had an artist-approved second life as a protest chant). The album proved that the South was here to stay, and that Def Jam would have a role in determining its hip-hop future.\n\nLearn more: A Guide To Southern Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From The Dirty South\n\nScarface - 'The Fix' (2002)\n\nSpeaking of Scarface and Def Jam South, Face had no intention of dropping music while running the label. But, in his telling, Def Jam exec Lyor Cohen insisted on it, paying handsomely for the privilege.\n\n\"There were so many things working in my favor on that album,\" Scarface wrote in his memoir Diary of a Madman. \"For the first time, I was working on an album for a label that believed in me 100 percent and didnâ€™t want anything from me except for me to make the dopest album I could possibly make. And they went out of their way to make that possible.\"\n\nDef Jamâ€™s history of putting out classics inspired Face on The Fix, he writes in that book. And in the end, the album stands up there with any of them. It is one of only a small handful of rap records to earn a perfect five-mic rating from The Source, and it belongs in that rarified air with projects like Illmatic and Aquemini.\n\nKanye West - 'The College Dropout' (2004)\n\nYes, today Kanye West is the worst: a Hitler-loving, Trump-supporting, paranoid, antichoice, antisemite who stands accused of sexual harrassment. But two decades ago, the world met a Mr. West who at least seemed very different.\n\nThe College Dropout presented an artist who was already extremely well-known as a beatmaker. But Kanyeâ€™s carefully crafted persona as the bridge between mainstream rap and the underground â€” \"First nâ€” with a Benz and a backpack,\" as he put it â€” meant that he appealed to pretty much everyone. The College Dropout wasn't West at the top of his rap game, but it did show his skill at developing song concepts, at beats, and at creating an artistic vision so powerful, and so relatable, that it captivated an entire generation."
