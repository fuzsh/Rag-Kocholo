The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Christopher Shays (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Shays, Platts, Kucinich, Ruppersberger, and Tierney. Staff present: Lawence Halloran, staff director and counsel; Thomas Costa, professional staff member; Jean Gosa, minority assistant clerk; and Andrew Su, minority professional staff member. Mr. Shays. A quorum being present, the Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats, and International Relations hearing entitled, ``Too Many Secrets: Overclassification is a Barrier to Critical Information Sharing,'' is called to order. An old maxim of military strategy warns, ``He who protects everything, protects nothing.'' Nevertheless, the United States today attempts to shield an immense and growing body of secrets using an incomprehensibly complex system of classifications and safeguard requirements. As a result, no one can say with any degree of certainty how much is classified, how much needs to be declassified, or whether the Nation's real secrets can be adequately protected in a system so bloated, it often does not distinguish between the critically important and the economically irrelevant. This much we know: There are too many secrets. Soon after President Franklin Roosevelt's first executive order on classification in 1940, the propensity to overclassify was noted. Since then, a long and distinguished list of committees and commissions has studied the problem. They all found it impossible to quantify the extent of overclassification because no one even knows the full scope of the Federal Government's classified holding at any given time. Some estimate 10 percent of current secrets should never have been classified. Others put the extent of overclassification as high as 90 percent. During the cold war, facing a monolithic foe determined to penetrate our national secrets, overclassification may have provided a needed security buffer. But the risk/benefit calculation has changed dramatically. Against a stateless, adaptable enemy, we dare not rely on organizational stovepipes to conclude, in advance, who should have access to one piece of an emerging mosaic. Connecting the dots is now a team sport. The cold war paradigm of ``need to know'' must give way to the modern strategic imperative, ``the need to share.'' The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, referred to as the 9/11 Commission, concluded that, ``Current security requirements nurture overclassification and excess compartmentation of information among agencies. Each agency's incentive structure opposes sharing, with risks--criminal, civil, and internal administrative sanctions--but few rewards for sharing information. No one has to pay the long-term costs of overclassifying information, though these costs--even in literal financial terms--are substantial.'' The National Archives' Information Security Oversight Office, ISOO, reported that in 2003, more than 14 million documents were classified by the 3,978 Federal officials authorized to do so. They classified 8 percent more information than the year before. But recently declassified documents confirm the elaborate and costly security applied to some information is simply not worth the effort or expense. A former dictator's cocktail preferences and a facetious plot against Santa Claus are not threats to national security in the public domain, yet both were classified. The most recent ISOO report correctly concludes ``allowing information that will not cause damage to national security to remain in the classification system or to enter that system in the first instance, places all classified information at needless increased risk.'' Current classification practices are highly subjective, inconsistent and susceptible to abuse. One agency protects what another releases. Rampant overclassification often confuses national security with bureaucratic, political or a diplomatic convenience. The dangerous, if natural, tendency to hide embarrassing or inconvenient facts can mask vulnerabilities and only keeps critical information from the American people. The terrorists know their plans. Fewer people classifying fewer secrets would better protects national security by focussing safeguards on truly sensitive information, while allowing far wider dissemination of the facts and analysis, the 9/11 Commission says, must be shared. Any discussion of intelligence reform must include a new approach to classification, one that sheds cold war shackles and serves the strategic needs to share information. Our witnesses this morning bring impressive experience and insight to this important issue and we look forward to their testimony. I welcome each of them. At this time, the Chair would recognize the ranking member of the committee, Mr. Kucinich. [The prepared statement of Hon. Christopher Shays follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.002 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.003 Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for calling this very important hearing. I want to thank the witnesses for their attendance and acknowledge the presence of my colleagues. The overclassification of Federal materials is a growing problem, a problem that has been highlighted once again in the final report of the 9/11 Commission. Overclassification has serious fiscal costs. It also reduces the accountability and reduces our security. But the real problem is not the quantity of materials classified and declassified. Thereal problem, I would submit, is the systemic and reflexive secrecy rampant throughout officials in this administration. But I have to say, as the witnesses certainly know, this problem of overclassification, of secrecy, has been a problem throughout the history of this country. And in a book, Mr. Chairman, which you may be familiar with, Chalmers Johnson, who is a scholar, wrote a book about secrecy and his relationship to what he calls ``militarism secrecy and the end of the Republic.'' The book is called ``The Sorrows of Empire.'' And he was also the person who is the author of an a book called ``Blow Back,'' which talks about the consequences of the U.S. foreign policy on what happens here at home. This book really makes the connections on how secrecy undermines our country. And in a culture of increased military spending, together with the secrecy, it makes it very difficult for taxpayers to have any idea what is going on and how their dollars are being spent; and it really reflects on the priorities of the country. This problem of secrecy is also something we have to deal with as Members of Congress. How many so-called ``secret briefings'' has the Congress had over the past few years where we were just fed misinformation for the purposes of being able to gain support in Congress for things that people otherwise would not have supported. But the meetings were kept secret and that is a way that you stop a discussion in a free society. Now, the current situation with this administration-- instead of making information available or sharing information, this administration reversed a trend started in the Clinton administration, a trend toward openness, the Clinton Executive Order 2958. Under this order there is a presumption against classification, and this presumption was used in case of doubt, and where there was doubt about the appropriate level of classification, the order specified that the material be classified at the lower level. An interagency security classification appeals panel was established and historical records were declassified at record rates and on a timely automated schedule. In contrast, the current administration has dramatically increased the volume of Federal materials concealed from the American people. Executive Order 13292, issued in March 2003, 18 months after September 11, permitted officials to classify information when there was doubt whether or not to do so, allowed officials to classify information at the more restrictive level when there was a question as to the appropriate level. The order also delayed and weakened the system of automatic declassification established under the Clinton executive order and underutilized the appeals panel. As a result, as has been noted earlier, a record 14 million classification actions were reported last year, costing U.S. taxpayers an all-time high of $6.5 billion. The total number of pages declassified by this administration was the lowest in the last 10 years, annual FOIA requests, Freedom of Information Act requests, have become more tightly controlled, surpassing the $3 million mark last year for the first time in history and costing the government $325 million. Secrecy is on the rise throughout the administration. Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services now have been granted classification authority, while the Office of the Vice President has become exempt from certain mandatory declassification reviews. The FCC, Federal Communications Commission, recently stated that outage reports from wireless, line, cable and telecom providers would be protected from public disclosure because of ``increasing concern about homeland security and national defense.'' In addition, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently decided that information about the physical security of nuclear facilities would no longer be publicly available or updated on the agency's Web site, though this information would be critical for public health and safety. And I want to say that I am pleased this subcommittee will be holding hearings on this issue of nuclear plant security in the coming weeks. Information seems to be arbitrarily and unnecessarily classified. Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union released court documents showing that the Justice Department tried to file secret affidavits in two civil court cases challenging the USA Patriot Act. These affidavits can only be viewed by the judge and would not be seen by the public or even the plaintiffs. The attack on the civil liberties of U.S. citizens now includes this new tactic. The Justice Department even attempted to redact harmless information, such as a quotation from a 1972 Supreme Court ruling, and general descriptions of a company and the fact that it did consulting work. Even more egregiously, we have seen the declassification used as an excuse to avoid embarrassment to the administration. The Senate Intelligence Committee's report on prewar intelligence concerning the Iraqi WMD program was redacted. The entire report of Major General Antonio Taguba, detailing the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, was classified, though it did not reveal intelligence sources or methods. Even in this committee, we saw how the Pentagon retroactively classified sections of a report critical of the proposed national missile defense plan by Philip Coyle, Director of the Department of Defense Office of Operational Test and Evaluation. The information in the report which had been disclosed and widely disseminated was subsequently withheld from Congress for 8 months. The Pentagon then marked a report ``For Official Use Only'' and classified the 50 specific recommendations stated in Mr. Coyle's report so it could not be released to the public for scrutiny. The final report of the 9/11 Commission confirms what many of us already know too well. The Bush administration's excessive use of classification, delay in declassifying Federal materials and encroachments on the civil rights of individuals are antithetical to democratic principle; and it is our responsibility, as Congress, to provide effective checks and balances, which is really the purpose of this committee. Thank you, Mr. Shays. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dennis J. Kucinich follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.008 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.009 Mr. Shays. I thank the gentleman. At this time the Chair would recognize Mr. Tierney. Mr. Tierney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I join with members of the public and Members of Congress and, of course, the September 11 families in hoping that Congress will act swiftly to implement the unanimous bipartisan recommendation of the 9/11 Commission Report. I must say that as we address today's issue, the Commission's strong and unequivocal recommendations that the executive branch move from treating information on a ``need to know'' to a ``need to share'' basis, I am uncertain that this transformation can occur within an administration that has overemphasized classification at the expense of congressional oversight and, in some cases, at the expense of common sense. I know during the last administration, in 1995, the President reset previous default settings, directing classifiers not to shield information of doubtful value and to classify information at the lowest rather than the highest possible level. Reclassification was prohibited if the material had otherwise been properly put in the public domain. Under this President Bush, his executive order reverts to a ``when it doubt, classify'' standard, expands classification authorities and categories, and postpones automatic declassification on some records. Now, this leads us here today to ask the witnesses, how can the administration convince a skeptical public that the administration is committed to changing this culture when, even as we speak, they are continuing to classify, in some cases retroactively, information pertaining to our national defense. One key example was mentioned briefly by Mr. Kucinich, and it has to do with missile defense. I happen to have a longer history with this issue, and so I want to take a moment to recount it. And the chairman has shared this history. In the context of the 9/11 Commission Report, the most immediate threat is not an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile, but an act of terror, some biological or chemical agent introduced in this country, or a dirty bomb delivered in a suitcase. Even our own intelligence agencies prioritize threats in this manner. So the public has the right to ask, why is this administration spending more than $10 billion per year on a national missile defense system instead of protecting our ports, equipping the Coast Guard or our local first responders, protecting chemical facilities, our nuclear reactors, and so on down the line--the many things that need to be done, which are underfunded seriously in the President's budget and in the majority's budget. The public has the right to an answer. Do experts and security personnel think this system will work? The answer is ``no.'' Forty-nine previous generals and admirals and other higher retired military individuals speak out against deployment at this point in time. In a letter to the President, they clearly set out, ``As you have said, Mr. President, our highest priority is to prevent terrorists from acquiring and employing weapons of mass destruction. We agree. We therefore recommend, as the militarily responsible course of action, that you postpone operation and deployment of the expensive and untested GMD system and transfer the associated funding to accelerated programs to secure the multitude of facilities containing nuclear weapons and materials and to protect our ports and borders against terrorists who may attempt to smuggle weapons of mass destruction into the United States.'' In addition, 31 former government officials called the missile defense deployment a ``sham.'' These are officials who worked for Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton, and argued that the missile defense system planned for rollout in September will provide no real defense, as they called it a ``sham.'' The officials worked at the Pentagon, the Department of State, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; and their letter accused the administration of rushing a program into a field that is largely untested and missing major components. The fact of the matter is, the public should know whether or not this President, for political purposes, is satisfying his ideological extremists by deploying an unproven, inadequately tested system; and in fact, is he living in the past instead of addressing the concerns that we have in the 21st century. But instead of allowing for a public examination, this administration has classified relevant critical reports and facts, even reclassifying some that have been in the public domain for as much as 4 or 5 years for what can be argued as ``political purposes.'' I will not go through the long rendition, Mr. Chairman, of the many letters we have, but starting back in September 8, 2000, this subcommittee held a hearing with the then-Director of Operational Tests and Evaluation, the Pentagon's own person, Phil Coyle, who testified about the inadequacies of the missile defense system. And at that time I asked the subcommittee, and the subcommittee agreed without objection, to enter his report detailing 50 recommendations for how this system should be tested. And we put that in the public record. What occurred after that was a pattern of stonewalling and repeated resistance from the Department of Defense that lasted over 8 months. Finally, on May 31, 2001 the Coyle report was delivered to Congress. As Mr. Kucinich mentioned, it was first marked ``For Official Use Only,'' but when challenged, the Department of Defense was unable to respond to what that category meant and certainly did not indicate that it was classified in any sense. Finally, Chairman Shays took the lead and decided to make this information available to the public on June 2001. It was on the Web site. It was in public documents. And since that point in time, we have had numerous hearings in this committee. We have had testimony from experts. We have had poster boards set up with the information on it. We have had it on our own Web sites. And finally, I asked the General Accounting Office to prepare a report to tell us in September 2004 what would the condition of deployment be, especially with respect to the 50 issues by Mr. Coyle. After fighting for an inordinate period of time, the General Accounting Office was finally able to issue a report. It no sooner hit my desk than this administration classified that report. You can imagine for yourself whether it was a favorable report to their position or unfavorable. Not satisfied with that, we asked them to go back and look over every line and tell us what was classified and was not. Having done that, they issued a classified report and an unclassified report. The unclassified report, in my estimation was damning. You can imagine what the classified report was. But then the administration took the additional step of going back in, reclassifying all the previously open, available information upon which those reports were based, none of them previously having been classified, all of the information having been in the public domain for some 4 years. You can answer the question better than I can, but why should this administration be trusted with the recommendation of the September 11 Commission to move toward a culture of ``need to share'' as opposed to ``need to know?'' But it is not all about the missile defense system. There is a disturbing pattern in this administration of using secrecy as a means to defend or advance their political purposes and policies. When confronted with allegations that the Energy Task Force, which the Vice President convened, was predominantly comprised of industry members who would be inclined to favor the status quo energy policy in this country, the Bush administration refused to come clean and disclose participants of the task force, arguing that such inquiries into Federal agencies are off limits to the courts, the Congress, and thus, the American people. In June 2003, when the Environmental Protection Agency released a report on the state of the environment, the detailed assessment of climate change, which among other things was to conclude that carbon dioxide emissions are contributing to global warming, was deleted by the White House and replaced with language that was deliberately vague and disingenuous about the scientific causes of global warming. After hearing the compelling evidence of defective tires on certain automobiles and the tragedies that ensued on America's roads, Congress passed a law making certain that auto safety data be made available to the public. But this administration's National Highway Traffic Administration has decided that such information regarding unsafe automobiles which may be detrimental to their companies will remain secret. And now, according to Friday's Washington Post, the Department of Justice in its court battle with the American Civil Liberties Union over portions of the Patriot Act has attempted to rely on secret evidence. As Mr. Kucinich also mentioned, one aspect of that was inessential censoring a dozen seemingly innocuous passages on national security grounds, including an attempt to redact a quotation from a 1972 Supreme Court ruling that simply said, ``The danger to political dissent is acute where the government attempts to act under so vague a concept as the power to protect domestic security. Given the difficulty of defining the domestic security interests, the danger of abuse and acting to protect that interest become apparent.'' Now, there is a dangerous statement if I ever heard one. But this administration's Department of Justice thought that had to be redacted from a court proceeding. This reliance on classification and withholding of information does not just prevent transparency and accountability in public policymaking. It is an act that is fundamentally opposed to the public; it is opposed to their health, to their civil liberties, to their consumer interests, and most importantly, to their safety. How can we trust that this administration with this record will commit itself to implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that we have more transparency, that we move to a culture of sharing, a ``need to share'' versus a ``need to know''? At a time when it is so important that we put our resources where the dangers appear most and not on some ideological extreme program that is unproven and untested, hiding the facts is not doing this country any service. And we have to take the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission seriously. I hope these hearings, Mr. Chairman, will move us in that direction of classifying only what needs to be classified and sharing the rest, so that the American people can make the right choices and the right priorities for our safety. Thank you. Mr. Shays. I thank the gentleman for his statement. At this time the Chair would recognize Mr. Ruppersberger, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Ruppersberger. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you. We have a tremendous opportunity at this time in our history to provide for national security as a result of what happened on September 11. I want to first praise the Commission and all of those people involved, including the families of those who died in the September 11 incident. At this point, it is very, very important that we deal with this issue in a nonpartisan way. And it is important that we also understand that there are different elements we have to deal with as far as the 9/11 Commission's report. First, it is extremely important that we do have one person that can hold all the intelligence communities accountable. We have to make sure that the intelligence communities, all of them, including the military, the DOD, CIA, NSA, all the intelligence communities, work as a team and that they integrate the information. We can be extremely sophisticated in our intelligence community, but if we do not get to the bottom line and do what needs to be done and get the right information to the right people, we will not be successful in what is our goal of national security. Now, the issue we are dealing with today is overclassification as a barrier to critical information. I think it is extremely important that we deal with this issue. Just one aspect of this overclassification is also the barrier in getting people cleared and how ridiculous it is. I have a Federal Times, August 16, ``482,000 Wait For Clearance, Backlog of Security Checks Holds Up Work, Wastes Billions of Dollars.'' Now, one of the American intelligence community's greatest problems is the cult of classification in which information, both rare and commonplace, is a safeguard with equal zeal. Both cases also illustrate the intense political pressures on intelligence and counterintelligence agencies, diluting the value of the Nation's intelligence. These are parts of our system that are broken, the ones that no one in Washington wants to talk about, but we are going to have to deal with to fix this testimony. There is certainly vital information that must be protected from foreign espionage. These secrets worth saving should be held closely. Far too much effort is being wasted protecting nonsecrets which allows vital secrets to slip through. In Washington, classification has led to sort of a game, creating those ``in the know'' and those who are ``not in the know.'' This game heightens the power of bureaucrats, but so much is classified that it is impossible for people with security clearances to know what is derived from a spy satellite and what is plucked out of the newspaper, which is considered open source. So what is a secret? Nuclear secrets should be kept secret. The names of U.S. agents in other countries must be kept secret. Operation capabilities of U.S. weapons should be kept secret. Unlike today's situation, a secret requires that there not be the slightest hint that even a secret exists. To do that, the government would need to follow just a few simple rules instead of the myriad of complexities it has erected. And whether it is a Democratic administration, or a Republican, there is not consistency in what we do as far as this classification is concerned. And we need consistency. We need standards. First, there must be few secrets. Unless you are willing to stash people, it is easiest to keep a small number of secrets. Second, give secrets to fewer people. The idea of hundreds of thousands of people wandering around with secrets is absurd. Do not use access to classified materials as a justification for doing background checks on military officers. Just do background checks. Do not classify as secret that which is in the New York Times and on the Internet. Do not use secrecy as a shield to protect idiotic political and policy decisions. I am looking forward to hearing what your recommendations would be to deal with this very important issue. It is a strong component of what we need to deal with to provide the best national security for our country. Intelligence clearly is the best defense against terrorism, but we need to get our system right, consistent, and focused. Thank you. Mr. Shays. I thank the gentleman, especially your comments, given that you do serve on the Intelligence Committee. I would just say, I appreciate the gentleman breaking a family vacation to be here. I have the opportunity to ask the first questions. I am going to defer to you to start off, and then we'll go to Mr. Kucinich, Mr. Tierney and myself. I ask unanimous consent that all members of the subcommittee be permitted to place an opening statement in the record and that the record remain open for 3 days for that purpose. Without objection, so ordered. I ask further unanimous consent that all witnesses be permitted to include their written statement in the record. Without objection, so ordered. This is a fairly big document that I have shown the ranking member. It's entitled, ``Dubious Secrets: A Briefing Book of Overclassified Documents,'' prepared by the National Security Archive, George Washington University. I am going to ask that it be submitted into the record. Without, objection. [Note.--The report entitled, ``Dubious Secrets: A Briefing Book of Overclassified Documents,'' may be found in subcommittee files. A copy of the title page follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.010 Mr. Shays. I want to just note that the George Washington Archive maintains a body of documentation demonstrating the inconsistency and the arbitrariness of many classified decisions. They find documents released by one agency classified in whole or in part by another, and they track a declassification process they find to be extraordinarily slow and litigious. Without objection, we will put that in the record. At this time, I recognize our witnesses. We have Mr. William Leonard, Director, Information Security Oversight Office, National Archives and Records Administration. We have Carol Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security, Department of Defense; Mr. Steven Aftergood, Federation of American Scientists; and Mr. William P. Crowell, the Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security in the Information Age. We truly have four experts on this issue. It is not an easy issue to deal with, and given that we have one panel, we will have the 5 minutes that you may speak; you can trip over a little bit. I'd just as soon you not take another 5 minutes but you have that right. Then we will go to 10 minutes of questioning. At this time, we will swear in our witnesses. Is there anyone else that has accompanied you that might provide information so they can stand and be sworn in at this time. Is there anyone else? No one else. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Shays. Note for the record our witnesses have responded in the affirmative. At this time we will begin with you, Mr. Leonard. Thank you for being here. STATEMENTS OF J. WILLIAM LEONARD, DIRECTOR, INFORMATION SECURITY OVERSIGHT OFFICE, NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION; CAROL A. HAAVE, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE; STEVEN AFTERGOOD, FEDERATION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS; AND WILLIAM P. CROWELL, THE MARKLE FOUNDATION TASK FORCE ON NATIONAL SECURITY IN THE INFORMATION AGE Mr. Leonard. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Kucinich, members of the panel. I wish to thank you for holding this hearing on security classification and declassification issues. As Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, I am responsible to the President for overseeing the governmentwide classification program within both government and industry. Executive Order 12958, as amended, sets forth the basic framework by which executive branch agencies classify national security information. Pursuant to his constitutional authority in this order, the President authorizes a limited number of individuals to apply classification to certain national security-related information. While the order is clear that the employment of classification is based in large part upon the judgment of an original classifying authority, in delegating classification authority, the President has established clear parameters for its use and certain burdens that must be satisfied. Classification authority is not without limits. The President has spelled out some very clear prohibitions with respect to the use of classification. Specifically, in no case can information be classified in order to conceal violations of law or prevent embarrassment to a person, an organization, or an agency. Unfortunately, there have been instances giving the impression that information has been classified in violation of the order. In each case I am aware of, I have found that this often arises due to lack of proactive oversight within agencies or a lack of effective training and awareness provided to some cleared personnel. I believe that the overall policy for security classification as set forth in the current executive order is fundamentally sound. While I and others, including the 9/11 Commission, have advocated revisions to basic concepts such as the ``need-to-know'' principle, the order as currently configured is replete with measures to ensure the classification system's continued effectiveness. Many agencies are excelling at fulfilling these requirements; others are not. It is no secret that the government classifies too much information. Many senior officials will candidly acknowledge the problem of excessive classification. This is supported in part by agency input to my office that indicates that overall classification activity is up over the past several years. What I find most troubling, however, is that some individual agencies have no idea how much information they generate is classified, whether the overall quantity is increasing or decreasing, what the explanations are for such changes, which elements within their organization are most responsible for the changes, and most importantly of all, whether the changes are appropriate. The identification of baseline information such as this is essential for agencies to be able to ascertain the effectiveness of the classification efforts. My current concerns extend to the area of declassification as well. It's disappointing to note that declassification activity has been down for the past several years. In some quarters, when it comes to classification in times of national security challenges, when available resources are distracted elsewhere, the approach toward classification and declassification can be to err on the side of caution. Yet the classification system is too important and the consequences resulting from improper implementation too severe to allow error to be the part of any implementation strategy. Both too little and too much classification is not an option. Too much classification unnecessarily impedes effective information sharing. And inappropriate classification undermines the integrity of the entire process. Too little classification can subject our citizens, our democratic institutions, our homeland security, and our interactions with foreign nations to potential harm. Proactive oversight by agencies of their security classification program and involvement by senior leadership is crucial. The security classification system is permissive, not prescriptive. It identifies what information can be classified, not what information must be classified. The decision to classify information or not is ultimately the prerogative of an agency and its original classification authorities. The problem, however, with all due apologiesto John Donne, is that no agency is an island. The exercise of agency prerogative to classify certain information has ripple effects throughout the entire executive branch, as well as the Nation as a whole. It can serve as an impediment to sharing information with another agency or with the public who have a genuine need to know about the information. The 9/11 Commission has recommended that information procedures should provide incentives for sharing to restore a better balance between security and shared knowledge. The administration is currently developing guidelines and regulations to improve information sharing both among Federal departments and agencies and between the Federal Government and State and local entities. On August 2 of this year, President Bush announced that he will be issuing a directive requiring all relevant agencies to complete the task of adopting common data bases and procedures so that intelligence and homeland security information can be shared and searched effectively, consistent with privacy and civil liberties. I thank you for inviting me here today Mr. Chairman. I will be happy to answer any questions you and the committee may have. Mr. Shays. Thank you, Mr. Leonard.

Ms. Haave. Ms. Haave. Good morning, Chairman Shays, Mr. Kucinich, and members of the panel. I appreciate the chance to speak with you today about the protection of classified information within the Department of Defense. My opening statement will be brief, as I believe the time we have here can best be spent in direct dialog. Protection of classified information is one of the most important priorities of the Department. No one wants to provide information outside of proper channels that would do our servicemen and women, as well as our civilian coworkers harm. Nor does anyone want to give away what is our economic and military advantage by providing information about advanced science and technology, sources or methods of our operations. The question becomes, how do we balance the risk of disclosure and its often incalculable consequences against the public's desire to know? The issue before us today is overclassification and whether it is an impediment to information sharing. I have not found within the Department of Defense that people are intentionally overclassifying. That's not to say that it doesn't and isn't happening. More, I have found that these problems stem from time-driven, operational circumstances and a misunderstanding of classification guidance. In the end, people simply don't want to make mistakes that could have both personal and national security consequences. Does this impact information sharing? Sometimes it does. We in DOD are working to ensure our policies are clear about when and how to classify information, as well as ensuring personnel know and understand their responsibilities in sharing with those who must have the information. Much data that is transported on DOD networks is protected by classification guidance provided by other government organizations. We adhere to that guidance, but we certainly can improve the way we do it. For example, how do we deal with originator-controlled documents in an electronic environment? The 21st century is about information technology. It is about the seamless availability of information across security domains consistent with the governance strategy that ensures people are properly vetted and trained. The collectors of information and also, normally, the original classifiers can never know the myriad ways that their information might be used for good purpose. Therefore, we have to migrate to a user-driven environment to support true competitive intelligence, to ensure the warfighters and policymakers have the information that they need to make good decisions, and to mutually support other organizations and agencies in successfully accomplishing their missions as well. We must break down the functional stovepipes and institutional barriers in favor of a more horizontally integrated collaborative enterprise characterized by cooperation and incentivized, shared goals. We must make better use of all-source analysis to blur the origin of information and right to release using automated terror lines. ``Need to know,'' while still a valid concept that drives information security, must now also include the need to share information more broadly at multiple classification levels, as well as in the unclassified public domain. Technology is not the problem. The technology we need is here today, or is being developed, and there are any number of initiatives that are moving us collectively in the right direction. Instead, I would offer that the problem is institutional and cultural, and no agency or organization is immune. Change is always difficult and fear of making a mistake precludes people from moving forward in ways that are consistent with technology and business process improvements. In the end, this is a discussion about risk. How much risk is the Nation willing to endure in the quest to balance protection against the public's desire to know? It is a complex question that requires thought and, ultimately, action. The Department of Defense has been taking that action with respect to information that it alone controls. As stated in my formal statement, the Department has embraced a network-centric enterprise with common standards and protocols and a robust information assurance and protection schema. But this architecture and enterprise are not cheap, and when extended to other governments, as well as State, local and other organizations, the costs are high. We are working closely with the intelligence community, the Department of Homeland Security, and others to extend the enterprise, to facilitate the collaboration and cooperation that the public deserves, and we are better for it. Thank you. Mr. Shays. Thank you very much, Ms. Haave. [The prepared statement of Ms. Haave follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.020 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.021 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.022 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.023 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.024 Mr. Shays. Mr. Aftergood. Mr. Aftergood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was going to begin by attempting to document for you the state of the classification system as it is perceived from outside the government. I was going to explain to you that classification policy is often arbitrary, inconsistent, that classifiers sometimes classify contrary to their own rules. Sometimes, as in the case of the Taguba report, they use classification to conceal criminal activity, and the classification system is, in other ways, unsatisfactory. I have documented some of those rather serious charges in my formal testimony. I know from your opening statements that all of you already are aware of many of these problems. Mr. Shays. Let me ask how long would it take for you to do that. Mr. Aftergood. I can do it very quickly. Mr. Shays. I would like it to be part of the public record. So you have the time to do it. In the course of your presenting those documents, it gives us something to question everybody with. Mr. Aftergood. OK. I will do that briefly. Mr. Shays. We will start the clock over again. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Chairman, if I may, I think the witness ought to feel very comfortable in going over this material with the committee, and we eagerly await your recitation of your report. Mr. Aftergood. Thank you very much. I have selected not quite at random, but a cross-section of cases that have come into my hands that include several anomalies in classification policy. The recent Senate intelligence report on prewar intelligence on Iraq included abundant redactions, that is, removals of information from the report that in some cases were inconsistent or inexplicable. On one page attached to my testimony it was stated that Iraqi agents agreed to pay up to a ``deleted'' amount for certain aluminum tubes. This is a point of controversy having to do with Iraq's nuclear weapons program. But on another page of the same report, CIA reviewers included the very same information: Iraqi agents agreed to pay up to $17.50. At a minimum, this is inconsistent. It shows a lack of professionalism in classification; but more than that, I think it shows an improper attempt to withhold information that has no business being classified. Obviously, the Iraqis know what they paid. The vendors know what they paid. They know that we know. There is nothing sensitive that's being concealed here, but it held up the release of the report, and it helped turn it into a kind of Swiss cheese. A second example is the Taguba report on abuses of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. As you can see from the title page of the report, which is also appended to my testimony, the whole report was classified as Secret. That is, the Secret classification level means that its disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to national security. If you look at page 16 of the report, you can see that several individual paragraphs of the report were also classified Secret, such things as a finding that numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on detainees; punching, slapping and kicking detainees; jumping on their naked feet and so on. These individual findings were classified Secret. That is not only inappropriate, it actually is a violation of the rules governing the classification system itself. Those rules state in President Bush's executive order that in no case shall information be classified in order to conceal violations of law. Yet it appears that is exactly what happened here. When agencies violate their own classification rules, one thing that tells you is that oversight is inadequate. A third example that I pulled from my written statement is, to me, the most extreme example of overclassification, and that has to do with CIA's insistence on classifying historical intelligence budget data. In 1997 and 1998, the CIA declassified, under pressure of litigation, the total intelligence budget for those years, for 1997 and 1998. But in 2000 they said that similar information from 50 years earlier is still properly classified. To state the obvious, that is a logically incoherent position. There is no national security construct that permits the declassification of the 1997 budget, but prohibits the declassification of the 1947 budget. What that tells me is that the CIA has completely lost its bearings when it comes to classification of budget information, and that there is no one to stop them from arbitrary and mistaken classification actions. There are many other examples. The document you entered into the record, Mr. Chairman, ``Dubious Secrets,'' from the National Security Archive, is filled with other cases. I imagine that anyone who has had dealings with the national security system, either as a government employee or as a concerned citizen, has their own horror stories to tell. Certainly the public is increasingly becoming concerned. I am a member of the steering committee of a new coalition of politically diverse organizations under the rubric openthegovernment.org, that has come together to try to remedy this situation. I would just like to say one final word about what is in a way the most important aspect of this hearing. That is, what's the solution? The solution is not a broad policy critique. I don't think the solution is to try to fix the whole system at a single blow. I think the solution was identified by the 9/11 Commission. That is start with a very specific, tangible change. Start with declassification of intelligence budget information. There is no other category of information that has been as vigorously maintained as Secret for so long with so much energy as intelligence budget information. If we can fix that, then the road becomes clear to fixing a whole range of other erroneously or improperly classified categories of information; and that's the point I wanted to stress. Thank you very much. Mr. Shays. Thank you, Mr. Aftergood.

Mr. Crowell. I want to say it correctly. Is it Crowell? Mr. Crowell. It's Crowell. That's to avoid getting confused with a certain admiral that I'm always confused with. Good morning, Chairman Shays, Mr. Kucinich, and members of the subcommittee. I would like to thank you for this opportunity to testify this morning on recommendations that are made by the Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security in the Information Age. I think you will find that our observations are in agreement, Mr. Chairman, with your opening statement of the problem. The Markle Foundation Task Force is seeking, though, to outline and propose a new strategy of information sharing that can benefit our war on terrorism. Information and information sharing are key to fighting terrorism and enhancing our security. Today, our government still does not have all of the information it needs to fight terrorism, and the information it does have is sometimes isolated in different agencies, and therefore it is more difficult to see its significance. While the discussion about how to implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendation to restructure the intelligence community is important, another key 9/11 Commission recommendation that is creating and implementing a trusted information network to facilitate better information sharing among our intelligence and law enforcement organizations at the Federal, State and local levels could actually make America safer today. The 9/11 Commission embraced the recommendations for creation of a System-wide Homeland Analysis and Resource Exchange, the acronym SHARE, network, made last December by the Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security in the Information Age. The Markle Foundation Task Force consists of leading national security experts from four administrations, as well as widely recognized experts on technology and on civil liberties. The SHARE network concept represents a virtual reorganization of government by fundamentally altering how people in the many organizations ask to fight terrorism, how they share information to facilitate better and faster decisionmaking. Such an approach when paired with strong divide lines that govern the system is also the best way to protect privacy and civil liberties. The SHARE network is aimed at moving us from our current need-to-know system into the need-to-share culture that you've been describing. However, one of the barriers to enabling that move involves classification and information- security practices. Decisions about sharing intelligence in the Government today are still made largely in the context of a system of classification that was developed during the cold war. During the cold war, the use of information was dominated by a culture of classification and tight limitations on access in which information was shared only on the need-to-know basis. The current system assumes that it is possible to determine in advance who needs to know particular information and that the risks associated with disclosure are greater than the potential benefits of wider information sharing. The results of the incentives currently in place to protect information results and far more information being classified initially and remaining classified than is necessary or appropriate. Another problem with the current system is that each agency has its own classification practices which leads to cultural tensions when agencies attempt to share information with each other. This cold war mindset of classification, sanitization and tight limits on sharing information is ill-suited to today's homeland security challenge. While certain information, particularly about sources and methods, must be protected against unauthorized disclosure, the general mindset should be one that strives for broad sharing of information with all of the relevant players in the network. The Markle Foundation Task Force approach is to develop new concepts of operation and to use new technology to achieve a sharing culture. The SHARE network concept is a decentralized, loosely coupled, secure and trusted network that sends information to and pulls information from all participants in the system. Such an approach empowers all participants, from local law enforcement officers to senior policymakers. Our approach combines policy and technical solutions to create a network that would substantially improve our ability to predict and prevent terrorist attacks. The SHARE network is based upon the right to share concept. By taking steps, by creating tear-line reports, it moves us from a system of classification to one that is based on authorization and encourages reports that contain the maximum possible amount of shareable information. In addition, SHARE would use existing technologies that can facilitate the sharing of sensitive information with inappropriate channels and with protections for privacy. Screening tools can be used to help the redaction process to create less classified reports and can also tell us when sensitive information is about to be sent to parties who lack the proper permission to receive it. To address the need for information about reliability of a source without having to rely on classified descriptions, we recommend the use of reputation meters, similar to those that are used today to rate sellers in e-bay in formats, and also to use standard formats for intelligence documents. Auditing technology could be deployed to track the flow of information to different players and to record how the information is used, which could help deter leaks. Information- rights management technologies when combined with digital certificates can also help by allowing agencies to create self- enforcing rules about who can have access to particular documents, how they can be used and how long the documents can be viewed before access expires. Finally, information can be accompanied by clear, more specific handling requirements and dissemination limitations. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, information sharing itself is not the goal. Rather, it is the means by which we can effectively enhance security and protect privacy, by maximizing our ability to make sense of all of the available information. To accomplish this, particularly in fighting terrorism, we must shed our current cold war need-to-know mentality and replace it with a culture based on need-to-share. Information security is a legitimate concern, but it can be appropriately addressed in the ways that I've outlined above. What is needed now is the leadership by both Congress and the President to get the information flowing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Crowell follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.040 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.041 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.042 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T8291.043 Mr. Shays. Thank you, Mr. Crowell. Let me just make a few observations before Mr. Ruppersberger begins the questions, and one is that I carry a basic view that when the executive branch gets more power, it must be accompanied with more legislative oversight. I also take the view that classification practices impede oversight by Congress for the public. I have read, in my 17 years in Congress, confidential--in terms of the rates of classification, confidential documents, secret documents, top secret documents, and then we have compartmentalized with code-word access and special access and so on, but much what I've read under confidential and secret and, in some cases, top secret, but not obviously as often, it has been information I have wondered why it has been classified. In a meeting I had with the chairman of the 9/11 Commission, Governor Kean said to me his biggest surprise was reading hours of information, wondering why in the world was this classified. Just another observation, that yesterday we were talking about fighting a network called Al Qaeda. We were told we need a human and a communication network. This was in public diplomacy, and I'm hearing today, no, we need to break out of our stovepipes and have a data network. It's just interesting that the word network keeps showing up. Finally, to conclude my observation, we have nearly 4,000 people classifying information, 14 million documents, but some of those documents could, literally, have been a book. They could be extensive. So even when I think of 14 million, the document could be small, you know, just bit of information, or it could just be pages and pages and pages of information. So, in the end, I'm interested in is learning what the solution is. That's my interest, and we'll start with Mr. Ruppersberger. You have 10 minutes. If you need to run over, we can be informal with this. Mr. Ruppersberger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, Mr. Leonard, in your opening statement, you said that each agency has its own classification criteria, but no agency is an island. This creates both confusion and inconsistency that impedes the necessary bounds for national security and transparency in a democracy. My question is this, do you believe a National Security Intelligence Director would help to solve part of this problem if that person had the authority both--also budgetary control to implement the policies that are necessary, some of the recommendations in the 9/11 Commission Report, but especially as it deals with the issue we're talking about here today, overclassification, making sure that what is classified needs to be classified and what is not is not? Mr. Leonard. Thank you, Congressman. One thing I don't want to do is to presuppose any particular outcomes, but let me address it along these lines. Mr. Ruppersberger. I'm asking your opinion. I know this is in debate now. The President has recommended a National Security Director. The issue of budgetary still is not there. We're trying to get information. Let me say this. The reason I'm asking these questions and we're all here is, we have an opportunity, I think now, to really do something very positive as it relates to our national security and intelligence, and it's very important that, based on your expertise, we get your opinion. Mr. Leonard. Yes, sir. Mr. Ruppersberger. I know you are not speaking for the administration, but I'm asking, from your expertise, what your opinion would be as far as a National Security Director, as far as the budgetary issues are concerned, so that person might be able to implement what we're talking about here today. Mr. Leonard. Yes, sir. Let me address that along these lines. One of the most significant challenges we have, I think, in this area is that we do have a basic framework for classification, as I mentioned, but superimposed upon that are multiple variations of the system which are all designed to achieve the same end. So, for example, currently, the DCI has his own unique authorities with respect to protecting sources and methods. The Secretary of Energy has his own unique authorities with respect to protecting atomic energy information. The director of NSA has his own unique authorities with respect to protecting communication security information. The Secretary of Defense has his own unique authorities with respect to protecting NATO-related information, and the list goes on and on and on and on. Those variations are, I think, significant impediments to information sharing. When it comes to protecting information, I see it as a binary state: Either it's protected or it isn't protected. And we have all these variations on the system that have minor nuances and differences in terms of how we protect information, how we credit systems, how we mark them and things along those lines. If a single individual had the authority, had the authority to overcome the existing statutory and regulatory authority that allows multiple agencies to come up with their own nuances and variations on the system, yes, I think that would be a good thing. Mr. Ruppersberger. In your opinion, do you feel that person would need budgetary control, also, of those agencies? Mr. Leonard. Let's put it this way, Congressman, it's one thing to have the authority to write regulations. There always has to be consequences for noncompliance with regulations. I find budgetary authority is one of the best means in which to get people's attention with respect to compliance and noncompliance of the regulations. Mr. Ruppersberger. I guess you need the power to do what you need to do, I guess. Mr. Leonard. Yes, sir. Mr. Ruppersberger. Mr. Aftergood, there was an intelligence open hearing, I believe last week or the week before, where they talked about the intelligence budget, and you addressed that in your testimony as far as whether or not that needs to be public. And I think there's a bipartisan consensus that there is a lot in the intelligence budget that could be made public, but there also was a concern that some of that should not be made public, and I think in your report you seem as if the whole budget. I would be concerned that, line by line, could be very dangerous to both our military and to some of our CIA people or NSA people throughout the world. Could you give me your opinion on whether or not you think that the whole budget should be out front and open or whether or not we should focus on the areas which could cause some type of problem to our people who are fighting and working for our national security? Mr. Aftergood. Yes, sir. I do believe that there are portions of the intelligence budget that should remain classified. I would be guided by the recommendations of the 9/ 11 Commission which said that the total, the top line number, as well as the individual agency budget totals should be made public but nothing beyond that. I think that's a reasonable middle ground that would provide oversight. It would break the logjam of secrecy in this area, but it would keep sensitive programs protected. Mr. Ruppersberger. OK. I'm going to ask--I don't know how long I have. It's a broad question to the whole panel, but the 9/11 Commission endorsed the creation of a decentralized, technologically advanced, trusted information network to make threat information more widely accessible and to reverse cold war paradigms and cultural biases against information sharing. The Commission noted such a network had been described in a task force report commissioned by the Markle Foundation, Mr. Crowell, but the concept has not yet been converted into action. My question to the whole panel if we have time--and I know it's a broad question, but I would like your point of view-- what would you recommend to Congress as to how you would start to implement the changes that need to be done in order to effectuate the issue that we're talking about here today, overclassification, need-to-know? I mean, there are many issues that need to be classified in that question. But we have a tremendous amount of volume. We have a lot of agencies. Part of the problem in intelligence is just getting this enormous amount of volume on Internet and all that we get and then analyzing it and then getting it to the right people so they can implement and use it to protect our national security. You have to remember now, we're focused on this. The country is focused. How would you begin to implement the changes that need to be made? You want to start with Mr. Crowell and then go down that way. Thanks. Mr. Crowell. Thank you very much. Let me start by saying that we have just concluded a preliminary session at the Aspen Institute in Colorado in which we were addressing the very issue that you raised, which is, what are the next steps for implementing a SHARE concept network? It's a very difficult problem, and it's a long kind of effort because it's a very large undertaking. We believe that it begins with legislation that would essentially outline the kind of network that the Congress would like to see, based upon some of the principles which I will very briefly describe, and that the President then put together the cross-agency kind of implementing process that is necessary, because once you begin working across agencies, funding and management of large undertakings like this become very, very difficult and very complex. All of this to be done with a short deadline, so that we can move this along, using existing technology, not inventing new technologies. We think that this concept can be fleshed out. I'd like to just add, before I mention the characteristics of the network, that the larger problem in trying to achieve the balance that was described earlier is to not only have a network which encourages sharing but also to have the kind of guidelines and policy that encourage sharing; that we train people in sharing concepts and in classification concepts; and that we have metrics and auditing capabilities so we can see whether or not they're following the policy and guidance. Mr. Ruppersberger. And standards. You need standards. Mr. Crowell. Yes, and we need standards. We need compliance enforcement, both for protecting information that needs to be protected but also for sharing information that will benefit the public, the public good. Just one last quick thing, some of the concepts that we believe are important then are concepts that have flexible access controls, authentication authorizations, so people trust the system; that they have a publish-and-subscribe capability in which people can say, I want to be able to get certain kinds of information to assist me in doing my mission or to assist me in doing my analysis, and they will get it; that it be a distributed system in which it's a system of systems. You don't build it centrally and manage it centrally from some place in the U.S. Federal Government. There's a longer list---- Mr. Ruppersberger. I understand. We have other witnesses. I just want to make sure that we understand that we have done so much in identifying the problem; let's get to the implementation. My yellow light has gone on so the quicker you can go, but I probably will not be able to ask you any more questions. Mr. Aftergood. Very quickly, a couple of points. The problem will never be fixed; it will never be over. It will always require continuing oversight, continuing refinement. Therefore, I would say, don't attempt to do too much. Do attempt to get the process started. The other point I would just like to mention quickly is, when I hear trusted information network, I get concerned that, when barriers go down between agencies, they're going up between the Government and the public. So I would say keep in mind the question of public access. Keep in mind the option of allowing a way for the public to gain access to information that it needs sometimes. Mr. Ruppersberger. I would say this, we always sometimes have a tendency to overreact, and we still have to keep our eye on the ball and make sure that information, which can be very dangerous to this country or to the people working for this country, needs to be classified. And really there is an issue that hasn't been discussed, and I think if you can't trust the people with the information, then they shouldn't be in that position. Ms. Haave. Ms. Haave. The first thing that we have to do is to ensure that people are properly classifying information. What you find is, where there are seams, there's friction. So, as you're trying to create a trusted information network that spans the different Government agencies, local, State, etc., what we need are common standards and protocols. For example, the Department of Defense and CIA have recently come to agreement on a metadata standard. Metadata is important so that computers can do for us what takes us a long time to do, and that is parse information with respect to security classifications in a way that people get the information that they are entitled to and not information that they're not. Cross-domain security systems that allow accreditation across domains, not necessarily making one generic network, but having separate networks where the cross-domain security, that governance strategy, is already mandated and agreed to by all, will facilitate that movement of information across the network. There are a number of things that we can do, automated tear-lines, etc., and I think we are down the path of looking at doing all of those things. The DCI runs an Information- Sharing Working Group. There are number of congressionally directed actions that we are looking at with respect to that, and we are making progress toward that. In the end, however, what it requires is that all of us come together with the common standards and protocols to facilitate that sharing, and that's an issue that's above any one Department. Mr. Leonard. Very quickly, sir, the one thing I would recommend being addressed is, as I alluded to before, the issue of unique agency prerogatives, especially those that are legislatively based. We currently have what I refer to as a patchwork quilt of various information protection and sharing regimes, not just in the classified arena but in the unclassified arena as well. We have literally dozens of unclassified--of protection regimes for controlled, unclassified information, many of which date back to the cold war, that we've never revisited. And we add to them every year. We now have controlled critical infrastructure protected information. We have sensitive security information in the transportation field. We have sensitive homeland security information. All these are unique regimes that are being created and unique rules that are being written that will definitely impede when people then try to fuse all these various types of information in a network environment. Mr. Shays. I thank the gentleman. At this time the Chair would recognize Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much. I would first like to speak to the testimony of Mr. Aftergood. In part three of your testimony, you speak of the classification of the historical intelligence budget data, and you also get into the discussion, which Mr. Ruppersberger alluded to, about whether or not intelligence budgets ought to be classified. This is not an arcane question or one that actually can be left solely to the Department of Defense or the Central Intelligence Agency. This is a constitutional matter. We take oaths, not to defend the CIA or the Defense Department; we take an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States. So to provide an appropriate frame for this discussion, let me cite Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution, ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law, and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time.'' The Constitution of the United States makes it very clear, you can't have secret budgets. Our Founders anticipated that the only way to protect a democracy was to have it be open and that we know exactly how the taxpayers' money is being spent. Now, I alluded at the beginning of this hearing to a book called The Sorrows of Empire by Chalmers Johnson. Here's what he says about this article, about Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution. He says, ``This article is one that empowers Congress and makes the United States a democracy. It guarantees the people's representatives will know what the State apparatus is actually doing, and it authorizes full disclosure of these activities. It has not been applied to the Department of Defense or the Central Intelligence Agency since their creation. Instead, there's been a permanent policy of ``don't ask don't tell.'' The White House has always kept the intelligence agencies budget secret, and deceptions in the Defense budget date back to the Manhattan Project of World War II and the secret decisions to build atomic bombs and use them against the Japanese. ``In 1997, then Senator Robert Torricelli, a Democrat of New Jersey, proposed an amendment to the 1998 Defense Authorization Bill requiring that Congress disclose aggregate intelligence expenditures. He lost, but he was able to make the point that the intelligence agencies spend more than the combined gross national products of North Korea, Libya, Iran and Iraq, and they do so in the name of the American people, without any advice or supervision from them,'' from Chalmers Johnson. Now, I want to go a little bit more into this discussion, Mr. Aftergood. What about this? I mean, we are talking about something that is key to the survival of our democracy, are we not? Mr. Aftergood. We are talking about fundamental principles. It's easy to look at this, and think, oh, this is a detail, who really cares anyway. It's a fundamental principle. Budget disclosure is one of only two categories of Government information whose publication is required by the Constitution, and as you correctly say, Government officials don't take oaths to particular agencies. They take oaths to uphold and defend the Constitution. In this area, most Government officials have been derelict. I would add that it's not simply the White House. It's not simply the Bush administration. It's the Clinton administration. It's past administrations. It's the Congress. The last time the matter was voted on in the Congress in 1997, majorities in both the House and Senate voted against budget disclosure. I consider it a serious lapse. I should say that the Constitution doesn't say that everything must be open and must be published right now. It says it must be published from time to time, and that allows the possibility that things could remain secret for a period of time. But when the CIA says that 50-year-old intelligence budgets must remain secret, that tells me that they are acting in bad faith. When the Justice Department defends the CIA, as they are doing now, in Freedom of Information Act litigation against having to disclose such historical information, that tells me they are also acting in bad faith and not in accord with constitutional values. Mr. Kucinich. Thank you. I want to move on to Ms. Haave. Today's headline, Washington Post, Iraqi Teens Abused At Abu Ghraib, Report Finds; Officials say inquiry also confirms prisoners were hidden from aid groups. The article goes on to say among other things that speaking on the condition of anonymity, because the report has not been released, other officials at the Pentagon say the investigation also acknowledges that military intelligence soldiers kept multiple detainees off the recordbooks and hid them from international humanitarian organizations. Now, Ms. Haave, there have been several examples given today of instances where the Department of Defense has acted questionably in classifying information. These include large sections of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on Iraq'sWMD program and the report of General Taguba on Abu Ghraib prison. Did your office make the decisions to classify those reports? Ms. Haave. Sir, my office did not make those decisions. Original classification authorities make those decisions as documents are being prepared. The review for security declassification is also made by the original classifying authority. Mr. Kucinich. Now, this morning's Post that I just pointed out to you points that you have several of these new reports on the Abu Ghraib prison abuse; they're near completion. This one report by Major General Fay describes the use of dogs to attack and frighten detainees, including Iraqi teenagers. So let me just ask you, for the record, will this report be made public, unclassified, in whole, and what about the report of the independent commission led by former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger that is also pending? Ms. Haave. Sir, I have not seen Mr. Schlesinger's report, so I can't answer that question. With respect to the Taguba report, for example, I know there were places where information was classified, and there were other places in the report where that same information was not classified. There is a security review being undertaken today that should be done in the next couple of weeks, and so that security review and its results will be made available to you. With respect to the General Fay report, I also have not seen that report in its entirety. I think large portions of it are unclassified, but again, I have asked, as a result of the interest in these reports, that the original classifying authorities go back and review and be sure that they are classifying properly those portions of the report that are classified, if they are. Mr. Kucinich. Have you ever been involved in keeping things classified as a way of protecting the administration from any embarrassment? Ms. Haave. Sir, I have not. Mr. Kucinich. Now, these instances that we just discussed occurred recently in regard to operations in Iraq, Mr. Tierney pointed out earlier--and he and I have had the opportunity to work together on the issues relating to the testing at the Department of Defense--how you had results withheld from this committee for 8 months relating to the planned National Missile Program, and the report and all 50 recommendations it made were then reclassified, though the report had been publicly available and disseminated before. Do you have any idea why this was done? Ms. Haave. Sir, I don't. I only just learned of this instance yesterday when my staff brought it to my attention. What I am willing to do, however, is to go back and review it, pull the information as best I can and have a conversation with you about what the results are after I do an independent assessment. I know that's not probably satisfying to you. Mr. Kucinich. How long have you been involved in this particular assignment that you have? Ms. Haave. In this assignment, as a deputy under, for about 1 year, sir, and then, prior to that, I was a deputy assistant secretary for security and information. Mr. Kucinich. Are you familiar with the challenges which this committee made to the administration over gaining access and public release of materials with respect to the Missile Defense Program? Ms. Haave. Sir, not always. Typically, what happens---- Mr. Kucinich. Is that a yes or a no? Ms. Haave. Sometimes, I am. For example, with respect to Abu Ghraib right now, I am aware of those things. With respect to missile defense, what happens is that the original classification authority, which in this case is probably the Missile Defense Agency, would handle those. I would not necessarily be apprised of those. Mr. Kucinich. Do you have any oversight over them at all? Do you look at their classification decisions? Ms. Haave. We do have oversight over the Department. Most of that is conducted at multiple levels, decentrally, and so they have a responsibility to assure that their people are properly trained. They have a responsibility to conduct self- inspections and to report. We often will answer questions for them, and we sometimes go and visit. I cannot remember the last time that we had a conversation on this subject with the Missile Defense Agency. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. Chairman, the question that I think needs to be asked here is, who has the final word on classification? I mean, you can chase this thing around a tree forever. Who has the final word on classification, let's say, on the Missile Defense Program? Do you have the final word or don't you? Ms. Haave. No, sir. The Missile Defense Agency has the final word, to the best of my knowledge. What we have done inside the Department, that is a recent change, for example, with respect to the habeas cases at Guantanamo is that we have convened a group of people, for example, from Guantanamo, from SouthCOM, from the office of the Secretary of Defense in order to take on these classification/declassification issues. And where there are impasses, where people cannot come to agreement, those things will now be brought forward to me, and I will make the final classification decision. That is new in the Department of Defense. Mr. Shays. At this time, the Chair would recognize Mr. Tierney. Mr. Tierney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Haave, I don't mean to pick on you, but I do want to followup on this line of thought. First of all, I'm grateful for your offer to look at that information and get back to us. I presume you will do that within a week or two. Ms. Haave. Yes, sir, I will. Mr. Tierney. I'll tell you why, because I think the public needs confidence that this classification system is not being used for political purposes, that it's not being used to demonize somebody or to avoid embarrassment. We have serious issues here, and they are how we're going to apportion our resources and whether we're going to apportion them fighting the cold war and looking backward with a National Missile Defense System that's unproven and untested, or whether we're going to acquire resources for the most immediate threat according to our own intelligence agencies and almost every other independent body that has looked at what our needs are at this point in time. You heard my rendition of how we press this matter, and I want you to know that Mr. Waxman, who is the ranking member of the full Committee on Government Reform, and I sent a letter as far back as March 25th of this year, March 25th to Secretary Rumsfeld objecting to his reclassification of already public information, as well as his classification of a report based on that. And essentially, we found that this is important information. What he is doing is preventing a public debate on this. We can always debate whether that's a system that's necessary or not, but we do need a debate on whether or not it should be going to the field unproven or untested and how much money we are going to spend or how we're going to spend $10 billion. And that's something that the American people need confidence that those decisions are being made. He has not responded yet. So you should know, we can give you a copy of that letter, but since March 25th, they haven't had any hesitation in going forward and saying that they're going to deploy this system and making a big political hullabaloo about it for those that they're interested in satisfying, but they haven't found time to respond to, I think, very legitimate instances. Let me share with you one other aspect you may want to investigate when you look at this. Theodore Postol is a Professor of Science and Technology and National Security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At one point in time, he wrote a letter to the White House that described how the Missile Defense Agency had doctored results of the National Missile Defense test to hide the fact that they could not tell the difference between simple decoys and warheads. He described how the Agency had altered its entire test program to hide that flaw. Subsequently, two General Accounting Office reports issued in March 2002 verified the facts that he had written about to the White House. The way the Agency responded to that was by claiming that it was classified. What it did beyond that was it then sent three agents to deliver a letter to Mr. Postol that was classified as secret. The letter contained nothing more than publicly available information deemed classified by the Government, in his words, so that the Agency could claim that he would be violating security agreements if he continued to speak on the matter of national security. That's pretty extraordinary. That's going to a pretty extreme length, and that's just not a matter of oversight for somebody making a bad decision about that. That's a conscious decision to try and muzzle somebody who had very specific and worthwhile information for the public to know and for us to make determinations on how we're going to allocate our resources. So I hope you will also look into that matter. We can send you some information on that. Will you do that? Ms. Haave. Yes, sir. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. That should make every American concerned about just how these decisions are being made. So with that in mind, and I note, Mr. Aftergood, you had a very nice thought in your report that congressional oversight is necessary and important, but you say it need not be arduous or an elaborate undertaking; it can be as simple as posing a question to the Pentagon. That's not so. We have been posing this question for years and getting stonewalled on it. So I think what we might discuss here is beyond--now, that's the way Government should work and that's the way we'd like this administration to work. They clearly are not working that way, given the lengths to which they go to get Mr. Postol quieted and the fact that we haven't had an answer from March 25th. It took us to 2000 to get this information first to the public domain and then reclassified. What's a better way for congressional oversight--and that's the question I pose to each of the members of the panel--after we have the challenge or the classification determination made within the administration by the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel, ISCAP, which is nothing more than executive officers looking it over, although they have had a pretty good record of ordering some declassification that's not a 100 percent when they don't agree with the public, when the public raises a question about reclassification, and as to declassification, where do they go? What should be Congress' role? How do we get some decent oversight that sticks to what we are trying to do here and not go beyond that? Mr. Leonard, I'll start with you and maybe go left to right. Mr. Leonard. If I understand your question correctly, sir, is, where would the public go after, for example---- Mr. Tierney. Well, when Members of Congress who says we'd like have this declassified, the executive says no, then you have Mr. Aftergood's recommendations, have a nice letter saying, please reconsider and let us know what your thoughts are, and they basically send you off into ether space somewhere. Mr. Leonard. Basically, pursuant to the order right now, you've identified one of the two primary routes individuals have. One is to go through the courts, through the Freedom of Information Act process. Mr. Tierney. What's the record been on that? Is anybody familiar with any court---- Mr. Leonard. My understanding is that almost without exception the courts will always defer to the executive branch. Mr. Tierney. Exactly. Mr. Leonard. And the other process that you alluded to, that's provided for in the Executive order, is to go to this administrative appeals process, to this interagency group which does have at least somewhat of a more favorable record with respect to releasing the information. My experience has been that, when a group of agency representatives get together rather than just the owner of the information, you get a less parochial view of the situation, a more holistic assessment, and I believe, off the top of my head, the historical record is that, approaching 60-some odd percent of the time, the panel will override an agency's determination in whole or in part. Mr. Tierney. I appreciate that account. Now, we get to the point where, in instances, the decision back to thepetition, whether it be a Member of Congress or a member of the public in general, is unsatisfactory, Congress should have a role to play here. That's our oversight responsibility. We've had hearings here. We get stonewalled left and right. So what you're saying, our only response is to subpoena and beat it out of them, and in that sense of the word, ought there to be some statutory change? What's your opinion where we should go from here? Mr. Leonard. The challenge there is that, by and large, the exercise of classification authority has primarily been pursuant to the President's constitutional Article II authorities, and that, of course, would complicate any sort of legislative remedy with respect to ultimate decisions along those lines. Mr. Tierney. So you're saying, nowhere, we're stuck? Mr. Leonard. I do believe that there can be more responsive means by which to resolve disputes. I believe the ISCAP process can be enhanced. I believe---- Mr. Tierney. How would you do that? Mr. Leonard. One of my concerns is the ISCAP process right now is primarily--and I'm not trying to be disparaging here-- but is primarily a hobby horse for historical researchers. And again, that's important that they get that kind of information, but I believe that process can be used for more relevant, more timely information as well, and I believe it can be stepped up, possibly with some sort of specific time limitations for action and with consequences if action is not taken; for example, absent of a decision, such and such would occur. Those types of remedies at least provide for a responsiveness and provide for some consequences if attention and resources are not devoted to that topic. Mr. Tierney. Ms. Haave, since that's in a Presidential Executive order, would you recommend to the President that he take that kind of action and step it up, as Mr. Leonard says, or what would be your remedy for Congress and the American public? Ms. Haave. I think there are a number of things that we can do that are different from how we've been doing this in the past. The first step I just described, within the Department of Defense, for this limited classification review for these reports, but that's not to say that we shouldn't put in place a process whereby that information comes to me or comes to whoever sits in my position or in a different position as decided by the Secretary and is an adjudicator within the Department. That may, in fact, facilitate and speed some of the questions and answers that you appear to want. I think the ISCAP could, in fact, be expanded a bit beyond its typical historical base to do those kinds of adjudication when the Congress is feeling that it's not getting the information that it needs. On that committee sit representatives from each of the agencies. We review the information that's in question. We research it, and we make our decisions. And that could, in fact, for your information, be provided to you. Mr. Tierney. Is my understanding correct that right now ISCAP does not do that? For instance, if the Secretary ever decided to respond to our March 25, 2004, letter, and we wanted to appeal that to ISCAP, we'd be thrown in the pile and maybe never reached at all. Ms. Haave. Mr. Leonard could probably answer this. I don't know that the Congress has ever come to ISCAP and asked for that. Mr. Leonard. There's no reason why that could not be processed according to those procedures. Mr. Tierney. With respect, of course, that then those executives, which would include the Department of Defense Secretary, would then want to respond from that body where they haven't responded individually. Mr. Leonard. That's correct. If I could make one further point, Mr. Congressman, that I neglected to make. There is currently on the statutory books since 2001 a Public Interest Declassification Board. This is an outgrowth of Senator Moynihan's Secrecy Commission. It was his legacy. It does exist on the books, as I say. The administration has taken action to look to appointing some members, but quite frankly, there has been no action from the legislative branch that I'm aware of to appoint their members. And this is an existing forum that does exist that will allow for some of these issues that you addressed to be worked out in such manner. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. Mr. Aftergood. I'm taking license here, Mr. Chairman, for the last two of these. Thank you. Mr. Aftergood. There's a pending proposal that's been introduced in the House and the Senate. In the House, it's H.R. 4855, to create an independent National Security Classification Board, which I believe is intended to serve as a forum to mediate these kinds of disputes. In several ways, it really replicates the Public Interest Declassification Board that Mr. Leonard mentioned, but it's something that's maybe worth considering. To answer your question directly, what to do, I think look at what works and strengthen it. ISCAP works on a small scale. It has led to the declassification of all or part of the majority of disputed cases it has worked on. ISOO, Mr. Leonard's organization, if he will forgive me, works. A couple of months ago, I faxed him, Mr. Leonard, a letter pointing out the Taguba report seemed to be improperly classified. He responded to me the very same day, initiating an investigation and carrying on some work he already had underway. I thought it was an extraordinary response from a Government agency. Nobody responds like that. But ISOO is a tiny organization, particularly when it's compared to the vast expanse of the Government classification system. But look at what works and strengthen it. I would even say that your questions that have been stonewalled are not without effect. I don't think Ted Postol would say that you have accomplished nothing. I would think he would say you have accomplished a great deal by standing up for his interests over a period of years. Regular hearings are very important. I think, perhaps when Mr. Leonard's organization puts out his annual review of the classification system, it might be an opportune time to hold regular oversight hearings on what's going on in the classification system, what's going right, what's going wrong. Harness the courts. The scope of judicial review has shrunken over the years to the point that courts now routinely defer to executive branch agencies. They say, if you say it's classified, that's all we need to know, we're not going to look further. That is not what Congress intended when it enacted the Freedom of Information Act. I think if there is the political will, it would be very desirable if Congress could say our intention is that the courts do real review of classification decisions. That doesn't mean overturn them all the time. It means look at them and see if they make sense. Do not defer. Exercise your judicial function. If that can be accomplished, then a great deal will have been done. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. Mr. Crowell. Mr. Crowell. Mr. Tierney, I think, in fairness to the Markle Foundation, I should say that they have not studied this issue, and I cannot represent them on it, but I do have personal views. Mr. Tierney. Well, let me hear your personal views. Mr. Crowell. First of all, I participated in the Commission on Secrecy that Senator Moynihan conducted, and as a result of some of that participation, I have seen large numbers of Government documents released and declassified. My personal belief is that we have to start with the policies that currently exist and the guidelines that currently exist at the department and agency levels, and we have to refine them and redefine them in some ways in which we emphasize what needs to be released to the public and what must be shared with other agencies in order to conduct the fight on terrorism, as opposed to the current mechanism which is owing it toward what must be protected. Second, guidelines that are completely inconsistent with those policies should be developed in each ag"
