        "text": "Choose A Facility:\n\nCentral State Bank Arena\n\nThe centerpiece of the University of Montevallo athletic program, the Robert M. McChesney Student Activity Center, became the home of the Falcon athletic program in fall of 2004 and houses Central State Bank Arena, home to Women's Basketball, Men's Basketball, Volleyball Wrestling and Acrobatics & Tumbling. The $11 million facility opened its doors on Sunday, Aug. 29, 2004, and was dedicated on Thursday, Oct. 14, 2004 during the annual Founder's Day ceremonies.\n\nThe facility was showcased to a national audience when the Falcons hosted Clayton State University in a men's basketball contest Feb. 16, 2013 on CBS Sports Network, which marked the first ever nationally televised sporting event broadcast from the University of Montevallo campus.\n\nThe dreams for the showcase facility and the road to its completion covered many years of planning and building. Long-time employees of the University can recall discussion of the need for a facility such as this one many years ago. In 2000, when Will Phillips and Meredith Glover were SGA president and vice president, respectively, the vision toward making the dreams a reality began to take shape. During this time there was much discussion among students with then-UM President McChesney regarding the adequacy of existing facilities on campus. Students also recognized the need for good facilities when it came to things such as recruitment and retention, as well as the need for creating weekend activities on campus and providing a space large enough that family and friends could attend spring commencement even if the weather failed to cooperate.\n\nIn February 2000, McChesney, Eddye Lawley (now retired director of the physical plant) and Roy Culberson (former athletic director) approached the SGA Senate with the suggestion for a convocation center.It would be a place that could provide opportunities not currently available on UM's campus. It would be a place that could house major events and attractions, and where students and other members of the University community could go to exercise, socialize and cheer for the Falcons.\n\nOn March 5, 2000, the SGA Senate passed a resolution stating its desire for a convocation center and a willingness to partner with UM to pay half the cost of the facility. The funds would come from an increase in the student activity fee. On Feb. 15, 2002, almost two years after the SGA Senate had voted to pass the resolution that gave the green light to the project, the Board of Trustees approved the sale of bonds that would allow the construction of the facility to begin. Bond sales commenced immediately after the conclusion of the meeting.\n\nMcKee and Associates of Montgomery was selected as the architectural firm to design the Center. The architects followed strict guidelines that would assure the successful blending of a completely modern facility with the historical structures already on campus. Architectural features from some of Montevallo's well-known buildings, such as Ramsay and Palmer halls, were incorporated into the exterior design, as was a red brick walkway that leads visitors to the entranceway. McCrory Building Company of Birmingham won the bid to be the contractor for the project.\n\nGroundbreaking took place at the University's annual Founders' Day ceremonies in October. On that day, the turning of 16 shovelfuls of earth marked the beginning of the construction phase of the project.\n\nThe first building to be constructed on campus since the mass communication building was completed in 1991, the 97,000-square foot structure seemingly rose from the spot that was formerly a golf driving range on College Drive.\n\nA defining facility on the historic campus, the state-of-the-art McChesney Student Activity Center reflects the vitality of student life at the University and stands to serve as a focal point of interests and activities on campus.\n\nThe first facility of its kind at the University of Montevallo, the Center provides recreational facilities that have never before existed at this level on this campus. Inside, there is a 2,000 seat multi-use arena for athletic events and up to 3,500 seats for indoor convocations. In addition, a weight training/cardiovascular facility, six racquetball courts and a 25-yard pool for water fitness provide ample recreational opportunities for UM students, faculty and staff. Winding its way around the arena on the second floor is an indoor walking track, while the administrative and coaching offices are located at the front of the facility.\n\nTeams have six fully equipped locker rooms, with a state-of-the art athletic training facility nearby, with sufficient room to tend to the medical needs of the many student-athletes who utilize it. In addition, two separate locker rooms are available for students, faculty and staff use during the building's regular operating hours.\n\nWith the completion of this facility, students have unprecedented opportunities for recreation and fitness, the classical complement to the liberal arts environment for which Montevallo is known.\n\nSupport for the McChesney Student Activity Center is recognized at sites throughout the Center.
