        "text": "September 5, 2004 /Live at WREK/ 7pm-9pm\n\nOn the first Sunday of every month, at 7 p.m., Eyedrum does a show on WREK that features nuggets from Eyedrum's archive of live performances.\n\nThis month (Sunday, Sep. 5th) we return to WREK's fancy new digs with material from the Brian Montero / Pony Law / White Magic event recorded at eyedrum earlier this year. Brian Montero is a local guitarist/musician, mostly known for Vastopol, a duo project with Alex Lambert on drums, and Pony Law is Matt Proctor, basically southern gothic/surrealist folk music. White Magic is a rock trio from New York. We'll also have some excerpts from a Triage performance recorded back in 2001 at Earthshaking Music; they're a Chicago jazz combo and playing Eyedrum on Sep. 11th. Tune in and check it all out.\n\nAnd remember that, after the show airs, you can always listen to this and any recent Sunday Special via WREK's 7-day archive if you forget to tune in\n\n(direct links to Sunday Special streams: lo-fi or hi-fi).\n\nSeptember 10, 2004 / Lo-Fi, curated by Travis Pack / 7 pm - 10pm\n\nThe Lo-Fi show was conceived to showcase local and national artists working in the Lo-Fi genre. Lo-Fi is a term borrowed from the musical or technological realm and applied to fine art in part to recognize a specific movement in the outsider art arena. Taking influences from folk art, self-taught art, art brut, neo-expressionism and other outsider territories, Lo-Fi artists employ the same sensibility of lowbrow techniques that require only the most basic materials and a style that covets a rough yet somehow elaborate simplicity and rudimentary aesthetic over all else.\n\nThis show will feature seven such artists of slightly different styles and techniques, but who all incorporate Lo-Fi ideals and methods into their work. These artists are of different backgrounds and have different levels of education, but the work was found to have certain similarities that allow them to transcend the typicality of a traditionally themed \"outsider art\" show and set them apart as playing a new role in the world of the outsider.\n\nLo-Fi artists often strive to connect to their audience on a raw emotional level, not by means of ultimate refinement or picture perfect representation, but through a more unprocessed, nearly primitive approach. While the crudeness of style is visually persistent, a fundamental intelligence exists below the surface, a cleverness that differentiates them from their folk-like influences. Reacting to the bigger-slicker-faster-equals-better mindset that often finds itself seated at the core of our modern society, Lo-Fi artists choose to slow down, to position personal style over perfection, to allow sincerity to replace digital savvy, not in order to debunk technological advancement or eschew sophistication, but to offer a balanced expression as counterpart. Nostalgia often plays its part in the raw approach of the Lo-Fi style allowing the past to interact with the present and dispel the notion that the future will be a cold and empty place where binary code reigns over emotional content and intellectual complexity over cultural significance.\n\nIn a world connected by the World Wide Web and tempted by the boundless prospect of commercial space flight and in a time filled with cool and calculated social intricacies that have become so necessary to our existence, it is the Lo-Fi tones that keep us grounded in the underlying lattice of our emotional roots and the limited warmth of our human soil.\n\nEXHIBITION\n\nThe Lo-Fi Show will take place between September 10th and October 15th of 2004 in eyedrum's main gallery. An opening reception will be held on September 10th from 7-10pm.\n\nLECTURE\n\nA lecture, \"what is Lo-Fi?\" will be held on the Thursday following the reception with artists talks and a subsequent question and answer period from 7-8pm.\n\nTHE LO-FI SHOW ARTISTS\n\nJon Ciliberto, Atlanta, GA sound/installation\n\nPj Fidler, Hollywood, CA painting\n\nEric Gilyard, Atlanta, GA sound/painting/sculpture\n\nHarrison Keys, Atlanta, GA Painting/installation\n\nScott Lawrence, Atlanta, GA drawings/sculpture\n\nMegan Lillie Miami, FL tactile fabric sketches\n\nRyan Wallace, Brooklyn, NY Painting\n\nMichi, Atlanta, GA Painting\n\nSeptember 11, 2004 / Triage + Black Love (tight bros network presents)\n\nTriage is one of the most active young bands on the improvised music scene in Chicago today. Initially conceived by Dave Rempis on saxophones, Triage has worked regularly for the last five years, performing throughout Chicago at venues such as the Empty Bottle, the Velvet Lounge, 3030, the Hothouse, the Nervous Center, and the Hungry Brain, honing their approach to music that is currently undergoing a great renaissance in this city. They’ve also completed two lengthy US Tours in the last two years, receiving widespread critical acclaim for their work. With Jason Ajemian on bass and Tim Daisy on drums, the group has been key to defining the sound of a new generation of Chicago improvisers.\n\nAs a trio, these three combine to create wide-ranging forms of musical expression. Performing original compositions almost exclusively, the band moves through quiet textural pieces, grooving jazz-oriented tunes, and wailing, expressionistic romps with equal ability. Using these compositions as a springboard for their improvisations, they manage to combine the rhythmic sensibilities of the American jazz and free jazz tradition with the more abstract spaces frequently associated with European improvisers. The reconstitution of stylistic elements from these disparate traditions sheds\n\nlight on both of them in a unique and powerful way.\n\nBlack Love\n\nSummer 2001, Georgia, USA. Rich Hudson hadn't been in a band since the demise of Atlanta's \"BOB\" in '99. Brian Cook left the Atlanta music scene in the mid 90s after bass-ing for Pineal Ventana, The Titanics and Accustat. Taste here the swampy electronic provocations shrouded in humorous pop unpleasantness. But, \"Don't be alarmed, It's just a house trying to look like a space ship\".\n\nSeptember 17, 2004 / music / DP3 + Jeff McLeod + Eric Hinds duo / 9:00 pm\n\nDP3\n\n\"DP3 is a quartet composed of musicians schooled in various genres who have come together to make adventurous yet accessible improvised music. While their music is loosely categorized as acid jazz, they have drawn\n\ncomparisons to acts as diverse as Bitches Brew era Miles Davis, King Crimson, and Dead Can Dance.\"\n\nTrumpet - Andrew Boring\n\nBass - Kareem Khalifa\n\nDrums - Davis Petterson\n\nPaul Mercer - violin\n\nhttp://www.dp3online.com\n\nJeff McLeod\n\nMontgomery, AL's Jeff McLeod will be improvising on the Chapman Stick, dredging up sheets of raw sound from the shared subconcious mind . . . music and non-music meeting to make something a little darker than the normal air (and much louder). Visit Jeff's website for more info: www.soundandchaos.com\n\nErik Hinds\n\nErik Hinds of Athens, Georgia is active as a composer, performer, and promoter of a wide range of music. His upcoming albums are 'Appalachian Trance Metal,' incorporating all of the above, and a song by song (piece by piece?) solo rendition of Slayer's 'Reign In Blood.' He has played with William Buchanan, Chris Cutler, Ernesto Diaz-Infante, the Eastern Seaboard, Lisle Ellis, Drew Gardner, the Georgia Guitar Quartet, Vinny Golia, Frank Gratkowski, Jeff Grove, Carl Ludwig Huebsch, Harald Kimmig, Peter Kowald, Craig Lieske, Marshall Marrotte, Larry Ochs, Brian Osborne, Ravi Padmanabha, Julie Powell, Dave Rempis, Roger Ruzow, Blaise and Robyn Siwula, Carl Smith, Sandor Szabo, Ken Vandermark, Eric Zinman, and his own SS Puft Quartet among others. Erik plays quartertone electric guitar and the H'arpeggione, an upright instrument with 12 sympathetic strings. His current groups are the Erik Hinds/ Jeff Reilly duo and Kyle Dawkins' Walls became the world. Erik lives in a solar-powered house with his wife (and dog) and runs Solponticello Records.\n\nContact Erik Hinds at info@solponticello.com\n\nSeptember 19, 2004 / film / The Gadabout Traveling Film Festival\n\nThe Gadabout Traveling Film Festival\n\n$10\n\nWhat's the Gadabout All About? The Gadabout is a nationally touring film festival that seeks to open new avenues of distribution for truly independent filmmakers that get pushed aside by Hollywood and the commercial film festival circuit. Focusing on short, mostly \"low to no budget\" films, the Gadabout offers an alternative to the cliche world of commercial film. Whether they are amateur, or recent film school grads, our filmmakers love what they are doing, and their work shows it. The Gadabout is NOT a competition, rather a celebration of indendent film and video.\n\nAbove all, the Gadabout is super cool. We tour in a van, and show amazing films to our new friends we get to meet while traveling.\n\nWe have completed 2 national tours and have screened the works of filmmakers from all over the country, and the world (India, Singapore, Australia, Argentina, Isreal, and the U.K.). Independent in every sense, these films share the same willingness to challenge the conventions set for commercial filmmaking.\n\nThis is filmmaking as an artform.\n\nThe Gadabout is growing even more! This year we will be touring with live music by hyper-pop favorites, The Kiss Ups, a stencil art show, a zine distro, and a book tour by our friend Jacinta Bunnell, (Girls Will Be Boys Will Be Girls Will Be... and the Girls Are Not Chicks coloring books.) For some dates this year we will include a program facilitating people of all ages to make their own films, art, zines, etc. So we are growing into a total indie-media extravaganza!\n\nwww.gadaboutfilmfest.com\n\npsiScience, Magic, Blues\n\nJaime Fennelly - electronics\n\nChris Forsyth - guitar\n\nFritz Welch - drums, cymbals & objects\n\nRecorded March 29th, 2003 at WKCR, NYC by Jacob Danziger\n\ncontact - chris@evolvingear.com\n\nwww.evolvingear.com\n\nwww.antiopic.com/allegorical/september2003.html\n\nwww.fluxartspace.org/gallery/album85/psigroup\n\n\"(psi) retains an overall warmth that separates them from the experimental pack.\" - BUFFALO (NY) ARTVOICE, April 2003\n\n\"psi makes landscapes of creepy music.\" - WASHINGTON DC CITYPAPER\n\n\"a weird, subversive, static melange of sounds\" - ALL MUSIC GUIDE, www.allmusic.com\n\n\"a very beautiful album of full-bodied and resistant electro-acoustics rather than the evanescent and whispered school like we otherwise often hear.

Milt Jones - percussion, etc.\n\nPresented by Euphonic Productions\n\nOpen to the public, this multi-media event is a tribute to the volunteers who donated their time and talents to the locally-produced film Psychopathia Sexualis. The evening will include the debut of a 2 1/2-minute trailer of the film (now in post-production), as well as performances by Paul Mercer, Clobber, and DJ Grant Aaron.\n\nPAUL MERCER\n\nThe score of Psychopathia Sexualis is written and performed by Paul Mercer, the violinist best known for his work with the acclaimed ethereal neoclassical 5-piece, The Changelings. Mercer will perform selections from his forthcoming CD \"Ghosts.\" Inspired by the instruments themselves, the pieces evoke the individual history of the instrument, whether it be an 18th-century viola d'amore or an early Italian violin that spent part of its lifetime in Colonial India. The compositions feature electronically prepared antique violins, viola, and other \"stringed\" instruments such as tampura and autoharp.\n\nCLOBBER\n\nClobber has referred to itself as \"the best punk fuckin' rock band of all time that will ever fuckin' be ever.\" This claim will be tested in a rare appearance of what can only be called one of Atlanta's most notorious \"live\" acts.\n\nGRANT AARON\n\nGrant has been the driving force behind Lifeform Project, a collective of electronic musicians and multimedia artists from Atlanta. LFP began 4 years ago as an outlet for a group of musicians with a general love of electronic music, which quickly developed into a production entity. This organization has been an integral part of the experimental electronic music scene in Atlanta, providing a means for development and exposure for unknown talent.\n\nTHE SHADOW OF SERGEANT BERTRAND\n\nCelebrated puppeteer Jason Hines (co-creator of the Center for Puppetry Arts' recent hit Avanti, Da Vinci!) will present a special live performance of one of the most unconventional sequences in Psychopathia Sexualis. Presented in the fashion of a Victorian-era shadow puppet show, it depicts the life and crimes of Sergeant Bertrand, the notorious necrophile of 19th-century Paris.\n\nDoors open at 7:00, $7 to the public\n\nSeptember 26, 2004 / The Microphones + Woelv + [Wilson+Heath] (speakeasy presents)\n\nThe Microphones\n\n\"In school one of the outlets I found was music. Making tapes and loud noise and staying up late and getting into coffee and cookies. Anacortes is (to me) in a beautiful place and I have always loved it here, and been creeped out in a really good way in the black forest at night. Once I realized that it was possible to make songs and books and pictures about this sweet creepiness, and not do any other \"work\", my life got hyperactive.\n\nBeginning in 1995 I recorded tapes by myself on borrowed machines and got deeper into the world. In 1997 I moved to Olympia Wash. and did the same thing and lived among friends who were all older than me. For 5 years I stayed there, living in different houses and always recording at the Dub Narcotic studio in the K compound. The idea that I could also travel around and sing and dance in front of people, and get enough money to live did not occur to me. I traveled around a lot anyway, and I got enough money to live. I ate dinner with my friends every single night. I worked on albums for 1 year each before releasing them, usually beginning work at dawn. I did 4 albums in this way under the band name \"the Microphones\", and also many other more marginal music projects and books and souvenirs. This all culminated in the \"death\" themed album \"Mount Eerie\".\n\nIn 2002 I went on an endless tour and stopped for the winter in northern Norway and died. The next spring I returned and pretended I was a different person and a different \"band\" and \"artist\" and \"singer\" and everything. I began calling my songs \"Mt. Eerie\" songs and working slowly on a new idea: dark mountain, mount eerie, cold songs, grandmother's face, and so on.\n\nI moved back to Anacortes where a renaissance had begun again (finally!). Now I live here and I am enjoying it. I am still constantly traveling, playing weird shows everywhere, and making up songs. I also am recording and releasing records by my friends, whose music I love.\"\n\nWoelv\n\nwoelv is only really one person, me, genevieve, i have had the chance to have my friends helping out a lot with recording and adding an instrument to the nakedness of my voice and simple guitar parts.\n\nWilson + Heath\n\nHomoerotic noise provocateurs from Cobb County.\n\nPresented by SPEAKEASY PRODUCTIONS"
