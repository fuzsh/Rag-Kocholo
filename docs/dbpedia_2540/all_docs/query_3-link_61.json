        "text": "Client:\n\nPalmerston North City Council\n\nThe Showgrounds (now Central Energy Trust Arena) opened in 1886, holds a special place in the heart of Papaoiea, Palmerston North. Home to 28th MƒÅori Battalion and WW1 military operations, the A&P Association, and now recreation hub for the Central region, the Arena is a leading multi-use sports and events complex hosting over 3000 diverse events every year.\n\nWT provided Palmerston North City Council with Programme & Project Management and Quantity Surveying services for Central Energy Trust Arena (CETA) Redevelopment which included a new artificial turf, speedway pits, ablution block, plaza entry and a future grandstand.\n\nWT reviewed and recommended adjustments to the Annual Plan to reduce the delivery from 4 years to 2 years, resulting in a cost saving of approximately $1.5m in forecast cost escalation. Three budgets were then merged to provide further delivery efficiencies.\n\nAwards:\n\nCETA and project partners were recognised at the Best Awards 2021 in multiple categories, winning 3 awards."
