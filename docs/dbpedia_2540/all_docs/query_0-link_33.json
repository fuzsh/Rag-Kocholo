        "text": "When you live in the greatest state in America during the fall, there is no better place to spend your Saturdays than Mountaineer Field at Milan Puskar Stadium.\n\nThe Mountaineer Mantrip signals the start of the day as the team arrives at the stadium. As the players prepare to start their work day, the band and cheerleaders lead them into the stadium as they show their love to the greatest fans around.\n\nPrior to entering the locker room, they touch a piece of coal, paying respect to the hard-working, blue-collar people who travel down to the mine on their mantrip to begin their work day.\n\nAs the Mountaineers begin their warmup routine, 60,000 fans leave their designated tailgate areas and pack the double-tiered structure.\n\nThe faithful welcomes \"The Pride of West Virginia\" as its music and choreographed performance prepares and excites everyone in anticipation of the game.\n\nThe stadium starts to rock as the ball is kicked off and doesn't stop as each score is celebrated until another WVU victory is signaled with the playing of \"Take Me Home, Country Roads.\"\n\nEach fan has an unobstructed view of the playing field and there's not a bad seat in the house. Plenty of restrooms, concession and souvenir stands add to the fan comfort of the facility. Lights for exciting night games, ADA seating and plenty of room for tailgating add to the stadium's list of first-class accessories.\n\nA touch of class and history was added at the north end of the complex in 2018 with the addition of the Mountaineer Legends Park. As fans journey into the stadium, walking through the park, they stroll down memory lane, gleaning information and remembering memories about each legend who helped build and shape the history and tradition of WVU football. Each of these legends are also on display throughout the stadium concourse on the pillars of the stadium for fans to see.\n\nMulti-million dollar facelifts took place on the east side in 2016 and west side in 2017, widening the concourses and constructing entrance gates, as well as adding and modernizing the concession venues and restroom facilities. Funding was made available through a $75 million facilities bond, $25 million in private donations through the Mountaineer Athletic Club and $6 million from West Virginia's multimedia rights contract with IMG.\n\nA new playing surface, FieldTurf Revolution 2.5, was installed in 2016, giving West Virginia one of the country's safest and most comfortable surfaces. It has been highly regarded for its softness, durability, safety and lack of abrasiveness.\n\nJust above the skyboxes on the west side is the West Virginia press box. Complete with a dining area, private booths and a camera deck, the spacious three-story structure gives media a great place to cover Mountaineer football.\n\nBelow the press box, 12 luxurious stadium suites under the camera deck offer reception, dining, kitchen, restroom and seating areas to WVU fans, providing a great view of the playing field and the entire facility. An additional set of 18 stadium suites in a two-story structure were completed in the north end zone in time for the 2004 season, giving more fans and businesses an opportunity to socialize and enjoy games in first-class comfort - offering WVU a great way to generate revenue, increase ADA accessible seating and restrooms, and update the look of the stadium. South end zone suites were constructed and in use for the 2008 season.\n\nIn 2017, a new, HD video board was added in the north end of the stadium. The boards provide additional live action, replays, statistics, scores, in-game entertainment and advertisements.\n\nThe new high definition video board that sits atop Touchdown Terrace is 37.2 feet high by 97.2 feet long for a total of 3,616 square feet. The square footage dwarfs the current board, which is 23.6 feet high by 85 feet long for a total of 2,006 square feet.\n\nLight-emitting diode (LED) boards run down each sideline and provides in-game statistics, scoring, messaging and sponsor advertising. Facia LED boards also were implemented along the bottom of the stadium and in each end zone through West Virginia's IMG agreement, as well as new graphic coverage on the stadium's field walls, giving a much-needed updated look to the edifice.\n\nIn 2020, a substantially larger 44' H x 134' W south end zone 12mm Surface Mount (SMD) LED videoboard was installed. It increased the former board's footprint by 20-feet in height and 50-feet in length â€“ and upgraded east and west ribbon displays were added. Boasting 8,500 square feet of LED, the new multimedia displays will showcase the action on the field, and in between plays, in grander fashion and higher quality. A new state-of-the-art sound system also was installed, giving fans a higher-quality experience to their game day.\n\nTop 20 Football Crowds"
