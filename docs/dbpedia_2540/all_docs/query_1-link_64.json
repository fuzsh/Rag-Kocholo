        "text": "The American Idiot World Tour was a worldwide concert tour by the band Green Day, lasting from July 29, 2004 to December 17, 2005. The tour was to help show support for their newly released album, American Idiot across its 161 shows from North America, Europe, Oceania and Asia. It remains both the band's longest tour and the biggest tour by the number of shows.\n\nBackground[]\n\nPrior to the release of American Idiot, Green Day first live premiered the singles \"American Idiot\" and \"Jesus of Suburbia\" at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, California with later live premiering the entire album at the Fonda in Los Angeles, 5 days before the album was set to be released. The second round of shows in North America, which would become the fifth leg in the tour was announced near the end of the second leg in Europe in February of 2005. The third round of shows in North America, which would become the seventh leg in the tour was announced in May of 2005 near the end of the fifth leg. The tour wrapped up with a final leg with two shows in Oceania.\n\nThe tour would also be supported by opening artists with a total of 7 different bands preforming different shows. These included bands like My Chemical Romance, Simple Plan, Jimmy Eat World and Against Me! Since there wasn't a set schedule for bands to preform opening acts, one show could have multiple artists opening while the next show could have no opening artists present. For most of the shows throughout the tour, only Green Day would be present with no opening acts.\n\nBullet in a Bible[]\n\nDuring leg sixth of the tour on the second round of Europe concerts, the band recorded the live album Bullet in a Bible during the June 18–19 concerts at the National Bowl in Milton Keynes, England where over 130,000 people attended the event. It would be released on November 15, 2005 with a majority of songs on the set list present within the album.\n\nSet List[]\n\nThroughout most of the tour, Green Day's set list remained consistent with most concerts featuring the most recognized songs from American Idiot, mixed in with other big hits. An average set list would contain around 15 songs from various albums, with an encore containing 4 various other songs. Some shows however, especially in earlier legs of the tour, would sometimes play the entirety of the album as the set list. The following is a incomplete list of most fully-played songs during the tour.\n\n\"2000 Light Years Away\" \"All By Myself\" \"American Idiot\" \"Are We the Waiting\" \"Basket Case\" \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" (Ramones cover) \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" \"Brain Stew\" \"Christie Road\" \"Dancing With Myself\" (Generation X Cover) \"Disappearing Boy\" \"Dominated Love Slave\" \"Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)\" (Buzzcocks cover) \"Extraordinary Girl\" \"Geek Stink Breath\" \"Give Me Novacaine\" \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" \"Hitchin' a Ride\" \"Holiday\" \"Homecoming\" \"I Fought The Law\" (The Crickets cover) \"J.A.R. (Jason Andrew Relva)\" \"Jaded\" \"Jesus of Suburbia\" \"King for a Day\" \"Knowledge\" (Operation Ivy cover) \"Letterbomb\" \"Longview\" \"Maria\" \"Minority\" \"Nice Guys Finish Last\" \"She\" \"She's a Rebel\" \"Shout\" (The Isley Brothers cover) \"St. Jimmy\" \"Stand By Me\" (Ben E. King cover) \"Waiting\" \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\" \"We Are the Champions\" (Queen cover) \"Welcome to Paradise\" \"Whatsername\" \"When I Come Around\"\n\n[]\n\nDate City Country Venue Leg 1 -
