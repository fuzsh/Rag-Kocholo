Supports assigning network interfaces to provide iSCSI services

Supports Global iSCSI CHAP to authenticate both connection and discovery sessions

Supports FUA and Sync Cache SCSI commands to lower the risk of data loss or file system crash

Supports buffered I/O and direct I/O principles

Supports moving LUNs across volumes

Supports VASA to allow users to check the types of hard drives (HDD/SSD) in VMware vSphere

Supports the Fibre Channel protocol to provide high performance and stable storage for your SAN environment

Compatible FC adapter

Applied models

Supports grouping multiple initiators to manage their access to LUNs

Snapshot Replication: Offsite snapshot replication and recovery

Synology Hyper Backup: Scheduled tasks to back up LUNs to local shared folders, external devices or another Synology NAS

Synology High Availability (SHA): Ensures the reliability of LUN and iSCSI services

VMware Site Recovery Manager: Allows administrators to enable disaster recovery directly via VMware vCenter Server, simplifying - complicated configurations and optimizing the process

Limitations

The maximum number of LUNs, targets, and snapshots varies according to models (Refer to the software specifications of your Synology products)

iSCSI LUN Clone/Snapshot are only available on specific models (Refer to the software specifications of your Synology products)

Snapshots and space reclamation are not supported on Thick Provisioned LUNs

Only Thin Provisioned LUNs created on Btrfs volumes on DSM 6.2 and above versions support instant snapshot and restoration

Maximum number of concurrent LUN backup tasks: 1

Minimum LUN size: 1 GB

Minimum legacy advanced LUN size on ext4 volumes: 10 GB

Defragmentation is only supported on Thin Provisioned Btrfs LUNs

LUNs with the snapshot feature enabled or legacy advanced LUNs can be cloned quickly only within the same volume

Converting legacy advanced LUNs will also delete the snapshots of the LUNs

Discovery with CHAP authentication is not supported

Only legacy advanced LUNs support three modes for space reclamation
