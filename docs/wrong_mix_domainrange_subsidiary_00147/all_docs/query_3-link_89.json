Again\n\n2020 Mar 30 – System Optimization – Citrix Optimizer in WEM 2003\n\n2020 Mar 25 – WEM Agent Settings – added link to Citrix Blog Post Workspace Environment Management agent caching explained\n\nOverview\n\nWorkspace Environment Management (WEM) is Citrix’s Performance Management and UEM (User Environment Management) tool for all XenApp/XenDesktop Enterprise or Platinum Customers with active Software Maintenance (Subscription Advantage is not sufficient). The WEM Agent is supported on XenApp 6.5, and XenApp/XenDesktop 7.x. Videos:\n\nHal Lange demonstrates Citrix WEM Performance Optimizations in a YouTube video\n\nYouTube video XenTegra Citrix Workspace Environment Management (WEM) Webinar\n\nCUGC Welcome to Citrix Workspace Environment Management (WEM) – Hal Lange, CTP Steve Greenberg, CTP Carl Webster\n\nNote: WEM does not replace Citrix Profile Management. You usually implement both.\n\nCitrix Blog Post User Experience on Steroids: Citrix Workspace Environment Management has a list of Frequently Asked Questions about WEM, including a drawing of the architecture.\n\nFrom Hal Lange at Database sizing at Citrix Discussions: SQL Always On is fully supported. In WEM 1909 and older, the ONE caveat is to remove from the Always On Availability Group before upgrading.\n\nHere are the official calculations from the Norskale days on space needed on the SQL Server:\n\nReserve 1GB of RAM per 1,000 users deployed\n\nRAM=1.5GB system + (1.5GB SQL + 1 GB per 1,000 users) for that SQL instance\n\nDisk = 1GB per 10,000 users per year + 10 MB per WEM site configured\n\nUpgrade WEM\n\nThere is no LTSR version of Citrix Workspace Environment Management (WEM), so you should always upgrade to the latest version of WEM.\n\nFrom Upgrade a deployment at Citrix Docs: In-place upgrades from versions earlier than Workspace Environment Management 4.7 to version 1808 or later are not supported. To upgrade from any of those earlier versions, you need to upgrade to version 4.7 first and then upgrade to the target version.\n\nIf you want to upgrade a WEM deployment earlier than 2006 to 2209 or later: To avoid database upgrade failures, upgrade to 2103 first and then to 2209 or later.\n\nCTA Marco Hofmann at CUGC: How-To: Update Citrix Workspace Environment Management (WEM) from 4.x to 4.7 (v4.07.00.00)\n\nTo upgrade Citrix WEM:\n\nIn-place upgrade the Citrix Licensing Server. No special instructions.\n\nEnsure the installed licenses a non-expired Subscription Advantage date.\n\nBefore you upgrade, run WEM Infrastructure Service Configuration Utility and record all settings.\n\nIn-place upgrade the WEM Server. No special instructions.\n\nUse the Database Maintenance tool to upgrade the WEM database.\n\nIn WEM 1909 and older, before upgrading the database that’s in a SQL Server Always On availability group, you must remove it from the availability group. This is no longer required in WEM 1912 and newer.\n\nYou might have to run the WEM Infrastructure Service Configuration Utility on each WEM Server to point to the upgraded database. If the settings are still there, then just click Save Configuration.\n\nIn-place upgrade the WEM Console. No special instructions.\n\nIn-place upgrade the WEM Agents.\n\nSrinivasan Shanmugam at WEM Agent v4.5 Upgrade Issues at CUGC mentioned that you might have to delete Agent’s local database.\n\nInstall/Upgrade WEM Server (Infrastructure Service)\n\nThere is no LTSR version of Citrix Workspace Environment Management (WEM), so you should always upgrade to the latest version of WEM.\n\nThe WEM Infrastructure Service can be installed on one or more servers, but Citrix says don’t install it on Delivery Controllers. The WEM Agent cannot be installed on the Infrastructure Service server.\n\nAnother option: CTP James Kindon explains how to install WEM Server on Windows Server Core\n\nA WEM Server with 4 vCPU and 8 GB RAM can support up to 3,000 users.\n\nPort 8288 – WEM 1912 and newer have a new port 8288 for WEM Agent Cache Synchronization. You’ll need to add this port to your load balancer and open it in your firewall.\n\nPort 8285 is still available for WEM Agents 2012 and older connecting to newer WEM Servers.\n\nOld port removed – The Cache synchronization port (8285) was removed from WEM Server 2103 and newer, so make sure your existing agents are a version that supports the newer Cached data synchronization port. WEM Agent 1912 and newer should be sufficient.\n\nIf your existing WEM Agents don’t support the new port number, then upgrade your WEM Server to version 2012 (or version 1912), upgrade your WEM Agents to the corresponding version, and then upgrade the WEM Server to a newer version.\n\nDownload Workspace Environment Management 2402 and extract it.\n\nIf you are upgrading, run WEM Infrastructure Service Configuration Utility and record all settings. These settings might be wiped out during the upgrade.\n\nLicenses – make sure your installed CVAD licenses have a CSS date that is later than the date required by your WEM version. The required CSS date is shown at the top of the WEM download page.\n\nRun the downloaded Citrix Workspace Environment Management Infrastructure Services Setup.exe from the 2402-01-00-01 folder.\n\nCheck the box next to I agree to the license terms and click Install.\n\nIn the Welcome to the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Infrastructure Services Setup Wizard page, click Next.\n\nIn the Destination Folder page, click Next.\n\nIn the Ready to install Citrix Workspace Environment Management Infrastructure Services page, click Install.\n\nIn the Completed the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Infrastructure Services Setup Wizard page, click Finish.\n\nClick Launch Database Management Utility.\n\nAntivirus – C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Citrix\\Workspace Environment Management Infrastructure Services and C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Norskale\\Norskale Infrastructure Services must be excluded from Antivirus scanning. Or exclude: Norskale Broker Service.exe; Norskale Broker Service Configuration Utility.exe; Norskale Database Management Utility.exe.\n\nIf you are upgrading, then make sure your WEM Service Account has Full control permissions on the DBSync folder at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Norskale\\Norskale Infrastructure Services\\DBSync. For new installs, WEM should set this permission correctly once the Infrastructure Services are configured. Note: this folder seems to be missing in newer versions of WEM.\n\nFirewall – Ensure firewall allows the following ports to/from the WEM Infrastructure Service servers. See Citrix Tech Zone Communication Ports Used by Citrix Technologies.\n\nAgent Port – defaults to TCP 8286 – from WEM Agent to WEM Infrastructure Service\n\nAgentSyncPort – defaults to TCP 8285 – from WEM Agent to WEM Infrastructure Service\n\nCached data synchronization port – defaults to TCP 8288 – from WEM Agent 1912 and newer to WEM Infrastructure Service\n\nAdminPort – defaults to TCP 8284 – from WEM Admin Console to WEM Infrastructure Service\n\nMonitoring Port – defaults to TCP 8287 – from Director to WEM Infrastructure Service\n\nAgentPort – defaults to TCP 49752 – from WEM Infrastructure Service to WEM Agent\n\nUpgrade WEM Database\n\nWorkspace Environment Management has PowerShell commands. For details, see Citrix Workspace Environment Management SDK at Citrix Developer docs.\n\nTo upgrade the Workspace Environment Management database using the GUI tool:\n\nIf this is a new install, skip to Create WEM Database.\n\nThe person running Database Management must be a sysadmin on the SQL Server. Or you can enter a SQL login.\n\nOn the WEM server, run Database Management from the Start Menu.\n\nIf upgrading, in the ribbon, click Upgrade Database.\n\nIn WEM 1906 and newer, the fields might already be filled in. Otherwise:\n\nEnter the SQL Server Name.\n\nEnter the existing WEM Database Name.\n\nConfigure the credentials for the WEM service account.\n\nIf your account is not a sysadmin on SQL, then enter a SQL account in the Database Credentials fields.\n\nClick Upgrade.\n\nClick Yes when asked to proceed.\n\nClick OK when prompted that database upgraded successfully.\n\nClick Finish to close the Database Upgrade Wizard.\n\nClose the WEM Database Management Utility.\n\nOpen services.msc and restart the Citrix WEM Infrastructure Service or restart Norskale Infrastructure Service.\n\nAfter the database is upgraded, run the WEM Infrastructure Service Configuration Utility.\n\nIf the upgrade preserved the settings, then simply click Save Configuration. The service won’t start unless you do this.\n\nIn WEM older than version 1906, you might have to re-configure the settings.\n\nOn the Licensing tab, configure the licensing server.\n\nOn the Database Maintenance tab, consider checking Enable Scheduled Database Maintenance.\n\nOn the Advanced Settings tab:\n\nEnter the Infrastructure service account credentials.\n\nEnter the vuemUser SQL user account password.\n\nIn WEM 1909 and newer, check the box next to Enable performance tuning and set both of the Minimum threads boxes to the number of concurrent WEM Agents that will be connected to this one WEM server. Maximum value is 3000.\n\nMake a choice regarding Google Analytics.\n\nThe Advanced Settings tab will look something like this.\n\nOn the Database Settings tab, enter the database server name and database name.\n\nIn the ribbon, click Save Configuration.\n\nClick Yes to restart the Broker Service.\n\nSkip ahead to upgrade the WEM Administration Console.\n\nCreate WEM Database\n\nWorkspace Environment Management has PowerShell commands. For details, see Citrix Workspace Environment Management SDK at Citrix Developer docs.\n\nTo create the database using the GUI tool:\n\nThe person running Database Management must be a sysadmin on the SQL Server. Or you can enter a SQL login.\n\nMake sure SQL Server authentication (mixed mode) is enabled on the SQL server > Properties > Security. Even though the WEM Infrastructure Service server runs as an AD account that is used login to SQL, WEM Infrastructure Service also uses a SQL account named vuemUser, which means mixed mode must be enabled. Source = John Long at WEM new install, cannot connect to infrastructure server at Citrix Discussions.\n\nOn the WEM server, run WEM Database Management Utility from the Start Menu.\n\nIf a new install, in the ribbon, click Create Database.\n\nIn the Create database Wizard page, click Next.\n\nIn the Database Information page, enter the SQL server name, and enter a new Database Name.\n\nOnly enter an instance name if you have a named SQL instance.\n\nOnly enter a port number if your SQL instance is listening on a static port number other than 1433.\n\nFrom Måns Hurtigh at Problem creating WEM 4.3 Database on SQL Server 2012 at Citrix Discussions: The database name cannot contain a dash.\n\nThe paths might not be correct so double check them. Then click Next.\n\nIn the Database Server Credentials page, if your account has sysadmin permissions, then leave the box checked. Otherwise, uncheck the box, and enter a SQL login that has sysadmin permissions. Click Next.\n\nIn the VUEM Administrators section, click Browse, and select your Citrix Admins group.\n\nIn the Database Security page, if you intend to load balance multiple WEM servers, then specify a Windows service account for database access. The WEM Infrastructure Service will run as this account. See the load balancing topic at Install the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Infrastructure Services at Citrix Docs.\n\nWEM 2305 and newer support group Managed Service Account (gMSA). See Group Managed Service Account at Citrix Docs.\n\nThe Database Creation Wizard also creates a SQL account called vuemUser with an 8 character alphanumeric password. If you want it more complex, check the box and specify the password.\n\nNote: if you intend to implement AlwaysOn Availability Group, then you must specify this password, since you’ll be asked for it again when adding the database to the Availability Group. Also see SQL Server Always On at Citrix Docs.\n\nClick Next.\n\nIn the Database Information Summary page, click Create Database.\n\nClick OK when prompted that the database was created successfully.\n\nClick Finish to close the Database Creation Wizard.\n\nClose the WEM Database Management Utility.\n\nThere is a log file at “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Citrix\\Workspace Environment Management Infrastructure Services\\Citrix WEM Database Management Utility Debug Log.log” or at “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Norskale\\Norskale Infrastructure Services\\Citrix WEM Database Management Utility Debug Log.log”\n\nWEM Infrastructure Services Configuration\n\nOn the WEM Server, run WEM Infrastructure Service Configuration Utility from the Start Menu.\n\nOn the Database Settings tab, enter the SQL Server name and database name.\n\nSwitch to the Advanced Settings tab.\n\nIf you intend to load balance WEM Servers, then Browse to a service account. This service account must have access to the database.\n\nThe service account must be in the local Administrators group on the WEM servers.\n\nEnter the vuemUser SQL user account password.\n\nIn WEM 1909 and newer, check the box next to Enable performance tuning and set both of the Minimum threads boxes to the number of concurrent WEM Agents that will be connected to this one WEM server. Maximum value is 3000.\n\nMake a choice regarding Google Analytics.\n\nThe Advanced Settings tab will look something like this.\n\nOn the Database Maintenance tab, consider checking Enable Scheduled Database Maintenance.\n\nOn the Licensing tab, you can enter a Citrix License Server 11.14.0.1 or newer that has valid licenses. Or you can enter the license server later in the admin console.\n\nClick Save Configuration in the ribbon.\n\nClick Yes when asked to restart the Broker Service.\n\nClose the WEM Infrastructure Service Configuration utility.\n\nIf you are load balancing WEM servers, then you must also create a Kerberos SPN, where [accountname] is the service account you are using for the Norskale service.\n\nsetspn -U -S Norskale/BrokerService [accountname]\n\nInstall/Upgrade WEM Console\n\nRun Citrix Workspace Environment Management Console Setup.exe from the downloaded WEM 2402 (aka 2402-01-00-01) installation files.\n\nCheck the box next to I agree to the license terms and click Install.\n\nIn the Welcome to the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Console Setup Wizard page, click Next.\n\nIn the Destination Folder page, click Next.\n\nIn the Ready to install Citrix Workspace Environment Management Console page, click Install.\n\nIn the Completed the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Console Setup Wizard page, click Finish.\n\nClick Close.\n\nInstall/Upgrade WEM Web Console\n\nInstall or upgrade the WEM Web Console on the WEM Server. The WEM Web Console can use port 443 if nothing else is using that port.\n\nRight-click Citrix Workspace Environment Management Web Console.exe and click Run as administrator.\n\nCheck the box next to I agree to the license terms and click Install.\n\nIn the Welcome to the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Web Console Setup Wizard page, click Next.\n\nIn the Destination Folder page, click Next.\n\nIn the Ready to install the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Web Console Setup Wizard page, click Install.\n\nIn the Completed the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Web Console Setup Wizard page, click Finish.\n\nClick Launch Web Console Configuration. This might not work if you didn’t run the installer elevated.\n\nWeb Console Configuration\n\nCreate a file share for WEM and grant Modify permission to a service account.\n\nCreate a service account and add it to WEM Console > Administration > Administrators as Global Admin with Full Access and not Disabled.\n\nInstall a certificate in the Local Computer store (certlm.msc).\n\nFrom the Start Menu, right-click WEM Web Console Configuration, expand More, and click Run as administrator.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe Port number cannot conflict with other services already using the port, including IIS.\n\nThe Infrastructure server name can be localhost if you installed the Web Console on the WEM Infrastructure Server.\n\nUser name must be Global Admin inside WEM.\n\nClick Start service.\n\nClick Configure certificate.\n\nBrowse to the local cert and then click Set up certificate.\n\nClick Finish.\n\nLaunch the Web Console and login.\n\nClick your name on the top-right and click Storage folder.\n\nEnter the UNC path to the file share for WEM.\n\nCheck the box next to Require credentials and enter the service account. Click Done.\n\nWEM Configuration Sets\n\nEach WEM Agent belongs to one Configuration Set. Most actions in a Configuration Set can be filtered, but some settings are global to the Set. To handle global settings, you can create multiple Configuration Sets that apply to different WEM Agents.\n\nIn WEM Web Console (2308 and newer):\n\nOn the left, click Configuration Sets.\n\nOn the right, click Add configuration set.\n\nGive the set a name and click Save.\n\nClick a Configuration Set to create Actions and configure other settings.\n\nUse the drop-down menu on the top-left to switch to a different Configuration Set.\n\nDirectory Objects lets you add individual computers or computer Organizational Units (OUs) and assign them to Configuration Sets.\n\nBack in the list of Configuration Sets, on the right, you can click Backup and Restore.\n\nClick Backup to perform a manual backup. Or click Manage automatic backup. The backups are stored in the SMB file share.\n\nNotice the Directory objects are not included in the backups.\n\nAfter you have a backup, you can Restore it to any Configuration Set. This is an easy way of copying one Set to another.\n\nIn WEM Classic Console:\n\nFrom the Start Menu, run WEM Administration Console.\n\nIn the ribbon, click Connect.\n\nIn the Infrastructure Server Connection window, enter the WEM Server name, and click Connect.\n\nSome WEM Console settings are global (every agent gets the same setting). So if you want different global settings for different agents, then you create multiple WEM Configuration sets. At the top of the window, in the ribbon, you can create a new WEM Configuration set.\n\nWEM 1912 and newer can Backup and Restore entire Configuration Sets, which makes it easy to duplicate a Configuration Set.\n\nWhen Restoring a Configuration Set, there’s no need to create a new empty Set. Just run the Restore wizard and WEM will try to use the original Configuration Set name. If the original Configuration Set already exists, then WEM will append _1 to the name, which you can then rename.\n\nOnce you have multiple Configuration sets, you can use the drop-down to switch between them.\n\nA WEM Agent can only belong to one WEM Configuration set. Different Agents can belong to different WEM Configuration sets.\n\nIn WEM 4.3 and newer, you add agents to the Configuration set at Active Directory Objects (workspace on bottom left) > Machines (node on top left). You can add OUs or individual objects (computers or computer groups).\n\nImport Recommended Settings\n\nIf you have multiple WEM configuration sets, this process should be repeated for each new, empty WEM configuration set. This process is only available in the classic WEM Console.\n\nOn the right side of the ribbon, click Restore.\n\nSelect Settings and click Next.\n\nIn the Settings Restore wizard, click Next.\n\nIn the Restore from folder section, click Browse, and browse to the \\Workspace-Environment-Management-v-2402-01-00-01\\Configuration Templates\\Default Recommended Settings folder that was included in the WEM download.\n\nIn the Settings Type Selection section, check all available boxes, and click Next.\n\nIn the Restore settings processing window, click Restore Settings.\n\nClick Yes when prompted to replace.\n\nClick Finish.\n\nCTP James Kindon at WEM Hydration Kit has a collection of Applications, File System and Registry Actions that can be imported to WEM. CTP James Kindon recently added Environmental Settings to the Hydration Kit.\n\nWEM 1909 and newer can Migrate your Group Policies to WEM. CTP James Kindon at Migrating GPO settings to WEM explains this feature in detail.\n\nWEM Administrators\n\nThis is only configurable in the Classic WEM Console.\n\nIn the Administration Console, go to Administration (workspace on bottom left) > Administrators (node on top left).\n\nIn the right pane, click Add, and specify an Active Directory group that can administer WEM.\n\nAfter adding a group or user, right-click the new administrator, and click Edit.\n\nUse the Permissions drop-down to select a role. The roles are detailed at Administrators at Citrix Docs.\n\nThen use the State drop-down to select Enabled. New administrators are initially disabled. Click OK to close the window.\n\nWEM Agent Configuration\n\nFor configuration guidance, see CTP James Kindon WEM Advanced Guidance – 2023 at CUGC.\n\nMost of these settings are available in the WEM Web Console.\n\nIn the WEM Web Console, click a Configuration Set, expand Advanced Settings and click Agent Settings.\n\nIn the WEM Classic Administration Console, in the Advanced Settings workspace (bottom left), there are several tabs for configuring the agent.\n\nOn the bottom of each tab is an Apply button. Click this button periodically to save your configuration to the database.\n\nIn Web Console, click Agent options.\n\nWhen making changes, make sure you click Apply changes periodically.\n\nSetting on these tabs are mostly self-explanatory. Feel free to change any as desired. If you imported a default configuration, then many of these might already be enabled. If not, then configure them manually.\n\nCheck the Launch agent options. and Enable desktop compatibility mode. Web Console lets you configure launch exclusions.\n\nIn Classic Console these settings are on the Main Configuration tab.\n\nEnable automatic refresh.\n\nEnable Offline Mode and Use cache to accelerate actions processing. More info at Citrix Blog Post Workspace Environment Management agent caching explained.\n\nThe Action processing section lets you select which modules should be refreshed on reconnect.\n\nIn the WEM Classic Console the settings are in the right pane on the Reconnection Actions tab.\n\nScroll down and there are options to process printers and drives asynchronously.\n\nIn WEM Classic Console, the settings are on the Agent Options tab.\n\nAgent service options section has a setting for Bypass ie4uinit Check. Enabling this might eliminate a 2-minute delay before WEM Agent starts.\n\nIn WEM Classic Console it’s on the Service Options tab.\n\nOn the left is UI Agent Personalization. On the right is Appearance and interaction. You can change the UI agent theme. Other settings on this page let you hide the splash screen.\n\nIn WEM Classic Console, on the top left, in the Advanced Settings workspace, there’s a UI Agent Personalization node.\n\nIn the right pane, in the UI Agent Options tab\n\nThe Helpdesk Options section lets you enable Screen Capture from the WEM Agent.\n\nWEM Classic Console has a Helpdesk Options tab.\n\nFor the Enable Send to Support Option, to allow users to enter a message, add the text “##UserScreenCaptureComment##” to the Email Template box. (Source = MasterXen Workspace Environment Manager – Capture Screen)\n\nSystem Optimization\n\nThe System Optimization node lets you configure the various optimizations.\n\nWEM Classic Console has a System Optimization workspace (bottom left).\n\nOn the top left, click the CPU Management node/section.\n\nCPU Spikes Protection gives processes equal access to the CPU.\n\nThere’s an option for Auto Prevent CPU Spikes.\n\nFrom Hal Lange: “CPU Usage Limit should never be set to higher a percentage than one CPU. This will keep a single threaded application from thrashing a CPU. Example: if 2 CPU’s are available, the CPU setting should not be set above 49%, if 4 CPU’s are available, the CPU setting should not be set above 24%”\n\nHal Lange demonstrates Citrix WEM Performance Optimizations in a YouTube video.\n\nOther tabs/sections let you manually specify CPU priority and/or clamping.\n\nCTX230843 WEM protection and Skype for Business + Real Time Optimization Pack has a list of processes that should be excluded from WEM CPU Spikes protection.\n\nWeb Console > Monitoring > Insights > Optimization Insights has a report showing CPU optimization.\n\nFrom CTA Chris Schrameyer WEM – CPU LOGGING: WEM does not provide any built-in logs to determine when a CPU Spikes Protection action is taken. It would be nice to know what processes are often limited, so we can then add them to a CPU Clamping policy or identify why they are using so much CPU.\n\nMemory Management node, you can enable Optimize Memory Usage for Idle Processes to periodically reclaim memory from running processes. This feature tells processes to flush their memory to disk. In other words, you’re trading memory for disk.\n\nWEM 2206 adds an option for Optimize only if total available memory is less than (MB) or Do Not Optimize When Total Available Memory Exceeds (MB). In other words, WEM does not optimize memory until available memory drops below this value.\n\nWEM 2206 adds a Memory Usage Limit for Specific Processes. Dynamic means the process memory is not limited until available memory is low.\n\nIn the I/O Management node, on the right, you can prioritize process IO. Use the slider on the far right to enable the feature.\n\nIn the Fast Logoff node, in the right pane, enabling Fast Logoff disconnects a session immediately, and runs logoff processes in the background.\n\nWEM 2003 and newer have a Citrix Optimizer feature. If you enable it, then the WEM Agents will disable services and scheduled tasks according to the settings in the template. WEM comes with built-in templates, or you can add your own. Newer versions of WEM have newer templates. WEM 2311 and newer support Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022.\n\nWEM 2012 and newer have an option to Automatically select Templates to Use.\n\nThe Monitoring > Administration > Agents section adds a Process Citrix Optimizer action to each agent.\n\nWEM 2112 and newer have a Multi-session Optimization feature that lowers the priority of processes running in disconnected sessions.\n\nSecurity\n\nThis section is only available in the WEM Classic Console.\n\nClick the Security workspace. On the top left, click the Process Management node. In the right pane, in the Processes Management tab, enable Process Management. The other tabs are grayed out until you check this box.\n\nYou can BlackList processes. There’s also a WhiteList, but once something is added to the WhiteList, then all other processes are blocked.\n\nOn the top left, click Application Security.\n\nWEM database query from CTX233578 Application Security rules might not be enforced properly when multiple users simultaneously log on to the same server OS machine:\n\nUPDATE VUEMSystemUtilities SET Value='0' WHERE Name='AppLockerControllerReplaceModeOn' AND idSite=[idSite];\n\nYou can use the top-left sub-nodes to configure AppLocker. See Application Security at Citrix Docs.\n\nIf you click the Executable Rules sub-node, on the bottom right is a button to Add Default Rules.\n\nIf you edit a rule…\n\nYou can assign the rule to a user group.\n\nThe list of user groups comes from Active Directory Objects (workspace on bottom left) > Users.\n\nOn top of the right pane, set Rule enforcement to On or Audit.\n\nIn the ribbon is a button to Import AppLocker Rules that were exported from a group policy.\n\nThe other sub-nodes follow the same configuration pattern.\n\nWEM 2112 and newer have a Privilege Elevation feature under the Security workspace. You might have to scroll down to find it. On the right, check the box for Process Privilege Elevation Settings. Notice the setting for Do Not Apply to Windows Server OSs.\n\nOn the left, click Executable Rules under Privilege Elevation. Then on the bottom right click Add Rule.\n\nGive the rule a name and select an assignment.\n\nThere are options to restrict the elevation to specific parameters. For example, you can restrict cmd.exe so it can only elevate specific scripts. Click Next.\n\nBrowse to the executable file and click Create.\n\nCTP David Wilkinson has more details on this feature.\n\nWEM 2203 adds a Self-elevation feature that lets users manually run processes elevated. See Citrix Docs for details.\n\nWEM 2006 adds Process Hierarchy Control, which lets you restrict or allow a parent process from launching specific child processes. See Citrix Docs for configuration details.\n\nOn the agent side, you must enable Process Hierarchy Control by running elevated AppInfoViewer.exe from C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Citrix\\Workspace Environment Management.\n\nClick Enable Process Hierarchy Control.\n\nAcknowledge that a restart is required.\n\nWEM has an audit log of the security features at Administration workspace > Logging node > Agent tab.\n\nPolicies and Profiles\n\nWEM Web Console > Profiles > Profile Management Settings lets you push Citrix Profile Management settings to WEM Agents\n\nOn the top right you can click Quick setup to Start with template. Choose either File-based or Container-based.\n\nThere’s an option to configure user-level settings instead of computer-level.\n\nSee the Citrix Profile Management post for details on a recommended Profile Management configuration. Some of the newer settings might be missing from WEM.\n\nIf you use WEM to configure UPM settings, but the settings are not applying to the WEM Agent, then see Citrix CTX219086 Some UPM or WEM Agent parameters may not be applied by the agent after switching from GPO settings to Workspace Environment Management settings.\n\nIn the WEM Classic Console, at Policies and Profiles > Citrix Profile Management Settings, in the right pane, the File System tab has a useful Profile Cleansing button to remove excluded folders from an existing UPM profile share. This function might not be necessary if you enable Logon Exclusion Check.\n\nAdjust the Profiles Root Folder, click Scan Profiles Folder, and then click Cleanse Profile(s).\n\nTo configure folder redirection in the WEM Classic Console, on the top left, click Microsoft USV Settings.\n\nOn the right, on the Roaming Profiles Configuration tab, check the box to Process User State Virtualization Configuration.\n\nThen switch to the Folder Redirection tabs, and configure them as desired.\n\nFor Environmental Settings, WEM Classic Console has the Policies and Profiles workspace (bottom left) with three nodes on the top left.\n\nIn the Environmental Settings node (top left), in the right pane, you can enable Environmental Settings, and configure restrictions that are usually configured in group policy. Peruse the various tabs on the right. Administrators can be excluded from these restrictions. These settings are only in the WEM Classic Console. In WEM Web Console they are replaced by group policies.\n\nThe Environmental Settings within the WEM Administration Console are per-machine, not per-user. This means that, by default, all the settings configured inside of a Configuration Set apply to every non-admin user that logs into that particular Agent machine. In order to have different Environmental Settings apply to different users/user groups, they would need to be applied to a separate WEM Agent machine, and all the settings would need to be configured inside a separate Configuration Set to which the WEM Agent Machine is bound. Source = CTX226487 Guidance on configuring WEM settings per user/user groups.\n\nScripted Tasks\n\nWeb Console lets you configure Scripted Tasks that run at the agent (computer) level.\n\nFirst, add the task/script to Scripted Tasks at the global le\n\nScripted tasks are PowerShell scripts.\n\nThen go to a Configuration Set and click Scripted Task Settings.\n\nOn the far right, click the … next to a scripted task and then click Configure.\n\nEnable the task and choose a Filter.\n\nThe Triggers page lets you choose when the script should run. You can Create new trigger.\n\nOne of the options is Scheduled.\n\nWEM Agent Group Policy\n\nIn the WEM Download, go to the \\Workspace-Environment-Management-v-2402-01-00-01\\Agent Group Policies\\ADMX folder.\n\nCopy the .admx file, and the en-US folder to the clipboard.\n\nGo \\\\MyADDomain.com\\sysvol\\MyADDomain.com\\Policies.\n\nIf you have a PolicyDefinitions folder here, then paste the .admx file and folder.\n\nIf you don’t have PolicyDefinitions in Sysvol, then instead go to C:\\Windows\\PolicyDefinitions, and paste the .admx file and folder there.\n\nLook for older versions of the WEM .admx and .adml files (in the en-us subfolder) and delete them. Remove any WEM .admx and .adml files that have a version number.\n\nEdit a GPO that applies to the VDAs that will run the WEM Agent.\n\nIn WEM 1906 and newer, go to Computer Configuration | Policies | Administrative Templates | Citrix Components | Workspace Environment Management | Agent Host Configuration.\n\nOn the right, double-click Infrastructure server.\n\nEnable the setting, enter the FQDN of the WEM server (or load balanced name), and click OK. Note: It must be FQDN.\n\nAssign Agents to a Configuration Set.\n\nIn the WEM Web Console, go to Directory Objects and click Add object.\n\nIn the WEM Classic Administration Console, choose a Configuration Set and then go to Active Directory Objects workspace (bottom left) > Machines node (top left), and in the right pane, add an OU or individual machines.\n\nIt’s possible that an Agent might register with multiple Configuration sets. You can review the registrations in Web Console at Monitoring > Administration > Agents.\n\nRegistrations tab (right pane) might show you Agents not registered with any Configuration Set. Add the Agent to Active Directory Objects > Machines.\n\nInstall/Upgrade WEM Agent\n\nFor command line unattended installation of WEM Agent, see Alain Assaf at Citrix Discussions.\n\nWEM agent upgrade task – WEM 2311 and newer can push Agent upgrades to existing agents. In a Configuration Set, configure a file share under App Package Delivery. Then import the WEM Agent to the share. Then create a Delivery task. More details at App Package Delivery at Citrix Docs.\n\nIf App Layering, Citrix recommends installing the WEM Agent in the Platform Layer.\n\nIf you are installing the WEM Agent in a App Layer, see George Spiers to workaround an issue with the Netlogon service in a Platform Layer that has the Provisioning Services Target Device software installed.\n\nUse registry editor to confirm that the WEM GPO has applied to the Agent machine. Look for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Norskale\\Agent Host\\BrokerSvcName.\n\nVDA installer – In VDA 2012 and newer, the WEM Agent is included with the VDA installer; however, this install method has been deprecated. You can instead install it separately as detailed in the next step.\n\nManual install – On a VDA Master machine, run Citrix Workspace Environment Management Agent.exe from the downloaded WEM 2402 (aka 2402-01-00-01) installation files.\n\nIn the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Agent window, check the box next to I agree to the license terms and click Install.\n\nIn the Welcome to the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Agent Setup Wizard page, click Next.\n\nIn the Destination Folder page, click Next.\n\nIn the Deployment Type page, select On-premises Deployment and click Next.\n\nIn the Infrastructure Service Configuration page, change the selection to Skip Configuration since you’ve already configured the group policy. Click Next. Note: In WEM 1912 and newer, the cache synchronization port changes from 8285 to 8288.\n\nIn the Advanced Settings page, if this machine will be used with Citrix Provisioning and has a Provisioning cache disk, then you can optionally move the WEM Cache to the Provisioning cache disk. Click Next. WEM Agent 2012 and newer have some enhancements for non-persistent machines. See Prerequisites and recommendations and Agent startup behaviors at Citrix Docs.\n\nIn the Ready to install Citrix Workspace Environment Management Agent page, click Install.\n\nIn the Completed the Citrix Workspace Environment Management Agent Setup Wizard page, click Finish.\n\nIn the Installation Successfully Completed window, click Close.\n\nWEM Agent Cache\n\nAfter installation, check the registry under HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Norskale\\Agent Host to verify your command line switches applied correctly.\n\nWEM Agent 2012 and newer have some enhancements for non-persistent machines. See Prerequisites and recommendations and Agent startup behaviors at Citrix Docs.\n\nIn WEM Agent 1909 and newer, the WEM Agent installation path is now C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Citrix\\Workspace Environment Management Agent instead of C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Norskale\\Norskale Agent Host and you might have to modify your WEM Agent Cache Refresh scripts with the new path. See CTP James Kindon Citrix WEM Updated Start-Up Scripts for more details.\n\nOptionally, you can pre-build the Agent Cache by running AgentCacheUtility.exe, which is located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Citrix\\Workspace Environment Management Agent (fresh WEM Agent 1909 and newer) or in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Norskale\\Norskale Agent Host.\n\nIt needs the following switches:\n\n-refreshcache -brokername:MyWEMServer\n\nFrom Hal Lange: “AgentCacheUtility does except short values (Eg AgentCacheUtility -r -b:) the broker name should always be in FQDN since this does use Kerberos for the authentication.”\n\nYou can also use the Web Console at Monitoring > Administration > Agents to refresh an agent’s cache and perform other actions. The Synchronization column indicates if the cache is up to date or not. It takes a few minutes to update.\n\nIt’s also in WEM Classic Administration Console at Administration workspace (bottom left), Agents node (top left)\n\nFrom Hal Lange: “Need to optimize the client by running ngen for .NET optimizations in the x64 and x86 directories. These commands will help optimize ANY .NET application installed on the system\n\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319 C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319 ngen.exe update ngen.exe eqi 1 ngen.exe eqi 3\n\nAntivirus – C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Citrix\\Workspace Environment Management Agent or C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Norskale\\Norskale Agent Host must be excluded from Antivirus scanning. Or exclude Citrix.Wem.Agent.Service.exe; Norskale Agent Host Service.exe; VUEMUIAgent.exe; Agent Log Parser.exe; AgentCacheUtility.exe; AppsMgmtUtil.exe; PrnsMgmtUtil.exe; VUEMAppCmd.exe; VUEMAppCmdDbg.exe; VUEMAppHide.exe; VUEMCmdAgent.exe; VUEMMaintMsg.exe; VUEMRSAV.exe.\n\nIf you use WEM to push UPM settings, but the settings are not applying to the WEM Agent, then see Citrix CTX219086 Some UPM or WEM Agent parameters may not be applied by the agent after switching from GPO settings to Workspace Environment Management settings. Delete the machine cache, which is at the following registry location:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Norskale\\Agent Host\\UsvMachineConfigurationSettings HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Norskale\\Agent Host\\UpmConfigurationSettings\n\nThis will force WEM to re-apply the per-machine settings (Microsoft USV or Citrix UPM settings, respectively).\n\nWEM Cache tends to break often. See CTP James Kindon Citrix WEM Cache Problems…. Again for a script to reset the cache periodically.\n\nCTP James Kindon describes the WEM Client Side Tools including: Log Parser, Resultant Actions Viewer, VUEMAppCMD, Manage Printers, Manage Applications, and Help Desk Tools.\n\nWEM Agent 2308 and newer have improved Event Viewer logging.\n\nWEM Agent on Citrix Provisioning Target Device\n\nFrom Citrix Discussions: create a computer startup script that deletes the WEM cache and refreshes it:\n\nnet stop \"Citrix WEM Agent Host Service\" /y net stop \"Norskale Agent Host Service\" /y del D:\\WEMCache\\ /S /F /q net start \"Citrix WEM Agent Host Service\" net start \"Norskale Agent Host Service\" net start \"Netlogon\" timeout /T 45 /nobreak \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Citrix\\Workspace Environment Management Agent\\AgentCacheUtility.exe\" -refreshcache -brokername:XXXX \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Norskale\\Norskale Agent Host\\AgentCacheUtility.exe\" -refreshCache -brokerName:XXXX\n\nFrom Julian Mooren Citrix Workspace Environment Management with PVS – Synchronization State “Unknown”: For Citrix Provisioning, schedule a task to run the following commands at Target Device boot (Trigger = At Startup).\n\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Citrix\\Workspace Environment Management Agent\\AgentCacheUtility.exe\" -refreshcache \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Norskale\\Norskale Agent Host\\AgentCacheUtility.exe\" -refreshcache\n\nFrom CTA David Ott at Using Citrix Workspace Environment Management to Redirect Folders via Symbolic Links – Speed Up Logon: before shutting down your maintenance/private mode vdisk to re-seal, kill the Citrix WEM Agent Host Service or Norskale Agent Host Service. For whatever reason if you don’t do this it can cause your vms in standard mode to take an obscenely long time to shutdown.\n\nBase Image Script Framework (BIS-F) automates many image sealing tasks, including tasks for Workspace Environment Management. The script is configurable using Group Policy.\n\nMonitoring\n\nWEM Web Console > Monitoring > Insights has some reporting, including a report showing disk space consumed by profile containers.\n\nIn the WEM Classic Administration Console, the Monitoring workspace (bottom left) lets you see Logon Time and Boot Time reports.\n\nDouble-click a category to see more info.\n\nConfiguration node (top left) lets you configure Work Days Filtering for Login/Boot Time Reports.\n\nWEM 2203 adds a Profile Container Insights report for both FSLogix and UPM Profile Containers.\n\nWhen you make changes in the console, if agents are already installed, you can right-click the agent icon (by the clock), and Refresh.\n\nYou can also go to the Administration workspace (bottom left) > Agents node (top left). In the right pane, right-click one or more Agents, and click the Refresh options.\n\nWEM 1811 and newer periodically run UPMConfigCheck every day, or whenever the Norskale Agent Service restarts. The Administration > Agents node in the WEM Console has a visual indicator of the UPMConfigCheck results. For status details, check the file C:\\Windows\\Temp\\UPMConfigCheckOutput.xml on each WEM Agent Machine.\n\nWEM Actions Configuration\n\nWEM Actions are similar to Group Policy Preferences.\n\nThe general process is as follows:\n\nCreate the Actions\n\nOptionally create Action Groups\n\nAdd AD user groups to the WEM Console.\n\nAssign Actions or Action Groups to user groups. Use Conditions and Rules to perform the Action (or Action Group) for only a subset of machines or users in the user group.\n\nCreate Actions\n\nIn the WEM Console, use the Actions workspace to map drives, map printers, create shortcuts (Applications), set registry keys, etc. Each Action type is a separate node. New features (e.g., group policy templates, JSON Files, INI files, Ports, User DSNs) are only available in the Web Console.\n\nWEM 1909 and newer can Migrate or Import your Group Policies to WEM. CTP James Kindon at Migrating GPO settings to WEM explains this feature in detail.\n\nIn Group Policy Management Console, back up the GPOs that you want to import to WEM.\n\nGo to the GPO Backup folder and zip everything.\n\nIn WEM Console, go to Actions > Group Policy Settings and click Import.\n\nWEM 2209 and newer let you Import Registry File.\n\nWEM 2012 and newer let you edit the imported group policies.\n\nIt seems to be a registry editor that doesn’t use ADMX templates.\n\nWEM Web Console lets you configure GPOs using traditional ADMX templates. Switch to the Template-based tab. Standard Windows templates are already built into the Web Console, but you can upload more templates.\n\nIn WEM Classic Console, some Actions, on the Options tab, have a Self-Healing option. To optimize performance, WEM only applies an action once. The Self-Healing option causes it to reapply at every logon.\n\nNetwork Drives have no field for selecting a drive letter. Instead, you configure the drive letter later when assigning the action as detailed below.\n\nExternal Tasks are scripts that are triggered at user logon, reconnect or other triggers. WEM 2203 adds triggers for Process start and Process end. WEM 2009 adds triggers for Disconnect, Lock, and Unlock.\n\nApplications (shortcuts)\n\nIn the Actions pane, Applications have no option for placing a shortcut on the Desktop. Instead, you configure shortcut placement later when assigning the action as detailed below.\n\nYou can pull icons from a StoreFront store.\n\nIn Web Console, you’ll need to add the StoreFront URL by clicking the Settings button on the top right, or in Classic Console go to Advanced Settings (workspace) > Configuration (node) > StoreFront (tab).\n\nGet published app resource info by downloading the WEM Tool Hub and using it to copy the resource info. Or Classic Console lets you Browse when creating an Actions > Application and selecting a Store URL.\n\nLinks:\n\nCTX233638 How to configure, deploy, and troubleshoot StoreFront-based assigned application actions in Workspace Environment Management (WEM)\n\nCTP James Kindon Storefront Resource Integration with WEM 4.6 – explains how to change the icon\n\nArjan Mensch at Powershell Module for Citrix WEM – Part 3 – EnvironmentalSettings and MicrosoftUsvSettings from GPO and much, much more provides a PowerShell Module that can do several things to help setup WEM, including reading a bunch of shortcuts (e.g. from Start Menu), and converting them to an .xml file that can be imported into WEM. This simplifies Applications configuration.\n\nTo prevent applications (shortcuts) from being created if the application isn’t installed, go to Advanced Settings > Agent Settings > Miscellaneous (or Advanced Settings > Configuration > Agent Options), and check the box next to Check Application Existence in the Extra Features section.\n\nTo clean up extra shortcuts, go to Advanced Settings > Action Settings > Action cleanup (or Advanced Settings > Configuration > Cleanup Actions), and check the boxes in the Shortcuts deletion at startup section. Also see CTP James Kindon Citrix WEM, Modern Start Menus and Tiles.\n\nAfter you create Applications (Shortcuts), and assign them, on the agent, there’s a Manage Applications tool that lets users control where shortcuts are created, including pinning to Taskbar and Start Menu.\n\nApplications can be placed in Maintenance Mode. Edit an application, and find the Maintenance Mode setting on the Options tab.\n\nThis causes the icon to change, and a maintenance message to be displayed to the user.\n\nThe Applications node has a Start Menu View tab on the top right.\n\nFor the Printers Action, there’s a Add from print server button or in the ribbon there’s a Import Network Print Server button.\n\nWeb Console uses the WEM Tool Hub to browse the print server.\n\nJSON Files are Web Console only. This Action lets you configure Microsoft Teams settings.\n\nClick the Generate with template button.\n\nChoose your desired Microsoft Teams configurations.\n\nWEM 2311 and newer support Registry Entries in the Web Console. There’s an Import button that can import .reg files.\n\nOn the top right is a Settings button.\n\nIf Registry Actions are not applying, delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\VirtuAll Solutions\\VirtuAll User Environment Manager\\Agent\\. (Source = Registry Entries not applied to users at Citrix Discussions)\n\nWEM 2311 and newer have File System Operations in the Web Console. There are several Action types.\n\nThere’s a Settings button on the top right.\n\nWEM 2311 and newer have File Associations are available in the Web Console. It uses WEM Tool Hub to configure the FTAs.\n\nWEM 2402 and newer have INI Files, Ports, and User DSNs.\n\nCTP James Kindon at File Type Association with WEM and SetUserFTA explains how to use WEM to run Christoph Kolbicz’s SetUserFTA utility to reliably set file type associations on Windows 2012 and newer.\n\nFor variables that can be used in the Actions configurations, see CTP James Kindon WEM Variables, Dynamic Tokens, Hashtags and Strings.\n\nAction Groups are not yet available in Web Console. You can combine multiple Actions into an Action Group. Then you can later assign the entire Action Group to a user.\n\nCreate an Action Group and name it.\n\nDouble-click the Action Group to show the actions on the bottom.\n\nOn the bottom, move Actions from the Available box to the Configured box.\n\nFor more info, see Action Groups at Citrix Docs.\n\nCreate Conditions and Rules\n\nOnce the Actions and Action Groups are created, you then need to decide under what conditions the Actions are performed. One or more Conditions are later combined into a Filter (or Rule). The Filters (or Rules) are used later when assigning an Action to a user group.\n\nIn Web Console, go to Assignments > Filters and click the Manage Conditions button and then click Create condition. Select one of the many condition types.\n\nOr in Classic Console, go to the Filters workspace (bottom left). On the top left, switch to the Conditions node. In the right pane, create Conditions.\n\nOne of the interesting Conditions is User SBC Resource Type, which lets you run Actions for either Published Desktop or Published Application.\n\nCTP James Kindon at WEM filter conditions on OU and IP Address at Citrix Discussions says that the Active Directory Path Match condition requires a * at the end of the path.\n\nThen go back to Filters and click Create filter.\n\nOr in Classic Console, switch to the Rules node (top left) and create Rules in the right pane.\n\nIf you add (by clicking the right arrow) multiple Conditions to a Rule, all (AND) Conditions must match. Web Console lets you click the circle icon to make it an OR operator, but this isn’t an option in the Classic Console.\n\nAdd AD Groups to WEM Console\n\nIn WEM Web Console, go to Assignments > Assignment Targets and click Add assignment target.\n\nOr in Classic Console, go to the Active Directory Objects workspace (bottom left). With the Users node selected on the top left, in the right pane, add groups and/or users that will receive the Action assignments.\n\nWeb Console also lets you add new targets when managing assignments for each action.\n\nAssign Actions to User Groups\n\nYou can assign multiple actions from one place by clicking an assignment target and then clicking the Manage assignments button.\n\nIn Classic Console, go to the Assignments workspace (bottom left) > Action Assignment node (top left). In the right pane, initially the bottom half is empty. Double-click a group to show the Actions that are available for assignment.\n\nWhen you assign an action, you can choose a Filter.\n\nIn Classic Console, move an available Action or Action Group from the left to the right. This assigns the Action (or Action Group) to the user group.\n\nYou will be prompted to select a Filter, which contains one or more Conditions.\n\nWhen you select a Network Drive (or move a Network Drive to the right), you’re prompted to select a drive letter.\n\nThe list of drive letters is restricted based on the configuration at Advanced Settings workspace (bottom left) > Configuration node (top left) > Console Settings tab (right pane).\n\nApplication assignment lets you choose where to create the icon.\n\nIn Classic Console, some Actions have additional options that you can right-click. For example, you can create shortcuts on the desktop.\n\nWeb Console also lets you Manage assignments directly from each Action.\n\nActions Troubleshooting\n\nWEM caches Actions executions under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\VirtuAll Solutions\\VirtuAll User Environment Manager\\Agent\\Tasks Exec Cache. Sometimes clearing these keys and values will fix Actions not applying.\n\nCTP James Kindon at Selective Deletion of the WEM Actions Tracking Cache wrote a PowerShell script to selectively clear these registry keys and values.\n\nModeling Wizard\n\nIn the Classic Console, in the Assignments workspace, you can use the Modeling Wizard node (top left) to see what Actions apply to a particular user.\n\nClient Side Tools\n\nCTP James Kindon describes the WEM Client Side Tools including: Log Parser, Resultant Actions Viewer, VUEMAppCMD, Manage Printers, Manage Applications, and Help Desk Tools.\n\nTransformer\n\nYou can enable Transformer, which puts the WEM Agent in Kiosk mode. Users can only launch icons (e.g., Citrix icons). Everything else is hidden. This is an alternative to Workspace app Desktop Lock. The Transformer interface is customizable.\n\nWEM 2308 and newer use Edge instead of Internet Explorer. Edge enables StoreFront to detect Workspace app and auto-launch desktops.\n\nIn the WEM Classic Console, there’s a Transformer Settings workspace (bottom left) with two nodes on the top left: General and Advanced.\n\nEnable Transformer, and point it to your StoreFront URL. Note, this applies to all users and all agents in this WEM configuration set. You should probably have a new Configuration Set just for Kiosk devices.\n\nOther settings on the General Settings tab let you customize the appearance, and specify an unlock password. You probably want to disable the Clock. The Navigation Buttons are browser navigation.\n\nTransformer can be unlocked by pressing Ctrl+Alt+U and entering the unlock password.\n\nOn the Site Settings tab, you can add website URLs that can be launched from within Transformer.\n\nAt the top of the Transformer window is a Sites icon that lets you go to the sites listed in the WEM Console.\n\nThe Advanced node lets you configure Transformer to launch a process other than a browser.\n\nThe Advanced & Administration Settings tab lets you hide features from Transformer.\n\nTo prevent users from accessing the local system, consider checking Hide Taskbar & Start Button.\n\nYou probably want Log Off Screen Redirection to redirect users to the logon page when StoreFront logs off.\n\nThe Logon/Logoff & Power Settings tab lets you configure the WEM Agent to autologon as a specific account. Transformer then displays the StoreFront webpage where the user enters his or her credentials."
