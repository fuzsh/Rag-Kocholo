        "text": "It is exhaustive — from infrastructure to app delivery, from data to applications — to modernize your practices, processes and providers to ensure you have the underlying foundation to take advantage of whatever comes next.\n\nTwo or three years ago, apps created through low-code/no-code platforms were not usually as detailed under the surface as software developed from scratch, yet they sufficed for certain purposes. There was even a clear distinction between software developers and everyone else out of necessity because software development was incredibly difficult to master.\n\nBut now, as we head towards more advanced AI, the SaaS-based low-code/no-code (LCNC) platforms empower businesses to create software exponentially faster and cheaper than a code-based approach.\n\nThe future, therefore, of startups in this changing business landscape becomes even more competitive, taking into account the increasing importance of customer-centric UI modeling, data product development and cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and deep learning.\n\nHigh-Value Acceleration\n\nApplications built through traditional software development can take months or even years to launch. If you create a code-based solution, it’s also easy to blame others and there’s a lack of understanding if it’s not well-documented. “Low-code no-code functionalities can change this dynamic,” says Dr. Ingo Mierswa, an industry-veteran computer scientist and founder of Altair RapidMiner. “The visual workflow describes what it’s doing, so people can understand it, buy into it and take ownership of the results.”\n\nVisual workflows can be understood and created by more people. “They make it easier to maintain and explain why anything, such as a model’s decision or a bug, has happened because the workflows are documenting themselves,” Mierswa articulates. “It would be hard to create such an explanation if you had to sift through 100,000 lines of code, especially if the code had been changed 17 times in the past two weeks.”\n\nYou need to iterate, you will make mistakes, and you don’t want to waste time with coding non-critical things. “My big advice for all starters is to always think about what’s critical for your product. What’s your IP? What do you need to own and customize? And if coding is not that important for your product, I think going low-code/no-code is always the better way,” Mierswa shares. “It’s more important for startups because you have less resources, less time, more competitive pressure and markets are moving very quickly.”\n\nEveryone is a Citizen Developer\n\nIn the early 1960s and 1970s, there was a clear distinction between software developers and everyone else out of necessity. Software development was incredibly difficult and time-consuming to learn and master. But now with the onset of low-code/no-code solutions, everyone from custodial teams to C-level executives can create and customize applications that make their jobs more efficient.\n\nBecause no-code/low-code platforms are built on the fundamental premise. “People closer to the problem are better equipped to find simpler and effective solutions,” says Kissflow CEO Suresh Sambandam. “It’s a team sport, and accountability, the most important benefit of LCNC solutions, accelerates development and empowers even more people to collaborate the right way.”A big advantage,” Sambandam says, “is that CIOs of large enterprises can solve the IT talent shortage plaguing the industry today by leveraging expert business users who are ‘citizen developers.’ Many companies can’t avoid struggling to recruit and retain tech talent in a highly competitive market, but low-code/no-code solutions exceedingly help bridge that talent gap by freeing up the bandwidth of existing resources.”\n\nAt the highest level, you always need people who understand the business problems that need to be solved. LCNC functionalities also empower adjacent team members — designers, product managers, data scientists and others — to take part in the different stages of development as the product takes shape.\n\nReducing Technical Debt to Overcome Friction\n\nIn an enterprise scenario, most of the core systems like ERP, CRM, SCM in the front end, as well as in the back end, are bought from standard vendors. There is NO differentiation, as all the top enterprises buy from the same vendor. On the other hand, the bulk of differentiation comes from middle-office processes that are unique to an enterprise. Sambandam points out, “Often these are business processes that require heavy domain knowledge that frequently change to adapt to the evolving business conditions and hence business users are better equipped to build these workflow automations.” He highlights that conventional software development models don’t do justice to the agility required by business users and are too complex for them to use. While business users have the domain knowledge, the system would also require integration touch points with other enterprise systems. These integrations often require deeper technical expertise.\n\nIt is essential to create a cultural change within your organization, where it is not just about having the right tools, but also about investing in your employees and skilling them up, commented DevRev Head of Engineering Ahmed Bashir.\n\nIt still is hard work, and there will be friction. “Overcoming friction requires creating a tighter loop across departments and managers, closing the gap between developers and customers,” he underscores. “And LCNC platforms are designed to act as a system of action, surfacing real-time information that connects work with developers, customers and product.”\n\nThis is exactly where platforms like Kissflow, Blaze and Bubble, which support both no-code and low-code use cases come in and let business users handle the domain portion of the application (90%) and IT teams configure the integration points (10%). This greatly reduces friction between IT and business users, especially when it comes to solutions for long-tail internal workflows.\n\nLong-tail applications include things like approval management, creative requests, incident management, customer onboarding and IT helpdesk. “We looked at the space and decided to tackle this,” Sambandam shares.\n\nLong-tail apps and processes are often viewed by IT as a drain on time/resources they don’t have, yet it’s a lack of internal workflow processes automation that gum up digital transformation. “We found as we scaled the company that when you empower business users to quickly build and augment workflows that directly impact their day-to-day by giving them the tools to do so without advanced technical knowledge, they are motivated to make it happen,” he affirmed.\n\nSecurity is a Business Enabler\n\nThe main objective of security is to protect organizations and people. Organizations prepare for potential security threats by implementing policies and ensuring they have the tools to mitigate and quickly respond to outside threats.\n\nHowever many low-code/no-code adopters do not have security expertise on their team so they rely on the LCNC platform to offer security features readily available for the apps they build. Because creating applications with custom code can lead to a variety of security issues. And such applications are difficult to secure, with the majority of tested applications containing one or more session management vulnerabilities, and others with input validation errors.\n\nGetting a firm handle on security means considering what to do. That sounds simple enough, but it’s surprising how many startups make blunders because of poor planning and shoddy strategies. “We’ve been looking at a trend. Companies want enterprise-level security like audit logs, SSO and other data security requirements for their apps,” commented Nanxi Liu, Co-CEO of Blaze. “Seeing this strong trend, we worked to design our platform with enterprise security and scalability in mind, since most early-stage companies do not have security expertise on their team and rely on platforms to offer advanced security features for the applications they build.”\n\nMake, however, no mistake — there is no best security but the best practices. “That’s part of why,” Liu says, “compliance-driven businesses like financial services and healthcare companies that require the highest level of security to build their customer portals, consider enterprise-grade no-code and low-code platforms that provide the required level of security.”\n\nWith low-code/no-code platforms, your applications are secure with industry-standard protocols, data protection practices, and features to block unauthorized access.\n\nTo underscore: LCNC allows non-technical people to build complex apps without needing to be familiar with traditional software logic. You don’t need computational thinking because visual components in low-code/no-code platforms automatically have the logic built-in. “And now with the mind-bending AI breakthroughs,” Liu remarks, “users can tell AI in natural language the workflow or feature they need and see it instantly created.”"
