        "text": "Michael EnescuÂ is CTO of Open Source Initiatives at Cisco, leading open source programs across multiple technologies and product lines. Previously he served as the first Vice President of Product at XenSource (acquired by Citrix) and one of the first employees. He has a broad range of experience having developed and delivered over two dozen enterprise and consumer software products. Previously he was a founding member of the Java Content and J2ME projects at Sun. Â He led the development of first streaming video servers and digital libraries at SGI. Â He started his career in storage virtualization at IBM where he managed the development of the earlier versions of IBM's core middleware platform product in the WebSphere suite, along with leading development in expert systems, operating systems and virtualization in IBM's Storage Products group. Â Michael has a BS degree from Caltech and MS in Computer Science from Stanford University.\n\nTalk Title: From Cloud to Fog Computing and the Internet of Things\n\nAbstract: Just as we became familiar with Cloud computing and the ubiquity of open source, a new model has emerged, an extension of the cloud to the edge of the network, some call it Fog computing, or the Internet of Things. This talk describes how the compute model is changing as the new generation of devices stretched what we previously knew as Cloud compute. What are the implications in network protocols, network functions virtualization, power and compute resources in these devices as well as the Cloud, or the Fog, and how will the Open Source projects we have become so familiar with in the Cloud today, handle this new scale of distributed compute and scalability tomorrow.\n\nDaniel SturmanÂ is an engineering director at Google where he leads the engineering for the Google Cloud Platform, including products such as Google Compute Engine, Google App Engine, and Google Cloud Storage. Â Prior to this role, Daniel led the engineering for Google’s internal cluster management platform supporting all Google applications. Â Daniel was also closely involved in the growth of Google’s New York office, leading a team working on a range of challenges faced by Google’s internal software infrastructure. Before joining Google, Daniel was director of development for DB2 on Linux, Unix and Windows in IBM's Information Management division. Â Daniel started at IBM as a researcher at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, where his research focused on revolutionizing the way people build and use distributed systems. His research concentrated on technologies for enterprise messaging and cluster computing. Â He holds a Ph.D. and master's degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a bachelor's degree in computer science from Cornell University.\n\nTalk Title: The Next Cloud Wave: Tackling the Devops Experience\n\nAbstract: Cloud is changing the face of modern computing by freeing developers to request resources on demand. Also, the scale of cloud providers is now giving access to better quality networking and storage at lower cost. Thus, cloud is taking a lot of risk out of the cost structure of IT projects, while also significantly improving the speed and agility with which new projects can be launched and scaled. The next big challenge for Cloud is to address the pace and costs of software development driven by the complex tasks of operating and evolving software projects. Cloud provides the opportunity to significantly reduce team size while increasing team velocity by applying automation and prediction technologies at scale to software development processes. Examples we will discuss in this talk include automating deployments, continuous testing, and anomaly detection. We will suggest salient research issues and the impact these can have on the future of computing.\n\nBrent Holden is the Chief Field Architect at Red Hat where he regularly advises a range of Fortune 100 companies in financial services, healthcare, retail and transportation verticals on such topics as cloud computing, big data, and high performance computing. Brentâs specialties include designing innovative architectures around distributed computing to field next generation applications. He is actively involved with Red Hat's OpenStack efforts by helping multiple customers to design and deliver services on the platform. Brent holds a bachelorâs degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Connecticut.\n\nTitle: Open Source Technologies Driving Innovation in Cloud\n\nAbstract:What many users see as \"the cloud\" is a simple website that they can use to request services for storage and compute or application services. What underlies all of that simplicity are some of the world's largest open source development communities driving innovation and breaking new ground. Open source has been where the industry looks to consolidate effort, to develop those partnerships, marketplaces and user communities. It allows for decisions to be made transparently so that designs can be discussed and voted on merit. Some of the new technologies around the software defined datacenter can be made consumable by the efforts of developers and vendors working side-by-side to deliver what's best for their users and customers. In this talk, Brent will discuss newer technologies that enterprises are adopting, and how open source is helping to shape those technologies.\n\nJoe CaraDonna is a Technical Director at NetApp responsible for core operating systems, simulation, virtual appliances, and cloud solutions.Joe has been driving innovation at NetApp and the storage industry for over 15 years, with a career in computer engineering spanning two decades. Prior to joining NetApp, Joe worked on advanced operating system technology and real-time computing at companies including: SGI, Open Software Foundation, The Center for High Performance Computing. Joe holds a masters degree in Computer Science from WPI.\n\nTalk Title: A Perspective on Cloud from NetApp\n\nAbstract: The promise of the cloud is compelling: let someone else build, own and run the data center, while you rent the resources and layered services as you need them. You can spin-up an entire virtual data center at the touch of a button, with no capex commitment, and dismantle it just as easily. You can innovate like never before, with the power of infinite scale and agility. The promise is catching-on, fueling broad interest. However, the cloud also comes with risks and operational complexity, especially around data. Customers worry about safety, legality, and lock-in. Cloud can be a cheap way to start a project, but later it may be better to move back on-premise.\n\nWayne M. Adams is a Senior Technologist with the Corporate Office of the CTO. He is responsible for expanding and managing EMC technology leadership initiatives with selected industry standards bodies. Adamsâ industry association roles have included the SNIA Board, DMTF Board, W3C Advisory Committee, and many leadership committee roles for technology forums and initiatives, cross-industry strategic alliances with industry associations, and government initiatives. Joining EMC in 1997, Adams has held managing positions including partner management and software product management, where his responsibilities included API licensing and product lifecycle management for Storage Resource Management, SAN Management, and I/O pathing product lines. Prior to EMC, he had held technical roles at Digital Equipment Corporation and Eastman Kodak. Adams holds a Bachelorâs of Science degree with a dual major in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTalk Title: Cloud Infrastructure and Data Standards Enable Enterprise Data Centers To Evolve Forward with Private and Hybrid Cloud Services\n\nAbstract: Data storage is being elevated to new levels of IT importance as CIOs and CEOs embrace the facts that storage is the critical component related to deriving more value from their corporate data, with technology trends and industry standards addressing managing big data, migrating to cloud computing services , enabling a mobile work-force, complying with data and privacy regulations, and preserving data for long term retention objectives. A few industry open standards and open source projects will be discussed for their merits to build-out interoperable cloud services."
