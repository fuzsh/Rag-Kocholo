        "text": "THE FIRST EVER RUNTIME SECURITY FOR HYPERVISORS\n\nWith recent attacks occurring due to compromised hypervisors, creating effective protection for Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) was a priority for us. We’re proud to introduce ZeroLock for Hypervisors. ZeroLock for Hypervisors is currently available for ESXi, Proxmox, Nutanix, XenServer, Citrix Hypervisor, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV), and KVM; contact us to learn more.\n\nRead our blog post about the risks facing ESXi.\n\nGET UP AND RUNNING FAST WITH ONE-LINE DEPLOYMENT.\n\nZeroLock is the first-ever runtime comprehensive security solution for all Linux-based Virtual Machine Monitors‭ (‬VMMs‭). ‬No modification to the hypervisor itself is required‭, ‬and deployment is as simple as one line in the terminal‭. ‬In addition to hypervisor‭ ‬protection‭, ‬ZeroLock works across all Linux distros‮—‬with no need for kernel modules‮—‬while maintaining system stability‭, ‬performance‭, ‬and using only 50MB of RAM‭. ‬Whether connected or disconnected‭, ‬ZeroLock offers the same protection for‭:‬\n\nHypervisors‭ ‬‭(‬VMWare ESXi‭, ‬Nutanix‭, ‬XenServer‭, ‬Citrix Hypervisor‭, ‬Proxmox‭, ‬\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization‭ (‬RHEV‭), ‬and KVM‭)‬\n\n‬Private‭, ‬Public‭, ‬or Hybrid Cloud‭ ‬‭(‬Bare Metal/VMs‭, ‬Containers‭, ‬Kubernetes‭)‬\n\nOn-prem‭ / ‬Private Data Center\n\nEmbedded Systems and Controllers\n\nAir-gapped Environments\n\nENSURE UPTIME WITH AI AND AUTOMATED FILE ROLLBACK.\n\nZeroLock’s patent-pending AI/ML-based behavioral capability detects malware by the actions it performs, not scanning for easily defeated file hashes. Our proprietary algorithms detect and stop traditional and fileless attacks in real-time with >98% efficacy and offer the ability to automatically remediate file damage with no user intervention required—helping you to ensure zero downtime.\n\nRansomware Protection\n\nWiperware Protection\n\nCryptojacking Protection\n\nAutomated Attacker Persistence Removal\n\nReal-time Threat Remediation\n\nAutomated file rollback\n\nFully Automated Process Tree Creation\n\nPREVENT ATTACKS WITH REAL-TIME VIRTUAL PATCHING.\n\nZeroLock goes beyond traditional mandatory access control capabilities. In contrast to SELinux and AppArmor, ZeroLock offers easily configured and universally applied rules and policies that can be deployed across all your Linux and cloud environments from a single console. Examples of our control capabilities include:\n\nSSH Multifactor Authentication (MFA)\n\nProcess Behavior Controls\n\nNetwork Access Controls\n\nFile Access Controls\n\nCanary Files\n\nTamper Protection\n\nAPI-FIRST ARCHITECTURE FOR SIEM/SOAR INTEGRATIONS.\n\nFor teams that have existing platforms in place that they don’t want to disrupt—for their Windows endpoints for instance—ZeroLock has an API-first architecture with SIEM/SOAR integration capabilities to work into your environment, so you can have the best Linux security without sacrificing ease of management.\n\n24-7 SUPPORT, EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.\n\nOperationalization is no small lift.
