Using software measurement methods, SignaCert products can prove that federal systems under the OMB mandate are FDCC compliant to the binary level. SignaCert will provide standard baseline images for both Windows XP and Vista desktops at no additional charge with its Enterprise Trust Server (ETS), both as an appliance-based solution or a hosted service.\n\nAs an adjunct requirement under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), both SCAP and FDCC have been added to the list of FISMA compliance and reporting requirements for all Federal Agencies effective February 1, 2008. OMB, in conjunction standards and technical guidance from the National Institute of Standards (NIST), the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) created and announced the new requirements in memo form on March22 and June 1, 2007. Through the use of SCAP and FDCC, these and other agencies have worked to supplement FISMA with more standardized methods and prescriptive controls than before.\n\n\"With the foundation of a trusted platform, it is possible to definitively prove that the runtime data structure is as intended and authorized,\" said Wyatt Starnes, CEO of SignaCert.\" SignaCert has the only solution available that can automatically prove that FDCC images remain deployed as intended over their lifetime.\"\n\nWhile SCAP is intended to standardize the configuration controls for desktop systems subject to the OMB mandates, SignaCert goes one step further by verifying that the actual deployed binary image meets the prescribed image requirements under FDCC.\n\nAdditionally, SignaCert announced its partnership to support SCAP in partnership with Secure Elements on September 20, 2007, and expects to work with other existing and emerging vendors supporting the SCAP standards and methods.\n\nThe FDCC standard image validation templates can be specified when ordering the SignaCert Enterprise Trust Server (ETS).\n\nSignaCert Announces New Methods to Manage Enterprise IT Systems\n\nOct 9, 2007\n\nSignaCert measures, validates, and maintains the stateof software technologies from supporting vendors: Fujitsu Limited, IBM, Intel, JuniperNetworks, Sun Microsystems, Symantec, Applied Identity, Authentium, SecureElements, Veracode, and XenSource.\n\nPortland, Oregon â SignaCertÂ® Inc., a leading provider of independent IT controls technology,today announced extended capabilities to provide independent verification ofsoftware from vendors such as, FujitsuLimited (TSE: 6702), IBM(NYSE: IBM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Juniper Networks (NASDAQ: JNPR), Sun Microsystems (NASDAQ: JAVA), Symantec(NASDAQ: SYMC), Applied Identity, Authentium, Secure Elements, Veracode, and XenSource.SignaCert offers enterprise class solutions that address industry demandfor proactive IT controls to achieve more stable and compliant computing.\n\nâWe are very pleased by the continued momentum in the market adoption of thisnew approach to systems controls,â said Wyatt Starnes, Founder and CEO ofSignaCert, Inc. âWe are witnessing a broad cross section of new applicationsfor these methods among customers and partners.â\n\nMany IT departments assume that software originally deployed into production isthe same that is loaded and executing today. In practice, this is often not thecase and leaves an âIT blind spot.â Before SignaCert, there was no definitive way toprove that customersâ IT environments were deployed and configured as intended.SignaCertâs patented solution, supportedby these companies, provides partners and customers a completely new way to createa trusted reference â a baseline of independently verified, vendor authentic,signatures â for deploying such solutions.\n\nAs mentioned in SignaCertâs product upgrade announcement last week, proactive systemsmonitoring using independent IT controls result in improved operational efficiencyand financial benefit through increased availability of IT infrastructure, greatercontrol and security, and increased fulfillment of essential compliance andaudit requirements, including virtual machines.\n\nâA core strategy for Intel vPro processor technology is to deliver a built-in manageability and proactive security environment on commercial business PCs,âsaid Robert Crooke, vice president and general manager of Intelâs BusinessClient Group. âSignaCertâs ability to embrace Intel Trusted Execution Technology(TxT) and Virtualization Technology (VT) is a commitment in providing trust.â\n\nParticipation in the SignaCert Harvest Program â the mechanism by whichsignatures of partner software are captured, verified, and incorporated intoSignaCertâs Enterprise Trust Server, is open to all OS, application, andinfrastructure vendors.\n\nâSolaris 10 is the most digitally signed Operating System available today,âsaid Marc Hamilton, Vice President, Solaris marketing, Sun Microsystems. âTheintegration of SignaCert Enterprise Trust Server with our upcoming SecureExecution capability will further address customer needs for robust, safe, andprovably secure systems.â\n\nSignaCert independent IT controls technology is integrated into orcomplementing numerous technology companies and organizations:\n\nApplied Identity: SignaCert and Applied Identity are complementary security and audit enablement technologies that give customers a higher level of trust through system integrity verification and identity-driven access management.\n\nJuniper Networks: SignaCertâs IT controls and system integrity capabilities complement Juniperâs Unified Access Control (UAC) solution by providing a unique white list approach (a trusted reference) to endpoint health measurement; this enables improved granularity and flexibility of Juniperâs UAC network access assessment based on system attestation.\n\nSecure Elements: Secure Elements and SignaCert deliver the first complementary solution that provides positive attestation for SCAP configuration and binary/library validation for regulated and federal IT customers.\n\nSymantec: SignaCert is using best-in-class antivirus technology from Symantec to help ensure that only âclean codeâ submissions are made to the SignaCert Global Trust Repository. In partnership with Symantec, SignaCert performs a highly secure white list data extraction.\n\nXenSource: SignaCert and XenSource are establishing standards and technologies for bringing measurement and controls to virtual environments. âSecurity in a virtualized environment is a growing concern for CIOs,â said Simon Crosby, CTO, XenSource. âXenSource believes that measurement and trust go hand in hand with a secure virtualized platform. SignaCertâs technology is an important component of the trusted computing base and can help ease customer concerns about the security of virtual infrastructure, accelerating the adoption of virtualization.â\n\nSignaCert Releases Latest Version of Enterprise Trust Server; Receives Patent\n\nOct 1, 2007\n\nNew version extends capabilities of first-of-its kind independent verification and measurement solution for business and government enterprises\n\nPORTLAND, OREGON â SignaCertÂ® Inc., the leading provider of independent IT controls solutions, today announced a major upgrade to its Enterprise Trust Server, the only technology of its kind to definitively prove that IT systems remain exactly as intended in production. The numerous usability improvements include increased flexibility and enhanced reporting functionality, from console-based dashboards to customizable reports, which verify device integrity down to the binary level. The upgrade enables scenarios such as âexact matchâ that no other product can achieve.\n\nThe technology behind the Enterprise Trust Server was recently acknowledged with the issuance of United States patent #7,272,719. The patent applies to SignaCertâs unique method of generating signatures and assembling them into an integrity log for integrity verification and measurement against a known and trusted reference.\n\nâWhen the company launched last January, SignaCertâs goal was to have the most comprehensive, detailed software verification system on the market â something no one else was â or is â doing. The patent acknowledges that SignaCert has created unique and proprietary technology,â said Frank Tycksen, VP of Engineering for SignaCert. âWorking with new technology, it was important that we listen to what customers had to say; the latest enhancements are a result of their input.â\n\nKey features of Enterprise Trust Server 1.5 include:\n\nOne-to-many verification: Compares multiple devices with a single integrity reference to pinpoint deviations.\n\nScalable and flexible: SignaCertâs database of authentic signatures validates many scenarios required for understanding IT systems â from identifying what software versions are present on devices, to ensuring that only approved software is installed, to proving that a group of devices match their specified standard build precisely.\n\nEnhanced reporting: Reports deliver meaningful actionable information. A comprehensive dashboard provides high level view of which systems and devices have deviations and allows drill down to the exact device and the specific deviations. Reports are extensible; ETS allows connectivity to external reporting packages and middleware solutions.\n\nFine grain visibility: Find every deviation down to the binary level, but also correlate the deviations individually or in groups to the package level: the product, application, build, or version to which is belongs.\n\nSecure Elements and SignaCert Partner to Deliver First Joint Solution To Provide Positive Attestation for SCAP Configuration and Binary/Library Validation for Regulated and Federal IT Customers\n\nSept 20, 2007\n\nCombined offering validates SCAP configurations and related binaries to fulfill Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) Compliance\n\nHERNDON, VA and PORTLAND, OR - Secure Elements, the industry leader in standards-based IT audit and compliance management, and SignaCert Inc., the forefront provider of independent IT controls solutions, today announced a joint marketing and product development agreement through which the two firms will deliver the first complementary NIST Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) solution that combines positive attestation of SCAP configuration audits and the associated binary/library implementations.\n\nOn June 1st, 2007 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandated that providers of information technology shall certify applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) by Feb 1, 2008. On July 31st, 2007 OMB required that NISTs Security Content Automation Protocol (S-CAP) be utilized by industry and government in support of this initiative. SCAP measures systems against configurations, but falls short of ensuring that the components are authentic, and un-tampered.\n\n\"SignaCert is actively involved with SCAP to help not only facilitate rapid adoption, but to help present a Positive Security Model as an extension to the project,\" said Wyatt Starnes, Founder and CEO, SignaCert. \"Together with Secure Elements we will deliver significant and immediate value to customers by enabling file based,positive attestation of FDCC image and general platform elements,definitively proving, against verifiable platform standards, that systems are deployed and configured as intended.\"\n\nSecure Elements offers the only enterprise solution that works directly with the SCAP content, enabling Federal agencies to meet the OMB Mandate for FDCC compliance. By partnering with SignaCert which can independently verify and validate applications at the binary level the two companies are now uniquely positioned to offer Federal agencies a comprehensive, end-to-end, SCAP solution that enables full compliance with the FDCC.\n\n\"Secure Elements is always seeking out complimentary technologies that not only enhance our SCAP offering, but also simplify and improve the IT security compliance process for our Federal customers,\" said Ned Miller, President and CEO, Secure Elements. \"In working closely with Federal agencies and understanding their pain points when it comes to achieving FDCC compliance, it became clear that partnering with SignaCert would create tremendous synergies between our two companies,and, for the first time, will provide customers with a single solution for achieving SCAP compliance with certification at the binary level.\"\n\nMedia Advisory: SignaCert to present at 3rd Annual Security Automation Conference hosted by NIST\n\nSept 18, 2007\n\nSignaCert, the leader in independent IT controls, will be speaking this Thursday, September 20, 2007 at the 3rd Annual Security Automation Conference, hosted by NIST, DISA, and NSA, taking place Sept. 19-20, 2007 in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Learn more at http://nvd.nist.gov/scap/docs/SCAP_Agenda_2007.pdf.\n\nSignaCertâs talk will focus on FDCC and SCAP compliance using apositive security model and will give a brief overview of the âPositive Modelâ as it applies to SCAP and FDCC, and whatâsmissing. While SCAP covers the configuration, security posture, and application settings of a platform, there is still a set of the configurationthat is not controlled or governed by the configuration of the platform. Thatis the platform components themselves, such as binaries, images, libraries, andother data elements that do not reside in a second order control point.\n\nThis is where SignaCert comes in. SignaCertâs product is an independent IT control thatmeasures, proves and verifies that the system applications are exactly the same in ongoing production as they were when they were deployed. This ongoing independent monitoring increases system security, improves availability of critical IT infrastructure, and fulfills critical compliance and auditing requirements.

These standards provide a foundation for platform integrity measurement and verification and will ensure the interoperability and adoption of solutions in today's complex, multi-vendor IT environment.\n\nThis latest set of specifications are yet another step forward in the continued development of a trusted computing environment whichseeks to deliver platform integrity, measurement and verification for users and IT administrators that ensures accurate and consistent reporting of the state of their platforms. By using these standards organizations will be able to significantly improve the security and information protection on platforms on which they are deployed.\n\n\"We recognize the need and importance for a standardized industry approach to data measurement and verification that will provideorganizations with a consistent and accurate means of reporting the state of their platforms,\" said Wyatt Starnes,Founder, President and CEO of SignaCert.\n\nThe new specifications on the organization's website www.trustedcomputinggroup.org,augment the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a core set of security functions defined by TCG members and widely used in virtually all enterprise PCs and manyservers. These new specifications ensure that the state of the system in which a TPM is used is reported accurately and in a standard fashion. It'Ââ¢santicipated that services and products incorporating these specifications will begin development for availability in 2007.\n\nThe new specifications in this latest release include:\n\nThe Integrity Management Architecture provides a common framework for defining, collecting and reporting information about the integrity of the hardware and software components of a trusted platform (one that has the TPM). Integrity information includes values in the TPM within a system, files on the system, in-memory images and others. What is measured is dependent on the use of the measurement. For example, in implementations of TCG's Trusted Network Connect (TNC) for network access control, the client trying to attach to the network might be measured to determine what patches and antivirus software it has loaded, or checked to see if it has changed since the last connection.\n\nThe Platform Trust Services (PTS) Interface specification defines a measurement agent to collect, measure, and report the integrity information on the platform, which can be a PC, mobile phone, server or other device. This ability complements the Trusted Network Connect architecture by enabling an integrity check of the platform before it is connected to the network. This can help detect root kits when used in concert with boot integrity checking, and can identify infected or unauthorized clients.\n\nThe Integrity Schema specification provides a common XML-based data format to facilitate information exchange within the Integrity Management Architecture and integrates with Platform Trust Services Interface specification. The schema specification covers the format for integrity data to be collected and reported; the format for representing reference measurement of known values; and the format for evaluating the results of platform integrity assessments including reporting of the TPM platform configuration registers (PCRs).\n\nAbout TCG\n\nTCG is an industry standards body formed to develop, define,and promote open standards for trusted computing and security technologies,including hardware building blocks and software interfaces, across multiple platforms,peripherals, and devices. TCG specifications are designed to enable more secure computing environments without compromising functional integrity with the primary goal of helping users to protect their information assets from compromise due to external software attack and physical theft. Moreinformation and the organization's specifications are available at the Trusted Computing Group'â¢s website, www.trustedcomputinggroup.org.\n\nSignaCert Names Frank Tycksen as Vice President of Engineering\n\nJul 25, 2006\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. - SignaCert President and CEO Wyatt Starnes announced today that Frank Tycksen has joined SignaCert as the Vice President of Engineering.\n\nFrank has over 21 years of experience in software development, management, and technical leadership with a focus on trust and security systems.
