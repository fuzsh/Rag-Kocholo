        "text": "Abstract\n\nIn the past 20 years, the practical examples of KDD/data mining have become so ubiquitous that it’s almost impossible to imagine a new venture that isn’t based on data science. Uber, Facebook, 23andMe, Tesla – they aren’t just technology companies; they are data companies. And yet the reality is that these companies are still anomalies. Large, successful companies usually still treat KDD as either an afterthought or as an experiment. It’s not core to how they run the business.\n\nAs practitioners we compound this problem by concentrating our efforts on valuable business problems; but ones which are usually on the periphery of the business. We do this because changing the heart of how a company operates requires more than just process or technology changes. It requires cultural changes. And these cultural changes usually trigger corporate antibodies adverse to anything new.\n\nThis talk will review some practical realities of instituting data-driven decisions in a very large multi-national company.\n\nBio\n\nJonathan Becher serves as Chief Digital Officer and head of the SAP Digital business unit, which allows individuals to discover, buy, use, and renew SAP and third-party offerings with minimal human interaction.

In this talk I highlight some examples of research that would not have been possible just a handful of years ago and that illustrate the promise of CSS. At the same time, they illustrate its limitations. I then conclude with some thoughts on how CSS can bridge the gap between its current state and its potential.\n\nBio\n\nDuncan Watts is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research and an AD White Professor at Large at Cornell University.

In an increasingly sophisticated marketing environment, where new marketing tools have enabled more precise targeting and marketing measurement than ever before, the challenge of solving Wanamaker’s dilemma has still loomed – that is, until now. In this talk, I will show you how at Amplero we have solved what’s not humanly possible to solve, making available to marketers an AI-powered marketing technology that makes use of dynamic machine learning at massive scale to enable smarter, more effective marketing. In particular, I will focus on the revolution of multi-armed bandit experimentation coupled with machine learning, highlighting what it means for today’s marketer, and specifically the marketer’s ability to directly impact business KPIs and customer lifetime value. As part of my presentation I will share experiences and examples from our work with BtoC enterprises with 10M’s of customers.\n\nBio\n\nAs Amplero’s Chief Scientist and CTO, Dr. Olly Downs leads the data science, technology and product teams responsible for building the company’s AI-based marketing technology platform.

Conventional computer vision used for ADAS is reaching its threshold because it is impossible to write code for every possible scenario as a vehicle navigates. In order to develop a truly autonomous car, deep learning and artificial intelligence are required. With deep learning, the vehicle can be trained to have super human levels of perception, driving safer than anyone on the road. An end-to-end artificial intelligence platform based on supercomputers in the cloud and in the vehicle enables cars to get smarter and smarter. Coupled with an extensive software development kit with vision and AI libraries and software modules, automakers, tier 1s, and startups can build scalable systems from ADAS to full autonomy.\n\nBio\n\nDanny Shapiro is Senior Director of NVIDIA’s Automotive Business Unit, focusing on solutions that enable faster and better design of automobiles, as well as in-vehicle solutions for self-driving cars, infotainment systems, and digital instrument clusters.

Tencent Social Ads is the advertising system for both Wechat and QQ, serving well over 10B page views per day, for hundred million daily users.\n\nWe strive to understand as much as possible on our users’ multiple aspects, so as to serve the best personalized ads for them. The rich user behaviors on Tencent’s many products lay a solid foundation in user profiling. We develop audience targeting on many dimensions, including demographics, interests, intents, transactions, physical locations, and access environment, etc.\n\nIn this presentation, we will share our experience in large-scale user data mining for audience targeting, and discuss the challenges we face and the solutions we have employed:\n\nSome demographics data are obtained from user input, and thus would have gaps in both accuracy and coverage. We will discuss the techniques in calibrating and verifying these data.\n\nWe infer user interests from their social behaviours. For example, most QQ groups are not labelled properly, but by applying a large-scale topic model on the QQ memberships, we can effectively classify most QQ groups into an interests taxonomy. We also infer user interests from user’s physical location check-ins and uploaded photos.\n\nUser data can be collected from many diverse sources, including behaviors in various Tencent products, click and conversion in ad platform, and even seed customers collected by advertisers. We’ll discuss the systems to merge these diverse data to provide a coherent view for our advertisers.\n\nHigh quality user labels are usually sparse. We implemented an algorithm for advertisers to reach more potential customers through user similarity computation based on user features as well as social graph explorations. We’ll describe the system’s impact on actual advertising campaigns.\n\nTop advertisers demand rich audience targeting solutions in combination of their own customer data, Tencent’s platform users data, and possibly other 3rd-party data. We’ll discuss the data exchange platform that can facilitate various data applications together with 3rd-party DSPs and DMPs.\n\nBio\n\nChing Law is General Manager of Social & Performance Ads Department at Tencent, overseeing engineering, marketing, operations, and products.

Before joining Tencent in 2012, Ching worked at Google for eight years, where he led multiple audience & contextual targeting projects in AdSense, Google dictionary and Cantonese input system.\n\nChing received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nPermlink\n\nAbstract\n\nRecently, learning deep models from dense data has received a lot of attention in tasks such as object recognition and signal processing. However, when dealing with non-sensory data about real-world entities, data is often sparse; for example people interaction with products in e-Commerce, people interacting with each other in social networks or word sequences in natural language. In this talk, I will share lessons learned over the past 10 years when learning predictive models based on sparse data: 1) how to scale the inference algorithms to distributed data setting, 2) how to automate the learning process by reducing the amount of hyper-parameters to zero, 3) how to deal with Zipf distributions when learning resource-constrained models, and 4) how to combine dense and sparse-learning algorithms. The talk will be drawing from many real-world experiences I gathered over the past decade in applications of the techniques in gaming, search, advertising and recommendations of systems developed at Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.\n\nBio\n\nRalf is Director of Machine Learning at Amazon and Managing Director of the Amazon Development Center Germany.

This gives rise to very fundamental challenges around the fragmentation of consumer identity. The big Internet giants of Google, Facebook, etc. have an inherent advantage in solving for this through their first-party data of made up of a stateful, logged-in base of user information. This creates an inequity across the digital and Internet economy in the ability to provide seamless experiences and solutions from understanding consumer identity. This talk will address how machine learning and data science best-practices can solve for this identity capability, and how it can be done in a privacy-safe and data-safe manner, with high precision and at massive scale.\n\nKamakshi will focus on the algorithms developed at Drawbridge that process a massive scales of data in near-real-time spans to solve for a single user’s identity across different domains, while still protecting consumer anonymity.\n\nBio\n\nKamakshi Sivaramakrishnan is the founder and CEO of Drawbridge, the leading technology company that is fundamentally changing the way in which brands and enterprises connect with people. Under Kamakshi’s leadership, Drawbridge has built the first technology-aided solution that addresses a problem central to all digital media: consumer-trusted cross-device identity.\n\nKamakshi received her PhD in Information Theory and Algorithms from Stanford University, and has been named one of Business Insider’s “Most Powerful Women in Mobile Advertising” for four consecutive years. She received the 2015 Women of Vision ABIE Award for Technology Entrepreneurship from the Anita Borg Institute. Kamakshi also has the unique distinction of her work being onboard NASA’s New Horizons mission to Pluto and the outer planetary system.\n\nRandell Cotta is a Senior Data Scientist at Drawbridge, where he has spent the last three years focused on designing the intelligence behind their digital identity solution as well as the learning systems that leverage digital identity for their partners and underlying consumers. Randell received his PhD in theoretical physics from the SLAC Theory Group at Stanford, where he helped to define the interface between theories explaining dark matter and related experimental data. He was later a postdoc in the Particle Theory Group at UC Irvine before joining Drawbridge.\n\nAmong other honors, Drawbridge was recognized as the fastest-growing private company in the marketing and advertising space on the 2015 Inc. 5000, as well as the fastest-growing woman-led company, and sixth-fastest-growing overall.\n\nPermlink"
