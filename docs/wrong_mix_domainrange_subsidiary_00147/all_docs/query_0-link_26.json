Case Study citrix.com Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System 2 Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System (FMOLHS) is a nonprofit, mission-focused Catholic health system headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As the largest health system in the state, the organization provides care to nearly half of Louisiana’s citizens through a network of hospitals, clinics, physicians, elderly housing and integrated information systems. FMOLHS manages approximately 1,600 beds, employs more than 13,000 people, and works with as many as 10,000 contractors and affiliate physicians. Approximately 250 employees work in the Information Services department at FMOLHS. The challenge: Supporting clinicians while adapting to government mandates and driving greater efficiency Like nearly every healthcare organization in the United States, FMOLHS has had to grapple with the rapidly changing government, business, clinical and patient requirements that are indicative of a new healthcare landscape. To thrive, FMOLHS needed to support its core mission of caring for patients while taking advantage of economies of scale and maximizing efficiency. In the past few years, FMOLHS undertook a major transformation, with its Information Services department leading the way. From supporting electronic medical records (EMR) and computerized physician order entry (CPOE), to enabling secure, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) access, the IT team at FMOLHS faced numerous challenges: • Delivering EMR in both inpatient and ambulatory settings to meet meaningful use and CPOE requirements • Improving physician and nurse productivity and satisfaction • Reducing IT costs and improving the efficiency of the IT organization • AddressingdeviceproliferationandBYODrequests • Mitigating the risk of HIPAA security breaches and open workstation kiosks on hospital floors “Our goal has always been to support the physicians, saving them time so they can spend more of it with patients,” says Johnny Brister, manager of infrastructure and technology systems at FMOLHS. “They’re doctors, not IT people. They shouldn’t have to worry about the computer. We needed to get them access to the applications they need when and where they need them.” FMOLHS wanted to get out of the device business and move to a zero-client environment, embracing BYOD capabilities along the way. “We wanted to be able to say, ‘You need only four things no matter where you are and we’ll get you the patient information you rely on: a user name, password, Internet connection and a device that supports Citrix,’” says Brister. The solution: Building a clinician-centric IT strategy and infrastructure To reach its goals, the IT group developed a strategy that focused on being clinician-centric, aligning its efforts over time with core initiatives such as CPOE and the build-out of a new hospital. In fact, the new hospital became a launching pad and showcase for IT as it evolved the application delivery infrastructure for greater efficiency and flexibility. Key Benefits • Delivers seamless roaming and less than five-second logins to simplify workflows, improve satisfaction and meet CPOE requirements • Saves nearly $750,000 per year spent on accessing health records • Increases IT efficiency despite rapid growth from acquisitions and new facility build-outs • Reduces the risk of potential HIPAA breaches • Addresses technology executive’s request for BYOD support in less than two weeks Citrix Products: • XenApp • XenDesktop • XenMobile Enterprise • NetScaler\n\n3. Case Study citrix.com Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System 3 Beginning in 1999 with XenApp, FMOLHS now provides employees and contractors with an end-to-end mobile workspace based on XenDesktop virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and application virtualization, XenMobile Enterprise with Worx Mobile Apps and ShareFile, and NetScaler. The customized healthcare-specific workspace takes advantage of critical Citrix partner solutions including tap-and-go badge access from Imprivata, medical-grade dictation software from Nuance, and a zero-client footprint using Dell Wyse Xenith clients. Key benefits Delivering seamless roaming and less than five-second logins to simplify workflows, improve satisfaction and meet CPOE requirements FMOLHS relies on Citrix solutions to streamline clinician workflows, reducing the time it takes to get to the “point of productivity,” while ensuring patient privacy and compliance with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) security rules. The FMOLHS mobile workspace delivers less than five-second access to desktops and all of the nonprofit’s 130 clinical applications, including EMR systems from both Cerner and Epic. It enables on-the-go staff and clinicians to securely and seamlessly roam across devices, facilities and networks, gaining instant access to critical patient data that could take away precious time with patients. It also helps the IT team address high-priority CPOE mandates. At the same time, the IT group can better accommodate custom requests for a specific user group, improving user satisfaction and empowering unique medical specialties with exactly what they need. “We don’t need to shy away from specific user requests like many typical IT departments do,” says Brister. “For instance, we can customize a web page or desktop in ways that make sense for that target user group rather than for all users.” Saving nearly $750,000 per year spent on accessing health records Delivering faster access to applications directly impacts the bottom line for FMOLHS. By reducing the number of clicks from four or five per endpoint interaction to just one click for initial login and zero clicks for subsequent reconnects with a badge and PIN, the IT team cut the time to access health records by 30 seconds per interaction, which saves the provider nearly $750,000 per year. Increasing IT efficiency despite rapid growth from acquisitions and new facility build-outs Citrix helps FMOLHS reduce the time, cost and resources associated with desktop and application management, despite the provider’s growing footprint. “With the old way of doing things [not zero client], we experienced a 10 to 15 percent failure rate for patching and updates to desktops and applications. It then took as many as 20 people across the state to clean up the failures,” says Brister. “Today, it takes one person for updates and we have a zero failure rate.” In fact, at FMOLHS, only three people are needed to manage the entire desktop virtualization infrastructure. With VDI and application virtualization from Citrix and zero clients from Dell, FMOLHS also cut device rollout and replacement times and device costs. “When new zero clients need to be deployed due to a failure or other issue, it’s a simple swap out and the device is up and running in minutes. A great example of this occurred when our team went through the first hospital to swap out. We had to replace every device on six floors of one hospital. It was projected that it would take five weeks to accomplish, but our two-person team finished in four days.” Reducing the risk of potential HIPAA breaches Previously, FMOLHS had shared desktops on each hospital floor where any employee could walk up and log in. A clinician could accidently save a file We’ve used Citrix to implement security controls and prevent breaches from occurring. XenApp, XenDesktop and XenMobile have all been critical in how we deliver essential applications or services while maintaining a very high level of security. - Johnny Brister Manager of Infrastructure and Technology Systems, Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System"
