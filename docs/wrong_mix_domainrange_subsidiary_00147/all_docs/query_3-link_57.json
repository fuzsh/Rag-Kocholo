        "meta_description": "Welcome to ZoomInfo's API. ZoomInfo is the leading data intelligence platform for B2B go-to-market teams, presenting a trifecta of the broadest, deepest and highest quality B2B data.\n\nUse the API to query the ZoomInfo database for relevant companies and contacts and enrich the data records in your Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Marketing Automation (MA), and other systems in your organization. The API helps you build out your organization's contact and company records by tapping in-depth information such as technologies used, company attributes, corporate hierarchies, funding details, news alerts and scoops, and more. This deep data enables teams to build sophisticated, refined, and targeted prospect segments, as well as improve campaign list building, prospecting, lead routing, scoring, and territory alignment.\n\n# API structure\n\nThe ZoomInfo API is a set of HTTPS endpoints you can use to programmatically retrieve and integrate ZoomInfo data into your existing technology stack and workflows. Responses are returned in JSON to support integration with common programming languages and development kits.\n\nThe Enterprise API supports searching for and enriching company and contact records, and are comprised as follows:\n\n**Standard APIs**\n\n- The [Search API](#20219386-4c34-485e-a859-c697d64f2ae9) accepts various input criteria which are used to return Contacts, Companies, Scoops, News and Intent records. The purpose of Search is to cast a wide net, returning a list of records that meet the input criteria. The records returned are previews of the full ZoomInfo profile. Use the Enrich API endpoints to return ZoomInfo's full profile for any record.\n- The [Enrich API](#4c495fb6-68df-44bb-8703-0616f81cfdcb) is used to retrieve ZoomInfo's full profile data by matching to known contacts or companies. Use the Enrich endpoints to redeem full profiles returned from Search queries, or enrich your existing database of contacts and companies with ZoomInfo data.\n- The [Lookup API](#efe7b4b8-1ef2-4fcd-a20f-9da68f6b2055) includes a set of endpoints that return available inputs and outputs for corresponding Search or Enrich requests. Use the Input Lookup endpoints to help select the input criteria supported by the different requests. The Lookup Output endpoints provide a full list of fields returned by each endpoint.\n- The [Usage API](#ec3704c0-8898-4ba7-baf4-c45b46ef80d3) lets you check your current API usage and limits.\n    \n\n**Scaling APIs**\n\n- The [Webhooks API](#0a3012d3-546c-45bd-9a3c-d014b93ce47e) is a set of endpoints that lets you configure webhooks subscriptions to automate the update of records - listening for events you subscribe to, and sending updates securely to your application.\n- The [Bulk API](#00c2d0c8-d0f6-4904-a5b1-495675e13189) is a set of endpoints that provide bulk search and redeem capabilities for Contacts and Companies, enabling the search and retrieval of large ZoomInfo Company and Contact datasets at scale through asynchronous batch processes.\n    \n\n**WebSights API**\n\nThe [WebSights API](#9e5ec7b8-5cef-40ee-86f3-105be2194fe7) identifies anonymous website traffic by resolving IP addresses to return company and ISP profiles and IP Geolocation details.\n\n**Compliance API**\n\nThe [Compliance API](#8631bd5c-4435-4fb4-9d4f-91b73cf7e89e) includes endpoints related to data privacy and opt-out compliance for contacts stored in the ZoomInfo database.\n\n# Authentication methods\n\nThe API supports the following authentication methods:\n\n- Private Key Infrastructure (PKI)\n- Username and password\n    \n\nFor both authentication methods, a Java Web Token (JWT) is returned which can be programmatically or manually used to access the API.\n\n## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication\n\nThe preferred authentication method is to obtain a Client ID and Private key pair and a public library to programmatically generate a JWT that is valid for one hour. To do this:\n\n1. Log in to the ZoomInfo GUI using admin credentials with API access.\n2. Go to **Admin Portal** &gt; **API** and click **Generate New Key**. You are provided with a Client ID and a Private Key.\n3. Import a public library that authenticates using this Client ID and Private Key and generates a JWT.\n    \n\nZoomInfo provides supported PKI authentication libraries for Java, Python and NodeJS in [Github](https://github.com/Zoominfo).\n\n## Username and password authentication\n\nYou can use the [Authentication endpoint](#ea1ebd5d-8b4a-412f-a8c8-3d8b8e123407) to manually supply your username and password, returning a JWT that is valid for one hour.\n\nA developer can alternatively import a public library that authenticates a username and password to return a JWT. ZoomInfo provides supported username and password authentication libraries for Java, Python and NodeJS in [Github](https://github.com/Zoominfo).\n\n# Rate and usage limits\n\nThe ZoomInfo API uses rate and usage limits tied to the account provisioned for API access. Your API account is provisioned with:\n\n- **Rate limits**: A limit to the number of requests you can make within a given time period.\n    - For the Authentication endpoint, the limit is 1 request per second.\n    - For the Standard APIs, WebSights API, and Compliance API, the limit is 25 requests per second (1500 request per minute).\n    - For the Scaling APIs, the limit is 33 requests per second (2000 requests per minute)\n- **Request limits**: An overall number of requests you can perform within the current API contract term.\n- **Record limits**: The number of records you are entitled to retrieve within the current API contract term.\n    \n\nYou can track usage status using the [Usage Lookup endpoint](#ec3704c0-8898-4ba7-baf4-c45b46ef80d3).\n\nYou can also track usage using the response headers of each API call (with the exception of the Authentication and Lookup endpoints).\n\n| Parameter | Sample Value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| X-RateLimit-Limit | 1500 | The maximum number of requests you're permitted to make per minute |\n| X-RateLimit-Remaining | 999 | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window |\n| X-RateLimit-Reset | 1583161964 | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in [UTC epoch seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) |\n| X-Usage-Record-Limit-Limit | 10000000 | The maximum number of records you can retrieve within the current API contract term |\n| X-Usage-Record-Limit-Remaining | 878530 | The remaining number of records you can retrieve within the current API contract term |\n| X-Usage-Request-Limit-Limit | 10000000 | The maximum number of requests you can make within the current API contract term. If using the Scaling API, this value will display \"-1\", as there are no limits to the total number of API requests you can make (provided you do not exceed the rate limit of 33 requests per second). |\n| X-Usage-Request-Limit-Remaining | 949262 | The number of requests remaining within the current API contract term |\n| X-Usage-Unique-Id-Limit-Limit | 100000 | The maximum number of person or company records you can redeem within the current API contract term. The limit for each API user is set in the Admin Portal. |\n| X-Usage-Unique-Id-Limit-Remaining | 84994 | The number of person or company records remaining to redeem within the current API contract term |\n| X-Usage-Websights-Api-Record-Limit-Limit | 10000000 | The max number of WebSights records you can retrieve within the current API contract term |\n| X-Usage-Websights-Api-Record-Limit-Remaining | 9999997 | The remaining number of WebSights records you can retrieve within the current API contract term |\n| X-Usage-Websights-Api-Request-Limit-Limit | 100000000 | The maximum number of WebSights requests you can make within the current API contract term |\n| X-Usage-Websights-Api-Request-Limit-Remaining | 99999997 | The number of WebSights requests remaining within the current API contract term |\n\n# Error handling and troubleshooting\n\n## HTTP status codes\n\nThe API will return standard classes of HTTP error status codes (4xx client and 5xx server codes) as well as 2xx success codes.\n\n## Common errors\n\nThe API will also return error messages specific to the request being performed. These error messages indicate a possible reason for a request failure.
