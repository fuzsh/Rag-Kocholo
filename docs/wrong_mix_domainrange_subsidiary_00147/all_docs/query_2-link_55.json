        "text": "What Agentless Monitoring?\n\nMonitoring IT infrastructures often involves the installation of agent software on target servers to collect performance metrics about the servers and application servers executing on them. The need to install and maintain agent software on all monitored servers is a key drawback with this approach.\n\nAgentless monitoring collects performance metrics from the infrastructure without installing any agent software on the servers or devices being monitored â€“ which makes the agentless approach easier to manage.\n\nWhat are Alarm Priorities?\n\nWhen an incident happens in an IT infrastructure or relating to an IT application, IT operations teams receive a number of alarms. Each alarm provides details of an abnormality in the IT infrastructure or with the application. Examples of alarms could be high CPU usage on a server, many blocked threads in an application, slow responses from the database, etc. To be able to troubleshoot issues, IT teams need to be able to set priorities for alarms, so they can focus on the highest priority alarms first.\n\nWhat is Amazon CloudWatch?\n\nAmazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service originally built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers. CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers. With investment in staff skillsets and configuration, CloudWatch can be used to detect anomalous behavior in your environments, set alarms, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep applications running smoothly.\n\nWhat is Amazon WorkSpaces?\n\nAmazon WorkSpaces is a managed, secure Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) solution that allows administrators to provision Windows and Linux desktops in minutes. An Amazon WorkSpace is a cloud-based virtual desktop that can act as a replacement for a traditional desktop. A WorkSpace is available as a bundle of compute resources, storage space, and software applications that allow a user to perform day-to-day tasks just like using a traditional desktop.\n\nWhat is Azure Monitor?\n\nAzure Monitor is Azure's native monitoring tool that can monitor your applications hosted on Azure and the Azure infrastructure. Azure Monitor can be to get useful dashboards and reports, but setting up the monitoring can be time-consuming and challenging. Manual setup is needed, and admins need to specify each metric and threshold. Furthermore, there is a cost per metric and even based on the type of threshold. This is where a third-party Azure monitoring tool like eG Enterprise helps. It is simple to setup, licensing is not per metric and you can even monitor multi-cloud deployments from a central console.\n\nWhat is Chaos Engineering?\n\nChaos Engineering is a discipline that aims to uncover weaknesses and improve the resilience of software systems by intentionally injecting controlled failures into them.\n\nRobust, resilient IT systems are crucial to data-driven operations. Whether these systems drive internal processes or deliver customer-facing services, the need for reliability and availability remains the same. So, why would you deliberately try to break your services? Chaos engineering does just that - deliberately terminating instances in your production environments.\n\nWhat is Citrix DaaS?\n\nCitrix Desktops-as-a-Service (DaaS) is a hybrid cloud service that allows you to securely deliver a high-performance virtual apps and desktops experience to any device. Whereas Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops was primarily meant for on-premises installation and delivery, with Citrix DaaS, the control plane is hosted and managed by Citrix.

It is designed to simplify the user experience and enhance productivity by offering a single point of access to all the resources needed to perform work tasks. Employees and remote workers can access their work environments remotely, even using mobile devices.\n\nWhat is Cloud Infrastructure?\n\nThe term \"Cloud Infrastructure\" has been used more frequently in recent years. In simple terms, cloud infrastructure refers to the virtualized, on-demand resources and services provided over the internet. It comprises computing power, storage, and networking capabilities delivered by hyperscale cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Users can access and manage these resources remotely, scaling up or down based on demand. This infrastructure eliminates the need for physical hardware, enabling flexibility, cost-efficiency, and rapid deployment of applications. It underpins cloud computing services, offering a foundation for businesses to host applications, store data, and leverage computing resources without the burden of managing traditional, on-premises infrastructure.\n\nWhat is Cloud Monitoring?\n\nSo your organization has decided to move to the cloud. Smart move! Many companies today are either making the move to the cloud or have already made it. According to RightScale's 2019 State of the Cloud Survey, 94% of IT professionals say their companies use the cloud. Over 90% is public cloud. Gartner predicts that public cloud revenue will increase by 17% in 2020. The biggest percentage increase is expected with IaaS.\n\nWhat is DaaS (Desktop as a Service)?\n\nDaaS is a technology solution that delivers virtual desktops and applications straight from the cloud to users' devices. Because some enterprises find it too expensive or time-consuming to create and deploy their own virtual desktops, they pay another company to do it for them.\n\nWhat is DevOps?\n\nThe term DevOps is a combination of the words \"development\" and \"operations\". In practice, DevOps is a collaborative approach to the work that is performed by an enterprise's IT operations staff and their application developers. Collaboration and communication between these two teams, who might otherwise function separately, are meant to increase the speed and quality of product or application releases.\n\nDigital Workspace Monitoring?\n\nEnsuring your digital workspaces are operating efficiently will help your team be more productive and accomplish mission-critical tasks. Whether it's tracking how quickly applications are running, monitoring for security breaches, or ensuring that collaboration tools are up and running, digital workspace monitoring keeps you in the know. If a problem arises with your digital workspaces, you can proactively address the issue to avoid costly downtime and employee frustration.\n\nThe history of Dizzion Frame and who Dizzon are\n\nDizzion is a company that was founded in 2011, at a time when traditional Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) from vendors such as VMware and Citrix were the de facto enterprise choice to deliver digital workspaces. Dizzion set out to offer an alternative by building an automation and services platform on top of the Omnissa (formerly VMware) Horizon stack, Dizzion delivered virtual desktops as a service before ï¿½Desktop as a Serviceï¿½ (DaaS) had become ï¿½a thingï¿½.\n\nWhat is Endpoint Monitoring?\n\nIn IT, an endpoint is an internet-capable hardware device on a TCP/IP network. An endpoint serves as a connection point for communicating with a network or accessing a service, it is often a device such as a computer or smartphone. Beyond consumer devices such as laptops and phones, the term endpoint now also encompasses devices such as tablets, information screens, thin clients, printers and other specialized hardware, such as actuators, point of sale (POS) terminals and smart meters.\n\nWhat is Endpoint Security Monitoring?\n\nEndpoint Security Monitoring is a cybersecurity practice that involves real-time surveillance and analysis of activities on individual devices within a network, such as laptops, workstations, thin clients, and mobile devices. Unlike traditional antivirus solutions, which focus on known threats, Endpoint Security Monitoring employs advanced techniques, including behavioral analysis and AIOps / machine learning, to detect and respond to both known and unknown threats. It provides continuous visibility into endpoint activities, enabling the identification of suspicious behavior, anomalies, and potential security incidents. This proactive approach helps organizations strengthen their defense against cyber threats, enhancing overall cybersecurity resilience at the device level.\n\nWhat is an F5 Load Balancer?\n\nAn F5 load balancer is a network solution (often a hardware device, although increasingly the term \"Load Balancer\" is used for software solutions) that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, enhancing the availability, performance, and reliability of applications and services. The term \"F5\" refers to products and services offered by F5, Inc., a company known for its application delivery networking (ADN) technology.\n\nWhat is Help Desk?\n\nJust about everyone in the business world has heard of a \"help desk\". You have probably used your company's help desk yourself on many occasions. But what is a help desk exactly? And more importantly, what does a help desk do, and why is it so important for your business?\n\nWhat is HTTP/2?\n\nHTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used for transferring web content over the Internet. It was developed to address the limitations and performance issues of its predecessor, HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 was standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in May 2015 as RFC 7540.\n\nWhat is Hybrid Cloud?\n\nHybrid cloud, at its best, seamlessly combines on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services, and public cloud resources, providing flexibility for organizations to manage workloads across diverse environments. This type of environment typically involves a connection from an on-premises data center to a public cloud and may also involve other private assets, including edge devices. This approach allows businesses to maintain control over sensitive data while utilizing the scalability and innovation offered by public cloud services, adapting to evolving IT needs.\n\nWhat is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?\n\nIaC, meaning \"infrastructure as code,\" involves defining the digital infrastructure you need using code instead of manual setups. Yes, you heard that right; it entails using code, just like what you work with when creating apps. With IaC, you script out the instructions and configurations for your virtual servers, operating systems, and other infrastructure components. You can then take these scripts, or templates, and use them to automatically provision and manage your tech stack. Infrastructure as code allows you to write your network just like you create your applications. Do you need more server space? Just update the code. Do you want to replicate your environment for a new project? Copy your code, and you'll be ready to launch your new project in no time. IaC turns your IT infrastructure into a repeatable, version-controlled template that is efficient, error-free, and easily shareable. Think of all the time and resources you'll save with this handy tool.\n\nWhat Is IT Infrastructure?\n\nIT infrastructure is the combined and interconnected components that are required to operate and manage an enterprise's IT environment. It encompasses the hardware, software, networks, facilities, and any other parts necessary to deliver IT service to employees within an organization, as well as to partners and customers outside of it.\n\nWhat is IT service management (ITSM)?\n\nIT Service Management (ITSM) is one of the most impactful and important aspects of your IT strategy. However, while many people may have heard of ITSM, unless you are directly involved with the associated processes, you might be uncertain about precisely what it is or what perks it provides.\n\nWhat is Java Heap Memory? What is Java Heap Space?\n\nIn Java, the heap memory refers to a region of the Java Virtual Machine's (JVM) memory that is dedicated to storing objects created during the execution of a Java program. It is one of the key components of the JVM's memory structure and is managed by the JVM's memory management subsystem.\n\nWhat is a Message Queue?\n\nA message queue is a form of communication used in distributed systems and software architectures where different components or processes need to communicate asynchronously. It is a mechanism that allows messages (packets of data) to be sent and received between different parts of a system without the components being directly connected or synchronized in time.\n\nWhat is Microsoft SQL Server?\n\nAs we prepare to take a deep dive into Microsoft's SQL Server, it is a pre-requisite to understand the answer to the surface-level question, \"What is SQL Server?\". Many relational database management systems (RDBMS) are built on what is known as Structured Query Language (SQL), a standardized programming language that makes it easier for IT professionals and database administrators (DBAs) to manage your data and query information within a server.\n\nWhat is Observability?\n\nApplied to IT, observability is how the current state of an application can be assessed based on the data it generates. Applications and the IT components they use provide outputs in the form of metrics, events, logs and traces (MELT). Analysis of metrics, logs and traces is used to estimate the health of the target application.\n\nWhat is On-premises?\n\n\"On-premises\" refers to the computing infrastructure, systems, software, and data that are located within an organization's physical premises or facilities, such as its office buildings or data centers. In an on-premises setup, the organization owns, maintains, and manages all aspects of its IT infrastructure, including hardware, networking equipment, servers, storage, and software, on its own premises rather than relying on cloud-based or off-site services. This approach contrasts with cloud computing, where services and resources are provided over the internet by third-party providers and are not physically located on the organization's premises.\n\nWhat is OpenShift? What is Red Hat OpenShift?\n\nOver the last couple of years, Kubernetes (often called K8s) has become the most popular and well-known container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. Scheduling containers at scale in a cloud-native ecosystem is central to the technology. Kubernetes itself is an open-source project, and as such presents challenges for many enterprises, especially in regulated industries with strong security requirements and formal SLA commitments.\n\nWhat is a Payment Gateway?\n\nA payment gateway is a technology that facilitates online transactions by acting as an intermediary between an online merchant, a customer, and the financial institutions involved in the transaction. It enables secure and seamless transfer of funds from the customer's payment source (such as a credit card, debit card, or digital wallet) to the merchant's account.\n\nWhat is RabbitMQ?\n\nRabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software that facilitates communication between different parts of a distributed system or between different applications.

Monitoring actual user interaction with a website or an application is important to operators to determine if users are being served quickly and without errors and, if not, which part of a business process is failing.\n\nWhat is Redis?\n\nRedis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory key-value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indices. Redis is open-source software released under a BSD 3-clause license although commercially supported paid versions are also available for enterprise users; Redis, Inc. commercially supports Redis Enterprise, which is available as an on-premises software deployment and a fully managed cloud service.\n\nWhat is Root Cause Analysis (RCA) - IT Monitoring?\n\nRoot Cause Analysis (RCA) within the context of monitoring tools refers to the process of identifying and addressing the fundamental reason behind a particular problem or incident in an IT infrastructure or application environment. Monitoring tools with root cause analysis capabilities aim to go beyond surface-level symptoms and identify the underlying issue that is causing disruptions, errors, or performance degradation.\n\nWhat is Root Cause Analysis - Business Processes?\n\nRoot cause analysis (RCA) is a foundational concept in business. But what is root cause analysis, exactly, and more importantly, how do you perform one?\n\nAs its name suggests, root cause analysis is a quality control strategy that allows you to uncover the underlying cause of an incident or issue.\n\nWhat is SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)?\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) is a web-based software deployment model that makes the software accessible through a web browser. As a user of SaaS software, you don't care where the software is hosted, which operating system it uses, or which language it is written in. The SaaS software is made accessible from any device as long you have an internet connection. With SaaS, you do not incur the capital cost of buying servers or software. The service provider shields you from software maintenance and you simply connect to the SaaS application via a console dashboard or API. Typical examples would include Microsoft Office 365, Intuit, Salesforce CRM, Zoom, ZoomInfo, Dropbox, Google Apps and many more that are for consumption by end-users. These applications run on the cloud and need not be downloaded to a local device. Webmail such as Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo, etc., is one of the earliest forms of SaaS.\n\nWhat is SharePoint?\n\nSharePoint is the main component of Office 365 that makes collaboration possible. In addition to file sharing and organization, it includes SharePoint Workflows, SharePoint PerformancePoint, and SharePoint project sites. Together, these apps facilitate sharing and managing data around the world. As with email, the Microsoft IIS, SharePoint servers and Microsoft SQL database servers needed to provide collaboration services are operated by Microsoft. IT organizations can administer and manage the collaboration services without having to worry about maintaining these servers, patching them at regular intervals, upgrading the software, etc. All these activities are handled by Microsoft as part of their SaaS offering.\n\nWhat is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?\n\nSite Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that combines software engineering and operations to ensure the reliable and efficient functioning of complex systems. SRE focuses on building and maintaining scalable, reliable, and highly available systems by applying software engineering principles to IT operations problems. It involves creating automation, monitoring, and incident response systems to proactively prevent and resolve issues. SRE teams work closely with development teams to improve system performance, reliability, and resilience. The goal of SRE is to minimize service disruptions, optimize performance, and continuously improve the overall reliability of a system or application.\n\nWhat is an SSL certificate?\n\nAn SSL certificate (Secure Sockets Layer certificate) is a digital certificate that authenticates and encrypts the communication between a web server and a client's web browser. It establishes a secure and encrypted connection, ensuring that data transmitted between the server and browser remains private and protected from eavesdropping or tampering.\n\nWhat is Stress Testing?\n\nStress testing in IT is a type of performance testing used to evaluate how a system or application performs under extreme conditions beyond its normal operational capacity. It involves subjecting the system to high loads, heavy traffic, or resource limitations to identify its breaking points, measure its stability, and determine its ability to recover gracefully. Stress testing helps uncover weaknesses, bottlenecks, and potential failure points in the system, allowing for improvements to be made before deployment to production.\n\nWhat is Synthetic Monitoring?\n\nOrganizations depend on fully functioning IT systems and processes to attract customers, deliver services and manage internal operations. The operation of these systems and processes directly impacts the business and reputation of each organization. Ensuring that all IT systems and processes are fully functional 24x7 is a key component of any organization's IT performance management strategy. This is where synthetic monitoring comes in.\n\nWhat is TCS BaNCS?\n\nTCS BaNCS is a global banking platform developed by Tata Consultancy Services for use by retail and corporate banks, digital-challenger, private, Islamic banks of varying sizes, co-operatives, non-banking financial institutions, micro-lenders, and credit unions to transform and modernize their core systems.

It enables users to define and provision infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, infrastructure is defined in code using a domain-specific language (DSL) - often HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), allowing for versioning, collaboration, and automation of infrastructure deployments. Terraform supports various cloud providers, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, as well as on-premises and hybrid environments. This means users can use the same tool for GCP, Azure, and AWS, and maintain a degree of cloud-agnosticism long-term.\n\nWhat is Uptime?\n\nThe current uptime of a server is measured as the amount of time that the server has been up and running since the last time it rebooted. Uptime is expressed in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Every time the server reboots, up time is reset to 0 (zero) and starts increasing as the server remains up and operational.\n\nWhat is VHD(x)?\n\nThe Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) format is a publicly available image format specification that allows encapsulation of the hard disk into an individual file for use by the operating system as a virtual disk in all the same ways physical hard disks are used. These virtual disks are capable of hosting native file systems (NTFS, FAT, exFAT, and UDFS) while supporting standard disk and file operations. VHD API support allows management of virtual disks. Virtual disks created with the VHD API can function as boot disks.\n\nWhat is Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)?\n\nMany organizations have adopted virtual desktop infrastructures to securely allow access to their corporate networks and applications to remote users. Users login to a portal and once authenticated, they can access their virtual desktop from the browser itself, or through a separate client (e.g., Citrix Workspace App, Horizon client, etc).\n\nWhat is VMware Horizon?\n\nVMware Horizon (formerly called VMware View) is a leading technology for secure delivery of virtual desktop and applications across private, public, and hybrid cloud environments. Using the Horizon Client application installed on client devices, users can connect to the Horizon infrastructure.
