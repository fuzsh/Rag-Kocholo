        "text": "I need to monitor 5 VMware vSphere servers in my environment. Each ESX server hosts 4 VMs. If I only want to monitor the host operating systems, and the status and resource usage of each of the guests both from within and outside, how many monitors would I require?\n\nIn the example above, if I want to monitor the application that is executing on each VM as well, then what would be my license requirement?\n\nIf I want to perform 'In-N-Out' monitoring of a VMware vSphere server and the 20 virtual desktops it hosts, how many monitors would I require?\n\nWhat application types does user/VM licensing cover?\n\nUser/VM licensing can be used for the following application/virtualization types in eG Enterprise: Citrix XenApp, Microsoft RDS server, 2x Terminal server, VMware Horizon RDS, VMware vSphere VDI, Citrix XenServer â VDI, Microsoft Hyper-V â VDI, RHEV Hypervisorâ VDI, Nutanix Acropolis VDI, Oracle VirtualBox, and Cloud Desktop.\n\nWhat about other application types?\n\nAll application types, other than the ones mentioned in the response to question 10 above, will use the server-based licensing model only.\n\nCan I use a mix of user/VM and server-based licensing in my environment?\n\nYes, you can. You can have the Citrix XenApp / RDS / hypervisor (hosting virtual desktops) / cloud desktop components in your environment managed using user/VM licensing and all other applications managed using server-based licensing.\n\nCan I have some XenApp servers governed by user/VM licensing and some others using the server-based model?\n\nNo, this is not possible. If user/VM licensing is enabled, then all Citrix XenApp/Terminal/VDI/cloud desktop components that are managed in your environment will use this licensing model only.\n\nCan I monitor the XenApp servers using user/VM-based licensing and the VDI servers using the server-based model?\n\nNo, this is not possible. Once your eG installation enables the User/VM Licensing model, it automatically applies to all the managed Citrix XenApp/Terminal/hypervisor (hosting virtual desktops)/cloud desktop components in your environment.\n\nCan I use a mix of named user/VM and concurrent user/VM licensing in my environment?\n\nNo, you cannot. At any given point in time, only one user/VM-based licensing option should be in use in the environment.\n\nI have managed a few Exchange servers in my environment. Later, I virtualized the Exchange servers, and enabled the user/deskotp-based licensing capability of my eG installation. Will this licensing model apply to the Exchange servers as well?\n\nNo, it will not. The Exchange servers will continue to consume premium monitor licenses.\n\nCan a single eG manager handle both user/VM-based licenses and server-based licenses?\n\nYes. A single eG manager is capable of handling a mix of user/VM-based and server-based licenses.\n\nHow do I know which type of user/VM-based licensing is enabled for my eG installation?\n\nTo know which type of user/VM-based licensing â named user/VM or concurrent user/VM â is enabled for your eG installation, do the following:\n\nLogin to the eG administrative interface.\n\nFollow the Users -> License Usage Overview menu sequence.\n\nWhen Figure 5 appears, scroll down to view the license usage section. In this section, if you find a Named Users/Desktops entry (as indicated by Figure 3), with a positive, non-zero value in the Allowed column, it is a clear indicator that the named user/VM licensing is enabled for your eG installation. On the other hand, if you find a Concurrent Users/Desktops entry, with a positive, non-zero value in the Allowed column, it indicates that concurrent user/VM licensing is enabled.\n\nIf you do not find such an entry in the license usage section, you can be rest assured that the user/VM licensing capability is not enabled for your eG installation.\n\nWhat happens once the named user/VM licensing capability is enabled?\n\nIf the Named User /Desktoplicense is enabled, then at the end of every day, the eG Enterprise system automatically computes the following:\n\nThe total number of âunique users who accessed any of the servers, virtual desktops (in the case of hypervisors hosting VDI), and cloud hosted desktops over the last 90 day period;\n\nThe total number of unique powered-on desktopsrunning on the hypervisor /cloud components to which no user has logged in during the last 90 days;\n\nThe total count of users and desktops is then stored in the eG backend.\n\nCan I detect a potential named user/VM license violation, before it occurs?\n\nYes, you can. For this, you need to access the Total License Usage tab page of of the license information page in the eG admin interface (see Figure 4). To access this page, click on the Users -> License Usage Overview. Figure 4 will then appear.\n\nThe license usage of eG Enterprise for this installation section helps you continuously track named user license usage and proactively detect a potential violation. This section reveals the maximum number of Named Users/Desktops that the eG installation allows, and also reports the number and percentage of named user/VM licenses that are currently utilized. By comparing the Allowed limit with the count of currently used named user/VM licenses, you can quickly figure out if license usage is optimal or is close to exhaustion. For instance, from Figure 4 above, you can easily infer that 2 out of the 100 named user/VM licenses granted to an eG installation have been used up - this implies that only 2% of the licenses are in use. Moreover, you can quickly drill down from this section to identify the precise users who are consuming the named user license, and the types of components ( they are accessing). For that, click on the 'user' icon alongside the label Named Users/Desktops in Figure 4. Figure 5 will then appear, where the users will be listed grouped by the component-types they are accessing.\n\nYou can also track how the named user/VM licenses are used per day by clicking the graph icon against Named Users/Desktops in Figure 4. Figure 6 will then appear.\n\nWhat happens when the named user/VM license is violated?\n\nIf the Named User/VM license is enabled, then at the end of every day, the eG Enterprise system automatically computes the following:\n\nThe total number of âunique users who accessed any of the servers, virtual desktops (in the case of hypervisors hosting VDI), and cloud hosted desktops over the last 90 day period;\n\nThe total number of unique powered-on desktopsrunning on the hypervisor /cloud components to which no user has logged in during the last 90 days;\n\nEvery day, eG Enterprise computes the total count of unique users/desktops and stores this count in the eG backend. The solution then checks the values so stored in the last 14 days for violations. When performing this check, if the solution finds that the total number of unique users/desktops on any day during the last 14 days exceeds the licensed number of Named Users/Desktops, then a license violation is registered. If the solution finds that such a violation has occurred only once during the last 14 days, then the next time you log into the eG management console, the following message will appear warning you of the consequences of a continued violation:\n\nA similar warning message (as depicted by Figure 7) will appear for every subsequent violation that is detected in the last 14 days, till the sixth violation. However, if the Named User/VM license is violated for the seventh time around in 14 days, any subsequent attempt to login to the eG management console will result in the following message:\n\nWithin 5 minutes of detection of the seventh violation (in 14 days), the eG agents will stop monitoring all managed Thin Client, hypervisor (hosting virtual desktops), and cloud desktop components. Moreover, you will not be able to add/manage any additional components of such types until you obtain additional Named User/VM licenses.\n\nIf any of these messages pop-up when you login to the eG management console, then, you can navigate to the TOTAL LICENSE USAGE page to view more details of the violation.\n\nIn the example of Figure 9, you can see that while only 5 named users/desktops were Allowed by the eG license, 15 unique users/desktops have actually been detected in the thin client/VDI/cloud desktop components during the last 90 days. Since the environment is supporting more than the allowed number of distinct users/desktops, the Usage (%) has been automatically set to <100 in the case of this example (see Figure 9).\n\nIf the user/VM license is violated for the seventh time in 14 days, then, do all tests mapped to the managed thin client, VDI, and cloud desktop components stop running automatically?\n\nNo. The eG agents will stop executing the following tests if 7 out of 14 records report violations.\n\nThe application-level tests mapped to the managed Citrix XenApp, Microsoft RDS server, 2x Terminal server, VMware Horizon RDS servers;\n\nAll the inside-view tests of the managed VMware vSphere VDI, Citrix XenServer â VDI, Microsoft Hyper-V â VDI, RHEV Hypervisorâ VDI, Nutanix Acropolis VDI, Oracle VirtualBox, and Cloud Desktop components;\n\nA few outside-view tests of the managed VMware vSphere VDI, Citrix XenServer â VDI, Microsoft Hyper-V â VDI, RHEV Hypervisorâ VDI, Nutanix Acropolis VDI, Oracle VirtualBox components.\n\nThis implies that the host-level tests of these components will continue to run and report metrics.\n\nHow soon will components start reporting metrics once additional named user/VM licenses are applied?\n\nIf eG agents had stopped monitoring the managed Thin Client, VDI, and cloud desktop components owing to a Named User/VM license violation, then, these agents will start monitoring the above-mentioned components within 5-10 minutes of the deployment of a new license allowing additional Named Users/Desktops.\n\nWhat happens when the concurrent user/VM license is violated?\n\nIf the Concurrent User/VM license is enabled, then every 30 minutes (by default), the eG manager automatically computes the total number of users/desktops on the managed Thin Client , hypervisor (hosting virtual desktops), and cloud desktop components in the environment in the last 30 minutes, and stores this value in the eG backend. At the end of the day, these values are compared and the maximum value for the day is determined. If the maximum number of concurrent users/desktops on any day during the last 14 days exceeds the licensed number of Concurrent Users/Desktops, then a license violation is registered. If the eG manager finds that such a violation has occurred only once during the last 14 days, then the next time you log into the eG management console, a message will appear warning you of the consequences of a continued violation.\n\nA similar warning message will appear for every subsequent violation that is detected in the last 14 days, till the sixth violation. However, if the Concurrent User/VM license is violated for the seventh time in 14 days, any subsequent attempt to login to the eG management console will result in a message that informs you of the violation and explains that thin client, VDI, and cloud desktop components will no longer be monitored by the eG agents.\n\nWithin 5 minutes of detection of the seventh violation (in 14 days), the eG agents will stop monitoring all managed Thin Client, VDI, and cloud desktop components. Moreover, you will not be able to add/manage any additional components of such types until you obtain additional Concurrent User/VM licenses.\n\nCan I detect a potential concurrent user/VM license violation, before it occurs?\n\nYes, you can. For this, you need to access the Total License Usage tab page of the license information page of the eG admin interface (see Figure 10). To access this page, click on the Users -> License Usage Overview menu sequence in the eG admin interface. Then, click on the Total License Usage tab page of the LICENSE INFORMATION page that appears.Figure 10 will then appear.\n\nThe license usage of eG Enterprise for this installation section helps you continuously track concurrent user/VM license usage and proactively detect a potential violation. This section reveals the maximum number of Concurrent Users/Desktops that the eG installation allows, and also reports the number and percentage of concurrent user/VM licenses that are currently utilized. By comparing the Allowed limit with the count of currently used concurrent user/VM licenses, you can quickly figure out if license usage is optimal or is close to exhaustion. For instance, from Figure 10 above, you can easily infer that 31 out of the 2000 concurrent user/VM licenses granted to an eG installation have been used up - this implies that only 1.55% of the licenses are in use. Moreover, you can quickly drill down from this section to identify the precise users that are consuming the concurrent user/VM license, and the types of components. For that, click on the 'user' icon alongside the label Concurrent Users/Desktops in Figure 10. Figure 11 will then appear, where the users will be listed grouped by the component-types they are accessing.\n\nYou can also track how the concurrent user/VM licenses are used per day by clicking the graph icon against Concurrent Users/Desktops in Figure 10. Figure 12 will then appear.\n\nIf a single user logs into three different servers, what would be the unique user count that eG reports for user/VM-based licensing?\n\nBy default, if a single user accesses three different servers (of three different types), eG Enterprise will report the unique user count as 1. This default behavior is governed by the UniqueUserNameAcrossTypes flag in the [User_cert] section of the eg_ui.ini file (in the <EG_INSTALL_DIR>\\manager\\config directory). By default, this flag is set to Yes. If you set it to No, then, if the same user accesses virtual desktops on say, a Citrix XenServer, VMware vSphere server, and Microsoft Hyper-V, then the unique user count will be reported as 3.\n\nNote:\n\nThis flag setting does not impact how the unique user count is calculated in the following scenarios:\n\nThe same user accesses different virtual desktops on the same server - eg., user sam accessing desktops VD1 and VD2 on the same Citrix XenServer;\n\nThe same user accessing virtual desktops on different servers of the same type - eg., user sam accessing desktop VD1 on Citrix XenServer A and desktop VD2 on Citrix XenServer B.\n\nIn both the aforesaid cases, regardless of the status of the UniqueUserNameAcrossTypes flag, the unique user count will always be 1.\n\nNote that the 'UniqueUserNameAcrossTypes' flag also governs how the unique desktop count is computed, if a virtual desktop with the same name is running on different servers (of different types).\n\nIf the user âeguserâ logs into a server, once as âeguserâ and another time as âmas\\eguserâ (where âmasâ is the domain name), what would be the unique user count that eG reports for user/VM-based licensing?\n\nBy default, if the same user logs into a server twice â once with and once without a domain name prefix - eG Enterprise will disregard the domain name prefix and will treat both logins as if they were performed by the same user. In this case therefore, the unique user count will be 1. This default behavior is governed by the ExcludeDomainName flag in the [User_cert] section of the eg_ui.ini file (in the <EG_INSTALL_DIR>\\manager\\config directory). By default, this flag is set to Yes. If you set it to No, then, eG Enterprise will treat each login as if it was performed by a different user and report the unique user count as 2."
