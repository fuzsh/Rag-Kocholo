        "text": "NVIDIA License System User Guide\n\nDocumentation for system administrators that explains how to install, configure, and manage the NVIDIA License System.\n\nThe NVIDIA License System is used to provide software licenses to licensed NVIDIA software products. The licenses that the NVIDIA License System provides are obtained from the NVIDIA Licensing Portal.\n\nNote:\n\nNVIDIA vGPU software releases earlier than 13.0 do not support NVIDIA License System. For full details of NVIDIA vGPU software releases that support NVIDIA License System, refer to NVIDIA License System Release Notes.\n\n1.1. Introduction to NVIDIA Software Licensing\n\nTo activate licensed functionalities, a licensed client must obtain a software license when it is booted.\n\nNVIDIA License System supports the types of licensing for licensed clients:\n\nNetworked-licensing: A client with a network connection obtains a license by leasing it from a NVIDIA License System service instance. The service instance serves the license to the client over the network from a pool of floating licenses obtained from the NVIDIA Licensing Portal. The license is returned to the service instance when the licensed client no longer requires the license.\n\nNode locked-licensing: A client system without a network connection or on an air-gapped network can obtain a node-locked NVIDIA vGPU software license from a file installed locally on the client system.\n\nNote:\n\nSupport for node-locked licensing was introduced in NVIDIA vGPU software 15.0. It is not supported in earlier NVIDIA vGPU software releases.\n\n1.2. About Service Instances\n\nA service instance is required to serve licenses to licensed clients.\n\nNVIDIA License System supports the following types of service instances:\n\nCloud License Service (CLS) instance. A CLS instance is hosted on the NVIDIA Licensing Portal.\n\nDelegated License Service (DLS) instance. A DLS instance is hosted on-premises at a location that is accessible from your private network, such as inside your data center.\n\nTo provide isolation for performance, security, and ease of administration, you can deploy multiple service instances as needed. For example, you can deploy service instances in distinct physical locations by deploying a DLS instance in each of your data centers. You can also use a mixture of CLS and DLS instances to serve your licenses to licensed clients.\n\nNote:\n\nYou cannot mix CLS and DLS instances in a high availability (HA) cluster of service instances. Each node in an HA cluster must be a DLS instance.\n\n1.2.1. About Cloud License Service (CLS) Instances\n\nA Cloud License Service (CLS) instance is hosted on the NVIDIA Licensing Portal.\n\nBecause a CLS instance is hosted on the NVIDIA Licensing Portal, you do not need to download licenses from the NVIDIA Licensing Portal and upload them to the instance.\n\nHosting a CLS instance on a cloud service provides robustness and dynamic scalability for the CLS instance. Because a CLS instance is maintained by NVIDIA and the cloud service provider, feature and maintenance updates are generally transparent to users.\n\n1.2.2. About Delegated License Service (DLS) Instances\n\nA Delegated License Service (DLS) instance is hosted on-premises at a location that is accessible from your private network, such as inside your data center.\n\nBecause a DLS instance is fully disconnected from the NVIDIA Licensing Portal, you must download licenses from the NVIDIA Licensing Portal and upload them to the instance manually.\n\n1.3. About the NVIDIA Licensing Portal\n\nThe NVIDIA Licensing Portal provides access to the entitlements that you purchased and the licenses that they contain.\n\nTo be able to download NVIDIA vGPU software licenses, you must create at least one license server on the NVIDIA Licensing Portal and allocate licenses in your entitlements to the server. You can also distribute your licenses across multiple license servers as necessary, add new licensed products to an existing server, and delete license servers that you no longer require.\n\nTo help you manage your entitlements and licenses on the NVIDIA Licensing Portal, you can add other users as registered contacts in the organization associated with your NVIDIA Enterprise Account. To secure your entitlements and licenses, NVIDIA Licensing Portal provides role-based access for all registered contacts. For more information, see Managing Contacts on the NVIDIA Licensing Portal.\n\nBy default, all entitlements are associated with a top-level organization and are accessible to all contacts in the organization. If you need to allow only specific groups of contacts within your organization to access specific entitlements, you can partition your entitlements into isolated segments. However, if a single collection of entitlements that spans your entire organization meets your business needs, you can leave all your entitlements in the top-level organization.\n\nTo partition your entitlements into isolated segments, NVIDIA Licensing Portal provides the ability to create virtual groups and assign entitlements and contacts to them. For more information, see Managing Virtual Groups.\n\n1.4. High Availability for NVIDIA License System DLS Instances\n\nTo provide licensed clients with continued access to licenses if a DLS instance fails, you can configure DLS instances for high availability.\n\nHigh availability requires at least two DLS instances in a failover configuration:\n\nA primary DLS instance, which is actively serving licenses to licensed clients\n\nOne or more secondary DLS instances, which act as a backup for the primary DLS instance\n\nNote:\n\nNVIDIA License System supports a maximum cluster size of nine DLS instances.\n\nSupport for clusters of more than two instances was introduced in NVIDIA vGPU software 16.1. Earlier NVIDIA vGPU software releases support clusters of only two instances.\n\nConfiguring multiple DLS instances in a failover configuration increases availability because simultaneous failure of multiple instances is rare. The primary and secondary DLS instances work together to ensure that licenses in the enterprise remain continually available to licensed clients.\n\nIf the primary DLS instance fails, failover occurs. One of the secondary DLS instances becomes the primary instance and begins to serve licenses. In a cluster of more than two instances, the secondary instance that has the longest uptime becomes the primary instance. The DLS instance that failed becomes a secondary instance when it is returned to service. The next time that failover occurs, the primary DLS instance becomes a secondary DLS instance again.\n\nNote:\n\nTo ensure that licenses in the enterprise remain continually available after failure of the primary DLS instance, return the failed DLS instance to service as quickly as possible to restore high availability support. After failure of a DLS instance in a cluster of two instances, the remaining instance becomes a single point of failure.\n\nDuring normal operation, the primary DLS instance continually updates the secondary DLS instances with information about the licenses that are being served to clients.\n\nFor more information about configuring DLS instances for high availability, see Configuring an HA Cluster of DLS Instances.\n\n1.5. Heartbeat Checks for DLS Failover\n\nIn a High Availability (HA) cluster, the Heartbeat service, running on every node, monitors the health of DLS appliances and triggers a failover when an unhealthy node is detected based on one of the following criteria. In the event of a failover, one of the secondary nodes assumes the role of the primary node to serve the requests, and the previous primary node takes on the role of the secondary node.\n\nFailover Criteria\n\nService health check using health end point of service:\n\nThis check verifies whether all services are running in a healthy state and are responsive.\n\nEvery service has a health endpoint. The Heartbeat service will monitor the endpoint to check if the service is responsive.\n\nDatabase connection check:\n\nThe database connection check verifies whether the database is responsive.\n\nAs part of this check, a lightweight query will be executed.\n\nIf the database is not responsive, it will result in a client request failure.\n\nResource exhaustion check:\n\nThis check verifies whether any resources (CPU, RAM, and disk) have exceeded the predefined thresholds.\n\nExhaustion of resources impacts system stability, so this is a proactive action for a failover.\n\nApplication failure:\n\nApplication failure check verifies whether client requests are serviced successfully.\n\nIf the percentage of failures over a predefined time interval crosses the predefined threshold, a failover gets triggered.\n\nThis is distinct from the service health check, which verifies if the service is responsive.\n\nThis check monitors failures in servicing requests. Only authentication and lease operations are monitored for application failure.\n\nSecondary node monitoring of primary node health:\n\nThis check verifies if the primary node is running and if the lease service is responsive.\n\nAs part of the lease response check, a read query (get lease count) is executed by the lease monitoring service.\n\nIn summary, a failover occurs when any of the following conditions is detected:\n\nServices are not responsive.\n\nThe database is not responsive.\n\nResources are exhausted.\n\nFailures are observed for authentication and lease operations.\n\nA secondary node observes that the primary node is down.\n\n1.5.1. Recovery Actions for DLS Failover\n\nYou can perform the following actions for recovering a DLS virtual appliance from a failover.\n\nResource exhaustion:\n\nTake appropriate actions based on the respective resources:\n\nFor CPU or RAM exhaustion: Increase the assigned vCPU or RAM, or check the maximum supported load for a single DLS instance and reduce the load.\n\nFor the performance numbers, see Sizing Guidelines for a DLS Appliance.\n\nFor disk space exhaustion: Increase the available disk space or free up more disk space.\n\nFor the disk space cleanup script, see Expanding the Disk Space on a DLS Virtual Appliance.\n\nApplication restart might help free up RAM and CPU resources.\n\nDatabase connection failure:\n\nRestart the application to bring the appliance to a healthy state if the database is recoverable.\n\nCheck for resource limits, such as memory, CPU, and disk space, to ensure they are not exhausted in unlikely scenarios where failover check of resource exhaustion does not detect in advance.\n\nFollow the instructions described in Restarting the DLS Virtual Appliance to restart.\n\nTo verify if the database has been restored, you can do either of the following checks:\n\nCheck whether the user interface is performing correctly.\n\nCheck database connection by using the health endpoint after 10 minutes.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\ncurl -k --location \"https://<Node_IP>/service_instance_manager/v1/health?op=db\"\n\nThe expected response code is displayed as follows:\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n{\"isServiceHealthy\":true}\n\nService health check failure:\n\nRestart the application to bring the appliance to a healthy state by following the instructions described in Restarting the DLS Virtual Appliance.\n\nApplication failure:\n\nRestart the application to bring the appliance to a healthy state by following the instructions described in Restarting the DLS Virtual Appliance.\n\nPower failure:\n\nEnsure that power is restored.\n\nIf none of the preceding actions can recover the appliance successfully, contact NVIDIA Enterprise Support.\n\n1.5.2. Restarting the DLS Virtual Appliance\n\nTo restart a DLS virtual appliance, choose an appropriate action based on your appliance.\n\nVM-Based DLS Appliances\n\nThere are two methods to initiate the restart:\n\nMethod 1: Reboot the VM.\n\nMethod 2: Log in using the rsu_admin user, and then execute the systemctl command to restart applicationStartup.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\nsudo systemctl restart applicationStartup\n\nContainer-Based DLS Appliances\n\nDocker containers:\n\nRun the following command to restart.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml restart\n\nTo simplify the installation and administration of the DLS, the DLS is distributed as a software image to be installed or deployed on a supported platform. The DLS is a secure, hardened environment in which access to the application software is strictly controlled.\n\nThe following types of DLS software image are available:\n\nA virtual appliance image to be installed in a VM on a supported hypervisor\n\nA containerized software image for deployment on a supported container orchestration platform\n\nAn installable package for installation on a supported OS running in a virtualized server environment on your choice of hypervisor or on a bare-metal server\n\nEach DLS software image is configured with a single standard user account for accessing the DLS appliance and an account with sudo user privileges for installing updates to the DLS appliance software. Modifications to these accounts are strictly controlled. You cannot add other user accounts to the software image. However, you can use a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) directory instead of the configured accounts for managing user access to a DLS appliance.\n\nIn each VM-based virtual appliance image, the DLS application software is containerized to allow limited access to the OS so that non-root users can install security compliance and scanning tools in the VM. However, a container orchestration platform cannot control or restrict access to the OS on which the platform is running.\n\nIn the package for installation on a supported OS, the DLS application software is containerized to ensure that all software dependencies are met and to isolate the DLS application software from the underlying OS.\n\nAs far as possible, the DLS appliances based on all types of software image are functionally equivalent. Therefore, whether to use a container-based DLS appliance, a VM-based DLS appliance, or a DLS appliance from a package for installation on a supported OS depends on the requirements of your IT infrastructure or the policies of your IT department. For additional guidelines, refer to the following resources from the vendors of platforms that support NVIDIA License System:\n\nCitrix: Containers or Virtual Machines? It Doesn’t Have to Be One or the Other.\n\nMicrosoft: Containers vs. virtual machines\n\nRed Hat: Containers vs VMs\n\nVMware: Why use containers vs. VMs?\n\n2.1. Platform Requirements for a DLS Virtual Appliance or Containerized DLS Software Image\n\nBefore proceeding, ensure that you have a platform suitable for hosting a DLS virtual appliance or containerized DLS software image.\n\nThe hosting platform must be a physical host running a supported hypervisor or container orchestration platform.\n\nThe minimum resource requirements for the VM in which the DLS virtual appliance or DLS container will run is as follows:\n\nNumber of vCPUs: 4\n\nRAM: 8 Gbytes\n\nDisk Size: 15 Gbytes\n\nFor additional guidelines, refer to Sizing Guidelines for a DLS Appliance.\n\nThe platform must have a fixed (unchanging) IP address. The IP address may be assigned dynamically by DHCP or statically configured, but must be constant.\n\nThe platform’s date and time must be set accurately. NTP is recommended.\n\nNote:\n\nBefore proceeding with the installation, refer to NVIDIA License System Release Notes for details of supported hypervisors, details of supported container orchestration platforms, and known issues.\n\n2.2. Host Name Resolution Requirements for a DLS Virtual Appliance\n\nThe platform that hosts a DLS virtual appliance must be identified by its IP address or its fully qualified domain name. It can also be identified by its CNAME. If you want to identify the platform by its fully qualified domain name, ensure that the required DNS entries are set before installing the DLS virtual appliance. If you want to identify the platform by its default host name, you must set a DNS entry that maps the default host name to the fully qualified domain name.\n\nThe process for setting these DNS entries is separate from the process for installing the DLS virtual appliance. Use the standard interfaces of the name resolution service that you are using to set the required DNS entries.\n\nTip:\n\nWhenever possible, set DNS entries for the platform that hosts a DLS virtual appliance. If the DNS entries are set, the DLS appliance can be accessed through both its IP address and its fully qualified domain name.\n\nDetermining Whether the Forward Pointer and Reverse Pointer DNS Entries Are Correct\n\nFor each mapping between a domain name and an IP address, ensure that you set both the forward pointer and reverse pointer DNS entries. A DLS virtual appliance requires the reverse pointer entry to determine the domain name of the DLS virtual appliance when creating a client configuration token.\n\nNote:\n\nFor the reverse pointer DNS entry on a Windows DNS server, use all lowercase for the fully qualified domain name.\n\nTo determine whether the forward pointer and reverse pointer DNS entries have been set correctly, type the following commands in a shell on any UNIX or Linux host on the same network as the DLS virtual appliance:\n\nFor the forward pointer entry, type:\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ host domain-name\n\ndomain-name\n\nThe domain name for which you want to determine whether the forward pointer DNS entry is correct.\n\nIf the DNS entry has been set correctly, the command displays the IP address that is mapped to the domain name.\n\nFor the reverse pointer entry, type:\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ host ip-address\n\nip-address\n\nThe IP address for which you want to determine whether the reverse pointer DNS entry is correct.\n\nIf the DNS entry has been set correctly, the command displays the domain name that is mapped to the IP address.\n\nHow a DLS Instance Determines Whether a Fully Qualified Domain Name Is Set\n\nHow a DLS instance determines whether a fully qualified domain name is set depends on the type of DLS instance.\n\nVM-based DLS virtual appliance: When the VM that hosts a DLS instance starts, the DLS instance checks whether a fully qualified domain name is mapped to the IP address of the VM. If a name is mapped to the IP address of the VM, the DLS instance retrieves the name to display in the user interface of the NVIDIA Licensing application on the appliance.\n\nContainerized DLS Software Image: The fully qualified domain name is set through an environment variable. When the container within which the DLS software image is deployed is started, the DLS instance checks whether this environment variable is set.\n\nNote:\n\nLicensed clients outside the container must be able to resolve the fully qualified domain name. The environment variable must not specify a name that can be resolved only by the container orchestrator.\n\nIf this environment variable is set, the DLS instance retrieves the name to display in the user interface of the NVIDIA Licensing application on the appliance.\n\nIf this environment variable is not set, a user cannot connect to the container in which the DLS software image is deployed through a fully qualified domain name, even if a fully qualified domain name is mapped to an IP address in the DNS server.\n\nFor more information, refer to Setting Properties for a Containerized DLS Software Image.\n\nHow the Host Name of the VM or Container that Hosts a DLS Instance Is Set\n\nHow the host name of the VM or container that hosts a DLS instance is set depends on the type of DLS instance.\n\nVM-based DLS virtual appliance: The host name is preset in the virtual appliance image.\n\nThe host name of a standalone DLS virtual appliance is preset to nls-si-0.\n\nThe host names of the DLS virtual appliances in an HA cluster are preset to nls-si-0 and nls-si-1.\n\nThe host name can be changed as explained in Changing the Host Name of a VM-Based DLS Virtual Appliance.\n\nContainerized DLS Software Image: The host name is set through an environment variable. If this environment variable is not set, the container orchestration platform sets the host name to the container ID. For more information, refer to Setting Properties for a Containerized DLS Software Image.\n\nCNAME Identification: The platform that hosts a DLS virtual appliance can also be identified by its CNAME.\n\n2.3. Communications Ports Requirements\n\nTo enable communication between a licensed client and a CLS or DLS instance, specific ports must be open in your firewall or proxy server. If you are using an HA cluster of DLS instances with a firewall or proxy server between the DLS instances, additional ports must be open in your firewall or proxy server.\n\nCommunications Ports Between a Licensed Client and a CLS Instance\n\nTo enable communication between a licensed client and a CLS instance, the following ports must be open in your firewall or proxy server:\n\nPort Protocol Egress / Ingress Protocol / Service From To 80 TLS, TCP Egress License release Client CLS 443 TLS, TCP Egress\n\nLicense acquisition\n\nLicense renewal\n\nClient CLS\n\nNote:\n\nPort 80 is used by all Windows VMs to release the licenses during the time the VM is shutdown.\n\nPort 443 is used for returning the license at the time of license renewal and for license releases during normal operations by all VMs except Windows VMs.\n\nCommunications Ports Between a Licensed Client and a DLS Instance\n\nTo enable communication between a licensed client and a DLS instance, the following ports must be open in your firewall or proxy server:\n\nPort Protocol Egress / Ingress Protocol / Service From To 80 TLS, TCP Egress License release Client DLS 443 TLS, TCP Egress\n\nLicense acquisition\n\nLicense renewal\n\nLicense release\n\nClient DLS\n\nNote:\n\nPort 80 is used by all Windows VMs to release the licenses during the time the VM is shutdown.\n\nPort 443 is used for returning the license at the time of license renewal and for license releases during normal operations by all VMs except Windows VMs.\n\nThe following ports for client to DLS connections are no longer required, but are supported for backward compatibility: 8081, 8082.\n\nFor a container-based DLS appliance, ports 80 and 443 might not be available for the DLS appliance to bind to, either because the container orchestrator administrator has restricted access to these ports or because the ports are in use by other containers. In this situation, you must set the environment variables DLS_HTTP_PORT and DLS_HTTPS_PORT to the ports that the DLS appliance must bind to. For more information, refer to Setting Properties for a Containerized DLS Software Image.\n\nCommunications Ports Between DLS Instances in an HA Cluster\n\nIf you are using an HA cluster of DLS instances with a firewall or proxy server between the DLS instances, the following ports must also be open in the firewall or proxy server:\n\nPort Containerized Instance VM-Based Instance Protocol Egress/Ingress Protocol/Service From To 443 - ✔ TLS, TCP Both Licensing Services Primary DLS Secondary DLS 4369 ✔ ✔ EPMD (peer discovery) Both RabbitMQ, Erlang Primary DLS Secondary DLS 5671 ✔ ✔ AMQP, TLS Both RabbitMQ Primary DLS Secondary DLS 8080 ✔ ✔ HTTPS Both Licensing Services Primary DLS Secondary DLS 8081 ✔ ✔ HTTPS Both Licensing Services Primary DLS Secondary DLS 8082 ✔ ✔ HTTPS Both Licensing Services Primary DLS Secondary DLS 8083 ✔ ✔ HTTPS Both Licensing Services Primary DLS Secondary DLS 8084 ✔ ✔ HTTPS Both Licensing Services Primary DLS Secondary DLS 8085 ✔ ✔ HTTPS Both Licensing Services Primary DLS Secondary DLS\n\n✔ Port is used.\n\n- Port is not used.\n\nThe following ports that were required to be open in earlier releases are no longer used:\n\n22\n\n1883\n\n5672\n\n8883\n\n15672\n\n25671\n\n25672\n\n61613\n\n61614\n\nCommunications Ports in the Container Orchestrator\n\nThe following ports must be available in the container orchestrator to allow the DLS appliance container to bind to them:\n\nPort Service 8080, 18080 Administration Service 8081, 18081 Authorization Service 8082, 18082 Licensing Services 8083, 18083 File Installation 8084, 18084 Service Instance 8085 Virtual Appliance Service 9001 Process Manager (supervisord) 25672 RabbitMQ\n\n2.4. Sizing Guidelines for a DLS Appliance\n\nUse the measured performance numbers to determine the optimum configuration for your container-based or VM-based DLS appliances based on the expected number and frequency of requests from licensed clients.\n\nNote:\n\nFor the corresponding data for a CLS instance, refer to Performance Data for a CLS Instance.\n\n2.4.1. Throughput for a DLS Appliance\n\nThroughput measures the number of clients that a VM-based or container-based DLS appliance can process in 1 second.\n\nNote:\n\nAll measurements were taken with a CPU clock speed of 3 GHz.\n\nFor a VM-based DLS appliance, the disk size is preset to 15 Gbytes in the virtual appliance image. If you want to retain diagnostic log files for longer than the default period of three months, increase the disk size in the appliance.\n\nThe measurements for a container-based DLS appliance were taken from a Docker container in an Ubuntu VM. Only the containers for the DLS appliance were running in the VM while the measurements were taken.\n\nIf you increase the number of vCPUs, you must increase the total RAM in GB to twice the number of vCPUs. For a container-based DLS appliance, increasing the number of vCPUs increases the number of worker threads. If the number of vCPUs is increased without an increase in the total RAM, some workers or services might fail.\n\nNumber of vCPUs Total RAM (GB) RAM Consumed (GB) Throughput (Clients per Second) Average Response Time (ms) 4 8 4.5 5 74 6 12 6 9 84 8 16 8 13 87\n\n2.4.2. Scalability for a DLS Appliance\n\nScalability measures the maximum number of licensed clients that a VM-based or container-based DLS appliance can serve in a specific interval. A DLS appliance serves a licensed client by performing a licensing operation for the client, namely the borrowing, return, or renewal of a license. Registration of a licensed client is not considered a licensing operation because it occurs only once for any client.\n\nThese measurements capture the maximum number of licensed clients that DLS appliances with varying numbers of vCPUs and amounts of RAM can serve when licenses are borrowed for 12 hours. The maximum number of clients is directly proportional to the length of time for which licenses are borrowed. If the length of time increases, the maximum number of clients also increases.\n\nTo calculate the maximum number of clients from the length of time for which licenses are borrowed, use the following formula: max-clients=clients-per-second⨯60⨯(renewal-interval-percentage/100)⨯borrow-time-in-hours⨯60\n\nmax-clients\n\nThe maximum number of licensed clients that a DLS appliance can serve.\n\nclients-per-second\n\nThe number of clients per second that the DLS appliance can serve as measured by scalability runs for each configuration. Use the number of clients per second in the table for the appropriate configuration.\n\nrenewal-interval-percentage\n\nThe percentage of the length of time for which a license is borrowed to which the renewal interval is set.\n\nWhen these measurements were taken, the renewal interval was set to 15% of the length of time in hours for which licenses were borrowed.\n\nborrow-time-in-hours\n\nThe length of time in hours for which licenses are borrowed.\n\nWhen these measurements were taken, licenses were borrowed for 12 hours.\n\nThis formula prevents the accumulation of requests on a DLS instance, ensuring smooth operation.\n\nNote:\n\nThe measurements were taken with the throughput measured in Throughput for a DLS Appliance.\n\nAll measurements were taken with a CPU clock speed of 2.6 GHz.\n\nThe measurements for a container-based DLS appliance were taken from a Docker container in an Ubuntu VM. Only the containers for the DLS appliance were running in the VM while the measurements were taken.\n\nNumber of vCPUs Total RAM (GB) Clients per Second Calculation Maximum Number of Clients 4 8 5 5⨯60⨯0.15⨯12⨯60 32,000 6 12 9 9⨯60⨯0.15⨯12⨯60 58,000 8 16 13 13⨯60⨯0.15⨯12⨯60 84,000\n\n2.4.3. Burst Load Performance for a DLS Appliance\n\nBurst load performance measures the time that a VM-based or container-based DLS appliance requires to process the requests received from a large number of clients in a short interval of time. Burst load performance does not measure concurrency or throughput.\n\nNote:\n\nBurst processing times are illustrative only because they are for retry logic in performance tests that use simulated client drivers. Times may differ with real client drivers.\n\nThe test systems were configured with 4 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM.\n\nThe measurements for a container-based DLS appliance were taken from a Docker container in an Ubuntu VM. Only the containers for the DLS appliance were running in the VM while the measurements were taken.\n\nNumber of Clients Interval Processing Time 100 0-1 second 5 seconds 1,000 0-20 seconds 50 seconds 5,000 0-5 minutes 5 minutes 10,000 0-10 minutes 8 minutes and 42 seconds\n\n2.5. Installing a VM-Based DLS Virtual Appliance\n\nTo simplify the installation process, a VM-based DLS virtual appliance is supplied as a virtual appliance image to be installed on a supported hypervisor.\n\nAfter verifying the requirements in Platform Requirements for a DLS Virtual Appliance or Containerized DLS Software Image and reviewing the guidelines in Sizing Guidelines for a DLS Appliance, install and configure the DLS virtual appliance by following this sequence of instructions:\n\nInstalling the DLS Virtual Appliance Image on a Supported Hypervisor\n\nIf necessary: Setting the IP Address of a DLS Virtual Appliance from the Hypervisor\n\nRegistering the DLS Administrator User\n\nOptional: Creating or Expanding an HA Cluster of DLS Instances\n\nOptional: Setting the Static IP Address of a DLS Virtual Appliance\n\n2.5.1. Installing the DLS Virtual Appliance Image on a Supported Hypervisor\n\nDLS virtual appliance images are available for several hypervisors. You use standard interfaces of the hypervisor to install the DLS virtual appliance on your chosen hypervisor.\n\nThe DLS virtual appliance image for each supported hypervisor except Red Hat Enterprise Linux KVM specifies the minimum configuration for the VM as listed in Platform Requirements for a DLS Virtual Appliance or Containerized DLS Software Image. You are not required to specify the VM configuration when you install the DLS virtual appliance for these hypervisors. After installing the DLS virtual appliance, you can use standard interfaces of the hypervisor to change the configuration of the VM if necessary.\n\nNote:\n\nIf subnet conflicts occur, contact your network administrator for an appropriate subnet address and then follow these steps.\n\nModify the back-tier property of the networks element in the /etc/dls/config/docker-compose.yml file using the rsu_admin user.\n\nRestart the VM for the change to take effect.\n\n2.5.1.1.

For example, the subnet mask in CIDR format of the decimal equivalent 255.255.255.0 is 24.\n\nIn the gateway text-entry field, type the IP address of the VM's default gateway.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you leave the gateway field empty, the DLS virtual appliance uses DHCP settings.\n\nOptional: In the dns_server_one text-entry field, type the IP address of the first DNS server to be used for name resolution.\n\nOptional: In the dns_server_two text-entry field, type the IP address of the second DNS server to be used for name resolution.\n\nReview all the details of the virtual machine that you are creating and click Finish.\n\nStart the VM that you created.\n\nNote:\n\nIf subnet conflicts occur, contact your network administrator for an appropriate subnet address and then follow these steps.\n\nModify the back-tier property of the networks element in the /etc/dls/config/docker-compose.yml file using the rsu_admin user.\n\nRestart the VM for the change to take effect.\n\nAllow approximately 15 minutes after the VM is started for the installation of the DLS virtual appliance to complete and for the DLS virtual appliance to start. What to do after the DLS virtual appliance starts depends on whether the VM has been assigned an IP address automatically, for example, by a DHCP server:\n\nIf the VM has been assigned an IP address, what to do next depends on whether you are performing a new installation or are upgrading an existing DLS instance:\n\nIf you are performing a new installation, register the DLS administrator user on the appliance as explained in Registering the DLS Administrator User.\n\nIf you are upgrading an existing DLS instance, migrate the existing DLS instance as explained in Migrating a DLS Instance.\n\nOtherwise, set the IP address of the DLS virtual appliance from the hypervisor as explained in Setting the IP Address of a DLS Virtual Appliance from the Hypervisor.\n\n2.5.2. Setting the IP Address of a DLS Virtual Appliance from the Hypervisor\n\nIf the VM that hosts a DLS virtual appliance has not been assigned an IP address automatically, you must set the IP address from the hypervisor. Each DLS virtual appliance provides a shell script specifically for this purpose and is configured with a user account for running the script.\n\nNote:\n\nYou can perform this task only on a VM-based DLS virtual appliance. You cannot perform this task on a containerized DLS software image. Instead, you can use standard interfaces of the OS on which the container orchestration platform is running to make this change.\n\nNote:\n\nThe IP address of a VMware VM that hosts a DLS appliance can be set when the appliance is installed from an OVF template. If the IP address was set this way, you must follow the instructions in Changing the IP Address of a VMware VM Set During DLS Appliance Installation. If you use any other method to change this address, it reverts to its original setting when the VM is restarted.\n\nUse the hypervisor management console of the appliance to log in as the user dls_admin to the VM that hosts the DLS virtual appliance. If the dls_admin user has not been registered, you can still log in to the VM as the dls_admin user with the default password welcome.\n\nRun the /etc/adminscripts/set-static-ip-cli.sh script.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ /etc/adminscripts/set-static-ip-cli.sh\n\nWhen prompted, enter the details of the IP address. The script presents any default values that are already set for the virtual appliance's network.\n\nEnter the number that denotes the IP version that the virtual appliance's network uses.\n\nFor an IPv4 network, type 4.\n\nFor an IPv6 network, type 6.\n\nEnter the IP address that you want to assign to the DLS virtual appliance.\n\nEnter the IP address of the DLS virtual appliance's default gateway.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you omit the default gateway address, the DLS virtual appliance uses DHCP settings.\n\nEnter the IP address of the first DNS server to be used for name resolution.\n\nEnter the IP address of the second DNS server to be used for name resolution.\n\nEnter the subnet mask of the DLS virtual appliance's network in classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) format without the leading slash character (/). To get a subnet mask in CIDR format from its decimal equivalent, refer to the table on page 2 of IETF RFC 1878: Variable Length Subnet Table For IPv4. For example, the subnet mask in CIDR format of the decimal equivalent 255.255.255.0 is 24.\n\nAfter the IP address has been set, log files containing progress message from the script are available in the /tmp/static-ip-cli-logs directory.\n\nWhat to do next depends on whether you are performing a new installation or are upgrading an existing DLS instance:\n\nIf you are performing a new installation, register the DLS administrator user on the appliance as explained in Registering the DLS Administrator User.\n\nIf you are upgrading an existing DLS instance, migrate the existing DLS instance as explained in Migrating a DLS Instance.\n\n2.5.3. Changing the IP Address of a VMware VM Set During DLS Appliance Installation\n\nThe IP address of a VMware VM that hosts a DLS appliance can be set when the appliance is installed from an OVF template. If the IP address was set this way, you can change it only by editing vApps options within VM that hosts the DLS appliance. If you use any other method to change this address, it reverts to its original setting when the VM is restarted.\n\nLog in to vCenter Server by using the VMware vSphere Web Client. For detailed instructions, refer to Log in to vCenter Server by Using the vSphere Web Client.\n\nFrom the vCenter Server inventory, navigate to the VM that hosts the DLS appliance.\n\nShut down the VM to which you navigated in the previous step.\n\nOn the Configure tab, expand Settings, select vApp options, and click Edit.\n\nIn the list of vApp options, select Networkproperties.IPaddress and click Set Value.\n\nEnter the IP address that you want to assign to the VM that hosts the DLS appliance.\n\nSave your changes and start the VM.\n\n2.6. Deploying a Containerized DLS Software Image\n\nFor deployments on a supported container orchestration platform, the DLS is supplied as a containerized software image.\n\nAfter verifying the requirements in Platform Requirements for a DLS Virtual Appliance or Containerized DLS Software Image, deploy a containerized DLS software image by following this sequence of instructions:\n\nSetting Properties for a Containerized DLS Software Image\n\nDeploying the Containerized DLS Software Image on a Supported Platform\n\nRegistering the DLS Administrator User\n\nOptional: Creating or Expanding an HA Cluster of DLS Instances\n\n2.6.1. Contents of the Containerized DLS Software Image Download\n\nThe containerized DLS software image is distributed as the ZIP archive nls-3.3.1-bios.zip.\n\nThis ZIP archive contains the following artifacts:\n\ndls_appliance_3.3.1.tar.gz\n\nThe DLS application container.\n\ndls_pgsql_3.3.1.tar.gz\n\nThe PostgreSQL database container.\n\nNote:\n\nThe version of both containers must be the same.\n\nThe DLS application container and the PostgreSQL database container share a common volume for exchanging information between them. If both containers are deployed on a multinode cluster, they must be run on the same worker node.\n\n2.6.2. Setting Properties for a Containerized DLS Software Image\n\nTo enable communications with the container within which the DLS appliance is running, you must set properties such as host names, IP addresses, and port numbers. Set these properties before deploying the containerized DLS software image on a supported platform.\n\nSet the properties for a containerized DLS software image by editing the appropriate deployment file for your container orchestration platform.\n\nContainer Orchestration Platform File Docker docker-compose.yml Kubernetes nls-si-0-deployment.yaml Podman nls-si-0-deployment/compose.yml Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nls-si-0-deployment.yaml VMware Tanzu Application Platform nls-si-0-deployment.yaml\n\n2.6.2.1. Setting Environment Variables to Specify String Properties\n\nYou can set environment variables to specify string properties for all supported container orchestration platforms.\n\nSet environment variables to specify string properties by editing the appropriate section of the deployment file for your container platform.\n\nDeployment File Section to Edit docker-compose.yml environment: nls-si-0-deployment/compose.yml environment: nls-si-0-deployment.yaml - env:\n\nThe environment variables for specifying string properties are as follows:\n\nRequired: DLS_DB_HOST\n\nThe IP address of the database container.\n\nEnsure that the IP address of the database container is a private IP address on the same subnet as the DLS appliance container. The database container must not be accessible over any public subnet.\n\nRequired: DLS_PUBLIC_IP\n\nThe IP address of the container orchestration platform. To access the NVIDIA Licensing application, the user connects to the container in which the DLS software image is deployed through this address.\n\nOptional: DLS_PRIVATE_HOSTNAME\n\nThe host name of the container in which the DLS software image is deployed.\n\nIf this environment variable is not set, the container orchestration platform sets the host name to the container ID.\n\nOptional: FQDN\n\nThe fully qualified domain name that is mapped to the IP address that is specified by the DLS_PUBLIC_IP environment variable.\n\nEnsure that this name can be resolved by licensed clients. Do not specify a name that can be resolved only by the container orchestrator.\n\nIf this environment variable is not set, a user cannot connect to the container in which the DLS software image is deployed through a fully qualified domain name.\n\n2.6.2.2. Specifying Integer Values as Environment Variables\n\nYou can specify integer values such as port numbers for Docker, Podman, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, and VMware Tanzu Application Platform as environment variables.\n\nNote:\n\nKubernetes does not accept strings for integer values. Therefore, you cannot specify integer values for Kubernetes as environment variables. Instead, you must specify integer values for Kubernetes as explained in Specifying Integer Values as Actual Values.\n\nTo specify integer values by setting environment variables, edit the appropriate section of the deployment file for your container platform.\n\nDeployment File Section to Edit docker-compose.yml environment: nls-si-0-deployment/compose.yml environment: nls-si-0-deployment.yaml - env:\n\nThe following environment variables apply to Docker, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, and VMware Tanzu Application Platform:\n\nOptional: CPU_CORE_LIMIT\n\nThe maximum number of CPU cores that can be assigned to the DLS appliance container pod.\n\nDefault: 4\n\nOptional: DLS_HA_MAX_NODES_ENV\n\nThe maximum number of instances in a cluster to which this instance is to be added.\n\nAllowed values: 2-9\n\nDefault: 2\n\nOptional: DLS_HTTP_PORT\n\nThe port on which the container in which the DLS software image is deployed listens for HTTP requests.\n\nDefault: 80\n\nOptional: DLS_HTTPS_PORT\n\nThe port on which the container in which the DLS software image is deployed listens for HTTPS requests.\n\nDefault: 443\n\nOptional: DLS_RABBITMQ_SSL_PORT\n\nThe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) port through which the nodes in and HA cluster of DLS instances communicate with each other.\n\nDefault: 5671\n\nThe following environment variables apply only to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and VMware Tanzu Application Platform:\n\nOptional: DLS_EXPOSED_HTTP_PORT\n\nThe port on which the container orchestrator listens for and forwards the request to the port that is specified by the DLS_HTTP_PORT environment variable.\n\nNot applicable to Docker or Podman.\n\nDefault: 30000\n\nOptional: DLS_EXPOSED_HTTPS_PORT\n\nThe port on which the container orchestrator listens for and forwards the request to the port that is specified by the DLS_HTTP_PORTS environment variable.\n\nNot applicable to Docker or Podman.\n\nDefault: 30001\n\nOptional: DLS_VA_SERVICE_PORT\n\nThe port in the container orchestrator to which the DLS appliance container binds.\n\nNot applicable to Docker or Podman.\n\nDefault: 8085\n\n2.6.2.3. Specifying Integer Values as Actual Values\n\nKubernetes does not accept strings for integer values. Therefore, you cannot specify integer values for Kubernetes as environment variables. Instead, you must specify integer values for Kubernetes as actual values.\n\nTo specify integer values as actual values, replace the references to environment variables with actual values in the ports: section of the nls-si-0-deployment.yaml and nls-si-0-service.yaml deployment files.\n\nIn nls-si-0-deployment.yaml, the references to environment variables in the ports: section are as follows:\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\nports: - containerPort: ${DLS_HTTP_PORT:-80} hostPort: ${DLS_EXPOSED_HTTP_PORT:-80} - containerPort: ${DLS_HTTPS_PORT:-443} hostPort: ${DLS_EXPOSED_HTTPS_PORT:-443} - containerPort: ${DLS_RABBITMQ_SSL_PORT:-5671} hostPort: ${DLS_RABBITMQ_SSL_PORT:-5671} - containerPort: 8085 hostPort: ${DLS_VA_SERVICE_PORT:-8085}\n\nIn nls-si-0-service.yaml, the references to environment variables in the ports: section are as follows:\n\nThe values with which to replace these references to environment variables are as follows:\n\nBoth files: ${DLS_HTTP_PORT:-80}\n\nThe port on which the container in which the DLS software image is deployed listens for HTTP requests.\n\nnls-si-0-deployment.yaml: ${DLS_EXPOSED_HTTP_PORT:-80}\n\nnls-si-0-service.yaml: ${DLS_EXPOSED_HTTP_PORT:-30000}\n\nThe port on which the container orchestrator listens for and forwards the request to the port that is specified by the DLS_HTTP_PORT environment variable.\n\nBoth files: ${DLS_HTTPS_PORT:-443}\n\nThe port on which the container in which the DLS software image is deployed listens for HTTPS requests.\n\nnls-si-0-deployment.yaml: ${DLS_EXPOSED_HTTPS_PORT:-443}\n\nnls-si-0-service.yaml: ${DLS_EXPOSED_HTTPS_PORT:-30001}\n\nThe port on which the container orchestrator listens for and forwards the request to the port that is specified by the DLS_HTTP_PORTS environment variable.\n\nBoth files: ${DLS_RABBITMQ_SSL_PORT:-5671}\n\nThe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) port through which the nodes in and HA cluster of DLS instances communicate with each other.\n\nBoth files: ${DLS_VA_SERVICE_PORT:-8085}\n\nThe port in the container orchestrator to which the DLS appliance container binds.\n\nThis example shows the ports: sections in the nls-si-0-deployment.yaml and nls-si-0-service.yaml deployment files in which the references to environment variables are replaced with actual values.\n\nIn nls-si-0-deployment.yaml, the ports: section is as follows:\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\nports: - containerPort: 80 hostPort: 80 - containerPort: 443 hostPort: 443 - containerPort: 5671 hostPort: 5671 - containerPort: 8085 hostPort: 8085\n\nIn nls-si-0-service.yaml, the ports: section is as follows:\n\n2.6.3. Deploying the Containerized DLS Software Image on a Supported Platform\n\nThe containerized DLS software image is distributed with default deployment files for several container orchestration platforms. You use standard interfaces of the container orchestration platform to deploy the containerized DLS software image on your chosen platform.\n\nThe default deployment file for each supported container orchestration platform specifies the resource reservations for the container that are listed in Platform Requirements for a DLS Virtual Appliance or Containerized DLS Software Image. You are not required to specify the resource reservations for the container when you deploy the containerized DLS software image. Follow the instructions for the container orchestration platform that you are using.\n\n2.6.3.1. Deploying the Containerized DLS Software Image on Docker\n\nEnsure that the required environment variables have been set as explained in Setting Properties for a Containerized DLS Software Image.\n\nImport the DLS appliance artifact and the PostgreSQL database artifact.\n\nImport the DLS appliance artifact.\n\nImport the PostgreSQL database artifact.\n\nChange to the directory that contains the docker-compose.yml file.\n\nStart the DLS appliance and PostgreSQL database containers.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ docker-compose up\n\n2.6.3.2. Deploying the Containerized DLS Software Image on Kubernetes Platforms\n\nPerform this task if you are using Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, or VMware Tanzu Application Platform.\n\nEnsure that the following prerequisites are met:\n\nThe required environment variables have been set as explained in Setting Properties for a Containerized DLS Software Image.\n\nA private repository for the DLS appliance artifact and the PostgreSQL database artifact has been created.\n\nIf a registry secret is required for pulling the artifacts from the private repository, the registry secret has been created.\n\nIn the deployment files for the DLS appliance artifact and the PostgreSQL database artifact, the name of the registry secret is preset to registry-secret. If you create a secret with this name, you don't need to edit the deployment files to reference the secret.\n\nNote:\n\nThe DLS application container and the PostgreSQL database container share a common volume for exchanging information between them. If both containers are deployed on a multinode cluster, they must be run on the same worker node.\n\nImport the DLS appliance artifact and the PostgreSQL database artifact into your private repository.\n\nEdit the deployment files for the DLS appliance artifact and the PostgreSQL database artifact to pull these artifacts from the private repository into which they were imported. In each file, replace the string <POPULATE THIS WITH PRIVATE REPOSITORY> with the name of the private repository.\n\nFor the DLS appliance artifact, edit the following line in the file nls-si-0-deployment.yaml:\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\nimage: <POPULATE THIS WITH PRIVATE REPOSITORY>:appliance\n\nFor the PostgreSQL database artifact, edit the following line in the file postgres-nls-si-0-deployment.yaml:\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\nimage: <POPULATE THIS WITH PRIVATE REPOSITORY>:pgsql\n\nIf a registry secret is required for pulling the artifacts from the private repository, edit the deployment files for the DLS appliance artifact and the PostgreSQL database artifact to reference the secret. In each file, replace the string registry-secret with the name of your registry secret.\n\nFor the DLS appliance artifact, edit the file nls-si-0-deployment.yaml.\n\nFor the PostgreSQL database artifact, edit the file postgres-nls-si-0-deployment.yaml.\n\nStart the PostgreSQL database container pod with the supplied deployment file postgres-nls-si-0-deployment.yaml.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ kubectl create -f directory/postgres-nls-si-0-deployment.yaml\n\ndirectory\n\nThe full path to the directory that contains the file postgres-nls-si-0-deployment.yaml.\n\nGet the IP address of the PostgreSQL database container pod.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ kubectl get pods -o wide\n\nSet the DLS_DB_HOST environment variable in the file nls-si-0-deployment.yaml to the IP address that you got in the previous step.\n\nNote:\n\nTo enable the DLS appliance container pod to create and modify files on the volumes mapped to it, ensure that the required file access permissions are set on these volumes.\n\nStart the DLS appliance container pod with the supplied deployment file nls-si-0-deployment.yaml.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ kubectl create -f directory/nls-si-0-deployment.yaml\n\ndirectory\n\nThe full path to the directory that contains the file nls-si-0-deployment.yaml.\n\n2.6.3.3. Deploying the Containerized DLS Software Image on Podman\n\nEnsure that the required environment variables have been set as explained in Setting Properties for a Containerized DLS Software Image.\n\nImport the DLS appliance artifact and the PostgreSQL database artifact.\n\nImport the DLS appliance artifact.\n\nImport the PostgreSQL database artifact.\n\nChange to the podman directory.\n\nOptional: Edit the postgres-nls-si-0-deployment/compose.yml file to customize the subnets with which you want to create the postgres-nls-si-0-deployment_back-tier network. By default, the postgres-nls-si-0-deployment_back-tier network is created with the following subnets:\n\nIPv4: 172.16.238.0/28\n\nIPv6: 2001:3984:3989::/64\n\nCreate the postgres-nls-si-0-deployment_back-tier network, configurations volume mapping, and postgres-data volume mapping, and deploy the PostgreSQL database container.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ podman-compose -f postgres-nls-si-0-deployment/compose.yml up -d\n\nFor information about the configurations and postgres-datavolume mappings, refer to Volume Mappings for a Containerized DLS Software Image.\n\nConfirm that the postgres-nls-si-0-deployment_back-tier network, configurations volume mapping, and postgres-data volume mapping were created and that the PostgreSQL database container was deployed.\n\nConfirm that the postgres-nls-si-0-deployment_back-tier network has been created.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n# podman network ls NETWORK ID NAME DRIVER 2f259bab93aa podman bridge 272c45824a80 postgres-nls-si-0-deployment_back-tier bridge\n\nConfirm that the properties of the postgres-nls-si-0-deployment_back-tier network, for example, its subnets, are correct.\n\nConfirm that the configurations volume mapping and postgres-data volume mapping were created.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n# podman volume ls DRIVER VOLUME NAME local configurations local postgres-data\n\nConfirm that the PostgreSQL database container was deployed.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n# podman container ls\n\nGet the IP address of the PostgreSQL database container pod.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ podman inspect postgres-nls-si-0-deployment_postgres-nls-si-0_1\n\nSet the DLS_DB_HOST environment variable in the file nls-si-0-deployment/compose.yml to the IP address that you got in the previous step.\n\nCreate the logs volume mapping and rabbitmq_data volume mapping, and deploy the DLS appliance container.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ podman-compose -f nls-si-0-deployment/compose.yml up -d\n\nFor information about the logs and rabbitmq_data volume mappings, refer to Volume Mappings for a Containerized DLS Software Image.\n\nConfirm that the logs volume mapping and rabbitmq_data volume mapping were created and that the DLS appliance container was deployed.\n\nConfirm that the logs volume mapping and rabbitmq_data volume mapping were created.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n# podman volume ls DRIVER VOLUME NAME ... local logs ... local rabbitmq_data\n\nConfirm that the DLS appliance container was deployed.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n# podman container ls\n\n2.6.4. Volume Mappings for a Containerized DLS Software Image\n\nWhen a containerized DLS software image is deployed, several volume mappings are created for maintaining the state of the NVIDIA Licensing application in the DLS appliance.\n\nThe mapping of the volumes to the container filesystem can be found in the respective deployment files depending on the Orchestrator platform that the containerized appliance is being deployed on.\n\nPlatform File Docker docker-compose.yml Kubernetes nls-si-0-deployment.yaml Podman compose.yml Openshift nls-si-0-deployment.yaml Tanzu nls-si-0-deployment.yaml\n\nThe volume mappings that are created are as follows:\n\nconfigurations\n\nContains the state of the DLS appliance container to enable its dynamic properties to be retrieved if the container fails.\n\nlogs\n\nContains log files created by the NVIDIA Licensing application in the DLS appliance.\n\npostgres-data\n\nContains NVIDIA Licensing application data created by the PostgreSQL database. Because this volume contains information about available and checked out licenses, ensure that access to this volume is limited.\n\nrabbitmq_data\n\nContains information about the real-time replication of data between nodes in an HA cluster of DLS instances.\n\nNote:\n\nThese volume mappings maintain the state of the NVIDIA Licensing application in the DLS appliance. Therefore, do not modify these volume mappings.\n\n2.6.5. Troubleshooting Issues with Deploying the Containerized DLS Software Image\n\n2.6.5.1. Containerized DLS Appliance Fails to Start on Kubernetes Platforms\n\nWhen this issue occurs, the service enters a crash loop, container creating, pending sequence before the container enters an error state.\n\nThis issue might affect Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, or VMware Tanzu Application Platform. It does not affect Docker.\n\nEnsure that the file access permissions on the volumes allow write access by the database container and the DLS appliance container, for example 707 (rwx---rwx).\n\nIf the containerized DLS software image is deployed on a multinode cluster, ensure that the database container and the DLS appliance container are running on the same worker node.\n\nIf the Kubernetes cluster does not dynamically provision persistent volumes when creating persistent volume claims, ensure that the persistent volumes are created manually with file access permissions that allow the database container and the DLS appliance container to write to them.\n\nEnsure that the versions of the database container and the DLS appliance container are identical.\n\n2.6.5.2. Volume Mode Access for DLS Appliance Resources on Kubernetes Platforms Is Incorrect\n\nThe DLS application container and the PostgreSQL database container share a common volume for exchanging information between them. If the volume mode access is incorrect, start-up of only the first container pod to be started is successful. The remaining container pod fails to start because the volume is already mounted on the first container pod to be started.\n\nThis issue might affect Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, or VMware Tanzu Application Platform. It does not affect Docker.\n\nIf both containers are deployed on a multinode cluster, ensure that the DLS application container and the PostgreSQL database container run on the same worker node.\n\nEnsure that the PostgreSQL database container pod is started before the DLS appliance container pod. For more information, refer to Deploying the Containerized DLS Software Image on Kubernetes Platforms.\n\n2.6.5.3. Data Validation Errors Prevent the DLS Appliance Container Pod from Starting on Kubernetes\n\nThis issue occurs if port numbers are specified as references to environment variables in the deployment files. Because Kubernetes does not accept string values for port numbers, you cannot specify port numbers for Kubernetes by setting environment variables.\n\nThis issue might affect Kubernetes. It does not affect other supported container orchestration platforms. When this issue occurs, the following error messages are displayed:\n\nEdit the deployment files to specify port numbers as integer values instead of references to environment variables. For instructions, refer to Specifying Integer Values as Actual Values.\n\nStart the DLS appliance container pod with the supplied deployment file nls-si-0-deployment.yaml.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ kubectl create -f directory/nls-si-0-deployment.yaml\n\ndirectory\n\nThe full path to the directory that contains the file nls-si-0-deployment.yaml.\n\n2.6.5.4. The Management Interface of the NVIDIA Licensing Application Fails to Load\n\nWhen this issue occurs, the containerized DLS appliance starts correctly but the management interface of the NVIDIA Licensing application is not loaded into the browser.\n\nEnsure that the DLS_DB_HOST environment variable set to the IP address of the database container.\n\nEnsure that the environment variables for port mappings set in the deployment files are correct and that the ports are open on the Kubernetes node.\n\nEnsure that the port specified by the DLS_EXPOSED_HTTPS_PORT environment variable is open in the firewall on the node that is hosting the DLS appliance container.\n\nIf the Kubernetes cluster does not dynamically provision persistent volumes when creating persistent volume claims, ensure that the persistent volumes are created manually with file access permissions that allow the database container and the DLS appliance container to write to them.\n\nEnsure that the versions of the database container and the DLS appliance container are identical.\n\n2.6.5.5. HA Configuration or Online Upgrade Fails\n\nHigh availability (HA) configuration or online upgrade between two containerized DLS appliances fails if port mappings or volume configurations are incorrect.\n\nEnsure that the same ports are exposed and mapped internally for both containers. The following environment variables must be the same for both containers.\n\nDLS_EXPOSED_HTTP_PORT\n\nDLS_EXPOSED_HTTPS_PORT\n\nEnsure that the DLS_RABBITMQ_SSL_PORT environment variable is set to 5671 for both containers\n\nEnsure that ports 5671, 8081 and 8084 are open on the containers within which the containerized DLS appliances are deployed.\n\nEnsure that Ports 8080 through 8085 are open on each worker node.\n\nEnsure that the sizes of the volumes rabbitmq-data, postgres-data, logs and configurations are equal to or exceed the minimum recommended storage space.\n\nVolume Minimum Recommended Storage Space rabbitmq-data 2 GiB postgres-data 10 GiB logs 500 MiB configurations 1 GiB\n\nEnsure that the file access permissions on the folders inside the rabbitmq-data volume allow write access by the containers.\n\n2.6.5.6. Windows Client Cannot Return Licenses Because the Return Endpoint Is Unavailable\n\nA licensed Windows client returns a license by sending an HTTP request to the DLS instance on port 80. If the container orchestrator within which a containerized DLS appliance is deployed cannot receive requests on this port, the client cannot return a license.\n\nHow to resolve this issue depends on whether you can control the port on which the container orchestrator listens for HTTP requests.\n\nIf you can control the port on which the container orchestrator listens for HTTP requests from licensed clients, ensure that the DLS_EXPOSED_HTTP_PORT environment variable is set to 80.\n\nOtherwise, use a load balancer to do path based routing of all license return requests to the URL https://dls-ip-address:dls-exposed-https-port/leasing/v1/lessor/shutdown\n\ndls-ip-address\n\nThe IP address that is specified in the DLS_PUBLIC_IP environment variable.\n\ndls-exposed-https-port\n\nThe port number that is specified in the DLS_EXPOSED_HTTPS_PORT environment variable.\n\nFor more information about these environment variables, refer to Setting Properties for a Containerized DLS Software Image.\n\n2.6.5.7. Client Cannot Obtain License if Client Configuration Token Specifies the Domain Name\n\nA configuration error for a containerized DLS instance can prevent a licensed client from obtaining a license if the client configuration token specifies a fully qualified domain name. However, this error does not prevent a client from obtaining a license if the client configuration token specifies an IP address.\n\nSet the FQDN environment variable to the fully qualified domain name that is mapped to the IP address of the container in which the DLS software image is deployed.\n\nEnsure that this name can be resolved by licensed clients. Do not specify a name that can be resolved only by the container orchestrator.\n\nRestart the container in which the DLS appliance is deployed.\n\n2.6.5.8. Node Health Information Is Missing from the Service Instance Page\n\nInsufficient storage for a containerized DLS instance can prevent node health information from being displayed on the Service Instance page of the management interface of the NVIDIA Licensing application.\n\nForce reload the Service Instance page in the browser.\n\nIf the node health information is still missing after the page is reloaded, check the amount of storage space available in the volumes created for the DLS appliance container. For more information about these volumes, refer to Volume Mappings for a Containerized DLS Software Image.\n\nIf any volumes are full, resize the volumes and restart the container in which the DLS appliance is deployed.\n\n2.6.5.9. The podman-compose Command Fails with Missing Networks Error\n\nIn some deployments, the podman-compose up command might fail with the error RuntimeError: missing networks: back-tier.\n\nThis failure is caused by a known issue with Podman Compose 1.0.3 and earlier versions.\n\nEnsure that you are using one of the supported versions of Podman Compose listed in NVIDIA License System Release Notes. If necessary, install the latest version of Podman from GitHub.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n# pip3 install https://github.com/containers/podman-compose/archive/devel.tar.gz\n\n2.6.5.10. Re-deploying a Containerized DLS Software Image on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Fails\n\nRe-deploying a containerized DLS software image on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform might fail because permission issues prevent a new PostgreSQL database container from being deployed. This issue can cause an in-place upgrade to fail because an in-place upgrade requires the containerized DLS software image to be re-deployed.\n\nWhen this issue occurs, the following error messages are displayed:\n\nChange to the directory where the configuration volume is mounted.\n\nChange to the /etc/dls/config/ directory.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ cd /etc/dls/config/\n\nForcibly remove the directories for which permission is denied and their contents.\n\nTry again to deploy the containerized DLS software image on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. For detailed instructions, refer to Deploying the Containerized DLS Software Image on Kubernetes Platforms.\n\n2.7. Installing the DLS Software Image on Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS\n\nFor installation on a supported operating system, the Delegated License Server (DLS) component of the NVIDIA License System is supplied as an installable package. The package includes the containerization software and container images that are required to run the NVIDIA Licensing application on the operating system. The operating system can be running in a virtualized server environment on your choice of hypervisor or on a bare-metal server.\n\nEnsure that the server on which you are installing the DLS software image has at least 15 GB of free disk space.\n\nThe DLS software image ZIP archive for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS contains the following artifacts:\n\nDocker container orchestrator RPM packages\n\nAppliance container images\n\nDatabase container image\n\nApplication container image\n\nInstallation script with the helper scripts\n\nREADME file\n\nVERSION file\n\nExtract the contents of the ZIP archive to a local folder.\n\nUpdate the file access permissions of the installApplicance.sh file to allow execute permission.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ chmod +x installAppliance.sh\n\nRun the installApplicance.sh installation script.\n\nWhen the installation is complete, confirm that messages on the console indicate that the NVIDIA Licensing application has started.\n\n2.8. Configuring User Accounts on a DLS Virtual Appliance\n\nEach DLS software image is configured with a single standard user account for accessing the DLS appliance and an account with sudo user privileges for installing updates to the DLS appliance software. Modifications to these accounts are strictly controlled. You cannot add other user accounts to the software image. However, you can use a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) directory instead of the configured accounts for managing user access to a DLS appliance.\n\nUser Account Purpose dls_admin DLS administrator account. This account provides access through a web-based management interface to the NVIDIA Licensing application on a DLS virtual appliance. The DLS administrator user name can be changed from the preset dls_admin name. rsu_admin DLS sudo user account. This user account has the elevated privileges required to install updates to the DLS appliance software that NVIDIA releases periodically. To comply with the terms of the GPL/LGPL v3 license under which the GPL/LGPL v3 licensed Open Source Software (OSS) libraries within the DLS virtual appliance are released, this account also has the elevated privileges required to update and upgrade these libraries.\n\nNote:\n\nThis account is not available for containerized DLS software images.\n\n2.8.1. Registering the DLS Administrator User\n\nEach DLS virtual appliance is configured with a user account specifically for administering the DLS. This account provides access through a web-based management interface to the NVIDIA Licensing application on the appliance. Before administering a DLS virtual appliance, you must register this user to be able to access this management interface.\n\nIf you intend to configure a cluster of DLS instances, you need perform this task only for the DLS instance from which you will configure the cluster. The registration of the DLS administrator user is propagated from this instance to the other instance when you configure the cluster.\n\nOpen a web browser and connect to the URL https://dls-vm-ip-address.\n\ndls-vm-ip-address\n\nThe IP address or, if defined, the fully qualified domain name or the CNAME of the VM on which the DLS virtual appliance is installed.\n\nYou can get the IP address from the management console of your hypervisor.\n\nOn the Set Up page that opens, click NEW INSTALLATION.\n\nOn the Register User page that opens, provide the credentials for the DLS administrator user.\n\nNote:\n\nIf the DLS administrator user has already been registered, the login page opens instead of the Register User page.\n\nOptional: If you want to change the user name from the preset name dls_admin, replace the text in the Username field with your choice of user name.\n\nProvide a password for the DLS administrator user and confirm the password. The password must be at least eight characters long and is case sensitive.\n\nNote:\n\nYou can change the DLS administrator user name and password at any time after the DLS administrator user is registered. For instructions, refer to Changing the DLS Administrator User Name and Password.\n\nDetermine whether you want to enable an additional user that will be able to access the log files for the DLS virtual appliance.\n\nIf you want to enable this additional user, ensure that the Create a diagnostic user option remains selected.\n\nOtherwise, deselect the Create a diagnostic user option.\n\nClick REGISTER. The Register User page is refreshed to confirm that the user has been registered and displays a local reset secret to enable you to reset the user's password.\n\nCopy the local reset secret and store it securely, for example, by clicking the clipboard icon and pasting the local reset secret into a plain text file that is readable only by you. You will need this key to reset the DLS administrator user's password.\n\nClick CONTINUE TO LOGIN.\n\nOn the login page that opens, type the user name of the DLS administrator user, provide the password that you set for this user, and click LOGIN.\n\nIf you want to use the virtual appliance for a single DLS instance, what to do next depends on whether you intend to use a static IP address for the virtual appliance that is hosting the DLS instance.\n\nIf you want to use the virtual appliance in an HA cluster of DLS instances, configure the cluster as explained in Configuring an HA Cluster of DLS Instances.\n\nIf you want to use a static IP address for the virtual appliance that is hosting the DLS instance, set the address as explained in Setting the Static IP Address of a DLS Virtual Appliance.\n\nOtherwise, configure the DLS instance as explained in Configuring a Service Instance.\n\nIf you need to reset the DLS administrator user's password, follow the Forgot Password? link on the login page and, when prompted, type the local reset secret, provide a new password for this user, and confirm the new password.\n\n2.8.2. Retrieving the DLS Administrator User's Reset Secret\n\nIf you need to reset the DLS administrator user's password but do not have the local reset secret, you can download a reset secret from the NVIDIA Licensing Portal.\n\nIf you are not already logged in, log in to the NVIDIA Enterprise Application Hub and click NVIDIA LICENSING PORTAL to go to the NVIDIA Licensing Portal.\n\nIn the left navigation pane, click SERVICE INSTANCES.\n\nIn the list of service instances on the Service Instance page that opens, from the Actions menu for the DLS instance, choose Download Reset Secret. (Note that the menu is too narrow, so the text is truncated.)\n\nWhen prompted, click DOWNLOAD. A file named dls_local_reset_secret_mm-dd-yyyy-hh-mm-ss.tok is saved to your default downloads folder.\n\nWhen resetting the DLS administrator user's password, upload the reset secret to the DLS instance.\n\n2.8.3. Changing the DLS Administrator User Name and Password\n\nIf you choose not to change the DLS administrator user name when registering the DLS administrator user, you can change it at any time after the DLS administrator user is registered. You can also change the password for the DLS administrator user.\n\nOpen a web browser and connect to the URL https://dls-vm-ip-address.\n\ndls-vm-ip-address\n\nThe IP address or, if defined, the fully qualified domain name or the CNAME of the VM on which the DLS virtual appliance is installed.\n\nYou can get the IP address from the management console of your hypervisor.\n\nAt the top right of the Dashboard page in the NVIDIA Licensing application on the DLS appliance that opens, click View settings.\n\nIn the My Info window that opens, click Change username/password.\n\nIn the Change Username/Password window that opens, make the changes that you want and click CHANGE USERNAME/PASSWORD.\n\nIf you want to change the user name, replace the text in the Username field with your choice of user name.\n\nIn the Current password text-entry field, type the current password for the DLS administrator user.\n\nIn the New password text-entry field, type the password that you want for the DLS administrator user. If you do not want to change the password, type the current password for the DLS administrator user. You cannot leave this field empty.\n\nIn the Confirm new password text-entry field, type the password that you typed in the New password text-entry field.\n\n2.8.4. Creating the DLS sudo User Account\n\nThe predefined DLS sudo user account rsu_admin has the elevated privileges required to install updates to the DLS appliance software that NVIDIA releases periodically. To comply with the terms of the GPL/LGPL v3 license under which the GPL/LGPL v3 licensed Open Source Software (OSS) libraries within the DLS virtual appliance are released, this account also has the elevated privileges required to update and upgrade these libraries.\n\nPerform this task for each DLS virtual appliance for which you want to create the DLS sudo user account. If the DLS virtual appliance is hosting a node in an HA cluster, the creation of the user is not automatically propagated to the other node in the cluster.\n\nNote:\n\nYou can perform this task only on a VM-based DLS virtual appliance. You cannot perform this task on a containerized DLS software image. Instead, you can use standard interfaces of the OS on which the container orchestration platform is running to make this change.\n\nFrom the hypervisor, log in as the user dls_admin to the VM that hosts the DLS virtual appliance.\n\nRun the /etc/adminscripts/enable_sudo.sh script.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n$ /etc/adminscripts/enable_sudo.sh\n\nWhen prompted, provide a password for the rsu_admin user.\n\nThe sudo user with elevated privileges rsu_admin is created.\n\n2.8.5. Integrating a DLS Instance with an LDAP Server\n\nYou can use a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) directory instead of the configured accounts for managing user access to a DLS appliance. When integrated with an LDAP server, the DLS appliance uses Windows Challenge/Response, formerly NT (New Technology) LAN Manager, (NTLM) for authenticating users.\n\nThe dls_diagnostics and dls_system users have been replaced with the default user, which is the dls_admin user. For the initial installation of DLS and prior to registration on the UI, the default password for the dls_admin user is welcome. Once registration on the portal is done, the same password and username can be used to login to the VM Appliance from the hypervisor console.\n\nWhen a user updates the username of the DLS Admin user from UI portal on the browser, the username of the underlying provisioned user on the VM appliance also gets updated. This same behavior also applies for password updates.\n\nThe dls_admin user has the same capabilities as that of dls_system and dls_diagnostics. In other words, all are able to configure appliance network properties, enable the sudo user, configure disk expansion, view log files, configuration files, etc.\n\nThe rsu_admin user role would be used for an in-place upgrade, applying security patches, and the execution of NVIDIA-provided scripts. This is true unless it is used for OS-based package updates; in that case, there is no concern for DLS support.\n\nIf you want to enable secure LDAP (LDAPS), ensure that the following prerequisites are met:\n\nYou have obtained the required certificate file in the correct format.\n\nFor a TLS certificate, the authentication certificate is the Root CA certificate in Base-64 encoded X.509 (.cer) format.\n\nThe certificate file has the correct name.\n\nCertificate File File Name\n\nTLS certificate\n\n(The Root CA Server Certificate in Base-64 encoded X.509 format)\n\nA certificate with an extension .cer\n\nFor more information about LDAP, see Basic LDAP Concepts.\n\nLog in to the DLS virtual appliance that you are integrating with an LDAP directory.\n\nIn the left navigation pane, click SETTINGS. The configuration for integration can be done from the Service Instance Settings page page that opens.\n\nWhen configuring LDAP integration, in the case of a DLS VM Appliance, users have to provide Additional Details to be able to integrate LDAP with the operating system, so that LDAP users can login to the VM Appliance using SSH or the hypervisor console. For more settings related to integrating LDAP with operating system, users can login to the DLS appliance VM from the hypervisor console using the dls_admin user, then edit the file:\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n/etc/ldap.conf\n\nThe logged-in user will have the same permissions as the dls_admin user on the VM appliance.\n\nOptional: If you want to enable LDAPS, on the Service Instance Settings page page, click Use secure LDAP (LDAPS)? to test the LDAPS connection.\n\nIf LDAP users want to enable the sudo user rsu_admin, they must execute the admin script:\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n/etc/adminscripts/enable_sudo.sh\n\nNote:\n\nNote that this script will not enable the rsu_admin user, but it will give sudo permissions to the currently logged-in LDAP user for a limited time of 1 hour. This will only occur if LDAP integrations have been enabled for the DLS Appliance.\n\nIf there is no LDAP integration configured for the DLS appliance, you can create a rsu_admin user account with sudo permissions by executing the following script:\n\nCopy\n\nCopied!\n\n/etc/adminscripts/enable_sudo.sh\n\n2.8.6. Logging in to a DLS Virtual Appliance\n\nEach DLS virtual appliance is configured with a user account specifically for administering the DLS. This account provides access through a web-based management interface to the NVIDIA Licensing application on the appliance.\n\nEnsure that the DLS administrator user has been registered for the appliance as explained in Registering the DLS Administrator User.\n\nOpen a web browser and connect to the URL https://dls-vm-ip-address.\n\ndls-vm-ip-address\n\nThe IP address or, if defined, the fully qualified domain name or the CNAME of the VM on which the DLS virtual appliance is installed.\n\nYou can get the IP address from the management console of your hypervisor.\n\nOn the login page that opens, provide the user credentials for the DLS administrator user on the DLS virtual appliance and click LOGIN.\n\nIf LDAP is used as an alternative to the fixed set of user accounts for user management, you can use the rsu_admin account to administer the DLS virtual appliance instead. See Integrating a DLS Instance with an LDAP Server for more information.\n\n2.8.7. Gathering Log Files for Analysis and Troubleshooting\n\nTo collect the log files of a DLS Virtual Appliance to troubleshoot a problem, use the dls_admin user and run the sudo /etc/adminscripts/collect_dls_logs.sh command.\n\nThe collect_dls_logs.sh script collects the following information for analysis:\n\nCritical information:\n\nCPU information from /proc/cpuinfo\n\nRAM information from /proc/meminfo\n\nDLS startup log file /var/log/applicationStartup.log\n\nDLS VM appliance log file /var/log/applianceOps.log\n\nIP address information log file /var/log/ip_address.log\n\nDisk consumption (directories with more than 100 MB usage and database disk consumption) and free space\n\nDocker logs for both containers\n\nNon-critical logs:\n\nChrony, timesyncd, and timedatectl output\n\nSyslog information\n\nAudit log files\n\nService log files:\n\nLog files for the DLS services\n\n2.9. Configuring an HA Cluster of DLS Instances\n\nTo provide licensed clients with continued access to licenses if a DLS instance fails, you can configure a highly available (HA) cluster of two or more DLS instances in a failover configuration. A failover configuration consists of a primary instance, which is actively serving licenses to licensed clients, and one or more secondary instances, which act as a backup for the primary instance.\n\nIf you are configuring an HA cluster of containerized DLS instan"
