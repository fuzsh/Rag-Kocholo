Increase your security posture and reduce threats with a self-healing security configuration baseline that exceeds the requirements of the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nSecurity Standards and Certifications\n\nOur SecDL process is based on multiple security standards and validation programs. It complies with the strictest international standards, including the SP800-53 guidelines, to assure governments worldwide that Nutanix products perform as expected and work with their existing technology.\n\nPlatform\n\nNutanix uses a unique Security Development Lifecycle (SecDL) to incorporate security into every step of the software development process, from design and development to testing and hardening. The Nutanix solution is certified across a broad set of evaluation programs for government, financial services and healthcare to ensure compliance.\n\nSecurity Development Lifecycle\n\nSecDL Integration\n\nSecurity is incorporated into every step of the product development lifecycle and covers the entire hyperconverged infrastructure stack, including storage, virtualization, and management.\n\nFully Automated Testing\n\nSecDL testing is fully automated during development and all security-related code modifications are timed during minor releases to minimize risk.\n\nThreat Modeling\n\nThreat modeling is used to assess and mitigate customer risk from code changes.\n\nSystem Level Security\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication\n\nIf implemented, logins require a combination of a client certificate and username/password. Administrators can use local accounts built into the Nutanix UI, or use Active Directory.\n\nNative Network Microsegmentation\n\nNutanix Flow provides native VM microsegmentation and application visibility. Easily visualize and secure applications to increase security posture and prevent the spread of network threats.\n\nData at Rest Encryption (Hardware)\n\nNutanix encrypts user and application data to a level of FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliance through factory-installed self-encrypting drives (SED), and meets HIPAA, PCI DSS and SOX standards.\n\nData at Rest Encryption (Software)\n\nNutanix encrypts user and application data to a level of FIPS 140-2 Level 1 compliance through the use of standard drives and software based encyrption, and meets HIPAA, PCI DSS and SOX standards.\n\nPower Failure Safeguards\n\nIn the event of a power cycle or host reboot, Nutanix software retrieves the keys from the key management server and uses them to unlock the drives.\n\nKey Administration\n\nInstantly reprogram security keys to meet site-specific policies, or use Crypto Erase to instantly erase all data on the drive while generating a new symmetric encryption key.\n\nIndustry Compatibility\n\nRather than storing keys on the nodes themselves, Nutanix software interfaces with third-party key management servers using the industry-standard Key Management Interface Protocol (KMIP).\n\nCluster Lockdown\n\nAdministrators can restrict access to a Nutanix cluster in security-conscious environments, disabling interactive shell logins automatically and leveraging non-repudiated SSH keys.\n\nAutomation\n\nPowerful automation and self-healing security models help maintain continuous security in enterprise cloud environments with efficiency and ease. Nutanix developed our own Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) to speed up the accreditation process for the Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) and the Department of Defense Information Assurance Risk Management Framework (DIARMF).\n\nFast Baseline Checks and Validation\n\nThe Nutanix STIGs are written in XCCDF format and support the SCAP standard for compatibility with automated assessment tools like HBSS, cutting down accreditation time.\n\nAutomatic Configuration Management\n\nSecurity configuration management automation (SCMA) efficiently checks over 800 security entities in the Nutanix STIGs that cover both storage and built-in virtualization.\n\nSelf-Healing\n\nNutanix leverages SaltStack and SCMA to self-heal any deviation from the security baseline configuration of the OS and hypervisor to remain in compliance.\n\nStorage Services:\n\nEnterprise Storage Capabilities\n\nScalable, resilient andÂ highÂ performanceÂ storage\n\nEnterprise data storage as an on-demand service\n\nThe Nutanix Enterprise Cloud Platform eliminates the need for traditional SAN and NAS solutions by employing a highly distributed software architecture. It delivers a rich set of software-defined services that are entirely VM-centric, including snapshots, high availability, disaster recovery, deduplication and more.\n\nPerformance Acceleration\n\nNutanix web-scale solutions employ a variety of advanced mechanisms to drive the highest possible performance for a wide range of virtualized workloads. Powerful acceleration capabilities such as caching, automatic data tiering and data locality speed storage performance. Server-attached flash storage is used both as a high-performance read cache, as well as a persistent data tier in a Nutanix hyperconverged system.\n\nIntelligent Distributed Data Tiering\n\nAutomatic Optimization\n\nApplication and user data is automatically placed in the optimal storage tier â flash or HDD â to yield the fastest performance and optimize capacity in the cluster.\n\nHot Data\n\nThe most frequently accessed data (âhotâ data) is placed in the SSD or cache tier for near instantaneous access by VMs.\n\nCold Data\n\nAs data becomes âcold,ââit is demoted into the higher capacity HDD tier for more efficient storage, so that SSD and cache capacity remains available for new âhotâ data.\n\nData Placement Management\n\nMapReduce technology manages data placement as a distributed, background process to ensure negligible impact to real-time performance.\n\nHeterogeneous Cluster\n\nSupport for heterogeneous cluster that includes Hybrid, all flash, and compute heavy nodes.\n\nData Localization\n\nLocalized Write I/O\n\nData stays proximate to the VM and allows write I/O operations to be localized on that same node.\n\nContinuous Analysis\n\nEach Nutanix Controller VM (CVM) continually analyzes whether I/O requests are satisfied by storage resources local on that node, or from another node in the cluster.\n\nTransparent Migration\n\nIf a VM migrates to another host for load balancing in an active migration scenario, hot data automatically follows the VM to maintain the highest performance.\n\nIntelligent Migration\n\nAfter a certain number of read requests made by a VM to a controller that resides on another node, Nutanix data localization moves the remote data to the local controller.\n\nData Localization Management\n\nData localization is managed as a MapReduce job to take full advantage of all cluster resources and not impact system performance.\n\nDatapath Optimization\n\nAHV Turbo\n\nNew optimized datapath for AHV IO. No VM reconfiguration required (single SCSI adapter).\n\nRange of I/O Sizes\n\nEnd-to-end support for I/O sizes from 512 bytes up to 1 MB ensures optimal performance across a wide range of workloads and delivers application-tuned metadata efficiency.\n\nVariable Lengths\n\nUnlike traditional storage systems that break up incoming I/O requests into fixed 4KB chunks, Nutanix efficiently handles block sizes of variable length across the entire write path.\n\nNext Generation Platform Support\n\nRDMA Support\n\nSupport of RDMA in node to node replication paths. Optimized CVM-CVM communications to benefit all NDFS storage operations.\n\nNVMe Support\n\nSupport for low latency and high performance NVMe SSD drives.\n\nAHV vGPUs\n\nEnable better desktop experience for VDI by supporting nVidia vGPUs: Tesla M10 & M60.\n\nResiliency\n\nThe Nutanix platform is fault resistant, with no single point of failure and no bottlenecks. A shared-nothing architecture â where all data, metadata and services are distributed to all nodes within the cluster â is built to detect, isolate and recover from failures anywhere in the system for an always-on operation.\n\nAvailability Domains\n\nIntelligent Data Placement\n\nIntelligent data placement across different physical domains (e.g., separate racks or power sources) protects against appliance and rack failures.\n\nRobust Protection\n\nAvailability domains allow Nutanix clusters to survive the failure of multiple servers in a physical enclosure without loss to data or service, providing greater system-level resilience without increasing storage capacity.\n\n100% Software-defined Flexibility\n\nAdministrators can configure and manage availability domains at the storage container level in clusters with five or more nodes.\n\nTunable Redundancy\n\nUser-defined Resilience\n\nAdministrators can configure data redundancy based on application SLAs and the criticality of the data set, with a replication factor (RF) of two or three.\n\nAutomatic Data Reconstruction\n\nIf a node fails, data is automatically read from other nodes. If the node does not come back online, all data on the affected node is automatically reconstructed to ensure full redundancy and data protection.\n\nSynchronous Replication\n\nData is written to a VMâs local node and is synchronously replicated to one or more other nodes in the cluster, ensuring that all data exists in at least two independent locations and remains highly available.\n\nDatapath Redundancy\n\nHigh Availability During Controller VM Unavailability\n\nMultiple copies of data ensure 100% data availability in the event that a Nutanix Controller VM is unavailable due to failure or maintenance.\n\nTransparent Failover\n\nIf the Nutanix Controller VM becomes unavailable, Nutanix auto-pathing automatically re-routes requests to a healthy Controller VM running on another node in the cluster.\n\nFault-tolerant Architecture\n\nEvery node in a Nutanix cluster has access to all replicas so that I/O requests can be serviced immediately by any node, providing N-way, fully fault-tolerant failover for all VMs in the cluster.\n\nData Integrity Checks\n\nDetection and Repair of Silent Data Corruption\n\nThe system scans data in the background and checks against checksums in the metadata store. If it detects an error, it will overwrite the bad data with the good copy.\n\nAutomatic Integrity Checks\n\nOn every read, a checksum is computed for the data being read and compared with the stored checksum. In the case of an inconsistency, the error is corrected.\n\nAutomatic Isolation and Recovery\n\nIf a drive fails, the system automatically runs a scan and replicates any data that is not redundant. During the failure and recovery process, both data and access to data are preserved.\n\nDeduplication\n\nPerformance Tier Deduplication\n\nRemoves duplicate data in the content cache (SSD and memory) to reduce the footprint of an applicationâs working set, enabling more working data to be managed in the content cache for better performance.\n\nCapacity Tier Deduplication\n\nGlobal, post-process MapReduce deduplication reduces repetitive data in the capacity tier to increase the effective storage capacity of a cluster.\n\nSimplified Management\n\nEasily configured and managed at vdisk granularity for fine-grained control.\n\nCompression\n\nIncrease Capacity by up to 4x\n\nData compression can be enabled as an inline capability as data is written to the system, or post-process as a series of MapReduce jobs after the data has been written, eliminating any impact on write path performance.\n\nLeverage All Resources\n\nUnlike traditional architectures where compression operations run on one or two CPUs, Nutanix compression runs on each node in the cluster to leverage all system compute and memory resources.\n\nCompress a Variety of Data Types\n\nNutanix uses the Snappy compression algorithm to compress a variety of data types more efficiently, and includes the option to compress data at the sub-block level for greater simplicity.\n\nErasure Coding with Nutanix EC-X\n\nResilience with Capacity Efficiency\n\nA mathematical function is applied around a data set to calculate parity blocks, which can then be used to recover data in the event of a failure.\n\nOptimized Performance\n\nNutanix systems switch between data replication for hot data and erasure coding for cold data based on I/O frequency to optimize performance and storage.\n\nNutanix EC-X\n\nThis patent-pending algorithm distributes coding and rebuilds across the entire cluster to reduce vulnerability windows in the event of failures, and maintains data locality.\n\nClones\n\nImprove performance with distributed caching of VM data for linked clones, redirect-on-write snapshots and writeable clones at the granularity of a single VM.\n\nSnapshots & Clones\n\nNear Zero Performance Impact\n\nRedirect-on-write snapshots and writeable clones at the VM level increase efficiency, while differential forever snapshots impose lower capacity overheads on the system.\n\nFine-grained Data Management\n\nUnlike systems that snapshot data at a volume or LUN level, Nutanix snapshots and clones are performed for individual VMs for fine-grained data management and protection.\n\nEasy Clone Creation\n\nCreate clones (writeable snapshots) of a base image in seconds, leveraging integration with popular offload capabilities, including the VMware API for Array Integration (VAAI), Microsoft Offloaded Data Transfer (ODX) and SMI-s.\n\nShadow Clones\n\nUnique Nutanix Feature\n\nShadow Clones are a unique Nutanix feature that significantly improves performance by caching virtual machine data across a Nutanix cluster.\n\nIdeal for Multi-reader Scenarios\n\nGain performance where there are multiple VMs reading a single source of data, or in VDI deployments with linked clones (e.g., Citrix MCS Master VM or VMware View replica disks).\n\nvDisk Access Trend Monitoring\n\nIf read I/O requests originate from more than two remote Controller VMs (CVMs) and the local CVM, the vDisk is marked as immutable and cached locally, so read operations are satisfied by direct-attached storage resources.\n\nVM Storage\n\nEfficient, high-performance, and enterprise-grade VM storage\n\nWhat is VM Storage?\n\nAcropolis provides enterprise-grade VM-centric storage for virtualized applications. Unlike traditional storage solutions that were built in a pre-virtualization era, operations in Acropolis are optimized to work at a granularity of a single VM or vDisk. Additionally, complex storage operations such as LUN provisioning, zoning and masking are non-existent in Acropolis enabling deployment of highly available storage with just a few clicks.\n\nHigh Performance for all Workloads\n\nChoice and Flexibility Support for a wide range of hypervisors including Nutanix AHV, VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V with native hybrid-cloud connectivity to AWS and Microsoft Azure.\n\nDeploy VM-centric Storage in Seconds\n\nNo more storage complexity, no more LUN provisioning. Give the VM datastore a name, set data redundancy levels, enable capacity optimization policies and you are done.\n\nHigh Performance for all Workloads\n\nChoice and Flexibility Support for a wide range of hypervisors including Nutanix AHV, VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V with native hybrid-cloud connectivity to AWS and Microsoft Azure.\n\nChoice and Flexibility\n\nSupport for a wide range of hypervisors including Nutanix AHV, VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V with native hybrid-cloud connectivity to AWS and Microsoft Azure.\n\nData Localization\n\nLocalized Write I/O\n\nData stays proximate to the VM and allows write I/O operations to be localized on that same node.\n\nContinuous Analysis\n\nEach Nutanix Controller VM (CVM) continually analyzes whether I/O requests are satisfied by storage resources local on that node, or from another node in the cluster.\n\nTransparent Migration\n\nIf a VM migrates to another host for load balancing in an active migration scenario, hot data automatically follows the VM to maintain the highest performance.\n\nIntelligent Migration\n\nAfter a certain number of read requests made by a VM to a controller that resides on another node, Nutanix data localization moves the remote data to the local controller.\n\nData Localization Management\n\nData localization is managed as a MapReduce job to take full advantage of all cluster resources and not impact system performance.\n\nShadow Clones\n\nNutanix Shadow Clones are a unique feature of the Nutanix Virtual Computing Platform that allows for consistent performance at scale of large VDI and Multi-reader scenarios with VMs sitting on different hosts.\n\nAcropolis File Services\n\nSimple, scalable and reliable file storage for your enterprise cloud\n\nWhat is AFS\n\nAcropolis File Services (AFS) is a software-defined scale-out file storage solution for unstructured file data.Â Â It provides a highly available and massively scalable data repository for a wide range ofÂ Â deployments and applications. AFS is natively integrated into the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS, and it precludes the need for a separate NAS appliance by providing a consolidated solution with unified management for VM and file services.\n\nEliminate Complexity\n\nVM and file storage are on the same cluster, eliminating the complexity of deploying and managing a separate infrastructure stack for standalone NAS solutions.\n\nScale on Demand\n\nAFS is a 100% software-based service that can be deployed in minutes and scaled on demand with a single click.\n\nEasily Grow Capacity\n\nStorage can be scaled independently of compute. A storage heavy or storage only Nutanix node can be added to the cluster, and additional file server VMs can be deployed instantaneously.\n\nEnsure Availability\n\nAFS makes sure data is available during software upgrades, hardware upgrades and unexpected failures with no bottlenecks or isolated points of failure.\n\nProtect and Recover Files\n\nNative snapshots and self-service recovery make recovery of files extremely easy.\n\nLeverage Flexible Deployment Options\n\nAFS can be deployed on stand-alone clusters purely meant for file serving or integrated where virtual machines and data live in the same cluster.\n\nScale up or Scale out on demand easily and invisibly\n\nAFS allows you to easily scale from 100s of users to 10s of thousands of users enabling you to store billions of files and PBs of data.\n\nTurnkey Consolidation\n\nCan be deployed standalone for centralized management of file data or on an existing Nutanix cluster for better cluster utilization.\n\nSingle Namespace\n\nA single namespace is exported from the AFS cluster, no matter how large the cluster is.\n\nScale and Performance\n\nBuilt to handle billions of files by design, and tens of thousands of user sessions. As the environment grows, the cluster can be scaled up or scaled out.\n\nEnterprise Storage\n\nFeatures Includes intelligent tiering, deduplication, erasure coding, and compression from DSF.\n\nContainer Storage\n\nEnterprise class, persistent storage for containers\n\nWhat is Container Storage?\n\nNutanix Container Storage Services delivers enterprise features such as resiliency, availability, disaster recovery, and capacity optimization for both Docker and Kubernetes leveraging Acropolis Block Storage Services (ABS).\n\nPersistent, Resilient Storage\n\nPersistent container volumes provide resilient storage for containerized stateful applications such as databases and web caches.\n\nContainer Plus Virtualized Applications\n\nA common platform that supports both virtualized and containerized environments allows DevOps to pick the best technology for their needs without creating infrastructure silos.\n\nAcropolis DSF Benefits\n\nPersistent container volumes are backed by iSCSI block storage on the Acropolis Distributed Storage Fabric (DSF) with all the benefits of deduplication, compression, tiering and erasure coding.\n\nNutanix Kubernetes External Provisioner\n\nNutanix provides a Kubernetes External Storage Provisioner that leverages Nutanix ABS (Acropolis Block Service) to dynamically provision, create, delete container volumes for stateful workloads.\n\nBridging the worlds of physical and virtual\n\nABS eliminates infrastructure silos by delivering the same simplicity Nutanix offers for virtualized workloads and file storage for physical workloads. In so doing, ABS bridges the physical and virtual worlds, consolidating infrastructure into a single unified platform.\n\nAcropolis Block Services\n\nA native scale-out block storage solution\n\nAcropolis Block Services (ABS) is a native scale-out block storage solution that provides direct block-level access via the iSCSI protocol to the Acropolis Distributed Storage Fabric (ADSF). It enables enterprise applications running on external servers to leverage the benefits of the hyperconverged Nutanix architecture.\n\nProtect Existing Investments\n\nConnect storage with database environments such as Oracle, SQL Server and SAP that are deployed on specialized physical servers for price/performance or on bare-metal x86 to minimize software licensing costs.\n\nLower Costs\n\nEliminate the need for traditional Fibre Channel SANs and other specialized products that drive costs higher and require specialized IT administrators to maintain.\n\nDeliver Performance\n\nIdeal for non-virtualized, high-performance database applications â if a single Nutanix CVM can deliver 100,000 IOPS, a four-node Nutanix cluster can deliver an aggregated throughput of 400,000 IOPS.\n\nSimplify Management\n\nThe platform is simple, scalable, and enterprise-grade out of the box, and can easily be managed by IT generalists from within Prism.\n\nLeverage Hyperconverged Benefits\n\nABS delivers all the benefits of a hyperconverged environment, including intelligent data reduction, advanced disaster recovery, backup to the public cloud, and tiering capabilities.\n\nBridging the worlds of physical and virtual\n\nABS eliminates infrastructure silos by delivering the same simplicity Nutanix offers for virtualized workloads and file storage for physical workloads. In so doing, ABS bridges the physical and virtual worlds, consolidating infrastructure into a single unified platform.\n\nNutanix manages storage allocation and assignment for ABS through Volume Groups (VG). A VG is a collection of volumes known as virtual disks (vdisks). ABS presents VGs to both VMs and physical servers as iSCSI LUNs and managed by Prism."
