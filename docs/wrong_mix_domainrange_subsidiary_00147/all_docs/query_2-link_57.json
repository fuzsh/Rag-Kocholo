To resolve this issue, select a different authentication type for your POP3 server.POP3 sensor PE008The file you want to monitor cannot be found. To resolve this issue, use a file system activity monitoring tool to check if your sensor tries to access a locked or hidden file. Also check if the file exists on the computer your local or remote probe is running on. Enter the full local path. UNC paths are not allowed.WMI File sensor PE009The Windows process you want to monitor cannot be found. To resolve this issue, check if you correctly specified the process name in the sensor settings. Also check if the process is running on the target machine.Windows Process sensor PE010The Windows service you want to monitor cannot be found. To resolve this issue, set the sensor's scanning interval to 5 minutes or more to give the target system enough time to respond.

The reason might be that PRTG monitors the disks' DeviceIDs that can change in a cluster, for example. To resolve this issue, use a WMI Volume sensor and set it to use the drive letter for identification.WMI Free Disk Space (Multi Disk) sensor PE014The request sent to WMI timed out. To resolve this issue, increase the sensor's scanning interval. Also specify more limiting parameters for the WMI-specific request. For more information, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/1093 PE015Connection could not be establishedWMI connection PE016The WMI query does not return any results. The reason might be an issue with the host's WMI system. For more information, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/1093 PE017The WMI query returns an ambiguous result set. It returns too much data while PRTG expects only a single result. For more information, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/1093WMI Custom sensor PE018Your request has timed out. Depending on the sensor type you use, the reason might be that the sensor could not connect to the target host or that a PowerShell command takes too long to execute.

To resolve this issue, check the syntax of the request and make sure that only one field per request is processed. For more information, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/1093WMI/SQL query PE046WQL could not be parsed because the WQL query did not contain entries for SELECT or FROM. To resolve this issue, check the syntax of the request and make sure that both keywords are present in the WQL command.WMI/SQL query PE047The WQL file \"%s\" could not be opened. The reason might be that the file with the query is not available on the system that runs the PRTG probe.

To resolve this issue, check if there are any MIB files from the vendor of your device and use Paessler MIB Importer to convert the files for the SNMP Library sensor. PE050The number of interfaces found on this device is too large. To resolve this issue, retry using a smaller .oidlib file. PE051The WMI request has unrecoverably timed out.

PE053PRTG cannot activate the server on the specified port.Syslog/SNMP Trap PE054There has been a WMI system overload. To resolve this issue, increase the scanning intervals of your WMI sensors and/or use remote probes for load balancing. PE055The sensor stopped because of a WMI lockup. The probe was able to send a request to the WMI subsystem but the request did not get a response at all. To resolve this issue, try to restart the target machine and the system that runs the PRTG probe.

For more information, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/1093WMI/SSH memory PE062There has been a timeout because the sensor did not receive any data packets. To resolve this issue, try the QoS reflector script. For more information, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/61176Quality of Service (QoS) sensors PE063The sensor could not determine the state of the Hyper-V virtual machine. The reason might be that the virtual machine was renamed. In this case, you need to create a new Hyper-V sensor. PE064The Hyper-V virtual machine is running. PE065The Hyper-V virtual machine is turned off. PE066The Hyper-V virtual machine is paused. PE067The Hyper-V virtual machine is in a saved state.

Syslog messages have been dropped.Syslog Manager PE082The sensor has dropped NetFlow data. To resolve this issue, make sure that you set an Active Flow Timeout in the sensor settings that is one minute greater than the flow timeout value that you set in the target device. For more information, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/66485 PE083The NetFlow sensor has received and dropped flows with a time stamp older than the timespan defined by the active flow timeout. To resolve this issue, make sure that the sensor's Active Flow Timeout setting matches the flow timeout set in the flow exporter device. For more information, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/66485 PE084This error message is deprecated. PE085The target server did not return a valid time.

The reason might be that the WMI system does not send any capacity information. For troubleshooting solutions, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/3713Volume sensors PE089The port could not be opened for this sensor. To resolve this issue, check that you use different, unique ports for each QoS sensor so that packets can be correctly assigned. Also check that the port is opened in your firewall.QoS (Quality of Service) sensors PE090The UDP port could not be opened. To resolve this issue, make sure that the port is not in use.

The reason might be that it is stopped, pending, restarting, or otherwise inactive.Cisco IP SLA sensor PE110The flow processor buffer is full. The reason might be that PRTG is not able to process the flows. To resolve this issue, consider using remote probes. Also reduce the filtering and toplist parameters. For more information on the total number of flows that PRTG can process, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/20613Flow timeout PE111The flow processor has dropped flows. The reason might be that PRTG is not able to process the incoming flows fast enough. To resolve this issue, consider using remote probes. Also try to optimize your include, exclude, and filter rules.

To resolve this issue, change your vCenter settings to accept more connections at the same time. Also try to distribute your VMware sensors among several remote probes. For more information, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/30643 PE122This sensor type is deprecated and will not work with the current version of PRTG. We recommend that you pause it to keep its historic data. To continue monitoring, add a Citrix XenServer Virtual Machine sensor.Xen sensor deprecated; Citrix XenServer Virtual Machine sensor PE123There is no active connection for this remote IP address. The reason might be an issue with Cisco's SNMP component. The data that PRTG receives from the device is incorrect. To resolve this issue, see https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/59643SNMP Cisco ASA VPN Traffic sensor PE124The sensor could not access the mailbox you want to monitor. The reason might be a connection limit of the target mail server. To resolve this issue, check if you entered valid credentials in the sensor settings. Also run the email checks in smaller batches by creating schedules.IMAP sensor PE125This sensor type is deprecated and will not work with the current version of PRTG. We recommend that you pause it to keep its historic data. To continue monitoring, add a VMware Virtual Machine (SOAP) sensor.VMware sensor deprecated; VMware Virtual Machine (SOAP) sensor PE126This sensor type is deprecated and will not work with the current version of PRTG.
