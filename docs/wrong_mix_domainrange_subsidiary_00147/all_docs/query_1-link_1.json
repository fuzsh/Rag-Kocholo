        "text": "Can Cardio Server manage other modalities besides ECG data?\n\nYes, Cardio Server manages data from 25 different modalities including: resting ECG, 12-lead ECGs from bedside monitoring, Holter, stress testing, PFT, event monitoring, pacemaker follow-up, cardiac rehab, defibrillators, ambulatory blood pressure, EEG, non-invasive vascular, and more. We are eager to add other modalities that you may require.\n\nWhat device manufacturers can Cardio Server accept data from?\n\nWe communicate with over 260 devices from over 80 vendors. Check our compatibility page for the current list of interfaces.\n\nIf one of our modalities is not currently supported, will you add it to your integration library?\n\nYes, we are always looking to expand the list of modalities and vendors that we have integrated. Just introduce us to your vendor and encourage them to work with us to create an interface. We do the rest.\n\nHow many ECGs can you store in Cardio Server?\n\nECG storage is a function of disc space on your servers; you can add space as you desire. Cardio Server can manage millions of ECGs with standard network technology.\n\nWhat tools does Cardio Server offer to encourage online interpretation?\n\nCardio Server provides the most comprehensive editing functions in the industry including: drop-down menus with favorite check boxes, free text, macros, voice-recognition support, electronic calipers, and Intelligent Serial Comparison. Different favorites lists may be created for each physician in each reported modality.\n\nCan our physicians have their own unique custom favorite interpretive phrase list?Yes, we find physicians utilize around 50 or so interpretive phrases most of the time. We enable each reading physician to easily customize their own list for each supported modality.\n\nDoes Cardio Server support scanning in of previous ECGs and other diagnostic tests?\n\nYes, the PDF Naming Wizard enables Cardio Server to import PDFs of diagnostic test results that are randomly named and convert them into well-named exams with patient demographics, modality designations, date and time stamps, and physician interpretations. Once the studies are confirmed, they can be sent to your EMR.\n\nCan we interface multiple ECG vendors simultaneously across multiple hospitals, clinics, and physician practices?\n\nYes, and we support modality worklists with all the major ECG vendors.\n\nCan you transfer the 12-lead ECG interpretive algorithm statements from my cardiograph into Cardio Server?\n\nYes, if you are transferring ECGs with interpretations from a manufacturer's cardiographs, the statements and measurements pass through to Cardio Server without modification.\n\nDoes Cardio Server’s analysis criteria match the algorithm from third-party cardiographs?\n\nYes, it will display the interpretive statements and measurements generated by your existing cardiographs.\n\nDoes Cardio Server offer serial comparison reporting for 12-lead ECGs?\n\nYes, our Intelligent Serial Comparison tool provides additional information to the reading physician indicating changes between the current ECG and the most recent tracing as confirmed by the reading physician.\n\nWill Cardio Server’s serial comparison reporting for 12-lead ECGs work with my migrated ECG data?\n\nYes, migrated ECG data is received in Cardio Server as though it was originally processed by our system.\n\nWill serial comparison reporting for 12-lead ECGs work with my existing cardiographs (GE, Philips, Mortara, Welch Allyn, Burdick, Cardiac Science, Schiller, Nihon Kohden etc.)?\n\nYes, serial comparison works with legacy cardiographs without interfering with the original interpretations and measurements from those devices.\n\nAs we buy and/or upgrade existing equipment, will Cardio Server be compatible and be able to take advantage of the new features?\n\nIf your vendors are open in design, and update their export functions to include the new features, then we will continue to be compatible. Cardio Server currently accepts data from over 260 devices, in 25 different modalities, from over 80 vendors.\n\nCan Cardio Server send orders to cardiographs?\n\nYes. We support modality worklists for Baxter (legacy Welch Allyn/Mortara) GE, Philips, Schiller, and Nihon Kohden cardiographs. If you prefer another vendor for cardiographs, please encourage them to demonstrate open architecture and share their order formats with us. We are eager to work with all the major suppliers.\n\nAre the current interpretive analyses and measurements from our cardiographs utilized/displayed in Cardio Server?\n\nYes, the system displays the interpretive statements and measurements generated by your existing cardiographs.\n\nCan Cardio Server display ECGs in our preferred format such as 3x4 with a rhythm strip, 6x2, or 12x10, etc.?\n\nYes, the format saved by your cardiograph is presented in Cardio Server.\n\nIs Cardio Server just an \"electronic, paper-storage database\" or does it provide real ECG data management?\n\nCardio Server is a comprehensive ECG and diagnostic test result data management system. Cardio Server stores the raw ECG file, enhances workflow, allows physician online editing, supports automatic printing, email notification and report distribution, offers electronic calipers, and provides management tools for data analysis.\n\nDoes Cardio Server store the raw ECG file or just a picture (PDF) of the 12-lead ECG?\n\nThe raw ECG files are kept for a short period of time, we render the PDF file as needed in real-time. We store the raw ECG data in our binary format.\n\nCan Cardio Server provide online electronic calipers that function with ECGs from my existing cardiographs?\n\nYes, since we transfer the raw ECG file to Cardio Server, new measurements can be made with our online calipers.\n\nIf sometime in the future, we decide to replace Cardio Server, can our ECGs be migrated to another ECG management System?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes Cardio Server utilize Carl Osborne's Datamed format translators from Engineering Solutions, Inc.?\n\nYes, for some vendors' 12-lead ECG data we utilize Datamed format translators. Datamed translators are fully integrated into Cardio Server and do not require additional hardware. By the way, customers of GE, Philips, Siemens, Heartlab, and Cardiac Science also use Datamed. The patient monitoring customers for GE and Philips are two of the largest users for Datamed because it allows Philips' patient monitoring to export to MUSE and GE patient monitoring to export to Philips IntelliSpace ECG.\n\nIs Cardio Server compatible with virtual environments?\n\nYes, virtualized servers such as VMware, Citrix XenServer and Windows Server Hyper-V are supported.\n\nHow many concurrent users does Cardio Server support?\n\nCardio Server is scalable from 3 to 250 concurrent users. A concurrent user is not a seat license as with some systems. Concurrent users apply to anyone accessing the application simultaneously.\n\nHow does legacy Epiphany (now Baxter) address security?\n\nWe contract with consultants to identify system vulnerabilities. Those vulnerabilities that can be patched are released for the current version. Vulnerabilities that cannot be patched are addressed in the next release. This is an ongoing process to keep up with the evolving security threats.\n\nDoes Cardio Server support large IDNs (independent delivery networks)?\n\nYes. We offer broad flexibility to enterprise medical systems with multiple hospitals, clinics, and physician practices. Cardio Server supports different levels of complexity and workflow between various sized facilities within your IDN.\n\nDoes Cardio Server support sites in multiple time zones?\n\nYes, Cardio Server does support multiple time zones.\n\nIs Cardio Server compatible with Microsoft.Net architecture?\n\nYes, Cardio Server is compatible with Microsoft.Net but we do not require it.\n\nIs Cardio Server a web-based, true thin client application?\n\nYes, Cardio Server is web-based pure IIS. All functions such as reading, editing, and printing can be done from any PC on your network, subject to user privileges. No downloadable applets are required and all terminals on the network have full functionality.\n\nWhat does it mean to be \"web-based\"?\n\nWeb-based means Cardio Server runs in a standard web browser environment without ActiveX, Flash, or .Net. Web-based means interventionalists can view STEMI with the previous ECGs on iOS smart devices.\n\nWhat are Cardio Server’s mobile capabilities?\n\nCardio Server Mobile is a responsive web technology that enables providers to access and edit ECG data from anywhere with iOS or Android devices.\n\nCan we use our existing VPN technology for remote access to Cardio Server?\n\nYes; VPN is an excellent way to provide physicians and others access to their ECG data from home or office.\n\nCan we use our existing SAN, NAS, tape, etc. backup system with Cardio Server?\n\nYes; simply add Cardio Server to your regular backup procedures.\n\nCan we use our existing SAN for the live database storage?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes Cardio Server support Active Directory for single sign on and authentication?\n\nYes.\n\nIs LDAP based authentication compatible with Cardio Server?\n\nYes.\n\nIs our preferred virus protection plan compatible with Cardio Server?\n\nYes, Cardio Server is a web application running on your infrastructure.\n\nWhat database program does Cardio Server use?\n\nCardio Server utilizes MySQL.\n\nHow much system administrator support is required by Cardio Server?\n\nCardio Server requires little day-to-day maintenance. Chief maintenance tasks include patch management, backup oversight, virus protection maintenance, and periodic log review. Note that these recommended practices are generally no different than standard support for any other server – Cardio Server does not require specialized “care and feeding.”\n\nCan Cardio Server take orders from and send results (including waveforms) to our EMR?\n\nYes, and Cardio Server can support 25 different modality types into your EMR with one bidirectional interface. Cardio Server has its own, internally developed HL7 tool that allows us to customize inbound and outbound HL7 messages to your specifications. Currently deployed to all major EMRs: Affinity, Allscripts, Athena, Centricity, Cerner, Clinview, CPSI, eClinical, Eclipsys, Epic, HMS, Iatric, Keane, McKesson, Medhost, NextGen, Opus, Prognosis, Pulse, Quadramed, Vista, Siemens, Meditech, Heartland, ChartMaxx.\n\nCan I view ECG data within my cardiology PACS system?\n\nYes, in most cases. Cardio Server supports an API link and other technologies to receive requests from cardiology PACS to display 12-lead ECGs and other reports within the PACS viewer.\n\nWhat is an API (application program interface)?\n\nAn API is the interface that an application provides in order to allow requests for services to be made of it by other computer programs, and/or to allow data to be exchanged between them. In the case of Cardio Server, an API could be used to access ECGs from your PACS.\n\nIs an extra server required to interface to cardiographs?\n\nYes. Two manufacturers’ devices that Cardio Server integrates with do require ELI Link or GE DICOM Gateway Pro.\n\nCan legacy Epiphany (now Baxter) migrate ECG data from other ECG Management systems?\n\nYes. We have migrated millions of ECGs from MUSE, TraceMaster/IntelliSpace, Cerner, and Pyramis.\n\nDoes Baxter provide 24/7 support?\n\nYes.\n\nAre upgrades, updates, new versions etc. included in the support agreement?\n\nYes, all upgrades are included with an active support agreement. Professional service fees are applied for project management and implementation services. Third-party license upgrades, such as Microsoft Operating systems, and hardware are the user's responsibility.\n\nDo you have local support for our installation?\n\nYou provide your own server hardware, your IT department is the front line of hardware support, and we provides secure, remote software support. Our entire application can be remotely installed and entirely rebuilt in the event of a catastrophic failure. We support over 1,100 systems worldwide.\n\nDo I need to print and scan the rhythm strips?\n\nNo. Baxter’s RSM solution imports the rhythm strips without the need for paper printing, duplicating, or manual scanning.\n\nDoes RSM support multiple-format rhythm strips?\n\nYes. Report format is configured by the monitoring system. RSM will accept the format your hospital most commonly uses.\n\nWill I be able to see the rhythm strips in the patient’s chart in Epic?\n\nYes. RSM will export the rhythm strips automatically as a PDF file. This is handled as a non-solicited order.\n\nCan I search in RSM for a patient’s rhythm strips and print them for clinical evaluation?\n\nYes. RSM will keep all rhythm strips for a predetermined number of days (this number is set at the time of implementation); the strips can be printed as well. Most often, clinical evaluation is done within the EMR.\n\nHow long will strips remain in RSM?\n\nRhythm strips may be sent directly to the EMR and/or retained in Cardio Server's RSM solution for a specified number of days. Based on the volume of studies processed daily and the storage capacity allocated by the hospital’s IT team during project implementation, the strips may be retained by RSM for as long as needed.\n\nI am a nurse practitioner on a telemetry hospital floor with 36 beds. My nursing staff now prints an average of 200 rhythm strips per day, yielding a total of approximately 78,000 strips per year. How much will our hospital save if we implement RSM?\n\nHospital workflows vary and every department has a unique way of managing rhythm strips. By reducing, or in many cases eliminating, the need to print the rhythm strips, the hospital saves substantially on the cost for thermal paper and/or 8x11 paper. The hospital also saves labor costs by eliminating the manual work necessary in printing, cutting, pasting, photocopying, and scanning the rhythm strips into the hospital’s EMR.\n\nOur hospital already has Cardio Server. Can RSM be installed on the same server?\n\nYes; please contact your representative to confirm your specific configuration.\n\nCan RSM handle more than one rhythm strip per patient?\n\nYes. RSM supports an unlimited number of rhythm strips per patient.\n\nDoes RSM support a mixed environment of Philips PIIC Classic and PIIC Information Centers?\n\nYes. Hospitals may have a combination of Philips Information Centers. RSM will support both Philips PIIC Classic and Philips PIIC iX systems.\n\nCan RSM send the rhythm strips directly to the EMR?\n\nYes. RSM is configured as a pass-thru system, enabling the strips to be sent directly to the EMR, eliminating the need for the user to log-in to RSM to retrieve or validate a rhythm strip."
