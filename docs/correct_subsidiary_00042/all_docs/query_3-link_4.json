        "text": "BMC Software on Thursday revealed plans to buy change management company Marimba with its fourth-quarter earnings announcement.\n\nHouston-based BMC reported earnings of $36.9 million on $400.2 million in sales for the fourth quarter ended March 31. That compared with earnings of $20.6 million on sales of $380.7 million for the year-ago period.\n\nThe company also said licensing books were up 35 percent year-over-year.\n\nFor the year, BMC reported a loss of $26.8 million on sales of $1.41 billion, compared with earnings of $48 million on sales of $1.32 billion the prior year.\n\nBMC CFO George Harrington said cash flow from operations reached $506.5 million for the year, which exceeded the company's earlier guidance of between $400 million to $450 million.\n\n\"We stengthened our balance sheet with over $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and over $1.4 billion in total deferred revenue at &#91;the end of the&#93; quarter,\" he said.\n\nHarrington also said the company's expenses were higher than expected, rising about $11 million sequentially, primarily because of what he said was a strong increase in deferred revenue. \"We also had an equity write-down of $4 million that impacted our income,\" he said.\n\nDuring the earnings call, BMC announced a merger agreement with Marimba, a Mountain View, Calif.-based provider of change management technology.\n\nThe deal will cost BMC approximately $239 million, BMC executives said. Marimba's product line will be integrated into BMC's Business Service Management offerings."
