        "text": "KIRKLAND, WA., 2021 年 2 月 8 日 – Tanium, the provider of endpoint management and security built for the world’s most demanding IT environments, today announced that Matt Thompson has joined the company’s Board of Directors as an independent director. Thompson was most recently the Executive Vice President of Worldwide Field Operations at Adobe, overseeing global sales, partnerships, ecommerce, consulting and services, and customer success operations.\n\n“Having worked closely throughout my career with c-suite executives, I’ve seen firsthand the evolving complexity that an expanding IT landscape presents,” said Thompson. “Tanium’s open endpoint management platform delivers exactly what business leaders working in a complex environment crave: a solution that easily plugs into the existing tech stack to give them real-time visibility and control across their endpoint landscape. I look forward to being a member of the Board of Directors and helping accelerate the next chapter of Tanium’s growth.”\n\n“I’m thrilled to welcome Matt to our board and quickly bring his deep sales, marketing and partnership knowledge to bear for our teams,” said Orion Hindawi, co-founder and CEO, Tanium. “His impressive scale and growth mindset aligns with Tanium’s vision for the future and his GTM knowledge will be indispensable to Tanium as we focus on serving a broader range of customers to provide manageability, security and insight where digital business begins, at the endpoint.”\n\nThis appointment continues Tanium’s strategy to add experienced operators to its Board of Directors to help the company scale as it works toward its next chapter of growth. Tanium also recently appointed Mark Fields, former CEO of Ford Motor Company, and David Rowland, executive chairman of Accenture, to its Board of Directors.\n\nThompson joined Adobe in 2007 and during his tenure he led the growth of the company from $2 billion in sales to now over $12 billion, scaling the field organization to over 10,000 people. His leadership was instrumental in driving the company’s transformation from a perpetual license model to a subscription model. All of these successes have allowed Adobe to join the Top 50 companies in market capitalization, having grown from $20 billion in 2007 to over $225 billion today.\n\nPrior to Adobe, Thompson held a number of sales and field operation leadership roles in the software space, including as a member of the executive team for Borland Software (acquired by Micro Focus), Marimba (acquired by BMC Software), Calico Commerce (acquired by PeopleSoft) and Cadence Design Systems. He began his career at Electronic Data Systems.\n\nCurrently, Thompson sits on the Board of NCR and Ellucian and previously held a board role with Appirio (acquired by Wipro).\n\nタニウムについて\n\nTanium offers endpoint management and security that is built for the world’s most demanding IT environments. Many of the world’s largest and most sophisticated organizations, including nearly half of the Fortune 100, top retailers and financial institutions, and multiple branches of the US Armed Forces rely on Tanium to make confident decisions, operate efficiently and effectively, and remain resilient against disruption. Tanium has been named to the Forbes Cloud 100 list of “Top 100 Private Companies in Cloud Computing” for five consecutive years and ranks 4th on FORTUNE’s list of the “Best Workplaces in Technology 2020.” Visit us at www.tanium.com and follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter."
