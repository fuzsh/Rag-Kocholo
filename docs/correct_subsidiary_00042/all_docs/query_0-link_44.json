        "text": "Don't send your money down the, well, you know. Asset management tools can save dollars wasted by expiring leases and redundant licenses, but they can also team up with network management and security tools for the ultimate in control.\n\nAre you looking for more dollars for new technology purchases and initiatives? Like many campus administrators, you might be surprised to learn that your previous technology investments could be hoarding your cash. In fact, one oft-overlooked (and yes, decidedly unsexy) aspect of IT management on your campus can have a sizable impact on your tech budget: IT asset management.\n\nWhy Track and Manage?\n\nIn short, IT asset management means effectively using software tools to help you keep track of not just what hardware and software you have running, but much more: when you purchased each machine; what processor each is running; who installed what on them, and when; how heavily they’re being used; and when and how they will be (or have been) retired. And since many of your campus IT assets probably are not computers yet still fall under your province, you can add that same level of management need to audiovisual equipment, digital cameras, lab tools, and anything else you should be tracking.\n\nOne way that such tools can save you money right away is by helping you monitor license usage more efficiently. That means tracking which software products are being heavily used, and which aren’t being used at all. License monitoring is one place where you can expect a quick return for your effort. (Perhaps you can transfer some of those 100 licenses purchased for a photo-editing program for one department, to another department that’s been asking for the same program? What about the usage of that obscure lab reporting software purchased at the behest of an instructor—is anyone actually using it?) IT asset management programs can also help you assess whether you’re renewing software licenses in a timely manner. Other savings lie in determining when hardware warranties are due to expire, for better replacement planning. Or, perhaps you want to keep track of how a particular machine has held up, and under what sort of use. Such information can help you determine whether to buy more of the same. Disposing of old hardware can be an asset-tracking nightmare by itself: For security reasons, you want to make sure hard disks are scrubbed of sensitive data, for example, and monitors are disposed of in an environmentally correct manner.\n\nIT asset management software can assist you with all of that, and although it’s been thoroughly exploited by savvy corporate CIOs, it’s still something of a new concept on higher education campuses (see box below, “The Value of Full Lifecycle Asset Management.”) Importantly, asset management tools can also assist with a whole constellation of other issues, ranging from chores that used to be performed solely by network management tools, to functions traditionally found in security products."
