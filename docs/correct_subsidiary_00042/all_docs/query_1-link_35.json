        "text": "Cisco Systems and IBM plan to collaborate more closely on datacenter products, beginning with a version of Cisco’s IGESM (Intelligent Gigabit Ethernet Switch Module) that will plug in to IBM’s eServer BladeCenter server chassis. IBM will improve support for Cisco’s products with its management software, including the Tivoli Provisioning Manager and SAN Manager products. The IGESM module, which can be managed with BladeCenter’s management software, will be available in May for $4,999.\n\nSonic, Software AG Tout ESB Plans\n\nSonic Software next month plans to deliver a new version of its ESB (enterprise service bus) that aims to increase the availability of services interoperating over services-oriented networks. Version 5.5 will include expanded transport technology support, itinerary-based intelligent routing, and XML-based support for multiple data formats. Software AG plans to join the ESB fray next month with the introduction of software to manage distributed Web services in the enterprise. The company’s Service Integrator product will be a single piece of distributed software positioned as an ESB."
