        "text": "As a young Black woman, Dr. Akilah Cadet experienced judgement, “isms”, and numerous barriers in the workplace. One day she thought, “what if I could change that?” and Change Cadet was started. Cadet, her last name, is a French term that means soldier. Change Cadet prepares individuals and companies to be soldiers of change in the workforce so there can be more women and people of color at the top. She wants everyone to feel empowered in their career. To accomplish this, she provides people and companies with services that support anti-racism, diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging (DEIB) including executive coaching, strategic planning, facilitation, and crisis recovery. She advises tech startups from concept to staffing, facilitates strategic workshops, coaches leaders, and speaks at various engagements. Dr. Cadet knows the only way to achieve the goal of true inclusiveness in the workplace is to work with, coach, and speak to as many companies and individuals as possible. She wants Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) to know they have something special, for companies to truly recognize the value of their employees, and well, to change the face of the stereotypical leader so that no one would feel how she felt most of her career.\n\nDr. Cadet has 15+ years in management and building successful projects, teams, and leaders in the public and private sectors. She is a 2021 Forbes Next 1000 Honoree and honored as one of Staffing Industry Analysts’ (SIA) 2021 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Influencers. Forbes and the Wall Street Journal Diversity and Business Newsletter have featured her work. She has worked on federal, state, and privately funded multimillion-dollar projects ranging from public health/healthcare to education. She has spent an extensive part of her career designing training, coaching executives, and informing systematic change to improve the workforce experience for large organizations. Dr. Cadet holds a Bachelor of Science in Health Education in Community Based Public Health, a Master of Public Health, and a Doctorate of Health Sciences in Leadership and Organizational Behavior. But more importantly, she lives in/loves Oakland, has an incredible shoe game, and is a proud Beyoncé advocate.\n\nMimi grew up on her family’s vineyard, Bethel Heights. Her adventures fueled her passion for studying botany, forestry, and ecology. Mimi earned her MS from Oregon State University in Forest Science, and spent the next several years working as a botanist and ecologist for the Forest Service, living in the backcountry. Her work in the forests led her to realize that the greatest threats to the future of the planet and all species had to be addressed at its root – in the agricultural and working land base. Mimi returned to Bethel Heights in 2005, where she implemented new farming systems and began a journey of experimentation and discovery. In 2016 Mimi left Bethel Heights to grow and make wine at her home vineyard and living laboratory, Hope Well. Hope Well is the living model for a habitat-based regenerative model for agriculture. Mimi’s experiments are all with the goal of producing the most nutrient-dense, healthy food and wine, while recovering the natural systems of nutrient cycling, improving biodiversity and species retention, and maximizing the function and output of a diverse ecosystem.\n\nWill Drayton is the Director of Technical Viticulture, Sustainability and Research at Treasury Wine Estates\n\n(TWE), one of the world’s largest wine companies.

A New Englander by birth, Ben fell in love with agriculture in the verdant fields of northern California in high school. Ever since, Ben has been managing farms, improving soils, and educating the next crop of environmental stewards with a holistic view of farming with natural systems. No stranger to Napa, he previously lived on Mt Veeder, where he fell in love with the oak and madrone woodlands and made friends with the local ravens. When Ben is not helping Napa’s vineyards adopt 21st century practices, he is spending time with his impressive wife and two wild children in the woods and on the water. Ben currently occupies Nisenan Territory and is a proud alumnus of Sterling College in Northeast Vermont, where he received a BA in Sustainable Agriculture.\n\nEric Mayer earned a PhD in Environmental Engineering from Stanford, where he studied fluid\n\nmechanics and hydrology and published research improving global climate simulations. After\n\ngraduating and desiring to have a more immediate effect on the climate crisis, Eric went to\n\nwork for LightWater, a Florida-based biotechnology company focused on developing a scalable\n\nalgal bioreactor to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. However,\n\nupon learning of biochar and the simple technologies already developed for its production, Eric\n\nbecame convinced that biochar held more immediate promise for scalable carbon capture and\n\nstorage, and Napachar was born. Today, you can find Eric and Napachar in the vineyards and\n\nforests of Napa and Sonoma, diverting pulled vines and forestry slash from burn piles to roast in\n\ntheir customized biochar kilns, returning the carbon to the soil.\n\nIn 1982 Steve McIntyre received his master’s degree in enology from California State University, Fresno. In 1982 he and his wife Kimberly moved to Carmel Valley, California to develop Galante Vineyards and Winery. In late 1983 Steve took a position with Smith & Hook Winery in Soledad, Calif. as an Assistant Winemaker, later returning to his agrarian roots to become viticulturist in 1985.\n\nIn 1992 Steve and Kimberly founded Monterey Pacific, Inc., a viticulture management and development company, which rapidly grew from 432 acres to become the 5th largest vineyard management company in the U.S. at over 17,000 acres.\n\nIn 2002, along with partners Mike Filice and Eric Laumann, Steve cofounded the Monterey Wine Company in King City, California. This12,000 ton state of the art custom wine processing facility developed a reputation for first class customer service and technological prowess. Among its many notable accomplishments MWC was the first commercial winery in the US to introduce Flash détente to the wine industry.\n\nSteve and Kim founded McIntyre Vineyards on 1998 and produce small lot, handmade wines from their Estate Vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands AVA.

This inspiration developed into a career path in the field of natural resource management beginning in 2013 when Sierra first joined the City of Napa’s Recycling Division where she helped usher in city-wide composting residentially and in our schools. She worked this job while studying for her B.S. in Conservation & Resource Studies from UC Berkeley where she had the opportunity to take a course on Agroecology that shifted her direction into agriculture. She started with an 85-hour permaculture design course in Oakland that inspired a career shift into viticulture. After a diverse array of experiences, Sierra found a greater calling to return to the Napa Valley to work alongside leaders for climate resiliency. When she is not working with growers to help them achieve their climate action goals, Sierra devotes her time toward training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and petting every cat she encounters.\n\nJason Moulton is the Director of Winemaking and Viticulture for Whitehall Lane Winery. A native of Illinois, Jason made his way to New Zealand and graduated from the Lincoln University Viticulture and Enology program just outside of Christchurch. He spent a number of years making wine in the Russian River, British Columbia, New Zealand, Bordeaux, South Africa, and finally to Napa Valley, where he recently completed his 23rd harvest. Through the years, Jason has ascended the ranks from Cellar Worker to Cellar Master, Assistant Winemaker to Winemaker. Apart from winemaking, he believes wine service, wine education, and sensory are of great importance and in 2017, became a certified sommelier through the Court of Master Sommeliers. As the Director of Winemaking and Viticulture at Whitehall Lane, he oversees not only the winemaking production and vineyard management, but leads it in an effort to be environmentally sensitive and sustainable in all facets.\n\nPaul Muller has been growing certified organic vegetables since 1985 on Full Belly Farm in the Capay Valley of northern California, north of Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay area. He co-owns the operation with three other partners. It comprises of almost 400 acres where they grow 80 different crops in rotation (fruits, vegetables, herbs, nuts, grains, and flowers) along with products produced with the help of chickens, sheep, goats, and several cows. Full Belly successfully provides year-round employment for 80 people while selling the bulk of their produce within a 120-mile radius of the farm. They were already using cover crops and planting habitat areas for beneficial insects and wildlife. Now as a recipient of a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) from the NRCS, Muller has turned part of his acreage into a no-till management site to see if they can improve the quality of the soil and sequester more carbon. This is in alignment with their goal to integrate farm production with sustainable long-term environmental stewardship.\n\nThe soil is the foundation for all they do at Full Belly Farm. Paul Muller explains on their website that the ability of plants to resist disease and non-beneficial insects as well as being as nutritious and tasty as can be depends tremendously on the fertility and over-all quality of the land it is grown on. Therefore, awareness and management of the soil ecology is their highest priority.\n\nAndreas is co-founder and CEO of UAV-IQ Precision Agriculture which specializes in leveraging the powerful capabilities of drones in order to develop and provide services which solve some of the most pressing challenges that growers face.\n\nPrior to founding UAV-IQ, Andreas was a senior Air Force officer and an instructor pilot in its primary aerial refueling platform before moving into unmanned aviation, where he was instrumental in leading the design of programs and operational procedures to employ emerging remotely piloted vehicle technology on a global scale.\n\nAndreas developed the roots of UAV-IQ while in UCLA’s Executive MBA program, and has since navigated complex regulatory and operational environments so UAV-IQ could become the first company in California authorized to conduct commercial drone operations in agriculture. Using his military experience where he developed practical solutions using new technology, he now has positioned UAV-IQ to lead the emerging market for drone-applied biological control featuring the release of beneficial insects and mites for agriculture pest control through its BioDrop service.\n\nOver the past five years, he has spent thousands of hours in the field working closely with growers to learn about the problems they face at a deep level, and has earned the trust of renowned customers and partners by ensuring the technology and services UAV-IQ develops reliably meets their needs. He especially enjoys spending time at vineyards, where he can learn more about his hobby of winemaking while enjoying a glass after work.\n\nMr. Ott is currently the CEO of Eaton Drilling Co LLC overseeing the transformation of the company from solely extraction based to a total water management company respecting the full water cycle. Previously, Mr. Ott managed Public Works and Environmental planning activities for the Dry Creek Rancheria.

Soon after, he took a job in wine sales at Wine Cask, a multi-faceted restaurant with an iconic reputation as Santa Barbara’s culinary and wine landmark. His experience there cemented his passion for wine and set him on a future career path with some\n\nof California’s leading Pinot Noir producers.\n\nLonging for a hands-on connection to the winemaking process, Priest joined Wild Horse Winery and Vineyards in 1989 as part of the harvest crush crew. He eventually worked his way up to become Winemaker in 1999 and oversaw the crafting of more than 30 varietals. In 2002, he received critical acclaim at Adelaida Cellars in Paso Robles, particularly for his estate red wines, before joining Taz Vineyards in\n\nSanta Barbara as Winemaker and Director of Operations in 2003. Etude’s Founding Winemaker Tony Soter personally tapped him to be his successor in the Spring of 2005.\n\nFor almost two decades, Priest has crafted Etude wines with a simple creed. “Pinot Noir exhibits true transparency to the land and conditions where it is grown, and that careful and attentive winegrowing and winemaking is necessary to capture this sense of place in the glass. Understanding soil types, microclimates, and how to be the very best steward of the land is also key to preserving our community, our ecosystem and our vineyard for generations,” he says.\n\nWhether sourcing from our sustainably certified estate, Grace Benoist Ranch, located in the northwest corner of Sonoma’s Carneros, Fiddlestix, and North Canyon vineyards in California’s Central Coast; Yamhela in Oregon’s Yamhill-Carlton AVA, or in the Central Otago of New Zealand, he is focused on carefully highlighting the very best from each vineyard. This practice is elegantly revealed in every glass of Etude wine.\n\nIn addition to being a winemaker, Priest is among an elite group of California equestrians who compete in racing events covering great distances over legendary trails once crossed by earlier pioneers. Today, it’s not uncommon to spot him trail running or riding on horseback through Etude’s Carneros Estate Vineyards, keeping a close eye on the vines.\n\nJancis Robinson was voted the world’s most influential wine critic in polls in the US, France and internationally in 2018 – although Jancis describes herself as a wine writer rather than a wine critic. She founded JancisRobinson.com in 2000, selling the award-winning, subscription-only wine website to US digital publisher Recurrent Ventures in 2021. She is now editor in chief and main contributor. She has been wine correspondent for the Financial Times since 1990 and writes for this global publication and ft.com every Saturday.\n\nShe is founder-editor of The Oxford Companion to Wine, co-author with Hugh Johnson of The World Atlas of Wine (nearly five million copies sold) and co-author of Wine Grapes, each of these books recognised as a standard reference worldwide.

In one week in April 2016 she was presented with France’s Officier du Mérite Agricole, the German VDP’s highest honour and, in the US, her fourth James Beard Award. She now has six, including being the only wine writer elevated to the James Beard Cookbook Hall of Fame. In 2018 she launched her own hand-made, dishwasher-friendly, ideal wine glass and in 2021 became a trustee of the Gérard Basset Foundation designed to increase diversity and inclusion in the worlds of wine, spirits and hospitality though education.\n\nShe loves and lives for wine in all its glorious diversity, generally favouring balance and subtlety over sheer mass, having campaigned for associated sustainability issues since 2006.\n\nMichael Silacci did not know what he wanted to be when he grew up. So, he took a couple of years to travel through Asia and Europe to window-shop for a profession. When he arrived in France, his knowledge of French was limited to “bon voyage”. Someone suggested that if he wanted to eat well, speak French, and earn some francs, he should harvest grapes. Two-hour lunches and fine wine were all it took to lead him down the path to winemaking— and a life spent walking among the vines.\n\nAssuming full responsibility for all aspects of vineyard management and winemaking, Michael was named Winemaker at Opus One in May 2003. He has been at Opus One since March of 2001, first serving as Director of Viticulture and Enology.\n\nPrior to his current appointment, Michael spent six years as winemaker at Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars, one year as winemaker at King Estate in Oregon, and six years at Beaulieu Vineyard as enologist and viticulturist. He has also made wine in France and Chile. He holds a master’s degree in viticulture from U.C. Davis in addition to under-graduate degrees in enology and viticulture from U.C. Davis and the Université de Bordeaux.\n\nEmbracing a holistic vision of winegrowing as the ultimate expression of terroir, Michael ensures that the connection between viticulture and winemaking at Opus One is seamless, reflecting the philosophy of founders Baron Philippe de Rothschild and Robert Mondavi.\n\nOpus One produces ultra-premium wines at its Napa Valley winery in Oakville, California. The 2019 vintage was released on October 1st and is distributed in all 50 U.S. States and 90 countries worldwide.\n\nNikki Silvestri is, first and foremost, a mother of two, wife, and sci-fi nerd. Nikki is also a serial non-profit executive director and entrepreneur (currently the CEO and founder of Soil and Shadow), a board member of Greenpeace USA, and an international keynote speaker.\n\nNikki’s unique approach to inclusion, leadership and organizational development takes cues from nature, building models of “social fertility” to weave them into a Joy and Impact™ framework. Her work also encourages a rigorous and shame-free approach to acknowledging our societal shadows and blind spots, especially when attempting to balance the triple bottom line (ecology, economy, and equity) in times of uncertainty, climate/health feedback loops, and increasing volatility.\n\nNikki’s wide-ranging career has taken her from presentations at the White House and negotiations with the Environmental Protection Agency to intimate workshops with local businesses and small retail organizing. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including ELLE Magazine’s Gold Award and OxFam America’s Act Local, Think Global Award, and she was named one of The Root’s 100 Most Influential African Americans.\n\nYou can find out more at www.nikkisilvestri.com and www.soilandshadow.com\n\nNufo was born in Patzimaro, Michoacan, Mexico. From a young age, he dreamed of going to school, but his family were ranchers in Mexico, and he was told: “Books do not feed you; animals and land do.” Following his dreams, Nufo travelled to Napa at the age of 14, but quickly realized in order to get an education, he needed money. He began working at Charles Krug as a field worker and mechanic’s assistant while following crops through Arizona, California, and Washington. He eventually worked his way through school and was able to enroll in Napa Valley College in 1984. Since he began at the college, he has completed enough courses to receive three Associates Degrees – while working full-time and raising a family.
