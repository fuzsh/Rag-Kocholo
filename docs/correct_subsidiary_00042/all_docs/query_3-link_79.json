It’s all about unifying IT processes together for better decision making in context of the business. Heart of BSM. Key enabler for all IT processes and BMC solutions 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n10 Check out this Ecosystem\n\nMany BMC products are now BMC Atrium Activated No other vendor has this level of out of the box integration BMC Remedy Asset Management BMC Remedy Service Desk BMC Remedy Change Management BMC Service Level Management BMC Service Impact Manager BMC Performance Manager BMC Mainview BMC SW Configuration Mgmt BMC Control-M CMDB This is where we want to bring out the fact that this is: More than a warmed over AM, Discovery or HD database Instead, this is a purpose built product whose components will be discussed in more detail in a subsequent section This application is already integrated to 9 different software solutions as part of our overall vision of making it an enabler of BSM. No one else can really say this. We may be asked, but are not advertising, that this is not being offered as a stand alone at this time. If you are, the best answer is to say that it is only available with apps right now, a decision that is consistent with our stated BSM strategies and the fact that most of the value is derived through the applications Tripwire (Verification/Audit)** Voyence (Network CCM)** IDS Scheer Oracle Databases Microsoft SMS Microsoft SQL Databases BMC Foundation Discovery BMC Configuration Discovery BMC Topology Discovery BMC Identity Discovery ** Partner Integration 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n11 BMC Atrium CMDB 2.0 –Common Data Model (CDM)\n\nExtend common data model to include: Business processes User identity and roles Mainframes Batch processes Service oriented architectures Common Data Model Extensions Provides enhanced mechanisms that make it easier to configure/customize the CDM Ease of data migration Extension Packs Used by specific data provider/consumer to extend the CDM in a controlled way Used by BMC and Partner solutions Situation: “Where do put my data?” Customers had a hard time getting started with the Common Data Model (CDM) 1.0 and they didn’t know where to put their CI data from existing sources. Too many classes CDM 1.0: 120 CI Classes  CDM 2.0: 75 Classes CDM 1.0: 60 relationship classes  CDM 2.0: 16 Classes Classes names weren’t always obvious Too many relationship types What did we do different in 2.0? Reduced the “clutter” in the data model Leverage namespaces to partition the data model Created the concept of “extension classes” Benefits Easier to use, customize and migrate data to/from the Atrium CMDB. 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n12 BMC Atrium CMDB Common Data Model\n\n16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n13 BMC Atrium CMDB 2.0 – Reconciliation Engine\n\nWorkflow Enabled Compare Activity Manage change verification Workflow to take specific actions based on compare results Notify users Create incident (unplanned change) Reconciliation Sandbox Supports overlay datasets Controls how and when reconciled data gets moved into the production CMDB Event driven reconciliation Initiated reconciliation in ad hoc fashion via API Reconciliation Activates RE activities: copy, delete, purge datasets COPY, DELETE and PURGE CI’s during RE jobs 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n14 Federation of Data What is “Federation”?\n\nDefinition: Federation refers to a central repository holding Configuration Items and Relationships directly, while linking to other data in other sources There are two types of data to federate: Data you might choose to federate if you want to track it, but not track it as often or as vigorously as a CI’s key attributes (Extended Data) Data referenced by a CI to provide additional content related to the functionality of the CI, but not part of the CI itself (Related Data) Federation of Data: Federation refers to a central repository holding some data directly, while linking to other data in other sources From the library card catalog example, the CMDB is the Card Catalog, or directory service and the extended and related data are the shelves of books holding the related data. There are two types of data to federate: Data you might choose to federate if you want to track it, but not track it as often or as vigorously as a CI’s key attributes AND: Data referenced by a CI to provide additional content on extended functionality to the CI, but not part of the CI itself Example for data type 1:For example, the CMDB record for an employee might have a Skills attribute that contains a list of the employee’s skills, and a Department attribute that contains the employee’s department name. It might also be involved in a relationship with an HR data store where additional attributes, like Salary, that are not really important from a configuration perspective are stored. Example for data type 2:For example, your CI records for software instances might have a License relationship containing the URL to an intranet page where the license is posted, or each CI record might have a Problem relationship that contains the information necessary to search a problem 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n15 Federation Management\n\nConfigurable Product Registry Easily configure federated data sources and how to access them from CMDB Federated Data Linking CMDB provides efficient methods for linking to external data “Right click” launch to federated data directly from CI Relationship Viewer Enabled “launch in context” Link to federated data in context of how data relates to specific CI Decrease cost and effort involved in maintaining point-to-point integrations between more IT processes technology management disciplines by using the CMDB as a single point of reference for more infrastructure components, users, business processes and their dependencies 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n16 BMC Atrium CMDB’s Federated Approach\n\nScalable approach to implementing a CMDB Leverage existing technologies already in place Provides single place to access all information about CI’s 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n17 Audience-based service visualization in the CMDB\n\nService Model View Service Model Editor Service Impact View Service Impact Manager IT Process User View CI Viewer 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n18 BMC® Atrium CMDB logically unifies asset and CI data across tools and processes\n\nITSM Suite Reconciled data set BMC IT Discovery Suite Change & Configuration Management 3rd Party BMC data set CCM 3rd Party Infrastructure Correlated Event Mgt And so the other part of the big picture is the CMDB. So where does all this discovery data go, and how is it accessed for asset lifecycle management? Information returned by discovery tools is stored and modeled in a Configuration Management Database, or CMDB. There’s a lot of marketing spin out there about what a CMDB actually is, so let’s walk briefly through what ours is, what it isn’t, and why it’s important. The BMC CMDB is an intelligent repository for data that creates and dynamically maintains a logical model of your IT environment. It includes an asset repository, but is much, much more than that. The BMC CMDB is a foundation component of Business Services Management shared by multiple BMC tools, as well as third-party tools. It’s a way to get all your various creators of IT environment data (such as discovery tools) as well as consumers of data (such as management tools) to represent assets, configurations and relationships in a common language. The CMDB is important because it allows you to work with a consistent model of your IT environment across interrelated IT management processes, even if you are using different tools to automate those processes. So let’s talk about what comprises the BMC CMDB. First, the CMDB contains a common data model extended from industry standards such as the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF). It not only includes pre-built data structures for more than 180 different classes of asset and Configuration Items, it also includes 80 different types of relationships between CIs. And it can store not only a current state of an asset or CI, but also it’s previous state and relationships, a future target state and relationships. And you can extend and modify the data model to meet your unique needs. Second, there is out-of-the-box integration to BMC discovery tools as well as Microsoft SMS. Third, the BMC CMDB includes an open API to leverage your existing investments and to enable partner products, including third-party discovery tools, to write to and access CMDB data. When data comes in from the discovery tools, it’s held in a staging area in separate datasets-- until it is reconciled. This leads to a fourth and very important service available for the CMDB: the Reconciliation Engine. The Reconciliation Engine uses business rules to sort through and analyze different datasets created by different discovery tools, and reconcile them into reliable production data. For example, you can specify that for the available disk space in a server, always trust Marimba Configuration Discovery over Microsoft SMS. Reconciliation rules for BMC discovery tools will be provided out of the box, but we also make it easy for you to add and customize rules so you can incrementally tune and then fine tune the engine to your unique needs and your own discovery tools. In cases where data can’t be automatically reconciled, the Reconciliation Engine provides workflow to make manual reconciliation faster and easier. You may decide to run discovery and reconciliation once a month, once a week, once a day—whatever works best for you, depending largely on the level of accuracy you need at that point in your IT asset management program. Once you have performed reconciliation you now have a reliable production dataset that can be used for asset management. The CMDB is not only integrated with Remedy Asset Management, it is the native data model for these applications. In fact, all Remedy ITSM applications were just re-architected in version 6.0 available so the CMDB is an inseparable part of Remedy Asset Management, Remedy Change Management and Remedy Help Desk. The CMDB is also integrated as part of the Service Impact Management RTV where the CMDB’s picture of the IT environment and its inter-dependencies is used to interpret the significance of events in your infrastructure, and how these events may be impacting or about to impact your business services What the CMDB is NOT: It’s not a professional services engagement. The CMDB is real, out-of-the-box, and part of several BMC products, including all Remedy ITSM applications. It will be generally available early next quarter, and is part of our early access program for select customers happening this November. It’s not something that forces you to have a massive database or a massive data integration project. First, you can federate multiple BMC CMDBs, or have a single instance use multiple physical databases. The BMC CMDB architecture also enables you to incorporate data from external data stores and present it as part of a single, logical CMDB. So if you have software and data repositories that have useful data and are working for you today as a source of truth, great. Keep them there. You might have personnel or asset data maintained by your ERP system, or in your active directory system, or perhaps another asset management system. You may have geographies or business units that need to be accountable for maintaining IT data for their own areas. Or you have have specialists such as network managers using specialized tools to maintain data unique to their needs but with overlaps into what you need to manage from an asset standpoint. You can see this data through a database of objects with pointers to these master data sources. Object Pointers (logical) ERP Active Directory Geos, BUs CI Type 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n19 Configuration Item Level\n\nThe degree of detail selected to describe a unique entity Multiple CIs? Single CI? Too much granularity = to difficult to maintain Too little granularity = low usage levels 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n20 Final scoping objective\n\nThe scope of the Infrastructure to be covered by the CMDB The range of responsibility covered by Configuration Management as defined by the Infrastructure: Hardware Software Telecommunications People Documentation Etc. There limiting factors that may affect the final scoping of your CMDB typically these will include: Cost / Time Practicality Business Practices Ownership/ Geography IT structure Etc. Only you can determine your CMDB final scoping 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n21 Importance of Automated Discovery\n\nDiscovery is critical to the success of any CMDB implementation: Complexity of the infrastructure environment Infrastructure heterogeneity Business functions and services are no longer monolithic applications hosted on single server “The only constant about IT assets is change. Configurations, users, relationships to multiple business services, even ownership of IT assets can change on a daily basis in an enterprise making it impossible to manually update and maintain the level of accuracy needed of a CMDB that is central to all IT processes. Maintaining the accuracy of the CMDB requires discovery techniques that are comprehensive and automated.” *CMDB: Building the Fountain of Truth through Automated Discovery, 2006 Ptak, Noel & Associates 16/04/2017 ©2005 BMC Software\n\n22 BMC® Discovery – What it does\n\nAutomated Discovery: The first step toward BSM Success Foundation Discovery Configuration Topology Identity Foundation Assets: What is the accurate inventory of deployed assets?
