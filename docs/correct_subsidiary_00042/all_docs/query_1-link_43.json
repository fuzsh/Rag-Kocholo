        "text": "BMC ACQUIRES NUMARA,\n\nBMC announced its acquisition of Numara Software, signaling its intent to enter the mid-market segment and offer SaaS and IT management solutions for Global 100 to small and medium businesses.\n\nOn Jan 30, BMC announced a definitive agreement to acquire Numara Software.\n\nBut first, a historical flashback:\n\nBack in 2004, BMC acquired Magic Solutions’ help desk management software (to enter — that’s right! — into the mid-market segment) and renamed it as its own BMC service desk express suite. For Magic customers, the costs went up, even as the ship went down.\n\nACQUISITION COSTS PAID BY CUSTOMERS\n\nMarimba followed in the wake of Magic. Its configuration management software was integrated into BMC’s Remedy line of customer support and network management software. BMC buried the Marimba name shortly thereafter.\n\nFast-forward to 2012 and watch History Repeat Itself on the BMC channel!\n\nSequels are so predictable. Numara products will become more and more expensive as BMC tries to recoup the acquisition costs from its newly expanded customer base. In the not-too distant future, Numara customers will be finding the price increases nudging them towards the more complicated BMC Service Management (Remedy) solution — which may or may not provide the service they need, at the price they want to pay.\n\nThere is another way…\n\nGET ON BOARD WITH SERVICEDESK PLUS AND PAY NOTHING FOR THE FIRST YEAR.\n\nTrade in your Numara Proof of Purchase and get an equivalent ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus annual license for free*. Yes, you read it right, absolutely free with no hidden catch.\n\nKnow more | Trade in your Numara Proof of Purchase here |\n\nYou can also email your proof of Purchase to swap@manageengine.com\n\nSwitch before it is too late.\n\n*Numara is a registered trademark of Numara Software, Inc. All other product and company names mentioned herein may be the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nArvind Parthiban\n\nServiceDesk Plus Team"
