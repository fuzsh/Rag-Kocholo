        "text": "Memo to the Board: On July 11, Microsoft disclosed that a group of Chinese hackers had broken into some of its customers' email systems to gather intelligence. The hackers, who Microsoft identified as Storm-0558, were able to gain access to the accounts of government agencies and individuals in the United States and Europe. The hackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's cloud email service to gain access to the accounts. They were then able to use stolen credentials to access other accounts. They stole a significant amount of data, including emails, documents, and other sensitive information. Microsoft has since patched the vulnerability and blocked the hackers' access to the affected accounts. However, the full extent of the damage is still either unknown, or undeclared. While corporate boards around the world wonder at Microsoft’s keen ability to block access AFTER the breach, they would be smart to put a couple of things in place to get ready for the next one. Start with education. Board members need at least a basic level of cyber literacy. Oversight committees are redundant. You already have a CISO. S/he doesn’t need oversight. S/he needs to know you understand the issues. Address and approve whatever the costs are to bring the company’s cybersecurity defense to a level that correlates to the risk tradeoffs for the business. Just do it. You’ll want to make sure your CISO has a serious cyber response protocol in place that has been thoroughly rehearsed, roles established and incident scenarios table-topped and weaknesses remedied. You need a post-breach protocol that identifies messaging, positioning, sequencing, inside and outside counsel identified, and a comms team in place with clarity. Identify your weakest and most vulnerable systems and isolate their key assets within a protect surface on the network – learn the fundamentals of Zero Trust and implement them quickly for your VIP systems and assets. Hire a competent cybersecurity 3rd party to audit and assess exposures – a Mandiant would work – and couple them and their findings with a cybersecurity insurance broker and a managed services incident response firm like an Arete IR to retain for support to your internal protocols post-attack. It becomes your vault policy so that you have maximum protection from screwing up your response. If recent Microsoft failures, DNS hacks, massive supply chain breaches like MOVEit aren’t sufficient evidence that the world is on fire, I don’t know to what you’ve been paying attention but it is no longer a remote and distant threat and it WILL happen to you. All future board meetings should be addressing the topic as a regular agenda item and your CISO needs complete authority to perform the job s/he’s being paid to do. If s/he’s the wrong CISO, get a new one. But the time to act is now. All of us need to get smarter. https://cybered.io/ The Future. Now."
