        "text": "When I first read Eric Jackson's post Wednesday on FORBES entitled, \"Sheryl Sandberg is the Valley's It Girl - Just Like Kim Polese Once Was,\" my immediate thought was - how sad. How sad that as an industry and a society we haven't advanced over these past two decades when it comes to views on women and leadership.\n\nAs with all the past lazy, stereotype-ridden articles like this one, it gets the facts wrong. For example, writing about Marimba, the software company I co-founded and led as CEO, Jackson states that \"after the bubble burst the company had no future and sold for twice its venture capital raised to BMC.\"\n\nActually, after the bubble burst, Marimba weathered the storm far better than most because we had superior products and an enviable customer base of Fortune 500 companies. As a result, in 2004 Marimba was sold to BMC for $239 million - nearly 15 times its venture capital raised (see CNET, \"BMC Snaps Up Marimba\"). Making that kind of return on capital is a home run. What's more, Marimba was a pioneer in the now multi-billion dollar Internet systems management market and Marimba's technology continues to be a core part of BMC's product portfolio to this day.\n\nIt's a matter of public record that Marimba was a success - but the author never bothered to check the facts. As CEO, I led Marimba from zero to nearly $50 million in annual revenue, achieved profitability, took the company public, and we ultimately had a very successful acquisition by one of the industry's largest software companies for nearly a quarter of a billion dollars.\n\nThe only way all this could have happened is that I, like any good CEO -- woman or man -- focused my time on making sure that our customers were successful and executing on all business metrics, while building and leading a highly talented team and a company that was a pioneer in Internet-based software management.\n\nBut the facts apparently aren't relevant, because some people are still stuck in old stereotypes. So despite the clear facts, they push the story -- once again, for the thousandth time -- that it was all a bunch of PR hype, I was just along for the ride, and eventually I got my comeuppance.\n\nAnd now they're trying to attach the same cliches to Sheryl.\n\nThe vacuous premise of Jackson's article (now taken down and replaced with an apology) -- that Sheryl is now in danger of falling into the same trap I supposedly did as CEO, neglecting the internal operations of the company in favor of focusing excessively on the \"external stuff\" -- would be laughable if it weren't so dangerous. Views like these are all too commonplace, and part of a pervasive pattern that belittles, demeans and marginalizes women as leaders.\n\nAs COO of Facebook, Sheryl is behaving no differently from her male peers when it comes to choosing how to divide her time internally vs. externally -- meeting with customers and investors, building partnerships and communicating about the company-- just as I did as CEO of Marimba. When we give speeches or interviews, we talk about our companies, our customers, the impact of technology and the Internet, and similar topics. We focus attention on our companies, not ourselves. We don't spend more time with the press or doing public speaking than our male counterparts.\n\nWe often receive extra attention as female executives in the technology industry because there are so few of us. However, we don't have any choice about what the press actually writes or what the layout looks like or the photos that are published. In other words, we behave just like our male counterparts do -- we just do our job. We can't control how the outside world reacts to us.\n\nIn the past I've remained silent about articles like this, believing that if I just stayed focused on delivering results and continued executing successfully, then the facts would stand on their own, and as more women entered the technology industry, these sadly misinformed stereotype-laden views would eventually die out once and for all.\n\nHowever, apparently the idiocy lives on, and now it's being recycled for a new wave of female leaders. And I'm not going to stand for that. Sheryl is succeeding because she has been delivering successfully. Period.\n\nToday only 3.6% of Fortune 500 companies are led by women. And when it comes to the future of women in computing, the numbers are in an alarming downward spiral. The number of women in the U.S. graduating with computer science college degrees has declined from 37% in 1984, to less than 12% today. As a country we need to be doing a much better job encouraging women to enter the computer industry, and become leaders.\n\nThis nation's innovation capacity and economic future depends on attracting the best and brightest from BOTH sexes and encouraging them to be leaders. Antiquated views about women like those perpetuated in the FORBES article do the opposite.\n\nIf women can't be judged fairly and objectively by their merits here in Silicon Valley -- often cited as the ultimate meritocracy -- then this exciting place where we're inventing the future every day is still stuck in the 19th century when it comes to views on women and leadership.\n\nKim Polese is a prominent Silicon Valley entrepreneur, innovator and business leader. As the founding product manager of Java, she led its launch in 1995, and went on to co-found and serve as CEO of Marimba Inc. which pioneered Internet-based software management. Ms. Polese is a leading voice in advocating public policy to increase America's innovation capacity. She currently serves as an advisor, board member and investor, helping to found and scale a new generation of startup companies."
