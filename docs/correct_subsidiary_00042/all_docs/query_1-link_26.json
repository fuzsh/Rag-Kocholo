        "text": "BMC CM (formerly known as Marimba) is currently in version 7.02.\n\nI love the tool because it is so customizable.\n\nWith the new patch tool that is capable of distributing to windows, aix, hp-ux, and solaris this tool has come a long way.\n\nThe latest features are sometime buggy durring a version change but who as a software vendor doesn't have a few bugs when releaseing new code into a customized environment as complex as networks today.\n\nAll in all the Software distrubution software from version 6 forward is very stable. This product does add AD schema objects ... but they are registered with \\microsoft and it doesn't modify any objects other than its, own.\n\nThe Report Center builder tool is not the best but the avaliablity of direct sql reports in the interface makes up for the default tool.\n\nthe scan engine is very lightweight... I accedently launched a scan on an exeutives laptop over a wan connect accross a wireless card durring a Powerpoint Presentation and he didn't even know he had been deployed to.\n\njust my 2 cents\n\nchris\n\nIt's hard to tell what the true Root Cause of problems are in a Corporate Technology Environmnet. You never know if it's something to do with AD, DNS, Group Policy, or BMC Marimba. An example of my experience today was to connect to a remote PC tuner and wait for 60 seconds while it established the connection. Then sort installed packages by either Alphabetical or Date Installed so I can find the one I am looking to replace. Don't know why they don't sort using one of those 2 methods by Default. I subscribe to my new Package and must disconnect so it can correctly refresh itself. Why can't it simply refresh itself as expected??? For some reason Disconnect takes 60 seconds. Then reconnect (another 60 seconds). I see my package is subscribed so I choose to install it. ... Nothing happens. I refresh. Nothing happens. Then I remember that sometimes I must disconnect from the Remote Tuner and reconnect for it to actually refresh itself. Why why why? And of course each disconnect and reconnect to remote tuner is slow. Finally, I see my new software package has successfully installed and removed the old one. Everything on my part worked fine, but BMC Marimba sure made it as difficult as possible. I'm not sure if other products are better, but I could not imagine them being much worse."
