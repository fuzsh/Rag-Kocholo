        "text": "Enterprise management software provider BMC Software has introduced a new global partner program which unifies separate programs following its acquisitions of Remedy, Marimba, Magic and Calendra.\n\nThe BMC Partner Network program allows partners to map their business practices to eight ‘routes to value’ or RTVs, according to BMC.\n\nThese RTVs include infrastructure and application management, service impact and event management, service level management, capacity management and provisioning, change and configuration management, asset management and discovery, incident and problem management and identity management, the company said.\n\nThere are Premier, Advanced and Fulfilment partner tiers under the program which annual sales targets attached to each one, said Mike Davis, sales director, north territory at BMC Software.\n\nPremier partners required one or two BMC-certified staff, depending on which RTV they are following and would generally do $500,000 or more in BMC software sales per annum.\n\nAdvanced partners would be required to do between $250,000 and $499,000 in annual BMC sales. Targets for both levels were relative to the reseller territory and the RTV, Davis said.\n\nFulfilment partners are those that participate in the sales process but BMC closes the deal, he said. These partners receive a commission for the work that they do on a project.\n\nUnder the program, BMC would also be providing business development funds for partners that would equate to about 2.5 percent of their sales, he said. These funds would be used for business development activities.\n\nThe Partner Network would be rolled out on 1 April. For more information, visit www.bmc.com/partners."
