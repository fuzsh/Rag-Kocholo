        "text": "Over the years, as India's software reputation gradually got enhanced, more\n\nand more global IT majors started having their offshore development centers (ODC)\n\nhere. If the first phase of their passage to India involved setting up sales\n\noffices to tap the potential of the large domestic market, the second phase\n\nheralded the establishment of these development centers-an unstinted\n\nacknowledgement of the software expertise available in the country. While many\n\nof the organizations involved in product development (software or hardware)\n\nopted for their R&D centers here, even software services players set up ODCs\n\nto fully leverage on the benefits of cost arbitrage.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIf Bangalore and Hyderabad were the popular choices for these\n\ndevelopment centers in the initial stages, last few years have also witnessed\n\nPune emerging as a viable destination for this purpose. Reasons are not far to\n\nsee: strategically, Pune offers a significant base of skilled manpower; a\n\nplethora of small innovative companies existing for many years had created an\n\necosystem for research excellence, and, inversely, the saturation of Bangalore\n\nin housing large development centers. Dataquest takes a snapshot of three such\n\nMNCs, globally significant in sizes, which have their R&D and ODC bases in\n\nPune.\n\nBMC Software: Pune Makes Magic\n\nThe Pune center might be only one of the 11 ODCs across the\n\nworld for this Houston-based $1.46 business service management software\n\nprovider, but it accounted for nearly two-thirds of its total R&D initiative\n\nglobally. In fact, during 2004-05, the company announced further investment of\n\n$5.5 mn for expansion of its Pune operations. This was primarily utilized to\n\nmake the Pune center the global R&D hub for its Magic Solutions division,\n\nacquired from Network Associates (now, McAfee) in February 2004. Magic is now\n\npart of BMC's Remedy software line of business and provides help desk software\n\nand related solutions targeted at small- to mid-sized organizations. More than\n\n80% of R&D resources for Magic Solutions is now being managed from the Pune\n\ndevelopment center.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the center is not involved\n\nin R&D on other BMC solutions beyond Magic. Many of the component\n\nengineering for SmartDBA in entirety is done out of here; it handles the\n\nsoftware configuration management and delivers patches for Marimba; it also\n\ndevelops the action requirement systems for all verticals on Remedy Classic; and\n\nlast but not the least, it is working on development of different enterprise\n\napplications for Patrol Enterprise Manager.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEncouraged by the quantum and quality of work delivered by\n\nthis Pune center, BMC has now announced further expansion plans for India. Its\n\ntotal investments in Indian operations are expected to reach $12mn by the\n\nbeginning of 2006. The company also plans to substantially increase the number\n\nof staff at its Pune development center-from 650 to 1000-by end of next\n\nyear. It is even consolidating its operations in the city into one facility with\n\na capacity of over 1500 people. Meanwhile, it is also cooperating with Wipro and\n\nInfosys on security products. Under a formal agreement, Wipro offers system\n\nintegrator services on BMC solutions and resells BMC's Control-SA product\n\nsuite as part of their enterprise solution offerings.\n\nSays George Harrington, senior VP and CFO, \"Since the\n\nopening of our Pune center in 2001, we have witnessed tremendous growth. The\n\nPune center is BMC's fastest growing operation and is second to our Houston\n\noffice in terms of number of employees. In anticipation of continued growth, we\n\nhave committed to expanding the current facility so that we have enough space\n\nfor 1500 staff in the years ahead.\" Adds Dan Barnea, senior VP, Research\n\nand Development, \"R&D projects for the new SMS, Remedy, Magic and\n\nMarimba lines of business have also been initiated, with BMC India having more\n\nownership on most of the products. We started with core competencies in IT and\n\nR&D, and have subsequently expanded to other areas including corporate\n\ndevelopment, field support, business intelligence and customer support. We are\n\nnow firming up plans to establish some of our Human Resources and Finance back\n\noffice functions in Pune too.\"\n\nSymantec India: Snapping Up the Opportunity\n\nEven a few months back, Symantec, the world's fourth\n\nlargest software company, was not at all present in Pune but today it has the\n\nlargest presence in the city amongst all MNCs. This transformation has happened,\n\nthanks to the Symantec acquisition of Veritas, followed by that of Bindview.\n\nBoth Veritas and Bindview have significant presence in the city-in fact,\n\nfollowing a $50 mn investment in 2004-05, the Pune facility had become Veritas'\n\nlargest R&D center globally. The Veritas center currently employs about\n\n1,100 and accounts for about 20% of Symantec's development staff worldwide. In\n\naddition, Bindview, that focuses on compliance-related security has also come\n\ninto the Symantec fold with its 185 people development center in Pune.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThere was more international recognition for the Symantec/Veritas\n\nPune center in FY '05, as it was awarded a patent for FlashSnap, a product\n\nfeature, in Veritas Storage Foundation. However, such recognition is nothing new\n\nfor this now Symantec facility that was started in the city way back in 1991.\n\nThe Pune team has always been pretty active on the R&D front with more than\n\n40% of all patent disclosures coming from here. Even Symantec officials agree\n\nthat there is a disproportionate focus on IP here but add that low cost is not\n\nthe sole driving factor for expansion plans in the city. Instead it has always\n\nbeen access to talent and ability to hire, besides expertise in product\n\ndevelopment, that had encouraged the company to grow the team in Pune-a trend\n\nthat is now expected to continue in the Symantec regime.\n\nSome of the key areas the center has been involved in R&D\n\nactivity include storage management, data protection, application performance\n\nmanagement, and disaster recovery. Some of the products handled include Veritas\n\nStorageCentral, Veritas Backup Exec for Netware, Veritas Cluster Server\n\nQuickStart, Veritas Bare Metal Restore, Veritas File System, and Veritas\n\nFoundation Suite. Now under Symantec dispensation, the center, till now mainly\n\ninto product engineering, has been assigned to identify new products for the\n\ncompany's markets worldwide making it assume product management functions.\n\nAn upshot of the transformation of the Pune development\n\ncenter into a location for identifying new product opportunities is that\n\nengineering managers at the center are getting into business-facing roles. The\n\ncenter is exposing its senior engineers to field operations to ensure that they\n\ncan make the transition from technology innovation to product innovation.\n\n\"We want our engineers to do the market and business analysis,\" says a\n\nsenior company official. This year, the Pune center is experimenting with a\n\nnumber of ideas that may lead to new products. For example, it is looking at\n\noffering availability and performance products for customers using enterprise\n\nbusiness software from SAP and is working on this with Wipro, which has a large\n\nglobal SAP practice. The center is also looking at a product for the DR market.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nParametric Technologies (PTC): Carving out a Niche\n\nThough PTC, one of the global leaders in CAD/CAM and\n\nengineering software, has its India headquarter based out of Bangalore, the\n\nR&D center is located in Pune. With more than 500 people, the Pune center\n\nhoused at the recently developed Marisoft IT park is the company's single\n\nlargest location globally, bigger than the other development centers in the US\n\nand Israel. Providing software products for CAD, collaboration and data\n\nmanagement, PTC India has carved a niche for itself in the CAD/CAM/CAE and PLM\n\nmarkets.\n\nThe Product Development System at the center combines three\n\nflagship products namely Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire, Windchill ProjectLink and\n\nWindchill PDMLink. Since the acquisition of Computer Vision in 1998, the R&D\n\ncenter has been engaged in all stages of product development including design,\n\ndevelopment, integration, technical writing and localization to suit the Indian\n\nmarket. The largest facility outside the US, it has worked upon Pro/ENGINEER,\n\nWindchill, Pro/ INTRALINK, CADDS and Optegra. The center also offers product\n\nsupport to customers across the world.\n\nAsustosh Parasnis, who heads the Pune center informs that the\n\nIndian R&D team has been working on the recent versions of both Pro/ENGINEER\n\nand Windchill in collaboration with PTC's US-based R&D center. With\n\nalready more than 500 people, it plans to augment its sales and support staff by\n\n15% over the next three years. The PTC Indian subsidiary headquartered in\n\nBangalore earns substantial revenues from the domestic market, but wields no\n\ncontrol over the Pune center that reports directly to the US head office. Though\n\nthe Pune facility also houses a 40-man global call center, it does align with\n\nthe Indian sales team to provide occasional support to the domestic customers.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nR&D Hub of the Future\n\nThese three might be the most well-known companies that have\n\nset up their research and development bases in Pune, but the city also houses\n\nR&D centers of a plethora of companies-ranging from small outfits to\n\nmid-tier organizations. Though Pune also boasts of several ODCs for IT services\n\ncompanies, there is a significant difference in manpower required for software\n\ndevelopment work and research work. While software services work is largely seen\n\nas routine work, R&D needs technological creativity in a person. What this\n\nmeans is that an R&D professional needs to have an innovative bent of mind,\n\nwhich Pune has been able to sufficiently supply. According to experts, the city\n\nthat is already home to a strong automobile and engineering industry, promises\n\nto become fertile ground for IT organizations too for research work. While the\n\ncity in the past was called the 'pensioner's paradise,' the current\n\nR&D invasion can change this to 'R&D hub of the future.'"
