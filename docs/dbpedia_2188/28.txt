Ella Fitzgerald recorded this swinging Christmas album for Verve in 1960. The jazz queen interprets classic secular Christmas songs in a variety of moods, from the joyous and upbeat 'Santa Claus Is Coming To Town' to the wistful 'What Are You Doing New Year's Eve' and the cheeky 'Frosty The Snowman'. A studio orchestra, arranged and conducted by Frank DeVol, skilfully accompanies the singer. Warm-hearted and without excessive kitsch, a perfect recording for the most atmospheric time of the year.

This title is an SHM SACD. This format is the further development of the single-layer SACD and uses a particularly light-transparent plastic (Super High Material). It allows a much better readability of the pit-land structures on the surface than is possible with hybrid SACDs. Universal's SHM SACDs are generally re-digitized to DSD from the albums' master tapes without any changes. SHM SACDs can be played on any SACD player. Please do not use L'Art du Son or alcohol-based cleaning agents. - Please note: All titles are designed by Universal Music as limited edition collector's items for the Japanese market.
