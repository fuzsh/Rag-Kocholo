        "text": "One of my favorite holiday traditions occurs almost as soon as I emerge from my food coma on the day after Thanksgiving – listening to Ella Fitzgerald’s Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas in its entirety. If I’m not already in the Christmas spirit, I am by the end of side 1.\n\nThe 1960 release captures so many of the feelings that accompany the holiday, from the sheer exuberance of the full-tilt opening track, “Jingle Bells,” to the coquettish anticipation of “What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve.”\n\nElla brings a childlike sense of wonder to “Santa Claus is Coming to Town” and a touch of the blues to “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.”\n\nThe normally poignant “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is lively and upbeat. “Let it Snow” almost makes me wish it would. (Almost.)\n\nThis is the First Lady of Song at the height of her powers, and the record features everything she was known for – playful improvisation and scat vocals, flawless delivery, boundless energy. Backed by a studio orchestra, she brings credibility and freshness to songs that have a way of quickly becoming stale.\n\nThis is holiday jazz at its best.\n\nHomemade Eggnog\n\nThe ultimate Yuletide beverage. There are hundreds of recipes for eggnog, and mine remains a work in progress. I tweak it every year, and I’m not even sure where I found the original version.\n\nIt started off as a single serving, but the current recipe makes about two or three glasses, depending on the size of your glass and the generosity of your pour."
