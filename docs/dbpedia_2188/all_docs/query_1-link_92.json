        "text": "I have the 2006 EMI twofer (with Brighten The Corner) and can confirm that it was mastered by everyone's favorite engineer at Capitol, Bob Norberg. To my ears, it sounds fine, but it won't knock your socks off or anything.\n\nIf the name Bob Norberg is a red flag or hot button buzzword for you then you might find issues with this edition.\n\nIncidentally, I used to own the 2000 Capitol remaster but sold it when I \"upgraded\" to the 2006 twofer. I didn't know any better at the time. Now I'm wondering if I actually downgraded, sonically speaking.\n\nThe second album, Brighten The Corner, is nice if you like hymns and spirituals done southern style with minimal backing and a vocal chorus supporting Ella's lead. In fact, it's quite similar to Elvis' How Great Thou Art or His Hand In Mine. If those albums move you, this one will, too.\n\nIMHO, Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas and Brighten The Corner make for a cohesive listening experience. Together, they create a 100% religious music program nearly 70 minutes long. I think the real draw here, though, is the Christmas album. Since Ella Wishes You A Singing Christmas was almost all secular, the sacred Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas proves a worthy counterpart."
