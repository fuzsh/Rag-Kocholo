        "text": "The Peggy Lee Bio-Discography:\n\nThe Capitol Years, Part I (1944-1945)\n\nby Iván Santiago\n\nPRELIMINARY NOTES\n\nThe Peggy Lee Look\n\nImages above: A photographic showcase of Peggy Lee in her mid-twenties, when she made the recordings that will be itemized in this page. The first shot was taken in February of 1943 -- just a few weeks before Lee married guitarist Dave Barbour. Around that time, she also gave bandleader Benny Goodman notice of her intention to leave the canary post that she had been holding since mid-August of 1941. The other photos capture Lee with her baby daughter Nicki, born in November of 1943. Both shots are undated, but very likely to have been taken within the two years with which this discographical page is concerned.\n\nImages below: early Capitol publicity shots of Peggy Lee, dating from a time when she still qualified as one of the newest additions to its roster. I believe them to date from 1945, although they are more commonly seen in publications from subsequent years.\n\nThe first photo below bears what looks like an approximate dating at Getty Images (January 1, 1944), while the second can sometimes be found with a 1946 date stamped on its back. (I have actually come across it in July and October 1946 magazines issues.) I believe all those 1944 and 1946 dates to be off the mark by about a year. Several other photos on which Lee wears this same dress are extant; those carry an October 22, 1945 date on their backs. (I hasten to clarify that they are not from the same photo session that generated these publicity shots, though.)\n\nThe last picture graced the front covers of two magazines, one published in October of 1945, the other in February of 1947. Over the ensuing years, numerous additional uses have been found for this particular photograph, which must rank as Lee's most disseminated image from her first period as a Capitol artist (1944-1952).\n\nPeggy Lee's Recording Career, 1940-1945\n\nThis page chronicles a transitional period in Peggy Lee's professional career. During the years that preceded the transition (1941-1943), Lee had gained nationwide recognition as a big band vocalist -- one under the hire of a famous leader, and amidst the company of a popular top orchestra. Within the years to be explored herein (1944-1945), Lee's incursions into the recording studio would place her in many another musical context: singer-songwriter, featured vocalist with a jazz ensemble, hired hand for the promotion of film music, record label artist. Although such incursions were sporadic, most of them proved successful enough to recast her in the public eye. No longer deemed a big band canary, contemporary music listeners would now come to think of Lee as the public face of a married musical duo, and as a talented female whose songful capabilities extended to the writing of lyrics. More importantly, it would be during this mid-1940s period that her life-long renown as a solo singer would begin.\n\nTransition and variety were nothing new in Peggy Lee's music career, however: she had a working history that dated back to the mid-1930s, and which had found her hopping from town to town at first, from state to state afterwards. To further clarify her professional trajectory at the time on which this page will focus (1944-1945), it is worth taking a brief, schematic look into Lee's work history during the preceding years.\n\nAt the outset of the 1940s, we find Lee making some strategic job transitions, all of them calculated to advance her singing career. The vocalist had begun the decade entertaining a primarily college-aged audience at The Powers Hotel's Coffee Shop in Fargo, North Dakota, where her musical accompaniment had been circumscribed to an organist. Though considered a local success, the young vocalist had already set higher professional aspirations for herself, and a change of scenery was necessary for the fulfillment of such aspirations. The solo gig at the coffee shop was thus followed by work with two bands (the first regionally known, the second nationally recognized) in the larger cities of Minneapolis and St. Louis. Right after her time with those bands, the ambitious singer moved to Hollywood, where she undertook nightclub work both as a solo act and in a joint bill with a music trio. (This discography's pre-recording page offers detailed coverage of all such steps of Lee's professional career, further going back into the trips and jobs that she took on during the 1930s.)\n\nAt last, in mid-August of 1941, the enterprising vocalist hit the big time. Lee became the canary for The Benny Goodman Orchestra, one of the top bands in the music business. Working with an ensemble of such caliber actually meant not only higher expectations but also further, constant moving around. After performing with Goodman for the second half of a month-long engagement in Chicago, the canary proceeded to do constant traveling with the orchestra for the remainder of the year, along with all of the next one. Stops of varying duration were made in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and many another state.\n\nHer transient lifestyle came to a halt in late February of 1943, when the band stayed within the Hollywood area for a six-week-long engagement. In March, Peggy Lee married Dave Barbour (Goodman's guitarist) and gave Benny Goodman notice of her intention to leave the ensemble. (Barbour had been fired weeks earlier). Whether by personal design or at Goodman's request, for the next three months (or so) she still kept fulfilling canary duties, on and off. But, by June, Lee was about three months pregnant, and at that time her intention to stay home was conveyed to the press. Through the second half of the year, Mrs. Barbour gladly took on the role of housewife and considered herself retired from the singing profession. Away from the daily travails of touring with and performing for a big band, the newlywed gladly envisioned a future in which she would stay at home permanently, doing domestic chores, tending to her husband, and raising children. (Lee's autobiography and her press interviews are the sources for this statement.) Then, in November of 1943, Mrs. Barbour delivered a baby by Caesarean section. After this difficult childbirth, the new mom learned that she could not have more children.\n\nIn January of 1944, Peggy Lee Barbour was lured back into the recording studio, this time as a guest vocalist with a jazz ensemble. The Barbours' financial needs factored heavily in her eventual acceptance of the initially declined offer, which what was expected to be an one-time-only return to the recording studio. However, the commercial and critical success of the resulting records brought to Lee quite a few additional offers to not only continue to record but also appear in concerts and on the radio. Some of those offers were fully declined, while others were accepted, with the common understanding that she would be performing only on a non-permanent, every-once-in-a-while basis.\n\nBut such a frame of mind did not last for long. Any lingering plans of retirement were fully abandoned when Lee decided to sign contracts with a record label (Capitol) and a booking agency (General Artists). A momentous event in the artist's career, the signings took place in late 1944. The exact month of the signing is unknown, and so is the duration of the contract, but December of 1944 and a four year-period are good possibilities. An one-year duration with subsequent renewal is another possibility. The basis for my proposal of both possibilities is some information gathered from the June 1946 issue of Variety. The periodical revealed the closing date for various Capitol contracts that were active at the time: \"Stan Kenton is bound until December, 1947; King Cole Trio, November, 1946; Alvino Rey, December, 1947; Paul Weston, December, 1947; Peggy Lee, December, 1948; Pied Pipers, February, 1947; Tex Ritter, November, 1946; Andy Russell, March, 1949; Jo Stafford, October, 1947; Margaret Whiting, December, 1948; Dinning Sisters, May, 1950.\"\n\nBeginning in December of 1944 and moving into the next year, a few record dates ensued, along with concert and radio appearances that are documented in other pages of this discography. It must be re-stated, however, that there was no dramatic spurt in recording activity during the period under discussion: the vocalist did not really begin to record in earnest until 1946. The relatively slow process might have been due, at least in part, to the need to raise her baby. Lee's comeback from her short period of retirement was thus a gradual albeit steady one.\n\nSuggestions, Recommendations, And Technicalities\n\nFor more details about Peggy Lee's incorporation to Capitol's roster of recording artists, consult the notes at the end of the page. The same notes offer an itemization of this page's 14 masters and specifics about the singer's rankings in music polls from the years 1944 and 1945. Viewers looking for CD recommendations should pay attention to items whose titles are typed in uppercase and boldface. For instance, my choice of font and case for the following title is meant to indicate its desirability over other comparable options: THE EARLY YEARS (CAPITOL COLLECTORS SERIES, VOLUME 1). In addition, you may want to consult this page (section I). My recommendations are based on sound quality and/or rarity of the tracks included. Note also that, under each song, the listing of releases has been arranged chronologically, by year of release. Similarly worthy of glossing are the blue arrowheads which can be periodically found through the page. Click on them if you want to see a full list of issues -- LPs, CDs, etc. -- containing any given Peggy Lee performance. (I have aimed at listing every single issue in existence, with the following exceptions: various-artists compilations, foreign editions of domestic issues, and digital file. The first two categories are covered separately, within the miscellaneous section of this bio-discography. As for digital file -- MP3, MP4, AAC, etc. -- I have chosen to make very limited mention of such a format in my work. As it stands nowadays, it is a non-physical configuration with all-too poor documentation history, and also of ephemeral duration.)\n\nGENERAL NOTES (CURRENTLY UNDER RECONSTRUCTION)\n\nThe Emergence of Capitol Records / Peggy Lee's Path Toward A Capitol Recording Contract\n\nPeggy Lee In Transition (1943-1944)\n\nThe time span covered by this discographical page constitutes a period of transition in Peggy Lee's evolution as a recording star. These two years (1944-1945) followed her days as Benny Goodman's canary (August 1941 - ca. June 1943) and preceded her full-time commitment to a career as a solo act.\n\nThe preceding year can also be deemed a part of the transition. Both personally and professionally, 1943 had been an eventful year for Lee. In March, she had married guitarist Dave Barbour and informed The Benny Goodman Orchestra that she intended to leave the band. A few months later (ca. June 1943), the artist formally announced her intention to entirely retire from professional singing and dedicate herself to housewife duties. Next, in November 1943, she gave birth by Caesarean section. The delivery was a difficult one that put Lee's own life at risk. A hysterectomy made it impossible for her to ever conceive more children.\n\nDuring that second half of 1943, the newlywed and retiree might have not done much (if any) professional singing, but the memory of her voice still lingered on. She had left the music industry while riding high on the success of her version of \"Why Don't You Do Right?\", which would remain in currency for many months afterwards. Although Peggy Lee and The Benny Goodman Orchestra had recorded this number way back in time (July 1942), Columbia would not release Lee's version of this song until the very end of the year 1942. \"Why Don't You Do Right?\" began to climb the charts in January of 1943, and went on to spend nearly five months inside Billboard's Top 30.\n\nHalfway through the year, as its chart popularity was winding down, Lee's vocal gained renewed attention. The renewal in popularity happened because when she and the orchestra were seen performing the number in the movie Stage Door Canteen. Having debuted in June of 1943, that film would prove very popular with audiences over the next few months.\n\nOn the strength of that hit recording and film appearance, Peggy Lee received various movie and record offers in 1943. She declined all of them. Lee was actually pregnant at the time. Although she was dedicating some of her spare time to the hobby of writing songs, Norma Deloris Barbour envisioned herself as fully retired from the business of singing. She foresaw a wife's and mother's life ahead of her.\n\nIn January of 1944, less than two months after the birth of her baby, various factors coaxed Mrs. Dave Barbour back into the recording studio. One of those factors was the couple's financial needs. Lee explained in her autobiography that, once the married couple had made the decision to settle in LA, \"David had to get a California union card. He could earn only a pittance until he played in LA [for] a certain period of time.\" Barbour himself insisted that his wife's retirement was an unwise decision, arguing that Lee's talents should not go to waste, and that she was bound to regret her decision later in life. In her autobiography, the singer also intimated that her husband's insistence might have been partially triggered by Carlos Gastel, a notable artists' manager who was one of Barbour's drinking buddies. Elsewhere, she added that Gastel directly and persistently approached her with offers.\n\nThe singer ended up accepting offers for occasional, no-strings-attached vocal work. Producer and music critic Dave Dexter, Jr. made the first of the accepted offers. On January 7, 1944, Lee recorded two sides with The Capitol Jazzmen, a group that Dexter had put together for the purpose of studio recording. (Two months earlier, the producer had also hired Barbour as guitarist for a similar date.) The sides (those featuring Lee and also the ones featuring Barbour) were made for a record company that was, back then, in its infancy.\n\nPhotos\n\nAbove: The Barbours (Dave, Peggy, and Nicki) in three shots from 1945. The third seems to be the earliest: an April 1945 date is handwritten on its back. According to the stock photo agency Getty Images, the second dates from November 3. The first was taken at the December 26 Capitol recording session that has already been discussed. During this digital area, the third shot has enjoyed frequent reproduction. (For commentary about the images immediately below, see next Photo sub-section.)\n\nA Budding History - Capitol Records (1942-1944)\n\nOfficially incorporated on April 9, 1942, Capitol Records would become a big record company within a short time span. It would also remain, for many years, the only major label in the West Coast. (Back then, the respective headquarters of Columbia, Decca, and RCA Victor were in the Big Apple.)\n\nThe initial steps toward the formation of this novel company had been jointly undertaken by Glenn Wallichs (owner of the Music City record store at 1501 N. Vine Street, and essentially the label's executive president, although over the years he went through various titles, beginning with that of vice-president), Johnny Mercer (a well-known songwriter, who would serve not only as the nominal president but also, during the company's early days, as de facto A&R man), and Buddy DeSylva (then a vice-president and production head at Paramount Pictures as well as a well-known songwriter, whose prestige and wealth gave hefty support to the company in its early years, and who would eventually be named its first chairman of the board). Wallichs had also had previous experience (1938) as the co-owner of a small recording studio facility, primarily dedicated to the making of transcriptions of radio broadcasts.\n\nPeggy Lee reminisces in her autobiography that \"those fellows were conducting business upstairs over Sy's tailor shop on Vine, just below Sunset.\" Capitol's executive offices would remain circumscribed to that specific location until 1947, when they would be expanded to take up the entire second floor of Wallichs' music store. At that time, Wallichs himself would take over the title of company president, while the contributions of Mercer and DeSylva would begin to dwindle. In an interview conducted by Fred Hall, Peggy Lee gave pointed praise to both Wallichs and Mercer: \"dear Glenn was really -- I compare him in my mind a bit to Walt Disney. He had the same leadership quality. Such great character and enthusiasm ... Glenn really was the man [at the top of Capitol], and of course Johnny always contributed in so many ways -- artistically of course, and creatively in his own writing, as well as helping others.\" On the occasion of the company's 50th anniversary (1992), she was moreover quoted as follows: \"I hope Capitol never loses the soul of its founders, those such as Glenn Wallichs, Johnny Mercer, Buddy DeSylva, Jim Conkling, Dave Cavanaugh, Alan Livingston and many wonderful men and women who followed. They truly had the interest of the artist at heart.\"\n\nThe label did well during this founding period, showing year-to-year increase in both its financial grosses and production output. By 1944, it had become a solid, uncontested industry success. From its early roster of recording artists, the best-selling act had been Johnny Mercer himself, thanks to the top-ten renditions of his own songs that charted on each of the label's first three years (and beyond, actually). The very first heavy hitter (July 1942) had been Freddie Slack And His Orchestra with Ella Mae Morse, thanks to a rendition of \"Cow Cow Boogie\" that had brought national attention to the label. Stan Kenton (\"And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine,\" \"Eager Beaver,\" both on 1943) and The Nat King Cole (\"All For You,\" 1943) take pride of position amidst about a dozen Capitol artists whose popularity was on the ascent when Peggy Lee did her first date for the label, on January 7, 1944.\n\n{Referential Note. I have dedicated a full separate page to an exploration of Capitol's earliest years. The above-seen paragraphs qualify as a condensation of that page. Also worth bearing in mind: the ensuing session pages of this discography contain endnotes which discuss not only Lee's career but also the history of Capitol Records between the years 1945 and 1952.}\n\nPhotos\n\nThe six above-seen pictures showcase some of Capitol's early spaces. Not seen herein is, however, the earliest of such spaces, known as The Chateau. During the months that preceded the opening of the label's first executive office, Capitol's posse is said to have held fort inside a location bearing that name. The \"fort\" in question could have been the Chateau Marmont Hotel, at 8221 Sunset Boulevard. Unfortunately, I have yet to find any further specifics on the matter.\n\nFirst of the six photos: Capitol founders Johnny Mercer, Glenn Wallichs, and Buddy DeSylva inside their first executive office, on July 23, 1943. The office had opened for business on June 4, 1942. One decade later, in a special Billboard section commemorating the label's tenth anniversary, mention was made of an inaugural event of sorts, which presumably took place at this room late in May or early in June of 1942: we are told that Wallichs and sales manager Floyd Bittaker (the company's earliest hiree) \"carried a desk into a empty Vine Street store [room] and created the new company's home office.\"\n\nDescribed elsewhere as a 15-feet-wide and 50-feet-long floor space (originally without even air conditioner), the above-shown room would serve as one of two or three \"tiny\" offices set up atop Wallichs' record store Music City, which had itself opened a couple of years before (1940) on the northwest corner of Hollywood's Sunset and Vine. \"The offices were a laugh,\" opined Capitol singer Margaret Whiting in her autobiography. \"They consisted of two rooms in a building on Sunset and Vine. There was the front room, where Paul [Weston] worked on orchestrations, and a back room that Glen Wallichs and Johnny shared, where big decisions were made. Nine months after the beginning of Capitol's success, the offices remained the same. Then, one Monday I walked in ... and saw a lady sitting at Paul's desk [in other words, a secretary had just been hired] ... Now there were three people crowded into that one office [or back room]: Johnny, Glenn, and Paul Weston. Music paper was strewn over the desks ... The success was so immediate and so enormous that the men were too busy to move the offices to a larger space. Finally, when the office resembled the Mark Brothers copped up in a ship's closet, they moved ...\"\n\n[In the present page, I have circumscribed both images and information to this first office space, said to have been located at 1483 Vine Street. Before we move on to other photos, a caveat about the identification of this office space is in order. While I do believe that the above-shown executive office interior was the very first one used by Capitol Records, the possibility that it could instead be the label's second should not be discounted. We are dealing, after all, with sources that are partly anecdotal, and with information that is, by this point in time, fragmented. I should also point out, in advance, that a photo allegedly showing the entrance to the first office space has been provided further down below. Images of the second offices' exterior can also be found in this discography, though not on the present page. Check the end notes of the 1946-1947 page.]\n\nThe second photo shows another Capitol office room, in which the bulk of the label's 1944 female roster has been captured, along with a few prospective additions. Within this seven-person group, the three women sitting in the middle were the bigger Capitol stars at the time: from left to right, Martha Tilton, Margaret Whiting, and Jo Stafford. (There were, of course, other female Capitol artists who are not in this photo. Most notable among such missing songbirds would be Ella Mae Morse.) As for the other individuals in the picture, the first woman is Martha Tilton's sister Liz, also a singer. The second woman is Yvonne King and the very last one is Donna King, both members of the Capitol recording group The King Sisters. Finally, sitting next to last, there is Peggy Lee, then a newcomer to the label. This photo was published in the February 1945 issue of Capitol News, where its caption claims that the group was \"assembled last month.\" Meanwhile, at Gettyimages, the photo bears a December 31, 1944 date. Another published photo shows that Stan Kenton and Johnny Mercer were also among those in the premises on that particular day. It is possible that the occasion was an end-of-the-year or New Year Eve's party at Capitol offices.\n\nOutside views of the early Capitol offices are provided in the next couple of shots, whose exact dates are unknown but can be speculated. In the second shot, the Artistry In Rhythm sign points to late 1945 or -- more likely -- early 1946, because the release date for the album in question was December of 1945. (Incidentally, this rare photo made its web debut thanks to Capitol historian and graphic designer Mark Heimback-Nielsen, who featured it in his worthwhile blog about all things Capitol.) The first shot is suspected to come from much earlier, with 1943 and 1944 among the viable possibilities. (A larger, black & white version of this shot can be found in Reuel Golden and Barney Hoskyns' 2016 book release 75 Years Of Capitol Records.) The most notable differences between these shots include the type of lamppost visible on the left side of the street, as well as the nearby presence or absence of awnings.\n\nViewable only in the second of these two shots (i.e., the fourth photo above), the street entrance to Capitol's offices bore a 1483 North Vine Street address. For the benefit of viewers who might otherwise become confused, a lavender-indigo coloring has been manually applied to the door on the ground floor. The offices themselves were actually on the second floor, directly above the store of famous tailor Sy Devore and next to the studio of Gene Lester, the Hollywood photographer who was also well known for his steady relationship with the Saturday Evening Post. Engraved atop his store's own door, Sy Devore's name is dimly visible in this photo, too -- on the far left, right before what looks like yet another street lamppost. (For a picture of the entrance to Capitol's second offices, located to the North of the corner, see the General Notes at the bottom of this discography's 1946-1947 page. The transition from one office space to the other seems to have become finalized during the first half of 1947. As late as February 1, 1947, Billboard magazine was still listing the 1483 N. Vine address for Capitol Records -- but not so by May of the same year. And by 1949, the 1483 N. Vine Street address was being listed as belonging to the song publishing company Bourne, Inc.)\n\nAbove, continued: As a label without large facilities at this early point in its history, Capitol initially carried out all session work on rented space. The bottom-row pictures showcase the C. P. MacGregor Studio, which was Capitol's recording space of choice during the company's earliest years. The first of these shots immortalizes the Capitol Jazzmen's debut session, held there on November 16, 1943. Peggy Lee's husband Dave Barbour can be seen on the right side of the frame, sitting while playing his guitar. Also present are Billy May (trumpet), Dave Matthews (saxophone), Jimmie Noone (clarinet), Jack Teagarden (trombone), Art Shapiro (double bass), and Joe Sullivan (piano). The group seen in the remaining photo is Henry King And His Orchestra. This shot dates from 1940 and thus predates the foundation of Capitol Records. Still, it can helpfully supply the viewer with a general notion of the facility's dimensions. For various photos of Lee in this same room, skim through this page's sessions. And for more information about the C. P. MacGregor Studio -- as well as its additional connections to both Lee and King -- consult this page. (By January 1945, Capitol Records had almost fully moved out of MacGregor. Capitol's executives contended that the studio had become \"too live after a paint job for the walls,\" and that matters had not been significantly improved by the attempt at rectifying the situation though the installation of rock wool. For its part, MacGregor's publicity director counterattacked with the argument that Capitol had been monopolizing the studio to a detrimental degree. According to the publicist, the label's constant presence had been making it difficult to give \"proper time and attention\" to other enterprises of great importance, including \"Armed forces Radio Service shows, its own musical and dramatic transcription series and advertising agency accounts.\" As will be further covered in the General Notes of this discography's 1946-1947 page, Capitol made Radio Recorders its next studio of choice.)\n\nRight above: Published on July 11, 1942, here is one of the earliest Capitol trade ads. Along with the primeval roster of recording artists, it identifies the company's founders and their initial executive titles within the corporation. Placed by the Modern Music Sales Company (Capitol's initial record distributor in the New York area), this ad also lists the label's very first batch of releases, and the addresses of the executives offices. The Hollywood address was naturally the main one; Wallichs was said to have \"signed a lease for a large local office space\" during a visit to New York in late June of 1942. The 78-rpm singles were announced as available in the LA area by June 29, in the NY area by July the sixth.\n\nRight above, continued: The middle photo is a shot of the rarely seen Hollywood House Of Music, which called itself \"Hollywood's only complete recording center.\" The image might be showing the rear of the center or facility, which consisted of a record store on the first floor and a recording studio on the second floor. Since 1937, the studio was operated by the brothers Glenn and Clyde Wallichs, while the store had long belonged to Eleanor Roycroft and Al Jarvis, better known in his role of radio disc jockey. Glenn and Clyde Wallichs used the studio essentially as a custom-made service for Hollywood's radio industry: at the request of radio announcers and stars (e.g., Jack Benny, Bob Hope, et cetera), the Wallichs brothers made acetate recordings of audition discs and broadcasts on which the stars had made appearances. The small studio was also reconfigured at some point (perhaps around 1939) so that it could be used by Al Jarvis on a daily basis. The store owner and disc jockey made it the new site for his long-running, celebrated show, Make Believe Ballroom, which was transmitted through local radio station KFWB. In conjunction with his father (Oscar), Glenn Wallichs would go on to open the larger Music City at Sunset and Vine in 1940, where he also set up a small recording facility. Two years later, he would co-found Capitol Records, which did not have its own recording studios for the first six years (as already mentioned). It was still with Wallichs as a presiding member that Capitol Records acquired a large, multi-room studio facility in December 1948 or January 1949 (i.e., the Capitol Melrose studio).\n\nRight Below: the label's main record distribution branch and its staff in 1943. The address was 1453 North Vine, in Hollywood. The man at the extreme left is Floyd Bittaker, manager of Capitol Distributing Co., and a key figure at the label. By early 1945, Bittaker's had been named the company's National Sales Manager, and Capitol Distributing Co. had moved to headquarters which were reported to be three times as large, at 318 West 15th Street, Los Angeles 15. That new location offered the additional allure of being next to the distribution offices of two majors, Decca and Victor. (The next known location, the Palmer Building on 6362 Hollywood Boulevard, is briefly discussed in the endnotes of this discography's 1946-1947 page, under a section called Business Expansion.) At the extreme left is Dave Dexter Jr., who will be showcased in some of the photos further down this page. One of the above-seen female employees is Chiqui Gastel, sister of Artists' manager Carlos Gastel (who worked for Peggy Lee, among others). Also pictured here is Auriel Macfie, who served as Capitol's receptionist at the executive offices in 1942, and who hold the honor of having been the label's very first female employee. MacFie is the tall lady on the back row, leaning agains the wall space between two windows, fourth front left.\n\nThe other photo immediately below features Capitol's New York branch office along with its staff. It dates from 1943 as well. From left to right, the posing members of the staff include two unidentified ladies along with the branch's chief manager (Al Levine), the head of shipping (Al Silver), two sales officers (Leonard Smith, Les Walters), and the then-manager of national sales (Bob Stabler). A visiting Glenn Wallichs is at the extreme right. (In addition to the NY and LA distribution offices, Capitol had also opened one in Chicago, within its first year.)\n\nFurther down below: three vintage pictures, showcasing Capitol office space. The middle one allegedly captures the entrance to the label's very first office, at 1483 Vine Street. Note the sign, bearing the words \"for rent\" and, on the window, the reflection of buildings, along with at least one parked car. Another version of this photo can be seen in the very worthwhile blog that Mark Heimback Nielsen (aka PopCultureFanBoy) has created exclusively as an annal of Capitol Records' history. On this 2018 blog entry, Heimback Nielsen points out that the site \"is currently the entrance to the Bank of America parking structure.\"\n\nIn the case of the first of these three photos, specifics such as date and location are unknown to me, unfortunately. The space on sight is very likely to be a Capitol executive office on the second floor of Wallichs' Music City, but its time period is harder to pinpoint. If we may speculate, the mid-1940s strikes me as the most plausible dating.\n\nWe are on more solid ground when it comes to the third photo. It dates from November 19, 1943 or slightly later. Johnny Mercer and Glenn Wallichs are two of the trio who are said to be \"masterminding\" a Stan Kenton version of \"Eager Beaver.\" Kenton is indeed known to have recorded a version of \"Eager Beaver\" on that day, at the C. P. MacGregor Studios. Thheversion of \"Eager Beaver\" made its commercial debut on a Capitol 78-rpm single that came out in May of 1944.\n\nCommon to the first and the third photos is the presence of David E. Dexter, Jr. (1915-1990), the music writer and A&R man who brought Peggy Lee to Capitol Records in 1944 (after she had declined an earlier offer of his, in late 1943). A journalism major, Dexter had begun his professional career working for Billboard, as an anonymous local correspondent in his native Kansas City (mid 1936-1937). He then moved to Downbeat, for which he served as a reviewer and editor under various pseudonyms, first from Chicago, then from New York (1938-1942). Dexter would also put pen to paper at both Metronome and Music And Rhythm. He first ventured into the A&R world in November 1940, when he produced the sessions that Decca would later released on a 78-rpm album titled Kansas City Jazz, and which featured the likes of Count Basie and Mary Lou Williams, among others.\n\nIn early 1943, Capitol hired Dexter to fulfill multiple roles at the then-brand new label: advertisement & publicity chief, director of public relations, and assistant A&R man. In his capacity as publicity chief (and in line with his background as a music magazine writer), he founded, wrote and edited the noteworthy promotional magazine Capitol News, whose first issue bears a March 20, 1943 publication date. Dexter would remain with the label until 1975, having ever left it only once, merely for a few months. (Dexter's brief withdrawal took place during the second half of 1945, when he decided to change course and embark on a few activities that he expected to be reinvigorating, or personally rewarding. Those included Public Relations work for Stan Kenton in New York, freelancing and, especially, creating his own magazine. The latter turned out to be a short-lived enterprise, and he was soon working full time at Capitol.)\n\nAmong Dexter's other notable achievements at Capitol was the signing of several jazz-oriented artists, including Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Julia Lee, Peggy Lee, Nellie Lutcher, and Kay Starr. Along with Capitol founder Glenn Wallichs, he also had a hand in the hiring of both The Nat King Cole Trio and The Stan Kenton Orchestra. Furthermore, Dexter was the creator of the critically acclaimed History Of Jazz album series, brought to life in the 78 era and revived for various sequels during the LP era. But there was more.\n\nSuch 1940s credits notwithstanding, it was not until January of 1951 that his assistant A&R role was formally upgraded to full-time A&R man. (The upgrade was part of a Capitol overhaul at the executive level. It also meant that Dexter was permanently abandoning his on-hands involvement with Capitol News. The magazine was taken over by ad man Lou Schurrer and Variety writer John \"Bud\" Freeman, who renamed it Music News and revamped it into a less informative, more trivial publication.) Next, in early 1956, Dexter was named director of a newly conceived line, named Capitol Of The World. On behalf of that series, he travelled all over the globe, and went on to amass over 400 producer credits. Ten months after its inception, 75% of the albums released under the series had enjoyed sales above the $10,000 mark. Such success prompted to an expansion of Dexter' duties in the international division. In April of 1957, Capitol Of The World was re-categorized as a full division, rather than just a line, and Dexter was named its top manager. (The overall international division was still headed by long-time Capitol executive Sandor Porges, however.)\n\nBy the start of the 1960s, Dave Dexter ranked as the longest-lasting of all Capitol employees. It was at such point in time -- and on account of his involvement with the label's international activities -- that he infamously chose to not sign The Beatles to Capitol. (Although Beatles fandom has turned him into the poster child for this alleged error in judgment, other label executives were involved, and might have have conveniently absolved themselves from any \"blame.\"\n\nAs for his status as the longest-serving Capitol employee (1943-1975), Dexter's closest competition was Fred Rice, who joined Capitol in 1946 and eventually became manager of national sales. However, Rice's 1974 departure from the label meant that he fell short from Dexter's record.) Post-Capitol, Dexter became a frequently published freelance music writer. Eventually, in the 1980s, he would take a permanent job as Billboard's copy chief editor for the LA area.\n\nIn passing, mention should be made of Playback, the professional biography that Dexter published in 1976. It does include commentary about Peggy Lee; a smiling picture of her is among those with decorate the front of the book's jacket, too.\n\nEnter Peggy Lee (1944)\n\nIssued on an album that Dave Dexter, Jr. ambitiously titled New American Jazz, the sides which resulted from that date were very well received. \"What a thrill,\" wrote Lee, \"to turn the radio on to D.J's Al Jarvis or Gene Norman and hear That Old Feeling and Ain't Goin' No Place. Suddenly I was also meeting people such as DeSylva, Wallichs and Mercer.\" The positive reception of the Dexter sides probably triggered Capitol's interest in making Peggy Lee -- retired or not -- part of its roster. \"At one of those meetings over Sy Devore's record shop,\" continues Lee, \"it was decided that David and I would record for Capitol, which brought up the subject of material.\" Gastel had listened to a couple of songs that Barbour and Lee had co-written as a pastime, and told the couple that they should play them for Mercer. They did. Mercer's reaction: \"why don't you record those?\" On December 27, 1944, Lee followed up on Mercer's suggestion. Released on a 78-rpm disc in 1945, the two self-penned songs (\"What More Can A Woman Do?\" and \"You Was Right, Baby\") were positively received, and probably did a lot to encourage Lee's ultimate decision to completely abandon any plans of retirement or semi-retirement.\n\nDave Barbour's friend Carlos Gastel was heavily involved in the process of signing Lee. When his services were fully enlisted by the Barbours, Gastel was already managing quite a few Capitol acts, and he would go on to manage even more artists from the label's roster: Nat King Cole, Stan Kenton and June Christy, Woody Herman, Mel Tormé, et cetera. Gastel was also the person who put Lee in contact with Tom Rockwell and his managing agency, General Artists Corporation.\n\nPeggy Lee signed a recording contract with Capitol in late 1944. An article suitably called \"Capitol Contract For Lee\" appeared in the January 1945 issue of the company's self-promotional magazine Capitol News. Subscribers of the magazine were told that the \"trush will return to wax for the first time since last January [1944] when she made two stellar sides for Capitol's New American Jazz album. It wasn't until a few weeks ago, however, that she signed a Capitol contract ...\" The article finishes by identifying Gastel as the singer's manager and GAC as her booking agency.\n\nIt should be acknowledged that this Capitol News item makes no specific mention of an exclusive or long-term contract. The primary piece of news is that \"Peggy Lee has signed to record additional sides for Capitol\" -- with no indication that the signing was to be extended beyond such sides.\n\nHowever, the establishment of a formal relationship between the label and the artist can still be gleaned from other details. Besides the more obvious matters (i.e., the writeup itself, and the choice of title), there is the dutiful mention, at the end of the Capitol-penned article, of both a booking agency and a manager.\n\nEmergence: Capitol Records And Peggy Lee (1945)\n\nCapitol, Gastel, and General Artists seem to have spent the first half of 1945 slowly developing their new artist's profile. (Lee's duties as a new mother might have factored into the relatively slow pace.) Photos featuring Lee appeared in the front pages of the Capitol News issues for the months of March and May. Both issues made a point of announcing that she was beginning to dabble in film work. Buddy DeSylva, her new Capitol boss and also an executive producer at Paramount, was said to be interested in testing her for movie appearances. Also around March, the singer would be booked at the Orpheum in LA for her first post-Goodman solo concert date, and she would be appearing on the radio show of one fellow Capitol artist (Andy Russell).\n\nDuring the second quarter of 1945, Capitol's promotional machinery heightened its operational strategies on Lee's behalf. Two of her songs from the December 1944 date were finally released in late April or early May of 1945. The April 26, 1945 issue of Billboard magazine includes not only a review of the songs but also a Capitol ad which covers half a page (with the other half occupied by the periodical's music popularity charts). \"Capitol proudly presents a new edition to its artists' roster,\" the first of the ad's three paragraphs proclaims. Furthermore, her photo graces the cover of the June 1, 1945 issue of Downbeat magazine, which makes mention as well of the recently released single, \"What More Can A Woman Do\"/ \"You Was Right, Baby.\"\n\nAlso taking place during this heightened period was Peggy Lee's next record date (July 30, 1945), during which she waxed brand new songs of the day (\"Waiting For The Train To Come In,\" \"I'm Glad I Waited For You\") . Since those were numbers which songpluggers were sending to all competing record labels, there is a worthwhile inference to be made from the fact that Lee was recording them. By this point, Lee was being officially added to Capitol's rotation of in-house artists, among whom incoming new songs must have been distributed (not dictatorially, I hasten to add, but more likely as suggestions for the artists to take into consideration).\n\nThe label which had recently welcomed Lee was definitely a prosperous upstart. Attesting to Capitol's financial success in those early years, the following account was given by the aforementioned Dave Dexter, Jr., who in time raised to the title of executive producer at the label: \"[w]ith the end of World War II, Capitol had accelerated its annual sales from a modest $200,000 in 1942 to $750,000 in 1943, then $2,250,000 in 1944 on up to a truly impressive $5,100,000 in 1945. That year, Capitol marketed 14 albums and 48 singles,\" among which there were three major sellers (Mercer's \"On The Atchison, Topeka And The Santa Fe,\" Stan Kenton and June Christy's novelty hit \"Tampico,\" and Betty Hutton's catchy version of \"Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief\"). Dexter, Jr. adds that the company \"led all labels in [radio] airplay\" and continued to do so for many ensuing years, too. The year 1945 was also the one in which Capitol enjoyed its very first number one single (Johnny Mercer's \"On The Atchison, Topeka And The Santa Fe,\" from single #195) and album (The King Cole Trio, originally issued with catalogue number A-8).\n\nAs will be chronicled in the chrono-discographical pages that are a continuation to this one, Peggy Lee would rapidly position herself as a chart-hitting artist at Capitol Records in the months to come -- most times in partnership with husband Dave Barbour, and sometimes in the company of other musical acts from the label's roster. She proved successful with both the pop numbers of the era and the compositions that the married couple had kept on composing.\n\nLee actually recorded for Capitol on a continuous string from the mid-1940s to February of 1952, by which time she was no longer working in partnership with her husband. Next (two months after her February 1952 session for Capitol), the artist started recording for Decca, where she stayed for five years. Then, in April of 1957, she returned to Capitol again, and continued to record for the label until April of 1972. Having spent 21 or 22 years under contract (depending on whether we include 1944, when she recorded for the label in January and December, but might have not signed an exclusive contract until around that last month), Peggy Lee ranks high among the longest-lasting vocal acts in Capitol's roster, along with Nat King Cole, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Stan Kenton, Gordon MacRae, Tex Ritter, and Nancy Wilson. A Capitol artist par excellence.\n\nPopularity: Peggy In The Polls (1943-1945)\n\nPeggy Lee's temporary retirement from a singing career did not affect her standing as a popular vocalist. On the contrary, at the end of her retirement year (1943) she reached the #2 position of Downbeat's Band, Female poll.\n\nIn 1944, Lee gradually came back from retirement, and was newly billed as a solo artist. Thus her name was entered in a different Downbeat poll which was simply called Female. She placed at #10 in that poll. (The appearance of her name at all strikes me as somewhat surprising, since the singer had been barely active throughout the year. Visibility might have stemmed from the radio airplay received by her guest vocals for the album New American Jazz, and from that album's sales.) In the poll, Lee had received 80 votes. Preceding her at #9 with 83 and #8 with 98 votes were her Capitol labelmates Martha Tilton and Ella Mae Morse. The upper echelon consisted of Mildred Bailey (#5), Billie Holiday, Jo Stafford, Helen Forrest and, at the very top with 1245 votes, Dinah Shore.\n\nIn 1945, Peggy Lee shot up to the #4 position, with 410 votes. Previous top holder Dinah Shore dropped to #3, with a total of 472 votes. Dropping also was Helen Forrest; with 308 votes, she had fallen from #2 to #5. Taking Forrest's former position, thanks to 705 votes, was Billie Holiday. Finally, with 838 votes on her behalf, the year's top female act was Jo Stafford, up two slots in the poll.\n\nStatistics: Total Number Of Peggy Lee Masters (1944-1945)\n\nThis discographical page lists a total of 14 masters recorded by Peggy Lee during her transitional period from Columbia to Capitol Records. Also included here are two alternate takes, which Capitol has commercially released on numerous issues.\n\nTen of those masters were officially made for Capitol. In the earliest of them (January 7, 1944), Lee functioned as a guest vocalist. In later ones, she recorded with the musical backing of her husband, guitarist Dave Barbour, and received star billing.\n\nAs for the remaining four masters, two were released by Ara Records, and feature Lee as guest vocalist. Made with a name orchestra, she fulfills in them the same \"big band canary\" role that she had held during her earlier days at Columbia Records. The other two masters are promotional records tied to the film company Disney, and may also bear a loose connection to Capitol Records.\n\nOf these 14 titles, the Disney masters are the only ones still awaiting a proper release. \"Two Silhouettes\" and \"Johnny Fedora And Alice Blue Bonnet\" have actually appeared on Public Domain CDs (though barely so), but they still need to be issued in better sound quality by a legitimate, non-Public Domain record company. Pleasantly mellow and musical performances, both are very deserving of a quality digital release.\n\nPhotos\n\nAbove: all three images seen at the top of the present section are part of advertisement published in 1945 issues of the magazine Capitol News. Peggy Lee's name is among the Capitol \"line-up of top artists\" listed in the first ad. The caption under the photo of Peggy Lee and Dave Barbour refers to Capitol's release of their recordings as an example of the label's interest of jazz during the year 1945.\n\nBelow: a professionally attired Peggy Lee graces two pictures to which the photo stock agency Getty Images has given an April 6, 1945 date. A more informally dressed Lee poses for a publicity photo that circulated two months later (second image). In the third of these shots, Lee stands next to a \"V For Victory\" sign, which was part of a campaign in celebration of the United Nations' triumph over then-antagonistic Germany. She could also be said to have emerged victorious-lee out of the year 1945.\n\nSessions Reported: 6\n\nPerformances Reported: 16\n\nUnique Songs Reported: 14\n\nUnique Issues Reported: 170"
