        "text": "A new Beatles box set called the U.S. Albums shows Canadians got a better deal from the early Beatles than fans across the border.\n\nThe collection, due out Jan. 21, reissues all 13 of the band’s American albums, which often had mixes, track lists and cover art that differed from the U.K. originals.\n\nIts release is tied to the 50th anniversary of the Beatles first performance on The Ed Sullivan Show — Feb. 9. 1964.\n\nBut another date — Feb. 18, 1963 — is a fascinating footnote in Beatles’ history. It’s the day Love Me Do, the Beatles’ first single, was released in Canada.\n\nCapitol Records of Canada was blessed with Paul White, a young Brit who headed the label’s new artist and repertoire department in Toronto. White delivered the Beatles to Canadian fans almost a year before the band played the Sullivan show.\n\nWhite was 27 when he first heard Love Me Do, around Christmastime in 1962. It was among a batch of singles sent by EMI, Capital’s parent company in England. The record had been a hit there the previous October. White’s job was to choose international records that might become hits in Canada.\n\n“It was just a simple little song, not a great piece, but there was something joyful about the singing,” White, who came to Canada from England in 1957, told the Citizen.\n\n“I put it out (in February 1963), and I think it sold 170 copies.”\n\nWhite kept plugging. He released the Beatles next two British singles, Please Please Me and From Me To You, but both flopped here. All three singles were played on CFPL in London — the only station in the country to do so.\n\nBut White believed in the band. His faith paid off when She Loves You, the fourth Canadian single, came out in late September.\n\n“It went berserk,” said White. She Loves You went to number one on the CHUM Hit Parade in Toronto in late December.\n\nThe Beatles played two shows at Carnegie Hall and made two other appearances on the Sullivan show that long-ago February. White was summoned to New York, where the Beatles were under siege at the Plaza Hotel.\n\n“As I went through security to go up to their suite, I saw that the girls had broken half the mirrors in the lobby.”\n\nThe lads took a liking to White, joking with him constantly. “I’m from Somerset, so they ribbed me about that in their Liverpool accents.”\n\nThe U.S. Albums includes five Capitol albums never before\n\navailable on CD —The Beatles’ Story, an audio commentary of the band’s rise to\n\nfame, “Yesterday” … And Today, Hey Jude, and the U.S. versions of A Hard Day’s\n\nNight Soundtrack and Revolver.\n\nIn the U.S., the company made a hodgepodge of the Beatles’ artistic intentions by re-ordering the songs and replacing some tracks meant for a particular album with others that weren’t.\n\nThe process meant American fans got bowdlerized versions of the first U.K. albums, with fewer songs and shoddy mixes that were worse in stereo.\n\nWhite was sharp enough to prevent that from happening in Canada.\n\nIn November\n\n1963, White released Beatlemania! With The Beatles. Musically, it was a copy of\n\nthe band’s second U.K. album With the Beatles but with an altered front cover.\n\nWhite bedecked the arty black and white album cover with quotes\n\nfrom Canadian journalists, including a memorable line from Sandy Gardiner of\n\nthe Ottawa Journal: “A new disease is sweeping through England … and doctors\n\nare powerless to stop it … it’s Beatlemania!”\n\nPiers Hemmingsen, a leading Beatles historian, credits the album with transforming the music industry. “It sold 300,000 copies in Canada, an enormous success.” Before the Beatles, teenagers bought only singles, he adds.\n\nMeanwhile in the U.S., nothing was happening for the Beatles.\n\nDave Dexter Jr., head of Capitol’s international A&R, had turned down the band at least three times, rejecting the Love Me Do, Please Please Me and She Loves You singles.\n\n“I can only remember that when I heard John Lennon playing the harmonica (on Love Me Do), I thought it was the worst thing I’d ever heard. So I nixed it,” Dexter said in an 1988 oral interview with an American university.\n\nBecause Dexter had refused to issue the Beatles’ first singles, the Beatles were big in Canada months before they broke into the U.S. market.\n\nDexter, then 48, was an avowed jazz fan who loathed rock ‘n’ roll. When the head of EMI in England intervened, U.S. Capitol finally released I Want To Hold Your Hand in late December 1963.\n\nAt that point, White had already produced and released the first two Canadian Beatles albums — Beatlemania! With The Beatles and Twist And Shout.\n\n“I never touched (the mixes of) the tracks,” said White.\n\nIn the States, Dexter added reverb to the Beatles’ tracks to make them sound more “American.” He often compressed the sound by raising the volume of softer passages, and lowering volume for louder parts of the songs.\n\nAt the bottom left-hand corner of The Beatles’ Long Tall Sally, their third Canadian album, you’ll find the following credit: “Canadian Album Production, Paul White.”\n\n“I was too stupid to ask for it for the first two albums,” White joked.\n\nWhite put together Long Tall Sally with several songs taken from Please Please Me, the Beatles’ first U.K. album, as well as some singles released only there.\n\nThen Capitol’s office in Hollywood reached out to throttle White’s creativity.\n\n“I got a letter saying that from now on, there would be no more different 45s and albums. Everything would come from them. I was pissed off.”\n\nStarting in mid-1964, all Beatles releases in Canada copied U.S. formats.\n\nCapitol had to go to court to regain control of the Beatles, lost when Dexter passed on their early singles. Because of Dexter, the first Beatles singles and album were released on the tiny Vee-Jay label in the States.\n\nCapitol won the case, but as it went through the courts, Beatles singles released by White in Canada — including Roll Over Beethoven — were being imported into the States, climbing the Billboard charts. That made Capitol executives in America look like bumblers. It’s not surprising that they reined in White.\n\nThere was another reason — money. Thanks to U.S. copyright laws, Capitol was able to release 11- or 12-song Beatles albums, compared with the 14-song U.K. versions. This meant Capitol could assemble more albums from the U.K. leftovers, and make much more money.\n\nDexter was booted off Beatles’ projects on London’s orders after programming, remixing and remastering Rubber Soul.\n\nHe decided that Rubber Soul should be a folk-rock album, with I’ve Just Seen a Face, pulled from the U.K. Help! soundtrack, as the opening track. But the Beatles had intentions of their own, and Drive My Car, which opens the authentic U.K. Rubber Soul, conveys a different impression of what the band hand in mind — there’s not a comparable full-blooded rocker on the entire American version.\n\nDexter sometimes showed good instincts. Rubber Soul is a wonderful album, and one of its many artful touches is the false start on I’m Looking Through You. John Lennon begins an intro on acoustic guitar, pauses briefly, then starts again. There’s a second little lurch before he gets through it. The flub gives the song a delightful intimacy, like the listener is right there in the recording studio.\n\nDexter, presumably, left the flub intact. For Beatles fans on this side of the Atlantic, the false start is an integral part of the song. The mistake is edited out of the U.K. edition of Rubber Soul, and, somehow, the “correct” version seems wrong.\n\nDexter was arguably at his worst on Something New, thanks to the inclusion of Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand which is I Want to Hold Your Hand, sung in German. The Beatles wanted it released only in German-speaking countries.\n\nCapital continued to tinker with Beatles releases up to Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. By then, the band had enough clout and artistic freedom to insist that their records be released exactly as they wished.\n\nCapitol Records decided not to remaster The U.S. Albums from the original Capitol master tapes, quashing the Dexter mixes.\n\n“…The masters used are, in most cases, the same as the stereo and mono mixes released in 2009 as part of the Parlophone/Apple core catalogue, all approved by George Martin and The Beatles,” the company said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. Albums restore the mental imprint most of us have of the Beatles’ output. That’s the fun part. The frustration comes in realizing how much better the albums would have been had the original British track configuration been followed.\n\nBut White wasn’t finished after U.S. Capitol clamped down on him.\n\nHe signed many British Invasion bands to Capitol Canada, including the Dave Clark Five, The Hollies, The Animals, The Yardbirds, Peter and Gordon and several others. In the U.S., most of these bands avoided Capitol and signed with other labels.\n\nWhite used the money flowing in to sign several Canadian groups — including two Ottawa bands: The Staccatos, who became The Five Man Electrical Band, and The Esquires. He also signed the pre-Steppenwolf Jack London and The Sparrows.\n\nWhite eventually left Capitol and went to work with Balmur Entertainment — Anne Murray’s company."
