        "text": "I would have been more kindly disposed toward the man had he not trashed John Lennon not long after his murder in a Billboard column titled \"Nobody's Perfect.\" At the time, Dexter was writing for the trade mag, and his columns were usually pretty good. This time, he used the brief space he was given to essentially trash JL for talking ill about the way the Beatles US catalog was handled(and sonically tampered with), though Dexter claimed Lennon had actually praised him for what he had done with those recordings in question(we will guess, essentially, the 1964 stuff with all the echo and 'verb). Well, John was always known to change his tune...\n\nyet hard to defend most of that needless excess, although I've always been the first to praise the overload on the \"I Feel Fine\"/\"She's A Woman\" 45(though even here a bit less would still have left an exciting record).\n\nI remember seeing Dexter's name on some Capitol jazz Lp's, too, though I'm too lazy to check and see if that was as producer, liner note writer, or both. I think what bugged me most of all, later on, was that Dexter's name would turn up on some british invasion albums, as on Peter & Gordon's A WORLD WITHOUT LOVE: \"Produced for the U.S.A. by Dave Dexter, Jr.\" As if adding reverb and Eq amounted to 'production'; to add to the insult, the actual P&G producer at the time, Norman Newell, received no credit at all. Now, that may not have been Dexter's doing, but that's still his sole credit on the album cover, and it's a deception.\n\nI wish he were still with us; would have liked an opportunity for an explanation about that P&G credit, if nothing else. Maybe Capitol's misguided idea....\n\nED\n\nI actually wrote a letter to Billboard (thast was published) in response to Dexter's article. I don't have it handy to quote, but I expressed an opinion that was anti-Dexter.\n\nNow that people know I knew Dave I'm being flooded with messages asking me to talk a little about Dave & The Beatles. Sigh.\n\nWell, first of all, Dave thought he was IMPROVING the sound of the Beatles' tapes. Perhaps on the crappy home equipment of the day, the American versions did sound better.\n\nSecondly, Dave (as he told me), didn't like John Lennon very much (ya think?) Dave said that John (as the \"voice\" of the group) didn't want to \"Play the game at all\", meaning the publicity game. He didn't want to shmooze with the press, didn't want to shake hands with cripples, etc. Dave never forgave him for that. Now, when Lennon died and Dexter wrote his little piece in Billboard, I wrote a letter to the magazine that was published in the next issue. Basically I ripped Dave a new one for being so openly hostile the week after John died. On reflection, that not wanting to meet cripples thing really galled Dave for some reason. I asked him about it, and he said that the Beatles brought hope to this country after Kennedy was killed and he was appalled that the group just wanted to party in Los Angeles. A generational thing I think. Like Prince Charles vs. Princess Diana. Charles was and is \"duty first\" and Diana just wanted to hang out...\n\nAt any rate, when I finally met Dave in 1982, the first thing I told him was that I wrote that bitch letter about him and I was sorry about it. That's when we started talking about the Beatles era. He said that all he was trying to do was give their music some \"life\" by redubbing with chamber echo and new EQ. He felt the British tapes sounded \"dead as a door nail\" which they probably did on the consumer equipment of the time. He said he was under pressure from the very top to lower the number of tracks on albums and that the Beatles were no exception. Since Capitol had to wait for certain early songs to become available to them, they had to scramble for tracks in 1964.\n\nDave also said it was his idea to make RUBBER SOUL into a folk album by programming it to start with I'VE JUST SEEN A FACE and by putting IT'S ONLY LOVE on there and removing an uptempo number or two. It worked for me; the American programming of Rubber Soul is the only time I'll take the American version over the British, even though it lost three songs in the process.\n\nAt any rate, we had a nice chat and I basically hired him to write all of the liner notes for our big jazz series. After all, he knew all of the players from that era personally.\n\nRegarding Capitol's PET SOUNDS, a first press mono LP was cut from the full-track master tape, with the usual Capitol \"compromises\" made for vinyl in that era; weird EQ, weird compression and a curious lackluster sound that was just the antithesis of their late 1950's mastering sound. Such is life."
