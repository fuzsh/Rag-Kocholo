        "text": "I remember when you were here. #PlagueSongs, no. 37 AND Seven Xmas Playlists\n\nWelcome to your second pandemic Christmas (or Solstice or Hanukkah or whatever you celebrate)! Since you and I and the plague are still here, I’m doing a holiday installment of my ongoing PlagueSongs series AND sharing seven – that’s right, SEVEN! – playlists of mostly secular seasonal music. Enjoy!\n\nLet’s start with the song, written by Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry, and first recorded by Darlene Love for A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector (1963).\n\nHere’s Darlene Love’s original –\n\nHere’s U2’s cover, done for A Very Special Christmas (1987). Love those hats!\n\nAnd now, this post’s greatest contribution to your holiday festivities – playlists! (Seven of ’em!)\n\n1) A Very Jazzy Christmas. This is my most popular Spotify holiday playlist. 3 hours, all jazz, no vocals. And no Kenny G. or other ersatz jazz. Just the good stuff: Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Rashaan Roland Kirk, Terrence Blanchard, Bill Evans, Chet Baker, Duke Ellington, Oscar Peterson, Earl Hines, Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Haden, Hank Jones, Dexter Gordon, Stanley Jordan, MJQ, & more.\n\n2) Yule Get Through the Holidays: Xmas Megamix 2020-2021. Over 8 hours of holiday music of many varieties – an updated, slightly expanded version of a mix created last year. And by “many varieties,” I mean everything from classics (Jackson 5’s “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,” Louis Armstrong’s “Cool Yule,” Waitresses’ “Christmas Wrapping”) to songs you might not expect (Tom Waits’ “Chocolate Jesus,” Lyle Lovett’s “Penguins,” the Barry Sisters’ “Chiribim Chiribom,” Outkast’s “Player’s Ball”) to curious covers (the Fall’s “Jingle Bell Rock,” Daniel Johnston’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree”). Mariah Carey, Bad Religion, Duke Ellington, Stevie Wonder, Johnny Cash, the Muppets, Leslie Odom Jr., Paul Simon, Staple Singers, Thurl Ravenscroft, Ramones, Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby, Marvin Gaye, Carly Rae Jespen, the dB’s, Wham!, the Kinks, James Brown, Fountains of Wayne, Daveed Diggs, Los Lobos, Curtis Mayfield, Dolly Parton, Jimi Hendrix, Barenaked Ladies, Billie Holiday, Donny Hathaway… and many more. Guaranteed to surprise! My goal here was to sustain interest by mixing the known and the lesser-known. And credit to the inspiration for this playlist: Carl Wilson’s Yule Make It Thru December.\n\n3) Cool Yule. Primarily big band jazz (usually with vocals) and lounge. A holiday mix that swings! Includes Louis Armstrong, Mabel Scott, Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby, Eartha Kitt, Kay Starr, Kay Thompson, Lena Horne, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, June Christy, Peggy Lee, Julie London, the Ravens, the Andrews Sisters, Fats Waller, Nat King Cole, many others.\n\n4) Blue Christmas. Melancholic holiday music, including Sara Bareilles, Pilgrim Travelers, Harry Nilsson, Regina Spektor, John Prine, Shawn Colvin, Barenaked Ladies, Marshall Crenshaw, Lyle Lovett, Nick Lowe, Madeleine Peyroux, Gregory Porter, Phoebe Bridgers, Mark Knopfler, Bruce Cockburn, Hem, Everything But the Girl, Simon & Garfunkel, Nils Frahm, & others.\n\n5) 1980s Christmas. Kurtis Blow, U2, Prince, Madonna, Ramones, RUN-DMC, Wham!, Squeeze, Erasure, Pretenders, Bruce Springsteen, John (Cougar) Mellencamp, Alison Moyet, Pogues & Kirsty MacColl, Hall & Oates, Sting and more sing Christmas songs in the 1980s! (Yes, even the Springsteen–though recorded in 1975, its first commercial release was 1981.)\n\n6) Thank God It Isn’t Christmas Every Day. Named for a Mitch Benn song not on Spotify, this playlist contains only odd, off-beat holiday songs. It used to begin with Stephen Colbert’s “Another Christmas Song,” but that’s just slipped off Spotify. In its CD version it also contains the original version of “R2 D2, We Wish You a Merry Christmas” (Jon Bon Jovi’s recording debut, inexplicably not on Spotify), but here uses Brian Dewan’s cover. It does include many other oddities on Spotify, including performances from the Sonics, Weird Al Yankovic, Tom Lehrer, Tom Waits, Oscar the Grouch, Wild Man Fischer, Lisa Miller, Parry Gripp, Buck Owens, Jill Sobule, Jimmy Jules, Woody Phillips (“Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” played on power tools!), & more.\n\n7) Rockin’ Through the Holidays: Classic Christmas Mix. A Spotify version of a favorite CD compilation I made for my sister Linda (and have given to others). Springsteen, Waitresses, Ronettes, U2, Chuck Berry, Beach Boys, Ventures, Fountains of Wayne, Solomon Burke, Stevie Wonder, Macy Gray, and others. Upbeat rock, pop, R&B. If you’d like a more eclectic upbeat mix, try Countdown to Christmas.\n\nWhat? You seek more Christmas music? Well, OK, I hope you know Duke Ellington’s version of The Nutcracker Suite (1960). If you don’t know it, click on the link in the previous sentence.\n\nThe playlist below offers many tunes that (directly or tangentially) intersect with our plague era.

Nena’s “99 Luftballons.”\n\nBanish sadness and strife. #PlagueSongs, no. 22 (11 Aug. 2020). “Look for the Silver Lining,” composed by Jerome Kern and Buddy DeSylva. My version is based on the Chet Baker recording. The final weekly #PlagueSong.\n\nDon’t write yourself off yet. #PlagueSongs, no. 23 (27 Oct. 2020).
