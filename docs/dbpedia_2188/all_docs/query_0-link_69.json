        "text": "The Christmas – Swing, Jazz, Big Band, Blues, Oldies & Crooners playlist\n\nTime for the merriest of times, Christmas! Apart from Santa, decorations and good food. It must be accompanied by a proper soundtrack. Therefor I made one.\n\nWhen it comes to Christmas music I like the traditional jazz and crooners numbers. I am not alone either. This is the music that year after year top the charts for holiday music.\n\nSpotifys most played Christmas songs\n\nIn 2020 Spotify released a top list with its most played holiday songs. It goes as follows:\n\n1. Mariah Carey, ”All I Want for Christmas Is You!\n\n2. Wham! ”Last Christmas”\n\n3. Ariana Grande, ”Santa Tell Me”\n\n4. Michael Bublé, ”It’s Beginning to Look a Lot like Christmas”\n\n5. Justin Bieber, ”Mistletoe”\n\n6. Andy Williams, ”It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year”\n\n7. Brenda Lee, ”Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree”\n\n8. Bobby Helms, ”Jingle Bell Rock”\n\n9. Band Aid, ”Do They Know It’s Christmas?” (1984)\n\n10. Frank Sinatra (feat. B. Swanson Quartet), ”Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!”\n\n11. John Lennon & Yoko Ono, ”Happy Xmas (War Is Over)”\n\n12. Bing Crosby, John Scott Trotter & His Orchestra, Ken Darby Singers, ”White Christmas”\n\n13. José Feliciano, ”Feliz Navidad”\n\n14. Michael Bublé, ”Holly Jolly Christmas”\n\n15. Chris Rea, ”Driving Home for Christmas”\n\n16. Nat King Cole, ”The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You)”\n\n17. Paul McCartney, ”Wonderful Christmastime”\n\n18. Sam Smith, ”Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas”\n\n19. Elvis Presley, ”Blue Christmas”\n\n20. Kelly Clarkson, ”Underneath the Tree”\n\nNo surprises there.\n\nA few of these songs are included on the playlist I’ve made. But I’ve stayed away from songs from the 80s and later. If you like those songs they can be found on other playlists.\n\nInstead I’ve focused on the older tunes. I’ve also tried to find songs that aren’t as popular as some of those. The important thing is that they have that vintage sound that I’m looking for.\n\nChristmas albums with Frankie, Ella and Elvis\n\nBefore the days of Spotify, I used CDs and each Christmas I put on an album by Ella Fitzgerald. I loved that album.\n\nSince then I’ve bought Elvis’ Christmas album on vinyl and am looking to get a hold of Frank Sinatras. To me those are the best Christmas albums ever.\n\nI usually don’t like playlists that copy entire albums. Instead I try to spread the music around, from different artists. And then ain’t it glorious when you stumble on a forgotten gem!?\n\nThe other week I found this charming song and added it to the playlist:\n\nSo, I’m open to suggestions and if you’ve got a tune that you think could fit on the playlist, just add it in a comment to this post.\n\nWith that, I wish you a very merry Christmas. Remember to be kind!\n\nTime for the merriest of times, Christmas! Apart from Santa, decorations and good food. It must be accompanied by a proper soundtrack. Therefor I made one. When it comes to Christmas music I like the traditional jazz and crooners numbers. I am not alone either. This is the music that year after year top the…\n\nTime for the merriest of times, Christmas!
