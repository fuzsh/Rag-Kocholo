All three of the latter have been reissued on CD as Japanese imports and each of these will also be the focus of individual features on the blog.\n\nLet’s start with the boxed set, copies of which can be found both used and new from various online resellers and which contain The Complete Blue Note Sessions, both those that were released on Blue Note albums from 1961-1965 and those that came later.\n\nThe boxed set annotations are by Michael Cuscuna, who has had a long association with Blue Note and produced many of its reissues, both on vinyl and CD. These include music that was issued subsequent to Blue Note's existence from 1939 until its acquisition by Liberty Records in 1965.\n\nMichael has also continued to be involved with Blue Note reissues in his current role as one of the executives at Mosaic Records.\n\nBruce Lundvall who signed Dexter to a recording contract with Columbia when Gordon triumphant return to the USA in 1977 contributed some reminiscences to the boxed set’s notes, Dexter’s widow Maxine shared some of the ongoing correspondence that Dex has with Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff, the owners of Blue Note and the esteemed Jazz author and scholar Dan Morgenstern contributed a track-by-track analysis of each of the sessions to the boxed set booklet.\n\nSo as to keep this initial feature from becoming unwieldy, excerpts from Bruce’s memories, Maxine’s correspondence file and Dan’s track descriptions will be used as lead-in quotations to other blog segments focused on Dexter’s Blue Note Years.\n\nTo kick-off things, here’s Michael Cuscuna’s overview of the history of Blue Note and how Dexter’s music became a part of its offerings.\n\n“BLUE NOTE was recognized as a distinctive and uncompromising jazz label of quality from its inception in 1939. It teetered on the brink of insolvency for most of its first 17 years. Founder Alfred Lion and his partner Francis Wolff would rather record people they loved like Thelonious Monk and Herbie Nichols than chase hits that compromised their taste.\n\nSuccess came anyway in 1956 with the music of Horace Silver and Art Blakey. They and a few others had formulated an audience-friendly offshoot of be-bop that came to be known as hard bop. The tempo was slowed, the melodies more memorable and earthier elements of blues and gospel were intermingled with the achievements of modern jazz. And when it swung and had a creative edge, it was called The Blue Note Sound. The public responded.\n\nThe combination of Lion's meticulous preparations and production, Rudy Van Gelder's sparkling sound, Reid Miles's cover designs and Wolff's photography made Blue Note THE hip label. It didn't hurt that discoveries like Jimmy Smith and The Three Sounds were beginning to sell in healthy numbers.\n\nWhen Bob Leonard, agent for The Three Sounds among others, contacted Blue Note in 1960 about recording Dexter Gordon, Alfred Lion was not only willing but also able to say yes. Although he'd recorded Monk, Bud Powell and Miles Davis in the early stages of their careers, this was the first opportunity For Blue Note to sign an already established major artist.\n\nFor Dexter Gordon, who'd hardly recorded in the fifties, this was a chance to jump-start his career on an international level with a company that was as classy as he was. This mutually-beneficial, well-suited five-year relationship between Dexter and Blue Note yielded a gorgeous body of work, all of which is gathered in this boxed set.\n\nFrom a gene pool that spanned Africa to Northern Europe with a healthy infusion of elements from 19th century migration to Canada and the United States came Dexter Keith Gordon on February 27, 1923. He was the only son of Frank, a native of Fargo, North Dakota who became a prominent doctor in Los Angeles and Gwendolyn, whose Father was born in Wyoming. And he was doted upon.\n\nLionel Hampton and Duke Ellington were among Dr. Frank Gordon's patients. Dexter was treated to his father's records and to concerts that he attended with his father that often included backstage visits. He often used to say, \"I don't care how old \"Sweets\" [Harry Edison] says he is, the first time I saw him, I was in short pants and he was on stage.\"\n\nDoctor Frank bought his son a clarinet at age seven and encouraged his musical inclinations. Seven years later, Dexter experienced a profound and lifelong emptiness when his father succumbed to a heart attack without warning.\n\nDexter switched to alto saxophone and then tenor. His favorites were the giants of the day, most especially Lester Young, who deeply shaped his musical intellect, and Dick Wilson, featured soloist with Andy Kirk.\n\nAt the tender age of seventeen, Dexter was invited to audition for the Lionel Hampton band by Marshall Royal, a patient of his father and older brother of Dexter's friend Ernie. He got the job and, with his mother's blessing, stepped on the band bus before graduating high school. It's a day that lived vividly in Dexter's memory.\n\nDexter's tenor mate in that band was Illinois Jacquet, only a year older but a great deal more experienced. \"I was always leaning on Dexter to get his stuff together. He was so young and wanted to copy everything Lester Young said, wore and played. In the band, we'd all tap our feet in time while we played the chart. But Dexter was so big and those size-fourteen feet would come up in their own time and then come down again with no relation to the tempo. I told him that that had to stop. It was messing me up…. Dexter and I used to do a Lester Young-Herschel Evans two-tenor number called \"Pork Chops.\" It went over big with the audiences. I remember, one night at the Savoy Ballroom, Dexter and I were out front playing it. People at the foot of the stage were blowing pot smoke up at us. By the thirtieth chorus, we had no idea what the changes were, (laughs) I wanted Hamp to record it, but he never did. He regretted not doing it and used to bring that up to me for years.\"\n\nIn 1944, Dexter played with Fletcher Henderson and then got a job with the Louis Armstrong Orchestra. And although he was basically a section man, he adored that time, studying with the master innovator and showman. Around this time, Dexter cut four quartet sides for Norman Granz with Nat Cole on piano. His own sound was emerging.\n\nBy the end of '44, Dexter was a member of the Billy Eckstine Orchestra that became an incubator for the bebop revolution. It was Art Blakey that dragged him into the fold. Suddenly, Dexter was surrounded nightly by Sarah Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie, Fats Navarro, Sonny Stitt, Lucky Thompson, Gene Ammons, Leo Parker, John Malachi and other architects of the new music.\n\nFrom Lester Young, Dexter learned the art of improvisation: develop ideas of substance, finish a thought, never waste a note and, above all, know the lyrics of any ballad you dare to play. Once he found a mouthpiece and instrument to his liking, Dexter developed a robust sound and brought to the tenor saxophone the first totally realized bebop style on the instrument. He would become a model for both Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane, who would in the fifties spearhead the two major streams of tenor saxophone playing for the next twenty years.\n\nThrough his 52nd Street appearances with Dizzy Gillespie and his LA recording of \"The Chase\" with tenor saxophonist Wardell Gray, Dexter became something of a bi-coastal celebrity in the late forties. Gray was a saxophonist with fluent articulation and a smoother sound. But he and Dexter developed a musical connection that transcended the arena of the tenor battle. Listening to a reissue of live tapes, Dexter once told me that, despite the differences in their styles, it was sometimes hard for him to tell where one left off and the other began. Their symbiosis ran that deep.\n\nIn late 1952, Dexter was busted for possession of heroin and sentenced to two years at the state prison in China. It gave him an opportunity to make his film debut in \"Unchained,\" although Georgie Auld's tenor is dubbed in when Dexter is playing on screen. But more importantly, as Dexter with a steely stare was always quick to point out of this and a subsequent internment, \"It saved my life.\" But it also derailed his career.\n\nBy 1955, the rage in LA was the west coast sound of Shorty Rogers, Shelly Manne, Chet Baker and the other disciples of the cool school. The successful hard-bop school of Silver, Blakey et al., which was then developing, was far more suited to Dexter's style. In fact, his big sound, his soulful behind-the-beat phrasing and his lyricism foreshadowed this movement. But he was in LA, and the hard boppers were in New York. He was all but forgotten and they were rising young stars. So too were Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane.\n\nUpon his parole in 1960, Dexter was approached by Cannonball Adderley to record an album for Riverside. The result was 'The Resurgence Of Dexter Gordon,\" an album which was not entirely successful but served the purpose. The next year, Dexter was asked to compose the music and lead the band on stage for the LA production of \"The Connection,\" which had originated in New York two years before with Freddie Redd's music.\n\nDex was back. He accepted the offer from Blue Note Records. And the jazz world finally remembered. For five years, Dexter made one masterful session\n\nafter another for Blue Note. The music coupled with the fascinating correspondence between Dexter and Blue Note's Alfred Lion and Frank Wolff during those years, found elsewhere in this booklet, complete the picture of a very important period in this artist's career.\n\nDexter liked working with Alfred Lion who leaned heavily on planning and rehearsals in hopes that such preparations would provide a spontaneous, but beautifully executed date. Beyond his own sessions, Dexter participated in two sideman appearances, Herbie Hancock's first album Takin' Off (not included here) and an aborted Sonny Stitt session, from which the one releasable tune, \"Lady Be Good,\" appears here for the first time. Listening to the tapes of this session some 18 years ago, Dexter told me, 'This was Stitt and his working band. Alfred asked me to join in on a few numbers. Sonny didn't want to rehearse or talk about tunes. Alfred was already frustrated when the date began. Stitt was charging through things. Alfred was getting more and more nervous. And when Sonny started playing \"Bye Bye Blackbird,\" Alfred just lost it. He started screaming, 'what are you doing to me?...You've recorded that a hundred times' and called off the date. It was a funny scene.\" (The music for the albums Landslide and Clubhouse and the bonus tracks which later appeared on CD were also auditioned at that time and approved by Dexter.)\n\nDuring this time, Dexter was spreading his wings. A gig at Ronnie Scott's began a love affair with London, then Paris, then Copenhagen. And Dexter became, like Kenny Clarke, Don Byas, Johnny Griffin and so many others, an expatriate.\n\nThese Blue Note sessions afforded him the opportunity to record for the first time with musicians like Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Barry Harris, Kenny Drew, Horace Parian and Billy Higgins with whom he would have a professional connection for years to come. Ironically, Hutcherson and Higgins reach back to Dexter's childhood. One of Dexter's best friends in high school was Bobby's older brother Teddy (Dexter even refers to Bobby as Teddy in a letter to Alfred.) And Billy Higgins remembers, as a youngster, seeing Dexter come up the walk to sit on the front porch with his older sister. Years later Billy Higgins and Bobby Hutcherson joined Dexter in the film \"'Round Midnight.\"\n\nDexter's fondest memory of his years with Blue Note was the album Go. It's rare that an artist, the critics and the fans are all in accord. But everyone agrees that this was Dexter's greatest album. The empathy among Dexter, Sonny Clark, Butch Warren and Billy Higgins is extraordinary. Within a beautifully balanced selection of material, Dexter fashions gorgeous solos with complete abandon and trust. The rhythm section rises to the occasion with everything they've got. The result is perfection. The session that produced A Swingin' Affair two days later runs a close second. Both of these rarefied musical experiences are on Disc Three of this set.\n\nDexter's musical accomplishments and achievements went on for more than twenty years beyond his association with Blue Note, culminating with a nomination for Best Actor at the 1987 Academy Awards for his starring role in Bertrand Tavernier's film \"'Round Midnight.\"\n\nDexter Gordon, his musical genius aside, is one of the most unique people I've ever met. A voracious reader, Dexter's taste ranged from 19th century French writer Emile Zola to J. P. Donleavy's \"The Ginger Man.\" (He remembered an especially dour high school teacher who hated musicians and was confounded and annoyed by the fact that her only A students were Dexter and Chico Hamilton).\n\nWhen Maxine met Dexter in Europe in 1975, they began to plan for his spectacular return to the US. (He holds the world's record for homecomings and resurgences.) In 1976, Bruce Lundvall signed him to Columbia Records. Woody Shaw asked me to produce the recordings and put together a band and material for Dexter. At six o'clock on a Friday night, we were all sitting in the office of a Columbia business affairs executive, negotiating Dexter's buy-out from a Danish jazz label. He was to hit that night at nine-thirty at the Village Vanguard. I had an engineer (Malcolm Addey) and equipment standing by. Finally, at seven-thirty, we got the green light. Dexter and I grabbed a cab to the club. We were alone for the first time. I asked him a question at about Fiftieth Street. There was total silence for fourteen blocks. I thought, 'oh my God, this guy hates me!' Finally, just below Madison Square Garden, the answer slowly emerged.\n\nIt took some time to get used to Dexter's internal clock, but we became very close over the years. And his friendship is one that I will always cherish. Dexter loved language and linguistics. He learned a healthy chunk of every language to which he was exposed. He devoured local customs and cuisine with vigor and panache and had friends in every corner of the globe. Yet there was that part of him that was purely American. He would not take a gig during the World Series, loved meatloaf, mashed potatoes and peas and actually thought that 'too much garlic' was a physical impossibility.\n\nOutwardly, Dexter was exceedingly charming and friendly to all. Inwardly, he was a very private man who showed himself to few. It took a great deal to shake his veneer. I remember once flippantly referring to a musician as sounding too white. Uncharacteristically, Dexter shot me a hard glance and said, \"We went through a lot for the right to play with whomever we want to, white or black.\"\n\nThen there was the time Dexter called me at eleven o'clock one night and strongly suggested that I come down to the Village Vanguard. After I resisted on the grounds that I had work to do, he politely insisted. Finally, I said, \"do you want me to come down to fire the piano player?\" There was a long pause on the phone and then he said, \"ahhh...that would be nice.\"\n\nTo paraphrase two remarks by Dizzy Gillespie, \"He did everything wrong and it all turned out right. He should have left his karma to science.\"\n\n-MICHAEL CUSCUNA July 1996\n\nDexter Gordon \"Doin' Allright\" - The Blue Note Years - Part 2\n\n© Copyright ® Steven Cerra, copyright protected; all rights reserved.\n\n“The King of Quoters, Dexter Gordon, was himself eminently quotable. In a day not unlike our own, when purists issue fiats about what is or isn't valid in jazz, Gordon declared flatly, ‘jazz is an octopus’—it will assimilate anything it can use. Drawing closer to home, he spoke of his musical lineage: Coleman Hawkins \"was going out farther on the chords, but Lester [Young] leaned to the pretty notes. He had a way of telling a story with everything he played.' Young's story was sure, intrepid, dar­ing, erotic, cryptic. A generation of saxophonists found itself in his music, as an earlier generation had found itself in Hawkins's rococo virtuosity. …\n\nGordon's appeal was to be found not only in his Promethean sound and nonstop invention, his impregnable authority combined with a steady and knowing wit, but also in a spirit born in the crucible of jam sessions. He was the most formidable of battlers, undefeated in numer­ous contests, and never more engaging than in his kindred flare-ups with the princely Wardell Gray, a perfect Lestorian foil, gently lyrical but no less swinging and sure. …\n\nGordon was an honest and genuinely original artist of deep and abiding humor and of tremendous personal charm. He imparted his personal characteristics to his music — size, radiance, kindness, a genius for dis­continuous logic. Consider his trademark musical quotations—snippets from other songs woven into the songs he is playing. Some, surely, were calculated. But not all and probably not many, for they are too subtle and too supple. They fold into his solos like spectral glimpses of an alternative universe in which all of Tin Pan Alley is one infinite song. That so many of the quotations seem verbally relevant I attribute to Gordon's reflexive stream-of-consciousness and prodigious memory for lyrics. I cannot imagine him planning apposite [apt in the circumstances] quotations.”\n\n- Gary Giddins\n\n“Chuck Berg [Downbeat Magazine, February 10, 1977: There's one thing that especial­ly impressed Sonny Rollins and which has always intrigued me. That is the way you lay back on the melody or phrase just a bit behind the beat. Instead of being right on top of the beat with a metrical approach like Sonny Stitt and a lot of the great white tenor play­ers, you just pull back. In the process there are interesting tensions that develop in your music. How did that come about?\n\nDexter Gordon: Yeah. I've been told that I do that. I'm not really that conscious of it. I think I more or less got it from Lester because I didn't play right on top. He was always a little back, I think. That's the way I felt it, you know, and so it just happened that way. These things are not really thought out. It's what you hear and the way you hear it.”\n\n“ON NOVEMBER 7, 1960, DEXTER GORDON signed with Blue Note Records in what was to become one of his most successful relationships with a record company both musically and personally. Until February 8, 1967, Dexter kept in touch with Alfred Lion and Frank Wolff by letter and card. The following examples from their correspondence give some idea of the involvement of Dexter in his recordings and of Alfred and Frank with Dexter as an artist and as a friend.”\n\n- Maxine Gordon\n\n“April 26, 1961 Dear Dexter,\n\nIt was nice talking to you yesterday on the phone. I'll send you the airplane ticket by the end of this week along with exact instructions as to the hotel you'll be staying at, etc. You have to be in New York by Wednesday afternoon or evening. As I explained to you on the phone, I would like to make two sessions. The first one I have planned for Saturday afternoon, May 6th with Horace Parian, piano, George Tucker, bass and Al Harewood, drums. This rhythm section has been working steadily with Lou Donaldson, and, lately, with tenor player Booker Ervin. I have an idea that this will work pretty smoothly as I told you on the phone. I don't want any complicated music; but rather some good standards in medium, medium-bright and medium-bounce tempos. This, of course, should also cover some blues. A slow, walking ballad should also be considered. I think we should keep away from real fast tempos this first one. I would rather emphasize a good standard, played in the right tempo and delivered in a soulful manner, more so than displaying a lot of technique. I'd like to make something that can be enjoyed and played on jukeboxes stationed in the soul spots throughout the nation, I think you know what I mean.\n\nThe second session, which I have planned for Tuesday evening, May 9th, should consist of another rhythm section. Let's see who will be available when you come in. I have Kenny Drew in mind, and maybe a trumpet, Freddie Hubbard, if he's in town. Bring along as much material, including your originals, as you can; and dig into your bag of standards that lay well with you. You might have a few that have not been over recorded lately. I'll do the same on my end here. So the next letter you receive from me will contain your airplane ticket and instructions in regard to the hotel in New York, etc. With best personal regards,\n\n- Alfred Lion”\n\nDexter Gordon: Doin’ Allright [Blue Note CDP 784077 2]\n\nDating back to tenor saxophonist Coleman’s Hawkins’ 1939 virtuoso performance of Body and Soul, the instrument had become almost synonymous with Jazz. Along with Louis Armstrong’s earlier stylings on the trumpet, these two B-flat concert key instruments became the front line foundations of most modern Jazz combos in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nThe more widely recognized exponents of the instrument during this phase of Jazz’s development were John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins and Stan Getz.\n\nAlmost forgotten among a plethora of talented “big horn” players during this period was the huge sound, melodic inventiveness and powerful, pulsating rhythmic phrasing of Dexter Gordon [Sadly, Hank Mobley also falls into this category, although in his case it was more a question of being overlooked].\n\nThanks to Blue Note’s owners, Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff, the operative term in this dynamic was “almost.”\n\nHere’s Ira Gitler notes to the first of Dexter’s Blue Note LPs -\n\nDEXTER GORDON —there is a name to conjure with. Veteran listeners will certainly remember him but younger fans probably will not although he was intermittently active during the '50s.To musicians (especially those saxophonists who have been directly or indirectly influenced by him). Dexter Gordon has always been a highly important player. As the first man to synthesize the Young, Hawkins and Parker strains in translating the bop idiom to the tenor saxophone, he was an important contributor. It is not, however, from a stylistic, historical angle that he has been appreciated. Dexter has always been a direct, exciting communicator of emotions; his big sound and declarative attack are as commanding of attention as his imposing height.\n\nThe owner of an acute harmonic sense, Gordon has never used it to merely run changes accurately. He is a melodist and can also contrast rhythmic figures effectively. His harmonic awareness was a great aid in preparing him to plunge into the new music that was fermenting in the early '40s. Unlike many of his immediate contemporaries, Gordon studied harmony and theory at the age of 13, the same time he took up the clarinet. Due to this, he was able to actively incorporate the beneficial effects directly into his playing as he was growing up. At 15, he started playing alto sax and two years later, in 1940, he quit school, switched to tenor sax and joined the \"Harlem Collegians\" in his native Los Angeles. From this local band he stepped into Lionel Hamptons aggregation in December 1940 and remained with Hamp through 1943. Illinois Jacquet was the principal tenorman and together they were featured on Pork Chops.\"lt was about the only thing I had to play,\" says Dexter.\n\nAfter leaving Hampton, he returned to Los Angeles where he played with the groups of Lee Young (Lester Young's drumming brother) and Jesse Price. For six months in 1944, Dexter worked with Louis Armstrong's band. Then he joined Billy Eckstine's new orchestra and received a real chance to be heard: the tenor battle with Gene Ammons on Blowin' the Blues Away; his own bits on Lonesome Lover Blues and several of the modern jazz instrumental that the band played.\n\nGordon's impact was immediate. You could hear it in the work of his section-mate, Ammons. When he left Eckstine for New York's 52nd Street in 1945, his influence spread like the ripples a large rock makes when it is dropped into a pool of water. Allen Eager's first quartet recordings (Booby Hatch, Rampage) showed that he was listening and Stan Getz was captured temporarily according to such sides as Opus de Bop and Running Water. Of course, like Gordon, these players had been affected by Lester Young, but it seemed that in addition to getting inspiration directly from Pres, they were digging the Gordon translation, too. If a 12-inch, Mercury 78 rpm of Rosetta and I’ve Found a New Baby, cut with Harry Edison, demonstrated that Dexter could get very close to Young, the original version of Groovin' High, made with Dizzy Gillespie for Guild in February of 1945, showed a Gordon who had his own interpretation of the day's material.\n\nGordon worked at the Spotlite Club with Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and Bud Powell and then had his own group at the Three Deuces. The weekly Sunday afternoon sessions at the Fraternal Clubhouse and Lincoln Square Center usually included Dex as part of their all-star line-ups. His presence, before he even blew a note, always had an electric effect on the audience.\n\nGordon returned to the West Coast in the summer of 1946 but not before he had made several recordings with his own groups. He played for two months in Hawaii with Cee Pee Johnson. Then, in California, in the summer of 1947, he and Warded Gray teamed up at concerts, after-hours sessions and for their recording of The Chase. Later that year, it was back to New York and 52nd Street for Gordon but in 1948, he went home again, not to return to Manhattan until the May 1961 trip to record for Blue Note. He revived his association with Gray in 1950 but that soon ended and the next decade was not a very productive one for Dexter. The popularity of \"West Coast\" jazz left little opportunity for his brand of virile music to be heard in Southern California. Then, too, he was fighting personal demons. In the last five years of the '50s, he made only three record dates (two as leader) and worked sporadically in a small group context.\n\nThe '60s are a decade of new promise for Gordon. Through playwright Carl Thaler, he became involved in the West Coast version of Jack Gelber's The Connection. He composed an original score, led the quartet that played it on stage and held down a main speaking role. His success gave him a new confidence and led to a general revitalization.\n\nAlthough his presence has not been directly felt on the jazz scene as a whole in a long time. Dexter has been with us. in part, through the work of John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins, two of the most important instrumentalists to develop in the '50s. Both owe a debt to Gordon for helping them to form their now highly personal styles. It is interesting to hear how Gordon, in turn, has now picked up on developments brought about by the men he originally influenced. Make no mistake, however, about Dexter. He is still very much his own man. His great inner power stands out in these recordings. He breathes maturity in every phrase he plays, his gigantic sound living up to the kind of musical voice one would expect from a person of his god-like dimensions.\n\nA musician of Gordon’s reputation (particularly in the special setting of this recording), playing at the top of his game, will always inspire the men around him to do their best. Here, young Freddie Hubbard, impressive as he has been on Blue Note in the past, adds new, thoughtful qualities to his brassy fire. That this was no ordinary date is evident in every microgroove.\n\nThe rhythm section plays for Dexter, seeming to sense what he wants, following his lead yet never lagging. These three are no strangers to Blue Noters. As the Horace Parlan trio or as 3/5 of the Horace Parlan quintet (with the Turrentine brothers as the horns), they have made several swinging LPs. Presently, they are appearing around New York with tenorman Booker Ervin under the title, The Playhouse Four.\n\nGeorge Gershwin's I Was Doing All Right, the opener and title tune, is stated in a full-toned manner by Gordon at a loping medium tempo. He eases into his unhurried solo with a couple of bows to his old buddy Wardell Gray. Logic, warmth and melody abound. Hubbard plays beautifully and pensively, putting one in mind of Clifford Brown and some of Miles Davis' early '50s thinking. Parlan picks up the mood and spins out his solo in an equally relaxed, thoughtful way, ending with some perfumed chords.\n\nThe way he handles a ballad is one good indicator of a musician's depth. Dexter's You've Changed is a gorgeous piece of meaningful horn-singing by a man who knows what it's all about. Some of the lower register tones remind me of Don Byas, another old Gordon colleague (52nd Street vintage) who influenced quite a few people himself. The upper register and the story told are unmistakably Gordon. Hubbard is inspired again to play a poignant albeit short bit. Parian's even shorter interlude leads back to Gordons tender conclusion. Billie Holiday couldn't have done it any better herself.\n\nFor Regulars Only is a Gordon original with a catchy, contrasting theme. Dexter masterfully demonstrates how to build a solo, climbing up the thermometer, chorus after chorus, until his last one satisfies completely. Hubbard cooks in a brief solo; Parian alternates his stint between single-line and chords.\n\nA marching, skipping, funky blues is Gordon's Society Red. It settles into a steady 4/4 as Hubbard takes an opening solo that beats things up with leaping rhythmic figures and a brightly burning flame of a sound. Again, Gordon builds to a point of climax. Here he does it more slowly than in For Regulars Only, spreading his expansive tone over a longer period of time. Parlan's single-line leads into a blue chordal exploration before George Tucker plucks his only lengthy solo of the set.\n\nIt's You or No One finds Dexter ascending to the upper reaches of his horn, alternating swift flights with rhythmic punching. Freddie is fleet but with underlying substance. After Horace's solo. Tucker walks and Harewood talks as they weave in and out of the ensemble.\n\nAll in all. Dexter Gordon's trip to New York was very fruitful. He renewed old acquaintances, made some new friends, bought a couple of groovy suits at a Broadway clothier and began an association with Blue Note that should prove to be mutually significant.\n\nDexter Gordon is a big man physically and musically. This album is representative of that kind of size.”\n\n- IRA GITLER\n\nNote: Supported by Freddie Hubbard and the Horace Parlan trio. Dexter Gordon began his association with Blue Note with this session, which quickly rekindled his career and ended an eight-year lull. As well as two magnificent readings on standards, it introduced two of his finest and most lasting compositions \"For Regulars Only\" and \"Society Red” which found new life in the film ROUND MIDNIGHT. For this Compact Disc, an alternate take of \"For Regulars Only\" and another Dexter tune \"I Want More” both previously unissued, have been added. Dexter would recut and release “I Want More\" on his next Blue Note album DEXTER CALLING.\n\n- MICHAEL CUSCUNA\n\nDan Morgenstern Sessions Notes from the Boxed Set Booklet -\n\n(A) MAY 6,1961\n\n“For his first Blue Note session, Dexter Gordon is supported by a working rhythm section and a rising young trumpet star.\n\nPianist Horace Parlan, bassist George Tucker and drummer Al Harewood were three-fourths of The Playhouse Four, named for Minton's Playhouse, the once-famed Harlem nightclub where (with tenorman Booker Ervin) they were ensconced as the house band. Parlan, born in Pittsburgh in 1931, started on piano at 12 and wasn't deterred when stricken with polio—he merely compensated for an impaired right hand by developing an exceptionally strong left. A professional from 1952, he first gained notice with Charles Mingus's Workshop (1957-9) and had also worked with Lou Donaldson, the tenor team of Lockjaw Davis and Johnny Griffin, and the Turrentine brothers. (He settled in Denmark in 1973 where he was reunited with Dexter.)\n\nTucker, born in Florida in 1927, had come to New York at 20 to study music at Julliard; turning pro, he worked with saxophonists Earl Bostic, Sonny Stitt and Jackie McLean and was in the house rhythm section at Brooklyn's Continental Club prior to hooking up with Parian. His sudden death of a heart attack in 1965 was a great loss.\n\nHarewood, born in New York City in 1923, first came into view in 1954 with J.J. Johnson and Kai Winding and subsequently worked with Gigi Gryce, Gene Ammons and David Amram; later associations included Stan Getz and Benny Carter.\n\nFreddie Hubbard, born in Indianapolis in 1938, had early classical training, hooked up with boyhood friends James Spaulding and Larry Ridley in his first working group, came to New York in 1960, and soon found himself in demand. Though he'd already participated in Ornette Coleman's landmark avant garde recording \"Free Jazz\" and worked with Eric Dolphy, his orientation was essentially straight ahead and 1961 was also the year in which he joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers.\n\nDexter Gordon \"Dexter Calling\" - The Blue Note Years - Part 3\n\n© Copyright ® Steven Cerra, copyright protected; all rights reserved.\n\n“ … his own date for Savoy on 30 October, 1945, … reveal the saxophonist still identifiably absorbing his influences, although the distinctive compound he was brewing from them is already evident in places. Lester Young's smooth, relaxed ease, Coleman Hawkins's big, rich sonority and projection, and Illinois Jacquet's honking robustness can all be heard behind his playing,\n\nbut his fluidity and harmonic originality are clearly working their way to the surface, ….\n\nWhile unquestionably cast in the emerging bebop idiom, these performances also underline the saxophonist's roots in the pre-bop era. Those polarities of sophisticated harmonic awareness and driving swing remained the basic building blocks of his style, and were a source of a great deal of creative interaction within his playing, both in generating internal tension and subverting expectations. The session also pre-figured what would become another of his trademarks (and something of a bop staple in general), a penchant for inserting quotations from other tunes into the piece he was playing, often for humorous effect. It became an overdone convention (and, in lesser hands, often a way of avoiding the demands of genuine invention), but can be effective when deployed in the right way, and Gordon, while never reluctant to ham it up, was one of its most skilled exponents.\n\nHe was back in the studio with the Benny Carter Orchestra early in 1946, ….\n\nGordon is in full flow on these sides, with that big, authoritative tenor sound which he cultivated throughout his career spilling across the top-rank rhythm section ….\n\nThe fourth cut is his first great ballad performance on disc; there would be many more to come. He seemed to be in particular sympathy with the ballad idiom, both in terms of sonority and expression (although he adopts a wider vibrato here than would subsequently be the case, notably on the alternate take, which may be why it was rejected). Like Lester Young, he had precise ideas on the question of ballad interpretation, including the now familiar notion that familiarity with the lyrics of the song in question is crucial even in a purely instrumental interpretation. It was a theme he returned to often in interviews, and he would sometimes introduce ballad performances on stage by reciting a line or two of the song before playing, while his ballad tempos became ever more cliff-hangingly slow as his career progressed.”\n\n- Kenny Mathieson, Cookin’ Hard Bop and Soul Jazz 1954-1965\n\nWhile the Blue Note 1961-1965 recordings were in progress, Dexter decamped for a two week gig at Ronnie Scott’s London club in 1962. He was so enamored with the European Jazz scene that he decided to stay for a while.\n\nApart from a few brief visits home, “a while” was to last 14 years.\n\nHe settled in Copenhagen, with the city’s Montmartre jazz club as his base.\n\nDexter’s presence attracted the best local musicians, who soon became much more than mere accompanists, but excellent individual soloists in their own right.\n\nIt’s hard to improve on a rhythm section composed of drummer Alex Riel, pianist Tete Montoliu and bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen (aged 18 at the time) and they rise splendidly to the occasion as can be heard on recordings they made at the club with Dex beginning in 1964.\n\n“Gordon was in great form, and his supple, mercurial style, with a tendency to phrase just behind the beat, would have been pretty demanding, but you can tell that Gordon feels at home from the number of outrageous quotations he inserts into his solos and the warm, dry breadth of his tone, clarity of improvised line and sheer, uplifting command of the instrument.” David Gelly, review in The Guardian].\n\nDexter Gordon: Dexter Calling [Blue Note CDP 746544 2] was the second, individual LP to be issued in the Blue Note series.\n\nHere’s Leonard Feather’s notes to the second of Dexter’s Blue Note LPs\n\n“THE first time I saw Dexter Gordon, all of twenty years ago, he was a teen-aged member of the new and at that time very exciting Lionel Hampton band. Because the band's first hit was Flyin' Home, with Illinois Jacquet as the focal point, there was no opportunity at that time to gain an adequate musical impression of Dexter. He was merely the other tenor player in the band, about whom the only noteworthy aspects were his height (even today at 6'5\" he towers above every jazzman except Randy Weston] and his remarkable facial resemblance to the young Joe Louis.\n\nA couple of years later, when the bebop phenomenon had just begun to shake up the whole jazz scene, Dexter reappeared as a member of the wild and wonderful Billy Eckstlne band, in which he had taken over Lucky Thompson's chair. The band's recordings during that potent period were few in number and atrociously recorded, but those of us who were fortunate enough to hear the Eckstine outfit in person can still think back fondly on the profound impression made by the bond and the complete upheaval effected by its soloists, principal among whom were Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Dexter. It was then that followers of the jazz revolution became aware of Dex's status as well as his stature. He was the first major soloist to transfer the characteristics of the new music (bebop, as it was just then beginning to be called) to the tenor saxophone.\n\nFrom that point forward, through a four-year era that proved to be formative and definitive in Dexter's career, Manhattan was his home base. It was in New York that he made his first combo records, with his own group, with Dizzy and with Sir Charles Thompson (featuring Bird); around the same time he was part of the fast-changing small-night-club scene on and off 52nd Street. But at the end of this period, in 1948, Dexter Gordon went back home—to Los Angeles.\n\nDespite his long association with New York music and musicians, Dexter had always regarded Los Angeles as home base. He was born there February 27, 1923, the son of a well known doctor whose patients included Lionel Hampton and Duke Ellington. During his high school years he studied harmony, theory, clarinet and alto. Despite his height, he didn't make a specialty of basketball (\"baseball was my bag,\" he says), and at 17 quit both school and athletics to become a full-time musician.\n\nIt was a complete shock to him when he was catapulted into the big time. \"I thought Marshall Royal was kidding,\" he recalls, \"when he called me up to offer me a job with Hamp's band. I went over to Hamp's pad, and we blew a while, and that was it. We went right out on the road, without any rehearsal, cold. I was expecting to be sent home every night!'\n\nDexter's orchestral experience — the three years with Hampton, six months with the Louis Armstrong big bond of 1944 and 18 months with Eckstine - were invaluable in rounding out his musicianship, but as the big band era began to fade and combos accentuated the trend toward individualism, if became obvious that Dex's future lay in this more personal context. Though he still works occasionally in big bands, such as the sporadically active Onzy Matthews group in Los Angeles, he has spent most of the past decade as a soloist backed by a rhythm section.\n\nWhen Alfred Lion signed him to a Blue Note contract in the spring of 1961, he had been off the scene in the Apple for close to 13 years. All those years away from the center of modern jazz could easily have corroded the style of a less formidable personality, but fortunately in recent years, as Dex points out, there has been an increasing influx of the best modern musicians into the Southern California scene, and it has been less difficult for him to find capable musicians to work with. Nevertheless, when Lion decided to fly him to New York for his first two albums, he found an excitement and stimulus that proved invaluable in bringing out the best in him.\n\nThe first product of his visit, Doin' Allright, with Freddie Hubbard and the Horace Parlan rhythm section, was released on Blue Note 4077. This second session was recorded the night before Dex flew back home.\n\nOne member of the rhythm section on this date was an old friend. Kenny Drew, during a three-year residence in California (1953-6), frequently worked as part of Dex's accompanying team on gigs around Los Angeles.\n\nOf the other two participants, Dexter observes: 'I'd never worked with Paul Chambers before, but I'd met him when he was out here with Miles, and of course, what I'd heard of his work made me very happy at the prospect of having him on this date. And Philly Joe, though I hadn't worked with him since I moved back to California, did play a gig with me once in Philadelphia, when he subbed for Art Blakey in a group I had. Fats Navarro, Tadd Domeron and Nelson Boyd were the others, and Philly at that time was just known as Joe Jones. He was cool that night, but I had no special reaction and no idea he'd become the major influence he is today\"\n\nSoul Sister, the original that launches the first side, is one of the themes Dexter wrote for the score of the Hollywood version of The Connection in which he had an acting, playing and writing role; it is the equivalent of Freddie Redd's Theme for Sister Salvation, composed for the original East Coast production of the Jack Gelber play and recorded by Redd's quartet on Blue Note 4027.\n\nThe opening and closing passages are played in a contagiously swinging 3/4 (Dexter's first recorded work in waltz time), but the main blowing body of the performance is in four Coincidentally, right after making this data, Kenny Draw joined still another company of The Connection for an overseas tour. Dexter, Kenny and Paul, in their solos on this track, all manage to convey the essence of a gospel-tinged soul feel without descending into the bathos that has accompanied too many performances along these lines.\n\nModal Mood, a beautifully conceived original by Kenny, shows several facets of Dexter's development in recent years. Compare this track (or, for that matter, any track on this LP) with some of his earlier work in the bop days, and you will find an extension of his dynamic range as well as his harmonic and melodic resourcefulness. Particularly impressive is the kicking end to his solo just before Kenny takes over. Kenny's facility, too, is brilliantly demonstrated here; there's one sudden run — I'm sure you'll notice it immediately — that is technically amazing and musically startling.\n\nI Want More, the significantly titled Gordon theme that closes the first side, is the West Coast equivalent of O.D. (overdose), for the scene toward the end of The Connection when Leach keels over. Dexter's strength, conviction and masterful sense of building are demonstrated. Philly, after supplying an inspiring backing, is heard in fours with Dex, and has the channel to himself, on the lost chorus before the me-reprise.\n\nEnd of a love Affair, the only pop song in this set, one for which Dex had developed a liking after hearing several singers use it, has some of the most authoritative blowing of the session by all concerned and is Dexter's favorite track.\n\nClear The Dex, a Kenny Drew original, makes impressive use of off-beat pedal-point effects on the dominant. Philly shows how vital his contribution can be at an up-tempo such as this; Paul's solo this time is arco, and Kenny gets into a funky chordal groove.\n\nErnie's Tune is the last of the three themes on this LP from Dexter's Connection score. It parallels Music Forever, in Freddie Redd's score, in the scene triggered by the psychopathic Ernie's wild outburst. \"The interlude here,” says Dex, \"represents Ernie's Jekyll-and-Hyde personality?' This is one of Dex's most attractive tunes, with unusually pretty changes.\n\nSmile was remembered by Dexter as a song he had heard Nat Cole sing; he had no idea, until I pointed it out, that the Chaplin who wrote it is the same Charlie Chaplin who has starred in all the movies for which he has composed original scores. Dexter got into such a fine groove in tackling the vehicle that it was decided to let him retain the spotlight all the way instead of stepping aside for other soloists. It's an electrically energetic performance for which the cooking of this superb rhythm section furnished an ideal complement.\n\nSumming up his feelings about the circumstances preceding this session and the results it produced, Dexter said: \"It was beautiful to be back East after so long. Things are not as competitive, not as intense as in California. Besides, it was a gas to work with Kenny again, and to record with Philly and Paul for the first lime.\n\n\"There were no hassles at all on this date. I couldn't have asked for anything more!' For those who knew Dexter long ago — like the fans who hung up a \"Dexter We Love You\" sign in the hall where he recently staged a Chicago reunion with his old Eckstine band buddy, Gene Ammons — the arrival of this tenor titan on the Blue Note scene is on event rich in both music and nostalgia. For the newer student, too young to have heard him when bebop was in flower, these sides offer an indispensable introduction to a man who, in more than one sense, is a towering musical figure of our time.”\n\n-LEONARD FEATHER (Author of The New Encyclopedia of Jazz)\n\n“Added to this, Dexter Gordon's second Blue Note album, is an original which Dexter titled \"Landslide\" when it was first issued some twenty years after its recording. He explained the title by saying that something about the piece reminded him of tenor saxophonist Harold Land. For this CD release, this tune has been added to complete the session.”\n\n-MICHAEL CUSCUNA\n\nDan Morgenstern Sessions Notes from the Boxed Set Booklet -\n\n(B) MAY 9,1961\n\n“A mere three days elapsed between Dexter's first and second Blue Note dates — obviously the label wanted more. A distinguished trio assembled for the occasion.\n\nPianist Kenny Drew, born in New York in 1928, was a prodigy, performing his debut recital at age 8. While still attending the High School of Music and Art, he worked with dancer-choreographer Pearl Primus. He recorded with Howard McGhee and had the opportunity to accompany Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young and Charlie Parker and make his recording debut on Blue Note prior to moving to the west coast in 1953, where he had his own trio and recorded with Dexter, among others. Back in New York, his associations included Dinah Washington, Art Blakey, John Coltrane, Donald Byrd and Buddy Rich. Shortly after this date, he went to Europe with a production of \"The Connection\" and settled first in Paris, and then, from 1964 until his death in 1993, in Copenhagen, where he often worked with Dexter. Bassist\n\nPaul Chambers, born in 1935 in Pittsburgh, moved to Detroit at 13 and went to school with Donald Byrd and Doug Watkins. He was with Kenny Burrell in 1949 and came to New York in 1955, joining Miles Davis later that year and staying until 1963, when he formed a trio with section mates Wynton Kelly and Jimmy Cobb. In declining health for the final years of his life, he died in 1969.\n\nPhilly Joe Jones was Chambers' colleague in the Miles Davis Quintet until 1958. Born in Philadelphia in 1923, he studied piano as a child; after discharge from military service in 1943, he became involved in music, hanging out with the Heath brothers, making his pro debut with Benny Golson two years later, and playing with many luminaries in his hometown, Dexter among them. After touring with Joe Morris and Johnny Griffin, he came to New York, worked with Tony Scott at Minton's, and spent some seminal time with Tadd Dameron before joining Miles. His last work as a leader was with the group Dameronia. He died in 1985.”\n\nDexter Gordon \"GO!\" - The Blue Note Years - Part 4\n\n© Copyright ® Steven Cerra, copyright protected; all rights reserved.\n\n“Listening to Gordon talk was not unlike hearing him play. His voice, like his sound on the saxophone, was warm, self-assured, deep, and resonant. He also had a way about him, a certain magnetism. One might call it charisma, although these days charisma is often manufactured, and Dexter's brand was natural and genuine. Perhaps one should simply say that he was a charmer. In any event, as he was talking the Vanguard's telephone rang, and since nobody on the club's staff was about, he answered it. \"Village Vanguard. No, it's the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis band tonight. On Tuesday, Dexter Gordon. Who's this? This is Dexter.\" There was a long stretch during which the party on the other end talked and Dexter listened, his grin growing wider and sunnier by the second. \"Why thank you sweetheart,\" he finally said, as suavely as a king acknowledging the adoration of his minions. \"Yes, we'll be here through Sunday.\"\n\nOn the bandstand, Gordon's royal savoir faire was even more evident. He was a striking-looking man, tall and handsome with a smile bright enough to light a room. He announced tunes in a mellow, liquid baritone, often quoting at length from the lyrics to a standard he was about to play. When he finished a solo, he acknowledged applause by holding his tenor saxophone out in front of his abdomen, parallel to the floor, as if he was sharing the adulation with it. But of course\n\nGordon's playing was the most aristocratic thing about him. His sound was huge and encompassing, from his booming lower register all the way up to a rich falsetto range. He was a master of harmonic subtleties and a master of timing. He was a prankster who enjoyed inserting little musical jokes-quotes from \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\" or \"Here Comes The Bride\" into the most passionate improvisations. Above all, he was an architect of sound. His choruses have an ineluctable solidity to them. They are balanced and logical, classical, really, in the best sense of the word. The individual phrases are handsomely blocked out and warmly inflected, but ultimately the stories told by choruses and entire solos are even more impressive.\n\nGordon's music is rooted in the creative ferment of the mid-!940s, when modern jazz erupted onto the scene and brought the swing era to an end. … As early as 1945, when he began making records under his own name, he had his own style together. It was really the first saxophone style to synthesize the towering influences of Young and Parker, and as a style in its own right it influenced just about every musician who subsequently took up the tenor saxophone, not to mention players on other instruments. Among the saxophonists most heavily indebted to Gordon's breakthroughs were Sonny Rollins and, especially, John Coltrane.”\n\n- Robert Palmer, insert notes Dexter Gordon: Homecoming - Live at The Village Vanguard [Columbia C2k 46824]\n\n“In May 1961, Dexter Gordon visited New York for the first time in over twelve years. During the week he was here, he recorded two albums for Blue Note, Doin' Allright and Dexter Calling. These LPs, the main purpose of his visit, were warmly received by all segments of the jazz fraternity.\n\nA year later, he again journeyed from California to New York, this time as a more permanent resident. I use the term \"more permanent\" because Gordon has not remained in New York constantly. It became a base of operations for playing excursions to Boston, Cape Cod and Rochester, and, at the end of August, his port of embarkation for England and continental Europe.\n\nDuring the summer, Dexter did play a number of gigs in New York: a weekend at the Coronet; a Monday night at Birdland; an afternoon at the Jazz Gallery; a concert at Town Hall; and various one-nighters and one-afternooners. Everywhere he met with the same reaction — unbridled enthusiasm. He drew the kind of response that you know is not mere hand service. At the Jazz Gallery, I observed this in an audience that included many younger fans — kids who were not applauding him because he was the fabled Dexter Gordon of the past whom they were supposed to automatically revere. He reached them directly with the expansive emotion in his playing.\n\nLove, warmth and sheer joy are all present in Gordon's sound and attack. It can be heard and felt in the tremendous drive of his uptempo work, the width and depth of his ballads, or anywhere in between. All these affirmative qualities are reiterated in this album. There is also evidence of change, harmonically, in the playing of a man who was known for his harmonic awareness back in the mid-Forties. This is the kind of record that has you starting again from side one, track one, immediately after you have played both sides in their entirety.\n\nDexter's astute choice of a fine rhythm section was not accidental. These three players worked with him several times during the summer of 1962.\n\nSonny Clark is a real pro. His accompaniment is alive but never intruding; his solos are articulated with a consistent clarity and contain personal, melodic ideas.\n\nButch Warren is rapidly establishing himself as one of the best young bassists on the New York scene. His lines swing along with no doubt as to the definition of the notes.\n\nBilly Higgins doesn't beat the drums; he plays them like the musical instrument they collectively are, when in the right hands. His cymbal sound is exhilarating; his ear forever alert.\n\nAs a unit, Clark, Warren and Higgins have also been heard to advantage in Clark's Leapin' and Lopin' (BN 4091) and Jackie McLean's A Fickle Sonance (BN 4089).\n\nGo' gets going with a piece of Cheese Cake, a minor-key pattern reminiscent of Topsy. Dexter soars like a condor over the Andes, with grandeur and great staying power. [It’s based on Tickle Toe, for many years the Lester Young feature with Count Basie’s Band.]\n\nHis strength is present on I Guess I’ll Hang My Tears Out to Dry, a seldom-done ballad he wisely revived, but it is strength with tenderness, carried by a beautiful, masculine sound that is neither Hawkins nor Young, but Gordon.\n\nJerry Valentine's Second Balcony Jump was in the libraries of both the Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine bands. Gordon was in the Eckstine band that played it, but it was Gene Ammons (not Gordon, as indicated in the liner notes on an EmArcy LP reissue) who took the solo on the original National recording. The construction of Dexter's first solo is marvelous and builds to a climax gradually. There's a semi-quote of Jimmy Heath's C.T.A. cleverly worked in. Then Clark plays a blithe, flowing solo before Dex comes back for a second, shorter, but again climactic summation that leads into part of Valentine's old arrangement and an abrupt ending.\n\nThe Latin backing for the melody statement of Love for Sale may not be exactly bossa nova, but the saxophone is certainly \"boss\" tenor. When the solos commence, the rhythm section shifts into 4/4. Dexter's playing is as broad-shouldered as he is; Sonny's piano is delicate, yet always on solid ground.\n\nWhere Are You is another lovely ballad that, fortunately, has not been played into the ground. That huge Gordon sound, once described by Michael James as \"cavernous,\" is again matched by the emotional content of his playing.\n\nThe closer, Three O'clock in the Morning, may seem like a strange piece of material for a modern jazzman to play, but Don Byas and Slam Stewart recorded it in the Forties during 52nd Street's heyday. Dexter begins in a loping 2/4 that slides into 4/4. He injects wry humor with quotes from Five O'clock Whistle and Take Me Out to The Ball Game (at Three O'clock in the Morning?) while blowing forcefully all the time in a substantial medium groove.\n\nGordon is a great advertisement for live jazz. When he really starts \"stretchin’ out\" on a number, and his long, firmly anchored legs begin vibrating rapidly from side to side, the intense swing of his music has a natural visual counterpart. It's true that you cannot see him in this album but you can feel the impact of his personality as it is poured into his music.\n\nThis session was not recorded in a nightclub performance but, in its informal symmetry, it matches the relaxed atmosphere that the best of those made in that manner engender. Everyone was really together, in all the most positive meanings of that word. It was so good that Blue Note put these four men in the studio again, two days later. We'll be hearing that one in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, proceed directly to Go.! You won't collect $200.00, but you will get a monopoly of Melody Avenue, Swing Street and Inspiration Place.\n\n-IRA GITLER\n\nDan Morgenstern Sessions Notes from the Boxed Set Booklet -\n\n(F) AUGUST 27,1962\n\n“Dexter had recorded with Butch Warren and Billy Higgins on the May 28 Herbie Hancock session — his only sideman date for Blue Note — and definitely liked what transpired. The two also worked hand-in-glove with Sonny Clark, and the result was some joyous music making.\n\nButch (real first name Edward) Warren was born in Washington, D.C. in 1939. By the time he was 14, he was playing in his father's band, and soon with other leaders, including Stuff Smith and the Gene Ammons-Sonny Stitt team. He came to New York in 1958 with Kenny Dorham and quickly became a Blue Note favorite, recording with an array of the label's leaders: Dorham, Jackie McLean, Donald Byrd, Hancock, Joe Henderson, Clark, Grant Green, etc. In 1962, he toured in Europe with Slide Hampton, and in 1963 he joined Thelonious Monk, visiting Europe again and also Japan. But health problems caused him to return to his hometown, where he's been only sporadically active.\n\nBilly Higgins, born in Los Angeles in 1936 into a musical family, was playing with R&B bands at 12, and a bit later on in a group led by his contemporary, Don Cherry. Before long he'd worked with such players as James Clay, Carl Perkins, Walter Benton, Slim Gaillard and Dexter Gordon. In 1957, he joined Red Mitchell's quartet and not much later, with Cherry, became involved with Ornette Coleman, with whom he recorded and came to New York. By 1962, his credits included Monk, Coltrane, and Sonny Rollins.”\n\nDexter Gordon \"A Swingin' Affair\"- The Blue Note Years Part 5\n\n© Copyright ® Steven Cerra, copyright protected; all rights reserved.\n\n“Los Angeles-based saxophonists Dexter Gordon, Teddy Edwards, and Wardell Gray rank among the finest soloists of their generation, and all three played a seldom acknowledged role in defining a distinctive bop sound for the tenor sax, liberated from the Hawkins mannerisms displayed on most early modern jazz tenor outings. Of these three, only Gordon would go on to enjoy widespread fame, albeit after twenty years of relative obscurity. His early recordings for Savoy from the mid-1940s and infrequent releases during the 1950s demonstrate Gordons freewheeling energy and his bellowing foghorn tone—one of the most distinctive signature sounds in modern jazz—while later sessions for Blue Note present the mature statements of a major soloist. Few were listening, however, and Gordon moved overseas, where he spent most of the 1960s and 1970s. Only upon his return to the United States in 1976 did the tenorist, now in his mid-fifties, begin receiving the accolades and rewards his contributions warranted.”\n\n- Ted Gioia, The History of Jazz, Third Edition\n\n“Generations in jazz, among fans and musicians, are short (rather than the traditional thirty years, they may span only four or five), and the distance between them is sometimes seemingly insurmountable. A whole lifetime seems to separate us from the man who, although only 34 or 35, remembers vividly the nights of seeing Bird, Bud, Monk, Diz, on the historic 52nd Street scene.\n\nIt is rare indeed that the members of one generation get the opportunity to share directly the experience of another. Given the chance to hear one of the old giants [Dexter Gordon], we went. Any doubts we may have had about the legends of his charm and prowess were dispensed as soon as he raised his horn to his lips. We had been waiting to be captured by just such a man — a man of his warmth, his \"show biz\" manner of handling us. his pleasure in being with us. And once he started to play...one young tenor man, enjoying some current vogue, laughed delightedly to no one in particular, and said, \"The old lions are telling us cats who're still running the jungle.”\n\n- Barbara Long, insert notes to Dexter Gordon: A Swingin’ Affair [Blue Note CDP 784133 2]\n\nBoth Barbara Long, who wrote the insert notes for this third in a series of Dexter Gordon early 1960s Blue Note releases, and Dan Morgenstern, who annotated the session notes for the boxed set booklet, translate Soy Califa, the opening the title of the opening track as “I’m Caliph” or “I’m the Caliph,” whereas Maxine Gordon in her Dex bio translates it as “I’m from California in Los Angeles Spanish.”\n\nHaving lived in the greater Los Angeles area most of my life, I think the latter is the more accurate meaning.\n\nAs Maxine further explains regarding the significance of these Blue Note recordings in Dexter’s career:\n\n“Dexter continued to record for Blue Note through the first years of his fourteen-year sojourn in Europe. To this day, those classic recordings are still collected by all serious jazz fans throughout the world. Dexter was right when he said that he believed they would hold up in the history of jazz.”\n\nDexter Gordon: A Swingin’ Affair [Blue Note CDP 784133 2]\n\n“I hesitate to enter grounds already covered by writers more experienced than I. Both Leonard Feather and Ira Gitler have introduced Dexter Gordon's previous Blue Note albums (Doin’ Allright, Dexter Calling, Go!) with personal reminiscences and professional evaluations of his significance in their jazz experiences. They and other critics have assessed his musical contributions and have placed him high. Gordon was in the forefront of the '40s swing era; he was the first to translate Parker's revolutionary concepts to the tenor; he was among the most colorful figures in a period sparkling with them. It was a true measure of his dynamic, warm beauty that they should miss him so acutely during his 12 year hiatus on the West Coast, a decade when he was seldom heard, when his kind of tenor playing was temporarily out of vogue.\n\nTheir response to the return of his live performances, his charming, authoritative showmanship, his ability to generate excitement through his manner and music, was a reaction not just to him but against years of not having him. Those were years during which many musicians appeared not to be interested in themselves and the men in their groups, much less the audience. The '60s and Dexter brought back direct communication on the stage, communication which reached out to his audience. One major musician sitting in the Jazz Gallery in New York that first night said, \"Love, man, I never felt so much love in one room.”\n\nDex's old fans were grateful for his return. He was giving them back the best of the good old days. More than that, he vindicated their memories. The music was as wonderful as they had remembered.\n\nPerhaps even more grateful were those of us in another jazz generation, those of us in our early or mid-twenties. Generations in jazz, among fans and musicians, are short (rather than the traditional thirty years, they may span only four or five), and the distance between them is sometimes seemingly insurmountable. A whole lifetime seems to separate us from the man who, although only 34 or 35, remembers vividly the nights of seeing Bird, Bud, Monk, Diz, on the historic 52nd Street scene.\n\nIt is rare indeed that the members of one generation get the opportunity to share directly the experience of another. Given the chance to hear one of the old giants, we went. Any doubts we may have had about the legends of his charm and prowess were dispensed as soon as he raised his horn to his lips. We had been waiting to be captured by just such a man — a man of his warmth, his \"show biz\" manner of handling us. his pleasure in being with us. And once he started to play...one young tenor man, enjoying some current vogue, laughed delightedly to no one in particular, and said, \"The old lions are telling us cats who're still running the jungle.”\n\nHe told us more than that. In it and subsequent appearance's, he still had a lot to tell tenor players about their instruments. Gordon’s sound is large, larger even than his 6 foot 5 inch frame would lead one to expect. It is no denigration of his technical facility to say that much of the scope of his sound, the warmth of his tone, the musicalness of his harmonic and melodic inventiveness, seem to come from his personality. The tenor, looking so small cupped in his hands, seems merely the nominal source of all that glory. Nominal or not, the instrument is a beloved friend, and Dexter appreciates the entire entity, lower and upper registers, prettiness and harshness. (Too many men seem to concentrate on just one aspect of their horn.) He brings new life to tunes, and obviously loves variety. Blues, ballads, up tempo tunes, originals, hoary pops that even he has to repair drastically for the occasion, make up his extensive book.\n\nDuring his live performances on the East Coast he pleased all the generations he reached. He brought joy back to listening by giving us his joy in playing. He was as current as today. Instead of being a charming old timer he built sweeping solos too suspenseful to be predictable.\n\nAfter satisfying us for a while, it was only fitting that he completed his renaissance by visiting Europe for the first time. Awaiting him were fans who had been playing his old records for years before receiving his recent releases. Enthusiastic response there extended his one-month engagement to a year.\n\n…\n\nFortunately Dexter made two albums before leaving. Both were made within a week before his departure, and with the same personnel. The first. Go!, has been rated 5 stars by the Down Beat reviewer, and is regarded by many as a classic in the making.\n\nAnd if that album won't hold you till his return, A Swingin' Affair should. It is of the same extraordinary quality, but has the quieter, less pressing appeal of a group whose initial excitement upon meeting has turned into fruitful relaxation among old friends. The rhythm is a conventional 4/4, the support of sidemen solid, and the solos, meant to enhance, never detract from the tenor. If there is experimentation, it is not the painful searing kind; it is certain and mature, the kind one expects from men who know their business.\n\n…\n\nThis album should appeal to all the jazz generations who dig Dex. It should also bring a few new ones into the fold. Considering that Down Beats Critics Poll has just named him New Star of the Year, he should have several more to swing for.\n\n-BARBARA LONG\n\nDan Morgenstern Sessions Notes from the Boxed Set Booklet -\n\n(G) AUGUST 29,1962\n\n“McSPLIVENS, a minor blues by Dexter named for his dog, gets this encore session under way in style. The nice tempo—not too fast, not too slow—settles the splendid rhythm trio into a well-oiled groove, and Dexter's eight choruses are yet another object lesson in how to tell a story. The penultimate chorus is a salute to Prez. Sonny Clark follows with a five-chorus statement that adds up to a definition of bebop piano, and then Butch Warren goes for two, with that great sound that recorded so well. Dexter uncorks some stop-time stuff, and the closing ensemble is right on the mark.\n\nTHE BACKBONE is by Butch Warren, and he sets it up-a catchy little AABA riff piece with some minor-major changes. Dexter takes off in a minor mood (shades of \"Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise\"), and it's clear that he's \"on,\" as they used to put it, becoming increasingly intense. Clark follows, seamlessly, with some Monkish touches, and then the composer takes over, backed by Higgins only, except when piano peeps in on the bridge. Dex takes it out, with interplay to the fore. These cats are together!\n\nSOY CALIFA is Dexter's, and he announces the title (\"I'm the Caliph\") over samba rhythm, brought on by the effervescent Mr. Higgins. An ABBA structure with interlude, the piece employs 4/4 rhythm on the bridge. Dexter works off the Latin beat, asking if we've ever seen a dream walking; the empathy between him and the drummer is a joy to hear. Clark's crisp outing finds him at home with the Latin feel, and then Higgins works out, demonstrating, among other things, the power of repetition. A spirited ride!\n\nUNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG was the song that put the Andy Kirk band on the map, commercially speaking, when they recorded it in 1936—Pha Terrell's vocal made the ladies swoon. It became a Kansas City favorite, known as \"The Slave Song.\" But it had been around since 1931, when the songwriting team of Alberta Nichols and Mann Holiner penned it for the show \"Rhapsody In Black;\" three other songsmiths revised it five years later. Clark's piano brings it on, and he supports Dexter ever so tastefully as the tenorman, emotionally involved from the start, creates a marvelously warm romantic tale, proclaiming himself a prisoner of love. Clark's half-chorus maintains the level of inspiration (lovely voicings,) and then Dex re-enters over the rainbow, setting up a wonderful climax (love's prisoner once again.)\n\nYOU STEPPED OUT OF A DREAM, a sinuous melody by Nacio Herb Brown, was introduced in the 1941 film \"Ziegfeld Girl,\" and became a favorite of Charlie Parker. The introduction mixes 4/4 and Latin, with Higgins again splendid, but the exposition moves smoothly into 4/4 alone. Dexter reveals the changes, and the rhythm section gives him inspiring support. Clark burns one, as close to Bud Powell as he got, and Warren offers an exceptional bass solo. Dexter steps back in on a Cuban sidewalk, his footing awesomely secure, for a half chorus, and then recapitulates the theme with Latin underpinnings, concluding with an effective repeated phrase. Once again, a classic interpretation of a great tune.\n\nDON'T EXPLAIN, introduced in 1946 by Billie Holiday, who wrote it with Arthur Herzog, is another instance of Dexter's fondness for singers—a trait he shared with Lester Young—which inspired him to adapt essentially vocal vehicles to instrumental purposes. Here he captures Holiday's mood of bittersweet resignation to perfection; he almost speaks the bridge, and later evokes a cantorial feeling. Clark's bridge solo and support are exemplary, as is the work of Warren and Higgins (hear the drummer's closing cymbal touches.) In ballad performances such as this one, Dexter inhabits the highest plateau of creativity.”\n\nDexter Gordon \"Our Man in Paris\"- The Blue Note Years Part 6\n\n© Copyright ® Steven Cerra, copyright protected; all rights reserved.\n\n“Gordon feels that the absence of big bands today has cheated the younger musicians. \"A pet peeve or gripe of mine is the lack of big bands, which are so essential for young musicians,\" he said. \"The experience you get in a big band, you don't get anywhere else. It develops your tone, your intonation. The discipline that you get in a big band, you just don't get in a small group. Slurring, attacking, phrasing—in a small group it's at a minimum.\"\n\nThe sound that Gordon produces is strong proof of the validity of his preachment. Separated from his attack, which itself is quite varied and a formidable tool, it serves as a powerful means of communication. British writer Michael James has called Gordon's lower-register sound \"cavernous\" — and, to be sure, there are some beautiful formations in that cavern.\n\nHis middle range can be lighter, toward Lester Young; or harder, toward Charlie Parker; the upper reaches contain that eerily beautiful wail that almost seems to emanate from his throat. Dizzy Gillespie's Blue 'N Boogie, recorded in early 1945, was Gordon's first small-group recording after he hit Fifty-second Street. His solo contains the \"scream\" that ten years later showed up in John Coltrane's work with the Miles Davis Quintet.\n\nSome think that more than Gordon's sound was affected by his Hampton days. Michael James, in referring to the Savoy records Dexter made in 1945-1946 (Dexter's Deck, Long, Tall Dexter, etc.), wrote: \"It is tempting to see in the early part of Gordon's career, especially his spell with Hampton, influences that helped to shape his style. The forthright, even-noted swing and square-cut turn of phrase to be heard on his 1945 and 1946 sessions for Savoy recall the regular melodic outlines of Hampton's improvisation rather than the shifting accents of Lester Young, or even the comparatively symmetrical patterns of a Chu Berry. It seems likely that he took Illinois Jacquet as an exemplar. Besides the strong tonal resemblance, Gordon was very ready to indulge in the repeated-note motifs that were part of Jacquet's stock-in-trade.\n\nWhether these similarities were coincidental or not, Gordon's achievement was to present, as early as 1946, a taste of Parker's harmonic richness in a framework that was no less than conservative in its attachment to the beat, and to do this in a way logical enough to make for a style that was individual, integrated and unfailingly cogent.\"\n\n- Ira Gitler, Jazz Masters of the 40s\n\nIn 1955, Gordon recorded again for the first time in three years. Two LPs were done for Bethlehem, one with Stan Levey and the other under his own name, called Daddy Plays the Horn. The third album, Dexter Blows Hot and Cool, was for Dootone. In a 1961 Jazz Monthly article, Michael James commented on some of the performances on these 1950’s LP's; \"All four demonstrate Gordon's quicksilver swing, his audacity in the upper register, his tonal power and the apt use he makes of inflection whenever he contrasts a sustained note with those complex, elbowing phrases he manages with so expert a sense of time,\"\n\n- Ira Gitler, Jazz Masters of the 40s\n\nAs Michael Cuscuna explains in the postscript to the CD release of Dexter Gordon: Our Man in Paris [CDP 7 46394 2] which was originally issued by Blue Note as an LP in 1963: “This album was supposed to have Kenny Drew on piano and feature a program of all new Gordon compositions. Due to various circumstances. Bud Powell replaced Drew. Since he would not play any new compositions, a set of standards and jazz classics was quickly chosen during the rehearsal. The result is one of Dexter Gordon's finest albums and some of Bud's best playing in the sixties.”\n\nThis time around, the distinguished Jazz author and critic Nat Hentoff does the insert notes honors to Our Man in Paris which Maxine Gordon in her Dexter bio asserts “was to become one of Dexter’s most popular recordings and it remains a classic to this day.” In my opinion, Nat is at his descriptive best in terms of his description of the elements and ingredients that make Dexter’s style so distinctive.\n\n“THE renascence of Dexter Gordon has been one of the most sanguine events in recent jazz history. After a brilliant early career with Lionel Hampton, the Billy Eckstine big band and Charlie Parker, the tall, forty-year old Californian slid into limbo during most of the 1950's. It was known that he was in California, but he had ceased to be a presence on the jazz scene. Musicians remembered him — as is indicated by his influence on the evolving styles in those years of Sonny Rollins anil John Coltrane — but most of the jazz public and the critics had either forgotten Gordon or assumed that his career had evaporated. As British critic Daniel Halperin noted when the resurgent Dexter played London in 1962, the second career of Gordon \"has been an unusual transformation because usually, on the jazz scene, when they fade away they hardly ever come back. And there was a time when . . . Dexter Gordon was definitely near vanishing point.\"\n\nThe road back started in 1960 when Dexter Gordon wrote the music for and performed in the west coast edition of Jack Gelber's The Connection. The next year, Alfred Lion of Blue Note invited Dexter to return to New York for recordings. The albums since — Doin’ All Right (Blue Note 4077), Dexter Calling (Blue Note 4083), Go! (Blue Note 4112) — have firmly re-established Gordon as a major voice in jazz.\n\nDcxler is now based in Paris, where this album was recorded in May, 1963. Shortly after the session was made. Dexter was asked by a reporter for the French monthly, Jazz, whether he thought he was playing better today than at previous stages in his career. \"Certainly,\" Dexter answered. \"I'm much more lucid and have a stronger sense of equilibrium. My musical conception is much surer. I know where I'm going now. I am just as spontaneous as I used to be, but I know much more about music. I've traveled a long road in jazz ... I can't regain the time I've lost, but I've learned from ihe experience and it's not impossible to shape a future which will have profited from the time that was lost.\"\n\nDexter was once asked, \"What would you like most to see printed behind your name?\" His answer was: \"I'd like to see something about the fact that I'm constantly searching for ways to improve.\" The persistence of that search has been evident in all of his recent Blue Note recordings, including this one. Alan Beckett, a critic for the British Jazz Journal, observed during a Gordon stay in London in 1962: ''As one of the first musicians to make constructive adaptations of Parker's harmonic developments to the tenor saxophone, and as one of the greatest influences upon many of the most productive musicians in contemporary jazz, his historical importance is very great. But he is not only a link, and although his recent records indicate that he has borrowed to some extent from his own disciples, his playing over here shows him to be a mature and consolidated stylist, from whose work great satisfaction can be derived.\"\n\nIn this Paris album, Dexter's colleagues have a long history as a unit in that city. Kenny Clarke, the key initial shaper of modern jazz drumming, has been an expatriate in Paris since 1956. Bud Powell has lived there since 1959. Pierre Michelot is one of the most respected bassists in Europe, and he has worked and recorded with a wide range of visiting American jazzmen —- among them, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis. In 1959, Clarke, Powell and Michelot formed a trio, the Three Bosses, which worked together for a long time. This, therefore, is not a date with a pick-up rhythm section. Dexter is heard here in the context of a rhythm team which long ago learned to fuse each of its elements into a flowing unified whole.\n\nFrom the start of Scrapple From The Apple, the sheer strength, the virility of Gordon's horn is unquenchably evident. His tone is assertive but warm; his beat is enveloping; and his conception indicates, as\n\nFrench writer Demetre Ioakimidis notes that \"Gordon has always emphasized swing and melodic development\" in his playing. Now, however, there is increased, irrepressible confidence and more venturesome and diversified use of pitch and texture as expressive devices. Furthermore, he sets up and sustains a momentum in a performance such as Scrapple From The Apple that is fiercely, contagiously exciting. There are no hesitations, no skating on technical runs while ideas are being regrouped. Dexter plays as if he could hardly contain all he wants to say. Beneath the marked power, there is also the surge of even more latent force. But Powell's solo is fluent and well-organized, confirming a recent report by \"Cannonball\" Adderley that Bud, when he is stimulated by his musical surroundings, remains an absorbing pianist.\n\nWillow Weep For Me illustrates what Alan Beckett has called Gordon's \"gruff lyricism.\" In this performance, moreover, that lyricism is unusually incisive. This could be termed a dramatic reading of the ballad. There is no flaccidity in Gordon's ballad work. It contains as much surging strength as do his up tempo swingers, but the strength is disciplined into spare, penetratingly lucid patterns. The overall shape of Gordon's solo is remarkably cohesive, a further indication that while Gordon remains as spontaneous as ever, the increased emotional maturity and musical acumen of the added years have channeled that spontaneity into more memorable and more substantial shapes. There is also much more of a speech-like quality to his phrasing. This is not simply an exercise in technical fluency. Dexter's interpretation of Willow Weep For Me is in the vintage jazz tradition of telling a striking, personal story. The same is true of Bud Powell's statement which is also spare and tensile. Michelot has matured from his earlier recordings, and his solo in Willow Weep For Me is deep-toned, cleanly executed and imaginative.\n\nBroadway, once a vehicle for Lester Young (the strongest early influence on Gordon's playing) is an intriguing, concise history of one major trend in jazz tenor playing. There are traces of Lester as well as signs of the later Gordon style which affected Rollins and Coltrane. In addition, annealing all these cross-influences, is the present Gordon who has absorbed these elements, including what he has chosen to adapt from his disciples, into a powerfully individualistic way of expression. Again, as in Scrapple From The Apple, there is the overwhelming presence of the man — the climate of crackling emotional excitement which never lets up but rather increases in intensity. Note too, in some of the exclamatory uses of pitch, how Gordon has found his own way into at least part of the terrain of the current jazz avant-garde. Throughout the track and the album, spurring the soloists and keeping the time crisply alive, is the superbly lithe drumming of Kenny Clarke. As for Bud, in addition to his own ebullient solo, listen to the echo of Count Basie he brings in at the close.\n\nStairway To The Stars is another aspect of Gordon's balladry. At first gentler and more introspective than Willow Weep For Me, the performance reveals the warmth and depth of tone Gordon can draw from the horn. And yet, the spine of the interpretation remains steel-like. It is this quality — a firm sense of direction and what I referred to before as sheer strength of emotion — which most instantly identifies anything Gordon does. And as is also characteristic, there is the sure, judicious choice of notes. The lesson of economy was one of the most valuable Gordon learned from Lester Young, and it is a lesson to which he has returned during his current renascence. Bud Powell's solo is almost song-like in its particular quality of lyricism and discloses an especially serene side of Powell's current work.\n\nThe final A Night In Tunisia is a summation of the renewed Dexter Gordon — the soaring assurance, the delight in improvising, the unflagging resourcefulness and the bursting ardor of his attack. Gordon has said that he is happier now than he has ever been before, and those high spirits are pervasively clear in this album. It is a happiness, however, which is not likely to lead to coasting. At the core of Dexter's commitment to music is a restless desire to learn and to express more of what he feels. As he told one British writer after having scored a notable triumph in London, \"No, I'm not wholly satisfied at the moment; my career is just beginning.\"”\n\n—NAT HENTOFF\n\nDan Morgenstern Sessions Notes from the Boxed Set Booklet -\n\n(H) MAY 23,1963\n\n“In Blue Note's history, Frank Wolff, while certainly significant, is usually viewed as that of a junior partner to Alfred Lion. In this instance, however, Frank was in the producer's chair and came up with one of the jewel's in the label's crown. This is a jazz summit meeting. Dexter was no stranger to fellow jazz masters Bud Powell (his junior by more than a year) and Kenny Clarke (his senior by nine) and indeed had recorded with both before. (Powell was on Dexter's second session as a leader, in early 1946, and Clarke was present three years later when Dexter recorded with Tadd Dameron for Capitol.) At this point in time, all three were at various stages of the expatriate experience. Dexter was at the threshold of what would become a long European sojourn; his love affair with Denmark had begun in the fall of 1962. Bud Powell was in his fifth year as a resident of France and 14 months away from his fateful return to America. Kenny Clarke, who'd first visited Europe in 1938 as member of the Edgar Hayes band, and again in 1948 with Dizzy Gillespie, spent much of the period from 1949 to 1951 in Paris, and in the fall of 1956 permanently settled in France He'd encountered bassist Pierre Michelot during his first Paris period. The Frenchman, born in St. Denis in 1928, started on piano at 7 but switched to bass in 1946 due to his growing interest in jazz. He soon became one of Europe's best jazz players, working and recording with compatriots and visitors, including Dizzy, Monk, Miles and Lester. In 1959, he joined forces with Powell and Clarke as the house trio and rhythm section at the Blue Note Club in Paris, where they were billed as \"The Three Bosses.\" Needless to say, they were well equipped to provide for Dexter's needs.\n\nOUR LOVE IS HERE TO STAY was George Gershwin's last completed song, introduced posthumously in the 1938 film \"Goldwyn Follies.\" Our distinguished foursome takes it at an easy up-tempo, Dexter parsing the melody in his distinctive manner in the exposition, then moving into variations with a very mellow sound (he may have been experimenting with a softer reed at this date.) By the third chorus, Klook is getting with it, and things are warming up as Dex gets quotatious. Powell shows no hesitation in his two choruses, his phrases flowing with good ideas (as usual, we can hear Bud singing along with himself.) An auspicious beginning, although this track did not make it to the original album.\n\nBROADWAY, a swing instrumental written for the Basie band by Henri Woode [composer of \"Rosetta\") and recorded in 1941 with a splendid Lester Young solo, starts off with Klook's hi-hat and snare stuff (like all great drummers, he has a distinctive sound.) Dexter states the theme, with Michelot's solid walk behind him, and then invents through six choruses; in the third, he quotes from his famous 'The Chase,\" then trots out some modal things. The way he clinches his fourth and fifth chorus is worth noting, and Klook certainly hears it, commenting approvingly, Dynamic contrasts are a feature of that fifth chorus, and in the next, Dexter encounters and gives chase to a stronger from paradise. Bud is unmistakably himself in his two-chorus solo, launching some strikingly percussive phrases. Dexter picks up on the last of these and then trades educated eights with the drummer, makes up a riff, restates the theme, and plays tag with Bud's echoes of Basie. Bud could still play happy music!\n\nSTAIRWAY TO THE STARS was originally an instrumental piece by Matty Malneck and Frank Signorelli, introduced in 1935 by Paul Whiteman as \"Park Avenue Fantasy.\" Mitchell Parrish put words to it in 1939, and young Ella Fitzgerald made a memorable recording. After Bud's intro, Dexter makes love to the melody with an enveloping sound, adding some wry asides to remind us that, like all great artists, he remains the unmoved mover. Using the full range of the horn, he once again almost sings the last eight bars of the exposition, then launches seamlessly into variations that truly merit the often misused term \"improvisation;\" there's abstract thinking involved here. Bud uses space imaginatively in his 16 bars and Dexter returns with the bridge, building to an impassioned climax. Saxophone mastery!\n\nA NIGHT IN TUNISIA opens with the \"traditional\" introduction, and Dexter\n\nlaunches Dizzy's theme with a mixture of 4/4 and Latin from the rhythm section. The standard interlude and break follow, Dexter hoisting himself into his solo with some modal turns. Moving along like a jet-propelled steamroller, he uncorks a bit of \"Summertime,\" some Coltrane licks, near-Eastern phrases, and some \"freak\" horn effects. By the third chorus, he's in the upper ranges and makes forceful use of repeated phrases. A recapitulation of the interlude sets up Bud's break — a terrific one — and a solo that hints at his affinity for Monk. Klook solos next, before a great recap of the theme and high-note cadenza. A great version of this oft-recorded jazz standard.\n\nWILLOW WEEP FOR ME, Ann Ronnell's 1932 gem, was written while she was romantically involved with George Gershwin and makes wonderful use of one of his trademarks—the repeated note. Our men in Paris take it at a slightly brighter tempo than usually applied to this blues-ballad, opening with an arranged riff. Dexter soon turns to paraphrase, with an uncommon buzzy edge on his tone, and then just lets the ideas flow, with marvelous continuity and logic; it may have been Paris that made him think of \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,\" and the Seine that brought \"Ol' Man River\" to his mind. Bud, to no great surprise, proves himself a great blues player. Michelot's solo spot shows off his fine sound and articulation (no piano fills behind him.) Dexter returns with a transformed bridge, brief theme recap, and the opening riff, perfect for fading.\n\nSCRAPPLE FROM THE APPLE, Charlie Parker's contrafact of \"Honeysuckle Rose,\" with an ad-lib bridge based on rhythm changes, opens with the standard introduction, then takes off at a fine clip — Michelot is a great time keeper. By his second chorus, Dexter creates a riff, repeats it, transposes it, kneads it; by the third, he's floating, by the fourth, he's smoking. The fifth highlights continuity, with some Prez stuff added; on the sixth, he has fun answering himself; on the seventh, Prez returns, with Sonny Rollins in tow; by the eighth, he's swinging like crazy, and on the ninth, he's riffing away, mixing in some modal stuff, and fashions a bridge to end all bridges—what a ride!!! One doesn't envy Bud, having to follow this eruption, but he shows that he can still handle a challenging tempo, if not quite like once upon a time, and that Bird-like left hand sparkles in the second chorus. (Let's not forget Bud's comping throughout the session.) A chorus of tenor and drum exchanges follows, with Klook in fine fettle, and we end traditionally.\n\nThis session closed with a trio version of LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE, which can be heard on Bud Powell's own Blue Note boxed set.\n\nDexter Gordon \"One Flight Up\" - The Blue Note Years Part 7\n\n© Copyright ® Steven Cerra, copyright protected; all rights reserved.\n\n“Whether or not he was given credit, Dexter Gordon is the man who wove an important piece into the great tapestry of the modern tenor saxophone style. Time, which has given proof of his importance, happily has not robbed him of his talents. His most recent work only enhances his position as a jazz master.”\n\n- Ira Gitler, Jazz Masters of the 40s\n\nRecorded on June 2, 1964 at the CBS Studios in Paris and released the following year, One Flight Up is the last of the recordings released by Blue Note during the five year association with Dexter which began in 1961.\n\nAs with its European predecessor Our Man in Paris, this one also finds Francis Wolff. Alfred Lion’s partner at Blue Note, stepping out from his usual role behind the scenes to assume the duties of producer.\n\nAt the time of its release, Dexter had settled into his ex-patriate status in Europe with Copenhagen as his base and an almost artist-in-residence status at the city’s primary Jazz club - The Montmartre\n\nDexter elaborates further about the importance of both Denmark and the club, which featured Jazz from 1959-1976, in the following insert notes to One Flight Up by the distinguished Jazz author and critic, Leonard Feather.\n\nAs is the case here, often with Leonard the reader gets treated to an explanation of how the music is constructed in terms of keys, time signatures, chord progressions, modulations and the like, all of which serves to enhance the listener’s awareness and pleasure.\n\n“In July 1964 an informal and mutually stimulating discussion by Dexter Gordon, Kenny Drew and two other expatriate jazzmen was published in Down Beat. The subject was \"American in Europe.\" Perhaps the most significant remark in the entire round-table talk was made by Dexter. \"Since I've been over here,\" he said, \"I felt that I could breathe, and just be more or less a human being, without being white or black...I think the Scandinavian audiences are very discerning. In fact, my biggest experience in communicating with audiences has been here in Copenhagen.. .The audience here is very 'inside.' This is their capacity.\"\n\nThe intelligent interest shown by their listeners, and the almost total lack of racial prejudice, are not the only factors that have lured so many American musicians to the Continent and kept them there in recent years. An equally vital attraction is the opportunity to work steadily in a single job without having to shift around constantly from club to club or city to city every other week.\n\n\"I have played for months on end at the Montmartre in Copenhagen,\" said Dexter recently. \"That's been more or less my headquarters ever since I moved over here in 1962. Now I've never in my life played three or four months continuously at a place in the U.S. The opportunity to work regularly in the same spot gives you the kind of feeling you need to stretch out, relax, and at the same time develop musically without having those job-to-job worries hanging over your head.\"\n\nKenny Drew had some similar observations to make along these lines, in the Down Beat report. Asked what he had gotten out of living and playing in Europe, he replied, \"In a way, I've found myself, because I've had to be more responsible to myself and for myself … I'm my own man. I've been taking care of business myself — something I never did in the States … Musically, I've found myself by working so long and so much. I can\n\nthink more, act more, be more, I guess. My mind is functioning properly now.\"\n\nObviously, conditions and reactions like these must be reflected in the music. Dexter's first overseas album,"
