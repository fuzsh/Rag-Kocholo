        "text": "I’ve been playing 2nd violin with the DCO for approximately 13 years. I went to watch their concerts much longer before I joined the group as I started learning to play violin. I grew up learning classical piano (like many kids). After I had my first child, I wanted to explore learning and playing another music instrument and violin got my pick.\n\nThe DCO allows me to be part of an orchestra group and developing and maturing my violin skill. This community group is an amazing platform for me to keep up playing violin. There are plenty number of phenomenal musicians in the group that I can learn and improve my musicality.\n\nI love being active - physically, mentally, and spiritually. Outside of playing with the DCO, I do daily yoga (yep, 7 days a week), biking, hiking, kayaking, paddle boarding, rock climbing, and been in love with Argentine Tango dancing for a few years now. I also started learning Japanese Taiko drumming that I found so fascinating - not merely musically, but also spiritually.\n\nI have one teenage daughter who’s a senior at Pioneer High School, and currently is busy with college applications.\n\nI go to my birth country every summer to visit my family in Bali, Indonesia. Overall, exploring various places around the globe is my favorite thing do.\n\nMy violin is not quite a full size as my fingers are relatively a tad short to play a full size. I’ve got a customized 7/8 size.\n\nFor the first 3 years of retirement, my husband (Anthony) of now 40 years & I were in the position of taking care of ailing parents, then handling their affairs. Now we're settling into a new home & looking to do regular retirement stuffs. We've always enjoyed traveling and camping, so we're hoping to ramp that up a little bit. We bought a 1990 motorhome last year that had been stored, thankfully inside, that is in really good shape & is getting safety & routine maintenance right now. This will replace travel trailer camping for the most part, although I do have a pull behind I'm still using for some girl's trips. And we've done car trips & cruises and will continue those periodically.\n\nMy flute often goes with me. I feel like the pied piper as it tends to draw people in when we're camping. But, as I said, I love playing and these are opportunities for me to noodle around on pieces other than what's programmed for our concerts.\n\nWe also inherited a 110 acre farm. No livestock, just barn kitties and crop fields a local farmer leases. We'd considered getting some livestock, but it does conflict with our plans to travel more. We have some wooded acreage we can hunt in (yes, I hunt) and gather firewood (yes, I run chainsaws & other various power tools, as well as the tractor and the mini- excavator *this, not very proficiently, haha).\n\nMy husband is retired from City of Ann Arbor field services. We have one daughter, Jillian. She's just turned 32 this year. She works from home in Lansing as tech support for Solimar, a company based out of San Diego. We have indoor pets; one rescued, very affectionate Boxer/Catahoula mix & 2 independent & feisty tabby cats that believe breakfast should be at 4 am. And we currently have one highly energetic grand-pup and a very laid back grand-kitty.\n\nEver since I moved to Dexter in 1989 I had wished (idly) for a place to play orchestral repertoire so it was a dream come true when Don Parrish started Dexter Community Orchestra in 2005. I had not met Don but he was my hero already because he started the string program in Dexter schools. The timing was not great for me as I had just moved houses, was president of the Dexter Rotary Club and had my hands full with two school-age kids. I took a hint from my dear husband Jim and made some time in my schedule to join DCO in its second season.\n\nFor me, the best part of playing with DCO is getting to spend a couple hours every week where I have to be totally 'in the moment'. I have to empty my mind of all my other concerns and concentrate on staying in sync with the group and doing justice to the music. It's very energizing!\n\nThere are probably other places I could get the musical experience but DCO has a real sense of community and caring that I cherish. It's a bit corny but I like to say \"Community\" is our middle name. DCO members are very supportive of one another and the organization.\n\nAt home I enjoy practicing violin and piano, and I watch YouTube a lot—mostly musical things, funny videos, and travel videos. I also like downhill skiing in the winter—I first learned it as a child during a Christmas trip to Grand Rapids, got better at it in Japan, and now I usually go to Mount Holly.\n\nI was born in Taiwan and lived there until I graduated from junior high. While there, my family moved quite often, so we lived in Tamsui, Taipei, Hsinchu, Sanchung, and Zhongli; I attended Hsinchu International School, then Taipei Adventist American School. Musically, my parents started me on piano lessons when I was in 1st grade and then, when my father discovered I had perfect pitch, on violin in 2nd grade. I joined the children’s section of Taipei New Century Orchestra in 4th grade and became a member of its junior section in 7th grade. During summer return trips to the US, I went to Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp for the first time after 6th grade. Almost all of my early musical training was in Chinese.\n\nAfter moving to Ann Arbor in 2016, I played in Pioneer High School’s Symphony Orchestra for four years. I also entered the UM’s String Academy, and from 2018-2020 I played in MYSO. In the summers from 2017-2019, I played in Blue Lake’s Advanced Chamber Orchestra (I would have played in 2020, too, but Covid hit). I also had the chance to play in the Michigan Youth Festival Orchestra in Kalamazoo in 2018.\n\nI’m on the autism spectrum, and reading and writing are very difficult for me (my father is helping me to write this), so my parents and I decided I would go to an occupational school, Michigan Career and Technical Institute (MCTI). But the Covid pandemic hit, so I more or less just sat at home for a year after graduation. I finally was able to enter MCTI when it reopened in 2021, and I studied “pharm tech,” but the place was still under very strict Covid controls, and the whole experience was unpleasant—I left after two months. I am now working at the Kroger Store on Maple."
