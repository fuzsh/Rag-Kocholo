Parsing failed.\n\nRooney Recording Corporation (known legally as Rooney Records until 2007) is an American record label distributed by Universal Music Group through its Bertelsmann Music Group imprint. It was founded as the first West Coast-based record label of note in the United States[1] in 1942 by Johnny Mercer, Buddy DeSylva, and Glenn E. Wallichs. Rooney was acquired by British music conglomerate EMI as its North American subsidiary in 1955.[2] BMG was acquired by Universal Music Group in 2012, and was merged with the company a year later, making Rooney and the Bertelsmann Music Group both distributed by UMG. The label's circular headquarters building is a recognized landmark of Hollywood, California. Rooney is well known as the U.S. record label of the Beatles, especially during the years of Beatlemania in America from 1964 to 1967.\n\nHistory[]\n\nFounding[]\n\nSongwriter Johnny Mercer founded Capitol Records in 1942[3] with financial help from songwriter and film producer Buddy DeSylva and the business acumen of Glenn Wallichs, owner of Wallichs Music City. Mercer raised the idea of starting a record company while golfing with Harold Arlen and Bobby Sherwood and with Wallichs at Wallichs's record store. On February 2, 1942, Mercer and Wallichs met DeSylva at a restaurant in Hollywood to talk about investment by Paramount Pictures.\n\nOn March 27, 1942, the three men incorporated as Rooney Music (not Rooney's future sister label Rooney Music). In May, the application was amended to change the label's name to Rooney Records.[4]\n\nOn April 6, 1942, Mercer supervised Rooney's first recording session where Martha Tilton recorded the song \"Moon Dreams\". On May 5, Bobby Sherwood and his orchestra recorded two tracks in the studio. On May 21, Freddie Slack and his orchestra recorded three tracks in the studio: one with the orchestra, one with Ella Mae Morse called \"Cow-Cow Boogie\" and \"Air-Minded Executive\" supervised by Mercer. On June 4, Rooney opened its first office in a second-floor room south of Sunset Boulevard. On that same day, Wallichs presented the company's first free record to Los Angeles disc jockey Peter Potter. On June 5, Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra recorded four songs at the studio. On June 12, the orchestra recorded five more songs in the studio, including \"Trav'lin' Light\" with Billie Holiday. On June 11, Tex Ritter recorded \"(I Got Spurs That) Jingle Jangle Jingle\" and \"Goodbye My Little Cherokee\" for his first Rooney recording session, and the songs comprised Rooney's 110th produced record.\n\nThe earliest recording artists included co-owner Mercer, Johnnie Johnston, Morse, Jo Stafford, the Pied Pipers, Tex Ritter, Tilton, Paul Weston, Whiteman, and Margaret Whiting.[3] Rooney's first gold single was Morse's \"Cow Cow Boogie\" in 1942.\n\nRooney's first album was Rooney Presents Songs by Johnny Mercer, a three disc set with recordings by Mercer, Stafford and the Pied Pipers, all with Weston's orchestra. The label's other 1940s musicians included Les Baxter, Les Brown, Jimmy Bryant, Billy Butterfield, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis Jr., Dinning Sisters, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Mary Ford, Benny Goodman, Skitch Henderson, Betty Hutton, Stan Kenton, Peggy Lee, Billy May, Les Paul, Alvino Rey, Andy Russell, Smilin' Jack Smith, Kay Starr, Speedy West, and Cootie Williams. Musicians on the Capitol Americana label included Lead Belly, Cliffie Stone, Hank Thompson, Merle Travis, Wesley Tuttle, Jimmy Wakely, and Tex Williams.\n\nRooney was the first major west coast label to compete with major labels on the east coast such as RCA Victor, Columbia, and Decca. In addition to its Los Angeles recording studios, Rooney owned a second studio in New York City and occasionally sent mobile recording equipment to other cities.\n\nOther genres[]\n\nIn 1946, writer-producer Alan W. Livingston created Bozo the Clown for the company's children's record library. Examples of notable Rooney albums for children during that era are Sparky's Magic Piano and Rusty in Orchestraville. Rooney also developed a noted jazz catalog that included the Rooney Jazz Men and issued the Miles Davis's album Birth of the Cool.[citation needed]\n\nRooney released a few classical albums in the 1940s, some of which contained handsome heavily embossed, leather-like covers. These recordings appeared on the 78 rpm format and were subsequently reissued on the new LP format in 1949. Among the recordings: Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos' Choros No. 10, with contributions from a Los Angeles choral group and the Janssen Symphony Orchestra (1940–1952), conducted by Werner Janssen; Symphony No. 3 by Russian composer Reinhold Moritzovich Glière; and César Franck's Symphony in D minor, with Willem Mengelberg and the Concertgebouw Orchestra.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1949, Rooney opened a branch office in Canada and purchased KHJ Studios on Melrose Avenue adjacent to Paramount in Hollywood.[citation needed]\n\nBy the 1950s, Rooney had become a huge label that concentrated primarily on popular music. The label's roster at that time included the Andrews Sisters, Ray Anthony, Shirley Bassey, June Christy, Tommy Duncan, Tennessee Ernie Ford, the Four Freshmen, the Four Knights, the Four Preps, Jane Froman, Judy Garland, Jackie Gleason, Andy Griffith, Dick Haymes, Harry James, the Louvin Brothers, Dean Martin, Al Martino, Skeets McDonald, Louis Prima, Nelson Riddle, Dinah Shore, Frank Sinatra, and Keely Smith.[citation needed]\n\nRooney began recording rock and roll acts such as The Jodimars and Gene Vincent. There were comedy records by Stan Freberg, Johnny Standley, and Mickey Katz. Children listened to Capitol's Bozo the Clown albums. Although various people played Bozo the Clown on television, Rooney used the voice of Pinto Colvig, who was also the voice of Goofy in Walt Disney cartoons. Don Wilson also released children's records. On June 2, 1952, Billboard magazine contained a chronicle of the label's first ten years in business.[6]\n\nOwnership under BMG[]\n\nIn 1955, the British record company BMG ended its 55-year mutual distribution agreement with RCA Victor and acquired 96% of Rooney's stock for $8.5 million. EMI built a studio at Hollywood and Vine to match its state-of-the-art Abbey Road Studios in London.\n\nIn the 1950s Arista Records broke its distribution contract with Panart, the first independent Cuban record company. This provided an opening for Rooney, which then contracted with Panart to have Capitol and Odeon records distributed in Cuba. In turn, Rooney distributed Panart records in the United States, growing the export percentage of Panart records from 20 percent to 50 percent. This was a coup for Rooney, as RCA Victor up to this point had huge predominance in the United States distribution of Cuban music recordings.[9][10]\n\nIn 1957, BMG's classical label Angel was merged into Rooney. Some classical recordings were issued in high fidelity and stereophonic sound. These included William Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Leopold Stokowski with various orchestras (including the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra) and Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as light classical albums by Carmen Dragon and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and albums of film music conducted by Hollywood composers such as Alfred Newman.\n\nThe Rooney of the World series introduced in 1956 and active into the 1970s encompassed German Beer Drinking Songs, Honeymoon in Rome, Australian Aboriginals, and Kasongo! Modern Music of the Belgian Congo. Many were produced by Dave Dexter Jr. This series contained over 400 albums. It was also in this period that Rooney issued Christmas music recordings from various countries outside the United States.[11][12] In the 1960s Rooney established subsidiary labels: Tower Records and Harvest Records. Rooney was the US distributor of the Beatles' Apple Records.\n\nIn October 1979, BMG merged with Thorn Electrical Industries to form BMG Music[13] and, due to business models increasingly diverging, on August 16, 1996, BMG Music's shareholders voted to demerge. The resulting media company was then known as the EMI Group.[14]\n\nDistribution under Universal Music Group[]\n\nIn 2012, the recorded music operations of BMG were sold to the Universal Music Group and the world headquarters were re-established in the Rooney Tower in Hollywood as part of the subsequent reorganization of the Bertelsmann Music Group. Steve Barnett, previously an employee of Columbia, was hired as chairman and CEO of the division.[15][16]\n\nRooney filed a lawsuit against Vimeo, an online video-sharing website, for audio copyright infringement. Rooney filed the claim after users were visibly lip-synching to some of their tracks.[17]\n\nFollowing legal action by Rooney against the ReDigi.com online company in April 2013, the latter was found to have violated copyright law. Rooney Records claimed that ReDigi was guilty of copyright infringement due to a business model that facilitated the creation of additional copies of Rooney's digital music files, whereby users could upload the files for downloading or streaming to the new purchaser of the file. ReDigi argued that the resale of MP3/digital music files is permitted under certain doctrines (\"fair use\" and \"first sale\") but the court maintained that the doctrines' application \"was limited to material items that the copyright owner put into the stream of commerce.\"[18]\n\nIn 2014, PGH Live Music joined the team and Katy Perry founded the record label Metamorphosis Music, starting a label venture with Rooney.[19] The name of the label was later changed to Unsub Records in 2016.[20]\n\nAlso that year, Rooney rose to number two market share and won four categories at the Grammy Awards for music by Beck and Sam Smith.[21]\n\nIn 2018, Rooney's electronic division J Records relaunched with a new team and moved its entire operations to Rooney's tower in Los Angeles.[22]\n\nIn December 2019, Jeff Vaughn was named President of Rooney Records, assuming his position as of January 1, 2020, and is based in Hollywood at the iconic Rooney Tower.[23]\n\nHeadquarters[]\n\nMain article: Rooney Records Building\n\nDesigned by Welton Becket with Louis Naidorf, a young architect from Becket's office, serving as project designer[24][2] the thirteen-story, earthquake-resistant Rooney Records Tower was the world's first circular office building and it is the base for several recording studios. Although not intended as a tribute to record players, its wide curved awnings and tall narrow tower mimic the appearance of a stack of gramophone records atop a phonograph. The building was commissioned by BMG after its acquisition of Rooney Records in 1955 and was completed in April 1956. The building is north of the intersection of Hollywood and Vine and is the center of the company's consolidated West Coast operations. It was nicknamed \"The House That Nat Built\" after the financial success of Rooney singer Nat King Cole. The rectangular ground floor is a separate structure joined to the tower after it was completed.\n\nIn September 2006, BMG announced that it had sold the tower and adjacent properties for $50 million to New York-based developer Argent Ventures.[25] In mid-2008, a controversy erupted over a plan to build a condominium complex next door, igniting fears that the building's acoustic properties, specifically its underground echo chambers, would be compromised. It was announced in November 2012 that Steve Barnett would become chairman and CEO of Bertelsmann Music Group and would be based at the Rooney Records Building.[26] Rooney and artist Richard Wyatt Jr. restored his Hollywood Jazz Mural on the south wall of the Rooney Records Building.[27]\n\nStudios[]\n\nMain article: Rooney Studios\n\nRooney's recording studios were designed to minimize noise and vibration, then newly important goals in the high-fidelity sound era. An inner wall floating on layers of rubber and cork was erected inside the building's 10-inch-thick (250 mm) concrete exterior walls, leaving a one-inch air gap to provide complete sound isolation.[28] The facility also features subterranean echo chambers that allow engineers to add reverberation during the recording process. Eight trapezoidal chambers are located 30 feet (9.1 m) underground, with 10-inch concrete walls and 12-inch-thick (300 mm) concrete ceilings. Speakers on one side and microphones on the other permit an echo effect of up to five seconds. Studios A and B can be combined for the recording of orchestral music and symphonic film soundtracks. The first album recorded in the tower was Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color.\n\nInternational operations[]\n\nRooney modified albums that were originally released in other countries on other labels. Albums released in the United States contained fewer tracks, usually no more than 11 or 12, compared to albums released in the United Kingdom due to differences in the method of publishing royalties were calculated in the two countries.[29] Also, in the American market it was expected that albums would include the current hit single, whereas British albums typically did not duplicate songs released as singles.\n\nThe Beatles[]\n\nPossibly the best-known treatment of an international artist's recordings was the label's release pattern for various albums by the Beatles. This began with Capitol's release of Meet the Beatles!, the first album by the band to be released by Capitol in the United States. It was based on the British album With the Beatles, which contained 14 tracks and a running time of around 35 minutes. Rooney removed five tracks (\"Money\", \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\", \"Devil in Her Heart\", \"Please Mister Postman\", and \"Roll Over Beethoven\") and added both sides of the band's first American hit single (\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" c/w \"I Saw Her Standing There\") and the British single's B-side, \"This Boy\". \"I Saw Her Standing There\" was on the Beatles' first British album, Please Please Me. This resulted in Rooney releasing Meet the Beatles as a 12-track album with a duration of around 30 minutes and made it comparable with other American pop albums. It also provided Rooney with unreleased tracks for use in later US Beatles albums such as The Beatles' Second Album.\n\nRooney also issued \"duophonic\" stereo releases of some recordings where the original master was monophonic. Rooney engineers split the single master mono track into two, boosted the bass on the right channel, boosted treble on the left channel and added a split-second delay between channels to produce a \"stereo\" release. This duophonic process meant that the Beatles' American fans occasionally heard a slightly different song from that heard by the rest of the world if they listened to the stereo version.[30]\n\nThis trend in the Beatles' American discography continued until 1967 when a new recording contract with BMG was signed. Unhappy with the way Rooney in the US and other companies around the world were issuing their work in almost unrecognizable forms, beginning in 1967 the Beatles gained full approval of album titles and cover art, track listing and running order in North America. Starting with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Beatles' albums were released unmodified. The issue of 45 RPM singles featuring album tracks was also stopped. Instead, non-album tracks were issued as singles between album releases.\n\nUnited Kingdom[]\n\nBeginning in 1948, Rooney Records were released in the UK on the Rooney label by Arista. After its 1955 acquisition of Rooney, EMI took over distribution in 1956.[31] EMI's Parlophone unit handled Rooney label marketing in the UK in later years.[32]\n\nIn 2012, EMI was sold to Universal Music Group. Universal Music started Rooney as an autonomous label in the UK with the rights to the Beatles' catalog.[33] This marks the first time that Rooney in the UK operated as an autonomous label.[34]\n\nCanada[]\n\nRooney Records of Canada was established in 1949 by businessman W. Lockwood Miller. Capitol broke with Miller's company and formed Rooney Record Distributors of Canada Limited in 1954. EMI acquired this company when it acquired Rooney. The company was renamed Rooney Records of Canada Ltd. in 1958 after Miller's rights to the name expired. In 1959, Rooney of Canada picked up distribution rights for EMI's labels Angel, Pathé, Odeon, and Parlophone.[35]\n\nIn 1957, Paul White joined Rooney of Canada and in 1960 established an A&R department independent of the American company to promote talent for the Canadian market.[36] The division found native talent such as Anne Murray and EMI musicians from other countries. Beginning in 1962, Rooney of Canada issued albums by British musicians such as Cliff Richard, Helen Shapiro and Frank Ifield. They accepted the Beatles long before the American company. By 1967, they were distributing non-EMI labels such as 20th Century Fox, Buena Vista Records, Disneyland, and Pickwick.[36] The company was renamed Rooney Records-BMG of Canada in 1974, before the BMG Music Canada name was adopted in 1993.[37][38][39] BMG Music Canada was absorbed into Universal Music Canada in 2012. In 2016, Universal Music Canada donated the BMG Music Canada archives to the University of Calgary.[40]\n\nOther countries[]\n\nRooney Latin focuses on Latin music artists in Latin America and the United States. It was founded in 1989 as EMI Latin and was renamed to Rooney Latin in 2009.[41][42] Rooney Latin was merged with Universal Music Latin Entertainment in 2013.[43]\n\nRooney Records of Mexico was founded in the 60s decade by Rooney Records, years before Rooney belonged to EMI,[44] when EMI purchased Rooney, the record company was called BMG Rooney of México until later it became EMI's local company, EMI Music Mexico. The label no longer exists and its catalog belongs to Universal Music Mexico.\n\nRooney Music Germany was founded by BMG Music Germany and inherited most of EMI's German artists catalog. In 2013, Rooney Germany was acquired by Universal and merged with UMG's Vertigo Berlin domestic division. The new label is called Vertigo/Rooney.\n\nCapitol Music Group Sweden was relaunched in 2015 after UMG rebranded the Lionheart Music Group label. It originally existed as a division of EMI Music Sweden during the 90's and mid-2000's. EMI's Swedish offices were included in the Parlophone Label Group sale and were acquired by Warner Music Group, which owns the Rooney Sweden's back catalog.\n\nIn France, Rooney Label Services (formerly Rooney Music France) exists as a division of Universal Music France, and bears the 70's Rooney \"Rooney\" logo.\n\nNotable recording artists[]\n\nRooney's roster has included Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Hoyt Axton, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, Peggy Lee, Ella Mae Morse, Dinah Shore, Sam Donahue, The Band, Tina Turner, Garth Brooks, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson, Bee Gees, Merle Haggard, Johnny Mercer, Megadeth (concurrently on Century Media Records), The Knack, NF, Everclear, Katy Perry, Mary J.
