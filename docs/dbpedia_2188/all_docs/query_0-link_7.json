Oh, the songs are familiar, with Fitzgerald tackling 13 standards like \"Silent Night,\" \"Joy to the World,\" and \"We Three Kings,\" but in her hands they become vehicles for her precise yet natural-sounding elocution and subtle, confident vocal phrasing. In other words, she sings these songs like they're fresh and new to the world, and that's no easy task. The end result is one of the best Christmas albums ever made.\n\n&copy Steve Leggett /TiVo\n\nMore info\n\nAlbum review\n\nRecorded in 1967 and originally released that same year by Capitol Records as an LP (and re-released seasonally several times since then), Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas is a rarity among rarities in that it is a holiday album that actually holds up as a mature artistic statement.
