It should come as no surprise that vocalist Ella Fitzgerald was a natural when it came to interpreting these timeless songs.\n\nRecorded in 1967, \"Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas\" would focus exclusively on hymns rather than the largely secular material of her earlier \"Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas.\" Teaming up with arrangers Grace Price and Robert Black, and conducted by Ralph Carmichael, Fitzgerald sees herself accompanied by a mix of different configurations, ranging from small instrumental groups to full SATB choirs. These arrangements have an almost chamber-music feel to them at times, evoking a genteel warmth that is highly appropriate for the holiday season. Although hers could never be mistaken for an operatic voice, Fitzgerald's performances on each track showcase an unmistakable reverence for the source material in addition to her flawless intonation and naturally gorgeous voice. It is clear that these songs were important to Fitzgerald, and she treats them with an appropriate level of reverence.\n\nThis publication has been prepared from the original score and the set of parts used during the recording session. We hope that this arrangement provides you and your audience with holiday joy and happiness!\n\nHere are the arrangements used by Ella Fitzgerald during her recording sessions for Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas, in a complete set at nearly 25% off of retail!\n\nRegardless of one's personal religious backgrounds, Christmas hymns have an undeniable beauty to them that lends to the heavy nostalgia that they continue to invoke to this day.
