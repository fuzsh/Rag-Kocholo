        "text": "I'm afraid that you might have never seen this one, from another original Ella album from the same period?\n\nI too like the Gene Grant artwork. Won't be going crazy over it anytime soon, mind you, but it's pleasant to the eye, and intriguing to the mind ... Of all four covers by Grant, I like the one for the Jon Hendicks album the best, and I like the one for Ella's album the least. But even that unicorn cover is okay with me.\n\nI agree that the covers of the reissues are bad in different ways. And in similar ways, too: all of them are, to a greater or lesser degree, lazy pastiches. Overused photos of Ella are tacked-on to scenarios or diagrammatic designs that bear no relation to the original context in which the photos were taken/used. The one that bothers me most is the re-drawing used for the 1982 Polygram reissue LP. It cheapens the original to the nth degree.\n\nAnd 100% with Recordbulimic on all the points above.\n\nI can agree that the cover looks bizarre, but I wouldn’t go as far as to say that it does nothing to evoke a sense of the album’s contents. Think of the already quoted statement of purpose, which appears in the back cover: “mindful that Christmas albums normally emphasize the religious and the solemn, Ella chose in this to stress the festive aspect of the season …” Doesn’t that animal in the album’s front cover look festively colored to you? It does to me; his body reminds me of various Christmas accessories that have a similar look. And he is very much in the spirit of the season, what with his peaceful and friendly offering of a flower? (Unless he’s eating it ... but I don't think so.) Oh sure, he is an unicorn -- not a reindeer, not even a donkey -- but just because the poor beast was begotten in immemorial times, predating St. Nick and Jesus Christ, there’s no need to discriminate and cast him aside. If Mr. Unicorn wants to join in on the festivities (gingerly showing up with a floral peace offering), let him in! Christianity has gained another convert!\n\nSeriously -- the point is that the drawing might be bringing something appropriate to the table, after all (“the festive aspect”) ... however tenuously.\n\nHere's another point.\n\nWould it help if you were to think of this album not so much as a Christmas piece but as a (not-fully-realized) children’s songbook? To me, the album’s drawing looks like child’s work, and the album’s tracks are similarly imbued in a child-like spirit. By many accounts, Ella remained a child through her entire life, and adored children. For these reasons, I wouldn’t be surprised to learn one day that the album grew out of a desire on Ella’s part to record a LP of children’s songs (as had been done by some of her peers, such as Nat King Cole years before and, about half a year earlier, June Christy). Were we to pursue this line of thought, we could speculate that Verve might have shifted the project’s direction from a children's songbook to a topic more immediately marketable — i. e. , Christmas (and romance).\n\nStill not convinced? That’s okay. I have not fully convinced myself, either. I was just throwing ideas out there …\n\nActually, I can think of a third point that, as far as speculative explanations go, would carry far more weight. Will hopefully get to it later today, since I've run out of time for the time being."
