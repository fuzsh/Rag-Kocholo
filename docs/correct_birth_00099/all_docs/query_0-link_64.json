        "text": "Liverpool Town Hall\n\nListed Grade I\n\nLike The Guildhall in London, Liverpool Town Hall, High Street, Liverpool L2 3SW was at the centre of the city's trading activity.\n\nThe Town Hall dates from 1749 and was designed by John Wood of Bath. The building has an exterior decorative frieze showing African faces, elephants, crocodiles and lions - references to the slave trade where Liverpool gained much of its wealth. All of the city's mayors between 1787 and 1807 were involved in the slave trade.\n\nMore about Liverpool Town Hall\n\nThe house was built for William’s father, John Gladstone and stands as a merchant town house in one of Liverpool’s well-preserved Georgian streets.\n\nJohn Gladstone (from 1764 to 1851), made his fortune investing in West Indian plantations. As a result his wealth increased from £40,000 in 1799 to over £500,000 in 1828.\n\nJohn Gladstone began trading in sugar and cotton in 1803. He purchased several estates including the Belmont estate in Demerara, Guyana and the largest one Vreedenhoop, which had 430 slaves. Throughout the 1820s John Gladstone ignored the growth of the anti-slavery movement.\n\nWilliam Gladstone used his maiden speech in the House of Commons in 1833 to argue against the immediate emancipation of slaves. After 1834, when slavery was abolished, the Gladstone family received over £90,000 in compensation.\n\nMore about 62 Rodney Street\n\nAt 57, Parr Street, Liverpool L1 4JN Thomas Parr built an elegant warehouse behind his townhouse. It is thought to have originally stored iron. Iron goods were transported aboard slave ships like the Parr to West Africa where they were traded to buy enslaved Africans.\n\nThe building later became home to The Royal Institution from 1817 to 1848. The institution, established by Liverpool merchants in 1814, was founded for the pursuit of literature, science and the arts. Many of the men who established it were linked to slavery, either as traders or owners of plantations.\n\nMore about 57 Parr Street"
