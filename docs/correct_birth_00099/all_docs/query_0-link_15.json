[1]. William was educated at Eton and Christ Church College, Oxford. [2] He first entered Parliament in 1832 as Tory member for Newark. [3]\n\nWilliam Gladstone married Catherine Glynne at Hawarden in Flintshire, in a 'double' wedding ceremony with her sister Mary, on the 25th of July 1839,[4] [5] [6] and they were blessed with eight children.\n\nGladstone, who was a Liberal, served as British Prime Minister on 4 separate occasions:\n\n1868 to 1874\n\n1880 to 1885\n\n1886 to 1886\n\n1892 to 1894\n\nQueen Victoria described him as a \"half-mad firebrand\" while to a large part of the British working classes he was the \"Grand Old Man\". He declined an earldom in 1885.\n\nAfter he retired he founded a library in Hawarden. This was the first and, so far, the only library set up by a British Prime Minister. He gave over £40,000 in 1895 for the building and, together with his daughter he wheeled 32,000 books from Hawarden Castle over to the new Library. He put them all onto shelves himself using his own cataloguing system. Gladstone's Library was known until 2010 as St Deiniol's Library. [1]\n\nThe Right Honourable William Ewart Gladstone passed away on the 19th of May 1898, at Hawarden Castle in Harwarden, Flintshire, Wales, aged 88, from cancer, which started behind the cheekbone and spread across his body. [7] and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Probate on his Will was granted to his three sons on 2 September 1899[8]\n\nFootnote\n\nWilliam Gladstone's views on slavery and the slave trade have received little attention from historians, although he spent much of his early years in parliament dealing with issues related to that subject. His stance on slavery echoed that of his father, who was one of the largest slave owners in the British West Indies, and on whom he was dependent for financial support. [9]\n\nHe supported compensation for slave-owners, the system of apprenticeship for ex-slaves, and the defence of the West India interest over such matters as sugar duties. For a detailed examination of his views on slavery, see Roland Quinault, ‘Gladstone and Slavery’, The Historical Journal, 52 (2) (2009), pp. 363–83.[10]\n\nMichael Thompson notes that The International Slavery Museum has good information on this subject.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Citing this Record \"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:J9MH-SBW : 11 February 2018, William Ewart Gladstone, 29 Dec 1809); citing , index based upon data collected by the Genealogical Society of Utah, Salt Lake City; FHL microfilm 0093872, 0093873, PLUS.\n\n↑ Joseph Foster.
