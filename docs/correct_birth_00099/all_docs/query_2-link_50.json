The death of Mr. Gladstone\n\nwill occasion throughout the Empire and\n\nbeyond its borders a shock not less severe\n\nbecause in the nature of things it was against\n\nprobability to anticipate a, modi longer life\n\nfor one who had attained to all but four soon\n\nyears and ten. The etory is well known tnas\n\na lady was once indulging in the presence of\n\nJobn £right in An expression of diat-violfln?\n\nanimosity which political opponents co\n\nfrequently inspire, \"Madame/* intwrnpt^fl\n\nMr. Bright, \"let me counsel you to take your,\n\nlittla boy to Bee Mr. Gladstone in order,\n\nthat when be is an old man he' may\n\ntell his children and grandchildren\n\nthatio has seen the greatest Englishman he is\n\never likely to look upon.\" The story is sym\n\nbolicalof the spirit in which everyone, irre\n\nspective of political bias, must to-day view '\n\nthe dose of a great historic career, whose\n\nunique character no fair-minded person can,i\n\nfail to recognise. Historians will note that to';\n\nMr. Gladstone alone belongs the honor of . -\n\nhiving been four times Prime m-i?fa— of\n\nEngland; And ™«nht^i| and unapproacu\n\nable for extent and beneficence is the catalogue\n\nof bis legislative work. The reproach that bo\n\nbegan life as a Conservative was really ay .\n\ntestimony to toe piogressiveness which was -.\n\nthe result of the deeper principles with which\n\nhe set out. His Conservatism was the ™-*™--i\n\nproduct of his education and early surround- .:\n\nings. One of a family of six, four eons \"\"*\n\ntwo daughters, William Ewart Gladstone was '\n\nborn on December 23, 1809, at liiverpool 'of \".\n\nwhich his father. Mr. John Gladstone, though\n\nof Scotch descent, lived to be a prosperous\n\nmerchant and eminent citizen. The future\n\nstatesman first saw the light when men of\n\nproperty were repelled from popular move\n\nments by the wave of revolutionary opinion\n\nthatswept across the Channel. Taldngakeen *\n\ninterest in political questions Mb. John Glad\n\netone was for nine years a. member of tha •\n\nHouse of Commons, and in 1545, six years,\n\nbefore his death, he was created a baronet. ~\n\nUnder Canning's influence he changed from -V\n\nWhiggism to Toryism, and the tender years <3t.;\n\nthe younger Gladstone wete passed atoii t\n\nwriting scenes of party «mflii* Widi each-:\n\nan environment it is not wonderful that his\n\neariy inclinations should be of a Conservative*'''\n\nnature. '',;.\n\nWHAT OXFOBD DD) XOT HiCH.\n\nWhSst at Eton Mr. Gladstone in ooa\n\ntributions to a school magazine'evinced the\n\nversatility and literacy aptitude for winch is\n\nlater years he became famous. Among bis\n\nwritings wasa tribute to the memory of Can\n\nrung, which strikintdy indicated die bent of\n\nGladstone's mind, while it was also a testi\n\nmony to the enduring eway exerted overfcW >\n\ngrowing political opinions by that-distin- '\n\nKuished statesman. So diversified were Glad- .\n\nstone's studies and mental vocations at £tdn :\n\nthat he bad little leisure for sports, nor does it\n\nappear that he ever, manifested any pre\n\nference for these. His feata as a tao-.\n\nfeller are known to all the ' world,\n\nbut this was, latterly at least, almost'\n\nthe only form of physical exercise in which he ■?•\n\nengaged. Field sports, for instance, neverhao'\n\nmuch attraction .for him. He did not show& •\".:\n\nadvantage on horseback.

When •\n\nhe left in 1827 he ??n?m^ the private pupil«!-\"\n\nDr. Turner, afterwards Bishop of. f!?l«mthi; .\n\nIn 1829 he entered Oxford as a 'foundation\n\nstudent of Christ Church, and in 1831 he\n\ngraduated with double-first honors in rjmjj^..\n\nand mathematics. He immediately threw him\n\nself into die'controversies of the union, ajjj .\n\nsoon attained a.foremast position in a band of V\n\nbrilliant contemporaries. It is noteworthy\n\nthat in Me Gladstone's £tst Cabinet there :\n\nwere no fewer than seven former presidents of;\n\ndie Oxford Union. The influences of the\n\nUniversity were reactionary in his day and\n\ntended to confirm his prepossessions and party.\n\nprejudices. Speaking of this in 1878 he said ;—\n\n\"I trace in the education of the Oxford oftny -\n\nown time one great defeg. Perhaps it\n\nwas my own fault; but I must \"ad\n\nmit that I did not learn when So\n\nOxford that which I have learned since, viz^ to '\n\nset a- due valne on the imperishable and\n\ninestimable principles of human liberty. The ■\n\ntemper which too mnch ' prevailed in •\n\ntu^Aamir, circles was th?t liberty was regarded ,\n\nwith jealousy. .... I have now learned to\",\n\nset the true value upon human liberty, and, in\n\nwhatever I have riiangnd. thece, and there\n\nonly, has been the explanation of the change.\"\n\nShortly after leaving Oxford bis eyes were in m\n\ncondition to cause much anxiety. He was\n\nordered topass some weeks in a dark room,\n\nand, with that'indomitable strength of win\n\nwhich characterised him at'too many juno-<\n\ntares of his life, be acquiesced cheerfully, and\"\n\nwent through one of the meat tiresome, and\n\nweary ordeals to which it is possible fora man\n\nof quick mind and ardent temperament to be -\n\nsubjected. From that darkened chamber be\n\ncame forth with ejfesight perfectly restored, bnt\n\nitwas thenceforth biscaiefulbabittowriteand\n\nread as often as he could seated with his hack -\n\nto the window, and with the light coming from\n\nbehind his head.

This was the era of the first Reform\n\nBilL When, after severe and embittered con\n\ntests, the great constitutional change was\n\neffected (June, 1632) Gladstone was invited to\n\nstand in die Tory interest for Newark. At\n\nthis summons from the Dole of Newcastle ha\n\nhastened back from the Continent, and was\n\ncoon in die midst of an «-rriring canvass. Aa\n\ndie ducal nominee be was at first eyed with\n\nsuspicion and distrust, but his eloquence/,\n\nmanliness, and nnsladdng energy proved of\n\nsuch avail that, despite die most vigorous op- ;\n\nposition, ho was returned at die bead of ihm\n\npoll. As a candidate he won golden opinions,\n\nfrom the electors, who eventually became\n\neven more proud of their brilliant and elo\n\nquent member.\n\n•'A6XEHS AKDCXBEXDIKG TOBT.\" . t\n\nThe first session of die Reformed Padia*.\n\nment will bo gratefully remembered as that in\n\nwhich da very in die British colonies was '\n\nabolished.

Gladstone's financial achievements '\n\nfrom Gist to last aro pretty f am3iar to every I\n\nobservant citizen throughout the. British i\n\nEmpire. The mismanagement of the Crimean <\n\nWar necessitated a defence of the administra- 3\n\nlion, but in the end the Ministry of Lord i\n\nAberdeen was defeated, but Gladstone re- 1\n\nearned kis past in the P&lmerstott Ministry. ]\n\nHe again resigned, however, owing to his dis- <\n\napproval of the conduct of the wan He 4\n\nwas favorable to an early «peace, yet <\n\ngave the Government an independent i\n\nsupport. In the general election in I\n\n1557, which followed the dissolution on t\n\nthe China question, Gladstone was returned i\n\nunopposed for Oxford University. In the j\n\nfollowing session Lord Falmerston evas again I\n\ndefeated on the Conspiracy to Murder Bill, t\n\nand resigned. Gladstone once more declined j\n\nto join the Government formed by Lord Darby c\n\nin IS3S, but accepted the appointment of Lord t\n\nHigh Commissioner Extraordinary to the ]\n\nlonian Isles, and bis sojourn among Greek i\n\npeople seems to have inspired die production of f\n\nbis viagrnum opus \"Studies on Homer and the I\n\nHomeric Age,\" which appeared in this year. <\n\nIt is notable that in the session of 1859 Glad- .\n\nstone caused the incorporation in the India i\n\nBill of a clause providing that the Indian 1\n\ntroops should not be employed in military ]\n\noperations beyond the frontiers of India with- %\n\nout the consent of Parliament. It was on this i\n\npoint he tmiKHxi when he censured the ]\n\nbringing of Indian troops to Malta by ■\n\nthe Beaconsfield Government. May, 187S, i\n\nalbeit his Government felt no com- i\n\npunction whatever in employing these troops\n\nin the Egyptian campaign in 1882. At the <\n\ngeneral election in 1553 Gladstone was again '\n\nelected for Oxford, and on the resignation of i\n\nthe Conservative Government resumed office c\n\nas Chancellor of tbe Exchequer in the last j\n\nFalmerston Administration. In ISGO the <\n\nFrench treaty of commerce was concluded, I\n\nanjd in_,tbie,apd, .the succeeding five years his c\n\nbudgets were as acceptable as ever. In 1861 i\n\nhe spoke on behalf of Italian unity; in 1862 <\n\nha unwisely expressed his belief Uiat Jefferson '\n\nDavis had already made the Confederate ]\n\nStates an independent nation, though some :\n\nyears.later he confessed that he had com- j\n\nmitted an erfor of judgment in that matter. < <\n\nHe was especially fortunate In years of pros- \"\n\npeaty, which justified his financial foresight i\n\nand enabled him to afford meat relief in taxa- i\n\ntion. As the general election in 1865 he was i\n\ndefeated by Mr. Gathorne Hatxly (now Lord I\n\nCranbrook) at Oxford, but found a neat ;\n\nin South Lancashire. During tbe contest for <\n\ntoo latter constituency he .used the ex- i\n\npression, \"at last, my friends, I am come i\n\namong you, and. I am come among you un- t\n\nmuzzled.\" The breach of his connection with i\n\nOxford University undoubtedly impelled him <\n\nforward in a more democratic direction. On ;\n\nthe death of Lord Palmerston the Govern- :\n\nm«ntj was reconstructed, with Earl Russell as ]\n\nPremier and Gladstone as Chancellor of the i\n\nExchequer, and for the first time Ti**«^«*r of the t\n\nHouse of Commons.' The reform question, ;\n\nwhich had been in abeyance during Palmer- i\n\nston's last years, was revived, and on March .\n\n12,1SGC, Gladstone introduced the Franchise i\n\nBill, which, in a speech at Liverpool, ho\n\ndescribed as having \"passed the rubicon.\"\n\nThe incidents of the struggle over the measure,\n\nwhich Jed to the defection of the Adultamites,\n\nand afterwards to tbe resignation of the\n\nKnasell-Gladstone Ministry, are still freshly\n\nremembered. Lord Derby formed another\n\nadministration, which succeeded in carry\n\ning a Reform Bill, though it -was\n\nessentially modified =.t the dictation\n\nof Gladstone. .On the retirement of\n\nEarl Derby Mr. Disraeli became premier, in\n\nFebruary, 18C8. and further measures of reform\n\nwere passed, while the adoption of Gladstone's\n\nOorrfpnbwry Church Bates Abolition Bill ied\n\nto the settlement of a long-agitated question.\n\nIn this session also Gladstone foresoadowed\n\nhis action in disestablishing tbe Irish Church\n\nby bringing in a series of resolutions affinnin;\n\nthat in the opinion of the House the time had\n\ncome when the Church of Ireland should cease\n\nto ciist as an establishment. The resolutions\n\nwere carried by a majority of 56, and Glad\n\nstone then introduced bis Irish Church Sus\n\npensory Bin, which was adopted by tbe\n\nI Commons bat rejected by die Lords. This\n\nyear in defence and explanation of his political\n\nconduct he issued \" A Chapter of Autobio\n\ngraphy.\" A general election now took place\n\n(December, ISGS). Gladstone -was defeated\n\nfor South Lancashire, but found a seat for\n\nGreenwich. The Conservative Government\n\nwas, however, so hopelessly beaten that\n\nDisraeli at once resigned office.1 -\n\nFIBST PREMIERSHIP.\n\nWhat has been called the golden age of\n\nLiberalism was now begun. Gladstone became\n\nPrime Minister of a Cabinet which to the rar\n\npriso of many included John Bright. His\n\npolicy was figuratively announced in tbe Upas\n\ntree simile, for his avowed, determination was\n\nto redress the grievances of the Irish Church\n\nand land. With a majority reckoned at 115 it\n\nwas no very difficult matter to ensure the dis\n\nestablishment of the foredoomed Irish Church,\n\nyet*considering tbe interests and incidents\n\nexcited the subversive, measure merited its\n\ndescription as the most remarkable achieve\n\nment of modern times. In the following year,\n\n1870. the promised Irish Land Bill, which was\n\neven a more popular measure in Ireland, was\n\npassed; while several domestic reforms of\n\nmore or less importance were effected. The\n\nGladstone Government in tbe next session\n\nincurred some odinm -by issuing ■ a\n\nEoyal warrant for the abolition of pur\n\nchase in the army, and opinion- was 'keenly\n\ndivided as to the policy -of the Washington\n\nTreaty, which facilitated a settlement of the\n\ntroublesome Alabama clb*\"ir. against which the\n\nTjPglifih • ffr |1*twwfr M* l Sir A. Cockbum^ entered\n\nan elaborate protest The Government was\n\nfurther damaged by the scandal attaching to\n\nsome appointments. In - 1573 the Premier\n\nattacked: the third braach. of the Upas-tree,\n\nbut bis Irish University Bill was lost on the\n\nsecond reading by three votes. He conse\n\nquently resigned, but on Disraeli refusing to\n\ntake office Gladstone, resumed power, which\n\nwas, however, obviously waning, so much so\n\nindeed that in January, 1574, the Premier\n\nsurprised the country by isaning a manifesto\n\ndissolving I'aruamenL Several circumstances\n\nconcurred to demonstrate the imprudence and\n\nunwisdom of this step, and the Liberals were\n\nconfounded by the overwhelming return\n\nof tho Conservatives with a substantial\n\nmajority of 46. This sweeping verdict\n\ndecided Gladstone to tender immediately bis\n\nresignation to her Majesty. Thus strangely\n\ncame to a precipitate end tho first Gladstone\n\nMinistry, which, had certainly inaugurated a\n\nremarkable era in legislation. When Disraeli\n\nonce more acceded to power Gladstone retired\n\nfrom tbe leadership of the Liberal party He\n\nseldom appeared in the House, and in January,\n\n1875. he formally resigned the leadership into\n\nthe hands of Lord Uartington. Relieved from\n\nthe absorbinc cares of Parliamentary life he\n\ndevoted his energies to literary work, and pro- j\n\ndueed in quick succession a variety of essays I\n\non diverse subjects. He was particularly!\n\nattracted to a discussion of ritualism and\n\nVaticanism, yet he did not forsake his favorite\n\nHomeric studies. In March, IS7G, bo received\n\nthe singular appointment of Professor of\n\nAncient History at tbe Boyal Academy.\n\nIn September he published his pamphlet on the\n\n\" Bulgarian Hcnrnrs,\" and excited thereby a\n\ngrave sensation. At public meetings he severely\n\ncriticised tbe Eastern policy of the Beacons\n\nfield Government, assailed their \"Im\n\nperialism,\" and scathingly denounced their\n\nfinancial policy. In November, 1877, he was\n\nelected Lord Rector of Glasgow University ;\n\nbe had been Lord Hector of Edinburgh Uni\n\nversity in 1S50; and <>a his 00th birthday,\n\nDecember 2'J. IS7S, some admirers presented\n\nhim with a silver axe. In tbe autumn of 1879\n\nhe made his famous progress across the border,\n\nand in the course of a fortnight addressed\n\naudiences numbering 75,000 people; while over\n\na quarter of a million Scots took part in the\n\ndemonstration evoked by his visit to their\n\ncountry. 'At tlK> general election in the spring\n\nof ISSO be ousted the Marquis of Dalkeith\n\nfrom the representation of Midlothian. His\n\nspeeches on that, occasion were strongly\n\ndenunciatory of the Conservative Govern\n\nment. The constituencies ralb/jd to his\n\ncry, and a tremendous majority of Liberals\n\nwere returned. Disraeli, now Lord Beacons\n\nfield, resigned, and Gladstone was a\n\nsecond time Prime Minister. Great concern\n\nwas expressed for him in the autumn of this\n\nrear owing to bis severe illness, but a cruise\n\nround the British Isles restored him to his\n\nwonted vigor. In the beginning of 1533 he\n\nhad again to seek rest trom the \" incessant toil, j\n\nwUicli was affecting: his health.\" and in the < <\n\nautumn he look a sea trip, to which unduo!\n\nl«jlic.ical importance «-.ts attached on tiie Con- I\n\ntiuent, in the courseof which he met at Copen- !\n\nlisten tlie Czar, the King of Denmark, the |\n\nKirn; of Greece, and other notabilities. j\n\nFOKEI.;N t DIFFICULTIES. ]\n\nIn ISSI a Coercion Act for Ireland was j\n\nintroduced, but it wis accompanied by a. great <\n\nand beneficial measure in the shape of a second i <\n\nIrish Land JiilL The state of Ireland bad!\n\niuticed become so disquieting that id ISSO |\n\nthe Premier declared that the country \\\n\n\\vA3 *' witliin a measurable distance x>f •\n\ncivil war/ The assassination of Lord Frede\n\nrick Cavendish and Mr. Hurke during the\n\nsession of IbSJ led to tlie introduction of the\n\nPrevention of Crime Bill; but the Phoenix\n\nPark murder trials revealed thu existence of a\n\nwidespread horrible conspiracy against ]ife and\n\nluthority. The Premier himself was more\n\nthan once threatened with death, and it\n\nivas deemed prudent to have his person and\n\nhouse guarded by police. Is the House of\n\nCommons tho obstruction of Home Rulers\n\nchiefly brought about certain reforms in pro\n\ncedure, including the closure and the devolu\n\ntion of particular matters to standing com\n\nmittees. The Arrears Act, a substantial boon\n\nto Irish peasants, also became law in 18S2.\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Gladstone's Government bad\n\nperforce to follow very closely the foreign\n\npolicy initiated by the Beaconstield Ministry,\n\nbut 'alike in South Africa and Egypt\n\nthey could not keep free from blood\n\nshed. The close of the fourth Par\n\nliamentary session during which be was\n\nPremier fouiA the Ministry still strong,\n\noccupying a position almost as secure as when\n\nthey took office, with all the fresh prestige of\n\ntho electoral success still clinging to them,\n\nrhat position had doubtless been strengthened\n\nby the recognition of the Hadical element, first\n\nin tiie person of Mr. Chamberlain, and subse\n\nquently in the elevation of Sir C. Dilke. The\n\nMinistry had, on the other hand, suffered\n\nFrom the defection of prominent members, the\n\nDuke of Argyle, Mr. Bright, Mr. W. E.\n\nForster, and in a secondary degree Loud Lans\n\niowne, who for\" various reasons seceded from\n\nthe Government. They had, however, co\n\noperated with liim in striving to preserve the\n\npeace of Europe, of whiih in 1890 there was\n\nthe gravest reason for alarm anent its dis\n\nturbance; through the Don-performance of\n\nlame, parts of the treaty of Berlin. In South\n\nAfrica one dangerous complication was fol\n\nlowed by another. On the north-western fron\n\ntier of India the unsettled condition of Afehan\n\naffairs seemed to portend an indefinite exten\n\nsion of Anglo-Indian responsibility. At borne\n\nthe reign of terror in Ireland was at its height,\n\n[n 1681 some of these questions had been\n\nwholly and some partially settled, bat a new\n\nForeign difficulty loomed on the Egyptian\n\nhorizon. The European difficulties were era\n\nlually settled, while in South Africa and\n\nAfghanistan matters took a more pacific and\n\nreassuring turn. Still, it was notorious that\n\nlittle confidence was, or ever bad been, re\n\nposed on the foreign policy of Gladstone,\n\nwhose forte was domestic legislation and\n\nfinancial administration. The campaign in\n\nEgypt redounded to the credit of the Govern\n\nment, though to its vacillation was due in a\n\nsupremo measure the perils and calamities\n\nwhich preceded and attended the war.\n\nIVten hostilities were, however, decided upon\n\nthey were prosecuted with vigor and success.\n\nDie triumph of British arms paved the war to\n\nreforms in the volley of the Nile, which basever\n\nsince been occupied by English troops. The\n\nproposed construction of a Becoud Suez, Canal\n\ntended to strain still further the relations be\n\ntween England and France, which British pro\n\nceedings in Egypt bad left in an unsatisfac\n\ntory condition; while the presumed designs\n\nof i'rance in the Pacific, the expedition against\n\nroaquin, the conduct of FreDch affairs in\n\nMadagascar, and the movements on the Congo,\n\nill indicated the pursuance of a testifies and\n\nbigh-banded policy which could hardly fail to\n\ncool the friendship oF the western Powers.\n\nNevertheless, on the whole, Gladstone \"bad\n\nreason to feel satisfied with his efforts to pre\n\nserve peace, which had been restored and\n\nmaintained in place of the elements of\n\ntrouble which abounded two or three\n\nyears before. Considering the pressure\n\nof external questions and the neces\n\nsity for concentrated attention to Irish\n\naffairs, the legislative achievements during\n\nthis period, though comparatively slight, were\n\nnot inconsiderable. The great majority of the\n\nconstituencies approved cordially of the laws\n\npassed, from the Burials Act down to the\n\nBankruptcy' Act The Bradlaugh episode,\n\nhowever, proved an unfortunate diversion, but\n\nit drew from Gladstone a memorable speech in\n\nsupport of the Affirmation BilL Of that\n\nspeech it was said that it rose to a height that\n\nhas not been rivalled in the Parliamentary\n\neloquence of our generation. It exhibited a\n\nstriking union of the moral dignity that makes\n\nthe success of one kind of oratory, and the\n\nintellectual force that marks another ; and it\n\nwas no wonder that the thronged House was\n\nheld captive by so magnifroenc a display. . The\n\nforce of what was said was backed and\n\nheightened by the personality of the speaker,\n\nby nis great position, by his strong authority\n\nover the country, by the special relation of bis\n\nown deepest convictions to the task that un\n\nwelcome circumstances had imposed upon him.\n\nA HEHOHABLE DEFEAT.\n\nIn ISS4 Mr. Gladstone carried a new Reform\n\nBUI, wuihh provided for the addition of two\n\nmillions to the electorate. The household,\n\nthe lodger, and the \"service\" franchise —the\n\nlatter giving the suffrage-to out-door servants\n\n—was extended. It was a Bill \"worth\n\nhaving;\" as Mr. Gladstone assured some of\n\nhis followers who thought the measure did not\n\ngo far enough. Tbis Bill, coupled with\n\nanother for the redistribution of seats, finally\n\npassed the House of Lords in June, ISSS. But\n\ntuie groat work having been accomplished, it\n\nbecame apparent that the Government had I\n\noutlived its efficiency, and could not hope to\n\nweather the storm arising out of a series\n\nof blunders in the regiou of foreign\n\npolicy. In January, ISSC>, Eusland was\n\non the verge of hostilities with Russia, quarrel\n\nling with Germany on the New Guinea and\n\nAtigra Pequena annexations, and striving in\n\nvain to effect a settlement of the Egyptian\n\nquestion in face of the European Powers. But\n\nwhere the (government suffered most discredit\n\nwas in connection with the Gordon fiasco.\n\nEvents in the Soudan- led early in ISB4 to the\n\ndispatch of General Gordon to Khartoum that\n\nhe aught report on the situation and assist in\n\nwithdrawing the Egyptian garrison. As tame\n\nadvanced it became apparent that Gordon's\n\nposition was one of grave peril, Mid tuat be\n\nwas gradually being surrounded by the forces\n\nof the Mahdi. In May was published official\n\ncorrespondence containing Gordon's indignant\n\nprotests against bis desertion, and against the\n\nindelible disgrace of abandoning tbe garrison.\n\nA few days later Sir Michael Hicks-Beach\n\nmoved a vote of censure. Mr. Gladstone\n\nasserted that the Government liad not neg\n\nlected Gordon, that they were responsible for\n\nhim, and if he were really in peril, would give\n\nhim reasonable aid. At the same time he\n\ncharged the Conservatives with endeavoring to\n\nforce a policy ofr annexation on the country,\n\n' and with underrating tbe difficulties of reliev\n\ning Khartoum and the danger of increasing\n\nBritish responsibilities. but tbe Prime\n\nMinister, though he held his party\n\ntogether, failed to vindicate tho action of\n\nhis Government, and notwithstanding that\n\nthe vote of censure was rejected by 303\n\nto 275, two of his principal toUowcra, Mr.\n\nFoster and Mr. Goschen, declined to\n\nvote for the Government, and absented them- |\n\nselves from the division. Towards .the close j\n\nof the session, when it was known that Berber I\n\nhad fallen, that Khartoum was isolated, and\n\nDongola in danger, a vote of credit of\n\n£300,000 was demanded and given to facili\n\ntate the dispatch of an expedition for Got- j\n\ndon's relief. The rescue party reached Khar-1\n\ntonai in February, 18S5, only to find that tbe !\n\nSoudan capital had the day before fallen into 1\n\nthu hands of the Arabs, and that Gordon bad j\n\nperished. There is no doubt that it was this\n\ntragedy which secured the Opposition a\n\nmajority when on June 10 the vote was taken\n\non the Ministerial proposal to increase the\n\nspirit and beer outiea. \" When,\" says\n\nMr. Lucy, \"tbe figures wore announced\n\nshowing the Government in a minority of 12,\n\nLord liandolph Churchill threatened to go\n\nmad with joy. Ue wrung the hand of the\n\nimpassive limvland Winn, n-ho regarded him\n\nwith a kindly, curious smile, as if he were\n\nsome wild animal. Sir. Gladstone went on\n\nwriting his letter to theljueen eummarisine\n\nthe proceedingsof the night. Cries for the\n\nadjournment filled the House. Mr. Glad\n\nstone still holding his letter in one hand, and\n\nthe pen in the other, quietly moved the\n\nadjournment, and the crowd surged through\n\nthe doorway, the Conservatives still cheering\n\ntumultuously.\" But it was only for a few\n\nmonths that Mr. Gladstone was excluded\n\nfrom office, for a general election brought to\n\ngether anew House of Commons at the begin\n\nning of IS.SC which was decidedly adverse\n\njto Conservatism. The vote of the new county\n\n| electorate was distinctly favorable to the\n\nLiberals, and the latter had 3 clear majority of\n\nUOilE IU.LS I'nOPOSiI.S.\n\nBut the Irish members now held the balance\n\n|of power, and Mr. Glad-tone found that to\n\n| reconquer office be must bid for Patnollite\n\n; support. He was probably strengthened in\n\nthis resolve by reports that the Conservatives\n\nwere already, through Lord Carnarvon, coquet\n\nting with Mr. Parneil. While hesitating on\n\nthe manner of his procedure Mr. Gladstone\n\nsuddenly found himself recalled to power by\n\nthe defeat of the Government on an amend\n\nment proposed by Mr. Collings for the benefit\n\nof the agricultural laborers. Sir. Gladstone\n\n' took office the first week in \"eDruary,\n\n! but nearly two months elapsed before\n\nhe sprang upon the country his great\n\n(proposal for the pacification of Ireland. So\n\n' drastic a measure as bis Home Rule Bill was\n\n1 expected by no one. Mr. Gladstone could see\n\n|no other means of tatisfvine the Irish but to\n\nrelieve them entirely of that \"alien rule\"\n\nwhich had been imposed upon them by the I\n\ncorrupt legislators of ISOO. Ireland mu*t bo j\n\ncut adrift, must be allotted to govern herself I\n\nwith her own Parliament, as independent of\n\nWestminster as is South Australia, control\n\nher own revenues, and eventually manage her\n\nowu law and police. A?, however, this sur\n\nrender would bring about the spoliation of)\n\n\"alien\"' landlords 3fr. <,\"!adstone tacked on {\n\nto his H-me liule Bill another for the\n\nindemnif. ..on of all holders of landed\n\nproperty, :• scheme which would have laid\n\nupon the ijritish taxpayer a burden of debt of <\n\nfrom £\"150,000,000 to £200,000,000. The boon I\n\nof self-government was not, however, to be c\n\nconceded gratuitously. Ireland was expected s\n\nto pay tribute money, half her public revenue i\n\ntowards the interest of the national debt and I «\n\nother Imperial expenditure; but, as if distrust- ■ i\n\ning the good faith of the enfranchised nation, j 1\n\nthu collection of these funds was to be en-1\n\ntrusted to Imperial officers. This startling I\n\npolicy came like a thunderclap on Mr. Glad-11\n\nstone's own followers. Some of bis colleagues i s\n\nand many of his closest political 11\n\nfriends deserted him, aad it was clear that 1:\n\nthe measure was not palatable to the English t\n\ndemocracy, whose chief stumbling block was i\n\nthe Land Bill with its gigantic financial :\n\nburden.\"- That concession to vested interests |\n\nMr. Gladstone was prepared to let go; but l\n\ntbe surrender onlr embittered tbe champions j i\n\nof the Irish landlords and the propertied j <\n\nclasses. Liberal as well as Conservative, and •\n\nwhen the night of the great division came a 11\n\nnnmber of his party refused to follow Mr. I\n\nGladstone into the lobby, and the Home Rule -.\n\nBill was rejected by a majority of 30 ]\n\nvotes. Mr. Gladstone was defeated but\n\nnut overcome. The adverse vote was\n\nfollowed by immediate dissolution. But\n\nthe country was against him, and Sir.\n\nGladstone's Government was succeeded by a\n\ncoalition of Conservatives and \"Liberal\n\nUnionists.\" The veteran gladiator took his -\n\nplace as leader of the Opposition, fulfilling its j\n\nduties with unsparing ansdnity, and as Mr.\n\nLucy cays, \"surpassing himself in the vigor |\n\nand eloquence of his speeches whenever tbe ,\n\nIrish question came up.\" It seemed likely (\n\nthat Mr. Gladstone's ascendency would re- ■\n\nassert itself, and already the huge Government '\n\nmajority was beginning to crumble at bye- .\n\nelections, and prominent seceders, includ\n\ning Sir George Trei'elyan, were strug- ,\n\ngling back to the colors, when a new ,\n\ndifficulty arose as the result of the O'Shea-\n\nParnell ~ divorce suit Mr. Gladstone prac\n\ntically threatened to abandon the Irish cause •\n\nunless Air. Parnell's leadership were repu- .\n\ndialed. Mr. Pornell declined to move, and ,\n\nthe Irish party became divided, a section fol- '\n\nlowing Mr. Gladstone and a minority ad\n\nhering to Sir. Parnell, and even the death of\n\nthe great Irish tribune has failed to heal the ;\n\nbreach. In 1892 Parliament was dissolved, '\n\nand the general election went in favor of Mr. '\n\nGladstone, who returned to power with a '\n\nprogramme whose chief items were Home ■\n\nRule, the extension of local government for _\n\nLondon, one man one vote, and local :\n\nootion. In the second Home Eule Bill,\n\nwhich was introduced in 1893, Mr.' Gladstone\n\nomitted all mention of the land question. He\n\nproposed that a Parliament, consisting of aj\n\nlegislative Council and a Legislative t:\n\nAssembly, be established in Dublin. The :\n\nviceroy was to be appointed for six years, and <\n\nwas to be-independent of *' party exigencies in) i\n\nEngland;\" the judges were to be under the <\n\ncontrol of the Irish Parliament, which was 1\n\nalso eventually to have control of the policy. 11\n\nThe Irish members were to remain at West\n\nminster, but only to vote on matters of strictly\n\nImperial interest, including motions of want of\n\nconfidence in Ministers, and their number was\n\nto be reduced from 103 to 80. The\n\nBill, which occupied six months in pas&ing\n\nthe House of Commons, where it was carried on\n\nAognst 23 by a majority of 31, was thrown out\n\nby the Lords after a four nights' debate. Mr.\n\nGladstone determined to proceed with the\n\nbusiness of the country and to dispose of other\n\nportions of the Government programme be\n\nfore inaugurating a punitive agitation against\n\nthe Lords. But the carrying of the Parish\n\nCouncils Bill t'ThaMftt*'^ his energies, and for\n\n\"reasons of age and health\" he withdrew early\n\nin 1&94 from the Premiership, which passed into\n\nthe hands of Lord Rosebery. \"To men\n\nfamiliar for 20 years or more with the\n\nHouse of Commons it seemed impos\n\nsible,\" says Mr. Lucy, \"that it could\n\nbe itself when this majestic figure was\n\nabsent.\" But there remained •'the precious\n\npossession of memory. Men, in this\n\nrespect undivided by political opinion, momen\n\ntarily free from party asperity, will be thank\n\nful that though they never saw Pitt in the\n\nflesh, never heard Canning's voice, they have\n\nsat through successive Parliaments with Mr.\n\nGladstone.\" It was apparent that the Liberal\n\nGovernment conld not long survive the great\n\nveteran's retirement, and as at by-elections\n\nseat after ceat was lost, and the Tfariical? dis\n\ncrediting Lord lioscbery's sincerity halted in\n\ntheir allegiance no one was surprised when a\n\nf natch vote on June 21, ISHS, placed the\n\nGovernment in a minority. It was left for a\n\nConservative Ministry to wind up the business\n\nof Parliament, and in the following month\n\nthe dissolution took place and was followed at\n\nones by a general election, which ended in a\n\nrecord majority of 150 for the Conservatives.\n\nTHE FOBEMOST ILUt Of HIS TIME.\n\nMr. Gladstone did not seek re-election. But\n\nseclusion from public life did not abate his\n\ninterest in public affairs, and in. the discussion\n\nof questions of moment his voice and pen were\n\nfrequently, employed. He placed himself\n\nat the head of the pro-Armenian agita\n\ntion 'in 189 C' and the following year,\n\nand on the platform and in letters to\n\nthe press be repeatedly affirmed that it was\n\nthe duty of Great Britain to intervene on\n\nbehalf of the oppressed subjects of the\n\nSultan, whom lie described as \"the\n\ngreatest assassin in the world.\" Released from\n\n| Parliamentary toil Mr. Gladstone applied\n\nhimself to literature, and a yolnme of transla\n\n| tions of tbe odes of Horace issued in 1894 was\n\nfollowed a few months later by a commentary\n\non the Psalter. In ISM appeared a new\n\n1 edition of butler's works, arranged and\n\nI annotated by him, together with a\n\nvolume of *'Studies subsidiary to the\n\nworks of Bishop Batlet.\" Mr. Glad\n\nstone's efforts as a man of letters were\n\nonly excelled by his achievements as a. state\n\nman. Those efforts covered an extensive field\n\nand were protracted over a. lifetime. In early\n\nmanhood he pnblished \"The State in Its\n\nRelations with the Church,\" and it was in a\n\nreview of this work that Macaulay described\n\ntbe author as \" a stern and unbending Tory.\"\n\nThe sensation caused by his pamphlet on the\n\nNeapolitan atrocities issued in 1851 was only\n\nsurpassed by that which his better-remembered\n\n\"Bulgarian Horrors\" provoked in 1877. In\n\nISSS he crossed swords with. Huxley over\n\nscience and revelation, and in l£9o he pub\n\nlished \"Landmarks of Homeric Study,\" and\n\nalso \"The Impregnate Bock of Holy\n\nScripture.\" Mr. Gladstone was noted\n\nfor his religious fervor. His versatility,\n\ntoo, was extraordinary. He identi\n\nfied himself with movements affecting every\n\nclasd and interest in the community, as well as\n\nwith tbe causes and claims of foreign peoples,\n\nwhose struggles and aspirations had enlisted his\n\npowerful sympathy. His capacity for work,\n\nenabling bim to devote attention to the most\n\nvaried matters, was a marvel to beholders.\n\nOn great and trying occasions he ever showed\n\nan incomparable vigor, readiness, and alacrity,\n\nwhile in the advocacy of any cause he under\n\ntook to promote be proved himself a master of\n\nthe art of rapid, firm, and strenuous argumen\n\ntation. What was generally recognised as\n\nmost extraordinary in him was the degree\n\nwith which be united acumen, grasp, and\n\nargumentative resource with moral vigor and\n\neloquence. His plastic mind was peculiarly\n\n| susceptible to the changing influences of the\n\n{age. Though he bad been bred a High\n\nj Churchman and a Tory he assimilated the\n\nprinciples of the new democracy, and be\n\ncame filled by its sentiments, as\n\nif he had been, remarked a keen\n\n! observer of his career, a revolutionary\n\n| chief instead of a veteran Minister. When be\n\nI let fall the expression about the working man\n\nbeing \"our on-n flesh ahd blood,\" cynics\n\nI smiled and logicians protested. But the phrase\n\n| showed the new masters of the constituencies\n\nthat his sympathies were with them. It was\n\nI another evidence of his so-called sentimental\n\nisin, which the democracy were not slow to\n\nperceive went in his case with experience,\n\nwith a hard headed faculty for figures and\n\nmoney and business, and with unrivalled\n\npowsrs of expression aud argument. His\n\nearnestness of character was as striking as was\n\nliia marked individuality. A man of bis\n\ntemperament could hardly avoid making\n\nmistakes, yet there were few where the\n\nadministration of home affairs was concerned.\n\nIt was m foreign policy that he erred most,\n\nand in this respect his merits as a statesman,\n\nj dealing with concerns both at home and\n\n| abroad, furnished a contrast to Lord Palmer-1\n\nI ston, and more recently to Lord Beaconstield. |\n\nI But his apparent inconsistencies aud errors j\n\nI were at Inast explicable. Endowed as he was'\n\nj with sensibilities abnormally keen it was not j\n\n! very surprising: that he shoa!J pass, in a j\n\ni career which covered moreth&ntwogenerations, |\n\n| from one extreme of politics to the other. To his!\n\nI intense power of self-persuasion was ascribed |\n\n{ much of the buccess that he achieved. The !\n\nj process of change, said no unfriendly- critin, I\n\n! was no doubt a gradual one. and such step;\n\n| admitted of its own explanation : b,ut at the j\n\nclose the transformation was complete. If in i\n\ni foresight, self-control, and breadth of view he\n\n. was inferior to some of his great predecessors,\n\n' ncne of them could equal him in that com\n\nmand over the passions of his audience which\n\nis the highest distinction of the orator, as none\n\nhave surpassed him in the capacity for\n\ngrappling with complicated public questions,\n\n1 which is one of the most essential quak'Sea\n\n|tions of a great Minister. As the most!\n\n! eminent of the illustrious circle of states- j\n\n| men in the Victorian era, his fame will descend\n\n! to a posterity grateful for his invaluable ser\n\nvices and mindful of the intellectual, moral,\n\n■ and political excellence which stamped him\n\nj aa the foremost man of his time."
