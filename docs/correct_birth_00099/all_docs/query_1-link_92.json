        "text": "William Ewart Gladstone Jones was born in Kidderminster on June the 19th 1898. From an early age, the name William was dropped entirely and he was simply known to everyone as Ewart; so, throughout his story, we’ll refer to him by that preferred name…\n\nEwart’s father was Henry Joseph Jones who had originally hailed from Old Hill near Dudley; Henry had grown up in a large family (he was one of ten children) and he was clearly a highly skilled man, being a wheelwright by trade.\n\nEwart’s mother was Amelia Jones; she was born and raised in Elmley Lovett; a small village located just east of Hartlebury.\n\nHow Ewart’s parents first met is not known, but it may well have been the case that Henry plied his trade fixing wooden wheels on carts and wagons in and around the farmyards of rural Worcestershire, from whence Amelia hailed.\n\nWhen he was born, Ewart was the second child of Henry and Amelia; his ‘big’ sister Sarah Elizabeth had been born a year earlier, in 1897. The national census of 1901 confirms the family living in a two-up-two-down terraced house in Villiers Street, Kidderminster, a location that would have suited Henry and Amelia perfectly, as they were devout churchgoers; their chosen place of worship being the Milton Hall Baptist Church on Lorne Street, a minute’s walk away from their home.\n\nIn an appropriate reflection of the town’s character at that time, on completion of building works in 1890, the Church’s chief benefactor (a corn merchant named Josiah Harvey) handed over its use “to a committee of working men and women” and said that because of strong prejudices against Churches and Chapels, he had decided it would be called a Hall.\n\nYoung Ewart was soon brought into the faith and when growing up, would have undoubtedly attended the Milton Hall young men’s bible class, which was affectionately known as ‘Mr. Bale’s Bible Class’.\n\nAlong with his sister Sarah, Ewart attended Lea Street school, a ten-minute walk from their home in Villiers Street.\n\nThe 1911 census confirms that Henry and Amelia had been busy; not only had they moved house – to Albert Street, a little closer to Lea Street school for Ewart and Sarah – but they had also brought another four children into the world. Ewart had gained two brothers (Joseph Henry born in 1901 and Benjamin John, born in 1904) and two further sisters (Mildred Marion born in 1903 and his newest sibling, Rosalind Florence, born in 1911).\n\nThe 1911 census confirms that at the age of fourteen, Ewart’s sister Sarah, was working in one of the town’s many carpet factories, as a “carpet stitcher.”\n\nNot long after Great Britain declared war on Germany, Ewart gained a fourth brother, Samuel James.\n\nLike most young men at that time, Ewart was determined to answer his country’s call (following an early request for volunteers, in just eight weeks, over three-quarters of a million men in Britain had joined up).\n\nSo, keen to ‘do his bit,’ he enlisted on the 5th of June 1916, aged 18 years and 7 months.\n\nAt this stage, Ewart would have undergone a medical examination and would have been graded in terms of physical suitability for service. He would then have been sent home to await a call to report for basic training. From the records available, it seems that although Ewart was technically enrolled, his period of waiting for the training call-up was longer than usual, (records suggest that he had a temporary exemption on medical grounds, only being mobilised after a Travelling Medical Board had examined him sometime in early December 1917).\n\nLater that same month, Ewart was posted to the 13th (Reserve) Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. Soon after his arrival, a structural re-organisation saw this battalion become re-classified as the 33rd Training Reserve Battalion, or 33TRB.\n\nEwart served with the 33TRB from the 20th of December 1916 to the 12th of July 1918. On completion of his basic training, he was posted to a ‘Graduated Battalion’ where he received more advanced infantry training (in areas such as the workings and intricacies of the Lewis machine gun, the most effective use of hand grenades, and general battle-fitness, including bayonet fighting).\n\nOn completion of this training, as a twenty-year-old man, he would have been considered fit and ready for service overseas. Throughout this period of advanced infantry training, Ewart and his mates would have also undertaken Home Defence duties.\n\nThe Graduated Battalion that Ewart was in was the 206th - and on the 26th of July, this unit sent a draft of fully trained, eager young soldiers to France…\n\nOn the 29th of July they arrived at an Infantry Base Depot in Rouen (basically, a holding camp which kept newly arrived men in training while they awaited posting to a unit at the front). Almost immediately following arrival, 314 of Ewart’s draft were allocated to the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment (the Devons).\n\nSuch transfers and attachments were not uncommon. They were driven by the need for reinforcements in those units that had been badly weakened by losses in battle. The number of such movements varied according to casualty rates suffered and by the intensity of fighting up and down the line.\n\nEwart’s transfer to the Devons was most probably due to the terrible losses that they'd suffered in the Third Battle of Ypres a month previously (a battle more commonly referred to as Passchendaele).\n\nWhen he caught up with them on the 20th of August, they were resting in billets near Caëstre, six miles north-east of Hazebrouck.\n\nEwart and the Devons returned to the Ypres Salient at the end of November and even though the intensity of the initial fighting had abated, they were still in the thick-of-it, regularly taking part in hazardous offensive and defensive actions.\n\nAround this time, Ewart fell ill and was taken out of the line by his company Captain (R.J. Filgate) and sent for treatment on the Princesse Elisabeth, a 300-berth hospital ship that was on-hire from the Belgium government; his illness being confirmed by the on-board doctor as “influenza.”\n\nInfluenza was not an uncommon ailment amongst the frontline troops, and the medical staff aboard the Princesse Elisabeth would have been well versed in its treatment.\n\nOn overcoming the initial symptoms, Ewart would have undergone a period of convalescence and rehabilitation before eventually appearing before a medical board whose job it was to assess his physical suitability for redeployment to a frontline unit.\n\nEwart returned to the Devons but only for a short time; another transfer ensued and in early April 1918, he was directed to make his way to Avesne (a remote village behind Amiens) and report to his new unit – the 2/4th Battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (Ox and Bucks LI).\n\nOnce again, this transfer was driven by the heavy losses incurred by the 2/4th in previous battles; they'd suffered terribly when holding the line at Gricourt in the face of ongoing German attacks (the German Spring Offensive; the Kaiser’s desperate attempt to win the war before the newly arrived Americans could fully deploy their troops).\n\nFurther losses had been incurred during their subsequent rearguard action around St. Quentin when helping cover the British withdrawal in the face of the unrelenting German advance. The loss in all ranks is said to have been so heavy that the killed and missing could only be computed by counting those very few that remained.\n\nWhen Ewart joined his new, battle-weary battalion, it was as part of a 300-man draft (NCOs and men) along with a tranche of new Officers.\n\nAs if fighting with the Devons in the Ypres Salient wasn’t sufficient, Ewart saw even more action with the 2/4th Ox and Bucks: on April the 12th and 15th to the northeast of Robecq, on August the 28th near Neuf Berquin, and after moving south to the Cambrai Sector, at Haussy on the 24th and the 25th of October.\n\nThree weeks after that last action, the war was over.\n\nUnlike so many of his compatriots, Ewart had managed to survive the war; however his final months in service were spent battling against illness – the ongoing effects of an earlier gassing.\n\nOn the 9th of January 1919, an ailing Ewart was granted two weeks furlough and was sent home. Back in Blighty, Ewart’s health deteriorated further and he never returned to his battalion…\n\nOn the 20th of February 1919 he was discharged and: “Transferred to Class “Z” Army Reserve on demobilisation.”\n\nRaised in 1918, the Class “Z” Army was a reserve contingent consisting of previously enlisted British soldiers who had since been discharged. When the predicted refusal to accept the terms of the Armistice by disillusioned German stalwarts didn’t happen, the “Z” Reserve was abolished on the 31st of March 1920.\n\nHowever, if called upon to do so, Ewart would never have been able to function as a “Z” Army reservist, he was simply too unwell…\n\nEwart passed away on the 23rd of July 1919, aged just 21.\n\nHis Ministry of Pensions record card confirmed his disability on discharge as being \"pulmonary tuberculosis\" - it further confirmed that the degree of Ewart’s disablement was 100%. Tellingly, it also confirmed that his condition was wholly attributable to his war service.\n\nOn the 24th of July, the day after his passing, Ewart had planned to attend the Great War victory parade through the streets of Kidderminster…\n\nIn a newspaper article published 95 years after Ewart’s death, Ewart’s nephew (Roger Jones, the son of Ewart’s brother Edward) told of how he’d canvassed the Common-wealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) and presented evidence to support the claim that Ewart’s death at home, was a direct consequence of his service overseas.\n\nUp until this time, although Ewart's name appeared on the local war memorial, he wasn't included as a war casualty in some records (most probably because he'd died at home, post Armistice).\n\nThe Commission reviewed the evidence and agreed that Ewart’s name should most definitely be added to the Commission’s records of war dead and should be included in the United Kingdom Book of Remembrance.\n\nRoger’s efforts in winning recognition for his uncle’s service must be roundly applauded.\n\nToday, due to Roger’s success, Ewart’s family grave in Kidderminster cemetery is regularly tended by a CWGC volunteer, and in line with the Commissions pledge that all CWGC memorials to the fallen will be tended in perpetuity, it will continue to receive such attention for generation after generation, for many years to come.\n\nIn the same article, Roger confirmed that Ewart was:\n\n“…gassed in 1918, and (he) was sent to recuperate in northern France before being sent back to the front, despite not being well enough to fight”.\n\nThe validity of that claim may be open to conjecture. Of course, appropriate medical assessment processes were in place to ensure that those unfit to fight were discharged. However, no medical board member could ever really know how badly Ewart still felt as a result of his gassing.\n\nDespite the tried-and-trusted military protocols, only Ewart knew if he was truly fit enough for a return to frontline service - and the stories passed down from Ewart himself through generations of his family, suggest that he might not have been.\n\nThe fact that he was returned to frontline service and then died from Pulmonary Tuberculosis just a few months later, suggests that he wasn’t…"
