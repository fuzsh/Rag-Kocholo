        "text": "Charles Gladstone was the grandson of William Ewart Gladstone, the former Prime Minister. Educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, Charles became a Master at Eton in 1912 and remained until 1946. He served with the Intelligence Corps and Royal Flying Corps during World War I, and saw service in France and Belgium. He was captured in 1915, but put his time in the prison camp to good use by learning German, which he taught when he returned to Eton at the end of the hostilities.\n\nA fine oarsman, Gladstone never won a rowing Blue, unlike his older brother Albert. The siblings were, however, in the Christ Church eight that beat Eton to win the 1908 Grand Challenge Cup at Henley just a month before the London Olympics, where Charles was a non-starter. Gladstone coached the Eton eight for several years.\n\nGladstone was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Flintshire in 1929 and High Sheriff of Flintshire in 1951. On the death of his brother in 1967, Charles became the 6th Baronet Gladstone of Fasque and Balfour but chose to never to use the title, preferring to be called Mr. Charles Andrew Gladstone instead. The Baronetcy passed to his son William following his own death in 1968."
