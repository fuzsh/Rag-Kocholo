The letters are miscellaneous in content and do not relate to any one subject or period of time. They are arranged below in the order of their accession by this library. All are holograph letters unless otherwise stated in the list.\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898) statesman and Prime Minister in the years 1868-1874, 1880-1885, 1886, 1892-1894, was born at 62 Rodney Street, Liverpool on 29 Dec. 1809. His father was Sir John Gladstone (1764-1851) Liverpool shipowner and merchant. W. E. Gladstone was M.P. for South Lancashire from 1865 to 1868."
