The RATP Group (French: Groupe RATP), also known as the Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens (English: Autonomous Parisian Transportation Administration), is a state-owned public transport operator and maintainer headquartered in Paris, France. There, the company is going to build a new modern building. The architectural bureau that is preparing the plans for this building has invited me to cooperate. The building will be very »green« and I am in charge of the plant material for the secondary green facade, which will wind along the sides and across the roof. It will consist of climbers. The task is quite demanding, because it is necessary to capture the right ratio between greening – as coverage of surfaces – and openness, to allow enough natural light into the building.
