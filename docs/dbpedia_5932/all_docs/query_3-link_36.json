        "text": "Sepulveda Transit Corridor Partners (STCP) announced it has selected RATP Dev to develop the operations and maintenance component of its rail transit proposal to ease congestion on the I-405 (Sepulveda) corridor between Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley and Westside, according to the company's news release.\n\nAs part of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s (Metro) Sepulveda Transit Corridor Project, STCP is developing two high-capacity rail options to provide connected transit-taking riders between the Valley and the Westside.\n\n“We are excited to work with RATP Dev, one of the most innovative and experienced transit operators in the world,” said Derya Thompson, co-director of STCP. “From planning to construction, and now for operations and maintenance of the completed line, we have assembled an infrastructure ‘Dream Team’ to propose a fast, safe, green, and connected transit solution for people living and working in the Valley, on the West side and across Southern California. It is an honor to work on a transit solution that can help millions of people spend less time on the road and more time with their families.”\n\nRATP Dev operates and maintains transit systems in 16 countries. It is a subsidiary of RATP Group.\n\n“STCP proposes a high quality, time-efficient, and well-connected transit solution for the Sepulveda Corridor, which has the potential to dramatically change the commute of millions of people,\" said Mehdi Sinaceur, RATP Dev’s COO. \"RATP Dev brings to Los Angeles more than 30 years of experience managing fully automated transit systems accident-free and with headways as low as 90 seconds.\"\n\nSTCP’s rail options — referred to by Metro as Alternative 4 and 5 — are designed to reduce freeway and street congestion, air pollution, and climate change-causing emissions.\n\nAlternative 4 and 5 are both within the same travel corridor. Alternative 4 would run on an elevated trackway between the Van Nuys/Metrolink station and a station at Sepulveda & Ventura. Alternative 5 would run entirely below ground except for the northern end of the line at the existing above ground Van Nuys/Metrolink Station. STCP said it is developing both Alternatives; the decision on which to pursue is Metro’s.\n\nAlternative 4 and 5 would be integrated with Metro’s current and future transit system, with direct connections to the D, E, G Lines (also known as the Purple, Expo, and Orange Lines), Metrolink, Amtrak, multiple bus lines and bike lanes.\n\nSTCP’s options are one of two Pre-Development Agreement (PDA) proposals selected by Metro for its Sepulveda Transit Corridor Project.\n\nDuring the project design development, RATP Dev will provide Early Operator-Maintainer consultancy services, including design review and operations and maintenance systems development.\n\nIf STCP’s solution is selected by the Metro Board as the locally preferred alternative (LPA), RATP Dev would help STCP manage operations and maintenance on the built rail line."
