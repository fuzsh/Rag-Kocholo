        "text": "First and foremost, RATP Dev serves our clients and people. All that we do starts with our strong commitment to core services in North America, in bus, rail, streetcar, paratransit, and demand response transit and the passengers who ride these services each and every day. A client’s trust is the most important quality of our partnership.\n\nAs a wholly owned subsidiary RATP Group we look to our colleagues in Paris and across the globe, to help expand services in North America. As a result, we have gained expertise in managing some of the world’s largest and most advanced public transit networks – specifically expertise in operations, management, electric buses, autonomous vehicles, rideshare program, and transit technology.\n\nThank you to clients who have grown with us as we recently unified our brands under the RATP Dev name as a culmination of the organization’s strategic growth plan. We will continue to have an expanded focus on Safety & Security and Product Innovation in both the rail and bus services divisions. To new and prospective clients, welcome. The ride only gets better from here.\n\nMatt Booterbaugh\n\nCEO\n\nTOGETHER, BUILDING THE CITY OF TOMORROW\n\nEvery city is one-of-a-kind. Ready-made solutions won't do. We offer tailored solutions adapted to your needs.\n\nWith you—transit authorities, local decision-makers and partners—we build solutions based on extensive analysis of your specific expectations and requirements, and those of passengers. The result is a solution tailored to you.\n\nOur expertise across all transportation modes helps you choose the most appropriate solution. From there on we take care of all the rest, from study and design to building, controls, commissioning, operational maintenance, operation, and ticketing. We're there for the duration thanks to adaptations designed with you, for you.\n\nTAKING ACTION FOR AN EXCELLENT PASSENGER EXPERIENCE\n\nWe are proud of our most precious resource—the men and women who work for RATP Dev. People are at the heart of what we do. That means offering our staff meaningful opportunities, and bringing customers and passengers the solutions they trust us to provide. The goal is to give everyone access to convenient transportation and a more pleasant city to live in.\n\nGreater well-being, serenity, and safety: that's our pledge to you."
