        "text": "What is BIM?\n\nBIM is primarily characterized by a set of working methods and a digital 3D model containing intelligent, structured data. As well as the three dimensions of an asset’s physical and functional characteristics, the digital model can also include a variety of other parameters (relating to time, finance, the environment or heritage, for example).\n\nAbove all, it is a technical database consisting of objects defined by their characteristics and their mutual relationships. Altogether, it forms a structured set of information that can be used to design, build and operate a structure throughout its life cycle.\n\nA technological breakthrough and a redefinition of how different stakeholders collaborate, BIM is above all a means for mediating between all the parties involved in the decision-making chain, from the project client to the contractors operating at the site.\n\nThe uses of BIM (known as BIM Uses) enable project management to be continuously improved and resources – human, material or environmental – to be optimised.\n\nBuilding digitally before building physically makes it possible to:\n\nTake a wider range of information into account from the design stage (including operating costs);\n\nControl overall costs more effectively by optimising construction solutions or anticipating the problems that may arise during the execution phase;\n\nTake higher-quality decisions.\n\nThese processes developed for each use give architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) professionals the information and tools they need to plan, design, construct and manage buildings and infrastructure more efficiently.\n\nExpertise in BIM process applications to meet our clients' project objectives:\n\nCapitalising on our experience in managing complex projects\n\nApplying BIM principles to the client's business\n\nSharing the working methods specific to the approach\n\nContacts integrated into our overall approach\n\nGuarantees that participants are relevant\n\nEnsuring the efficiency and performance of the projects:\n\nDefining goals and BIM uses and facilitating decision-making from the preliminary study stage\n\nSupporting coordination and collaboration during the design studies\n\nMonitoring schedules and costs during the construction phase\n\nOptimising the structure’s operating and maintenance costs\n\nDrafting regulatory requirements and keeping in contact with all stakeholders at all times\n\nRATP – Bus 2025\n\nThe “Bus 2025” programme launched by RATP and Île-de-France Mobilités focuses on the ecological transition. The European Commission is supporting this ambition by allocating €23 million in grants to buy electric buses and convert bus depots to electric and biogas operation in Île-de-France. This massive investment will be matched with a further €23 million from the Banque des Territoires, a member of the Caisse des Dépôts group.\n\nIn the context of this project, the tasks of BIM design and coordination of the Croix-Nivert RATP site were entrusted to SUEZ Consulting, working as a consortium with OTCI.\n\nThe use of BIM for this project responds to three goals:\n\nIncreasing understanding of the site through modeling on the basis of a point cloud, enabling dimensions and precise characteristics to be deduced;\n\nIncorporating a structure and a complex network while conserving existing infrastructure;\n\nPreserving the historic heritage of a site in central Paris."
