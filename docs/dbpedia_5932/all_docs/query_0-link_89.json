        "text": "The contract was signed between the city of Shenyang (capital of the Chinese province of Liaoning with a population of 7.2 million) and an operating company, with an ownership structure typical to Chinese companies, 51% held by the city and 49 % held by the Transdev / RATP Dev joint venture.\n\nThe three-year contract covers the operation of four lines over 60 km of track. China’s first modern tramway, featuring catenary-free sections, is part of an urban development project that will eventually transport 150,000 daily passengers. The joint venture will initially operate 30 trams and manage two garage depots and maintenance. This is the fifth system operated by the Transdev / RATP Dev joint venture, following the iconic Hong Kong tramways, the Nanjing urban network with nearly 2,000 buses, the bus network serving downtown Macau and line 9 of the Seoul subway.\n\nThe contract, valued at more than 330 million yuan (over 41 million euros) for the operation of the tramway network includes a technical assistance provision to ensure a July 1, 2013 operational launch in anticipation of the 12th “China National Games 2013” which will begin August 31."
