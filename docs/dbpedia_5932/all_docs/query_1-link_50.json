        "text": "Quick Links\n\nTypes of Paris Public Transportation\n\nParis Zones\n\nTypes of Tickets Available\n\nParis Public Transportation Tips\n\nLike most major cities we’ve visited, there’s little reason to have your own car in Paris, France (we’ve only rented one car in the past seven months!), because public transportation is more than adequate, if not superior to driving.\n\nThe last thing we want to do when we’re exploring a city is deal with the frustrations of driving and finding parking as we make our way to eat a meal, work at a cafe, or sightseeing. Even if you’re used to driving in the US everywhere you go (we were!) and are extremely hesitant to take public transportation, trust us on this. At least give it a shot. Buses, metros, and trains are well maintained, clean, and modern. On the other hand, if you’re used to public transportation in other major cities, then you’ll pick-up on Paris in no time!\n\nFurthermore, although Paris is large, it’s not on the scale of Istanbul, Turkey or Cairo, Egypt so you can walk (with on reason) to and from most of the common tourist attractions. Therefore, while in Paris you’ll probably want to supplemented your walking (like we did!) with use of the metro and buses. We found the mix to be a great combination!Walking allowed us to get a bit of healthy exercise, discover the city in a way you can’t by vehicle, and in some cases get to the next destination faster than waiting for a bus or train. On the other hand, taking public transportation usually gets you from place to place faster and it keeps you from having to walk, especially when you're utterly exhausted.\n\nBefore arriving in Paris, we did research on the public transportation system. We like to be prepared and have a good sense of the system before arriving. Plus, it helps to know what’s available, so that we can get the best overall deal on public transportation tickets while we’re there. To make things a bit easier for you, here’s what we learned…\n\nPublic transportation is run primarily by RATP (Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens). RATP oversees the bus, metro, suburban tram lines and RER (Réseau Express Régional) lines A and B. Their visitors page is quite helpful. SNCF (Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer), the national rail, company runs RER lines C, D, and E, and serves the suburbs of Paris and beyond.\n\nTram\n\nThere are seven tram lines and 187 tram stations throughout Paris. Trams connect the suburbs to metro and RER lines.\n\nRER\n\nThere are five RER (Regional Express Train) lines, A, B, C, D and E. Trains run daily, the first one starts at 5:30 am and the last one ends at 1 am. Trains are color coded and labeled with the letter and the last stop on the route. When taking the RER, pay special attention to the overhead digital signs on the platform. Since there are multiple end-points and not all trains stop at every stop, you’ll want to make sure you get on the right train. The next train will be listed on the digital sign and each stop it makes will be lit with a small yellow square to the left of the name. In case this is unclear, reference the image below.\n\nIf you stay within zones one and two on the RER, the fare is the same as a bus and metro ticket. However, once you go beyond zone two, fares become distance based. This also means that you need to validate your ticket when entering (starting your journey) and leaving (ending your journey) the platform, as the system uses this mechanism as a way to verify that you paid for the entirety of your trip."
