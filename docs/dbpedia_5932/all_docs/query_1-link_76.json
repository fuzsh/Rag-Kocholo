        "text": "Required Leave\n\nHolidays and Annual Leave\n\nEmployees are entitled to a minimum of five weeks’ paid holiday a year. In addition, there are approximately ten public holidays every year. The law and CBAs grant additional paid leave for employees who have reached a specific length of service and for family related events. Autonomous executives also benefit from additional days off.\n\nEvery employee is entitled to paid vacations by his employer, regardless of his age, seniority or type of contract (indefinite-term or fixed-term). The duration of paid vacations varies according to the acquired rights (legally 2.5 days of paid vacation per month, unless more favourable collective bargaining agreement provisions apply). The vacation dates are subject to the agreement of the employer.\n\nMaternity and Paternity Leave\n\nThe pregnant employee benefits from a maternity leave during the period, which is around the expected date of childbirth (there is a prenatal leave and postnatal leave). Its duration is variable, depending on the number of unborn children or already at charge (from 16 to 46 weeks). The Social Security Daily Allowance varies in function of the salary (from EUR 9.39 to EUR 86).\n\nSickness Leave\n\nWhere the employee is out of work for sickness, subject to compliance with certain formalities (notably for the employee to submit, within 48 hours, the sick slip to the Social Security office and the employer) and satisfies the requirements, the employee is entitled to receive a daily allowance during his leave, after a three-day waiting period. This allowance will be directly paid to the employer in case of subrogation. The daily allowance paid for sick leave is 50% of the basic daily wage (on average, the Social Security Daily Indemnity is of EUR 43.40). After 30 days of sick leave, the daily allowance is increased to 66.66% of the basic daily wage, if the employee has at least three children. After 3 months, the daily allowance will be re-evaluated.\n\nDisability Leave\n\nIf an employee’s work capacity and income have been reduced by at least 2/3, as a result of an accident or a non-occupational disease, the employee will be considered as an ‘invalid’ and he/she can obtain the payment of a pension disability to compensate for lost wages, by filing a demand before the CPAM (French Health Insurance).\n\nIf the accident or illness is work-related, the employee may receive, under certain conditions, a permanent disability pension.\n\nThe employee should be affiliated to the Social Security for at least 12 months on the 1st day of the month during which occurred the interruption of work followed by disability, or the recognition of disability status resulting from bodily premature wear.\n\nIn addition to the qualifying affiliation period, the employee should either have contributed on a salary at least equal to 2,030 times the minimum wage schedule during the 12 calendar months preceding the work interruption, or have worked at least 600 hours during the 12 months preceding the interruption of work or recognition of disability status.\n\nInvalids are classified into 3 categories, depending on their level of disability, by the medical officer of the primary health insurance fund (CPAM):\n\n1st category: invalid who is capable of remunerated employment;\n\n2nd category: invalid who is absolutely unable to perform any occupation;\n\n3rd category: invalid who is absolutely unable to exercise a profession and is compelled to resort to the assistance of another person to perform ordinary activities of life.\n\nThe amount of the disability pension received will depend on the category the person is in. Also, the category that has been determined is not definitive and may evolve.\n\nPensions: Mandatory and Typically Provided\n\nThe French retirement pension system of employees is structured into three components; the first two, the Basic retirement pension and the Complementary retirement pension are mandatory, hence, contributions are imposed on employees and employers, while the third, Additional pension (when implemented by the employee, it is primarily of savings products such as life insurance, the popular retirement savings plan (PERP) or “Madelin contracts” for non-salaried workers) is optional.\n\nBasic retirement pension\n\nThe characteristic of the basic diets is that they are extremely fragmented. They number thirty-six structured around the professional status of their contributors (private sector, agriculture, civil servants, independent…) or a particular occupational category (SNCF, RATP, Ministers of Religion, …). For employees of the private sector, the fund is the National Elderly Insurance Fund (CNAV) and the largest pension fund.\n\nComplementary retirement pension\n\nFor employees and managers covered for their basic pension of national pensions’ fund (CNAV) or MSA (MSA), the complementary pension is managed by two entities:\n\nfor executives, it is the General Association of Supplementary Pension Institutions of Executives (AGIRC);\n\nfor all employees, it is the Association of supplementary pension schemes (ARRCO).\n\nBoth associations formed an economic interest group: GIE AGIRC-ARRCO. An agreement signed in October 2015 provides for the creation in 2019 of a unified complementary regime.\n\nAdditional pension\n\nBased on the principle of capitalisation by the employee, who saves for retirement, the additional pension is fairly marginal in terms of membership. It can be implemented by a company or individually. When implemented by the employee, it is primarily of savings products such as life insurance, the popular retirement savings plan (PERP) or “Madelin contracts” for non-salaried workers."
