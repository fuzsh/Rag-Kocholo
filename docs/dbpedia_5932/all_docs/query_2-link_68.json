        "text": "The Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) announced today that RATP Dev USA was awarded the contract for management of the Hartford, New Haven, and Stamford divisions of CTtransit.\n\nThe term of this agreement is four years, with two 2-year extensions exercisable by CTDOT. The turnover of the operation and management of CTtransit will take place on December 31, 2022, when the current management contract with First Transit expires.\n\n“We are excited to announce the selection of a new operator of our robust CTtransit system. Riders will continue to have the same great service when we change operators,” said CTDOT Commissioner Joe Giulietti. “We look forward to working closely with RATP Dev USA as we continue to improve our system to give our valued customers a top-notch experience. We will build on the incredible momentum happening with our public transportation system to get people where they need to be safely and efficiently.”\n\nRATP Dev USA will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Hartford, New Haven, and Stamford divisions, including human resources, bus maintenance, safety, training, planning, scheduling, and fare collection. The Hartford, New Haven, and Stamford divisions utilize 520 buses and 1,250 employees to provide 95 local bus routes, eight CTfastrak routes, five flyer routes, eight downtown shuttles, and 13 express routes. In State Fiscal Year 2022, the services offered by the three divisions provided over 18.2 million passenger trips.\n\n“RATP Dev USA is excited to assume the management operations of CTtransit and serve the residents of Connecticut,” said RATP Dev USA Regional Vice President Steve Sherrer. “In the coming years, CTtransit is planning a robust list of transit projects that will continue to advance public transportation in the State. Working together with our front-line team members, stakeholders, and the communities CTtransit serves, RATP Dev looks forward to a long-term partnership focused on outstanding service delivery.”\n\nCTtransit is a state-owned bus system that provides bus services in eight divisions. In addition to the Hartford, New Haven, and Stamford systems that RATP Dev USA will manage, other private companies operate the divisions in the Waterbury, New Britain, Bristol, Meriden, and Wallingford areas under contract with the State. These services are all under the brand of CTtransit and, in State Fiscal Year 2022, had a combined ridership of 20.5 million passenger trips.\n\nFor more information on CTtransit, please visit cttransit.com."
