        "text": "RATP Group is taking part in the 5th edition of Viva Technology, from 16 to 19 June 2021. The Group is inviting 27 start-ups to this hybrid version of the event, in person on its stand and virtually in its e-LAB. This unmissable event provides an opportunity to discover RATP Group innovations that are helping to shape smart and sustainable cities.\n\nInnovating for the cities of tomorrow\n\nRATP Group dedicates every day to better city living. To this end, we offer efficient and innovative services in France and throughout the world, facilitating the daily lives of passengers on our networks, developing our industrial excellence, inventing and preparing for the city of tomorrow. And for the Group, tomorrow is today. Viva Technology will thus provide an opportunity to promote innovations developed by RATP Group in collaboration with its partnering start-ups, offering concrete solutions to build smart and sustainable cities.\n\nThe Group will be presenting its approach to innovation around 4 key topics, one on each day:\n\n• The sustainable and inclusive city\n\n• Autonomous and shared mobility\n\n• Industry 4.0\n\n• Augmented travel\n\nPreview of our innovations\n\nMany innovations and demonstrations will be on display on the RATP Group stand and e-LAB from 16 June. Here is a preview of three of them.\n\nA connected ring\n\nRATP Group is experimenting as a pilot partner for the connected ring from start-up ICARE Technologies. Named Aeklys by Starck and designed by Philippe Starck, this ring features NFC technology. The principle is simple: with the ring on their finger, passengers or employees can just walk past the validation terminals to join the network they are authorised to access. Using technology developed by Calypso Network Association, this connected ring provides the highest level of security and personal data protection."
