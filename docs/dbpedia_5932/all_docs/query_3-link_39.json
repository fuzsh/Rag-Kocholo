        "text": "Process\n\nA successful work experience programme implemented at RATP Dev Transit London for young people interested in an engineering career has led to a RATP Group Foundation-funded programme called Open Chance. Open Chance provides young people with the opportunity to climb aboard a specially adapted bus and try their hand at technical skills and perhaps explore the possibility of an engineering apprenticeship. The company also works closely with an organisation called Transport for All, which helps make public transport accessible to all sectors of the community.\n\nRATP Dev Transit London is active in corporate social responsibility, supporting mental health projects, Macmillan Cancer Support and other charitable causes in the locality. A keen participant of mental health awareness campaigns, we support the well-being of our people through showing kindness. Our mental health first-aiders are on hand to speak confidentially with colleagues and our Employee Assistance Programme provides advice and counselling on a range of health and well-being matters, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
