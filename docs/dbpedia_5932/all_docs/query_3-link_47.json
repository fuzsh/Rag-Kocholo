As the world’s ﬁfth-largest transportation company, RATP Group runs and maintains tens of thousands of kilometers of subway, bus, tram, and urban or intercity rail lines around the globe.\n\nSabrina Ratkovic, HR Manager at RAPT Group, explains “We have been in Dubai for the past 5 years and still have a small team till date, we were doing things manually and with business growing, we needed a tool to optimize our time and eﬀiciency responding to employee needs.”\n\n“For us the most important features we required were employee leave requests, leave allowance calculations and from a HR perspective an online storage and employee information center. Overall in a solution we were looking for all HR pillars, which you provide.” When asked what made Yomly stand out compared to other solutions in the market, Sabrina explained “Without any doubt the simplicity of the technology and the price.”\n\nIn October 2019, RATP Group selected Yomly to digitally transform their HR processes, while providing a cloud-based storage and information center.\n\n“Yomly has been implemented for our team in Dubai only, so far. We sent out email communication, arranged for training and launched!”\n\n“Your client servicing team are just amazing, the way they know the system and the explanations are always clear and straight to the point. They’re very helpful and always available.” Says Sabrina.\n\n“From ﬁrst impressions, our employees have been very impressed with the software and information can be found very easily and quickly if needed.”\n\n“Although we are currently only using Yomly In Dubai, we plan to implement the platform in future operations” Concludes Sabrina Ratkovic, HR Manager at RATP Group."
