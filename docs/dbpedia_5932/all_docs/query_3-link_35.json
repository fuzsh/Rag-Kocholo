Previously any journeys to the airport from Bath would of required travelling by train to Temple Meads, changing to a bus for onward travel, by taxi or by personal car.\n\nNot only does Air Decker connect Bath to Bristol Airport, but it also serves every stop along the route allowing people to make local journeys for leisure or work.\n\nOriginally operating an hourly service between 3am and midnight it grew in popularity and now runs a 30 minute service frequency throughout the day, and operates through to 1am assisting those who land later in the evening."
