        "text": "Aside from the Gautrain project being recognised as one of the most successfully executed Public Private Partnerships (PPP) in this region, it also exemplifies the true essence of localisation and skills transfer when carried out correctly. This transition is evident in the journey of the Bombela Operating Company (BOC). Initially managed by an international team from its parent company, RATP-Group based in France, the BOC, responsible for operating and maintaining the Gautrain system under the Concession, has evolved into predominantly a South African-operated enterprise. Due to the integration of localised skills, capabilities, and operational support, BOC stands in a prime position to not only continue with the Gautrain services, but also offer their seamless multimodal integrated public transport system solutions, into the rest of the Southern African Region.\n\nBOC is the local subsidiary of RATP Group, their global operations embody a true testament to their commitment to integrated seamless transportation services. As Didier articulates, the company ensures that passengers experience a seamless journey, right from their doorstep to their destination. In South Africa, this begins with a well-coordinated bus feeder system that aids passengers in reaching the stations from their homes and vice versa, predominantly during the morning and evening rush. Within the stations, passengers are met with an array of amenities: from advanced equipment to purchase tickets to state-of-the-art infrastructures such as travelators, lifts, and escalators and passenger information systems. This guarantees that every individual, regardless of their requirements, navigates the system effortlessly.\n\nThe company’s dedication to timely service is further evident with trains available every ten minutes during peak hours and every twenty minutes during off-peak hours. Upon reaching their destinations, passengers have access to an assortment of services, including buses, Midi buses, and external transport providers such as taxis and e-hailing services within the vicinity of the station.\n\nA noteworthy aspect of BOC’s offering is their train routes, especially the connection to and from OR Tambo International Airport via the ORTIA Station. Additionally, for those opting to drive to the various stations and park, the Gautrain system provides expansive and secure parking spaces across all their stations, except for the airport station.\n\nHighlighting the importance of connectivity, Sandton Station stands out as a pivotal hub. This station connects major train lines, including the North-South and the Airport line, and offers unparalleled access to shopping centres, offices, and conference venues.\n\nIn essence, BOC’s approach to public transport is holistic. They view their services not as standalone offerings, but as interconnected elements, all meticulously designed to ensure passengers reach their destinations swiftly, efficiently, and most importantly safely.\n\nBOC’s operations are driven by performance metrics, encompassing punctuality, availability, safety, security, and maintenance. These metrics are guided by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that typically exceed a 98% threshold. These KPIs are gauged using the Availability Software Module (ASWM) system, compiling the data. This system is tamper-proof, eliminating any possibility of human interference or data manipulation.\n\n“Not surprisingly, most of our performance levels are currently above 99%. The high standards ensure that BOC avoids penalties for not delivering optimal service levels,” explains Lescloupé.\n\n“The operational timetable for BOC is meticulously organised. While passenger services run from 05:30 to 20:30, the period before and after this is bustling with activity. “Our operations truly work around the clock, 24/7, ensuring that services remain uninterrupted and of the highest quality,” explains Lescloupé.”\n\nFrom a maintenance perspective, once the last train has been stationed in the depot post-20:30, the night becomes a beehive of maintenance activities. These tasks, which cover everything from the railway to the stations, commence during the designated “engineering hours” from 22:00. This strategic timing ensures passengers remain undisturbed. Whether it’s the track, the power supply system, safety features in tunnels, or lighting and ventilation – everything undergoes thorough inspection and repair. By 04:00, all systems are ready for the operations team to begin preparing for customer service duties.\n\n“Every minute is accounted for. This meticulous planning and execution ensure that BOC offers reliable and seamless services to its passengers daily. The global expertise of RATP significantly elevates this operational excellence, bringing in best practices and innovative solutions to enhance the already high standards set by BOC,” says Lescloupé.\n\n“Passenger safety is paramount, and it has been embedded in our systems right from the design phase. We have implemented advanced technologies like the Automatic Train Protection (ATP), which ensures train drivers adhere to speed limits and don’t pass signals at danger. This system functions as a safeguard against human error, continually supervising driver behaviour,” highlights Lescloupé.\n\nThe infrastructural design of the railway system itself houses an array of safety features. For instance, tunnels are equipped with ventilation systems that guard against smoke, and robust pumps to prevent flooding. In the event of an unforeseen situation requiring passengers to be evacuated while in a tunnel, large shelter rooms have been built where passengers can wait securely until the situation is rectified. Additionally, these shelter spaces are connected to the exterior via shafts, which are accessible by emergency services and firefighting professionals.\n\nThe safety of the operations is perpetually monitored from the Operational Control Centre (OCC) and station control rooms. Dedicated staff are rigorously trained to manage any equipment or system failures, always ensuring passenger safety.\n\nLescloupé notes, “BOC’s comprehensive Safety Management System (SMS) has been designed drawing from the rich expertise of our parent company, the RATP Group, and local specialists from various fields. This system facilitates consistent documentation and analysis of safety incidents, fostering a culture of continuous improvement in our operational procedures, work directives, and training programmes.”\n\nTo further emphasise the collective expertise, Lescloupé explains that it is not just BOC or RATP Group’s proficiency that ensures safety. Renowned contractors like Alstom and others have contributed their specialised knowledge to this specific project, where the primary objective is twofold: ensuring the utmost safety of passengers and maintaining the optimal performance of the system. “Every day, our experts meticulously review system-generated records to ensure no emerging safety issues go unnoticed. Regular checks and training ensure that our staff adheres to established safety rules, with a particular emphasis on the ‘golden rules’ that are frequently reiterated to maintain a culture of safety vigilance,” explains Lescloupé.\n\nCommitment to Operational Excellence: Strict adherence to the daily operation parameters of the Gautrain, concerning revenue service hours, timetables, and fare products, ensures that departures, regularity, and travel times are consistent for passengers. Nevertheless, should unforeseen incidents arise that cause deviations from the set schedule, BOC is equipped to mitigate the effects swiftly. For example, if there’s a prolonged disruption, BOC would implement a bus replacement service that bypasses the affected section of the line, ensuring passengers face minimal inconvenience until the rail operation is restored.\n\nOpen Dialogue & Collaboration: BOC continuously engages in discussions with the Gautrain Concessionaire (BCC) and the Gautrain Management Agency (GMA) about the evolution of the Gautrain system and enhancing the multi-modality of its network. A case in point is the introduction and development of the Midibus feeder service, which wasn’t part of the original contract. Over time, this service has expanded, allowing even more passengers to connect to various stations.\n\nAdherence to Contractual Requirements: Lescloupé explains, “Engineering services are responsible for creating all the timetables and staff rosters, which offer us a degree of flexibility in our operations. However, it’s important to note that this flexibility has its bounds. We have a binding contract that mandates specific operational guidelines, such as maintaining certain headways throughout the day. While we aim for flexibility, it’s imperative for us to adhere to these contractual requirements, which are underscored by key performance indicators. This commitment ensures a balance between adapting to on-the-spot challenges, like handling equipment failures, and upholding our service quality and consistency.”\n\nManagement Information System (MIS): Over the years, BOC has developed a robust Management Information System that consolidates data from various systems and equipment. This system is crucial for daily performance and safety monitoring. The data BOC collects is pivotal for reporting to all stakeholders on both contractual Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and internally defined KPIs. The spectrum of data encompasses areas like train and bus availability, punctuality, system safety and cleanliness, and even the time and attendance records of their employees.\n\nSafeTracker System: An integrated information system, that captures a myriad of operational data points – ranging from performance metrics, delays, passenger counts, revenues, equipment failures, and more. This data is then processed and converted into actionable indicators. BOC then steers its operations based on these indicators, continually striving for enhancement.\n\nDriverless Trains: The RATP Group is an experienced operator in the realm of automated transport solutions, particularly in the operational aspects of driverless train systems. As technology advances, driverless trains are garnering increased attention and deployment worldwide.\n\nSustainability and Eco-Friendly Solutions: An example of BOC’s innovative approach can be observed in the Paris network’s new stations. These stations feature geothermal systems that harness sustainable energy to control the temperature in both public and staff areas. Such an approach aligns with the increasing ecological expectations of the public.\n\nPassenger-Centric Innovations: As Didier highlighted, data holds significant importance. It’s not solely about operations but also about comprehending passenger needs and preferences. Regular surveys are conducted to measure passenger satisfaction. Insights derived from these surveys play a pivotal role in fine-tuning operations to stay attuned to the changing desires and expectations of passengers.\n\n“When envisioning the future of mobility as a service, and the advantages of technology and innovation – especially concerning technology surrounding driverless trains, advancements in signalling, improved train management and ticketing, there are boundless possibilities. However, one critical element to always remember is the human factor. The presence and assistance of staff on the line to the passengers remain paramount,” notes Lescloupé\n\nIt is impossible to discuss technology and innovation without addressing the concern of cybersecurity, especially for a highly digitalised system. The first layer of defence is that the systems, like the BOC control centre for Gautrain, are closed-loop systems, isolated from external connections. This detachment is intentional to prevent potential threats like hacking, which might not directly control the trains but could manipulate elements like the power supply. These systems come with safety and security integrity levels, currently at level four. The primary strength, however, lies in the fact that these systems are insulated and cannot be externally accessed.\n\n“Drawing from the vast expertise of BOC in the realm of multi-modal transport networks and the rich experience and capabilities of our parent company, we envision a bright and integrated future for public transport in South Africa and potentially the broader region.\n\nGautrain stands as a testament to our vision for a fully multi-modal transport system, integrating various modes such as buses, midibuses, trains, car parks, and taxis, all available at the stations we operate. Furthermore, our seamless integration with domestic and international airlines at ORTIA Station, and trains at Park, Rhodesfield or Pretoria, exemplifies the direction in which we aspire for the entirety of Gauteng’s transport system.\n\nThe next progression, as I perceive, which the authorities are actively working towards, is an expansive, interconnected network equipped with an interoperable ticketing system. Such systems have been successfully implemented in several cities globally, albeit challenges arise when heritage networks need to be integrated,” concludes Lescloupé.\n\nSouth Africa, boasting the most advanced railway network in the region, is ripe for growth. While numerous upgrade, refurbishing, and modernisation projects are in motion, there’s vast potential in efficiently bridging freight transport between rail and road. Reflecting on RATP Group’s involvement in projects such as the Channel Tunnel linking France and England showcases the opportunities available. Such integration, where heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) are safely loaded onto trains to bypass natural obstacles, is a viable solution for South Africa, especially in areas where truck movement hinders traffic fluidity.\n\nExpanding on these insights, the Gautrain system is an emblematic precursor for what can be achieved on a grander scale. All essential components, including buses, midibuses, trains, and taxis, are already unified under this system. For a holistic, well-oiled transportation ecosystem in the region, it is imperative that all public transport operators converge under a unified scheme."
