        "text": "Project information\n\nAround 3 billion people each year ride the Paris metro, tram, bus and regional express trains through Paris and the ÃŽle-de-France. That makes the RATP the densest and largest metropolitan transportation system in the world.\n\nTo keep Parisians and visitors flowing seamlessly, the RATP must keep its communications flowing seamlessly, as well. To that end, RATP relies on a fully integrated Airbus TETRA network to connect 15,000 users on:\n\n4,348 buses\n\n321 metro stations\n\n2 RER lines (66 train stations)\n\n2 tramway lines.\n\nTETRA solution\n\nThe network supports RATP in Paris and also in its surrounding areas, and it consists of Airbus TETRA switches and 450 base stations.\n\nWhen setting up RAPT's network, one of the key questions was how to provide adequate underground coverage.\n\nAmong other things, engineers had to:\n\nShare cables between different radio networks\n\nManage planning and power budgets\n\nCreate successful handovers in the tunnels.\n\nRATP uses the TETRA system in particular for:\n\nGroup calls\n\nStatus and SDS messages\n\nEmergency calls.\n\nThey also use Dynamic Group Number Assignment (DGNA). This allows RATP to create unique user groups on demand for special events or special needs, such as incident communications.\n\nThe TETRA system helps RATP keep Paris Metro, buses and trams moving!"
