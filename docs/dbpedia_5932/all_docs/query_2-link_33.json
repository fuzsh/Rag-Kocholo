        "text": "The finance team at multimodal transportation enterprise RATP Dev knows something about growth and complexity. Serving more than 1.5 billion passengers each year in 14 countries across 4 continents, RATP Dev operates in some of the worldâ€™s most dense transportation networks. For the finance team, this translated into laborious forecast and budget processes using manual spreadsheets across distributed teams, which resulted in a lack of buy-in across leadership and operations. The company needed a better way to manage its growth and complexity. With the help of partner CohnReznick, RATP Dev turned to Workday Adaptive Planning to streamline budgeting and forecasting, increase report accuracy, and improve organizational alignment with KPIs."
