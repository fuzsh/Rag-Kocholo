The first metro line crossed the French capital. It was opened for the Paris world fair on July 19, 1900, after less than eighteen months of construction—an impressive feat.\n\nSince then, we've kept on innovating, from the first hydraulic metros in the fifties to electric trams and driverless shuttles today. That technical excellence has propelled us to our current status as the global leader in automated subways and trams.\n\nThe foundation of RATP Dev in 2002 was a watershed moment. The goal was to develop, operate and maintain new transportation systems in France, Europe, and around the world, drawing on the know-how of RATP Group. We've never looked back. Some 1.5 billion passengers use our transit systems every year. As we grow, our know-how grows too. But our passion stays the same: to build along with you and bring cities around the world the excellence of innovative, sustainable transportation.\n\nTogether, building the city of tomorrow\n\nEvery city is one-of-a-kind. Ready-made solutions won't do. We offer tailored solutions adapted to your needs.\n\nWith you—transit authorities, local decision-makers and partners—we build solutions based on extensive analysis of your specific expectations and requirements, and those of passengers. The result is a solution tailored to you.\n\nOur expertise across all transportation modes helps you choose the most appropriate solution. From there on we take care of all the rest, from study and design to building, controls, commissioning, operational maintenance, operation, and ticketing. We're there for the duration thanks to adaptations designed with you, for you.\n\nTaking action for an excellent passenger experience\n\nWe are proud of our most precious resource—the men and women who work for RATP Dev. People are at the heart of what we do. That means offering our staff meaningful opportunities, and bringing customers and passengers the solutions they trust us to provide. The goal is to give everyone access to convenient transportation and a more pleasant city to live in."
