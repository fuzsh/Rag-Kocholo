        "text": "Worst public transport company I’ve seen in the worst city I have been.\n\nWorst transport company I have ever had to deal with by far! Scammed me into paying a 35euros fine although I had purchased and validated a ticket. They said it was not valid. Given how poorly the whole infrastructure are managed and maintained, I would assume the gate did not work correctly but that should not be the customer’s problem. On top of that, for the few stations with escalators, they were all out of order, so I had to carry 2x25kg suitcases up and down the stairs. God this city is an absolute joke. You go to your local zoo and observe animals for less money, and a very similar experience.\n\nDate of experience : June 24, 2024\n\nScammed, harassed as a tourist on first day\n\nAbsolutely terrible experience on my first day in Paris. Paid 35€ for a weekly, unlimited travel pass. (Navigo card). Was never informed once that a picture was required to be posted on the back by the ticket distributors.On our second day, our group of 5 was approached (targeted) , harassed, insulted, and forced to pay a 35 - 50 euro fine. We were then laughed at afterwards. Completely started our trip off on a terrible note, and left a very bad impression on the city in general. The worst thing is, the entire metropolitan staff is complicit in this scam. The process for getting a photo as a tourist is not straightforward. We had to find a grocery store with a photobooth(it couldn’t be done at a metro station, of course) , borrow scissors, and finally finish our arts and craft procesure to pic a picture of our face on our bus pas, despite being here for 3 days. Travellers beware.\n\nDate of experience : May 17, 2024\n\nAbsolute scum of a business\n\nAbsolute scum of a business. The dirtiest public transportation in all of Europe not surprised at all if it is still plagued with bed bugs. Workers are aggressive too. Masterclass on how to run a disaster business. My friend first time visiting Paris accidentally threw his ticket after he enter and exited the turnstile. The worker at the station confronted him at the exit stair demanding him to pay a fine or else he’s going to call the police and double the fine. Wouldn’t even listen to us showing him the receipt. A proper business tie with the city acting like a bunch of thug threatening people with the police force. Do better. Have some class, some courtesy. Re train your employees. Maybe use your fund clean the train instead of hounding customers to pay money for policy that’s not even once mentioned in English or anywhere that’s explicitly visible.\n\nDate of experience : December 03, 2023\n\nScammed by RATP staff\n\nWas in Paris for Roland Garros with a friend and decided to take the metro. We bought a pair of single use tickets each and entered at Saint-Augustin station using our tickets at the gates. As we were exiting at Michel Ange Molitor, a group of people in RATP uniform approached us and asked for our tickets. They took away our tickets and told us that these were not valid, and that we had to pay a fine of EUE 35 (for my friend) and EUR 50 (for me). Not sure what this fine differentiation was about. We refused to pay saying we didn't do anything wrong, and the officers got very aggressive and were constantly asking to see our IDs. They told us that they were going to call the police, and then we would need to pay EUR 90 on top for the police visit. I called the police myself, and was told that the police would not attend in this instance. Intimidation and threatening continued for about an hour. After that, they let us go. The scary thing is that there was no security anywhere in the station. I am not sure whether this group was made of legitimate RATP staff members, but after reading about many similar stories you would hope that RATP would look into addressing this scam by implementing even a slightly more modern payment system, and installing CCTV. Absolutely awful.\n\nDate of experience : May 24, 2024\n\nRatp fine theives\n\nVisiting Paris. Ought two tickets for the tram. Entered the tram dat down in our seats and were immediately accosted by ratp who said that because we hadn't put our tickets in the very inconspicuous validation machine in the tram. They were going to charge us 70 euros. If we didn't pay immediately they would call the police. We were very intimidated snd frightened, despite having two purchased tickets we paid the fine. I am so dissapointed that this is common practise on the ratp. Puts me off visiting Paris again.\n\nDate of experience : September 22, 2023\n\nOne star is too generous\n\nWhat a complete and utter disaster, firstly the metro service is a shambles and is barely functional. That I could deal with. The aptly named 'Rat pee' RATP is an absolute abomination and France as a whole should be so embarrassed and ashamed. They prey on tourists to earn a quick euro, using scare tactics and bullying women in groups of 6 or 7. They exaggerate the extent of their powers, which a visiting person would not know and wouldn't want to test. This show of violence results in you paying an extortionate fine, it's totally up to you if you want pinning to the ground before you pay. You can follow the rules to a tee and still get fined so if you are reading this thinking \"we'll be ok\" you really might not be. Awful people doing awful things. Do yourself a favour and get a taxi, it will be cheaper than the inevitable fine you'll pay. Alternatively, go elsewhere as Paris really isn't all it's cracked up to be.\n\nDate of experience : January 02, 2024\n\nController racist and b1tch . Pou!\n\nThe idea that the short black controller with the deformed 4ss gave me the idea of a poor racist who hasn't banged for a long time. You disgust me, and your category of half men and half women who are good just for steal money from guys who have demagnetized tickets. Why are you so disorganized? Explain things? No, much better to steal 70 euros from the tourists and make them cry with your rude and barbaric ways, not to mention that the accumulated stress has ruined a day of vacation. We sweat the money so much, in fact we will no longer spend it in your country. I don't generalise, but people who do this are just being pitiful, they're probably unhappy and must be making life more difficult for strangers, I hope that person in question enjoys seeing her crop sown. RACIST WHOR3\n\nDate of experience : August 16, 2023\n\nNot for nothing are they known as Rat Pee\n\nWe bought 4 metro tickets at the same time (the old cardboard version) as a group of 4 travelling together. Entering the Metro at Monparnasse, 2 tickets opened the barriers and 2 did not. A gate was wide open and many people were passing through it. Assuming a fault with the barriers we did likewise. There were no RATP personnel visible to provide advice. Hiding round a corner further down was a group of RATP officials who tested our tickets and demanded a total of 85 euros in fines for having invalid tickets. They ignored our explanation and under time pressure to make a Eurostar connection at Gare du Nord we paid up. At Gare du Nord 2 othe RATP officials looked at our receipts for the fines and said this was most \"abnormal\" and \"not just\". RATO have rejected our complaint.\n\nDate of experience : April 16, 2023\n\nBest Transport company with RATPDev Transit London\n\nRATPDev Transit London you are the best bus and metro company ever I have seen! Amazing seating and I live on your route London Bus 110! You guys have very comfortable seating and I recommend you having loads more metro stock ad loads more bus routes! I really wan to work for you when I am older because it has been one of my childhood dreams! Have a good year serving London, Paris and maybe many other cities! Keep up the busy work. But your X140 route in London has like 5 stops running from Heathrow to Harrow but it’s okay. Maybe routes 33,70,110,235 and N33 should be double deckers and make metros go to Saint Quentin en Yvelis\n\nDate of experience : May 03, 2023\n\nI would stay away from theunnecessary…\n\nI would stay away from theunnecessary French intimidation and aggression.\n\nI would be embarrassed to be English if this was happening here.\n\nMy partner and I had a similar experience recently where we were basically bullied into paying a fine when we had done nothing wrong.\n\nAt one point 2 guys separated myself and my partner and put me on a corner and used physical force to keep me there. I ctually thought it was some kind of joke, but sadly no, just French aggression, bullying and intimidation at its finest.\n\nLuckily I kept my cool otherwise I would have played further into their trap.\n\nBe very careful when visiting.\n\nTo top it all the French Eurostar drivers went on strike on Sunday morning so we had to spend £500 on flights to get home.\n\nGreat performance all round from the French transport system this weekend, outstanding. Bravo.\n\nDate of experience : May 12, 2023"
