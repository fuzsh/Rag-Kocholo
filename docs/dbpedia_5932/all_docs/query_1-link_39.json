        "text": "Event\n\nUnionized bus and tram service employees of Paris public transportation operator RATP plan to stage a three-day strike in the French capital and the surrounding Ile-de-France Region starting May 23. The purpose of the work stoppage is to protest stalled negotiations over working hours. The labor action will primarily impact bus and tram services throughout the RATP transport network. Metro and rail services throughout the city and the surrounding area, including transport to and from Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) and Paris-Orly Airport (ORY), may also be affected as passengers use alternative methods of transportation.\n\nIn addition to the direct impact on public transport in the greater Paris metropolitan area, the walkout could result in increased traffic congestion and demand for taxis and app-based ride-sharing services.\n\nAdvice\n\nReconfirm public transportation schedules if traveling within the greater Paris area May 23-25. Allow extra time to reach destinations. Reserve taxis and private car hires in advance of the strike due to the potential for higher-than-usual demand.\n\nResources"
