His experience includes tendering procedures related to the financing and performance of contracts, such as public work, supply, service contracts, concessions, and public-private partnerships (PPPs). He also has notable experience in French and European regulations of economic activities, including energy (electricity and gas unbundling, producing, transmission, and storage) and transportation (rail and road).\n\nIn addition, Pierre's practice covers French and European CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) regulation, export control, and economic activities in countries under EU and U.S. sanctions; public land and properties (including privatization) and urban planning law; and counseling and litigation aspects of French public law.\n\nBefore joining Jones Day, Pierre worked for a French law firm."
