The owner of Spanish-language AMs serving Latino audiences across the Southeast is grabbing three translators in two separate transactions. Two will be used in a Northeast Florida metropolis, while the third will be used in the Queen City. The sellers: CSN International and Radio Training Network

The owner of a media group devoted to serving Hispanic audiences across the Southeast is grabbing three translators in two separate transactions.

Once the deals are complete, the new owner will be using two of them in a Northeast Florida metropolis, while the third will be used in the Queen City – all thanks to the FCC’s AM revitalization effort.
