        "text": "The following are updates to previously-reported items and other recent regulatory filings and actions concerning Upper Midwest broadcast stations. This report is created by the author and is not an official report of the FCC.\n\nIowa\n\nFollowing the recent grant of a move by KDAO-FM/99.5 (Eldora) to 92.9, the FCC has approved a frequency change for translator K224FM/92.7 (Grundy Center) to 94.3 as K232GG. The translator will reduce power slightly from 250 to 205 Watts. It relays KDAO/1190 (Marshalltown).\n\nMinnesota\n\nFaith Sound’s K220EP/91.9 (La Crescent) went off the air Aug. 24 due to “substantial interference to its reception from an unknown source that made it extremely difficult to receive a clear signal,” according to a request for special temporary authority to remain silent. The filing says it was later determined that the interference was coming from WDRT/91.9 (Viroqua), which upgraded its signal last year. (August was also a month of strong tropospheric propagation.) K220EP’s filing says it cannot continue to operate until it finds a solution to the problem. The translator relays KFSI/92.9 (Rochester).\n\nCSN International’s K201IQ/88.1 (Fergus Falls) has gone off the air due to the recent sign-on of KJCL/88.3 (Fergus Falls), which is owned by We Have This Hope Christian Radio.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nNew station KCBJ/90.7 (Jamestown) is operating under program test authority, according to a license to cover application. It’s owned by Fargo Baptist Church, which also owns KFBN/88.7 (Fargo). KCBJ uses 550W/52m (class A).\n\nDouble Z Broadcasting’s KZZY/103.5 (Devils Lake) is operating at half of its licensed 100kW ERP due to a transmitter tube failure. It requested special temporary authority to operate at the reduced power while repairs are made.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nGray TV’s KHME (Rapid City) was granted special temporary authority for its digital replacement translator on RF channel 18 to operate at 11.67kW, rather than its licensed 15kW, due to equipment failure.\n\nThe FCC approved an upgrade for future American Christian Radio station KFCA/88.1 (Aberdeen) from the originally-planned 800W/47m to 2.3kW/31m.\n\nWisconsin\n\nArmada’s AMC Partners Rice Lake LLC closed on its purchase of the TKC Inc. group of stations in Rice Lake on Oct. 3. The group includes WJMC-FM/96.1, WAQE-FM/97.7 (Barron), WKFX/99.1, WAQE/1090 and its translator W299CQ/107.7, and WJMC/1240 and its translator W243ED/96.5.\n\nThe FCC approved a frequency change by David Magnum’s W241BQ/96.1 (Watertown) to 103.3 as W277EA. The translator relays WSJY-HD2 (Fort Atkinson).\n\nMeanwhile, Magnum’s W300CM/107.9 (Appleton) was granted a move to 106.9 as W295DO, continuing to relay WJOK/1050 (Kaukauna). It will upgrade from 90 to 250 Watts.\n\nThe FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking about Weigel Broadcasting/TV-49’s previously-reported proposal to change the community of license for a future TV station on channel 31 from Wittenberg to Shawano.\n\nDisclosure: Jon Ellis is an employee of Gray Media Group.
