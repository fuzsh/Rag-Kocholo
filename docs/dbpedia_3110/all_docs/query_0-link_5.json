As this vision became a reality, CSN was born and God’s Word was broadcast through the airways. Since that time, CSN has grown through the financial support of our listeners and the blessings of God.\n\nPaul wrote in Romans 12:2, “And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is the good, and acceptable and perfect will of God.” Our mission is the feeding of God’s sheep as instructed in His Holy Word. Our aim is to follow these instructions by broadcasting Biblical teaching and anointed Praise and Worship Music 24 hours a day to communities throughout the United States and the world. Jesus said we become strong by the Word of God abiding in us, and our desire is that our audience will find this ministry to be a point of spiritual growth, maturity, and encouragement.\n\nUNMATCHED REACH\n\nCSN Radio is the largest Christian Teaching and Talk radio network in the US.\n\nWe operate 396 stations/signals.\n\nWe have coverage reaching nearly 32% of the US population.\n\nWe reach a cumulative population of 104,032,922 people.\n\nWe have a presence in 43 states and operate stations/signals in 26 out of the top 100 radio markets.\n\nPROMOTING YOUR PROGRAM\n\nWorking with many radio groups and over the course of seven years, CSN’s research partner has analyzed over 4 billion national radio ad responses.

We have seen an immediate return on our investment within our first month! CSN radio’s audience is committed, loyal, and expansive. Info Age Media is very honored to be a part of such an amazing organization that is fully committed to Kingdom principles and excellence in broadcasting. As an agency, we are confident in the performance of CSN Radio and it is exciting to be a part of such a dynamic establishment.”\n\nSarah Wagner, Info Age Media\n\n“Since 2003 we have partnered with CSN to help our clients attract new customers and constituents. We have found the listeners of CSN to be very responsive to our client’s messages. They are exactly the type of folks our clients are seeking to reach and serve. Being a sponsor of CSN is especially rewarding for ministries and non-profit organizations.”\n\nDave Barton, Cornerstone Communications\n\n“We have been underwriters on CSN for over 9 years for a very good reason–it reaches Christians that are serious about their faith, and very responsive. We’re grateful for our long-term partnership with this ministry and encourage others to try CSN for themselves. You’ll be glad you did!”\n\nBruce Thompson, President of On A Mission Communications\n\n“Westar Media buys a significant amount of radio airtime for Christian broadcast ministries on stations and networks across the country. The CSN Network is our #1 ranked station/network for new donor acquisition, ROI, and audience reach.”\n\nDave Koch, President of Westar Media Group\n\n“CSN provides a cost-effective solution to reaching a large majority of the Country and it’s clear to us that they reach an audience who loves Jesus and consistently engages with the ministry opportunities they hear about on-air. As an agency that serves both those ministries that produce programming and those that want to connect radio listeners to where God is working, we are grateful for the partnership we have with CSN.”\n\nJack Hibbard, President of The Hibbard Group\n\n“Hardwired radio broadcast joined CSN in 2014. Our outreach and accompanying audience response have jumped in both feedback and giving. CSN’s reach through over 380 stations nationwide has proven to be a great boon to our dream of reaching the masses with God’s Word!”\n\nJeff Wickwire – Founder and Host of Hardwired\n\n“This past year (2020), Family Research Council and Washington Watch with Tony Perkins were delighted to become a broadcast partner with CSN Radio. For decades, CSN has boldly proclaimed God’s truth and love while fulfilling the Great Commission of Jesus Christ over the American airwaves and through the global reach of the internet. Through this partnership, Washington Watch now reaches millions of new listeners interested in understanding today’s issues from a biblical perspective. As we continue serving alongside CSN, we look forward to further equipping believers to do the work of the ministry and impact the world around them for Christ.”\n\nTony Perkins – President of Family Research Council\n\n“Aloha from Hawaii, this is Pastor Derald Skinner of Calvary Chapel Pearl Harbor and ‘A Chosen Generation’ radio broadcast, our outreach ministry has been truly blessed through the Christian Satellite Network (CSN). We are enjoying an excellent relationship with the staff of CSN and an enormous outreach to so many listeners. It is exciting to hear from fellow believers who love to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! CSN has also become an outreach to non-believers who tune in and hear the gospel of salvation! CSN also provides a great opportunity to contend for the faith in a time of so many heresies. Jesus said, “Go therefore and make disciples,” CSN has become a highway to the airways, locally, nationally, and internationally! Mahalo CSN, let’s Go4God!!!”\n\nPastor Derald Skinner – Calvary Chapel Pearl Harbor and ‘A Chosen Generation’ radio broadcast\n\n“I have been doing radio shows for many years as a pastor, and now as the producer of the Christian Financial Concepts show. Our experience as a ministry with CSN Radio has been a joy. Everyone we have interacted with has been kind, professional, and caring. We can tell they genuinely want to see our ministry of teaching Biblical financial management succeed. They have some of the best-known Bible teachers in the world on their stations, yet they have treated us the same as they treat them. The feedback we have received has been wonderful. We have had callers tell us that they get up early every Saturday to hear the show, and many tell us they haven’t missed a show in a year. We can measure the results in two ways. First, the number of visitors to ChristianFinancialConcepts.com has increased greatly since we joined the CSN family. Second, the number of people calling for free Biblical financial counseling – or just encouragement – has almost tripled. I would encourage any ministry that is being led to establishing a radio presence to seriously pray about working with CSN. If you would like to speak with me about my experience with CSN, just ask them for my phone number.”\n\nTom Barrett – Christian Financial Concepts\n\n“Thank you for airing Moving Moments! Already, we’ve already seen a big uptick in website visitors. Your staff is incredible to work with and we are grateful to God for this opportunity to spread the Gospel message through this 60 second feature.”\n\nCindy Tang – Moving Moments with Cindy Tang\n\n“We’re thankful to the Lord for what He’s done and continues to do through CSN. They have been very good to our ministry partners and made us feel like a part of the family since day one! Their commitment to excellence, as well as the preaching of the Word of God, is greatly appreciated and needed in a day like ours.”\n\nMatt White – Genesis Radio Productions\n\n“We’ve enjoyed a productive ministry partnership with CSN since the very beginning. Through that partnership, we’ve been able to share the Gospel and bring the teaching of God’s Word to countless people across the country. Our culture has never needed that message more than now. We hear from many CSN listeners who tune in faithfully every day, and we appreciate their friendship and support. We’re thankful for the decades-long friendship with our ministry partners at CSN Radio.”\n\nGreg Laurie – Harvest Ministries\n\n“CSN has been such a wonderful partner in ministry for Pastor Greg Laurie and Harvest Ministries. They’ve aired our daily broadcasts along with our yearly Harvest Crusades for more years than we count. We’ve found the network to be an important pipeline to areas of the country that are largely underserved with Christian radio options. Their mission perfectly aligns with Harvest’s. It’s all about Knowing God and Making Him Known.”\n\nDave Spiker – Imagination Media for Harvest Ministries\n\n“When we joined CSN in 2019, it significantly extended our reach, giving us the ability to extend the gospel from coast to coast. Through their network, we’re able to reach hundreds of cities as well as many rural areas that are harder to access. We’re thankful for the opportunity to partner with CSN. Together, we’re transforming lives as we broadcast hope and truth across the nation.”\n\nAllen Jackson – Senior Pastor of Word Outreach Church\n\n“In our relentless pursuit of sharing the hope of the Gospel and the truth of God’s word to as many people as possible, CSN radio has been an instrumental partner helping us do that very thing. We thank God for the avenues of opportunities that are open to us through CSN’s far-reaching network.”\n\nPastor Jack Hibbs – Real Life Radio and Calvary Chapel Chino Hills\n\nTo find out more or join CSN, email or call:\n\nMike Stevens, Program Director\n\nMikeStevens@csnradio.com\n\nFacebook.com/CSNradio\n\nInstagram.com/CSNradio\n\nCSNradio.com/Stations\n\nPROGRAMMING\n\nWEEKDAY BROADCAST TIMES – MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE\n\nDAYPART TIMES *COST PER PLAY AM Drive 5-11AM $750.00 Mid-Day 11AM-4PM $500.00 PM Drive 4-8PM $750.00 Evening 8PM-12AM $500.00 Overnight 12AM-5AM $250.00\n\n*Per Play Cost: Listed for 27 minute programs\n\nWEEKEND BROADCAST TIMES – MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE\n\nDAYPART TIMES *COST PER PLAY AM Drive 5-11AM $500.00 Mid-Day 11AM-4PM $500.00 PM Drive 4-8PM $500.00 Evening 8PM-12AM $250.00 Overnight 12AM-5AM $100.00\n\n*Per Play Cost: Listed for 27 minute programs\n\nSHORT PROGRAMS\n\n0:60’s – $750.00* per month\n\n2:00’s – $1,500* per month\n\n*Based on 1x air play per day\n\nUNDERWRITING\n\n“Advertisement”\n\n60 sec – 2:00 mins\n\nAll Stations\n\nUnderwriting Spot Requirements – Minimum of 2 Week run and/or 3x a day\n\nProfit Business Agency/Ministry Church 30 seconds for $180 30 seconds for $150 30 seconds for $20 60 seconds for $210 60 seconds for $180 60 seconds for $50\n\nStation List\n\nApril 2024"
