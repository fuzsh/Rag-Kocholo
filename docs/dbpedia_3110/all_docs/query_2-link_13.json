        "text": "The Deaf Studies Program prepares students to interact with the Deaf community in a variety of situations. Students develop a strong understanding of American Sign Language, Deaf culture and history.\n\nWhy Study Deaf Studies at CSN?\n\nAmerican Sign Language is the official visual-gestural language of the American Deaf community. Trending in media and popular culture, ASL is now recognized as one of the most sought after languages to learn. Increasing evidence indicates that learning a second language, specifically a visual language, has multiple benefits supporting cognitive development, early childhood language learning, and communication access for people with special needs and hearing loss.\n\nLearning ASL can transition to a range of unique employment opportunities such as sign language interpreting, counseling, education, administration and social services. Fluency in ASL can also increase access and marketability of your business or industry to the Deaf community."
