By uncovering the remains of buildings and household bits and pieces of previous civilizations we learn who the people were and when and how they lived.\n\nIn Evidence for the Bible, these once darkened windows are dusted and made clear, helping us discover archaeological finds that confirm or illustrate the biblical account. The authors’ purpose was to provide a reliable summary of the up-to-date positions in laymen’s terms, with added reference books suggested for deeper study into the various subjects addressed."
