        "text": "New Zealand has a relatively recent history of coastal impacts induced by human activities, but these have seriously impaired natural dune integrity and resilience. An early NZ botanist reported his observations of natural dune buffer function and the likely consequences of the all-pervading and escalating degradation of formerly stable NZ dunes: “coastal dunes … form a natural defence to the land against the encroachment of the sea, and, their movement inland is a national concern … while yearly further destruction takes place, the evil … becoming more difficult to suppress”. (Dr L. Cockayne 1911). This was some 4 centuries after King Christian II was alarmed by comparable dune degradation issues in his native Denmark, consequently drafting the world’s first Sand Drift Act in 1539. Over recent years, the variety of untenable, accepted human impacts have only amplified coastal hazards. Just one mitigation method has attempted to work with - rather than forlornly battle against – natural coastal processes. The information below reveals the success of these, with three typical cases in the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand.\n\nHistorically in New Zealand, coastal environments were viewed as amenities for subdivision to be incorporated into town structure plans with little regard for hazards and scientific investigation. This subdivision of coastal land has led to the proliferation of developments that are increasingly vulnerable to the slow landward creep of sea level rise and increasing extreme storm events. Planning and management of vulnerable coastal communities and infrastructure could benefit from an emphasis on sustainable and resilient adaptation through managed retreat away from coastal hazards. However, it is not at all clear exactly how managed retreat can be accomplished. This chapter explores methods for analysing the interactions and manifestations of complex intersecting environmental and economic systems that are implicit in a managed retreat from coastal hazards. These complex systems can be quantifiably analysed using the principles of evolutionary economics, which enables identification..."
