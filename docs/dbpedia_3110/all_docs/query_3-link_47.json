KAWZ Translators existed before LPFM stations, but LPFM advocates have characterized this proliferation as \"The Great Translator Invasion\". Furthermore, because Calvary Chapel is a non-profit organization and operates non-profit stations, it is not required to have its translators receive KAWZ's signal over the air, as would be required for a commercial station.\n\nThe first satellite-fed translator to begin receiving the network from KAWZ was in Yucca Valley, California. Of note, one of KAWZ's translators, K200AA (Sun Valley, Nevada), is the only broadcast translator in the United States that is allowed to broadcast on 87.9 MHz.\n\nTranslators\n\nCSN International is relayed by an additional 365 translators nationwide.\n\nBoard Members\n\nThe only board member of CSN the (Christian Satellite Network) is Pastor Mike Kestler.
