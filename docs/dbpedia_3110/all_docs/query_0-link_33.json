Civilians and soldiers participated in laboratory- and field-based studies in which ensembles providing five levels of ballistic protection were evaluated, each with progressive increases in protection, mass (3.4-11.0 kg), and surface-area coverage (0.25-0.52 m(2)). Physiological trials were conducted on volunteers (N = 8) in a laboratory, under hot-dry conditions simulating an urban patrol: walking at 4 kmÂ·h(-1) (90 min) and 6 kmÂ·h(-1) (30 min or to fatigue). Field-based trials were used to evaluate tactical battlefield movements (mobility) of soldiers (N = 31) under tropical conditions, and across functional tests of power, speed, agility, endurance, and balance. Finally, trials were conducted at a jungle training centre, with soldiers (N = 32) patrolling under tropical conditions (averaging 5 h). In the laboratory, work tolerance was reduced as protection increased, with deep-body temperature climbing relentlessly. However, the protective ensembles could be grouped into two equally stressful categories, each providing a different level of ballistic protection. This outcome was supported during the mobility trials, with the greatest performance decrement evident during fire and movement simulations, as the ensemble mass was increased (-2.12%Â·kg(-1)). The jungle patrol trials similarly supported this outcome. Therefore, although ballistic protection does increase physiological strain, this research has provided a basis on which to determine how that strain can be balanced against the mission-specific level of required personal protection.\n\nApplications of computational modeling in ballistics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSturek, Walter B.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe development of the technology of ballistics as applied to gun launched Army weapon systems is the main objective of research at the U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL). The primary research programs at the BRL consist of three major ballistic disciplines: exterior, interior, and terminal. The work done at the BRL in these areas was traditionally highly dependent on experimental testing. A considerable emphasis was placed on the development of computational modeling to augment the experimental testing in the development cycle; however, the impact of the computational modeling to this date is modest. With the availability of supercomputer computational resources recently installed at the BRL, a new emphasis on the application of computational modeling to ballistics technology is taking place. The major application areas are outlined which are receiving considerable attention at the BRL at present and to indicate the modeling approaches involved. An attempt was made to give some information as to the degree of success achieved and indicate the areas of greatest need.\n\nHistorical overview of wound ballistics research.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaiden, Nick\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBallistics involves the study of the scientific properties of projectiles, their behavior and their terminal effects on biological tissues and other materials. Wound ballistics deals with the analysis of injuries caused by projectiles and the behavior of projectiles within human or other biological tissues. The nineteenth century witnessed the development of both of these areas with Kocher's hydrodynamic theory and the understanding of the significance of bullet deformation in causing tissue injury. The degree of traumatic disruption of tissues and organs was also related to direct energy transfer from projectiles. While subsequent research has concentrated on elucidating further mechanisms of injury, the exact cause of remote tissue damage from high energy projectiles is still the subject of ongoing research. Much of the contemporary literature regarding wound ballistics concentrates on the forensic aspects and their application for legal purposes, in particular the investigation of shooting scenes. There have been many advances in this area, particularly in relation to the identification of various types of gunshot wounds and how their appearance can be used to establish if a shooting was accidental, deliberate (homicidal) or self inflicted (suicidal).\n\nModeling and Simulation of Ballistic Penetration of Ceramic-Polymer-Metal Layered Systems\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-01-01\n\nARL-RP-0562 â JAN 2016 US Army Research Laboratory Modeling and Simulation of Ballistic Penetration of Ceramic-Polymer-Metal...manufacturerâs or trade names does not constitute an official endorsement or approval of the use thereof.

The bullet path in the human body following skin perforation as well as the damaging effect cannot always be predictable as they depend on various factors such as the bullet's characteristics (velocity, distance, type of firearm and so on) and the tissue types that the bullet passes through. The purpose of this presentation is to highlight the contribution of Computed Tomography (CT) in wound ballistics research. Using CT technology and studying virtual âslicesâ of specific areas on scanned human bodies, allows the evaluation of density and thickness of the skin, the subcutaneous tissue, the muscles, the vital organs and the bones. Density data taken from Hounsfield units can be converted in g/ml by using the appropriate software. By evaluating the results of this study, the anatomy of the human body utilizing ballistic gel will be reproduced in order to simulate the path that a bullet follows. The biophysical analysis in wound ballistics provides another application of CT technology, which is commonly used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines.\n\nThe use of gelatine in wound ballistics research.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarr, D J; Stevenson, T; Mahoney, P F\n\n2018-04-25\n\nBlocks of gelatine are used in both lethality and survivability studies for broadly the same reason, i.e. comparison of ammunition effects using a material that it is assumed represents (some part of) the human body. The gelatine is used to visualise the temporary and permanent wound profiles; elements of which are recognised as providing a reasonable approximation to wounding in humans. One set of researchers aim to improve the lethality of the projectile, and the other to understand the effects of the projectile on the body to improve survivability. Research areas that use gelatine blocks are diverse and include ammunition designers, the medical and forensics communities and designers of ballistic protective equipment (including body armour). This paper aims to provide an overarching review of the use of gelatine for wound ballistics studies; it is not intended to provide an extensive review of wound ballistics as that already exists, e.g. Legal Med 23:21-29, 2016. Key messages are that test variables, projectile type (bullet, fragmentation), impact site on the body and intermediate layers (e.g. clothing, personal protective equipment (PPE)) can affect the resulting wound profiles.\n\nBallistic Analysis of New Military Grade Magnesium Alloys for Armor Applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJones, Tyrone L.; Kondoh, Katsuyoshi\n\nSince 2006, the U.S. Army has been evaluating magnesium (Mg) alloys for ballistic structural applications. While Mg-alloys have been used in military structural applications since WWII, very little research has been done to improve its mediocre ballistic performance. The Army's need for ultra-lightweight armor systems has led to research and development of high strength, high ductility Mg-alloys. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory contracted through International Technology Center-Pacific Contract Number FA-5209-09-P-0158 with the Joining and Welding Research Instituteof Osaka University to develop the next generation of high strength, high ductility Mg-alloys using a novel Spinning Water Atomization Process for rapid solidification. New alloys AMX602 and ZAXE1711 in extruded bar form were characterized for microstructure, mechanical, and ballistic response. Significant increases in ballistic performance were evident when compared to the baseline alloy AZ31B.\n\nBallistic Characterization of the Scalability of Magnesium Alloy AMX602\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-07-01\n\nPowder Metallurgy 4 5.

[ballistic range simulation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nToong, T. Y.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nThis program undertook to seek a basic understanding of non-linear effects associated with caustics, through laboratory simulation experiments of sonic booms in a ballistic range and a coordinated theoretical study of scaling laws. Two cases of superbooms or enhanced sonic booms at caustics have been studied. The first case, referred to as acceleration superbooms, is related to the enhanced sonic booms generated during the acceleration maneuvers of supersonic aircrafts. The second case, referred to as refraction superbooms, involves the superbooms that are generated as a result of atmospheric refraction. Important theoretical and experimental results are briefly reported.\n\nBallistics and anatomical modelling - A review.\n\nPubMed\n\nHumphrey, Caitlin; Kumaratilake, Jaliya\n\n2016-11-01\n\nBallistics is the study of a projectiles motion and can be broken down into four stages: internal, intermediate, external and terminal ballistics. The study of the effects a projectile has on a living tissue is referred to as wound ballistics and falls within terminal ballistics. To understand the effects a projectile has on living tissues the mechanisms of wounding need to be understood. These include the permanent and temporary cavities, energy, yawing, tumbling and fragmenting. Much ballistics research has been conducted including using cadavers, animal models and simulants such as ballistics ordnance gelatine. Further research is being conducted into developing anatomical, 3D, experimental and computational models. However, these models need to accurately represent the human body and its heterogeneous nature which involves understanding the biomechanical properties of the different tissues and organs. Further research is needed to accurately represent the human tissues with simulants and is slowly being conducted. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) would be the managing agency for the program. The proposed action site would utilize existing facilities, and human activity would be confined to areas identified as having no tortoise activity. Two classifications of tests would be conducted under the testing program: (1) open-air tests, and (2) X-Tunnel tests. A series of investigative tests would be conducted to obtain information on DUmoreÂ Â» use under the conditions of each classification. The open-air tests would include DU ammunition hazard classification and combat systems activity tests. Upon completion of each test or series of tests, the area would be decontaminated to meet requirements of DOE Order 5400.5, Radiation Protection of the Public and Environment. All contaminated materials would be decontaminated or disposed of as radioactive waste in an approved low-level Radioactive Waste Management Site (RWMS) by personnel trained specifically for this purpose.Â«Â less\n\nThe National Research Council study: \"Making sense of ballistic missile defense\"\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilkening, Dean A.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThis chapter explains and summarizes the main findings of a recent National Research Council study entitled Making Sense of Ballistic Missile Defense: An Assessment of Concepts and Systems for U.S. Boost-Phase Missile Defense in Comparison to Other Alternatives.\n\nBallistic Evaluation of 7085 Aluminum\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-03-01\n\ndirect-fire threats and a lower strength, higher ductility variant, 7085-T7E02, for underbody blast protection kits.

A. Schmidt, H. N. Zelaznik, B. Hawkins, J. S. Frank, & J. T. Quinn, 1979) accounts for the curvilinear relationship between the magnitude and resulting variability of the muscular forces that influence the success of goal-directed limb movements. The historical roots of impulse-variability theory are reviewed in the 1st part of this article, including the relationship between movement speed and spatial error. The authors then address the relevance of impulse-variability theory for the control of ballistic, multijoint skills, such as throwing, striking, and kicking. These types of skills provide a stark contrast to the relatively simple, minimal degrees of freedom movements that characterized early research. However, the inherent demand for ballistic force generation is a strong parallel between these simple laboratory tasks and multijoint motor skills. Therefore, the authors conclude by recommending experimental procedures for evaluating the adequacy of impulse variability as a theoretical model within the context of ballistic, multijoint motor skill performance.

Comparison of wound profiles showed the fallacy in attempting to judge wound severity using velocity alone, and laid to rest the common belief that in treating a wound caused by a high-velocity missile, one needs to excise tissue far in excess of that which appears damaged. All penetrating projectile wounds, whether civilian or military, therefore should be treated the same regardless of projectile velocity. Diagnosis of the approximate amount and location of tissue disruption is made by physical examination and appropriate radiographic studies. These wounds are contaminated, and coverage with a penicillin-type antibiotic should be provided.\n\nPhysics, ballistics, and psychology: a history of the chronoscope in/as context, 1845-1890.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmidgen, Henning\n\n2005-02-01\n\nIn Wilhelm Wundt's (1832-1920) Leipzig laboratory and at numerous other research sites, the chronoscope was used to conduct reaction time experiments. The author argues that the history of the chronoscope is the history not of an instrument but of an experimental setup. This setup was initially devised by the English physicist and instrument maker Charles Wheatstone (1802-1875) in the early 1840s. Shortly thereafter, it was improved by the German clockmaker and mechanic MatthÃ¤us Hipp (1813-1893). In the 1850s, the chronoscope was introduced to ballistic research. In the early 1860s, NeuchÃ¢tel astronomer Adolphe Hirsch (1830-1901) applied it to the problem of physiological time. The extensions and variations of chronoscope use within the contexts of ballistics, physiology, and psychology presented special challenges. These challenges were met with specific attempts to reduce the errors in chronoscopic experiments on shooting stands and in the psychological laboratory.\n\nA research study for the preliminary definition of an aerophysics free-flight laboratory facility\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCanning, Thomas N.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nA renewed interest in hypervelocity vehicles requires an increase in the knowledge of aerodynamic phenomena. Tests conducted with ground-based facilities can be used both to better understand the physics of hypervelocity flight, and to calibrate and validate computer codes designed to predict vehicle performance in the hypervelocity environment. This research reviews the requirements for aerothermodynamic testing and discusses the ballistic range and its capabilities. Examples of the kinds of testing performed in typical high performance ballistic ranges are described. We draw heavily on experience obtained in the ballistics facilities at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. Prospects for improving the capabilities of the ballistic range by using advanced instrumentation are discussed. Finally, recent developments in gun technology and their application to extend the capability of the ballistic range are summarized.\n\nSuperfund Record of Decision (EPA Region 3): Allegany Ballistics Laboratory (USNavy), Operable Unit 1, Mineral, WV, February 12, 1997\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNONE\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThis decision document presents the selected remedial action for Site 5 Landfill Contents and Surface Soil at the Allegany Ballistics Laboratory (ABL), Rocket Center, West Virginia.

Penetrating and nonpenetrating ballistic injuries are influenced not only by the physical properties of the projectile, but also by its ballistics.

This basic knowledge can be applied to better understand the ultimate craniocerebral consequences of ballistic head injuries.\n\nA Residual Mass Ballistic Testing Method to Compare Armor Materials or Components (Residual Mass Ballistic Testing Method)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBenjamin Langhorst; Thomas M Lillo; Henry S Chu\n\n2014-05-01\n\nA statistics based ballistic test method is presented for use when comparing multiple groups of test articles of unknown relative ballistic perforation resistance. The method is intended to be more efficient than many traditional methods for research and development testing. To establish the validity of the method, it is employed in this study to compare test groups of known relative ballistic performance. Multiple groups of test articles were perforated using consistent projectiles and impact conditions. Test groups were made of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) plates and differed in thickness. After perforation, each residual projectile was captured behind the target andmoreÂ Â» its mass was measured. The residual masses measured for each test group were analyzed to provide ballistic performance rankings with associated confidence levels. When compared to traditional V50 methods, the residual mass (RM) method was found to require fewer test events and be more tolerant of variations in impact conditions.Â«Â less\n\n76 FR 14589 - Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Repeal of Restriction on Ballistic Missile...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-03-17\n\n...-AH18 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Repeal of Restriction on Ballistic Missile...).

Ballistic strength training was developed to improve the functional transfer of strength training; however, no research has investigated this in neurologic populations. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of applying ballistic principles to conventional leg strengthening exercises in individuals with mobility limitations as a result of neurologic injuries. Eleven individuals with neurologic injuries completed seated and reclined leg press using conventional and ballistic techniques. A 2 Ã 2 repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare power measures (peak movement height and peak velocity) between exercises and conditions. Peak jump velocity and peak jump height were greater when using the ballistic jump technique rather than the conventional concentric technique (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that when compared with conventional strengthening exercises, the incorporation of ballistic principles was associated with increased peak height and peak velocities.\n\nA new nonpenetrating ballistic injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarroll, A W; Soderstrom, C A\n\n1978-12-01\n\nA new, nonpenetrating ballistic injury mechanism involving individuals protected by soft body armor is described.

Hospitalization should follow all assaults, regardless of the innocuous appearance of the skin lesion and the apparent well being on the assaulted individual. Therapeutic guidelines for patient management are suggested. Images Fig. 1. Fig. 2. Fig. 3.

The US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) would be the managing agency for the program. The proposed action site would utilize existing facilities, and human activity would be confined to areas identified as having no tortoise activity. Two classifications of tests would be conducted under the testing program: (1) open-air tests, and (2) X-Tunnel tests. A series of investigative tests would be conducted to obtain information on DUmoreÂ Â» use under the conditions of each classification. The open-air tests would include DU ammunition hazard classification and combat systems activity tests. Upon completion of each test or series of tests, the area would be decontaminated to meet requirements of DOE Order 5400.5, Radiation Protection of the Public and Environment. All contaminated materials would be decontaminated or disposed of as radioactive waste in an approved low-level Radioactive Waste Management Site (RWMS) by personnel trained specifically for this purpose.Â«Â less\n\n10.

The development of high speed cameras utilizing electro-optics and the use of lasers for illumination now provide the capability to routinely obtain high quality photographic records of ballistic style experiments. The purpose of this presentation is to review in a visual manner the progress of this technology and how it has impacted ballistic experimentation. Within the framework of development at LLNL, we look at the recent history of large format high-speed photography, and present a number of photographic records that represent the state of the art at themoreÂ Â» time they were made. These records are primarily from experiments involving shaped charges. We also present some examples of current photographic technology, developed within the ballistic community, that has application to hydro diagnostic experimentation at large. This paper is designed primarily as an oral-visual presentation. This written portion is to provide general background, a few examples, and a bibliography.Â«Â less\n\nThe Effects of Ballistic and Non-Ballistic Bench Press on Mechanical Variables.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoir, Gavin L; Munford, Shawn N; Moroski, Lindsey L; Davis, Shala E\n\n2017-02-21\n\nTo investigate the effects of ballistic and non-ballistic bench press performed with loads equivalent to 30 and 90% 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) on mechanical variables. Eleven resistance-trained men (age: 23.0 Â± 1.4 years; mass: 98.4 Â± 14.4 kg) attended four testing sessions where they performed one of the following sessions: 1) three sets of five non-ballistic repetitions performed with a load equivalent to 30% 1-RM (30N-B), 2) three sets of five ballistic repetitions performed with a load equivalent to 30% 1-RM (30B), 3) three sets of four non-ballistic repetitions with a load equivalent to 90% 1-RM (90N-B), 4) three sets of four ballistic repetitions with a load equivalent to 90% 1-RM (90B). Force plates and a 3-D motion analysis system were used to determine the velocity, force, power output (PO) and work during each repetition. The heavier loads resulted in significantly greater forces applied to the barbell (mean differences: 472-783 N, p<0.001), but lower barbell velocities (mean differences: 0.85-1.20 m/s, p<0.001) and PO (mean differences: 118-492 W, pâ¤0.022). The ballistic conditions enhanced the mechanical variables only at the lower load with 30B producing significantly greater force (mean difference: 263 N, p<0.001), velocity (mean difference: 0.33 m/s, p<0.001), and PO (mean difference: 335 W, p<0.001) compared to 30N-B. Furthermore, the increase in PO across the 3 sets in 30B was significantly different from all other conditions (p=0.013). The total mechanical work performed was significantly greater for the conditions with the heavier loads compared to those with the lighter loads (mean differences: 3,62-5,600 J, p<0.001) and that performed during the ballistic conditions was significantly greater than that performed during the non-ballistic conditions with the same load (mean differences: 945-1,030 J, p<0.001).

This study examines the impact of ballistics imaging technology on the productivity of the Boston Police Department's Ballistics Unit. Using negative binomial regression models to analyze times series data on ballistics matches, we find that ballistics imaging technology was associated with a more than sixfold increase in the monthly number of ballistics matches made by the Boston Police Department's Ballistics Unit. Cost-effectiveness estimates and qualitative evidence also suggest that ballistics imaging technology allows law enforcement agencies to make hits that would not have been possible using traditional ballistics methods.\n\nConventional Prompt Global Strike and Long-Range Ballistic Missiles: Background and Issues\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-02-13\n\nBallistic Missiles Congressional Research Service Forward-Based Global Strike ( FBGS ...missiles in the CPGS program.

International safety guidelines and technical literature specify different SMF threshold values regarding ballistic hazards - e.g. 3 mT (directive 2004/40/EC, EN 60601-2-33), and 30 mT (BMAS 2009, directive proposal 2011). Investigations presented in this article were performed in order to experimentally verify SMF threshold for ballistic hazards near MRI scanners used in Poland. Investigations were performed with the use of a laboratory source of SMF (0-30 mT) and MRI scanners of various types. The levels of SMF in which metal objects of various shapes and 0.4-500 g mass are moved by the field influence were investigated. The distance from the MRI scanners (0.2-3T) where hazards may occur were also investigated. Objects investigated under laboratory conditions were moved by SMF of 2.2-15 mT magnetic flux density when they were freely suspended, but were moved by the SMF of 5.6-22 mT when they were placed on a smooth surface. Investigated objects were moved in fields of 3.5-40 mT by MRI scanners. Distances from scanner magnet cover, where ballistic hazards might occur are: up to 0.5 m for 0.2-0.3T scanners; up to 1.3 m for 0.5T scanners; up to 2.0 m for 1.5T scanners and up to 2.5 m for 3T scanners (at the front and back of the magnet). It was shown that SMF of 3 mT magnetic flux density should be taken as the threshold for ballistic hazards. Such level is compatible with SMF limit value regarding occupational safety and health-protected areas/zones, where according to the Polish labor law the procedures of work environment inspection and prevention measures regarding indirect electromagnetic hazards should be applied.

T.; Kennedy, B. M.; Wilson, T. M.; Fitzgerald, R. H.; Tsunematsu, K.; Teissier, A.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nRecent casualties in volcanic eruptions due to trauma from blocks and bombs necessitate more rigorous, ballistic specific risk assessment. Quantitative assessments are limited by a lack of experimental and field data on the vulnerability of buildings to ballistic hazards. An improved, quantitative understanding of building vulnerability to ballistic impacts is required for informing appropriate life safety actions and other risk reduction strategies. We assessed ballistic impacts to buildings from eruptions at Usu Volcano and Mt. Ontake in Japan and compiled available impact data from eruptions elsewhere to identify common damage patterns from ballistic impacts to buildings. We additionally completed a series of cannon experiments which simulate ballistic block impacts to building claddings to investigate their performance over a range of ballistic projectile velocities, masses and energies. Our experiments provide new insights by quantifying (1) the hazard associated with post-impact shrapnel from building and rock fragments; (2) the effect of impact obliquity on damage; and (3) the additional impact resistance buildings possess when claddings are struck in areas directly supported by framing components. This was not well identified in previous work which may have underestimated building vulnerability to ballistic hazards. To improve assessment of building vulnerability to ballistics, we use our experimental and field data to develop quantitative vulnerability models known as fragility functions. Our fragility functions and field studies show that although unreinforced buildings are highly vulnerable to large ballistics (> 20 cm diameter), they can still provide shelter, preventing death during eruptions.\n\nTunnel and field effect carrier ballistics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKaiser, William J.

In civilian practice, bone stabilization of these fractures is different and is not performed by external fixation. Fifteen civilian ballistic fractures, Gustilo II or IIIa, two associated with nerve damage and none with vascular damage, were reviewed. After debridement and lavage, ten internal fixations and five conservative treatments were used. No superficial or deep surgical site infection was noted. Fourteen of the 15 fractures (93%) healed without reoperation. Eleven of the 15 patients (73%) regained normal function. Ballistic fractures have a bad reputation due to their many complications, including infections. In civilian practice, the use of internal fixation is not responsible for excessive morbidity, provided debridement and lavage are performed. Civilian ballistic fractures, when they are caused by low-velocity firearms, differ from military ballistic fractures. Although the principle of surgical debridement and lavage remains the same, bone stabilization is different and is similar to conventional open fractures. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Therefore a new test, or suite of tests, that employ widely-available and economically viable characterisation methods to screen candidate armour materials is highly desirable; in order to design such a test, more information on the armour/projectile interaction is required. This work presents the design process and results of using an adapted specimen configuration to increase the amount of information obtained from a ballistic test. By using a block of ballistic gel attached to the ceramic, the fragmentation generated during the ballistic event was captured and analysed. In parallel, quasi-static tests were carried out using ring-on-ring biaxial disc testing to investigate relationships between quasi-static and ballistic fragment fracture surfaces. Three contemporary ceramic armour materials were used to design the test and to act as a baseline; Sintox FA alumina, Hexoloy SA silicon carbide and 3M boron carbide. Attempts to analyse the post-test ballistic sample non-destructively using X-ray computed tomography (XCT) were unsuccessful due to the difference in the density of the materials and the compaction of fragments. However, the results of qualitative and quantitative fracture surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy showed similarities between the fracture surfaces of ballistic fragments at the edges of the tile and biaxial fragments; this suggests a relationship between quasi-static and ballistic fragments created away from the centre of impact, although additional research will be required to determine the reason for this. Ballistic event-induced porosity was observed and quantified on the fracture surfaces of silicon carbide samples, which decreased as distance from centre of impact increased; upon further analysis this\n\nComparative Ballistic Performance of 20mm AP M95 and 20mm AP M75 Projectiles against Rolled Homogeneous Steel Armor\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1960-05-01\n\nDominic A.

Ballistic phonon transport has received attention for both theoretical and practical aspects because Fourier's law of heat conduction breaks down and the heat dissipation in nanoscale transistors becomes unpredictable in the ballistic regime. While recent experiments demonstrate room-temperature evidence of ballistic phonon transport in various nanomaterials, the thermal conductivity data for silicon in the length scale of 10-100 nm is still not available due to experimental challenges. Here we show ballistic phonon transport prevails in the cross-plane direction of holey silicon from 35 to 200 nm. The thermal conductivity scales linearly with the length (thickness) even though the lateral dimension (neck) is as narrow as 20 nm. We assess the impact of long-wavelength phonons and predict a transition from ballistic to diffusive regime using scaling models. Our results support strong persistence of long-wavelength phonons in nanostructures and are useful for controlling phonon transport for thermoelectrics and potential phononic applications.\n\nQuantifying Ballistic Armor Performance: A Minimally Invasive Approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolmes, Gale; Kim, Jaehyun; Blair, William; McDonough, Walter; Snyder, Chad\n\n2006-03-01\n\nTheoretical and non-dimensional analyses suggest a critical link between the performance of ballistic resistant armor and the fundamental mechanical properties of the polymeric materials that comprise them. Therefore, a test methodology that quantifies these properties without compromising an armored vest that is exposed to the industry standard V-50 ballistic performance test is needed. Currently, there is considerable speculation about the impact that competing degradation mechanisms (e.g., mechanical, humidity, ultraviolet) may have on ballistic resistant armor. We report on the use of a new test methodology that quantifies the mechanical properties of ballistic fibers and how each proposed degradation mechanism may impact a vest's ballistic performance.\n\nExternal Ballistics.

The first set of full-scale experiments was conducted with a 14.5mm air propelled launcher. The object of the experiments was to determine the ballistic limit speed of 6Al-4V-alloy titanium, low fineness ratio projectiles centrally impacting 2024-T3 alloy aluminum flat plates and the failure modes of the projectiles and the targets. The second set of one-third scale experiments was conducted with a 14.5mm powder launcher. The object of these experiments was to determine the ballisticmoreÂ Â» limit speed of 6Al-4V alloy titanium high fineness ratio projectiles centrally impacting 6Al-4V alloy titanium flat plates and the failure modes of the projectiles and the target. We employed radiography to observe a projectile just before and after interaction with a target plate. Early on, we employed a non-damaging ''soft-catch'' technique to capture projectiles after they perforated targets. Once we realized that a projectile was not damaged during interaction with a target, we used a 4-inch thick 6061-T6-alloy aluminum witness block with a 6.0-inch x 6.0-inch cross-section to measure projectile residual penetration. We have recorded and tabulated below projectile impact speed, projectile residual (post-impact) speed, projectile failure mode, target failure mode, and pertinent comments for the experiments. The ballistic techniques employed for the experiments are similar to those employed in an earlier study.Â«Â less\n\nResearch on capability of detecting ballistic missile by near space infrared system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Li; Sheng, Wen; Jiang, Wei; Jiang, Feng\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe infrared detection technology of ballistic missile based on near space platform can effectively make up the shortcomings of high-cost of traditional early warning satellites and the limited earth curvature of ground-based early warning radar. In terms of target detection capability, aiming at the problem that the formula of the action distance based on contrast performance ignores the background emissivity in the calculation process and the formula is only valid for the monochromatic light, an improved formula of the detecting range based on contrast performance is proposed. The near space infrared imaging system parameters are introduced, the expression of the contrastive action distance formula based on the target detection of the near space platform is deduced. The detection range of the near space infrared system for the booster stage ballistic missile skin, the tail nozzle and the tail flame is calculated. The simulation results show that the near-space infrared system has the best effect on the detection of tail-flame radiation.\n\nAirborne ballistic camera tracking systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRedish, W.

At high sliding speeds in the range of 100?m/s, nanocrystals are expected to behave radically differently in what is known as the ballistic nanofriction regime. In this work, we present a direct measurement of ballistic nanofriction for gold nanocrystals on graphene. Nanocrystals are deposited onto an oscillating graphene-coated quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in-situ under UHV and allowed to periodically ring down. After deposition, frictional parameters are measured as a function of oscillatory velocity to investigate the predicted velocity dependence of friction. Lubricity beyond even the predictions of ballistic nanofriction is observed at much lower surface velocities than expected, with drag coefficients approaching 8.65*10-14 kg/s. In comparison to the theoretically-predicted value of 2.0*10-13 kg/s, our results suggest a much lower interaction strength than proposed in contemporary models of nanoscopic sliding contacts even at relatively low speeds.

Movement because of magnetic field interactions and radiofrequency (RF)-induced heating of retained bullets may injure nearby critical structures. Artifacts may also interfere with the diagnostic use of MRI. To investigate these potential hazards of MRI on a sample of bullets and shotgun pellets. Laboratory investigation, ex vivo. Thirty-two different bullets and seven different shotgun pellets, commonly encountered in criminal trauma, were assessed relative to 1.5-, 3-, and 7-T magnetic resonance systems. Magnetic field interactions, including translational attraction and torque, were measured. A representative sample of five bullets were then tested for magnetic field interactions, RF-induced heating, and the generation of artifacts at 3-T. At all static magnetic field strengths, non-steel-containing bullets and pellets exhibited no movement, whereas one steel core bullet and two steel pellets exhibited movement in excess of what might be considered safe for patients in MRI at 1.5-, 3- and 7-Tesla. At 3-T, the maximum temperature increase of five bullets tested was 1.7Â°C versus background heating of 1.5Â°C. Of five bullets tested for artifacts, those without a steel core exhibited small signal voids, whereas a single steel core bullet exhibited a very large signal void. Ballistics made of lead with copper or alloy jackets appear to be safe with respect to MRI-related movement at 1.5-, 3-, and 7-T static magnetic fields, whereas ballistics containing steel may pose a danger if near critical body structures because of strong magnetic field interactions. Temperature increases of selected ballistics during 3-T MRI was not clinically significant, even for the ferromagnetic projectiles. Finally, ballistics containing steel generated larger artifacts when compared with ballistics\n\nCloth Ballistic Vest Alters Response to Blast\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1988-01-01\n\nDetrick, Frederick, MD 21701-501 ELEMENT NO.

B.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nIt is shown that the Ritz ballistic hypothesis, which is based on the vector summation of the speed of light with the velocity of the radiation source, contradicts the fact of existence of the Sagnac effect. Based on a particular example of a three-mirror ring interferometer, it is shown that the application of the Ritz ballistic hypothesis leads to an obvious calculation error, namely, to the appearance of a difference in the propagation times of counterpropagating waves in the absence of rotation. A review is given of experiments and of results of processing of astronomical observations and discussions devoted to testing the Ritz ballistic hypothesis. A number of other physical phenomena that refute the Ritz ballistic hypothesis are considered.\n\nPrinciples of ballistics applicable to the treatment of gunshot wounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nSwan, K G; Swan, R C\n\n1991-04-01\n\nBallistics is the science of the motion of a projectile through the barrel of a firearm (internal ballistics), during its subsequent flight (external ballistics), and during its final complicated motion after it strikes a target (terminal ballistics). Wound ballistics is a special case of terminal ballistics. Although wound ballistics is at best sets of approximations, its principles enter usefully into an evaluation of a gunshot wound and its treatment. A special consideration in these cases is their medicolegal aspects. At a minimum, the medical team receiving the patient should exert care not to destroy the clothing and in particular to cut around and not through bullet holes, to turn over to law enforcement officials any metallic foreign body recovered from the patient, and to describe precisely, or even to photograph, any entrance or exit wounds.\n\nSandia National Laboratories: Research: Laboratory Directed Research &\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\n; Technology Defense Systems & Assessments About Defense Systems & Assessments Program Areas Robotics R&D 100 Awards Laboratory Directed Research & Development Technology Deployment Centers Audit Sandia's Economic Impact Licensing & Technology Transfer Browse Technology Portfolios\n\nCurrent Testing Capabilities at the NASA Ames Ballistic Ranges\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRamsey, Alvin; Tam, Tim; Bogdanoff, David; Gage, Peter\n\n1999-01-01\n\nCapabilities for designing and performing ballistic range tests at the NASA Ames Research Center are presented. Computational tools to assist in designing and developing ballistic range models and to predict the flight characteristics of these models are described. A CFD code modeling two-stage gun performance is available, allowing muzzle velocity, maximum projectile base pressure, and gun erosion to be predicted. Aerodynamic characteristics such as drag and stability can be obtained at speeds ranging from 0.2 km/s to 8 km/s. The composition and density of the test gas can be controlled, which allows for an assessment of Reynolds number and specific heat ratio effects under conditions that closely match those encountered during planetary entry. Pressure transducers have been installed in the gun breech to record the time history of the pressure during launch, and pressure transducers have also been installed in the walls of the range to measure sonic boom effects. To illustrate the testing capabilities of the Ames ballistic ranges, an overview of some of the recent tests is given.\n\nBallistic missile defense effectiveness\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLewis, George N.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe potential effectiveness of ballistic missile defenses today remains a subject of debate.

The problems posed by potential countermeasures to such midcourse defenses are discussed as are the sensor capabilities a defense might have available to attempt to discriminate the actual missile warhead in a countermeasures environment. The role of flight testing in assessing ballistic missile defense effectiveness is discussed.

This has been largely investigated at low temperatures in low band gap III-V materials due to their high electron mobilities. However, their application to RT ballistic devices is limited by their low optical phonon energies, close to KT at 300 K. In addition, the short electron mean-free-path at RT requires nanoscale devices for which surface effects are a limitation in these materials. We explore the unique properties of wide band-gap III-nitride semiconductors to demonstrate RT ballistic devices. A theoretical model is proposed to corroborate experimentally their optical phonon energy of 92 meV, which is â¼4Ã larger than in other III-V semiconductors. This allows RT ballistic devices operating at larger voltages and currents. An additional model is described to determine experimentally a characteristic dimension for ballistic transport of 188 nm. Another remarkable property is their short carrier depletion at device sidewalls, down to 13 nm, which allows top-down nanofabrication of very narrow ballistic devices. These results open a wealth of new systems and basic transport studies possible at RT.\n\nPreservation and storage of prepared ballistic gelatine.\n\nPubMed\n\nMattijssen, E J A T; Alberink, I; Jacobs, B; van den Boogaard, Y\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe use of ballistic gelatine, generally accepted as a human muscle tissue simulant in wound ballistic studies, might be improved by adding a preservative (Methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) which inhibits microbial growth. This study shows that replacing a part of the gelatine powder by the preservative does not significantly alter the penetration depth of projectiles. Storing prepared blocks of ballistic gelatine over time decreased the penetration depth of projectiles. Storage of prepared gelatine for 4 week already showed a significant effect on the penetration depth of projectiles. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This deformation may cause severe injuries without completely perforating the helmet, termed \"behind armor blunt trauma\" (BABT). As helmets become lighter, the likelihood of larger helmet backface deformation under ballistic impact increases. To characterize the potential for BABT, seven postmortem human head/neck specimens wearing a ballistic protective helmet were exposed to nonperforating impact, using a 9 mm, full metal jacket, 124 grain bullet with velocities of 400-460 m/s. An increasing trend of injury severity was observed, ranging from simple linear fractures to combinations of linear and depressed fractures. Overall, the ability to identify skull fractures resulting from BABT can be used in forensic investigations. Our results demonstrate a high risk of skull fracture due to BABT and necessitate the prevention of BABT as a design factor in future generations of protective gear.

Review of the literature, with technical information obtained from appropriate non-medical texts. Despite numerous publications concerning the treatment of gunshot wounds, relatively few papers contain details on the mechanisms of ballistic trauma, with the main body of evidence derived from previous laboratory and animal studies which have only recently been systematically appraised. These studies have shown that in rifle injuries the main wound tract is surrounded by an area of damaged tissue as a result of the temporary cavitation induced once the bullet becomes destabilized or deformed. On the other hand, the more commonly encountered non-deforming handgun bullets cause damage limited to the bullet's path, mainly as a result of localized crush injury. The bullet's construction and ballistic behavior within tissue determine to what extent the previously overestimated velocity factor may influence wound severity. The damage produced from temporary cavitation depends on the tensile properties of the tissues involved, and in high-energy injuries may lead to progressive muscle tissue necrosis. Therefore, the term \"high-energy\" should be reserved for those injuries with substantial tissue damage extending beyond the visible wound tract.\n\nStudent research laboratory for optical engineering\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTolstoba, Nadezhda D.; Saitgalina, Azaliya; Abdula, Polina; Butova, Daria\n\n2015-10-01\n\nStudent research laboratory for optical engineering is comfortable place for student's scientific and educational activity.

The state-of-the-art Propulsion Research Laboratory (PRL) serves as a leading national resource for advanced space propulsion research. Its purpose is to conduct research that will lead to the creation and development of innovative propulsion technologies for space exploration. The facility is the epicenter of the effort to move the U.S. space program beyond the confines of conventional chemical propulsion into an era of greatly improved access to space and rapid transit throughout the solar system. The laboratory is designed to accommodate researchers from across the United States, including scientists and engineers from NASA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, universities, and industry. The facility, with 66,000 square feet of useable laboratory space, features a high degree of experimental capability. Its flexibility allows it to address a broad range of propulsion technologies and concepts, such as plasma, electromagnetic, thermodynamic, and propellant propulsion. An important area of emphasis is the development and utilization of advanced energy sources, including highly energetic chemical reactions, solar energy, and processes based on fission, fusion, and antimatter. The Propulsion Research Laboratory is vital for developing the advanced propulsion technologies needed to open up the space frontier, and sets the stage of research that could revolutionize space transportation for a broad range of applications.\n\nDesign Guide for Aerodynamics Testing of Earth and Planetary Entry Vehicles in a Ballistic Range\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBogdanoff, David W.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this manual is to aid in the design of an aerodynamics test of an earth or planetary entry capsule in a ballistic range.

Current neck collars incorporate the same ballistic protective fabrics as the soft armour of the remaining vest, reflecting how ballistic protective performance alone has historically been perceived as the most important property for neck protection. However, the neck has fundamental differences from the thorax in terms of anatomical vulnerability, flexibility and equipment integration, necessitating a separate solution from the thorax in terms of optimal materials selection. An integrated approach towards the selection of the most appropriate combination of materials to be used for each of the two potential designs of future neck protection has been developed. This approach requires evaluation of the properties of each potential material in addition to ballistic performance alone, including flexibility, mass, wear resistance and thermal burden. The aim of this article is to provide readers with an overview of this integrated approach towards ballistic materials selection and an update of its current progress in the development of future ballistic neck protection.\n\nBallistic damage in hybrid composite laminates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPhadnis, Vaibhav A.; Pandya, Kedar S.; Naik, Niranjan K.; Roy, Anish; Silberschmidt, Vadim V.\n\n2015-07-01\n\nBallistic damage of hybrid woven-fabric composites made of plain-weave E-glass- fabric/epoxy and 8H satin-weave T300 carbon-fabric/epoxy is studied using a combination of experimental tests, microstructural studies and finite-element (FE) analysis. Ballistic tests were conducted with a single-stage gas gun. Fibre damage and delamination were observed to be dominating failure modes. A ply-level FE model was developed, with a fabric-reinforced ply modelled as a homogeneous orthotropic material with capacity to sustain progressive stiffness degradation due to fibre/matrix cracking, fibre breaking and plastic deformation under shear loading. Simulated damage patterns on the front and back faces of fabric-reinforced composite plates provided an insight into their damage mechanisms under ballistic loading.\n\nValley-symmetric quasi-1D transport in ballistic graphene\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Hu-Jong\n\nWe present our recent studies on gate-defined valley-symmetric one-dimensional (1D) carrier guiding in ballistic monolayer graphene and valley-symmetry-protected topological 1D transport in ballistic bilayer graphene. Successful carrier guiding was realized in ballistic monolayer graphene even in the absence of a band gap by inducing a high distinction ( more than two orders of magnitude) in the carrier density between the region of a quasi-1D channel and the rest of the top-gated regions. Conductance of a channel shows quantized values in units of 4e2/ h, suggesting that the valley symmetry is preserved. For the latter, the topological 1D conduction was realized between two closely arranged insulating regions with inverted band gaps, induced under a pair of split dual gating with polarities opposite to each other. The maximum conductance along the boundary channel showed 4e2/ h, again with the preserved valley symmetry. The 1D topological carrier guiding demonstrated in this study affords a promising route to robust valleytronic applications and sophisticated valley-associated functionalities based on 2D materials.

These improvements caused Western strategists to be concerned with use of ballistic missiles equipped with conventional loads against military objectives (the Pact of Varsovie). The concept of ballistic missile tactical had been born. The ballistic vector, which until this time was marked with a 'strategic' label, was then 'standardized' and has interested a number of countries in the process of its development. The world has just entered the era of the ballistic proliferation. From the very start of the Eighties, the United States and, to a lesser degree, NATO lead studies and reflections concerned with defense against tactical ballistic missiles within a East West framework. From these studies the ATBM (Anti Tactical Ballistic Missile) made its appearance. In spite of the attempts at control, missile proliferation has accelerated and led, towards the end of the Eighties and the beginning of the Nineties, to the awakening of a new risk known as proliferating. The 1991 Gulf War was accelerated in this manner. This conflict also clarified the fact that the ballistic weapon constituted a formidable means of pressure for countries which had it, in spite of the PATRIOT, which demonstrated the feasibility of an active defense against ballistic missiles, in spite of their limited performances. This present presentation proposes an overall analysis of the ballistic risk and the possible threat which could result from it and examines the means available for protection against this risk by looking further into all the defensive means. This will constitute the main part of the speech. Lastly, we will endeavor to evaluate the difficulties faced by the architects of the DAMB.\n\nInitial Validation of Ballistic Shock Transducers\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-06-05\n\nobjective of this TOP is to describe various methods and instrumentation used in the initial validation of accelerometers to be used in both Ballistic...MILITARY STANDARD 810G CHANGE NOTICE 1, METHOD 522.2, SECTION 4.4.2 .......................................

The straight scattering-less trajectory of electrons was modified by a perpendicular magnetic field which produced a strong non-linear behavior in the measured output voltage of the ballistic filters and allowed the observation of semi-classical and quantum effects, such as quenching of the Hall resistance and manifestation of the last plateau, in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. A large measured phase coherence length of 190ânm allowed the observation of universal quantum fluctuationsmoreÂ Â» and weak localization of electrons due to quantum interference up to â¼25âK. This work also reveals the prospect of wide band-gap GaN semiconductors as a platform for basic transport and quantum studies, whose properties allow the investigation of ballistic transport and quantum phenomena at much larger voltages and temperatures than in other semiconductors.Â«Â less\n\nQuantum Mechanical Modeling of Ballistic MOSFETs\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSvizhenko, Alexei; Anantram, M.

However, the effect of a delay between production and testing of a gelatin mould remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine any potential effects of ageing on ballistic gelatin. Depth of penetration (DoP) of 4.5âmm spherical fragment simulating projectiles was ascertained using mixtures of 10%, 11.25% and 20% Type A 250 Bloom ballistic gelatin. Testing was performed daily for 5âdays using velocities between 75 and 210âm/s. DoP at day 5 was statistically compared with day 1, and net mass change was recorded daily. No significant difference was found for DoP observed with time in any of the samples (P>0.05). Spearman correlation was excellent in all moulds. The moulds with known standard calibrations remained in calibration throughout the study period. Mass loss of less than 1% was noted in all samples. Mass loss was the only quantifiable measure of changes in the blocks with time, but did not correlate with any changes in DoP. This may provide reassurance when undertaking such testing that an inadvertent delay will not significantly alter the penetration properties of the mould. Future research is recommended to determine any potential effect on the mechanical properties of gelatin at higher velocity impacts and whether the calibration corresponds to an adequate simulation under such conditions.
