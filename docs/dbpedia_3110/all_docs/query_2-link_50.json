        "text": "The following are updates to previously-reported items and other recent regulatory filings and actions concerning Upper Midwest broadcast stations. This report is created by the author and is not an official report of the FCC.\n\nIowa\n\nFamily Stations’ KYFR/920 (Shenandoah) reported that it has been operating at an unspecified reduced power since April 29 due to a damaged circuit board in its transmitter. It’s believed severe thunderstorms caused the damage. KYFR normally transmits with 5kW day and 2.5kW night.\n\nThe FCC has granted a modification of Vanguard Association of Sunbelt Colleges’ construction permit for a new station on 88.9 in Dubuque, switching from the original 3.1kW/185m (class C3) to 1.12kW/166m (class A).\n\nMichigan\n\nThe FCC granted Aurora Media’s W280GB/103.9 (Escanaba) a construction permit to move its transmitter to the tower of co-owned WYKX/104.7 northwest of the city, relaying WYKX-HD2. It would continue to transmit with 250 Watts from the new site.\n\nMinnesota\n\nThe FCC granted Bauer Broadcasting a construction permit for a new low-power FM station on 98.1 in Vermillion, using 100 Watts. It was also granted the callsign KVRM-LP. The application stated that plans include a wide-ranging music format with local news and information for the community, which is on the edge of the Twin Cities metro area. The station’s coverage area will also include Hampton.\n\nEdge Spectrum’s K22NL-D (Wadena), formerly K47JC-D, reports that it has completed construction of its new facility. The low-power TV station had gone off the air ahead of its previous channel being discontinued as part of the national spectrum repack.\n\nNebraska\n\nFlood Communications West closed on its purchase of K26CV-D (Ogallala) from Digital Networks-Midwest on May 10.\n\nCSN International has signed on K211GG/90.1 (Kearney), which is the former license of K209CF/89.7. K209CF was displaced when its former owner, Bible Broadcasting Network, signed on KYHK/89.5 (Kearney); BBN then sold the translator to CSN. It now carries CSN’s KAWZ (Twin Falls, ID) via satellite.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDickinson Belfield Broadcasting’s KXDI/93.9 (Belfield) reports that it is operating at reduced power of 5kW, rather than its usual 100kW, after an antenna system malfunction. The station says it initially left the air on April 25 and returned May 4 using a temporary antenna. It is seeking special temporary authority to continue transmitting at the reduced power level while repairs are completed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid Broadcasting’s KKRA-LD/25 (Rapid City) reports that it returned to the air on April 25.\n\nThe FCC granted Homeslice Media Group’s KKLS/920 (Rapid City) a construction permit to switch to a non-directional signal with 5kW day and 65 Watts night. The station had previously used 5kW day and 111 Watts night, with the same directional pattern day and night, but has been at reduced power since 2016 after the construction of a new power line affected the pattern.\n\nThe FCC approved a plan for K253AB/98.5 (Aberdeen) to move from its present site east of town to the KSDN/KGIM site just south of town, improving its signal to the community. It will continue to relay KGIM/1420 with 250 Watts.\n\nWisconsin\n\nTomsun Media’s W225CP/92.9 (Hartford), which currently transmits from the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, has applied to move into Milwaukee proper. It would transmit with 99 Watts from the WMVS(TV) tower. The application states that the translator would switch its input to the HD3 signal of Entercom’s WXSS/103.7 (Wauwatosa-Milwaukee).\n\nThe FCC has granted a modification for TV-49/Weigel’s construction permit for a new station on channel 31 in Shawano, now specifying 1,000kW at 332 meters from a tower near Green Bay. The channel had formerly been allotted to Wittenberg. The permittee has requested the callsign WMEI.\n\nThe University of Northwestern-St. Paul submitted an amendment specifying that W203CC/88.5 (Ashland), formerly W220EB/91.9, is carrying “Faith Radio” via an internet feed of KLBF (Lincoln, ND) rather than KDNI (Duluth) as had originally been reported. KLBF serves as the primary station for several “Faith Radio” translators across the region.\n\nDisclosure: Jon Ellis is an employee of Gray Media Group.
