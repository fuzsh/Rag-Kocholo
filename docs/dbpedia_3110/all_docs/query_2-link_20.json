        "text": "CSN is a non-profit organization and operates non-profit stations. KAWZ, 89.9 MHz, in Twin Falls is the uplink station, feeding 337 broadcast translators nationwide and 42 full-power radio stations across the United States, including Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands. At this point, WSFW adopted its current Christian talk and teaching format, supplied by CSN International. Christian Satellite Network (CSN) International is a Christian radio network based in Twin Falls, Idaho. The assignment of license was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on January 12, 2010. WSFW was sold to Calvary Chapel Twin Falls on November 12, 2009. In 2007, WSFW dropped its \"Finger Lakes News-Talk Network\" simulcast with WGVA Geneva, WCGR Canadaigua and WAUB Auburn, New York, then flipped to a travelers information format. The two stations simulcast a full service middle of the road format of popular music, news and sports.\n\nOne month later, it added an FM counterpart, 99.3 WSFW-FM (now WFLK). It was owned by the Waterfalls Broadcasting Company. On October 1, 1968, WSFW signed on the air. But in other countries like the United States, persecution begins subtly. Programming is heard around the clock over a 200- watt FM translator, W296DI on 107.1 MHz. Are Christians being persecuted for their faith today In some parts of the world, yes. Some of the national religious leaders heard on WSFW include Adrian Rogers, David Jeremiah and James Dobson.Ä«ecause AM 1110 is a clear channel frequency reserved for Class A stations WBT Charlotte and KFAB Omaha, WSFW is a daytimer and must go off the air at sunset to avoid interference. Licensed to Seneca Falls, New York, United States, the station is currently an owned-and-operated station of CSN International. WSFW (1110 kHz) is an AM radio station broadcasting a Christian talk and teaching radio format."
