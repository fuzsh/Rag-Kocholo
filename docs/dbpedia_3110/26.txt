KAWZ Translators existed before LPFM stations, but LPFM advocates have characterized this proliferation as "The Great Translator Invasion". Furthermore, because Calvary Chapel is a non-profit organization and operates non-profit stations, it is not required to have its translators receive KAWZ's signal over the air, as would be required for a commercial station.

The first satellite-fed translator to begin receiving the network from KAWZ was in Yucca Valley, California. Of note, one of KAWZ's translators, K200AA (Sun Valley, Nevada), is the only broadcast translator in the United States that is allowed to broadcast on 87.9 MHz.

Translators

CSN International is relayed by an additional 365 translators nationwide.

Board Members

The only board member of CSN the (Christian Satellite Network) is Pastor Mike Kestler. Pastor Kestler is president and co-founder of CSN.
