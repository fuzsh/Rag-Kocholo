CSN (the Christian Satellite Network) began broadcasting Christian radio over satellite on April 26th, 1995 from KAWZ in Twin Falls, Idaho. KAWZ is the uplink ... See more station, owned by The River Christian Fellowship (formerly Calvary Chapel Twin Falls), with Pastor Mike Kestler as its founder. The first satellite-fed translator to begin receiving the network from KAWZ was in Yucca Valley, California. Since that time, CSN has grown to nearly 400 stations and translators across the United States, including Alaska and the Hawaiian islands. The Lord continues to expand CSN through many more applications for stations. We believe you will find CSN to be a great source for Bible teaching along with praise and worship music from around the world, the fruit of which is the many reports of decisions for Christ and people rededicating their lives to serve our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in these last days. Tell your friends about CSN International, the Christian Satellite Network!

Enjoying this station and the variety of music and rich preaching. Earlier this week I heard an add for an Easter exhibit, but I wasn't able to get the telephone number so that I could find out how to be a part of the experience. How would I find this information? Thanks!

Love this station! Listen every morning while driving my kids to school I absolutely, love pastor Shepard and Pastor Randy Cahill, they always seem to speak on what I am going through at the time. Thank you for having such great speakers on here!
