        "text": "John T. Floore’s Country Store is one of the best places to spend a summer night outside seeing a live concert. Located in Helotes, Texas, just outside of San Antonio, it was the closest dancehall to my hometown (just a quick hour and a half drive down the block), so I spent many weekends seeing my favorite bands at Floore’s. In addition to the big outdoor stage, Floore’s also has a smaller indoor stage and dance floor that we’ll call, um, cozy. Let’s just say that if you don’t want to faint from heat exhaustion and land on a beer-soaked dance floor, stay away from indoor shows at Floore’s during the spring and summer. It has happened to two of my friends on two separate occasions; true story. Nevertheless, no matter what season of the year it is, I love Floore’s.\n\nKnown as Willie Nelson’s musical birthplace, John T. Floore’s Country Store dates back to 1942 and it was never actually a store. In addition to the indoor and outdoor stages, Floore’s has a “Texas Café” inside. Floore’s is also one of the strictest venues that I have ever been to when it comes to being under the age of 21. Almost every time I’ve been to Floore’s, I’ve seen minors kicked out for sneaking drinks or washing off the permanent marker “X” on each hand, and minors are not allowed to go in and out of the venue. I’ve been asked to roll up my sleeves because my long-sleeved shirt and jacket covered my “UNDER 21” wristband and Xs on my hands. This has never bothered me, but here’s a heads up if you’re not 21 and planning to visit Floore’s to drink – you will not succeed."
