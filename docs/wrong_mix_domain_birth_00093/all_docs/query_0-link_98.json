Through a chronicle of labor strikes on campus, The Subtext of a Yale Education (1999) examines the corporatization of higher education. She then returned to her birthplace to make Green (2000), a sobering look at environmental racism along the Mississippi River petrochemical corridor, a.k.a. “Cancer Alley”. Other work includes experimental films Baby (1999), a personal take on population issues, and Become the Sky (2002), an ecological map of power in Texas. Her work has screened internationally in film festivals, art galleries, theaters, universities, churches and union halls. Honors include a Rockefeller Media Arts Fellowship, Student Academy Award, Yale’s Trumbull College Fine Arts Prize, and most recently, an Independent Spirit Award. She lives in Austin, Texas with her husband and their spirited toddler. The Unforeseen (2008), which is currently being released in theaters nationwide, is her first feature film.\n\nMore about The Unforeseen.\n\nMore about Laura and her work.\n\nAll content on this page courtesy of Laura Dunn, and may not be copied, reproduced or otherwise redistributed without express permission.
