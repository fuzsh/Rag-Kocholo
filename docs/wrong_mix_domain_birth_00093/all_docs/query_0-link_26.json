        "text": "I have some very mixed feelings writing this review. It’s been over eight years since I set out on my mission of reviewing every Johnny Cash release from the Columbia era. There are still a few more collaborations to go, but Rainbow constitutes Johnny’s final solo album in the Columbia era. While this review is a significant milestone for me, sadly my final review of a Columbia Cash album is for my least favourite of them all. Coming into this review, I was assuming this would be an obvious 1/5 review. Let’s see where we end up…\n\nBy 1984, at least one thing was going right for Cash – he checked himself into the Betty Ford Clinic in late 1983 and got clean. He has claimed his renewed challenges began with a near-fatal attack by an ostrich on his farm that had him hospitalized and on morphine. However, while that may be partially true, we know he had actually been struggling with pills again since 1977, and that, in turn, led to some serious marital problems. 1984, then, was a year of renewal on many fronts.\n\nSadly, that would not extend to his professional life. In April, he reunited with Billy Sherrill who produced his last hit, 1981’s The Baron, for another stab at the charts, countrypolitan style. The advance single, The Chicken in Black, was received so poorly that the whole album was scrapped. Coming on the heels of a shelved gospel album and his Columbia contract coming up for renewal, Cash really needed a hit.\n\nEnter Chips Moman. This was the guy who architected Elvis’ top late career material, notably Suspicious Minds and In the Ghetto. More so, Chips almost always worked with The Memphis Boys, a team of crack session musicians who, much like Johnny’s Tennessee Three, had been with him for a long time: Reggie Young on guitar, Bobby Emmons and Bobby Wood on piano/organ/keyboards, and Gene Chrisman on drums. Factor in Chips’ wife Toni Wine on Davis, and you would think this Memphis-rooted family affair would make Cash feel right at home.\n\nWith a top producer and crack band in tow, Rainbow also brought some exciting songs to the table. Look at how Cash described them in the liner notes:\n\n“Every once in awhile a song comes along for me that gives me a boost. This has been the key to my continuing to enjoy performing after 30 years… a really great song, gives me such a lift… Such a song is Kristofferson’s “Here Comes That Rainbow Again.” The lyrics are so good… “Unwed Fathers’, written by John Prine and Bobby Braddock, may be depressing to some of you, but it’s something that needs to be said for women… “They’re All The Same”, was written by Willie Nelson 20 years ago… For me, 1965 was a down year and it was of the many things I lost. I only recently rediscovered it. I wrote “I’m Leaving You” in Australia… I wrote “You Beat All I Ever Saw” twenty years ago when Waylon and I were sharing an apartment… When I recorded this, my brother Waylon was hanging out with me most of the time and he was a great encouragement and inspiration… Jessi Colter was there too… one of the world’s great women. “Casey’s Last Ride” is one of those songs Kristofferson gave me 15 years ago and I threw it in the lake. June and Anita Carter kept telling me that I should record it… [the other four] were contribute by Chips Moman. I love all four them, especially “Easy Street”. You know I can relate to that song.”\n\nJohnny Cash – Rainbow Liner Notes\n\nI include this long excerpt because it drips of Cash’s enthusiasm. You can hear how he’s in a time of revival, revisiting things he had missed and creating something new he was truly excited about.\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\nWell, opener I’m Leaving Now sounds like old school Cash. A bit derivative of Hank Snow’s I’m Moving On (but this time dedicated to the music industry instead of a woman), it’s a fun, upbeat number. Beyond that, there is some excellent songwriting here, too. Prine’s Unwed Fathers takes an honest look at teenage pregnancy. There’s a classic Creedence Clearwater Revival song in Have You Ever Seen the Rain? And Cash is right that Here Comes That Rainbow Again is indeed a top-notch Kristofferson tune, finding the beauty in simple human generosity.\n\nBut listen to how that song opens, with those cheesy 80s keyboard sounds. With its slow loping waltz, I’m not even sure that this is country music. Country-inflected soft rock? And once we’re through the opening track, it’s cheesy keyboard effect after cheesy keyboard effect. Moman makes sure that every nook and cranny is filled with a responding brass sound, synth sitar, or some chiming bell.\n\nLook a little deeper, and you’ll see exactly what’s happening. First, apart from Marty Stuart, whose mandolin is his best on a Cash record yet, his band is entirely absent here. Compare this to Believe in Me, which Marty produced a year or so earlier. On that album you could hear how well the Johnny Cash Show Band interacted. This was a paired down version of The Great Eighties Eight featuring Earl Poole Ball on piano, Bob Wooten on electric guitar, Marty on mandolin (and a bit of guitar), Fluke Holland on drums, and Jimmy Tittle on bass. And while, Cash’s sound had changed since his early days with the Tennessee Two, there was a continuity through his sonic evolution leading to this band. They were still driven by Fluke’s snare and Wooten’s boom-chicka-boom leads, and then Marty and Earl’s virtuosity enhanced that foundation with the ability to pivot around changing country trends.\n\nIn Moman’s hands, however, the foundation is gone. Fluke’s snare is replaced with classy cymbal flourishes. There’s no boom-chicka-boom. Everything is pampered in soft fades and gentle echoes. And then there’s this note in the credits:\n\nA thank you to a synthesizer? Yikes!\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I’m all in favour of the evolution of Johnny’s sound. I’ll also be more forgiving when it comes to Moman’s work with The Highwaymen. But this is a Johnny Cash album and we should have learned by now that total overhauls like the John R. Cash album don’t work. His future needs to be tied into his past for it to work.\n\nAdmittedly, this album tries so hard to tie into Johnny’s past, but in such strange ways. Johnny had actually never collaborated directly with Willie Nelson, yet they find a song Willie wrote for Cash twenty years ago… and then play it exactly like a Willie tune (complete with a nylon-string guitar solo played so exactly in Willie’s inimitable style that I refuse to believe this isn’t an uncredited Nelson!). Then, they have Waylon sing background vocals but wash it into a dense mix that robs any character from his offering. And what about that old tune of Cash’s, You Beat All I Ever Saw? Johnny may like this song, but it tanked in the charts in the 60s (thanks in part to a stale trumpet arrangement), and will bore you to death in this molasses-slow update.\n\nIf that’s not bad enough, Chips’ own contributions are worse. He brought a CCR tune to Johnny and give it a stiff interpretation that definitely disappoints. And his self-penned (with Bobby Emmons) Easy Street and Borderline are really bland. In fact, I have no idea what Borderline is even about (a musical whodunnit? What?) The only half-decent number in this group is Love Me Like You Used To. But that’s another case of Johnny putting out an ok version of a great song that would be bested by someone else. Kenny Rogers did it with the Gambler, and this time it will be Tanya Tucker who would score a #2 hit with this tune.\n\nI will admit, however, that in revisiting this album, I was singing along in my first listen, and I thought I had only heard this album a handful of times. Indeed, when I started listening to Cash in the early 2000s, my local library still had this one on cassette (yes, they still had cassettes, and I still had a player in my car!). All I could remember from that cursory listen was “80s keyboard ballads and a bad CCR cover”. I eventually bought a used copy of the LP to fill out my collection, and then got the CD with the Complete Columbia box set, but am not sure I even listened to it.\n\nTo the album’s credit, it is actually an easy listen. All those soft Casio keyboards and gently layered backing vocals let the album kind of drift along. So is it truly horrible? Maybe not. Rainbow and Unwed Fathers are great songs, and I’d probably keep I’m Leaving Now because of its classic Cash vibe. None of the other songs are offensive, and there are little musical flourishes here and there of interest. So maybe it’s not a 1/5, but it’s not the monumental album that Cash raved about in the notes, and it definitely wasn’t enough to save his career.\n\n2/5\n\nOther Songs from the Era:\n\nThey Killed Him/The Three Bells – a single-only release produced by Chips unlike anything else in Cash’s catalogue. The a-side is powerful Kristofferson number about the legacy of Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Jesus Christ. Heavy stuff, but like Rainbow, delivered over a keyboard-heavy pop backing. The b-side is an update of Edith Piaf’s Les Trois Cloches (translated into English in the 1950s). This one is piano-driven, and a captivating string of vignettes that capture a life in three minutes. An interesting single, but I’m not sure who thought these two would light up the charts. Available on Singles Plus.\n\nChristmas on the Road – Johnny’s 1984 Christmas special, recorded in the middle of these sessions in Montreux, Switzerland. This is really the birthplace of The Highwaymen as it features Johnny, Waylon, Kris and Willie singing On the Road Again. Jessi Colter also guests as does John Carter Cash. Note – Johnny was still singing The Chicken in Black at this time, so hadn’t totally disowned it!\n\nI Will Dance with You – Recorded in early 1985, Karen Brooks released a duet version of this late 70s Cash gem on her 1986 album of the same name. Marty Stuart would also release a solo album in 1986 including a cover of one of Brooks’ tunes. By the end of 1986, Marty would leave Cash’s band to pursue his solo career.\n\nBe Careful Who You Love – Johnny guested on this Waylon tune on his Sweet Mother Texas album. This sets the stage for their upcoming duet album, Heroes.\n\nFrom the beginning of his career, Cash had wanted to sing gospel music. So much so, that it was the deciding factor in his shift from Sun Records to Columbia given Sam Phillip’s refusal to let Cash record a gospel album. Nearly 25 years later, he was in essentially the same position with Columbia. They turned down a gospel album in 1975. They let Cash take 1979’s A Believer Sings the Truth to another label. Then, when he recorded Johnny Cash – Gospel Singer in 1982, Columbia decided to put it out on their small gospel imprint Priority Records. But before releasing the album, Columbia shut down Priority and the album went into limbo.\n\nFinally, in 1986, Christian label Word Records picked up the album, cut four songs, resequenced it, and released “Believe In Him”, the album we’re considering today.\n\nThere are many diverse views within Christianity, but one major delineation is Calvinism vs Arminianism, stemming from a theological debate not too long after the Protestant Reformation. It’s essentially an extension of the debate over free will. Calvin argued that we’re all predestined to our salvation, so if you’re in, you’re in, and if you’re out, you’re out. Arminius disagreed. He thought we all have our own choice, and while we might be in with God one day, we can be out another if we choose to go down the wrong path.\n\nIf you’ve ever listened to Southern Gospel music, you’ll know it’s a pretty clear descendent of the Arminianism line of thought, which also led to the American revivalist movements, and ultimately things like Pentecostalism and altar calls. In that view, you might be saved, but you can slip away from God and need to rededicate your life, again, and again, and again. In other words, you’re either turning towards God or turning away from God.\n\nThat’s very much the world that Johnny Cash had been living in since his personal revival in the late 60s. Thus, his involvement with things like Billy Graham’s evangelistic crusades were part of this direction in his life. Of course, he still had many problems, and in 1982 was at his worst with addiction and struggling in his marriage with June Carter Cash. In such troubled times, gospel music seems to have been a real anchor for him.\n\nBy and large, the ten tracks here (five written by Cash) espouse the view that if you just keep trying to stay on the right track, by God’s grace, you can get to heaven. Another Wide River to Cross, Over There, Half a Mile A Day, and One of these Day’s I’m Gonna Sit Down and Talk to Paul, all emphasize the hope of heaven that most Christian believes awaits them after death. Yet these are balanced out by humble views of life on earth, such as the opportunities God gives us times of trouble (God Ain’t No Stained Glass Window), the motivational power of Jesus’ death (standard hymn The Old Rugged Cross), and God’s ongoing support for us no matter what the circumstance in title track, Believe in Him:\n\n“Believe in Him/Free yourself from worry/Go through this life and do your best/He has promised He will take care of the rest”\n\nYou can understand how these words resonated with a man struggling with real life challenges and hoping for better things.\n\nMusically, this album is really interesting. Relative newcomer to the band (and soon-to-be son-in-law thanks to his relationship with Cindy Cash) Marty Stuart took the production reigns and really invested in this album. It was recorded by a smaller core band than the original Great Eighties Eight. Jack Routh is gone on acoustic guitar. Jerry Hensley is gone on electric. So that leaves the classic duo of WS Holland on drums and Bob Wooten on electric. Earl Poole Ball provides his usual wonderous piano. Then, early on in the session, another soon-to-be son-in-law (thanks to Cathy Cash) Jimmy Tittle joined on bass, firming up the role over session musicians for the first time since Marshall Grant was fired in 1980. Last, Marty Stuart plays the hot guitar leads and mandolin. This marks a new core band of five guys backing Cash.\n\nWhile sessions started in the summer of 1982, Marty worked on the project for months, even doing final overdubs with himself and Wooten over Christmas that year. He would bring in session musicians to help fill out the mixes, notably the Cathedral Quartet to provide true Southern Gospel harmonies, as well as players for the occasional pedal steel or dobro part. But the emphasis was on getting solid bed tracks with a band Cash felt comfortable with. Interestingly, this is exactly the approach that Rick Rubin would use to get Cash’s career back on track a decade later.\n\nMarty Stuart was really the right guy at the right time, too. A child prodigy in the bluegrass world, he could bring a traditional country vibe to the songs. But as a young guitar player in Nashville, he could complement that with a modern edge. The result is the most straight-forward Cash album in some time.\n\nOf course, it sits within the Southern Gospel genre, so if that’s not to your liking, this album won’t be for you. I, for one, have trouble with some of the simple platitudes of the genre – lines like, “God ain’t no stained glass window because he never keeps a window closed” (written by up and coming songwriter Mark Germino) and “the road to heaven never had a rapid transit plan” (written by Cash himself) simply don’t speak to me.\n\nBut there are some very interesting arrangements here. The pump organ on The Old Rugged Cross, paired with Jessi Colter’s gorgeous voice basically sets the stage for Rubin’s minimalist arrangements that will come at the end of Cash’s career. Then there’s the sparkly, modern country arrangement of Believe in Him, in which Wooten and Stuart’s guitars weave in and out together wonderfully. How about, a vocal bass solo on Another Wide River to Cross? Or soulful organ on Stained Glass Window? There’s some truly great stuff here.\n\nThe highlight for me, though, is Bill Monroe’s You’re Driftin’ Away, which is perhaps the most delicate Cash arrangement since I Still Miss Someone. His vocal is so soft here (perhaps a symptom of his addiction again) and expresses such vulnerability. Knowing what Cash was going through at the time, can you not hear him singing this to himself? He must have been wondering if he’d ever be able to get back to the good life. From that vantage, a song like My Children Walk in Truth, is particularly powerful: while his own life might be a struggle, he could find joy in seeing his children grow on a better path.\n\nNot everything on the album is great. Beyond some of the hokey lyrics, I could also have done without an unnecessary update to his Sun Records gospel number, Belshazzar. It simply adds nothing to the original. It was actually slated to be the opening track on the Gospel Singer version of the album, which was thankfully reconsidered in 1986. And while Johnny was inspired to talk to all his heroes in heaven on One of These Days…, it’s not a song that speaks deep into one’s soul like the greatest gospel numbers.\n\nDespite that, this record should have been a shift in the right direction for Cash. Working with Stuart and a tighter band was a good thing. Collaborating with family always made Cash comfortable too (although, notice there are no Carters involved here!). But sessions dragged on, as they did when Cash was having addiction troubles, the album lost label interest, and ultimately got lost in the shuffle. And so Cash would go back into the big-label-hot-producer machine again.\n\n3.5/5\n\nOther Songs from the Era:\n\nMatthew 24(Is Knocking At the Door)/Farther Along/LIfe’s Railway to Heaven – three wonderful acoustic demos released on Personal File.\n\nGospel Road/What is Man/Wildwood in the Pines/Never Grow Old – four outtakes slated for the original envisioning of the album as Johnny Cash – Gospel Singer. Released on Bootleg Vol IV with the original slated running order for the whole album. Gospel Road is a nice acoustic update of the title track to his life of Jesus film soundtrack. Never Grow Old would be revisited with Rick Rubin. What is Man would be revisited on the 1992 live album The Great Lost performance (featuring NY jazz singer Lucy Clark). But the highlight is Wildwood in the Pines. Already heard on the Strawberry Cake live album, this bluegrass gospel number should have been the centrepiece of the album. Instead, it was dropped. Classic Cash…\n\nA Merry Memphis Christmas – Johnny’s annual Christmas special pays tribute to the city the launched his career. This year’s guests included Crystal Gayle (Johnny sang a song of hers earlier that year on The Adventures of Johnny Cash LP), Rosanne Cash, The Mighty Clouds of Joy, and Eddie Rabbit. What’s especially notable is that Another Wide River to Cross was used in the opening and closing credits, yet wouldn’t see the light of day until Believe in Him was finally released four years later. Check out a young Vince Gill backing Rosanne on guitar.\n\nThe Adventures of Johnny Cash is Johnny’s third studio album of the 80s, as well as third with new band The Great Eighties Eight. If you’re going to appreciate this one at all, you should be ready to enjoy a very laid-back, mellow album with thick layered instruments. The sound is a little more natural than previous producer Billy Sherrill’s approach, but is still pretty slick. If you can accept that, this is overall an enjoyable if unremarkable album.\n\nThe songs are the result of work with producer Cowboy Jack Clement in February 1982, but stem back to December when they first recorded some of these songs for the made-for-television film The Pride of Jesse Hallam. That film tells the story of a man who moves from Kentucky to Chicago to get medical care for his daughter and faces his illiteracy along the way. Although this album has no direct connection with the film, the themes of moving on from simple ways looms large over the album.\n\nThe album opens with a great upbeat number, Billy Joe Shaver’s Georgia on a Fast Train. It’s got that classic Marty Stuart chicken pickin’ electric sound that energizes what will otherwise be a fairly subdued affair. The chorus lyric, “I’ve got a good Christian raisin’, and an eighth-grade education” reminds of the adult literacy themes of Jesse Hallam.\n\nI’ve got a good Christian raisin’, and an eighth-grade education\n\nBilly Joe Shaver\n\nElsewhere, the closest connection to the film is the inclusion of John Prine’s signature song Paradise, which was included in an acoustic arrangement in the film. It launches here, too, with Marty Stuart’s mandolin and despite not also including the dobro of the film version, is an excellent rendition of a perfect song. We’re also treated to another Prine song, the sensitive ballad Only Love. Johnny’s vocal is unusually delicate and suits the song really well.\n\nFollowing opener Georgia on a Fast Train, Cash draws on new bass player Joe Allen – Marshall Grant’s first replacement – who provides the upbeat opener John’s which Cash ties into his childhood in Arkansas. It’s the tale of an old rural gas station. Cash and Allen collaborated on Fair Weather Friends, a ballad loaded with strings and 80s electric piano that manages to transcend its dated arrangement.\n\nFrom there, though, the album starts to move into awkward territory. We Must Believe in Magic was a platinum LP for Crystal Gayle in 1977. The title track weaves together American destiny and cosmic spirituality into a heady mix that taps into the zeitgeist of the late 70s. In Cash’s hands, its simply not a good fit. His vocal delivery doesn’t convince like Gayle’s, and it’s made worse by the ethereal “magic” background vocals.\n\nMuch of the second side fumbles along through ok, but unconvincing numbers. Johnny’s take on Merle Haggard’s 1981 dream of riding the rails in Good Old American Guest has nothing on the original. And while I’m happy to get a shout-out to Canadian province Nova Scotia on Ain’t Gonna Hobo No More, do we really need two rail-ridin’ songs on here? These are also both rose-coloured views on homelessness that are a stark contrast to the brutal view of addiction presented in The Baron’s Ceiling, Four Walls and a Floor.\n\nThat just leaves us with two songs. A gospel tune in I’ll Cross Over Jordan which is nice, but doesn’t match similar past numbers like Far Side Banks of Jordan. And then there’s Sing a Song, written by an obscure Nashville artist – Tommy Cisco – who appears to have only had a couple of singles in 1978. That said, the message of this song might give the most honest window into Cash’s true state at the time:\n\nYes, for all the optimism on this album, I’m guessing Johnny was creating a façade that hid the real struggles he was going through. As I’ve discussed on other reviews from this era, he was facing addiction issues again as well as challenges in his marriag (note – another album without a June duet!). But with this album, the recording sessions seem to be pulled in many directions:\n\nSept 1980 – Recording the Baron single with Billy Sherrill.\n\nDec 1980 – Initial sessions with Jack Clement for Pride of Jesse Hallam including John Prine’s Paradise\n\nJan-Feb 1981 – More sessions with Jack Clement including initial takes of songs that would later appear on Adventures. Some of this material has been released on various compilations as discussed in my review of The Baron. (Plus a few other things like recording the Ray Charles duet with Billy Sherrill, an unreleased two-song session with Don Davis, and appearing on The Muppet Show).\n\nMarch 1981 – Back in the studio with Billy Sherrill recording the Baron album.\n\nApril 1981 – A few sessions for Marty Stuart’s solo album, and then a European tour (resulting in The Survivors LP).\n\nFeb 1982 – Back in the studio with Jack Clement\n\nWe haven’t seen a pattern like this since 1967, when Johnny was starting one album/single, moving to another, then back and forth. What’s common to that period and 1981-1982 is that Cash as deep into addiction issues. And while he’s capable of producing good music even when in poor health, he seems to lose focus in the periods, resulting in mediocre albums like Happiness is You and Adventures.\n\nOverall, I regard this album as a disappointment. Johnny had been trying to work with Clement as early as 1974, yet such sessions seemed to get thrown out the window. Their work was often gospel songs and their old favourites, paralleling sessions with a hot producer like John R. Cash’s Gary Klein. I can’t help but think that this is a sign that Cash was doing what he wanted to do with Clement, while doing what the label wanted elsewhere. Klein… Ahern… Sherrill… Johnny’s career was becoming a string of failed attempts at contemporary hits.\n\nWhat’s most disappointing about finally getting a Clement album is that whereas what we have of cut sessions are natural sounding acoustic-driven works, when we finally get an album it leans toward a slick modern sound. And while I enjoy Earl’s piano, and the guitar leads of Jerry Hensley (and once in a while Marty Stuart), I can’t help but wish the final product sounded more like the Dec. 1980 sessions used in the Jesse Hallam film.\n\n3/5\n\nOther Songs from the Era:\n\nThe Pride of Jesse Hallam – the made-for-TV movie starring Cash has tracks from the original sessions which sound more in line with what you’d expect from Cash and Clement. There’s a wonderful bluegrass-influenced arrangement of Paradise on here.\n\nGet In Line Brother – Another bluegrass tune for Marty Stuart’s Busy Bee Café record.\n\nA Fast Song – A fun acoustic demo released on Personal File.\n\nBen Dewberry’s Final Run – An outtake released on Life Unheard\n\nJohnny Cash released several live albums and all that we’ve heard so far have their own merit. The back-to-back late 60s prison albums of course stand tall as two of the greatest live albums of all time. Yet, even though they have similar settings and were recorded two years apart, they are quite different from one another. Folsom Prison is a man on fire desperate to rebuild his career after dark years squandered in addiction. San Quentin has renewed focus, introducing a wealth of new material via the live format.\n\nDig a little deeper, though, and you’ll find some gems in the 70s too. Pa Osteraker is the best document of the early 70s singer-songwriter material with Carl Perkins supporting on lead guitar. Strawberry Cake – recorded in London and interrupted by a bomb scare – shifts us into Johnny in family storyteller mode (much as the posthumous 1969 Madison Square Garden set did). It introduces Jerry Hensley on lead guitar, as well as several new songs. Last, Koncert V Praze, while not offering any surprising material on the setlist, gives us a set by the firmed up late 70s lineup (notably with Earl Poole Ball on piano) and is a rare concert by a Westerner behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nIn that light, The Survivors, recorded at an April 1981 Cash show in Stuttgart, Germany, continues the trend of giving us a new window into Cash’s live experience distinct from past releases. The story goes that Cash’s old Sun Records labelmates Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis had some time off in their own tour, and showed up at Cash’s show to add some fun into the end of his set. And what fun it is!\n\nThe Survivors is far from an accurate representation of the actual show. A few of the collaborations are cut, songs are reordered, and, most importantly, the first 25 (!) songs of the set are cut. That shows that despite his personal issues at the time, Cash was still working hard to put on a good show. Imagine being in the room for 25 songs, only to then have Carl and Jerry come out for another full set. That’s netiher here, nor there, though, because the album in itself is a well-balanced 12-song set that doesn’t overstay its welcome.\n\nThe album opens with two songs by the band, both going back to Johnny’s Sun Records roots: Get Rhythm and I Forgot to Remember to Forget. Both are well played and show that despite the size of his backing band The Great Eighties Eight, they could still perform these songs in a manner that reflected Cash’s 50s minimalism. On Get Rhythm Johnny calls out for Jerry to play a solo, and what a solo he plays. The band infuses some modern country rock energy into these classic tunes. Earl Poole Ball is always blazing away with barrelhouse piano. My only complaint is that they didn’t include Doin’ My Time – an outtake from The Baron, but a regular on-stage. Marty Stuart would switch from mandolin to electric, playing mind-blowing leads on Clarence White’s famed b-bender telecaster, and duetting with Cash. It’s an epic moment in Cash history, but never properly released!\n\nThat said, these two songs give a sense of what a Great Eighties Eight show was like, including the more melodic approach of studio ace Henry Strzelecki on bass compaerd to longtime member Marshall Grant. Then, Mr. Carl Perkins takes the stage, and his numbers are what you’d expect – Matchbox and Blue Suede Shoes of course, plus a couple of fun duets with Johnny. What’s notable is that these duets are songs we haven’t heard them sing together before – Goin’ Down the Road Feeling Bad and Gene Autry’s Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine (recorded on record with Cash’s brother Tommy) are new for these two, but sound like they’ve been doing them forever. You can hear the camaraderie and the connection between these two old friends.\n\nAnd then Jerry Lee Lewis takes the stage, and let’s just say from then on it’s 100% the Jerry Lee show. He plays his own classics (Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin On, Rockin’ My Life Away), but true to his longer career singing gospel music, leads the group in a whole whack of classics. I’ll Fly Away, Peace in the Valley, Will the Circle Be Unbroken, and Hank Williams’ I Saw the Light. The Killer makes sure that every single one of these tunes is indeed a killer.\n\nI’m not even that much of a Jerry Lee fan, but it’s hard to deny the raw electricity he brings to the stage. There are times when he’s just playing with two fingers an octave apart, and there’s more music there than in a whole song by (the truly gifted) Earl Poole Ball. The man just owns music. And then his voice, and his charisma. Johnny, Jerry, and Carl sound great together, but you can tell that Jerry is the boss.\n\nThese aren’t definitive performances, by any means, but they sound like a true homecoming. These guys had been in and out of each others’ lives since they turned the world upside down on Sun Records in the mid-50s. We saw them together paying tribute to Elvis Presley in Johnny’s 1977 Christmas Special, but this album feels more like a homecoming. After a proper Cash concert, two old friends drop in, and they just have a ball around the piano singing the old songs they love so much. Top to bottom, this is a super fun album and unlike any other in the Cash catalogue.\n\n4.5/5\n\nOther Songs from the Era:\n\nLive in London – Recorded on April 20, 1981 (three days before the Stuttgart show), this was released on VHS by the BBC in 1987. Clips pop up on YouTube from time to time and are worth watching… especially Doin’ My Time with Marty Stuart. This gives you a better idea of what the 25 songs that were played before the encores included in The Survivors were like.\n\nBallad of a Teenage Queen – A nice acoustic, Carter Family style version released on the 2004 Jack Clement album, Guess Things Happen That Way.\n\nThat’s How I Got to Memphis – Rosanne Cash had a rough start to her career, with her 1979 album not even getting US release. Her 1981 follow-up, however, hit #1 and her career was off. For the follow-up album, Somewhere in the Stars, Johnny helped his daughter out with a guest vocal on this beautiful cover of That’s How I Got to Memphis.\n\nMister Garfield – Merle Kilgore (who co-write Ring of Fire) released a one-off single with Ramblin’ Jack Elliott’s Mister Garfield as the a-side. Credited to “Merle Kilgore and Friends”, the friends are none other than Mr. Cash and Hank Williams Jr. Merle’s not much of a singer, though, and I prefer either of Cash’s versions to this one.\n\nChristmas in Scotland – Johnny’s 1981 Christmas special featured Andy Williams and Carlene Carter (who was living in London at the time). A few unusual songs on this one including Johnny and June duetting on Bob Dylan’s Man Gave Names to All the Animals and Old Flames Don’t Hold a Candle to You.\n\nI’ve listened to Rockabilly Blues and still don’t know what to think of it. I was excited when I first found this in a dusty used LP bin. Johnny looks awesome on the cover, and the title promises a great return to form. Plus, I saw that not only was there a Nick Lowe song on it, it was produced by Nick Lowe! I’m pretty sure this was my first 80s Johnny Cash album I purchased, and I was excited. If Elvis Costello’s bass player was involved – that singer of wry tunes like Cruel to be Kind – there had to be something interesting there. Plus, Nick was part of the post-punk London scene in which a genuine rockabilly movement was starting up (Brain Setzer’s Stray Cats were recording their first album that year, for example).\n\nBut what lies inside, is a real mixed bag. First, the album’s not really produced by Lowe, just his own song, Without Love. The bulk of the album was produced by Johnny’s piano player Earl Poole Ball. Given his barrelhouse style, then maybe we’d get some real cowboy music here, even more so given the rest of the songs were produced by Cowboy Jack Clement, who engineered Johnny’s stuff back in the Sun days. But no, this is a really slick 80s country album.\n\nNow, that’s not an entirely bad thing. Opening track Cold Lonesome Morning, written by Cash, is fantastic. It’s opening stomp recalls Big River, but played through a modern country lens. Then, part way through the song the most fiery guitar we’ve ever had on a Cash song breaks in. Where did that come from? The session notes list as many as five guitar players on each song here. Ok… we’re a long way from Memphis 1955, aren’t we? The only electric player listed is Bob Wooten, who replaced Luther Perkins following his death in 1969, but Wooten has never played hot leads. Jerry Hensley is still in the band, and we’ve heard him play some more rock oriented leads (especially if you’ve seen the complete Prague concert online). But dig a little deeper and you’ll see an important new name in the mix:\n\nMarty Stuart.\n\nYep, that Marty Stuart. The mandolin protégé picked up by Lester Flatt at the age of 12. Now in his early 20s he was already a road warrior and master of pretty much any instrument you put in his hands. Marty stayed on with the Nashville Grass for a year after Lester’s death and even got Johnny to sing on their first album without Lester. I’m assuming that was the point where Johnny brought Marty into his band. Unfortunately, I can’t find footage of Marty in Cash’s band before 1981, but there he is burning down the house on Clarence White’s famed b-bender Telecaster. That must be him dancing all over this opening tune.\n\nThe fun continues on Nick Lowe’s Without Love too. Another slick number, but a good song with great country guitar. Unfortunately, that’s where it goes downhill. We now get Johnny’s own W-O-M-A-N that reminds us how “the F-E-M-A-L-E can turn a B-O-Y into a M-A-N.” Yikes. And it seems from here, Johnny just can’t find a half-decent song. Another of his offerings, She’s a Go-er, is filled with more hokey imagery.\n\nThis is not to say that there aren’t some fine songwriters here. Billy Joe Shaver provides two songs. It Ain’t Nothing New Babe starts off promising with weeping dobro (another new element for Cash), but the lyrics don’t hold up. His other contribution, The Cowboy Who Started The Fight is the tale of a cowboy dying in a woman’s arms, which is fine enough subject matter for Cash. Filled with Shaver’s signature down-to-earth imagery, it sadly just gets creepy with lines like, “the lady gave up without question/The trophy she saved all her life.” Sorry, not for me.\n\nThere’s John Prine on here too, but unfortunately The Twentieth Century is Almost Over might have been relevant in 1980, but it just sounds dated now… especially because of the synthesizer lead! We have heard a synth once before on a Cash album, but now we are on the beginning of a new path in which modern sounds will be dumped all over Cash’s music. Which brings me to Kris Kristofferson’s fine ballad The Last Time which has cheesy 80s keyboards all over it. By the time we get to the end of the album, we have a fun duet with June courtesy of son-in-law Rodney Crowell, but One Way Rider isn’t as strong as their classics and is too little, too late on an already mediocre album.\n\nNow, I’ve saved one song for last: Rockabilly Blues (Texas 1955). One would think that a song like this would anchor the album and point to Cash recapturing past glories. But there’s a gaping hole on this album that shows exactly what’s wrong. Where is Marshall Grant?\n\nIf you know a bit about Cash’s story, you’ll know that by 1980 his life was a mess. He was three years back into addiction. June moved to England to stay with her daughter Carlene and her husband Nick Lowe (hence the Cash connection). And for some reason he saw it fit to fire Marshall Grant, the only living member of the Tennessee Two, who had been with Cash from the very beginning. Not only that, but he has the gall to sing a song about 1955 rockabilly that names Marshall by name. How sad.\n\nI’m not one to hang onto the past, or resist modernization. But I also recognize that we all have our strengths. What is it that makes Cash stand out above any other country artist? It’s that voice over a minimal background. That’s what worked so well with the Tennessee Two, where Johnny’s guitar playing was reduced to a simple clickety clack rhythm and all you had was Marshall’s simple bass and Luther’s strange little leads. Magic. I would argue, too, that while he had many other great periods and sounds, they all had a certain space and minimalism to them, even 1979’s modern layered Silver album.\n\nWith Rockabilly Blues we have the introduction of Cash’s new band: the Great Eighties Eight. And despite the phenomenal talent in the band – Earl’s piano, Marty’s guitar – Johnny does not need eight people in his band. He does not need four guitar players!\n\nSo in 1980 we have a revolutionary change in Cash’s sound and it’s not a good thing. Great talent. A mixed bag of songs. And a loss of the minimalism that made him great. How sad.\n\n2.5/5 – if only because of the first two songs and a few moments across the rest of the album.\n\nOther Songs from the Era:\n\nWe Oughta Be Ashamed – Duet recorded with Elvis Costello in Nick Lowe and Carlene Carter’s London home. Released on The Legend box set.\n\nThe Love That Never Failed – session outtake released on the Star Spangled Country compilation. A pleasant enough ballad. Except for the flute. Yes, flute.\n\nI’m Never Gonna Roam Again – session outtake released on The Legend box set. A decent song with cheesy keyboards.\n\nYou Just Can’t Beat Jesus Christ – an awesome outtake from the Jack Clement sessions featuring Billy Joe Shaver.\n\nSong of the Patriot – A – yep – patriotic single-only release that’s more of the same of the album.\n\nBilly Brown – A home demo released on House of Cash.\n\nI’m Never Gonna Roam Again/I’ll Go Somewhere and Sing My Songs Again/Wildwood in the Pines/A Winding Stream/Paradise/The Wayworn Travelller/I’m an Old Cowhand/Down in the Valley/Who’s Gene Autry? – more acoustic demos from Personal File, More Songs from Johnny’s Personal File, House of Cash, and The Legend box set. These are all solid, especially Prine’s Paradise.\n\nJohnny Cash: The First 25 Years – A retrospective television special featuring lots of hits. Released on DVD in 2006\n\nGone Girl is an album that gets easily lost in Johnny’s lesser known 70s material, but there’s definitely some worthy material here. This album is his second in a row with producer Larry Butler, who guided him through several successful albums in the early 70s after Bob Johnston moved on from Columbia and before Johnny started self-producing in his own studio.\n\nIn some ways, this album can be seen as more of the same – it continues the sound of Earl Poole Ball’s expert piano playing combined with Jerry Hensley’s lead guitar layered over the classic Tennessee Three backing. There’s also not a unifying theme to the album, not that that really helped recent albums like The Rambler – which was kind of half-baked – or the Last Gunfighter Ballad – which missed the opportunity to build out an album on that theme.\n\nInstead, we have a collection of random songs, but a collection that works overall. Now, some of the material is simply average. You And Me is the first duet with June in several albums. Co-written by producer Butler, it’s pleasant, but not one that will ever be revisited over their classic numbers. We can also surmise that the lack of inspiration on this front might be to the quiet return of addiction and marital troubles into Johnny’s life around this time. Then there’s a couple of predictable but enjoyable numbers in the middle of the album. A good crying-in-my-beer number with Earl’s honkytonk Sun-style piano, modernized with Jerry’s phased guitar on It Comes And Goes. And a sweet ballad – It’ll Be Her – written by Waylon Jennings’ guitarist, Billy Ray Reynolds. The opener, too – title track Gone Girl – brings the mariachi trumpets back into Cash’s world. Written by Jack Clement, it’s a decent song, but not an attention-grabber of an opener.\n\nThankfully, the album picks up on the rest of side 1. I Will Rock and Roll with you reflects back on the Sun rockabilly days (remember this is shortly after Elvis’ death) and is a great upbeat number. The Diplomat is one of the most overlooked songs in Cash’s catalogue. A deeply touching number about love, dying and loss, all wrapped up in a train song too. So good it can be forgiven for cribbing Sunday Morning Coming Down’s melody. And No Expectations – a deep cut from one of the Rolling Stones’ best albums, completely owned by Cash and the Carter Family? And who would expect Johnny to turn a slow country blues by the greatest rock and roll band of all time, into a rockier version? It’s great. And then side 2 gives us a true cajun number, Cajun Born, which far outdoes The Rambler’s Calilou.\n\nWhich leaves us two more songs to discuss. First, The Gambler. Yes, that song. Which was recorded only three weeks earlier by Kenny Rogers with Larry Butler. He was shopping the same song around to both of his clients, and both were released in the same month. We all know what happened to Kenny’s version and pay the price for that anytime we walk into a karaoke bar until the end of time. Johnny’s version… well, I happen to like it, but it wasn’t destined to be a classic. Wrong time, wrong place.\n\nThen, there’s the closing track, A Song for the Life. Wow, just wow. Written by up-and-coming Nashville artist Rodney Crowell who would soon marry Johnny’s daughter Rosanne. And here we have Rosanne Cash duetting with her father on one of the most powerful numbers in his catalogue. Johnny may have not “drink as much as I used to” as the song opens, but listen to that chorus:\n\nAnd somehow I’ve learned how to listen/ For a sound like the sun going down/In the magic the morning is bringing/There’s a song for the life I have found/It keeps my feet on the ground\n\nA Song for the Life (Rodney Crowell)\n\nPlayed with beautiful piano and tasteful strings (which pop up here and there throughout the album), if you’ve never heard this recording, you need to. Sadly, though, Cash’s addictions again mean lack of focus. Which means that while Kenny could turn The Gambler into a signature song, Cash turns the same material into another forgotten mid-career number.\n\n4/5\n\nOther Songs from the Era:\n\nThe Greatest Cowboy of Them All – Waylon Jennings recorded two duets with Cash during these sessions that were left on the cutting room floor. This one’s excellent, but didn’t see the light of day until 2006 on a Waylon Jennings box set. Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (another Rodney Crowell number) remains unreleased. This could have been an awesome 7” single!\n\nJealous Loving Heart/Soldier’s Last Letter – started in 1977 and overdubbed over time, Johnny guested on a couple of Ernest Tubb tunes (which were previously released without Cash). Jealous Loving Heart was released as an 7” and then both were on the 1979 album The Legend and the Legacy.\n\n1978 Christmas Special – these were now a regular thing on TV. This one’s notable for a few reasons. 1) some unique songs: Christmas Can’t Be Far Away, I Wonder How the Old Folks are At Home, and the unreleased The Greatest Cowboy of Them All (see above!); 2) he doesn’t just play the old hits, he plays a new song – I Will Rock and Roll With You; 3) great guests in Kris Kristofferson, Rita Coolidge, and Steve Martin; 4) Jack Routh is back even though he is now divorced from Carlene Carter and hadn’t played on recent studio efforts… this will be important for 1979.\n\nKoncert V Praze is an interesting release in the Cash canon. In April 1978, Cash had a 4-day engagement in Prague, Czechoslovakia. This might seem unremarkable today, but in the middle of the cold war it was almost impossible for westerners to pass beyond the Iron Curtain. Even with permits, travel would be complicated having to enter via East Berlin to begin with.\n\nThe album itself is 12 tracks of Johnny and the Tennessee Three (now five members as he explains in his stage banter thanks to the addition of Jerry Hensley and Earl Poole Ball). But if you’ve seen the full show on YouTube, you’ll know that this was a typical entourage gig… The Carters were there (with Jan Howard helping following the death of Mother Maybelle), and a young Rosanne Cash too.\n\nIn a more recent interview, Jan recounted:\n\n“I remember it was beautiful but that was behind the Iron Curtain and we couldn’t go anywhere without guards and all that stuff. We went to one area, one shop where I bought some porcelain. I hand carried that home all the way from there to Nashville. It was beautiful. I wish we had had an opportunity and a privilege to travel more in there, but we couldn’t at that time. I’m glad it’s changed… We came through East Berlin and it was not a good time to be there.”\n\nHow an American country star had any presence in the communist world, I’m not sure. He had accomplished the rare feat of establishing a market in the UK, and we now have live recordings from the Netherlands and Denmark, none of which are traditional country music markets. But how does one gain access to a world with no American music? For this reason alone, the album is significant. More so, the original 1983 release of the live album was a Czech exclusive on Supraphon Records. It became more widely available as part of the Complete Columbia Recordings box set.\n\nDespite this significance, I must admit that I have generally been cool on this album. This is most likely due to the cheesy synthesizer horns used on opening track Ring of Fire. In 1978 such technology was phenomenally expensive, so good job, Earl. But today they sound so, so dated.\n\nHowever, I’ve warmed over the years. First, when I finally watched the concert on YouTube I heard the band opening with a cover of the Allman Brothers’ Ramblin’ Man. What? This was the song that first made me notice Jerry Hensley on guitar. And not just guitar… a Gibson Les Paul. And he smokes! Since Carl Perkins left Cash’s fold in the mid-70s, June’s cousin (or as Johnny calls him here, his second cousin), slowly moved into the lead guitar seat. Bob Wooten was still there playing Luther-style leads, but Jerry would dance around him with subtle, but more technical lead lines. Actually seeing the band at work made me wake up to what solid musicianship was happening here.\n\nSecond, I noticed the arrangements of the songs and how the band sound had evolved, even beyond the vibe they built with Carl. I often talk about the “laid-back 70s vibe” of Johnny’s 70s work, and this album might be the best representation of what I mean. Everything’s played slower – especially classics like Folsom Prison and Big River – but they have a definite flow to them, Cash’s voice is solid, and despite the five-piece band (plus Cash and the Carters), the arrangements aren’t overdone. Thus, while Jerry could rip like he does on outtake Ramblin’ Man, he keeps everything cool and under control when Cash is on the stage. These are worthwhile additions to the Cash oeuvre.\n\nA fun album to check out.\n\n4/5\n\nOther Songs from the Era:\n\nThe album comes from a full concert that was part of a series of four shows in Prague. The full show was televised and has been released in part on DVD in 2006. The full show can be found on YouTube at times. Like past releases, the full concert is a classic Cash roadshow. As this was a rare opportunity to go behind the Iron Curtain, he brought everyone! Not included in the album are:\n\nA few opening tunes to warm up the crowd: Jerry sings Ramblin’ Man, Earl blazes through This Train is Bound for Glory, Jan sings Where No One Stands Alone and then a quick instrumental medley of I Walk the Line/Wreck of the Old 97/RIng of Fire/Folsom Prison Blues to welcome Cash to the stage.\n\nCut from Johnny’s set are Why Me Lord, Reason to Believe, Pickin’ Time, Hope You Remember When I’m Gone (a new song with Rosanne!), A Boy Named Sue, I Got Stripes, Man in Black and San Quentin\n\nThe whole Johnny & June duet set: Jackson, If I Were a Carpenter, and Darlin’ Companion\n\nRosanne singing So Fine from her recent debut album (unreleased in the US)\n\nAnita Carter singing Don’t Worry About Me (Marty Robbins song), and then dueting with her husband Bob Wooten on Buddy Holly’s I Guess It Doesn’t Matter Anymore\n\nAll the Carters singing Wildwood Flower\n\nA round of songs with everyone – the Carters, Jan Howard, Johnny’s daughter Rosanne – featuring Will the Circle Be Unbroken, A Thing Called Love, and Daddy Sang Bass (with a young John Carter Cash singing Jan Howard’s “Mama Sang Tenor” line)\n\nSo, The Rambler wasn’t exactly a success. And apart from a session starting a track with Ernest Tubb in May 1977, Johnny didn’t return to the studio much that year. Part of this is because he no longer owned his studio, having sold it to engineer Charlie Bragg. Also, stepson-in-law Jack Routh who was central to The Rambler is now out of the band, assumedly because this is about the time of his divorce from Carlene Carter.\n\nBut in October, Johnny returned to the studio he no longer owned to hammer out an album with Larry Butler. Having seen Johnny move back and forth between self-production and one-off producers, the move to Butler is an interesting one. Butler produced a string of moderately successful albums for Cash in the early 70s, notably A Thing Called Love. Butler also played a lot of piano on those albums, but by 1977 Earl Poole Ball – a killer pianist – was a central member of Cash’s band.\n\nFortunately, Larry doesn’t seem to have been precious on this point. Instead, he uses Earl brilliantly on this album. If you like Cash with piano, this is the album for you. Additionally, Larry brought in the famous Jordanaires (who were often overdubbed onto Cash’s Sun Records material) to fill out the sound. And while there are many Cash albums with over-the-top backing vocals (I’m looking at you Don Davis and Look at Them Beans!), they are incredibly well blended here.\n\nWhat I really like about this album, then, is that while it’s not a firecracker of an album like The Fabulous Johnny Cash or At Folsom Prison, and it doesn’t have the singer-songwriter depth of Hello, I’m Johnny Cash or Man in Black, it’s a tasteful rendering of Cash’s laid-back late 70s sound. There are a lot of ballads – opener I Would Like to See You Again has some gorgeous harmonica; Lately balances the Tennessee Three sound with Earl’s piano, the Jordanaires harmonies, and Jerry’s Hensley’s hot leads; Hurt So Bad has a Caribbean vibe (and some mellow Fender Rhodes behind the piano); and That’s the Way It Is… well, that one’s a bit of a dull ballad, but I’ll forgive one strike (this one was co-written by Butler who I’m guessing wanted some songwriting points on the album).\n\nThere are also some lighthearted numbers too that while not reaching the heights of One Piece at a Time, are enjoyable enough. After Taxes puts Johnny in the workingman’s shoes. And Who’s Gene Autry? not only has Johnny telling his son John about his own childhood hero, but also has about the catchiest chorus Cash has ever churned out. I love this one.\n\nBut there are two pairs of songs that really stand out for me on this album. First are two songs that tap into Johnny’s worldview as a down-to-earth Christian. Abner Brown, written by Cash, is the tale of a homeless man whose generosity and kindness puts the wealthy to shame. I’m Alright Now – written by guitarist Jerry Hensley – is as humble a gospel song as Cash ever sang, speaking to the simple grace of recognizing your past failings and allowing yourself to not let that drag you down. This is a shift from some of the more sanctimonious material that Cash was dabbling in during the early 70s. He was still active in evangelical circles at this time (and would be until his death), but he was finding ways to reconcile his Man in Black philosophy with some of the holier-than-thou attitudes that pervaded some of the churches he was around.\n\nThe final pair, though, is where this album really kicks into gear and these are thanks to a 1976 session with none other than Waylon Jennings. I Wish I Were Crazy Again and There Ain’t No Good Chain Gang are hands down two of the best songs Cash released in the 1970s. Cash knew Waylon before Waylon was a star. In fact, when his first marriage finally collapsed, Cash moved into a cheap apartment with a young Waylon. Hearing these two outlaws together is just glorious. Crazy Again (wish Cash also attempted earlier in 1976 in an unreleased session with Merle Haggard) is played so, so well. The first verse has Cash singing over a Waylon shuffle, and the second verse has Waylon singing over a Tennessee Three backing, and then it all breaks down into a bluegrass waltz for the chorus. It’s brilliant. And then Chain Gang is the most rocking song Cash had released maybe since Run Softly Blue River. Waylon has his hot licks flying all over, and the two voices blend together perfectly. Love it.\n\nOverall, this is a very solid release.\n\n4/5\n\nOther material from the era:\n\n1977 Christmas Special – Cash was not very productive in the studio in 1977, but he did release his second TV Christmas special. These are now available on DVD and are often on YouTube. For 1977 he brought together some of his Sun friends in tribute to Elvis’ death (Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins), Roy Clark plays some awesome guitar on a couple of duets with Cash, and the Carters and the Statlers join in for a few songs, including a great version of Children Go Where I Send Thee. Fun stuff.\n\nThe Rambler has all the signs of a solid Cash album. Structured around the story of a man driving around aimlessly, seeing where the road will take him, it seems like Cash might be getting his mojo back. Concept albums have worked well for him in the past – think Bitter Tears or Ballads of the True West. And opening track Hit the Road and Go is a solid start. With a Big River vibe to it, it highlights two growing presences in Cash’s band – Earl Poole Ball’s rollicking piano drives the song along, and Jerry Hensley (June Carter Cash’s nephew) adds some rocking guitar fills.\n\nThe problem is that few of these tunes are particularly memorable, largely because they all remind you of something else you’ve heard by Cash before (see the comparison of Hit the Road and Go vs. Big River above). Wednesday Car is a sub-par One Piece At a Time – his big hit from just one album previous. And then there’s After the Ball, which despite being enjoyable because of it’s Sun Records sounding riff, might seem more familiar than just it’s harkening back to the Get Rhythm sound. That’s because it’s exactly the same as All I Do is Drive from the America album, again only released a few years earlier. And wouldn’t All I Do is Drive be a better fit for an album called The Rambler about a guy who just drives, drives, drives…?\n\nAnd then there’s the elephant in the room. The narrative about these figure called The Rambler. You see, the album is only 8 songs long because it offers us a little story about this mysterious man. If you’ve seen any of those old Cash films like Five Minutes to Live, you’ll know why he wasn’t cast too often. He’s a bit, well, wooden. Now in this case, you’d think he might do like they did in the movies and cast him alongside some stronger talent to compensate. But, no. Instead he chose such looming thespian luminaries as… his stepson-in-law Jack Routh? Now Jack plays a decent acoustic guitar, and had written a few decent tunes for Johnny, but really?\n\nThings get weirder when The Rambler (Johnny) and the hitchhiker (Jack) stopover at a cheap hotel and start hitting on some girls… played by Johnny’s stepdaughter Carlene and daughter Rosanne? Um… awkward? Thankfully it doesn’t go beyond giving one of the girls a lift back home. I’m glad to get out of the car at that point and not have to ramble any further.\n\nWhen I step away from the half-baked story, and the fair-to-middlin’ material, one song always stands out in my memory… the great gospel number No Earthly Good. Cash had been working on this one for a few years, first as an acoustic demo available on Personal File, and then as a collaboration with the Oak Ridge Boys. But here he nails his own version in a cool, laid-back 70s country style. And the message is profound, drawing together Cash’s post 1970s evangelical leanings with his generous, down-to-earth warmth. The message is a wonderful challenge to anyone who thinks of themselves as religious:\n\nA stellar highlight on an ok album. The music: 3.5/5. The album with all the dialogue: 2.5/5\n\nOther songs from the era:\n\nIt Takes One To Know Me: An absolute classic song written about aging. How did this one not get proper release? There’s a stunning acoustic version on Personal File, and an orchestrated duet with June that was unreleased until the Legend Box Set and Duets compilation came out (that version was finished in the 2000s with Carlene Carter).\n\nIf It Wasn’t For the Wabash River: an acoustic demo is available on the House of Cash bonus CD.\n\nI Can’t Go On That Way: an upbeat tune about leaving old ways behind. Released on the Life compilation."
