        "text": "Willie Nelson, (born April 29, 1933, Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.), U.S. country music singer and songwriter. His grandfather taught him to play guitar, and by age 10 he was performing at local dances. After working as a disc jockey, in 1961 he moved to Nashville, Tenn., where he wrote hit songs for dozens of country, rhythm-and-blues, and pop singers; these songs included “Hello Walls,” “Night Life,” and “Crazy.” He returned to Texas and released the hit album Red Headed Stranger (1975). He recorded with numerous other singers, including Waylon Jennings. In 1985 Nelson cofounded Farm Aid, which organized festivals to raise money for farmers. His later albums included Teatro (1998), Heroes (2012), and Last Man Standing (2018). Nelson was a well-known and enthusiastic connoisseur of marijuana, and, after a few states legalized the drug’s sale and purchase, he launched (2015) a marijuana supply company, Willie’s Reserve."
