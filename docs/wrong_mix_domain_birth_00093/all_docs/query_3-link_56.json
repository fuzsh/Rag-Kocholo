        "text": "Willie Nelson may have recently turned 91 years old, but he’s not slowing down yet. The country superstar dropped his 75th and latest studio album, The Border, on Friday, May 31 via Legacy Recordings.\n\nThe collection is the latest in Nelson’s more than 100-album long discography (it’s his 152nd album, according to Texas Monthly‘s interactive All Willie Nelson Albums Ranked list), and follows September 2023’s Bluegrass. The project features 10 newly-recorded studio performances, including four new Nelson/Buddy Cannon compositions: “Once Upon a Yesterday,” “What If I’m Out of My Mind,” “Kiss Me When You’re Through,” “How Much Does It Cost” and “Hank’s Guitar,” which was co-written by Cannon and Bobby Tomberlin.\n\nMore from Billboard\n\nEminem Performs His Next Magic Trick With New Single 'Houdini': Stream It Now\n\nDonavan's Yard Announces Massive Dance Hall Block Party in Los Angeles\n\nTwenty One Pilots Drop Limited Edition 'Clancy' Deluxe Album With Live Bonus Tracks & More\n\nIt’s gearing up to be an exciting year for Nelson, who is bringing his popular 4th of July Picnic to a new location. The event will take place at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion in Camden, N.J., just outside Philadelphia. “I am thrilled to bring the 4th of July Picnic to Philadelphia for the first time in our storied history,” Nelson said in a statement at the time. “It’s an honor to host such an extraordinary lineup of talent in the birthplace of our country. We can’t wait to celebrate Independence Day with you.”\n\nIn addition to Nelson, the lineup will include Bob Dylan, Robert Plant & Alison Krauss, Maren Morris, Mavis Staples and Celisse.\n\nNelson will also headline his annual Outlaw Music Festival Tour, which kicks off June 21 in Alpharetta, Georgia, and features many of the same artists as will appear at the July 4 event.\n\nIn the meantime, listen to Willie Nelson’s The Border in full below.\n\nBest of Billboard"
