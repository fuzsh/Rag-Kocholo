        "text": "Willie Nelson is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, social activist, and actor. Owing to the tremendous success of his albums ‘Shotgun Willie’ and ‘Red Headed Stranger,’ Willie became one of the most influential names in the history of American country music. Born and raised in Texas, Willie started playing music at the age of 7, and by 10, he was already part of a music band. He toured around the state of Texas with his band, ‘Bohemian Polka,’ as a teen, but making music for a living was still not his primary plan. Willie joined the ‘American Air Force’ as soon as he graduated from high school. In the mid-1950s, his song ‘Lumberjack’ started gaining significant attention. This led Willie to quit everything else and to focus only on music. After he joined ‘Atlantic Records’ in 1973, Willie gained immense fame. Two of his albums in particular, ‘Red Headed Stranger’ and ‘Honeysuckle Rose,’ turned him into a national icon. As an actor, Willie has appeared in over 30 films and has co-authored several books. He happens to be a liberal activist and has never shied away from expressing his thoughts about the legalization of marijuana."
