This Fourth of July, the Philadelphia area will be the epicenter of music, history and celebration as Willie Nelson's renowned 4th of July Picnic descends upon the City of Brotherly Love. This historic, not-to-be-missed event at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion in Camden, NJ, is set against the backdrop of some of America's most storied landmarks, and is produced by Willie Nelson, Blackbird Presents, Live Nation and the Outlaw Music Festival Tour.\n\nClare Bowen notes, “We’re honored to be part of Willie Nelson's 4th of July Picnic.

Clare, a radiant star from rural Australia known for her role as Scarlett on the hit TV series Nashville, and Brandon, a melody-spinner from Connecticut, found their destinies entwined in the heart of Nashville. Their musical odyssey began in 2013 when Brandon, a last-minute replacement, shared the stage with Clare at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena.\n\nThe unique chemistry discovered that night marked the inception of a musical partnership destined for prominence. Two years later, love took center stage at Ryman Auditorium, where Brandon proposed, and in 2017, John Carter Cash oﬃciated their union at the Cash Cabin. Their collaborative journey, guided by acclaimed Americana songwriter/producer Sean McConnell, resulted in the creation of Us, a 10-track masterpiece capturing the raw essence of their emotions, listen HERE. From facing adversity with the haunting single \"Dangerous Love\" to the global resonance of their ethereal songs, BOWEN * YOUNG's symphony of life and art resonates with boundless passion, culminating in the highly anticipated debut album released globally on May 3, 2024, via Snakefarm/PIAS.
