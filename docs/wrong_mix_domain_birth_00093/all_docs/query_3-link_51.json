I scoured the internet for shows playing in Vegas at the time and we selected three which we wanted to see. One of them was Willie Nelson. He was playing in a small club just off the strip so the crowd was fairly small. We were able to sit just a few feet from Willie and watch him sing and perform his set. What a magical night.\n\nNow, one of the other acts we saw while in Vegas was David Copperfield and while he was great and we loved the illusions he performs, on this day, sixteen years later, Willie is what I remember from going to Las Vegas.\n\nWillie Nelson is to Country or American Music as apple pie or baseball is to America. Willie Nelson is the rare musician who appeals to all tastes. That doesn’t mean everybody likes Willie, but, I suspect you wouldn’t be reading this book unless you do. He has had a fantastic career over the years. Willie has always been his own man. He does what he wants and doesn’t worry about the consequences. I can’t tell you how much I have enjoyed writing the story of the life and the music of Willie Nelson. I hope you like it.\n\nA Texas Boy\n\nWillie Hugh Nelson was born April 29, 1933 in the little town of Abbott, Texas. He came into the world just a few minutes before midnight on the 29th, but the doctor, when he wrote up the birth certificate, put down he was born on the 30th. If you check a website like imdb.com, they still claim Willie’s birthday is April 30, when in fact, it was April 29. He had flaming red hair right from the moment he was born. Willie had an older sister, Bobbie Lee, who preceded him in 1931.\n\nIn 1930, the population of Abbott, Texas was 326, so this was a tiny town. It’s located about 70 miles south of Dallas and 26 miles north of Waco, Texas. I recently drove I-35 from Dallas to Austin. I passed within a few miles of Willie Nelson’s birthplace and didn’t even know it. Willie says Abbott was a no-horse town (as opposed to a one-horse town,) because the only horse that lived anywhere near them was just over the city line about two miles out of town.\n\n1933 was the middle of the depression and times were hard. Willie’s mother was Myrle Marie Nelson (maiden name: Greenshaw) and his father was Ira Doyle Nelson, who was a mechanic. There’s not much to say about mom and dad, because they both left Willie when he was little and were never a part of his life. Myrle left the family shortly after Willie was born and then without a wife, Ira also moved out. Ira stayed in Abbott for a while but left the raising of little Willie to his grandparents, Alfred and Nancy Nelson or as Willie called them, Mama Nelson and Papa Nelson.\n\nWillie’s grandparents raised them from then on and Willie saw little of his real father and mother. Eventually Ira got divorced from Myrle and re-married and Willie only saw him once in a while during his growing up years. His parents didn’t even name him. His name was given to him by a cousin named Mildred. She also gave him his middle name of Hugh. Most of his growing up years, they called him Hughty.\n\nMama and Papa Nelson both loved music. Mama taught music to the local kids who wanted to learn. Papa could play the guitar and when Willie turned six, he bought a cheap one from Sears, so he could teach Willie how to play. Mama Nelson first taught Bobbie to play the piano by using an old pump-organ they had. Until they could afford to buy an actual piano, Bobbie made a piano out of cardboard, so she could practice her fingering. Bobbie became a very accomplished pianist. She has played for Willie’s band almost from the beginning.\n\nMusic was a part of their family since they were little, but things opened up for them when Mama and Papa Nelson bought a new Philco radio. Now they could listen to the music of American. They were in Texas, so you can imagine that most of the music they heard was country. Country was just getting started in the Thirties. Willie listened to people like Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family. People like this planted the seed that would grow into an adult country singer, Willie Nelson. Willie also liked Ernest Tubb and Bob Wills. He says Ernest Tubb was his first singing hero.\n\nIn 1940, when Willie was six years old, Alfred or Papa Nelson suddenly died due to complications from pneumonia. He was fifty-six. Willie wasn’t old enough to understand what death was about, but he knew he was now the man of the house and if things hadn’t been tough before, they got much tougher after the death of Papa.\n\nWillie found that he was great at writing simple poems. The death of his grandfather seemed to push him into overdrive, for he found himself writing more and more about loss and"
