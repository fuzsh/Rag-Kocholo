        "text": "The first time I saw Willie Nelson, he looked a lot like Howdy Doody. Cleanshaven, with wavy red hair, parted neatly on the left. He wore a blue blazer with a snappy tie. And almost no one who attended the Frances “Sissy” Farenthold for governor rally at a leafy park in Dallas in 1972 knew who the heck he was.\n\nAs the website Taste of Country later noted, Willie “didn’t adopt his signature look until the 1975 album, Red Headed Stranger,” which became a breakout surprise, selling more than 2 million copies. One of its songs, “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,” quickly became a No. 1 single.\n\nBy then, pretty much everybody knew the name of the bearded, bandanna-wearing “cosmic cowboy” who had fled Nashville for Austin, saving from a white-hot inferno his Martin N-20 guitar — “Trigger” — as his Tennessee home collapsed into ashes. He also managed to rescue a stash of rare Colombian weed.\n\nRelated:Tickets for Willie Nelson’s Outlaw Music Festival Tour stop in Dallas go on sale this week\n\nNow, of course, it’d be hard to find anybody who doesn’t know Willie, for whom a surname borders on the redundant.\n\nOne of the most prolific songwriters and recording artists in the history of music, Willie has recorded more than 200 albums — almost 100 in the studio, as well as “live,” “compilation” and “video” albums.\n\nPretty good for an old guy who’s forever “on the road again,” playing live shows and cutting new records on the eve of his 90th birthday, which arrives April 29. Willie will celebrate the launch of his nonagenarian years with a lavish, two-day concert at the Hollywood Bowl. He will then resurface in Dallas on June 30, headlining the Outlaw Music Festival Tour with a stop at Fair Park’s Dos Equis Pavilion.\n\nAs Willie once wrote, “My doctor tells me I should start slowing it down — but there are more old drunks than there are old doctors so let’s all have another round.”\n\nWillie will share his birthday bash with such heavyweights as Neil Young, Chris Stapleton, Lyle Lovett, Rosanne Cash, Snoop Dogg, The Chicks, and a pair of East Texas sensations, Miranda Lambert from Lindale, and Kacey Musgraves from Golden, near Mineola.\n\nWillie did more than change the course of American music with his risk-taking move from Nashville to Austin. Nearly half a century after the release of Red Headed Stranger, his legacy extends to performances in the White House.\n\nTo his fans and friends, Willie is a timeless icon. He shows not a shred of shame as the country’s most alluring pot smoker. And he somehow manages to rise above political and cultural divides, appealing to young and old, rich and poor, even to the most outspoken on the left and right.\n\nHe does it with a personality that is old-world genuine and a talent that transcends popular music. He ascribes to the adage, attributed to numerous musicians, that there are only two kinds of music: good and bad. He’s a cultural force who radiates happiness and a feeling of self-worth without being vain or narcissistic, a Texan with a twang who exudes Zen-like contentment.\n\nWillie’s longtime friend, Dallas-born actor Morgan Fairchild, who starred alongside Willie in a film adaptation of Red Headed Stranger, calls him “a real Texan, through and through. All the best of Texas — the kindness, the gentleness, the toughness, the geniality, the wise-ass humor, everything that’s good about Texas is Willie Nelson.”\n\nHis biggest fan may still be former President Jimmy Carter, for whom Nelson performed Ray Charles’ “Georgia on My Mind” on the campaign trail in 1976 and in 2002 in Oslo, Norway, where Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“I think as much as any performer who has ever lived, Willie has had an intimate and natural relationship with working people,” says Carter, now receiving hospice care at his home in Georgia.\n\n“When I was in trouble in the White House or needed to be alone, just to relax — I’m a fly fisherman, and I would tie flies in my study, where Truman used to work, while Willie Nelson songs played on the hi-fi. So, all the good things I did or, of course, all the mistakes I made, you could kind of blame half that on Willie.”\n\nFairchild calls Willie “the most wonderful guy in the world. What you see is what you get — funny, witty, really smart, and very quick, just the most kind, loving, giving human being.”\n\nRed Headed Stranger was a turning point in more ways than one, not only in transforming Willie’s appearance but also in punching his ticket to the world of double platinum, making it, in the decade of its release, the best-selling country album ever recorded.\n\nAssembled at an unassuming studio in Garland, it stood out for its innovation, as a novel-like album about a preacher on the lam after killing his estranged wife.\n\nIt won Nelson his first Grammy award in 1975 for best male country vocal performance for the song “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.” He went on to win 13 more, including “Mamas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys” (1978) with Waylon Jennings, “On the Road Again” (1980) and “Always On My Mind” (1982). More recent Grammy awards include traditional pop vocal album in 2018 for My Way, a tribute to his friend Frank Sinatra; best country solo performance in 2020 for “Ride Me Back Home”; and best country album earlier this year for A Beautiful Time.\n\nLike Sinatra, Willie has always done it his way. In what felt like an act of defiance aimed at Nashville, his bare-bones production of Red Headed Stranger emerged as the antithesis of the tired, old Nashville way of making a record.\n\nWillie calculated correctly that Austin would allow him to be himself, in writing songs and making records truer to his identity. What he may not have counted on, however, were the ways his move transformed his adopted city from the moribund status of a sleepy state capital and college town to a new and exciting destination on America’s musical road map. This alone may have been Willie’s greatest gift to his native Texas, where he was born in the Hill County town of Abbott, 70 miles south of Dallas.\n\n“His career should have been over,” says Joe Nick Patoski, who wrote the 2008 biography Willie Nelson: An Epic Life. “But he reinvented himself in Austin, and he became what we now know as a one-name superstar. Willie transcended even football.”\n\n“I also look at him as the single-most important Texan of the 20th and the 21st century, because he not only reflects — he defines Texas culture. No single person epitomizes the qualities that make Texans different from other people and separates Texas from the rest of the world, not just the United States.”\n\nWillie’s astonishing run of studio albums began in 1962, when he released ... And Then I Wrote, with the cover revealing his Howdy Doody look fully intact. Long before he established himself as a singer, he wrote hits for Patsy Cline (“Crazy,” 1961), Faron Young (“Hello Walls,” 1961), Billy Walker (“Funny How Time Slips Away,” 1961) and Ray Price (“Night Life,” 1963). Nelson himself recorded “(Turn Out the Lights) The Party’s Over” in 1966.\n\nThat year coincided with the Dallas Cowboys’ first winning season. The team’s quarterback, Don Meredith, had already blessed “(Turn Out the Lights) The Party’s Over,” calling it his all-time favorite tune, one he asked Nelson to sing on frequent visits to the Meredith home.\n\nMeredith’s son Michael, born in Dallas in 1967, said his dad told him that Nelson would sing to him as a baby, in hopes of getting him to sleep — and to give his parents a break. The elder Meredith repaid the favor by crooning “(Turn Out the Lights) The Party’s Over” as a broadcaster on Monday Night Football for years, when the outcome of the game was no longer in doubt.\n\nWillie began playing the guitar at 6, wrote his first song a year later and joined a local band at 9. In 1969, he found a companion that put his dreams into overdrive. It was a Martin N-20 acoustic guitar with nylon strings that gave Willie the sound he wanted, evoking Django Reinhardt, the Belgian-born jazz guitar master whom Willie held as his most enduring musical influence.\n\nHe even gave the guitar a name — Trigger — in honor of Roy Rogers’ horse.\n\nRelated:Bobbie Nelson, who once told little brother Willie, ‘You sing and I’ll play the piano,’ dies at 91\n\nA year after buying Trigger for $750, Willie watched helplessly as his Nashville home was engulfed in flames. Risking his life, he raced inside to save Trigger, which has stayed with him ever since. Willie has often said Trigger was the only thing he hopes to take to his grave.\n\nAs he told Rolling Stone, Trigger was worth risking death. Although firefighters were not happy about Nelson re-entering the house, he escaped injury.\n\n“I saved Trigger,” Nelson said, “so it was a good day.”"
