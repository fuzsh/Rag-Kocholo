        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nWillie Nelson‘s 4th of July Picnic is moving to Philadelphia. (Well, actually the aptly named Freedom Mortgage Pavilion across the Delaware River in Camden, New Jersey.)\n\nOn Tuesday, the event’s organizers announced that the annual fest — held in Texas since 2010 — will move to the Philly area for the very first time. Bob Dylan is among the Independence Day concert’s performers.\n\nRounding out the lineup for the event, scheduled for July 4, are Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, Maren Morris, Mavis Staples, and guitarslinger Celisse.\n\n“I am thrilled to bring the 4th of July Picnic to Philadelphia for the first time in our storied history,” said Nelson in a press release. “It’s an honor to host such an extraordinary lineup of talent in the birthplace of our country. We can’t wait to celebrate Independence Day with you.”\n\nTickets for the event will go on sale starting Friday at 10 a.m./ET. Citi cardholders will have access to presale tickets between March 26 and March 28.\n\nThe festival lineup seems to be an extension to Nelson’s Outlaw Tour, which includes all the performers at the 4th of July Picnic, except Morris. That tour starts on June 21 in Georgia and includes a stop at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Bowl. (Billy Strings and John Mellencamp are also joining for some of the Outlaw shows.)\n\nTrending\n\nThis is the third time that Dylan has joined the annual picnic. He last did so in 2009, which coincidentally was the last time that the event was hosted outside of Texas. (It was in South Bend, Indiana, that year.)"
