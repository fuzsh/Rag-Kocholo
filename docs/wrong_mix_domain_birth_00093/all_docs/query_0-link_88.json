Born on May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, California, Eastwood's journey to stardom began when he moved to Los Angeles in the 1950s. It was here that he broke into the entertainment industry, initially securing minor roles until he landed his breakthrough role as Rowdy Yates in the television series Rawhide. Eastwood's career took a monumental turn when he ventured into the Spaghetti Western genre under the direction of Sergio Leone. His iconic portrayal of the Man with No Name in films like A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly propelled him to international stardom. However, it was his role as Dirty Harry Callahan in the eponymous five-film series that solidified his status as a bona fide action star. His trademark squint and gravelly voice became cinematic staples, marking him as a symbol of rugged individualism. In addition to his acting career, Eastwood has also made significant contributions behind the camera. His directorial debut came in 1971 with Play Misty for Me, and he has since directed numerous acclaimed films, including Unforgiven, which won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Eastwood's influence extends beyond film and television; he served as the Mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California from 1986 to 1988, and his passion for music has seen him score several of his own films.

It was his challenging early life that shaped his raw and intense acting style which would later earn him two Academy Awards among numerous other acolytes.

The film's success solidified his position as one of Hollywood's most versatile actors, demonstrating his ability to portray both heroes and villains with equal conviction. In addition to his successful film career, Hackman also made his mark as an author. He co-wrote several historical fiction novels, further showcasing his creative prowess. Despite retiring from acting in 2004, Hackman's work continues to be celebrated and referenced in contemporary cinema. His contributions to the film industry have made him one of the most respected figures in Hollywood, his legacy standing as a testament to his talent, dedication, and unwavering commitment to his craft.\n\nAge : 94\n\nBirthplace : USA, San Bernardino, California\n\nGeorge Soros, born on August 12, 1930, in Budapest, Hungary, is a renowned financier, philanthropist, and political activist. His journey to fame and fortune began when he fled Hungary during the Second World War and resettled in England. There, he attended the London School of Economics, where he was deeply influenced by philosopher Karl Popper's ideas about open societies. Upon his graduation in 1952, he entered the world of finance and started carving out an illustrious career in investment banking. Soros, often dubbed as \"The Man Who Broke the Bank of England,\" made headlines in 1992, when he bet against the British pound and generated a profit of $1 billion overnight in an event known as Black Wednesday. This audacious move solidified Soros's status as one of the world's most astute currency traders. In 1973, he founded the hedge fund company, Soros Fund Management, which went on to become one of the most successful firms in the industry, pushing his net worth into the billions. However, Soros's impact extends beyond the realm of finance. He channelled a significant portion of his wealth into philanthropic endeavours, primarily through the Open Society Foundations. These organizations support projects in education, public health, and civil liberties in more than 120 countries worldwide. As a political activist, Soros has been a vocal critic of various international policies and has used his influence to advocate for changes. He has also authored several books on topics such as global capitalism, geopolitics, and open societies, further demonstrating his multifaceted persona.\n\nAge : 93\n\nBirthplace : Budapest, Hungary\n\nBuzz Aldrin, born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr., is an American astronaut and mechanical engineer who made significant contributions to the history of space exploration. Born on January 20, 1930, in Montclair, New Jersey, Aldrin graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and later earned a doctorate in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Aldrin's name came into prominence when he joined NASA's Astronaut Group 3 in 1963. His first spaceflight occurred in 1966 aboard Gemini 12, where he set a record for extravehicular activity and effectively proved that astronauts could work outside spacecraft. However, it was his second spaceflight that would etch his name in gold in the annals of history. As a member of the Apollo 11 mission, Aldrin became the second person to walk on the moon on July 20, 1969, following mission commander Neil Armstrong. This monumental achievement was watched by millions around the globe and stands as a pivotal moment in human space exploration. Post-NASA career, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration and has written numerous books and papers on the subject. He proposed a special spacecraft cycling system, now known as the Aldrin cycler, aiming to provide regular, cost-effective travel to Mars. To this day, Aldrin has remained a prominent figure in the public eye, often speaking at events and appearing in popular culture as an icon of human adventure and discovery. His life serves as a testament to the power of human ambition and the limitless possibilities of exploration.\n\nAge : 94\n\nBirthplace : USA, Glen Ridge, New Jersey\n\nGeorge Michael Steinbrenner III (July 4, 1930 – July 13, 2010) was an American businessman who was the principal owner and managing partner of Major League Baseball's New York Yankees. During Steinbrenner's 37-year ownership from 1973 to his death in July 2010, the longest in club history, the Yankees earned seven World Series titles and 11 pennants. His outspokenness and role in driving up player salaries made him one of the sport's most controversial figures. Steinbrenner was also involved in the Great Lakes and Gulf Coast shipping industry. Known as a hands-on baseball executive, Steinbrenner earned the nickname \"The Boss\". He had a tendency to meddle in daily on-field decisions, and to hire and fire (and sometimes re-hire) managers.
