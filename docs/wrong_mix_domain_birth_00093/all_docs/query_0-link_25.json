        "text": "Size: 4\"\n\nMaterial: Glass & Glitter\n\nAn Old World Christmas glass ornament\n\nTake a trek through the Pacific Northwest with this State of Washington Ornament from Old World Christmas, a 4-inch glass homage to the Evergreen State. Adorning your tree with this piece is like taking a miniature journey through Washington's diverse landscapes, from the towering, snow-dusted peak of Mount Rainier to the lush, rain-soaked forests of Puget Sound.\n\nThis ornament is a celebration of Washington's unique claim to fame. It's the only state in the union named after a President, and it packs a punch with its natural beauty and cultural landmarks. The Space Needle, an icon of Seattle's skyline since the 1962 World's Fair, takes center stage, reminding us of the city's spirit of innovation and its eye on the future.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the coffee! As the birthplace of Starbucks it's a fact that Seattle fueled a coffee revolution. For apple enthusiasts, Washington's apple is represented in shiny red, symbolizing the state's status as the top apple-producing state in the country.\n\nWhether you're a Washington native, a frequent visitor to its picturesque landscapes, or an admirer from afar, this ornament brings a bit of the state's splendor to your holiday festivities. So go ahead, hang this keepsake on your tree and let it spark tales of adventure in the great Pacific Northwest or dreams of sipping coffee in the shadow of the Space Needle. It's a small token of a state with a big heart and even bigger scenery.\n\nText on Old World hang tag: Washington State, the Evergreen State sees people flock by the millions to visit. Tourists stop along the Puget Sound to see whales migrating and visit the Space Needle to catch a glimpse of Mount Rainier. Washington produces over half the country's apples each year."
