Blair, was superintendent of the Trinity schools during those years.\n\nMarie Blair is survived by her son Col. Ben Blair and his wife Doris and her daughter Rowena Blair McPherson and her husband Bill, all of Trinity County. She had 6 grandsons and 2 granddaughters along with 18 great-grandchildren.\n\nShe lived a remarkable life and remained alert, clever and witty through her 104 years.\n\nBorn in Ellinger, Fayette County, Texas, a few miles southeast of La Grange, on October 4, 1888, Marie Kucera Blair was born to Czechoslovakian parents.Â She was the third of twelve children, six boys and six girls.Â Marieâs paternal grandfather, Jan (John) Kucera came to America as a young man with his wife and son.Â The family settled in Ellinger.Â\n\nHer maternal grandparents, Andrew (Ondrey) Steffek and Veronika Michna came to the United States in 1867.Â The couple came by sailboat from Bremen, Germany to Galveston.Â\n\nFrom there they traveled by oxcart and on foot to Fayetteville.Â At the time of the journey, the Steffekâs [sic] had two small daughters, Johana and Veronika.Â Veronika was Marieâs mother.Â\n\nJohn Kucera, born in Prague, came to the United States when he was 17 years old.Â He met Veronika Steffek and married her in Ellinger.Â The couple made their home on a farm near La Grange.Â\n\nThough Mrs. Blair was a native Texan, she spoke with a noticeable Czech accent, many of her friends said.Â She began her teaching career in 1907 in Frydek, near her hometown of Ellinger, where she taught the Czech language.\n\nMrs. Blair then attended Sam Houston Normal Institute to earn a temporary teaching certificate in 1906-1909.Â Huntsville Normal Institute [Sam Houston Normal Institute] was the forerunner to Sam Houston State Teacherâs College, now Sam Houston State University.Â\n\nThe young teacher returned to Ellinger in 1909 to teach first and second graders in a school without electricity.\n\nThree years after returning to Ellinger, her mother died.Â Marie stayed on in Ellinger, helping her father to raise and teach her younger siblings.\n\nIn 1916, Mrs. Blair returned to Huntsville Normal Institute [Sam Houston Normal Institute] to earn her permanent teaching certificate.Â She was awarded her certificate in 1918.\n\nMrs. Blair and two other college students were selected to become home demonstration agents, the forerunner to extension agents.Â Her assignment as demonstration agent took her to Edna, Texas.Â\n\nIt was in Edna in early 1922 that Marie met and married Eric Lee Blair.Â Blair had been recently widowed and brought two young boys to the marriage:Â Lee and Ben, an infant.\n\nThe couple moved to Austin where Eric earned a masters degree.Â While in Austin during January, 1923, Marie had a baby girl, Rowena.\n\nBefore moving to Trinity in 1929, the couple lived for a short while in Navasota.Â Then Eric accepted the superintendentâs position in Trinity and Marie returned to teaching.\n\nMarie taught the first grade and she remembered her first class had 42 studentsâa far cry from the teacher-student ratio today.\n\nJust as the United States entered World War II, the Blairs moved to Lake Jackson. Teachers were scarce at that time.Â At age 53, Marie resumed her teaching career while Eric continued to tend to administrative duties.\n\nIn Lake Jackson, Marie expanded her expertise to include the library arts.Â In addition to being a teacher, Mrs. Blair was the school librarian for more than seven years.\n\nIn 1956, she retired from the classroom, to concentrate on full time gardening. Her hobbies also included baking bread, preserving fruits and vegetables from her garden, crocheting and sewing.\n\nMrs. Blair was able to live by herself in her house in Lake Jackson from the time her husband died in 1969 until she came to live with her daughter Rowena and son-in-law Bill McPherson in 1982.\n\nFriends and family members celebrated Mrs. Blairâs 100th birthday in 1988 with a reception at Trinity Plantation.\n\nThe funeral service for Mrs. Blair was October 19, 1992, 2 p.m., in the Chapel of Restwood Cemetery, Lake Jackson.\n\nThe original article contained a photograph of Mrs. Blair.

The fire which resulted burned the three brothers so badly that one, Frank, who was driving the car, was taken out dead, while the other two brothers, Alfred and Hugo, were burned so badly that both died a few hours later, Alfred succumbing early in the morning, and Hugo about noon.\n\nEwald Blaschke was severely burned about the legs and arms and face, but there is a chance of his recovery.\n\nThe accident, as near as we can figure it out, . . . all parties dropping off to sleep, on their return from the dance held that night at New Bielau. The explosion threw gasoline all over the car and its occupants, and their death was a horrible one. The car was completely destroyed.\n\nShortly after the accident another car came along and rendered assistance in removing the bodies of the victims and spreading the alarm. Judge W. A. VanAlstyne, local justice of the peace, was aroused and went to the scene to hold the inquest on the body of Frank Blaschke, returning a verdict in accordance with the foregoing facts.\n\nThe three young men who lost their lives in this awful accident were sons of Mr. and Mrs. Joe Blaschke of Schulenburg. The funeral of the three victims of the accident took place at Schulenburg Saturday morning at 9 o'clock.\n\nThe sympathy of everyone goes out to the bereaved parents, who in one stroke of misfortune lost their three youngest sons.\n\nBLASCHKE BROTHERS FUNERAL.\n\nTher funeral of the three brothers, Blaschkes, took place at the Schulenburg Catholic Church saturday morning in the presence of one of the largest crowds ever congregated there.

He had a wife and five children, and lived on the old Carson place, about two miles from here on the Weimar road. Last Wednesday morning he got on his horse and took his little son on another horse and went over to Clear creek, some two miles above here. The creek was very much swollen from the rain the night before, but being back water from the Navidad, he concluded he could swim it on his horse, as he wanted to cross, and put in, but missed the ford bank on the oposite side. His horse struck a steep bank, which he could not ascend and fell over backward, carrying Mr. Blaske under the water. The horse swam out, and the little boy and his horse swam out safe on the opposite side, but Mr. Blaske sank and was not seen anymore. There is no chance to get the body until the water goes down. A great many have gone up there from here, but up to Thursday morning 10 o'clock the body had not been recovered.\n\nNAVIDAD.\n\nCHARLES BLASCHKE\n\nWeimar Mercury, 19 Jun 1897, page 5\n\nCOLD BLOODED ASSASSINATION.\n\nA cold-blooded assassination was enacted in the vicinity of Dubina, about four miles northwest of Weimar, Wednesday night at about 9 o'clock. The murdered man was Charles Blaschke, an inoffensive young German farmer of that vicinity, but the name of the assassin is not known at present. Blaschke was working for his brother-in-law, Fred Manovsky, and engaged in chopping cotton. He left the farm of his brother-in-law, with his hoe upon his shoulder, after dark, en route home. Nothing further is known of his journey homeward, until he was found about 10 p.m. in the yard of a farmer name Burger, in a dying condition, with thirty-two buckshot in his body, two of the shot entering the hoe handle. He was carried to his father's home, but died ere reaching there. The place where he was fired upon is about 300 or 400 yards from the sot where he was found. Blaschke was about 24 years of age, was well-known in this section, and bore a very good reputation. An inquest was held and the verdict returned was that Blaschke came to his death at the hands of some party or parties unknown. Officers from LaGrange, Schulenburg, Holman and Weimar left for the scene early Thursday morning.\n\nLATER.âThe officers found several strong clues in their investigation of the case Thursday morning, and the result of it was that the father-on-law and brother-in-law of the deceasedâboth named Lebeda, and farmers of that vicinityâwere placed under arrest on suspicion of being the guilty parties. Their examining trial will be held at Holman today (Friday).\n\nCHARLES FRANK BLASCHKE\n\nShiner Gazette, 1 Dec 1977, page 6\n\nBlaschke Rites In Houston\n\nCharles Frank Blaschke of Houston, 81 years and 16 days, entered into eternal rest Sunday, Nov. 20, 1977 at 11:05 a.m. in a Houston nursing home.\n\nRosary was recited at 7:30 p.m. Monday by the Catholic Daughters of America at Earthman Funeral Home at the first Tidwell exit on North West Frwy.

A. Bosl, of the Schulenburg Sticker. Mrs. Bosl was in apparent good health Friday night up to 11 o'clock, when suddenly attacked with pains similar to acute indigestion. The family physician was hurriedly summoned and did all in his power to alleviate her suffering, but without avail. It was decided ot take here to the hospital at LaGrange and this was done at daybreak Saturday morning. Arriving there an operation was considered imperative and this was performed at once, but the patient never rallied, and at 11 o'clock that night â just twenty-four hours after she was first attacked â this good wife and mother breathed her last.\n\nThe remains were tenderly prepared for burial, returned to the family home at Schulenburg, and at 3 o'clock Monday afternoon were committed to mother earth in the family burial plot at Alleyton.\n\nMrs. Bosl was a lovable woman in every respect. Those who knew and loved her are unstinted in their praise of her many endearing taits of character. A devoted wife and mother, a thoughtful friend and neighbor, a lady of many accomplishments, she endeared herself to all who met her. In her passing there are many hearts deeply and inexpressibly saddened. She leaves a heart-broken husband, two little sons, besides a large number of relatives and friends.\n\nTo the bereaved husband in the loss of his beloved life companion, and to the little sons so suddenly bereft of a mother's care and love, our heartfelt sympathy goes out. May the Blessed Savior who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb be merciful to them and comfort them as He alone can.

Mrs. Bowman was a native of LaGrange.\n\nPhoto and clipping contributed by Lois Ferguson\n\nJOHN BOYD\n\nSchulenburg Sticker, 14 Jan 1909\n\nFriday morning the writer in company with Editor Theuer of the Volksfreund, and Messrs. O. B. Schwenke and A. Pennington went to LaGrange for the purpose of witnessing the the [sic] legal execution of one John Boyd, colored, for the crime of rape. Through the courtesy of Mr. Nickel, our deputy tax assessor, we were procured admission tickets. Later our affable Sheriff permitted us to visit the jail and view the victim and other prisoners, several of whom are from this city and vicinity.\n\nPromptly at 11 o’clock Deputy Sheriff O. K. Zapp stepped up to the cell occupied by Boyd and read to him the death warrant. The negro, if at all affected by the instrument, gave no outward show. Rev. William Nickles, pastor of the Methodist Episcopal church, spoke to the condemned man, recited the trials of Jesus Christ and asked him if he did not desire to make a talk or to pray. To this offer there was only a shake of the head. Sheriff Loessin, Deputy Sheriff Will Loessin Lee Smith, Dan Reiss ank [sic] O. K. Zapp than [sic] stepped into the cell and the prisoner was led to the scaffold. He walked erect and seemed more possessed than the big sheriff whose duty it was under the law to execute him. The steps of the scaffold were climbed with the same ease, and when the top was reached he took the seat at the left and awaited the command to stand upon the trap. A test of his pulse at this moment registered 84 per minute. Rev. Mr. Nickles again admonished him to make peace with hisGod [sic], and asked him if he wanted to make a brief talk to the people and asked that they lead a good life. He listened and noted the approval to the recital, but did not desire to make a statement. At 11:15 his hands and feet were tied; at 11:17 the black cap was placed over his head and one second later the body shot through the trap. The fall broke his neck At 11:19 his pulse beat 23 in 10 seconds, at 11:20 the beat was 74 per minute. The body was permitted to hang until 11:30, when the county physician declared him dead. The body was then lowered, placed in the coffin prepared for him and then carried to the colored cemetery. None of his people except one aunt came to see him.\n\nThe execution was as private as possible, a wall having been erected in the rear of the jail where the scaffold, upon which Clay Ford, a negro, was hanged for the killing of an aged negress in 1899, was built.\n\nThe rope was purchased by Sheriff Loessin eight years ago. It was to be used to hang a negro from Winchester, this county for a similar crime, but, after conviction and sentence, it was proven that the negro was only 17 years old when the offense was committed, and the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nNewspaper reporters, doctors and officers were given admission tickets. The death watch was placed on duty the first of the week, but this did not seem to trouble the criminal. In fact, he was quite unruly, and the balance of the prisoners in jail were somewhat afraid of him. One of the colored preachers of this city was admitted to Boyd’s cell and remained with him for an hour, after which the sheriff allowed him to depart. When this was done Boyd told the big sheriff that he wanted no more of such callers, nor did he solicit their advice. He further stated that he would go to hell without the damn preachers.\n\nUpon several occasions Boyd has been very unruly, and at times the jailer was compelled to use a club to subdue him. He has always been known as a worthless negro, and his demeanor since his confinement coroborates [sic] this testimony. Boyd was born and raised near Weimar in Colorado county, but as soon as he became old enough to earn a few nickels wandered about.\n\nTHE STORY OF CRIME.\n\nOn June 16, 1905, John Boyd, a negro, criminally assaulted a farmer’s wife, living six miles west from Schulenburg, in this county. The woman came to her home from the field and was approached by the negro as she came to the yard. After accomplishing his hellish purpose the black brute ran away, leaving his victim lying on the ground partly unconscious. The crime was committed during the absence of her husband, who had gone to Schulenburg to market some potatoes. After recovering consciousness the victim went to the nearest neighbor and gave the alarm. The entire citizenship of Schulenburg, Engle and Flatonia was aroused, and officers from those places and also from LaGrange and citizens began to search, the latter with the determination that has so often been demonstrated in cases of this nature. On the Friday following Marshal Eilers and Constable Williams of Schulenburg, Col. Frank Johnson and Deputy Sheriff Will Loessin of LaGrange captured the brute near Schulenburg and at once took him to the scene of his crime, where he was positively identified by his victim.\n\nThe excitement at this time was at fever heat, and threats of lynching were numerous, but the officers carried him to Schulenburg and held him at Sengelmann’s hall, with the intention of carrying him to LaGrange at a favorable opportunity. But the crowd grew rapidly in numbers and congregated to the rear of the hall, and for quite a while it seemed as though a rush would be made for the building and the brute secured. Will Loessin, the deputy sheriff, had secretly ordered a buggy and horse, requesting that the animal be tied in the front of the building. While the crowd was clamoring at the rear entrance the officer made his way to the front of the building, hurried the prisoner into the buggy and was off before the angry people knew of his intention. In fact he was five miles from town when the crowd was informed that the negro had been taken away. The negro was placed in jail, and has been there for over three years. As the crime was committed in June the brute was fed at the expense of the county until District Court met in November. On Wednesday, December 19th, Boyd was placed on trial. The first witness for the state was Mrs. B. A. Barash, the brute’s victim. She related the circumstances of the crime and held in her arms at the time of the trial a two months’ old babe. On direct examination she fully identified the negro. Upon cross examination one of the most remarkable incidents ever witnessed in a court room took place. At the request of defendant’s counsel, L. D. Brown, Mrs. Barash was removed from the court room and then the defendant, together with his counsel, retired from the court room. While out another negro changed clothes with the defendant, and together still with another negro, returned to the court room. The negro that now had on the defendant’s clothes took the seat that had been early in the trial occupied by the defendant, while the defendant took another seat next to his counsel. There was a remarkable resemblance between the two negroes and the defendant.\n\nMrs. Barash was then brought back into the court room and resumed her testimony upon cross examination. Counsel for defendant after asking many questions, suddenly asked the witness to point out the defendant. As quick as a flash the witness pointed her finger to Boyd and said “That is the man” Fifteen minutes after the case went to the jury a verdict of guilty was rendered.\n\nThe case was carried to the criminal court of appeals and the judgment of the lower court was affirmed. This occurred in May 1906. The defendant’s counsel finally took the case to the United States Supreme Court, but that tribunal dismissed it for want of jurisdiction. At the November 1908 term of the District Court Judge L. W. Moore sentenced the negro to hang on Friday January 8th, 1909.\n\nNELLIE DAWN BOYKIN\n\nWeimar Mercury, 21 Oct 1893, page 3\n\nDied, in this city, Wednesday night, october 11, 1893, at 11:45 o'clock, Nellie Dawn Boykin, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W.

Bradshaw, of the late firm of White & Bradshaw, and one of the best known men of he state, died here Thursday night at 12:10 after a lingering spell of sickness. Ever since the firm failed he has been greatly troubled and his death was brought on by dislocation of the heart. He was born in Tennessee in August, 1835, and in 1858 he came to Texas, locating in LaGrange. Soon afterward he married Miss S. E. Haynie and engaged in the general merchandise business with Mr. T. A. Hill in 1865, and in 1868 Hill sold out to J. W. White. Consequently the firm of White & Bradshaw have done business here for a number of years.\n\nMr. Bradshaw was one of the most popular men in the state and was liked and esteemed by all who knew him. He was a kind and loving father and husband. He leaves a wife and two children to mourn his death.\n\nThe funeral took place at 4:10 yesterday evening and was one of the largest ever witnessed in LaGrange.\n\nHe was a member of the Masonic order, Knights of Pythias and Knights of Honor, all of which turned out in full force. He was buried with Masonic rites.\n\nMr. Bradshaw has done more for LaGrange than any other man here and whenever a young as well as an old person needed help they did not hesitate to seek him for needs as well as advice. The familly and relatives have the deepest sympathy of the entire community.\n\nAMZI BRADSHAW\n\nWeimar Mercury, 5 Oct 1928, page 7\n\nDEATH CALLS LIFELONG CITIZEN OF LAGRANGE\n\nThursday morning at 9 o'clock Amzi Bradshaw, age 63 years, passed out of this world at his home here.

T. Bradshaw, LaGrange, died June 4.\n\nSchulenburg Sticker, 8 June 1905\n\nThe death of R. T. Bradshaw of LaGrange has caused sincere regret among our citizens. He was one of the county’s oldest citizens and was county treasurer for thirty-one years.\n\nSchulenburg Sticker, 15 June 1905\n\nDEATH OF R. T. BRADSHAW.\n\nMonday morning the sad news spread over the city that our beloved county treasurer, R. T. Bradshaw, had died at 10 o’clock the night before. His death, due to heart failure, was a great shock to our community, as many of our citizens had seen and spoken to him Sunday morning while on his way to spend a day at the farm home of B. White.\n\nMr. Bradshaw was born in Bedford county, Tennessee, on November 6, 1829, and in 1857, with his parents moved to LaGrange; started a mercantile business in this city in 1859; three years later he joined a cavalry regiment and served as a private. After the close of the Civil war he returned to this city and clerked for Carter, Wedd & Co., then for Capt. S. Alexander, and later for White & Bradshaw.\n\nIn 1872, Mr. Bradshaw was elected county treasurer, but it was not until February, 1874, before he qualified and assumed charge of the office, the former incumbent making a contest. He has filled this position of trust and honor continuously since, a period of thirty-one years â the best proof of the implicit confidence the people of old Fayette had placed in his honesty and reliability. At the time of his death, besides being county treasurer, Mr. Bradshaw was vice-president of the First National Bank of this city.\n\nIn August, 1860, he was married to Miss Anna L. Cook of this county, with three children Amzi, Mrs. B. White and Miss Mable â survive him.\n\n“Uncle Bob,” as he was familiarly known throughout the county was one of those plain, honest, upright men; a true Christian; ever popular and whose name has always been mentioned with words of praise and respect; one who was loved by his fellow man; a man of his word.\n\nThe funeral took place Tuesday morning from his late residence, and was one of the largest ever seen in this city; many citizens from different parts of the county were in attendance, which plainly showed the high esteem in which the deceased was held. Religious services were conducted by Rev. Drake of Austin of the Presbyterian church. Deceased was a member of the Masonic fraternity, the Ancient Order of United Workmen and the Knights of Pythias. In the death of Mr. Bradshaw, the city, as well as the county, losses [sic] a most valuable citizen, and the vacancy will be hard to fill. The scene at the grave was heartrending, and, as the strains of “Nearer My God to Thee,” were sung, many an eye was dimmed with tears of true sympathy. Out of respect for the deceased, all offices in the court house, as well as all business houses in the city, were closed during the time for the funeral. The pall bearers were: Lad Vanek, G. A. Stirling, J. B. Holloway, Dr. W. W. Lunn, C. H. Steinmann and B. L. Zapp.\n\nThe Journal begs to extend its heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved, and can console them only with the thought ‘tis God’s will â “Thy will be done, O, God!” â LaGrange Journal.\n\nSchulenburg Sticker, 6 July 1905\n\nDeaths Recorded Since Last Report.\n\nR.

Brady, wife of Mr. W. H. G. Brady, aged 22 years. The death of this lady was very sudden. As late as last Friday she was up and able to attend to her household duties. She was married to Mr. Brady only a few weeks ago, and to be snatched, as it were, from her loving husband and friends, in her youth, buoyant and in the hope of a life of happiness and prosperity, does seem hard to bear. But the ways of Providence are inscrutable and all should submit without murmuring to his deserves.âLa Grange Journal.\n\nBRAEUER Infant\n\nLa Grange Deutsche Zeitung, 29 Nov 1900\n\nWillow Springs, 23.

A. E. Moebus, her pastor, pay a worthy tribute and witness the placing the body to its last rest in the Trinity Hill cemetery.Â Many, not related to the deceased, will miss the kindly disposed woman who, meeting the vicissitudes of life, leaned smilingly on the staff the Savior tendered.Â As the flowers were banked high, the spontaneous thought of all formed the welcome wish:Â âMay she sleep peacefully.â\n\nMrs. Brandes, had she lived until Friday of this week, would have been 71 years of age.Â She was born at Schwaetz, Brandenburg-Preussen, Germany, October 21, 1861, she was a daughter of John G. and Bertha Kramer; as an infant she was baptized in the name of the Triune God at the Lutheran church.Â When 7 years old, He who works in a mysterious way, decreed that she be left an orphan, both of her parents joined the ever increasing majority, and she was taken under the protecting influence of her aunt and uncle.Â The rites of confirmation she received at the age of 14 years.Â And then fell to her the coldness of the hour, the compulsion to face the world and earn her own livelihood.Â Her brothers and sisters, with the exception of one, Paul Kramer, died within a few years after the demise of her parents.Â As a domestic servant she battled on until the appeal came to go to America, the land of great promise.Â Brother and sister made the sea voyage in 1884, and shortly after their arrival, Mrs. Brandes made her home in Fayette county, where she continued to live until the last summons were issued.Â Her brother died in San Antonio 30 years ago.\n\nHer pastor, Rev. A. E. Moebus, paid this merited tribute to Mrs. Brandes, a devout and faithful member of the Trinity Hill Lutheran church, 3 miles west from La Grange:Â âAt the age of 25 years she was married to Gerhard Brandes and shared joys and sorrows with him for 43 years.Â Her husband was taken ___ on the 1st of May, two years ago.Â Their union had been blessed with eleven children, three sons died in infancy:Â Paul, Eric and John.\n\nâThe sorrowing survivors are her children:Â Elfrieda, wife of C. G. Wiemken; Anna, wife of the late Herman Frerichs; Bertha, wife of Gerhard Janssen; Charlotte, wife of Alex Schroeder; Ericke, wife of Wenzil Hannisch; Mary, wife of Eric Poetschke; Felix Brandes and his wife; Hulda, wife of Will Schroeder; her sons-in-law, and 21 grandchildren.\n\nâWith the organization of the Trinity Lutheran church, the deceased and her husband became charter members.Â She was also a member of the Trinity Ladiesâ Aid since its beginning.Â The congregation thus loses a faithful member, the children a loving pious mother, all of us a kind-hearted friend. Â Our loss however, is her gain as we confidently hope.\n\nâMay she rest in peace until the glorious day of resurrection and happy reunion for all the believers in Christ Jesus, our Saviour.â\n\nContributed by Rob Brown\n\nF.
