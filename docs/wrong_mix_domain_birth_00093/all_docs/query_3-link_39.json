        "text": "Austin, Texas, is home to much more than music and drinking, it’s also the birthplace of Whole Foods Market, the massive natural-foods supermarket chain. So it seems fitting that it, too, would have a presence at this year’s South by Southwest. But that it should be with a head-turning portrait of country music hero Willie Nelson rendered in 352 pieces of toast is still somewhat surprising.\n\nThe 16-by-22-slice toast-art installation was created by Whole Foods’ production-team leader Honey Thompson in celebration of the chain’s new online magazine Dark Rye. It will be featured starting Wednesday at the “The Haus of Hipstamatic“.\n\nPHOTOS: The Music Industry’s Wildest Riders\n\nTo create the work, Thompson toasted each piece of bread individually and then used a blow torch to make the darker tones and a fork for crosshatching and fading for definition. According to a Whole Foods spokesperson, all the toast generally started off as the color of Willie’s forehead.\n\nShe added in an email, this “perfectly captures what ‘keeps Austin weird’ during this festival: music inspired food art.”"
