        "text": "John T. Floore’s Country Store is one of the best places to spend a summer night outside seeing a live concert. Located in Helotes, Texas, just outside of San Antonio, it was the closest dancehall to my hometown (just a quick hour and a half drive down the block), so I spent many weekends seeing my favorite bands at Floore’s. In addition to the big outdoor stage, Floore’s also has a smaller indoor stage and dance floor that we’ll call, um, cozy. Let’s just say that if you don’t want to faint from heat exhaustion and land on a beer-soaked dance floor, stay away from indoor shows at Floore’s during the spring and summer. It has happened to two of my friends on two separate occasions; true story. Nevertheless, no matter what season of the year it is, I love Floore’s.\n\nKnown as Willie Nelson’s musical birthplace, John T. Floore’s Country Store dates back to 1942 and it was never actually a store. In addition to the indoor and outdoor stages, Floore’s has a “Texas Café” inside. Floore’s is also one of the strictest venues that I have ever been to when it comes to being under the age of 21. Almost every time I’ve been to Floore’s, I’ve seen minors kicked out for sneaking drinks or washing off the permanent marker “X” on each hand, and minors are not allowed to go in and out of the venue. I’ve been asked to roll up my sleeves because my long-sleeved shirt and jacket covered my “UNDER 21” wristband and Xs on my hands. This has never bothered me, but here’s a heads up if you’re not 21 and planning to visit Floore’s to drink – you will not succeed.\n\nOn that note, my first trip to Floore’s in April 2008 was definitely the most comical. My dad and I were there to see Reckless Kelly (as I’ve mentioned before, my favorite band) and we were standing near the stage waiting for the show to start. A VERY intoxicated young man reeking of whiskey started chatting with us about how hard he had “pre-gamed” before the show with his friends, which was apparent from the smell of his breath. He bragged about how he was a senior in high school and was going to Yale next year, so we proceeded to ask him about his plans at Yale. The kid’s story soon changed to “maybe going to Texas State, but I’m not really sure yet.” When the concert started we stopped talking to him and forgot he was there, but not for long. About halfway through the show, he projectile vomited EVERYWHERE; all over our feet and everyone else’s feet around us. People scattered immediately and an empty circle with about a 30-foot radius formed around him. He was then taken care of in the loving arms of the police. Turns out his favorite Reckless Kelly song “Drink Your Whiskey Down” did not apply very well to him.\n\nIn my opinion, Luckenbach is the happiest place on earth. It is by far my favorite dancehall in Texas, if not one of my favorite places in Texas. The small community of Luckenbach, Texas, located just outside of Fredericksburg, is made up of the dancehall, general store/bar/old post office and blacksmith shop for a total of three buildings.\n\nLuckenbach’s history dates back to the 1850s when German immigrant families settled in the area. Hondo Crouch, one of the most beloved names in Luckenbach (he is known as the mayor and “Clown Prince of Luckenbach”), purchased the dancehall in 1970 and its fame took off from there. Most of the fathers of Texas music and outlaw country have all played (and still do) at Luckenbach. Texas music icon Jerry Jeff Walker recorded his live album “Viva Terlingua” at Luckenbach in 1973, an album my dad has been playing for me since I can remember listening to music. However, most people have heard of Luckenbach from the Waylon Jennings song “Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love).”\n\nRecorded in 1977, Waylon Jennings’ “Luckenbach Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)” topped charts and sparked Luckenbach’s nation- and worldwide fame. The song also features Willie Nelson in the last refrain.\n\nI’ve been seeing shows at Luckenbach since my first trip there with my dad in March 2008. It was also my first time to see my two favorite bands, Reckless Kelly and Micky and the Motorcars, and I got to see them play on the same night. I remember thinking after that incredible show, “I could do this every weekend of my life and never get sick of it.” Since then, live music has been something that I am unable live without. My first show is still my favorite memory of Luckenbach.\n\nOne of the more unique events I’ve attended at Luckenbach was the Texas Hat Festival in April 2010. It was a whole day of live music featuring Gary P. Nunn and Micky and the Motorcars (among many other talented bands and musicians), and, of course, hats EVERYWHERE. Hat vendors. Hat contests. Hat dances. Hat makers. You name it. Everyone, including the band members, wore their best hats.\n\nEven on a regular weekend at Luckenbach, hats are always a thing of prominence (just take a look inside the Snail Creek Hat Shop next to the outdoor stage). The variety of hats at the Texas Hat Festival proved that Luckenbach’s motto rings true – “Everybody’s somebody in Luckenbach.”\n\nIf you’re not from the central Texas area or aren’t familiar with live music venues, you’re probably reading this right now thinking, “How on earth do you pronounce Gruene?” Pronounced “green,” Gruene Hall is Texas’ oldest dancehall and is often named as everybody’s favorite dancehall. It is definitely one of mine. Located in Gruene historic district of New Braunfels, Texas, you’ll see a little bit of everything when you visit. From rowdy, river-weary college students, older couples out for a night of dancing, live music enthusiasts and tourists, it’s always a good crowd just looking to hear good music. Gruene Hall showcases the best of popular Texas country bands, western swing bands, local talent and more. Many of Texas music’s founding fathers who began playing at Gruene Hall still play there, such as Jerry Jeff Walker and Willie Nelson.\n\nMy first trip to Gruene Hall was with my dad in May 2009 to see my favorite band, Reckless Kelly. I’ve been going back at least twice a year since then. My dad, who is also an avid music fan, often tells me a story about a road trip to Gruene in the 1970s to see Jerry Jeff Walker with his buddies from UT Austin. During the show, my dad looked up and saw a possum crawling along one of the beams on the ceiling above the stage. You won’t see a possum on the ceiling during a concert today, but not much has changed about the dancehall since then. It still has that dusty old barn feel, uneven wooden floors and terribly small bathrooms. But there’s something about seeing a live show at Gruene that seems to make everybody fall in love with the place, including myself.\n\nMy most recent trip to Gruene Hall was during spring break 2013 to see Ryan Bingham with my friends, who attend Texas State University. We’ve been Ryan Bingham fans for years, but it had gotten difficult to see him after he became so popular from the 2009 film “Crazy Heart.” We finally got our chance and it was the show of a lifetime. He played all of our favorite songs and the quality of musicians in his band was outstanding (as you can see from the video posted below). I remember looking back at the crowd at one point during a song and seeing a cloud of dust rising up above our heads from all of the foot stomping on the old wooden floor. It was one of those concerts where you lose track of all time and of what’s going on around you and just become absorbed in the music and the moment. Even as I’m typing this, it sounds ridiculously stupid and cheesy, but there is honestly no other way I can think of to describe the feeling. The best part is, I get that feeling every time I see a band at Gruene Hall.\n\nRyan Bingham performing “Tell My Mother I Miss Her So” at Gruene Hall on March 13, 2013.\n\n(video: Ryan Bingham and TourGigs)\n\nAh, the Broken Spoke, one of Austin’s most famous attractions and one of Texas’ most iconic dancehalls. Having spent my childhood in the Austin area, the Spoke has been a part of my life since I was a toddler when my dad would take me to play pool and listen to the bands. The Broken Spoke is where I learned how to dance, shoot pool and properly devour a chicken fried steak. It is a place that any Austinite or tourist needs to go at least once.\n\nLocated on South Lamar Boulevard, the Broken Spoke is a true old Texas honkytonk. It is literally a museum to the tradition of real Texas country music. Since its founding in the 1960s, the Broken Spoke has seen the likes of musicians such as Bob Wills, Willie Nelson and George Strait (and that’s just to name the most well-known). Even celebrities and sports figures come to dance at the Spoke, like Clint Eastwood, Robert Duvall, Darrell K. Royal and Mack Brown, so that tells you it’s something special.\n\nIf you are expecting a glorified “country” nightclub like Cowboy’s or Wild West, you will be disappointed. The walls are covered in neon signs, Texas artifacts and dusty, signed photographs of famous visitors. The Spoke even has the Tourist Trap Room for Texas music memorabilia. Live country bands play almost every night and the jukebox is always going. On a Friday or Saturday night, you’ll have to wait in long lines just to get a drink or go to the bathroom. But it’s all worth it when you hear the band play and get out on the dance floor. Don’t know how to dance? No worries, the Broken Spoke even has dance lessons four nights a week to help out all of those with two left feet (like me!).\n\nJames White, the owner of the Broken Spoke, joins Austin country musician Dale Watson on stage at the Broken Spoke on April 11, 2009, for White’s 70th birthday party.\n\n(Video: BrokenSpokeFilms)\n\nWhile traditional country dancing is what the Spoke is mostly known for, we can’t forget about that good ‘ole chicken fried steak. It’s so good that even Willie Nelson still comes in just to eat it. If the food is good enough for Willie Nelson, it is darn good enough for me.\n\nMy most recent trip to the Broken Spoke was several years ago when my mom and I took my aunt there, who flew down from Chicago. When she comes to visit, she likes to do “Texas-y” things. So, naturally, we took her dancing at the Broken Spoke. Her preconceived notions of calendar cowboys dancing the night away were soon disproved when a much older gentleman in a cowboy hat and “all of that Texas garb” approached us to rant and complain about President Obama. Needless to say, neither my mom nor aunt wanted to dance with him after that (they’re from Chicago, remember), but they sure did give him a word about their political views. He continued to give us dirty looks all night, but it made for a funny story and didn’t keep us from having a grand time teaching my aunt how to two-step. It’s always a great night at the Broken Spoke.\n\nFor more on the Broken Spoke, check out their website.\n\nAlso see this Austin Chronicle article, “13 Things to Love About the Broken Spoke”."
