        "text": "Heart helped celebrate Monday’s solar eclipse with a special performance on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nThe Rock & Roll Hall of Famers appeared on the late night show, where they performed Bonnie Tyler’s classic “Total Eclipse of the Heart” with Jimmy, from the rooftop of 30 Rockefeller Center as the eclipse was happening.\n\n“Heart is our musical guest and today, is obviously the solar eclipse,” Jimmy shared. “So we thought we have to do what we have to do. We have to sing ‘Total Eclipse of the Heart’ with Heart while watching the solar eclipse.”\n\nIn an homage to Tyler’s video for the track, Fallon dressed like one of the school boys from the clip.\n\nAnd that wasn’t the only tune Heart performed on the show: They later treated the audience to a performance of their classic “Barracuda.”\n\nHeart is set to kick off the Royal Flush tour on April 20 in Greenville, South Carolina, with special guest Cheap Trick.

All rights reserved.\n\nDef Leppard has jumped on the viral “Of Course” TikTok trend, where folks share stereotypes about their professions, race, gender and more.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, each member of the band shares what they seem to think is an obvious fact about the group. It starts off with bassist Rick Savage, who says, “We’re Def Leppard and of course we’ve played with Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus and Queen.”\n\nThe band teamed up with Taylor for a 2008 episode of CMT Crossroads, while they preformed with Miley at the September 2022 Los Angeles tribute concert for the late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins and with Queen at the 1992 Freddie Mercury tribute concert in London.\n\nSavage was followed by guitarist Phil Collen, who shared, “Of course we play three continents in a day,” referring to their October 23, 1995, shows in Morocco, England and Canada. Drummer Rick Allen, who lost his arm in a 1985 car accident, shared a fact about himself, noting, “Of course I play drums with my feet,” while guitarist Vivian Campbell added a crack about their longevity, sharing, “Of course we’re your mother’s favorite band.”\n\nDef Leppard’s frontman, Joe Elliott, wraps up the video by noting, “We’re Def Leppard, of course, we’re playing stadiums this summer. All summer.”\n\nThat stadium tour he’s referring to is the band’s upcoming co-headlining tour with Journey, which kicks off July 6 in St. Louis. The tour also features special guests Steve Miller Band, Heart and Cheap Trick. A complete list of dates can be found at defleppard.com.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

I couldn’t agree more,” Cooper said. “Warren Zanes’ wonderful telling of this chapter in Bruce’s life is ripe for cinematic adaptation.” He notes, “This film has the potential to be a transformative cinematic experience, offering audiences a window into the soul of Bruce Springsteen and the universal truths that bind us all together.”\n\nNebraska, released on September 30, 1982, featured 10 acoustic songs Springsteen originally recorded as demos on a four-track recorder. Springsteen had planned to rerecord the songs with The E Street Band but instead opted to release it as a solo acoustic record. It featured such songs as “Atlantic City,” “Johnny 99” and “State Trooper.”\n\nDisney is the parent company of ABC News.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

Speaking to People, his ex-wife, actress Valerie Bertinelli, revealed that they ordered a pizza after the rocker passed.\n\n“I didn’t want to believe it was happening. Even while it was happening, I wasn’t believing it was happening,” Bertinelli says of the guitarist’s October 2020 death.\n\nShe says that after he passed away, the family, which included son Wolfgang Van Halen and Eddie’s brother and bandmate Alex Van Halen, decided to honor him with a meal of his favorite food.\n\n“I forget who suggested it, but we were like, ‘Should we have pizza?’ … Because he couldn’t eat, and the last thing Ed really wanted was pizza,” she says. “He loved pizza and burritos, so we had pizza in his hospital room.”\n\nShe adds, “I hope people don’t think that’s morbid.”\n\nWhile Valerie and Eddie had been divorced since 2007, she says there was still so much love between them when he died.\n\n“He knew how much I loved him,” she says. “I knew how much he loved me. The last words he said to me and to Wolfie were, ‘I love you,’” adding, “Ed was very giving with his heart. He wore it on his sleeve.”\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

It was hard for me working up to it,” Sammy writes on Instagram about his performance of “I Love This Bar.” “When I hit the stage with Toby’s wonderful band that I played with many times over the years, the audience, energy, enthusiasm, and love that filled that building (turned) every tear of sadness into joy.”\n\nHe adds, “It was a beautiful experience to say the least, so proud and honored to have been invited.”\n\nToby’s family was on hand for the tribute, which also included performances by Brooks & Dunn and Lainey Wilson. Sammy said he got to spend a few days with the family, sharing, “We all miss that bigger than life, wonderful man, Mr. Toby Keith. A.k.a. #BigDogDaddy.”\n\nToby Keith passed away in February after a two-year battle with stomach cancer.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

This stuff always makes me laugh.”\n\n“Anyway. Our new music is actually kinda reggae EDM. But with a bit of Dylan,” he adds, referring to Bob Dylan.\n\nMötley Crüe first teased they were back in the studio last April, revealing they were once again working with Dr. Feelgood producer Bob Rock. Then in December, Sixx confirmed new tunes would be out in 2024. So far, there’s no word on when exactly fans will finally hear those new tunes.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio. All rights reserved."
