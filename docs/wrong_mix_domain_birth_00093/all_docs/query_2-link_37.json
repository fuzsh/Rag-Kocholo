        "text": "But, as Josh says, “Designers and planners could never create Laurel Canyon, either in form or spirit. They could never envision ramshackle cabins, the Oedipal fury of Morrison, the extraterrestrial weirdness of Zappa, the thoughtfulness of Browne, or the bemusement of Crosby. They just cannot. But as they go about their important work, be it bureaucratic minutiae or large-scale envisioning, they should remember that places can be special — sometimes, very special.”\n\nMore than anything else, however, the response I got helped me appreciate the connection between music and place here in Houston — a city that’s somehow simultaneously a center of white blue-collar honky-tonk and earthy African-American blues.\n\nMaybe the most wonderful response to my earlier essay came from my friend Richard Johnson, the sustainability director at Rice University (and a trained urban planner). In my previous essay, I said that on my first drive from Austin to Houston, I tried to get into the Texas spirit by playing Willie Nelson — but I couldn’t do it and I found that “Born To Run” was a better connection to Houston’s energy and blue-collar dynamism.\n\nBut Richard reminded me that, in spite of the fact that I couldn’t put Willie Nelson and Houston together, Willie had put the two together in the late ’50s, when he lived in Pasadena — then the epitome of a white working-class suburb — and played regularly at the Esquire Ballroom out on Hempstead Highway. During this time he wrote “Crazy,” “Night Life” and “Funny How Time Slips Away”.\n\nAccording to Richard, the legend is that “Night Life” emerged from his nightly drives between Pasadena and the Esquire Ballroom — a distance of about 30 miles. “As a result,” he wrote to me, “I’ve always associated that song with being on the highways late at night in Houston.”"
