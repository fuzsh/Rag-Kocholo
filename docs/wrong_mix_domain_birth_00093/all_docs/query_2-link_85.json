        "text": "Today - or yesterday, depending on who you ask - is the 83rd birthday of country music legend Willie Nelson (his family says it's the 29th but the State of Texas claims it's today). He's been making music since 1956 and his songs are so ubiquitous that even folks who don't like country music can name a few. And in small towns across America, it's impossible to walk into any bar and not hear at least one version of Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys.\n\nNelson has recorded more than 68 studio albums, ten live albums, 37 compilations, two movie soundtracks and twenty-seven collaborations. And while he has lots of albums that he may credit with boosting his career, he has one that he can credit with saving it: Who'll Buy My Memories? (The I.R.S. Tapes). That album was recorded as part of an unusual settlement with the government to pay down Nelson's tax debt.\n\nNelson's tax troubles are almost as legendary as his career. After a lengthy investigation, Nelson was hit with a staggering multi-million tax bill. It was one of the largest individual federal income tax bills ever generated by the IRS at the time. The debt, which was figured to be $16.7 million together with interest and penalty, was negotiated to a mere $6 million by Nelson's lawyer, Jay Goldberg. There was just one big problem: Nelson didn't have the money to pay off the negotiated debt. So he didn't.\n\nOn November 9, 1990, the feds raided Nelson's home, taking everything he owned. Everything that is, except, Trigger. Trigger was Nelson's favorite guitar which he had his daughter, Lana, take out of his home in anticipation of the raid. \"As long as I got my guitar,\" Willie Nelson said, \"I'll be fine.\"\n\nIt turns out he was right. Nelson did lose nearly everything (except Trigger) in the raid, including his Pedernales Country Club and Recording Studio; his Dripping Springs ranch; twenty other properties in four states; and most of his instruments, recordings, and memorabilia. But it wasn't all bad: friends and fans came to the rescue, with fundraisers and efforts to buy back his property - including his home - for him.\n\nHow did Nelson get into all of this trouble in the first place? In 1984, the IRS began examining Nelson's returns. Most interesting to the IRS was a substantial deduction for tax shelter investments. The deduction was disallowed and Nelson was assessed $6 million in taxes and $10 million in interest and underpayment penalties for six years. The actual shelter which Nelson claimed was promoted by his former accounting firm, Price Waterhouse, was eventually found to be illegal (for the record, Nelson sued Price Waterhouse for $45 million for their role in his financial woes and did reach an undisclosed settlement). He was hit with another tax bill shortly thereafter which he appealed but the Tax Court ruled in favor of the IRS.\n\nBy 1990, the tax debt had nearly doubled as penalties and interest continued to accrue. Nelson wasn't making significant payments and the IRS had enough. They seized his property with intentions of putting it all up for auction. However, the IRS did have a last minute change of heart on some items, allowing posters, musical instruments, gold and platinum records and other sentimental items to be bought for a mere $7,000 by the Willie Nelson and Friends Showcase.\n\nWhen the auctions didn't make a dent in Nelson's bill, the two sides reached a rather unusual compromise: Nelson would release a compilation album and would share the proceeds with IRS. The album, called The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?, was written completely by Nelson and recorded with - what else - Nelson's trusty guitar, Trigger. It was the first (and maybe only) record album ever released under a strict revenue-sharing agreement IRS. The album, which could be purchased by dialing (800) IRS-TAPE, retailed for $19.95. Of that, about half ($9.95) went to the telemarketing company promoting the album, $1.60 covered other album-related expenses and $2.49 went to Sony Records. Nelson received $6 from the sale of each album: $3 went to IRS to pay off his existing debt, $1 went into a fund to pay for Nelson's lawsuit against Price Waterhouse (Nelson's attorney successfully argued that the proceeds of that suit might be used to pay off the tax debt) and $2 went to pay for the tax that would be generated from the sale of the album (we can't forget about that!).\n\nThe album wasn't a huge success. The telemarketing sales ploy wasn't wildly successful but sales eventually picked up once the album hit the stores. Under the agreement, the collection had to sell at least four million copies to pay down the debt. That didn't happen. The IRS only collected $3.6 million from the sales of the album. However, by that time, Nelson had settled his lawsuit with Price Waterhouse and with other projects in the works, Nelson was able to pay off his debt completely in a few years\n\nAn IRS spokesperson said about the deal at the time:\n\nWe try to work with taxpayers… And if we have to come up with some creative payment plan, that's what we're going to do, because it's in everyone's best interest.\n\nAnd it did. As for Nelson? More than twenty years later, he's as successful as ever. Not afraid to try something new, his new album, Summertime: Willie Nelson Sings Gershwin, debuted at No. 1 on both the Traditional Jazz Albums and overall Jazz Albums charts in March, the same month that he made an appearance on ABC's \"The Muppets.\"\n\nNext month, he'll release The Highwaymen Live – American Outlaws, a box set of performances from a previously unreleased concert film with The Highwaymen (Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, and Kris Kristofferson) recorded live at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., in 1990. He has his own radio station on Sirius Radio (Willie's Roadhouse, Channel 59). And yes, he's still touring.\n\nIn addition to his music, Nelson has launched his own marijuana company, \"Willie's Reserve,\" grown and sold by local businesses in states like Colorado, where marijuana is legal. He joked to Rolling Stone at the time, \"I feel like I was buying so much of it, it's time to start selling it back!\"\n\nThroughout his 83 years, Nelson has remained philosophical about his trials, saying, \"There are more serious problems in life than financial ones, and I've had a lot of those. I've been broke before, and will be again.\""
