The ongoing work constantly brings to the fore the dynamics of oral presentations, live dialogue, and creative exchange of views around historical, political, social, cultural and educational issues.\n\nThe project is a synergy of the Society of Studies, EKOME and the Contemporary Social History Archives (ASKI).\n\nConsistent with its mission to preserve and promote our national audiovisual heritage with the consent of the owner of the archival collection, EKOME shares with the public the priceless audio archive of the Society of Studies.\n\nThe following excerpts were recorded during the Symposium “Greece of the ’40s”, organized by the Society of Studies on 19 & 20 April 1991.\n\nListen (in Greek) to the rare testimonies of painter Andreas Vourloumis, military postman Dimitris Margaris, the playwright/director Alekos Sakellarios and musician/singer Danae Stratigopoulou.\n\nAndreas Vourloumis ✅https://vimeo.com/470947216\n\nDimitris Margaris ✅https://vimeo.com/470946865\n\nAlekos Sakellarios ✅ https://vimeo.com/470945649"
