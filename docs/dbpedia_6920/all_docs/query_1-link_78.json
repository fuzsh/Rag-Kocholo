The history of Greek literature is coextensive with the history of the Greek language, and language is the main field in which the collective memory, the constitution and the self-image of a community are asserted. The National Book Centre has brought together the wealth, the immense variety and the unbroken continuity of Greek literature in this special volume to mark the 2001 Frankfurt Book Fair, where Greece was the Guest of Honour.\n\nThe first part of this paper is a concise outline of some of the ways in which modern Greek literature has entered into a dialogue with Greek history and the past from the nineteenth century to the present by idealizing, Hellenizing, suppressing, inventing, negotiating, critiquing, or reinterpreting and re-inventing them. Along these lines, the paper weaves together different literary, ideological , and historical threads which help the readers realize that the topics examined by the ensuing papers of this Special Issue do not emerge out of a vacuum, but instead constitute responses to-or have been prompted by-concrete developments in the realms of modern Greek literature, ideology, and history. The second part of the paper delineates the Special Issue's specific focus, scope, aims, approach and methodology, while summarizing the main arguments and contributions of each of the individual papers.\n\nThis thesis examines the emergence and development of Greek ‘autofiction’ from 1971 until 1995, through the selected works of six writers: Kostas Tachtsis, Melpo Axioti, Vassilis Vassilikos, Vassilis Alexakis, Yiannis Kiourtsakis and Michel Fais. The aim of my dissertation is to put forward a term for the study of texts that have been vaguely labelled by Greek criticism as ‘autobiographical’ by introducing the French term 'autofiction'.\n\nEVEN THE MOST OBSCURE GREEK POET today considers himself to be a member of the same literary and linguistic community as Homer. The history of Greek literature is coextensive with the history of the Greek language, and language is the main field in which the collective memory, the constitution and the self-image of a community are asserted. The National Book Centre has brought together the wealth, the immense variety and the unbroken continuity of Greek literature in this special volume to mark the 2001 Frankfurt Book Fair, where Greece was the Guest of Honour."
