        "text": "If a “great composer” is measured by the number of songs he wrote that remained eternal, it seems to me that in Greek music the three greatest are Vassilis Tsitsanis, Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hatzidakis. Regarding Hatzidakis, I think that he has left a great mark also on the entire world, mainly because of his international “ambassadors”, the singers Melina Mercouri, Nana Moushouri and also Maria Farandouri.\n\nMaking a reasonably sized playlist of his songs is not an easy task as there are dozens of important worthy wonderful songs. I decided to choose the 26 songs that I loved most in the last decades.\n\nI would like to dedicate song no. 16 “Lullaby” (Νανούρισμα) with love and many thanks to my friend Katerina Siapanda-Κατερίνα Σιάπαντα, a great singer, who loves this song very much, and who gave me so much knowledge in Greek music!\n\nI chose to end the playlist with Chava Alberstein’s “Ending Song” in Hebrew lyrics by N. Shemer, to Hatzidakis’ “Dedication”.\n\n!I hope you enjoy the songs\n\nAvi\n\nList of songs:"
