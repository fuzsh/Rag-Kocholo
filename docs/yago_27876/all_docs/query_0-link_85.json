        "text": "Introduction\n\nOn 21 May every year, a small crowd gathers at the Tower of London. They are not the usual tourists, waiting to hear the lurid tales about escapes, executions and jewels, before heading off to take photographs and buy souvenirs. This group has the look of connoisseurs as it makes for the southern section of the Tower of London, close where the Thames rushes under Traitor’s Gate, and enters the squat, circular Wakefield Tower. Students from Eton School and King’s College, Cambridge, come forward to place lilies from Eton and roses from King’s on the floor in remembrance of their founder. Huddled inside an octagonal room, off which an ornate little painted chapel stands, the choir sings as the last rays of the sun slant in through the large windows. The annual Ceremony of the Lilies and Roses is a small, gentle, but defiant, act of remembrance for the Lancastrian, Henry VI, who was murdered there on that date in 1471, or very soon afterwards. The first ceremony was held in 1923, when a plaque commemorating the king was placed in the floor and marked with a bunch of lilies. The roses followed in 1947. Symbolic of his inheritance, of the struggle between two countries and of his marriage, the flowers lying together on the tiles give little indication of the turbulent relationship between England and France, or the union between its representatives, Henry and Margaret of Anjou. It is a suitable, fitting memorial for a king whose gentle, pious character was at odds with the military and merciless demands of medieval kingship, who struggled to model strong leadership with differing degrees of success, plagued by the little-understood issues of poor mental health.\n\nHenry VI has been described by modern historians in ways as damning as a nadir of the English monarchy or ‘an incompetent innocent’.¹ He has inspired frustration and sympathy in equal measure as a man uniquely unsuited to the role into which he was born, a role which was inescapable, a role which gave him responsibility for the smooth running of the country and the welfare of his people. Bernard Wolffe has delivered the hard-hitting truths that Henry mismanaged the economy and was a capricious, bad decision-maker, whose character proved key to his own failure, ² but this approach has not met with widespread approval, being rejected by Christine Carpenter as being ‘almost deliberately provocative’.³ R. A. Griffiths and James Ross take a gentler, more empathetic approach, with the latter asserting that it is hard not to feel sympathy for Henry, a man who was admired as pious by his subjects, but who had very different priorities and who only occasionally engaged in politics. However, not all Henry’s subjects were so admiring; Abbot John Whethampsted described Henry as ‘his mother’s stupid offspring, not his father’s, a son greatly degenerated from the father, who did not cultivate the art of war’, ⁴ and John Neville repeatedly calling him a ‘puppet’. John Watts presents a Henry who was unable to assert his individual kingship for the benefit of his people, but his is a broadly sympathetic picture of a passive figure, a vacuum at the heart of government, while the most recent study of the king, by David Grummitt, explores a complex figure whose longevity and hold on power continues to fascinate.\n\nIn the decades after his death, a cult sprung up around Henry, as he reputedly cured the sick, rescued those in danger and even brought the dead back to life. The efforts of his nephew, Henry VII, to get him canonised may have owed more to politics than faith, but his reputation at that time speaks volumes about the affection in which he was held, and implies recognition of the discrepancy between his nature and the demands of kingship. Although he may have mismanaged events, the suffering he endured during his reign was interpreted as divine will, a test of adversity in order to prove his faith. Henry’s was essentially a localised cult, centered upon his bones at Chertsey Abbey, then at Windsor, with pilgrim badges being made in the city over a span of around three decades. Only Canterbury produced more surviving pilgrims’ badges, yet that represents the output of three centuries, and in the last years of the fifteenth century, Henry rivalled Thomas Becket as the nation’s favoured saint. Yet there were representations of the unfortunate king all round the country, in East Anglia, Devon, Hampshire, Northumberland, and a notable surviving portrait on the rood screen at St Michael’s, at Barton Turf in Norfolk. Historian John W. McKenna asserts that the cult is not plausible because Henry was considered unkingly by his contemporaries; his reputation was manipulated later by others whom it suited politically. Simon Walker agrees on the political nature of the cult, but considered Henry a saint, who died because of the opposing ruling faction; their use of his saintliness helped to restore balance afterwards, and make a degree of reparations for the turbulence of the Wars of the Roses.\n\nHistorians are equally polarised when it comes to Henry’s wife, Margaret of Anjou, but for very different reasons. When Margaret came to England to be married, in 1445, she was 15, French, and female; three things that immediately posed a challenge in a xenophobic country, making her an alien, an enemy and a figure to be managed by those in charge of the young king rather than to be given a voice. Raised in a country torn apart by dynastic struggles, she already understood the nature of factional politics and the importance of strong women who were able to step into their husband’s shoes and rule, campaign, or even fight, during their illness or absence. Just as mid-fifteenth century England was unprepared for a king who modelled a different kind of masculinity, neither was it ready for a queen who refused to conform to the expected back-seat ideal of passive, fertile mercy. A contemporary addressed the unusual character– gender division in the marriage with the quip that all would have been well if only Margaret had been king and Henry had been queen. But their world was only of inflexible boundaries, unable to accept the fluidity of such a solution. After Shakespeare’s depiction of Margaret as a she-wolf, the resulting attitude of blame and derision towards the French queen became entrenched, as it was repeated by historian after historian. The familiar vision of her as ‘foreigner, white devil, shrew, virago, vengeful fury’, ⁵ upon which were compounded images of extreme cruelty and barbarism, have obstructed more balanced interpretations. Until relatively recently, there has been little recognition that she deserved ‘credit for taking on an impossible job’, as Christine Carpenter commented.\n\nMargaret’s contemporaries were in no doubt about her strength and influence. Gregory’s chronicle states that all the lords knew that ‘all the workings that were done grew by her’ because she was ‘far wittier [cleverer] than the king’. The Milanese ambassador considered her ‘wise and charitable’, Louis XI saw her as ‘bold’ and, most famously, is John Bocking’s comment that she was a ‘great and strong laboured woman’ who spared ‘no pain to [pur]sue her things to an intent and conclusion to her power’. In the generation following her death, Margaret was considered by Polydore Vergil to be ‘a young lady exceeding others of her time’ but who displayed ‘manly qualities’ in her determination to ‘take upon herself’ the governance of the realm. This was echoed by Edward Hall, who initially considered her ‘a manly woman’, unwilling to be governed by others – meaning men – progressing to insults such as ‘cankered crocodile and subtle serpent’. The History of the Memorable and Extraordinary Calamities of Margaret of Anjou, written by Michel Baudier in the early seventeenth century and published in London in 1773, establishes a tone of doom before the text starts, swiftly followed by the introduction of ‘the miseries of life’ and the great height from which royalty may fall. Despite the interference of hindsight, Baudier allows Margaret to have been possessed of admirable qualities, including ‘an excellent understanding, sagacity and prudence’, consideration, diligence and beauty. Late Victorian sympathy for Margaret is evident in the romanticised version of her life written by Mary Ann Hookham and that of Jacob Abbott, who described her as a heroine, not of romance and fiction, but of ‘stern and terrible reality’, and J. Bagley’s 1948 account presents her as a ‘brave and determined champion’ but lacking in wisdom and understanding of her situation. More recently, Anne Crawford has emphasised the female models from Margaret’s childhood, Patricia-Ann Lee has deconstructed the Tudor male gaze when it comes to Margaret’s reputation and Diana Dunn has unpicked the effects of Tudor propaganda upon her queenship prior to 1453. Helen E. Maurer’s study of 2003 presents a more balanced picture of the queen, recognising the complications of nationality and gender as she tried to provide the country with the stability her husband could not offer.\n\nLittle attention has been given to Henry and Margaret as a pair, in terms of their marriage, their life together and their joint rule. This is partly because less evidence survives about their intimate relationship, leading it to be reduced to a few simple anecdotes about Margaret being already a woman at the time of her marriage and Henry’s reputed prudery. For all the efforts of their enemies to discredit the couple, nothing suggests there were any instances of disharmony between them or lack of respect, other than the typical slurs about Margaret conceiving Prince Edward in adultery, which was the usual weapon of choice against aristocratic women and their heirs. Contemporary and subsequent historians have exploited a far more subtle relationship dynamic to undermine Henry and Margaret as individuals, as a couple and as rulers, by playing on fifteenth-century gender expectations. With qualities of action, ambition and political influence considered to be ‘masculine’, and mercy, gentleness and peace classed as ‘feminine’, the reversal of these attributes created a confusion of identities that gave the Lancastrian’s enemies rich food for criticism. Thus, Margaret was a ‘masculine’ woman and Henry, as a man displaying ‘feminine’ qualities, attracted accusations of weakness, passivity and being easily controlled. Almost six hundred years after Henry’s birth, the time is right for a reappraisal of their lives and marriage, which has no need to adhere to strict cultural codes about gender, but can use them as a starting point to deconstruct the identities of two atypical individuals.\n\nAmy Licence\n\nCanterbury, October 2017\n\nPrologue\n\nIn the summer of 1422, farmers across France were hoping for good weather. From the lush green fields of Champagne to the meadows of the Auvergne and the warm, fertile rolling hills of Provence, it was time to make hay and begin the harvest. They shaded their eyes and looked into the distance, watching the horizon for the shadows that would foretell the arrival of rain, or the ripple of marching men in an approaching army. There was both comfort and struggle in the cycle of the year. Along with the church calendar summoning them to pray and observe the feasts of saints, the agricultural routine urged farmers to action; to plough and sow, to winnow and reap. Survival that winter might depend upon the harvest, and 1422 had proved to be a particularly hot, dry summer. ¹ Monstrelet’s chronicle reminds us of the plight ‘of the poor commonality and labourers of France’, who declared that ‘no corn in our granary is stored’ and that, in contrast with the wine on the tables of the rich, ‘no vintage cheers our heavy hearts’. ² As August gave way to September, as the crops were being cut and gathered, those who farmed along the Seine between Paris and Rouen, or near the stretch of land that hugged the coast north up to Calais, paused their labours to watch as the most extraordinary procession passed along the dry roads, between the poplar trees and the waving wheat.\n\nThe King of England was dead. Having made a searing impact upon France by driving its archers into the mud at Agincourt, Henry V had laid siege to Dreux, then to Meaux, bombarding their walls with cannon and undermining them with tunnels. Just three months earlier, he had been banqueting in the Louvre Palace, ‘gorgeously apparelled’ and crowned in his ‘most precious diadems’, which the whole of Paris had turned out to see. At his side was his young wife Catherine, the beautiful princess of France, whose marriage was set to unite the two countries and put an end to their decades of war. By the treaty of Troyes, Henry was named as the heir to the Valois king, Charles VI, instead of his son, the dauphin Charles, then a rebellious youth of 17. Yet Meaux had proved to be a pyrrhic victory. Even while Henry was feasting at the Louvre, in anticipation of his French inheritance, the deadly bacteria were spreading through his intestines. On 31 August, between 2 and 3 in the morning, he died an agonising death from dysentery, contracted among the terrible conditions at Meaux. The chronicler Thomas Basin saw the hand of justice in this event, claiming that Henry had been struck down by the illness known as ‘St Fiacre’s evil’ because he had allowed his troops to sack a chapel near Meaux dedicated to the saint. Yet this faith in divine retribution could not interfere with the signatures made at Troyes. According to the terms of the treaty, the crowns of France and England passed to Henry’s son, a 10-month-old baby left behind in England, whom Henry had never seen.\n\nThe body of Henry V was prepared in line with contemporary practice. He was the first English king to die outside his country since Richard I in 1199, and he had to return home. In preparation for the long journey back to Westminster, the king’s entrails were removed and buried at the church of Saint-Maur-desFossés, and the flesh was separated from his bones, in order for the remains to survive. One source, though, suggests that Henry’s body was already so consumed by disease that he required little more than to be embalmed, wrapped, encased in lead and placed in a wooden coffin, which was then put in a larger one of lead.³ The coffin was taken ‘in great funeral pomp’, attended by English princes, Henry’s household and a ‘multitude of other people’, on a journey of five miles from Vincennes into the centre of Paris. The coffin was placed within a car drawn by four horses, and was topped by a life-sized effigy of Henry, made of boiled leather, painted to appear lifelike, wearing a gold crown and carrying an orb and sceptre. At the Cathedral of Nôtre-Dame, where the English and French nobility had gathered, a solemn service was performed, and Catherine of Valois was brought ‘in great state’ from the countryside, where she had been ‘kept in ignorance [of] how dangerously ill the king was’ and ‘knew not of his death’ until after the event.⁴\n\nFrom Paris, the body was carried through the countryside to Rouen. Farmers working the fields of the Loire valley and Normandy witnessed the passing of a long, slow cavalcade of mourners. In their midst, the effigy stared up at the heavens, and the autumn sunshine might have caught the vermilion covering on which it lay, interwoven with beaten gold. Whenever the procession passed through a town, a canopy of silk was carried above the king and the flags of St George, France and England flew amid the Norman fields. Mass was celebrated in each church in which they stopped along the route. At Rouen, the coffin rested in the cathedral, surrounded by torches, awaiting the arrival of Queen Catherine, who reached the city on 24 September, accompanied by eighteen carts of Henry’s possessions and four of her own, draped in black. The entourage remained there until 8 October, before moving on seventy miles north-east to Abbeville, where the body was placed in the church of St Ulfran (Wulfram) and rows of priests on either side of his body sung masses for Henry’s soul from dawn until noon. From there, they travelled on to Hesdin, before veering sharp west to Montreuil and Boulogne, thus avoiding the famous field of Agincourt, with the queen and her ‘numerous attendants’ going at a slower pace, about a league behind the corpse. They must have arrived at Calais around the time of Catherine’s twenty-first birthday, which fell on 27 October. A fleet of English ships awaited them.\n\nThe ship carrying Henry’s body sailed into port at Dover on 31 October 1422. The first of a series of hearses was awaiting him, to transport him to Canterbury, Ospringe, Rochester, Dartford and, finally, into London. On 5 November, the bishops, abbots, clergymen, mayor and aldermen came out to meet the procession as it passed over London Bridge, through the freshly cleaned streets, the civic dignitaries dressed in black, and the guildsmen all clad in white, bearing burning torches. The coffin rested in St Paul’s overnight before making its final journey to Westminster Abbey. The king was interred on 7 November, with his coffin drawn up to the nave by four horses and ‘greater pomp and expenses were made than had been done for two hundred years at the interment of any king of England’.⁵ Thus Henry V, Prince Hal, the survivor of Shrewsbury, victor of Agincourt, conqueror and heir to the throne of France, was laid to rest at the age of 35, long before he had had an opportunity to fulfil his potential. As his story came to an end, another was beginning. The new king of England was a baby, unable to feed or dress itself, even to speak yet, perhaps not even to survive the dangers of infancy. The future, which had seemed so certain, was now called into question.\n\nChapter One\n\nHenry 1421–1444\n\nI\n\nThe most famous of all medieval illuminations was created just a few years before the birth of Henry VI. Depicting the labours of the months of the year, the Très Riches Heures de Duc de Berri was illustrated between 1412 and 1416, in dazzlingly bright blues, reds and golds on calfskin, all watched over by the twelve zodiac signs moving through the arc of the heavens. January represents a splendid feast, where the duke in flowing robes sits behind a table laden with food; in March, a golden dragon flies above the white-walled Chateau, while April is devoted to the pursuits of love. In May, young aristocrats dress in the latest fashions to ride to the sound of trumpets, they hunt with falcons in August and chase the boar to its death in December. Reproduced on modern calendars and postcards, their gothic castles and stylised scenes represent an idealised glimpse into the romance of medieval life, six centuries ago, a simulacrum that fuels fiction, a misleading idyll, a fairy tale.\n\nAnd yet, the labours of the months depicts a second narrative too. In the depths of the February snow, one peasant chops wood while another drives an ass to market; in March they sow the fields; in the summer months they harvest and shear the sheep; September sees them picking the grapes; in October they plough and till, while November has them watching the pigs, fattening them with acorns ahead of the traditional Martinmas slaughter. But the pigs don’t die in the pretty woodland scene, with its exquisite clump of trees, each leaf lovingly delineated. They will be slaughtered elsewhere, in order to furnish the duke’s table. The Très Riches Heures is a reminder that the world in 1421 encompassed extremes of wealth and poverty, of dazzling castles full of cupboards of gold plate and wooden hovels where clothes hang from the walls to dry. There are labourers in plain, torn garments, giving a bawdy glimpse of the thigh or the buttocks, and women in immaculate white wimples, trailing gold ornament. A golden-haired lady with feathers in her hat receives a ring from a lover while a heavily pregnant grape-picker pauses for a moment amid her work. Rich and poor live side by side, both dependent upon the land, both certain of their place in the world and the relative freshness of their linen.\n\nPerhaps the most significant aspect of medieval life is conspicuously absent from the labours of the months. However, the Catholic faith suffuses the rest of the Très Riches Heures, implicit in its very name. The labours comprise only a small percentage of the text, while the remainder is made up of prayers and reflections, intended to be read at times of the canonical hours, which were the daily times designated by the church for worship. Containing psalms, readings, prayers and masses, the theme of the manuscript is the powerful faith that provided the framework for the secular lives of all classes, from castle-dwellers to the field-workers. The churches of England and France were the largest landowners after the crown and wielded significant political influence. Religious belief and practices were never far away, underpinning the structure of each day and the thinking of Henry and his contemporaries. Thus, life in the 1420s, when Henry was born, was defined by religion and duty, leisure and pleasure, within the context of the social hierarchy and the church.\n\nIn demographic terms, 1420 was a year of transition. England and France had been through a devastating period of plague, revolt and famine, decimating the population and emptying villages. Estimates at population have offered figures for England of 3 million and France of 14 million in 1400, which were equal, or less, to what they had been a century before.¹ By the time of Henry’s birth however, the tide was starting to turn. His father’s successes in France had contributed to a sense of national identity and pride, the flourishing wool industry created new wealth and population began to climb. Less than a fifth of English people lived in a town, perhaps even as few as only ten per cent, but the country’s infrastructure began to grow following the investment of a new gentry class. New churches sprung up across Suffolk and Norfolk, decorated in the gothic style, dwarfing the scattering of households they were intended to serve. Fortunes were made in trade and money lending, with perhaps the most famous example being London’s mayor, Richard ‘Dick’ Whittington, who served his fourth and final term in 1419–20. He founded a library at London’s Guildhall, a hospital for illegitimate births, fresh public drinking fountains and public toilets, before leaving the equivalent of £3 million in his will to charity. London’s livery companies flourished, raised imposing new buildings in which to conduct their business and received royal charters. Although many of the old dangers still lurked on the horizon, a cautious new sense of optimism began to be felt in the corridors of Westminster Palace and among the farmers’ ridges and furrows.\n\nHenry VI was born at Windsor Castle on 6 December 1421. Built of sturdy grey stone, it had been remodelled by Edward III, using money from his success in the wars against France. He had created three courts, new gateways, a chapel and hall with large windows, luxurious royal apartments and a mechanical clock, totalling over £50,000² of work over two decades prior to Edward’s death in 1377, more than was spent on any other building by any medieval king.³ Further work and modernisation had taken place under his son, Richard II, making Windsor the most advanced, comfortable castle of its age. Catherine of Valois, who was used to the Parisian splendour of the Louvre and Hôtel St Pol, chose it as her residence and delivered her son there.\n\nHenry arrived on the feast day of St Nicholas, a date associated with gift-giving and the election of ‘boy-bishops’, when a child was chosen from among the choristers to enact a parody of real ecclesiastical duties, inverting the usual order of age and experience. Yet this was not just a humorous custom. By association, Henry’s birthdate marked both generosity and the exaltation of the humble and meek over the mighty. John Capgrave, the Norfolk historian, who was a teacher of 28 in 1421, saw a divine significance in the day of Henry’s arrival, considering that it was ‘not without a reason that certain great men have herded together on certain days of greater desert than others’. He added that it was also the month in which the ‘Blessed Virgin was conceived’ and ‘the Saviour of the World was born’, drawing the conclusion that ‘he who is born at a holy season may imitate His holy life’. Capgrave also commented that Henry had taken after St Nicholas, as both men lived restrained, abstemious lives and had remained dignified when raised to power.⁴ Henry was probably christened in the chapel at Windsor, with his uncles Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester and John, Duke of Bedford as godfathers and his aunt by marriage, Jacqueline, Duchess of Hainault, as godmother. Only the fourth godparent, Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury, was unrelated to the baby.⁵\n\nHenry was quickly established in his own nursery, independent of his mother. Payments recorded in the Patent Rolls tell us that his main nurse was a Joan Astley, or Asteley, whose husband Thomas was also in royal service. As the recipient of £20 a year, Joan was clearly more important than Matilda Foebroke, his day-nurse who received £10, or Agnes Jakeman and Margaret Brotherham, both described as ‘chamberer and laundress’, at salaries of 100s a year.⁶ Henry remained in the care of his nurses until the end of April 1423, by which time he was 16 months old, and probably beginning to walk. The following month he was reported to be ‘in perfect health’⁷ and when Joan Asteley relinquished her role, her annuity doubled to £40 as a reward.⁸ Her place in the boy’s household was taken by a Dame Alice Butler, or Botiller, an expert on ‘courtesy and nature’, who would have been Henry’s first teacher and advised on the spending of his household’s budget.⁹ By the end of 1426, at the time of Henry’s fifth birthday, her role came to an end, and she was granted 50 marks a year for life.¹⁰\n\nIn a significant move that marked the end of Henry’s babyhood, Alice Butler’s replacement was male. On 1 June 1428, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Anjou of Warwick, was appointed as the young king’s guardian, at a salary of 250 marks. Beauchamp was then aged 46 and already had years of distinguished royal service behind him. His father, Thomas, had been governor to the boy-king Richard II, a relationship that influenced the choice of the king as young Beauchamp’s godfather, back in 1382. As a young man, he had fought alongside the future Henry V at the decisive Battle of Shrewsbury, defeating the Welsh and being created a Knight of the Garter. He had continued to serve Henry after his accession as king in 1413, acting as Lord High Steward at his coronation, serving on the royal council, fighting alongside Henry in French sieges, becoming Captain of Calais and Master of the Horse.
