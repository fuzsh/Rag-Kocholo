        "text": "On the 22nd of April 1445 history was made in a small coastal village when a fifteen-year old French girl married a 23-year old English boy called Henry. It just so happened that the boy was Henry VI King of England and the girl was Margaret of Anjou who would over time become one of the most notorious players in the Wars of the Roses.\n\nHenry VI came to the English throne at just 9 months old, after his father Henry V died suddenly in 1422. He gained the throne during the Hundred Years War period which saw a series of conflicts between England and France over the English monarch’s right to rule in France. Upon the death of Henry’s maternal grandfather Charles VI of France, Henry disputedly succeeded the French throne alongside that of England and in 1431 he was coronated in Paris, the only English monarch to have achieved this feat.\n\nMargaret of Anjou was born on 23 March 1430 in Pont-a-Mousson, to Isabella of Lorraine and Rene of Anjou. Through her father’s side Margaret was the niece of the French King Charles VII, but despite this royal connection Margaret was in possession of a relatively small dowry of 20,000 francs. During her childhood, Margaret’s father had spent his time pursuing titles and subsequently spent time in and out of jail ultimately leaving him bankrupt.\n\nWhen Henry VI was looking for a Queen in the 1440s the end to the hundred years war seemed to be nowhere in sight, it is therefore not surprising that Henry and his advisors looked to France for a wife with the hope that a successful connection could renew diplomacy between the two nations. Therefore, despite Margaret’s unfortunate economic circumstances, William 4th Earl of Suffolk saw benefit in a match between the English King and French noblewoman and set plans in motion for the wedding to occur. The marriage settlement was agreed upon and included a 23-month truce between the two sides and on 24 May 1444, the couple were formally betrothed in Tours with Margaret herself present and Suffolk standing in as proxy for the English King.\n\nAccompanied by Suffolk, Margaret began her trip to England on 2 March 1445, in Pontoise Margaret was received by Richard, Duke of York, who joined the party in accompanying the young woman on her trip across the channel. The party then travelled by boat along the River Seine to the city of Rouen which was at the time under British rule. For almost two weeks the party stayed in Rouen, it is unclear why there was such a delay although smallpox had been rife in 1440s France and it is possible that Margaret came down with the illness.\n\nAt Harfleur the party boarded a ship called the Cog or Cock John of Cherbourg on 3 April and undertook the perilous journey across the channel. The trip took seven days and was very stormy, Margaret who was probably still not recovered from the bout of illness she faced in Rouen faired particularly badly on the trip and was “sick of the labour and indisposition of the sea, by the occasion of which the pokes has broken out upon her”. Her suffering was allegedly so bad that upon arrival in England Margaret had to be carried to shore by Suffolk.\n\nThe following day when the weather had somewhat calmed the decision was made for the party to be conveyed along the Solent from Portchester to Southampton. In Southampton she was taken to a convent in order to rest and recuperate in preparation for her marriage, by this point the worst of Margaret’s illness must have been over as it is known that she received a “tyremaker” (dressmaker) sent by Henry as part of final wedding preparations.\n\nOn the 22 April 1445, the long awaited wedding ceremony finally took place. Henry had been waiting in nearby Southwick for his bride to recover and so the pair met at Titchfield Abbey on the south coast. The abbey was home to a brotherhood of Premonstratensian canons famous for living austere and scholarly lives. Titchfield Abbey was likely chosen for its close proximity to Margaret’s landing place in Southampton as it was a good stopping place on the way to London, indeed Henry’s own father Henry V is known to have stopped off at the Abbey on his way to battle. The quiet location of the abbey also would have given Margaret the opportunity to continue her recuperation in preparation for the onward journey to London and the huge celebration planned for her forthcoming coronation.\n\nThe wedding ceremony was performed by William Ayscough, Bishop of Salisbury, and Henry’s confessor. Margaret’s wedding band was a ‘ryng of gold, garnished with a fayr rubie’, perhaps as a nod to Margaret’s French heritage Henry had it remoulded from the ring, he himself wore during his coronation as King of France. Another unusual gift Margaret was said to have received as a wedding present was a Lion, it is not known who this gift was from, but it is likely the animal ended up as part of a growing menagerie at the Tower of London.\n\nNot much is known about the ins and outs of the marriage, but Margaret stood by her husband through allegations of madness and the entirety of the Wars of the Roses. In 1453 Margaret produced an heir Edward, Prince of Wales. The marriage came to a sorry end in 1471 though, Henry was imprisoned in the Tower of London by Yorkist enemies and in mysterious circumstances died shortly after. Margaret eventually made it back to France and ended her days relying on the kindness of distant relatives she barely knew.\n\nUnfortunately, the abbey no longer appears in the state it would have done at the time of Margaret and Henry’s wedding. After Henry VIII’s Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537 a large gatehouse was built to cover the nave of the monastic church and this is the main feature of what remains today.\n\nNot far from Titchfield Abbey there is a bridge known as ‘Stony Bridge’, it is a road bridge spanning the River Meon giving access between the abbey and the historic village of Catisfield. While the bridge is now made of stone having been rebuilt in 16th-century by Henry Wriothsley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, antiquarian John Leland reports that when he crossed the bridge in 1542 it was wooden. The bridge is also known as Anjou bridge and has associations with the wedding of Henry and Margaret, presenting the possibility that the bridge was built for the purpose of helping the wedding party cross the River Meon.\n\nIn 1447, in recognition of the important role Titchfield Abbey played at the time of his marriage, Henry granted the abbey various liberties. The abbey no longer had to pay fines to the King and significantly was given a royal grant to establish an annual fair in Titchfield to be held for four days a year from Corpus Christi Day.\n\nBibliography and Further Reading\n\nCastor, H., She-Wolves: The Women Who Ruled England before Elizabeth (London, 2010).\n\nEllis, H.
