        "text": "Post by stevep on\n\nI am wondering, although I am not really familiar with Margaret of Anjou, I only know her as the wife of Henry VI of England. What would the ramifications be if Margaret of Anjou had married into the House of Stuart or some other Scottish noble house, with the former resulting in her becoming Queen of Scotland instead of Queen of England?\n\nShe seems to have been the dominant figure in her marriage to Henry VI so she could be a powerful figure in Scotland, which might however backfire - a strong foreign woman being seen as too powerful could become unpopular - but I don't know enough about Scottish history to tell.\n\nOf course without her as queen in England who does Henry VI marry and how does that affect things? She was a significant figure and the driving element in the Lancastrian side in the War of the Roses but then since her hostility to the Duke of York was a factor in triggering the conflict. Possibly an alternative queen means it doesn't occur. In which case what happens with England? Is it fairly quiet under a weak and indecisive, possibly also mentally unstable Henry VI or does this mean there is the wealth and manpower available for foreign adventures, either possibly in Scotland or Ireland or seeking to revive the claim to the French throne?\n\nPost by stevep on\n\nI would think that an additional time that it took for the Wars of Roses to take place would have been invested better in the subjugation of Ireland, although at the same time, the Scots are also a major security issue that England itself had to deal with. On the topic of Scotland, it would depend on who Margaret of Anjou marries. If it was OTL James II of Scotland, then nothing much changes, except that future Stuart offspring will have the bloodline of the House of Anjou, instead of claiming descent from Philip the Good of Burgundy. A different bride for Henry VI wouldn't change much, other than the Yorkists wouldn't become prominent. Alternatively, we might have a different version of the Wars of Roses.....in Scotland instead, with the Stuarts against the Douglases.\n\nThere might still be issues in England because of Henry VI's reported incapacity/insanity although it might not lead to a bloody civil war. He might end up remembered as a very weak monarch under whom assorted blocs of nobles maneuvered for power and influence and a lot would depend on how his heir develops. Since assuming no civil war his children(s) are likely to live to maturity. There is a record of sons of weak monarchs proving to be powerful such as Henry II and Edward III so you could see a reaction against over-powerful nobles under him. Although since Henry VI came to the throne very young due to the death of his father that could be some way down the line.\n\nA civil war in Scotland would be interesting. Depending on the situation in England you could see at least some of the northern nobles giving some support to the Douglas's in this case to avoid the Scottish monarchy being even more closely with France and France possibly intervening on the Stuart's side. [Either of those happening is going to encourage the other] Agree that tightening its grip on Ireland might be a better aim for the English state but a Scotland clearly under French domination would be a crucial issue. Mind you given how much of a fighter Margaret was OTL its likely she would be a very strong champion of the Stuart cause. Provided of course such an outspoken women doesn't upset too many nobles.\n\nPS One thought that occurred to me. With the tension between France and Burgundy if Margaret goes north to Scotland instead of a Burgundian bride could Henry end up married to a Bungundian wife himself, both because she would be available and as an alliance move to protect against France? If so and Burgundy goes as OTL with Charles the Bold dying without a male heir could England end up with a claim to the Burgundian lands?? Which would really complicate matters. A hell of a lot of potential butterflies here.\n\nPost by halferking on\n\nIs Joan Beaufort related to Margaret Beaufort, the mother of OTL Henry Tudor? Although if butterflies flap as a result of Margaret of Anjou marrying James II of Scotland, we may never see Henry Tudor at all. It could also be possible that Scotland might be the center of an alternate Wars of Roses equivalent.\n\nAnother possibility would be Henry VI marrying one of the Burgundian princesses, creating a different kind of conflict within the British Isles. If that were to occur, I could see England losing all of its French territories in Europe, including Calais and the Channel Islands, plus the formal title of Duke of Normandy going to the Valois dynasty. I can also see Scotland possibly expanding well into the old Hadrian’s Wall border as a result of a bigger English loss. Which may not go well for Ireland, if Henry VI would think of expanding into Ireland more aggressively.\n\nJoan Beaufort, Queen of Scots was the daughter of John, 1st Earl of Somerset & Margaret Holland, which makes Joan the grand-daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Catherine Swynford. Joan had several siblings and one of those was a brother - John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset & 3rd Earl of Somerset.\n\nJohn, 1st Duke of Somerset married a Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso. They had numerous children and one of them was a daughter named Lady Margaret Beaufort (born c. 1441). Lady Margaret married John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk in 1450, they were married for about 3 years when their marriage was annulled. They had no children.Two years later she went on to marry Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, son of Owen Tudor and Catherine of Valois in 1455. This union bore fruit - a son - Henry Tudor.\n\nSo in answer to your question Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots was the Aunt of Lady Margaret Beaufort - the mother of Henry VII.\n\nPost by halferking on\n\nDo you think there could be a possible partition of England between Scotland and France if the 100YW continued without a political marriage to keep the peace? Because that would have been something unusual to see, with England completely expelled from the continent. Although we might also see England degenerating into a situation worse than OTL Wars of the Roses, only France and Scotland would select their puppets to fight over the English throne.\n\nHenry VI and Charles VII signed the Treaty of Tours in 1444. The treaty included a two year truce as well as the betrothal of Margaret of Anjou to Henry VI. I don't know why England agreed to such a match as Margaret was considered to be a nobody a daughter of the impoverished Duke of Anjou, a very, very distant blood relation of Charles VII and on top of that she was Charles VII niece only through marriage. Charles VII took advantage of the truce to build up his military and in 1449 he finally pushed England out of France for good ending the 100 Years War. I don't think that Charles VII would seek to press his advantage as it seems the objective of French Kings was to take full control over their territory and establish a centralised government.The fall out of Henry VI defeat was one of the triggers for the War of the Roses. .\n\nJames II on the other hand was more amenable to the idea of gaining territory in England. He tried to purchase the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands from Norway and take the Isle of Man from the English, but both endeavour came to nought the Norse King wasn't interested and the Isle of Man too heavily defended. In OTL James inserted himself in the domestic affairs of his southern neighbour and acted as a 'peace broker' whilst at the same time trying to convince France to attack. When Henry VI was taken prisoner by the Yorkists Margaret of Anjou and her son fled north to Scotland. James sought to take advantage of chaos in England and looked to take back Roxbrugh Castle from the English. He might have succeeded and done more were it not for that cannon prematurely ending his life. That said James II had managed to make the Crown the dominant force in the Kingdom of Scotland.\n\nJames II had planted his flag firmly behind the House of Lancaster, his mother's House. His wife Mary of Guelders, great grand niece of Philip, Duke of Burgundy, was a staunch patriot of her adopted land and she was a shrewd strategist. When James II died at Roxbrugh Mary took over as regent for her young son James III.\n\nMeanwhile in England things were not going well and the Lancastrians were defeated at the Battle of Towton. Prior to this battle Henry VI, who suffered from bouts of insanity, had disinherited his son Edward, Prince of Wales in favour of Richard, Duke of York much to Margaret's annoyance. As mentioned things did not go well for the Lancastrians at Towton in Yorkshire. The Yorkist Army had the wind in their favour which meant that their arrows travelled further. It was the opposite for the Lancastrians. The Battle was ten hours old when the Lancastrians started to flee. They took their armour off to make it quicker for them to run. Bad decision. At the end of the battle Lancastrian bodies were strew across the fields for at least 2.5 miles! With this devastating defeat Margaret and her son fled north to Scotland.\n\nMary initially took pity on Margaret and proposed a union between her daughter Margaret of Scotland and Margaret's son Edward. Unfortunately for Margaret and her son things took a turn for the worse when Edward IV became Duke of Burgundy's brother-in-law through the marriage between Philip and Edward's sister Margaret of York. Mary's continued relationship with Margaret of Anjou was seen as a problem as the Lancastrian Margaret was Edward's enemy and this could end the treaty England had with Burgundy against Louis XI of France.\n\nIf Margaret of Anjou was married to James II of Scotland instead of Henry VI of England that might change things. Edward IV favoured an alliance with Burgundy against France whilst the Earl of Warwick favoured an alliance with France and indeed Warwick had even tried to marry Edward off to a French Princess, only to find out that Edward had married Elizabeth Woodville in secret. If James II still dies at Roxbrugh Margaret, as Regent, may seek to take advantage of the division at the English Court. Relations between Edward IV and Warwick boiled over in to open rebellion and that would be a perfect time. She could side with Warwick and provide aid and perhaps in the process take some border towns from England..."
