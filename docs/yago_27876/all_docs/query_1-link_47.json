In Shakespeare's rendering she becomes an adulterous queen who mocks her captive enemy, Richard, duke of York, before killing him in cold blood. Shakespeare's portrayal has proved to be remarkably resilient, because Margaret's queenship lends itself to such an assessment. In 1445, at the age of fifteen, she was married to the ineffectual Henry VI, a move expected to ensure peace with France and an heir to the throne. Eight years later, while she was in the later stages of her only pregnancy, Henry suffered a complete mental collapse that left him catatonic for roughly a year and a half: Margaret came to the political forefront. In the aftermath of the king's illness, she became an indefatigable leader of the Lancastrian loyalists in their struggle against their Yorkist opponents. Margaret's exercise of power was always fraught with difficulty: as a woman, her effective power was dependent upon her invocation of the authority of her husband or her son. Her enemies lost no opportunity to charge her with misconduct of all kinds. More than five hundred years after Margaret's death this examination of her life and career allows a more balanced and detached view.\n\n\"We are in Maurer's debt for providing new perspectives on her subject, which no student of later Lancastrian politics or medieval queenship should neglect.\" HISTORY\n\n\"Maurer illuminates medieval queenship in a male-dominated world, and convincingly re-interprets the full records of Margaret that have survived, including a wonderful cache of her letters... She draws a picture of a highly intelligent, conscientious woman, powerless without her husband's authority, and much maligned in contemporary rumour.\" BBC HISTORY\n\n\"Maurer tells a very readable and engaging story.... Such a significant and long overdue reappraisal must be welcomed.\" REVIEWS IN HISTORY\n\n\"The most cogent, effective and convincing account of Margaret's political career yet available.\" EHR\n\nPaperback\n\n9781843831044\n\n$36.95 / £24.99\n\nShipping Options\n\nBuy Ships within 2 business days\n\nBuy\n\nPurchasing options are not available in this country.\n\nEbook (EPDF)\n\n9781846151125\n\n$29.95 / £19.99\n\nUnavailable\n\nTitle Details\n\n252 Pages\n\n2.34 x 1.56 cm\n\n2 line illus.\n\nImprint: Boydell Press\n\nRelated Titles\n\nMore by Author\n\nWomen in American Operas of the 1950s\n\nby Monica A.
