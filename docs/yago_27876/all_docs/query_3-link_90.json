Elizabeth Woodville was crowned queen on 26 May 1465, the Sunday after Ascension Day.\n\nEdward IV (28 April 1442 – 9 April 1483) was King of England from 4 March 1461 to 3 October 1470, then again from 11 April 1471 until his death in 1483. He was a central figure in the Wars of the Roses, a series of civil wars in England fought between the Yorkist & Lancastrian factions between 1455 & 1487.\n\nHis marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464 led to conflict with his chief advisor, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, known as the \"Kingmaker\". In 1470, a revolt led by Warwick & Edward's brother George, Duke of Clarence, briefly re-installed Henry VI. Edward fled to Flanders, where he gathered support & invaded England in March 1471; after victories at the battles of Barnet & Tewkesbury, he resumed the throne. Shortly afterwards, Henry VI was found dead in the Tower of London. Despite a continuing threat from Henry Tudor, later Henry VII, the last Lancastrian claimant, Edward reigned in relative peace for the next twelve years. When he died suddenly in April 1483, Edward IV was succeeded by his minor son Edward V, but Edward IV's brother Richard III soon seized the throne.\n\nEdward had ten children by Elizabeth Woodville, seven of whom survived him.\n\nNEW Collectable Solar Powered Pal - King Charles III\n\n1 May 1517\n\nThe Evil May Day Riots in London.\n\n1 May 1707\n\nThe Acts of Union\n\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800.\n\nThe state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England & Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain & its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm within the British Empire.\n\nThe unitary state was governed by a single parliament & government, based at Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England & King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \"Union of the Crowns\". Also, after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. The early years of the unified kingdom were marked by Jacobite risings which ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at Culloden in 1746. Later, in 1763, victory in the Seven Years' War led to the dominance of the British Empire, which was to be the foremost global power for over a century & later grew to become the largest empire in history.\n\nOn 1 January 1801, the kingdoms of Great Britain & Ireland merged to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom, & the state was renamed the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland\" – its formal name at present.\n\nOther 1 May history;\n\n1118 – Matilda of Scotland died b. 1080).

Musician Mark Smeaton had also been taken there, & the Imperial Ambassador, Eustace Chapuys, wrote to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor on 2nd May telling him that George Boleyn, Lord Rochford & brother of Queen Anne Boleyn, was also in the Tower.\n\nAnne Boleyn was watching a game of real tennis when she was disturbed by a messenger telling her that the King had ordered her to present herself to his Privy Council. Anne left the tennis match & presented herself in the council chamber in front of a royal commission consisting of the Duke of Norfolk (her uncle), Sir William Fitzwilliam & Sir William Paulet. There she was informed that she was being accused of committing adultery with three different men, & that Smeaton & Norris had confessed.\n\nAnne was then taken to her apartments until the tide of the Thames turned & then, at two o’clock in the afternoon, she was escorted by barge to the Tower of London. It is likely that Anne may have entered through The Court Gate in The Byward Tower rather than The Traitor's Gate, according to historian & author of The Life & Death of Anne Boleyn, Eric Ives. In the Tower, she collapsed, demanding to know the location of her father & \"swete broder\", as well as the charges against her.\n\nAnne was tried before a jury of peers, which included Henry Percy, her former betrothed, & her own uncle, Thomas Howard & found guilty on 15 May. She was beheaded four days later. Personally I view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest, & witchcraft, as almost farcical. Henry married Jane Seymour less than three weeks after Anne's execution!\n\nOther 2 May history;\n\n1194 – King Richard I of England gives Portsmouth its first Royal Charter.\n\n1568 – Mary, Queen of Scots, escapes from Loch Leven Castle.\n\n1816 – Marriage of Léopold of Saxe-Coburg & Princess Charlotte of Wales.\n\n3 May\n\n3 May 1152\n\nMatilda of Boulogne, Queen of England died\n\nMatilda I (or Maud) (born around 1105 in Boulogne, France, the daughter of Eustace III, Count of Boulogne, & his wife Mary, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland & Saint Margaret of Scotland.) was suo jure Countess of Boulogne. She was also queen consort of England as the wife of King Stephen, married in 1125.\n\nMatilda was also first cousin of her husband's rival, Empress Matilda. Through her maternal grandmother, Matilda was descended from the pre-Conquest English kings. Matilda was a supporter of the Knights Templar. She founded Cressing Temple in Essex in 1137 & Temple Cowley in Oxford in 1139. Like her predecessor, Matilda of Scotland, she had a close relationship with the Holy Trinity Priory at Aldgate. She took the prior as her confessor & two of her children were buried there.\n\nIn the civil war that followed, known as the Anarchy, Matilda proved to be her husband's strongest supporter. When England was invaded in 1138, she called troops from Boulogne & its ally Flanders, & besieged Dover Castle with success & then went north to Durham, where she made a treaty with David I of Scotland in 1139. After Stephen was captured at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, she rallied the king's partisans, & raised an army with the help of William of Ypres. While the Empress Matilda waited in London to prepare her coronation, Matilda and Stephen's brother Henry of Blois had her chased out of the city. The Empress Matilda went on to besiege Henry of Blois at Winchester. Matilda of Boulogne then commanded her army to attack the besiegers. There was a rout in which the Empress's half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, was captured. The two Matilda's then agreed to exchange prisoners & Stephen ruled as king again. Under the agreement that settled the civil war, her children did not inherit the throne.\n\nMatilda died of a fever at Hedingham Castle, Essex, England, & is buried at Faversham Abbey, which she & her husband founded.\n\n3 May 1446\n\nMargaret of York was born at Fotheringhay Castle\n\nAlso by marriage known as Margaret of Burgundy—was Duchess of Burgundy as the 3rd wife of Charles the Bold. She was a daughter of Richard, 3rd Duke of York, & Cecily Neville, & the sister of kings Edward IV & Richard III.\n\nOn 27 June 1468, she met Charles the Bold for the first time, & the pair were privately married between 5am & 6am on 3 July, in the house of a wealthy merchant of Damme. Although the marriage produced no children, Margaret proved a valuable asset to Burgundy. A good looking woman, but (rarely for the hyperbole of her age) never described as beautiful, Margaret had fine features, & was, at almost 6 feet, very tall, a feature accentuated by her slimness, & her straight & upright bearing. Her eyes were grey, & her mouth was small; her smile allowed her to demonstrate her wry humour, her wit, & her graciousness. In appearance, she was utterly unlike the dark & burly Duke Charles the Bold, who was shorter than her: when they met for the first time, she was forced to bend in order to receive his kiss. But her intelligence was keen, & her will strong; she made a worthy bride for the Duke in nature.\n\nWith her husband's family, she got on excellently: she became a mother-figure to her step-daughter, Mary, who shared Margaret's interests in reading, riding, hunting, & falconry; her mother-in-law, Isabella of Portugal, said of Margaret that she was \"well pleased with the sight of this lovely lady, & pleased with her manners & virtues\". A capable ruler, she proved a masterful Duchess; she was a Yorkist in sympathies, but she was before that the Duchess of Burgundy. She bore no male heir to succeed to Burgundy, but she preserved it from ruin; to her actions can be ascribed the survival of the Burgundian state, She died aged 57 on 23 November 1503.\n\nOther 3 May history;\n\n1415 – Cecily Neville, Duchess of York was born (d. 1495). She was the wife of Richard, Duke of York (1411–1460), & the mother of two kings of England - Edward IV & Richard III.\n\n1783 - Prince Octavius of Great Britain, the thirteenth child & eighth son of King George III & his queen consort, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. died (b.1779).\n\n1870 – Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein was born (d. 1948). She was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria.\n\n4 May\n\n4 May 1471\n\nWars of the Roses: The Battle of Tewkesbury: Edward IV defeats a Lancastrian Army & kills Edward, Prince of Wales\n\nThe Battle of Tewkesbury, which took place on 4 May 1471, was one of the decisive battles of the Wars of the Roses. The Yorkists numbered 5,000 & were outnumbered by the 6,000 Lancastrians. The forces loyal to the House of Lancaster were completely defeated by those of the rival House of York under their monarch, King Edward IV.\n\nEarly on the 4th May 1471, before the battle of Tewkesbury began, Edward IV sent a group of 200 horsemen to a nearby wood 'in caace his sayd enemyes had layed any bushement (ambush) in that wood', instructing them that 'yf they saw none suche… to employ themselfe in the best wyse as they cowlde;'\n\nThis they most certainly did, charging into the flank of the Duke of Somerset's division as it reeled from its struggle with the Yorkist army's centre - '... cam & brake on, all at ones, upon the Duke of Somerset, & his vawarde, aside-hand, unadvised, whereof they, seinge the Kynge gave them ynoughe to doo afore them, were gretly dismaid & abashed, & so toke them to flight into the parke, & into the medowe that was nere, & into lanes, and dykes, where they best hopyd to escape the dangar; of whom, netheles, many were distressed, taken & slayne;' (from The Arrivall, Edward IV's official account of the events of 1471)\n\nEdward's vanguard was commanded by his youngest brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later King Richard III). Although he was only 18 years old, Richard was already an experienced commander & had led a division at the Battle of Barnet. Edward himself commanded the main battle, in which the Duke of Clarence (Edward's brother) was also stationed. Edward was 29 years old & at the height of his prowess as a soldier.\n\nThe Lancastrians were led by Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, a prominent supporter of King Henry VI. Edward, Prince of Wales was present with the centre of his army. At 17 Prince Edward was no stranger to battlefields, having been given by his mother the task of condemning to death Yorkist prisoners taken at the Second Battle of St Albans, but he lacked experience of actual command. The Lancastrian heir to the throne, Edward, Prince of Wales, & many prominent Lancastrian nobles were killed during the battle. Many of the other Lancastrian nobles & knights sought sanctuary in Tewkesbury Abbey. King Edward attended prayers in the Abbey shortly after the battle. He granted permission for the Prince of Wales & others slain in the battle to be buried within the Abbey or elsewhere in the town without being quartered as traitors as was customary.\n\nTwo days after the battle, Somerset & other leaders were dragged out of the Abbey & ordered by the Duke of Gloucester & the Duke of Norfolk to be put to death after perfunctory trials. The Abbey was not officially a sanctuary, though it is doubtful whether this would have deterred Edward even if it had been. It had to be reconsecrated a month after the battle, following the violence done within its precincts. A few days later Margaret of Anjou, Queen consort to Henry VI sent word to Edward from her refuge that she was \"at his commandment\".\n\nThe Lancastrian king, Henry VI, who was a prisoner in the Tower of London, died or was murdered shortly after the battle. Tewkesbury restored political stability to England until the death of Edward IV in 1483.\n\n4 May 1471\n\nThe heir to the throne Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales died in battle.\n\nEdward of Westminster (b.13 October 1453), also known as Edward of Lancaster, was the only son of King Henry VI of England & Margaret of Anjou.\n\nHe was born at the Palace of Westminster. At the time of his birth, there was strife between Henry's supporters & those of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, who had a claim to the throne & challenged the authority of Henry's officers of state. Henry was suffering from mental illness. In 1460, King Henry was captured by the supporters of the Duke of York at the Battle of Northampton & taken to London. Queen Margaret & Edward had meanwhile fled through Cheshire. By Margaret's later account, she induced outlaws & pillagers to aid her by pledging them to recognise the seven-year-old Edward as rightful heir to the crown. They subsequently reached safety in Wales & journeyed to Scotland, where Margaret raised support, while the Duke of York's enemies gathered in the north of England.\n\nDuring the second Battle of St Albans, two Yorkist knights, were captured. The day after the battle, Margaret asked Edward what death the two knights should suffer. Edward readily replied that their heads should be cut off. In 1467 the ambassador of the Duchy of Milan to the court of France wrote that Edward \"already talks of nothing but cutting off heads or making war, as if he had everything in his hands or was the god of battle or the peaceful occupant of that throne.\"\n\nAfter several years in exile, Margaret took the best opportunity that presented itself & allied herself with the renegade Earl of Warwick. Prince Edward was married to Anne Neville, Warwick's younger daughter, in December 1470, though there is some doubt as to whether the marriage was ever consummated. On the same day Margaret & Edward landed in England (14 April), Edward IV defeated & killed Warwick at the Battle of Barnet. With little real hope of success, the inexperienced prince & his mother led the remnant of their forces to meet Edward IV in the Battle of Tewkesbury. They were defeated & Edward was killed, making him the only heir apparent to the English throne ever to die in battle. Edward's body is buried at Tewkesbury Abbey. His widow, Anne Neville, married the Duke of Gloucester, to whom she had been betrothed before & who eventually succeeded as King Richard III in 1483.\n\nOther 4 May history;\n\n1913 – Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark was born (d. 2007).

In attendance at the marriage were Elizabeth's sister Margaret, her father, Edward I of England, her brother Edward, & Humphrey de Bohun. After the wedding Elizabeth was expected to go to Holland with her husband, but did not wish to go, leaving her husband to go alone. It is recorded that while in Ipswich the King, in some outburst, threw his daughter's coronet into the fire: a great ruby and a great emerald were supplied by Adam the Goldsmith for stones lost as a result.\n\n️After some time travelling England, it was decided Elizabeth should follow her husband. Her father accompanied her, travelling through the Southern Netherlands between Antwerp, Mechelen, Leuven and Brussels, before ending up in Ghent. There they remained for a few months, spending Christmas with her two sisters Eleanor & Margaret. On 10 November 1299, John died of dysentery, though there were rumours of his murder. No children had been born from the marriage.\n\nOn her return trip to England, Elizabeth went through Brabant to see her sister Margaret. On 14 November 1302 Elizabeth was married to Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, 3rd of Essex, also Constable of England, at Westminster Abbey. They had eleven children, six sons & five daughters\n\nDuring Christmas 1315, Elizabeth, who was pregnant with her eleventh child, was visited by her sister-in-law, Queen Isabella of France. On 5 May 1316 she went into labour, giving birth to her daughter Isabella. Both Elizabeth & her daughter Isabella died shortly after the birth aged just 33.. Elizabeth was interred at Walden Abbey, Essex, together with her infant daughter & other members of the de Bohun family.\n\nOther 5 May history;\n\n1215 - Rebel barons renounce allegiance to King John.\n\n1640 - Charles Stuart, Duke of Cambridge died (b.1660).

He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz in France when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce. The King's continued ill health was unreported & he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high.\n\nOn 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu on 5 May. The following day, the King suffered several heart attacks, but refused to go to bed saying, \"No, I shall not give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end.\" Between moments of faintness, his son the Prince of Wales (later King George V) told him that his horse, 'Witch of the Air', had won at Kempton Park that afternoon. The King replied, \"Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad\": his final words. At 11:30 p.m. he lost consciousness for the last time & was put to bed. He died 15 minutes later.\n\nEdward VII was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 20 May 1910. As Barbara Tuchman noted in The Guns of August, his funeral marked \"the greatest assemblage of royalty & rank ever gathered in one place &, of its kind, the last\".\n\n6 May 1960\n\nPrincess Margaret married the photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones\n\nThe ceremony was the first royal wedding to be broadcast on television, & attracted viewing figures of 300 million worldwide. Despite the public enthusiasm, most foreign royal families of Europe disapproved a king's daughter marrying a photographer. Queen Ingrid of Denmark was the only foreign royal to attend the wedding.\n\nMargaret's wedding dress was designed by Norman Hartnell, & worn with the Poltimore tiara. The Princess had eight young bridesmaids, led by her niece, Princess Anne. The other bridesmaids were her goddaughter, Marilyn Wills, daughter of her cousin Jean Elphinstone & Major John Lycett Wills; Annabel Rhodes, daughter of her cousin Margaret Elphinstone & Denys Rhodes; Lady Virginia Fitzroy, daughter of Hugh Fitzroy, Earl of Euston; Sarah Lowther, daughter of Sir John Lowther; Catherine Vesey, daughter of Viscount de Vesci; & Lady Rose Nevill, daughter of the Marquess of Abergavenny. The Duke of Edinburgh escorted the bride & the best man was Dr Roger Gilliatt.\n\nThe honeymoon was spent aboard the royal yacht Britannia on a six-week Caribbean cruise. As a wedding present, Colin Tennant gave her a plot of land on his private Caribbean island, Mustique. The newly-weds moved into rooms in Kensington Palace.\n\nIn 1961, the Princess's husband was created Earl of Snowdon, whereupon she became formally styled HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. The couple had two children (both born by Caesarean section at Margaret's request): David, Viscount Linley, born 3 November 1961, & Lady Sarah, born 1 May 1964.\n\nThe marriage widened Princess Margaret's social circle beyond the Court & aristocracy to include show business celebrities and bohemians, & was seen at the time as reflecting the breakdown of class barriers.

Symeon of Durham calls him a son of Aldfrith of Northumbria, which would make him a brother, or perhaps a half-brother, of Osred. Alternatively, he may have been a son of King Eahlfrith of Deira, & thus a first cousin of Osred.\n\nBede reports little of Osric's reign, but records that comets were seen at his death, a sign of ill omen.

He overthrew the Pagans with great slaughter, & smiting the fugitives, he pursued them as far as the fortress.\" — Smyth 2002, pp. 26–27.\n\nThe primary reason for Alfred's victory was probably the relative size of the two armies. The men of even one shire could be a formidable fighting force, as those of Devon proved in the same year, defeating an army under Ubbe Ragnarsson at the Battle of Cynwit. In addition, in 875 Guthrum had lost the support of other Danish lords, including Ivar the Boneless & Ubba. Further Danish forces had settled on the land before Guthrum attacked Wessex: in East Anglia, & in Mercia between the treaty at Exeter & the attack on Chippenham; many others were lost in a storm off Swanage in 876–877, with 120 ships wrecked. Internal disunity was threatening to tear the Danes apart, & they needed time to reorganize. Fortunately for Wessex, they did not use the time available effectively.\n\nThree weeks after the battle, Guthrum was baptised at Aller in Somerset with Alfred as his sponsor. It is possible that the enforced conversion was an attempt by Alfred to lock Guthrum into a Christian code of ethics, hoping it would ensure the Danes' compliance with any treaties agreed to. The converted Guthrum took the baptismal name of Athelstan. Under the terms of the Treaty of Wedmore, the converted Guthrum was required to leave Wessex & return to East Anglia. Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham & made its way to Cirencester (in the kingdom of Mercia) & remained there for a year. The following year the army went to East Anglia, where it settled.\n\n10 May 1726\n\nCharles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St Albans died (b. 1670)\n\nCharles Beauclerk was an illegitimate son of King Charles II of England by his mistress Nell Gwyn.\n\nOn 21 December 1676, a warrant was passed for \"a grant to Charles Beauclerc, the King's natural son, & to the heirs male of his body, of the dignities of Baron of Heddington, co. Oxford, & Earl of Burford in the same county, with remainder to his brother, James Beauclerc, & the heirs male of his body.\" A few weeks later, James was given \"the title of Lord Beauclerc, with the place & precedence of the eldest son of an earl.\" Just after the death of Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, at the turn of the year, on 5 January 1684, King Charles granted his son Charles, Earl of Burford, the title of Duke of St Albans. He became colonel in the 8th regiment of horse in 1687, & served with the emperor Leopold I, being present at the siege of Belgrade in 1688.\n\nWhen his mother died (14 November 1687), Beauclerk received a large estate, including Burford House, near Windsor Castle. After the Battle of Landen in 1693, William III made Beauclerk captain of the gentlemen pensioners, & four years later gentleman of the bedchamber. On 17 April 1694 he married Lady Diana de Vere, daughter & sole heiress of Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford. She was a well-known beauty, who became lady of the bedchamber to Caroline of Ansbach, Princess of Wales. They had twelve children.\n\nIn 1718, George made him a Knight of the Garter. Beauclerk died at Bath two days after his 56th birthday & is buried in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his eldest son.\n\nSeveral legends describe how Beauclerk became Earl of Burford. The first is that on arrival of the King, his mother said, \"Come here, you little bastard, & greet your father.\" When the king rebuked her for calling him that, she replied, \"Your Majesty has given me no other name to call him by.\" In response, Charles created him Earl of Burford.\n\nOther 10 May history;\n\n1291 – Scottish nobles recognize the authority of Edward I of England pending the selection of a king\n\n1403 – Katherine Swynford, widow of John of Gaunt died (b.1350)\n\n1775 - Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, queen consort of Denmark died (b.1751).

They arrived at Messina in Sicily during Lent (when the marriage could not take place) in 1191 & were joined by Richard's sister Joan, the widowed Queen of Sicily. The two women became good friends & Berengaria was left in Joan's custody. En route to the Holy Land, the ship carrying Berengaria & Joan ran aground off the coast of Cyprus, & they were threatened by the island's ruler, Isaac Comnenus.\n\nRichard came to their rescue, captured the island, & overthrew Comnenus. Richard then married Berengaria of Navarre on May 12, 1191, in the Chapel of St George at Limassol on Cyprus, surely the most unlikely place for the wedding of an English king.\n\nThe marriage was celebrated with great pomp & splendour, many feasts & entertainments, & public parades & celebrations followed commemorating the event. Among the other grand ceremonies was a double coronation. Richard caused himself to be crowned King of Cyprus, & Berengaria Queen of England & of Cyprus, too. Richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly, though they returned separately. Berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did, & she did not see England until after his death. After his release from German captivity Richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct, but he was not reunited with his wife. The marriage remained childless.\n\n12 May 1937\n\nCoronation of King George VI & Queen Elizabeth\n\nThe coronation took place at Westminster Abbey, London, on 12 May 1937.\n\nKing George VI ascended the throne upon the abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII, on 10 December 1936, three days before his 41st birthday. Edward's coronation had been planned for 12 May 1937 & it was decided to continue with his brother & sister-in-law's coronation on the same date.\n\nAlthough the music included a range of new anthems & the ceremony underwent some alterations to include the Dominions, it remained a largely conservative affair & closely followed the ceremonial of King George V's coronation in 1911.\n\nThe ceremony began with the anointing of the King, symbolising his spiritual entry into kingship, & then his crowning & enthronement, representing his assumption of temporal powers & responsibilities.\n\nThe peers of the realm then paid homage to the King before a shorter & simpler ceremony was conducted for the Queen's coronation.\n\nThe return procession to Buckingham Palace was over six miles in length, making it the longest coronation procession up to that time; crowds of people lined the streets to watch it, over thirty-two thousand soldiers took part & twenty thousand police officers lined the route.\n\nThe coronation was commemorated by the issuing of official medals, coinage, & stamps, by military parades across the Empire, & by numerous unofficial celebrations, including street parties & the production of memorabilia.\n\nOther 12 May history;\n\n1820 – Florence Nightingale, Italian-English nurse, social reformer, & statistician was born (d. 1910).\n\n13 May\n\n13 May 1568\n\nMary Queen of Scots is defeated at Battle of Langside, part of Civil war between Queen Mary & Regent Moray.\n\nThe Battle of Langside was fought on 13 May 1568 between forces loyal to Mary, Queen of Scots, & forces acting in the name of her infant son James VI. Mary’s short period of personal rule ended in 1567 in recrimination, intrigue, & disaster when, after her capture at Carberry Hill, she was forced to abdicate in favour of James VI, her infant son. Mary was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, while her Protestant half-brother, James Stewart, Earl of Moray, was appointed Regent on behalf of his nephew. In early May 1568 Mary escaped, heading west to the country of the Hamiltons, high among her remaining supporters, & the safety of Dumbarton Castle with the determination to restore her rights as queen. Mary was defeated & went into exile & captivity in England.

The Queen “immediately established a rapport with the audience” Her remarks—which the Queen read from paper instead of a teleprompter, & which had been drafted by the British Embassy because modern British monarchs do not express independent policy opinions or political viewpoints—quickly developed a more serious tenor. She thanked the United States for its leadership in the Persian Gulf War & in previous armed conflicts & stressed the necessity of continued cooperation between the nations. As the Cold War struggle among superpowers wound down, the Queen warned against isolationism & discouraged any reliance on force to solve international problems. “Some people believe that power grows from the barrel of the gun. So it can, but history shows that it never grows well nor for very long,” she said. “Force in the end, is sterile.

On his deathbed, John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help nine year old Henry reclaim the kingdom, & requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, one of the most famous knights in England. The loyalist leaders decided to crown Henry at Gloucester Cathedral immediately to reinforce his claim to the throne. William knighted the boy, & Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October 1216. In the absence of Archbishops Stephen Langton of Canterbury & Walter de Gray of York, he was anointed by Sylvester, Bishop of Worcester, & Simon, Bishop of Exeter, & crowned by Peter des Roches. The royal crown had been either lost or sold during the civil war or possibly lost in The Wash, so instead the ceremony used a simple gold corolla belonging to Queen Isabella.\n\nCardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade & Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln & Sandwich in 1217.

She wore a red petticoat under a loose, dark grey gown of damask trimmed in fur & a mantle of ermine. Accompanied by two female attendants, Anne made her final walk from the Queen's House to the scaffold & she showed a \"devilish spirit\" & looked \"as gay as if she was not going to die\".\n\nAnne climbed the scaffold & made a short speech to the crowd: \"Good Christian people, I am come hither to die, for according to the law, & by the law I am judged to die, & therefore I will speak nothing against it.

Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a small north German duchy in the Holy Roman Empire. Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz married King George III in 1761. She was Queen of Great Britain & Ireland from their marriage in 1761 until the union of the two kingdoms in 1801, after which she was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Ireland until her death in 1818.

From Ottawa, they were accompanied throughout by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, to present themselves in North America as King & Queen of Canada. George was the first reigning monarch of Canada to visit North America, although he had been to Canada previously as Prince Albert & as Duke of York.\n\nAlthough the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King & Queen were enthusiastically received by the public. The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor, Edward VIII, was dispelled. They visited the 1939 New York World's Fair & stayed with President Franklin D.

Little is known of his reign, which may have begun in 779, according to later sources, & very few of the coins he issued have been discovered. It is known from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that he was killed on the orders of Offa of Mercia in 794. Æthelberht was locally canonised & became the focus of cults in East Anglia & at Hereford, where the shrine of the saintly king once existed. In the absence of known historical facts, mediaeval chroniclers provided their own details for his ancestry, life as king, & death at the hands of Offa. His feast day is 20 May.

According to the 'Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV', an official chronicle favourable to Edward, Henry died of melancholy on hearing news of the Battle of Tewkesbury and his son's death.\n\nIt is widely suspected, however, that Edward IV, who was re-crowned the morning following Henry's death, had in fact ordered his murder.\n\nSir Thomas More's History of Richard III explicitly states that Richard killed Henry, an opinion he might have derived from Commynes' Memoir (ed.

Among other things, Thomas Seymour was charged with proposing Jane as a bride for the king.\n\nIn the course of Thomas Seymour's following attainder & execution, Jane's father was lucky to stay largely out of trouble.

The couple remained in Britain, in calling distance of the Queen, who liked to have her daughters nearby, & Helena along with her youngest sister, Princess Beatrice, became the Queen's unofficial secretary. However, after Queen Victoria's death on 22 January 1901, Helena saw relatively little of her surviving siblings.\n\nHelena was the most active member of the royal family, carrying out an extensive programme of royal engagements at a time when royalty was not expected to appear often in public.

Jane would form a very close relationship with Mary Tudor (Henry's sister). Politically, Seymour appears to have been conservative.
