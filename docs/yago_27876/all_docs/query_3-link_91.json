She who had been for a time the virtual ruler of Lancastrian England, who had raised armies and intrigued with princes, had not enough money to pay her debts except through the uncertain charity of her uncharitable cousin, the king of France. Crushed by misfortune, bereft of power by the death of her husband and son, picked clean of her remaining rights and possessions by Louis as the price of her ransom from English captivity, she seemed to be of no interest to anybody.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nRenaissance Quarterly , Volume 39 , Issue 2 , Summer 1986 , pp. 183 - 217\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.2307/2862114 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Renaissance Society of America 1986\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

While Blacman, described by Lovatt as the only “extended account of the King's personality from an apparently contemporary hand,” remains central to any interpretation of the King, Lovatt has substantially altered our view of that author and enhances our appreciation of the source.

McKenna has indicated how ill the reality of Henry VI's character and personality accord with the image which is the center of his posthumous cult of sainthood. Describing the real Henry as a mixture of “charming indifference and exasperating incompetency” he points out that some at least of his contemporaries considered him to be dour and puritanical, a poor feudal lord and a bad businessman, and terms him “the greatest single disaster” in saintly royalty since Edward the Confessor. “Piety and Propaganda: the cult of King Henry VI,” in Chaucer and Middle English Studies in Honour ofRossell Hope Robbins, ed. Beryl Rowland (Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1974), p. 79.\n\n15\n\n15 Wolffe argues that, far from being a nonentity, Henry actually exerted too much control over the affairs of his government, too much that is, given the fact that his activities were divisive and his foreign policy aims (peace with France) unpopular. Thus by 1450 Henry had managed to neutralize the war effort, and produce both “creeping paralysis in the Council and government in home affairs, and a consequent collapse of respect for law and order by the great… . “ Wolffe, B.

Moreover, as Crawford shows (see above) Margaret's income was later substantially augmented.\n\n21\n\n21 Calendar of State Papers, Milan, I, 27, “Copy of News From England by Letters from Bruges, 1460,” reports that the English will probably make the son of the duke of York king by passing over prince Edward. The writer says the English are beginning to say that Edward is not the King's son.

Rather he sees it as the solution of a cautious nobility as yet reluctant to meddle with the royal authority, but also unwilling to accept the Queen as regent. It not only included those supportive of York but also a “strong element” of those who had long served Henry VI. Griffiths, Ralph A., “The King's Council and the First Protectorate of the Duke of York, 1453-1454,” English Historical Review, 99 (1984), 77 Google Scholar.\n\n26\n\n26 Wolffe, “The Personal Rule of Henry VI,” p. 31, mentions the gentleman of Reading who in 1444 was sentenced to be drawn, hanged and quartered because he was unwise enough to quote from the Bible the apostrophe, “Woe, to thee, O land, when thy king is a child.” Lest this be thought characteristic only of the early part of the period, Ross mentions a John Holton who in 1456 suffered the same penalty “for writing bills touching the person of the king,” Charles Ross, “Rumor, Propaganda and Popular Opinion During the Wars of the Roses,” in Patronage the Crown and the Provinces, a collection of essays ed. by Griffiths, cited above.\n\n27\n\n27 Wolffe, “The Personal Rule of Henry VI,” p. 32.\n\n28\n\n28 Griffiths, The Reign of King Henry VI, p. 217.\n\n29\n\n29 Allan, Alison, “Yorkist propaganda: Pedigree, prophecy and the ‘British History' in the reign of Edward IV,” in Patronage, Pedigree and Power in Late Medieval England, ed.

This last may have been unfortunate for Margaret, since her story could have fitted into a pattern of chivalric romance.\n\n31\n\n31 Crawford, “The King's Burden?” p. 52.\n\n32\n\n32 Although they were the center of the political process, kings were not expected to be partisan either. Partisanship suggests political participation in a situation where there was relative equality among members of competing groups or factions.\n\n33\n\n33 ThePaston Letters, III, 75.\n\n34\n\n34 The Paston Letters, III, 75.\n\n35\n\n35 Charles A. J. Armstrong notes that since sensitive information was usually supplied by the trusted bearer “this cautious habit has in general deprived historians of inestimable material, but nowhere more than in relation to the exchange of news.” To this one might add that it has also deprived them of invaluable expressions of personal opinion. “Some Examples of the Distribution and Speed of News in England at the Time of the Wars of the Roses,” in Studies in Medieval History Presented to Frederick Maurice Powicke, R.

Levy describes him as “literary-minded”, not only collecting but comparing different accounts. Yet he also points out that while Fabyan approached a “system of criticism” he nevertheless showed little “sense of improbability.” Levy, F. J., Tudor Historical Thought (San Marino: California: The Huntington Library, 1967), pp. 19–21 Google Scholar.\n\n53\n\n53 Fabyan, p. 652.\n\n54\n\n54 Fabyan, p. 631. He mentions the question of the prince's legitimacy but without specifying adultery. The slander, as he tells it, was that the prince “was not the naturall sone of Kyng Henrye, but changydin the cradell.” Ibid., p. 628.\n\n55\n\n55 The larger plan was based the seven joys of the Virgin, with each joy represented in a book, as Gransden indicates. However, this did not affect the historical schema of the period under discussion here. Gransden, , Historical Writing in England, II, 246 Google Scholar.\n\n56\n\n56 Fabyan, p. 618. Drawing upon unspecified sources, he points out that the marriage was unprofitable in a number of ways. First was the loss of Maine and Anjou. Next were the charges for bringing Margaret to England, for which Suffolk “axyd in playne parlyment, a fyftene and an halfe” bringing down on himself that hatred of the people which led to his death. Finally, it was clear God was not pleased, since from the day of the marriage fortune deserted Henry, leaving all to be ruled by the queen. “All whiche mysery fyll, for brekying of the promyse made by the kyng unto the erle of Armenakkys dough ter… .“\n\n57\n\n57 Levy, , Tudor Historical Thought, pp. 55 Google Scholar and 173. Levy maintains that the history was directly related to the requirements of Henry VII's foreign policy in seeking recognition for his dynasty, and that the work was intended primarily for foreign consumption. This, in Levy's view, also helps to explain the relative brevity of Polydore's work and the fact that (being too brief in its coverage for English taste) no complete translation was published.\n\n58\n\n58 Polydore Vergil, The Anglica Historia of Polydore Vergil: A.

In emphasizing the masculinity of the Queen's character and behavior, Polydore is in marked contrast to his contemporary, Fabyan and points the way for later Tudor writers.\n\n63\n\n63 Three Books of Polydore Vergil, p. 70. Fabyan had merely noted how dissention had grown between Henry and some of his lords “most specyally atwene the quenys couceyll and ye duke of Yorke and his blode. For all contrary the kynges promyse, by meanys of the quene, which than bare ye cure and charge of the land, the duke of Somerset was set at large … “ and restored to his old favor and power. The New Chronicles, p. 628.\n\n64\n\n64 Three Books of Polydore Vergil, pp. 93-94.\n\n65\n\n65 Rather than pressing English history back to its mythical beginnings, Hall concentrated on the relatively brief period of the Wars of the Roses and the emergence of the Tudors who were clearly the heroes of his story. This schema, together with his enthusiastic partisanship for the Tudor cause, further heightened and simplified the coloration of his portraits. See Levy, Tudor Historical Thought, pp. 173-174. It would have been as easy to make Margaret a tragic heroine as a villainess. However, Hall's emphasis in dealing with her was always upon the impropriety of her behavior as a woman.\n\n66\n\n66 Three Books of Polydore Vergil, p. 102.\n\n67\n\n67 Ibid., p, 109.\n\n68\n\n68 Ibid., p. 154.\n\n69\n\n69 Hay, Polydore Vergil, pp. 131-132.\n\n70\n\n70 In first introducing Margaret, he refers to her “noble Acts” and speaks of her later as being wise and prudent. Three Books of Polydore Vergil, pp. 68, 71.\n\n71\n\n71 Cairncross emphasizes Shakespeare's “easy familiarity” with the whole of Hall's chronicle and says it was upon Hall, more than any other source that he based his interpretation of the dynasty, The Second Part of King Henry VI, Introduction, xli. Bullough agrees that the main source for this play, like Part III, seems to have been either Hall or Grafton. Bullough, Geoffrey, Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1960), III, 90 Google Scholar. Certainly in both Parts II and III, the stamp of Hall's interpretation is firmly fixed upon the material pertaining to Margaret.\n\n72\n\n72 Three Books of Polydore Vergil, p. 68.\n\n73\n\n73 Edward Hall, Hall's Chronicle … (Original title, The Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Famelies ofLancastre and Yorks …, 1548), ed.

Holinshed, III, 224 and 238.\n\n75\n\n75 Hay, Polydore Vergil, p. 134, indicates something of the difficulty Hall encountered in translating Polydore Vergil's prose and the way he had to “build up his meaning with a sonorous agglomeration of synonyms”. It might be argued that this process itself led to an intensification and simplification of meaning. But I would suggest that the process was a conscious one since many other descriptive words could have been attached to Margaret, pitiful, sorrowful, and noble to name only ones which were actually—but infrequently—employed.\n\n76\n\n76 Grafton, I, 657; Hall, p. 236.\n\n77\n\n77 Grafton, I, 670; Hall, p. 249.\n\n78\n\n78 Grafton, I, 628; Hall, p. 208.\n\n79\n\n79 Hall, p. 208, omitted in Grafton.\n\n80\n\n80 Grafton, I, 655; Hall, p. 234.\n\n81\n\n81 Grafton, I, 629; Hall, p. 208.\n\n82\n\n82 Grafton, I, 661; Hall, p. 241; Holinshed, p. 252.\n\n83\n\n83 Not all Shakespeare's sources took this view. Holinshed's chronicle is one notable exception.\n\n84\n\n84 “A Political Retrospect,” in Political Poems and Songs Relating to English History, Composed During the Period from the Accession of Edward III to that of Richard III, Thomas Wright, ed.

Astraea combined the idea of the just virgin of the golden age with both imperial and religious imagery and was expressed in painting and engraving as well as literature. Yates, Frances A., Astraea: the Imperial Theme in the Sixteenth Century (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1975), p. 39 Google Scholar. Deborah, Diana, Cynthia and Belphoebe are among the per sonifications examined by Elkin Calhoun Wilson in England's Eliza (New York: Octagon Books, 1966). Elizabeth herself showed concern for her image in a number of practical ways, from the pageantry of her public appearances, to the thought she devoted to revising and presenting her parliamentary speeches. Allison Heisch had pointed out the care with which the Queen matched her utterances (and their images) to a particular audience. “Queen Elizabeth I: Parliamentary Rhetoric and the Exercise of Power.” Signs, I (Autumn, 1975), 31—57.\n\n86\n\n86 Strong, Roy, Tudor and Jacobean Portraits (London HMSO, 1969), Plates 199 and 215Google Scholar. Strong gives a clear, rich and appropriately complex sense of the way in which the official pictographic image of the Queen became, at last, a mythic figure, towering above the realm of England, an image of almost cosmic power (here he was speaking specifically of the Ditchley portrait, but with reference to his general themes). Portraits of Queen Elizabeth (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1963), p. 3. The production of portraits was (theoretically) controlled through official patterns, and unapproved representations were destroyed. Of course, formal and official propaganda played only a part in creating the Elizabethan image. Subjects both high and low responded on their own, repeating and elaborating images, and creating new verbal and pictographic representations.\n\n87\n\n87 See for example, Stone, Lawrence, The Family Sex and Marriage in England, 1500-1800 (New York: Harper and Row, 1977)Google Scholar and Schochet, Gordon J., Patriarchalism in Political Thought: The Authoritarian Family and Political Speculation and Attitudes Especially in Seventeenth-Century England (New York: Basic Books, 1975)Google Scholar, Chapter 3, “Patriarchalism in Tudor Political Thought,” to name but two significant titles out of an immense literature on the subject.\n\n88\n\n88 Loades has described some of the bitter invective levelled against Mary Tudor and indicates that by 1558 catholic propagandists had virtually given up and did not attempt to harness patriotic enthusiasm to the Queen and her cause. Open criticism continued to be suppressed. Loades, D.

The story of Elizabeth's propaganda dealings with Mary Queen of Scots is dealt with in Images of a Queen: Mary Stuart in Sixteenth-Century Literature (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964). She was equally politic in references to her sister, Mary Tudor.\n\n93\n\n93 An example is a passage cited in n. 77, above. In the accounts of Hall and Grafton, the Duke of York expects that Margaret (who is described as “a manly woman, usyng to rule and not to be ruled“), will resist his designation as Henry's heir. Holinshed includes the rest of the passage but omits the reference to the Queen's manly character. Hall, p. 249, Grafton, I, 670, Holinshed, p. 268.\n\n94\n\n94 Margaret first appeared in Henry VI, Part I but at the very end of the play and almost as an after-thought. Indeed, according to one school of thought she was tacked on to form a connection with Parts II and III, since the various parts probably were not composed at the same time.\n\n95\n\n95 William Shakespeare, 2 Henry VI, Act I, Scene iii, Line 146.\n\n96\n\n96 Shakespeare, William, The Third Part of King Henry VI, ed.
