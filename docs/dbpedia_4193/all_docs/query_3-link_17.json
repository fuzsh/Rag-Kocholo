        "text": "The Atari 2600–the console that shook the world in the late ’70s and early ’80s–is back. Atari, in partnership with PLAION, has today unveiled a “modern-day, faithful recreation” of the console that both dominated the North American market and led to the video game crash of 1983.\n\nThe remake, which takes its visual inspiration from the four-switch CX2600-A model from 1980, will launch worldwide on November 17 and is now available to pre-order for $129.99 (€119.99 / £99.99).\n\nPurists are thoroughly catered to, thanks to the inclusion of the Atari 2600+’s CX40+, “recreated with the same size and layout as the original 2600 Joystick Controller for that added touch of nostalgia.”\n\nMuch like its predecessor, it’s got wood–that natural panel is as authentic as it gets. To further push the spirit of the original Atari 2600, it’s also backward compatible with both 2600 and 7800 games.\n\nThe Atari 2600+ will launch with 10 classic games from the console’s repertoire, and each has “been created using modern technology to authentically replicate the original four-switch Atari 2600 Video Game System.”\n\nAtari 2600+ 10-in-1 launch games\n\nAdventure\n\nCombat\n\nDodge ‘Em\n\nHaunted House\n\nMaze Craze\n\nMissile Command\n\nRealsports Volleyball\n\nSurround\n\nVideo Pinball\n\nYars’ Revenge\n\nThe Atari 2600+ also builds on the original machine with features including a HDMI output, USB power, plus multiple screen resolutions. If you want to go even deeper into the Atari 2600 rebirth, PLAION has recreated the twisty CX-30 Paddle Controller, which you can get for $24.99 (€22.99 / £19.99), or with its own four-in-one multi-game cartridge—titles as yet unannounced—for $39.99 (€34.99 / £29.99).\n\nOther launch titles have been revealed, including cartridges for Berzerk Enhanced Edition and Mr Run and Jump.\n\nWade Rosen, CEO and chairman of Atari, said: “Preserving classic games is a priority for Atari, and the release of the Atari 2600+ will make the hundreds of Atari 2600 and 7800 games that have been released over the last 50 years universally accessible. PLAION’s approach to a quality recreation of iconic Atari hardware made them the perfect partner to bring the Atari 2600+ to market.”\n\nBen Jones, commercial director of retro at PLAION, added, “We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware.\n\n“For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will take you right back,” he said. “For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”"
