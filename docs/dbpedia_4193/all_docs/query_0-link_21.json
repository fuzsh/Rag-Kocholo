Timeline 11.1) How did Atari get its name? 11.2) What is the History of Atari? Subject: 1.1) What is an Atari 8-bit computer? Based in Silicon Valley in the U.S.A., the company known as Atari produced a line of home computers from 1979 to 1992 often referred to collectively as the \"Atari 8-bits,\" the \"8-bit Ataris,\" the \"400/800/XL/XE series,\" etc. The computers included the 400, 800, 1200XL, 600XL, 800XL, 65XE, 130XE, 800XE, and the XE Game System. These machines competed in the marketplace with the likes of the Commodore 64 series, the Apple II series, the Texas Instruments TI99/4A, and the Radio Shack Color Computer. Of these, the 8-bit Atari is most similar to the Commodore 64. In marketing their computers to the public, Atari always had to contend with their company history and reputation as a maker of video games. While the 8-bit Atari computers in their heyday were technically quite comparable if not superior in the worlds of home and business personal computing, they also live up to the name \"Atari\" with a huge library of video games which were often outstanding for their time. The 8-bit Atari computers do not use the same cartridges or floppy disks as any other Atari platforms, such as the 2600 Video Computer System (VCS), the 5200 SuperSystem, the 7800 ProSystem, or the ST/TT/Falcon computers. All of these but the 5200, however, do share the same joystick/controller hardware port. The 5200 SuperSystem is actually nearly identical to the 8-bit computers internally, yet cartridges for the 5200 and the 8-bit computers cannot be exchanged, primarly due to the physically different cartridge ports. Here are some of the performance specifications of the 8-bit Atari computers: (Some of the rest of this section by Bill Kendrick) CPU: 6502 (MOS Technology) CPU CLOCK SPEED: NTSC machines: 1.7897725 MHz non-NTSC machines: 1.773447 MHz SCREEN REFRESH RATE: 59.94 times per second (Hz) on NTSC Ataris 49.86 Hz on PAL machines GRAPHICS MODES: ANTIC CIO/BASIC Display Resolution Number of Mode # Graphics # Type (full screen) Colors --------------------------------------------------------------- 2 0 Char 40 x 24 1 * 3 - Char 40 x 19 1 * 4 12 ++ Char 40 x 24 5 5 13 ++ Char 40 x 12 5 6 1 Char 20 x 24 5 7 2 Char 20 x 12 5 8 3 Map 40 x 24 4 9 4 Map 80 x 48 2 A 5 Map 80 x 48 4 B 6 Map 160 x 96 2 C 14 ++ Map 160 x 192 2 D 7 Map 160 x 96 4 E 15 ++ Map 160 x 192 4 F 8 Map 320 x 192 1 * F 9 + Map 80 x 192 1 ** F 10 + Map 80 x 192 9 F 11 + Map 80 x 192 16 *** * 1 Hue; 2 Luminances ** 1 Hue; 16 Luminances *** 16 Hues; 1 Luminance + require the GTIA chip. 1979-1981 400/800's shipped with CTIA ++ Not available via the BASIC GRAPHICS command in 400/800's. GRAPHICS INDIRECTION (COLOR REGISTERS AND CHARACTER SETS): Nine color registers are available. Each color register holds any of 16 luminances x 16 hues = 256 colors. (Four registers are for player-missile graphics. Character sets of 128 8x8 characters, each with a normal and an inverse video incarnation, are totally redefinable. PLAYER-MISSILE GRAPHICS: (byte height and OR corrections from Piotr Fusik) Four 8-bit wide, 120 or 240 byte high single color players, and four 2-bit wide, 120 or 240 byte high single color missiles are available. A mode to combine the 4 missiles into a 5th 8-bit wide player is also available, as is a mode to OR colors or blacken out colors when players overlap (good for making three colors out of two players!) Players and missiles have adjustable priority and collision detection. DISPLAY LIST INTERRUPTS (DLI's): Screen modes can be mixed (by lines) down the screen using the Display List - a program which is executed by the ANTIC graphics chip every screen refresh: All other screen attributes (color, player/missile horizontal position, screen width, player/missile/playfield priority, etc.) can be ajusted at any point down the screen via DLI's. SCROLLING: Fine scrolling (both vertical and horizontal) can be enabled on any line on the screen. SOUND: Four voices of 8-bit pitch-resolution, 4-bit volume-resolution, 8-distortion sound can be produced. 2 voices (1 and 2, and/or 3 and 4) can be combined to make 16-bit pitch-resolution. Also 4-bit volume-only modes can be enabled for digitally sampled sound replay. A fifth \"voice\" is produced by the internal speaker on Atari 400/800's (for keyclick and buzzer) and in the XL's and XE's this was (fortunately!) rerouted through the normal audio output, and the keyclick can be disabled. Subject: 1.2) What is the Atari 400? Released along with the 800 in 1979, the 400 was the low-end model of the two. The only 8-bit Atari with a membrane keyboard rather than a full-stroke keyboard. One of the few 8-bit Ataris lacking a composite monitor port. Originally released with just 8K RAM, but most were sold with 16K RAM. Atari sold the Atari 400 48K RAM Expansion Kit, which required a little soldering, to dealers only. Only the 400 and 800 8-bit Atari models have four controller (joystick) ports. Early 400 units include the CTIA chip; later units include the GTIA chip, also present in all later 8-bit Ataris. The 1982 Atari catalog calls the 400 \"The Basic Computer\". The 400 was discontinued in 1983. During development the 400 was known internally as \"Candy.\" Subject: 1.3) What is the Atari 800? Released along with the 400 in 1979, the 800 was the high-end model of the two. The 800 is the only 8-bit Atari with a Right Cartridge slot, in addition to the Left Cartridge slot as present on all 8-bit Ataris. Originally released with just 8K RAM, many were sold with 16K, later on 48K was standard. The 800 is also the only 8-bit Atari with a four-slot modular design, where the first slot holds the CX801 (CX801-P for PAL machines) 10K ROM module, and the other three slots hold combinations of CX852 8K or CX853 16K RAM modules. Only the 400 and 800 8-bit Atari models have four controller (joystick) ports. Early 800 units include the CTIA chip; later units include the GTIA chip, also present in all later 8-bit Ataris. The 800 was discontinued in 1983. During development the 800 was known internally as \"Colleen.\" Subject: 1.4) What is the Atari 1200XL? Released as a big brother to the 400/800 in 1982, the 1200XL now uses Atari's slightly customized 6502C microprocessor, and includes a full 64K RAM. The 1200XL was the first 8-bit Atari with just 2 controller ports. In addition, the 1200XL includes 4 programmable Function keys and a Help key, 4 LEDs, built-in diagnostic and graphics demonstration programs, and probably the favorite keyboard of any 8-bit Atari computer. Clicks previously outputted through the built-in speaker are now heard from the television or monitor's speaker. The revised 16K Operating System offers many new features, including an alternate International Character Set. The 1200XL was the biggest single step forward in development of the 8-bit Atari platform, but the corresponding software compatability problems hurt its popularity. The 1200XL lacks separate chroma video signal, and also lacks the +5 Volts power on pin 10 of the SIO port. The 1200XL was discontinued in 1983. Subject: 1.5) What is the Atari 600XL? Released in 1983 as a replacement for the 400, the 600XL is the low-end version of the 800XL. The 600XL/800XL include most of the features of the 1200XL minus the Function keys and the demo program. But both the 800XL and 600XL have the Atari BASIC language built-in. In addition, these two systems offer the Parallel Bus Interface (PBI), providing fast parallel access to the heart of the computer. The 600XL has 16K RAM. The 600XL can be expanded from 16K to 64K with the Atari 1064 Memory Module. Normally boots with Atari BASIC (Revision B) enabled; Hold down [Option] on startup to boot without BASIC. The North American/NTSC 600XL does not include a composite monitor port; The European/PAL 600XL includes the monitor port, but this lacks the chroma video signal. The 600XL was discontinued in 1985. Subject: 1.6) What is the Atari 800XL? Released in 1983 as a replacement for the 800 and 1200XL, the 800XL is the high-end version of the 600XL. The 600XL/800XL include most of the features of the 1200XL minus the Function keys and the demo program. But both the 800XL and 600XL have the Atari BASIC language built-in. In addition, these two systems offer the Parallel Bus Interface (PBI), providing fast parallel access to the heart of the computer. The 800XL contains 64K RAM. Normally boots with Atari BASIC (Revision B) enabled; Hold down [Option] on startup to boot without BASIC. The 800XL lacks separate chroma video signal. There was a late version of the 800XL in Europe, called 800XLF. The 800XLF includes a redesigned motherboard (the XE design) and contains FREDDIE for memory management and has chroma output. BASIC is Revision C. Though Atari never disclosed sales figures, the 800XL was likely the most- sold of all 8-bit Atari computer models. The 800XL was discontinued in 1985. Subject: 1.7) What is the Atari 65XE? Released in 1985 as a replacement for the 600XL, the 65XE is the low-end version of the 130XE. The 65XE is nearly identical to the 800XL in features, minus the PBI. Many European (PAL) 65XE's include the ECI port, but no North American (NTSC) 65XE's include the ECI port. All XE computers also include the FREDDIE memory management chip. Normally boots with Atari BASIC (Revision C) enabled; Hold down [Option] on startup to boot without BASIC. The 65XE was discontinued in 1992. Subject: 1.8) What is the Atari 130XE? Released in 1985 as a replacement for the 800XL, the 130XE is the high-end version of the 65XE. The 130XE offers 128K RAM, plus the FREDDIE memory management chip, supporting the unique (but rarely used) ability for the 6502 and the ANTIC to independently access RAM banks. In addition, the 130XE replaces the PBI port with the Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI), continuing the powerful feature of a fast parallel port. Normally boots with Atari BASIC (Revision C) enabled; Hold down [Option] on startup to boot without BASIC. The 130XE was discontinued in 1992. Subject: 1.9) What is the Atari 800XE? Unseen and unknown in North America, the 800XE was sold in eastern Europe. The 800XE is identical in features to the European version of the 65XE, including the ECI port. The 800XE could also be described as a 64K version of the 130XE. Normally boots with Atari BASIC (Revision C) enabled; Hold down [Option] on startup to boot without BASIC. Jindrich Kubec writes, \"The problematic Chinese 800XEs with GTIA problems were manufactured in 1992.\" The 800XE was discontinued in 1992. Subject: 1.10) What is the Atari XE Game System? In a change of marketing strategy, Atari introduced the new XE Game System in 1987. Despite its label, the XEGS is a true 8-bit Atari computer system. It offers the convenience of a detachable keyboard and built-in Missile Command game, while offering 64K RAM and full compatibility with the 65XE. It was packaged with the Light Gun, and the Flight Simulator II and Bug Hunt cartridges. Keyboard connected/no cartridge: boots to Atari BASIC Keyboard connected/no cartdidge/[Select] held down at startup: boots to Missile Command No keyboard connected/no cartridge: boots to Missile Command No keyboard connected/no cartridge/[Select] held down at startup: boots from disk drive No keyboard connected/no cartridge/[Select]+[Start] held down at startup: boots from tape drive [Option] held down at startup = BASIC on [Option] not pressed at startup = BASIC off (opposite from all other XL/XE machines) Andreas Magenheimer writes: Tip: The confused XEGS Atarian should use the XEGS manager by Mat*Rat (Mathew Ratcliff). This assumes one knows at least how to boot a disk with the XEGS... James Bradford offers: There is only 1 32K ROM in the XEGS, it has the OS, BASIC (Rev C) and Missile Command on it. The XE Game System was discontinued in 1992. Subject: 1.11) What are the 6502, ANTIC, CTIA/GTIA, POKEY, and FREDDIE chips? Some of the following text is taken from De Re Atari (Atari#APX-90008), a book published by Atari through the Atari Program Exchange (APX) and copyright 1982 by Chris Crawford, et al. See http://www.atariarchives.org/dere/ where the full text of De Re Atari is now available online. The internal layout of the Atari 8-bit computer is very different from other systems. It of course has a microprocessor (a 6502), RAM, ROM, and a PIA. However, it also has three special-purpose (LSI) chips known as ANTIC, GTIA, and POKEY. These chips were designed by Atari engineers primarily to take much of the burden of housekeeping off of the 6502, thereby freeing the 6502 to concentrate on computations. While they were at it, they designed a great deal of power into these chips. Each of these chips is almost as big (in terms of silicon area) as a 6502, so the three of them together provide a tremendous amount of power. Mastering the Atari 8-bit computers is primarily a matter of mastering these three chips. 6502 Central Processing Unit (CPU) ==== While the 400/800 models contain a generic 6502B CPU (a faster version of the original 6502A microprocessor), all of the XL/XE models contain Atari's customized 6502C chip. On the Atari, there are two microprocessors, ANTIC and the 6502. To allow them to coexist, ANTIC must shut off the 6502, a process called DMA. The 6502B supports DMA, but in Atari's implementation, it required 4 chips. The 6502C has an extra line called HALT. It is controlled by ANTIC which uses it whenever it needs the data/address bus. The HALT line is on pin 35 of the Atari 6502C and must be pulled high for the chip to work. ANTIC ===== ANTIC (\"Alpha-Numeric Television Interface Circuit\") is a microprocessor dedicated to the television display. It is a true microprocessor; it has an instruction set, a program (called the display list), and data. The display list and the display data are written into RAM by the 6502. ANTIC retrieves this information from RAM using direct memory access (DMA). It processes the higher level instructions in the display list and translates these instructions into a real-time stream of simple instructions to GTIA. Frank Schuster writes (6/1/02): the patent for the ANTIC processor: U.S. Patent 4,296,476 October 20, 1981 for a \"Data processing system with programmable graphics generator\". Inventors listed: Steven T. Mayer; Jay G. Miner; Douglas G. Neubauer; Joseph C. Decuir CTIA/GTIA ========= CTIA (\"Color Television Interface Adapter\") / GTIA (\"George's Television Interface Adapter\") is a television interface chip. ANTIC directly controls most of GTIA's operations, but the 6502 can be programmed to intercede and control some or all of GTIA's functions. GTIA converts the digital commands from ANTIC (or the 6502) into the signal that goes to the television. GTIA also adds some factors of its own, such as color values, player-missile graphics, and collision detection. Early 400/800 models included CTIA, later 400/800 models and all later 8-bit Ataris included GTIA. In BASIC, type POKE 623,64 [RETURN] and if the screen blackens, you have the GTIA chip. If it stays blue, you have the old CTIA chip. By the way, apparently no CTIA-equipped Ataris were shipped to Europe. Clay Halliwell provides this tidbit: A bit of trivia: CTIA 400/800s artifact in blue/green, GTIA 400/800s artifact in green/blue, and all XL/XEs artifact in red/blue. Jerry Jessop explains why French Ataris produce fewer colors: I will tell you why it only has monochrome out, because it's SECAM and a SECAM GTIA was never produced. The PAL GTIA is used in France and the Lum outputs are run into an onboard encoder to produce a \"psudo\" color depending on the Luminance output, composite only. This is why a SECAM VCS or 800 has nowhere near the same number of colors (16) availible as a PAL or NTSC unit (256). The FGTIA was never completed as the market size did not warrant the expense. The largest SECAM market is not France but the Soviet Union (former) and in 80-84 sales of these items there were not possible. Frank Schuster writes (6/1/02): ..here a summary of Atari patents covering technical parts of the GTIA / CTIA or at least the steps of development to it. I found them by following the references made in the \"newest\" patent 4,324,401 which at the end stands for the GTIA. U.S. Patent 4,324,401 April 13, 1982 for a \"Method and system for generating moving objects on a video display screen\". Inventors listed: David R. Stubben, Lyle V. Rains. References: 4,116,444; 4,107,665 U.S. Patent 4,189,728 February 19, 1980 for an \"Apparatus for generating a plurality of moving objects on a video display screen utilizing associative memory\". Inventor listed: David R. Stubben. References: 4,116,444; 4,045,789 U.S. Patent 4,116,444 September 26, 1978 for a \"Method for generating a plurality of moving objects on a video display screen\". Inventors listed: Steven T. Mayer; Ronald E. Milner. References: 4,016,362; 3,793,483 U.S. Patent 4,107,665 August 15, 1978 for an \"Apparatus for continuous variation of object size on a raster type video screen\". Inventors listed: Steven T. Mayer; Ronald E. Milner U.S. Patent 4,045,789 August 30, 1977 for a \"Animated video image display system and method\". Inventor listed: Stephen D. Bristow. References: 3,793,483 U.S. Patent 4,016,362 April 5, 1977 for a \"Multiple image positioning control system and method\". Inventors listed: Stephen D. Bristow; Steven T. Mayer. References: 3,793,483 U.S. Patent 3,793,483 February 19, 1974 for a \"Video Image Control System for Amusement Device\". Inventor listed: Nolan K. Bushnell POKEY ===== POKEY (means \"POT and KEY\" as in the paddles and keyboard) is a digital input/output (I/O) chip. It handles such disparate tasks as the serial I/O bus, audio generation, keyboard scan, and random number generation. It also digitizes the resistive paddle inputs and controls maskable interrupt (IRQ) requests from peripherals. All four of these LSI chips function simultaneously. Careful separation of their functions in the design phase has minimized conflicts between the chips. The only hardware level conflict between any two chips in the system occurs when ANTIC needs to use the address and data buses to fetch its display information. To do this, it halts the 6502 and takes control of the buses.\" The USPTO granted U.S. Patent 4,314,236 to Atari on February 2, 1982 for an \"Apparatus for producing a plurality of audio sound effects\" - POKEY. Inventors listed: Steven T. Mayer, Ronald E. Milner FREDDIE ======= The 65XE/130XE/800XE/XEGS contain a small additional LSI called FREDDIE, a RAM address multiplexer. According to James Bradford, \"FREDDIE is a type of memory controller. It takes the address and clock from the CPU and multiplexes it with the appropriate timings and signals to use DYNAMIC memory. FREDDIE also buffers the system clock crystal and divides it down then feeds that to GTIA. The XEGS has a FREDDIE but it doesn't have the extended RAM. Even if it did, you would still need the chip that does the REAL bank switching. It is a small 16-pin chip (Atari/Best Electronics catalog number CO25953: rev9/page 42). It gets RAS from FREDDIE, the bank select bits from PIA, A14, A15 and the 6502 halt signal to control which bank of 8 chips RAS goes to. A14 and A15 then go to FREDDIE for the address range of the extra memory bank (or normal address range with no bank switching). The ANTIC/6502 select bits in combination with the 6502 halt line, control the switching of the PIA bank number bits to A14/A15 and which bank of memory RAS goes to. Why people say FREDDIE does the bank switching is beyond me. An 800XL can look like a 130XE with that 16-pin chip installed (That's right NO FREDDIE) and an extra 8 RAM chips.\" And more recently James Bradford has written: FREDDIE is just a memory decoder and timer. It replaces several chips in the 800XL. The small chip near FREDDIE does all the bank selection. CO25953. One line from FREDDIE, Ras (or is it cas?) goes to this chip, Halt and the bank /processor select lines go into this same chip and ras (cas?) comes out. A pin for each bank. If I remember correctly, refresh also goes into this small chip. It would be quite easy to make an 800XL work just like a 130XE with this chip since Ras (Cas?) is required by ALL dynamic RAM. ====== Technical data and schematics for the ANTIC, GTIA, and POKEY chips are available on Curt Vendel's web site, thanks to permission from Hasbro's Atari Interactive Division's release of this data.

Contributors to this section: Wayne Booth, Graham Thornton, Brent Buescher Jr., Thomas Richter, Jindroush Some quick definitions first: NTSC standard: Abbreviation for \"National Television Standards Committee\" TV signal standard used in North America, Central America, a number of South American countries, and some Asian countries, including Japan. 525 lines per frame 60 half-frames per second (interlaced) = 60 Hz Complete frame refreshed 30 times per second PAL: Acronym for \"phase alternation by line\" TV signal standard used in the United Kingdom, much of the rest of western Europe, several South American countries, some Middle East and Asian countries, several African countries, Australia, New Zealand, and other Pacific island countries. 625 lines per frame 50 half-frames per second (interlaced) = 50 Hz Complete frame refreshed 25 times per second. PAL-M: A modified version of PAL, used in Brazil. SECAM: Acronym for \"systeme electronique couleur avec memoire\" TV signal standard used in France, eastern European countries, the former USSR, and some African countries. 625 lines per frame 50 half-frames per second (interlaced) = 50 Hz Complete frame refreshed 25 times per second. Now then, how do the differences among 8-bit Atari computers designed for the different world television signal standards affect users trying to use software written elsewhere in the world? The 50Hz vertical refresh frequency of PAL machines translates into more vertical blank interrupt (VBI) time for demos and other computation-intensive graphics software, when compared to the time available for VBIs on NTSC machines with the faster 60Hz refresh frequency. So PAL demos and games that won't work on NTSC machines are usually returning from a VBI too late. Some also attempt to use more vertical resolution (\"longer\" display lists) than an NTSC display can handle. Note that the reverse is also true. Software using VBIs will run more slowly on a PAL Atari than on an NTSC Atari. Replacing the NTSC ANTIC chip in an NTSC Atari with a PAL ANTIC changes the screen refresh rate to 50Hz, allowing most of the PAL-only European software to run on a North American NTSC Atari. However, make sure your display device can support a 50Hz PAL signal first! North American Atari users can also obtain and use real European PAL Atari machines, with the same caveat concerning the display device. Bottom line: Software written for NTSC machines (North America) will (almost) always work on PAL machines (Europe), but software designed on PAL machines won't necessarily work on NTSC machines. Jindroush contributes: (2/26/02) Could there be a program which runs on NTSC Atari and not on PAL Atari? Yes, if it uses some precise timing copy protection (probably based on vblank timing). Examples of these are Transylvania and The Quest by Penguin Software. Thomas Richter mentions another NTSC vs PAL issue: Another point is that the popular pseudo-colors used in the ANTIC-F (Graphics 8) mode are not colorful at all when displayed on a PAL TV, because of differences in the color encoding for the TV. The schematics of the XL computers include however a hack how to change the PAL version to the NTSC version (the PAL versions include two crystals, one with 5/4th of the frequency of the other. One is used for the system clock, the other for the color clock), but I never dared to apply it. Subject: 1.14) What are the pinouts for the various ports on the Atari?

Contributors to channel output variations list: Jon Levy, Rene de Bie, Sysop Fox-1 Most 8-bit Atari computers put out video signals in two places: 1) Radio-Frequency (RF) signal, VHF channel(s) selectable between two choices on many machines. Machine variations reported: NTSC 2-3 very common, NTSC 3-4 rare?, Euro-PAL 3-4, PAL-UK 38-39, Euro-PAL no switch, what channel? Richard Atkinson writes (3/02): I've seen switches for 1-2, 2-3 and 3-4, although some of these may have been PAL regions such as Australia or NTSC regions such as Japan. Here in UK PAL land, the video channel was standardized at Channel 36, so there is no need for such a switch. James Bradford adds (3/02): Here in Australia, most XL's don't have a channel switch. The track's there on the board though. Channel 1 is used. On the 400/800, the channel switch is for 1 or 2, but since channel 2 is used here, only channel 1 is used due to lack of interference. Accessories needed: a) RF Cable. (RF=radio frequency--video and audio signals in the same line) On the 400/800 models, the RF Cable does not detach from the computer. The output end of the cable is an RCA male connector. b) TV Switch Box. Includes an RCA female connector for RF signal input from the Atari, input connector(s) for your TV attenna and/or cable TV company, and 75- and/or 300-ohm VHF output connector(s) for connection to the VHF input on the television. (Radio Shack carries a suitable TV Switch Box.) 2) A proprietary 5-pin DIN Monitor Jack, which includes two video signals: a) Composite video. b) Y/C Video, also known as S-Video: separate composite luminance (Y) and chrominance (C) signals. Exceptions among the computer models: -the 400 and North American 600XL lack the Monitor Jack. -the XE Game System includes an RCA-style jack in place of the Monitor Jack, providing a plain composite video signal only. -the Monitor Jack on the 600XL, 800XL and 1200XL lacks the separate chrominance signal. (But it exists internally, and can be restored to the monitor jack via hardware modification.) The pinout for the Atari Monitor Jack is in the pinouts sections of this FAQ list. The typical Atari Monitor Cable includes the male 5-pin DIN connector on one end, and two RCA male connectors on the other end. One of the RCA connectors will carry the monophonic sound signal, and the other will carry the composite video signal. Color composite monitors were common in the mid-80's, but these days many televisions have an RCA female composite video input connector which works fine with the Atari. You may find an Atari Monitor Cable where the video signal carried on the second RCA connector is not the composite video signal, but the composite luminance signal. These cables are for use with monochrome composite video monitors (usually green or amber). The ideal Atari Monitor Cable includes 3 RCA male connectors on the output end, carrying the sound signal, the composite luminance signal, and the composite chrominance signal. Only the best composite monitors include separate chrominance and luminance inputs. Commodore produced many fine monitors of this type, popular with Atari users. Lonnie McClure provides this information on suitable Commodore monitors: 1701, 1702, 1802, CM-141, 1080, 2002, 1902, 1902A*, 1084**, 1084S** * The 1902A used a DIN connector for chroma/luma, which makes cabling a bit more of a problem. The composite and audio connectors are standard RCA jacks, however. ** The 1084 and 1084S had more than one version. Some used the a DIN connector for chroma/luma connections, like the 1902A, while some used standard RCA jacks. The 1902 and 1902A are very different in appearance. The original 1902 shares the same slightly rounded front case design as the 1080 and 2002, while the 1902A is has a rather square case design, and was manufactured by Magnavox (as were some of the 1084 and 1084S versions). The separate composite chrominance and luminance signals that the Atari puts out comprise what the world has since come to call Y/C video or S-video. S-video connectors are normally Mini4. It is possible to build a cable, or purchase several adapters, that can allow you to utilize the separate Y/C signals generated by the Atari with a television (or other display device) that provides a standard S-video Mini4 input jack. This is the ultimate display option for the 8-bit Atari. Clarence Dyson has a nice page about such a project at http://www.wolfpup.net/atari/svideo.html . Adapters also exist that will take in composite video or s-video, and output a conversion of the signal as a standard VGA video signal. These are often known as a \"VGA converter\" or \"Scan doubler.\" With such a device, the 8-bit Atari can be used with a standard PC VGA monitor. One such adapter is the Cheese Video Box, from TV One, http://www.tvone.com/. An earlier popular device was the JAM!! from AIMS Lab. Subject: 3.1) What are the Atari 410, 1010, XC11, and XC12 Program Recorders? The Atari Program Recorders provide storage and retrieval of programs and data on cassette tape. In addition to the digital track that stores computer data, a second audio track is provided to play music or voice as the program runs. Data transmission rate: 600 bits per second. Data storate capacity: 100,000 bytes per 60-minute cassette. Track configuration: 4 track, 2 channel (digital data and audio track) 410 Program Recorder - early Japan version had a carrying handle - most versions made in Hong Kong - 410a--Taiwan version - built-in SIO cable - must end SIO daisy chain - power - plugs directly into wall 1010 Program Recorder - Chelco version has Stop/Eject, then Pause buttons - Sanyo version has Pause, then Stop/Eject buttons - two SIO ports XC11 Program Recorder - has a built-in SIO cable and one SIO port XC12 Program Recorder - built-in SIO cable - must end SIO daisy chain - Information on the Turbo 6000 Baud Interface and the Chaos Loader: http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~sgl/atari/turb6000/turb6000.htm Subject: 3.2) What other cassette recorders can I use with my Atari? Firstly Atari themselves put out several models beyond the 410/1010/XC11/XC12, generally only known in eastern Europe: XCA12 Program Recorder -in same case as XC12...Poland CA12 Program Recorder -in same case as XC12...Poland image: http://romualdl.multimania.com/images/atari/ca12.jpg XL12 Program Recorder -XC12 w/slight changed design. Czech/Slovak/Poland XC13 Program Recorder -XC12 which was \"T2000 ready\". Czech/Slovak/Poland For more information on the Turbo 2000 (T2000) and SuperTurbo modifications to Atari program recorders, with speeds up 9600 baud, see http://jindroush.atari.org Unlike other microcomputer systems of the time, it was very unusual to use anything but Atari brand program cassette recorders. One third-party product released was the: Compu-Mate, by General Electric (GE, G.E.) Includes external interface module, a power cord/adapter, and SIO cable. No second SIO port - must be at end of SIO chain. Subject: 3.3) How do I run a program from cassette? To run an Atari BASIC program from cassette: 1. Place the cassette in the recorder. 2. Press REWIND of FORWARD, if necessary, to bring the tape to the position where the program is located. 3. Boot the computer to the Atari BASIC READY prompt. 4. There are several possibilities for the next step, depending on how the program was saved, and whether you want to run the program or just load it into RAM. Enter one of the following four commands: a. CLOAD loads programs saved with CSAVE b. LOAD \"C:\" loads programs saved with SAVE \"C:\" c. ENTER \"C:\" loads programs saved with LIST \"C:\" d. RUN \"C:\" loads&runs programs saved with SAVE \"C:\" ] Relative efficiency of the three cassette tape recording techniques: ] CSAVE/CLOAD - most efficient - fastest saves/loads - tokenized files ] SAVE \"C:\"/LOAD \"C:\" - middle efficiency - middle speed - tokenized files ] LIST \"C:\"/ENTER \"C:\" - least efficient - slowest - straight ATASCII 5. The computer will \"beep\" as a signal for you to press PLAY on the recorder. 6. Press the RETURN key on the computer keyboard, and the program will load into the computer. 7. Press STOP on the recorder when loading has finished. 8. Unless you entered RUN \"C:\" above, now enter the command: RUN To run an Atari BASIC or machine language program from cassette upon startup: 1. Place the cassette in the recorder 2. Press REWIND of FORWARD, if necessary, to bring the tape to the position where the program is located. 3. Turn on the computer while holding down the START key. But if your computer has Atari BASIC built-in and you're running a machine language program, hold down both the START key and the OPTION key. 4. The computer will \"beep\" as a signal for you to press PLAY on the recorder. 5. Let go of the START/OPTION button(s). 6. Press the RETURN key on the computer keyboard, and the program will load into the computer. 7. Press STOP on the recorder when loading is complete and the program is running.

That's a no-no. Most of the time it's Okay, but about 1 in 10, 20 times, it will blow out 'U-1'. It's a CA/LM 3086 I.C. at the right, rear of the main board. A 14 pin DIL chip. Actually it is an array of 5 transistors. Unplug the power pack from the 1050, then unplug the SIO cable. Power can be ON on the CPU. The problem has to do with the secondary winding of the Power Pack. Remember, the problem only occurs 1 out of 10 - 20 times that you do it, not all the time. It doesn't really matter if the 1050 Transformer has power on or off, it 'Might' happen if plugged into the 1050. It is really bad on 810's. One thing, if the system has been turned off for, oh say, 5 - 10 minutes it won't matter. By then all the capacitors should be bled(sc?) to 0 volts. ==> Atari XF551 --- a 5.25\" floppy disk drive.

Russ Gilbert writes: If you're talking standard computer store, you can't use those 5 1/4\" disks. I mean you can't use high density disks. They must be double density to use with the 1050. Almost all double density 5 1/4\" disks have a hub ring, high density disks don't have the hub ring. RHamiIton5 elaborates: (5/12/01) The Atari 8 drives do not have write heads and circuity which can handle the type of oxide coating used on the high density floppy media; they cannot write reliably to them. The hub ring has just become a sort of marker to distinguish the high density from the standard double density diskettes. Way back in your apple days of '79-'82, most disks were hubless and only the really premium brands offered hubs to prevent slippage and out of round problems; you could even buy little kits for adding you own hub rings. When the home computer swell really hit around '83 and price wars began, hub rings became common on good disks and eventually became standard down to include most generic bargain diskettes. The introduction of high density 5.25's required a different coercivity (= magnetizability) to get more bits in a smaller space and suitable electronics to do it. These disks were produced hubless; was it a differentiating label or just unnecessary because of stronger mylar construction? Anyone? Subject: 3.7) How can I use a hard drive with my 8-bit Atari? Atari never produced hard drives for the 8-bit Atari, but a variety of options have been produced over the years. No common DOS version was written with drives the size of hard drives in mind, and very few 8-bit Atari users have owned hard drives for the Atari. Yet, if you're serious about it, a hard drive can make a tremendous addition to your system! A couple of these options are hard drives designed specifically for the 8-bit Atari computers; the rest are interfaces designed to let you attach an industry standard SASI, SCSI, or IDE type hard drive. Customized software (OS, DOS) is often involved as well.

This section by Andreas Magenheimer. Atari Ramdisks - the first try of an (incomplete) Overview: [This is version 2.0 from October 2002] Right from the start of the Atari 8-bit computer era in the late 70`s, Atari users wanted to have as much RAM as possible (or as their purse could afford). Having a 16k machine with a tape device was nice and cheap, but having full 48k or 64k and a floppy drive was much nicer (and very expensive). Thus many Atari users began to create selfmade RAM extensions and enhancements, just to save some money. Also a lot of firms provided extra RAM, RAM enhancements, RAM extensions and Ramdisks. Besides Atari there were (and still are) quite a lot of producers, manufacturers, distributors and authors of such RAM enhancements... This \"short\" and incomplete overview does not provide any docs or manuals, but gives some info about the various Ramdisks on the market. Since these notes are written by me, they will merely contain the information I have. And as you all can see - it isn`t much information. So any help and extra info, as well as corrections, are very welcome. It would be nice to see this text & info growing. For now let us start here, the info-section is divided into 8 groups: 1) Name (Name of the RD, e.g. Megaram 2 or Rambo XL or MIO, etc.); 2) Vendor/Author (or distributor, manufacturer, producer, etc.); 3) Size (size of the Ramdisk only; NOT the full computer memory); 4) [Bankswitching] Area (for XL/XE computers usually 4000-7FFF); 5) Banks (hexadecimal input count, as in MyDOS or RAMDTEST.BIN); 6) Control Bits (which bits are used to control the Rambanks); 7) Port (control Port - usually Port B for XL/XE machines); 8) Notes (any extra info, comments, miscelleanous things, etc.); If you wish to add any other type of info, let me know. The above information should be enough for most programmers to support a RD in their programs (especially to support more than just one type of RD). Hopefully future programs will take care about this info or just use a small setup program to setup any kind of RD. Now let me begin: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A) Atari 400/800 Ramdisks: Name Vendor Size Area Banks Bits Port Notes - Axlon Axlon/Atari 64k 4000-7FFF 0 thru 3 0,1 (CFFF) plug-in-board Note: total memory = 96kbytes (32k RAM + 64k RD); - Axlon Axlon/Atari 128k 4000-7FFF 0 thru 7 0,1,2 (CFFF) plug-in-board Note: total memory = 160kbytes (32k RAM + 128k RD); - 288k800 D.Byrd and others 256k 4000-7FFF 0 thru 15 0,1,2,3 (CFFF) selfmade-board Note: total memory = 288kbytes, Axlon compatible; - 544k800 various authors 512k 4000-7FFF 0 thru 31 0,1,2,3,4 (CFFF) selfmade-board Note: total memory = 544kbytes, Axlon compatible; - 1056k800 various authors 1024k 4000-7FFF 0 thru 63 0,1,2,3,4,5 (CFFF) selfmade-board Note: total memory = 1056kbytes, Axlon compatible; - 2080k800 various authors 2048k 4000-7FFF 0 thru 127 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 (CFFF) selfmade-board Note: total memory = 2080kbytes, Axlon compatible; - 4128k800 various authors 4096k 4000-7FFF 0 thru 255 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 (CFFF) selfmade-board Note: total memory = 4128kbytes, Axlon compatible; => Note that all so-called Axlon \"compatible\" (256k-4096k) Ramdisks normally do not homebank when RESET is pressed (a fix should be available somewhere), whereas original Axlon Ramdisks do homebank properly !! (Special thanks to Lee Barnes for this note !!) - Mosaic RAMpower by Mosaic Electronics is actually a Ramboard, that enhances the memory of your Atari 800; avaiable in 3 sizes: 16k, 32k and 64k (where max. 52k can be utilized from 64k). Looks like these are no Ramdisks, just (normal/main) RAM enhancements. But maybe the 64k Ramboard can be patched in some way to gain a small 16k or 32k Ramdisk (48k RAM + 16k RD or 32k RAM + 32k RD) ?!? - ... --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B) Atari XL/XE Ramdisks: Name Vendor Size Area Bits Port Banks Notes => Note that bit 4 is always used in all Port B type memory upgrades to turn on the CPU's access to the extended memory. Thus, it is not reported in bit use tables as a used bit as it does not control which bank gets switched into the 4000-7FFF region. This seems to be a standard convention as the majority of ramdisk users don't want bit 4 counted as a control bit. And it's not a control bit - its the 'on' bit. Likewise, bit 5 is the 'on' bit for ANTIC's access to the extended memory for 'compatible' (to 130XE) machines as well. If bit 5 does show up in a bit use table, one can only assume that this is an incompatible machine which doesn't have or use ANTIC access at all. In that special case, bit 5 is then available for use in switching in the various banks and thus gets counted as a control bit in bit use tables.

Some third-party printers were marketed for use with the Atari 8-bit computers: Alphacom 42 + Atari interface cartridge - requires 850 Interface or equivalent - thermal - 4 1/2\" width paper - supports complete ATASCII character set Axiom AT-100 / GP-100AT (= Seikosha GP-100A ) - built-in Atari interface, cable and connector, 2nd SIO port for daisy-chain - dot matrix - early model 30-cps, later version 50 cps - Graph-AX graphics software package Axiom GP-550AT (by Seikosha) - built-in Atari interface, cable and connector, 2nd SIO port - dot matrix - 86 cps draft, 43 cps NLQ - Graph-AX graphics software package Axiom GP-700AT (by Seikosha) - built-in Atari interface, cable and connector, 2nd SIO port - 4 hammer print heads, 4-color ribbon cartridge - 25 colors - 50 cps - Graph-AX graphics software package Epson HomeWriter 10 - plug-in cartridge interface for the Atari - 80 column dot-matrix printer - draft quality printing at 100 cps and near letter quality at 16 cps General Electric GE 3-8100 / TXP 1000 - GE Printer Interface Module for Atari - dot-matrix - 50 cps draft, 25 cps NLQ Okidata Okimate 10 Personal Color Printer - available Plug 'n Print Interface for Atari - a thermal printer. - single-sheet or tractor-feed paper. - 26 colors - 240 words per minutes Beyond the above printer models, most any \"industry-standard\" line printer can work well with the Atari. For many years, most printers marketed for home use could be classified into one of two categories: parallel or serial interface. Parallel line printers are much more commonly used than serial line printers, with the Epson MX/FX/LX series defining the market. The most common way to use an industry standard printer with the Atari has been to attach it through the 15-pin 8-bit parallel port of the Atari 850 Interface Module or equivalent (such as the ICD P:R: Connection). One gotcha here is that the 850's parallel port is DB15, where the PC world ended-up standardizing on a DB25 configuration. So you need to find or build a cable that provides the DB15 connector for the Atari end (and Centronics-type parallel connector on the printer end) when attaching a standard parallel printer to the Atari through an Atari 850 or equivalent. Many 3rd-party disk drives for the Atari (along with the XEP80 Interface Module) do include a DB25 parallel printer port, rendering the need for an Atari-specific printer cable unnecessary. The Atari 850 Interface Module and equivalents also provide standard DB9 serial RS232C ports, permitting use of standard serial line printers with the Atari. But this is much less common than parallel, both in the Atari world and in the industry at large. Some folks have connected more modern inkjet and laser printers with parallel connections to the 8-bit Atari with success. Graphics printouts from the Atari may be less than ideal (look for a printer with an Epson MX/FX/LX printer series emulation mode), but these types of printers should work fine for plain text output if they can handle simple line print jobs. Anyone want to contribute their experiences to be included here? Bob Woolley wrote on Sun, 14 Apr 2002: I use HP LaserJet 4Ps on my Ataris. They are one of the last front panel selectable cheap printers - from which you can select your default fonts, etc. The newer laser printers can only set fonts and operating modes thru the interface, not impossible, but not as easy as selecting on the panel. This does allow you to print just about any point size of the internal fonts in the printer on your Atari. Either way, you really have to do a little work to get properly formatted output from a word processor. I have managed to use the proportional font setting with AtariWriter and printer driver creation utilities to get good results. Mathy van Nisselroy provides an AtariWriter printer driver for the HP LaserJet here: http://www-users.rwth-aachen.de/mathy.van_nisselroy/stuff.htm Modern printers designed for home markets now tend to provide USB connectors. So far, I'm not aware of any options for connecting a USB device to the Atari. Subject: 5.1) What are the Atari 830, 835, 1030, XM301, and SX212 Modems? A MODulator/DEModulator translates digital information from your computer into acoustic tones that can be sent and received, from modem to modem, via standard telephone lines. Atari produced several modems for use with the 8-bit Atari computers: Atari 830 Acoustic Modem: ( = Novation 'CAT' ) - a stand-alone, acoustically coupled, frequency shift keying (FSK) modem - up to 300 bits per second - Bell 103/113 modem compatible - requires Atari 850 Interface Module or equivalent Atari 835 Direct Connect Modem: - 300 bps - Bell 103/113 modem compatible Atari 1030 Direct Connect Modem: - 300 bps - Bell 103/113 modem compatible - built-in ModemLink software. - 2 SIO ports Atari XM301 Modem: - 300 bps - Bell 103/113 modem compatible - with XE Term disk software - permanent SIO cable, must be at end of SIO chain - draws its power from the computer via SIO Atari SX212 Modem: - SIO & DB25 RS232 serial ports, must be at end of SIO chain - 1200 baud - Bell 103/113/212A modem compatible - rarely with SX-Express! disk software. Subject: 5.2) What other modems can I use with my Atari? Some third-party modems were marketed for use with the Atari 8-bit computers: ==> Microconnection, by Microperipheral Corp. 300 bps, Bell 103 compatible, T-SMART software, pulse dialing (not touch tone) Four versions: buss-decoding version does not require 850 Interface or equivalent, includes DB25 parallel printer interface, with or without autodial Plain version requires 850 Interface or equivalent, with or without autodial and autoanswer ==> MPP-1000C, by Microbits Peripheral Products 300 baud, joystick port 2, Smart Terminal cartridge ==> MPP-1000E, by Microbits Peripheral Products 300 baud, joystick port 2, Smart Term software From: \"Steven J Tucker\" Sun, 13 Jan 2002 16:14:38 -0500 The 1000E..had this strange problem in that it could never hang up the phone ==> MPP-1200A, by Microbits Peripheral Products Released?

These have been commonly sold for PCs for many years. The Hayes Smartmodem more or less defined the market for these, initially. One common way to use an industry standard external serial modem with the Atari is to connect it to the SIO port via an Advanced Interface Devices (A.I.D., later Supra) R-Verter Serial Bus Modem Adapter cable, or equivalent. The other common way to use an industry standard external serial modem with the Atari is to attach it through the 9-pin RS232C serial port of the Atari 850 Interface Module or equivalent (such as the ICD P:R: Connection). One gotcha here is that the serial port on the 850 is DB9 female, where the PC world ended up standardizing on a DB9 male connector for this purpose. But gender converters are readily available. For using modems at speeds of 2400 bps and up with the Atari, it will be useful to have an understanding of data flow control. Here is a definition of flow control from www.modems.com: Often, one modem in a connection is capable of sending data much faster than the other can receive. Flow control allows the receiving modem to tell the other to pause while it catches up. Flow control exists as either software, or XON/XOFF, flow control, or hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control. With software flow control, when a modem needs to tell the other to pause, it sends a certain character, usually Control-S. When it is ready to resume, it sends a different character, such as Control-Q. Software flow control's only advantage is that it can use a serial cable with only three wires. Since software flow control regulates transmissions by sending certain characters, line noise could generate the character commanding a pause, thus hanging the transfer until the proper character (such as Control-Q) is sent. Also, binary files must never be sent using software flow control, as binary files can contain the control characters. Hardware, or RTS/CTS, flow control uses wires in the modem cable or, in the case of internal modems, hardware in the modem. This is faster and much more reliable than software flow control. Some 2400 bps modems, and probably all modems with 9600 bps speed capabilities and up, normally use V.42 standard error correction and V.42bis standard data compression. But V.42 requires either software or hardware flow control, and V.42bis requires hardware flow control (and V.42 error correction). Hardware flow control is not available with the Atari 850's serial ports. As a result, just before dialing out with your Atari telecom software, it's usually desirable, if not necessary, to disable your modem's flow control. The Hayes modem command to disable flow control looks like: AT&K0 The top speed of the Atari 850's serial ports is 9600 bps. Clay Halliwell offers a tip on utilizing 9600 bps through the 850 Interface: On 11 Feb 1996, Marc G. Frank said: > I'm having problems getting a modem attached to my Atari 850 to > communicate at 9600 baud. When I set my communications program to 2400 > baud, everything works fine. However, when I set it to 9600 baud, the > modem echoes my characters but doesn't act on them. That is, at 2400, The problem with the 850 is that some of them (like mine) don't produce a PERFECT 9600 baud signal. As a result modems can't train on it, and while they will echo characters back, for some nitpicky reason they won't pick up on the \"AT\" attention code. The solution is to do all your dialing at 2400 baud, but set the S37 register to force the modem to try to connect at 9600. Then switch your Atari to 9600 after connecting. Through the use of an ICD MIO or a CSS Black Box, it is possible to utilize modems at speeds up to 14.4 Kbps (V.32bis) at full speed with no loss of data. The serial R: device handler for the Black Box supports hardware flow control natively. Optional for the Black Box, but essential for the MIO, is the HyperSpeed handler by Len Spencer.

While the Atari's SIO and controller ports did not conform to established industry standards, Atari produced the 850 Interface Module to address this issue. The 850 connects to the SIO port on the Atari, and provides: - four 9-pin serial EIA RS232C ports - One 15-pin 8-bit parallel Centronics-type port Many \"industry standard\" (of the time) printers, modems, and various other devices can be used with the Atari computer in combination with an 850 Interface Module. Early 850's are in an all metal (black) case, but most are in a plastic beige case matching the 400/800 computers. Other features: - programmable baud rate on any port, including: 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, and 9600 bps; baudot speeds of 60, 66, 75, 100 words per minute - uses standard ASCII. Baudot support for radio-teletype (RTTY). PINOUTS 850 R1: Serial port DB9P: 5 4 3 2 1 ____________________________ 9 8 7 6 / DB25P 1. DTR - Data Terminal Ready (out) + 20 2.

Perhaps the most prominent example of such a product is the P:R: Connection from ICD. Subject: 6.2) What is the Atari XEP80 Interface Module? This text written by Thomas Raukamp. Since the development of the Atari 8-bit line of computers in 1979, users wanted better text displays than the default 40x24. There has been some attempts to satisfy this need, like the Austin-Franklin board or the Ace 80/80xl cartridge. For more informations about these modifications read The Atari 8-bit Hardware Upgrade FAQ from David A. Paterson. The Atari XEP80 Interface Module is Atari's entry to the 80 column field. It lets a XL, XE, 400 or 800 computer system display a full 80 columns across your monitor screen. The XEP80 provides a 256-character wide by 25-line display window. Up to 80 characters are displayed horizontally at once, and you can scroll horizontally all the way to the 256th character, depending on the application you're running. The XEP80 is connected to your system via a joystick port. The XEP80 Module interprets commands from the computer for screen display or output to a printer. The module is supplied with an industry-standard 8-bit parallel port so you can connect a parallel printer to your Atari 8-bit (I even use a "
