        "text": "The best retro consoles in 2024 come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and ages. While it's easy to just rhyme off a bunch of original systems, there are plenty of modern devices and accessories that can provide easier access to the classics. Not to mention modern benefits like HDMI output can provide your childhood outings with a glow-up when connected to new TVs and monitors.\n\nWhether you fully believe Genesis does what Nintendon't or you were brought up by a Nintendo Entertainment system, there are tons of ways to revisit retro consoles today. Mini plug-and-play systems like the NES Classic Edition are no longer in production, but brands are still bringing out tiny versions of old hardware that are both collectible and convenient. Excellent new accessories are also available for those of you who like to keep things authentic with OG hardware, and you'd be surprised how good old games can look when you don't have to use a scrappy old antenna to tune them in.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the best retro game consoles we've tested, alongside some games to watch out for and must-have add-ons for your original systems. Some of our choices focus on convenience and price, whereas some are based on catering to enthusiasts, meaning there's something to suit all budgets and preferences below.\n\nThe best retro console for Nintendo games\n\nWith the success of and overwhelming demand for the NES Mini Classic, a 16-bit follow up was virtually guaranteed. And here we are - once again, Nintendo has knocked it out of the park by providing a library of essential games inside a faithful, adorable replica of the original SNES.\n\nBesides being hugely nostalgic, these games represent some of the era's best; they're classics that changed the industry in fundamental ways. Whether it's Super Mario World or Street Fighter 2, these are games that inspired generations. They aren't museum pieces, either. The likes of Yoshi's Island, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and Super Punch-Out! are still as engaging today as they were in the heyday of the SNES.\n\nThey're displayed at their very best here thanks to a suite of display options. These range from fuzzy CRT emulation to crisp HD output, rewind and suspend options, and a bucketful of the kind of fun Nintendo Easter eggs you'd expect from one of the best retro game consoles available. Even though the issue of controller cord length persists - it’s longer, but still nowhere near long enough for living room setups - it’s hard to imagine a more slickly packaged, densely concentrated dose of retro goodness.\n\nThat's true no matter which side of the Atlantic you're on. While US readers get the North American model with its sleek purple accents, UK fans are able to revisit their unique version with primary-colored buttons on the joypad. Perfection.\n\nPlay these first: Super Mario World | The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past | Super Metroid | Yoshi's Island | Secret of Mana | Earthbound\n\nRead more: SNES Mini hands-on\n\nThe best retro console for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games\n\nIf you're a SEGA fan from a time when Sonic had just arrived and the Biker Mice From Mars were still a thing on TV, you're in luck - the SEGA Genesis Mini (or Mega Drive if you're in the UK) is the best retro game console for you. From an adorably dinky console with a cartridge slot you can actually open for 'blowing away dust' to its authentic packaging, this is a system that excels at the little things. It even has original menu music by the 16-bit era legend Yuzo Koshiro, created using authentic tools of the day.\n\nThen there's bang-for-buck. Thanks to 42 all-time classic games (and bios on the significance of each one), the Genesis Mini offers better value for money than most. It's an excellently handled throwback to another time that'll hit you right in the nostalgic feels.\n\nPlay these first: Sonic The Hedgehog | Gunstar Heroes | Streets of Rage 2 | Mega Man: The Wily Wars | Castlevania: Bloodlines | Contra: Hard Corps\n\nRead more: SEGA Genesis Mini review\n\nThe best retro console for PlayStation games\n\nThe original PlayStation holds an interesting spot in the landscape of the evolution of gaming. It was amongst the first (and certainly the most popular) console to truly push the 3D frontier, expanding beyond the flat 2D planes of gaming's primitive origins and launching a revolution that would define the future of the medium.\n\nFor some, it's iconic, and rightfully so: games like Final Fantasy VII and Resident Evil, both included on the PlayStation Classic, are some of the most revered titles in gaming. They also shaped the landscape of gaming for years to come.\n\nAlthough some high profile exclusions like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night or Grand Turismo rankle a bit, Sony has done an excellent job picking a slate of titles that's broad enough to represent one of the most diverse libraries in console history. The whole package is a great nostalgia-trip not only for anyone looking to relive the mid-90s, but also for anyone who's played the endless flood of sequels to these games and wonders where those series originated.\n\nPlay these first: | Final Fantasy VII | Grand Theft Auto | Metal Gear Solid | Resident Evil: Director's Cut | Tekken 3\n\nRead more: PlayStation Classic review\n\nThe best retro gaming handheld\n\nWe've seen a lot of seriously dodgy retro handheld emulators knocking around the net over the last few years, but now we have an officially licensed product that really appeals to our old-school sensibilities - the Evercade.\n\nThe Evercade is a little different from the other retro consoles on this list as it actually comes with game collection cartridges that you can buy separately in order to build up a sweet retro selection. These boxed collections include between six and 20 games from the likes of Namco, Atari, Interplay, Technos, Data East, Mega Cat Studios, Piko Interactive and more at around $20 / £15 per cartridge. While you'll have to pick these up separately, slotting each cartridge in and building up your collection evokes its own separate sense of nostalgia, making this one of the best retro game console experiences on the market.\n\nThe PSP-sized display is wonderfully crisp and clear and you have the option to switch between the original 4:3 aspect ratio or stretch things out to 16:9 if you want to take advantage of the full screen. The handheld console feels great in the hand too, even if the button layout takes some getting used to for the Mega-Drive/Genesis titles. While we're expecting more retailers to take orders soon, it's available to order from Amazon now.\n\nPlay these first: | Namco Collection 2 | Atari Collection 1 | Technos 1 | Data East Collection\n\nRead more: Evercade review\n\nThe best retro console for arcade games\n\nEven though Retro-Bit stumbled with 2016's Generations (a deservedly maligned attempt to create a foothold in the retro emulation market), this follow-up seems to take that criticism on board.\n\nTo begin with, there are marked improvements in emulation quality. Despite its white shell lacking contours or much other visual flair, the superior feature-set also impresses. 720p video output sits alongside RCA for connecting to older CRTs, two sturdy controllers with ten-foot cables are included, and a flashy library of 90 games represents a huge, eclectic swath of 8 and 16-bit classics. That line-up features some games which have never been available domestically. Alongside classics like Mega Man and Ghosts N’ Goblins, you can try lesser known (but still excellent) coin-op titles like Side Arms and Wizard Fire.\n\nIn short, the Retro-Cade is a great addition to any retro collection and a convincing argument for Retro-Bit staking out a permanent position as one of the best retro game console brands.\n\nPlay these first: | Mega Man 2 | Burger Time | Double Dragon | Ghosts'n Goblins\n\nThe best retro console for Atari games\n\nWhile AtGames’ Sega Genesis console is an abomination, its Atari Flashback line of machines are well made and offer an exhaustively detailed option for revisiting the game console grandpappy’s library. 120 games come pre-installed in the Flashback 8, including most of the Atari-published essentials like Adventure, Yar’s Revenge and Swordquest. Although they are emulated, they do run properly.\n\nWhile it’s MSRP is a bit pricey, the Flashback 8 makes up for its relatively high cost by also including great controller options, including two wireless joysticks and two paddles for paddle-specific games like Warlords. It also offers proper 720p HDMI output and pause, save, and rewind functionality.\n\nPlay these first: Missile Command | Asteroids | Yars' Revenge | Pitfall! | Adventure\n\nThe best retro console for microcomputer games\n\nIf you were a huge fan of the Commodore 64 or feel waves of nostalgia sweeping through your body after a glimpse of that bright red joystick and beige keyboard, the C64 Mini was made specifically for you. While it's a console that comes with some caveats, like a joystick that's extremely stiff and limited and a couple of high profile titles missing from it's otherwise generous catalog (you won't find Wasteland, Skate or Die, or Elite here), it's delightful little shell is packed with retro fun that will transport you back to the era of stained-washed jeans and hair metal.\n\nA surprising number of the 64 included games are still a huge amount of fun to play, especially if you're looking to jump around in a frenetic platformer, or immerse yourself in the deadly, futuristic racing league of Alleykat. While there are a lot of games that fall into similar niches (platformers and scrolling shooters are available in abundance), there are enough distinctive standouts to remind you why the original C64 was the best selling home computer of all time.\n\nPlus, unlike most of the best retro games consoles on this list, you can also port your own ROMs into the system as well.\n\nPlay these first: Impossible Mission | Uridium | California Games | Boulder Dash | Bounder\n\nRead more: C64 Mini review\n\nThe best retro console for Capcom games\n\nAlthough it looks ungainly and is a little snug when you’re using it with a second player, the goodies contained within make it all worthwhile (and let’s be honest, it does capture that sense of jostling shoulders with your friends in front of an arcade machine). That's partially because of its lineup of classic games and range of screen settings that offer sharp visuals - even when displayed in 4K - but a lot of the credit goes to how it feels in use.\n\nIts developers made the decision to build the Capcom Home Arcade with authentic Sanwa arcade pieces, and that results in a comfortingly tactile feel which boasts an oh-so-satisfying 'click'. It's a move that significantly increases this console's price, but it's also one that pays off in a big way.\n\nPlay these first: Street Fighter II | Final Fight | Ghouls'n Ghosts | Darkstalkers | Super Puzzle Fighter II\n\nThe best retro console for Neo-Geo games\n\nThe Neo-Geo Mini is an eye-catching piece of kit; it recreates the Neo-Geo arcade cabinets of yesteryear in cute micro form, complete with its own 3.5-inch LCD screen that'll send you hurtling back to the 1990s faster than listening to Smells Like Teen Spirit. When combined with stereo speakers and arcade controls, it's as authentic an experience as you could hope for.\n\nHappily, that LCD panel is crisp and bright - it's the perfect companion for the console's 40 classic games. Even though it can be used on a TV, the Neo-Geo Mini is definitely at its best as is.\n\nIt doesn't look great blown up on the big screen and its joystick lacks that ever-important tactile feedback. However, it's still a good Neo-Geo experience overall.\n\nPlay these first: Metal Slug 3 | Garou: Mark of the Wolves | The Last Blade | Shock Troopers: 2nd Squad | Blazing Star"
