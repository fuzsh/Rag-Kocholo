Knowing what I know now it would have gone quicker, but it's still a ton of work that doesn't need to be done. I don't know how to write code to automate this though.\n\nI'm looking for a way to automate the first 10 lines for the different items for every game.\n\nThen I'm looking for a way to \"scrape\" the data from individual text files that are named the same as the rom file names to get all of the game synopsis data. Here is an example of the synopsis file called \"Astro Chase.txt\".\n\nAstro Chase Platform: Atari 5200 Region: USA Media: Cartridge Controller: 5200 Joystick Genre: Shoot 'em Up - Multi-Directional Gametype: Licensed Release Year: 1983 Developer: First Star Software Publisher: Parker Brothers Players: 1 Programmer: Fernando Herrera _________________________ As pilot of a spaceship, your job is to save the planet Earth!

I'd rather not have to write this all by hand cause it would probably take me years to do. I was hoping some of the coding wizards here might be able to write a script to automate this for me. Preferably something that could be used in Windows.\n\nAll of this data has been scraped and collected years ago by a group I was a part of. With a small alteration of the file system we established and the XML files to get the data to load in RetroPie it is all easily adapted to the Pi from the system we originally made it for.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDITED TO ADD: I made 4 alternate versions of the XML to test the other images in the collection. They changed the \"cart\", \"titles\", etc tags to <image> so they would show up in the skins and they all worked great.\n\nSkins could probably be made to easily change from one type of artwork preview to another or to even show multiple previews at once, or a piece of art as well as a video at the same time.\n\nI'm not exactly sure how the RetroPie could take advantage of the Manuals and Gamefaqs zips, but they would all be there and pointed to in the XML for each game. Our existing system is able to easily load the manuals and gamefaqs for every game that has them within the in-game front end menus.\n\n@herb_fargus We've actually got everything uploaded, but it's not presented like GamesDB or other sites. There are packages that have been out there for about 8 years now too that in total are easily over 100GB, not including PSX or N64. Unfortunately, I can't actually give any links to anything because roms are included.\n\nMy plan here, once I've read the rules of course, is to put together a few small packages that anybody would be able to put in the proper place on their SD card that coupled with the XML files would run right out of the box. The only thing in these packs that would not be provided are the roms (I don't imagine anything else would be against site rules, but I will make sure before releasing them). If it's not against the site rules, I would also create a datfile that would have the names necessary to match everything in the XML.\n\nMy hope is that if people get a taste of these smaller systems and what we've got to offer on our side that I could get some help automating the XML process for the bigger and better systems. Also, I think that with these sets pre-made it would open up skin development to be more creative with multiple previews showing at the same time like the emulators we run.\n\nMaybe we could even open up the ability to pull up Gamefaqs and manuals while in the game like we're able to do.\n\nI'm no coder though. I'm just an OCD mule who had stepped away from the scene for a long time. Most of the guys I did work with have moved on years ago and we don't get the traffic and likely the potential for true talent that you guys are getting right now.\n\nI'm looking forward to working with you guys, and I'll do everything in my power not to break any of the rules while sharing.\n\nHere's a beta build of the Atari 7800 setup.\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!QKxmlCYL!z5ck_O7L7pNzL19Z4HdMZ64FikmYGC7J1mpfXOGvEsk\n\nThe testing was done on a Pi Zero, so the artwork is fairly small. I do have much more high quality artwork for all of the packs that I could include in future releases.\n\nI'd like to know what you guys think about this and especially how the video previews work. Since I had the Pi Zero the videos would load, but they only played a second or two before freezing while the audio played. If you have a Pi Zero you're going to want to delete the videos, or at least use one of the many skins that don't support them. The Carbon skin prioritizes videos, so it will automatically show them if you have them in the \"Media\\A7800\\Movies\" folder in this setup.\n\nAs promised, the Roms and BIOS have been stripped from this release. I provided datafiles that work in RomCenter. There is one datafile per folder, and the roms for each datafile need to be in the exact folder otherwise the XML file won't work for the game.\n\nPlease, moderators, let me know if there is anything else that you find objectionable in this release and I will take it down immediately upon getting the notification (or feel free to remove it yourself, but please let me know why). There wasn't much in the rules about this sort of thing except for not uploading or linking to any copyrighted material. I believe this meets those requirements.\n\nI hope this does a good job showing the potential of these setups, and I hope that some coder types in here see the benefits and can put together something to automate this process so I can quickly make more releases.\n\n@UDb23 Hey man. Nice to hear from you.\n\nWhat exactly should the \"automation\" code do ?\n\nThe automation code, for the first 10 lines of every game, would create the lines you see in the example just with a different filename for each <game></game> entry. Not every single game has every single file associated with it, but it doesn't hurt anything to have the XML call for it when there's nothing in that folder. The location of these files would be exactly the same from system to system except the SYSTEM folder would be different of course.\n\nOur biggest problem with making a code that automatically creates these 10 entries without looking for files matching the rom name first though is that the original setup did not take \"case sensitivity\" into account since the system it was designed for didn't care about that. Most files will match case, but some won't. If it's just a basic code to make the 10 lines to match the rom file name without actually looking for the data first, everything would need to be verified by hand to make sure that it is working right.\n\nExample: \"Astro Chase.bin\" was the rom name. The txt file name was \"astro chase.txt\".\n\nGenerating ES gamelist compliant xml file data based on these txt files could be done quite easily.\n\nI LOVE hearing this. :)\n\nStill using these complete system gamelists would make sense if you have all roms for that systems (and with the same rom filenames).\n\nNot sure how many people will have them all installed (even if occupied sd space will be limited I imagine).\n\nOtherwise it would require a \"scraper\" to pick just the needed rom data out of your global XML based on actual roms installed; and that's not that easy to do.\n\nI can provide data files for Romcenter that would rename your roms, assuming you have the right ones of course. I'm not sure if a scraper would be necessary like you mentioned, but I was wondering if there was a way to have a separate XML file for each game that is referenced in a master XML file instead of putting them all into one file. We had to do that with the TXT files ourselves. Smaller systems like Atari weren't a problem, but when you had systems like the GBA the master information file was getting so big that it was causing a lot of problems.\n\nPerhaps if the games were in separate XML files it would be easier only to use the ones that have matching roms? I don't know.\n\nI assume that not everybody who had these packages would keep everything inside of each one. There are a lot of prototype games, for example, that were included for historical purposes but really provide no entertainment value. They're easily avoided in the setup since everything is cataloged in sub-folders, but for space reasons people might manually remove these.\n\nPlease let me know what questions you have, and if I can further clarify anything. Thanks for the reply and I hope to hear back from you soon.\n\n@UDb23 I've actually changed my mind about what I'm looking for here UDb23. I think I'm going to go ahead and just hand make the gamelist.xml files that have just the files and their locations as well as the title of the game. That way it will display the artwork and videos properly, and I will have to verify by hand that the case sensitivity is addressed on an individual basis anyways.\n\nWhat would be a HUGE help to me is if there was a way we could make individual game.xml files based off of the txt files. Then, if there was a way that the \"master\" gamelist.xml could reference these instead of adding them to the master file.\n\nDoing that first part by hand actually doesn't take that long. It's just a TON of copying and pasting and then finding and replacing. It sucks for sure, but at least when I do that I can verify personally that it's all done right.\n\nWhat DOES take a ton of time on my end is filling in all of the information tags from the txt files. I'm looking at my Atari 2600 collection right now and if I did that I would have to copy information for over 700 games individually, which is more than double of what I had done for 3 other systems combined.\n\nWorst case scenario, if I can't get any help here and the other guy falls through, I can at least have a collection that will work in \"no-metadata\" skins that will display whatever artwork I choose or a movie.\n\n@UDb23 Here's a download for the synopsis files for the individual 2600 games. If you can do something with this, I'd be happy to zip up a package with all the other systems. These are all named exactly the same as the roms are, except of course the extention is .txt instead of .zip.\n\nSynopsis 2600: https://www.sendspace.com/file/mgf38h\n\nAnd here's an XML file for the 2600 I'm currently working on. It has the 10 files for each game already made, as well as the <name></name> field filled in (although I will have to go back and edit some of them since I'm not actually ripping that from the txt file and I'm just doing a copy/paste job.\n\n2600 gamelist.xml wip: https://www.sendspace.com/file/km2sf2\n\nAs you can see from the parts of the XML that are completed, the file names for the Extras for the system are named exactly the same as the rom itself, so everything should work right... unfortunately, the system we did it on originally didn't care about case, so chances are some things in there are broke because the case doesn't match. That's the stuff that I would have to fix by hand after the files were created.\n\nExcel isn't a problem for me. I don't have it installed right now, but I do have a copy of 2007 lying around here somewhere. Hopefully a version that old will still allow me to use your script.\n\nNo need to make a VB program. It's not that I don't have time to wait, but I'm really OCD-ing out here and I'm manually doing things right now I said that I wasn't going to do because I'm waiting for somebody to automate this and patience isn't one of my virtues ;)\n\nLooking forward to see what you can come up with. Chances are the xml I'm working on won't be usable with what you make, but that still isn't enough to make me stop working on it.\n\nI've got good Atari 2600 artwork. There is at least a Box Front and Action shot for every game. Not a lot of title shots since a lot of games didn't have title screens and probably 100-150 carts missing.\n\nFor the boxes that we couldn't find or were never made, we actually had a very talented graphic artist on \"staff\" that created alternate boxarts for prototypes, hacks, translations, unlicensed and other categories.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you can do man. You're the only hope for my sanity at this point. :)\n\nEDITED TO ADD: Now that I think of it, it might be good if there were two different scripts. One script that would create all of the fields/tags like the XML example I gave you, and then a second one that would \"rip\" the information from the TXT files and fill in the empty tags made by the first file.\n\nThat would make sure that work I've already done on the first part would still be usable by the time you make this, but it would also allow me to make sure the files are all working (because of the case issue) before ripping all the data. Any chance we could do that? Maybe that's easier to make it a two step process anyway?\n\nYou may have noticed that the path is not just \"./\" There are many sub folders for a lot of the systems, so the script should be able differentiate that in the path folder based off of which folder the roms are in. I'm making them in alphabetical order, grouped together in the folders. (Maybe you should see this XML when it's completed to fully understand what I'm talking about). I'll upload it as soon as it's done. I'm hopped up on coffee right now so it shouldn't be long :)"
