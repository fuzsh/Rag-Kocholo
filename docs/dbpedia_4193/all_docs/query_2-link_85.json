However, the problem that I'd like to\n\naddress for a few here is the fact that its lousy controllers have\n\novershadowed the system overall which is NOT cool. Intellivision\n\nfans have dealt with what most people consider awful controllers, but\n\nthey still enjoy many of the good games Mattel put out for the system\n\nso it doesn't make much sense why the 5200's faults can't be\n\noverlooked in the controller department - or does it.\n\nAtari launched the 5200 on the heels of what was (and still is) one\n\nof the most popular videogame systems of all time - the 2600. A\n\nsystem that set a standard for controllers to be followed for\n\ndecades. Mattel went in its own direction from day one and pretty\n\nmuch went after people looking for a little more out of their video-\n\ngames. Not necessarily \"more\" overall, but in terms of involvement.\n\nWhile the 2600 has several different types of controllers available\n\nfor it, the system's basic capabilities just didn't offer the\n\nprogrammer much of a chance to get too far into their games no matter\n\nwhat controller they programmed it for.\n\nSo as game systems advanced and Atari began to realize that there was\n\nonly so much that programmers were going to be able to get out of the\n\n2600, they came up with what was called the \"Video System X\" in its\n\nearly stages of development. The system was to have a keypad like\n\nIntellivision and Colecovision, probably an excellent idea on Atari's\n\npart as it allows for a much wider array of gameplay options, but\n\nthen they apparently felt they had to revolutionize the controller\n\nindustry once again and decided to attach an analog joystick to that\n\nkeypad!\n\nThe 2600's controllers are what's called \"digital,\" meaning you are\n\neither pressing a button or you're not. The joystick itself is\n\nsimply a set of four buttons under the stick that you unknowingly\n\npress when you move the joystick in a direction. An analog signal\n\nmeasures HOW FAR you're moving the joystick which, here again I have\n\nto admit, does make for some interesting gameplay options, but since\n\nthe 5200's sticks do not spring back to the center position when you\n\nlet go of the stick it's difficult to get used to.\n\nWho's gonna complain about the keypad they came out with though?\n\nStart, pause and reset right on the controller? Gotta like that a\n\nlot!\n\nNow the games made for the 5200 are a completely different story and\n\npretty much the whole point of my writing here. Most of the games on\n\nthe system are fantastic! If you look at the games released for the\n\nAtari 400/800, which uses standard digital joysticks, they were\n\nexcellent in many cases. The computer didn't have the controller\n\nproblems the 5200 had and the games and computer were very well\n\nreceived. Since the 5200 is nothing more than an Atari 8-bit 400/800\n\nwith a few minor modifications, like games, for the most part, are\n\nquite similar, if not exactly carbon copies! Of course, the 5200 had\n\nmany games that were not available on its 8-bit computer counterpart\n\n(and quite a few games that were available for both systems were\n\nsuperior on the 5200), so it's definitely worth getting into if you\n\nhaven't already. Some of the classic ports are excellent and still\n\nnot found on any other system. Space Dungeon immediately springs to\n\nmind.\n\nSome of the third-party controllers you will find described here\n\novercome the problems of Atari's controller and could practically be\n\ncalled life-savers for the system. Check into a Competition Pro or\n\nWico joystick if you absolutely cannot stand the Atari sticks.\n\nBetter still is the Masterplay Interface if you can get your hands\n\non one - they're pretty hard to come by.\n\nJudging the system by its controllers sucks in my opinion. Try and\n\nwork around them if you can't deal with them and you'll be treated to\n\na library of some of the very best games ever made!\n\n==========================\n\n1.0) GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n==========================\n\n1.1 -- WHAT IS THE ATARI 5200 SUPERSYSTEM?\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe Atari 5200 SuperSystem premiered in 1982, and was the successor\n\nto the venerable VCS (2600) which dominated the first wave of\n\ncartridge-based home videogame systems. The 5200 offered improved\n\ngraphics and several features not found on any other system during\n\nits time.\n\nWhen the 5200 was first unveiled, Atari had solid reasons for\n\noptimism. After all, beneath the sleek, uncluttered exterior of the\n\nunit lurked the throbbing power of a 16K computer designed\n\nspecifically to play high-quality games. The heart of the Super\n\nSystem was, in essence, an Atari 400/800 computer, the most powerful\n\n8-bit home computer system of its era, and thus games could\n\ntheoretically be easily (and rapidly) ported between the two\n\nmachines.\n\nThe controllers have a small calculator-sized numeric keypad and two\n\nfire buttons are located at each side. The controller was a gallant\n\nattempt at cross-breeding the trak-ball and conventional joystick. It\n\nuses an analog control mechanism, offering a full 360 degrees of\n\nmobility instead of the usual 4 or 8 positions. There is a speed\n\ncontrol built-in, which, on specific cartridges, allows the player to\n\nspeed up the action. The harder the stick is pushed to any given\n\ndirection, the faster the on-screen moving object will zip across the\n\nplayfield. Also found on the controller is a \"pause\" button which\n\nenables the player to put any game on hold for as long as he likes.\n\nThis now-standard feature on modern systems was first pioneered on\n\nthe 5200. Atari's attempt at revolutionizing the joystick, however,\n\nturned out to be a mixed bag. The controllers do not self-center,\n\nmaking games like Pole Position and Star Raiders a joy to play. On\n\nthe other hand, games that demand precise, 4-way input from the\n\nplayer (like Pac-Man) can be an exercise in frustration for many\n\ngamers. In addition, the joysticks are infamous for being among the\n\nmost unreliable controllers ever made.\n\nIn addition to the then-futuristic but flakey controllers, the\n\nSuperSystem offered several other advancements in hardware design.\n\n4-port 5200 systems utilized a special switch box where the power\n\nsupply plugs directly into the switch box and not the system itself.\n\nFurthermore, the switch box was automatic, meaning the user was no\n\nlonger required to walk to the back of the television and select\n\nbetween \"TV\" or \"Game\" each time to select the mode he or she\n\ndesired (later 2-port systems reverted back to the standard RF\n\nswitchbox found in just about ever other game console.) In\n\naddition, a special feature only found in the 5200 put the screen\n\non silent black when you change cartridges (no more raspy white\n\nnoise.)\n\nAlthough the 5200 enjoyed moderate success during its heyday, the\n\ngaming public never completely warmed to the SuperSystem, and the\n\n\"Great Videogame Crash of 1983\" helped to seal its fate along with\n\nthe rest of the home videogame consoles. It should be noted,\n\nhowever, that the 5200 was outselling the Colecovision when Atari\n\ndecided to pull the plug on its advanced video game system in 1984.\n\nThe software selection at launch consisted mostly of proven but tired\n\nclassics that failed to utilize the 5200's audio/visual talents.\n\nTitles such as Super Breakout, Galaxian and Space Invaders were\n\nunsuccessful in generating excitement among gamers who were looking\n\nfor the \"next wave\" in console gaming. Once the system passed\n\nthrough its introductory period, however, Atari began to liberally\n\nsalt the 5200 library with glittering new gems like Qix, Vanguard,\n\nRobotron:2084, Space Dungeon, Pengo, Joust and Ms. Pac-Man. Atari\n\nalso had first call on games marketed by its coin-op arm, which\n\nbrought arcade hits such as Dig Dug, Pole Position and Centipede\n\nhome. By the time the 5200 was settled in with a respectable library\n\nof quality titles, however, it was too late. The Great Crash of 1983\n\nwas well under way, and the 5200 joined the likes of Colecovision,\n\nVectrex, Intellivision and others as the home console market came\n\ncrumbling down. As a result, there is an inordinately high number of\n\nprototypes which exist for the 5200.\n\nUpon hindsight, the reasons as to why the 5200 never became the sales\n\nsuccess that Atari had hoped are quite apparent. Despite being a\n\nlarge company for its time, not even a behemoth like Atari had the\n\nmeans to support four product lines with quality games for each\n\n(2600, 5200, 400/800 and coin-op). Resources which should have been\n\nallocated for 5200 game development went instead to the 2600, a\n\nsystem which was on its last legs and already saturated with software\n\nfrom Atari and its third party publishers. In addition, the fact\n\nthat the 5200 was not compatible with the 2600 put off many 2600\n\nowners who had accumulated a substantial library of games for the\n\nsystem (a VCS adapter which allowed 2600 games to be played on the\n\n5200 was later released). Furthermore, although the 5200 was a\n\nquantum leap beyond the 2600 in terms of technology, the SuperSystem\n\nwas not that much better than Colecovision and Vectrex. But perhaps\n\nthe main factor that led to the doom of the 5200 -- and, for that\n\nmatter, the entire home gaming industry -- was the result of the\n\nrapid price drop of affordable game-oriented computers like the Atari\n\n800XL and Commodore 64, both of which were sub-$300 gaming machines\n\nthat also doubled as computing and productivity devices.\n\nToday, the Atari 5200 is a favorite among retrogamers, nostalgists\n\nand collectors. While many of the coin-op translations have\n\nsubsequently been improved upon by modern systems, there are\n\nan abundance of compelling games that no gamer should be without.\n\nSpace Dungeon, Rescue on Fractalus, Qix, Beamrider, Gremlins, Bounty\n\nBob Strikes Back (the spectacular sequel to Miner 2049er), Pengo,\n\nWizard of Wor, Berzerk, Missile Command and Centipede are some of the\n\nshining stars among the impressive repertoire of 5200 cartridges.\n\nThe latter two are especially enjoyable when played with the optional\n\nTrak-ball controller. For those who are more gamer than collector\n\nand have $125 to burn, he or she can purchase a 5200 multicart from\n\nSean Kelly. Not only does the multicart contain every released game\n\nin the 5200 library, but virtually every prototype game known to\n\nexist is included as well! And that's a good thing when you consider\n\nthat the SuperSystem has an outrageously large amount of prototypes,\n\nsome of which are fantastic. (Jr. Pac-Man, Xari Arena, Meebzork,\n\nMillipede and Track and Field come to mind).\n\nDespite its relative small library of games and being a lukewarm\n\nseller in the early 1980s (compared to the 2600), the Atari 5200\n\nhas a significant following of die-hard enthusiasts and collectors\n\nwho recognize its excellence as a gaming machine. And that, folks,\n\nspeaks volumes about a home videogame system that rode off into the\n\nsunset over a decade ago!\n\n1.2 -- DID YOU KNOW?\n\n--------------------\n\nThe 5200 was originally conceived as Atari's answer to Mattel's\n\nIntellivision, NOT the Colecovision as many people think. As an\n\nexample, the 5200's analog joystick was a response to Mattel touting\n\nits unit having 16 positions of movement compared to the 2600's\n\neight. Atari's plan was to upstage the Intellivision in this area by\n\ncreating an analog controller with 360 degrees of full motion\n\ncontrol.\n\nThe 5200 was created at a time when poor marketing and questionable\n\ncompany policy ran rampant within Atari. The 5200 controller was\n\ndeveloped by an individual who had NEVER even played a single video\n\ngame in his life! Response to the controllers from focus groups and\n\nclinics were poor, but the marketing arm stubbornly insisted on\n\nreleasing the system with the \"groundbreaking\" elements intact. In\n\naddition, the controller was partially influenced by corporate policy\n\nwhere hardware designers and engineers were offered bonuses for\n\ncreating designs that received patents. Not surprisingly, many\n\nengineers and designers developed hardware that were innovative\n\nfor the sake of being \"original\", with complete disregard for\n\nfunctionality.\n\nThe engineers were so adamant in their disapproval of the 5200's\n\ncontrollers that they sent a petition to the director of engineering\n\nin hopes that the non-centering joystick would not be released in its\n\nfinished form.\n\nThe wedge-shape design of the 5200 was influenced mainly by the 2700\n\n(aka. \"RC Stella\"), a prototype remote-controlled 2600. Other 2700\n\ndesign features, such as the side-mounted fire buttons and the non-\n\nself-centering joystick mechanism, carried over to the 5200 design as\n\nwell.\n\nThe Atari 3600 (aka. \"Silvia\") was originally planned as the\n\nsuccessor to the 2600. Silvia's bizarre 10-bit chip set (similar to\n\nthe Intellivision) was designed in 1978-79. One must remember that\n\nthe shelf life of typical home videogame systems during this period\n\nwas generally two years at most, and Atari did not, in its wildest\n\ndreams, foresee the 2600 becoming the awesome videogaming force that\n\nit eventually became. The 3600 was killed by the game programmers\n\nwho complained that it was too difficult to program games for the\n\nmachine (as if 2600 game development was any cakewalk).\n\nCode names had always been popular at Warner Atari. The VCS was\n\ninternally referred to as \"Stella,\" the 400 computer was \"Candy,\" the\n\n800 was \"Coleen\" and the 5200 was nicknamed \"Pam.\" All of the\n\naforementioned machines were named after well-endowed female\n\nemployees who were working at Atari. The 5200 was unique in that\n\nAtari strongly considered using Pam as the actual name of the unit\n\nbefore changing it to \"Video System X\" and eventually deciding on\n\n5200. Why? Because it would have been the abbreviation for\n\n\"Personal Arcade Machine.\"\n\n============================\n\n2.0) CARTRIDGE INFORMATION\n\n============================\n\n2.1 -- ATARI 5200 GAME LIST\n\n---------------------------\n\nRarity Ratings are as follows:\n\nC-, C, C+ ---- Common\n\nU-, U, U+ ---- Uncommon\n\nR-, R, R+ ---- Rare\n\nER-, ER, ER+ - Extremely Rare\n\nUR ----------- Unbelievably Rare\n\nPROTO -------- Prototype only\n\nNR ----------- Not believed to exist, even as a prototype\n\nFor example, an ER cart would be slightly more common than an ER+\n\nand harder to find than an ER- game.\n\nGAMES THAT WERE RELEASED OR HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED TO EXIST\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nOver-\n\nTitle Publisher Product # Rarity lay?\n\n----- --------- --------- ------ -----\n\nA.E.

All Atari-released 5200 carts are similar in that\n\nthere is only a front label, and no side or end labels.\n\n1) Games with a copyright of 1982 have a large \"ATARI\" logo with the\n\n5200 logo beside it. In addition, the trademark information and\n\ncopyright dates are on the bottom edge of the front label,\n\nunderneath the illustration.\n\n2) Games with a copyright of 1983/84 are similar to the 1982 labels,\n\nwith a few exceptions. The \"Atari\" logo (with the 5200 on the\n\nside) is smaller and is shifted to the top right side of the\n\nlabel. To the left of the logo, it reads \"VIDEO GAME CARTRIDGE\"\n\nand \"ATARI 5200 SUPERSYSTEM,\" both with rather small fonts. The\n\ntrademark and copyright information is on the left side of the\n\nlabel.\n\n3) The labels on the 1986 Atari Corporation releases are exactly like\n\nthe 1983/84 Atari Inc. carts, but with one MAJOR difference--\n\nthe title of the game is not mentioned anywhere on the cart! The\n\nillustration on the label is the only hint of what game the cart\n\nactually is. Of course, the game titles are typed on the front of\n\nthe box and on the instruction manual. All Ballblazer and Rescue\n\non Fractalus carts have this label, and the following titles are\n\nknown to have this variation as well (along with the standard 1982\n\nor 1983/84 label):\n\nSpace Invaders\n\nVanguard\n\n4) Another minor variation found on Atari-released 5200 carts are\n\nthe grayish labels (as opposed to the normal silver color) in\n\nsome of the Atari Corp. releases. The label is dull-gray in\n\nappearance like the ones found in late release 2600 and 7800\n\ncarts.\n\nA few other Atari-released label oddities exist. For example,\n\nthere is a 1986 release of Dig Dug which has the title on the\n\ncart, which is unlike almost any other 1986 release or re-release.\n\n5) Football was later renamed Realsports Football. The title for\n\nSoccer was also later changed to Realsports Soccer. Differences\n\nin titles and slight alterations in the cart/box art work\n\nnotwithstanding, the gameplay for both titles is the same.\n\nBoth Bounty Bob Strikes Back and Miner 2049er by Big Five Software\n\nboth have two different labels. The more common of the two\n\nvariations features a picture label on a red case. A precious few\n\nhave a silver foil label with plain text, which is much more\n\ndifficult to find than the picture label carts.\n\nZone Ranger by Activision comes in two flavors. The earlier release\n\nhas a regular illustrated label, the type used in all other\n\nActivision games. The later, and more common version (mostly seen\n\nbeing sold by Telegames) has a silver foil label with black text.\n\nMasterplay Interface by Electra Concepts has two different boxes.\n\nThe Masterplay was originally packaged in a small black box with\n\nred pinstripes and no illustration. Later (and more common) units\n\nhad larger boxes with pictures and illustrations.\n\nSeveral late Activision releases for the 5200 have unusual box and\n\nmanual variations. Whether it was a result of a cost-cutting\n\ninitiative or merely a foul-up on their part, we may never know.\n\nQuite a few of the late releases come in 2600 boxes! Although they\n\nsupposedly shipped that way from the factory as brand-new 5200 carts,\n\nthe box clearly states \"for Atari 2600\" and in some cases states\n\n\"for Colecovision.\" Some of these boxes have \"for Atari 5200\"\n\nstickers pasted on the box over where it originally stated a\n\ndifferent system.\n\nThat's not all. Some of the manuals included with the game were\n\nnothing more than photocopies with shrunken down text. Some of the\n\nmanuals were also made with instructions for more than one version of\n\nthat particular game (i.e., Pitfall for the 2600, Colecovision and\n\nAtari 5200). Finally, quite a few of the Activision releases had\n\neither manuals for the wrong system or had NO manuals packaged with\n\nthe game!\n\n2.3 -- GAMES NOT CONFIRMED TO EXIST\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nTitle Publisher Product #\n\n----- --------- ---------\n\nADVENTURE Atari\n\nARABIAN Atari\n\nASTEROIDS DELUXE Atari\n\n(Same as Asteroids?)\n\nASTRO GROVER Atari CX 5233\n\nBIG BIRD HIDE 'N SEEK Atari CX 5235\n\nBLACK WIDOW Atari\n\n(Joystick connector)\n\nBRISTLES First Star Soft.\n\nBUMP 'N JUMP Sega\n\nCAMPAIGN '84 Sunrise Software\n\nCHESS Parker Brothers\n\nCLOAK AND DAGGER Atari\n\n(Joystick Connector)\n\nCRYSTAL CASTLES Atari CX 5223\n\n(Trak-ball)\n\nDOMINO MAN CBS Electronics 80133\n\nDONALD DUCK Atari CX 5244\n\nDRAGONSTOMPER Starpath\n\nDUKES OF HAZZARD Atari\n\nELEVATOR ACTION Atari CX 5250\n\nESCAPE FROM THE Starpath\n\nMINDMASTER\n\nESPIAL Tigervision\n\nFALL GUY, THE 20th Century Fox\n\nFATHOM Imagic\n\nFLIP & FLOP First Star Soft.\n\nFOOD FIGHT Atari CX 5245\n\nFOOTBALL Atari\n\n(For Video System X)\n\nGALAGA Atari CX 5228\n\nGRAVITAR Atari CX 5224\n\nHIGHWAY Atari CX 5227\n\nINDIANA JONES AND THE Atari\n\nTEMPLE OF DOOM\n\nJAWBREAKER Sierra On-Line\n\nKRULL Atari\n\nLASER GATES Imagic\n\nLEGACY, THE Atari\n\n(Renamed Final Legacy)\n\nLOCO-MOTION Atari CX 5226\n\nLODE RUNNER Broderbund\n\nMADDEN FOOTBALL CBS Electronics 80123\n\nMAD PLANETS Parker Brothers\n\nMAJOR HAVOC Atari\n\nMARTIAL ARTS Atari CX 5231\n\nMOONSWEEPER Imagic\n\nMS.

Sloppy isn't\n\na brutal enough description of the controls. (1/2)\n\nAstro Chase\n\n(TL) - I don't understand it. What's the point? Graphics are\n\ngood though. (score not given)\n\nBallblazer\n\n(BW) - One of my all time favorites on any platform! (4/5)\n\n(KI) - Split screen, first person perspective and two player\n\nsimultaneous gameplay. Who could ask for anything more?\n\n(4/5)\n\nBattlezone (Prototype)\n\n(DM) - How did they manage to make this game so bad? Redefined\n\ncharacter sets made the tanks and obstacles unscalable,\n\nand just made the whole thing look like a bad game you\n\ntyped-in on your own 8-bit from Antic magazine or\n\nsomething. (3/1)\n\n(KI) - No wonder this game was never released. (2/2)\n\nBerzerk\n\n(TL) - This cool game taught me how to fight like a robot\n\ninstead of chicken. (4/4)\n\n(EB) - Best home version of this game. Speech is cool! (4/4)\n\nBlack Belt\n\n(KI) - A very early and unfinished fighting game. Shows\n\npromise but the lack of collision detection makes it\n\nhard to judge the game. (2/3)\n\nBounty Bob Strikes Back\n\n(KHe)- All I can say is \"WOW!\" I thought Miner 2049er was great\n\n(and it still is), but Bounty Bob is king! This game is\n\nincredibly fun AND challenging. It takes the best\n\nelements of Miner, then expands on them. There is so\n\nI like about this game: Lots-o-levels, tons of strategy,\n\nhumor, warps, and a special configuration page to boot.\n\nEven the high score entry and display pages are great.\n\nThis game is a definite 5/5 for graphics/playability.\n\nThank you Bill Hogue! (5/5)\n\n(DER)- Game play is really different. Takes all the fun of\n\nMiner 2049er out, sometimes it's hard to tell the\n\ndifference between the two except for the different\n\ncolors. It's really difficult to jump from one level to\n\nanother. I'll say it again; game play is really\n\ndifficult. (1/2)\n\nBuck Rogers: Planet of Zoom\n\n(DER)- A game I like except I wish they would have taken it\n\nfurther and made the graphics a bit better a la\n\nBallblazer. A distant predecessor to games like 1942.\n\n(4/3)\n\nCentipede\n\n(DM) - My 5/5 rating is really based on the fact that this is a\n\nport, it's just a plain good 5200 version. Smooth moving\n\nenemies, fantastic sound, and the trak-ball makes this\n\nprobably one of my favorite 5200 titles. (5/5)\n\n(KHe)- Gameplay improves when using trak-ball.\n\n(EB) - Different from (and better than) the Atari 8-bit Computer\n\nversion. (4/3)\n\n(JJ) - Beats Atari Computer version by a mile. (5/5)\n\nCongo Bongo\n\n(JT) - Hate this damn game. Cheezy 3-D perspective doesn't work\n\nat all. (1/2)\n\n(DER)- It's an OK game. I liked playing it in the arcade, but\n\nthe 5200 version is kinda lame. The opening level seems\n\nlike a big splotch of yellow with some brown added to it.\n\n(3/3)\n\n(EB) - Awful, just awful. (1/2)\n\nCountermeasure\n\n(TL) - The 5200's version of Combat. (4/2)\n\nDecathlon\n\n(KI) - If you want to kill your joystick by playing this game,\n\nbe my guest. Don't say that I didn't warn you, though.\n\nDecent enough game for those who don't mind the risk of\n\nthrashing their controllers. (2/4)\n\nDefender\n\n(DER)- I consider this game the \"feel-good\" game of the Atari\n\nseries. It seems no matter how bad you are playing, you\n\ncan always rack up a high score. I like Defender a lot,\n\nit's one of my all-time faves. (5/3)\n\n(TL) - Not a big fan of the game but the graphics are\n\noutstanding! (3/5)\n\n(KI) - Smooth gameplay coupled with the absence of flicker\n\n(unlike the 2600 version) combine to make this one of\n\nthe most faithful ports of Defender on any classic\n\nsystem. (4/4)\n\nDig Dug\n\n(DER)- I've seen better ports of this than the 5200 version, but\n\nthere's something about Dig Dug I like that I can't put a\n\nfinger on. An entertaining game. (3/3)\n\nFinal Legacy\n\n(KI) - None of the sub-games is good enough to stand on its own,\n\nbut judged as a whole it's slightly more enjoyable than\n\nCountermeasure. (3/4)\n\nFrogger\n\n(JT) - Friggin' retarded control scheme. (2/5)\n\n(TL) - What a sissy concept for a game. (2/3)\n\n(KHe)- Looks good, but button/joystick combo that you have to\n\nuse to control Frogger's movement is a pain. Keypad\n\ncontrolling is even worse. (2/4)\n\n(KI) - Play this game with the Masterplay and you'll change your\n\nmind, guys :) (4/4)\n\nFrogger II: Threeedeep!\n\n(DER)- I like this game a lot. One of the last games I got\n\nbefore they became impossible to get. As a matter of\n\nfact, this game IS impossible to get. I like the\n\ngraphics and it's a big improvement over the first one.\n\n(4/4)\n\n(KI) - Great sequel, but this game is bound to frustrate even\n\nthe best gamers with its absurd difficulty. (4/4)\n\nGalaxian\n\n(BW) - Looks and plays like Galaxian, but just lacks something.\n\n(4/3)\n\n(DER)- This game is haunted by the fact that the game play and\n\nscreens never change. (See also Space Invaders). I like\n\nthis better than Space Invaders, however. (3/3)\n\nGorf\n\n(TL) - I can't give it a 5/5 because they forgot the Galaxian\n\nlevel. Otherwise it is awesome! (4/5)\n\nGyruss\n\n(JT) - Fantastic music. (4/5)\n\n(KI) - Along with Ballblazer, Pengo and Moon Patrol, this game\n\nis a showcase title of the 5200's remarkable audio\n\ncapabilities. (4/3)\n\nJames Bond 007\n\n(KI) - An insanely difficult game, and an awful one to boot.\n\n(2/3)\n\nJoust\n\n(KI) - A faithful home port of the Williams coin-op. (4/4)\n\nJungle Hunt\n\n(KHe)- Is it just me or is the final scene much more difficult\n\nthan in the original coin-op? (3/4)\n\n(KI) - Most people either love this game or despise it. I'm\n\nsomewhere in between, however. (3/4)\n\nK-Razy Shootout\n\n(KI) - A decent ripoff of Berzerk on a system that already has\n\nan (almost) pixel perfect port of the real thing. (3/2)\n\nKaboom!\n\n(DM) - Although many people believe playing Kaboom! without a\n\npaddle is some kind of sacrilege, I love this version of\n\nthe game. With the 5200 joystick, you're simply\n\ncontrolling the same potentiometer in the controller, but\n\nwith a knob on the 2600 and a stick on the 5200. Output\n\nis analog either way. Plus, the 1812 Overture really\n\ngets me pumped up! (5/4)\n\n(KI) - The option of allowing a second player to play as the Mad\n\nBomber is a cool feature not found in any other version\n\nof Kaboom! (4/3)\n\nKangaroo\n\n(TL) - This game is downright stupid. The graphics are even\n\nworse. I bet they had Commodore shaking in their boots\n\nat the time. (1/1)\n\n(KI) - Controlling Mama-roo is tricky with the standard 5200\n\njoystick, but this game truly shines for those lucky\n\nenough to have a third-party controller. (4/4)\n\nMario Bros.\n\n(KHe)- Great port. Fun, especially with two players. (5/4)\n\nMegamania\n\n(TL) - Cool graphics, but redundant as #@$%. (3/4)\n\n(DM) - I love this game. Apart from the fact that this game\n\njust feels a little different from the 2600 version that\n\nwe're all used to, this game is terrific in every way.\n\nAnd aside from the game, the label and box art are quite\n\nsuperior to its 2600 counterpart. If this one had come\n\nout first, they would have laughed the 2600 version out\n\nthe door. (5/5)\n\nMeteorites\n\n(KI) - A pretty decent Asteroids clone. Speaking of which,\n\nwhatever happened to Asteroids??? (4/3)\n\nMicro-gammon SB (Prototype)\n\n(DM) - I'm glad they used the highest resolution possible for at\n\nleast one game. The computer may not be a very good\n\nbackgammon player, but they really had a great idea here\n\nand I'm sorry it wasn't released. (3/5)\n\nMillipede (Prototype)\n\n(KI) - Absolutely phenomenal. The trak-ball option puts this\n\nversion above the technically superior NES edition. (5/4)\n\nMiner 2049er\n\n(DER)- This game is everything that BBSB isn't. Easy to play,\n\nnot too difficult, OK graphics, just a lot of fun. (4/2)\n\n(KHe)- Great game! Was my favorite as a kid. (5/5)\n\nMissile Command\n\n(TL) - This game has it all! Easily my favorite 5200 game and\n\namong my favorites of all time. Anyone have a trak-ball\n\nfor sale? (5/5)\n\n(DM) - With two buttons and a keypad available, having only one\n\nmissile base is inexcusable. They even fit two bases\n\ninto the Atari ST version, using each button on the\n\nmouse. Why couldn't Atari port their own game worth a\n\n\"bleep\"? (2/3)\n\nMountain King\n\n(KHe)- Fun; are the higher levels winnable? (5/3)\n\nMr. Do's Castle\n\n(DM) - After seeing the Colecovision version, this is just plain\n\nsad. The 5200 could certainly have moved the Do-meister\n\nand the Chameleon Unicorns around better than it did.\n\n(3/2)\n\nMs. Pac-Man\n\n(DER)- The successor to Pac-Man is more challenging than the\n\noriginal, and gameplay is better. (4/3)\n\nPac-Man\n\n(TL) - The screen is just too wide. And what happened to the\n\ngreat sound effects that were included in the 2600\n\nversion? (3/2)\n\nPengo\n\n(KHe)- Fun! I liked the arcade game, but wasn't too good at it.\n\nPlayed this version a lot! Great port (5/3)\n\n(KI) - A pixel perfect port of the coin-op cult classic. (4/5)\n\nPitfall!\n\n(BW) - I actually like 2600 Pitfall better! (3/3)\n\nPitfall II: Lost Caverns\n\n(KI) - For an additional challenge, try the secret Adventurer's\n\nworld! (5/4)\n\nPole Position\n\n(BW) - Made me want a 5200 back in the day (4/4)\n\nPopeye\n\n(TL) - Graphics leave a bit to be desired. (3/2)\n\n(KI) - Never cared for Nintendo's coin-op version, so the 5200\n\none doesn't do much for me. (3/3)\n\nQ*Bert\n\n(JT) - Retarded controls (like Frogger). (2/4)\n\n(KHe)- Not one of my favorite games, but seems to be a good\n\nport. Of course, it's missing the \"thwack\" of the\n\noriginal when Q*bert or Coily jumps off the side of the\n\npyramid. (3/3)\n\nQix\n\n(TL) - A true classic. Decent graphics. Great concept! One of\n\nthe best ever! (5/5)\n\nRealSports Baseball\n\n(DER)- This game is fun! I like playing the higher levels,\n\nbecause the easy level is too easy. On the easy level,\n\nyou can bunt for home runs. The voice in the game is\n\ncool, but can get old after a long time of playing. (4/4)\n\nRealSports Basketball (Prototype)\n\n(DER)- I played this game for two weeks as part of an Atari\n\nsurvey my Dad got in '83 in the Northwest suburbs of\n\nChicago. The graphics were terrible and the gameplay\n\nwasn't too much better. I suppose it would have been\n\nbetter if I had really good joysticks, or that I should\n\nhave played it on the two-port version. (2/2)\n\nRealSports Football\n\n(DER)- This game is just above average. The playbooks are cool,\n\nbut I can run the same play over and over again and\n\ndemolish the computer. I don't understand how a player\n\ncan run around the screen and end up on the other side.\n\n(2/2)\n\nRealSports Soccer\n\n(DER)- I'm a big fan of Soccer, and this game is an OK version.\n\nIt seems that most of the time the other players are out\n\njust wandering around. (3/2)\n\nRescue on Fractalus\n\n(KI) - The system of fractile geometry which was used to\n\ngenerate the planetary landscape was a gaming first.\n\n(5/5)\n\nRiver Raid\n\n(BW) - I don't like the jagged river edges, and the stick ruins\n\nit for me. (4/3)\n\nSpace Dungeon\n\n(TL) - Berzerk in outer space with a little more meat in it.\n\n(4/4)\n\n(JJ) - Simply put, this game rules! (5/5)\n\n(KI) - Robotron meets Berzerk meets Zelda. A closet classic\n\nthat begs to be played by everyone. (5/5)\n\nSpace Invaders\n\n(DER)- I know it's an older game, but Galaxian and Megamania\n\npicked up where this one left off. Gameplay is OK and\n\ngraphics are weak, but that's what it's like to be an\n\noriginal. (2/2)\n\n(KHe)- Not really like the original but kind of fun. The mother\n\nship comes out constantly! (3/3)\n\nStar Raiders\n\n(BW) - Great, even with the 5200 stick! (5/5)\n\n(DER)- Predecessor to X-Wing and Wing Commander. Really\n\ninvolved for a 5200 game. It had one of the largest\n\nmanuals for any game, 40-some pages. (5/3)\n\n(KHe)- I guess this is considered to be a \"classic,\" but I just\n\ncan't get into this game. Yuck! (1/1)\n\nStar Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator\n\n(EB) - Boring translation of a game that has no good home ports\n\n(vector to raster). (2/3)\n\nStar Wars: The Arcade Game\n\n(DM) - After this guy got fired from Atari for Battlezone, he\n\nmust have went to Parker Brothers. Same crappy blocky\n\nBattlezone graphics ruined this one too. (3/2)\n\n(KI) - It (sort of) looks like the arcade version, and it sure\n\nsounds like it, too. But it plays nothing like its\n\ncolor vector parent. (2/3)\n\nSuper Breakout\n\n(KHo)- The 2600 version blows this one out of the water! (1/1)\n\n(BW) - How do you rate graphics on Breakout? Of course they're\n\nblocky. (3/4)\n\nSuper Pac-Man\n\n(KI) - Absolutely superb. The graphics are sharp and colorful,\n\nand everything that was found in the coin-op original is\n\nfeatured in the SuperSystem adaptation. (5/5)\n\nTempest\n\n(KI) - Incomplete, but what's there shows tremendous promise.\n\nControl is spot-on, and the sound effects seem to have\n\nbeen taken straight out of the arcade version. (4/5)\n\nVanguard\n\n(TL) - I liked the 2600 version better but credit is due for a\n\ngreat game like Vanguard. (3/5)\n\n(KHe)- Captures the spirit of the original. Sadly, the four\n\nfire button arrangement of the coin-op couldn't be\n\nduplicated. I hate how the ship doesn't move easily\n\nwhile firing. (3/3)\n\nWizard of Wor\n\n(TL) - Cool game. Decent graphics. (4/4)\n\nXari Arena (Prototype)\n\n(DM) - Good marks just based on originality. What a nifty game\n\nthis was. (5/4)\n\n(KI) - If you liked Warlords, you'll absolutely love this\n\nprototype game. (4/3)\n\nZaxxon\n\n(KHo)- Blows away the Colecovision and C-64 versions by a mile!\n\n(5/5)\n\nZone Ranger\n\n(TL) - Playability is awesome. (4/4)\n\n2.5 -- GENERAL SOFTWARE INFO, TIDBITS, CHEATS AND EASTER EGGS\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdventure\n\nA box for this game was shown in a flyer for the \"Video\n\nSystem X.\"\n\nA.E.\n\nAn unreleased prototype that is similar to the Atari computer\n\nversion, one was recently auctioned off by Best Electronics.\n\nOnly a precious few are known to exist.\n\nAsteroids\n\nRecently discovered! The first Atari 5200 catalog\n\n(Part #CO18270 Rev.1) shows a picture of the box as well as a\n\ngame description and screenshot. This game supports up to 4\n\nplayers in head-to-head or cooperative play. After attempting\n\nto play it, you realize what weve all suspected for some time:\n\nThe game is unplayable with the standard 5200 controller. Some\n\ninteresting notes - This cart was found with an actual\n\nproduction label and a prototype 5200 Asteroids controller.\n\nOnly one is known to exist, and was demonstrated for the first\n\ntime at the World of Atari '98 show in Las Vegas. For more\n\ninfo on this game - including screenshots - check out\n\nAtari Gaming Headquarters (http://www.atarihq.com).\n\nAstrochase\n\nLicensed from First Star Software. Designed by Fernando\n\nHerrera, founder of First Star Software. An interesting note\n\non the origin of this company - Atari had a program called the\n\nAtari Program Exchange (APX) which published user-written\n\nsoftware for their 8-bit line of computers. The submission that\n\nwas judged best by Atari each year was awarded the Atari Star\n\naward. Fernando Herrera wrote a program called \"My First\n\nAlphabet\" which was selected as the first-ever winner of the\n\nAtari Star Award; hence the name: First Star Software.\n\nBallblazer\n\nDesigned and programmed by David Levine, Peter Langston, David\n\nRiordan, and Garry Hare. Contributions and support by Charlie\n\nKellner, Gary Winnick, and David Fox. According to sources at\n\nAtari, the working title for this game was \"Topsy Turvy\". One\n\nof only two Atari released games that came in a white box\n\n(Rescue on Fractalus was the other) instead of the standard\n\nissue grey and blue box. This game is also one of the few Atari\n\ntitles that has no name on the cartridge label. Also one of the\n\nfirst games musically scored by a recognized musician, Pat\n\nMethany.\n\nBar Room Baseball\n\nThis version of RealSports Baseball has been modified and was\n\nintended for use in an arcade cabinet. The inclusion of a\n\ntimer limited gameplay to 3 minutes per credit. Arcade cabinets\n\nwith 5200 systems inside were sold in Mexico and other Latin\n\nAmerican countries.\n\nBattlezone\n\nThis version resorted to colorful backgrounds instead of the\n\narcade vector graphics. Has a 2 joystick option and most\n\nlikely would have been packaged with a controller holder like\n\nRobotron and Space Dungeon.\n\nBeamrider\n\nDesigned by Dave Rolfe. 5200 adaptation by Action Graphics.\n\nReaching sector 14 with 40,000 points or more got you a\n\nBeamriders patch if you sent Activision picture proof and $1.\n\nThis and several other 5200 titles from Activision were later\n\npackaged in 2600 boxes with stickers on them.\n\nBehind Jaggi Lines\n\nWorking title for Rescue on Fractalus, Behind Jaggi Lines was\n\nrecently discovered and demonstrated for the first time at\n\nWorld of Atari '98 in Las Vegas. An exact duplicate of Rescue\n\nexcept for the different title on the title screen.\n\nBerzerk\n\nThe first console game that had built-in voice synthesis without\n\nthe need of additional hardware, 5200 Berzerk is a marvelous\n\ntranslation of the coin-op original. Highly recommended,\n\nparticularly if you like to be taunted by Evil Otto with phrases\n\nlike \"Chicken, fight like a robot!\"\n\nAn interesting glitch exists that allows a player to make Evil\n\nOtto (that's the official name of \"Mr. Happy\") go the opposite\n\ndirection from where you are on the screen, but this works only\n\non the left exit. Position your character until he's just about\n\nto exit the maze (that is, the next joystick movement to the\n\nleft will make him leave the maze). Evil Otto will start to\n\nbounce towards the right instead of coming after you. If you\n\nstand at the exit long enough, Evil Otto will wrap around to the\n\nleft side of the screen. Whether he kills you when he touches\n\nyou is uncertain; the wrap-around scenario has not been tested\n\nas of yet. This glitch is extremely useful, especially when you\n\nwant to finish off the robots and Evil Otto comes in sooner than\n\nyou anticipate. It takes practice to precisely position your\n\ncharacter to make Evil Otto go the other way, but you'll get it\n\nright with practice.\n\nAnother tip that can help in mastering the game has to do with\n\nyour character's neck. Or should I say lack thereof? The open\n\nspace below his head can be useful when facing robots straight\n\nto your left or right. If you position the character just\n\nright, the robot's lasers will go right through without killing\n\nhim It's very tough to master, especially on higher levels when\n\nthe lasers are traveling at the same speed that yours do.\n\nAnd last but not least, it's easier to avoid Evil Otto by going\n\nto the left or right exits than using the top or bottom ones.\n\nThis is due to how Evil Otto bounces when he chances you. Of\n\ncourse, there will be times that the top or bottom exits will be\n\nyour best retreat.\n\nBlack Belt\n\nSimilar to Karateka, Black Belt was to be Ataris entry into\n\nthe karate genre. Impressive graphics, with several different\n\nrooms. No collision detection and slow movement/gameplay keep\n\nthis one from being complete. This title probably evolved from\n\na title in the rumor mill called \"Martial Arts\".\n\nFor more info on this game - including screenshots - check out\n\nAtari Gaming Headquarters (http://www.atarihq.com).\n\nBoogie Demo Cart\n\nIt's difficult to tell if this one is anything more than\n\nsomeone at Atari \"screwing around\" or if there was an eventual\n\npurpose to this title. Not really a game, this music demo plays\n\na repeating Boogie tune. Only a precious few are known to\n\nexist.\n\nBounty Bob Strikes Back\n\nDesigned and programmed by Bill Hogue, founder of Big 5\n\nSoftware. Graphics designed by Curtis Mikolyski. A sequel\n\nthat's better than the original? You bet! A follow-up to Miner\n\n2049'er that could be the most enjoyable game ever made. The\n\nbox for this game is extremely hard to come by, as is the full\n\ncolor poster that was packed in.\n\nTo transport to another screen, grab the item mentioned below,\n\nthen press and hold the number (also stated below) then press\n\nstart. You will warp to the level mentioned.\n\n1. Bob's Morning Flower pot / 1 / start = level 4\n\nCalisthenics\n\n2. Utility Hoist Aliens / paint roller / 3 / start = level 22\n\n3. The Suction Tubes Goblet / 4 / start = level 15\n\n5. Jumping 101 Coffee Pot / 8 / start = level 18\n\n10. The Gravity Lift Pitch Fork / 5 / start = level 14\n\n16. Adv. Suction Tubes Tube 1 to left/ pie / 9 / start = level 19\n\n26. The End......\n\n\"Congratulations, you are an expert! For getting this far, you\n\nmay start the game at any level you desire by setting special\n\ncodes 1-25 in the Game Adjustment Screen and then pressing\n\nSTART.\"\n\nAt the game adjustment screen, enter one of the following\n\nspecial codes and press * for a few secret messages:\n\n5 6 49 69 100 213 666 782 818 2049 6861\n\nCentipede (released version)\n\nAtari 5200 version designed by Frank Hausman and Sean W.\n\nHennessy. One of the many games that is trak-ball compatible.\n\nNamed the best game (covering all systems), best 5200 game and\n\nbest graphics in a 5200 game in the first annual Videogame\n\nIllustrated \"Vista Awards.\"\n\nCentipede, (\"Killer hard version\")\n\nRecently discovered, this particular prototype is similar to the\n\nreleased version of the same game, with the exception being that\n\nit's HARD! (as if the released version was a walk in the park to\n\nbegin with). The Centipedes slide down the screen at a frantic\n\npace, and the spiders have even better AI along with faster\n\nmovement. Definitely an in-house \"pet\" project and never\n\nintended for release.\n\nChoplifter!\n\nBased on the Broderbund computer game designed by Dan Gorlin.\n\nThe copyright on the back of the box has a printing error -\n\n©1982 Dan Gorling. I'm sure Mr. Gorlin was thrilled. One of\n\nthe last games released for the 5200.\n\nCloak and Dagger\n\nAnnounced by Atari but never released. In the movie of the same\n\nname, the kid from ET can be seen holding a 5200 Cloak & Dagger\n\ncartridge (most likely just a mock-up). For further details\n\nsurrounding the Cloak and Dagger mystery, see Section 2.6 of\n\nthis FAQ.\n\nCongo Bongo\n\nBased on the Sega coin-op. The manual incorrectly claims that\n\nafter selecting 1 or 2 players, the game will ask you whether\n\nor not you're using a joystick. Needless to say, no controller\n\nchoices are given, although we're at a loss as to what choices\n\nthey had in mind. As with most other versions of this game,\n\nonly 2 of the 4 arcade version screens are present.\n\nCountermeasure\n\nAn early prototype of this game has the name Failsafe\n\nalthough the game appears to be identical. One of a few games\n\nthat never appeared on any other Atari system. Note the Atari\n\nsymbol on the soldier's cap on the game box/cart picture. The\n\nfailsafe code was a combination of the following letters: L, E,\n\nO. You have to wonder what the programmer's name or sign was...\n\nHere's an interesting easter egg... When the skull and\n\ncrossbones appears, after you fail to enter the correct code,\n\ntake a look at one of the bones. You'll see the initials \"RM,\"\n\nwhich is initials of the programmer.\n\nCram Cartridge\n\nCram is a nickname for the in-house version of the Atari 5200\n\nDiagnostic Cartridge. Basically, it is a diagnostic cart that\n\nhas pin #18 shorted to Ground, which forces the 5200 to turn\n\non automatically when the cart is inserted. These carts were\n\nused for assembly line testing where employees would CRAM the\n\ncart into the machine to make sure they powered up and were\n\nfunctioning. Actually, any cartridge can be made into a Cram\n\ncart by shorting pin #18 as mentioned above.\n\nDecathlon\n\nDesigned by David Crane. 5200 adaptation by Paul Willson.\n\nScoring over 8,600 points could get you a \"Bronze\" patch,\n\nover 9,000 a \"Silver\" patch, and over 10,000 a \"Gold\" patch\n\nby sending proof to Activision along with $1.\n\nDefender\n\nProgrammed by Steve Baker. One of the many games that is\n\ntrak-ball compatible. Note the Atari symbol in the building's\n\nwindow at the top-left of the game box/instructions/cart\n\npicture.\n\nSecond runner-up in the best 5200 game category in the first\n\nannual Videogaming Illustrated \"Vista Awards.\"\n\nDiagnostic Cartridge\n\nUsed by factory authorized service personnel to diagnose\n\nmalfunctioning systems. Selections included tests for RAM,\n\nROM, Video, Sound, Joystick Ports, Joysticks, along with the\n\nability to examine memory locations. Several revisions exist.\n\nDig Dug\n\nThe 1986 Atari Corp. release has a label variation. The \"5200\"\n\nat the top of the cart is printed in an elongated font. The\n\n\"vegetable\"? for rounds 16 & 17 is a Galaxian.\n\nDreadnaught Factor, The\n\nDesigned by Tom Loughry. 5200 adaptation by Eric Nickell.\n\nDefeating the entire fleet of Dreadnaughts on level 4 or higher\n\ncould net you a Dreadnaught Destroyer patch if you sent\n\nActivision a picture of your TV screen (you didnt have to\n\ninclude $1 for this one).\n\nFail Safe\n\nThis was one of the working names for Countermeasure. The game\n\nis identical except for the name.\n\nFinal Legacy\n\nRecently discovered and demonstrated for the first time at\n\nWorld of Atari '98 in Las Vegas. Nearly identical to the\n\nAtari computer version.\n\nThere were two versions of this game for the Atari 8-bit\n\ncomputers. One had text for in-game selections while the other\n\nused icons. This version uses text, probably since the 5200\n\nwasnt exactly an international success. Seems complete.\n\nFor more info on this game - including screenshots - check out\n\nAtari Gaming Headquarters (http://www.atarihq.com).\n\nFootball\n\nDesigned and implemented by Jim Huether, who years later also\n\ndesigned the Sega Genesis game \"Joe Montana's Sportstalk\n\nFootball\". One of the many games that is trak-ball compatible.\n\nOriginally just called \"Football\", Atari changed the name to\n\nfit their RealSports line-up.\n\nScore 199 points or more without allowing the other team to\n\nscore more than 3 during a practice game in regulation time.\n\nYou must also score the last touchdown with no time left.\n\nInstead of seeing the usual \"Game Over\" message you will see\n\n\"DESIGNED BY THE WARLORD\" on your screen.\n\nFootball (for Video System X)\n\nPhotos of this game, along with the Video System X (working\n\ntitle of the 5200) were shown at trade shows and in magazines\n\nbefore the 5200 was eventually released. The cart had a\n\ncompletely different label from 5200 Football, and it is not\n\nknown whether this game is any different from the 5200 version\n\n(or if it was just a cart shell mockup, for that matter).\n\nFrisky Tom\n\nAn unreleased game based on the coin-op by Nichibutsu, this\n\ngame seems complete and is very playable. It even has the girl\n\nin the bath-tub. Frisky Tom pretty much popped out of nowhere.\n\nIt was never mentioned in any magazines or literature and\n\nuntil it was found with several other protos, no-one even knew\n\nit existed. Only a precious few are known to exist.\n\nFrogger\n\nPlayers have the option of using the keypad buttons to control\n\nthe direction of Frogger's movement. Press button #2 to hop\n\nFrogger forward, #8 to hop back, #4 to go left and #6 to go\n\nright.\n\nFrogger II: Threeedeep!\n\nThree distinctly different screens take Frogger on another\n\nhomeward-bound journey, but this time it's underwater, over\n\nwater, and through the air. As in Frogger, the player can\n\nchoose to use the keypad buttons to control Frogger.\n\nGalaxian\n\nThe manual mentions that after wave 10, the Galaxian fleet\n\nmay surprise you with some special screen graphics. The only\n\nthing we've ever seen is sometimes when you destroy a Galaxian,\n\nan Atari symbol will flash briefly in the explosion.\n\nGorf\n\nProgrammed by Roklan Corp.\n\nGremlins\n\nDesigned and programmed by John Seghers. Animation by Courtney\n\nGranner. Sound by Robert Vieira. This game is completely\n\ndifferent from the 2600 version.\n\nGyruss\n\nLicensed from Konami. The game music is Johann Sebastian\n\nBach's \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\".\n\nH.E.R.O.\n\nDesigned by John Van Ryzin. 5200 adaptation by The Softworks.\n\nH.E.R.O. stands for Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation.\n\nScoring over 70,000 points got you an \"Order of the H.E.R.O.\"\n\npatch by sending proof to Activision along with $1.\n\nJames Bond 007\n\nContains 4 movie scenarios: Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who\n\nLoved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only.\n\nJr. Pac-Man\n\nThe game appears complete, but it was not released commercially.\n\nAn absolutely phenomenal conversion of the coin-op. Smooth\n\nscrolling and crisp sounds make this the best of the three Pac's\n\nin the 5200 library.\n\nJungle River Cruise\n\nDesigned for Atari's unreleased \"Puffer\" exercise bicycle, a\n\nprototype version of this game has recently been discovered.\n\nFormerly titled 'Riverboat' and 'River Rescue'.\n\nKaboom!\n\nDesigned by Larry Kaplan. 5200 adaptation by Paul Willson.\n\nThe SuperSystem version is similar to the 2600 edition, but the\n\nformer has an added feature of allowing two players to take\n\nturns playing the Mad Bomber (dropping the bombs), and catching\n\nthe bombs with the buckets. By Paul Wilson.\n\nBy scoring 1800 or more points in 1 player mode and sending in a\n\npicture of the score, players were awarded the Bucket Brigade\n\nPatch from Activision.\n\nKeystone Kapers\n\nDesigned by Garry Kitchen. 5200 adaptation by Alex DeMeo.\n\nKrull\n\nAnnounced but never released. Only a prototype box of this game\n\nis known to exist. Furthermore, this box shares the same color\n\nscheme as the 2600 version of the same name, and even the \"CX\"\n\nnumber on the box is identical to the regular 2600 box\n\n(CX 2682).\n\nLast Starfighter, The\n\nProgrammed by Gary Stark. This title went through a name change\n\nand became Star Raiders 2; only seeing release for the Atari\n\n8-bit line of computers. Apparently, Atari purchased the rights\n\nbut decided a sequel to Star Raiders would be better embraced\n\nby the masses. Also, it is possible that this title began its\n\nlife as a game called \"Orbiter\". The game seems complete except\n\nfor the lack of shields.\n\nLoco-motion\n\nMattel had at least the Intellivision rights to this game, but\n\na prototype box of this game from Atari exists. No word on\n\nwhether a prototype cart exists at all.\n\nLooney Tunes Hotel\n\nUtilizing the Warner Bros. cartoon licenses, this game\n\nfeatured Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Devil\n\n(Tasmanian, we assume). The game seems to be in the early to\n\nmiddle stages of development. You control Bugs as he tries to\n\nget the carrots while avoiding the bombs, etc.\n\nMeebzork\n\nAn adventure game for the 5200 with 6 stages of fun. This proto\n\nstill has a few bugs that cause screen freezes and blackouts.\n\nAlso, the game requires some precise movements which is almost\n\nimpossible with the standard 5200 stick. Graphics aren't bad\n\nand include a nice 3-D effect on the Phoenix stage.\n\nMegamania\n\nDesigned by Steve Cartwright. 5200 adaptation by Glyn Anderson.\n\nActivision would send you an official MegaManiacs emblem if you\n\nsent them proof that you scored 45,000 points or more.\n\nMeteorites\n\nNow here's an interesting tidbit. The working title of this\n\nAsteroids clone during its development stage was 'Disasteroids'!\n\nHowever, when Atari learned of the name upon visiting Electra\n\nConcepts' booth at the 1983 Summer Consumer Electronics Show,\n\nthey quickly threatened to sue unless Electra changed the game\n\ntitle. Both Meteorites and the Masterplay Interface are\n\nsometimes listed as being made by a company called Intellicon.\n\nIn actuality, Intellicon was nothing more than a mail-order\n\ncompany that bought and sold off the remaining inventory from\n\nElectra Concepts.\n\nMicro-gammon SB\n\nProgrammed by Steve Baker. A nice backgammon game for the\n\n5200. This game uses the keypad and fire buttons only; no\n\njoystick. The SB stands for Super Brain (not Steve Baker) and\n\nis one of the IQ settings for the computer opponent The game\n\nseems essentially complete.\n\nMillipede\n\nComplete. Exceptional port of the coin-op hit. Especially fun\n\nwhen played with the trak-ball.\n\nMiner 2049er\n\nProgrammed by Bill Hogue. Graphics and Audio Visual Displays\n\ndesigned by Curtis Mikolyski and Bill Hogue with Jeff Konyu and\n\nKelly Bakst. Circuitry designed by Bill Hogue. Package Artwork\n\nby Scott Ross.\n\nStart a zone. Jump onto the first platform and position Bounty\n\nBob so that no creatures will touch him (do NOT pause game).\n\nHold the UPPER red fire button down while entering Big Five's\n\nphone number (2137826861) on the keypad. You will know you did\n\nit right because it will immediately restart the zone again when\n\nyou enter the last digit of the phone number.\n\nCongratulations, you now have a way to \"warp\" to any zone or\n\nstation in the game!\n\nHOW TO USE IT\n\nPush the reset button on the joystick and select 1-0 on the\n\nkeypad for the zone you want to play.\n\n(1=zone 1, 2=zone 2, ... 0=zone 10).\n\nNow, hold the upper red button down while pressing 1-0 on the\n\nkeypad. This will allow you to select which station to play.\n\nYou will immediately warp to the selected station! The warping\n\nability will work at *ANY* time during the game! This is\n\nextremely useful for getting \"unlimited\" lives. (HINT: If you\n\ndie on a level and IMMEDIATELY warp Bounty Bob, the game will\n\nkeep track of your score, but won't take away a life!)\n\nNOTES: Miner is great fun at the difficult levels. Some levels\n\nare NOT clearable. After lots of playing, the following levels\n\nhave been found to be possible to clear.\n\nZONE STATION\n\n---- -------\n\n1-8 ALL\n\n9 1-9\n\n10 1-4, 8, 9\n\nZone 8/station 10 is the hardest, but IS possible.\n\nZone 10/station 4 requires a lot of thinking/strategy to clear.\n\nTry it, it's fun!\n\nFor some reason on Zone 10, Bounty Bob walks very fast and jumps\n\na LOOONG way. This makes certain levels difficult and others\n\nimpossible. However, on Zone 10/station 10, the creatures just\n\nmove too fast to make it possible to clear. It's a shame, we\n\nwill always be left wondering what would happen if it had been\n\ncleared.\n\nMiniature Golf\n\nProgrammed by Steve Baker. Looks to be complete. So-so\n\ngraphics, with 18 holes and varying layouts. What's there is\n\nquite impressive.\n\nMountain King\n\nDesigned by E.F. Dryer.\n\nWhen first starting Mountain King, let it go through the\n\n\"opening demonstration\" where the MK guy jumps/dances to the\n\nmusic and eventually jumps to the top of the hill where the\n\nflame is. Once the \"show\" ends, maneuver the guy to the very\n\nbottom where the spider's \"cave\" is. Stand on top of where the\n\nspider comes out. Make the MK guy (does he have a name?) stand\n\non the far right of the cave so that he is mostly balancing in\n\nmid-air with only his left foot barely touching the top of the\n\ncave. (See diagram 1... hopefully it will look right when viewed\n\non your computer.)\n\n(1) (2)\n\n0 <-- mk guy ->_ _\n\n__________________________ _____________________________\n\nOk, once you have him in position, pull down briefly/slightly\n\n(like you were going to make him squat) on the joystick once or\n\ntwice and the guy should walk PART WAY DOWN the side of the cave\n\nand \"hang\" there. If he goes all the way to the floor, then try\n\nit again. (See diagram 2.)\n\nNow walk to the left. He should fall through/into the cave.\n\nKeep going left... you might have to jump to the left to get him\n\nto fall THROUGH the bottom of the screen. As you are falling,\n\nyou should see a special message that tells who programmed the\n\ngame!\n\nNOTES: When you do this, there is no way back out. Actually, I\n\nthink you can catch on fire and die. :) This doesn't work right\n\nif you don't let the game do the demonstration/music sequence at\n\nthe beginning.\n\nMs. Pac-Man (\"Puffer\" Edition)\n\nDesigned for Atari's unreleased \"Puffer\" exercise bicycle, this\n\ngame was never planned for release. It was only developed for\n\ninternal testing purposes as an example of a type of game that\n\nwas not well-suited for the Puffer.\n\nPac-Man\n\nThis version includes the arcade intermissions. The Galaxian\n\nbonus item in the arcade version has been replaced with an Atari\n\nlogo. Pac-man later replaced Super Breakout as the pack-in game\n\nfor the 5200.\n\nOn the Cherry screen, take off to the right and head straight up\n\nand into the right-hand tunnel. As you go off-screen, you'll\n\nhear a chomp. Pause the game and examine the dots to the left\n\nof the starting point. You'll find a missing dot.\n\nOn the fifth key round, the ghosts start flashing immediately\n\nafter Pac eats a power pellet, and they don't stop. Unless Pac\n\neats them, they stay in a vulnerable state for the entire round.\n\nIt doesn't happen in the sixth key round (after the\n\nintermission), but does for the seventh key and beyond. You\n\nhave to be pretty stupid to die accidentally from there on.\n\nNamed first runner up in the best 5200 game category and best\n\narcade adaptation (all systems) in the first annual Videogaming\n\nIllustrated \"Vista\" awards.\n\nPengo\n\nProgrammed by Sean W. Hennessy.\n\nPete's Test Cartridge\n\nRecently discovered, this system utility essentially tests for\n\ndefects in key areas. Using a standard 5200 controller to select\n\nvarious options, you can test for brightness (or dimness), color\n\nbalance, color contrast and joystick calibration, among other\n\nthings. And no, we have no idea who Pete is.\n\nFor more info on this demo - including screenshots - check out\n\nAtari Gaming Headquarters (http://www.atarihq.com).\n\nPitfall!\n\nDesigned by David Crane. 5200 adaptation by Beck-Tech. Scoring\n\nover 20,000 points could get you an \"Explorer's Club\" patch by\n\nsending proof to Activision.\n\nPitfall II: Lost Caverns\n\nDesigned by David Crane. 5200 Adventurer's Edition by Mike\n\nLorenzen. What makes this version The Adventurer's Edition?\n\nThe fact that once you completed the game, you could play a\n\nsecond, even more difficult mission, with a completely\n\ndifferent maze (Write us for a layout). Scoring over 99,000\n\npoints could get you a \"Cliff Hangers\" patch by sending proof\n\nto Activision along with $1.\n\nPopeye\n\nThis game came with a scratch-off \"Spinach Can Game\" card which\n\ngave you a chance to win a full size Popeye Arcade game or a\n\nPopeye T-shirt.\n\nMissing the Sea Hag found in level 3 of the coin-op.\n\nPole Position (\"Puffer\" Edition)\n\nDesigned for Atari's unreleased \"Puffer\" exercise bicycle.\n\nUnlike Jungle River Cruise and Tumbleweeds, however, a prototype\n\nversion of this game has not (yet) been uncovered.\n\nPursuit of the Pink Panther.\n\nOriginally slated for an early 1984 release, the lack of\n\nadequate supplies of ROM chips was blamed by Probe 2000 as the\n\nreason for the cancellation of the game. 2600 and Colecovision\n\neditions were also announced but they too never saw the light of\n\nday.\n\nQ*Bert\n\nInvisible Pyramid -- On the first screen, hop down four squares\n\nand onto the disc. As soon as the disc turns yellow, press\n\nPAUSE and then the START key to start the game over. Keep\n\npressing the HOP button the whole time you are doing this. When\n\nthe game starts again, jump down 2 squares to the right, then\n\nback one square. Jump onto the middle square and then change\n\nthe colors of the squares opposite the one on the right. Now\n\nhop up to the top square and off to the left onto the invisible\n\npyramid.\n\nQuest for Quintana Roo\n\n\"Help Yucatan Sam explore the dozens of terror-filled chambers\n\nthat create the mystical temple of Mayan god Quintana Roo. You\n\nmust use your supplies as well as your cat-like reactions to\n\navoid the sleeping snakes, overcome the mummy's curse, and\n\neliminate the other adversaries while attempting to solve the\n\nmystery that will deliver this hidden treasure to you and\n\nYucatan Sam. Do you dare to get involved?\"\n\nPasswords:\n\nLevel 2 -- 1830 Level 3 -- 8817\n\nRealSports Baseball\n\nDesigned and programmed by James Andreasen and Keithen. One\n\nof two Atari releases to feature voice synthesis (Berzerk being\n\nthe other.) The 0 key toggles the voice on and off.\n\nRealSports Basketball\n\nProgrammed by Patrick Bass. This game was in the early stages\n\nof development and needs some polishing. The game is playable,\n\nhowever, the real beauty of this proto lies in the easter eggs.\n\nAs a side note, we've seen 2 versions of R.S. Basketball, one\n\ndated 13 Oct. 83 and the other 31 Oct. 83. The easter eggs\n\nlisted below only work on the later version.\n\nStart the Demo and press the number 5 key for a secret message:\n\n\"When Running Into the Tropical Entropy Nightly, By Yourself,\n\nProject And Try Reaching Into Circles Killed Because All Seems\n\nStrange.\"\n\nThe first letter of each word in the sentence spells out....\n\n\"Written by Patrick Bass.\"\n\nAlso during the demo, the \"*\" key toggles the word RealSports\n\non or off.\n\nThe tones generated by the keypad are actual telephone dialing\n\ntones. Try it!\n\nRealSports Football\n\nSee Football.\n\nRealSports Soccer\n\nSee Soccer\n\nRealSports Tennis\n\nDesigned by Sean W. Hennessy. One of the many games that is\n\ntrak-ball compatible.\n\nRescue on Fractalus\n\nDesigned and programmed by David Fox, Loren Carpenter, Charlie\n\nKellner, and Peter Langston. Contributions and support by Gary\n\nWinnick and David Levine. One of only two Atari released games\n\nthat came in a white box (Ballblazer was the other) instead of\n\nthe standard issue grey and blue box. This game is also one of\n\nthe few Atari titles that has no name on the cartridge label.\n\nWorking titles were \"Behind Jaggi Lines\", \"Rescue Mission\" and\n\nStar Mission.\"\n\nRiver Raid\n\nDesigned by Carol Shaw. Scoring 40,000 points or more entitled\n\nyou to a River Raiders patch if you sent a picture of your TV\n\nscreen to Activision.\n\nRoad Runner\n\nIf you're thinking of the arcade game, forget it. This game\n\nresembles a sliding piece puzzle. We're not sure if the\n\nobject of the game is to help the coyote to catch the Road\n\nRunner or to keep the two from colliding while eating all the\n\nbirdseed, etc. There are 2 versions of this prototype around.\n\nOne has sound (although minimal) and different colors on the\n\nopening screen while the other has no sound at all. Still\n\nsome work to be done on this one.\n\nRobotron: 2084\n\nNot as good as the 7800 version, but is actually more enjoyable\n\nbecause of the joystick connector that allows you dual-joystick\n\naction like in the coin-op. Packaged with the joystick\n\nconnector.\n\nSkiing\n\nThe box for this game was shown in a flyer for the \"Video\n\nSystem X.\"\n\nSoccer\n\nDesigned by John Seghers. One of the many games that is\n\ntrak-ball compatible. Originally just called \"Soccer\", Atari\n\nchanged the name to fit their RealSports line-up.\n\nOn par with NASL Soccer for Intellivision. Particularly\n\nenjoyable when played with the trak-ball controller.\n\nSpace Dungeon\n\nThe only home console port of Taito's little-known gem of a\n\ncoin-op. Packaged with a joystick connector which enables dual\n\njoystick control a-la Robotron: 2084.\n\nSpace Invaders\n\nOne of the many games that is trak-ball compatible. The game\n\nscreen on the back of the box, and in the instruction manual\n\nis not an actual screen shot. In trying to re-work this\n\nclassic, Atari dropped the ball. The saucers appear one right\n\nafter the other and their max value is 60 points. Your shields\n\ndon't reset after each wave. After every 7th wave, the mother\n\nship comes out and flies off with your cannon. The game then\n\nresets the shields and the invaders start back at the top of\n\nthe screen. The 1986 release of this game is one of the few\n\nAtari titles that has no name on the cartridge label. It's\n\nharder to find than the standard label version.\n\nSpace Shuttle\n\nDesigned by Steve Kitchen. 5200 adaptation by Bob Henderson.\n\nSteve Kitchen apparently consulted with NASA to make this game\n\nas accurate as possible. Like many other Activision titles,\n\nthis game was later released in a 2600 box w/ photocopied\n\ninstructions. Dock your shuttle 5 times and land with at\n\nleast 4500 units of fuel and you were entitled to a Space\n\nShuttle Pilot patch. Dock 6 times and land with at least\n\n7500 units of fuel and you earned a Space Shuttle Commander\n\npatch. Just send the usual TV picture proof to Activision.\n\nSpitfire\n\nThis seems to be a Zaxxon style game, but with full 360 degree\n\nmovement and Crystal Castles style structures. Obviously in\n\nthe very early stages of development.\n\nSport Goofy\n\nIn it's current form, this game consists of two separate\n\n\"events\". One is a platform Sky Diver type game where you\n\nguide Goofy to the top of a structure and then when he jumps\n\noff, you guide him into a waiting raft below. The other game\n\nis a Q*bert type game where you try to pop the overhead\n\nballoons as you hop between squares.\n\nStargate\n\nProgrammed by Steve Baker. The sequel to Defender suffers\n\nfrom screen flicker and poor control. Let's hope it was still\n\nin the early stages as we would hate to think this was almost\n\nready for release.\n\nStar Raiders\n\nOriginally a smash hit on the Atari 400/800 computers, Star\n\nRaiders is enshrined in the Electronic Games Magazine Videogame\n\nHall of Fame.\n\nSuper Breakout\n\nOne of the few games that supports 4 players on the older\n\n4-port models. Also one of the many games that is trak-ball\n\ncompatible. This game was initially packaged with the Atari\n\n5200 console, but was later replaced by Pac-Man.\n\nSuperman III\n\nA box for this game exists, but an actual prototype game of\n\nSuperman III has not yet been recovered. A prototype version\n\nfor the Atari home computers does exist, however.\n\nSuper Pac-Man\n\nRecently discovered! Was demonstrated for the first time at\n\nWorld of Atari '98 in Las Vegas. An absolutely fantastic\n\ntranslation -- nothing from the coin-op is missing in this one.\n\nFor more info on this game - including screenshots - check out\n\nAtari Gaming Headquarters (http://www.atarihq.com).\n\nTank\n\nThe original (tentative) name of Countermeasure before its\n\nrelease. Who knows, perhaps a prototype of this version exists\n\nsomewhere.\n\nTank Battle\n\nThe box art of this game was shown in a flyer for the \"Video\n\nSystem X.\"\n\nTempest\n\nIt's been found! Demonstrated for the first time at World of\n\nAtari '98 in Las Vegas, the only prototype cartridge known to\n\nexist is 90% complete, with only the Superzapper, several\n\nenemies and collision detection missing. For more info on\n\nthis game - including screenshots - check out Atari Gaming\n\nHeadquarters (http://www.atarihq.com).\n\nTicker Tape Demo\n\nRecently discovered and shown for the first time at World of\n\nAtari '98 in Las Vegas. Basically just a generic 5200 title\n\nscreen, except that after seeing Rubio's copyright info, the\n\nphrase \"Again Rubio Scores!\" replaces the top line and begins\n\nto scroll and move side-to-side, banging on the left and right\n\nedges. Each time the phrase hits the outer edge of the screen,\n\none of the letters on the outside disappears. This continues\n\nto occur until the word \"Rubio\" is left. This custom scrolling\n\ndemo was done internally for Dan Kramer and DK Enterprises.\n\nOnly one is know to exist. For more info on this demo, check\n\nout Atari Gaming Headquarters\n\n(http://www.atarihq.com).\n\nToy Bizarre\n\nMade it to the C64, but not 5200.\n\nTrack 'N Field\n\nLicensed from Konami. This one was probably ready for\n\nproduction. Seems very complete with no noticeable bugs or\n\nglitches.\n\nTumbleweeds\n\nDesigned for Atari's unreleased \"Puffer\" exercise bicycle, a\n\nprototype version of this game has recently been discovered.\n\nVanguard\n\nThis game would have been perfect for 2 joystick control a-la\n\nSpace Dungeon and Robotron. The 1986 release of this game is\n\none of the few Atari titles that has no name on the cartridge\n\nlabel. It's harder to find than the standard label version.\n\nWarp Wars\n\nWarp Wars was the working title for the game Zone Ranger.\n\nWizard of Wor\n\nProgrammed by Roklan Corp.\n\nXari Arena\n\nProgrammed by David Seghers. This game seems to be an updated\n\nBreakout type of game. What are those flying things in the\n\nmiddle of the screen? Havent figured out how to play it yet\n\nbut it looks good.\n\nXevious\n\nProgrammed by Jim Huether. This very nice conversion of the\n\ncoin-op utilizes both fire buttons. No noticeable bugs or\n\nglitches.\n\nYellow Submarine Demo\n\nNot really a game, but rather a graphics demo where you\n\ncontrol a submarine on the screen with your joystick. Only a\n\nprecious few are known to exist.\n\nZone Ranger\n\nWarp Wars was its working title.\n\n2.6 -- WHAT'S THE REAL STORY BEHIND CLOAK AND DAGGER?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nMany die-hard collectors and 5200 fans are aware that a Cloak and\n\nDagger (and, for that matter, Tempest) cartridge was shown in the\n\nmove of the same name as sort of a tantalizing preview of the game.\n\nWhat nobody knew, however, was whether Cloak and Dagger existed as\n\na prototype, or if the game code even existed in any form.\n\nAlex Rosenberg gave us the definitive answer in 1994 when he posted\n\nto rec.games.video.classic. Here are some snippets from his\n\nnewsgroup article.\n\n-------\n\nFrom: alexr@apple.com (Alex Rosenberg)\n\nRe: 5200 Cloak and Dagger cartridge\n\nDate: Mon Sep 12 1994\n\nI can give the definitive answer here. I used to work with the author\n\nof the 5200 version of Cloak and Dagger. I've previously asked him\n\nabout it, and he had sent me the\n\nfollowing message:\n\n--- CUT HERE ---\n\nYes, I can answer your question about the Atari 5200 version of Cloak\n\n& Dagger.\n\nWhen Warner Communications sold the consumer side of Atari to Jack\n\nTramiel (who founded Commodore) in mid-1984, I was working on the\n\nAtari 400/800/1200 version of Cloak & Dagger. Since the Atari 5200\n\nwas basically just an Atari 400 with a different controller, when I\n\ncompleted the home computer version, I was supposed to modify the\n\ngame to use the \"360-degree\" 5200 controller (as opposed to the\n\n9-position home computer joystick).\n\nBy the way here's a little known fact about Cloak & Dagger: someone\n\nat Atari actually explored doing an Atari 2600 version of Cloak &\n\nDagger, but very quickly decided that it couldn't be done, even with\n\nmajor simplifications...\n\nIf you've ever seen the Cloak & Dagger movie, you'll know that the\n\ncartridge shown in the movie was a 5200 cartridge. Actually, the 5200\n\ncartridge didn't even exist: it was a 5200 cartridge of another game\n\nwith a \"Cloak & Dagger\" label slapped on it. Also, in the game store\n\nscenes, there were Atari 5200 Cloak & Dagger boxes shown. Those were\n\nalso just mockups made for the movie.\n\nBut wait a second! Wasn't the Atari 5200 Cloak & Dagger game actually\n\nPLAYED in the movie (and didn't it look damn good)? Hollywood movie\n\nmagic! They took the output of the coin-operated game, converted the\n\nsignal, and piped it to a TV set. So if you thought it looked a lot\n\nlike the coin-op game, you were right. Another interesting fact:\n\nHenry Thomas wasn't really playing the game; instead, Atari sent down\n\nthe game's software developer, Rusty Dawe, to play the coin-op game\n\nfor the movie! So they showed Henry Thomas furiously working the 5200\n\ncontroller, cut to the television showing Rusty's progress in the\n\ngame (sometimes even with Henry's reflection in the screen), and back\n\nagain. Rusty -- er, make that Russell B. Dawe -- got his own full-\n\nscreen credit at the end of the movie for the game design.\n\nAlthough the rest of the game shown in the movie was taken from the\n\nreal coin-op game, the spectacular 3D \"secret plans\" finale of the\n\ngame was pure Holywood animation: the real game ends somewhat anti-\n\nclimactically with one of several static, crudely-drawn blueprints. I\n\ndon't recall whether Rusty ran short of ROM space or time, but the\n\nsecret plans weren't up to the quality of the rest of the game, much\n\nless the movie game's ending.\n\nOh, and another piece of trivia: the original name of the Cloak &\n\nDagger coin-operated game was actually...Agent X (hence the name of\n\nthe protagonist in the game and the off-hand comment by Dabney\n\nColeman in the movie that he \"used to be known as Agent X\"). The game\n\nhad been under development at Atari as \"Agent X\" for quite a while,\n\nand was nearly completed. The movie studio (can't remember which one\n\noff-hand, but I have the Laserdisc) had the movie under development\n\nas Cloak & Dagger. The game cartridge that was in the original\n\nscreenplay was...Donkey Kong (at the time, the most popular home\n\nvideogame)! Someone at either the movie studio or Atari found out\n\nabout the other, \"the secret agent recovers secret plans from bad\n\nguys\" plots sounded like they were made for each other, the deal was\n\nsigned, and the Agent X game was renamed Cloak & Dagger.\n\nAnyway, back to the layoff. My half of Atari (the half that just\n\nreleased the Jaguar videogame system; it's still known as \"Atari,\n\nInc.\") got sold, and they laid off almost all the game developers who\n\ndidn't have experience writing operating systems, myself included.\n\nWhen the layoffs happened, I was close to halfway done with the game.\n\nThe basic structure of all the levels was done (conveyor belts,\n\nboxes, bubbling acid pits, box manufacturers, minefields) and you\n\ncould move Agent X around, pick up boxes, and die from touching red\n\nboxes, being crushed by the box manufacturing thingies (what the hell\n\nwere they called?), stepping in an acid pit, or touching a landmine\n\n(although the death animation wasn't in yet, so you just turned pitch\n\nblack).\n\nBut none of the enemies were done, you couldn't shoot yet (although,\n\nwithout enemies, you would only be able to shoot the boxes anyway),\n\nand the bomb in the center didn't explode (the animation of the bomb\n\nexploding in the coin-op game is fast, but it's actually pretty\n\ncrude). No elevator scenes yet, either, although since the cartridge\n\nwas supposed to be the first Atari home computer cartridge to reach a\n\nwhopping 32K (all previous cartridges had been 16K or less!), there\n\nwas enough room for many -- if not all -- of the elevator animations.\n\n(If you look closely, you'll notice that very little of Agent X\n\nactually moves in the elevator scenes: an arm, a facial expression,\n\nsmoke, an arm and a yo-yo, etc.)\n\nIn 1983, at one of Atari's periodic auctions of prototype and no\n\nlonger needed coin-operated machines (including games like DigDug and\n\nBerzerk whose translations to Atari home computers and/or videogame\n\nsystems had already been completed), I bought one of the original 25\n\n(I believe) Agent X machines. These prototypes, which had been sent\n\nto arcades for test-marketing, had stereo sound (Atari went with mono\n\nsound for the final hardware) and the pre-Cloak & Dagger faceplates.\n\nThe ROMs were upgraded to reflect the name change, however, so, on\n\nthe inside, my machine is a real Cloak & Dagger!\n\nAnyway, hope you enjoyed the history and stories. I'd always wanted\n\nto finish the home computer version of Cloak & Dagger, but over the\n\nyears, my free time has almost completed vanished. The Atari 5200\n\nversion of Cloak & Dagger, as well as versions of many other classic\n\nAtari games -- Crystal Castles (which was nearly finished when the\n\nlayoff happened), Major Havoc (one of my favorite coin-op games, but\n\nthe home computer conversion was barely started at the time of the\n\nlayoffs), and Jr. Pac-Man (completed, but not released), to name just\n\na few -- were all casualties of the sale of Atari's consumer business\n\nto Tramiel and the resulting layoffs. Everyone who was left\n\nimmediately switched from developing games (new as well as\n\nconversions of coin-operated games) to working on the operating\n\nsystem for the Atari 520ST and 1040ST.\n\nSorry to dash your hopes about the Atari 5200 Cloak & Dagger...\n\n-- Dave Comstock\n\n2.7 -- WHAT GAMES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE TRAK-BALL CONTROLLER?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* -- Plays best when used with the trak-ball\n\n# -- Some gamers prefer to play it with the trak-ball, others don't.\n\nX -- Works with the trak-ball but is not recommended.\n\n* Centipede\n\n# Football/RealSports Football\n\nX Galaxian\n\n# Kaboom!\n\nX K-Razy Shootout\n\n* Millipede\n\n* Missile Command\n\nX Pole Position\n\nX RealSports Baseball\n\n# Soccer/RealSports Soccer\n\nX Space Invaders\n\n# Super Breakout\n\n2.8 -- WHAT IS THE 5200 MULTICART AND HOW CAN I GET ONE?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Atari 5200 multi-cart is a single cartridge with virtually\n\nthe entire Atari 5200 game library on it -- even prototypes.

It was a trimmed down version of the 5200, much\n\nlike how the 2600jr. was a low-cost redesign of the woodgrain\n\nVCS/2600.\n\nAtari 5200 Carrying Case\n\nMade of durable hard plastic and shaped like a suitcase, it can\n\nstore the console, power supply and two joysticks. Similar to\n\nthe cases found in Blockbuster video for systems that it rents\n\nout to its customers.\n\nAtari 7800 Cartridge Adapter\n\nAnnounced but never released. This adapter would have allowed\n\n5200 owners to play 7800 games without buying the 7800 system\n\nseparately (although the savings would probably have been\n\nnegligible).\n\nAtari 5200 Joystick Coupler\n\nAllowed dual-joystick action for Robotron: 2084 and Space\n\nDungeon by snapping two 5200 joysticks into place using this\n\nconnector. Packaged with both Robotron: 2084 and Space Dungeon,\n\nand was not sold separately.\n\nAtari Video System X\n\nThe working title of the 5200 before Atari opted for a\n\nnumerical designation for its \"third wave\" videogame system.\n\nActual photos of the VS-X, which looked almost exactly like the\n\n5200 with the exception of a few cosmetic differences such as on\n\nthe face plate, were shown throughout contemporary magazines\n\nfor much of 1982.\n\nCompetition Pro Joystick\n\nAn excellent third-party controller, the Competition Pro is\n\nmicro-switch based, giving a satisfying \"click, click\" response\n\nto movements in the joystick. (Arguably) Better than the Wico\n\nCommand Control Joystick, but harder to find.\n\nControl Guide\n\nHere's a novel approach. Since games like Pac-Man require\n\npin-point precision control (something the 5200 sticks are\n\nincapable of), Newport Controls decided to limit the movement\n\nof the stick. They designed a piece of plastic that goes over\n\nthe top of a standard controller. It has grooves that only\n\nallows the stick to go up, down, left, and right. A steal for\n\nthe $6.95 they originally sold for; so how come there aren't\n\nmore of these floating around?\n\nFire Command Joystick\n\nOffering a slightly different feel than its non-analog cousin\n\nfor the 2600, the 5200-compatible version featured two buttons\n\nand a y-adapter that must be connected to the keypad for full\n\ncompatibility (like the Wico and Competition Pro).\n\nFrob, The\n\nAllowed its owners to program 5200 games using an Apple\n\nII/II+/IIe computer.\n\nKid's Controller\n\nSimilar to the 2600 Kid's Controller, only one prototype of\n\nthis peripheral is known to exist. Astro Grover and Big Bird's\n\nHide & Seek are but two of the titles believed to support this\n\ndevice.\n\nMasterplay Interface\n\nWithout a doubt, this is the ultimate solution to your\n\n5200 joystick woes. Quite simply, this handy little box allows\n\nyou to use 2600 compatible joysticks on the 5200 and has a port\n\nto plug in a standard Atari joystick for keypad functions, etc.\n\nFor games that required the top fire button on a standard\n\nstick, the Masterplay comes packaged with an auxiliary fire\n\nbutton that does the job very well. There are two different\n\nboxes available for the Interface; one is similar to a cartridge\n\nbox and the other is a smaller yet wider box. Both the\n\nMasterplay Interface and Meteorites are sometimes listed as\n\nbeing made by a company called Intellicon. In actuality,\n\nIntellicon was nothing more than a mail-order company that\n\nbought and sold off the remaining inventory from Electra Concepts.\n\nPaddle Controller\n\nRecently discovered, this device is identical in appearance to\n\nthe standard 5200 joystick controller, except that a paddle is\n\nfound on the top of the controller where the joystick is\n\nnormally located.\n\nPOP Demo Kiosk\n\nPOP stands for Point Of Purchase. These demo units allowed\n\ngamers to sample several 5200 carts. Much like the demo kiosks\n\nfor newer systems.\n\nPuffer, The\n\nA home exercise bicycle with two hand grip controllers, a wheel\n\nspeed pickup, and the necessary interfacing for an Atari\n\ncomputer or 5200. For detailed information, see the Puffer\n\nsection elsewhere in this FAQ.\n\nTrak-Ball Controller (Transparent)\n\nRecently discovered, the clear Trak-Ball was used for\n\npromotional purposes only and was never planned for release.\n\nTriga Elite Joystick\n\nOnly a very few of these were made. It is not known whether\n\nthey made it past the prototype stage and onto store shelves.\n\nThis joystick had two fire buttons, an adjustable rapid-fire\n\nbutton, and a digital - analog switch. A picture can be seen on\n\nthe back of the Masterplay Interface box (2nd stick from the\n\nleft).\n\nVoice Commander Module\n\nMilton Bradley and Atari were jointly associated with this\n\nspeech synthesis/recognition device, where Milton Bradley was to\n\ndevelop the add-on while Atari was responsible for developing\n\ngames for it. However, Atari canned the idea shortly\n\nthereafter. A module for the 2600 was also planned, but it too\n\nwas axed before development went too far. Milton Bradley later\n\nsued Atari for breach of contract.\n\nWico Command Control Joystick\n\nAn analog (but self-centering) controller that featured two\n\nfire buttons and the ability to calibrate the joysticks. Came\n\npackaged with a y-adapter cord which enabled the use of keypad\n\nfunctions of the standard 5200 controller.\n\nWico Command Control Numeric Keypad\n\nA stand-alone keypad which substituted for the 5200 joystick\n\nkeypad when used in conjunction with the Wico joystick.\n\nAlthough this item had a 9-pin connector, it was only compatible\n\nwith the Wico controller. Sold separately from the joystick.\n\n3.4 -- WHAT WAS THE TOP-SECRET \"PUFFER PROJECT\"?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSensing an opportunity to bring health fitness and videogames\n\ntogether, in 1982 Atari embarked on \"Project Puffer,\" a top-secret\n\nmission to develop a home exercise bike with two hand grip\n\ncontrollers, a wheel speed pickup, and the necessary attachments\n\nfor an Atari computer or 5200. By interfacing their machines to an\n\nexercise bicycle, Atari planned to make exercising fun.\n\nThe Puffer featured hand controllers which easily attached to most\n\nexisting exercise cycles and gave the conscientious user directional\n\ncontrol. The act of peddling was to give the imaginary vehicle\n\nmotion and the rider exercise. Therefore, no peddling--no motion.\n\nFor the overzealous cyclist, a pulse rate sensor could be added to\n\nmonitor excessive heart beat activity.\n\nThe two hand controllers replaced the original hand grips on the\n\nexercycle. The Puffer controllers were designed to fit as many of\n\nthe current exercycles as possible while at the same time remaining\n\ninexpensive and durable. A magnet attached to the wheel monitored\n\nthe wheel speed and a Hall effect sensor detected the passing magnet\n\nwhich can be read by the computer to calculate the wheel speed. The\n\nhousing for the sensor was also the junction box for the hand\n\ncontroller cables and the computer cable. The computer required only\n\none cable to be connected to a joystick input.\n\nThree new programs were developed to show Puffer's capabilities in\n\nparticular applications, and one more was modified to show its\n\nlimitations. The games were Jungle River Cruise (originally called\n\n\"Riverboat\"), Tumbleweeds, Pole Position, and Ms. Pac-Man, all for\n\nthe 5200 and 400/800 (a 2600 game appears to have never been\n\ndeveloped).\n\nIn order to reach a wide spectrum of consumers, Atari planned on\n\nproducing three Puffer models - the Pro Model, an Arcade Model and a\n\nHome Model (for the 2600, 5200 and 8-bit computers)\n\nThe Home Model consisted of two types -- a folding exercise bike\n\nsourced on an OEM basis with Atari controls mounted on them, or an\n\nadd-on module for those who already own an exercise bike. The Home\n\nPuffer was to plug into the joystick port of a 5200, 400/800 or VCS.\n\nThe suggested retail price was to be $150 with one game packaged with\n\nthe Puffer. Atari had plans on releasing controllers to fit other\n\nexercise instruments such as rowing machines and foot pads if the\n\nPuffer proved to be a success.\n\nJust as Atari was ready for production of the Puffer and its\n\ncompatible software programs, the project was put in the back burner\n\nas Atari began to lose an incredible amount of money in the\n\nmarketplace. The Puffer was resurrected in early 1984, and Atari\n\nplanned to aggressively market and sell the Puffer in the summer of\n\n1984, with a full-scale marketing campaign that was to coincide with\n\nthe Los Angeles 1984 Olympics.\n\nHowever, the purchase of Atari by Sam Tramiel in the Spring of 1984\n\nbrought an end to the ambitious product, as the new regime under\n\nthe Tramiels sought to identify Atari as a professional home comp"
