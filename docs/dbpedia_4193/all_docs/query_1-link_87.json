Unlike the 5200, the 7800 is fully compatible with the 2600, because it is a 2600, with a 6502 instead of the 2600's chopped-down 6507, a new graphics chip in addition to the 2600's TIA, and 4K of extra RAM. Atari had great plans for this system, the High Score Cart, the 7800 computer add on, and the 7800 trakball were planned but those add-ons were killed.\n\nThe system was roughly on par with the NES in terms of graphics and overall processing power (sound processing on the other hand was greatly inferior to its competitors, at least unless an optional POKEY sound processor was included in the game cartridge), but somewhat unfairly gained a reputation as being much less powerful than the NES, largely due to the number of lazily done ports from its two predecessors.\n\nReleased for one month in 1984, then left to sit in warehouses when Warner sold Atari to ex-Commodore president Jack Tramiel. Jack was uninterested in consoles, and after The Great Video Game Crash of 1983, consoles looked dead anyway.\n\nRe-released in 1986 after the Nintendo Entertainment System revived the console market. Though it never made a dent in the NES' dominance, it did turn a profit, thanks to low development costs and the huge 2600 library. The 7800 sold just under 5 million units in its lifetime, which might not sound impressive now, but was still enough to make it the fourth-best selling console of all time (behind only the NES, the Master System and Atari's own 2600) as of the end of The Eighties. The fact that it managed this feat despite a middling game library and a lack of much support from Atari proved that there was still an appetite for Atari's consoles; unfortunately, the company's following efforts wasted the chance to get back on their feet.\n\nHomebrew development was stalled due to lack of software used to digitally sign officially licensed games in order for them to boot (which was enforced following the scandals spurred by the likes of Custer's Revenge and other unlicensed games). After the program that made that key was found, that opened the 7800 homebrew efforts.\n\nSpecifications\n\nAccessories\n\nStarpath Supercharger\n\nCroco Cart\n\nCuttle Cart\n\nCuttle Cart 2\n\nThe Harmony Cart\n\nAtari 7800 High Score Cartridge\n\n7800 Expansion Module - adds additional RAM and a POKEY chip plus room for even more expanions (currently being worked)\n\n7800 computer (never finished)\n\nGames"
