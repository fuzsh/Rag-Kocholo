        "text": "ATARI VCS/2600 FAQ\n\nLast updated 8-21-2024\n\nThis FAQ is an evolving document. If you have any additions, suggestions, or corrections, please email me.\n\nQ: When was Atari founded?\n\nA: Articles of Incorporation for Atari were filed in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of California on June 27th, 1972, and finalized on July 1st, 1972. Check out Michael Current's excellent website for a copy of the paperwork, as well as for more details on the complete history of Atari.\n\nQ: When was the VCS/2600 developed and who developed it?\n\nA: First conceived in 1975 by Steve Mayer of Cyan Engineering, he felt developing a microprocessor-based home system would be more versatile than the dedicated systems they had been developing (starting with Home Pong). Ron Milner developed the breadboard-level design and the sound circuits that were used for the first prototype that Mayer interfaced that with a JOLT 6502 (which was made by Microcomputer Associates Inc.). Atari hired Joe Decuir to work with Mayer and Milner at Cyan Engineering to debug the prototype, which was code-named \"Stella\". Decuir later took it back to Atari to continue development of a second gate-level design of the prototype (that used the 6507), which was completed in March 1976. The gate-level prototype was designed to mimic as closely as possible the intended final graphics chip, using circuit-design techniques specific to MOS integrated circuits. Jay Miner was brought in to help design the graphics chip,called the Television Interface Adaptor (TIA). The first software written for it by Mayer - later with help from Decuir - was assembled on a DEC PDP-11 minicomputer. See the March 1st, 1983 IEEE Spectrum article, \"Inventing the Atari 2600\").\n\nQ: Who or what is Stella?\n\nA: The in-house nickname for the VCS/2600, \"Stella\", was not derived from a female employee like most Atari hardware projects were, but rather designer Joe Decuir's French Stella bicycle. The nickname wasn't for the system itself but rather the custom graphics chip, TIA.\n\nQ: When was the VCS/2600 first released and what did it sell for?\n\nA: The earliest evidence found thus far are these ads from August 1st, 1977. The first is from Longs drug stores that appeared in The Times newspaper from San Mateo, CA. The VCS was listed for $170 ($169.88) with carts for $18 ($17.88). The second is from the San Diego Union newspaper.\n\nOther ads found in newspapers throughout the country show prices ranging anywhere from $150 to $180, with a retail list price of $190. One ad from a Canadian paper listed it for $238.\n\nAlthough many sites now claim September 11th, 1977 as the \"official release date\", there's simply no documentation to prove it. From Michael Current:\n\nI came to the conclusion that one or more people probably took the Macy's ad of 9/11/77 as indicating the \"official release date\". So that's my theory of where the date came from. Older versions of my timeline may have been guilty of going along with that idea, but no longer. As with most product releases back then, I think there was no set release date, more a matter of product shipping out over a period of time, so it became available around the country over a range of dates as resellers received stock to sell. Ship dates can be more tangible, especially if the product is manufactured and shipped from one place.\n\nIn this case, I have Atari indicating at the CES in June that they expected the VCS to be available in July. Based on the reports in Television Digest (LINK) along with the August newspaper ads, I think Atari probably at least shipped it by late July, so that it began to be available by early August, give or take a few days.\n\nOne long-believed story/rumor is that the VCS was ready for release a year earlier, but was held back due to Atari's agreement with Magnavox over Pong. Magnavox had sued Atari for patent infringement, and Atari ended up getting a paid-up license (the first company to do so) to pay Magnavox a royalty on every Pong system that Atari sold (via a paid-up license). That deal was to expire right before the 1977 CES in Chicago, so Atari just kept the already-in-development 2600 under wraps until the show so they wouldn't have to pay Magnavox any royalties for it (which they would have had to do if they shipped it earlier).\n\nThe more common belief is that the VCS's release was held up due to lack of funding, which is partly why Bushnell sold Atari to Warner in 1976.\n\nQ: What Usenet groups actively discuss the VCS/2600?\n\nA: There are several groups, although there is very little activity on them these days:\n\nrec.games.video.atari (RGVA)\n\nrec.games.video.classic (RGVC)\n\nrec.games.video.marketplace (RGVM)\n\nMost ISPs no longer support access to them, but Google Groups is one web-based option.\n\nQ: What website forums actively discuss the VCS/2600?\n\nA:\n\nAtari.IO\n\nAtariage\n\nAtarimania\n\nClassic Consoles Center (no longer active)\n\nDigital Press\n\nFacebook - Atari 2600 group\n\nLost Levels\n\nNeoGAF\n\nRetro Collect\n\nRetro Gamer\n\nRetro Video Gamer\n\nThe Old Computer\n\nQ: Where can I find games for my VCS/2600 or the console itself?\n\nA: Besides Ebay, there are still several sources online for both new and used game cartridges, such as:\n\nAtari Compendium\n\nAtari2600.com - hasn't been updated in years, since owner Joe Cody opened an Ebay store\n\nAtariage\n\n4Jays\n\nAtariage\n\nB & C Computervisions\n\nBest Electronics\n\nBlue Rose Video Games\n\nClassic Game Source\n\nCraigslist\n\nCollector's Cards & Games\n\nConsole Passion Retro Games\n\nDavid's Classic Video Games\n\nFacebook Marketplace\n\nFacebook - Atari 2600 group\n\nThe Goat Store\n\nGood Deal Games\n\nGoodwill\n\nJack Berg Sales\n\nMercado Libre\n\nMercari\n\nPackrat Video Games\n\nRetro Action\n\nRetroGames\n\nTrade-N-Games\n\nVideo Game Trader\n\nVideo61\n\nOther sources for both new and used games, and consoles include:\n\narcades\n\nflea markets\n\ngame shows and events\n\ngame-related museums\n\nindependent video game stores\n\nmessage boards\n\nnewsgroups\n\nnewspaper classified ads\n\npawn stores\n\nthrift stores\n\nweb pages of many collectors\n\nyard sales\n\nQ: Where can I find cartridge lists?\n\nA:Atariage, Atarimania, and Digital Press all have searchable lists online. Of them, Atarimania's is the only one that's frequently updated.\n\nQ: Which magazines covered the VCS/2600 in the 1980s?\n\nA:\n\nAtari Age\n\nAtarian\n\nBig K\n\nBlip\n\nComputer & Video Games\n\nCreative Computing\n\nCreative Computing Video & Arcade Games\n\nElectronic Fun w/ Computers and Games / Computer Fun\n\nElectronic Games / Computer Entertainment\n\nElectronics For Kids JoyStik\n\nK Power\n\nL'Atarien\n\nLeisure Time Electronics\n\nMicrokids\n\nPlayboy Guide Electronic Entertainment\n\nSoftware Merchandising\n\nTilt\n\nToy & Hobby World\n\nTV Gamer (UK) (not to be confused with the non-classic, currently publishing Japanese magazine)\n\nVideo\n\nVideo Games\n\nVideo Games Player / Computer Games\n\nVideogaming Illustrated / Videogaming and Computer Gaming Illustrated / Video and Computer Gaming Illustrateda\n\nVidiot\n\nScott Stilphen made complete scans of most these and more, which can be found here in the archives section.\n\nQ: Which recent magazines cover the VCS/2600?\n\nA:\n\nAtari Bit Byter User Club (ABBUC)\n\nClassic Console Magazine\n\nClassic Gamer Magazine\n\nRetro Gamer\n\nRetro Gaming Mag\n\nRetro Videogame Magazine\n\nRevival Gamers\n\nThe Unauthorized Atari 2600 Throw Back Zine\n\nQ: Which newsletters covered the VCS/2600?\n\nA:\n\n2600 Connection\n\nActivisions\n\nAtari Inside\n\nAtari News\n\nAtari Owners Club Bulletin / VCS Owners Club Bulletin\n\nCGL (Activision) Fun Club News / Activision Software Club\n\nClassic Systems & Games Monthly\n\nDigital Press\n\nElectronic Games Hotline\n\nI Love Atari News\n\nImagic Numb Thumb News\n\nLeisure Time Electronics Reports\n\nThe Logical Gamer\n\nThe Parker Video Games Club\n\nThe Retrogaming Times\n\nScott Stilphen made scans of some of these, which can be found in the archives section.\n\nQ: Which books covered the VCS/2600?\n\nA: The most comprehensive list is maintained in the archives section of the Atari Compendium website, which includes scans I made of some of them.

Produced by Howard Scott Warshaw, the series is a first hand look at Atari from the people who worked there.\n\nStella at 20: An Atari 2600 Retrospective is a series of documentaries from CyberPuNKs (Russ Perry Jr., Glenn Saunders, Jim Nitchals and Dan Skelton) on VHS. Both \"Volume 1, Tales of Stella\" and Atari\" and \"Volume 2, The Game Designers or One Person, One Game\" are around 90 minutes in length and originally sold for $25 each or $40 for both (+ shipping). The videos were never released on DVD, but the raw footage from the gathering was finally released.\n\nTwo videos - one documenting the 1998 World of Atari show and one documenting the 1999 Classic Gaming Expo - are available from Mark Santora for $25 + $4 shipping each or $50 (shipping included) for both tapes. Contact him directly to order or to inquire about international orders or PAL format tapes.\n\nA 4-DVD box set, CGE 2K7, documenting the 2007 Classic Gaming Expo show, is available from Scott Stilphen for $25 each.\n\nQ: Where can I view Atari TV commercials?\n\nA:\n\nAtarimania\n\nScottithGames\n\nQ: Where can I view Atari print advertisements?\n\nA:\n\nAtari Compendium\n\nAtarimania\n\nDigital Press\n\nQ: What is IRC and how do I use it?\n\nA: IRC is Internet Relay Chat, a global real-time chat network. You can download an IRC client from www.mirc.com, and you will also find some general information and instructions there.\n\nQ: What does the Atari symbol represent?\n\nA: The Atari symbol was designed by George Opperman in 1972. Pong was very popular then, and the symbol was a stylized version of a capital 'A', with the two opposing video game players representing the sides, and the center of the Pong court in the middle.\n\nQ: What does the word \"atari\" mean?\n\nA: The word atari comes from the game of Go, perhaps the world oldest board game. Nolan Bushnell described it as a polite way of saying you're about to be engulfed. Some sets of rules (such as the Japanese and World Amateur Go Championship) define it as, \"A group of stones is in atari if it has only one liberty left.\" For more information about the game, check out the American Go Association.\n\nQ: Where can I find Atari-like fonts?\n\nA: The most common Atari VCS/2600 font type is Bimini. True Type Fonts (TTF) for it can easily be found online for free (LINK).\n\nQ: Which shows, events, or gatherings cover the VCS/2600?\n\nA: There are several in both the U.S. and in Europe:\n\nU.S.\n\nClassic Console and Arcade Gaming (CCAG) Show - Ohio.\n\nClassic Game Fest - Austin, TX\n\nColumbus Ohio Retro Gaming Society (CORGS) - Columbus, OH\n\nLI Retro Gaming Expo - Garden City, NY\n\nLouisville Arcade Expo - Louisville, KY\n\nNorthwest Classic Games Enthusiasts (NWCGE) - Portland, OR\n\nMidwest Gaming Classic (MGC) - Wisconsin\n\nPortland Retro Gaming Expo (PRG) - Portland, Oregon\n\nSeattle Retro Gaming Expo (SRGE) - Seattle, WA\n\nSouthern-Fried Gameroom Expo - Atlanta, GA\n\nTooManyGames - Philadelphia, PA\n\nVideo Game Summit - Lombard, IL\n\nEurope\n\nGamescon - Cologne, Germany\n\nRetroCollect Video Game Market - UK\n\nQ: What's the story about Atari being sued for not having a chess game?\n\nA: There were 2 different boxes for the original VCS model in 1977. 6 artwork photos were changed between them:\n\nThe reason for why the artwork was changed is related to a story about someone in Florida who sued Atari for having a picture of a chess piece on the box when Atari didn't offer a chess cartridge:\n\nThe story has its roots in an article that appeared in the March 1983 issue of IEEE spectrum that featured quotes from then-VP of the VCS Development group Larry Kaplan and head of Engineering Allan Alcorn:\n\n\"When the VCS was first manufactured,\" Mr. Kaplan recalled, \"the box had a chess piece on it. 'Those marketing guys! Come on,' we said. 'It'll never do chess.' Well, some guy in Florida sued because there was a chess piece on the cover and we didn't have a chess game.\"\n\nA year later Atari's designers began developing Chess. \"The guys were playing around,\" Allan Alcorn, then head of engineering at Atari, recalled, \"and one guy said, 'I could write an algorithm, but I couldn't get a playfield on the screen.' Another guy said, 'That's easy.'\" Larry Wagner wrote the algorithm; it took him two years with the help of national chess champion Julio Kaplan. Mr. Whitehead did the display in two days, developing the trick now known as Venetian blinds.\n\nThe lead designer of Atari Video Chess, Larry Wagner, once mentioned the cartridge was developed as a result of this lawsuit, but later recounted his statement and said its development started as an interesting R&D project, and referred to the same IEEE spectrum article:\n\nTo set the record straight, the chess algorithm started on a microprocessor system with 128 bytes of RAM. The best source is the IEEE spectrum article in the 80's. It was not because someone threatened Atari with a lawsuit; the chess cartridge was developed because we wanted to have an interesting R&D project.\n\nBob Whitehead, the person responsible for developing the display, had this to say:\n\nOne of the corporate reasons for doing chess I heard repeated to me several times was that we needed to do 'a chess game' because it was in some of the original VCS/2600 artwork, I think even the box itself. So, 'Ataris committed to doing it.'\n\nThe fact that artwork for games that Atari didn't have at the time (chess, tic-tac-toe, casino games) were quickly removed from the box, which gives credence to the lawsuit story. Atari probably felt the less people that knew about the lawsuit the better, and simply didn't tell the programmers the complete story as to why they needed a chess cartridge. By the time the IEEE spectrum article came out in 1983, it hardly mattered.\n\nQ: What are those black lines I see along the left side of the screen in some games?\n\nA: The black lines are the result of using a programming trick developed by Larry Kaplan that uses what's called an HMOVE command. If an HMOVE is initiated immediately after HBlank starts (which is the case when HMOVE is used as documented), the [HMOVE] signal is latched and used to delay the end of the HBlank by exactly 8 CLK, or two counts of the HSync Counter. This is achieved in the TIA by resetting the HB (HBlank) latch on the [LRHB] (Late Reset H-Blank) counter decode rather than the normal [RHB] (Reset H-Blank) decode. The extra HBlank time shifts everything except the Playfield right by 8 pixels, because the position counters will now resume counting 8 CLK later than they would have without the HMOVE. This is also the source of the HMOVE 'comb' effect; the extended HBlank hides the normal playfield output for the first 8 pixels of the line:\n\nHere's an excerpt from an article that appeared in the March 1983 issue of IEEE spectrum, explaining what led to its development:\n\nOne critical MOS-dependent feature was the use of a special counter - called a polynomial counter, or pseudorandom shift register - instead of a true binary counter to determine object positions on the screen. A polynomial counter occupies one-fourth the silicon area of an equivalent binary counter, but, unlike a binary counter, it does not count in any simple order. Thus, a programmer cannot calculate a screen position for an object and load it into the position counter.\n\nThe original Stella prototype had only one signal to the position counter: a reset that would trigger the immediate display of an object. Mr. Decuir and Jay Miner, who designed the production version of the Stella chip, used this same concept in their design. As a result, displaying an object in a given position on the screen requires that the programmer count the number of clock cycles taken by a given set of instruction, figure out how far across the screen the electron beam would be after the instructions had been executed, and act accordingly. Once the position counter for an object is reset at the proper point, it continues to display the object at that spot on succeeding lines.\n\nTo move objects, the prototype blocked out four clock pulses from the position counters during the vertical blanking interval; a programmer could then add pulses to move an object left or right - four pulses had to be added to keep the object in the same place. Mr. Miner added a set of motion registers, which add or subtract pulses automatically when a signal - called H-move - is sent by the microprocessor. The H-move can be sent during the vertical blanking interval, or during the horizontal blanking interval at the beginning of each line.\n\n\"This seemed innocuous enough,\" said Larry Kaplan, the first software designer hired to develop games for the Stella project. \"But I discovered early that it was possible to reposition player objects during a screen [a frame of the TV picture], though that was not a consideration of the design.\"\n\nSo Mr. Kaplan designed Air-Sea Battle, which has horizontal bands of player objects, a technique used in countless VCS games, including Space Invaders, Freeway, Asteroids, and Football. \"Without that single strobe, H-move, the VCS would have died a quick death five years ago,\" said Mr. Kaplan, now vice president of product development at Atari.\n\nActivision got around this by using the trick on every scanline, which effectively blacked out the screen area where the lines appear (with Boxing being the first).\n\nEric Del Sesto of M Network devised a method that he called \"hidden V-clocks\" to remove the lines. From Sesto:\n\nThe Atari 2600 had no video memory. Instead, the CPU had to write each line of sprite data out to a set of hardware registers, in close synchronization with the video display's horizontal retrace timing. One unfortunate side-effect of this was that the hardware would display what looked like a random set of short, black, horizontal lines near the left edge of the display. The M Network group had an accepted workaround for this, which would cause those lines to appear on every scanline, thereby forming a solid black border at the left edge of the display. My Monkey Business prototype demonstrated a method to eliminate those lines completely. The trick was to write to certain registers in exact synchronization with the horizontal retrace timing.\n\nQ: Why do some of the early games automatically end after a certain amount of time?\n\nA: After checking manuals for most of the early VCS titles, 5 were found to have a 2:16 minute time limit:\n\nAir-Sea Battle\n\nCombat\n\nFreeway\n\nStar Ship\n\nStreet Racer\n\nThese games end using different time limits or rely on scoring limits:\n\nBasketball - 2 4-min halves\n\nBoxing - 2 minutes\n\nCanyon Bomber - game ends when either player uses all 6 bombs or reaches 1,000 points\n\nIce Hockey - 3 minutes\n\nIndy 500 - 60 seconds in some variations, other end when one player makes 25 laps, or scores 50 points or 99 points\n\nBasic Math/Fun with Numbers - 12 or 24 second time limits\n\nNight Driver - 90 seconds\n\nOutlaw - 1-player game 99 seconds to score 10 points\n\nPitfall - 20 minutes\n\nSpace War - games last 10 minutes or until a player scores 10 points\n\nSurround - first player to score 10 points\n\nVideo Olympics - first player or team to score 21 points\n\nScott Stilphen asked 3 of Atari's early VCS/2600 game designers on how 2:16 came to be used. Here's their replies.\n\nJoe Decuir:\n\nThis is a question whose answer dates from 1976 or 1977.\n\nThere would be two parts:\n\n- why have one?\n\n- why this number?\n\nHaving a time limit at all applies to some games but not others. E.g. Video Olympics will end on score. Some games end when the player uses up too many resources, or achieves some goal. Some games (like Combat) could go on indefinitely, or until a certain amount of damage was taken.\n\nI suspect that this was common in some Arcade games.\n\n2:16 = 136 seconds = 8160 display frames ~ 8192 display frames. That is 2^13. Some arcade game probably used a binary 13 bit counter, and the practice followed.\n\nLarry Kaplan:\n\nHere's the comments from Combat's source code that describes it:\n\n; GameTimer is incremented and SelDbnce reset when\n\n; CLOCK & $3F = 0. This occurs 1 frame out of 64 or\n\n; about once/second. Thus the game is 128*64 frames\n\n; or about 2 minutes long.\n\n;\n\n128*64 = 8192 frames / 60 fps = 136.5 seconds = 2 min 16 seconds\n\nYes, we always minimized code and cut corners so it was easier to do 64 frames than 60. 4 min 32 seemed too long, so we started timer at 128 and inc'ed until 0.\n\nBob Whitehead:\n\n8196 frames or (8196/60) 2 to the power of 13 divided by 60 is equal to approximately 136.5 seconds. It was an easy equivalent to 2 minutes using a simple base 2 digital counter. It means if the programmer needs 2 minutes, it's cheaper in code to just use a 13 bit counter. You will see this approximation to minutes throughout all the games (i.e., 68 seconds instead of 60). Programmers were disparate for program bytes and saving a dozen program bytes was critical sometimes.\n\nTwo things to note:\n\n1.) Atari 2600 frames are not exactly 1/60 of a second (it has to do with not using interlacing half lines and the system's digital clock speed).\n\n2.) More importantly, 2 minutes are kind of a standard player attention span per level that was understood from the coin op days and propagated by the 2600's \"casual\" short attention span style games. \"2 minutes\" has its roots in the coin op arena.\n\nQ: Why do some some games exhibit color-cycling if left on too long, and others don't?\n\nA: The color-cycling is an early example of what's now called a screensaver. Systems prior to the VCS/2600 had a nasty habit of burning-in people's B&W TVs with game graphics such as scores and boundary lines. The VCS/2600 offered protection from burn-in damage by slowly cycling through all the 128 possible colors. Contrary to popular belief (due to how Atari marketed this feature), the color-cycling is not built into the hardware; it's a code routine that was written by Joe Decuir. All the system manuals up to 1984 (except the 1982 manuals for some reason) include the following statement:\n\n\"Your Atari 2600 Video Computer System game is engineered not to show a phosphor memory of the playfield or score digits.\"\n\nThe Sears Tele-Games manuals have a slight variation to this:\n\n\"Your Sears Cartridge Tele-Games System Video Arcade is engineered to help eliminate phosphor memory of the playfield and score digits.\"\n\nMost of Atari's VCS games in the first few years immediately go into color-cycling when powered up. Basic Math was the first to have delayed color-cycling (after the game has been idle for a few minutes). Some early games (Blackjack, Casino, Basic Programming, Adventure, Maze Craze, and Stellar Track) don't color-cycle at all, which is surprising considering including the code for it should have been a requirement.\n\nQ: What scores were needed to earn an Activision patch?\n\nA: The memorabilia section lists all the patches that were available, as well as the scores needed to earn them and the letters included with them.\n\nQ: What was the SwordQuest contest? What happened with the prizes?\n\nA: The SwordQuest Challenge was conceived by Tod R. Frye, and originally was called the Adventure Series. It encompasses 4 separate games: EarthWorld, FireWorld, WaterWorld, and AirWorld. Each game was to have its own contest, and the prizes were each valued at $25,000 (although the first 2 were worth a bit less at the time they were awarded).\n\nThe series was to culminate in 1984 with the winner from each of the 4 contests facing off for the grand prize: the $50,000 SwordQuest Sword. From Howard Scott Warshaw:\n\nWe were driving back from a brainstorming session in Monterey. Warner had just bought D.C. Comics and we were going back-and-forth talking about getting a comic book series tie-in with D.C. Tod Frye did all the designs, with the four elements and how to tie everything together, which added up to about $200k worth of code! It was a cool concept, but early on though I felt that it wouldnt come together the way we imagined.\n\nEach game represented one of the 4 Symbols of Astrology:\n\nEarth (directed will - energy radiating out from the center; action)\n\nFire (physical - force that holds the atoms together; practical applications; consolidation)\n\nWater (intellect; the energy that shapes the pattern of things to come; communication)\n\nAir (soul, emotions; power of the unconscious mind; connecting to the source; reception)\n\nThe games and contest were promoted heavily by Atari's own Atari Age. The first 2 games, EarthWorld and FireWorld, were released, and the contests were held and the prizes awarded. The 3rd game, WaterWorld, ultimately fell victim to the infamous industry \"crash\"; it only saw a limited release, as it was initially only available through the Atari Age (copies eventually reached store shelves at the height of the crash, and priced at only a few dollars), and the contest was delayed and eventually cancelled. The programming for the 4th game, AirWorld, was started but never completed.\n\nAs for the remaining 3 prizes, it has long been rumored that the SwordQuest Sword (and possibly the prizes for WaterWorld and AirWorld) ended up in the hands of Jack Tramiel. The person who first posted this story personally saw the sword hanging over the mantle of Tramiel's fireplace, and noted it had an Atari fuji symbol on it, although the only artwork to depict that was the EarthWorld pamphlet. All the other artwork is identical to the only known photograph of the sword (from the FireWorld contest). It's possible the Atari symbol is only on one side of the handle. There are also those who (recently) claim to have spoken with either Jack Tramiel or his son, Leonard, with both claiming Jack did not have it. While Jack may not have had it by that point, neither Jack or Leonard confirmed or denied that he ever had it, and any claims that Warner kept the prizes during the transfer of ownership of Atari to Tramiel are completely unsubstantiated rumors. The current belief is the sword still remains with the Tramiel family. Hopefully one day the truth will come out, and with it, full disclosure of what happened to the remaining 3 prizes.\n\nI wrote an in-depth article about the contest, called SwordQuest Revisited.\n\nQ: Are there still VCS/2600-related contests being held?\n\nA: Yes. The following sites maintain active contests and high score challenges:\n\nAtari Compendium\n\nAtariage\n\nHigh Score\n\nLvl Up Score\n\nTwin Galaxies\n\nQ: What's the myth about Atari's E.T. game?\n\nA:\n\nThere are several. One is Atari made more copies of E.T. than there were systems in circulation. Another is that the game was so bad (often incorrectly cited as the \"worst Atari VCS game of all time\") and sold so poorly that its failure led to the infamous market crash of 1983-84 and to Atari's demise. Yet another is that so many people returned the game to where they bought it that Atari was stuck with millions of carts and ultimately dumped them in a landfill. In actuality, none of these are true.\n\nTo start with, most stores didn't accept returns at that point, unless the game was defective. Prior to that, companies were criticized for not having screenshots on boxes, or of using deceptive screenshots (either showing every element of a game at once, or a screenshot from a different system). Haunted House, released in February 1982, was the first game Atari released that included a screenshot on the box.\n\nIn the fall of 1983, Atari decided to clear their excess stock of unsold games from their warehouse in El Paso, TX. Knowing they couldn't dump the product onto the market like smaller 3rd-party companies were doing (such as Data Age selling their games to Kandy Man Sales, who resold them to distributors for a fraction of their original worth), they instead labeled them as being faulty and chose to dump them in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico, in a hasty effort to write-off the inventory. Games were trucked there in late September 1983 from Atari's El Paso, TX facility 90 miles away. Different accounts of the story have anywhere from 8 to 24 truckloads of items being dumped:\n\nSeptember 25: The Alamogordo Daily News (New Mexico) reported that Atari was in the process of disposing of a sizable amount of inventory at the local landfill, and that \"eight 18-wheeler truckloads (of games) have been crushed and buried in the pit since operations began.\"\n\nSeptember 27: The Alamogordo Daily News (New Mexico) reported on the local landfill and \"the dumping of 11 semi-trailer truckloads of Atari computers, cartridges, and assorted parts from an El Paso warehouse in the dump since last Thursday.\" Atari spokesman Bruce Entin said Atari was sending scrap merchandise to the Alamogordo dump, and said, \"I won't tell you there may not be some of that stuff that's good in the items sent to Alamogordo, but most is not. The majority of the stuff is cartridges.\"\n\nSeptember 28: The New York Times article reports \"With the video game business gone sour, some manufacturers have been dumping their excess game cartridges on the market at depressed prices. Now Atari Inc., the leading video game manufacturer, has taken dumping one step farther. The company has dumped 14 truckloads of discarded game cartridges and other computer equipment at the city landfill in Alamogordo, N.M. Guards kept reporters and spectators away from the area yesterday as workers poured concrete over the dumped merchandise. An Atari spokesman said the equipment came from Atari's plant in El Paso, Tex., which used to make videogame cartridges but has now been converted to recycling scrap. Atari lost $310.5 million in the second quarter, largely because of a sharp drop in video game sales.\"\n\nInfoWorld August 6th, 1984 article (pg. 52) reported \"Twenty truckloads of games, VCSs, and home computers are found in a dump. Atari says they are defective, but critics say Atari is tossing inventory it can't sell.\"\n\nThe local media picked up on the story when people started sneaking into the landfill at night and scavenging games. Atari sent a security guard there and paid to have the games covered in concrete to prevent any further theft, which only brought more attention, because why would Atari bother to do that if the games were as faulty as they claimed? Well, the games weren't, and it wasn't long before the national media picked up on what was happening there, and with Atari in general. Over the years, the story of what happened was twisted to the point where the only game that was dumped there was E.T., and there were millions of copies of the game. This was coupled with the misconception that the failure of E.T. was such that it was the main reason for the market crashing and Atari's eventual demise. The fact is, there are FAR worse games for the VCS than E.T., and even with all the negative attention it received, it still ended up being the 8th best-selling VCS game Atari made (plus Atari actually re-released it in 1986).\n\nOn April 26th, 2014, a 5-man team of archaeologists who call themselves the \"Punk Archaeologists\" were partially funded by MicroSoft and Fuel Entertainment to excavate the site at the Alamogordo, NM landfill to prove or disprove games were actually dumped there. A documentary team headed by director Zak Penn filmed the excavation and everything that was found, with the purpose of releasing a documentary film exclusive for XBOX 360 and XBOX ONE owners. As expected, boxed copies of at least 33 different games were found, along with some common controllers:\n\nAdventure\n\nAir-Sea Battle\n\nAsteroids\n\nBerzerk\n\nBreakout\n\nCentipede\n\nCircus Atari\n\nCombat\n\nDefender\n\nDefender (5200)\n\nDodge 'Em\n\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nHaunted House\n\nHuman Cannonball\n\nMaze Craze: A Game of Cops n Robbers\n\nMissile Command\n\nMs. Pac-Man\n\nNight Driver\n\nPac-Man\n\nPele's Soccer\n\nPhoenix\n\nQix (5200)\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nRealSports Football\n\nRobotron (5200)\n\nSpace Invaders\n\nStar Raiders\n\nSuper Breakout\n\nSuperman\n\nSwordQuest: FireWorld\n\nVanguard\n\nWarlords\n\nYars' Revenge\n\nThe Punk Archaeologists released an article on The Atlantic website on August 7th, 2014 with details about the excavation, although their claim of there not being a concrete cap over the buried items is incorrect. Credit the documentary team for tracking down James Heller, the former Atari manager who arranged for the games to be dumped there, who confirmed there were a total of 12 truckloads (totaling approximately 750,000 cartridges) and that 6 concrete trucks were used. An April 26th, 2014 Yahoo article includes comments Mr. Heller, who gave a more accurate number for how many games were dumped there:\n\nThe game's finding came as no surprise to James Heller, a former Atari manager who was invited by the production to the dig site. He says in 1983 the company tasked him with finding an inexpensive way to dispose of 728,000 cartridges they had in a warehouse in El Paso, Texas. After a few local kids ran into trouble for scavenging and the media started calling him about it, he decided to pour a layer of concrete over the games.\n\n\"I never heard about again it until June 2013, when I read an article about E.T. being excavated,\" he remembers. He was not aware of the controversy and never spoke out \"because nobody asked.\"\n\nThe article also recounts stories from one of the people who scavenged games from the landfill back in 1983:\n\nAmong the watchers was Armando Ortega, a city official who as a teenager back in 1983 got a tip from a landfill employee about the massive dump of games.\n\n\"It was pitch dark here that night, but we came with our flashlights and found dozens of games,\" he said. They braved the darkness, coyotes and snakes of the desert landfill and had to sneak past the security guard. But it paid off as they found dozens of crushed but still playable cartridges.\n\nQ: What's the infamous video game market \"crash\" that happened?\n\nA:\n\nOften referred to as the \"big shake-out\" by publications at the time (such as this article from Electronic Games), the market crash is often falsely attributed to Ataris VCS E.T. game, so its impossible to talk about one without talking about the other. As previously explained, E.T. was hardly the sole factor for the crash; the reality is the seeds for it, as well as Ataris own demise, had been sown years before.\n\nAfter 4 years of managing Atari and struggling to grow the company and expand into the home consumer market, Nolan Bushnell decided to sell the company. On July 26th, 1976, Warner Communications, Inc. (WCI) created a new division within the company, WCI Games Inc.; by October 1st, 1976, Warner formally owned all of Atari for $28 million (some accounts put the figure as high as $32 million, with Bushnell getting $15 million). Warner was founded by Steve Ross the same year as Atari, 1972. With the sale to Warner, Bushnell - now Chairman and CEO - at last had the financial resources to successfully launch a product like the VCS. One term of the sale was that Bushnell had to sign a 7-year non-compete agreement in the event he left Atari (that expired October 1st, 1983). But with Warner, Bushnell also found an enemy with Warner Executive VP Manny Gerard. Gerard had a major issue with the amount of money Atari spent on R&D, and what little marketing they did for the products they sold. As Ray Kassar rose up through the ranks, both he and Gerard began to cut Atari's R&D while aggressively expanding Atari's marketing. Bushnell and Atari co-founder Joseph Keenan found themselves constantly fighting with Gerard and Kassar over the future of Atari, and slowly being marginalized and pushed out of the company. Before resigning from the company he helped start, Bushnell had an infamously contentious board meeting with Atari's new executives concerning the direction the company was headed, and in particular the fate of the VCS, which devolved into a shouting match with Gerard. The system wasn't selling as well as everyone had hoped, and Bushnell wanted to discontinue the system and focus on the development of the next generation console (what ultimately became the 400/800 computers). Gerard strongly felt it was too soon to dump the VCS and instead wanted to invest more in promoting it. Gerard's position at Warner gave him the upper hand in determining not only the VCS's future, but Bushnell's as well.\n\nOn December 28th, 1978, Gerard and Warner's board formally ousted Bushnell as Atari's Chairman and co-CEO, and demoted him to 'creative consultant', which Bushnell balked at. Upon his exit, Bushnell bought the rights to his Chuck E Cheese Pizza Time Theater concept and sole test location for $500,000. Joe Keenan took over as Chairman; he was previously the President and co-CEO. Raymond Kassar, an ex-marketing VP from Burlington textiles, became Atari's President and CEO. The Atari board of directors now consisted of Gerard, Keenan, and Jac Holzman (senior consultant to the Office of the President of Warner).\n\nGerard brought in Kassar in February of 1978 as a senior marketing and management consultant, to assess the current status of Atari and report directly to Gerard, as he wanted help with establishing the VCS and give Atari a corporate structure. Kassar was an ex-marketing VP from Burlington textiles, which was about as far away from the technology business as you can get. After Keenan left in September 1979 (to join Bushnell at Pizza Time Theatre), Kassar became Atari's Chairman and CEO. In Bushnell's absence, Kassar's complete lack of experience with technology soon proved he was the wrong person to lead Atari, and his lack of compassion and understanding for what the companys engineers actually did there began to trickle down through the companys ever-increasing layers of management. One of Kassar's first decisions as Atari's new CEO was to cancel all the contracts Bushnell had established with all the different chip manufacturers; the idea behind the contracts was to establish a 'monopoly' for the VCS, thereby shutting out any potential rivals from releasing a competing system. Not recognizing the brilliance behind Bushnell's idea, Kassar instead saw it as a waste of money and terminated the contracts, thereby handing this bonanza of next-gen processors over to Atari's competitors. From Nolan Bushnell:\n\n\"When I sold the company to Warner and after I left, Ray Kassar looked at it and said, 'Bushnell is a real idiot, why does he have five different chip manufacturing projects going along?' He cancelled all but the best ones. One went to TI, one went to Bally, and one went to Mattel. All of a sudden, with the stroke of a pen, he generated three major competitors.\"\n\nEven though the VCS was less than a year old by the time Bushnell left Atari, it was clear this was a product that had the potential to be very successful in the near-future - especially to those programming games for it, who soon realized their efforts were largely responsible for its initial success. Some time in 1979, four of the original VCS programmers - David Crane, Bob Whitehead, Alan Miller, and Larry Kaplan (dubbed the Fantastic Four)  became keenly aware of their efforts (thanks to a memo circulated by Marketing), and approached Kassar with a contract proposal that would provide programmers with designer credit on the packaging and royalties for their games. Being Atari was owned by Warner, an entertainment company, they felt they should be treated accordingly, as any other creative artist (musicians, actors, comic artists, etc). Kassar dismissed them, replying, I've dealt with your kind before. Youre nothing than a bunch of towel designers. You're a dime a dozen. You're not unique. Anybody can do a cartridge. From David Crane:\n\nIn spite of Warners management, Atari was still doing very well financially, and middle management made promises of profit sharing and other bonuses. Creative people dont like to be lied to, and there was a revolt with many people leaving and others threatening to go. Job satisfaction in the whole engineering department was at an all-time low. At the same time, a memo was circulated from the marketing department showing the prior years cartridge sales, broken down by game as a percentage of sales. The intent of the memo was to alert the game development staff to what types of games were selling well. This memo backfired however, as it demonstrated the value of the game designer individually. Video game design in those days was a one-man process with one person doing the creative design, the storyboards, the graphics, the music, the sound effects, every line of programming, and final play testing. So when I saw a memo that the games for which I was 100 percent responsible had generated over $20 million in revenues, I was one of the people wondering why I was working in complete anonymity for a $20,000 salary. When we looked closely at that memo, we saw that as a group we were responsible for 60 percent of their $100 million in cartridge sales for a single year. With concrete evidence that our contribution to the company was of great value, we went to the president of Atari to ask for a little recognition and fair compensation. Ray Kassar looked us in the eye and said, You are no more important to Atari than the person on the assembly line who puts the cartridges in the box.. After that, it was a pretty easy decision to leave.\n\nAn interview Kassar did with the San Jose Mercury News in 1979 that quoted him referring to Atari's programmers as, \"A bunch of high-strong prima donnas\" (article) only resulted in generating more animosity towards him, and some programmers responded by referring to him as the \"towel czar\" and wearing T-shirts proclaiming \"JUST ANOTHER HIGH-STRUNG PRIMA DONNA from ATARI\". Years later in a 2011 interview, Kassar would half-heartedly admit that his comment was \"probably a mistake\" but claim that it was a comment made off-the-record and that, \"I really did all I could to encourage the programmers\".\n\n(Photo from IEEE spectrum, December 1982 issue, pg. 28)\n\nBy September of that same year, the \"Fantastic Four\" left Atari and set out to prove Kassar was wrong. With the memo in hand, they sought out venture capital to start Activision, and it didnt take long for word to get around on just how much money Atari was making. Activision became the worlds 1st 3rd-party software company in 1979, and the following year started releasing VCS games. Ataris response was to sue Activision for trademark violations and theft of trade secrets (InfoWorld 8-4-80 article). An article in the June 1982 issue of Electronic Games (pg. 9) states both parties agreed to an out-of-court settlement involving a long-term licensing arrangement (reportedly to be a fixed royalty payment).\n\nThe lawsuit lasted nearly 2 years, during which 2 more 3rd-party companies entered the market  Games By Apollo and Imagic. During this time, Fairchild engineer Jerry Lawson had reversed-engineered Atari's VCS, wrote a programming manual for it, and started selling copies to anyone interested (he was involved with the lawsuit at one point, to show how it was possible for Activision to write software for the VCS without resorting to stealing trade secrets). Apparently confident it would win its lawsuit with Activision, Kassar continued to treat employees with indifference (InfoWorld November 28th, 1983). When Rob Fulop finished his excellent coin-op port of Missile Command for the VCS in late December 1980, Kassar rewarded him with a certificate for a free turkey and a letter thanking him for the contribution he made to the Atari team. From Rob Fulop:\n\n\"I sat there, dumbfounded. I couldn't believe that I got a turkey for doing Missile Command. I didn't know a lot about business at the time. I was 23 years old. But I remember thinking, how stupid... I'm going to leave because of this, and all they had to do was give me $10k. If they gave me the keys to a car, I would have stayed and given them another 2 or 3 products.\"\n\n(Photo courtesy of Howard Scott Warshaw)\n\nVCS Missile Command was released the following June and was an immediate hit with sales of 2-3 million carts. The next month, Fulop, along with 4 other people - 2 senior VCS programmers (Dennis Koble and Bob Smith), Mark Bradley (national accounts manager), and Bill Grubb (VP of Marketing and Sales) - left to found Imagic. And yet, Kassar still refused to budge on his policies. After Bushnell was ousted and Kassar personally sought to have Space Invaders licensed, Atari's net worth skyrocketed, which no doubt reinforced his belief that his leadership was driving the company's success, when in reality he was simply in the right place at the right time. And although he re-invested heavily in the company's R&D (who created some truly innovative products like the Cosmos handheld), he had no interest in releasing anything they created; all he could see at that point was the runaway success of the VCS, and he was determined not to change course.\n\nBy the start of 1982, the Atari VCS was the king of the hill, having captured some 80% of the home video game market. The first magazine devoted to covering video games in the U.S., Electronic Games, started in late 1981; there would be a half-dozen new magazines a year later. Consumer demand was so high that people would buy just about anything, regardless of quality. The 1981 holiday season was such a huge success that many distributors ran short of product, having failed to order enough; Atari's response was to force them to preorder everything for the entire year of 1982. Distributors, not wanting to be caught short again, were forced to play Atari's game. In February 1982, Tod Frye went to his manager, George Kiss, and informed him that both he and Howard Scott Warshaw were approached by 20th Century Fox to start up a new game company. At that point, Kassar finally realized that with them gone, Atari would have very few senior VCS programmers left, and capitulated in giving the engineers both royalties and credit for their games. Convinced that porting arcade games to the VCS was the most-profitable course of action after the huge sales for Space Invaders, Asteroids, and Missile Command, Atari aggressively went after obtaining the licenses for some of the most-popular arcade games at the time, but the arcade license for the biggest game of all time, Pac-Man, had already been secured in a deal with Namco in 1978. Frye, given the choice of porting either Defender or Pac-Man to the VCS, chose the latter. Pac-Man was already very popular by the time Frye started programming his version, which would have been summer 1981, and Atari's Marketing department went into overdrive promoting the fact they had the exclusive home cartridge license for it. Atari wildly over-produced the game, making 12 million carts, at a time when the installed user base was approximately 7 million. They were hoping for another \"Space Invaders\" effect of a game driving system sales to pick up the surplus, and to some extent it worked; nearly 8 million cartridges were sold at an astounding $37-$45 each, making it the best-selling VCS cartridge ever, and Atari ended up selling some 5 million consoles that year. The most-anticipated cart release of 1982 also helped Frye earn a reported $1 million in sales royalties, since we can pretty much rule out \"word-of-mouth\" helping sales of what was soon considered to be not only a bad knock-off, but one of the worst arcade ports ever done. Many liberties were taken - Pac-Man only looked left or right, monsters became flickering ghosts, fruit condensed into a single \"multi-vitamin\", dots ballooned into large \"wafers\", energizers became power pills, etc. The garish sounds and colors only added to the nightmare. Only years later did the world learn Frye was given a mere 4K to program it (same with Bob Polaro and Defender), instead of the 8K previously used for Asteroids. By the time 8K was offered to him (as Rob Zdybel claims, although Frye claims he was never offered it), the game was nearly done, which would have meant starting over. However, Atari never fully recovered from their decision to release it (and in the quantities it did) and the scathing criticism that continues to follow it to this day. If the VCS ever had a \"jump the shark\" moment, this game was it, for the VCS looked hopelessly obsolete immediately upon the game's release, especially next to technologically-superior consoles like the Intellivision and Colecovision. From Tod Frye (Next Generation, April 1998, pg. 41 review):\n\n\"A while after Pac-Man was released, Ms. Pac-Man was developed with an 8K ROM by a three-man team in six months. The first Pac-Man was developed with a 4K ROM by just one man in five months. This 4K ROM was the big problem (Ed.: In subsequent comments, he said RAM was the big problem). My version also included a two-player mode and this drastically ate into what little ROM there was. After the release of the game, Atari set a new rule that every game needed to have an 8K ROM (Ed. Not true. RealSports Volleyball and Atari Video Cube were both 4K).\n\nWhy wasn't the project allocated better resources? At the time the project was started, 8K ROMs weren't available yet (Ed.: Not True. Asteroids was 8K and came out the previous summer and the bank-switching scheme was developed 2 years prior to that, for Video Chess). Also, when we started doing the port, Pac-Man wasn't a particularly big game. 'Pac-Man fever' hit between the start and the finish of the project (Ed.: Pac-Man was already very popular by the time Frye started programming his version, which would have been summer 1981. Both Coleco and Entex had their hand-held versions out later that year, and Magnavox released K.C. Munchkin for their Odyssey2 in November 1981).\n\nI have no particular technical regrets when it comes to Pac-Man. I made the best decisions based on the technology available at the time. But six months later, would I have done it differently? Sure (Ed.: I'm sure millions of people who bought the game would have done things differently as well).\"\n\nA video from the 2015 Portland Retro Gaming Expo shows Frye commenting on a new VCS version of Pac-Man and exclaiming he never understood why his version got so much criticism for the different maze layout, and for having the tunnel exits on the top and bottom, instead of on the sides like the arcade version. He also commented (in the Stella at 20 documentary) that he would have had a better flicker management routine had he had enough time to finish it (?), but he also claims he had a kernel working that used the same anti-flicker management system (using vertical separation and variable flicker) that Ms. Pac-Man used, but decided not to use it because nobody else had (?). In a keynote from the same show, Frye states he wish he had made a black background with a blue maze, but claims Atari had a rule against black backgrounds because it would have burned the maze into the CRT (apparently this rule didn't apply to space games...). This makes no sense since Atari touted the anti-burn-in effects of the VCS from day one, plus Frye included the color-cycling code routine in his Pac-Man game! I've also asked several VCS programmers - including Frye's Manager at the time, Dennis Koble - and nobody else recalls there ever being a rule or even a guideline regarding the use of black backgrounds. So Frye's unfounded claim appears to be nothing more than an excuse for his poor design choices.\n\nThe success of VCS Pac-Man only fueled the public's desire for more arcade titles. Atari subcontracted General Computer Corp (GCC) to contribute porting arcade games, and new chips were designed to allow for improved versions (the following year would see GCC's amazing port of Ms. Pac-Man). In late 1982, Kassar made a weak attempt to fend off the VCS's competitors with the 5200, but the console was nothing more than a repackaged Atari 400 computer (which was originally released in 1979) with quite possibly the worst controllers ever devised, plus it wasn't compatible with either the VCS or the 400.\n\nFor most people, VCS Pac-Man convinced them the system's limitations had been reached. Whereas Bushnell wanted to effectively kill the VCS too early in its life, Kassar hung onto it too long. Still, with an installed base of some 15 million consoles, companies continued to spring up, fully intent on supplying those owners with new software. With the Atari vs Activision lawsuit settled, the path was clear for anyone to sell software for the VCS, and by the end of 1982, some 2 dozen companies did just that, though most of it was inferior. Atari didn't help matters with inferior ports like Defender and Pac-Man, or ill-conceived concepts such as the 4-game SwordQuest contest. The battle to win licenses for the most-popular arcade titles raised the stakes for larger companies who could afford to play that game, like Mattel, Coleco, and Parker Brothers. Arcade companies recognized this, and would often insist on deals for 2 or more games. For example, Parker Brothers was only able to secure the rights to Nintendo's popular Popeye game if they agreed to buy the unsuccessful Sky Skipper as well. After 20th Century Fox licensed its hottest property, Star Wars to Parker Brothers, and their failed attempt to lure away Atari's remaining senior VCS programmers, they formed their own division, Fox Video Games, and subcontracted at least 4 companies (including Sirius Software) to write games for them - some based on their movies and TV shows (Atari had been first with this approach with VCS Superman, but never fully capitalized on it). Parker Brothers struck gold with their first 2 releases: Frogger and Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. Determined not to miss out on another property like Star Wars, Atari quickly locked up licensing deals with LucasFilm and Steven Spielberg. They also tried a tie-in with Warner-owned DC Comics, only to realize pack-in comic books don't result in more sales. The bidding frenzy, as well as Atari's own hubris, reached their absolute zenith with Atari's E.T. game.\n\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was Atari's 2nd movie tie-in game, after Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the first bad one (in what would become a long line of). Atari paid an obscene amount of money to Spielberg for E.T., which was the most-successful movie ever at the time, and planned to have the game on store shelves by Thanksgiving, in time for \"Black Friday\" and the 1982 holiday shopping season. Kassar maintains he tried to convince the head of Warner, Steve Ross (who orchestrated the deal) it was impossible to deliver a game in so short a time frame, but that Ross insisted Atari had to do it. Although another executive stated when he told Kassar the same thing, he replied, \"E.T. is such a hot property, whatever we put out will sell.\" (InfoWorld December 5th, 1983, pg. 146). Unfortunately, due to the deal not being finalized until late July and pressure to get the game on the shelves in time for Christmas, programmer Howard Scott Warshaw was left with an unbelievably short timeframe of 5-1/2 weeks (which meant little or no game testing was done), at a time when game development took several months. Warshaw calculated he produced game code (finished, debugged, and documented) at 13 times the industry average! An article from the Chicago Tribune, dated 11-7-1982, stated Atari planned to spend $5 million advertising the game, with Atari's VP of Coporate Advertising, Jan Soderstrom, proclaiming E.T. \"Will be as big a hit if not better than Pac-Man.\" Not learning from their mistake with Pac-Man, Atari over-produced the game, making between 4-5 million (mainly because they needed to sell that many in order to turn a profit), and only selling about 3.5 million. Some of the unsold copies (along with Pac-Man and other products) ended up being dumped in at least 2 landfills.\n\nOn December 8th, 1982, Atari dropped their own belated \"Pearl Harbor\" attack on Wall Street and announced their 4th Quarter sales estimates were only a 10-15% increase, instead of the 50% they originally predicted. It's important to note that they weren't losing money at that point, they just weren't going to make as much! Warner's stock took a big hit after that (overall the stock market dropped 29 points in the 2 days after Atari's announcement), as did all video game-related stocks. The following day, Mattel announced they actually lost money that quarter, which didn't help matters. The day after that, Perry Odak, Atari's President of CED, stepped down, basically taking the fall for the Wall Street announcement (NY Times article); Odak soon joined Nolan Bushnell's Catalyst group (article). Imagic had planned on going public the following week, but the news forced them to withdraw their plans. According to the editorial in the March 1983 issue of Video Games (pg. 6), analysts had been predicting a \"shakeout\" in the video game business for about a year before Atari's announcement, and all the negative reports that followed in the months after only fueled the fears of a market crash. Still, the news shocked most analysts and started Atari's precipitous fall, as well as the industry's.\n\nThe coin-op industry was even more susceptible to the increased competition. Arcade earnings were but a fraction of home sales, but were still far below what they had been. Like home games, operators saw the same drop in 1982-83. Laserdisc games were the last-ditch efforts to sustain their earnings growth, and when that failed, most arcades closed, and operators sent many an arcade game to the dumpster.\n\nAtari, seeing their 4Q troubles ahead and their market share dropping to 60%, tried to restructure their distribution network a month before. They had some 130-140 distributors for their products - far too many than was needed - and some started getting into price wars with each other. On November 1st, Atari told all their distributors their contracts were cancelled and that only a small number of them would be awarded exclusive contracts. Since Atari never bothered to have exclusive distributor contracts prior to then, their competition simply used the same distributors. Those who were forced to preorder for 1982 and were later dropped by Atari simply started shipping unsold product back to them. Since Atari didn't audit the distributors they had dropped, they were forced to buy back whatever they were sent.\n\nNearly all of the 3rd-party VCS game companies that started up in 1982 closed down in 1983, and yet by the end of 1983, nearly 3 dozen more companies had sprung up. Seeing Activision's success, they were convinced the market would soon level off and become stable (much like how some Titanic passengers felt the ship would level off and stay afloat). At this point, there was literally a glut of product - more than there was shelf space available for them - and most of it was awful. Atari's market share fell to 40%. As these companies quickly collapsed, they gave their inventory to distributors for practically next-to-nothing, instead of throwing out their product (Atari had the right idea, but for the wrong reasons). People aren't going to spend $25-$40 for the latest games when they're next to games selling for $2, especially after being burned by the marketing hype for Pac-Man and E.T. Meanwhile, Kassar continued to invest heavily in R&D with no long-term plan on what to do with anything that was created. By the end of 1983, Warner was looking at half a BILLION in losses, and the industry had passed the point of no return.\n\nIEEE spectrum mentioned the situation in an article in their January 1984 issue, sub-titled \"Chaos in Home-Computer and Video-Game Markets\" (pg. 81):\n\nThere was considerably less optimism last year as sales slowed in the home-computer and video-game industries. Startup video-game companies proliferated in 1982, and while industry sales for video games grew by approximately 25 percent in 1983, the number of video-game cartridges produced increased by many times that amount, flooding the market. Also, consumers began moving away from the purchase of traditional video games and towards home computers. As a result, Atari Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., a subsidiary of Warner Communications, dumped truckloads of game cartridges in New Mexico after absorbing heavy losses (Atari said the cartridges were defective). Several recently started companies - like U.S. Games, a subsidiary of Quaker Oats; Data Age; Fox Video Games; and Games by Apollo - closed their doors. Imagic Corp. of Los Gatos, Calif., sold its inventory and cut staff: games that previously cost $30 now reached the consumer priced near $5. Even Activision Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., which held on to profit margins longer than most other companies, posted a large loss late in the year.\n\nFrom Howard Scott Warshaw:\n\n\"Atari, for years, was using the leverage that they had to just screw distributors everywhere. When they had a hot game, they would force distributors to buy copies of the old games that weren't selling anymore, just to get copies of the new game. This is the kind of stuff they were doing. So when things started to turn on them, everyone in the industry was waiting to jump on them with both feet. That's what killed Atari - the ill will that they had generated through their cutthroat business practices on their way up.\"\n\nBoth CEO Raymond Kassar and Executive VP Dennis Groth were charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with insider trading from selling personal shares of company stock minutes before the infamous December 8th, 1982 Wall Street announcement (New York Times article). Atari's stock that day dropped from $52 a share to $36, a 30% drop; Kassar sold his shares 40 minutes before the announcement. In early 1983, two stockholders, Meryl and Richard Gloven, filed suit against Warner Brothers, charging Chairman Steven Ross sold some 140,000 shares of his stock prior to Atari's Wall Street announcement (April/May 1983 issue of Vidiot news blurb), so the man who pushed for E.T. to be rushed to market turns out to have been guilty to insider trading to an even larger degree. Imagine that. But Ross was only starting turn Atari upside-down...\n\nAs a result of being caught by the SEC, Kassar was finally forced to resign 7 months later, in July 1983, and was replaced by James J. Morgan. Warner CEO Steven Ross actually interviewed Morgan, who worked for cigarette company Philip Morris USA and helped develop the Marlboro Man advertising campaign; yes, another ex-marketer from another static business field. Morgan took 2 months off before starting as the new Chairman and CEO of Atari, in September; John Farrand from the coin-op department was the interim CEO. Morgan's first decision was to implement a 30-day freeze on all development. He also fumbled with deciding where to have the 800XL manufactured - a delay that eventually cost Atari to miss what would have been a very profitable Christmas season for them that year, at a time when there was a big push in the industry towards home computers. The few 800XLs that reached store shelves were quickly sold, with a large percentage of those being returned due to being defective. In the summer of 1984, Atari was some $400 million in debt, and on July 1st, Warner Communications basically blindsided Morgan and broke up the company, retaining the arcade and AtariTel divisions and selling off the C.E.D. (Consumer Electronics) and H.C.D. (Home Computer) divisions to Jack Tramiel, the founder of Commodore, and a group of unknown investors for $240 million. Warner received no cash, but received $240 million in long-term 'promissory' notes and warrants for a 32% interest in Tramiel's new venture. Tramiel, in return, received warrants giving him the right to purchase one million shares of Warner common stock at $22 a share. In other words, Ross gave Atari away. This was basically an accounting maneuver by Ross to improve Warner's stock to stop a hostile takeover by Rupert Murdoch. Ross had previously rejected Philips offer to purchase 100% of the company because he wanted to keep a stake in Atari.\n\nIn conclusion, there were many factors which lead to the market crash of 1983-84:\n\nWarner's management style clashed with Nolan Bushnell's, and led to him leaving the company. He was replaced by Ray Kassar, who had no experience with the video game industry, and was either unable or unwilling to adapt to it. His outdated management policies left Atari with no long-term plans on how to proceed beyond the products they had, and his short-sightedness/lack of vision let to competitor's consoles using next-gen processors that Atari paid to develop. He also failed in his primary task to create a corporate structure, instead choosing to run the company like an \"emperor\" with him having to approve every decision. Coupled with his penchant for setting people against each other, the result was an atmosphere of paranoia and fear, which led to much employee turnover, especially in Management.\n\nAtari relied on the VCS for too long and was too late in replacing it with next-gen hardware. Upon Bushnell's exit from Atari, he implored on Gerard and Kassar to stop cutting back on R&D. With the VCS's slow sales in its first year, Bushnell felt it was essential for the company's future to invest in developing their next console, especially with the increasing advancements with the technology. Gerard and Kassar looked at the VCS as the next record player, only needing to increase marketing and advertising while releasing more games for it. The 400/800 hardware was initially designed to be the next console after the VCS, in 1979, but Kassar instead repurposed it for a new line of home computers (400/800). By the time competitors Mattel and Coleco started gaining market share with their Intellivision and Colecovision systems, the same 400/800 hardware was quickly redesigned and released as a console (5200), but this was late 1982 and far too late to make much difference.\n\nAtari's engineers were the 'lifeblood' of the company. Instead, Kassar refused to compensate Atari's engineers for their efforts, or credit them on the games they created, viewing them as insignificant and easily replaceable, and the result was Atari ended up creating their own competition with the rise of 3rd-party software companies (whereas before they enjoyed complete control of the VCS), which led to a glut of product. By the time Atari instituted a royalty program and started crediting designers, it was too late.\n\nAtari failed to implement using larger ROM chips in cartridge production years before, and instead focused on constantly trying to maximize their profit to satisfy their \"bottom line\" (i.e. greed). 8K bank-switched ROMs were developed for Video Chess back in 1979, but were only used once (for Asteroids) prior to Pac-Man. 8K versions of games like Pac-Man and Defender would have been more faithful and generated more sales, but Atari only decided to abandon 4K ROMs after realizing that after the fact with Pac-Man.\n\nAtari's fabled R&D created dozens of amazing products, most of which would have helped Atari maintain their technological edge over their competitors and helped them branch out into other fields. Instead, millions of dollars and countless hours were wasted on projects that were either shelved or later sold off (at a loss) and released by other companies.\n\nAtari moved production of its consoles and computers to outside the U.S. (to Mexico, Taiwan, etc), which allowed others to steal their technology and create dozens of VCS-knockoffs, helping fuel an influx of inferior 3rd-party software.\n\nAtari's Marketing department ended up dictating not only what games should be done, but in what timeframe. The lesson of trying to force game development to fit some preconceived 'deadline' should have been learned with E.T., but in the 18 months that followed E.T.'s release, Marketing's scheduling demands only created more pressure on the programmers to meet them.\n\nThe E.T. debacle, which should be placed squarely on Warner CEO Steve Ross. Ross paid Steve Spielberg anywhere between 20-25 million for the rights to the game, all in a vain attempt to win him over from Universal to Warner. In the end, all Warner got from wooing Spielberg was the Gremlins franchise, which was hardly worth losing Atari for, along with Pelé and the Cosmos NASL team as well (article).\n\nThe mess with how Atari handled their distributors was yet another problem that could have been avoided. They forced distributors to preorder for all of 1982, but mistakenly gave them the option to return any unsold product for credit. If 3rd-party companies hadn't dumped their inventories onto an already-oversaturated market, Atari and larger companies like Mattel and Coleco might have recovered from their own mistakes. Instead, much like E.T.'s ending, the whole industry went into hibernation until Nintendo came along to revive it.\n\nThe price war that was instigated by Commodore's Jack Tramiel and intended to hurt Texas Instruments dragged everyone down, including Atari. The 800 was priced at just over $1k in spring 1981, but 2 years later was well under $200 - less than the cost of manufacturing it. Also, the replacement for the 400/800 computers, the 1200XL, was a complete failure, and the follow-up versions, the 600XL and 800XL, didn't reach the market until late 1983.\n\nLastly, the U.S. was in the midst of a recession, from July 1981 to November 1982 (LINK), so for Atari to force distributors to preorder for all of 1982 - and to buy older, outdated games as a requirement when ordering the latest games - when consumers were cutting back on how much they spent - was woefully ignorant on their part. Pushing out subpar products like VCS Pac-Man and E.T. and the 5200 system did nothing but hasten the inevitable.\n\nAs a footnote, Manny Gerard was interviewed for the Antic podcast on September 8th, 2015 and he admitted Atari made some mistakes, but claimed the biggest one was allowing 3rd-party software companies to make games for the VCS. Naturally, he failed to acknowledge the fact that the formation of 3rd-party software company Activision was solely due to Kassar's poor treatment of Atari's programmers. As Rob Fulop opined, it would have taken very little (financially) to keep people from leaving. With Warner behind them, money wasn't Atari's problem, their management was. That's why I have management listed above as the first issue, because that alone directly or indirectly led to all the other issues mentioned. Gerard convinced Warner founder Steve Ross to purchase Atari, and then later brought in Kassar to lead it, but who ultimately destroyed it. Letting Kassar run the company was the biggest mistake in my opinion. Atari was first described to Gerard as a \"fast growing technology-based entertainment company\". Whatever possessed him to pick an ex-marketing VP from Burlington textiles to run Atari, we'll never know (he passed away in December 2023 at 90 LINK. Kassar passed away 6 years earlier LINK).\n\nQ: What happened to Atari after Warner Communications sold it in 1984?\n\nA: The Atari that everyone knew and loved (1972-1984) is long gone. In its absence, there have been a string of \"imposters\". The infamous market \"crash\" of 1983-84 decimated the video game marketplace. It impacted every company, including Atari, and by early 1984 only a few companies remained in business.\n\nAfter being ousted from Commodore, Tramiel set up his own company, Tramel Technologies, Ltd. (he intentionally misspelled his name since most people incorrectly pronounced it as \"tra-meal\" instead of \"tra-mel\") on May 17th with $75 million from unnamed investors, and renamed his company Atari Corporation with the purchase of these Atari divisions (InfoWorld August 6th, 1984 article, pg. 51-52; A History of Tramel Technology/Atari article). The coin-op division remained with Warner and became Atari Games. Morgan returned to Philip Morris USA, where he later became famous for his claims that cigarettes are no more addictive than gummy bears, and that Philip Morris had never attempted to intentionally market tobacco products toward minors. Moran later became President and CEO of Philip Morris USA in 1994 and retired 3 years later. In 2000, he testified for Philip Morris USA in a case brought against them by someone who had smoked Philip Morris's cigarettes and died of smoking-related illness (LINK).\n\nThe following is a list of all the various divisions within Atari that existed at some point between 1972 and 1984:\n\nAMPLIFONE CORPORATION\n\nATARI PRODUCTS CO.\n\nATARI PUBLISHING - Became AtariSoft\n\nATARITEL\n\nCOIN-OP\n\nCONSUMER - Became CONSUMER ELECTRONICS (CED) in 1982.\n\nCOMPUTER/PERSONAL COMPUTER - Became HOME COMPUTER (HCD) in 1982.\n\nCONSUMER PRODUCTS GROUP\n\nCORPORATE RESEARCH\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE\n\nCYAN ENGINEERING PRODUCT\n\nEDUCATIONAL\n\nELECTRONIC BOARD GAME (later renamed ELECTRONIC TOYS & GAMES)\n\nELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION\n\nENGINEERING COMPUTER\n\nINTERNATIONAL (sales and marketing)\n\nPINBALL - From 1976 to January 1978, when it was folded into Coin-Op.\n\nPROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS - shut down in 1980.\n\nRESTAURANT OPERATING\n\nSOFTWARE PRODUCTS\n\nTHE ATARITEL DIVISION:\n\nThe history of this division can be traced back to Atari's Cyan Engineering, when in 1976 they began work on a video telephone. Codenamed \"Phoney\", it was headed by Larry Emmons, Dave Stokes, and Michael Cooperhart. Joe Keenan suggested it might have potential as a toy, but 3 years later the project was mothballed. In 1981 it was decided to revive the project, now codenamed \"Project Falcon\" (first mentioned in the March 1983 issue of The Video Game Update, pg. 3, and again in the April 1983 issue, pg. 1. It was also covered in the June 1983 issue of Video Review, pg. 22-23). The new division was headed by Steve Bristow, and Atari spent 2 years designing new telecom products for consumers. Both Porche Design and Morison Cousins Associates were commissioned to develop product designs. The July/August 1983 V2N2 issue of Atari Age (pg. 7) mentions Atari was close to unveiling their latest product division, AtariTel. The 1983 V2N7 issue (exact date unknown) of Atari Life also mentions Project Falcon becoming AtariTel - Atari's 4th product division (actually 5th if you include the short-lived Pinball division) - and features quotes from AtariTel president Peter Wensberg. Atari's own Cyan Engineering developed at least one of the new phones, codename \"Project P\", which was the Picture Phone that allowed you to send digital photos to someone while you were talking to them. The phone used custom VLSI. Future variations planned were for a color photo version, and one that processed video and produced caricatures or 3-D pictures, along with the ability to print out photos. Here's the commercial Atari had created for their Telectra model. Atari planned to start releasing AtariTel products by early 1984, but soon after AtariTel's announcement, the company went under another restructuring, with James J. Morgan replacing Raymond Kassar. The AtariTel division was shut down soon after that. In December 1984, Warner sold off the AtariTel division to Mitsubishi, who ended up releasing the Picture Phone through their Santa Clara, CA-based subsidiary, Luma Telecom, Inc., who renamed it the Lumaphone. Michael Current's website covers the complete history of the AtariTel division.\n\nTHE COIN-OP DIVISION:\n\nIn January 1985, AT Games Inc. was established by Namco Limited and Warner Communications for the purpose of taking over Atari Games. An agreement was reached in early February where Namco America Inc. would own a majority of the company and handle the management of it. Namco would hold about 45% interest in the business and WCI would hold closer to 40%, with about 20% held by Atari Games officers. Atari Ireland Limited (manufacturing plant at Tipperary) and Atari International (U.K.) Inc. (sales) were included in the transaction. Later that same month, AT Games was renamed to Atari Games. The acquisition gave Namco the exclusive rights to distribute Atari games in Japan. Soon after, Namco founder Masaya Nakamura began losing interest and patience in Atari Games, as he viewed Atari as a competitor to Namco and was hesitant to pour additional funds and resources into the company. Nakamura also disliked having to share ownership with Warner Communications, fearing it could lead to him losing control of Atari Games and cause Namco to go under. Namco president Hideyuki Nakajima grew frustrated with Nakamura's attempts at marketing Atari video games in Japan, and had constant disagreements with him over which direction to take the company. Viewing the majority-acquisition as a failure, Namco America sold 33% of its ownership stake to a group of Atari Games employees led by Nakajima in 1987. This prompted Nakajima to resign from Namco America and become president of Atari Games. Atari Games purchased the Barrel of Fun and 2001 Entertainment Center chains on September 1st, 1987, effectively getting back into the arcade business. They also got back into the home video game business with the establishment of Tengen, a publisher that challenged Nintendo's licensing restrictions for the NES by selling several unlicensed games, which included ports of Namco arcade games. Though its sell-off made Atari Games an independent entity, Namco still held a minority stake in the company and Nakamura retained his position as its board chairman until the middle of 1988.\n\nWhen Warner merged with Time in 1989, a Time-Warner Interactive label appeared on their arcade games (in early 1994, Atari Games would officially be renamed that, as was Tengen). In 1990 Namco sold its Atari Games shares back to Warner but bought the arcade chains, with Nakajima staying with Atari. On March 5th, 1996, Time-Warner sold Time-Warner Interactive to WMS Industries (the merger of Williams and Bally/Midway, when Williams purchased them in 1988), who turned around and spun off part of its Midway Manufacturing division as Midway Games. T-WI was renamed Atari Games and became a subsidiary of Midway Games as a result. On December 22nd, 1999, Midway renamed Atari Games Corporation to Midway Games West Inc., to avoid confusion with Hasbro Interactive's Atari Interactive division. The Atari logo for home conversions of Atari's arcade games during this time appeared under the Midway Home Entertainment label. In spite of all this corporate shuffling, a few of the Atari veterans, such as Ed Logg and John Skruch, remained. Ed Logg, whose credits include the arcade versions of Asteroids and Centipede, as well as VCS/2600 Othello, was still there by the summer of 1999. Midway shut down Midway Games West in February 2003, but it remained an entity. On February 12th, 2009, Midway Games filed for bankruptcy. Ironically, Warner Bros. purchased most of Midway's assets on July 10th, 2009 for approximately $49 million.\n\nTHE CONSUMER DIVISIONS:\n\nAfter taking over Atari, Tramiel immediately ceased all video game development, cancelled several projects (including the 7800 and 600XL), and fired 700 employees, as his focus was on developing and releasing a new line of home computers (BusinessWeek article, July 23rd, 1984, pg. 90-91; Electronic Games article, October 1984, pg. 14; Computer Games news, November/December 1984, pg. 20), starting with the Atari STs; the previous issue of Electronic Games had a 4-page article announcing the 7800 and at least 12 games. The December issue of Electronic Games reiterated Tramiel's plan to focus on computers (article), as did the February 1985 issue of Big K (article). At the 1985 Winter CES show, Jack Tramiel stated Atari was going to change its image from that of a game company to that of a microcomputer organization, and announced no less than 7 new computers (8-bit 65XE, 65XEM, 65XEP, 130XE; 16-bit 130ST, 260ST, 520ST (ROM article, February/March 1985 V1N10, pg. 54). Side note: prior to Tramiel taking over Atari, Atari was in early talks with Nintendo over a possible deal for Atari to handle distribution of Nintendo's NES, but with Atari in chaos at the time, Nintendo decided to release it themselves. 1 year after the takeover, the media confirmed there were no plans to release the 7800 (Computer Entertainment news blurb, August 1985, pg. 71). 2 years after the takeover, Tramiel, seeing Nintendo's success with their NES console, decided to get back into the video game market by resurrecting and re-releasing systems (VCS/2600, 7800, 400/800/XL) that were originally developed by Atari Inc., with either a new case, a new name, or both. The VCS/2600 became the 2600 JR, and the 65XE computer became the XEGS console. Both new and unreleased games were released for all of them, but the main reason for their release was to sell off the mountains of games Atari still had in their warehouses. Some former programmers, such as Bob Polaro, were sub-contracted to either finish some of their prototypes or program new games. Once that was done, and with their line of 16-bit ST computers failing to compete against IBM PCs and its clones, Atari decided to make a serious attempt to recapture some of the now-hot market again, buoyed by the huge success of both Nintendo and Sega. Side note: Atari also had the opportunity to distribute Sega's Genesis in 1988, but the deal ultimately failed to materialize again due to Jack Tramiel. In 1989, Atari purchased the Handy handheld gaming system being developed by Epyx and released it as the Lynx, to moderate success (5 million were sold). On January 1st, 1992, the VCS/2600 was officially discontinued, along with the 7800. According to VP of Marketing Dana Plotkin, the entire inventory of games for both systems was sold to Consolidated Stores Corp./Odd Lots (a department store chain based in Ohio), with no plans to produce more; the reason given was to focus on the Lynx. In November 1993, Atari released the Jaguar game system, which proved to be the company's undoing. Hampered by poor business ethics and lack of major advertising, as well as a lack of any major 3rd-party support (a little over 100 games were made for it, over 5 years), the Lynx was eventually discontinued in 1994; the Jaguar would follow suit 2 years later. Again, a combination of poor treatment of 3rd-party developers and suppliers as well as a lack of any serious advertising resulted in only 125,000 Jaguar systems being sold by December 1995, with another 100,00 left in warehouses. A settlement with Sega over patent infringements gave Atari a brief lifeline of cash (Sega purchased $40 million of Atari's stock and paid Atari $50 million to license over 70 patents from 1977-1984). Both companies agreed to cross-license up to 5 games per year through 2001, but ultimately nothing came of it, and the Jaguar was discontinued by early 1996. On July 30th, 1996, Atari Corp. merged with disk drive maker JTS. In his resignation, former Atari alumni Don Thomas wrote a short, insightful bit about the merger and the history leading up to it that asks more questions than it answers.\n\nOn February 23rd, 1998, JTS sold substantially all of the assets of the company's Atari Division, consisting primarily of Atari home computer games and the intellectual property rights and license agreements associated with such games (the \"Atari Assets\"), to HIACXI, Corp. (\"HIAC\") for $5,000,000 in cash. HIAC XI, Corp. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive, Inc. created in Delaware for purchasing Atari. In May 1998, Hasbro Interactive renamed HIAC XI, Corp. to Atari Interactive, Inc. The following is a brief summary of what Hasbro got (read the entire 8-K form that was submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding this transaction, which specifically lists some of the things):\n\nThe update of Centipede came (in small part) from the ashes of Atari Corp. Interestingly, Hasbro resurrected the Atari name and logo; many of their classic releases during that time (Atari Arcade Hits 2, for example) appeared under the Atari name (ad).\n\nOn December 6th, 2000, Hasbro entered into a \"long-term licensing agreement\" with Infogrames, wherein the French company acquired 100% of Hasbro Interactive (which included the Atari bits they owned - article and sales report). On October 2008, Infogrames completed its $11 million stock purchase of Atari, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary of the French publisher. In May 2009 Infogrames announced it would be changing their name to Atari SA. In April 2010, Atari board member and former CEO David Gardner resigned, and Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell joined the board!\n\nIn January 2013, Atari US filed for bankruptcy and planned to sell all of its assets - including the famous \"Fuji\" logo - in an effort to distance itself from its parent company, Atari SA (Forbes article). After approaching some 180 potential buyers (Wall Street Journal article), Atari was unable to find one willing to purchase everything, and auctioned off everything instead (Gamasutra article).\n\nIn June 2017, Atari announced a new VCS system, codenamed Project Ataribox. This is a Linux-based gaming PC in an original VCS-styled case. 2 models were available, the base or \"Onyx\" all-black model and a Collector's Edition woodgrain (or \"black walnut\") model. 2 different wireless controllers were available as well, the classic (similar to the standard Atari joystick) and the modern (gamepad). Preorders were taken in May 2018, with initial shipments in December 2020 and worldwide shipments in June 2021. In April 2021, 2 new divisions were created - Atari Gaming and Atari Blockchain. CEO Frédéric Chesnais stepped down and Wade J. Rosen took over. In November 2021, Atari announced Atari XP, which was their effort to release new VCS/2600 cartridges. The first 3 were Aquaventure, Saboteur, and Yars' Return; the first 2 were unreleased prototypes, and the 3rd was a lousy hack of Yars' Revenge that was initially available on several Flashback models (LINK). These were sold either as cartridge-only (for $50 each) or as boxed Limited Editions (for $150 each). Every Standard Edition Aquaventure cart had the pcbs installed incorrect, and replacements were sent out. In June 2022, Atari announced 10 more VCS/2600 carts to be released (for $100 each), for the company's 50th Anniversary Collection. Adventure and Missile Command were the first 2 announced, with Warlords, Super Breakout, Crystal Castles, Haunted House, Yars' Revenge, Centipede, Asteroids, and Gravitar announced soon after.\n\nSOFTWARE\n\nQ: How many different games were made for the VCS/2600?\n\nA: At last count, there are 507 unique, original games that were officially released between 1977-1992, not counting titles that were renamed or slightly altered (128) and unreleased prototypes (240). If you include all the pirate clones and unauthorized versions (well over 7,000), and homebrews (over 400), the grand total swells to over 9,000! And then there's the 1,000+ hacks that have been created over the years...\n\nQ: Have any new VCS/2600 games been released lately?\n\nA: Well over 100 new games have been developed for the Atari VCS/2600 since the mid-1990s. Commonly referred to as \"homebrews\", most of these can either be purchased on cartridge or downloaded for use with an emulator or to make your own cartridge. Here is a partial list of new games recently released:\n\nAardvark - Accurate version of Tago Electronics' Anteater arcade game.\n\nAmoeba Jump - Variant of the 2006 flash game Winterbells by Ferry Halim, which itself is a variant of Quick Step.\n\nBoulder Dash - An impressive conversion of the Atari 8-bit classic.\n\nDonkey Kong VCS - An impressive 32K version of the Nintendo arcade classic with all 4 screens.\n\nGorf Arcade - Superior version of the Midway arcade game that includes all 5 screens.\n\nLady Bug Arcade - Improved 32K arcade conversion with 3 more mazes and a maze select screen.\n\nLode Runner - A fantastic version of the original Broderbund Apple II classic by Douglas E. Smith that includes all 150 levels.\n\nMappy - Faithful 32K version of the Namco arcade game\n\nQyx - Excellent version of the Taito Qix arcade classic.\n\nRobotWar: 2684 - Excellent version of the arcade classic.\n\nSoul of the Beast - A 4K version of Psygnosis' 1989 classic Shadow of the Beast.\n\nSquish 'Em - Another great port of an Atari 8-bit classic.\n\nStacker - A conversion of the popular arcade redemption game.\n\nSuper Cobra Arcade - Impressive 32K conversion of Konami's classic arcade game.\n\nTower of Rubble - Conversion of a PC game that was an entry for the 2017 CGA Jam.\n\nVenture Reloaded - An incredible 32K hack of CommaVid's original arcade conversion.\n\nWizard of Wor Arcade - More accurate version of the Midway arcade classic.\n\nZoo Keeper - Fantastic version of the Taito arcade classic.\n\nQ: Where can I download game instructions?\n\nA: Several sites offer manuals online, in text, html, and PDF formats:\n\nAtari Compendium\n\nAtariage\n\nAtarimania\n\nAtari Manual Tome Hasn't been updated since 2002.\n\nDigital Press Hasn't been updated since 2011.\n\nQ: What are the most and least popular games?\n\nA: This can be a subjective matter, of course, but here are some of the most popular:\n\nAdventure\n\nAir-Sea Battle\n\nAsteroids\n\nAtlantis\n\nBerzerk\n\nBreakout\n\nCentipede\n\nChopper Command\n\nCircus Atari\n\nCombat\n\nDecathlon, The Activision\n\nDefender\n\nDemon Attack\n\nDonkey Kong\n\nEnduro\n\nFreeway\n\nFrogger\n\nGalaxian\n\nH.E.R.O.\n\nHaunted House\n\nKaboom!\n\nKeystone Kapers\n\nLaser Blast\n\nMegamania\n\nMissile Command\n\nMoon Patrol\n\nMs. Pac-Man\n\nNight Driver\n\nPhoenix\n\nPitfall!\n\nRiver Raid\n\nSeaquest\n\nSkiing\n\nSolaris\n\nSpace Invaders\n\nStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nSuper Breakout\n\nTennis\n\nVanguard\n\nVideo Pinball\n\nWarlords\n\nYars' Revenge\n\nHere are some of the least popular:\n\nAcid Drop\n\nAir Raid\n\nAirlock\n\nAmidar\n\nBachelor Party/Bachelorette Party\n\nBeat 'Em and Eat 'Em\n\nBugs\n\nBurning Desire\n\nCathouse Blues\n\nChallenge\n\nChase the Chuck Wagon\n\nCocoNuts\n\nCondor Attack\n\nCuster's Revenge\n\nDancing Plate\n\nDouble Dragon\n\nEggomania\n\nEncounter at L-5\n\nFire Fly\n\nFootball\n\nGas Hog\n\nGolf\n\nHome Run\n\nHuman Cannonball\n\nInca Gold\n\nJames Bond 007\n\nKarate\n\nKing Kong\n\nKnight on the Town\n\nKool-Aid Man\n\nMasters of the Universe: The Power of He-Man\n\nMusic Machine, The\n\nName This Game\n\nOut of Control\n\nPicnic\n\nPiece O' Cake\n\nRevenge of the Beefsteak Tomatoes\n\nRobin Hood\n\nSkin Diver\n\nSneak'n Peek\n\nSorcerer\n\nSpike's Peak\n\nSpringer\n\nSssnake\n\nStar Fox\n\nStargunner\n\nSwordQuest (all 3 - EarthWorld, FireWorld, and WaterWorld)\n\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre, The\n\nWarplock\n\nX-Man\n\nQ: What are the most common and most rare games?\n\nA: The simple law of supply and demand is the biggest determining factor; the more popular a game was or the more copies that were produced back in the day, the less valuable (monetarily) a game is worth. Some of the best and most popular games are only worth a few dollars at most. It's the games from small companies with production runs limited to a few hundred or even a few dozen that are worth more to collectors, since they're the hardest to find. Other factors are the condition of the cart and the packaging, what label variation it is, and whether the cart is loose or includes the box and manual (CIB or Complete In Box), and if so, whether or not the box is sealed. Several sites offer online price and/or rarity guides, as do several books. Generally, you'll find higher prices on Ebay than you would through online message boards.\n\nAs for which game is the rarest, that game is Air Raid by Men-A-Vision. This was the one and only release from this company, which has a unique, blue, T-bar handle-shaped cartridge casing. Less than a dozen copies have been found since the mid-'90s. A boxed copy went up for sale on eBay in 2010, and sold for a staggering $31k - nearly 10x the value of a loose cart. And like most rare carts, it's a horrible game (to play). What's worse, the game is actually a hacked/pirated version of U.S. Games' Space Jockey (a game that's currently worth about $3 boxed)!\n\nQ: What VCS/2600 software was announced but never released?\n\nA: Atari Compendium has a list for most with photos and related info here.\n\nQ: What was the GameLine and what games were available for it? Were there any other services like it?\n\nA: GameLine was a service offered by Control Video Corporation that allowed you to download games to the VCS/2600 over regular phone lines via the use of their GameLine Master Module. The complete kit contains the Master Module (an 8K RAM cartridge with internal 1200 baud modem - more tech info can be found on the Stella Archive), telephone connecting cord, a duplex T-adapter, owner's manual, registration guide, GameLine membership cards, and \"temporary\" game directory & instructions. It originally sold for $49.95 and there was a one-time membership fee of $15. Charges were about $.10 a game or $1 for up to an hour of play. Contest games were $1 and there was a $.50 charge to enter a score. Once it connected, it downloaded the menu program to the battery-backed 2K of RAM. A title screen appeared and \"Assembly of Trumpeters For Reveille (First Call)\" played. Next, a screen appeared for you to enter a 3-digit number for your ID, and after that another screen where you selected the game you wanted via a 3-digit number, or you could enter 999 for a special \"browse\" menu. Once the game loaded, a screen would appear with both the game's name and the company who made it, and a tune very similar to the German Army WWI bugle call \"No. 2 Battery\" played. On your birthday, a screen would appear with the message, \"Happy Birthday! All of your play today is free!\" while the first 2 bars of \"Happy Birthday\" played. One of the game catalogs that was archived lists 76 games which included Save The Whales - a game long thought to be vaporware until it was found years later. The GameLine system became QuantumLink (also known as Q-Link), an online service for Commodore computer users, which became America On-Line, the most successful online service ever. See Dan Skelton's GameLine article for photos and more information and a complete list of games that were offered, along with footage of it running.\n\n2 other similar services were close to going into service at the time. One was a joint venture between Atari and Activision in 1983 called Electronic Publishing Systems (EPS). They developed the \"Electronic Pipeline\", a game service for the Atari VCS/2600 that was to sell wireless game cartridges with which users could select and play up to 40 different games each month for a low monthly subscription fee. A TV commercial was created for it, and the service was in alpha testing and a mere 4 days from installing the transmission equipment in the first test market when it was indefinitely postponed due to Warner's sale of Atari in 1984.\n\nThe other was \"Project Zelda\", a top-secret plan to distribute games online (via cable). From my interview with Steve Kranish (who designed the head end hardware):\n\nSteve Kranish states there might have been another possible reason:\n\nZelda would have put Parker directly into the distribution business, competing with its major customers such as Toys-R-Us. As a direct distributor of (video game) content, Parker would have even been in a position to handle material from other video game producers, if it wanted to. This could have given it a very dominant position in the business. The channel was to have been used to milk a little more money from older games, and provide teaser access to new games that would be available for a few days, and then taken off the channel for a few months, to encourage cartridge sales. But putting Parker in direct competition with its biggest customers would have been very bad for the traditional (paper) side of the business, which needed Toys-R-Us and the like as a distribution channel. So it is possible that this conflict of interests played a major role in the demise of Zelda.\n\nQ: Which VCS/2600 games use the Paddle controllers?\n\nA:\n\nArcade Pong (homebrew)\n\nAstroblast (can also use a joystick)\n\nAstronomer (can also use a joystick)\n\nAvalanche (homebrew) (can also use a joystick)\n\nBachelor Party / Bachelorette Party / Gigolo / Burning Desire\n\nBackgammon\n\nBeat 'Em & Eat 'Em / Lady in Wading\n\nBell Hopper (can also use a joystick)\n\nBirthday Mania\n\nBlackjack\n\nBreakout / Breakaway IV\n\nBrik (homebrew) (can also use a joystick)\n\nBrik 180 (homebrew) (can also use a joystick)\n\nBugs>\n\nBumper Bash (uses both paddles)\n\nByte Before Christmas, The (Bell Hopper mini game)(homebrew)(can also use a joystick)\n\nCanyon Bomber\n\nCasino / Poker Plus\n\nCircus Atari / Circus\n\nCircus Atariage (homebrew)\n\nDemons to Diamonds\n\nDrive!

Neither Atari nor any 3rd-party software companies released any games that fully supported the Trak-Ball controllers. All they do is convert the analog signals generated by the Trak-Ball into the same digital signals that a joystick provides. See this article for more information.
