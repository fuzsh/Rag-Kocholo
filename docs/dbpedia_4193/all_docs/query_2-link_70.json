        "text": "Epoch, better know for their game software and toy products, was actually very involved with hardware development in Japan dating back to their first console release in July 1981 - the Epoch Cassette Vision. This very obscure system was actually a hybrid pong/cartridge-based unit - the first of its kind in Japan. Though financial windfalls were never achieved, the moderate success that the Cassette Vision did enjoy was due to one reason - correct price positioning.\n\nIn 1979, Bandai was the first to release the first programmable game cartridge in Japan with their release of the Super Vision 8000. This new technology (to the Japan market) would cost you $560 USD ($1,300 in 2007 dollars). Epoch, having been a first hand witness to this console's eventual failure, wisely decided to produce a system at an affordable price point for the general buying public. The Cassette Vision was released for $135 USD ($275 USD in 2007 dollars), which was much more palatable to the still relatively virgin Japanese gaming market. The big question - was this a good value?\n\nAs stated in previous reviews, pong based consoles enjoyed a prolonged following in Japan well into the early 1980s while the video game player in the USA had been exposed to the new programmable game cartridge systems much earlier (1976). Epoch attempted to capitalize in both of these arenas - the Cassette Vision supported both pong and programmable game cartridge technology. To be able to adequately describe how this was possible requires a little more information on how the pong industry evolved.\n\nDuring the mid to late 1970s, technology was evolving at a very fast pace, primarily on the hardware side. Pong games grew more complex and greater variations were able to be produced. What had occurred in the past was that a new pong console was developed and then released under a new version/name every time a jump in technology was introduced. Obviously, this was a costly venture for the various console manufacturers. At the same time, the size of the new components that were used to drive the machines, and included pong games, decreased. Together, these advances in hardware lead to the development of 'pong on a chip' game cartridges.\n\nEssentially, the manufacture could produce a base pong system with a standard set of hardware installed and a new pong game cartridge would contain not only the game itself but also a processing chip. This chip was used to in essence 'upgrade' the base system's hardware to enable game play with the new software. Distributing technology in the form of a game cartridge was much more cost effective, not too mention efficient, for the manufacturer while at the same time saved the consumer plenty as well by not having to upgrade their pong system all the time. Almost all developers and manufacturers in the mid 1970s and early 1980s migrated to this method of upgrade deployment.\n\nIt seems that Epoch decided that this may be the most efficient way to support both pong and programmable game cartridges. The Cassette Vision produced both game types (pong and programmable) at a resolution of 54 x 62 in 8 colors. This base hardware package was very outdated at the time of release in 1981. The console does produce sounds internally, but I am not sure of the details of the output. The end result was that pong games looked great, but the hardware (inside the individual game cart) could only produce below average graphics for the programmable game cartridges.\n\nThe console itself is rather odd looking, but has a classy feel about it. The rectangular grey main casing is constructive of heavy plastics and sports a black inverted T faceplate highlighting the various button and toggle switches and controls. The controllers are built into the console. Two paddle-type knobs flank the respective top left and right sides of the console which control horizontal and vertical movement. Lever-1 and Lever-2, toggle-looking controls, are utilized for horizontal movement in some games and are located on the lower right and left. Four action buttons line the bottom front of the console (labeled PUSH-1 through PUSH-4). Other basic push-buttons (power, etc.) are featured in the center of the console. Though this system is not small, measuring in at 13.25\" W x 10.50\" L 3.25\" H (33.66 cm W x 26.67 cm L x 8.26 cm H), it is surprising light (3 lbs / 1.58 kg)."
