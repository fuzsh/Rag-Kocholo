        "text": "Ummm...\n\nAnyway, I'm not going to argue with you. I just feel that Sega made the mistake of denying third party titles at first. And Nintendo did lose their hold on companies eventually (Ultra Games is a wonderful example of that). Business is business.\n\nI agree, both companies made their share of mistakes, even if those mistakes all came down to doing their best to make sure that the software they're offering is top quality. If you think about it in 80'ties categories, you'll quickly realize that poor quality software and \"barely games\" were a plague back then, so Nintendo's \"Seal of Quality\" and SEGA's initial drive towards first-party development and restrictive third-party policies make much more sense. The companies wanted to show that their platforms offer quality software, so these moves \"make sense\" in that context. Now, they didn't necessarily work out as intended, but at least the intentions were good... cue \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\".\n\nIt depends on local law, but in US most of the time this is private infrastructure. California in fact once tried to introduce competition against PG&E, it almost triggered an energy crisis due to raising price.\n\nThis is because the U.S. takes privatization a couple steps too far. Infrastructure central to the operation of a country shouldn't be in the hands of a private company since you might end up in a situation where the electric company de facto owns the country. That's all entirely off-topic though.\n\nWell actually Foxi, I was reading this book about how companies have monopolized the food industry in my country. But nobody knows about it except the well informed and the people who do the monopolizing. And they manage to evade the laws that're supposed to prevent this sort of thing. And as far as I'm concerned, lack of competition always brings about poorer standards and higher prices. I'm sure you noticed how awful the living standards in Communist Russia were. The government owned everything. But I don't think Nintendo was a money grubbing business: sure, their goal was to make money, but they weren't greedy. I don't think they ever have been, either. I could argue and say they had the gamers' best interests at heart when they monopolized the industry.\n\nThat's this thing we in the business of scepticism call \"conspiracy theories\". It's pretty obvious that huge corporations lobby the government to steer legislature this way or another, but they're still bound by the law no matter how big they are. The phenomenon you're describing is called \"price fixing\" and it can lead to severe economical consequences for the companies involved. Also, I have to wonder who wrote the book about something nobody's supposed to know except the people involved - that sort of points the finger of blame at the author.\n\nThat's this thing we in the business of scepticism call \"conspiracy theories\".

And I always knew there was a monopoly on the industry just because the products' quality was worsening but the prices were going higher. They can get the money out of the people by introducing something new. As we saw with the Xbone: it had an updated graphics engine. And a new iPhone could load apps 4 seconds faster than the last one. There are people who will buy things because of reasons like this, a fact these companies exploit; y'know, because it's in a businesses' interest to make money. I know it could sound like a conspiracy theory like Area 51 or Elvis, but sometimes having enough evidence can make a theory plausible enough to be believed. Plus, people will always find a way to circumvent the law. And their stashes of money make this really easy. I mean, if I had as much money as MJ, I wouldn't have to pirate. And despite the book being written in the '70s, I kept reading things that sounded more like they should've been written in this last decade.\n\nEdit: Consider this: Nintendo no longer holds the monopoly on video games. This means that prices don't have to be as high because there's competition now. So, why are prices just as expensive as they were 20 years ago?\n\nHe was a very respected journalist from the NY Times and did his homework well.

As for the iPhones, some of them are cosmetic upgrades, some are groundbreaking developments. The new one is equipped with an Apple A7 which currently offers more bang than any equivalent on the market.\n\nI'm not sure if using the XBox One example is particularly relevant when the XBox One's GPU (1.32 TFLOPS) is literally 5.5 times stronger than the XBox 360'ties (240 GFLOPS). As for the iPhones, some of them are cosmetic upgrades, some are groundbreaking developments. The new one is equipped with an Apple A7 which houses a Cortex-A53 and a Cortex-A57, that's more bang than anything else on the market right now.\n\nWhile the power stat is impressive, what other features could they have that is innovative different from last generation consoles in order to justify its price hike? Nintendo came out with a tablet, but their console isn't very expensive. (Power and games are moot when it comes to the field of innovation.) They could raise the price to get back some of the money they've lost, but they haven't. If anything, they've tried to make it more affordable so more people can buy it. Besides, you're describing new power capabilities, which I really don't care about anyway. The only time I care about them is when it ruins my gameplay experience. The engine slows down or some features get spotty; or the general picture loses quality. Or the game freezes. And how did we get off on this discussion about current generation electronics and their power capabilities in a thread dedicated to choosing the worst console of the second era and explaining that choice anyway? That's crazy."
