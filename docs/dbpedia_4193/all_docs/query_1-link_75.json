        "text": "Atari has just announced that the Atari 2600+ is available for pre-order, with expected shipment in November 2023. While my suspicion is that this is basically just an emulation-based cartridge dumper, meaning it likely won’t be able to play flash carts or modern homebrews with special processor chips, it’s still impressive that we get a modern way to play both Atari 2600 and 7800 cartridge games on a small, and relatively inexpensive ($129.99), HDMI-based system. The full compatibility list is here.\n\nIt looks like Atari also has a nice CX30+ Paddle Controller Bundle, with a 4 Games in 1 Cartridge, for just $39.99. That’s another solid deal, especially because the community is always on the lookout for working paddle controllers.\n\nFinally, the rest of the updated site is worth checking out for new-to-Atari (not the community) cartridge titles like an enhanced version of all-time classic, Berzerk, now with improved gameplay and speech. At just $29.99, it’s a far better deal than some of their previous modern cartridge releases.\n\nI’d say it’s well worth supporting Atari’s positive retro efforts here. The current leadership really seems to get it, although I would have preferred the included Atari 2600 joystick to be updated with a second button for compatibility with the Atari 7800 games that require one. I know I’m set in regards to 7800-compatible two-button controllers, but I bet many new owners won’t be."
