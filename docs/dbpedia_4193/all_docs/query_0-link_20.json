Poised as a competitor to the then king of the hill Atari 2600,\n\nMattel Electronics called their new product \"Intelligent Television\", stemming\n\nlargely from their marketing plans to release a compatible computer keyboard\n\nfor their video games console. Mattel's marketing was anything *but*\n\nintelligent and almost destroyed the company by 1984. In one sense the\n\nsystem was very successful, with over 3 million units sold and 125 games\n\nreleased before the system was discontinued by INTV Corp. in 1990.\n\nThe original Master Component was test marketed in Fresno, California in\n\nlate 1979. The response was excellent, and Mattel went national with their\n\nnew game system in late 1980. The first year's production run of 200,000\n\nunits was completely sold out! To help enhance it's marketability, Mattel\n\nalso marketed the system in Sears stores as the Super Video Arcade, and at\n\nRadio Shack as the Tandyvision One in the early 1980's.\n\n1980 was a turbulent year for the Intellivision. Mattel announced that an\n\n\"inexpensive\" keyboard expansion would be available in 1981 for the master\n\ncomponent to be dropped into. This was to turn the system into a powerful\n\n64K home computer that could do everything from play games to balance your\n\ncheckbook. There was a great deal of marketing money and press coverage\n\ndevoted to this unit; a third of the box for the GTE/Sylvania Intellivision\n\ndescribes the features of this proposed expansion. Many people bought an\n\nIntellivision with plans to turn it into a computer when the expansion\n\nmodule was released. Months, then years passed and the original expansion\n\nkeyboard was released only in a few test areas in late 1981. With the\n\nprice too high and the initial reaction poor, the product was scrapped in\n\n1982 before being released nationwide.\n\n1982 saw many changes in both the videogame industry and the Intellivision\n\nproduct line. A voice-synthesis module called Intellivoice made sound and\n\nspeech and integral part of gameplay, through the use of special voice-\n\nenhanced cartridges. The Intellivision II was also released this year,\n\nwhich one company spokesperson described as \"smaller and lighter that the\n\noriginal, yet with the same powerful 16-bit microprocessor\". The new\n\nconsole was more compact than the first, and its grayish body made it look\n\nmore like a sophisticated electronic device than the original design.\n\n1983 brought more promises from the folks at Mattel, the most significant\n\nof which being the Intellivision III. This was shown off at the January\n\n1983 CES show, and lauded in the videogame mags for many months afterwards.\n\nIn June of 1983 at the Summer CES show, Mattel announced it was killing the\n\nIntellivision III and including most of its high-profile features into\n\ntheir long-awaited computer expansion, the Entertainment Computer System.\n\nProbably the most ambitious effort the Intellivision team had undertaken,\n\nthe Entertainment Computer System was comprised of a computer keyboard\n\nadd-on, a 49-key music synthesizer, ram expansion for the keyboard add-on\n\nto expand it to a full 64K RAM and 24K ROM, a data recorder to store programs,\n\na 40-column thermal printer, and an adapter which would allow you to play\n\nAtari 2600 games on your Intellivision. The RAM expansion modules, data\n\nrecorder, and thermal printer never made it past the drawing board, and the\n\nmusic synthesizer had but one software title to take advantage of its\n\ncapabilities. While the 2600 adapter greatly expanded the library of\n\navailable games, much of the steam this generated had already been stolen by\n\nColeco's own expansion module.\n\n1984 would spell the end of the original Intellivision as the world knew it.\n\nTerry E. Valeski, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Sales at Mattel\n\nElectronics, along with a group of investors, purchased the assets, trademarks,\n\npatents, and right to the Intellivision in January of 1984 for $16.5 million\n\ndollars. The purchase was backed by financing from Tangible Industries, a\n\ndivision of Revco Drug Stores, The newly formed company was originally called\n\nIntellivision, Inc., and later renamed INTV, Inc., after Valeski negotiated\n\nall rights from Revco in November of 1984. During the next two years, the new\n\ncompany would lie dormant while plans were being made for a re-emergence.\n\nIn the fall of 1985, the INTV System III (also called the Super Pro System)\n\nappeared at Toys 'R Us, Kiddie City, and in a mail order catalog sent to\n\nowners of the original Intellivision direct from INTV. The new console\n\nwas of the same general design as the original master component, except\n\nit sported a fresh black plastic shell with brushed aluminum trim. Several\n\nnew games accompanied the release of the new system, and 1985 would register\n\nover $6 million dollars in sales worldwide, indicating that INTV Corp. had\n\nindeed revived the Intellivision. INTV continued to market games and repair\n\nservices through the mail with great success. Between 1985 and 1990 over 35\n\nnew games were released, bringing the Intellivision's game library to a total\n\nof 125 titles.\n\nMany more changes were to come during the final six years of Intellivision's\n\nuseful life. In 1987, an improved master component called the INTV System IV\n\nwas shown at the January CES, which sported detachable controllers and a timing\n\ndevice. Unfortunately, this never saw the light either. In the fall of 1988,\n\nINTV re-introduced the computer keyboard adapter through their mail order\n\ncatalog on a limited quantity basis. In 1990, INTV discontinued retail sales\n\nof thier games and equipment and sold them only through the mail channels.\n\nThe change in marketing was due to agreements with Nintendo and Sega to become\n\na software vendor for the NES, Game Boy and Genesis. In 1991, INTV sold out\n\nits stock of Intellivision games and consoles, and the company, along with the\n\nIntellivision, gradually faded into black.\n\n-----\n\n1.2 - Timeline\n\n1979 - Intellivision is test marketed\n\n1980 - Mattel Intellivision released nationally, Computer Expansion announced\n\n1982 - Computer Expansion Module scrapped due to high cost and poor response\n\n1982 - IntelliVoice released\n\n1983 - Intellivision II released\n\n1983 - Entertainment Computer System released, many periphs. announced\n\n1983 - 2600 System Changer released\n\n1983 - Intellvision III announced\n\n1983 - The videogame market begins to crash\n\n1983 - Intellivision III dropped\n\n1984 - The videogame market bottoms out\n\n1984 - Mattel sells the Intellivision rights to VP Marketing T.E.

Processor has 16\n\nbit registers, uses 16 bit RAM, and has 10 (yes, 10) bit instructions.\n\nIntellivision cartridges contain ROMs that are 10 bits wide. Ten\n\nbits are called a decle, and half that is a nickle. There were 160\n\nbytes of RAM, I think (general purpose RAM -- there is also RAM used\n\nby the graphics chip for character bitmaps and to tell what is where\n\non the screen).\n\nThe CPU was strange. For example, if you did two ROTATE LEFT instructions,\n\nfollowed by a ROTATE RIGHT BY 2 (rotates could be by one or two), you did\n\nNOT end up with the original word. The top two bits were swapped!\n\nKen Kirkby also has this to add:\n\n\"The GI CP1600 was developed as a joint venture in the early seventies\n\nbetween GI and Honeywell. One of the first commercial uses of the CP1600 was\n\nits incorporation into Honeywell's TDC2000, the first distributed control\n\nsystem, prototypes existed in late '74 I think. Honeywells then Test\n\nInstrument Division also incorporated into a Cardiac Catheterisation system\n\ncalled MEDDARS which was released for sale about 1979. The CP1600 was\n\ndefinitely a 16 bit chip.\"\n\nJohn Dullea (jxd230@psu.edu) dug this information up during a stroll at his\n\nlocal library:\n\nIn the Penn State Library I found a book called \"An Introduction to Microcomputers,\n\nVol. 2: Some Real MicroProcessors\", By Adam Osborne, Osborne & Associates, Inc.,\n\n1978. ISBN: 0-931998-15-2. Library of Congress catalogue card #: 76-374891.\n\nIt has lots of info on the CP1600/1610 CPU in the Intellivision in chapter 16\n\n(If you want a photocopy of the chapter, e-mail me).

AY-3-9504-021 ............ 28-pin\n\nIn addition, there are three 40-pin chips that have heat sinks epoxied on top.\n\nNow, you may try this, but be EXTREMELY careful (or just listen to what I\n\nfound): I carefully removed the three heat-sunk chips and looked at them; they\n\nhave designations on the bottom!\n\nSTIC ..............

CP-1610 .................. 40-pin <----- hello!\n\nHaving the CPU location and pinouts, one can use an ohmmeter to map the pins\n\nto the cartridge pins:\n\n(looking AT the cartridge, not the intellivision unit)\n\nYou probably should double-check this, but I obviously can't accept any\n\nresponsibility for any damage to your Master Component. (I'm not 100% sure\n\nabout the assignments for VCC and GND)\n\nTOP BOTTOM\n\nNC GND\n\n_____\n\nNC MSYNC\n\nNC D7\n\nGND D8\n\nGND D6\n\nGND D9\n\nNC D5\n\nGND D10\n\nGND D4\n\nGND D11\n\nGND D3\n\nGND D12\n\nGND D13\n\nGND D2\n\nNC D14\n\n*1 D1\n\n*2 D0\n\n*3 D15\n\n*3 *3\n\n*2 *2\n\n*1 *1\n\nGND VCC\n\nAll *x pins are connected; cartridges have a loop on the top row connecting\n\nthem, and the connector in the Intellivision unit connects the top row *x\n\npins to those on the bottom row.

STIC pin 8\n\nThere may be other connections to them as well; I don't know why they connect\n\nto the ROM pins. However, considering the system changer's ability to route\n\nin external video, having pins going to the STIC seems to make some sense. I\n\nsuspect that they may switch the ROM from address write mode to data read mode\n\n(like the three bus control lines on the CPU, maybe).\n\nMapping this to the ROM pinouts, you get:\n\n+-------------------+\n\nVCC ---+ 1 28 +--- STIC pin 7\n\n| |\n\nNC ---+ 2 27 +--- STIC pin 6\n\n| |\n\nNC ---+ 3 26 +--- STIC pin 8\n\n| |\n\nD15 ---+ 4 25 +--- D0\n\n| |\n\nNC ---+ 5 24 +--- D1\n\n| |\n\nD14 ---+ 6 23 +--- D2\n\n| |\n\nD13 ---+ 7 22 +--- NC\n\n| |\n\nD12 ---+ 8 21 +--- D3\n\n| |\n\nD11 ---+ 9 20 +--- D4\n\n| |\n\nD10 ---+ 10 19 +--- D5\n\n| |\n\nNC ---+ 11 18 +--- NC\n\n| |\n\nD9 ---+ 12 17 +--- D6\n\n| |\n\nD8 ---+ 13 16 +--- D7\n\n_____ | |\n\nMSYNC ---+ 14 15 +--- GND\n\n+-------------------+\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease note that the chapter mentioned above has all opcode and register info,\n\nas well as timing information for the CP1600/1600A/1610 CPUs.\n\n-----\n\n2.3 - Graphics Specs\n\n160x92 pixels, 16 colors, 8 sprites (they were called \"moving objects\"\n\nrather than sprites). I don't recall the sprite size -- I think it was\n\n16x16. Sprites could be drawn with oversize pixels (I think they could\n\nbe linearly doubled or quadrupled, but again, memory is hazy).\n\nGraphics is character based. The screen is twelve rows of twenty\n\ncharacters. Characters either come from Graphics ROM (GROM), which\n\ncontains the usual alphanumeric symbols and a bunch of other things\n\nmeant to be useful in drawing backgrounds (256 characters in all),\n\nor Graphics RAM (GRAM), which the program can use to build pictures\n\nneeded that aren't in GROM (like sprite images). GRAM can hold 64.\n\nThe predesigned sprites located in ROM were a big help in speeding up\n\ngameplay. (Now that I think about it, maybe sprites were 8x16 -- I\n\ndon't recall them taking up 4 pictures in GRAM -- but two seems\n\nreasonable).\n\nEight of the colors are designated as the primary colors. The other\n\neight are called the pastel colors.\n\nThere were two graphics modes: Foreground/Background, and Color Stack.\n\nIn F/B mode, you specify the colors for both the on and off pixels of\n\neach card (\"card\" is the term for a character on the screen). One of\n\nthese (the on pixels, I think) could use any color, but the other could\n\nonly use the primary colors.\n\nIn CS mode, you can give the chip a circular list of four colors (pastels\n\nand primaries are both allowed). For each card, you specify the ON bits\n\ncolor from any of the 16 colors, and the OFF bits color comes from the\n\nnext color on the circular list. You can also tell if the list is to\n\nadvance or not. Thus, in CS mode, you only get four colors for the OFF\n\nbits, and they have to be used in a predetermined order, but you get to\n\nuse the pastels. Most games used CS mode.\n\nI seem to recall that a sprite could be designated as either being in\n\nfront of or behind the background, which determined prority when it\n\noverlapped the ON pixels of a background image.\n\nYou could tell the graphics chip to black out the top row or the first\n\ncolumn (or both) of cards. You could also tell it to delay the display\n\nby up to the time of seven scan lines, or to delay the pixels on each\n\nscan line by up to seven pixel times. Using these two features together\n\nallows for smooth scrolling.\n\nFor example, a game that is going to scroll a lot sideways could black\n\nout the first row. Now, to scroll the background to the right by one\n\npixel, you just have to delay by one pixel time. This moves everything\n\nover. The black part is NOT delayed -- that is always displayed in the\n\nfirst 8 screen pixel locations. The net result is that you now see one\n\npixel that was previously hidden under the black strip, and one pixel on\n\nthe other side has fallen of the edge, and everything appears to have\n\nmoved over. Thus, to scroll, you only have to move the screen memory\n\nevery eigth time, when things need to be shifted a full card. There is\n\nno need for a bitblt-type operation.\n\nThe hardware detected collisions bewteen sprites and other sprites or\n\nthe background.\n\nGRAM and (I think) screen memory could only be manipulated during\n\nvertical retrace. At the end of vertical retrace, you had to tell\n\nthe chip if it should display or not. If you weren't done, you\n\ncould keep manipulating by not telling it to display, but then\n\nyou end up with a flicker. Unacceptable.\n\n-----\n\n2.4 - Operating System Specs\n\nThe operating system did several things:\n\n- It allowed the program to specify a veloc for each sprite.\n\nThe OS would deal with adjusting the sprite position registers\n\nfor you and cycling through your animation sequence.\n\n- For each pair of sprites you could specify a routine to be\n\ncalled when that pair of sprites collided. For each sprite,\n\nyou could specify a routine to be called when that sprite\n\nhit the background or the edge of the screen.\n\n- It maintained timers, and allowed you to specify routines to\n\nbe called periodically.\n\n- It dealt with the controls. You could specify routines to be\n\ncalled when the control disc was pressed or released, or when\n\nbuttons were pressed or released. It provided functions to\n\nread numbers from the keypad. The calling sequence for these\n\nwere a bit strange. When you called these, they saved the return\n\naddress, then did a return. You had to call them with nothing\n\nafter your return address on the stack, and they return to your\n\ncaller. When the number is ready, they return to after where\n\nyou called them, but as an interrupt. In generic assembly, it\n\nwould be like this (I've long since forgotten 1600!):\n\njsr foo\n\nbar:\n\n...\n\n...\n\nfoo: ;do some setup or whatever\n\njsr GetNumberFromKeypad\n\nspam: ...\n\nGetNumberFromKeypad returns to bar immediately. When the number\n\nis read, spam will be called from an interrupt handler. If you\n\ndidn't know that a routine did this, reading code could get\n\nrather confusing!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.0) Hardware Descriptions:\n\n-----\n\n3.1 - Intellivision Master Component\n\nThe original, the one the started it all. It has a brown molded plastic case\n\nwith gold trim on the top. Two controller wells are recessed in the top for\n\nhousing the two hard-wired controllers. The controllers are also brown molded\n\nplastic, with a 12-key numeric keypad, two fire buttons located on each side,\n\nand a gold disk centered in the bottom third of the controller which is used\n\nto control your on-screen persona. The power and reset switches are located\n\non the top of the unit, in the lower right hand corner:\n\n(Top View)\n\n_||_ _|_\n\nPower Cable -->|| |<-- RF Cable\n\n|| |\n\n=================================\n\n| ||\n\n| ---------------------------- ||\n\n| /\\ .... | | .... /\\ ||\n\n| \\/ .... | | .... \\/ ||\n\n| ---------------------------- ||\n\n| [ ][|] ||\n\n=================================\n\n^ ^> Power Switch\n\n|> Reset Switch\n\n-----\n\n3.2 - Sears Super Video Arcade\n\nUp until recently, if you wanted to market your product through Sears, it had\n\nto have thier name on it. Much like Atari with the Tele-Games Video Arcade,\n\nMattel created a clone that was similar yet different to the INTV I.\n\nFunctionally identical, this unit has a cream-colored case with a wood-grain\n\nfront, and removable controllers that rest in the center of the console.\n\nThe power and reset switches are circular in shape and about an inch in\n\ndiameter:\n\n(Top View)\n\n_||_ _|_\n\nPower Cable -->|| |<-- RF Cable\n\n|| |\n\n=================================\n\n| ||\n\n| ---------------------------- ||\n\n| |... |... | ||\n\n| |... |... | ||\n\n|__________| /\\ | /\\ |_/-\\_/-\\_||\n\n| | \\/ | \\/ | \\-/ \\-/ ||\n\n=================================\n\n^ ^> Power Switch\n\n|> Reset Switch\n\n-----\n\n3.3 - Radio Shack Tandyvision I\n\nYet another clone, this console has faux wood-grain (what was it with\n\nvideogames and woodgrain in the early eighties??) paneling in the place of the\n\nINTV I's gold panels. Otherwise, this unit is totally identical to the INTV I.\n\n-----\n\n3.4 - GTE / Sylvania Intellivision\n\nStill another clone, this console is identical to the original Intellivision\n\nexcept for the brand name. The box has a very detailed description of the\n\nComputer Adapter that was never released... Rumor has it that these were given\n\naway for free with the purchase of a Sylvania television.\n\n-----\n\n3.5 - Intellivoice Voice Synthesis Module\n\nThis module attaches to the cartridge port of your Intellivision, and through\n\nthe use of special voice-enhanced games, your INTV could talk. There were 5\n\ngames released to take advantage of the unit's capabilities (Space Spartans,\n\nB-17 Bomber, Tron Solar Sailor, Bomb Squad, and World Seires Major League\n\nBaseball (also requires the ECS) ). The module has a dial on the front to\n\ncontrol the voice's volume. Voice games will work without the adapter, but\n\nsince the voice was made to be an integral portion of the game, they're\n\nextremely difficult to play.\n\nUnderneath the plastic Mattel Electronics logo on the top is an expansion\n\nconnector. Everyone pop the cover off and make sure it's there? =)\n\n-----\n\n3.6 - Intellivision II\n\nIn 1982, Mattel decided that they needed to spice up the design of the\n\nIntellivision, as well as attempt to shave some costs; the Intellivision II\n\nwas the result. Some key differences include:\n\n- A much smaller footprint\n\n- Grey plastic case with a thin red stripe circling the unit\n\n- External power supply (not standard by any means)\n\n- Detachable controllers (although the fire buttons on these\n\ncontrollers are nearly impossible to use, and darn uncomfy =) )\n\n- Combination Power/Reset switch (probably the most annoying feature\n\nof all, you have to hold the switch for 5 seconds in order to turn\n\nthe unit off)\n\n- Power LED Indicator\n\n(Top View)\n\n============================\n\n| || ... || ... ||\n\n| || ... || ... ||\n\n| || ... || ... ||\n\n| ___ || ... || ... ||\n\nPower LED Ind.-->| * | | || /\\ || /\\ ||\n\n| |___| || \\/ || \\/ ||\n\n============================\n\n^> Power / Reset Switch\n\nThis unit contained a revised ROM which was necessary for the System Changer\n\n(more on that later), but also caused incompatibilities with certain Coleco\n\ngames and some Mattel games (Donkey Kong, Mouse Trap, and Carnival DEFINITELY\n\ndo not work, Chess is a maybe).\n\nThis unit also used a non-standard AC Adapter, making it near impossible to\n\nfind a replacement at your local Radio Shack. For those who are handy enough\n\nto construct their own, here are the specs:\n\nInput: 120V 60Hz 25 Watts\n\nOutput: 16.7V AC 1.0A\n\n-----\n\n3.7 - INTV System III (Model #3504)\n\nIn 1984, the vice president of marketing for Mattel Electronics bought the\n\nrights to the Intellivision and formed a company called INTV Corp. The\n\nresult of this venture was the release of the INTV III, or Super Pro System.\n\nThis redesigned unit is physically identical to the original INTV I, except\n\nthat it has a black plastic case with silver plates, and also has a Power LED\n\nindicator between the Power and Reset switches. The controllers are black\n\nwith silver discs, and the keypads were either silver with black lettering\n\nor black with silver lettering.\n\n-----\n\n3.8 - Computer Adaptor\n\nThis unit only saw a limited test marketing run of less than one thousand\n\nunits in late 1981. It was color-keyed to match the INTV I, and the entire\n\ngame console fit into the top of the unit. It sported a full-stroke 60-key\n\nkeyboard, built in cassette recorder, and brought the total memory capacity\n\nof the Intellivision to 64K. A modem expansion module was also planned.\n\nDue to it's high street price (around $700, versus an announced price of\n\n$150), the plans to market this unit nationally were shelved.\n\n-----\n\n3.9 - Entertainment Computer System\n\nSpurred on by the increasingly popular home computer market, Mattel introduced\n\nthe Entertainment Computer System along with the INTV II in 1983. This unit\n\nplugs into the cartridge port of the INTV II, and has its own cartridge slot,\n\ntwo additional controller ports, a cassette interface, and a balance dial for\n\ncontrolling the output level of the ECS's three additional voices. The unit\n\nrequires an additional power supply. Here again, Mattel used something\n\ncompletely different from the rest of the industry:\n\nInput:\n\nOutput: 10.0 VAC, 1.0 A\n\nThe ECS came pacakged with a 49-key chiclet-style keyboard, power supply, and\n\na well-written manual describing INTV BASIC. Upon returning your registration\n\ncard, you would receive \"The Step-By-Step Guide To Home Computing\", which\n\nincluded a very detailed BASIC Tutorial, and some more in-depth study of the\n\nECS's abilities. For the techies, the unit sported an additional voice chip\n\n(bringing the grand total to 6), 10K of ROM and 2K of RAM for programming\n\npurposes.\n\nThis unit comes in two flavors, the grey mentioned above, and also a dark\n\nbrown color keyed to the original Intellivision. Functionally, the units are\n\nidentical. The dark brown variety is extremely difficult to find.\n\nExpansions announced for this unit include a 16K RAM, 8K ROM expansion, a 32K\n\nRAM, 12K ROM expansion, data recorder, and a 40 column thermal printer. None\n\nof these peripherals ever made it to market.\n\n-----\n\n3.10 - Music Synthesizer\n\nThis was an add-on for the ECS, a full 49 key piano style keyboard. It has 6\n\nnote polyphony (for you non-musicians, can play 6 notes at once), and plugs\n\ninto the controller ports on the ECS via a dual 9 pin connector. Melody\n\nBlaster was the only program released by Mattel to specifically take advantage\n\nof this component.\n\nThis unit also came molded either in light gray or dark brown plastic.\n\nAlthough they are both pretty tough to find, the brown variety is extremely\n\nrare.\n\n-----\n\n3.11 - System Changer\n\nThe Atari 2600 had the biggest library of games at the time, and Mattel added\n\nthe capability of playing 2600 carts to the INTV II with this module. This\n\nunit also interfaces with the INTV II via the cartridge port. It has a\n\ncartridge port on the top of the module, Game Select and Reset keys flanking\n\nthe two difficuly and color/BW switch:\n\n(Top View)\n\n________________________\n\n| _____________ | Legend:\n\n| | _ _ | |\n\n______| |_____________| | 1 - Game Select\n\n| | 2 - Left Difficulty\n\n| <--- To INTV | 3 - Color / BW Switch\n\n|_______ ___________________ | 4 - Right Difficulty\n\n| | 1 |2|3|4| 5 | | 5 - Game Reset\n\n| |_____|_|_|_|_____| |\n\n|_______________________|\n\nThe controller ports are located on the front of the module, and any of your\n\nfavorite 2600 compatible controllers work just fine. If you don't happen to\n\nhave Atari controllers lying around, you can use the disc controller attached\n\nto the INTV II in lieu of them.\n\nIf you happened to own an original Intellivision, sending in your Master\n\nComponent and $19.95 would get you a ROM upgrade that was required for this\n\nunit to work with the older equipment.\n\n-----\n\n3.12 - Joystick Substitutes\n\nFor the masses who couldn't stand to use the Intellivision's awful disc\n\ncontrollers, there were a couple solutions:\n\n- INTV Corp. released a set of clip-on Joysticks which snapped onto\n\nthe lower half of your controller, these are of questionable quality\n\nand value:\n\n_______\n\n/ \\\n\n|-------| ________________________\n\n\\_______/ | |\n\n| | | _________ |\n\n| | | / \\ |\n\n| | (Side View) | ( (INTV) ) |\n\n| | | \\_________/ |\n\n___________| |___________ | |\n\n| _________| |_________ | |_______________________|\n\n| | ____| |____ | |\n\n| |_ ----------- _| | (Top View)\n\n|___| |___|\n\n- A couple of other companies released sticks that either glued onto\n\nthe existing discs, or replaced the disc entirely, with a shaft that\n\nscrewed into a hole drilled into the center of the replacement disc.\n\nOne of these add-ons also came with oversized fire buttons that\n\nclipped over the exisiting buttons.\n\n-----\n\n3.13 - Compro Electronics (CEI) Videoplexer\n\nTired of switching between your 8 favorite games?? Get a Videoplexer! Similar\n\nto the RomScanner for the Atari 2600, this unit would store 8 Intellivision\n\ngames and allow you to switch them on the fly via a touch panel on the front of\n\nthe unit. (Anyone ever seen one of these???)\n\n-----\n\n3.14 - PlayCable\n\nThe idea of beaming Junior videogames through Cable TV is not new; a company\n\ncalled PlayCable created an adapter for the Intellivision that plugged into\n\nthe cartridge port, and the service would have had a selection of 20 of the\n\nmost poular games available every month. Steven Roode and his brother were\n\nfortunate enough to have this service, and what follows is his description\n\nof the hardware and the service provided:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you signed up for Playcable, you were given a box which would plug into\n\nthe Intellivision's (INTV's) cartridge port. The box had the same color\n\nscheme as an INTV I, and it's dimesions were the same height and depth of\n\nthe INTV I, with the length of an INTV II. It had a power cord comming out\n\nof it. Additionally, you were given a RF box which had a coaxial in, a\n\ncoaxial out, and two RCA outs. One RCA out was connected to the INTV, and\n\none was connected to the Playcable unit. The setup looked roughly like this:\n\nCable In\n\n| |\n\n-----------\n\n| ----+ | <= RF Box\n\n-----------\n\n|_||_||_|\n\n______________| T |\n\n| V |\n\n| |\n\n=================================================\n\n| || |\n\n| ---------------------------- || ------------- |\n\n| /\\ .... | | .... /\\ || |\n\n| \\/ .... | | .... \\/ || |\n\n| ---------------------------- || ------------- |\n\n| [ ][|] || |\n\n=================================================\n\nIntellivision Playcable Box\n\nFor about $4.95 a month, the cable company would transmit 20 games (Although\n\nfor the first few months, there were only 15 games). When you turned on the\n\nINTV, a sort of 'boot screen' would come up and you would hear a sound that\n\nsort of sounded like a clock ticking. After a couple of seconds, you would\n\nhear 4 long beeps and the Playcable title screen would pop up. There would\n\nbe one of four different songs in the background (I know that one was the\n\nvictory song in checkers, one was The Entertainer, one was Music Box Dancer,\n\nand I forget the other one). Each screen listed 5 games (I think, it may\n\nhave been 4), and you could cycle through the games lists by pressing the\n\ndisc. When you found the game that you wanted, you would press the number\n\nnext to it, and press enter. A title screen of the game would pop up, and\n\nagain you would hear ticking. After a couple of seconds, you would hear\n\nthe same 4 long beeps and the game would be ready to play.\n\nThe following are excerpts from a Playcable-specific game manual describing\n\nthe game loading process:\n\n==========================================================================\n\nHOW TO SELECT YOUR FAVORITE GAME FROM PLAYCABLE:\n\n- Set the PlayCable TV/Game switch to GAME.\n\n- Turn on your television and turn to Channel 3 or 4. (The same setting as\n\nthe switch on the bottom of the Mattel Electronics Master Component.)\n\n- Turn on the Master Component; push the RESET button.\n\n- The screen will read, \"PLAYCABLE CATALOG.\" The screen will then change\n\nto: \"PLAYCABLE PRESENTS INTELLIVISION. PUSH DISC.\"\n\n- Push the directional disc (the big, round button on either hand control)\n\nto see each page of the catalog. The series will start again automatically\n\nas you keep pushing the disc.\n\n- To call up a game, find the page on which the game appears. Press the\n\nnumber of the game on your keypad, then press ENTER. Wait about 10 seconds.\n\nWhen the four rectangles in the upper left hand corner of your screen turn\n\nwhite, your game is ready.\n\n- Push the disc again and the game will appear.\n\n- To select a new game, push RESET. The catalog will re-appear.\n\n==========================================================================\n\nOne of the neater aspects of Playcable was that they would rotate out\n\nabout half of the games every month. When they did, you would get\n\ninstruction books and overlays for each new game in the mail (and all\n\nof the overlays were attached with perferations; so you would have to\n\nsort of tear them apart).\n\nPlaycable tended to have some pretty decent games on it. You would\n\nalways have a couple of the 'classics' every month (i.e., I don't\n\nthink Baseball and Astrosmash ever came off!), and you would get some\n\npretty recent games as well. Once in a while they were slow in\n\nchanging the games. They were supposed to be rotated out on the 1st of\n\neach month. Believe me, my brother and I would fake sick to stay home\n\nfrom school sometimes on the 1st! If by noon they weren't changed, we\n\nwould call the cable company and by the end of the day they were\n\nupdated (One other neat little sidenote: When they changed the games\n\nout, the system would still be up. First, all game choices would\n\ndissapear. Then, two by two, new games would pop up. You could\n\nactually see them appear!)\n\nWe had Playcable for about two years (I think 81-82), and our cable\n\ncompany was big into promoting it. They had INTV playathons at some of\n\nthe local malls, giving away free INTVs to high scorers in certain\n\ngames. During one promotional weekend, the cable company showed\n\nnothing but people playing INTV and the announcers commenting on how\n\nrealistic the gameplay was. I think we even have one Playcable T-shirt\n\nlaying around somewhere!\n\nFinally though, our cable company stopped carrying Playcable, and\n\nunfortunately, we had to surrender the box. I would liked to have kept\n\nit to see how it worked. All in all, our family has a lot of fond\n\nmemories of Playcable... I think it helped to enhance the uniqueness\n\nand mystery of the Intellivision.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.0) Cartridge Listing:\n\n4.1 - Released Titles\n\nThis list contains information from VGR'S Giant List of Intellivision games,\n\nSean Kelly's list, Paul Thurrott's List, and some information I have gleaned\n\nfrom personal experience.\n\nManufacturer's Key:\n\nMA = Mattel IM = Imagic PB = Parker Bros.

You lose 1 man,\n\nbut gain it back with the easier play of the 1st building.\n\nBump 'n' Jump -\n\n- There is a secret road, just jump off to the side and land out\n\nof view.\n\nSword & Serpents:\n\n- On the 4th level, don't read the nearby scroll, it's a trap!\n\n- To 'win' you either have the wizard do a bunch of destroy_walls\n\nspells to get through the back or top or bottom side of the big room\n\nthat the dragon is in, OR in one player mode, you have to walk through\n\nthe corners of the successive walls (in the back of the big room). If\n\nyou don't know what I'm talking about, practice on the lower levels by\n\nwalking diagonally, into the outside of the corner of a wall. Once\n\ninside the dragon's lair, walk around and pick up a few neat goodies\n\nand be careful not to get killed by black knights and evil wizards (was\n\nthere anything else that could kill you?) If you walk around enough,\n\nthe programmer's initials will appear.\n\nTruckin': Another programmer's initials trick, anyone?\n\nTriple Action:\n\nChoose the tanks game and at the beginning of the screen take the red\n\ntank and drive up to the blue tank and face it head on (about an inch\n\naway). Now take the Blue Tank and do a 180 turn (Don't move the tank\n\nforward or backward at all). The blue tank should be facing the left\n\nside of your T.V. with the red tank looking at it's behind. Now move\n\nthe red tank forward and into the blue tank as far as it will go and\n\nstop there. Now using the disc, turn the red tank to the 1:00 position,\n\nwhich should look like this:\n\n/ Now the idea here is to be partly on\n\n__/_ the blue tank while facing away from it\n\nXXXXXXXX / / and hitting the SIDE Button really quick\n\n------IIII / - / \"Not the FIRE Button but the 'move forward\n\nXXXXXXXX __/ quick'button.\n\nThe Tank (red) should, with a ghostly floating effect, sail off to the\n\nright of the screen. It will also go through the barriers and eventually\n\noff the screen. From then on give the blue tank control to a friend and\n\nyou'll be conveniently hidden off screen while he tries to find you.\n\nTry practicing this one awhile as it takes a bit of tweaking to get it\n\njust right. After you do get it, try playing with the bullets, shooting\n\nthem off screen and inbetween walls and barriers. Heck, see if you and a\n\nfriend can get both tanks to sail off at the same time. It might work too.\n\nGeneral INTV games:\n\nSeveral INTV releases will display the game's credits if you press 0 on\n\nthe title screen:\n\nBody Slam Super Pro Wrestling\n\nChip Shot Super Pro Golf\n\nSuper Pro Football\n\nHover Force\n\nSlam Dunk Super Pro Basketball\n\nTower of Doom\n\nSeveral others simply display the credits if you leave the title screen\n\nup long enough:\n\nDiner\n\nMonster Truck Rally (Stadium Mud Buggies)\n\nMountain Madness Super Pro Skiing\n\nSuper Pro Decathlon\n\nSlap Shot Super Pro Hockey\n\nThey didn't document the \"press 0\" trick, but they didn't want to make it\n\nhard to find. What you *aren't* supposed to find is the Chip Shot\n\nprogrammer's secret message to his family: press 23 (2 and 3 at the same\n\ntime) on the left hand controller and 26 on the right hand controller and\n\npress reset.\n\n------\n\n4.5.2 - Information regarding Unreleased Titles & Hardware\n\nMost of the information provided here was posted to the general net populace\n\ncourtesy of the Blue Sky Rangers and Keith Robinson (makingit@netcom.com)...\n\nSpeed Freak (INTV??):\n\nNeither Mattel nor INTV did this as an Intellivision game (INTV may have\n\nincluded this in a list of \"upcoming\" games, but no work was ever done on\n\nit). Mattel did do a handheld version.\n\nSpace Shuttle:\n\nMattel did a Space Shuttle Intellivoice game that was unfinished when\n\nwe were shut down in Jan '84. Only the prototypes exist. Activision also\n\ndid a Space Shuttle game, but I don't know the status of their\n\nIntellivision version of it.\n\nDig Dug (Atarisoft??):\n\nDig Dug was programmed at Atari, but it was still being debugged at the\n\ntime they discontinued releasing Intellivision games. It was debugged and\n\nreleased first through INTV. (#9005)\n\nPole Position (Atarisoft??):\n\nProduced for and released by INTV. (#9004)\n\nDefender (INTV Corp??):\n\nINTV did sell it, but it was first released by Atarisoft.\n\nFrogger (INTV Corp??):\n\nAgain, INTV sold it, but it was a Parker Brothers release.\n\nRocky & Bullwinkle:\n\nAn unreleased Mattel game, only prototypes exist.\n\nSuper NASL Soccer (ICA game):\n\nIn the works at Mattel for the Entertainment Computer System when we were\n\nclosed; the game was completed for INTV and released as a regular\n\nIntellivision cartridge under the name World Cup Soccer.\n\nPrototype Intellivoice (white / Matching Intellivision II):\n\nIt was a carved, painted block of wood for the photos. No working prototypes\n\nwere made.\n\n-----\n\n4.6 - Information regarding Label & Box Variations\n\nThere are 4 main \"distributors\" of the Intellivision games though we tend\n\nto call them manufacturers. For instance, Atarisoft manufactured the INTV\n\nversions of the Atari titles as well as the Atarisoft release versions.\n\nThe 4 \"distributors\" are:\n\n- Mattel, the original \"manufacturer\" of the Intellivision.\n\n- INTV, the company that was formed and bought out the Mattel\n\nrights to Intellivision products.\n\n- Sears/Telegames which distributed Intellivision games and\n\nsystems under their own names.\n\n- Telegames, which is still in business and which owns many of\n\nthe rights (if not all) to the Intellivision games. Their games\n\nare most likely manufactured by CBS Electronics in Italy, though\n\nnot all are.\n\nThe games originally manufactured to be distributed by Matell have a ©\n\nMI or © MEI on the label. These are the only types of labels known to\n\nhave been sold by Mattel.\n\nSealed INTV boxes (yes INTV boxes were different, though, like the\n\ncartridges, they also used the leftover Mattel boxes) have been found\n\n(frequently) with 3 types of labeled games in them:\n\n1. © II, white label\n\n2. © MI\n\n3. © MEI\n\n4. no copyright or country of origin, colored label\n\n5. no copyright but with a country of origin, colored label\n\n6. no copyright or country of origin, white label\n\nThe © II is the closest thing to being a \"regular\" INTV release, but not\n\ncomplete proof.\n\nSears/Telegames released games in specially designed boxes which are quite\n\neasy to identify. They are a dark redish brown and clearly say \"Sears/\n\nTelegames\". The labels on the games sold by Sears/Telegames are of several\n\ntypes:\n\n1. no copyright or country of origin, colored label\n\n2. no copyright but with a country of origin, colored label\n\n3. © MI\n\n4. © MEI\n\nTelegame releases are in a variety of boxes, most commonly in a box clearly\n\nidentified as \"Telegames\". They can still be purchased from Telegames, UK.\n\nThere are a variety of labels on these games, but the most common, and the\n\nclosest to \"official\" Telegame releases are a white label with no copyright\n\nor country of origin on them. The following labels have been found in\n\nTelegames boxes.\n\n1. no copyright or country of origin, white label\n\n2. All of the above varieties.\n\nThere may be a way of telling the White Label, no ©, no country of origin\n\nINTV games from the White Label Telegames in some cases as there tends to be\n\ntwo distinct styles and sizes of lettering used.\n\nThe bottom line is:\n\nYou can't tell who sold or manufactured the games themselves in most cases\n\nexcept:\n\n- If it is © MI or © MEI it was manufactured for Mattel\n\n- If it is © II it was manufactured for INTV\n\nThe boxes were manufactured for the company (one of the 4 above) and can be\n\nidentified as they are clearly marked. They were not necessarily sold by the\n\nsame companies.\n\n-----\n\nKeith Robinson had this to add on the subject of labels and boxes:\n\n: Q: I recently came across a pile of intellivision carts with white labels\n\n: only and was wondering if anybody out there knew the scoop on them.\n\n: Are they any rarer than the colored versions? The manuals also are\n\n: in B&W only, not like the ones I already have. Any help would be much\n\n: appreciated. Thanks!!\n\nPretty cheesy, huh? I was in charge of printing those; Terry Valeski\n\ncontracted with me to provide all the packaging for the INTV Corporation\n\nreleases. He wanted costs as low as possible, so overlays were eliminated\n\nwhere possible (Mattel's policy was that every game had to have overlays,\n\neven if they weren't really needed, such as for Pinball; Valeski got rid\n\nof them), manuals became black & white (folded, not stapled) and labels\n\nwere printed on whatever stock my printer had leftover and would give me a\n\nprice break on. That's why you'll find different size labels on different\n\ncopies of the same game.\n\nOf course, INTV didn't invent this cost cutting. Mattel's Intellivision\n\npackaging went downhill quickly, too. The original boxes opened like a\n\nbook and had a plastic tray the cartridge fit into. Manuals were all full\n\ncolor. The plastic tray was the first thing to go, then the manuals\n\nwent to two-color, then the boxes simply became boxes (some games, like\n\nBurgerTime, were released in both versions of the boxes).\n\nAt INTV, we printed the boxes on an even cheaper grade of cardboard, but\n\nat least Valeski wanted them to be colorful. I designed most of them with\n\nan art budget of about $800 per box. A painter named Steve Huston did the\n\nSuper Pro sports covers and I did most of the cartoony covers (Thin Ice,\n\nLearning Fun I & II). Other artists and photographers did individual\n\ntitles. I had Joe Ferreira, who did the graphics for Hover Force, do the\n\nartwork for the box. And if the cover art for Thunder Castle looks more\n\nthreatening than the cute graphics in the game, it's because that artwork\n\nhad been commissioned by Mattel for the Tower of Doom cartridge. Valeski\n\nhad it used for Thunder Castle since that game was already completed when\n\nhe bought the Intellivision rights; Tower of Doom was incomplete. He had\n\nTower of Doom finished later and I had to come up with new art for its\n\nbox.\n\n(By the way, look for the number 47 on the INTV boxes; that number is how\n\nPomona College alumni sort of say \"hello\" to each other. Dave Warhol, the\n\nPomona alum who produced these games, asked me to slip a 47 into the art\n\nwhenever possible. Trivia: another Pomona Alum got onto the staff of Star\n\nTrek, which is why the number 47 pops up in most episodes of Next\n\nGeneration and Voyager, and TWICE in the movie Generations.)\n\nSorry that I can't answer your real question though, namely which labels\n\nare worth more. That's a question for the collectors. But remembering how\n\nquickly some of this stuff was slapped together, it amuses me today to\n\nhear people pondering their value.\n\n..as well as this:\n\n: Q: The boxes do not open like the coloured ones right? These games were\n\n: reproduced by the INTV corporation after they took over from Mattel\n\nMattel had already switched from the book-cover boxes to standard boxes\n\nby the time INTV took over. INTV used up Mattel stock, then made up new\n\nbatches of the most popular games. In these cases, the INTV boxes are\n\nidentical to the Mattel boxes (printed from the same negatives) except\n\nthe Mattel Electronics name is deleted and the INTV name and address is\n\nadded on the back. Major League Baseball also underwent a name change to\n\nBig League Baseball, since the Major League trademark either expired or\n\nwasn't transferable.\n\nAll of the INTV games were released in full-color standard boxes, except\n\nfor a brief period where they tried to get away with no boxes -- sending\n\nout mail orders with the cartridge and instructions simply sealed in a\n\nplastic bag. Consumers complained -- loudly -- and boxes were quickly\n\nreinstated.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.0) Vaporware, Trivia, and Miscellanea:\n\n-----\n\n5.1 - Intellivision III\n\nAtari wasn't the only company with plans to introduce a \"next generation\"\n\nvideo game system; Mattel spoke of it's soon-to-be released Intellivision\n\nIII for well over a year before the idea was dumped. Here are some of the\n\nspecifications for this unit:\n\n- Built-in Intellivoice\n\n- 320 x 190 resolution\n\n- Unlimited colors\n\n- Onscreen sprites move at twice the speed of the original Intellivision\n\n- Six channel sound with RCA outputs\n\n- Remote controlled joysticks\n\n- Four controller ports\n\n- Plays original Intellivision titles as well as Aquarius titles\n\n- 12k ROM - 10k RAM\n\n- Able to manipulate 64 sprites onscreen at once\n\n- 6-8 titles announced including Air Ace - a flight simulator\n\n- Scrapped for fears of not being able to introduce it before ColecoVision\n\nand the Atari 5200 had too strong a grip on the \"next generation\" market.\n\n- Projected price : $300\n\nPlease note that this unit is COMPLETELY different from the INTV III which\n\nwas later released by INTV Corp in 1986.\n\n-----\n\n5.2 - INTV Corp. Games\n\nINTV enhanced many of the early Mattel titles by adding new features and\n\nmaking them a 1 or 2 player game by adding a computer opponent. Below is a\n\nlist of the original and enhanced cartridges:\n\nORIGINAL MATTEL CARTRIDGE ---> ENHANCED INTV CARTRIDGE\n\nPGA Golf (Golf) Chip Shot Super Pro Golf\n\nMath Fun Learning Fun I\n\nMajor League Baseball (Baseball) World Champioship Baseball\n\nNASL Soccer (Soccer) World Cup Soccer\n\nNBA Basketball (Basketball) Slam Dunk Super Pro Basketball\n\nNFL Football (Football) Super Pro Football\n\nNHL Hockey (Hockey) Slap Shot Super Pro Hockey\n\nTennis Championship Tennis\n\nUS Ski Team Skiing (Skiing) Mountain Madness Super Pro Skiing\n\nWord Fun Learning Fun II\n\nAPBA Backgammon (Backgammon) -\\\n\nCheckers (Draughts) > Triple Challenge\n\nChess -/\n\n-----\n\n5.3 - Trivia and Fun Facts\n\nHave you ever wondered...\n\n- ...what would happen if you plugged two Intellivoices together and then\n\nplugged in an Intellivoice game?? Grag Chance did, and the result goes\n\nsomething like this:\n\n\"Someone had asked about daisy-chaining two Intellivoices\n\ntogether, i.e. plug one into the other, and then a speech cart\n\ninto the 2nd one. Ok, I did this with Space Spartans. The 2nd\n\nspeech synthesizer kind of cancelled stuff out! It said,\n\n\"Welcome to <bleeeeehahah>\" and then there wasn't any voice during\n\nthe game. So that's the answer. It doesn't quite work.\"\n\n- ...what would happen if you tryed \"frying\" your Intellivision??\n\nThe author wasn't brave enough to try this out on one of his own\n\nmachines, but Matthew Long relates this childhood memory:\n\n\"I did something like it in the early years. I was playing Star\n\nStrike. I reset the machine. I then pulled out the cartridge.\n\nThe screen began flashing through the character ROM. Was really\n\nneat when I was 12!\"\n\n- ...who that strange guy in all of those old Intellivision ads was?\n\nThat was George Plimpton, ex-athlete and the Intellivision's\n\npaid spokesperson between 1980 and 1983. During 1982, Mattel\n\nspent in excess of $50 million so that Mr. Plimpton could lampoon\n\nthe \"unrealistic\" features of the Atari 2600... Little did Mattel\n\nknow that Coleco would burst their proverbial bubble with the\n\nintroduction of the Colecovision in June of '82.\n\n- ...how Mattel produced a large portion of their game library?\n\nMany of the original Intellivision games were programmed by college\n\nstudents as part of their computer programming classes. Cheap labor?\n\n- ...what would happen if you plugged your 2600 System Changer into an\n\nun-modified Intellivision I?\n\nAn unmodified Master Component (unmodified meaning sans ROM upgrade),\n\nwhen turned on with this unit plugged in, reads \"M-Network\" on the\n\ntitle screen. You can hear all the sounds from the 2600 game you have\n\ninserted, but no video is displayed, other than this title screen.\n\nEver try playing Blind Combat?\n\n- ...the best way to store your boxed Intellivision games?? Shane Shaffer has\n\na great suggestion:\n\n\"For your boxed games (unopened), try the Multi-Purpose Storage Chest\n\nfrom Metro Corrugated and Packaging Corporation. Style No. 20000 has\n\nODs of 21\" x 12 1/4\" x 8 1/4\", and fits 2 rows of boxed video games\n\nperfectly. I forget how many fit in each box, but the height is just\n\nbig enough, and the width is perfect. I store my 2600, 5200, 7800,\n\nand Intellivision boxes in it, and others of the same size will also\n\nfit. It comes in 3 colors, Blue, Green, or Red. The fit is absolutely\n\nperfect for your boxed games.\"\n\n-...what the heck INTV stands for??\n\nCommon misconception: INTV is NOT an abbreviation for Intellivison\n\nas many people seem to think. INTV is the name of the company that\n\nbought the rights to the system and all it's games from Mattel when\n\nthey decided to leave the market in late 1984. Mattel NEVER referred\n\nto it's system as INTV.\n\n-...why your Intellivision is prone to overheating??\n\nThe chipset which provided the guts of the Intellivision, manufactured\n\nby General Instruments, was extremely failure-prone. During the\n\ninitial production runs, there were sometimes failure rates as high\n\nas 50%!!\n\n-...what the most popular Intellivision game was?\n\nMajor League Baseball was an instant \"classic\" and one of the most\n\npopular games for the system. The only \"problem\" with this and many\n\nother Intellivision games was that they were for 2-players only.\n\n-...just how many positions the Intellivision controller can detect?\n\nYes, it is 16 positions!! This control disc was \"revolutionary\" for\n\nit's time, allowing for greater control with sports titles, but is also\n\none of the reasons Intellivision never did catch up to the Atari 2600.\n\n-...if INTV Corp. produced NES titles?\n\nYes, as William Howald found out when he posted this question, answered\n\nswiftly by our friend Keith Robinson:\n\n: I just found this...I had no idea that INTV made games for the\n\nnintendo!!! How rare is this?\n\nWell, we can't tell you how rare it is, but we can tell you its history:\n\nIn 1989, INTV planned to move into NES production and distribution so they\n\ncommissioned Realtime Associates (who developed most of the original\n\nINTV games) to produce both an Intellivision and NES version of \"Monster\n\nTruck Rally.\"\n\nWhen the game was finished, though, INTV had run out of money and credit\n\nto manufacture cartridges, so they sold all rights to the NES version to\n\nanother company, who finally distributed it in 1990 or 91. So as to give\n\nthat company an \"exclusive\" on the title, INTV changed the Intellivision\n\nversion to \"Stadium Mud Buggies.\"\n\n\"Monster Truck Rally\" was the only NES title done by INTV. Since INTV\n\nturned around and sold the game to another company before securing the\n\nrights from Realtime Associates (i.e. paying them), litigation ensued and\n\nthe INTV/Realtime relationship fell apart. INTV released no more product\n\nafter \"Stadium Mud Buggies\" (and \"Spiker, Super Pro Volleyball,\" released\n\nat the same time). INTV filed for bankruptcy in 1991.\n\nRealtime Associates, however, is doing great. They've gone on to produce\n\nmany NES, SNES, Sega, and GameBoy titles. One of their current hits is\n\n\"Bug\" for Saturn.\n\n-...if there were 2 or more different versions of the Intellivision II??\n\nGalen Komatsu (gkomatsu@hawaii.edu) wondered this, and here are his thoughts\n\non the matter:\n\n\"Just noticed differences between the two Intellivision II units I have.\n\nWe'll call one Ernie and the other Bert.\n\nOn the front nameplate, Ernie has a more bolder looking black surface,\n\nBert is a bit dulled looking, also Bert has the ® symbol after\n\n'Intellivision' and 'Mattel Electronics'.\n\nErnie has a red stripe around the perimiter of the unit, Bert, none.\n\nErnie's casing has square corners, Bert's corners are more rounded.\n\nThe button squares on Ernie have a matte finish while Bert's squares have\n\na more \"glossy\" finish though the areas surrounding the buttons are matte.\n\nLooking at the underside labels, the bright orange \"IMPORTANT!\" has\n\n\"2609-0090-G1\" in the upper corner, Bert has \"2609-0090\" ...both labels\n\nmention elegibility for FREE CARTRIDGE if the unit requires servicing. =^)\n\nOn the second label, Ernie's looks like:\n\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n\n| MATTEL ELECTRONICS ® Hobby Equipment |\n\n| INTELLIVISION ® II [uL LOGO] |\n\n| Model No. 5872 104Z |\n\n| FCC ID: BSU9RD5872 |\n\n| _______________________________ |\n\n||CAUTION: This is not a toy and | Input Power: |\n\n||is intended for use by or under| 16.2VAC |\n\n||the supervision of adults. | 60HZ |\n\n||_______________________________| 12.8WATTS |\n\n| |\n\n| Serial No. P3732189 |\n\n| MANUFACTURED IN HONG KONG |\n\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n\nwhereas Bert's is just:\n\n+---------------------------+\n\n| MATTEL ELECTRONICS ® |\n\n| INTELLIVISION ® II |\n\n| |\n\n| Model No. 5872 |\n\n| FCC ID: BSU 9RD5872 |\n\n| MANUFACTURED IN HONG KONG |\n\n| |\n\n| Serial No. P20176594 |\n\n+---------------------------+\n\nI haven't cracked Bert open yet so I don't know if there's any internal\n\ndifferences but both refuse to run early Coleco games.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.0) Electronic Resources, Books and Magazines:\n\n6.1 - Internet and BBS Resources\n\nWorld Wide Web pages:\n\n- Blue Sky Rangers Website\n\nhttp://www.webcom.com/~makingit/bluesky/\n\nIf anything could be considered an \"official\" source of information\n\non the Intellivision, this is as close as it comes.

This means either number (e.g. 1-20) or volume and issue\n\nnumber (e.g. v1n1-v2n8). If only issue numbers are used, this usually\n\nmeans that the entire run of the periodical is considered \"volume 1.\"\n\nIn such cases, if the periodical were to be cancelled and restarted,\n\nthat would usually be considered \"volume 2.\" Other publishers consider\n\neach year the periodical is published to be a separate volume.\n\n------------------------------\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\nFormats (refers to the size and binding, not the content):\n\nCOL Coloring book\n\nCOM Comic book\n\nGN Graphic Novel (like a MAG with square binding; upscale COM)\n\nHC Hard cover (usually larger than a PB and smaller than a TPB)\n\nMAG Magazine\n\nNEWS Newsletter\n\nPAM Pamphlet (approx.

There WILL come a time when they will fail.\n\nFortunately, there are some simple steps short of totally disaasembling\n\nthe main console you can take to fix controllers.\n\n\"Inside the controller is a plastic sheet with a circuit painted (or silk-\n\nscreened) on it. This is call the Membrane Printed Circuit Board, or MPCB\n\nfor short. Often, pieces of the circuit chip off and cause the controller\n\nto short out. This can be repaired by opening the controller and cleaning\n\nout the MPCB with a soft cloth\"\n\n\"To gain access to the MPCB, loosen and remove the four small screws on the\n\nback of the controller. With the controller facing up, lift off the top\n\ncover. Remove the round control button and the spring beneath it. There\n\nshould also be a white plastic spacer, sandwiched between two sections of\n\nthe MPCB directly beneath the spring (Note its position. It must be placed\n\nback between these two sections when you put the controller back together).\"\n\n\"Slide out the black side buttons (When reassembling the controller, these\n\nare useful in holding down the MPCB, which tends to pop out). Remove the\n\ngold numeric pad and the clear sheet (static shield) beneath it.\"\n\n\"Remove the MPCB. Visually inspect it to see if it's still in good\n\ncondition. Hold it up to the light; if you see any holes or breaks in it,\n\nit should be replaced.\"\n\nTo reassemble the hand controller, follow the above instructions in reverse\n\norder. \"Note that the MPCB, static shield, and numeric pad have two small\n\nholes in each of them. These holes interlock with the two pins protruding\n\nfrom the bottom cover of the hand controller, making it easier to align and\n\nadjust the MPCB into its proper position.\"\n\nIf your MPCB's require replacement, a great source of spare parts are those\n\ntotally trashed, $2 INTV consoles you pass up at the flea market. Not only\n\nare the hand controllers usually in working order, but you get a whole slew\n\nof other spare parts, such as logic boards, transformer assemblies, power\n\nsupplies and switches.\n\n(If anyone knows of a source for new spare parts, please let me know so I\n\ncan include the information in the FAQ.)\n\n-----\n\n7.2 - Cartridge Problems\n\nHelp!! I've turned on my console and all I get is a black screen!! What do\n\nI do??\n\nFirst off, follow the teachings of one of my favorite sci-fi authors,\n\nDouglas Adams: \"Don't Panic!\"\n\nSecondly, ensure that the cartridge is properly inserted. Not inserting the\n\ncartridge far enough, or even inserting the cartridge too far can cause the\n\nconsole not the read the game.\n\nDirty contacts on the cartridge itself may also cause a problem; use a\n\ncotton swab and some denatured alcohol to remove any corrosion from the\n\ngold contacts (the swabs used for cleaning VCR heads work best, as they are\n\nlint-free). I STRONGLY recommend against using a pencil eraser, as is so\n\npopular in many PC repair circles. Not only does the rubber build up a\n\nstatic charge in the cart, potentially damaging the ROM's, it also removes\n\nsome of the gold plating on the PC board. Too many treatments of this\n\nmanner could result in a useless game.\n\nIf you know the problem is not with the cart, all is not lost. If you're\n\nhandy with a volt-ohm meter, you can usually pinpoint the problem to one\n\nof the major components inside the console.\n\n-----\n\n7.3 - Console Disassembly\n\nFor those of you who have seen the inside of an Intellivision before,\n\nskip to the next section. What follows is a basic description of all of\n\nthe Intellivision's major components.\n\nThe system is comprised of four major components. \"First is the transformer\n\nassembly. The assembly itself is made up of smaller component; the AC\n\nPower Cord, the ON/OFF switch, and a small plastic connector.\"\n\n\"The next major component is the power supply board. It receives AC power\n\nfrom the transformer assembly, and transforms it into several different\n\nDC values. Not only does it convert the voltages, but it also stabilizes\n\nthem for the logic board.\"\n\nThe third set of components are the hand controllers.\n\n\"The final unit is called the logic board. This board is the brains of\n\nthe Intellivision.\"\n\nOkay, so with phillips screwdriver in hand, you're ready to rip apart\n\nyour Intellivision. First off, as with any electronic repair work, be\n\nsure that your work area is free of static electricty. I personally\n\nuse a wrist grounding strap clipped to some metal portion of your work\n\narea.\n\n\"Unplug the unit from the wall and from the television. Remove any\n\ncartridge from the machine. Turn the power switch to the ON position to\n\ndrain any stored up voltage. Place a soft cloth on your work area. Turn\n\nthe console upside down and place it on the cloth. Using a phillips\n\nscrewdriver (some units may require a nutdriver), remove the six cover\n\nretaining screws.\"\n\n\"Turn the unit back over and gently lift off the top cover. The small\n\nbrown cover for the ON/OFF switch will come off at this point. Weave\n\nthe hand controllers through the holes in the top cover.\"\n\n\"The insides of the Intellivision are now exposed. You should be able to\n\nidentify he four major component groups. There is a brown plastic plate\n\ncovering and securing the logic board, transformer and power supply board.\n\nRemove the six screws holding down the plate, and place them aside.\"\n\nBe CERTAIN to see how the controllers are placed in this plastic plate,\n\nas they must be replaced in the exact same fashion in order for the top\n\ncover to fit securely.\n\n-----\n\n7.4 - General Troubleshooting\n\nSome of the procedures listed here will require the use of a volt-ohm\n\nmeter. All of this material has been taken from the aforementioned\n\nreference.\n\nProblem: When you turn the game on the screen clears, title comes on,\n\nbut game will not play when hand controllers are pushed.\n\nRepair: This normally indicates that on or both of the MPCBs must be\n\ncleaned or replaced. Sometime you can open up the hand controller,\n\nclean it off, put it back together and it will work. (see 7.1 for info.)\n\nIf you have cleaned or replaced both MPCBs and the problem still exists,\n\nthen you may need a couple of new hand controller cables or a new logic\n\nboard.\n\nProblem: When you turn the game on, the screen clears (turns dark), but\n\ngame title does not appear on the screen.\n\nRepair: With the power switch in the OFF position, take the cover off\n\nthe unit. Unplug the transformer assembly from the power supply board.\n\nPlace the power switch in the ON position. Using your VOM, test the\n\nfollowing voltages:\n\n- The first readings you'll need to take are on the plastic\n\nconnector of the transformer assembly. They are AC voltage\n\nreadings. If the voltages do not read as follows, then replace\n\nthe transformer assembly, it cannot be repaired.\n\n________\n\nYellow Lead --> ------| | |\n\nBlue Lead --> ------| | |\n\nGreen/Yellow Lead --> ------| | |\n\nGreen Lead --> ------| | |\n\nGreen Lead --> ------|_|_____|\n\nYellow Lead to Blue Lead - 18 VAC\n\nGreen/Yellow lead to any Green - 9.25 VAC\n\nGreen Lead to Green Lead - 18.5 VAC\n\n- Turn the unit off. Reconnect the transformer assembly to the\n\npower supply board.\n\n- Turn the unit ON. The next set of voltages are DC voltages and\n\nshould be read from the other end of the power supply board. They\n\ncan be taken right off the cables leading to the logic board.\n\nThere are two sets of leads; a small two prong lead near the top of\n\nthe board, and a flat five prong lead near the bottom right corner.\n\nPlace the black clip of your volt-ohm meter on the lead from the two\n\nprong clip farthest from you (if looking down, the is the lead\n\nclosest to the upper right hand corner). Place the other lead of\n\nyour meter into the holes for the 5 prong lead each in turn, and\n\nnote the voltages. They should read as follows:\n\n_______\n\n+ 5 VDC --> | |_| |\n\n+ 12 VDC --> | |_| |\n\n+ 16 VDC --> | |_| |\n\n+ 0 VDC --> | |_| |\n\n- 2 VDC --> |_|_|_|\n\nIf any of the voltages are not present, the power supply board should be\n\nreplaced. If you want to attempt to repair the board, most of the problems\n\nare associated with the two voltage regulators, one being a 7805 and the\n\nother being a 7812, or the two larger capacitors.\n\n-----\n\n7.5 - Pinouts for INTV Controller\n\nThe pinouts and information listed below are courtesy of Steve Roode, who\n\nin a fit of boredom decided to find out what happened when he pushed the\n\n5 key on his Intellivision keypad...\n\nIn trying to build the ultimate Intellivision Controller, I thought that\n\nthe hard part would be trying to figure out all of the pin assigment\n\ncombinations for all of the buttons on the controller. It turns out I was\n\nwrong! That was the easy part... The hard part is finding components to\n\nmake the controller with! I went to a couple of stores to look for a rugged,\n\nphone style type keypad, nice metal stick, and a couple of rugged arcade\n\nstyle fire buttons. Couldn't find any of them!\n\nOh well.... Maybe you can! The following will describe all of the pinouts\n\ncombinations for all of the buttons on an Intellivision Controller (NOTE:\n\nI only spent time to figure 8 directions out on the disc. I figured it\n\nwould be almost impossible to find a 16 direction joystick, and most games\n\ndon't require that many directions anyway).\n\nDISCLAIMER!!!!!\n\n=================================================================\n\nHey, I'm just an average guy... I'm only doing this to help people on their\n\nway to building an Intellivision Controller that won't drive you nuts. I WILL\n\nNOT accept any responsibility for what these instructions will do to your\n\nIntellivision. I've tried it on mine, and it works fine. But please don't\n\nblame me for ANY problems these plans may cause. Experiment at your own risk!\n\n==================================================================\n\nOK, now that that's out of the way... Down to business!\n\nI used a Sears Intellivision Controller since I had an extra one and it was\n\nremovable from the system. Remove the screws on the back of the controller\n\nand open it up. Next, remove the disc, the side buttons and keypad. What\n\nyou should see in the controller is a terminal where the cable comes into\n\nthe unit. It should look something like this (The numbers aren't really\n\nthere; they are my own numbering system):\n\n---------------\n\n1 | ----- |\n\n| ----- | 6\n\n2 | ----- |\n\n| ----- | 7\n\n3 | ----- |\n\n| ----- | 8\n\n4 | ----- |\n\n| ----- | 9\n\n5 | ----- |\n\n---------------\n\nEach pin on the terminal connects to a wire which connects into the\n\nIntellivision. The numbers DO NOT correspond to the connector pin numbers;\n\nThey are my own numbering scheme. However, with a little effort, the\n\ninterested experimenter can map them if desired.\n\nOK, using the numbering scheme above I was able to figure out the pin\n\ncombinations for each button on the controller. This took alot of time\n\ntracing out the circuit on the plastic keypad, and verifying it with a Baseball\n\ncartridge plugged in! The following pins must be connected for each of the\n\ncorresponding controller operations:\n\nConnecting Pins Makes the Controller Perform\n\n=============== =============================\n\n1 and 4 Up Disc\n\n1 and 2 Down Disc\n\n1 and 5 Left Disc\n\n1 and 3 Right Disc\n\n1, 3, and 4 Diagonal Up/Right Disc\n\n1, 2, 3 and 9 Diagonal Down/Right Disc\n\n1, 2, and 5 Diagonal Down/Left Disc\n\n1, 4, 5 and 9 Diagonal Up/Left Disc\n\n1, 6, and 8 Upper Left and Upper Right Side Button\n\n(SAME!)\n\n1, 7, and 8 Lower Left Side Button\n\n1, 6, and 7 Lower Right Side Button\n\n1, 2, and 6 Keypad 1\n\n1, 2, and 7 Keypad 2\n\n1, 2, and 8 Keypad 3\n\n1, 3, and 6 Keypad 4\n\n1, 3, and 7 Keypad 5\n\n1, 3, and 8 Keypad 6\n\n1, 4, and 6 Keypad 7\n\n1, 4, and 7 Keypad 8\n\n1, 4, and 8 Keypad 9\n\n1, 5, and 6 Keypad CLEAR\n\n1, 5, and 7 Keypad 0\n\n1, 5, and 8 Keypad ENTER\n\nWhew! As you can see, pin 1 connects to every combination, so in building\n\nyour controller it may be easier to connect this pin to a common strip and\n\nconnect all controls to this strip.\n\nIn examining this circuit, you can see why pressing 1 and 9 at the same\n\ntime is just as effective as pushing 3 and 7 if you want to pause a game.\n\nIt connects the same pins either way (Pins 1, 2, 4, 6, and ; You could even\n\nbuild a seperate PAUSE button on your controller if you desire!\n\nMany interesting features could be built into this controller. For example,\n\nif you are familiar with a 555 Timer IC, you could build an adjustable\n\nauto-fire button! But the most important thing in building it is FINDING the\n\ncomponents. My initial idea was to use a push-button phone keypad. Although\n\nit would take a little getting used to (and you really couldn't use overlays),\n\nit would last a LONG time. Anyways, who actually USES the overlays! If a game\n\nrequires them, just put one by the side of the controller.\n\nAs a side note... If anyone can find a place to get a nice keypad, a nice metal\n\nstick assembly, and nice arcade style fire buttons... All at reasonable prices...\n\nPLEASE let me know (ANA-NG@ix.netcom.com). I really want to build one of these\n\nsuckers!\n\nI hope this info gives you the start that you need so that one day you can throw\n\nthose Intellivision Controllers where they belong... the trash!\n\n-----\n\n7.6 - Fixing INTV II Controllers\n\n(This little bit of hackery was provided courtesy of William Moeller\n\n(af332@freenet.hamilton.on.ca)):\n\nI just finished refurbishing an Intellivision II unit so I would have a\n\nmatching Master Component to go with my ECS. I have found quite a few units,\n\nand they all have the same problems. They are missing the power supply, and\n\nthe hand controllers are inoperative. On the original unit, the mylar keypad\n\nis held onto the controller wires by pressure from two screws. When a hand\n\ncontroller on the original Master component stops working correctly, usually\n\ntaking them apart, cleaning and putting them back together, making sure the\n\nscrews are tight does the trick. On the Intellivision II controllers, there\n\nare no screws! I ended up breaking one apart to see how they worked (it was\n\ntrashed already of course). The knowlege I gained allowed me to carefully\n\ntake apart a few controllers to cobble two together to go with my II Master\n\nComponent.\n\nThe first thing that needs to be done is the top piece has to be taken off.\n\nThis is the piece that the disc is flush with. It is held on by little\n\nplastic \"hooks\". A crude drawing is shown.\n\nI I\n\nI I\n\nI I /\n\nI__/\n\nThese \"hooks\" are located in five spots. The first is in the centre at the\n\nbottom of the disc. The next two are located on both sides, right where\n\nthe top of the disk ends, and the keypad begins. The other two are right at\n\nthe top, where the overlay slides in. They are marked with an X on the\n\ndiagram below.\n\n__________________________\n\n==========================\n\nI Intellivision II I\n\nI Hand Controller I\n\n==========================\n\nX I I X\n\nI 1 2 3 I\n\nI I\n\nI I\n\nI 4 5 6 I\n\nI I\n\nI I\n\nI 7 8 9 I\n\nI I\n\nI Clear 0 Enter I\n\nX I========================I X\n\nI ___ I\n\nI / \\ I\n\nI / \\ I\n\nI ( ) I\n\nI \\ / I\n\nI \\ ___ / I\n\nI I\n\nI========================I\n\nX\n\nUse a small screw driver to press the plastic at the correct location, and\n\npry each of the hooks out in an upward motion, being sure not to break them.\n\nThis part is very important and cannot be broken.
