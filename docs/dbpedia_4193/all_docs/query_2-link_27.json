        "text": "I don't think there's much that needs to be said about Atari following the video game crash of 1983. The once-greatest face in the North American video game market faltering to the point of being split up and resold between numerous parties until today where the current name and rights are now owned by a French company, Atari SA (formerly Infogrames).\n\nBut did it have to be this way? Was there a conceivable way for Atari to make a comeback, especially among the console market, following 1983? From what I could gather, it would still a great challenge for the video game crash to not occur at all due to industry standards at the time, but maybe there's a way to negate the effects so Atari could stand a greater chance in the market? And what about their computer products? Was there a chance for those to reach greater success?\n\nIf the 7800 were released in 1984 as intended, rather than 1986— by which point it was clearly inferior to Nintendo and Sega's offerings— they might have had a chance at becoming a major player in the industry (again) rather than an also-ran.\n\nIssue wasn’t tech the famicom(which the nes is based on) was released in June of 83 the 7800 was intended to be released a year later and outside of cart sizes(where the nes was superior) specs wise the 7800 was superior. The issue was software(same thing with the lynx vs game boy) And that the jaguar was a joke. Without Microsoft or another big company propping it up Atari is doomed.\n\nIssue wasn’t tech the famicom(which the nes is based on) was released in June of 83 the 7800 was intended to be released a year later and outside of cart sizes(where the nes was superior) specs wise the 7800 was superior.

Atari's Console division deliberately avoided 400/800 compatibility to not be subservient to the Computer division\n\nThey did a slight revamp in 1983 on the 5200, that should have been to make the 5200 fully compatible with the 400/800, make a new controller, and add the SIO port for 400/800 accessories , like the Disk Drive to run the console games, and 400/800 content\n\nThe mistake was with the 5200.

They had decent games\n\nAtari was resting on the 2600, that still was over 50% of the consoles at home in 1982, and much of the games were just crap, partly from the limitation of the 2600, but also just from poor games, from both the new upswing in 3rd party game publishers, and Atari themselves. The 2600 was very difficult to develop on, from the hardware limitation\n\nIt was shovelware before anyone knew what that was.\n\nThen you had downright rotten ports, like Pac-Man on the 2600\n\nBut the thing that was killing the console, was the Home computer.\n\nThey had better graphics, plus were 'real' computers, and with Commodore starting a price war, they were the better value, enough RAM to hold decent games, and able\n\nto get more complex games 120k from a Disk or even tape, than the limit of a 4k or 8k ROM on a cartridge\n\nWhat got the NES in the good graces of Retailers, that they would buy back for any stock that was left unsold, guaranteed Money Back, and not be left holding the bag of crap games, and they had final approval on 3rd party developers, and a 30% license fee\n\nSo yeah, they had some duds, but retailers wouldn't have to eat that anymore, and Nintendo got money from the 3rd party developers\n\nThe thing is, if its not Tramiel then I don't know who else would want to buy up Atari since I doubt Warner will want to keep the whole thing after the crash. Namco, maybe? Would Namco even want to buy up what would be a Nintendo competitor considering they had their own deal with them at the time?\n\nWhy not? Hudson Soft was the original third-party of Nintendo and they made the PC-Engine to begin with. Namco would be like they get a western Foothold if they want. Plus Namco Deal was the same as Any third party at the time. Another could be a tech company, IBM, honeywell or another of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BUNCH Seven Dwraves. But Tramiel has to be as far as possible from possible"
