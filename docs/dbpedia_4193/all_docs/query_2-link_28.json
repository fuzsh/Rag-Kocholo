I do remember that in the early 90s I connected an MSX joypad to a 2600 and it just worked. Second button was off limits though.\n\nIf there's no autofire involved it's just a matter of pinout conversion which should probably be done on an adapterboard or in an extension cable. So you don't have to \"destroy\" your joypad.\n\nAli6x944 wrote:\n\nthe construction is rather simple and straight forward\n\nYes look here: http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/DB9-Joystick\n\nAli6x944 wrote:\n\nthe construction is rather simple and straight forward, I was wondering if anybody did before\n\nMany people have already done it.\n\nAli6x944 wrote:\n\nthe NES or Famicom be used in any capacity?\n\nYes but reading data is done bit per bit. You will need to program a specific routine in machine language to use a NES controller.\n\ngdx wrote:\n\nYes but reading data is done bit per bit.

It was considered affordable at a price of US$140 (equivalent to $320 in 2018).\n\nali6x944 wrote:\n\ndo I need to short the resistors on the trig1 and trig2 buttons?\n\nDo not... That will cause a short circuit...\n\nLooking at the pics, I would say...\n\nBefore mod (BL034):\n\n1 - Orange\n\n2 - Yellow\n\n3 - Red\n\n4 - White\n\nAfter mod:\n\n1 - White\n\n2 - Orange\n\n3 - Joy Pin 7 (or N/C)\n\n4 - N/C\n\nLoose wires:\n\nYellow (GND)\n\nRed (+5v)"
