        "text": "As we approach the release of the PS4 and the Xbox One, we prepare to truly enter next era of console gaming. But the history of console gaming goes back decades, 40 years of history. Wars, alliances, betrayals, and the rise and fall of many companies. Exeposé Games sets out on a journey of great historical importance, charting each generation of…The Console Wars.\n\nIn late 1993, the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and the Atari Jaguar released to American markets. The consoles were very different. The 3DO had cutting-edge technology, such as built in CD-ROM drive.\n\nThe Jaguar meanwhile, was an attempt by the former juggernaut Atari to return to the market, by outperforming the SNES and Genesis.\n\nBoth consoles never sold too well, with the 3DO selling 2 million and the Jaguar selling only 250,000. The 3DO was just too expensive, costing $699, and had a small game library. The Jaguar, meanwhile, lost out because it couldn’t convince the third party developers to make games, so the game library was too small to appeal.\n\nThough affordable at $249, the controller was one of the most complicated known. They had little impact on the success of later consoles in the generation.\n\nIn late 1994 in Japan, Sega released its latest console, the Saturn. The Saturn was built to be more powerful than the 3DO, with dual central processors and a CD-ROM drive. It was also still accompanied by the aggressive marketing that the Mega Drive had received. The Saturn launched to promising sales, even in Japan, at 170,000 in the first day. The console, was difficult to program in a way that would harness its maximum capabilities, because of a late redesign to add the second CPU, as a response to another console. The console in question was Sony’s PlayStation.\n\nThe PlayStation had a difficult birth. Originally meant as a CD-ROM add-on to the SNES, it was developed into a SNES-compatible, Sony-branded console, able to play both CDs and cartridges.\n\nNintendo realised before the 1991Consumer Electronics Show, that Sony effectively had control of any and all titles on the CD. So at their press conference at CES, Nintendo announced their ally to Philips; who gave it total control over its licences on Philips machines, and abandoned Sony.\n\nSony decided to continue develop their console as a complete stand-alone. Nintendo filed a lawsuit in response, with the matter not being resolved until the end of 1992. The PlayStation would still have a SNES port, but Nintendo continued to hold the rights. Sony then simply removed the port, ending any Nintendo involvement, and finished work for a 1994 release.\n\nThe console gained massive praise, being one of the most powerful consoles of the generation, and the sales matched that. Sega was in serious hot water.\n\nSega needed a good launch in the US to truly compete against the PlayStation. At the first E3 on 11th May 1995, Sega announced the Saturn’s US release would change from its September to the day of its Conference to get a few months on Sony’s September release. They emphasised the power and capabilities of the console for the price of $399.\n\nSony then killed their chances, not with a conference talk, but with a one-line response: ‘299’. The rest is history. Sega never got the sales it wanted for the Saturn, and the Jaguar and 3DO were effectively killed off. It was to be Atari’s last console, leaving the market entirely. Sony reigned supreme.\n\nWith the Sony juggernaut steaming ahead, in 1996 Nintendo finally entered the generation with the Nintendo 64. The console was the PlayStation’s main ‘opponent’ during the generation, and had a lot of differences. Namely, the difference existed in the media platform, the controller, and its cheaper price of $199. The N64 used cartridges instead of CDs, and the controller was unique: three trigger buttons, size right-side buttons, the d-pad on the conventional left, and a thumb-joystick in the middle.\n\nThe N64 and PlayStation quickly became the dominant consoles on the market. With the Saturn being discontinued in 1998, for two years, Sony and Microsoft battled in various smaller conflicts to prove their edge against the other in the console war. The key weapons employed were the competing media format and controllers.\n\nThe ‘media war’ was the battle between the cartridge and CD format. Nintendo had chosen the cartridge format due to suspicion over the CD format; due mainly to the longer load times, concern over video game piracy, and likely the smaller licencing price for the cheaper CD format.\n\nThe piracy issue was one backed by evidence, as the PlayStation had problems with it for its entire run. With the increase complexity of games, through the larger-storage and cheaper cost of CDs, third-party developers went to Sony instead of Nintendo. CDs became the dominant format.\n\nThe ‘controller war’ took a similar-yet-different route. The N64’s thumb joystick was the main point. The PlayStation didn’t have thumbsticks, so Nintendo got the advantage with 3D games, especially the rising first-person shooters like Goldeneye. As a result, Sony created the Dualshock controller: with the left side d-pad, right side action button, two trigger buttons on each side, start and select buttons and two thumbsticks, it created the format of the modern controller.\n\nSony won again.\n\nBy the end of the generation’s prime in 2000, Sony had won the fifth console war without a doubt. The PlayStation and the Dualshock controller became the basis for future. Its sales beat the N64’s by a wide margin, though it remained popular due to its first-party titles, and the Saturn was a very distant third.\n\nThe PlayStation also began something else: at over 100million sold in its run, the console took the industry mainstream. Sony’s reign had begun. The sixth console war would one of Sony’s consolidation, but also of a few extra surprises.\n\nCheck in tomorrow for the full history ofThe Sixth Console War…\n\nLuke Pilchowski\n\nLike our the Games Section’s Facebook page to receive the latest updates.\n\nOr follow us on Twitter to get in touch @ExeposeVG\n\nAs we approach the release of the PS4 and the Xbox One, we prepare to truly enter next era of console gaming. But the history of console gaming goes back decades, 40 years of history. Wars, alliances, betrayals, and the rise and fall of many companies. Exeposé Games sets out on a journey of great historical importance, charting each generation of…The Console Wars.\n\nAs the console market imploded in the US in 1983, across the Pacific, Nintendo were preparing to release their latest console, the Famicom. Having been successful with the dedicated consoles in the late 70s, and arcade games series in the early 80s, Nintendo decided to create its own console. The company Sega also decided to release a console, the SG-1000, at the same time, with both releasing on 15th July 1983.\n\nFor the first year, neither sold particularly well. The SG-1000 was too much like the older consoles to differentiate it. The Famicom, on the other hand, had a technical issue with the motherboard.\n\nNintendo issued a product recall, replaced the motherboard, and started shipping again. The popularity of the console then exploded, becoming Japan’s best selling console by the end of 1984.\n\nTwo years later, in September 1986, Nintendo released the Famicom to American and European markets; but they gave the Famicom a rebrand, it was now called the Nintendo Entertainment System or NES. Because of the gaming crash of 1983, Nintendo had trouble convincing retailers to stock the console, taking several measures to have them agree to it, such as the rebranding to make it sound less like a gaming console.\n\nThe US still believed console gaming had been a fad. The NES destroyed all belief of that. By 1988, it had sold 11 million NES units in the US and Japan alone.\n\nNintendo market success wasn’t by luck. It was by a series of reforms to hardware, software, and business practice that became the standard for the gaming market. All done first with the NES. Besides form, and the basic improvements to increase its capabilities compared the last generation, the NES also had a completely different controller setup. Instead of a joystick, it had two buttons on the right, a start and select button in the middle, and a d-pad on the left.\n\nIt short, it was the beginning of the modern controller. Another simple feature, were the character sprites now found in the games. Though taken for granted now, multi-coloured sprites were a massive leap forward for the industry in terms of graphics design.\n\nBeyond improvement, it innovated the gaming industry. However, even if the market couldn’t trust the game quality, it wouldn’t matter.\n\nThat was where locking came in. Using specifically coded chips, Nintendo locked the NES for programmers, and locked it regionally. First-party games were unaffected, but third-party developers would have to pay Nintendo royalties for the licence, and if a game didn’t get Nintendo’s seal of approval, it didn’t release.\n\nThe result were games that earned Nintendo’s seal of quality, coming to improve gaming quality and helping restore buyer confidence, all of which Nintendo profited from. Atari had seen third-party developers as an enemy to their market; Nintendo used them as an untapped goldmine.\n\nThe NES did eventually get competition, in two very different forms. Sega returned in October 1985 with the Sega Master System, a console that outperformed the NES in terms of hardware, with a bigger memory, colour palette and stronger capabilities of producing early forms of 3D graphics.\n\nConversely, Atari’s attempt to get back the market, the Atari 7800, released had been delayed to release since 1984, releasing properly in January 1986, its near complete backwards compatibility its only major feature among its relatively out-dated hardware.\n\nInstead of fighting Nintendo, though, it ended a fight for second place, and Atari always was on the back foot. Nintendo’s licencing policy meant the companies licenced could only work on NES games for two years, effectively cutting off Sega and Atari from most big games.\n\nThe Empire of Nintendo reigned supreme.\n\nBy the end of 1988, Nintendo dominated the industry. It controlled 78% of the gaming market. If the first console war had been exploration, and the second a scramble, the third console war was a conquest and revival of the failing gaming industry-by the Nintendo Empire.\n\nIt also marked the end of US dominance over the market, shifting instead to Japan, where it remained effectively unchallenged for over 20 years. Atari was out, but Sega was still prepared to fight Nintendo on even ground. The pitched battle of the fourth console war was about to begin.\n\nCheck in tomorrow for the full history ofThe Fourth Console War…\n\nLuke Pilchowski\n\nLike our the Games Section’s Facebook page to receive the latest updates.\n\nOr follow us on Twitter to get in touch @ExeposeVG\n\nAs we approach the release of the PS4 and the Xbox One, we prepare to truly enter next era of console gaming. But the history of console gaming goes back decades, 40 years of history. Wars, alliances, betrayals, and the rise and fall of many companies. Exeposé Games sets out on a journey of great historical importance, charting each generation of…The Console Wars.\n\nThe second console war started in 1976, only a short time before the big crash in 1977.\n\nAugust 1976, the company Fairchild released the Fairchild Video Entertainment System, or VES. The VES it had the distinction of being the first programmable cartridge-based console, having proper cartridges compared to its Magnavox predecessor. It was also the first console to have a microprocessor, allowing to larger and more complex games to be developed. The console sold well. In its first year it sold 250,000 units, a respectable number.\n\nIts popularity was a success for Fairchild, but the success didn’t last long.\n\nOn 11th September 1977, after the losses of the previous generation and viewing the success of the VES, Atari released the Atari Video Computer System, or VCS. It had the same bases as the VES, with microprocessor-based hardware and removable game cartridges, but with a slight difference; it had considerably better graphics and sound. Fairchild, around the same time, renamed the VES to the Channel F, so as to avoid confusion.\n\nThe console war started moving in 1977. But it was a slow start.\n\nAtari’s VCS only sold 250,000 units in its first year, and only sold 550,000 of the 1978 production run of 800,000, needing support from Warner Communications to make the losses. The resulting disagreement lead to Atari founder Nolan Bushnell to leave the company. It faired better than the Channel F, whose popularity dropped after the VCS’ release, and Fairchild left the market entirely in 1979.\n\n1979 marked a change. The public began to realise the games were now developing beyond the PONG formula, as programmers learned to push the better hardware’s capabilities.\n\nAtari’s console started to bring in money, and a lot of it. Atari sold 1 million VCS units in 1979, and 2 million in 1980. The company went from $75 million in gross revenue in 1977 to $2 billion in 1980, becoming the fastest growing company in US history.\n\nThis success wasn’t missed by others companies. Magnavox returned in 1978 with the Odyssey2, and Mattel joined in with the Intellivision, which market tested in 1979 before releasing in 1980. These consoles were also successful, though not to the same extent.\n\nBy 1982, the VCS, at this point renamed to its more remembered name of the 2600 had sold 10 million units, and the Odyssey2 and the Intellivision had both sold around 2 million.\n\nWhile these were the big fighters for the majority of the console war, they weren’t the only ones out. By 1982, there were nearly a dozen consoles on the market, many joining that year. Even Coleco, who had pulled out of the market in 1978, returned with the ColecoVision, and Atari released a new console, the 5200, try and earn some profit.\n\nThe console war had become a scramble to get as much money from the market as possible. But in 1983, the market they had been scrambling over disappeared. What resulted was the worst crash in gaming history. There were many causes for the crash: the saturation of the market with consoles and games, the rise of the competitor PC market and uncontrolled third-party developers, the massive drop in gaming quality.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin came from Atari, who, in 1981 and 1982, released the licensed games Pac-man and E.T., which they had had their programmers write in next to no time. The two are regarded as some of the worst games ever made, and overconfident sales figures resulted in putting Atari into $500 million debt, and Warner wouldn’t bail them out this time. The public lost trust and interest. The Atari dreadnought sank, and took everyone else with her.\n\nOf the generation, only Atari were left in the industry, a shell of its former self. And so the second console war ended, quickly and dramatically.\n\nFor the next few years after, console gaming was seen as a fad, never to rise to the height it once was. Then Nintendo released the NES, The Console Wars now went East.\n\nCheck in tomorrow for the full history ofThe Third Console War…\n\nLuke Pilchowski\n\nLike our the Games Section’s Facebook page to receive the latest updates.\n\nOr follow us on Twitter to get in touch @ExeposeVG\n\nAs we approach the release of the PS4 and the Xbox One, we prepare to truly enter next era of console gaming. But the history of console gaming goes back decades, 40 years of history. Wars, alliances, betrayals, and the rise and fall of many companies. Exeposé Games sets out on a journey of great historical importance, charting each generation of…The Console Wars.\n\nThis history of console gaming begins not with the widely known PONG, but with a company known as Magnavox.\n\nIn May 1972 released the Odyssey console in North America. Despite being the first console, it was different compared to its later competitors. It used an early form of ‘cartridge’ system, allowing for removable games, a feature basically unique to that console during the generation.\n\nThe console released to poor sales, selling only 330,000 units over its two-year lifetime, mainly said to be due to bad marketing. Marketing, apparently, is something that companies have never been able to master, with it still remaining an issue today.\n\nThe first console war wouldn’t really begin until three years later.\n\nIn 1975, Atari released the Home Pong, which it literally what it says it is: Pong meant to be played on home television. Until the Odyssey, the Home Pong was a dedicated console, playing only the game, or games, built into it, including, of course, PONG. It was regarded as a great success, selling 150,000 units during its limited release in the holiday season of 1975.\n\nFollowing this, Atari and several others started to use the ‘dedicated console’ formula. The same year as the Home Pong, Magnavox started to release its new line of Odyssey consoles, starting with the Odyssey 100. Atari began with its PONG console series after its success. Coleco started to release the Telestar console series in 1976, and Nintendo the same with the Color TV Game series in 1977, though only to Japanese markets.\n\nThis never met to the same success as the first incarnations. Though each console series had success; with Coleco, Magnavox, and Nintendo selling around 1 million, 2 million, and 3 million units respectively, they saturated the market in the process. Coleco had released no less than 14 consoles; Magnavox had released 8; and Atari 9, all between 1975 and 1977.\n\nNo-one wanted to pay for a new console when the old one had almost all the same games on the old one, which they had got only a few months, or even weeks ago, especially considering the price was between $50-230.\n\n$100 dollars in the 1970s today would be worth almost $600, more than even the PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nFor the first, but not last, time, the video game market crashed in 1977.\n\nColeco pulled out of the gaming market in 1978, and Magnavox and Atari suffered heavy losses. Nintendo survived the crash by the fact it was only in Japan, where it was the only strong console series. The First console war just came to implode on itself, not truly becoming a ‘war’ before it had already ended.\n\nConsole gaming survived though, by switching back the formula it had started with on the original Odyssey: removable cartridges. The second generation of consoles started was where the true console wars began.\n\nCheck in tomorrow for the full history of The Second Console War…\n\nLuke Pilchowski\n\nLike our the Games Section’s Facebook page to receive the latest updates.\n\nOr follow us on Twitter to get in touch @ExeposeVG"
