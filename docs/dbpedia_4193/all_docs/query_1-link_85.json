        "text": "Step into the time machine and get ready for a blast from the past! Iconic games originally produced for the Atari 7800 are making a comeback, thanks to a collaboration between global gaming publisher and developer PLAION and the legendary Atari brand. On 24th May 2024, three beloved titles will be re-released, giving new and old gamers alike a chance to experience the magic.\n\nThe first game to make its triumphant return is Fatal Run. In this post-apocalyptic racing adventure, players must navigate treacherous roads and deliver life-saving medicine to various towns. But that's not all - there's a rocket waiting at a missile base that could save the world! Originally released in 1990, Fatal Run taps into the enduring popularity of post-apocalyptic themes, reminding us that even in a devastated world, hope can still prevail.\n\nIf racing through a desolate landscape isn't your cup of tea, how about a food fight? Food Fight, another classic title, puts you in control of Charley, a character on a mission to eat an ice cream cone. But beware, angry chefs Angelo, Zorba, Oscar, and Jacques will do everything in their power to stop you. Dodge the food they throw at you, and if you're feeling bold, throw some right back at them! Praised for its fast-paced gameplay, Food Fight has stood the test of time and is beloved by retro gaming enthusiasts.\n\nFor those seeking a truly one-of-a-kind gaming experience, Ninja Golf is a must-play. This unconventional combination of ninja combat and golf mechanics offers a unique and entertaining challenge. Swing your club, kick away at ninjas, and dodge deadly stars as you make your way through the course. Don't forget to collect treasure along the way! Ninja Golf stands out as one of the most unusual games for Atari consoles, proving that creativity knows no bounds.\n\nExcited to dive back into these retro gems? Pre-orders for the reissued games will open on 29th January 2024. Each game will be available for £24.99 (€29.99/AU$44.99/$29.99). Whether you're a seasoned Atari fan or a curious newcomer, mark your calendars and prepare to embark on a nostalgic journey."
