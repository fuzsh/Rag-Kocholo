        "text": "Atari 7800 is a home video game console officially released by Atari Corporation in 1986 as the successor to both the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200. It can run almost all Atari 2600 cartridges, making it the first console with backward compatibility. It shipped with a different model of joystick from the 2600-standard CX40 and Pole Position II as the pack-in game. Most of the announced titles at launch were ports of 1980â83 arcade games.\n\nDesigned by General Computer Corporation, the 7800 has significantly improved graphics hardware over Atari's previous consoles, but the same Television Interface Adapter chip that launched with the 2600 in 1977 is used to generate audio. In an effort to prevent the flood of poor quality games that contributed to the video game crash of 1983, cartridges had to be digitally signed by Atari.\n\nThe console was originally supposed to hit the market in May 1984, but because of the sale of Atari and the disputes between Warner Communications and the new owner Atari's consumer division did not hit the market until two years later. The original production run of the Atari 7800 languished in warehouses until it was reintroduced in January 1986. A two-year loss to the competition, which at the time was mainly represented by NES and SMS consoles, but it could no longer catch up.\n\nThe console has been selling for less than $ 80 since its relesase. Thirteen games were announced for the system's launch:: Ms. Pac-Man, Pole Position II, Centipede, Joust, Dig Dug, Desert Falcon, Robotron: 2084, Galaga, Food Fight, Ballblazer, Rescue on Fractalus !, Track & Field and Xevious. At the end of 1986, however, the Atari 7800 game library had only 10 games. Compared to the competition, it was very little. It's no wonder, then, that console owners have often complained about the slow release of new games. But it was not valid for them. Only 59 games were created for the Atari 7800 console during its active existence.\n\nOn January 1, 1992, Atari Corporation announced the end of production and support for the 7800, 2600, and the 8-bit computer family including the Atari XEGS. it was clear at that time, that Atari had lost its battle with the competition. By the time of the discontinuation, the Nintendo Entertainment System controlled 80% of the North American market while Atari had only 12%.\n\nThe Atari 7800 returned to the world in 2004 as a console Atari Flashback. It resembles a miniature Atari 7800 and has five 7800 and fifteen 2600 games built-in. However, even this retro console was not successful and the project was canceled shortly thereafter.\n\nAlphabetical list of the games for Atari 7800 hosted at RetroGames.cz:\n\nName Released Number of hits User rating 1942 1984 2649x 80% Ace of Aces 1986 10881x 61% Alien Brigade 1990 456754x 52% Asteroids 1979 88858x 59% Asteroids Deluxe 1981 6771x 69% Baby Pac-Man 1982 15749x 72% Ballblazer 1985 23986x 68% Basketbrawl 1990 19186x 50% Castelian 1987 8142x 33% Centipede 1980 0x 63% Choplifter 1982 13103x 69% Commando 1985 10922x 60% Crack'ed 1988 5906x 51% Crossbow 1983 10510x 40% Dark Chambers 1988 14184x 75% Desert Falcon 1987 13296x 64% Dig Dug 1982 21264x 69% Donkey Kong 1981 35022x 58% Donkey Kong Jr. 1982 19296x 68% Double Dragon 1987 9983x 52% F-18 Hornet 1988 18865x 61% Fatal Run 1989 15120x 61% Fight Night 1985 24053x 56% Food Fight 1987 27025x 70% Frenzy 1982 4679x 66% Froggie 2018 6577x 71% Galaga 1981 29093x 61% Galaxian 1979 2495x 70% Hat Trick 1984 12725x 50% Ikari Warriors 1986 10072x 56% Impossible Mission 1984 18697x 62% Joust 1982 11987x 77% Jr. Pac-Man 1983 3234x 62% Karateka 1984 14296x 67% Klax 1989 8392x 53% Kung-Fu Master 1984 12442x 62% Mario Bros. 1983 30863x 64% Mat Mania Challenge 1986 18289x 54% Midnight Mutants 1990 46046x 76% MotorPsycho 1990 14931x 55% Ms. Pac-Man 1982 18575x 68% Ninja Golf 1990 411853x 65% One-On-One Basketball 1983 24140x 64% Pac-Man Collection! 2006 224402x 61% Planet Smashers 1990 11226x 72% Pole Position II 1983 277511x 63% Rampage 1986 9846x 57% RealSports Baseball 1982 14631x 51% Robotron: 2084 1982 47760x 61% Santa Simon 2006 3880x 77% Scramble 1981 6783x 77% Scrapyard Dog 1990 12729x 72% Space Invaders 1978 5196x 67% Summer Games 1984 15869x 59% Super Pac-Man 1982 23513x 59% TMP Wrestling 1987 11879x 56% Tank Command 1988 17445x 51% Tomcat: The F-14 ... 1988 26609x 52% Touchdown Football 1984 11299x 52% Water Ski 1988 7892x 54% Winter Games 1985 17512x 66% Xenophobe 1988 10251x 58% Xevious 1982 13232x 71%"
