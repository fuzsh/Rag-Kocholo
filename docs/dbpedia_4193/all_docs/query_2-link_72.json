        "text": "- Tetris\n\n- The release of the OGGB\n\n- DS\n\nDespite the erroneous claims of the PS1 being the first gaming device to expand the market, that distinction exclusively belongs to the OGGB, which brought in a significant number of female consumers at a time when gaming was exclusively pamdered towards males.\n\nTetris goes without saying - its the granddaddy of social gaming as we know it, was the first worldwide cult phenomenon in the industry, and (IMO) is the most influential game ever created. There is no modern gaming market without Tetris, point blank.\n\nWhich brings us to the DS, Nintendo's second paradigm-shifting device whose influence led to the biggest expansion in gaming since the OGGB. It was during this gen touch-screen gaming went from a unique gimmick to worldwide mass proliferation, and it is also because of this we've noe seen a contraction in dedicated gaming devices since then, due to better value devices (smartphones/tablets) eating up expanded consumers.\n\nThose are the three biggies in my eyes. Everything else doesn't even come close in terms of impact and legacy.\n\nIt's not the NES, kids.\n\nYes, the industry went into recession in 83, making retailers wary of the home video game industry. This was a VERY temporary situation, however.\n\nAtari themselves was well aware of the problems that unrestricted third party software caused with the market surrounding the 2600. The Atari 7800 was announced in 1984 as a successor to that system, and included a \"lockout\" chip that functioned similarly to the one in the NES. Market flooding was no longer a concern at the retail level. Due to the sale of Atari the release of the 7800 was delayed to 1986, however.\n\nThe crash also was really a US only phenomenon, and didn't stop SEGA from developing the Master System, which hit Japan in 85 and North America in 86. SEGA at the time had a pretty robust stable of arcade hits to port to that system, they weren't in the same league as the flood of 2600 clones clogging shelves in the beginning of the decade.\n\nSpeaking of arcades...Arcades were still pretty healthy at this time and survived the crash just fine.\n\n1983 saw the release of Star Wars Arcade, Gyruss, Dragon's Lair, Pole Position 2, Crystal Castles and Spy Hunter.\n\n1984 saw Karate Champ, Pac-Land (notable for being a side scrolling arcade platformer a year before SMB), Karate Champ, 1942, and Marble Madness. A little game called TETRIS also released that year on computers, though that one might be a little obscure.\n\n1985 (the year Nintendo \"saved\" the industry with the NES) was a banner year for arcade releases. Yie-Ar Kung Fu, Paperboy, Gradius, Commando, Hang-On, Ghosts N Goblins, Space Harrier, and Gauntlet release.\n\nThe video game industry as a whole would have easily survived. Game companies were still making hardware and software right through the crash.\n\nSo why so so many think Nintendo saved the industry single handedly? Anticompetitive practices, mostly. While the NES was undoubtedly a hit when it released in 85, Nintendo leaned heavily on its success to illegally bar their competition from getting a foothold in the market, as well as enacting punitive measures against retailers.\n\nThis is why despite the existence of technically superior consoles like the Master System or familiar names like the 7800, Nintendo controlled upwards of 80% of the home console market during the late 80s.\n\nThe justice department and the FTC both sued Nintendo over this- Nintendo was not required to admit wrongdoing or pay fines, only cease practices.\n\nThe second that stopped, suddenly other systems became MUCH more viable, with the Genesis, Turbografx, and Neo-Geo systems eating heavily into Nintendo's market share virtually overnight.\n\nSo...no NES? the home console market revival would likely have been delayed to 86, MAYBE 87 at the latest with the master system and 7800 dividing the market, with both getting a healthy flow of arcade ports to those systems exactly as the NES did.\n\nGames would have been a lot cheaper overall as well, since competition plus the lack of price fixing would have driven costs down."
