Poised as a competitor to the then king of the hill Atari 2600, Mattel Electronics called their new product \"Intelligent Television\", stemming largely from their marketing plans to release a compatible computer keyboard for their video games console. Mattel's marketing was anything *but* intelligent and almost destroyed the company by 1984. In one sense the system was very successful, with over 3 million units sold and 125 games released before the system was discontinued by INTV Corp. in 1990. The original Master Component was test marketed in Fresno, California in late 1979. The response was excellent, and Mattel went national with their new game system in late 1980. The first year's production run of 200,000 units was completely sold out! To help enhance it's marketability, Mattel also marketed the system in Sears stores as the Super Video Arcade, and at Radio Shack as the Tandyvision One in the early 1980's. 1980 was a turbulent year for the Intellivision. Mattel announced that an \"inexpensive\" keyboard expansion would be available in 1981 for the master component to be dropped into. This was to turn the system into a powerful 64K home computer that could do everything from play games to balance your checkbook. There was a great deal of marketing money and press coverage devoted to this unit; a third of the box for the GTE/Sylvania Intellivision describes the features of this proposed expansion. Many people bought an Intellivision with plans to turn it into a computer when the expansion module was released. Months, then years passed and the original expansion keyboard was released only in a few test areas in late 1981. With the price too high and the initial reaction poor, the product was scrapped in 1982 before being released nationwide. 1982 saw many changes in both the videogame industry and the Intellivision product line. A voice-synthesis module called Intellivoice made sound and speech and integral part of gameplay, through the use of special voice- enhanced cartridges. The Intellivision II was also released this year, which one company spokesperson described as \"smaller and lighter that the original, yet with the same powerful 16-bit microprocessor\". The new console was more compact than the first, and its grayish body made it look more like a sophisticated electronic device than the original design. 1983 brought more promises from the folks at Mattel, the most significant of which being the Intellivision III. This was shown off at the January 1983 CES show, and lauded in the videogame mags for many months afterwards. In June of 1983 at the Summer CES show, Mattel announced it was killing the Intellivision III and including most of its high-profile features into their long-awaited computer expansion, the Entertainment Computer System. Probably the most ambitious effort the Intellivision team had undertaken, the Entertainment Computer System was comprised of a computer keyboard add-on, a 49-key music synthesizer, ram expansion for the keyboard add-on to expand it to a full 64K RAM and 24K ROM, a data recorder to store programs, a 40-column thermal printer, and an adapter which would allow you to play Atari 2600 games on your Intellivision. The RAM expansion modules, data recorder, and thermal printer never made it past the drawing board, and the music synthesizer had but one software title to take advantage of its capabilities. While the 2600 adapter greatly expanded the library of available games, much of the steam this generated had already been stolen by Coleco's own expansion module. 1984 would spell the end of the original Intellivision as the world knew it. Terry E. Valeski, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Sales at Mattel Electronics, along with a group of investors, purchased the assets, trademarks, patents, and right to the Intellivision in January of 1984 for $16.5 million dollars. The purchase was backed by financing from Tangible Industries, a division of Revco Drug Stores, The newly formed company was originally called Intellivision, Inc., and later renamed INTV, Inc., after Valeski negotiated all rights from Revco in November of 1984. During the next two years, the new company would lie dormant while plans were being made for a re-emergence. In the fall of 1985, the INTV System III (also called the Super Pro System) appeared at Toys 'R Us, Kiddie City, and in a mail order catalog sent to owners of the original Intellivision direct from INTV. The new console was of the same general design as the original master component, except it sported a fresh black plastic shell with brushed aluminum trim. Several new games accompanied the release of the new system, and 1985 would register over $6 million dollars in sales worldwide, indicating that INTV Corp. had indeed revived the Intellivision. INTV continued to market games and repair services through the mail with great success. Between 1985 and 1990 over 35 new games were released, bringing the Intellivision's game library to a total of 125 titles. Many more changes were to come during the final six years of Intellivision's useful life. In 1987, an improved master component called the INTV System IV was shown at the January CES, which sported detachable controllers and a timing device. Unfortunately, this never saw the light either. In the fall of 1988, INTV re-introduced the computer keyboard adapter through their mail order catalog on a limited quantity basis. In 1990, INTV discontinued retail sales of their games and equipment and sold them only through the mail channels. The change in marketing was due to agreements with Nintendo and Sega to become a software vendor for the NES, Game Boy and Genesis. In 1991, INTV sold out its stock of Intellivision games and consoles, and the company, along with the Intellivision, gradually faded into black. 1.2 - Timeline -------------- 1979 - Intellivision is test marketed 1980 - Mattel Intellivision released nationally, Computer Expansion announced 1982 - Computer Expansion Module scrapped due to high cost and poor response 1982 - Intellivoice released 1983 - Intellivision II released 1983 - Entertainment Computer System released, many peripherals. announced 1983 - 2600 System Changer released 1983 - Intellivision III announced 1983 - The videogame market begins to crash 1983 - Intellivision III dropped 1984 - The videogame market bottoms out 1984 - Mattel sells the Intellivision rights to VP Marketing T.E.

Controls: 12 button numeric key pad, four action keys, 16 direction disk Sound: Sound generator capable of 3 part harmony with programmable ASDR envelopes. Color: 16 Resolution: 192v x 160h pixels 2.2 - Processor Specs --------------------- (Author's note: Most of this information was captured off the net two years ago, would the original author please speak up and maybe help me clean up this info?? =) ) GI 1600, running at something like 500KHz. Processor has 16 bit registers, uses 16 bit RAM, and has 10 (yes, 10) bit instructions. Intellivision cartridges contain ROMs that are 10 bits wide. Ten bits are called a decle, and half that is a nickle. There were 160 bytes of RAM, I think (general purpose RAM -- there is also RAM used by the graphics chip for character bitmaps and to tell what is where on the screen). The CPU was strange. For example, if you did two ROTATE LEFT instructions, followed by a ROTATE RIGHT BY 2 (rotates could be by one or two), you did NOT end up with the original word. The top two bits were swapped! Ken Kirkby also has this to add: \"The GI CP1600 was developed as a joint venture in the early seventies between GI and Honeywell. One of the first commercial uses of the CP1600 was its incorporation into Honeywell's TDC2000, the first distributed control system, prototypes existed in late '74 I think. Honeywells then Test Instrument Division also incorporated into a Cardiac Catheterisation system called MEDDARS which was released for sale about 1979. The CP1600 was definitely a 16 bit chip.\" John Dullea dug this information up during a stroll at his local library: In the Penn State Library I found a book called \"An Introduction to Microcomputers, Vol. 2: Some Real MicroProcessors\", By Adam Osborne, Osborne & Associates, Inc., 1978. ISBN: 0-931998-15-2. Library of Congress catalogue card #: 76-374891. It has lots of info on the CP1600/1610 CPU in the Intellivision in chapter 16 Here are the pinouts of the CPU: +------------------+ ____ EBCI ---+ 1 40 +--- PCIT _____ | | MSYNC ---+ 2 39 +--- GND | | BC1 ---+ 3 38 +--- (PHI)1 | | BC2 ---+ 4 37 +--- (PHI)2 | | BDIR ---+ 5 36 +--- VDD | | D15 ---+ 6 35 +--- VBB | | D14 ---+ 7 34 +--- VCC | | D13 ---+ 8 33 +--- BDRDY | | _____ D12 ---+ 9 32 +--- STPST | | _____ D11 ---+ 10 31 +--- BUSRQ | | D10 ---+ 11 30 +--- HALT | | _____ D9 ---+ 12 CP1600 29 +--- BUSAK | CPU | ____ D8 ---+ 13 28 +--- INTR | | _____ D0 ---+ 14 27 +--- INTRM | | D1 ---+ 15 26 +--- TCI | | D7 ---+ 16 25 +--- EBCA0 | | D6 ---+ 17 24 +--- EBCA1 | | D5 ---+ 18 23 +--- EBCA2 | | D4 ---+ 19 22 +--- EBCA3 | | D3 ---+ 20 21 +--- D2 +------------------+ D0-D15 ...............

Looking at the logic board in the Intellivision unit (original model 2609) reveals a number of (important) chips: Sound ............. AY-3-8914 ................ 40-pin ROM ............... RO-3-9503-003 ............ 40-pin ROM ............... RO-3-9502-011 ............ 40-pin Color ............. AY-3-8915 ................ 18-pin And, of course, there is the cartridge ROM: ROM ............... AY-3-9504-021 ............ 28-pin In addition, there are three 40-pin chips that have heat sinks epoxied on top. Now, you may try this, but be EXTREMELY careful (or just listen to what I found): I carefully removed the three heat-sunk chips and looked at them; they have designations on the bottom! STIC .............. AY-3-8900-1 .............. 40-pin RAM ............... RA-3-9600 ................ 40-pin CPU ............... CP-1610 .................. 40-pin +----- hello! Having the CPU location and pinouts, one can use an ohmmeter to map the pins to the cartridge pins: (looking AT the cartridge, not the Intellivision unit) You probably should double-check this, but I obviously can't accept any responsibility for any damage to your Master Component. (I'm not 100% sure about the assignments for VCC and GND) TOP BOTTOM NC GND _____ NC MSYNC NC D7 GND D8 GND D6 GND D9 NC D5 GND D10 GND D4 GND D11 GND D3 GND D12 GND D13 GND D2 NC D14 *1 D1 *2 D0 *3 D15 *3 *3 *2 *2 *1 *1 GND VCC All *x pins are connected; cartridges have a loop on the top row connecting them, and the connector in the Intellivision unit connects the top row *x pins to those on the bottom row. Internally, *x pins are connected as follows: *1 ............ STIC pin 7 *2 ............ STIC pin 6 *3 ............ STIC pin 8 There may be other connections to them as well; I don't know why they connect to the ROM pins. However, considering the system changer's ability to route in external video, having pins going to the STIC seems to make some sense. I suspect that they may switch the ROM from address write mode to data read mode (like the three bus control lines on the CPU, maybe). Mapping this to the ROM pinouts, you get: +-------------------+ VCC ---+ 1 28 +--- STIC pin 7 | | NC ---+ 2 27 +--- STIC pin 6 | | NC ---+ 3 26 +--- STIC pin 8 | | D15 ---+ 4 25 +--- D0 | | NC ---+ 5 24 +--- D1 | | D14 ---+ 6 23 +--- D2 | | D13 ---+ 7 22 +--- NC | | D12 ---+ 8 21 +--- D3 | | D11 ---+ 9 20 +--- D4 | | D10 ---+ 10 19 +--- D5 | | NC ---+ 11 18 +--- NC | | D9 ---+ 12 17 +--- D6 | | D8 ---+ 13 16 +--- D7 _____ | | MSYNC ---+ 14 15 +--- GND +-------------------+ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Please note that the chapter mentioned above has all opcode and register info, as well as timing information for the CP1600/1600A/1610 CPUs. 2.3 - Graphics Specs -------------------- 160x92 pixels, 16 colors, 8 sprites (they were called \"moving objects\" rather than sprites). I don't recall the sprite size -- I think it was 16x16. Sprites could be drawn with oversize pixels (I think they could be linearly doubled or quadrupled, but again, memory is hazy). Graphics is character based. The screen is twelve rows of twenty characters. Characters either come from Graphics ROM (GROM), which contains the usual alphanumeric symbols and a bunch of other things meant to be useful in drawing backgrounds (256 characters in all), or Graphics RAM (GRAM), which the program can use to build pictures needed that aren't in GROM (like sprite images). GRAM can hold 64. The pre-designed sprites located in ROM were a big help in speeding up gameplay. (Now that I think about it, maybe sprites were 8x16 -- I don't recall them taking up 4 pictures in GRAM -- but two seems reasonable). Eight of the colors are designated as the primary colors. The other eight are called the pastel colors. There were two graphics modes: Foreground/Background, and Color Stack. In F/B mode, you specify the colors for both the on and off pixels of each card (\"card\" is the term for a character on the screen). One of these (the on pixels, I think) could use any color, but the other could only use the primary colors. In CS mode, you can give the chip a circular list of four colors (pastels and primaries are both allowed). For each card, you specify the ON bits color from any of the 16 colors, and the OFF bits color comes from the next color on the circular list. You can also tell if the list is to advance or not. Thus, in CS mode, you only get four colors for the OFF bits, and they have to be used in a predetermined order, but you get to use the pastels. Most games used CS mode. I seem to recall that a sprite could be designated as either being in front of or behind the background, which determined priority when it overlapped the ON pixels of a background image. You could tell the graphics chip to black out the top row or the first column (or both) of cards. You could also tell it to delay the display by up to the time of seven scan lines, or to delay the pixels on each scan line by up to seven pixel times. Using these two features together allows for smooth scrolling. For example, a game that is going to scroll a lot sideways could black out the first row. Now, to scroll the background to the right by one pixel, you just have to delay by one pixel time. This moves everything over. The black part is NOT delayed -- that is always displayed in the first 8 screen pixel locations. The net result is that you now see one pixel that was previously hidden under the black strip, and one pixel on the other side has fallen of the edge, and everything appears to have moved over. Thus, to scroll, you only have to move the screen memory every eighth time, when things need to be shifted a full card. There is no need for a bitblt-type operation. The hardware detected collisions between sprites and other sprites or the background. GRAM and (I think) screen memory could only be manipulated during vertical retrace. At the end of vertical retrace, you had to tell the chip if it should display or not. If you weren't done, you could keep manipulating by not telling it to display, but then you end up with a flicker. Unacceptable. 2.4 - Operating System Specs ---------------------------- The operating system did several things: - It allowed the program to specify a veloc for each sprite. The OS would deal with adjusting the sprite position registers for you and cycling through your animation sequence. - For each pair of sprites you could specify a routine to be called when that pair of sprites collided. For each sprite, you could specify a routine to be called when that sprite hit the background or the edge of the screen. - It maintained timers, and allowed you to specify routines to be called periodically. - It dealt with the controls. You could specify routines to be called when the control disc was pressed or released, or when buttons were pressed or released. It provided functions to read numbers from the keypad. The calling sequence for these were a bit strange. When you called these, they saved the return address, then did a return. You had to call them with nothing after your return address on the stack, and they return to your caller. When the number is ready, they return to after where you called them, but as an interrupt. In generic assembly, it would be like this (I've long since forgotten 1600!): jsr foo bar: ... ... foo: ;do some setup or whatever jsr GetNumberFromKeypad spam: ... GetNumberFromKeypad returns to bar immediately. When the number is read, spam will be called from an interrupt handler. If you didn't know that a routine did this, reading code could get rather confusing! 3.0) Hardware Descriptions: ============================ 3.1 - Intellivision Master Component ------------------------------------ The original, the one the started it all. It has a brown molded plastic case with gold trim on the top. Two controller wells are recessed in the top for housing the two hard-wired controllers. The controllers are also brown molded plastic, with a 12-key numeric keypad, two fire buttons located on each side, and a gold disk centered in the bottom third of the controller which is used to control your on-screen persona. The power and reset switches are located on the top of the unit, in the lower right hand corner: (Top View) _||_ _|_ Power Cable --+|| |+-- RF Cable || | ================================= | || | ---------------------------- || | /\\ .... | | .... /\\ || | \\/ .... | | .... \\/ || | ---------------------------- || | [ ][|] || ================================= ^ ^--- Power Switch |--- Reset Switch 3.2 - Sears Super Video Arcade ------------------------------ Up until recently, if you wanted to market your product through Sears, it had to have their name on it. Much like Atari with the Tele-Games Video Arcade, Mattel created a clone that was similar yet different to the INTV I. Functionally identical, this unit has a cream-colored case with a wood-grain front, and removable controllers that rest in the center of the console. The power and reset switches are circular in shape and about an inch in diameter: (Top View) _||_ _|_ Power Cable --+|| |+-- RF Cable || | ================================= | || | ---------------------------- || | |... |... | || | |... |... | || |__________| /\\ | /\\ |_/-\\_/-\\_|| | | \\/ | \\/ | \\-/ \\-/ || ================================= ^ ^--- Power Switch |--- Reset Switch 3.3 - Radio Shack Tandyvision I ------------------------------- Yet another clone, this console has faux wood-grain (what was it with videogames and woodgrain in the early eighties??) paneling in the place of the INTV I's gold panels. Otherwise, this unit is totally identical to the INTV I. 3.4 - GTE / Sylvania Intellivision ---------------------------------- Still another clone, this console is identical to the original Intellivision except for the brand name. The box has a very detailed description of the Computer Adapter that was never released... Rumor has it that these were given away for free with the purchase of a Sylvania television. 3.5 - Bandai Intellivision -------------------------- Although released domestically in 1980, the Intellivision's Japanese debut was over two years later, on July 10, 1982. However, Mattel did not market or distribute the system in Japan. Instead, they turned to Bandai, a trusted name in electronics to handle the system in Japan. Thus the Bandai Intellivision was born. Bandai had been in the electronic game business for many years in Japan, starting off with a very successful electronic hand held Baseball game in the 70's. In 1977, Bandai released its own electronic video game system, the TV-Jack series (a video game console with burnt-in games and no cartridge support). The system was successful, spawning multiple upgrades, but it was abandoned after its final release (TV-Jack Supervision 8000) in 1979. This deal to distribute and market the system in Japan between the two companies was the first of its kind for Bandai, and arguably the first sophisticated (especially 16-bit) console release in the Japanese market. From a certain standpoint, it was successful enough and impelled Bandai to forge similar deals for the Emerson Arcadia (March 1983) and Vectrex (July 1983) in Japan. Interestingly enough, this meant that Bandai was simultaneously distributing and marketing three video game systems in Japan. Marketed as a game system that had the 16-bit power of a personal computer, it had a considerable power advantage over the other Japanese systems at that time. Take a look at the similar releases at that time: 1979/10 Epoch Cassette Video Game (8bit) 57,300 yen retail * 1981/07 Epoch CassetteVision (4bit) 13,500yen retail 1982/06 Bandai Intellivision (16bit) 49,800 yen retail 1982/09 Magnovox Odyssey 2 (8bit) 49,800 yen retail 1982/10 Tomy Pyu-Inu Computer (16bit computer) 59,800 yen retail 1982/11 Takara Game Computer (8bit) 59,800 yen retail 1982/11 Yamagawa Dynavision (16bit) 34,800 yen retail The bigger names would come in the next year. 1983 saw the introduction of the true Japanese console video game systems, and Atari International also re- released the 2600 as the Atari 2800 in May. Although the Atari 2600 saw a limited released in 1977 as the Epoch Cassette Video Game*, Atari distributed the 2800 itself this time. However, it was too little too late for either of them, as Sega and especially Nintendo had quickly became incredibly popular and controlled most of the video game market. Here is a look at the major releases for 1983: 1983/3 Bandai Arcadia (8bit) 19,800 yen retail 1983/5 Atari 2800 (Atari International Japan Inc.) (8bit) 24,800 yen retail 1983/7 Nintendo Famicom (8bit) 14,800 yen retail 1983/7 Sega SG-1000 (8bit) 15,000 yen retail 1983/7 Epoch Cassettevision Jr. (4bit) 5,000 yen retail 1983/7 Bandai Vectrex (8bit) 54,800 yen retail Mattel's own problems back in America and the collapse of the American video game market probably led to the abandonment of greater support for the Intellivision. Moreover, the Intellivision had difficulties competing with the new, cheap and powerful Nintendo and Sega systems. In the end, although Mattel had helped increase the awareness and popularity to start the first generation video game console market in Japan, it did not last once the large homegrown Japanese companies took hold. Since Bandai was also busy marketing the Emerson Arcadia and Vectrex in Japan, it left little support for the flagging Intellivision. There was a large number of systems--too many for the flowering market. In the end, none of these foreign systems (including the Intellivision) made a large footprint in the video game industry in Japan. Marketing / Distribution of the Bandai Intellivision ---------------------------------------------------- As stated before, Mattel did not handle the marketing and distribution of the Intellivision in Japan. It was handled by Bandai, who drummed up support for the system in all the standard media. There were even some television commercials produced for the Intellivision in Japan. A young actor named Beat Takeshi (who later became a very popular TV and movie actor) was used in the commercials. They advertised the console with the slogan \"Same 16-bit power as a computer, but no loading times\". Similar to the Atari distribution in Japan, the games themselves were untouched. But, in the case of Intellivision, even the boxes remained completely in English. On these boxes, the franchise rights were removed. So, Major League Baseball became Baseball, etc. Of course, a Japanese instruction booklet was provided to inform the customer the basic controls and how to play. The overlays were also identical to the American ones and remained in English. Slits were cut in the back of the boxes for the Japanese instructions. So, if the customers flipped over the box, they saw the front page of the Japanese instructions. The box for the base console in Japan was remade completely. It had the pictures of all the games with a picture of a happy couple playing the Intellivision in the right hand corner. On the back, it described the system and showed pictures of Baseball, Space Battle, etc. Inside the box, there was an instruction manual, warranty card and two promotional catalogs. The first catalog showed the launch titles, while the second one listed the games that were coming soon. The box and all of its contents were in Japanese. The console itself remains identical to the Intellivision I, save a few differences. The upper gold plate on the top of the Intellivision has the words Bandai Intellivision printed on it. There are also two Bandai stickers on the bottom of the unit. Furthermore, the channel switch was changed to Ch1 and Ch2. It is generally assumed that Bandai was skeptical at the start, and didn't want to invest a large amount of money in translating and re-printing the boxes especially since this was their first time at distributing another company's system. But, in the end it was just another nail in the coffin for the system. The popularity of the games was limited. The low-cost approach of distribution left customers anxious over a system with games almost completely in another language. The retail price of the system was 49800 yen ($210, in 1982 US$). The games themselves cost from 4800-5500yen ($21-23 in 1982 US$). However, for a 16-bit system at the time, Bandai thought that it was an attractive price. Plus, the lineup of games at the start was large (including many sports titles). There were 17 launch games, most of them sports and popular titles from America. However, the price ended up being too steep for the base console, and it never became very popular--a key to success in Japan. Similar to North America and Atari, the Intellivision had the power to compete at the start with the other consoles, but failed to remain on top. But, in Japan, it was priced the same as a personal computer. Since it lacked the additional functionality of the computer, it never really caught on. In a way, Bandai's slogan of comparing it to a personal computer only highlighted its faults. The Intellivoice module nor any other hardware upgrades were ever released. Furthermore, no Japanese specific software was ever released. In total, only 27 (Mattel only) known titles were released in Japan. Overall, approximately 30,000 units of the base system were sold in total and two years after it was born, Bandai abandoned the system and the Bandai Intellivision faded into obscurity. Bandai Intellivision Frequently Asked Questions: ------------------------------------------------ Q: How did the properties and rights to NHL, NBA, MLB, NASL, etc. transfer to Japan? A: It is an interesting question. Since the rights to the games were not transferable when Mattel sold the rights to the INTV Corporation, it is doubtful that they were transferable to Bandai. But, it is unknown whether there was any real infringement or legal action taken by any of the respective companies. All of the boxes in Japan did not carry any franchise rights, except for PBA bowling. But, there seemed to be some confusion because on the back of the box, and in the game catalogs, many of the games appear with licensing. Even the cartridges and the manuals have licensing. Q: Any plans for any specific software titles for the Japanese market? A: Doubtful. The Intellivision did not last a significant amount of time. The time and costs involved in developing Japanese specific titles would have been significant. Furthermore, Bandai did not have a large software division, nor did it see the gains necessary to invest in one for the Intellivision. Other software houses in Japan, especially Sega and Nintendo were concentrating on their own launches. It seems that Bandai didn't court any other software companies to produce games for the Intellivision. Q: Any plans for INTV to re-enter the Japanese market? A: Highly doubtful. By the time that INTV re-assembled the Intellivision name, and started selling software again, Nintendo and Sega were dominating the Japanese market. Any attempt to re-enter would have been futile. Furthermore, the secret to INTV's short success in North America was through significant cost-cutting and completing Mattel's unfinished games. They would require substantial capital to re-start the Intellivision engine in Japan. Q: I look at the list of games, and I don't see Astrosmash, what gives? A: Yes. It never made it here. Probably because it debuted in 1982, the Space Invaders craze was over by then. Bandai didn't want to promote an older game, and concentrated on the more unique titles. Furthermore, they already chose Space Armada as a launch title. As for why Space Armada was chosen over Astrosmash, who knows? Q: Can I play US games in a Bandai Intellivision? A: The games released in Japan are identical to the American ones. There is no region lockout because there is only one region. Therefore, the Bandai can play games from any regional market, just like any Intellivision. 3.6 - Intellivoice Voice Synthesis Module ----------------------------------------- This module attaches to the cartridge port of your Intellivision, and through the use of special voice-enhanced games, your INTV could talk. There were 5 games released to take advantage of the unit's capabilities (Space Spartans, B-17 Bomber, Tron Solar Sailor, Bomb Squad, and World Series Major League Baseball (also requires the ECS) ). The module has a dial on the front to control the voice's volume. Voice games will work without the adapter, but since the voice was made to be an integral portion of the game, they're extremely difficult to play. Underneath the plastic Mattel Electronics logo on the top is an expansion connector. Everyone pop the cover off and make sure it's there? =) 3.7 - Intellivision II ---------------------- In 1982, Mattel decided that they needed to spice up the design of the Intellivision, as well as attempt to shave some costs; the Intellivision II was the result. Some key differences include: - A much smaller footprint - Grey plastic case with a thin red stripe circling the unit - External power supply (not standard by any means) - Detachable controllers (although the fire buttons on these controllers are nearly impossible to use, and darn uncomfy =) ) - Combination Power/Reset switch (probably the most annoying feature of all, you have to hold the switch for 5 seconds in order to turn the unit off) - Power LED Indicator (Top View) ============================ | || ... || ... || | || ... || ... || | || ... || ... || | ___ || ... || ... || Power LED Ind.--+| * | | || /\\ || /\\ || | |___| || \\/ || \\/ || ============================ ^--- Power / Reset Switch This unit contained a revised ROM which was necessary for the System Changer (more on that later), but also caused incompatibilities with certain Coleco games and some Mattel games (Donkey Kong, Mouse Trap, and Carnival DEFINITELY do not work, Chess is a maybe). This unit also used a non-standard AC Adapter, making it near impossible to find a replacement at your local Radio Shack. For those who are handy enough to construct their own, here are the specs: Input: 120V 60Hz 25 Watts Output: 16.7V AC 1.0A 3.8 - INTV System III (Model #3504) ----------------------------------- In 1984, the vice president of marketing for Mattel Electronics bought the rights to the Intellivision and formed a company called INTV Corp. The result of this venture was the release of the INTV III, or Super Pro System. This redesigned unit is physically identical to the original INTV I, except that it has a black plastic case with silver plates, and also has a Power LED indicator between the Power and Reset switches. The controllers are black with silver discs, and the keypads were either silver with black lettering or black with silver lettering. 3.9 - Computer Adaptor ---------------------- This unit only saw a limited test marketing run of less than one thousand units in late 1981. It was color-keyed to match the INTV I, and the entire game console fit into the top of the unit. It sported a full-stroke 60-key keyboard, built in cassette recorder, and brought the total memory capacity of the Intellivision to 64K. A modem expansion module was also planned. Due to it's high street price (around $700, versus an announced price of $150), the plans to market this unit nationally were shelved. 3.10 - Entertainment Computer System ----------------------------------- Spurred on by the increasingly popular home computer market, Mattel introduced the Entertainment Computer System along with the INTV II in 1983. This unit plugs into the cartridge port of the INTV II, and has its own cartridge slot, two additional controller ports, a cassette interface, and a balance dial for controlling the output level of the ECS's three additional voices. The unit requires an additional power supply. Here again, Mattel used something completely different from the rest of the industry: Input: Output: 10.0 VAC, 1.0 A The ECS came packaged with a 49-key chiclet-style keyboard, power supply, and a well-written manual describing INTV BASIC. Upon returning your registration card, you would receive \"The Step-By-Step Guide To Home Computing\", which included a very detailed BASIC Tutorial, and some more in-depth study of the ECS's abilities. For the techies, the unit sported an additional voice chip (bringing the grand total to 6), 10K of ROM and 2K of RAM for programming purposes. This unit comes in two flavors, the grey mentioned above, and also a dark brown color keyed to the original Intellivision. Functionally, the units are identical. The dark brown variety is extremely difficult to find. Expansions announced for this unit include a 16K RAM, 8K ROM expansion, a 32K RAM, 12K ROM expansion, data recorder, and a 40 column thermal printer. None of these peripherals ever made it to market. 3.11 - Music Synthesizer ------------------------ This was an add-on for the ECS, a full 49 key piano style keyboard. It has 6 note polyphony (for you non-musicians, can play 6 notes at once), and plugs into the controller ports on the ECS via a dual 9 pin connector. Melody Blaster was the only program released by Mattel to specifically take advantage of this component. This unit also came molded either in light gray or dark brown plastic. Although they are both pretty tough to find, the brown variety is extremely rare. 3.12 - System Changer --------------------- The Atari 2600 had the biggest library of games at the time, and Mattel added the capability of playing 2600 carts to the INTV II with this module. This unit also interfaces with the INTV II via the cartridge port. It has a cartridge port on the top of the module, Game Select and Reset keys flanking the two difficulty and color/BW switch: (Top View) ________________________ | _____________ | Legend: | | _ _ | | ______| |_____________| | 1 - Game Select | | 2 - Left Difficulty | +--- To INTV | 3 - Color / BW Switch |_______ ___________________ | 4 - Right Difficulty | | 1 |2|3|4| 5 | | 5 - Game Reset | |_____|_|_|_|_____| | |_______________________| The controller ports are located on the front of the module, and any of your favorite 2600 compatible controllers work just fine. If you don't happen to have Atari controllers lying around, you can use the disc controller attached to the INTV II in lieu of them. If you happened to own an original Intellivision, sending in your Master Component and $19.95 would get you a ROM upgrade that was required for this unit to work with the older equipment. 3.13 - Joystick Substitutes --------------------------- For the masses who couldn't stand to use the Intellivision's awful disc controllers, there were a couple solutions: - INTV Corp. released a set of clip-on Joysticks which snapped onto the lower half of your controller, these are of questionable quality and value: _______ / \\ |-------| ________________________ \\_______/ | | | | | _________ | | | | / \\ | | | (Side View) | ( (INTV) ) | | | | \\_________/ | ___________| |___________ | | | _________| |_________ | |_______________________| | | ____| |____ | | | |_ ----------- _| | (Top View) |___| |___| - A couple of other companies released sticks that either glued onto the existing discs, or replaced the disc entirely, with a shaft that screwed into a hole drilled into the center of the replacement disc. One of these add-ons also came with oversized fire buttons that clipped over the existing buttons. 3.14 - Compro Electronics (CEI) Videoplexer (model #M800) --------------------------------------------------------- Tired of switching between your 8 favorite games? Get a Videoplexer! Similar to the RomScanner for the Atari 2600, this unit would store 8 Intellivision games and allow you to switch them on the fly via a touch panel on the front of the unit. The unit plugs into the cartridge port of the base system, and on top there are slots for up to eight cartridges. At the base of the Videoplexer, there are 8 buttons for switching between the cartridges. 3.15 - PlayCable ---------------- The idea of beaming Junior videogames through Cable TV is not new; a company called PlayCable created an adapter for the Intellivision that plugged into the cartridge port, and the service would have had a selection of 20 of the most popular games available every month. Steven Roode and his brother were fortunate enough to have this service, and what follows is his description of the hardware and the service provided: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When you signed up for PlayCable, you were given a box which would plug into the Intellivision's (INTV's) cartridge port. The box had the same color scheme as an INTV I, and it's dimensions were the same height and depth of the INTV I, with the length of an INTV II. It had a power cord coming out of it. Additionally, you were given a RF box which had a coaxial in, a coaxial out, and two RCA outs. One RCA out was connected to the INTV, and one was connected to the PlayCable unit. The setup looked roughly like this: Cable In | | ----------- | ----+ | +--- RF Box ----------- |_||_||_| ______________| T | | V | | | ================================================= | || | | ---------------------------- || ------------- | | /\\ .... | | .... /\\ || | | \\/ .... | | .... \\/ || | | ---------------------------- || ------------- | | [ ][|] || | ================================================= Intellivision PlayCable Box For about $4.95 a month, the cable company would transmit 20 games (Although for the first few months, there were only 15 games). When you turned on the INTV, a sort of 'boot screen' would come up and you would hear a sound that sort of sounded like a clock ticking. After a couple of seconds, you would hear 4 long beeps and the PlayCable title screen would pop up. There would be one of four different songs in the background (I know that one was the victory song in checkers, one was The Entertainer, one was Music Box Dancer, and I forget the other one). Each screen listed 5 games (I think, it may have been 4), and you could cycle through the games lists by pressing the disc. When you found the game that you wanted, you would press the number next to it, and press enter. A title screen of the game would pop up, and again you would hear ticking. After a couple of seconds, you would hear the same 4 long beeps and the game would be ready to play. The following are excerpts from a PlayCable-specific game manual describing the game loading process: ============================================================================== HOW TO SELECT YOUR FAVORITE GAME FROM PLAYCABLE: - Set the PlayCable TV/Game switch to GAME. - Turn on your television and turn to Channel 3 or 4. (The same setting as the switch on the bottom of the Mattel Electronics Master Component.) - Turn on the Master Component; push the RESET button. - The screen will read, \"PLAYCABLE CATALOG.\" The screen will then change to: \"PLAYCABLE PRESENTS INTELLIVISION. PUSH DISC.\" - Push the directional disc (the big, round button on either hand control) to see each page of the catalog. The series will start again automatically as you keep pushing the disc. - To call up a game, find the page on which the game appears. Press the number of the game on your keypad, then press ENTER. Wait about 10 seconds. When the four rectangles in the upper left hand corner of your screen turn white, your game is ready. - Push the disc again and the game will appear. - To select a new game, push RESET. The catalog will re-appear. =============================================================================== One of the neater aspects of PlayCable was that they would rotate out about half of the games every month. When they did, you would get instruction books and overlays for each new game in the mail (and all of the overlays were attached with perforations; so you would have to sort of tear them apart). PlayCable tended to have some pretty decent games on it. You would always have a couple of the 'classics' every month (i.e., I don't think Baseball and Astrosmash ever came off!), and you would get some pretty recent games as well. Once in a while they were slow in changing the games. They were supposed to be rotated out on the 1st of each month. Believe me, my brother and I would fake sick to stay home from school sometimes on the 1st! If by noon they weren't changed, we would call the cable company and by the end of the day they were updated (One other neat little side note: When they changed the games out, the system would still be up. First, all game choices would disappear. Then, two by two, new games would pop up. You could actually see them appear!) We had PlayCable for about two years (I think 81-82), and our cable company was big into promoting it. They had INTV playathons at some of the local malls, giving away free INTVs to high scorers in certain games. During one promotional weekend, the cable company showed nothing but people playing INTV and the announcers commenting on how realistic the gameplay was. I think we even have one PlayCable T-shirt lying around somewhere! Finally though, our cable company stopped carrying PlayCable, and unfortunately, we had to surrender the box. I would liked to have kept it to see how it worked. All in all, our family has a lot of fond memories of PlayCable... I think it helped to enhance the uniqueness and mystery of the Intellivision. 3.16 - Intellivision Tester (IMI Tester MTE-100) ------------------------------------------------ This was a rather large metal briefcase that technicians could use to diagnose broken Intellivision systems. It consisted of joysticks mounted into the unit, and a variety sockets, switches, plugs and dials that would monitor and report the status of the Intellivision and its cartridges. It included an integrated MTE-201 Test Cartridge into the system and once opened, revealed a regular 2609 Intellivision motherboard and the diagnostic cartridge hooked together. Obviously, this was never released and sold to the public. Thanks to INTV Funhouse for the info. 4.0) Cartridge Listing: ======================== 4.1 - Released Titles --------------------- This list contains information from VGR'S Giant List of Intellivision games, Sean Kelly's list, Paul Thurrott's List, and some information I have gleaned from personal experience.

You lose 1 man, but gain it back with the easier play of the 1st building. Bump 'n' Jump ------------- There is a secret road, just jump off to the side and land out of view. Sword & Serpents ---------------- On the 4th level, don't read the nearby scroll, it's a trap! To 'win' you either have the wizard do a bunch of Destroy Wall spells to get through the back or top or bottom side of the big room that the dragon is in, OR in one player mode, you have to walk through the corners of the successive walls (in the back of the big room). If you don't know what I'm talking about, practice on the lower levels by walking diagonally, into the outside of the corner of a wall. Once inside the dragon's lair, walk around and pick up a few neat goodies and be careful not to get killed by black knights and evil wizards (was there anything else that could kill you?) If you walk around enough, the programmer's initials will appear. Truckin' -------- There is a secret road to take you to Imagic's headquarters! Basically, you have to find the path to the old Imagic HQ in Los Gatos, CA. Having a road map (such as Rand McNally) helps, since the route does not show up on the map in the instruction booklet. If not, the following directions will suffice: (1) From the title screen, press 1-1-8-1. This takes the defaults and gives you a full tank of gas, heading northbound out of San Diego. A no-load, timed contest. (2) Accelerate, but stay below 24 MPH, in order to make the necessary turns. (3) Make the 1st left onto I-10, heading eastbound to LA. (4) Keep going east, straight towards the coast. I-10 will end and you will automatically be turned north to Hollywood (HO) on US#01 (actually 101). (5) Stay due north through Santa Cruz (SZ). (6) As soon as you approach San Jose (SJ), look for the 1st left. Turn here. (7) You are now on Route 9 eastbound. A little ways on this road and youve found it! The road will show the Imagic sign off into the horizon. The SJ city code will change into RL (for Rick Levine). You can also see this coming from the opposite direction. Code taken from The Digital Press (http://www.digitpress.com) Triple Action ------------- Choose the tanks game and at the beginning of the screen take the red tank and drive up to the blue tank and face it head on (about an inch away). Now take the Blue Tank and do a 180 turn (Don't move the tank forward or backward at all). The blue tank should be facing the left side of your T.V. with the red tank looking at it's behind. Now move the red tank forward and into the blue tank as far as it will go and stop there. Now using the disc, turn the red tank to the 1:00 position, which should look like this: / Now the idea here is to be partly on __/_ the blue tank while facing away from it XXXXXXXX / / and hitting the SIDE Button really quick ------IIII / - / \"Not the FIRE Button but the 'move forward XXXXXXXX __/ quick' button. The Tank (red) should, with a ghostly floating effect, sail off to the right of the screen. It will also go through the barriers and eventually off the screen. From then on give the blue tank control to a friend and you'll be conveniently hidden off screen while he tries to find you. Try practicing this one awhile as it takes a bit of tweaking to get it just right. After you do get it, try playing with the bullets, shooting them off screen and in between walls and barriers. Heck, see if you and a friend can get both tanks to sail off at the same time. It might work too. General INTV games ------------------ Several INTV releases will display the game's credits if you press 0 on the title screen: Body Slam Super Pro Wrestling Chip Shot Super Pro Golf Super Pro Football Hover Force Slam Dunk Super Pro Basketball Tower of Doom Several others simply display the credits if you leave the title screen up long enough: Diner Monster Truck Rally (Stadium Mud Buggies) Mountain Madness Super Pro Skiing Super Pro Decathlon Slap Shot Super Pro Hockey They didn't document the \"press 0\" trick, but they didn't want to make it hard to find. What you *aren't* supposed to find is the Chip Shot programmer's secret message to his family: press 23 (2 and 3 at the same time) on the left hand controller and 26 on the right hand controller and press reset. 4.7 - Information regarding Unreleased Titles & Hardware -------------------------------------------------------- Most of the information provided here was posted to the general net populace courtesy of the Blue Sky Rangers and Keith Robinson. For more information, screenshots, etc. check out http://intellivisionlives.com. ALBUM CARTRIDGES - due to the falling prices of RAM, more games could be fit on to one single cartridge. This spawned the Album Cartridges which where generally collections of old or simple games. There were 3 known Album Cartridges: HAPPY HOLIDAYS: - Three holiday-inspired games in one: Santa's Helper, Easter Eggcitement, and Trick-Or-Treat. PARTY LINE: - Another Album cartridge. Collections of party games. GO FOR THE GOLD: - After spending millions of dollars to secure the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics licensing, they repackaged old sports titles and threw on a title screen. SAILING: - A planned game that fell apart in the transition to design due to creative differences. Basic design only and unfinished. AIRSTRIKE: - A side-scrolling game of bombing enemy sites. Unfinished but playable on the Intellivision Lives emulator. HYPNOTIC LIGHTS: - From a neat graphical effect, a puzzle game was to be born, alas it wasn't. OFF THE WALL: - An arcade-type game to save the humans and kill the green enemies scaling the walls. Unfinished. AIR RAIDERS: - The Intellivision's version of the 2600 title. Unfinished. GRID SHOCK: - Unreleased but playable on the Intellivision Lives emulator. ADVENTURES OF TRON: - Unreleased version of the 2600 title. COMPUTER CORRIDOR: - An attempted merger of two developing games, Moon Corridor and Computer's Revenge. Shelved before completion. TARGET ANDROMEDA: - A space version of Dungeons and Dragons that never saw the light of day. SPEED FREAK: - Neither Mattel nor INTV did this as an Intellivision game (INTV may have included this in a list of \"upcoming\" games, but no work was ever done on it). Mattel did do a handheld version. SPACE SHUTTLE: - Mattel did a Space Shuttle Intellivoice game that was unfinished when we were shut down in Jan '84. Only the prototypes exist. Activision also did a Space Shuttle game, but I don't know the status of their Intellivision version of it. SCARFINGER: - A spy movie-story with no gameplay and flashy screens that didn't make it past the prototype phase. SPINA THE BEE: - Control the bee to collect the pollen. It was judged unappealing and canned. ILLUSIONS: - Same as the Colecovision title, but never released on the Intellivision. DIG DUG: - Dig Dug was programmed at Atari, but it was still being debugged at the time they discontinued releasing Intellivision games. It was debugged and released first through INTV. (#9005) POLE POSITION: - Produced for and released by INTV. (#9004) DEFENDER: - INTV did sell it, but it was first released by Atarisoft. FROGGER: - Again, INTV sold it, but it was a Parker Brothers release. YOGI'S ADVENTURE: - A Hanna Barbera licensed title that remained unreleased. BASKETBALL II: - An update of NBA Basketball with one more player per side. SUPER NASL SOCCER: - In the works at Mattel for the Entertainment Computer System when we were closed; the game was completed for INTV and released as a regular Intellivision cartridge under the name World Cup Soccer. MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE II - Engine reincorporated into Diner, and later released by INTV. FLASHLIGHT: - Basic development only PIZZATIME: - The planned sequel to BurgerTime before Mattel closed. ROCKY & BULLWINKLE: - An unreleased Mattel game, only prototypes exist. MAGIC CARPET - Pilot a magic carpet. Basic design only. HYDRO PLANE - A speed racing-planned game based off of a graphical effect of racing on a lake. Prototype Intellivoice (white / Matching Intellivision II): - It was a carved, painted block of wood for the photos. No working prototypes were made. 4.8 - Information regarding Label & Box Variations -------------------------------------------------- There are 4 main \"distributors\" of the Intellivision games though we tend to call them manufacturers. For instance, Atarisoft manufactured the INTV versions of the Atari titles as well as the Atarisoft release versions. The 4 \"distributors\" are: - Mattel, the original \"manufacturer\" of the Intellivision. - INTV, the company that was formed and bought out the Mattel rights to Intellivision products. - Sears/Telegames which distributed Intellivision games and systems under their own names. - Telegames, which is still in business and which owns many of the rights (if not all) to the Intellivision games. Their games are most likely manufactured by CBS Electronics in Italy, though not all are. The games originally manufactured to be distributed by Mattel have a (c) MI or (c) MEI on the label. These are the only types of labels known to have been sold by Mattel. Sealed INTV boxes (yes INTV boxes were different, though, like the cartridges, they also used the leftover Mattel boxes) have been found (frequently) with 3 types of labeled games in them: 1. (c) II, white label 2. (c) MI 3. (c) MEI 4. no copyright or country of origin, colored label 5. no copyright but with a country of origin, colored label 6. no copyright or country of origin, white label The (c) II is the closest thing to being a \"regular\" INTV release, but not complete proof. Sears/Telegames released games in specially designed boxes which are quite easy to identify. They are a dark reddish brown and clearly say \"Sears/ Telegames\". The labels on the games sold by Sears/Telegames are of several types: 1. no copyright or country of origin, colored label 2. no copyright but with a country of origin, colored label 3. (c) MI 4. (c) MEI Telegames releases are in a variety of boxes, most commonly in a box clearly identified as \"Telegames\". They can still be purchased from Telegames, UK. There are a variety of labels on these games, but the most common, and the closest to \"official\" Telegames releases are a white label with no copyright or country of origin on them. The following labels have been found in Telegames boxes. 1. no copyright or country of origin, white label 2. All of the above varieties. There may be a way of telling the White Label, no (c), no country of origin INTV games from the White Label Telegames in some cases as there tends to be two distinct styles and sizes of lettering used. The bottom line is: You can't tell who sold or manufactured the games themselves in most cases except: - If it is (c) MI or (c) MEI it was manufactured for Mattel - If it is (c) II it was manufactured for INTV The boxes were manufactured for the company (one of the 4 above) and can be identified as they are clearly marked. They were not necessarily sold by the same companies. Keith Robinson had this to add on the subject of labels and boxes: : Q: I recently came across a pile of Intellivision carts with white labels : only and was wondering if anybody out there knew the scoop on them. : Are they any rarer than the colored versions? The manuals also are : in B&W only, not like the ones I already have. Any help would be much : appreciated. Thanks!! Pretty cheesy, huh? I was in charge of printing those; Terry Valeski contracted with me to provide all the packaging for the INTV Corporation releases. He wanted costs as low as possible, so overlays were eliminated where possible (Mattel's policy was that every game had to have overlays, even if they weren't really needed, such as for Pinball; Valeski got rid of them), manuals became black & white (folded, not stapled) and labels were printed on whatever stock my printer had leftover and would give me a price break on. That's why you'll find different size labels on different copies of the same game. Of course, INTV didn't invent this cost cutting. Mattel's Intellivision packaging went downhill quickly, too. The original boxes opened like a book and had a plastic tray the cartridge fit into. Manuals were all full color. The plastic tray was the first thing to go, then the manuals went to two-color, then the boxes simply became boxes (some games, like BurgerTime, were released in both versions of the boxes). At INTV, we printed the boxes on an even cheaper grade of cardboard, but at least Valeski wanted them to be colorful. I designed most of them with an art budget of about $800 per box. A painter named Steve Huston did the Super Pro sports covers and I did most of the cartoony covers (Thin Ice, Learning Fun I & II). Other artists and photographers did individual titles. I had Joe Ferreira, who did the graphics for Hover Force, do the artwork for the box. And if the cover art for Thunder Castle looks more threatening than the cute graphics in the game, it's because that artwork had been commissioned by Mattel for the Tower of Doom cartridge. Valeski had it used for Thunder Castle since that game was already completed when he bought the Intellivision rights; Tower of Doom was incomplete. He had Tower of Doom finished later and I had to come up with new art for its box. (By the way, look for the number 47 on the INTV boxes; that number is how Pomona College alumni sort of say \"hello\" to each other. Dave Warhol, the Pomona alum who produced these games, asked me to slip a 47 into the art whenever possible. Trivia: another Pomona Alum got onto the staff of Star Trek, which is why the number 47 pops up in most episodes of Next Generation and Voyager, and TWICE in the movie Generations.) Sorry that I can't answer your real question though, namely which labels are worth more. That's a question for the collectors. But remembering how quickly some of this stuff was slapped together, it amuses me today to hear people pondering their value. ..as well as this: : Q: The boxes do not open like the colored ones right? These games were : reproduced by the INTV corporation after they took over from Mattel Mattel had already switched from the book-cover boxes to standard boxes by the time INTV took over. INTV used up Mattel stock, then made up new batches of the most popular games. In these cases, the INTV boxes are identical to the Mattel boxes (printed from the same negatives) except the Mattel Electronics name is deleted and the INTV name and address is added on the back. Major League Baseball also underwent a name change to Big League Baseball, since the Major League trademark either expired or wasn't transferable. All of the INTV games were released in full-color standard boxes, except for a brief period where they tried to get away with no boxes -- sending out mail orders with the cartridge and instructions simply sealed in a plastic bag. Consumers complained -- loudly -- and boxes were quickly reinstated. 5.0) Vaporware, Trivia, and Miscellanea: ========================================= 5.1 - Intellivision III ----------------------- Atari wasn't the only company with plans to introduce a \"next generation\" video game system; Mattel spoke of it's soon-to-be released Intellivision III for well over a year before the idea was dumped. Here are some of the specifications for this unit: - Built-in Intellivoice - 320 x 190 resolution - Unlimited colors - Onscreen sprites move at twice the speed of the original Intellivision - Six channel sound with RCA outputs - Remote controlled joysticks - Four controller ports - Plays original Intellivision titles as well as Aquarius titles - 12k ROM - 10k RAM - Able to manipulate 64 sprites onscreen at once - 6-8 titles announced including Air Ace - a flight simulator - Scrapped for fears of not being able to introduce it before Colecovision and the Atari 5200 had too strong a grip on the \"next generation\" market. - Projected price : $300 Please note that this unit is COMPLETELY different from the INTV III which was later released by INTV Corp in 1986. 5.2 - Intellivision Iv ---------------------- (History taken from http://www.intellivisionlives.com) - After the Intellivision Keyboard Component was canceled, Mattel was to begin work on a brand new Master Component, the Intellivision IV. Intellivision III had been rushed into development simply as a stopgap product to compete short-term with Colecovision. Intellivision IV, was to introduce the next generation of video game systems. It carried the codename Decade, since it was to be the cornerstone product of Mattel Electronics for the rest of the eighties, Intellivision IV was developed from mid-1982 to mid-1983 secretly in an unmarked building a mile away from Mattel headquarters. Being away from the daily whims and pressures of marketing and administration, the design group was able to create freely. The system they created was based on the MC68000 processor, the CPU later used in the first Macintoshes and the Amiga. Video was handled by a custom chip named Magic. Screen resolution was 240 by 192 pixels (40 by 24 4-color 6x8 cards) with a programmable 16-color palette, 16x16 4-color sprites and hardware scrolling. Onboard software supported 3-D graphics along with music and speech synthesis. The Combo chip coordinated peripheral devices, including a built-in modem: a point-of-view two-person tank battle played over phone lines was talked about as a typical Intellivision IV application. Unlike the other hardware in development in 1983, the Intellivision IV had the potential of being a significant step forward; after Intellivision III was canceled, many people saw Intellivision IV as the last hope for the company. The hope didn't last long. Most of the hardware people were soon laid off, including those working on Intellivision IV. The shift didn't help; January 20, 1984, Mattel Electronics was shut down. Would they have succeeded in creating a super game machine at an affordable price, or would it have been another Keyboard Component? With all the secrecy surrounding the project, it's not known how far along the system really was. We do know it never reached the stage of actual game development. 5.3 - INTV Corp. Games ---------------------- INTV enhanced many of the early Mattel titles by adding new features and making them a 1 or 2 player game by adding a computer opponent. Below is a list of the original and enhanced cartridges: ORIGINAL MATTEL CARTRIDGE ---+ ENHANCED INTV CARTRIDGE PGA Golf (Golf) Chip Shot Super Pro Golf Math Fun Learning Fun I Major League Baseball (Baseball) World Championship Baseball NASL Soccer (Soccer) World Cup Soccer NBA Basketball (Basketball) Slam Dunk Super Pro Basketball NFL Football (Football) Super Pro Football NHL Hockey (Hockey) Slap Shot Super Pro Hockey Tennis Championship Tennis US Ski Team Skiing (Skiing) Mountain Madness Super Pro Skiing Word Fun Learning Fun II APBA Backgammon (Backgammon) \\ Checkers (Draughts) >--+ Triple Challenge Chess / 5.4 - Trivia and Fun Facts -------------------------- Have you ever wondered... ...what would happen if you plugged two Intellivoices together and then plugged in an Intellivoice game?? Greg Chance did, and the result goes something like this: \"Someone had asked about daisy-chaining two Intellivoices together, i.e. plug one into the other, and then a speech cart into the 2nd one. Ok, I did this with Space Spartans. The 2nd speech synthesizer kind of canceled stuff out! It said, \"Welcome to (bleeeeehahah)\" and then there wasn't any voice during the game. So that's the answer. :) It doesn't quite work.\" ...what would happen if you tried \"frying\" your Intellivision?? The author wasn't brave enough to try this out on one of his own machines, but Matthew Long relates this childhood memory: \"I did something like it in the early years. I was playing Star Strike. I reset the machine. I then pulled out the cartridge. The screen began flashing through the character ROM. Was really neat when I was 12!\" ...who that strange guy in all of those old Intellivision ads was? That was George Plimpton, ex-athlete and the Intellivision's paid spokesperson between 1980 and 1983. During 1982, Mattel spent in excess of $50 million so that Mr. Plimpton could lampoon the \"unrealistic\" features of the Atari 2600... Little did Mattel know that Coleco would burst their proverbial bubble with the introduction of the Colecovision in June of '82. ...how Mattel produced a large portion of their game library? Many of the original Intellivision games were programmed by college students as part of their computer programming classes. Cheap labor? ...what would happen if you plugged your 2600 System Changer into an un-modified Intellivision I? An unmodified Master Component (unmodified meaning sans ROM upgrade), when turned on with this unit plugged in, reads \"M-Network\" on the title screen. You can hear all the sounds from the 2600 game you have inserted, but no video is displayed, other than this title screen. Ever try playing Blind Combat? ...the best way to store your boxed Intellivision games?? Shane Shaffer has a great suggestion: \"For your boxed games (unopened), try the Multi-Purpose Storage Chest from Metro Corrugated and Packaging Corporation. Style No. 20000 has ODs of 21\" x 12 1/4\" x 8 1/4\", and fits 2 rows of boxed video games perfectly. I forget how many fit in each box, but the height is just big enough, and the width is perfect. I store my 2600, 5200, 7800, and Intellivision boxes in it, and others of the same size will also fit. It comes in 3 colors, Blue, Green, or Red. The fit is absolutely perfect for your boxed games.\" ...what the heck INTV stands for?? Common misconception: INTV is NOT an abbreviation for Intellivision as many people seem to think. INTV is the name of the company that bought the rights to the system and all it's games from Mattel when they decided to leave the market in late 1984. Mattel NEVER referred to it's system as INTV. ...why your Intellivision is prone to overheating?? The chipset which provided the guts of the Intellivision, manufactured by General Instruments, was extremely failure-prone. During the initial production runs, there were sometimes failure rates as high as 50%!! ...what the most popular Intellivision game was? Major League Baseball was an instant \"classic\" and one of the most popular games for the system. The only \"problem\" with this and many other Intellivision games was that they were for 2-players only. ...just how many positions the Intellivision controller can detect? Yes, it is 16 positions!! This control disc was \"revolutionary\" for it's time, allowing for greater control with sports titles, but is also one of the reasons Intellivision never did catch up to the Atari 2600. ...if INTV Corp. produced NES titles? Yes, as William Howald found out when he posted this question, answered swiftly by our friend Keith Robinson: : I just found this... I had no idea that INTV made games for the Nintendo!!! How rare is this? Well, we can't tell you how rare it is, but we can tell you its history: In 1989, INTV planned to move into NES production and distribution so they commissioned Realtime Associates (who developed most of the original INTV games) to produce both an Intellivision and NES version of \"Monster Truck Rally.\" When the game was finished, though, INTV had run out of money and credit to manufacture cartridges, so they sold all rights to the NES version to another company, who finally distributed it in 1990 or 91. So as to give that company an \"exclusive\" on the title, INTV changed the Intellivision version to \"Stadium Mud Buggies.\" \"Monster Truck Rally\" was the only NES title done by INTV. Since INTV turned around and sold the game to another company before securing the rights from Realtime Associates (i.e. paying them), litigation ensued and the INTV/Realtime relationship fell apart. INTV released no more product after \"Stadium Mud Buggies\" (and \"Spiker, Super Pro Volleyball,\" released at the same time). INTV filed for bankruptcy in 1991. Realtime Associates, however, is doing great. They've gone on to produce many NES, SNES, Sega, and GameBoy titles. One of their current hits is \"Bug\" for Saturn. ...if there were 2 or more different versions of the Intellivision II?? Galen Komatsu wondered this, and here are his thoughts on the matter: \"Just noticed differences between the two Intellivision II units I have. We'll call one Ernie and the other Bert. On the front nameplate, Ernie has a more bolder looking black surface, Bert is a bit dulled looking, also Bert has the (R) symbol after 'Intellivision' and 'Mattel Electronics'. Ernie has a red stripe around the perimeter of the unit, Bert, none. Ernie's casing has square corners, Bert's corners are more rounded. The button squares on Ernie have a matte finish while Bert's squares have a more \"glossy\" finish though the areas surrounding the buttons are matte. Looking at the underside labels, the bright orange \"IMPORTANT!\" has \"2609-0090-G1\" in the upper corner, Bert has \"2609-0090\" ... both labels mention eligibility for FREE CARTRIDGE if the unit requires servicing. =^) On the second label, Ernie's looks like: +-----------------------------------------------+ | MATTEL ELECTRONICS (R) Hobby Equipment | | INTELLIVISION (R) II [UL LOGO] | | Model No. 5872 104Z | | FCC ID: BSU9RD5872 | | _______________________________ | ||CAUTION: This is not a toy and | Input Power: | ||is intended for use by or under| 16.2VAC | ||the supervision of adults. | 60HZ | ||_______________________________| 12.8WATTS | | | | Serial No. P3732189 | | MANUFACTURED IN HONG KONG | +-----------------------------------------------+ whereas Bert's is just: +---------------------------+ | MATTEL ELECTRONICS (R) | | INTELLIVISION (R) II | | | | Model No. 5872 | | FCC ID: BSU 9RD5872 | | MANUFACTURED IN HONG KONG | | | | Serial No. P20176594 | +---------------------------+ I haven't cracked Bert open yet so I don't know if there's any internal differences but both refuse to run early Coleco games.\" 6.0) Electronic Resources, Books and Magazines: ================================================ 6.1 - Internet Resources ------------------------ World Wide Web pages: - Blue Sky Rangers Website http://www.intellivisionlives.com/ If anything could be considered an \"official\" source of information on the Intellivision, this is as close as it comes.

Notes: It's a history on the toy industry with a great chapter on video games. It's got detailed information on Atari's downfall but also quite a bit about Mattel and Coleco plus some stories about 3rd party developers. Later in the book it focuses on the industry circa 1988-9.
