The Lynx came out only one year later, and the Game Gear followed a year after that.\n\nThe thing was Nintendo was the only one to consider the whole experience (i.e. battery life) which is why Game Boy flourished while the others were barely historical footnotes (although for Atari's side this was well into the age when they had trouble supporting any platforms at all, after the under-the-radar 7800 and before the disastrous Jaguar).\n\nDeleted member 17210\n\nUser-requested account closure\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n11,569\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#7\n\nCompared to the Lynx, its graphics didn't seem like a miracle. But the Lynx had other issues like a higher price tag and low battery life. The Game Boy was pretty awesome, though for its combination of price, portability, long lasting battery power, and quality game support. I got mine in 1990 and the first games I bought for it were Japanese versions of Burai Fighter Deluxe and TMNT.\n\nThe Lynx came out only one year later,\n\nIt was only around a month later in North America (a few months from the Japanese GB launch).\n\nsrtrestre\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n19,068\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#8\n\nNot really.

Not glamorous but a sign of technological development.\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#11\n\nno. the Gameboy, when looking at it from a specs perspective, was rather underwhelming. there have been systems with color screens and even backlit screens around that time. the switch's concept was even explored around this time with systems like the Turbografix Express\n\nSo you're saying that in 1989 people weren't amazed and thrilled about this? They were just \"oh it's not as powerful as this other machine so nah.\"\n\nBecause I may have been four years old in 89 but I distinctly remember begging for a Game Boy since the idea of having games in my hand was so cool. My older brother most likely appreciated his far more than I did too at the time.\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#12\n\nHell naw, I've seen plenty of documentaries on the matter.

And even though it makes sense to compare it to the NES since it was at the peak of its popularity in the console market at that time, you have to keep in mind that it was well over half a decade old by 1989 and computer technology was progressing at a rapid rate, so even though the Game Boy could equal or exceed the power of the NES components, it was still a very cost effective system for its time for the sake of price and battery life.\n\nFreddeGredde\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n1,942\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#14\n\nIt wasn't black and white, more like different shades of green, and no, I don't think anyone was impressed by it technically.\n\nI did love it though, because I could play it in my own room even though I didn't have a TV.

My older brother most likely appreciated his far more than I did too at the time.\n\nthat's not what I said. it's just wasn't a miracle system. outside of games and battery, it's competitors did everything better. good library and being able to outlast the competition won it the day.\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#19\n\nIts a very good question. The short answer is no - from a marketing standpoint, the gameboy was outpaced by Sega's backlit, full-color GameGear. The Gameboy looked like trash in comparison.\n\nBut, when you looked at the long term value, things changed quickly. 4 AA batteries lasted forever in that thing (compared the the 6 it took to run the gamegear which lasted 2-3 hours), they had higher quality games with a wider selection at a much more affordable price.\n\nIt was not an experience of \"I can't believe this thing exists! Was it made by aliens?\" It was more \"I can't leave the house without it because it works really well and Aunt Felecia's house is the most boring place on Earth.\"\n\nNintendo has always embraced cheaper tech to make their products more accessible to more people.\n\nghostcrew\n\nThe Shrouded Ghost\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n30,794\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#20\n\nTo me, as a kid who'd never played a Mario game and had grown up with Commodore computers, it felt like magic. Playing Super Mario Land and Tetris was just incredible. But more because they were incredible games rather than a technology thing. But yeah, it felt like a huge leap from the game and watch style LCD handheld game things that I'd played before.\n\nAnd, to make something clear, when it first launched it didn't have games with graphics like Pokemon (as that's the first example in your screenshots). It was Tetris, it was Super Mario Land (that looked pretty primitive with tiny sprites and barely any backgrounds). It was Motocross Madness and Tennis. Those later games were absolute marvels compared to the early games.\n\nentremet\n\nYou wouldn't toast a NES cartridge\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n63,422\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#21\n\nNah. The GB was not cutting edge tech. It was designed by Gunpei Yokoi, who was known for his penchant for using older tech and maximizing its utility.\n\nThe Famicom wasn't even that cutting edge and that came out in 83. Nintendo's key focus has always been profitable hardware. It was Sony and then MS that started going the loss leader approach to push better tech.\n\ncatpurrcat\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n7,842\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#22\n\nIt was actually portable, which made a huge difference compared to other devices. Most people were used to carrying walkmans (cassette) anyways.\n\nThen you add in tetris, and excellent marketing including very cool box art for all its games and you have a winner.\n\nNoPiece\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n304\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#23\n\nNot a miracle. It seemed underpowered, and the black and white was pretty lame, even at the time. But like most Nintendo consoles, it was the great games that made it a great platform. At a glance, it looked closer to a Game & Watch in technology level than the stuff like the Lynx and Game Gear that came soon after. Also, Tetris was a huge phenomenon at the time, so it was a massive for GameBoy to have it. I remember going to FAO Schwartz in NYC and they had a bank of GameBoys with Tetris, and there was big line of adults waiting to play. Game Gear blew me away the first time I saw it, but it was unattainable due to price, and probably would have regretted buying it anyway because of the lack of interesting games (to me) on it.\n\nDeleted member 31247\n\nUser requested account closure\n\nNov 6, 2017\n\n113\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#24\n\nEveryone wanted an Atari lynx, way cooler.

Just goes to show the power of the games programmed for it, some of which are miracles in of themselves(Super Mario Land 2, Kirby's Dream Land 2 and 3, the Pokemon games).\n\nentremet\n\nYou wouldn't toast a NES cartridge\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n63,422\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#28\n\nNo, it wasn't magic.

If only the TurboExpress had the same library, that was a truly magical piece of tech.\n\nBattery life.\n\nPeople forget that the lack of power helped with the battery life issue. My cousin had a GameGear and his parent absolutely hated the having to buy batteries for it all the time and they eventually gave up. Then add Nintendo's first party support and it was it was hard thing to compete with.\n\nRemember this was before rechargeable solutions were mainstream.\n\nsteviestar3\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nJul 3, 2018\n\n4,690\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#29\n\nLike everyone else has already said, the specs weren't anything to write home about. But Nintendo's decision to push practicality (battery life) over raw technical power was nothing short of genius and is the reason why the Game Boy was the clear winner of the portable race back then.\n\nMutagenic\n\nOct 30, 2017\n\n2,330\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#30\n\nYes. When you started seeing kids carry these around at school right after the system launched, it was pretty exciting.\n\nPhediuk\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n3,333\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#31\n\nNo, the Lynx came out only like four months later and utterly demolished the Game Boy specs-wise.\n\nThe Lynx legitimately blew my fucking mind back then.\n\nxyla\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n8,643\n\nGermany\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#32\n\nHell naw, I've seen plenty of documentaries on the matter. It was cheap, long battery life, had Tetris, ect.\n\nThose are some pretty important points! It might have been technically underwhelming compared to devices with a far higher price point, but when I was little, I couldn't even consider those because of the really low battery run time. Think Switch but without an integrated battery where you'd have to buy batteries all the time. I can't really remember, but I think, we only got rechargeable batteries for an affordable price later. At least in our home, couldn't find anything on the history of rechargeable batteries.\n\nAnd it was introduced for the price point of around 70 Euro - you can't argue with that.\n\nEvery other handheld around that time was a luxury device compared to that.\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#33\n\nMy first console.\n\nThe concept of changing cartridges in a handheld devices was great (but not new), but the graphics were really not impressive, at all. And it was sooooo annoying that the screen didn't have backlight, you had to play next to a lamp and put the system in the \"perfect angle\" to enjoy it. :/\n\nBut of course a lot of great games and great memories.\n\nlow-G\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n8,144\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#34\n\nI lived in those days.\n\nI was pretty young, but I thought it was neat (there were already portable games, but most of them were all-in-one units, like Donkey Kong Game & Watch).\n\nYet, even my SUPER tech-illiterate dad said \"next year there will be a Gameboy that's full color.\" There was already talk of the Atari Lynx which was backlit and full color.\n\nI got the Gameboy and some months later the Atari Lynx.\n\nSo for whoever lived the early days of the Gameboy , Was the idea of a portable gaming device in 1989 with somehow NES graphics but in Black and White sounds like a miracle back then ?\n\nHow about a portable gaming device in 1989 that is backlit and looks almost on par with Sega Genesis?\n\nTHIS was some tech wizardry:\n\nNOTE: COPYRIGHT FOR THAT GAME IS SAME YEAR OF GB'S RELEASE.\n\nkrae_man\n\nMaster of Balan Wonderworld\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n9,860\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#35\n\nConsidering the Lynx, Game Gear and Turbo Express all came out within a year of the Game Boy, not really.\n\nAlso the Game Pocket Computer came out 5 years earlier:\n\nDeleted member 17210\n\nUser-requested account closure\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n11,569\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#36\n\nI disagree when people say the Game Boy had the highest quality portable games of its era. It's too broad of a statement and I think it varies by genre. I had all three of the major portables that gen and they all had software strengths. There are a lot of gems beneath the surface.\n\nThe Lynx's 3d games (STUN Runner, Blue Lightning, Hydra, Battle Wheels, Battlezone, Roadblasters, etc.) had no proper equivalents on the competition. I think the Game Gear had the best action-platformer with Shinobi II, the best SRPG in English with Shining Force, the best vertical shooter with Power Strike II, and the best fighting game with Fatal Fury Special. The Game Boy won the overhead action-adventure genre with Link's Awakening, I think it generally had the best beat 'em ups (Battletoads, Double Dragon), and puzzle games (especially for Tetris and Donkey Kong '94).\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nRyuichi Naruhodo\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n1,511\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#37\n\nThanks for all the replies , I am not deep into the handheld history despite living in those days and playing NES so I didn't know the existence of Both Atari Lynx and Sega Gamegear so sorry for not looking deep enough xD and yea Both graphically beats Gameboy with no contest and as others said it was the battery life that the gameboy was superior in\n\nReinhard\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n6,756\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#38\n\nGamegear was the only console I had growing up (although I was no longer a little kid by its release date , more middle school) aside from Atari 2600 and my PC. Now that was basically a portable Master System, being back lit with color and had some amazing Sonic games on it.. The Gameboy seemed so primitive in comparison, but the real problem was that the Gamegear wasn't that portable because of its horrible battery life. I didn't have a TV in my room only a computer so it kind of worked out okay. Nintendo was smart in having such an underpowered and primitive system as it allowed for amazing battery life.\n\nLast edited: Oct 13, 2018\n\nbionic77\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n31,026\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#39\n\nIn the US when the Gameboy came out there was nothing like it. Your only option for portable gaming before it were those horrible single games with a fixed screen.\n\nThe tech was quickly surpassed, but for a year or so it was pretty revolutionary.\n\nIt didn't look like much next to the later portables like the Game Gear, Turbo Express, etc. though. Not sure why the more powerful portables didn't catch on. Sega even made a portable Genesis, basically the Nintendo Switch. But I only knew one person who had it.\n\ngaugebozo\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n2,891\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#40\n\nHandheld gaming devices weren't new right when the Gameboy came out, but what existed was stuff like this:\n\nOr this\n\nBoth kinds had like three positions your character could be in, you couldn't swap games, and horrible graphics.\n\nThe other things being mentioned here like TurboExpress didn't come along until the Gameboy had been out for two years and they cost a lot more so nobody I knew had one until the mid-90s.\n\nI first saw a Gameboy at the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, and at the time it was amazing.\n\nDeleted member 2145\n\nUser requested account closure\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n29,223\n\nOct 13, 2018\n\n#41\n\nEveryone wanted an Atari lynx, way cooler.

And this thing was a marvel as far as I was concerned. Tetris, Mario Land, Sunsoft Batman, the 2 Castlevania games, Super C, Gargoyles Quest. Console quality in your hand. It was amazing.

Hmmmm. I liked it. I remember loving my mom for buying me a recharge pack for Christmas? I liked the games on it.... miracle? I think back then I thought of it as another thing to play games on. No more no less.\n\nAs a kid I thought GameGear was way cooler lol. And the TurboGraphix before it.\n\nGameBoy was deemed fairly low-tech, even in 1989.\n\nI remember game gear being an awesome thing I played at home with it plugged into a wall at all times.

So no, I don't think the game boy seemed like a miracle device. The black and white was always a bummer to me."
