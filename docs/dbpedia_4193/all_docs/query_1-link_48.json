        "text": "Description\n\nThis is a nice Atari 7800 console that has been refurbished and upgraded to use a composite video output.\n\nWork carried out:\n\nCleaned the cart connector and all cases inside and out\n\nPower input plug was missing – replaced with a standard DC input socket like you would find on a ZX Spectrum computer. No more hard to find power supply! – New PSU supplied.\n\nFitted a composite video / audio board with a custom 3D printed bracket to allow connection to the A/V input on a TV. Now you get a much better picture and sound. The bracket fits the case and holds the A/V circuit without modifying the case at all. Both phono jacks are available at the back of the 7800 for connection.\n\nComes with an Atari joystick, new PSU and PacMan! Asteroids already being available on the unit itself without the need for a cartridge!\n\nSerial Number: X 9383833219\n\nCondition is Seller refurbished.\n\nAny questions then please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nAbout the Atari 7800\n\nThe Atari 7800 ProSystem, or simply the Atari 7800, is a home video game console officially released by Atari Corporation in 1986 as the successor to both the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200. It can run almost all Atari 2600 cartridges, making it one of the first consoles with backward compatibility. It shipped with a different model of joystick from the 2600-standard CX40 and Pole Position II as the pack-in game. Most of the announced titles at launch were ports of 1980–83 arcade video games.\n\nDesigned by General Computer Corporation, the 7800 has significantly improved graphics hardware over Atari’s previous consoles, but the same Television Interface Adaptor chip that launched with the 2600 in 1977 is used to generate audio. In an effort to prevent the flood of poor quality games that contributed to the video game crash of 1983, cartridges had to be digitally signed by Atari.\n\nThe Atari 7800 was first announced by Atari, Inc. on May 21, 1984, but a general release was shelved until May 1986 due to the sale of the company. Atari Corporation dropped support for the 7800, along with the 2600 and the Atari 8-bit family, on January 1, 1992."
