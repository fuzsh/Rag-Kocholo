        "text": "Mattel was founded in 1945. It was the first manufacturer of photo frames and doll accessories. After the launch of the Barbie doll in 1959, the company shifted its focus entirely to toys.\n\nThe incredible success of Barbie filled Mattel's coffers, which soon diversified its line by buying small toy companies with different product lines. Today, with well-known brands like Hot Wheels, Barbie and a series of other acquisitions that include Fisher-Price and Tyco, Mattel is one of the largest and most successful toy manufacturers in the world. In 1977, Mattel, under its line Mattel Electronics, produced the original Auto Race, the first electronic handheld game. It was coarse compared to current standards - the look was represented by red LEDs and the sound consisted of simple beeps. But the new product was a huge success, spawning many other handheld games like Football and Battlestar Galactica. These games sold millions and gave Mattel confidence to enter the unknown video game market with the Intellivision Master Component.\n\nMattel Electronics successfully tested Intellivision in Fresno, California, in 1979, with four games: Las Vegas Poker & Blackjack, Math Fun, Armor Battle and Backgammon. The following year, Mattel Electronics went national and quickly sold all of its first year production.\n\nDespite allowing movements in an impressive 16 positions, the directional dial was widely criticized for being clumsy in some games. Some accessories were created by other companies to supposedly improve control of the disc. Plastic sheets (overlays) were supplied with the cartridges and inserted in the controls, on the numeric keypad. Some overlays brought important information about the game.\n\nInitially, Mattel Electronics delegated the game programming work to the company APh Technological Consulting. In 1980, an own development team was formed, known as The Blue Sky Rangers - the name was chosen during a brainstorming process for new games, called \"blue-skying\".\n\nMattel aggressively advertised in famous magazines and, like Atari, used TV commercials as an important part of advertising. For most commercials until 1983, Mattel hired writer George Plimpton, who became known as \"Mr. Intellivision\". The infamous Plimpton ads helped publicize the system and enhance its technological advantages over the Atari VCS (known as 2600). The ads usually featured an Intellivision game - usually a sports game, which made full use of the system's capabilities - alongside a simple-looking 2600 game.\n\nFollowing the path of Atari with its 2600, Mattel Electronics has sublicensed the rights to distribute the Intellivision Master Component under different brands, including Sears Tele-Games Super Video Arcade, the Radio Shack Tandyvision One and the GTE Sylvania.\n\nExcept for aesthetic differences, most systems are identical to the original. Sears Super Video Arcade features a different splash screen and the company has re-released some game titles under its own brand.\n\nDespite the good commercial results, Mattel Electronics started to have problems with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Several customers complained about the delay in launching the Keyboard Component , a module with a keyboard and cassette player promised by the company for 1981.\n\nAlthough a few units could be launched for testing on the market and for those consumers who complained vehemently, the Keyboard Component would cost the company a lot for large-scale production. The 4,000 units produced (at a loss) were not enough to calm the FTC. They imposed monthly fines on the company, which prompted Mattel to pursue an alternative plan for a cheaper, yet less-resilient expansion module - the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) - launched only in 1983.\n\nMattel disclosed that, with the resources of ECS, in addition to the Master Component itself and other peripherals such as Modem, Printer and Speech Synthesizer, Intellivision would have practically the same potential as a microcomputer of the time. The set of equipment would form the Entertainment Center.\n\nVery innovative for the time, the PlayCable was launched in 1982: an adapter that allowed you to download games over the cable TV network directly into memory device, which would be read by the Master Component as if it were a cartridge. The subscription service was a partnership between Mattel Electronics and General Instrument (developer of the Intellivision chip) and made around 20 titles available every month. It was discontinued in 1983.\n\nStill in 1982, Mattel Electronics launched the synthesized voice module Intellivoice , the second accessory of its kind for a video game console (the first to be launched was The Voice, for Magnavox's Odyssey console).\n\nWith the ingenious use of pre-recorded sound samples on the equipment and recordings loaded from the cartridge, each title for Intellivoice had its identity.\n\nAlthough impressive, even using low recording frequencies, only five games with voice were released. Intellivoice's poor sales forced Mattel Electronics to issue free module coupons for those who purchased a Master Component or games by mail.\n\nIn 1983, to reduce production costs, Mattel Electronics launched the sleek and smaller Intellivision II, with removable controls and an external power source.\n\nAnother \"feature\" was a secret hardware validation that did not allow third-party software to operate. This check affected the arcade versions of the Coleco 1982 - Donkey Kong, Mouse Trap and Carnival - and inadvertently prevented Mattel's The Electric Company Word Fun from running. Fortunately, internal and external teams have found a way to circumvent this verification. But malaise with partner companies was already established.\n\nA special video output was added to the cartridge door and made System Changer possible, a module that allowed Intellivision II to run Atari 2600 games All other versions of Intellivision consoles require internal modifications to use System Changer.\n\nIn the same year, the second computer module was launched: the Entertainment Computer System (ECS), replacing the late Keyboard Component. ECS, like System Changer, had the same style as Intellivision II, although compatible with all models of Intellivision and Intellivoice.\n\nThe ECS has a pluggable keyboard, an expander box and a power supply, in addition to allowing the connection of a standard cassette recorder and a printer.\n\nDespite all the releases, the future of the Intellivision modules, however, was uncertain. Mattel Electronics, after changing the company's direction in 1983, shifted its focus from hardware to software.\n\nThis change removed the priority of modules like ECS and Intellivoice; only the Master Component would continue to receive support for software and dissemination. In the end, only a musical keyboard (Music Synthesizer) and five cartridges were launched specifically for ECS.\n\nFollowing general industry losses with the \"big video game crash\" and a lot of money spent on hardware development, Mattel Electronics closed its doors on 1/20/1984, and its estate was sold to a company owned by Terry Valeski, former senior vice president of marketing and sales for Mattel Electronics, for about $ 20 million.\n\nIn addition to carrying out the inventory, Intellivision Inc. sold cartridges for some complete games that had not been previously released.\n\nIn 1985, as soon as the remaining Mattel Electronics products were sold, Valeski bought shares from other investors in Intellivision Inc. for $ 1 million and formed Intv Corporation.\n\nThe new company hired programmers from defunct Mattel Electronics to produce new games for Intellivision. The company also launched the INTV System III (which was later named INTV Super Pro system), based on the original Intellivision Master Component and with minor aesthetic differences.\n\nLike the Atari 2600 Jr., the INTV System III was sold as a low-cost alternative to the most modern systems of the time, with prices below $ 60 and many games below $ 20. Intv Corporation continued to produce new products until 1990, when it went bankrupt and closed in 1991.\n\nMattel was not idle after closing its electronics branch. The toy company became involved again with the games industry and joined Nintendo in 1986.\n\nIt not only produced new software and peripherals for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), but also distributed them across Europe in 1987 and Canada, as a Nintendo representative, between 1986 and 1990.\n\nAlthough most of the 1990s were quiet in the video game business for Mattel, in 1999 the company acquired a major computer software publisher called Learning Company, but got rid of it a year later due to the high costs associated with its acquisition. .\n\nAt the turn of the decade, in an effort to try to embark on the growing wave of nostalgia for electronic classics, Mattel successfully reintroduced reproductions of its classic line of handheld games.\n\nA few years later, in 2006, the company acquired TV game maker Radica and launched the first console actually manufactured by Mattel since the Intellivision II, the Mattel HyperScan.\n\nHyperScan combines a scanner of collection cards (cards) with fighting games for a young target audience.\n\nFor the first time, a company that had participated in the market before the 1984 crash was returning to the volatile market for electronic games.\n\nUnfortunately, for Mattel, HyperScan did not arouse much interest and found its way into sales and inventory burns shortly after launch.\n\nExclusive rights to the Intellivision system and games were acquired by former Mattel Electronics programmers who, in 1997, joined and created Intellivision Productions Inc. The company chaired by Keith Robinson created free game emulators from Intellivision for PC and Mac, in addition to launching collections of classic console games for Xbox, Playstation, DS and GameCube.\n\nThe Intellivision logo and its mascot \"running man\" started to print T-shirts, mugs, caps and other accessories for sale on the official website. The participation of Intv Productions representatives in fairs and events kept the history of the console alive and helped to create a nostalgic wave of old games, reinforced with the launch of Intellivision Flashback on 10/01/2014, a compact version of the Master Component with 60 original games in memory.\n\nThe death of President of Intellivision Productions, Keith Robinson, on 6/13/2017, left a huge doubt about the future of the company. After a few months, already in 2018, the official website was redesigned and a new company was introduced: Intellivision Entertainment, led by Tommy Tallarico, a musician and producer of game soundtracks, as well as an Intellivision fan and collector.\n\nTommy assembled a team with big names from the gaming scene of the 80s, 90s and 2000s to create a new console: the Intellivision Amico.\n\nWith design similar to Intellivision II and extremely advanced hardware, the Amico was introduced at the end of that year and pre-sales started, with the motto of Intellivision classics recreated for the new console and the rescue of the meetings of family and friends around of the tv to play.\n\nWith a promised release for 10/10/2020, the Amico pre-order was a success and the few units were soon sold out. The launch, however, was postponed to 4/15/2021 and later to 10/10/2021 due to the pandemic of COVID-19 (New Corona Virus) that severely affected the world economy in those years.\n\nSource: Classic Gaming Brasil, Gamasutra, Wikipedia, \"1983: o ano dos videogames no Brasil\" from Marcus Chiado, Sergio Vares\n\nOfficially, 125 games were released for Intellivision between 1979 and 1990, with a small portion that requires Intellivoice or ECS.\n\nMany of the games contain some of the best graphics and sounds of all video games, until Coleco released its powerful Colecovision, although its gameplay seems a little slower compared to its competitors.\n\nMattel generally grouped its first games into categories called \"networks\", including Sports Network, Action Network, Gaming Network, Space Action Network, Strategy Network, Children's Learning Network and Arcade Network, with different box colors.\n\nHowever, Mattel's marketing abandoned this concept in late 1982, launching most games within the Action Network category.\n\nIn the first two years of the original Intellivision Master Component, the console was accompanied by Las Vegas Poker & Blackjack, which features great versions of these games for 1 or 2 players, including sounds and animations from the dealer.\n\nIn the following years, it was accompanied by the Astrosmash, one of the most well-known titles on the console in which asteroids and other objects fall on the screen and must be destroyed.\n\nThe game has an automatic dynamic difficulty control that allows high scores even for beginners. Right after the launch of Intellivision II, a coupon for the excellent conversion of the famous arcade Burgertime has been included.\n\nIntellivision is famous for its enormous quality in the field of sports games, including Major League Baseball, NFL Football, NBA Basketball, NHL Hockey and PGA Golf, all released in 1980 and among the first licensed games with professional sports associations.\n\nMost of these titles have great gameplay with the directional pad of the controller and make good use of overlays on the numeric keypad. INTV Corp. released, years later, updated versions for some of these games, which introduced new features and support for 1 player, although without the expensive licenses of the brands involved.\n\nAlthough the strategy was to gain market share with well-known brands, Mattel's talented developers did not really want to follow the example of creating bad games and appear on the recognition board just for the product to be launched. Mattel's list included the classic RPG Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, The Electric Company educational games, games based on the Disney movie TRON, in addition to Hanna-Barbera games for ECS.\n\nMattel eventually shifted its focus from development to action games, but for a time, Intellivision received several excellent releases that require more than just thought. In addition to releases such as Reversi and USCF Chess, there was the innovative and critically acclaimed Utopia, which allowed one or two players to control an island with constant natural disasters and provoked.\n\n\"Atari x Intellivision? Nothing I say can be more persuasive than your own eyes will tell you. But I can't resist telling you more.\" said George Plimpton in a magazine ad 1982.\n\nMost games scheduled for release in 1983 were advertised as \"Supergraphics\". The intention of this label was to give Intellivision more strength against attacks by the most advanced supersystems Colecovision and Atari 5200.\n\nIn reality, \"Supergraphics\" was a marketing ploy, although the games used more sophisticated programming routines to generate better graphics and smoother gameplay than previously released games.\n\nAnyway, the announcement helped to make the new games a little more exciting. This new batch of Mattel titles included the multi-screen game Masters of the Universe: The Power of He -Man and the arcade version Bump 'n' Jump.\n\nDespite having released just five titles with Intellivoice in mind, what was created is something more characteristic and sophisticated for this system. This includes Space Spartans, Bomb Squad and B-17 Bomber, which simulates a bombing of World War II.\n\nThere is also the ECS version of the World Series Major League Baseball, which features one of the first baseball games with multi-angle, with fast gameplay based on real statistics, use of Intellivoice and ease of loading and saving games on cassette.\n\nUnfortunately, the rarity of the combined equipment allowed only a few players to experience Eddie Dombrower's programming skills in simulating Major League Baseball - at least until the launch of his famous Earl Weaver Baseball for IBM PC and compatible, and for Commodore Amiga four computers years later.\n\nIn 1983, the remaining list of ECS cartridges was launched. These titles include Mind Strike, Mr. BASIC Meets Bits' n Bytes , which teaches basic programming through three games and a 72-page illustrated book and Melody Blaster, a musical version of Astrosmash and the only title, in addition to the internal music program, which makes use of the musical keyboard Music Synthesizer.\n\nUnfortunately, while new titles were in development before Mattel Electronics stopped supporting ECS, no software took advantage of the additional control ports for games with four players.\n\nSupport for third-party software started slowly for Intellivision, with Mattel Electronics' attempt to block development with the launch of Intellivision II. In addition to the Coleco, Activision, Atarisoft, Imagic, Interphase and Parker Brothers launched cartridges for the system since 1982.\n\nAlthough many of these companies work with other systems (mainly Atari 2600), some titles have been released exclusively for the Mattel platform, including Happy Trails by Activision and Dracula by Imagic.\n\nIn particular, Imagic invested heavily in the system, launching seven more exclusive games, for a total of 14 titles. Among them, Microsurgeon and Swords & Serpents, both in 1982.\n\nAfter Mattel Electronics closed in 1984, sales of the remaining items (now held by Intellivision Inc.) were going well. Terry Valeski decided to try to launch new games. These games included World Series Baseball (now with support for 1 or 2 players), Thunder Castle , World Cup Soccer (1 or 2 players) and Championship Tennis (1 or 2 players).\n\nThe first two games were developed at Mattel Electronics but never released, and the last two were completed at a Mattel Electronics office in France; they were previously launched only in Europe by Dextell Ltd. The success of these new launches spurred Valeski to buy the assets of Intellivision Inc. and found INTV Corp. to continue releasing new titles for Intellivision.\n\nTo save money, the new releases and re-releases were produced with thinner boxes, without overlays (or, when absolutely necessary, with inferior quality), labels and manuals printed in black and often without renewing licenses, which caused a change in name for some titles.\n\nDespite intense competition in the reinvigorated video game market, INTV Corp. entered the race until 1990, launching 21 games in total, six of which were written from the start instead of taking advantage of pre-existing codes. These six new titles included the sports games Chip Shot Super Pro Golf, Super Pro Decathlon, Body Slam! Super Pro Wrestling and Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball, in addition to the arcade versions Commando and Pole Position.\n\nIn four decades of existence, the console with more than three million units sold still brings news.\n\nIn terms of hardware, the highlights are the multicart Intellicart and Cuttle Cart 3, by Chad Schell, which allows you to load and play ROM files on the original console. These accessories are no longer produced, but new multicart were launched later, such as HIVE and LTO Flash!.\n\nThe new games are developed by independent companies like Intelligentvision, Elektronite and Intellivision Revolution and today they have over 100 titles.\n\nSome games of the new generation: Stonix, Minehunter, 4-Tris and versions of the classic Donkey Kong (DK Arcade and D2K Arcade).\n\nThe title Same Game & Robots, which had already been published in 2011, gained a new version in 2012, being the first cartridge of the new generation using Intellivoice resources.\n\nThe converter software IntyBASIC by Ãscar Toledo GutiÃ©rrez also helped drive the development of new games. With the possibility of creating in a more accessible language, several players and collectors started to develop quite interesting games and even conversions of classics and arcades with admirable quality. Some of these games won full versions with box, overlay and professional quality manual and were released commercially, such as Flapee Bird, Missile Domination, H.E.L.I. and the collection IntyBASIC Showcase Vol.1.\n\nSome games have also been edited or reissued by the Blue Sky Rangers themselves. This is the case of Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball, considered the rarest in the official catalog, which received new packaging in a limited run and Deep Pockets: Super Pro Pool & Billiards, developed in 1990 by Intv Corp. but never released. The game King of the Mountain, started at Mattel Electronics, was finalized and also launched with box, manual and overlays.\n\nMattel Electronics held several competitions and championships in the early 1980s. The events were grandiose and held in partnership with radio stations, department stores and more.\n\nIn addition to the famous Astrosmash Shootoff Competition, the Intellivision Videochallenge Tournament brought parents and children together to compete in 6 console games: Frog Bog, Night Stalker , Astrosmash, Skiing, Golf and Lock 'n' Chase.\n\nThe tournament, in partnership with the radio station WBZZ-FM, took place between 10/09/1982 and 10/12/1982 and distributed several prizes such as a 45 \"projector, cameras, consoles, cartridges and Intellivoice modules.\n\nIn addition to the partnership with cable TV companies to use PlayCable, Mattel Electronics also entered into another successful partnership with Marv Kempner, creator of the interactive game show TV POWWW!.\n\nIn the 1970s, Mark created the TV show using 'Fairchild Channel F' consoles modified to be accessed from voice commands and with simplified versions of games from that console. The POWWW TV! was created to be inserted in live programs, such as children's early morning. Basically, a player in the studio should compete with a player at home over the phone. They were, for the most part, simple target shooting games - the player in the studio fired the shots shouting \"POW!\". After 15 or 30 seconds, the game was restarted and the player on the phone tried to beat the score of the studio player.\n\nThe POWWW TV! it was a success, but in 1980, Fairchild announced its exit from the video game market. In need of a replacement system, Kempner made a deal with Mattel to use Intellivision.\n\nSome Intellivision games have been modified to the program format, including Astrosmash, Skiing and Word Rockets, from The Electric Company Word Fun . Four games made especially for TV POWWW! were later released in the Sharp Shot cartridge.\n\nWith Intellivision games, the program has become more popular than ever and many broadcasters have signed on. Some showed POWWW TV! only during children's programs, others targeted young people and adults. At New York's WPIX broadcaster, players were told to shout \"PIX!\" instead of \"POW!\".\n\nThe TV program POWWW! it spread across the planet, and was even shown in Brazil by TVS (later SBT, by businessman Silvio Santos). Although Mattel stopped creating new games for Kempner in early 1983, the program continued to be popular on several broadcasters until the end of the decade. Kempner tried to contact Nintendo and Sega to continue the program using their newly launched consoles, but both were not interested.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, technology in Brazil was still restricted by the Market Reserve Law (Federal Law nÂº 7.232/84). Approved on October 29, 1984 by the National Congress and with a previously established term of 8 years, the first law of the so-called National Policy of Informatics had noble ideals: to protect and develop the national electronics industry and encourage internal scientific research, legally preventing the import of components and forcing companies to manufacture parts in the country.\n\nIn return, these companies, established in a specific pole (Manaus), would be exempt from taxes.\n\nIn practice, the law brought about a setback for the country and a financial loss for foreign companies. Consumers were forced to buy obsolete, inferior quality equipment at exorbitant prices. At the international level, companies denounced the continuous breaches of patents and intellectual property violations committed by Brazilian companies under the protection of the law, as well as the impossibility of fair competition, as foreign companies (with very rare exceptions) could not even sell their products in the country.\n\nDespite the new computer law passed by Congress in 1991 (Federal Law No. 8.248/91), the market reserve was maintained and expired, as planned, in October 1992.\n\nFor many, the Market Reserve Law was the government's endorsement for \"technology piracy\" by companies.\n\nAs Mattel Electronics was judicious in the development of its products, there was no major impact for Intellivision in Brazil. Only the authorized manufacturer (Sharp, by businessman Matias Machline) could making and distributing games and consoles. Few companies have manufactured cartridges \"compatible\" with Intellivision, which had a much smaller catalog than its biggest competitor. This was not the case with the Atari 2600: a variety of compatible consoles and cartridges flooded the market at that time, involving even major manufacturers like CCE.\n\nOn 11/03/1983, Intellivision was officially presented to the Brazilian press during a lunch at the Maksoud Plaza hotel in SÃ£o Paulo. On the afternoon of the same day, the console was presented to a group of about 400 retailers and resellers. Sharp showed a video with testimonials from psychologists and educators who defended the most intelligent games, the motto of the Intellivision campaign in Brazil.\n\nIntellivision hit stores (initially from SP and RJ) in early December, several years after the official North American release and with only 11 titles: Astrosmash, BurgerTime, Frog Bog, Soccer, Lock 'n' Chase, Math Fun, Poker & Blackjack, Shark! Shark!, Snafu, Tennis and Triple Action.\n\nThe console label bears the name of the company Digimed, a subsidiary of Sharp that, in early 1984, had its name changed to Digiplay. The company occupied part of a Sharp building located at Estrada do Campo Limpo, in the south zone of SÃ£o Paulo, until the bankruptcy of the Brazilian subsidiary in the 1990s.\n\nInitially, the games were launched prominently from the Intellivision brand, with little reference to Digiplay only on the back of the box. Some games have had their titles translated into the local language, a strategy also adopted by Mattel Electronics in Canada - among them, The Dreadnaught Factor , which became Desafio Estelar and NASL Soccer changed to Futebol.\n\nAnother detail about the national releases is that all titles were sold in \"book\" style packaging, with side opening. The manuals are also noteworthy, all printed on glossy and colored paper. In the United States, only a few games were released in this more expensive format and, often, with simple manuals printed only in black. The Astrosmash cartridge, on the other hand, has a curious history. Some copies sold in Brazil have a time limit, to be chosen at the beginning of the game. This version was used in the Astrosmash Shootoff competition, which took place in late 1982 in the United States. The reason that only a few copies have this version is unknown. The cartridge chip is dated 1984, when Mattel Electronics had already closed its doors. It is speculated that these cartridges are part of a batch transferred by Mattel Electronics to empty its stock after bankruptcy, but considering that employees were discharged in January 1984, Mattel would not be able to manufacture new cartridges that year.\n\nMuch sought after by collectors, the \"pirate games\" (or bootlegs) for Intellivision were manufactured by a company called VLS IndÃºstria EletrÃ´nica Ltda, established on 11/13/1984 and installed in the 302 room of Rua do Catete nÂº 310, in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAvailable in video stores in the city, these games could be rented for much lower prices than the original cartridges for sale. The cartridge is larger than the original, had no overlays, was packed in a simple box, slightly larger than the cartridge and there was a simplified photocopy manual.\n\nSome well-known games released by VLS are Armor Battle, Lady Bug and Worm Whomper, this translated into Portuguese as Pragas.\n\nIn addition to VLS, another company profited from games for the console. Installed in SÃ£o Paulo, ShockVision manufactured about 50 titles of cartridges for Intellivision with an unusual feature: the games were packaged in Atari standard cases, which required the user using an adapter (called Shock Adapter) to fit the cartridge to the Intellivision.\n\nThe Venture cartridge was also launched by ShockVision, however, in a case in the Colecovision standard.\n\nIn the middle of 1984, when the North American electronic games industry was already collapsing, the Intellivision II arrived in Brazil, reinforcing the Digiplay brand on the console in place of the Mattel Electronics logo. The games sold from that year onwards also had their packaging changed from the original games, such as the title Happy Trails, which had the Activision logo replaced by the Brazilian brand.\n\nTo get closer to its audience, Digiplay created a newsletter with launches, records, championships and tips, in addition to using it as a communication channel for responses to letters sent by users. The newsletter Digiplay Games had only two print editions in 1984.\n\nDigiplay manufactured and sold cartridges for Intellivision until mid-1985, when its name was changed to Epcom. Until it ended its activities around November 1992, Epcom remained active with the manufacture of the Hotbit microcomputer (until 1988) and reinforced the Sharp brand in the electronics market.\n\nCURIOSIDADES\n\nIn early 1983, the American company CBS approached Sharp and submitted a proposal for the manufacture of ColecoVision in the country. Subsequently, the same proposal was made to Gradiente. The negotiations were not concluded and the companies entered into a partnership with Mattel and Atari, respectively.\n\nWhen the Japanese company Sharp wanted to enter the country, it was a big surprise: the name Sharp had already been registered in Brazil by businessman Matias Machline. An agreement was reached and the businessman became a partner of the brand in Brazil.\n\nFormer jeweler and entrepreneur Joseph Maghrabi sued Sharp because, according to him, the Intellivision trademark had already been registered in his name with the INPI (National Institute of Industrial Property). The lawyers \"cooked\" the case for a while and nothing was resolved. It is worth mentioning that this was not Mr. Maghrabi's only attempt in this field. In addition to registering the Intellivision trademark (and even copy the logo created by Mattel on \"generic\" cartridges for Atari), he also registered with the INPI and Jucesp (Junta Comercial de SÃ£o Paulo) the company \"Atari EletrÃ´nica Ltda\". Atari proposed an agreement and he continued to manufacture cartridges for that console.\n\nPre-1970\n\nIn computer labs throughout the United States, mostly on college campuses, engineers and students create elaborate interactive games on mainframe computers. The games are rarely seen by the public and, since they run on computers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, they have no apparent commercial potential.\n\n1970\n\nFirst coin-operated video arcade machine, Nolan Bushnell's Computer Space, is introduced by (Bill) Nutting Associates. It flops.\n\n1972\n\nMagnavox introduces Odyssey, first home video game system, designed by Ralph Baer, to moderate success.\n\n1972\n\nNolan Busnell introduces arcade game, Pong, from his new company, Atari. The game is a hit, becomes cultural phenomenon.\n\n1975\n\nAtari enters home market with dedicated Pong unit. Stores sell out nationwide, put customers on waiting lists.\n\n1975\n\nMidway introduces arcade machine Gun Fight, based on the Taito arcade game Western Gun. In redesigning the game for Midway, Dave Nutting Associates (headed by Dave Nutting, brother of Computer Space's Bill Nutting), incorporated an Intel 8080 microprocessor into the machine, making it the first video game, arcade or home system, that is effectively a computer.\n\n1977\n\nAtari introduces the cartridge-based VCS (Video Computer System), later renamed the Atari 2600.\n\n1977\n\nUnder \"Mattel Electronics\" brand name, Mattel Toys introduces world's first handheld electronic games. The handheld units contain simple microprocessors.\n\n1978\n\nEngineering on the Intellivision video game system begins at Mattel Toys in Hawthorne, California.

Mattel claims Intellivision is heart of a home system that will soon include a computer keyboard component. Fifteen more Intellivision titles released, bringing total to 19. Console sales reach 175,000. Mattel hires programmers to start developing software in-house.\n\n1981\n\n$6 million ad campaign touts Intellivision's graphic superiority over Atari 2600. News media take note, start covering video game \"war,\" raising profile of entire industry. Although the $300 Intellivision is twice as expensive as the 2600, sales soar, reaching 850,000 consoles by year's end. Computer keyboard and educational software become low priority; release is delayed. Mattel Toys spins off Mattel Electronics as separate company. Hiring increases.\n\n1982\n\nVideo game industry valued at $1.5 billion. Mattel Electronics announces profits of over $100 million, with Intellivisions in over 2 million homes. Most popular Intellivision games sell over a million cartridges each. Companies publishing Atari 2600 cartridges, including Activision and Imagic, start releasing games for the Intellivision system, too. Total Intellivision titles available climbs to over 50. Mattel Electronics releases Intellivoice module and three voice games; raises ad budget for year to over $20 million. Computer keyboard released in limited test markets at $600; general release is repeatedly delayed. Mattel game development staff hits 100. TV Guide magazine, in an article about Intellivision, dubs the developers \"The Blue Sky Rangers.\" The name sticks. Higher-resolution ColecoVision video game system hits market with popular arcade game titles, taking sales away from Intellivision and Atari. While Christmas season for industry is strong overall, there are not enough sales to go around for all of the companies now in the market.\n\n1983\n\nClassic brown-and-woodgrain Intellivision console is replaced by cheaper ($150) light gray Intellivision II. Computer keyboard component is officially cancelled in favor of cheaper, less powerful Entertainment Computer System (ECS). System Changer module is released, allowing Atari 2600 cartridges to be played on an Intellivision II console. Marketing campaign now pushes Intellivision as the system that plays the most games. New systems are released by other companies, including the Atari 5200 and the Vectrex. Games for all systems flood the market, many rushed and of poor quality. Titles available for Intellivision alone approaches 100. By midyear, glut of video game hardware and software creates huge losses and panic within the industry. Mattel Electronics cuts price of Intellivision II console to $69, cancels all new hardware development, and lays off hundreds of employees, including two-thirds of programming staff. Mattel Electronics ends year with over $300 million loss.\n\n1984\n\nMattel Inc. closes Mattel Electronics, laying off remaining programmers. Sells rights to Intellivision system and games to new company headed by former Mattel Electronics marketing exec. The company (INTV Corp.) continues selling Intellivision in major toy and department store chains, and through mail order. Other companies close or get out of the business, leaving Intellivision the only video game system still sold in the USA that Christmas. Experts proclaim video game industry dead.\n\n1985\n\nWhen leftover Mattel inventory of Intellivision II consoles runs out, INTV Corp. starts manufacturing the INTV System III console based on the design of the original Intellivision. Starts reprinting most popular games as inventory is exhausted. INTV has U.S. market to itself until Japan's popular Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is test marketed in America during Christmas season.\n\n1986\n\nINTV introduces games that were completed at Mattel Electronics but never released. Success of the new games spurs INTV to contract with former Mattel Electronics programmers to complete unfinished Intellivision games, update old ones, and create new ones. Although sales of cartridges are only in the 10,000 to 20,000 range, by running a bare-bones operation INTV Corp. is profitable. Nintendo releases NES nationally, quickly followed by new consoles from Sega and Atari (the 7800). The video game industry starts comeback.\n\n1987\n\nPopularity of NES temporarily boosts Intellivision sales: stores that had dropped video games in 1984 now stock them again, including some Intellivision titles. But Christmas clearly belongs to Nintendo.\n\n1988\n\nStores stop carrying Intellivision console and games. Sales are strictly through mail order.\n\n1989\n\nINTV appeals to patriotism, putting an American flag on the cover of its mail-order catalogs and proclaiming that Intellivision is the only All-American video game system (even though the consoles are made in Hong Kong). Too late, INTV starts developing games for the NES.\n\n1990\n\nINTV files for bankruptcy protection.
