        "text": "Atari Pong\n\nIn the same year, Pong, one of the earliest arcade machines was introduced off the back of the learning experiences of Syzygy's Computer Space, a beautifully crafted but difficult arcade machine inspired by Steve Russell's Spacewar!, an experimental game influenced by students of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Spacewar! is arguably the world's first video game, at least it has been claimed as such, although that claim is perhaps not quite so clear cut.\n\nPong not only caught the imagination of a generation because of its playability, but introduced sound chips in its circuitry. Engineered by Allan Alcorn, it was not made available to the home market until 1975.\n\nHome Pong established Atari and helped launch the video game industry by being among the first generation of games consoles, along with Ralph H. Baer's infamous Magnavox Odyssey, a console which played a big, albeit controversial role in the beginnings of Atari. Unequivocally in Pong, Atari launched the notion of the sound chip and sound in games, and followed this through to Home Pong.\n\nThere were variations of Pong released by Atari during its lifespan, those being the initial Sears Tele-Games Pong, Home Pong, Super Pong, Super Pong Ten, Super Pong PRO-AM, Super Pong PRO-AM Ten and Ultra Pong Doubles.\n\nHome Pong was my first encounter into video gaming, it was handed down to me from my sisters in my early years growing up in Australia, however somewhere between Australia and moving to the UK the beloved Pong disappeared never to be seen again, gasp, cue dramatic Pong 'blip'. OK maybe not!\n\nAtari VCS (2600)\n\nIn 1976 the Atari Video Computer System (VCS ) was conceived under the codename 'Stella'. Bushnell saw the potential of the Atari VCS, and knew he needed to raise more funds to market to realise that potential. Through a mutual acquaintance, he was directed towards Warner Communications Inc. who bought Atari from Bushnell in October of '76. In 1977 with enough funds, the Atari VCS was launched. However in 1978, after rising tensions between Bushnell and Warner over the future of the VCS, Bushnell was fired, welcomed by Nolan himself. Ray Kassar subsequently stepped in as CEO, taking over the responsibility of further marketing the Atari VCS through its games.\n\nLater to become known as the Atari 2600, it was revised over the years until 1982, with a re-introduction in 1986 as the Atari 2600 Junior. Spearheading the second generation of consoles, it introduced the iconic Atari joystick, patented the Atari joystick port, and helped popularise the notion of game cartridge based ROMs, sparked by the Fairchild Channel F. It cemented Atari in the gaming world, and furthered the phenomena that have become the video game and games console industries. It remains Atari's best selling product, largely due to sales of games such as Yars' Revenge by Howard Scott Warshaw, Atari's own Asteroids, and the Pong influenced Breakout, developed by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs of Apple fame, in fact, the arcade version providing the nucleus for the incorporation of Apple Computers in 1976. Not forgetting games such as Space Invaders licensed from Taito, and the equally popular Pac-Man licensed from Namco, the latter seen more as marketing successes rather than good arcade conversions. As such, the Atari 2600 saw Atari at their peek during the late 1970s and early 1980s. It has been heralded as the console the whole gaming industry is built on. Whether you agree with that statement or not is a matter of opinion, however one thing is for certain, the gaming industry owes a debt of gratitude to the first generation of consoles, and to the Atari 2600 which followed.\n\nDespite Atari's meteoric rise, in 1983 the video game industry suffered a crash, 'affectionally' known as 'Atari Shock', and yes that infamous E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial video game story which is so wrongly accredited for the same. Yet amidst this success and chaos, the home computer was born.\n\nAtari 400 / 800 Series\n\nIn 1979, while on the crest of a wave with the success of the 8-bit Atari 2600, Atari presented the first wave of its 8-bit computers, the Atari 400 and 800. It was from this period that the term 8-bit was more widely used, and generally denotes the consoles and computers of this generation.\n\nThe Atari 400 and 800 were the first home computers to offer custom chips, and the first to use sprites. The 400 was released with a membrane keyboard, 8K of RAM, expandable to 16K (initially intended to be 4K hence the name Atari 400), and a cartridge port. The beautiful Atari 800 was also released but with 8K of RAM, expandable to 48K, a mechanical keyboard and two cartridge ports. They were in direct competition with the '1977 Trinity', and were well received, notably for their build quality where one magazine wrote commenting on the 800, 'it has the strongest and tightest chassis I have seen since Raquel Welch'. Perhaps not politically correct in this day and age, but a complimentary turn of phrase nonetheless. I too remember these machines as a young boy in the early to mid 1980s, as for a time in the UK, both were still being sold alongside the popular Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the computer that blew the doors open for gaming and development in the UK, the Acorn BBC Micro, Electron and Dragon home computers to name but a few. It was perhaps a little later in my young life that I was just as equally in awe of Raquel Welch! However despite the reception, Atari found it difficult to compete with the likes of Apple, Tandy and Commodore.\n\nAtari 600XL / 800XL\n\n1983 saw both the Atari 600XL and Atari 800XL next generation home computers launched. The Atari 600XL as the replacement for the Atari 400, with 16K of RAM, and the Atari 800XL as the replacement to the Atari 800 and 1200XL, with 64K of RAM. Both machines addressed the consumer shortcomings of the Atari 1200XL, RAM expansion and BASIC loaded into ROM as examples, and both were more compact in design than the Atari 1200XL. The last revision of the Atari 800XL was the 800XLF (unofficial name), which incorporated the FREDDIE chip from the unreleased 1400XL and 1450XLD, and was sold in Europe for a brief time towards the latter part of 1984.\n\nThe first home computer I owned was the Atari 800XL, desperate as a young boy to enter the world of computing after a few years of window shopping. Many of my friends had Sinclair ZX Spectrums, and I wanted to follow suit, yet, as perhaps fate would have it I plumped for an Atari 800XL, as it was more accessible and obtainable for my parents to purchase and pay off by monthly instalments. I have fond memories playing for hours on Action Biker, Blue Max, Boulderdash, Fort Apocalypse, Kik-Start, The Last V8 and Ninja, to name some of my favourite 8-bit Atari games. It is the computer I spent hours frustratingly copying lines of code from magazine publishings. The days of mail order gaming, Silica Shop and Microdeal, the high street micro computer shop, spending hours scouring the budget games shelves from the likes of Mastertronic / M.A.D and Codemasters, and cusp of the development houses. Little did I realise what impression it would have on me, similarly, little did Atari know that this would become their most successful 8-bit home computer.\n\nAtari 1400XL / 1450XLD\n\nIn the same year of '83, both the Atari 1400XL and Atari 1450XLD were announced. The Atari 1400XL had a very similar casing to the Atari 1200XL, and architecture akin to that of the Atari 800XL, with its Parallel Bus, the same 64K of RAM, a new monitor output, a new FREDDIE chip, and a built in 300 baud modem. It also incorporated a new speech synthesiser chip, namely the SC-01 from Votrax, incidentally the same SC-01 found in the Alien Group Voice Box and Voice Box II, a speech synthesiser peripheral which was made available for the other Atari 8-bit line of home computers.\n\nThe Atari 1450XLD was to be the flagship of the XL series, essentially a 1400XL, but with an upgraded Votrax SC-02 speech synthesiser chip, less the SIO port from its XL predecessors, but instead with a Parallel Bus disk drive. All this said however, the 1400XL and 1450XLD never went to market.\n\nAtari 65XE / 130XE / 800XE\n\nIn 1984 after having internal disagreements, Jack Tramiel the man behind Commodore decided to quit. After parting ways with Commodore, Tramiel formed a new company called Tramel Technology in order to build his own next generation home computers. Within 6 months Jack acquired the struggling post crash consumer division of Atari from Warner, namely the Atari home video game and computer divisions, and subsequently renamed his own Tramiel Technology to Atari Corp. This gave Tramiel a reputable name under which to build his computers, while Warner retained AtariTel, and the arcade division of Atari, Atari Coin Op, renaming it Atari Games.\n\nIn 1985, late on in the 8-bit era the XE series, or 'XL-Expanded' series was announced with a new look design. Again, the Atari 65XE (800XE in some parts of Europe) has a very similar architecture to that of the Atari 800XL, less its Parallel Bus Interface, but with the same 64K of RAM, and with the FREDDIE chip from the 1400XL and 1450XLD respectively.\n\nAlso introduced was the Atari 130XE, the 65XE's bigger brother, which came with 128K of RAM, a Parallel Bus Interface like the 800XL, and an Enhanced Cartridge Interface.\n\nAtari XEGS\n\nThe last of the XE series, the Atari XE Video Game System was introduced the following year in 1987. Also known as the XEGS, it had the same 8-bit technology as the Atari 65XE but without a keyboard, and as such was of course the games console of the XE line. However it can be used as a home computer with an additional special keyboard peripheral, as well as the Atari 8-bit peripherals, allowing compatibility with the 65XE. It kept the look of the XE series, a look which makes me want to own one, and co-existed with the Atari 7800 and Atari 2600 Junior. By this time though, the 16-bit revolution was already underway, and Nintendo was cornering the games console market. Ultimately, given the tide had turned for Atari in the games console market, this then, would be Atari's last console for some time.\n\n16-bit Era\n\nJay Miner, a previous employee of Atari had left to set up his own company to allow him to explore new chipsets for the next generation of games consoles. Something he felt stifled with at Atari as they pursued pushing the Atari 2600 at the time. This company would later become Amiga Corporation. Atari decided to fund Amiga for their 'Lorraine' project, a Motorola 68000 based computer, for which they had plans to be exclusively the first to use in their next generation of home computers. This would become known as project 'Mickey'. In July of 1984 Commodore were suing Atari over 'stealing' many of its predominant employees, with the now ex Commodore boss Jack Tramiel at the helm. Amidst this Atari were suing Amiga for breach of contract regarding the selling of semiconductors to other companies. In August of the same year, Commodore acquired Amiga given the strained relationship between Amiga and Atari. What could have been the Atari Amiga never saw the light of day, but Jack under the Atari brand, sought to develop their next generation home computers along with another ex Commodore employee, Shiraz Shivji. As the fracas between Atari, Amiga and Commodore continued, under a project which was said to be already underway, project 'Rock Bottom Price', a new machine hailing new technology was born, the Atari ST. The ST was launched along with the XE series of Atari computers, and for Atari, this would be considered as Jack Tramiel's era.\n\nAtari 130ST / 260ST / 520ST / 520ST+ / 520STM\n\nThe Atari ST was introduced in 1985 with the unveiling of the 130ST, which was due to be a 128K RAM machine. Unlike the 130ST, the 520ST was released to market that year, pipping the Commodore Amiga 1000 which was released a little later.\n\nThe 520ST was an all new Atari boasting 512K of RAM, a Motorola 68000 CPU running at 8MHz, with a 16-bit external, and 32-bit internal bus respectively. The name 'ST' being an acronym for Sixteen Thirty two. The Operating System (official) loads by floppy disk, otherwise known as TOS, which some argue stood for Tramiel's Operating System (unofficial). Soon to introduce TOS 1.0 into ROM, its GUI named the Graphical Environment Manager (GEM) was originally named Crystal, and was developed by third party Digital Research. It is similar to the GUI of the Apple Macintosh, but also had colour capability, a first at that time. As such, Atari marketed the ST directly against Apple and their 68000 based computers with the infamous slogan, 'Power Without the Price', as it was priced to undercut the Mac. In fact, the Atari ST would be nicknamed the low end Mac, or even 'Jackintosh', a blend made up of Jack and Macintosh of course.\n\nIt has three graphical resolution modes, low, medium and high resolutions, with low displaying 16 colours, medium displaying 4 colours, and high displaying in monochrome. High resolution is considered the resolution for professional software applications. The sound chip, a Yamaha YM2149F has 3 square wave voices, plus 1 voice dedicated to noise. A chip which is a derivative of the AY-3-8910. It came with a separate single sided floppy drive, external PSU and built in Musical Instrument Digital Interface, or MIDI DIN ports, to allow connection to professional digital music instruments. It was also bundled with a certain rodent-esque thing called a mouse, and a DMA, or ACSI (Atari Computer System Interface) port for connecting something called a hard disk drive. Surely stuff from another dimension!?\n\nThe Atari 260ST is a European 512K of RAM version initially destined to have 256K of RAM, hence the name, and the Atari 520ST+ is the 1024K, or rather 1MB of RAM version. The Atari 520STM is a 520ST but with a TV modulator, hence STM. This allowed connection to a TV so the consumer did not have to purchase a monitor.\n\nAtari 520STF / 1040STF / 2080STF\n\nIn 1986, the ST was repackaged as the STF. The Atari STF integrates the ST's external PSU into its casing, along with a double sided floppy drive, hence STF, 'F' for floppy. Myth or fact, it was reportedly going to be called the STD, but as the story goes, once it was realised what this acronym usually represents, Atari decided that would be Somewhat Tragically Dangerous. The joystick ports were also moved to underneath the case, yes that's right, underneath, which was to make way for the now internal floppy drive. The 520STF is the successor to the 520ST, and the 1040STF is the successor to the 520ST+, which meant it came with 1MB of RAM. In the United States, the 1040STF became the first 1MB computer to be sold for under $1,000. There was reportedly an Atari 2080STF, which was by and large a prototype, and never saw an official release. However in the then Yugoslavia, and also Hungary, local distributors could update machines with 2MB of onboard RAM and an updated badge.\n\nAtari 260STFM / 520STFM / 1040STFM\n\nLate '86 saw the introduction of the STFM, you guessed it, 'F' for floppy and 'M' for modulator, as this model combined what was introduced with both the STF and STM models. There is a 260STFM model which happened to be an early model variant. However the 520STFM which came with 512K of RAM quickly became the base STFM machine. The STFM cycled through TOS 1.0, TOS 1.02 and TOS 1.04 during its lifespan, and as such it is capable of housing and supporting a BLiTTER chip.\n\nIt was at this time that prices really started to drop, as the Amiga 500 started to gain ground after Atari got the 16-bit jump on Commodore. In the UK Atari were now selling STs in packs, with marketing leaning towards the gamer, offering the iconic Atari CX40 joystick and a bunch of games. There was the Super Pack, the Explorer Pack, Discovery Pack / Tandy Discovery Pack Plus, Professional Pack, Summer Pack and Power Pack to name some of the bundles for this model. The 1040STFM came a little later, and was the 1MB version.\n\nI have engrained memories of the 520STFM Super Pack, as it is the version my beloved parents purchased for me as a Christmas gift in 1988. I remember selling my Atari 800XL to assist, and since that Christmas this ST has always been set up, and as such has become one of those inanimate objects that I have come to have affection for. It has become the one object that defines my adolescence, serves as a reminder of my belated father, and which defines my interests to this day. From a games machine playing those beautiful Bitmap Brothers games, to a study computer using Atari Works and Papyrus for college projects, and finally as a music computer in my music studio using Steinberg Cubase, it has been, and still is a work horse! I am proud to say my STFM has never been resigned to the loft, and was my sole computer for 15 years until 2003, when I finally caved in and purchased a Fujitsu Siemens Amilo D7830 laptop. This only meant my ST's sole purpose was to then be a MIDI computer in my home music studio, where it has remained until this day.\n\nAtari Portfolio\n\nThe Atari Portfolio, introduced in mid 1989, was the world first Palmtop PC. It was conceived by DIP Research Ltd in Guilford in the UK, soon licensing the product to Atari thereafter, with DIP releasing their own DIP Pocket PC at a cheaper price. It is powered by three AA batteries, and houses an Intel 80C88 CPU running at 4.9152 MHz, and 128K of RAM. It came with 256K of ROM, which also stores the operating system, namely DIP DOS 2.11, a DOS compatible OS, and an LCD displaying 260 x 64 pixels. There is an expansion port on the right hand side of the device, for Parallel, Serial, Modem, MIDI and floppy drive modules, and on the left, a memory expansion slot for Bee Card type memory. Internally it has text editor, spreadsheet, time manager and phone book software. It could also get you free money from an ATM, piece of cake! Well at least it could in the movies!\n\nAtari Lynx\n\nMeanwhile on the gaming front, and again in September 1989, a new concept was brewing. Handily named project 'Handy', a venture which began at software company Epyx. In short Atari was introduced to assist with the project as Epyx lacked the hardware experience and marketing of the same. This Handy cartridge based handheld games console, would become the Atari Lynx, with Epyx soon to go bust, Atari would become the outright owner. This was off the back of Nintendo's Gameboy DMG-01, the first cartridge based handheld device launched earlier the same year. Atari however with the Lynx, introduced a colour 3.5\" LCD screen capable of displaying 4096 colours, making it the first colour handheld. It was also the first 16-bit handheld, introducing the 16-bit Mikey and Suzy CMOS chips, both running at 16MHz, and an 8-bit DAC for each of the 4 channels, with 64K of RAM. It also has cool features like sprite zooming and an ambidextrous layout meaning it can be played by both right and left handed gamers, another world first. It was a powerful machine, sporting beautiful games including Shadow of the Beast, and arcade conversions like, APB, California Games, Xybots and Ms Pacman. However due to the lack of initial software support, and poor battery life, the less powerful Nintendo Gameboy would ultimately prove the champion, ludicrous when you think of the specification difference, but a lesson in how important software is, a lesson Atari knew since the 2600 days.\n\nAtari PC4\n\nThe Atari PC4 was realised prior to the PC5, but ironically was released after it in approximately May 1988, around 2 months post the aforementioned. It is technically the last in the 'Atari PC' series, and the first of the 286 Atari PCs as we will later come to see. It has an AMD 80286 processor clocked at a switchable 8, 12 or 16MHz, larger 1MB of RAM upgradeable to 8MB, reportedly either a Seagate 30MB, 60MB or 66MB hard drive, an Epson SD-680L 5.25\" or a 3.5\" 1.44MB floppy drive. It could also be configured with a SyQuest 44MB removable media drive. Again it has the usual ports, as well as a digital monitor port, and again support for EGA, CGA, Hercules and monochrome displays, however now included the now VGA standard, an XT slot, four 16-bit ISA slots and natively runs MS-DOS 3.30, BASIC and GEM, and capable of running OS/2 v1.2. It is essentially housed in the same PC3 housing, albeit in a different colour scheme. As a footnote, there is also Mitac manufactured Atari PC4 which runs on an Intel 80286 at 8MHz.\n\nAtari Transputer Workstation (ATW)\n\nIn 1988, embracing Transputer technology, Atari announced the Atari Transputer Workstation (ATW). Initially conceived as the ABAQ, the technology centres around the INMOS T800-20 processor, plus a Motorola 68000, hence why this system is also known as the ATW800. It was naturally a high end computer, also boasting an FPU, an upgradable design whereby a further 16 T800 CPUs could be added internally via 'farm cards', with an unlimited number of T800s able to be added externally. It has four expansion slots via the T800 bus, and one expansion slot via the 68000 bus, 4MB of RAM via the T800, expandable to 16MB of RAM, 512K of RAM via the 68000, expandable to 1MB. It has a high specification graphics card named 'Blossom', mouse and joystick ports, and standard ports such as an RS-232, MIDI ports, a Parallel port, SCSI and DMA interfaces. The internal SCSI was 40MB in capacity. As you may gather, it uses Transputer technology coupled with technology from the ST, namely the Mega ST. In fact it uses the Mega ST as its I/O subsystem, and as such as a system could either be housed in the ATW tower, or added to a Mega ST as an expansion. It utilises a HeliOS operating system, a UNIX-esque OS developed by Perihelion Software, again from the UK, designed primarily for Transputers. This Atari then was very much a UK designed machine, unlike its Atari predecessors.\n\nAtari ABC 286/30 and 286/60\n\nThe ABC 286 was initially announced In October at the 1989 PC Show at Earl's Court, London. There were two models of the Atari ABC 286 introduced to market in 1990, the ABC 286/30 and ABC 286/60, the naming convention of course referring to the 80286 processor, as well as the size of hard drive the models came shipped with, both 30MB and 60MB respectively. During their lifespan however, both machines could be configured from factory to run at either 8MHz, 10MHz, 12MHz, 16MHz or 20MHz, and could be configured with a SyQuest 44MB removable media drive, and either a 5.25″ 1.2MB or 1.44MB 3.5\" floppy drive. Both had the option of a 80287 co-processor, have 3 AT slots, an AT keyboard and mouse and the usual array of ports the Atari PC series introduced. The ABC 286/30 has 640K of RAM expandable to 1MB, while the ABC 286/60 has 1MB of RAM expandable to 8MB. The ABC 286/30 has EGA, CGA, Hercules and monochrome display support, whereas the ABC 286/60 has the aforementioned as well as VGA support according to brochure literature.\n\nAtari TT030\n\nWait a minute, where did the ST go? As the story goes, Atari wanted to introduce a top of the range system running a Unix Operation System, known as the Atari TT / 030X. However Atari was delayed porting Unix to the TT, officially known as Atari System V Unix, so eventually Atari decided to abandon the idea and instead the Atari TT was conceived with TOS 3.01, running on a Motorola 68030 in place of the initial 68020 that was intended. Given this, the TT is essentially a high end ST, and although some will argue this, is a part of the ST family, a collective term for all TOS based machines running a Motorola 680x0 CPU. Released in 1990, the TT also boasts a Motorola 68882 FPU and came with 2MB of RAM, expandable to 12MB (known as ST RAM), and a 50MB hard drive. To utilise the speed of the 68030, TT RAM was also introduced alongside the ST RAM, expandable to 256MB. The CPU was destined to run at 16MHz, as early models testify, but given the 68030's capabilities, it was later clocked to 32MHz, however for backwards ST software compatibility, the system bus is restricted to run at 16MHz. It came with the familiar ACSI port, but also a new SCSI port for a wider choice of peripherals such as external hard drives and CD-ROMs, MIDI ports, essentially two RS-232s, Serial LAN RS-422, Printer, VGA Monitor (RGB and Mono), Extra Disk drive port, VMEbus for further expansion capabilities such as graphics cards, a detachable keyboard, joystick and mouse ports. For sound, well that was inspired by the STE with the same YM2149F sound chip, and 8-bit DMA stereo sound supporting up to 50 kHz of sample playback. All making for a beautiful machine marketed towards business and DTP users, notably in the German market. The TT was never marketed as a games, multimedia or music production based machine, although the capability of course is there.\n\nAtari Falcon030\n\nAtari's home computer swan song, the Atari Falcon was released in 1992, with its beginnings stemming from the Sparrow / FX-1 project. The Falcon arrived with a Motorola 68030 CPU like the Atari TT but running at 16MHz, optional Motorola 68881 or 68882 FPU, again like the TT with the 68882, but with a Motorola 56001 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) running at 32MHz, a YM3429F, a CMOS version of Yamaha's YM2149F sound chip for backwards compatibility, a true colour 'VIDEL' graphics processor, and RAM expandable from 1MB to 4 or 14MB. It too has a BLiTTER for backwards compatibility and an optional internal IDE hard drive, available from 65MB stock from Atari. It has the usual array of ports we have become familiar with, like the enhanced joystick ports from the STE, a Serial port, Parallel port, TV modulator, monitor connector, and also a SCSI II connector, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a 3.5mm microphone jack, a DSP port and a mini LAN port.\n\nIt is housed in the familiar Atari ST casing, in particular STE, but in a slightly different grey to that of the ST range, and with a darker grey keyboard. However there was an early Falcon design with a similar colour scheme to the ST. There were also Sparrow FX-1 prototypes which were a different grey again, and sporting yellow lettering on the keyboard. Among the prototypes there was also the Atari Microbox, of which there were a few variations. Sony acquired the patents of the Microbox for the design of its Sony PlayStation 2, and although sources differ to which is the so called 'Painter' project version, there was also another Atari Microbox prototype with or without a CD-ROM drive. A lot of information interchanges between these prototypes, however they were speculatively 68030 based, but could be upgradeable to a Motorola 68040. Lastly, there was the rumoured Falcon040 machine which was apparently nearing release, yet this also never saw the light of day.\n\nThe Falcon had been a long awaited machine, certainly with the delays to market after Atari closed their Tamshui, Taiwan plant, favouring a switch to manufacturing arrangements with various subcontractors. With the Atari TT marketed towards the business end, the Falcon was marketed as a multimedia machine, and was geared towards video and music production, not an out and out games or business machine as people tend to forget. What the ST was to MIDI, the Falcon was for audio, being the first affordable computer to be able to record audio to hard disk out of the box (literally with D2D Systems accompanying Falcon D2D software) courtesy of the internal DSP, and again it meant Atari was once again pitted against Commodore in the shape of their 32-bit Amiga 1200, at least it was in the media, if not commercially.\n\nThere were the series of NeXT computers unofficially released from late 1989 with the NeXT Cube, sporting a Motorola 56001 DSP like the Falcon, offering audio recording ability, as well as the SRS IRIS Indigo released in '91. However although these machines pre-date the Falcon, they were not easily affordable, nor were they aimed at the home consumer market with initial prices from $6,500 and $8,000 respectively. This is compared to the base Atari Falcon launch price of $799, albeit without a hard drive, or with the recommended clock patch update.\n\nDuring 1989 and '90 there were also hard disk audio offerings for the Mac(s) of the time, via Digidesign and Opcode software, but again these were not out of the box solutions, but required to utilise Digidesign's own Sound Tools DSP (again incorporating a Motorola 56001). Circa the same time period for such products being released for the ST, such as the ADAP II from Hybrid Arts for example. This reason alone makes the Falcon a milestone home computer.\n\nThis was the machine I always coveted, as it was familiar to me as an ST owner, but for the time power and a slightly different look which gauged my interest. It arrived on the scene when my Atari based studio was in its infancy, but with the promise of out of the box hard disk recording for music applications, or DAWs as we know them today, naturally then, this was the home computer I dreamed of but could never really afford. All that changed circa 2012 when I managed to land a pristine Falcon at a bargain price.\n\nThe Falcon turned out to be short lived, given Atari decided to cease production in 1993 to focus on their next generation console, the 64-bit Atari Jaguar. However that was not quite the end of the Falcon, its video and audio capabilities would be further extended.\n\nAtari Jaguar\n\nLike the Falcon, the Atari Jaguar was a long awaited machine, I for one remember reading ST Format and the articles regarding both the forthcoming Falcon and Jaguar machines, as well as tuning into the UK's Bad Influence to get the low down on the same. In Europe in 1994 it finally came, the marketed 64-bit fifth generation console, the Atari Jaguar, the first 64-bit console, although that is a well versed bone of contention, and second of the fifth generation consoles after the 3DO. Technically the Jaguar comprised of two 32-bit processors named Tom, and of course Jerry. It came with one Power Pad controller, and some came packaged with the game Cybermorph. Note worthy official and third party peripherals include the Pro Controller, the Atari Jaguar CD, the beautiful CatBox from ICD, the ScatBox from ScatoLOGIC, the Jaguar GameDrive, and the SkunkBoard, of which there are a few revisions . The Jaguar is a cartridge based console, but with the Jaguar CD add on, can also be a CD based multimedia machine.\n\nAs with the Atari Falcon, I was a late developer when it came to the Atari Jaguar, I managed to find a good one circa 2003, and started purchasing mint conditioned game titles I thought worthy for not so much cash, which is more than what can be said for prices now. The Jaguar does get a bad wrap, and I appreciate why, it doesn't have the strength in depth when it comes to its games catalogue, and some games simply suck. However that said, there are some very nice titles, Alien vs Predator, NBA Jam, Zool 2, Pinball Fantasies, Sensible Soccer, Ultra Vortek, Atari Karts, Tempest 2000 and Breakout 2000 to name a few.\n\nHowever the Jaguar's games catalogue would perhaps contribute to its downfall. That, as well as the fierce competition from its fifth generation rivals, the 3DO, and notably the Sega Saturn, the 32-bit powerhouse that is the Sony PlayStation, and the 64-bit Nintendo 64. This then, would be Atari's final foray into home computer and games console markets, and would ultimately be its death knell, with Atari merging and ultimately selling its remaining assets and name to a hard drive company called JTS.. With Atari selling off its inventory, the original Jaguar moulds were sold to a dental company called Imagin Systems, who in turn used these moulds for the Imagin HotRod, a dental imaging camera. A fitting end? At least Atari would still be bringing smiles to peoples faces!\n\nSubsequently JTS sold the name and assets of its Atari division to Hasbro Interactive in 1998.\n\nIn 2001 a French company called Infogrames acquired Hasbro Interactive, and as such inherited the Atari name and of course assets. A company with an acquisition history, who also bought out Atari Inc. in 2008, sold Atari Europe to Namco Bandai in 2009, and renamed itself to Atari SA in the same year, now utilising the infamous Atari logo as its own.\n\nAttack of the Clones!\n\nClones of Atari TOS compatibles began in the late 80s, however when the demise of Atari as we knew it hit during the early to mid 90s, a series of pure high end TOS clones began emerging. At this point it is perhaps worth elaborating on the term 'TOS clone', which often gets misused, especially given publications of the time were often misusing the term. A TOS clone does not include those machines which were either backed by Atari such as C-Lab Falcons, which utilised Atari Falcon motherboards either re-used or re-manufactured, iteratively upgraded over time. By the same principle, this includes the SoundPool Audio Workstation, Tecnation Sonovista and any TOS machine which re-houses an Atari motherboard upgraded or not. A TOS clone is any machine not emulated, not designed or built by Atari, but designed and manufactured from inception with the sole purpose of cloning an Atari TOS compatible, and only TOS.\n\nMedusa T40 / T60\n\nRumours were gaining momentum in late 1993 of an Atari TT clone in the offing. These rumours were realised when Fredi Aschwanden and his Swiss based Medusa Computer Systems unveiled the Medusa T40 at the Compo stand in March '94 at CeBIT, in Hanover, Germany. This 32-bit clone released in the latter part of 1994 began as a hobbyist project to integrate a Motorola 68040 processor into an ST. However the project expanded to a fully equipped TOS based 040 computer running at 64MHz, and incorporating up to 128MB of onboard PS/2 RAM. TOS 3.06 was licensed from Atari and subsequently patched, and featured an ST In / Out card, an ET4000 based graphics card, an HD floppy drive, a 270MB IDE drive, with ACSI and ISA ports, with expandable support for SCSI, VME and ROM ports, all wrapped up in an AT 'white box' tower case, TT keyboard and mouse. In this configuration the T40 cost circa 8000 DM, which was around £3,000 at the time. You could however just purchase the motherboard. The T60, a Motorola 68060 version of the Medusa debuted in November 1994 at ProTOS in Bonn, Germany.\n\nGE-Soft Eagle\n\nNext on the rumour mill was a bird or prey known as the Eagle, from GE-Soft. This German TT clone also made its debut in November 1994 at ProTOS, and again used a version of TOS 3.06 licensed from Atari. The base Eagle came with a Motorola 68030 and a 68882 FPU at 32MHz, 4MB of ST RAM, expandable up to 14MB and 256MB of TT RAM. It offered ACSI, SCSI, VME, MIDI, Parallel, ROM, 2 Serial, 2 Modem, TT and PC keyboard and LAN ports, with an HD floppy drive, 320MB SCSI drive and an ET4000 or ATI MACH64 graphics card via the VME. Its expansion options were supported via its own proprietary bus known as 'Eagle Channels', of which there were 8, and reportedly it was possible to upgrade the Eagle to a Motorola 68040. All said however, the Eagle was a short lived machine, with GE-Soft filing for bankruptcy soon after.\n\nMedusa Hades 040 / 060\n\nA machine which was part Gorgon and part god, but certainly all Atari, was unveiled in November at ProTOS 95 in Germany, the beautifully named Medusa Hades. As a TT clone it offered 4 PCI buses, 2 ISA buses, 1 VME bus, an EIDE hard drive, a SCSI II port, 2 Modem, LAN, MIDI, Parallel, AT style keyboard, Atari joystick and mouse ports, with a floppy drive supporting DD, HD and ED formats. Base RAM was 4MB, yet it was predominantly sold with a minimum of 8MB, later bumped to 32MB utilising PS/2 FPM / EDO modules, with expansion of up to 1GB. Graphics card support was powerful at the time with PCI and ISA support, as was all manner of expansion possibilities, supporting a ROM port card known as ROPO-COP, the StartTrack DSP, as well as various networking options. The Hades of course came in 68040 and 68060 flavours inclusive of FPU, clocked at 64MHz and 60MHz respectively, and again ran a patched version of TOS 3.06 known as 'Hades TOS'.\n\nMilan ComputerMilan 040\n\nThe Milan 040 from Milan Computer GbR was launched in June 1998. A TOS compatible from Germany, this time however being technically an Atari Falcon clone. TOS 4.04 was licensed from Atari and formed the basis for the re-worked 'Milan TOS'. The Milan, as the name alludes was centred around a Motorola 68040 processor with FPU. A little less known perhaps by us English speaking folk, is that it again takes its name from a bird of prey, the Milan, or Kite as it is known in English. It included 4 PCI buses, 3 ISA buses, 2 IDE buses, 2 Serial, AT keyboard and Parallel ports, with an HD floppy drive. RAM was upgradable via PS/2 EDO modules up to 512MB. Like the Medusa Hades, expansion possibilities were plentiful, with graphic card expansion via PCI or ISA ports, VME expansion via PCI, SCSI cards and the StarTrack DSP for example. The Milan could be bought as a motherboard only, or as a complete system, and latterly could be upgraded with a Motorola 68060. A Milan II was in the making, which was to be a new machine with a 68060 from the outset, but sadly never went into production.\n\nInventronik Suska\n\nHailing from Stuttgart, Germany, and circa 2003, an STE FPGA clone concept was only just being conceived. In subsequent years however, Wolfgang of Inventronik GmbH has re-defined the Suska as the Suska II, and various versions of Suska III. In the Suska III-C for example, it offers a Cyclone II FPGA, SDRAM, an HD floppy drive by way of a D-Sub connector, ACSI, SCSI, an SD card slot, Atari monitor, VGA, MIDI, Parallel, Atari and PS/2 keyboard, mouse and joystick ports. an audio out and so on... Technically multiple core operating systems can be run from the Suska, however as a concept, its purpose is to run solely as a TOS compatible, running either TOS, or EmuTOS. This is in contrast to the popularity of other FPGA systems which now are designed from day one to run multiple core operating systems, systems like the MiST or MiSTer, which although very versatile, I don't consider pure TOS clones by concept.\n\nMy, and countless others infatuation with Atari continues on in our adulthood, yet no matter how you feel about them, fan or not, they are an intrinsic part of Silicone Valley and the history of venture capital, computing and gaming. Amidst the successes, failures, odd decisions and controversy, they continue to bring an emotional element to a digital age. After all, can you tell the story of Commodore without Atari, can you track back Apple's past without recognition of Atari's pivotal influence, can you catalogue computing history without a footnote given to Atari?\n\nIndeed, with its chequered history some now feel Atari is not the company it once was, and there is a valid argument for that, accentuated by Atari's own downfall, and by our own high expectations fuelled by emotion and nostalgia. Yet equally there is also an argument realising all companies evolve in one way or another, and all adapt to suit market conditions. Was the Tramiel led company the same as it was under Kassar or Bushnell? No Atari wasn't, but many of us still hold true to those eras. Atari may only be Atari in name presently, but times are changing, and our expectations perhaps ought to be awakened with a dose of reality. After all Atari are not market leaders, and we shouldn't be thinking of them as such as we constantly do, beating them down if they don't live up to our own nostalgic hype. Given time, who knows what the future may realise, but I for one hope one day the 'Atari Curse' is quashed! To be continued..."
