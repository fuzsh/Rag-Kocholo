        "text": "http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/154016-coming-soon/\n\nFailsafe is being worked for the Atari 7800. It is a sequel to the Atari 5200 game Countermeasure. Failsafe was called Countermeasure 2 before the author was asked to change the name.\n\nThe author that is doing this game is also responsible for Space Invaders, Space Duel, Asteroids Deluxe, Pac-man Collection, Jr. Pac-man, and Super Pac-man.\n\nThe author said the differences between Countermeasure and Failsafe are the following:\n\nThis game is 'destination-based', meaning you need to reach the other end of the level to get one of the hexidecimal numbers for the code\n\nIt scrolls left/right instead of up/down. You start on the left and work your way right. You cannot scroll backward.\n\nThere are 4 digits in the code, 0-9 and A-F. There are 6 Levels in total, 5 of which give you a random position in the code.\n\nThe 6th level has the Missile Silo, and you must get through a minefield to get to it.\n\nIf you don't reach the Missile Silo in time, or you cannot guess the launch code in time, the planet explodes, and the game ends.\n\nIf you do enter the correct code, the game starts over, but harder :twisted:\n\nTwo new types of enemies, aside from the Pillboxes, Jeeps, and Cruize Missiles found in the original\n\nwant to put 'powerups' in the game, but not sure if I'll have the room.\n\nThe game is a work in progress. I was one of the people that download the game and I feel the games difficulty is a an issue. It is extremely hard even on the first level on Novice mode. Other people that tested the game had problems with that also. I don't know if this was the case with Countermeasure since I never own an Atari 5200 or played any Atari 5200 games. The graphics are good for an Atari 7800 game though.\n\nThe difficulty is being worked on the programmer, so this issue will be solved.\n\nI don't know if the AtariAge store will have this game once it is finished. The store is still down.\n\nMy best advice is to be an Atariage member because the people that make the games actually sell the games to other Atariage members with there being a limited amount of cartridges being made before the Atariage store gets them sometimes.\n\nFrenzy oh man. Does the 7800 have a good Berzerk port or any Exidy arcade games (Mouse Trap, Venture, Pepper II) -- seriously I'd get one if I could satisfy my desire for old arcade IPs who have rights in limbo land and no real chance of a Wii port -- besides I could get some classic 2600 carts as well!\n\nThe only question would be what kind of controllers to use (I've seen some interesting ones at look like NES pads with sticks, but I'm not sure how comfortable they would be) and how to get past the wife (she's been fairly tolerant of the row of Wiis, but if it looks like I'm heading into console collection territory I may have some heavy negotiating to do)...\n\nSean+Aaron wrote:\n\nFrenzy oh man.

The only version that is available for the system is the 2600 version. The only Atari 7800 Exidy game is Crossbow and that is a light gun game. Mouse Trap,and Venture are in Atari 2600 Cartridge form only. I can't tell you the big differences with those two games for the Atari 2600 and the arcade since I was born in the late 1970's. The amount of Atari 7800 Exidy ports might change in the future. The author of Failsafe mostly does Arcade ports from the late 1970's to 1983. The catch is besides Frenzy, and finishing Failsafe, he has his hands full with trying to help a new Atari 7800 programmer for finishing or fix bugs with 3 games.\n\nI have an answer for controllers. The Nes style controller for the Atari 7800 works good on some games like Commando. The controller is considered a thumb pad by some. The problem is that controller has problems with some games like Pac-man style games. American Atari 7800 owners call the Nes Style Controller for the Atari 7800 the Euro pad.\n\nThe Atari 7800 Pro line controllers are terrible for games like Commando. The proline Controllers are completely different than the Nes style Controller.The Proline Controllers in some ways are like the control sticks found in the arcades.\n\nThe Proline controllers are not the most comfortable controllers on the planet, but they are not the worst controllers ever though. The Proline controllers bothers my wrist or my arms cramp up for some games like Double Dragon and Commando after 30 or 40 minutes .\n\nA good amount Atari 7800 games work with 1 button. That means you can use a 2600 game controller, 3rd party Atari 2600 controllers for the Atari 7800 without using a control converter."
