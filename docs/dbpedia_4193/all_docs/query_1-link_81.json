        "text": "Fashions are cyclical, and retro enthusiasts have been enjoying a sweet moment for a few years now thanks to the official re-releases of many old consoles. The latest to jump on the bandwagon is the legendary Atari; the company has announced the Atari 2600+, a new console compatible with the vast majority of Atari 2600 and Atari 7800 games, and with HDMI output.\n\nAll about the Atari 2600+: price, features, and where to buy\n\nThe Atari 2600 was the first console released by Atari in 1977. In the middle of 2023, no less than 46 years later, the company announced the Atari 2600+, a new official console with HDMI output, widescreen mode, and several other improvements to the console’s quality of life.\n\nOne of the main attractions of this new game console is the fact that it is an official release. It is not a clone produced by third parties and it has some interesting features for our time:\n\nThe Atari 2600+ includes a CX40+ joystick that has been recreated to the same specifications as the original, and also comes with a ten-in-one game cartridge with the following games:\n\nAccording to the official website, the Atari 2600+ costs $129.99 and can be paid in four installments. It will be available in other countries besides the United States, although at the time of writing the complete list of countries and stores is not yet available."
