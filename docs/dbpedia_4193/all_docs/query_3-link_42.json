        "text": "Today, PLAION and Atari officially release the Atari 2600+, a remake of the granddaddy of all video game consoles. Most importantly, the Atari 2600+ lets you play your original Atari 2600 and 7800 cartridges on modern televisions with its HDMI port. Additionally, the Atari 2600+ can play both Atari 2600 and Atari 7800 games. The system also allows you to play all Atari games in widescreen mode.\n\nThe system comes with a CX40+ Joystick which has been recreated to the same specifications as the original, and a 10-in-1 game cartridge featuring some of Atari’s most famous games: Adventure®, Combat®, Dodge ‘Em™, Haunted House®, Maze Craze™, Missile Command®, RealSports® Volleyball, Surround™, Video Pinball™, Yars’ Revenge®.\n\nIn addition, numerous accessories are available on Atari’s webshop, such as a two-button gamepad, which is needed to play the Atari 7800 games.\n\nThe Atari 2600+ compatibility list\n\nIf you have a substantial Atari 2600 collection, you might wonder if your games are compatible with the ‘System-on-a-chip’ machine. It is emulated hardware, and with many comparable devices, compatibility isn’t always guaranteed. Atari themselves claim 99% compatibility. Of the list of games Atari published, the following Atari 2600 games failed their own compatibility test:\n\nRealSports® Boxing\n\n2 Pack Special Motocross / Boom Bang\n\nJames Bond 007\n\nPitfall II: Lost Caverns\n\nOmega Race\n\nMasters of the Universe: The Power of He-Man\n\nOf all the games tested these notable games are untested:\n\nBurgerTime\n\nPinball\n\nQ*bert’s Qubes\n\nRiver Patrol\n\nRobot Tank\n\nStar Force\n\nStar Warrior\n\nPitfall II and RealSports Boxing are the most noticeable games known to be not working. River Patrol and BurgerTime are personal favorites, but their compatibility remains untested. We hope to report on the functionality of these games soon. You can check the complete compatibility list on Atari’s website. Atari’s website. Although some games are still untested, no Atari 7800 games have failed the compatibility test."
