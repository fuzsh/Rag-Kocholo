        "text": "NOTE: Although the 4 main features of this boxset are housed in individual keep cases (see images below) they are not sold separately at this time and can only be obtained in the Fox Charlie Chan Collection Volume 1 Boxset.\n\nDespite the poor condition of the films - even post digital restoration (prior to which Fox spent over $2 million restoring all of their Chan and Mr. Moto films.) I was astonished at what an immense fan I have become of this vintage cinema that I really had not delved into too deeply on previous occasions. The films in this boxset are all wonderful early 30's mysteries.\n\nImage: the 'In London\" and \"In Paris\" editions suffer from multiple damage marks that are less intense than I have seen previously but the rendering to digital (and the digital cleanup) have left visible artifacts. Contrast is quite poor but the films are certainly watchable. \"In Egypt\" contrast improves but light scratches are still noticeable. \"In Shanghai\" is the best of the four main features but still has digital noise (masqueraded as grain). It has far less damage marks. Eran Trece looks very acceptable with deep black levels that surely have been boosted.\n\nAudio - again falling a little short - some audible hiss is noticeable but overall dialogue is fairly consistent and clear. It is expected considering the age of the films but good enough for standard viewing and acceptable if you are anticipating it. Comparatively speaking it may be a small notch above the video quality.\n\nAll edition has optional yellow subtitles in English and Spanish.\n\nExtras - 3 good featurettes are included in the set, as well as Eran Trece (sharing space on the Charlie Chan in Shanghai dual-layered disc). The featurettes appear to have been made at the same time as the same interviewees and contributors are seen on all three. The information imparted is generally very well presented with archival flashbacks. The specific supplements are listed here:\n\nThe Legacy of Charlie Chan (On \"In London\" disc) - 15mins\n\nIn Search of Charlie Chan (On \"In Paris\" disc) - 20 mins\n\nThe Real Charlie Chan (On \"In Egypt\" disc) - 20 mins\n\nEran Trece (1931) (On \"In Shanghai\" disc) - 79 mins\n\nCharlie Chan In London Theatrical Trailer\n\nEran Trece Theatrical Trailer\n\nNOTE: Eran Trece is the Spanish-language version, with a different cast and crew, of the Charlie Chan film Charlie Chan Carries On (1931), in which Charlie sets out to discover the killer of an American found dead in a London hotel room. It is very interesting seeing Manuel Arbó as Chan - another interpretation of the great detective.\n\nIn conclusion, the star of this boxset are the films - no question. They round out at approx. $5 a film - plus 4 have their own keep cases. This is an excellent deal in my opinion. For fans of Charlie Chan it is a no-brainer, but even for those yet to discover the enjoyment of the humble Asian detective, I consider it an essential purchase. The image and audio quality are not sterling but the price gives it immense value."
