        "text": "Charlie Chan, Volume I\n\nIn a medium founded on action, Charlie Chan remains one of the few heroic figures in American film to function proudly as an intellectual. Chan's adventures in ratiocination were first recounted by Earl Derr Biggers in a series of six successful novels and eventually in 47 films made from 1926 to 1949 (as well as in a few parodies and semi-parodies that came after).\n\nThis courtly detective — an employee of the Honolulu Police Department on seemingly permanent leave — stands as one of the best-loved characters in American movies, a tribute above all to the warmth and gentle humor that the Swedish-born actor Warner Oland brought to the role during his 1931-to-1938 tenure as Chan. (Sidney Toler, who stepped into the role after Mr. Oland's early death, continued very much in the Oland tradition.)\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Home Video has released four of the first Oland films on DVD in the first volume of what you hope will be a complete set of that studio's Chan films. (After World War II, the franchise moved with much-reduced budgets to the poverty-row studio Monogram; six of those films were released by MGM last year.) The decision represents a reversal for Fox, which had once removed the films from Fox Movie Channel, apparently embarrassed by the European Oland's \"yellowface\" portrayal of an Asian character.\n\nAre the Chan films racist? Not, I think, by the standards of their time. Mr. Biggers is said to have created Chan (based on a real detective, Chang Apana, who worked for the Honolulu police) to counter the negative images of Asians being fueled by the Hearst papers' \"yellow peril\" campaigns and embodied most repellently by Sax Rohmer's sadistic \"Oriental\" villain, Dr. Fu Manchu. Mr. Oland, a popular heavy of the silent era who played practically every ethnicity available (including, on occasion, a Swede), was the screen's first Fu Manchu, in the 1929 \"Mysterious Doctor Fu Manchu\" and three subsequent films for Paramount.\n\nRecruited by Fox in 1931 for \"Charlie Chan Carries On,\" a film that is now lost, Mr. Oland seemed to spend the balance of his life and career making up for the excesses of the Fu Manchu character. In the Fox set, both \"Charlie Chan in London\" (1934) and \"Charlie Chan in Paris\" (1935) contain scenes in which Chan coolly and wittily dispatches other characters' racist remarks. Chan, whose huge intellect mysteriously did not extend to an ability to master English articles (\"Joy in heart more desirable than bullet\"), might have been a stereotype, but he was a stereotype on the side of the angels.\n\nIn addition to \"Paris\" (long believed lost) and \"London,\" the Fox box contains \"Charlie Chan in Egypt\" and \"Charlie Chan in Shanghai\" (both 1935), as well as \"Eran Trece\" (\"They Were Thirteen,\" 1931), the Spanish-language version of the lost \"Charlie Chan Carries On,\" with the Spanish actor Manuel Arbó doing a careful Oland imitation in the Chan role. It's a reminder of the sad state of film preservation that three other early Chan films remain lost, though I'm at a loss to understand why Fox has not included \"The Black Camel,\" a 1931 film with Mr. Oland as Chan and featuring Bela Lugosi in a major role, which does exist.\n\nThe films have been restored from their once-familiar television syndication versions, and sound and picture quality is excellent, given the rarity and fragility of the original materials. The box set lists for $59.98; none of the films have been rated by the M.P.A.A.\n\nAnxious Animation\n\nOther Cinema, an independent label based in San Francisco, has added a compelling anthology called \"Anxious Animation\" to its rich catalog of independent and avant-garde shorts and features. \"Anxious\" features two masters of cutout animation, Lewis Klahr and Janie Geiser. Their work draws on found objects and illustrations to create infernal visions: of popular culture in Mr. Klahr's case (\"Lulu,\" \"Altair,\" \"Pony Glass\") and of ghosts of the sexual subconscious for Ms. Geiser (\"Immer Zu,\" \"Lost Motion\").\n\nThe work of the artistic collective made up of Eric Henry, Syd Garon and Rodney Ascher brings a mastery of digital techniques to the cutout aesthetic, adding a new level of technical polish and fluid movement. And for traditionalists, there are two wonderful hand-drawn shorts by Jim Trainor, in which those time-honored stars of commercial cartoons, anthropomorphized animals, reveal complex inner lives at the same time that they act out primitive biological needs (\"The Bats,\" \"The Moschops\").\n\nOther Cinema (online at othercinemadvd.com, should your Blockbuster be out of stock) also has an impressive backlist that includes important work by the Bronx's own camp pioneer Mike Kuchar (\"The Sins of the Fleshapoids,\" 1965); Bill Morrison's ineffably beautiful and heartbreaking study of the poetics of disintegrating film stock, \"Decasia\"; and Craig Baldwin's parable of individual revolt against a technological dictatorship, \"Spectres of the Spectrum,\" built out of bits and pieces of forgotten television shows and educational films. \"Anxious Animation\" is $24.95 and has not been rated.\n\nDeer Woman\n\nJohn Landis's contribution to \"Masters of Horror,\" the series originally broadcast by Showtime and now being issued by Anchor Bay Entertainment on DVD, is a masterly blend of comedy and shock that suggests a mellower, more relaxed version of Mr. Landis's 1981 hit, \"An American Werewolf in London.\" The setting is the Pacific Northwest, where a disgraced police detective is confronted with a series of grisly murders, apparently committed by a rampaging animal that has made its way into some unlikely intimate situations: a hotel room, the sleeping cab of a diesel truck.\n\nWorking from a script by his son, Max Landis, the director makes the material crackle, thanks to the precise framing and impeccable timing that mark him as one of the last great practitioners of classical Hollywood style. The copious extras — some three hours' worth — include interviews with most of the principals, a still gallery and a P.D.F. copy of the shooting script. $16.98, not rated.\n\nAlso Out Today\n\nSYRIANA Stephen Gaghan's ambitious, panoramic view of the global corruption produced by America's oil addiction stars George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright and Amanda Peet. Warner Home Video, $28.98, R.\n\nTHE HILLS HAVE EYES The French filmmaker Alexandre Aja (\"High Tension\") shot this remake of Wes Craven's 1977 horror film about a vacationing family attacked by a savage tribe. Twentieth Century Fox Home Video, $29.99, R.\n\nEIGHT BELOW From the Disney organization, the story of eight sled dogs stranded in Antarctica, as their trainer, Paul Walker, struggles to reach and rescue them. Frank Marshall directed. Buena Vista Home Entertainment, $29.99, PG."
