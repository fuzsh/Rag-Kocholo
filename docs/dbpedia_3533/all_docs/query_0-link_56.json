        "text": "When I was a student we worked something out, before we had any great understanding of lighting. If you put a lamp on the floor, it would look interesting. But when you mucked about with fill lighting and three-point lighting and realistic lighting and you didn’t know what you were doing, you just spoiled it. So the cry went out, “Just put a lamp on the floor!” It was quick and easy and it looked great, even if it didn’t make any sense.\n\nOn Sunday we had a double bill of THE BAT WHISPERS (1930) and the following year’s THE BLACK CAMEL, the which I understood to be the first surviving Charlie Chan movie with Warner Oland. (Run-down of earlier entries — Paul Leni’s THE CHINESE PARROT with Sôjin Kamiyama as Chan is currently lost, alas; so is the serial THE HOUSE WITHOUT A KEY featuring George Kuwa; BEHIND THAT CURTAIN, the earliest surviving Chan, has a bewildered-looking E.L. Park in a tiny cameo as Chan, looking as if he just wandered onto the set by mistake, an interesting approach to the role. You can enjoy his strange performance here at 1.18:51. That’s the last time an Asian actor is trusted with the role, and the Swedish Warner Oland debuts in CHARLIE CHAN CARRIES ON in 1931, which is also lost — but I’ve just learned that the Spanish-language version, ERAN TRECE, survives, with Manuel Arbó as a Latin Chan).\n\nAnyway, THE BLACK CAMEL is basically junk, but you can see director Hamilton MacFadden trying to get with the programme — he knows the camera should move on occasion, he’s just not sure why, and he continually struggles to set up a shot with three people who aren’t all facing away from the lens.\n\nHowever, when Oland’s Chan SAYS THE TITLE, he puts a lamp on the floor and it’s very effective.\n\nI would have given him more credit if we hadn’t just watched THE BAT WHISPERS in which Roland West shoots Chester Morris with a floor-lamp TWICE:\n\nTHE BAT WHISPERS is the only film in which Chester Morris is actually interesting, and it should be admitted that it’s not all due to the interesting lighting. His whole approach is different: when he gets his appeal to the audience not to give away the twist ending, he does it with a Wellesian twinkle absent from all his later performances. Maybe what he needed, like Welles, was to have the other actors removed so he could perform for us alone (Welles went so far as to have the jurors close their eyes when he did his big summing-up in COMPULSION). By a cruel twist of fate Morris found himself confined to B-movies so cheap there was no time to remove the supporting cast.\n\nRoland West, something of a visionary, had very little interest in performance despite marrying an actress, but he certainly had an eye for a striking visual. In this case, it looks like his eye had landed on Paul Leni’s THE LAST WARNING which has one of the best lamps on the floor shots in all cinema, and conceivably the first:\n\nShots like this make the loss of THE CHINESE PARROT even more tragic.\n\nOne more example — James Whale was a great admirer of THE LAST WARNING, but doesn’t provide as much floorlamping in FRANKENSTEIN as he would in its first sequel, which features maybe the best example of the bunch, combing low-level light with a high-level camera to give us this beauty:\n\nBest of all, it’s MOTIVATED by all that Kenneth Strickfaden lab equipment. Chester Morris is apparently generating his lamplight by star wattage alone.\n\nWe never get a clear look at Warner Oland’s chubby werewolf, and that has to be a good thing.\n\nIt’s taken me this long to watch WEREWOLF OF LONDON, and God knows I’ve tried. As a kid I was no doubt eager to see it, but it never seemed to turn up on UK TV. As an adult, I was excited to finally get my hands on the thing, and then found it impossible to sit through.\n\nThis time around — third time’s the charm — it didn’t seem THAT bad — despite several strikes against it, it has a number of appealing images and ideas.\n\nFirst the bad — Henry Hull is written as a completely unsympathetic boor, and that’s just how he plays it, with an added suggestion of indifference and superiority to the material. In the abstract, it’s kind of interesting the way the character perversely contradicts his own motivations — he’s jealous of his wife but either ignores her or drives her a way, he quickly becomes convinced he is indeed infected with “werewolfery” (or worse, “lycanthrophobia”) but rejects offers of help from the man who infected him. In practice, these traits are frustrating and dramatically self-defeating. “It defeats its own purpose,” as Jake LaMotta would say.\n\nHull lacks the physical presence and skill to make a convincing transformation, and his werewolf performance consists largely of making a face like he’s going to sneeze.\n\nThe comedy relief, zesty and startling in a James Whale film, is lumbering and ugly here. Last time I watched, I got as far as the two drunken landladies (one of them, Ethel Griffies, is the ornithologist from THE BIRDS — not that old, she would live another forty years). The film is full of menopausal women, Fiona pointed out, and they’re all played as clowns. Spring Byington (“So romantic, with the Thames lapping at one’s very threshold”) is the main culprit. Worse is the way the so-called hero’s lunar depredations are followed by jocular scenes at Scotland Yard, with the police chortling away together despite the wave of manglings sweeping the metropolis.\n\nGood stuff — going all the way to Tibet to get bitten by a werewolf is gloriously excessive.\n\nGratuitous killer plants! An entirely satisfying horror movie about rival botanists could probably be concocted with no need for werewolfery at all. Although, there’s THE WOMANEATER to prove me wrong.\n\nWarner Oland in a role maybe planned for Lugosi — now he’s a professor from the University of the Carpathians, with a Japanese name. And he’s a LOVELY werewolf, much nicer than H.H.\n\nAh-ah-ah…. CHOO!\n\nBut I dig the way Hull remains somewhat compos mentis when wolfing about — he actually turns into a werewolf and then PUTS ON A HAT to go out. And he gets a deathbed speech in werewolf form. Though the principles of Lon Chaney wolfman mythos are being laid down here in an early form, the story is still in large part Jekyll & Hyde.\n\nAlso — GREAT first transformation, using foreground columns which occlude the frame, in a relay of shots connected by hidden wipes, so that Hull’s makeup (by Universal monster supremo Jack Pierce) can develop in yak-fur increments."
