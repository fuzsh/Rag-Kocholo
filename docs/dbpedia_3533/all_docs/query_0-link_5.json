        "text": "The Golden Eye ( 1948 ) was released in Sydney by BEF in 1950 and would have had a full colour daybill produced by W.E.Smith for it's release.\n\nIn the early part of the 1950's Monogram /Allied Artists films distribution in Australia changed from BEF to United Artists. Films previously distributed by BEF such as The Golden Eye, Sky Dragon ( another Charlie Chan), Jiggs And Maggie In Society ( 1947 ) & others had re-release rights granted to smaller independent film distributors and they started to be re-released around 1954 by IFD with duotone daybills printed.. Later in the decade Monogram/ Allied Artists product previously released by UA were given re-release rights to National Films Of N.S.W. through IFD as well.\n\nThere should also be full colour daybills for Sky Dragon & Jiggs And Maggie In Society printed by BEF around somewhere.\n\nHondo\n\nSomething else of interest . Of the 17 films produced by Monogram and released in Australia by BEF I have only been able to find images of 8 full colour daybill posters along with 2 re-release IFD duotone posters.\n\nThis means there are 9 Charlie Chan full colour BEF daybill images not sighted. The missing Charlie Chan titles are---\n\nThe Chinese Cat\n\nBlack Magic\n\nThe Jade Mask\n\nDark Alibi\n\nShadows Over Chinatown\n\nThe Trap\n\nDocks Of New Orleans\n\nThe Golden Eye\n\nSky Dragon\n\nIf anyone has an image or images of any of these titles it would be appreciated if you would post them.\n\nIt is interesting that there are multiple copies of certain daybills from the 1940's such as Ziegfeld Follies, Woman Of The Year, Hamlet, The Picture Of Dorian Gray to name a few but there are still a lot of titles unacounted for.\n\nHondo"
