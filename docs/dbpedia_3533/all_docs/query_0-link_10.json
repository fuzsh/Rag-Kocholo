A copy of the herald was usually included in the advertising package that was sent to the press and cinemas. Heralds were also handed out by the cinemas to members of the public to advertise the forthcoming film. Heralds were used up to the mid 1970s. There is a blank area on the reverse of the herald, which allowed cinemas to print their own information.\n\nFor more history on Movie Heralds and Handbill click HERE\n\nNote: Cvtreasures stamp not on original\n\nThis product is featured in these collections:"
