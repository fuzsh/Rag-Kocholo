Photoplay Edition that features images from the film.\n\nThe character of Charlie Chan was created by Earl Derr Biggers as a counter to the stereotype of \"Yellow Peril,\" and as an alternative to the common practice of media to portray Asian characters as stoic, menacing villains. Chan was characterized as heroic, intelligent, handsome, and honorable, and was received well by the general public. His stories would go on to be featured in numerous movies, as well as radio and television adaptations.\n\nABOUT THIS BOOK:\n\nIn this 5th installment of the classic series of mysteries featuring Charlie Chan of the Honolulu Police, we meet Scotland Yard's Inspector Duff, first introduced in Behind That Curtain. Duff is pursuing a callous murderer on an around-the-world tour, and it is only when the ship is docked in Honolulu and Duff is gravely wounded, does Charlie Chan take on the case. This is decidedly unfortunate for the guilty party, because Chan has the culprit well in-hand before the ship makes its final stop.(Publisher). Good / good. Item #11168"
