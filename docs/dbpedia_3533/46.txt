HISTORY of HERALDS:

Heralds were first used in the 1910's, and were printed as an inexpensive advertising flyer, that usually included a picture of the leading actors and general Information about the film. A copy of the herald was usually included in the advertising package that was sent to the press and cinemas. Heralds were also handed out by the cinemas to members of the public to advertise the forthcoming film. Heralds were used up to the mid 1970s. There is a blank area on the reverse of the herald, which allowed cinemas to print their own information.
