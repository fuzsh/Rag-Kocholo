        "text": "\"A Kiss and a Promise\" has been remade, but the most unforgettable thing for me is the original Japanese drama, which is more than 20 years away! And the male protagonist Kashiwara Takashi is undoubtedly the most beautiful male star of that era, poking at the heart of a generation of young girls.\n\nThis name, for the face value of me, used to be particularly familiar, and even can memorize his full Japanese name: Takashi Kashiwabara. But later, as a fan, I also forgot about him. Maybe it's because I never saw his work, or maybe I vaguely learned that he was in trouble with competing with the big guy for women.\n\n——— the first male star who is beautiful but not feminine——\n\nWhen searching for Kashiwara Takashi on the Internet, he suddenly jumped out of the label of \"the first male star who is beautiful but not feminine\". Then I thought that he really needed a label to be mentioned, and in fact, this label was quite accurate.\n\nWhen I was a little girl, I loved Shunji Iwai's movie \"Love Letters\". Some people, like me, may remember the classic picture of a teenager leaning against a white curtain and flipping through a book, licking the screen in the name of literature and art.\n\nI admit that my favorite is the idol drama \"A Kiss and a Promise\". Kashiwara Takashi was 19 years old at the time, and the role in the play was an IQ200 genius teenager, cold and poisonous to the heroine, but you just couldn't hate him, and it was the originator of the later \"overbearing president\".\n\nFrom this period to the next 10 years, it was the peak of Kashiwara's appearance.\n\nBefore that, he came to China to participate in a variety show \"The Times Show\". The name of the show hurts. Ye Xuan, who participated in the show together, posted a photo on Weibo, and everyone was shocked: How did Naoki Irie become (old) like this?\n\nTakashi Kashiwara was born on March 16, 1977, the same age as Huang Xiaoming. But Master Huang still looked very young. Kashiwara Takashi did not get fat, did not have a bald head, but he was really too thin, and the myth of \"youth super long standby\" did not happen to him. However, with his reputation and status at that time, if it were not for that kind of personality, he would not have said that if he was not red, he would not be red, right?\n\nWell, he's not a male classmate without a story.\n\n——— no idol baggage first place -\n\nNO.1 *【Rush to get rid of the vase image】*\n\nKashiwara Takashi, who has grown up to be good-looking, has also become popular very smoothly. In \"A Kiss and a Promise\", the heroine Sato Basket, played by The heroine Aihara Kotoko, is a \"national beautiful girl\", but the male protagonist's face is more delicate than hers.\n\nBut Kashiwara Takashi has always been reluctant for others to pay too much attention to his looks, and he does not want to be bound by this face. Therefore, I don't care much about the image, and I don't have any idol baggage. Even sometimes self-destructive images are not self-aware.\n\nLooking at Kashiwara's photo album, it is basically a living photo of beard pulling, plain face, grimace, and exposing two points (but there are no eight-pack abs). It makes it embarrassing for the girl who wants to lick the screen.\n\nMany years ago, the young Masaharu Fukuyama gave a friend-like interview to the younger Kashiwara Takashi. They make curry rice on a fire in the mountains and forests, chat while cutting vegetables, and laugh for half a day with a little thing. When Fukuyama was cooking, Kashiwara was secretly smoking, knowing that the camera was shooting him and not caring, with a carefree look. Fukuyama said he was the kind of \"useless boy,\" presumably referring to the fact that he grew up in a privileged family environment, did not suffer hardships, did not bear the pressure, and did not have clear goals and ambitions.\n\nNO.2 *【Group rock band, pick up the scene and deviate】*\n\nHe's not like an entertainer, but more like an artist.\n\nIn fact, he really did something like an artist. At the height of his popularity in 1998, he and his younger brother Kashiwara formed a rock band No where, and as the lead singer, released an album \"Another World\". They take the Oasis-style British rock route, and the songs in it are basically written by two brothers, which is not bad. Kashiwara Takashi composes music, his younger brother composes lyrics, and is talented. By the way, my brother is now more popular in Japan than others.\n\nAt the same time, he was tired of playing the same role all the time. Takashi Kashiwara once wrote: \"I am not always so young, and I am getting older. It's not okay to always play these vase roles, and you can't survive as an actor. Then he began to challenge himself, picking up some literary films. For example, in 1998, he starred in the movie \"The Edge of Heart Horror\" with Nanami Suzuki, and challenged the role of the six-fold personality for the first time. Takashi Kashiwara also won the Newcomer Award in the film industry.\n\nThe scale of his acting is great. He also starred in the movie \"Another Heaven's Blood Soul\" as a killer... One of the bizarre plots that use the human brain for cooking. The most exciting thing is that in the film, Kashiwara Takayoshi kisses Yosuke Eguchi!\n\nOf course, he later played some marginal roles in literary and artistic films or played soy sauce in TV dramas, which was not his own choice, but there were no other opportunities. This will be discussed later.\n\n———I'm the dividing line with gossip in front of me—\n\nKashiwara's emotional experience is quite bumpy, and one of the relationships even completely changed his life, which makes people sigh.\n\n☞ [First Love Woman Friend - Miki Kanno]\n\nHis first girlfriend was Miho Sugano, who was said to have liked her very much at the time. Miho was born in the same year as Chong, and debuted at the same time, people are beautiful, and they also have aura in performance. Later, in 2003, the TV series \"Daio\" (Meiji chapter) made her a big hit.\n\nBut even more notable is her all-male lineup of ex-boyfriends: Takashi Kashiwara, Goro Inagaki, Yoshitoshi Okada, Hiroshi Tamaki (gossip), and finally married Masato Sakai and had children. Netizens envy and jealousy: Is this the real winner in life?!\n\n☞ 【Marriage and divorce - robbed the mistress of the big guy】\n\nThis experience is worth elaborating on.\n\nIn January 2000, Takashi Kashiwara and model Hiroko Hatano met and fell in love through the filming of the TV series Eros Mischief. Hatano is 2 years older than him and is the mistress of the \"black boss of the entertainment industry\", this big guy is Motoichi Taniguchi, a high-level executive of the \"Kdash\" company, and there is a lot of power behind him.\n\nThis notorious Taniguchi is lustful and cruel, and all the female artists he fancy must try their best to take it for themselves, and those who do not obey do not want to mix in the art world. Previously, a female host, Yako Kawada, committed suicide by burning charcoal in the car because of his coercive threats. Before dying, she left a suicide note, because the content was too dark, and the family did not choose to make it public.\n\nIn recent years, Motoichi Taniguchi's accumulated evil deeds have been gradually exposed. In December 2013, Yumi Yoshimatsu, Japan's first Miss International winner, accused him of sexual harassment. The wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Akie Abe, personally came forward, and the truth of the incident surfaced. But many journalists in the Japanese media privately said that Mrs. Abe did not know the forces behind him to stand up bravely. As a media, they dare not report.\n\nKashiwara continued to associate with Hiroko despite the opposition around him. In December, Kashiwara had to temporarily interrupt filming due to neck, shoulder and wrist disease and migraines (it is said that this was a warning to him by the producers at Taniguchi's behest). During his recuperation, Hiroko Hatano has been with Takashi Kashiwara to accompany him to rehabilitation, and he is deeply moved. In June 2004, Takashi Kashiwara and Hiroko married. This incident completely angered Taniguchi, and since then, Kashiwara Takashi's acting career has faced a greater crisis.\n\nSoon after his marriage, there was a sensational \"beating incident\", which seriously damaged his image. According to media reports at the time, Kashiwara Takashi and Hiroko drove through Nozawa, Setagaya District, and on the way encountered a white-collar middle-aged man washing a car on the road, Chong went forward to persuade the man not to wash the car in the middle of the road, which has hindered traffic, but the man retorted: \"Other people's cars can drive past you can't drive!\" Kashiwara Takashi was momentarily angry and gave the man a punch in the forehead.\n\nAt that time, Hiroko was in the car, and fans were also critical of her failure to take any measures at that time. Afterwards, Kashiwara Takashi personally went to the victim's home to apologize and expressed his willingness to bear the medical expenses of the injured. He also held a special press conference, and at the press conference, he bowed at 90 degrees to apologize, saying: \"Although I was impulsive at that time, it was like splashing water, and the moment I shot it was impossible to turn back.\" ”\n\nAt the same time, he was touched to say that since he began to be investigated, the most troublesome thing was his wife, Hiroko, but Hiroko is a very gentle and mature woman, and she and her husband are working together for this matter. Chonggen felt extremely remorseful about this incident, and once stopped all work and quietly reflected at home. At that time, there were reports in Japan that the matter was not so simple, but that Taniguchi's men deliberately provoked Kashiwara Takashi to cause a dispute.\n\nThe negative impact of this incident on Kashiwara Washihara was extremely great. Originally planned to be co-starring with Naoto Fujiki, the decision to change the role of the TV series \"Fate\" was made. After that, Kashiwara Takashi basically belonged to the state of being hidden in the snow, and the opportunity to appear was getting less and less. According to fan reports, there are influential people in the show business who can't see it, who want to act as an intermediary to mediate this contradiction, but they have not succeeded. Subsequently, Kashiwara changed the brokerage company, but this move did not bring a bright future to the work.\n\nAt the same time, the relationship between Takashi Kashiwara and Hiroko Hatano also cracked. The two separated in September 2005 and divorced in February 2006.\n\nAnd Taniguchi Motoichi after their divorce, even Hiroko has remarried and had two children, and there is no revenge enough. In the years after the divorce, Kashiwara Takashi has been in a passive working state. It is said that he is paid more than 500,000 yen per month, and only does the work ordered by the above, and arranges his spare time completely by himself. The TV series is either a supporting role or a cameo. Most of the films are co-productions, either playing soy sauce or niche literary/marginal characters.\n\nNight is a 2006 Chinese film directed by Liang Baijian and starring Takashi Kashiwara and Guo Pinchao.\n\n☞ 【New Beginning】\n\nIn May 2010, Kashiwara's relationship with actor Yuki Uchida was exposed. The two worked together on commercials in 1995 and the TV series Giant Wings in 2001, but have not worked together since. It was not until we met again in 2009 that we had more opportunities to meet each other because of the same friends, and we officially began to interact at the end of the year.\n\nIn the drama of Kashiwara and Uchida, there is a cute wedding scene, especially the last one.\n\nYuki Uchida and Takashi Kashiwara met at the age of 18 and only fell in love after 15 years. It is said that after so many years of talking, the resistance to their marriage mainly came from Uchida's brokerage company. Burning Production, Uchida's office, is the most powerful art firm in Japan. This can't help but worry, as if yesterday reappeared?\n\nAs for the pair of high-value CP who are looking forward to having a beautiful baby soon, Kashiwara Takashi said that he has no interest in having children. Yuki Uchida also said that it is unlikely to have children when you are older. Fans only have blessings: Kashiwara Takashi's first two loves are too hurtful, and I hope that this period can have good results.\n\nThe relationship is stable, and the career has also improved. On his 38th birthday last year, Kashiwara revealed that he had recently not only worked as an actor, but also began to try to write plays and produce plays. Perhaps with these life setbacks, or perhaps he has been trying to improve his performance, Kashiwara Takashi has made great progress in acting.\n\nIn recent years, in the movies \"Unsinkable Sun\", \"Leonie\" and the TV series \"New Mature Girl Era\" and \"CONTROL Criminal Psychological Search\", his performances are delicate and introverted, and he has a sense of existence.\n\nKashiwara Takashi also opened a Weibo, sending New Year's greetings to fans during the New Year, and also po po some landscape photos he took. He was also very helpful in introducing his favorite delicious things and wishing everyone a good dream. Seems to live peacefully.\n\nHis story is basically like that. But I wanted to say a few more words. Many people like the beautiful appearance of his youth, which is also a kind of nostalgia for his youth. Then sighed his present downfall and edge. Indeed, he did not provide a model for a successful life for everyone. It is not a movie emperor, a rich man, a winner in life, nor an \"invisible rich man\" or \"invisible life winner\". Some people will even say, you see, he broke a good hand of cards!\n\nBut I don't know why, but I think it's more interesting. For ordinary people, he is not a model worth emulating, but he is the true freedom we yearn for in our hearts, bravely turning into an idol of real life.\n\nHe has wrinkles in the corners of his eyes, and like most 39-year-olds, he has also gone from youthful madness to maturity and peace. Persistence is much more difficult than giving up. But he persevered. Be a normal person. Live a life without PS. Challenge unreasonable rules. He may have lost, but he lost beautifully.\n\n#Kashiwara Takashi ##高颜值小哥哥 #"
