        "text": "Actress Yuki Uchida (34) and actor Takashi Kashiwabara (33) are reported to be in a serious relationship, since around the end of last year.\n\nUchida and Kashiwabara first met about 15 years ago when they appeared together as a young couple in a series of commercials. They again worked together in 2001 on the drama series \"Big Wing.\" However, there was no romance between them at the time. Uchida married actor Hidetaka Yoshioka (39) in 2002 but divorced three years later. Meanwhile, Kashiwabara tied the knot with actress Hiroko Hatano (34) in 2004, and that marriage lasted two years.\n\nThe pair had not worked together since \"Big Wing,\" but they met again last year through their friends, and their relationship progressed from there. Sources say that they have no intention of a hasty wedding.\n\nCredits: Tokyograph\n\nWow. That's so uncalled for. But I approve~ Thoughts?
