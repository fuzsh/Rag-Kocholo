Perhaps next season. :)\n\ndo you love? | 4 loves | Share | Flag | Link\n\nDouble hitter of Kassy and Nagase and i've not yet watched it. How crazy is that?!\n\nAnd Kassy COULD be in next season... I mean, not all the dramas are completely casted so we can only live in hope. VERY little hope but it will happen soon enough!\n\nReply | Thread | Link\n\nI'm watching it RIGHT NOW and my exams are in two days. D: But with Hakusen Nagashi, I promised myself that I wanted to watch it before I graduate... so at least I could relate it. Something I need done before I get out of high school. I really like it so far.\n\nI suppose another miracle COULD happen. Like how Okada's SP was decided last minute.\n\nReply | Parent | Thread | Link\n\nThanks for the link. I am definitely going to be checking out this show. =3\n\nReply | Thread | Link\n\ntoo bad the specials aren't subbed :-(\n\nReply | Thread | Link"
