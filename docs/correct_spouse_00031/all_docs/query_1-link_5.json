In former part of the paper, the features of house damage at 2007 Mid-Niigata prefecture offshore earthquake were analyzed for various influencing factors. The authors discussed the affrecting factors to houses at earthquake. In latter part, the features of house damage at 2007 Mid-Niigata prefecture offshore earthquake was discussed with that at 2004 Mid-Niigata prefecture earthquake. The house damage function of distance from the epicenter was proposed based on the analysis on house damage ratio recorded in two earthquakes.\n\n[Clinical aspects of the Niigata Minamata disease].\n\nPubMed\n\nShimohata, Takayoshi; Hirota, Koichi; Takahashi, Hitoshi; Nishizawa, Masatoyo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Minamata disease was discovered in the Minamata region, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, in 1956. Symptoms of this disease included cerebellar ataxia, sensory disturbance, narrowing of the visual field, and hearing and speech disturbances. In 1965, similar conditions were identified in persons living around the Agano River area, Niigata Prefecture, Japan and accordingly termed as the Niigata Minamata disease or the second Minamata disease. Both the diseases have been attributed to poisoning with methyl mercury that was generated during the production of acetaldehyde using mercury as a catalyst. The discharged methyl mercury accumulated in fishes and shellfishes and caused poisoning on consumption. This review discusses the history, clinical presentation including atypical forms, and autopsy findings of the Niigata Minamata disease. In addition, it highlights the problems about criteria for official recognition and the therapeutic trial for this disease.\n\nLocation of early aftershocks of the 2004 Mid-Niigata Prefecture Earthquake (M = 6.8) in central Japan using seismogram envelopes as templates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKosuga, M.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe location of early aftershocks is very important to obtain information of mainshock fault, however, it is often difficult due to the long-lasting coda wave of mainshock and successive occurrence of afterrshocks. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a method of location using seismogram envelopes as templates, and applied the method to the early aftershock sequence of the 2004 Mid-Niigata Prefecture (Chuetsu) Earthquake (M = 6.8) in central Japan. The location method composes of three processes. The first process is the calculation of cross-correlation coefficients between a continuous (target) and template envelopes. We prepare envelopes by taking the logarithm of root-mean-squared amplitude of band-pass filtered seismograms. We perform the calculation by shifting the time window to obtain a set of cross-correlation values for each template. The second process is the event detection (selection of template) and magnitude estimate. We search for the events in descending order of cross-correlation in a time window excluding the dead times around the previously detected events. Magnitude is calculated by the amplitude ratio of target and template envelopes. The third process is the relative event location to the selected template. We applied this method to the Chuetsu earthquake, a large inland earthquake with extensive aftershock activity. The number of detected events depends on the number of templates, frequency range, and the threshold value of cross-correlation. We set the threshold as 0.5 by referring to the histogram of cross-correlation. During a period of one-hour from the mainshock, we could detect more events than the JMA catalog. The location of events is generally near the catalog location. Though we should improve the methods of relative location and magnitude estimate, we conclude that the proposed method works adequately even just after the mainshock of large inland earthquake.

Peak horizontal ground accelerations of 0.68 g were measured in Kashiwazaki City, as well as at the reactor floor level of the world's largest nuclear reactor, located on the coast at Kariwa Village. Liquefaction of historic and modern river deposits, aeolian dune sand, and manmade fill was widespread in the coastal region nearest the epicenter and caused ground deformations that damaged bridges, embankments, roadways, buildings, ports, railways and utilities. Landslides along the coast of southern Niigata Prefecture and in mountainous regions inland of Kashiwazaki were also widespread affecting transportation infrastructure. Liquefaction and a landslide also damaged the nuclear power plant sites. This paper, along with a companion digital map database available at http://walrus.wr.usgs.gOv/infobank/n/nii07jp/html/n-ii-07-jp.sites.kmz, describes the seismological and geo-engineering aspects of the event. ?? 2009, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute.\n\nAssessment of landslide distribution map reliability in Niigata prefecture - Japan using frequency ratio approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRahardianto, Trias; Saputra, Aditya; Gomez, Christopher\n\n2017-07-01\n\nResearch on landslide susceptibility has evolved rapidly over the few last decades thanks to the availability of large databases. Landslide research used to be focused on discreet events but the usage of large inventory dataset has become a central pillar of landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk assessment. Indeed, extracting meaningful information from the large database is now at the forth of geoscientific research, following the big-data research trend. Indeed, the more comprehensive information of the past landslide available in a particular area is, the better the produced map will be, in order to support the effective decision making, planning, and engineering practice. The landslide inventory data which is freely accessible online gives an opportunity for many researchers and decision makers to prevent casualties and economic loss caused by future landslides. This data is advantageous especially for areas with poor landslide historical data. Since the construction criteria of landslide inventory map and its quality evaluation remain poorly defined, the assessment of open source landslide inventory map reliability is required. The present contribution aims to assess the reliability of open-source landslide inventory data based on the particular topographical setting of the observed area in Niigata prefecture, Japan. Geographic Information System (GIS) platform and statistical approach are applied to analyze the data. Frequency ratio method is utilized to model and assess the landslide map. The outcomes of the generated model showed unsatisfactory results with AUC value of 0.603 indicate the low prediction accuracy and unreliability of the model.\n\nInvestigation of the M6.6 Niigata-Chuetsu Oki, Japan, earthquake of July 16, 2007\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nKayen, Robert; Collins, Brian D.; Abrahamson, Norm; Ashford, Scott; Brandenberg, Scott J.; Cluff, Lloyd; Dickenson, Stephen; Johnson, Laurie; Tanaka, Yasuo; Tokimatsu, Kohji; Kabeyasawa, Toshimi; Kawamata, Yohsuke; Koumoto, Hidetaka; Marubashi, Nanako; Pujol, Santiago; Steele, Clint; Sun, Joseph I.; Tsai, Ben; Yanev, Peter; Yashinsky, Mark; Yousok, Kim\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe M6.6 mainshock of the Niigata Chuetsu Oki (offshore) earthquake occurred at 10:13 a.m. local time on July 16, 2007, and was followed by a sequence of aftershocks that were felt during the entire time of the reconnaissance effort. The mainshock had an estimated focal depth of 10 km and struck in the Japan Sea offshore Kariwa. Analysis of waveforms from source inversion studies indicates that the event occurred along a thrust fault with a NE trend. The fault plane is either a strike of 34 degrees with a dip of 51 degrees or a strike of 238 degrees with a dip of 41 degrees. Which of these two planes is associated with the mainshock rupture is unresolved, although attenuation relationship analysis indicates that the northwest-dipping fault is favored. The quake affected an approximately 100-km-wide area along the coastal areas of southwestern Niigata prefecture. The event triggered ground failures as far as the Unouma Hills, located in central Niigata approximately 50 km from the shore and the source area of the 2004 Niigata Chuetsu earthquake. The primary event produced tsunami run-ups that reached maximum runup heights of about 20 centimeters along the shoreline of southern Niigata Prrefecture.\n\n[Pathological and biochemical studies of 30 Niigata autopsy cases related to Minamata disease].\n\nPubMed\n\nEto, Komyo; Takahashi, Hitoshi; Kakita, Akiyoshi; Tokunaga, Hidehiro; Yasutake, Akira; Nakano, Atsuhiro; Sawada, Masumi; Kinjo, Yoshihide\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTo reevaluate pathologically and biochemically 30 autopsy cases related to Minamata disease (MD) in Niigata Prefecture (NP) and compare the findings with those of autopsy cases related to MD in Kumamoto Prefecture (KP). Recently, a set of pathological materials of these 30 autopsy cases has been sent from the Brain Research Institute at the University of Niigata to the National Institute for Minamata Disease (NIMD). The materials from each autopsy case were reexamined at the NIMD. There were no postnatal and fetal cases of MD in the NP autopsy materials. The contents of total mercury (T-Hg), methylmercury (Me-Hg), inorganic mercury (I-Hg) and selenium were measured in the organs of cerebrum, cerebellum, liver and kidney. The contents of T-Hg, Me-Hg and I-Hg were much higher in two cases than in controls. The pathological findings leading to the diagnosis of MD in the NP cases were essentially the same as those in KP, including the peripheral nerve lesions. In the most severely affected case of MD in NP, formation of multiple vacuoles of various sizes was observed in the cerebellar cortex, which was never encountered in the KP cases. The KP lesions were similar to that observed in an acute case of Me-Hg-treated common marmoset studied in the NIMD. The pathological features were essentially the same between the adult cases of MD in NP and KP.\n\nANALYSIS OF LABOUR ACCIDENTS OCCURRING IN DISASTER RESTORATION WORK FOLLOWING THE NIIGATA CHUETSU EARTHQUAKE (2004) AND THE NIIGATA CHUETSU-OKI EARTHQUAKE (2007)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nItoh, Kazuya; Noda, Masashi; Kikkawa, Naotaka; Hori, Tomohito; Tamate, Satoshi; Toyosawa, Yasuo; Suemasa, Naoaki\n\nLabour accidents in disaster-relief and disaster restoration work following the Niigata Chuetsu Earthquake (2004) and the Niigata Chuetsu-oki Earthquake (2007) were analysed and characterised in order to raise awareness of the risks and hazards in such work. The Niigata Chuetsu-oki Earthquake affected houses and buildings rather than roads and railways, which are generally disrupted due to landslides or slope failures caused by earthquakes. In this scenario, the predominant type of accident is a \"fall to lower level,\" which increases mainly due to the fact that labourers are working to repair houses and buildings. On the other hand, landslides and slope failures were much more prevalent in the Niigata Chuetsu Earthquake, resulting in more accidents occurring in geotechnical works rather than in construction works. Therefore, care should be taken in preventing \"fall to lower level\" accidents associated with repair work on the roofs of low-rise houses, \"cut or abrasion\" accidents due to the demolition of damaged houses and \"caught in or compressed by equipment\" accidents in road works and water and sewage works.\n\nPsychological recovery 5 years after the 2004 Niigata-Chuetsu earthquake in Yamakoshi, Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakamura, Kazutoshi; Kitamura, Kaori; Someya, Toshiyuki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe 2004 Niigata-Chuetsu earthquake of Japan caused considerable damage. We assessed long-term changes in psychological distress among earthquake victims during the period 5 years after the earthquake. The participants were people aged 18 years or older living in Yamakoshi, a community in Niigata Prefecture near the epicenter. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted annually for 5 consecutive years after the earthquake. Response rates were 1316/1841 (71.5%) in 2005, 667/1381 (48.3%) in 2006, 753/1451 (51.9%) in 2007, 541/1243 (43.5%) in 2008, and 814/1158 (70.3%) in 2009. The questionnaire asked about demographic characteristics, including sex, age, employment status, social network, and psychological status. Psychological distress was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire and was defined as a total score of 4 or higher. The overall prevalence of psychological distress decreased (P < 0.0001) gradually from 2005 (51.0%) to 2008 (30.1%) but tended to increase from 2008 to 2009 (P = 0.1590). Subgroup analyses showed that prevalence did not decrease over the 5-year study period among participants with poor social contact (P = 0.0659). From 2008 to 2009 prevalence increased in women (+7.5%, P = 0.0403) and participants aged 65 years or older (+7.2%, P = 0.0400). The prevalence of psychological distress in Yamakoshi people decreased steadily during the 4 years immediately after the earthquake but appeared to increase thereafter. The earthquake victims are still reestablishing their lives. Thus, continued attention should be focused on maintaining and further assessing their mental health.\n\nPsychological Recovery 5 Years After the 2004 Niigata-Chuetsu Earthquake in Yamakoshi, Japan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNakamura, Kazutoshi; Kitamura, Kaori; Someya, Toshiyuki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground The 2004 Niigata-Chuetsu earthquake of Japan caused considerable damage.

L. N.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe examine the development of large, long-period ground motions at near-regional distances (D=50-200 km) generated by the PL wave from large, shallow inland earthquakes, based on the analysis of strong motion records and finite-difference method (FDM) simulations of seismic wave propagation. PL wave can be represented as leaking modes of the crustal waveguide and are commonly observed at regional distances between 300 to 1000 km as a dispersed, long-period signal with a dominant period of about 20 s. However, observations of recent earthquakes at the dense K-NET and KiK-net strong motion networks in Japan demonstrate the dominance of the PL wave at near-regional (D=50-200 km) distances as, e.g., for the 2004 Mid Niigata, Japan, earthquake (Mw6.6; h=13 km). The observed PL wave signal between P and S wave shows a large, dispersed wave packet with dominant period of about T=4-10 s with amplitude almost comparable to or larger than the later arrival of the S and surface waves. Thus, the early arrivals of the long-period PL wave immediately after P wave can enhance resonance with large-scale constructions such as high-rise buildings and large oil-storage tanks etc. with potential for disaster. Such strong effects often occurred during the 2004 Mid Niigata earthquakes and other large earthquakes which occurred nearby the Kanto (Tokyo) basin. FDM simulation of seismic wave propagation employing realistic 3-D sedimentary structure models demonstrates the process by which the PL wave develops at near-regional distances from shallow, crustal earthquakes by constructive interference of the P wave in the long-period band. The amplitude of the PL wave is very sensitive to low-velocity structure in the near-surface. Lowered velocities help to develop large SV-to-P conversion and weaken the P-to-SV conversion at the free surface. Both effects enhance the multiple P reflections in the crustal waveguide and prevent the leakage of seismic energy into the mantle. However, a very\n\nThe pathology of methylmercury poisoning (Minamata disease): The 50th Anniversary of Japanese Society of Neuropathology.\n\nPubMed\n\nEto, Komyo; Marumoto, Masumi; Takeya, Motohiro\n\n2010-10-01\n\nMethylmercury (Me-Hg) poisoning (Minamata disease: MD) is one of the most severe types of disease caused by humans to humans in Japan. The disease is a special class of food-borne methylmercury intoxication in humans as typified by the outbreak that began in 1953 in Minamata and its vicinity in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. There are 450 autopsy cases in Kumamoto and 30 autopsy cases in Niigata Prefecture related to MD in Japan. Two hundred and one cases in Kumamoto and 22 cases in Niigata showed pathological changes of MD. This report provides a brief research history and overview of the pathological changes of MD, and also presents representative cases of adult, infantile and fetal forms of MD among the 450 MD-related autopsy cases in Kumamoto Prefecture. Â© 2010 Japanese Society of Neuropathology.\n\nSymposium Summary and the Scope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKajino, Toshitaka\n\nIt was a great pleasure for us to organize the 14th International Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos (NIC-XIV) in Niigata Japan, which shall illuminate the new horizon of nuclear astrophysics and related fields. This was co-hosted by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and RIKEN Nishina Center, supported by IUPAP, JINA-CEE, JSPS, JEC Fund, Niigata Prefecture and Niigata City, and many other institutes and associations, and also sponsored by PTEP, Bourbone, and many other companies.

Large-scale poisonings caused by methyl mercury (MeHg) have occurred in Japan (Minamata in the 1950s and Niigata in the 1960s) and Iraq (in the 1970s). The current WHO neurological risk standard for adult exposure (hair level: 50âÎ¼g/g) was based partly on evidence from Niigata which did not consider any cases who were diagnosed later and/or exposed to low level of MeHg (hair mercury level less than 50âÎ¼g/g). Methods. Early in the Niigata epidemic in June 1965 there were two extensive surveys. From these two surveys, we examined 103 adults with hair mercury measurement who consulted two medical institutions. We compared the prevalence and the distribution of neurological signs related to MeHg poisoning between exposure categories. Result. We found 48 subjects with neurological signs related to MeHg poisoning who had hair mercury concentration less than 50âÎ¼g/g. Among the neurological signs, sensory disturbance of the bilateral distal extremities was observed more frequently, followed by disequilibrium, hearing impairment, and ataxia, in groups with hair MeHg concentration both below 50âÎ¼g/g and over 50âÎ¼g/g. Conclusion. The present study suggests the possibility that exposure to MeHg at levels below the current WHO limits could cause neurologic signs, in particular, sensory disturbance.

The reverse fault system in the Niigata area may indicate present reactivation of an ancient rift structure formed in the Miocene, at the opening of the Sea of Japan (Sato, 1994). To have a detailed understanding of seismotectonics in the Niigata area, we have installed a dense temporary network of 300 seismic stations. Enescu et al. (2011) presented preliminary tomography results, using earthquake data recorded during intense observations. The present study uses an improved dataset and refined data processing to reveal the detailed velocity structure and accurate earthquake locations. The data consists of 1805 events that have 151,780 P-picks and 169,696 S-picks, recorded at 434 temporary and permanent seismic stations. We first use a JHD algorithm (Kissling et al., 1994) to determine an optimum 1D velocity structure and more accurate hypocenters (both used later as input for the tomography inversion). As a result of relocation, the hypocenters in the on-shore Niigata basin region are shifted upwards by ~3 km, while the off-shore events become shallower by as much as 10 km, in agreement with results obtained in previous studies (e.g., Kato et al., 2009). We next use the \"tomoDD\" software (Zhang and Thurber, 2003) to invert for the 3D velocity structure and relocate simultaneously the hypocenters. The horizontal and vertical grid spacing were of 5 ~ 10 km and 2 ~ 4 km, respectively. The obtained velocity model shows a wide and relatively low velocity (< 5.5 km/s for the P-wave velocity and < 3 km/s for the S-wave velocity) band extending in a NE-SW direction, which widens and narrows along its extent. The thickness of the low-velocity region varies from place to place and exceeds 8 km in some parts. We have constructed iso-velocity maps to better visualize the shape and depth extent of the low-velocity region.

A total of 151 patients (61 men and 90 women; mean age 72.1 years) with Niigata Minamata disease were enrolled. An age- and sex-matched group of 150 participants was used as control. Patients reported their International Prostate Symptom Score and overactive bladder symptom score. In men, the total, storage and voiding International Prostate Symptom Score scores were higher in the Niigata Minamata disease group than in the control group (10.6âÂ±â7.8 vs 5.0âÂ±â5.0, 4.5âÂ±â3.3 vs 2.4âÂ±â2.4 and 6.1âÂ±â5.1 vs 2.7âÂ±â3.1, respectively, Pâ<â0.001 in all). In women, these scores were also higher in the Niigata Minamata disease group than in the control group (8.9âÂ±â7.3 vs 4.0âÂ±â4.0, 4.4âÂ±â3.2 vs 2.8âÂ±â2.4 and 4.5âÂ±â5.0 vs 1.3âÂ±â2.0, respectively, Pâ<â0.001 in all). The prevalence of overactive bladder was more frequent in the Niigata Minamata disease group compared with that in the control group (51.7% vs 26.7%, Pâ<â0.001). In both men and women, the overactive bladder symptom score was higher in the Niigata Minamata disease group than in the control group (4.1âÂ±â3.0 vs 2.4âÂ±â2.9, Pâ=â0.002 and 4.6âÂ±â3.6 vs 2.7âÂ±â2.9, Pâ<â0.001, respectively). The International Prostate Symptom Score and overactive bladder symptom score in the Niigata Minamata disease group were highest in patients aged 60-69 years (Pâ<â0.001 in both), whereas these increased in an age-dependent manner in the control group. Lower urinary tract symptoms and overactive bladder are severe and highly prevalent conditions among patients with methyl mercury poisoning. The higher prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms among patients aged 60-69 years might be related to the fact that they were exposed to methyl mercury during their childhood/development. Â© 2012 The Japanese\n\nRecent damaging earthquakes in Japan, 2003-2008\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nKayen, Robert E\n\n2008-01-01\n\nDuring the last six years, from 2003-2008, Japan has been struck by three significant and damaging earthquakes: The most recent M6.6 Niigata Chuetsu Oki earthquake of July 16, 2007 off the coast of Kashiwazaki City, Japan; The M6.6 Niigata Chuetsu earthquake of October 23, 2004, located in Niigata Prefecture in the central Uonuma Hills; and the M8.0 Tokachi Oki Earthquake of September 26, 2003 effecting southeastern Hokkaido Prefecture. These earthquakes stand out among many in a very active period of seismicity in Japan. Within the upper 100 km of the crust during this period, Japan experienced 472 earthquakes of magnitude 6, or greater. Both Niigata events affected the south-central region of Tohoku Japan, and the Tokachi-Oki earthquake affected a broad region of the continental shelf and slope southeast of the Island of Hokkaido. This report is synthesized from the work of scores of Japanese and US researchers who led and participated in post-earthquake reconnaissance of these earthquakes: their noteworthy and valuable contributions are listed in an extended acknowledgements section at the end of the paper. During the Niigata Chuetsu Oki event of 2007, damage to the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, structures, infrastructure, and ground were primarily the product of two factors: (1) high intensity motions from this moderate-sized shallow event, and (2) soft, poor performing, or liquefiable soils in the coastal region of southwestern Niigata Prefecture. Structural and geotechnical damage along the slopes of dunes was ubiquitous in the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa region. The 2004 Niigata Chuetsu Earthquake was the most significant to affect Japan since the 1995 Kobe earthquake. Forty people were killed, almost 3,000 were injured, and many hundreds of landslides destroyed entire upland villages. Landslides were of all types; some dammed streams, temporarily creating lakes threatening to overtop their new embankments and cause flash floods and mudslides.

Radionuclides were deposited on the ground not only in Fukushima prefecture but also in nearby prefectures. Since the accident, measurement of radiation in environment such as air dose rate and deposition density of radionuclides has been performed by many organizations and universities. In particular, Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has been performing observations of air dose rate using a car-borne survey system continuously and over wide areas. In our study, using the data measured by JAEA, we estimated effective dose from external exposure in the six prefectures adjacent to Fukushima prefecture. Since car-borne survey was started a few months later after the accident, measured air dose rate in this method is mainly contributed by 137Cs and 134Cs whose half-lives are relatively long. Therefore, based on air dose rate of 137Cs and 134Cs and the ratio of deposition density of short-half-life nuclides to that of 137Cs and 134Cs, we also estimated effective dose contributed from not only 137Cs and 134Cs but also other short-half-life nuclides. We compared the effective dose estimated by the method above with that of UNSCEAR and measured data using personal dosimeters in some areas.\n\nAssociation of Ocean Energy Exploitation of Resources Promotion Sea of Japan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAoyama, C.; Aoyama, S.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nNine prefectures of 1 local government prefecture of the Sea of Japan side established \"Association of Ocean Energy Exploitation of Resources Promotion Sea of Japan\" (the following, Association of Sea of Japan) in September, 2012. They support methane hydrate exploitation of resources of the government and aim at the local activation and job creation. Niigata and Hyogo that were members of the association of Sea of Japan carried out a prefecture original methane hydrate investigation. They appeal to the government for development promotion of the government by showing the result. On the other hand, Wakayama located on the Pacific side wants to appeal to the government for the reexamination of the development sea area by showing that outer layer type methane hydrate exists to the sea area that is nearer the landside than the sea area that the government develops. The Independent Institute carried out collaborative investigation each with Niigata, Hyogo and Wakayama in 2013. I show the results of research. In the joint investigation with Niigata, plural plumesãwere observed in Mogami trough east slope (from depth of the water 200m 600m) . In the joint investigation with Hyogo, I carried out observation of a methane plume and the structure and the seafloor topography under the sea bottom in Oki east sea area. Furthermore, I performed a piston core ring and gathered five samples and confirmed plural traces of the methane hydrate. In the joint investigation with Wakayama, plural plumes were observed in Shionomisaki canyon (from depth of the water 1,700m 2,200m). There is hardly the report of the plume on the Pacific side so far. Therefore I want to continue observing it in future.\n\nSource Process of the 2007 Niigata-ken Chuetsu-oki Earthquake Derived from Near-fault Strong Motion Data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAoi, S.; Sekiguchi, H.; Morikawa, N.; Ozawa, T.; Kunugi, T.; Shirasaka, M.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nThe 2007 Niigata-ken Chuetsu-oki earthquake occurred on July 16th, 2007, 10:13 JST. We performed a multi- time window linear waveform inversion analysis (Hartzell and Heaton, 1983) to estimate the rupture process from the near fault strong motion data of 14 stations from K-NET, KiK-net, F-net, JMA, and Niigata prefecture. The fault plane for the mainshock has not been clearly determined yet from the aftershock distribution, so that we performed two waveform inversions for north-west dipping fault (Model A) and south-east dipping fault (Model B). Their strike, dip, and rake are set to those of the moment tensor solutions by F-net. Fault plane model of 30 km length by 24 km width is set to cover aftershock distribution within 24 hours after the mainshock. Theoretical Green's functions were calculated by the discrete wavenumber method (Bouchon, 1981) and the R/T matrix method (Kennett, 1983) with the different stratified medium for each station based on the velocity structure including the information form the reflection survey and borehole logging data. Convolution of moving dislocation was introduced to represent the rupture propagation in an each subfault (Sekiguchi et al., 2002). The observed acceleration records were integrated into velocity except of F-net velocity data, and bandpass filtered between 0.1 and 1.0 Hz. We solved least-squared equation to obtain slip amount of each time window on each subfault to minimize squared residual of the waveform fitting between observed and synthetic waveforms. Both models provide moment magnitudes of 6.7. Regarding Model A, we obtained large slip in the south-west deeper part of the rupture starting point, which is close to Kashiwazaki-city. The second or third velocity pulses of observed velocity waveforms seem to be composed of slip from the asperity. Regarding Model B, we obtained large slip in the southwest shallower part of the rupture starting point, which is also close to Kashiwazaki-city. In both models, we found\n\nLIDAR Investigation Of The 2004 Niigata Ken Chuetsu, Japan, Earthquake\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKayen, R.; Pack, R. T.; Sugimoto, S.; Tanaka, H.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThe 23 October 2004 Niigata Ken Chuetsu, Japan, Mw 6.6 earthquake was the most significant earthquake to affect Japan since the 1995 Kobe earthquake. Forty people were killed, almost 3,000 injured, and numerous landslides destroyed entire upland villages. Landslides and permanent ground deformation caused extensive damage to roads, rail lines and other lifelines, resulting in major economic disruption. The cities and towns most significantly affected by the earthquake were Nagaoka, Ojiya, and the mountainous rural areas of Yamakoshi village and Kawaguchi town. Our EERI team traveled with a tripod mounted LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) unit, a scanning-laser that creates ultra high-resolution 3-D digital terrain models of the earthquake damaged surfaces the ground, structures, and life-lines. This new technology allows for rapid and remote sensing of damaged terrain. Ground-based LIDAR has an accuracy range of 0.5-2.5 cm, and can illuminate targets up to 400m away from the sensor. During a single tripod-mounted LIDAR scan of 10 minutes, several million survey points are collected and processed into an ultra-high resolution terrain model of the damaged ground or structure. There are several benefits in acquiring these LIDAR data in the initial reconnaissance effort after the earthquake. First, we record the detailed failure morphologies of damaged ground and structures in order to make measurements that are either impractical or impossible by conventional survey means. The digital terrain models allow us to enlarge, enhance and rotate data in order to visualize damage in orientations and scales not previously possible. This ability to visualize damage allows us to better understand failure modes. Finally, LIDAR allows us to archive 3-D terrain models so that the engineering community can evaluate analytical and numerical models of deformation potential against detailed field measurements. Here, we discuss the findings of this 2004 Niigata Chuetsu Earthquake (M6\n\nOptimization of Causative Factors for Landslide Susceptibility Evaluation Using Remote Sensing and GIS Data in Parts of Niigata, Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nDou, Jie; Tien Bui, Dieu; Yunus, Ali P; Jia, Kun; Song, Xuan; Revhaug, Inge; Xia, Huan; Zhu, Zhongfan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper assesses the potentiality of certainty factor models (CF) for the best suitable causative factors extraction for landslide susceptibility mapping in the Sado Island, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. To test the applicability of CF, a landslide inventory map provided by National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) was split into two subsets: (i) 70% of the landslides in the inventory to be used for building the CF based model; (ii) 30% of the landslides to be used for the validation purpose. A spatial database with fifteen landslide causative factors was then constructed by processing ALOS satellite images, aerial photos, topographical and geological maps. CF model was then applied to select the best subset from the fifteen factors. Using all fifteen factors and the best subset factors, landslide susceptibility maps were produced using statistical index (SI) and logistic regression (LR) models. The susceptibility maps were validated and compared using landslide locations in the validation data. The prediction performance of two susceptibility maps was estimated using the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC). The result shows that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the LR model (AUC = 0.817) is slightly higher than those obtained from the SI model (AUC = 0.801). Further, it is noted that the SI and LR models using the best subset outperform the models using the fifteen original factors. Therefore, we conclude that the optimized factor model using CF is more accurate in predicting landslide susceptibility and obtaining a more homogeneous classification map. Our findings acknowledge that in the mountainous regions suffering from data scarcity, it is possible to select key factors related to landslide occurrence based on the CF models in a GIS platform. Hence, the development of a scenario for future planning of risk mitigation is achieved in an efficient manner.\n\nOptimization of Causative Factors for Landslide Susceptibility Evaluation Using Remote Sensing and GIS Data in Parts of Niigata, Japan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDou, Jie; Tien Bui, Dieu; P.

The effect of this smoking ban on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has not been evaluated. Changes in the annual number of ACS hospital cases in Hyogo Prefecture, before and after the enactment of the prefectural legislative ban on smoking in public places, are to be compared with those in Gifu Prefecture, where there is no smoking-ban legislation. Consecutive Hyogo residents with ACS, admitted to 33 major hospitals in the Hanshin-Awaji-Kobe district, which covers 56% of the population, during the 12 months before implementation of the legislation (April 2012 through March 2013) and during the same 24 months thereafter (April 2013 through March 2015) will be enrolled. Consecutive patients with ACS, who are Gifu residents, treated at the 20 major hospitals in Gifu Prefecture will be enrolled as geographical controls. The primary endpoint is the change in number of ACS admissions from April 2012 through March 2015, considering the periods before and after the smoking-ban legislation in Hyogo prefecture. Our study has certain strengths: (1) This is the first large Japanese study of ACS registry with smoking-ban legislation. (2) Major hospitals in the Hanshin-Awaji-Kobe district are included. (3) The data will cover 3 years including 1 year before legislation enactment. (4) The data will be compared with those of Gifu Prefecture, where smoking-ban legislation will not be enacted. (5) The very large database makes possible analysis of subgroups based on age and gender. Copyright Â© 2013 Japanese College of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Typical findings were as follows: 1. In pure-tone audiometry, 24 of 72 ears (33%) showed slight hearing deterioration and 3 (4%) showed improvement. 2. Spontaneous nystagmus had disappeared in 5 patients (14%), but appeared in new 13 patients (36%). Positional nystagmus did not improve in any patient, and deteriorated in 11 (31%). 3. In optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) tests, especially in vertical OKN test showing significant deterioration (44%). 4. The caloric nystagmus test showed marked deterioration (47%). Body-equilibrium testing showed slight deterioration in 11 patients (31%) and improvement in 5 (14%). Neurotological findings thus varied widely among patients and we were concluded that these differences were caused both by duration of methyl mercury contamination and by aging factors in patients.\n\nHidden Rift Structure Beneath a Thick Sedimentary Basin in the Niigata Region, Japan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakeda, T.; Enescu, B.; Asano, Y.; Obara, K.; Sekiguchi, S.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nNiigata region is located in a high-strain-rate zone, along the easternmost margin of the back-arc basin of the Sea of Japan (Sagiya et al., 2000, Okamura et al., 1995). In this region, two M6.8 inland earthquakes with reverse fault type focal mechanism, having NW-SE compression, occurred in 2004 and 2007. The reverse fault system may indicate present reactivation of the rift structure formed as a result of normal faulting when the Sea of Japan opened in the Miocene (Sato, 1994). Therefore, imaging the spatial extent of the rift structure is important to reveal the seismotectonics and occurrence mechanism of inland earthquakes. To resolve the fine structure beneath the Niigata region, we have installed a dense temporary network of 300 seismic stations and performed a regional tomography analysis. The temporary seismic network was designed with a multi-scale station spacing of 3 to 5 km in and around the aftershock areas of the two large earthquakes, and of ~10 km for the surrounding region. The 3D velocity tomography analysis and relocation of earthquakes were performed using the tomoDD software (Zhang and Thurber, 2003). We used 777 events that occurred after the installation of the temporary network and 703 events that were recorded only by the permanent seismic network (Hi-net) before the temporary network deployment. The initial 3D velocity model was constructed by using the 3D shallow velocity structure provided by the âJapan Seismic Hazard Information Stationâ (J-SHIS; Fujiwara et al., 2009) of NIED. The horizontal and vertical grid spacing were of 5 ~ 10 km and 2 ~ 4 km, respectively. The tomography analysis enabled us to delineate the fine subsurface structure. The high and low velocity pattern corresponds well to the Bouguer gravity anomalies mapped in the region. The velocity model shows a wide and relatively low velocity (< 5 km/sec for the P-wave velocity) band extending in a NE-SW direction. The band widens and narrows along its extent. The\n\nMinamata disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nEto, K\n\n2000-09-01\n\nMinamata disease (methylmercury poisoning) was first discovered in 1956 around Minamata Bay, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. A second epidemic in Japan occurred in 1965 along the Agano River, Niigata Prefecture. This paper presents a brief review of Minamata disease with an emphasis on the cases found in Kumamoto Prefecture. At autopsy, the most conspicuous destructive lesion in the cerebrum was found in the anterior portions of the calcarine cortex. Less severe but similar lesions may be found in the post-central, pre-central and temporal transverse cortices. Secondary degeneration from primary lesions may be seen in cases with long survival. In the cerebellum, pathological changes occur deep in the hemisphere. The granule cell population was more affected, compared with Purkinje cells. Among peripheral nerves, sensory nerves were more affected than motor nerves. Our recent experimental studies that reveal knowledge of the pathogenesis of methylmercury poisoning will be discussed.\n\nThe national financial adjustment policy and the equalisation of health levels among prefectures.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakano, T; Nakamura, K\n\n2001-10-01\n\nThe objectives of this study were to examine (1) trends concerning financial assistance from the national government to local governments, (2) trends regarding death rates and life expectancies among prefectures, and (3) the effect of the national financial adjustment policy in equalising both the revenues of local governments and variations in the health levels among prefectures in terms of death rates and life expectancies. The study analysed prefectural income, the amount of national taxes collected, financial assistance from the national government to local governments, and age adjusted death rates and life expectancies of all of the prefectures in Japan during the period from 1965 through 1995. (1) Under the financial adjustment policy, financial assistance from the national government to the local governments, which consists of the sum of the local allocation tax and treasury disbursements, increased from 1831 billion yen in 1965 to 31 116 billion yen in 1995. (2) During the same period, the age adjusted death rate per 100 000 people decreased from 1168.9 (1965) to 545.3 (1995). The range of variation in the age adjusted death rate among prefectures diminished as the coefficient of variation of the death rate declined from 0.060 in 1965 to 0.043 in 1995. (3) There was a significant statistical correlation between higher prefectural incomes and lower mortality rates during from 1965 until 1975 (p < 0.05), whereas this correlation was indistinct in the 1980s and has not been observed since 1990. (4) The relative health level of Tokyo has declined in terms of its ranking among all the prefectures with regard to life expectancy, from being the best in 1965 to below average in 1995. The national financial adjustment policy to balance the revenues of local governments has increased the health levels of rural prefectures. It is probable that the policy reduced the disparity in death rates and life expectancies among prefectures throughout the country. However, the\n\nEcological risk assessment of on-site soil washing with iron(III) chloride in cadmium-contaminated paddy field.\n\nPubMed\n\nNagai, Takashi; Horio, Takeshi; Yokoyama, Atsushi; Kamiya, Takashi; Takano, Hiroyuki; Makino, Tomoyuki\n\n2012-06-01\n\nOn-site soil washing with iron(III) chloride reduces Cd levels in soil, and thus the human health risks caused by Cd in food. However, it may threaten aquatic organisms when soil washing effluent is discharged to open aquatic systems. Therefore, we conducted trial-scale on-site soil washing and ecological risk assessment in Nagano and Niigata prefectures, Japan. The ecological effect of effluent water was investigated by two methods. The first was bioassay using standard aquatic test organisms. Twice-diluted effluent water from the Nagano site and the original effluent water from the Niigata site had no significant effects on green algae, water flea, caddisfly, and fish. The safe dilution rates were estimated as 20 times and 10 times for the Nagano and Niigata sites, respectively, considering an assessment factor of 10. The second method was probabilistic effect analysis using chemical analysis and the species sensitivity distribution concept. The mixture effects of CaCl(2), Al, Zn, and Mn were considered by applying a response additive model. The safe dilution rates, assessed for a potentially affected fraction of species of 5%, were 7.1 times and 23.6 times for the Nagano and Niigata sites, respectively. The actual dilution rates of effluent water by river water at the Nagano and Niigata sites were 2200-67,000 times and 1300-110,000 times, respectively. These are much larger than the safe dilution rates derived from the two approaches. Consequently, the ecological risk to aquatic organisms of soil washing is evaluated as being below the concern level. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The predisaster situation regarding stockpiles was abstracted from a 2010 survey. Timing of electricity and water restoration and sufficiency of supplies to continue operations were investigated through materials from Miyagi Prefecture disaster medicine headquarters (prefectural medical headquarters) and disaster base hospitals (14 hospitals) in Miyagi Prefecture after the East Japan earthquake. The number of hospitals with less than 1 day of stockpiles in reserve before the disaster was 7 (50%) for electricity supplies, 8 (57.1%) for water, 6 (42.9%) for medical goods, and 6 (42.9%) for food. After the disaster, restoration of electricity and water did not occur until the second day or later at 8 of 13 (61.5%) hospitals, respectively. By the fourth postdisaster day, 14 hospitals had requested supplies from the prefectural medical headquarters: 9 (64.3%) for electricity supplies, 2 (14.3%) for water trucks, 9 (64.3%) for medical goods, and 6 (42.9%) for food. The lack of supplies needed to continue operations in disaster base hospitals following the disaster clearly indicated that current business continuity plans require revision.\n\nA Case Study of the High School Entrance Examination in Chiba Prefecture, Japan.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBerman, David M.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nExamines the role of the Japanese prefecture (a regional government unit analogous to U.S. states) in school administration through a case study of the Chiba prefectural board of education's role in administering the high school entrance examination.

A total of 1,355 EVD cases, representing â40% of cases reported in Guinea, originated from these areas. Overall, Forecariah had the highest cumulative incidence (4Ã higher than that in Conakry). Case-fatality percentage ranged from 40% in Conakry to 60% in Kindia. Cumulative incidence was slightly higher among male than female residents, although incidences by prefecture and commune differed by sex.

Our objective was to describe the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic features of the 2014 epidemic in Koubia prefecture. This retrospective study examined all of the anthrax cases reported in Fafaya, Koubia Prefecture. In March and April 2014, there were 39 cases of human anthrax reported, for an incidence of 1.135%. The mean age was 20.9 (Â± 18.3) with a sex ratio of 2.54 (28/11) in favor of men. Seventy-six percent (23/39) were single. More than one half were students (53.8%). The main clinical signs were fever in 71, 8% (n = 28 /), papules 59% (n = 23), vesicles of 59% (n = 23) Digestive and cutaneous signs represented 35.9 % and 64.1% respectively; 35% had ingested contaminated meat and 17.95% were in direct contact with a sick animal. We didn't find any correlation between the mode of infection and onset of signs. The fatality rate was 28.21%. The 2014 epidemic of anthrax disease in the Koubia prefecture was marked by a high incidence and lethality. Clinical manifestations were cutaneaous and digestive. These results may serve further interventions to fight against anthrax disease. They should mainly focus on an awareness of peasants, surveillance and vaccination of cattle. Other studies seem to be necessary.\n\nImpact of endoscopic screening on mortality reduction from gastric cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHamashima, Chisato; Ogoshi, Kazuei; Narisawa, Rintarou; Kishi, Tomoki; Kato, Toshiyuki; Fujita, Kazutaka; Sano, Masatoshi; Tsukioka, Satoshi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAIM: To investigate mortality reduction from gastric cancer based on the results of endoscopic screening. METHODS: The study population consisted of participants of gastric cancer screening by endoscopy, regular radiography, and photofluorography at Niigata city in 2005. The observed numbers of cumulative deaths from gastric cancers and other cancers were accumulated by linkage with the Niigata Prefectural Cancer Registry. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of gastric cancer and other cancer deaths in each screening group was calculated by applying the mortality rate of the reference population. RESULTS: Based on the results calculated from the mortality rate of the population of Niigata city, the SMRs of gastric cancer death were 0.43 (95%CI: 0.30-0.57) for the endoscopic screening group, 0.68 (95%CI: 0.55-0.79) for the regular radiographic screening group, and 0.85 (95%CI: 0.71-0.94) for the photofluorography screening group. The mortality reduction from gastric cancer was higher in the endoscopic screening group than in the regular radiographic screening group despite the nearly equal mortality rates of all cancers except gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: The 57% mortality reduction from gastric cancer might indicate the effectiveness of endoscopic screening for gastric cancer. Further studies and prudent interpretation of results are needed.

School-based fluoride mouth-rinse (S-FMR) programs, a population strategy for dental caries prevention, might decrease dental caries inequalities. This study investigated the association between S-FMR and decreasing dental caries prevalence and caries-related inequalities in 12-year-olds by Japanese prefecture. We conducted an ecological study using multi-year prefecture-level aggregated data of children born between 1994 and 2000 in all 47 Japanese prefectures. Using two-level linear regression analyses (birth year nested within prefecture), the association between S-FMR utilization in each prefecture and 12-year-olds' decayed, missing, or filled permanent teeth (DMFT), which indicates dental caries experience in their permanent teeth, were examined. Variables that could explain DMFT inequalities between prefectures, such as dental caries experience at age 3 years, dentist density, and prefectural socioeconomic circumstances, were also considered. High S-FMR utilization was significantly associated with low DMFT at age 12 (coefficient -0.011; 95% confidence interval, -0.018 to -0.005). S-FMR utilization explained 25.2% of the DMFT variance between prefectures after considering other variables. Interaction between S-FMR and dental caries experience at age 3 years showed that S-FMR was significantly more effective in prefectures where the 3-year-olds had high levels of dental caries experience. S-FMR, administered to children of all socioeconomic statuses, was associated with lower DMFT. Utilization of S-FMR reduced dental caries inequalities via proportionate universalism.\n\nSchool-Based Fluoride Mouth-Rinse Program Dissemination Associated With Decreasing Dental Caries Inequalities Between Japanese Prefectures: An Ecological Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMatsuyama, Yusuke; Aida, Jun; Taura, Katsuhiko; Kimoto, Kazunari; Ando, Yuichi; Aoyama, Hitoshi; Morita, Manabu; Ito, Kanade; Koyama, Shihoko; Hase, Akihiro; Tsuboya, Toru; Osaka, Ken\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Dental caries inequalities still severely burden individualsâ and societyâs health, even in countries where fluoride toothpastes are widely used and the incidence of dental caries has been decreasing. School-based fluoride mouth-rinse (S-FMR) programs, a population strategy for dental caries prevention, might decrease dental caries inequalities. This study investigated the association between S-FMR and decreasing dental caries prevalence and caries-related inequalities in 12-year-olds by Japanese prefecture.

In Japan, a new postgraduate training program for all new medical graduates was introduced in 2004, and researchers have argued that this program has increased inequalities in physician distribution. We examined the trends in the geographic distribution of pediatricians as well as all physicians from 1996 to 2010 to identify the impact of the launch of the new training program. The Gini coefficient was calculated using municipalities as the study unit within each prefecture to assess whether there were significant changes in the intra-prefectural distribution of all physicians and pediatricians before and after the launch of the new training program. The effect of the new program was quantified by estimating the difference in the slope in the time trend of the Gini coefficients before and after 2004 using a linear change-point regression design. We categorized 47 prefectures in Japan into two groups: 1) predominantly urban and 2) others by the definition from OECD to conduct stratified analyses by urban-rural status. The trends in physician distribution worsened after 2004 for all physicians (p value<.0001) and pediatricians (p value = 0.0057). For all physicians, the trends worsened after 2004 both in predominantly urban prefectures (p value = 0.0012) and others (p value<0.0001), whereas, for pediatricians, the distribution worsened in others (p value = 0.0343), but not in predominantly urban prefectures (p value =0.0584). The intra-prefectural distribution of physicians worsened after the launch of the new training program, which may reflect the impact of the new postgraduate program. In pediatrics, changes in the Gini trend differed significantly before and after the launch of the new training program in others, but not in predominantly urban prefectures. Further observation is needed to explore how this difference in trends affects the health status of the child population.\n\n[A study of victims of methylmercury poisoning outbreaks by age and sex in Minamata, Niigata and Iraqi outbreaks].\n\nPubMed\n\nKinjo, Y; Nakano, A; Ishizaki, T; Maeda, K\n\n1991-07-01\n\nTo investigate features of the incidence of methylmercury poisoning cases presumably caused by intake of polluted foods in Japan and Iraq, several populations exposed to polluted foods were analyzed by geography and/or occupation. Ratios of confirmed cases to the corresponding number by age and sex in the defined exposed population were calculated. The distribution of the ratios showed a unimodal age distribution for both males and females in the Japanese Minamata and Niigata population. On the contrary, in the Iraqi population, ratios distributed equally by age and sex groups, having no peaks. This difference between the two countries is probably due to the difference of ingestion by age and sex in fish and wheat, which was the primary source of methylmercury exposure.\n\nThe Impact of Japan's 2004 Postgraduate Training Program on Intra-Prefectural Distribution of Pediatricians in Japan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSakai, Rie; Wang, Wei; Yamaguchi, Norihiro; Tamura, Hiroshi; Goto, Rei; Kawachi, Ichiro\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective Inequity in physician distribution poses a challenge to many health systems.

Methods of this research are questionnaire survey to prefectures implementing the agreement and survey by i town page to the number of stores of companies and the number of companies in the prefectures. Findings of this research are as follows: 1. The refusal rate of plastic shopping bags was 10-40% before the implementation of voluntary agreements. And the rate is approximately 70-90% after the implementation. Therefore, before and after the implementation of voluntary agreements, the refusal rate of plastic shopping bags is approximately 40-70% less. 2. It is suggested that the time and number of meetings from proposal to conclusion of the agreement are related in some way, to the ratio of stores participating. On the participation of administration, the ratio of stores participating in the case in which prefecture and cities participate is higher than in the case in which prefecture participates.\n\n[Contribution of the Department of Laboratory Medicine for the Protection and the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus in Tokushima Prefecture].\n\nPubMed\n\nNoma, Yoshihiko\n\n2006-09-01\n\nDiabetes mortality rates of Tokushima prefecture have been worst one in Japan for 12 years. We started up the organization named \"Tokushima Medical Doctors Association against Diabetes\" for the disease prevention and the improvement of the treatments in Tokushima prefecture. More than 240 medical doctors in Tokushima prefecture joined the association. The activities of the association are ( 1) training of medical doctors, (2) education for co-medical staffs, (3) education and enlightenment for patients and the public, (4) cooperation with Tokushima prefectural medical association and the communities. For the purpose of education for the co-medical staffs, we organized the association of Certified Diabetes Educator of Japan in Tokushima and support the association as the secretariat office. We also work as Tokushima branch office of Japan Association for Diabetes and Education and Care. The prevention of disease and the improvement of medical activity level are one of the big roles those the university hospital is responsible, because the university hospital is anticipated to work as a medical leader in the community. As the University hospital can take care of all medical staffs, so it is thought to be important to contribute the local medical treatment level different with the medical association and prefecture secretariat. The promotion conference for Diabetes mellitus was established last year. The relation among the associations we take care, the local medical association, and the prefecture secretariat are getting better. We hope that our cooperative activities will contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality from diabetes in Tokushima prefecture.\n\nPathology of Minamata disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nEto, K\n\n1997-01-01\n\nMinamata disease, or methylmercury poisoning, was first discovered in 1956 around Minamata Bay, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. A similar epidemic occurred in 1965 along the Agano River, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The neuropathology of Minamata disease has been well studied; this review focuses on human cases of Minamata disease in Kumamoto Prefecture. Nervous system lesions associated with Minamata disease have a characteristic distribution. In the cerebral cortex, the calcarine cortex was found to be involved in all cases of Minamata disease, particularly along the calcarine fissure. The destruction of nerve tissue was prominent in the anterior portions of the calcarine cortex. Occasionally, the centrifugal route from the visual and visual association areas (internal sagittal stratum) showed secondary degeneration in prolonged cases after acute onset. Postcentral, precentral, and temporal transverse cortices showed similar changes, though they were less severe. Intense lesions in the precentral cortex caused the development of secondary bilateral degeneration of the pyramidal tracts. In the cerebellum, the lesions occurred deeper in the hemisphere. The granule cell population was most affected. In the peripheral nerves, sensory nerves were more affected than motor nerves. Secondary degeneration of Goll's tracts was occasionally seen in prolonged or chronic cases.\n\nPopulation size dependency of measles epidemic that was scalable from Japanese prefectures to European countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshikura, Hiroshi\n\n2018-04-27\n\nRelation between number of measles patients (y) and population size (x) was expressed by an equation y = ax s , where a is a constant and s the slope of the plot; s was 2.04-2.17 for prefectures in Japan, i.e., the number of patients was proportional to square of the prefecture population size. For European countries that joined European Union no later than 2009, the slope was 1.43-1.87. The measles' population dependency found among prefectures in Japan was thus scalable up to European countries. It was surprising because, unlike Japan, population density in EU countries was not uniform and not proportional to the population size. The population size dependency was not observed among Western Pacific and South-East Asian countries probably on account of confounding interacting socioeconomic factors. Correlation between measles incidence and birth rate, infant mortality or GDP per capita was almost insignificant.Size distribution of local infection clusters (LICs) of measles and rubella in Japan followed power law. For measles, though the population dependency remained unchanged after \"elimination\", there was change in the Zipf-type plot of LIC sizes. After the \"elimination\", LICs linked to importation-related outbreaks in less populated prefectures emerged as the top-ranked LICs.\n\nRegional differences in population-based cancer survival between six prefectures in Japan: application of relative survival models with funnel plots.\n\nPubMed\n\nIto, Yuri; Ioka, Akiko; Tsukuma, Hideaki; Ajiki, Wakiko; Sugimoto, Tomoyuki; Rachet, Bernard; Coleman, Michel P\n\n2009-07-01\n\nWe used new methods to examine differences in population-based cancer survival between six prefectures in Japan, after adjustment for age and stage at diagnosis. We applied regression models for relative survival to data from population-based cancer registries covering each prefecture for patients diagnosed with stomach, lung, or breast cancer during 1993-1996. Funnel plots were used to display the excess hazard ratio (EHR) for each prefecture, defined as the excess hazard of death from each cancer within 5 years of diagnosis relative to the mean excess hazard (in excess of national background mortality by age and sex) in all six prefectures combined. The contribution of age and stage to the EHR in each prefecture was assessed from differences in deviance-based R(2) between the various models. No significant differences were seen between prefectures in 5-year survival from breast cancer. For cancers of the stomach and lung, EHR in Osaka prefecture were above the upper 95% control limits. For stomach cancer, the age- and stage-adjusted EHR in Osaka were 1.29 for men and 1.43 for women, compared with Fukui and Yamagata. Differences in the stage at diagnosis of stomach cancer appeared to explain most of this excess hazard (61.3% for men, 56.8% for women), whereas differences in age at diagnosis explained very little (0.8%, 1.3%). This approach offers the potential to quantify the impact of differences in stage at diagnosis on time trends and regional differences in cancer survival. It underlines the utility of population-based cancer registries for improving cancer control.\n\nGeographical structures and the cholera epidemic in modern Japan: Fukushima prefecture in 1882 and 1895.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuo, Chun-Lin; Fukui, Hiromichi\n\n2007-06-30\n\nDisease diffusion patterns can provide clues for understanding geographical change. Fukushima, a rural prefecture in northeast Japan, was chosen for a case study of the late nineteenth century cholera epidemic that occurred in that country. Two volumes of Cholera Ryu-ko Kiji (Cholera Epidemic Report), published by the prefectural government in 1882 and 1895, provide valuable records for analyzing and modelling diffusion. Text descriptions and numerical evidence culled from the reports were incorporated into a temporal-spatial study framework using geographic information system (GIS) and geo-statistical techniques. Changes in diffusion patterns between 1882 and 1895 reflect improvements in the Fukushima transportation system and growth in social-economic networks. The data reveal different diffusion systems in separate regions in which residents of Fukushima and neighboring prefectures interacted. Our model also shows that an area in the prefecture's northern interior was dominated by a mix of diffusion processes (contagious and hierarchical), that the southern coastal region was affected by a contagious process, and that other infected areas experienced relocation diffusion. In addition to enhancing our understanding of epidemics, the spatial-temporal patterns of cholera diffusion offer opportunities for studying regional change in modern Japan. By highlighting the dynamics of regional reorganization, our findings can be used to better understand the formation of an urban hierarchy in late nineteenth century Japan.\n\nFollow-up study of the regional quota system of Japanese medical schools and prefecture scholarship programmes: a study protocol.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsumoto, Masatoshi; Takeuchi, Keisuke; Tanaka, Junko; Tazuma, Susumu; Inoue, Kazuo; Owaki, Tetsuhiro; Iguchi, Seitaro; Maeda, Takahiro\n\n2016-04-15\n\nGiven the shortage of physicians, particularly in rural areas, the Japanese government has rapidly expanded the number of medical school students by adding chiikiwaku (regional quotas) since 2008. Quota entrants now account for 17% of all medical school entrants. Quota entrants are usually local high school graduates who receive a scholarship from the prefecture government. In exchange, they temporarily practise in that prefecture, including its rural areas, after graduation. Many prefectures also have scholarship programmes for non-quota students in exchange for postgraduate in-prefecture practice. The objective of this cohort study, conducted by the Japanese Council for Community-based Medical Education, is to evaluate the outcomes of the quota admission system and prefecture scholarship programmes nationwide. There are 3 groups of study participants: quota without scholarship, quota with scholarship and non-quota with scholarship. Under the support of government ministries and the Association of Japan Medical Colleges, and participation of all prefectures and medical schools, passing rate of the National Physician License Examination, scholarship buy-out rate, geographic distribution and specialties distribution of each group are analysed. Participants who voluntarily participated are followed by linking their baseline information to data in the government's biennial Physician Census. Results to date have shown that, despite medical schools' concerns about academic quality, the passing rate of the National Physician License Examination in each group was higher than that of all medical school graduates. The Ethics Committee for Epidemiological Research of Hiroshima University and the Research Ethics Committee of Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences permitted this study. No individually identifiable results will be presented in conferences or published in journals. The aggregated results will be reported to concerned government ministries\n\nSupports for libraries'restoration from the Great East Japan Earthquake : Challenges we address at Miyagi Prefectural Library\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKumagai, Shinichiro\n\nThis article overviews the situations of damage and reconstruction of mainly public libraries in Miyagi Prefecture about 9 months after the Great East Japan Earthquake. Serious damage of library buildings was due not only to the tsunami or seismic sea wave but to violent shaking, the latter less reported by the media. We at the Miyagi Prefectural Library implemented reconstruction assistance for regional public libraries in both direct and indirect ways. Among them, we report in detail on the support we offered until the Minami-sanriku Town Library reopened its service. We highlight a prefectural library's role, acting between supporters and those supportees, to consider the necessity of middle organizations. We clarify what challenges we face and examine how best to provide assistance in case of large-scale disasters.\n\nPopulation-based sexual behavior surveys in China: Liuzhou compared with other prefectural cities.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Yingying; Abler, Laurie; Pan, Suiming; Henderson, Gail E; Wang, Xin; Yao, Xingliang; Parish, William L\n\n2014-02-01\n\nSexual behaviors in China are rapidly changing; simultaneously, sexually transmitted infections (STI)/HIV prevalence is increasing in the general population. To investigate these major shifts, we examined sexual behaviors and self-reported STI in one prefectural city in southern China, Liuzhou, and compared it to other prefectural cities throughout China. We used adults age 18-39 from two sets of population-based surveys that paralleled each other in both content and method. The first set was the Liuzhou survey conducted in 2008 (n = 398). The second set consisted of two national surveys collected in 2006 and 2010 (n = 2,186). Liuzhou respondents reported more active social and sexual behaviors than their national counterparts, including more socializing, dancing, drinking excessively, sexual activity among never married men and women, purchasing commercial sex among men, one-night stands among men, multiple sexual partnerships and self-reported STI among both men and women. Women in Liuzhou reported greater sexual risk behavior than their national counterparts, although overall they reported less than their male counterparts; they were also more likely to have had an abortion than women in other prefectural cities. Our findings provide a comprehensive overview of the sexual context of Liuzhou among the general population, which may help explain the greater STI/HIV prevalence in Liuzhou.\n\nPopulation-based sexual behavior surveys in China: Liuzhou compared with other prefectural cities\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYingying, Huang; Abler, Laurie; Suiming, Pan; Henderson, Gail E.; Xin, Wang; Xingliang, Yao; Parish, William L.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSexual behaviors in China are rapidly changing; simultaneously, STI/HIV prevalence is increasing in the general population.

The 108km/hr isobar jet stream line converged around an epicenter on 2007/07/01 12:00 and 2007/07/02 06:00. Before a devastating earthquake occurs, the underground water level usually changes caused by the rock squishing or loosening. This study assumed that rock squishing or loosening caused air inhalation or exhalation that creates an internal gravity wave. This phenomenon will change the jet streams at an altitude of 10 km. Ps.

Some of those events (e.g., the 2004 Chuetsu earthquake) occurred in a tectonic zone which is characterized as a high strain rate zone by the GPS observation (Sagiya et al., 2000) or dense distribution of active faults. That belt-like zone along the coast in Japan Sea side of Tohoku and Chubu districts, and north of Kinki district, is called as the Niigata-Kobe tectonic zone (NKTZ, Sagiya et al, 2000). We investigate seismic scaling relationship for recent inland crustal earthquake sequences in Japan and compare source characteristics between events occurring inside and outside of NKTZ. We used S-wave coda part for estimating source spectra. Source spectral ratio is obtained by S-wave coda spectral ratio between the records of large and small events occurring close to each other from nation-wide strong motion network (K-NET and KiK-net) and broad-band seismic network (F-net) to remove propagation-path and site effects. We carefully examined the commonality of the decay of coda envelopes between event-pair records and modeled the observed spectral ratio by the source spectral ratio function with assuming omega-square source model for large and small events. We estimated the corner frequencies and seismic moment (ratio) from those modeled spectral ratio function. We determined Brune's stress drops of 356 events (Mw: 3.1-6.9) in ten earthquake sequences occurring in NKTZ and six sequences occurring outside of NKTZ. Most of source spectra obey omega-square source spectra. There is no obvious systematic difference between stress drops of events in NKTZ zone and others. We may conclude that the systematic tendency of seismic source scaling of the events occurred inside and outside of NKTZ does not exist and the average source scaling relationship can be effective for inland crustal earthquakes.

However, the effective duration, extent, and timing of closures remain unresolved. We conducted a retrospective study on the relationship between elementary class closures and influenza outbreak control during four consecutive influenza seasons from the 2004-2005 to 2007-2008 school years in Joetsu, Niigata, Japan. Among a total of 1,061 classes of 72 schools, 624 cases of influenza outbreaks were documented among 61 schools. Class closures were carried out in a total of 62 cases in response to influenza outbreak, which was defined as a student absentee rate of greater than 10% due to influenza or influenza-like illness. Of these cases, two-day class closures were conducted the day after reaching a 10% student absentee rate in 28 cases and other types of closures were initiated in 34 cases. A markedly higher number of outbreak cases ended within one week for two-day class closures compared to the other types of closures (82.1% vs. 20.6%, respectively). The significant association between two-day class closures and interruption of an outbreak within one week was confirmed using a multivariable model adjusted for the season, grade, day of the week of an outbreak start, and absentee rate on the day of an outbreak start (OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.12-9.07; pâ=â0.030). Our results suggest that a two-day class closure carried out the day after reaching a 10% absentee rate is an effective approach for mitigating influenza outbreaks in elementary schools.\n\nEpidemiology of Echinococcosis Among Schoolchildren in Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nCai, Huixia; Guan, Yayi; Ma, Xiao; Wang, Liying; Wang, Hu; Su, Guoming; Zhang, Xuefei; Han, Xiumin; Ma, Junying; Liu, Yu Fang; Li, Jun; Zhang, Jingxiao; Wang, Yongshun; Wang, Wei; Du, Rui; Lei, Wen; Wu, Weiping\n\n2017-03-01\n\nEchinococcosis is a serious zoonotic parasitic disease that is highly endemic in Qinghai Province. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of echinococcosis among schoolchildren in Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture to improve early diagnosis and treatment of patients and to provide information for echinococcosis prevention and control. A total of 11,260 schoolchildren from five counties (Maqin, Gander, Dari, Jiuzhi, and Banma) in Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, were screened for echinococcosis. Screening involved ultrasound imaging combined with serologic examination as an auxiliary diagnostic test. The prevalence of echinococcosis in the schoolchildren was 2.1% (235/11,260), with a rate of 0.8% for cystic echinococcosis (CE; 89/11,260) and 1.3% for alveolar echinococcosis (AE; 146/11,260). Additionally, one child had a mixed infection. The prevalence ranged between 1.1% and 4.1% among the five investigated counties, and was highest in Dari County (4.1%). The prevalence of echinococcosis was higher in girls than in boys and gradually increased with age. In addition, children with CE mainly had type 1 (CE1) and type 3 (CE3) lesions, and children with AE mainly had small-diameter calcified lesions, suggesting that they were in the early asymptomatic stage of echinococcosis. In conclusion, children of Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture appear to exhibit the highest recorded prevalence of CE and AE globally. Ultrasound is useful for screening populations in regions where both CE and AE are endemic.\n\nEpidemiology of Echinococcosis among Schoolchildren in Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCai, Huixia; Guan, Yayi; Ma, Xiao; Wang, Liying; Wang, Hu; Su, Guoming; Zhang, Xuefei; Han, Xiumin; Ma, Junying; Liu, Yu Fang; Li, Jun; Zhang, Jingxiao; Wang, Yongshun; Wang, Wei; Du, Rui; Lei, Wen; Wu, Weiping\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEchinococcosis is a serious zoonotic parasitic disease that is highly endemic in Qinghai Province.

The objective was to clarify the present incidence of low back pain (LBP) in childhood and adolescence in Japan. It has recently been recognized that LBP in childhood and adolescence is also as common a problem as that for adults and most of these studies have been conducted in Europe, however, none have so far been made in Japan. A questionnaire survey was conducted using 43,630 pupils, including all elementary school students from the fourth to sixth grade (21,893 pupils) and all junior high students from the first to third year (21,737 pupils) in Niigata City (population of 785,067) to examine the point prevalence of LBP, the lifetime prevalence, the gender differences, the age of first onset of LBP in third year of junior high school students, the duration, the presence of recurrent LBP or not, the trigger of LBP, and the influences of sports and physical activities. In addition, the severity of LBP was divided into three levels (level 1: no limitation in any activity; level 2: necessary to refrain from participating in sports and physical activities, and level 3: necessary to be absent from school) in order to examine the factors that contribute to severe LBP. The validity rate was 79.8% and the valid response rate was 98.8%. The point prevalence was 10.2% (52.3% male and 47.7% female) and the lifetime prevalence was 28.8% (48.5% male and 51.5% female). Both increased as the grade level increased and in third year of junior high school students, a point prevalence was seen in 15.2% while a lifetime prevalence was observed in 42.5%. About 90% of these students experienced first-time LBP during the first and third year of junior high school. Regarding the duration of LBP, 66.7% experienced it for less than 1Â week, while 86.1% suffered from it for less than 1Â month. The recurrence rate was 60.5%. Regarding the triggers of LBP, 23.7% of them reported the influence of\n\nGeological and seismological survey for new design-basis earthquake ground motion of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa NPS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakao, M.; Mizutani, H.\n\n2009-05-01\n\nAt about 10:13 on July 16, 2007, a strong earthquake named 'Niigata-ken Chuetsu-oki Earthquake' of Mj6.8 on Japan Meteorological Agencyfs scale occurred offshore Niigata prefecture in Japan. However, all of the nuclear reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Station (KKNPS) in Niigata prefecture operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company shut down safely. In other words, automatic safety function composed of shutdown, cooling and containment worked as designed immediately after the earthquake. During the earthquake, the peak acceleration of the ground motion exceeded the design-basis ground motion (DBGM), but the force due to the earthquake applied to safety-significant facilities was about the same as or less than the design basis taken into account as static seismic force. In order to assess anew the safety of nuclear power plants, we have evaluated a new DBGM after conducting geomorphological, geological, geophysical, seismological survey and analyses. [Geomorphological, Geological and Geophysical survey] In the land area, aerial photograph interpretation was performed at least within the 30km radius to extract geographies that could possibly be tectonic reliefs as a geomorphological survey. After that, geological reconnaissance was conducted to confirm whether the extracted landforms are tectonic reliefs or not. Especially we carefully investigated Nagaoka Plain Western Boundary Fault Zone (NPWBFZ), which consists of Kakuda-Yahiko fault, Kihinomiya fault and Katakai fault, because NPWBFZ is the one of the active faults which have potential of Mj8 class in Japan. In addition to the geological survey, seismic reflection prospecting of approximate 120km in total length was completed to evaluate the geological structure of the faults and to assess the consecutiveness of the component faults of NPWBFZ. As a result of geomorphological, geological and geophysical surveys, we evaluated that the three component faults of NPWBFZ are independent to each other from the\n\nDistribution of Rotavirus Genotypes from the 2008/2009 to the 2015/2016 Season in Nara Prefecture, Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nSugimoto, Daichi; Nakano, Mamoru; Inada, Machi; Fujitani, Misako; Chiba, Shoko; Sakai, Takeshi\n\n2017-09-25\n\nThis study was conducted to investigate the distribution of rotavirus genotypes in Nara Prefecture, Japan before and after the introduction of rotavirus vaccination in 2011. Since the 2011/2012 season, DS-1-like G1P[8] strains have been detected in Nara Prefecture, accounting for about half of all strains in the 2014/2015 season. During the 2015/2016 season, no DS-1-like G1P[8] strains were detected; G2P[4] was the predominant genotype.\n\nTransplant Procurement"
