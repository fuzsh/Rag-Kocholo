An extremely talented pianist who wants to be a kindergarten teacher, she prefers playing by ear rather than reading the music score. She is messy and disorganized, takes baths several days apart and loves to eat, sometimes stealing her friend’s lunchbox when it is filled with delicacies.\n\nShinichi Chiaki, is Momogaoka’s top student. Born into a musical family, he is talented in piano and violin and has secret ambitions to become a conductor. An arrogant multi-lingual perfectionist who once lived abroad in the music capitals of the world as a young boy, he feels mired in Japan because of a childhood phobia.\n\nThey meet by accident. Nodame quickly falls in love, but it takes much longer for Chiaki to even begin to appreciate Nodame’s unusual qualities. Their relationship causes them both to develop and grow. Because of Nodame, Chiaki got the opportunity to lead a student orchestra and begins to have a broader appreciation of people’s musical abilities. Because of Chiaki, Nodame faces her fears and enters a piano competition. Opportunities open up as both begin taking risks, stretching themselves far more than they ever thought possible.\n\nCast\n\nProduction Credits\n\nOriginal writing: Ninomiya Tomoko Nodame Cantabile (manga)\n\nScreenwriter: Etou Rin\n\nProducers: Wakamatsu Hiroki, Shimizu Kazuyuki\n\nDirectors: Takeuchi Hideki, Kawamura Yasuhiro (川村泰祐), Tanimura Masaki\n\nMusic: Hattori Takayuki\n\nRecognitions\n\n51st Television Drama Academy Awards: Best Drama\n\n51st Television Drama Academy Awards: Best Actress: Ueno Juri\n\n51st Television Drama Academy Awards: Best Director: Takeuchi Hideki\n\n51st Television Drama Academy Awards: Best Musical Arrangement: Takeuchi Hideki\n\n51st Television Drama Academy Awards: Best Opening: Hattori Takayuki\n\n2nd Seoul Drama Awards: Best Miniseries\n\n2nd Seoul Drama Awards: Best Director: Takeuchi Hideki\n\n2nd Seoul Drama Awards: Best Music\n\nClassical Music\n\nEp 01:\n\nPresto agitato from Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 14 in C sharp minor, Op. 27 no. 2 “Moonlight” Sonata [Chiaki]\n\nAdagio cantabile from Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13 “Pathétique” [Nodame]\n\nAllegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125 [A Orchestra]\n\nDer Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen from Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte” (The Magic Flute) [Saiko]\n\nAllegro con spirito from Mozart’s Sonata in D major for two Pianos K 375a (K 448) [Nodame/Chiaki]\n\nEp 02:\n\nAllegro from Beethoven’s Sonata for Piano and Violin in F major, Op. 24 “Spring” [Nodame/Chiaki/Mine]\n\nAllegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125 [A Orchestra]\n\nEp 03:\n\nPoco sostenuto — Vivace from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7 in A major, Op. 92 [S Orchestra/A Orchestra]\n\nOverture from Mozart’s Le nozze di Figaro, K. 492 [S Orchestra]\n\nEp 04:\n\nPoco sostenuto — Vivace from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7 in A major, Op. 92 [S Orchestra]\n\nAllegro con brio from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7 in A major, Op. 92 [S Orchestra]\n\nAllegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125 [A Orchestra]\n\nBeethoven’s Symphony No. 7 in A major, Op. 92 (Piano) [Nodame]\n\nEp 05:\n\nModerato Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 18 [Chiaki/A Orchestra]\n\nAllegro scherzando Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 18 [Chiaki/A Orchestra]\n\nGershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue [S Orchestra]\n\nEp 06:\n\nModerato Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 18 (2 Piano) [Chiaki/Nodame]\n\nAllegro scherzando Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 18 (2 Piano) [Chiaki/Nodame]\n\nEp 07:\n\nChopin’s Fantaisie-Impromptu Op. 66 C sharp minor [Tanioka Hajime’s pupil]\n\nMendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64 [Kiyora]\n\nAllegro aperto Mozart’s Oboe Concerto in C major, K. 314 [R☆S Orchestra]\n\nUn poco sostenuto – Allegro – meno Allegro Brahms’s Symphony No. 1 in C major, Op. 68 [R☆S Orchestra]\n\nEp 08:\n\nUn poco sostenuto – Allegro – meno Allegro Brahms’s Symphony No. 1 in C major, Op. 68 [R☆S Orchestra]\n\nRondo: Allegretto Mozart’s Oboe Concerto in C major, K. 314 [R☆S Orchestra]\n\nUn poco sostenuto – Allegro – meno Allegro Brahms’s Symphony No. 1 in C major, Op. 68 [R☆S Orchestra]\n\nAdagio – Più Andante – Allegro non troppo ma con brio – Più Allegro Brahms’s Symphony No. 1 in C major, Op. 68 [R☆S Orchestra]\n\nEp 09:\n\nAllegro con spirito from Mozart’s Sonata in D major for two Pianos K. 375a (K. 448) [Nodame]\n\nModerato Schubert’s Piano Sonate in A Minor, Op. 42 (D. 845) [Nodame]\n\nRondo: Allegro vivace Schubert’s Piano Sonate in A Minor, Op. 42 (D. 845) [Nodame]\n\nChopin’s 12 Etudes Op. 10 No. 4 in C-sharp minor [Nodame]\n\nClaude Debussy’s L’Isle Joyeuse, L. 106 [Nodame]\n\nEp 10:\n\nChopin’s 12 Etudes Op. 10 No. 4 in C-sharp minor [Nodame]\n\nClaude Debussy’s L’Isle Joyeuse, L. 106 [Nodame]\n\nSaint-Saëns’s “Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso”, Op. 28, “Introduction” (Violin) [Takahashi]\n\nBrahms’s Paganini variations, Op. 35 [Segawa]\n\nSchuman’s Sonata in G minor, Op. 22 [Nodame]\n\nDanse russe.

(http://www.videor.co.jp/)\n\nReviews\n\nby Daemonneko\n\nBased on a true story, One Litre of Tears is about the life story Kitou Aya (1962-1988) a girl who had an incurable disease called Spinocerebellar Degeneration Disease (also known as SCA type 2; spinocerebellar ataxia type 2)at a young age of 15. Although the girl in the drama – Ikeuchi Aya, lived in the 21st century, her character was based on Kitou Aya’s life, how she struggled and fought her disease and how she wrote her deepest thoughts until the last day she could hold a pen. Before she died, her writings were published including the poems she wrote while she is staying in a school for the disabled. This gave new hopes to people who suffers the same disease as she did and soon Aya received letters of appreciation and thanks from those people. At the age of 25, she succumbed herself into a sleep where she could no longer feel any pain.\n\nIchi Rittoru no Namida is a heart-warming drama that will make people happy for the simple fact that they are alive, and will give hope to those who suffers from diseases and will make them think positive about living instead of giving up easily.\n\nI give this drama two-thumbs up!\n\nSpecial\n\nTitle: 「１リットルの涙」特別篇‧追憶\n\nViewership ratings: 17.0\n\nBroadcast date: 2007-Apr-05\n\nAir time: 21:00\n\nInsert song: Umarekuru Kodomotachi no Tame ni by Oda Kazumasa (uncredited)\n\nSynopsis\n\nThis special is set half a year after the death of Aya.

The students have multi-colored hair, sloppy uniforms, and show absolutely no respect to her. The leader of the class, Sawada Shin is lazy but bright and shows some interest in Yamaguchi when he notices that she is very different from other teachers. The students try to bully her to make her quit, but their attempts don’t get them very far.\n\nWhat the class and the rest of the school does not know is that Yamaguchi Kumiko is actually the 4th generation heir to the Ooedo Group, a notorious yakuza clan. Even though her family would like her to take the title of Ojou when her grandfather dies, they have accepted the fact that Yamaguchi would rather be a teacher.\n\nEventually, the students learn to respect their quirky teacher because of her devotion to them, and even give her a nickname: Yankumi.\n\nCast\n\nNakama Yukie as Yamaguchi Kumiko (Yankumi / Ojou / Kumicho) (Math Teacher/Class 3D adviser)\n\nMatsumoto Jun as Sawada Shin\n\nNamase Katsuhisa as Sawatari Goro, Kyoto (School Vice Principal)\n\nUtsui Ken as Kuroda Ryuichiro (Kumiko’s grandpa / 3rd Generation Oedo Yakuza Boss)\n\nAnan Kenji as Wakamatsu Hiro\n\nKaneko Ken as Asakura Tetsu\n\nUchiyama Shinji as Tatsukawa Minoru\n\nRyogoku Hiroshi as Sugawara Makoto\n\nOguri Shun as “Uchi” / Uchiyama Haruhiko\n\nWaki Tomohiro as “Kuma” / Kumai Teruo\n\nNarimiya Hiroki as Noda Takeshi\n\nIshigaki Yuma as Minami Yoichi\n\nIto Misaki as Fujiyama Shizuka (English Teacher)\n\nNakazawa Yuko as Kawashima Kikuno (School Nurse)\n\nNabe Osami as Ando Osamu (Social Studies Teacher)\n\nKohmoto Masahiro as Iwamoto Kohei (P.E.

He went into exile and lived in a seaside shack when he was visited by Akira Kato, assistant professor of the Faculty of Cardiac Surgery at Meishin University Medical Hospital.\n\nDespite being a female doctor, Akira managed to become an assistant professor. She was ambitious and set her goal to be promoted to full professor by succeeding in a surgery using the Batista technique — an extremely difficult type of heart surgery — and to write a paper on it. A year ago, Akira witnessed Ryutaro’s skills when he was an NGO doctor and was impressed enough to seek his assistance in the Batista technique.\n\nThis drama exposed the difficulties encountered in the rigid Japanese medical professions in treating patients whereby decisions made were based more on protecting the hospitals than the patients.\n\nCast\n\nSakaguchi Kenji as Asada Ryuutarou\n\nInamori Izumi as Katou Akira\n\nMizukawa Asami as Satohara Miki\n\nKoike Teppei as Ijyuuin Noboru\n\nNatsuki Mari as Kitou Shoko\n\nKitamura Kazuki as Kirima Gunji\n\nAbe Sadao as Arase Monji\n\nSasaki Kuranosuke as Fujiyoshi Keishi\n\nKishibe Ittoku as Noguchi Keno\n\nIkeda Tetsuhiro\n\nMukaichi Mion\n\nKanai Yuta (ep5-6)\n\nShimizu Koji (ep8-11)\n\nProduction Credits\n\nOriginal writing: Nogizaka Taro Iryu (manga)\n\nScreenwriter: Hayashi Hiroshi (林宏司)\n\nProducers: Osabe Sosuke (長部聡介),, Higashi Yasuyuki (東康之)\n\nDirectors: Kubota Satoshi (久保田哲史), Mizuta Narihide\n\nMusic: Kono Shin, Sawano Hiroyuki (澤野弘之)\n\nRecognitions\n\n49th Television Drama Academy Awards: Best Drama\n\n49th Television Drama Academy Awards: Best Musical Arrangement, Kono Shin (河野伸)\n\n49th Television Drama Academy Awards: Best Director, Kubota Satoshi (久保田哲史)\n\nSeason 2\n\nEpisodes: 11\n\nViewership ratings: 16.8(Kanto)\n\nBroadcast period: 2007-Oct-11 to 2007-Dec-20\n\nAir time: Thursday 22:00\n\nTheme song: ONE by AI\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn Iryu 2, Asada Ryutaro wages a new battle against the realities of Japan’s medical care system. The government has drafted legislation to tackle the recent inflation of medical fees; hospitals have entered an era in which they will go bankrupt if they aren’t independently run. At the same time, hospital mergers and takeovers are also taking place. Additionally, the obstetrics and pediatrics departments are being closed in succession, and there are inadequate doctors in the region – issues that are closely related to these hospital management problems. Now, hospitals, like the average corporation, face collapse if they are not profitable. — jade_frost\n\nCast\n\nSakaguchi Kenji as Asada Ryutaro\n\nUchida Yuki as Kataoka Kazumi\n\nKoike Teppei as Ijyuuin Noboru\n\nOtsuka Nene as Kodaka Nanami\n\nKitamura Kazuki as Kirishima Gunji\n\nAbe Sadao as Arase Monji\n\nMizukawa Asami as Satohara Miki\n\nSasaki Kuranosuke as Fujiyoshi Keisuke\n\nNatsuki Mari as Kito Shoko\n\nKishibe Ittoku as Noguchi Takeo\n\nIkeda Tetsuhiro as Kihara Takehiko\n\nSato Jiro as Matsudaira Kotaro\n\nShiga Kotaro as Zenda Hideki\n\nTakahashi Issei as Toyama Seiji\n\nNakamura Yasuhi as Nomura Hirohito\n\nSupporting Cast & Guests\n\nProduction Credits"
