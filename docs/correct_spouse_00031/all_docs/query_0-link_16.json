        "text": "Actor Kubozuka Yosuke (25) is said to be recovering well from his 26m fall from his apartment balcony on Sunday. He has several broken bones, but is fully conscious and has apologized for worrying people. The fall is said to have happened while he was removing a device used to hold traditional “koi nobori” (carp streamers) from the balcony.\n\n• As was predicted here last week, actor Kashiwabara Takashi (27) and former TV personality Hatano Hiroko (photo, 28) got married on Sunday."
