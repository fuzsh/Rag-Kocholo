        "text": "The relationship between Japan and Christianity is a long and fascinating story. Since mid-sixteenth century, Christianity has been notably active in Japan, yet today, less than 1.54 percent of Japanese people are Christians (1) ; hence Japan is one of the least evangelized nations in the world. The main question here is therefore, “What are the main factors why Christianity has not yet succeeded in Japan?” I am aware of the complexity of this question, however, during my studies of Japanese culture, society and history at Leiden University, and because of my active involvement in Christianity, I have gradually developed the hypothesis which I will discuss in detail throughout this paper.\n\nThis research considers the comparative study of the power structures between Japanese culture and one of the unique Christian groups in Japan, the Non-Church Christian (NCCs). The power structure of the NCC will be compared with the Western church. It might be nonsense to make inquiries into the power structure of the NCCs because they are Churchless. They do not have defined forms, such as institutions, pastors, and communities. However, there should be some measurable power, because many NCCs are still alive in Japan. If no driving force existed among them, they would not exist today."
