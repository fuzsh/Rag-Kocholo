        "meta_description": "Jamais Vu by Regan, released 20 April 2023\n\nLYRICS:\nI walk along the old uneven pavers of Hay St.\nI look into all the unfamiliar yet familiar faces\nMemories are ghosts of my youth as I pass the old book store\nThe smell reminds me of lost love  \nI have no destination, as the wind whips my hair in my face \nAnd the inane chatter whips my ears lalalala la la la\nI avoid the heart sink of nostalgia \nLike I negotiate - the unstable path\nI look down, but footfalls approach as I round the corner \nI look up hoping to see a face from long ago \nBut am left with the regret \nOf missed opportunities",
