        "text": "Derealization\n\nOverview\n\nWhile the phrase is déjà vu describes the sensation of experiencing the present situation in the past, and has been “already seen.”[1] Conversely, jamais vu is used when an individual perceives a familiar situation as if they have never confronted it or seen it with \"new eyes\".[2] Similarly to jamais vu, derealization refers to a shift in an individual's perception of the world, making it seem different from its usual appearance or feeling.[3] For example, imagine someone gazing out of their office window where they have seen the same skyline for a decade. if a person were experiencing derealization, the familiar view would suddenly take on a muffled quality, leaving them with a sense of disconnection.\n\nCauses\n\nWhile derealization symptoms are often associated with depression, anxiety, and acute trauma resulting from motor accidents, instances of abuse and imprisonment can also lead to derealization.[4] Additionally, Heydrich et al. (2019) found isolated case reports and small case series that also documented associations between derealization symptoms and epilepsy.[5] According to Murphy (2023), earlier research has primarily concentrated on specific brain regions associated with the sensation of derealization.[6] These regions play a role in adaptive stress responses through defense mechanisms that involve autonomic functions, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and various interconnected neural circuits.[7]\n\nOther neurological conditions (e.g., migraines and mild traumatic brain injuries) have been recognized as potential catalysts for derealization.[8] Additionally, derealization can manifest as a secondary symptom in the context of other psychiatric disorders, such as borderline personality disorder (BPD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[9] As per the findings by Madden and Einhorn (2018), depersonalization symptoms induced by cannabis have been studied in the literature for several years.[10] While not everyone who uses cannabis will encounter derealization, those who do experience it will typically have the onset of cannabis-induced derealization symptoms peak around 30 minutes after consumption and will dissipate within 120 minutes of drug exposure.[11] Individuals with a prior history of anxiety disorders, including panic disorders or social phobia, are at a heightened risk of experiencing symptoms induced by cannabis.[12]\n\nSymptoms\n\nDerealization symptoms include:[13]\n\nFamiliar people and places seem surreal.\n\nThe environment appears distorted and lacks vibrancy.\n\nThree-dimensional objects and settings appear flat.\n\nRecent experiences feel as if they transpired in the distant past.\n\nAn altered sense of distance, size, and shape for objects, creating an unrealistic perspective.\n\nFeels like the ground is shifting while walking.[14]\n\nRegarding psychological disorders, Schlax et al. (2020) conducted a study to see if depersonalization and derealization could be markers of disease severity and poor prognosis.[15] The study revealed that 8.7% of participants were troubled by derealization symptoms at baseline and that these participants faced an increased risk of elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety.[16]\n\nTreatment\n\nPsychotherapy plays a pivotal role in a comprehensive treatment approach for derealization and similar trauma-related disorders. When an individual is going through a challenging period with frequent dissociations, support interventions, like crisis management and coping strategies, are highly recommended.[17] During times when symptoms are milder, psychodynamic therapy, which encourages self-reflection and self-evaluation, is a valuable approach.[18] According to Gentile (2014), patients who undergo treatment interventions addressing their trauma-related symptoms are at a greater likelihood of improved functioning and reduced residual symptoms.[19] Additional treatment may include the use of medications, such as antidepressants.[20]\n\nIf you suspect you are experiencing derealization from stress, trauma or anxiety disorder, please reach out to a licensed mental health professional (e.g., a psychotherapist, psychologist or psychiatrist) for additional guidance and support\n\nContributed by: Kelly Valentin\n\nEditor: Jennifer (Ghahari) Smith, Ph.D."
