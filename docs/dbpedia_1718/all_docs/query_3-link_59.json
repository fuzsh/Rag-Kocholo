        "text": "Now I‚Äôve got my own blog I thought I‚Äôd throw this up there as it‚Äôs caused much mirth over the years!\n\nAugust 1997 I got a call from my agent asking if I knew who Joe Cocker was. I said I did and was a fan. An hour later I was in a studio in Soho auditioning for the part of ‚Äúthe young Joe Cocker‚Äù in this pop video for the song N‚ÄôOubliez Jamais from his Across From Midnight album.\n\nI didn‚Äôt realise till I got to Paris with the lovely Claire from Wales, that Catherine Deneuve was going to be in the clip too.\n\nWhen we arrived at Gare Du Nord, the director asked us to go to the cinema while they shot Joe and Catherine‚Äôs scenes because he didn‚Äôt think they want to be reminded of their youth! We declined and spent 2 days stopping traffic all over Paris shooting hours of footage.\n\nIt was a huge hit on the continent, I‚Äôve never met anyone from France or Belgium who can‚Äôt sing the chorus, and it made MTV & VH1 as well.\n\nOn first viewing I guess it all looks kind of cool but watch when I step out of the garage and get tangled up with the exhaust pipe on the floor. The scene where I‚Äôm trying to kiss Claire in the moonlight is punctuated with her pulling away ‚Äì she said she had a boyfriend and it wasn‚Äôt in her contract! Lastly watch me smack my head as I get into the VW Camper Van üôÇ The band scene was filmed in a pub in Camden and took an entire day!\n\n10 years later, this past summer, I saw Joe Cocker perform a gig at The Tower of London.\n\nHe didn‚Äôt play the song because no one over here has heard it, and I was asked to keep quiet by an orginal Woodstocker, as me and a friend were apparantly talking too loudly!\n\nRock & Roll!\n\n[youtube:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBpyuYgfCWA]"
