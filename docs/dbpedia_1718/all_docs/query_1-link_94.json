        "text": "What is temporal lobe epilepsy?\n\nTemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is epilepsy that starts in the temporal lobe area of your brain. You have two temporal lobes, one on each side of your head behind your temples (by your ears and in alignment with your eyes).\n\nTLE is the most common localized (also called “focal”) type of epilepsy. About 60% of people with focal epilepsy have TLE.\n\nThere are two types of TLE.\n\nMesial (“near the middle”) temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). About 80% of all temporal lobe seizures start in the mesial temporal lobe, with seizures often starting in or near a structure called the hippocampus. You have a hippocampus in each temporal lobe, which control memory and learning. MTLE is the most common form of epilepsy.\n\nNeocortical or lateral TLE. In this type of TLE, seizures start in the outer section of your temporal lobe. This type of TLE is very rare and mostly due to a genetic cause or lesions such as a tumor, birth defect, blood vessel abnormality or other abnormalities in the temporal lobe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat brain functions are controlled by the temporal lobe?\n\nYour temporal lobe processes memories and sounds, interprets vision and governs speech and language. It’s also involved in some unconscious/automatic responses such as hunger, thirst, fight-or-flight, emotions and sexual arousal.\n\nYour right and left temporal lobes differ in their functions. One or more functions may be affected depending on the exact location where the seizure starts in your temporal lobe. Right temporal lobe epilepsy may affect such functions as learning and memorizing nonverbal information (such as music and drawings), recognizing information and determining facial expressions. Your left temporal lobe is usually the dominant lobe in most people. Left temporal lobe epilepsy may affect your ability to understand language, learn, memorize, form speech and remember verbal information.\n\nWho does temporal lobe epilepsy affect?\n\nAnyone, of any race or sex, can develop epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy usually begins between 10 and 20 years of age, although it can start at any age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho is at risk for temporal lobe epilepsy?\n\nFactors that can lead to an increased risk of developing temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) include:\n\nHaving a long seizure (status epilepticus) or a seizure that results from a high fever (febrile seizure). Some 66% of people who have TLE have a history of febrile seizures, which usually occur in childhood. However, most people who have febrile seizures don’t develop TLE.\n\nHaving structural problems in your temporal lobe, such as a tumor or brain malformation.\n\nHaving a brain injury that happened early in life, including head trauma with loss of consciousness, brain infections (such as meningitis) or birth injury to your brain.\n\nHow common is temporal lobe epilepsy?\n\nTemporal lobe epilepsy is the most common seizure disorder, affecting about 50 million people worldwide. Temporal lobe epilepsy can account for about 40% of people with epilepsy seen in a busy epilepsy center.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of temporal lobe epilepsy?\n\nSymptoms depend on how your seizure begins.\n\nYou may have an aura before a temporal lobe seizure. An aura is an unusual sensation that you feel before a seizure starts. Not everyone experiences an aura. An aura is a part of a focal aware seizure, meaning you’re awake and aware while the symptoms occur. They typically last from a few seconds to two minutes.\n\nSensations you may feel during an aura include:\n\nDéjà vu (a feeling of familiarity), a memory or jamais vu (a feeling of unfamiliarity).\n\nA sudden sense of fear, panic or anxiety; anger, sadness or joy.\n\nA rising sick feeling in your stomach (the feeling you get in your gut riding a roller coaster).\n\nAltered sense of hearing, sight, smell, taste or touch.\n\nSometimes, temporal lobe seizures progress to another type of seizure, such as a focal impaired awareness seizure. During this seizure, you lose some degree of awareness for typically 30 seconds to 2 minutes.\n\nSymptoms of focal impaired awareness seizures include:\n\n“Staring into space” or a blank stare.\n\nRepetitive behaviors and movements (called automatisms) of your hands (such as fidgeting, picking motions), eyes (excessive blinking) and mouth (lip-smacking, chewing, swallowing).\n\nConfusion.\n\nUnusual speech; altered ability to respond and communicate with others.\n\nBrief loss of ability to speak, read or comprehend speech.\n\nIn rare cases, a temporal lobe seizure can develop into a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. During a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, there’s stiffening and shaking of your entire body with loss of awareness. Sometimes, there’s loss of bladder control or biting of your tongue with these seizures. This seizure affects both sides of your brain and is also called a convulsion. It used to be known as a grand mal seizure.\n\nWhat causes temporal lobe epilepsy?\n\nCauses of temporal lobe epilepsy include:\n\nUnknown causes (accounts for about 25% of temporal lobe seizures).\n\nInjury to brain cells, which results in scarring in the temporal lobe (called mesial temporal sclerosis or hippocampal sclerosis).\n\nBrain abnormalities present at the time of birth, including hamartomas and malformation of cortical development.\n\nBrain injury from such things as vehicular accidents, falls or any blow to the head.\n\nBrain infections, including brain abscess, meningitis, encephalitis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\nBrain conditions and brain vessel abnormalities, including brain tumors, strokes, dementia and abnormal blood vessels, such as arteriovenous malformations.\n\nGenetic factors (family history) or genetic mutations.\n\nWhat are the complications of having temporal lobe epilepsy?\n\nEpilepsy can be life-threatening in a couple of situations:\n\nSudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). About 1 in 1,000 people with epilepsy die each year from SUDEP. The cause isn’t known, but having a lot of seizures that are unable to be controlled increases the risk. It’s more common in adults than children.\n\nStatus epilepticus. This is a long-lasting (5 minutes up to 30 minutes) seizure or seizures that occur close together without recovery between them. It’s considered a medical emergency. Call 911 or get immediate medical care if this occurs.\n\nHow is temporal lobe epilepsy diagnosed?\n\nYour healthcare provider will ask questions about your medical history and your seizures — how long they lasted; what you felt before, during and after the seizure; where you were and what happened before the seizure started; and if something seemed to trigger the seizure (examples of triggers include stress, lack of sleep, flashing lights, intense exercise and loud music). Your healthcare provider might also want to talk to people who were with you during a seizure to gather their observations. It can be helpful to have someone videotape your seizure to show your healthcare provider and to keep a diary of when your seizures occur.\n\nWhat tests will be done?\n\nTests that are used in diagnosing temporal lobe epilepsy include:\n\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging): An MRI looks for tumors or other structural problems in your brain. A common finding is scar tissue in the hippocampus (hippocampal sclerosis). This appears as shrunken tissue on the MRI.\n\nEEG (electroencephalogram): An EEG measures the electric activity in your brain. Certain abnormal electrical patterns are related to seizures.\n\nVideo EEG: This is a longer version of the regular EEG. You’re admitted to the hospital for several days. Your antiseizure medications are stopped. This test captures your seizures on the EEG while the video captures your movements during the seizures. Together, the information helps identify where your seizures are starting and how they affect your functioning.\n\nSPECT: A single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) shows increased blood flow to the areas of your brain where the seizure begins.\n\nIctal SPECT: An ictal SPECT locates the area(s) of your brain where seizures are occurring.\n\nPET scan: A positive emission tomography (PET) scan looks at brain metabolism to identify where your seizures started.\n\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG): This test records and evaluates your brain while it’s actively functioning, pinpointing abnormal changes in your brain.\n\nStereoelectroencephalography (SEEG): This test involves placing electrodes at different depths in your brain in the area of interest to create a 3D view of the site of the seizure.\n\nNeuropsychological testing: Neuropsychological tests assess your verbal skills, memory function and other learning skills. This test serves as a baseline for measuring and comparing any changes before and after surgery.\n\nHow is temporal lobe epilepsy treated?\n\nTreatments for temporal lobe epilepsy include medications, diet, surgery, laser and electrical brain stimulator devices.\n\nMedications\n\nMany medications are available to treat temporal lobe seizures. Your healthcare provider might try one or more medications and different dosages over months to find the approach that’s best for you. Up to two-thirds of people with temporal lobe epilepsy have their seizures controlled with medications.\n\nBecause some antiseizure medications are linked to birth defects, let your healthcare provider know if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant.\n\nDiet\n\nAnother treatment approach is a very specific change in diet. The ketogenic diet is a diet high in fat and very low in carbohydrates. It’s sometimes tried if medications aren’t successful in controlling your seizures.\n\nSurgery\n\nSurgery is considered only after several attempts of medication have failed or a tumor or lesion responsible for the seizures has been identified. If an MRI shows hippocampal sclerosis in the medial temporal lobe and EEGs show seizure activity starts in that area, surgery may cure your seizures. Temporal lobectomy (removal of your temporal lobe) is the most common type of lobectomy and the most common surgery for epilepsy.\n\nLaser ablation\n\nIn this procedure, surgeons use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide the use of a laser. The laser is directed at scar tissue in the temporal lobe region that’s causing seizures. The laser uses heat to destroy the tissue that’s causing the seizures.\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery\n\nThis surgery involves using 3D computerized imaging and precisely focused radiation beams to destroy the nerve cells that are misfiring and causing the seizures.\n\nElectrical brain stimulators\n\nIf two or more medications have not adequately controlled seizures and surgery isn’t an option, another option is nerve stimulation devices. These devices work in much the same way as a heart pacemaker monitors and respond to abnormal heart rhythms. There are three types of stimulators.\n\nVagus nerve stimulator: This stimulator is implanted under the skin of your chest wall and electrical lead wires are placed around the vagus nerve in your neck. Your vagus nerve starts in the lower area of your brain and travels down to the abdomen. The stimulator delivers scheduled brief intermittent electrical bursts to the brain to reduce seizure development.\n\nResponsive neurostimulation device: This device monitors brain wave activity and delivers an electrical burst to stop or shorten a seizure or possibly prevent it from developing. This device is implanted in your skull under your scalp.\n\nDeep brain stimulation device: This surgery involves implanting an electrode into your brain and placing a stimulator device under your skin in your chest. The electrode wire, guided by MRI, is placed in an area of your brain where seizures are occurring. The stimulator device sends signals to the electrode to block signals from nerve cells that trigger a seizure.\n\nWhen should I see a doctor?\n\nIf you’ve had a seizure or think you might’ve had a seizure, you should see your healthcare provider. If you have already been diagnosed with temporal lobe seizures, call your healthcare provider or seizure specialist if:\n\nYour seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.\n\nA second seizure immediately follows the first.\n\nThe number and severity of your seizures increase.\n\nYou experience new symptoms.\n\nYou develop a blistering skin rash or other new side effects.\n\nYour recovery after your seizure is slower than usual or not complete.\n\nWhat should I do if I’m with somebody who is having a seizure?\n\nStay with the person who is having the seizure and pay attention to exactly what is happening and how long it lasts. Don’t hold the person down, but try to keep them away from dangerous situations and move nearby objects out of the way. Speak calmly to the person who is having the seizure, during the seizure and afterward. Don’t put anything in their mouth. Do what you can to keep the person comfortable, during and after the seizure.\n\nCall 911 if the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes — or, if you’re familiar with the person’s seizure history, if the seizure lasts significantly longer than usual. If you think it’s their first seizure, call 911. Also call 911 if the person has another seizure right after the first one ends, is injured during the seizure, is having trouble breathing or asks you to get medical help.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nIf you have temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), becoming seizure-free is the goal. Seeing your healthcare provider at the first sign of seizures leads to early diagnosis, treatment and the best outcomes. Medications control seizures in most people with TLE. If you have mesial TLE, 75% of people become seizure-free after surgery. The key to the successful management of TLE is great communication between you and your healthcare provider. Make sure you understand all the benefits and risks of all your treatment options, the complications of uncontrolled seizures and possible adverse effects of medications. Ask your healthcare provider about support groups, too."
