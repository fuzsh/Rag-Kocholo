        "text": "The Horizon 2045 Foresight Radar is an interactive tool for exploring pivotal issues and drivers of change shaping human and planetary security. It features a unique collection of over 500 signals of change and three divergent scenarios of the world in 2045.\n\nOver the last year and as part of the Horizon 2045 project, N Square developed an innovative foresight process for exploring ways in which the confluence of threats we face might reshape systems of human and planetary security. The process began with an international horizon scanning network identifying dynamics of change in human and planetary systems, social values and attitudes, governance structures, technology, and the rule of law that are shaping the future of security. In collaboration with the School of International Futures, N Square designed a participatory foresight process that leveraged the diverse expertise of a global networks to identify the dynamics emerging at the intersection of a variety of complex threats and explored their implications. The insights generated through this process culminated in the creation of a set of scenarios authored by futurist Jamais Cascio. The scenarios can help leaders and changemakers better imagine future opportunities and risks, and develop robust strategies to secure the long-term future in the face of uncertainty."
