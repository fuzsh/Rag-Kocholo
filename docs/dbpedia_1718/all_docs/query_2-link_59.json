Oh well, I never\n\nJamais\n\nSo just what is real and just what is fake?\n\nWell in life you never get to do a second take\n\nJamais\n\nNever even scratched the surface\n\nThough you're picking through my bones\n\nThough the names and dates are altered\n\nThe story's still my own\n\nThe performance of a lifetime\n\nMy only starring role"
