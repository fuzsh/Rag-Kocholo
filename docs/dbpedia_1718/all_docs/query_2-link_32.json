        "text": "The song \"Jamais\" by Steve Beezy is a heartfelt confession of love and commitment to a perfect girl. The lyrics express the desire to talk on the phone into the early hours of the morning, walk in public hand in hand, and eventually get married. The singer emphasizes that without this girl, he would never experience these moments of love and connection. Throughout the song, there is a sense of urgency and longing for the girl, with the refrain repeating \"Without you, never.\" The bridge amplifies this sentiment with the repeated chants of \"Jamais\" (Never) to emphasize the importance of the girl in the singer's life. The bridge also includes references to different locations, such as Burundi, Limoilou, Quebec, and Canada, possibly highlighting the global nature of love and the singer's willingness to go to great lengths for this girl. Overall, the song \"Jamais\" conveys a message of deep love and dedication to a special person, with the singer expressing a willingness to do whatever it takes to be with them."
