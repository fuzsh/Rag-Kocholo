        "text": "The track \"N'oubliez Jamais\" is a new single and music video by Đorđe Maraš, who uses his last name as a pseudonym. According to the musician, the song has a typical trap soul, somewhat dark, sensual, and enticing sound, which, he says, his audience is used to.\n\nThe Montenegrin musician, who has lived in Belgrade for many years, did not work independently on the song this time, as was the case until now. Kaufmann and Habibo were also authors of the track, who adapted their creative abilities to the style and direction that Maraš is building.\n\nThe instrumental was handled by Wizard, behind the pseudonym Kemal Čuljević, who has so far collaborated with some of the biggest regional stars of this music, mostly referring to the scene in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Dragan Ponjević - Ponk made an effort to pack all that into one compact whole, whose ear Maraš unwaveringly trusts from the start, when it comes to mixing and mastering.\n\nThe video was in charge, as Maraš says, of a proven team under the baton of Branislav Pećaranin, who has been at the very top of Serbian and regional video production for several decades, and editing is done by David Dakić.\n\n\"Although in the text, with the mother tongue, French and English are partially mixed, so it all seems to acquire a deeper note, in fact the story is relatively simple. The mental struggle of a young man, in the wee hours. On the one hand, he wants that certain person now and right in front of him, while on the other hand he despises it because of that momentary inaccessibility. The spot has its two halves, which are two parallel universes. It is up to the audience to judge what is reality and what is fiction. As for the sound, because and some of his eccentricity and so-called 'moody' vibe, I believe that he will be a good companion in the car, not to mention in all moments after midnight\", Maraš is sure."
