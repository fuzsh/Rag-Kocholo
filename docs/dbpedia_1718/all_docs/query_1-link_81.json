        "text": "Population projections 90 years out – even 40 years out – are risky. There are big challenges to human civilization already under way this century, such as climate disruption and food sustainability, and more on the horizon. If any of them hit as hard as we fear, or if our responses are insufficient, there’s little likelihood that Earth’s population would get to 10 billion people. In a way, getting there would be a sign of successful navigation of this century’s problems.\n\nSuch a level of population is itself a challenge, but positive scenarios are possible. They all require a fundamental shift in resource use, changes to our behavior, and the thoughtful application of emerging technologies.\n\nFor example, modern agriculture would be unable to support 10 billion people with a Western diet; conversely, a primarily vegetarian diet, with meat protein coming from “cultured meat” producers, would be fine. Ten billion people with post-industrial world consumption habits would overwhelm resource supplies and waste streams; conversely, production economies using cradle-to-cradle design or (in the longer term) molecular fabrication technologies would make the very concept of “waste” a thing of the past.\n\nMost notably, a planet of 10 billion people all wanting a Western standard of living would require at least an order-of-magnitude more energy. There’s no way to provide that energy without causing massive environmental damage.\n\nBut according to Dr. Art Rosenfeld, formerly of the California Energy Commission, a moderate but sustained increase in how efficiently we use energy would, over time, have an enormous impact. By focusing on efficiency, we could at the end of this century support 10 billion people at a universally high standard of living for less energy than we use today.\n\nA 10 billion-human planet worth living on is possible – but only if we think ahead."
