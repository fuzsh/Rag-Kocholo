        "meta_description": "Listen to Presque vu and Jamais vu from Getting Emotional. You hear 'vu', you think of 'déjà', right? Yeah, fair enough, most people do. But did you know that déjà has two siblings, often overlooked? I'm talking about presque and jamais, and I'd argue they bring just as much to the table as their big sister does. The Vus (I like to think of them as a girl band, by the way) comprise of three states of mind, all pretty common, but one just more famous than the others. Déjà, as you may already know, roughly means 'already seen'- but what of the two others? Well, presque is known as 'almost seen' and jamais, 'never seen'. Between them they're equally frustrating, and very common. So let's find out a little about them! Have you ever felt something on the 'tip of your tongue'? Then you've felt presque vu! And ever not recongnised something you probably should? Then jamais vu is your jam! Of course, I'll go into a little more detail in the episode. Plus, I manage to squeeze in references to The Matrix, Bridget Jones, Beyonce, BTS and Atomic Kitten. Never say I don't have my finger on the pulse. Also, you may notice there's no guest for this one. Every now and again a feeling that comes along that is...unguestable. I have a list of these emotions, willing to be made into shows, but sadly uncoupled with people to talk about them. So instead I brought in some old friends to provide a bit of context. Wonderful Guy Kelly (@brainmage) discusses his dealings with déjà, and Richard Soames (@RichardSoames) and Benedict Salter help me out with their acting skills.",
