        "text": "Overall, the new BTS tracklist was exciting to come across.\n\nExcept,we couldn't really understand some of the song titles. Like \"Jamais Vu\" and \"Dionysus\". I decided I would search high and low for the meanings to the song titles. Some of the stuff I found was really interesting, and could even contribute to the meaning of the storyline.\n\nWe all know that the first Map Of The Soul trailer was very similar to the Skool Luv Affair era. This first discovery could be hinting to that.\n\n\"Jamais Vu\" is a French term that can be simplified to the reverse version of \"Deja Vu\" Deja Vu is when you feel as if you had already experienced something, yet, you never have. You're completely familiar with it though.\n\nJamais Vu is when you have experienced something many times, or even just twice, and you're completely unfamiliar with the feeling.\n\nOf course, this could just be a song title. Yet, the fans always like to take it next level. The theory is that this links to the Skool Luv Affair era.\n\nThe next song title is interesting although it isn't French. It's actually Greek.\n\nIt turns out Dionysus was the son of Zeus. Which if you can't tell already, is Greek Mythology.\n\nNow the description of Dionysus varies from source to source. The I found interesting was:\n\n\"He was one of the twelve Olympians, although he was the last to arrive, and his unusual birth and upbringing marked him as an outsider. This was an inherent part of his cult, which often focused on the more subversive elements of his nature. Dionysus was often called Eleutherios, meaning 'the liberator,' because his wine, music, and ecstatic dance freed his followers from self-consciousness and the restraints of society. Earlier images and descriptions of Dionysus depict him as a mature male, bearded and robed holding a fennel staff tipped with a pine-cone. However, in later images the god is shown to be a beardless, sensuous, naked or semi-naked androgynous youth.\"\n\nA source told me he is the god of transgender, yet, I easily learned that wasn't true.\n\nBTS were holding grapes in their photo shoot because, the god is depicted with wine.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nThis album seems to be a very LGBTQ open album. They are even working with an openly bisexual artist (Halsey).\n\nCan we expect more details like this in the songs? Not sure?"
