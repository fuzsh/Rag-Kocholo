        "text": "BTS's song 'Jamais Vu' delves into the theme of failure and the desire for redemption. The lyrics express a sense of defeat and the frustration that comes with it, as if losing in a game. The repeated references to a 'game' suggest life's challenges and the feeling of being stuck in a cycle of trial and error. The phrase 'game over' symbolizes a moment of failure, yet the song's protagonist wishes life could be as simple as restarting a game with a 'load' button. However, they acknowledge the need to face the 'real world' where consequences are more permanent and solutions are not as straightforward.\n\nThe chorus, 'Please give me a remedy,' is a plea for healing and a second chance. The 'remedy' represents a cure for the pain and a way to restart the 'stopped heart.' The song conveys a deep sense of vulnerability and the need for comfort, which the artists seek through their music. The 'melody' and 'memory' mentioned in the lyrics suggest that music and the memories associated with it can be a form of healing. Despite the pain and the fear of making mistakes, the song ends on a hopeful note with the line 'I won’t give up,' indicating resilience and the determination to overcome adversity.\n\nBTS is known for their emotionally charged lyrics and their ability to connect with listeners through themes of mental health, self-acceptance, and personal growth. 'Jamais Vu' is no exception, as it touches on the universal experience of facing setbacks and the human desire for healing and redemption. The song's title, 'Jamais Vu,' is a French term that means 'never seen,' which is the opposite of 'déjà vu.' It can be interpreted as the feeling of experiencing something for the first time, despite it being familiar, which aligns with the song's message of recurring pain that feels new each time."
