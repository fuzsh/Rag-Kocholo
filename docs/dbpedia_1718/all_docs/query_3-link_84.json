        "text": "The Belgian icon is setting out to conquer Italy! This Friday, March 8, Ang√®le reveals herself featuring the Italian star Mahmood through a new single ‚ÄúSempre / Jamais‚Äù.\n\nAfter a few months of break, the star of the Nonante- cinq Tour returns with an unexpected featuring. In collaboration with the Italian artist Mahmood, Ang√®le continues to surprise us. The 28-year-old singer switches from Italian to the language of Moli√®re in this new hit entitled ‚ÄúSempre / Jamais‚Äù. ‚Äú It was very instinctive, very fluid. We started with the chorus melody, a synth riff. Ang√®le contributed with part of the lyrics in French ¬ª, Explains the producer of the track, Dardust, to 20 minutes.\n\nAccording to the latter, the song was born two years ago during a working session with Mahmood: ‚Äú We wrote the text together ‚Äú. Ang√®le and the ‚ÄúSoldi‚Äù singer then recorded the title in Paris. ‚Äú I like (Ang√®le‚Äôs) work on 1980s-derived electropop that mixes with more Latin influences. She wrote incredible songs. She is a versatile artist, I like that a lot ‚Äú, he stressed.\n\nAng√®le sets off to conquer Italy\n\nWith this duo, Ang√®le continues to export herself beyond French-speaking borders. After his featuring with Dua Lipa who took him to the United States and the legendary Coachella stage, the young Belgian artist is trying to convince a new audience, that of Italy.\n\n‚Äú Guys, can we say that ‚ÄòSempre / Jamais‚Äô is truly amazing?! üî• ¬ª, Comments a fan of Mahmood on Instagram after the revelation of his tracklist complete regarding his latest album ‚Äú Nei letti degli altri ¬ª (‚Äú In other people‚Äôs beds ‚Äú).\n\nAng√®le at the Olympia?\n\nOn April 8, the artist who defended Italy at Eurovision in 2019 will perform on the Parisian stage of the Olympia. So will Ang√®le be there to defend this new duo? We hope so!"
