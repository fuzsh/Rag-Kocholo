        "text": "On the (27 hour) plane ride back from New Zealand, I watched a lot of movies, some unremarkable – some wonderful. Watching Happy-Go-Lucky was painful for some reasons, and beautiful for others – but it definately hit me with the pink laserbeam between the eyes.\n\nWatching classics like The Apartment and Manhattan made me wonder at the romances we’d write about some cities, and Slumdog Millionaire bizarrely seemed like a continuation of that: a romance of the maximum-city.\n\nBut, beside that – everytime a movie finished, the entertainment system reset to it’s main menu, with one of those airline entertainment system pseudo-radio stations playing on a loop.\n\nAnd I hit the same point in the loop everytime.\n\nAnd at that point in the loop played the same song everytime.\n\nThe song was a romance of the city.\n\nA romance of electricity and colour and life and density of opportunity.\n\nElectricity so fine Look and dry your eyes\n\nThe song was “Stepping Out” by Joe Jackson.\n\nGo and listen.\n\nWatch.\n\nI’ll stay put.\n\nIn recent months I’ve definitely fallen into a Collapsitarian rut of sorts.\n\nWe - Are young but getting old before our time\n\nThis won’t do.\n\nAs Jamais Cascio says, quoting Evelin Lindner:\n\n“Pessimism is a luxury of good times. In difficult times, pessimism is a\n\nself-fulfilling, self-inflicted death sentence.”\n\nThe wave of stuff coming down the lightcone is for sure a Danmaku-like bullet-curtain of environmental, societal and technical challenges, but I like Danmaku!\n\nThat’s where the action is, where the flow is felt, and where design wrangling of the sweetest kind can be done.\n\nSo, more wrangling, less hand-wringing.\n\nBig bets should be made.\n\nHappy-gets-lucky!\n\nIt took at 27 hour flight to realise that 27 years ago in 1982, Joe Jackson knew this and planted a time capsule into culture to help me with 2009.\n\nIt’s The Anti-Collapsitarian Anthem.\n\nWe - So tired of all the darkness in our lives With no more angry words to say Can come alive Get into a car and drive To the other side\n\nThat’s some foresight, right there. So if you are feeling a little collapsitarian, try stepping out.\n\nYou - Can dress in pink and blue just like a child And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile We’ll be there in just a while If you follow me\n\nThanks Joe."
