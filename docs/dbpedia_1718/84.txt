The song 'Sempre / Jamais' by Mahmood featuring Angèle is a poignant exploration of the complexities of a past relationship and the lingering feelings that remain. The title itself, which translates to 'Always / Never' from Italian and French respectively, encapsulates the song's central theme of the push and pull between holding on and letting go. The lyrics oscillate between the desire to remain connected ('Sempre') and the need to forget and move on ('Jamais'), highlighting the internal conflict that often accompanies the aftermath of a romantic relationship.

The verses of the song are filled with vivid imagery and metaphors that convey a deep sense of nostalgia and yearning. References to wearing the other person's necklace and the scent of their body lingering on one's fingers evoke a sensory memory that is hard to shake off. The mention of a jet ski and the feeling of being better than Nirvana suggest moments of intense happiness and connection that the narrator misses. The song also touches on the idea of forbidden love, with lines like 'Anche se è illegale, pensami' ('Even if it's illegal, think of me'), adding a layer of complexity and perhaps a hint of danger to the relationship.

The collaboration between Mahmood, an Italian singer-songwriter known for his eclectic mix of pop, R&B, and electronic music, and Angèle, a Belgian pop singer, brings a blend of languages and cultural influences that enrich the song's emotional depth. The bilingual aspect of the song, with Italian and French lyrics, may also symbolize the merging of two worlds or perspectives, much like the merging of past and present emotions in the narrative of the song. 'Sempre / Jamais' is a musical embodiment of the struggle between holding onto cherished memories and the necessity of moving forward.
