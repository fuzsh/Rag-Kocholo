À Tout Jamais (Meaning: Forever; Pronunciation a tu ʒamɛ) is a hit song by French-Canadian singer Mylène Farmer. Released in August, 2022, the song was made for the album L’Emprise.

À Tout Jamais song overview

In the song, À Tout Jamais, Farmer expresses that she’s no longer afraid of a démon (demon) that she likens to anthrax dust which enters her wounds and consumes her life.

Famer tells the demon “f*ck you too”, telling it to go to back to hell and that it no longer has a hold on her and that she’s no longer afraid.

We believe this so-called “demon” may be a metaphor any sort of negative feeling, occurrence or even person in life. The “demon” could also be a metaphor for an addictive substance that’s no longer being consumed.

In the following section we’ve hand-selected lines of interest which we feel offer interesting insights into learning French vocabulary and grammar.

Tout, N’est qu’un jeu de masques

À tout jamais

The line “À tout jamais“, which is also the song title, is a French expression which means forever and literally means “to all never”.

Requiem pour tout recommencer

Quand tout est mensonges, Qu’ils blessent et me rongent

These two lines translate to “When everything is lies, That hurt and eat away at me”. Quand means when in French. Mensonge is the noun for lie while the verb mentir means to lie.

Tout

Souffle le chaud, le froid

Qui d’autre que moi le voit?

Consumes our lives

Blowing the the hot, the cold

Who other then myself sees him?

Whichever life teaches me
