        "text": "Shopping Guides\n\nMovies\n\nPublished on Friday, 31 March 2023 16:00\n\nLast Updated on 02 April 2023\n\nranjeetpanesar\n\nLondon Mums Magazine‘s reporters were invited to a special screening of Air, a new Warner Bros. Production starring Matt Damon and Ben Affleck at the Vue Cinema in Leicester Square. Air runs into cinemas on 5th April 2023.\n\nThe trailer\n\nThe story\n\nFrom award-winning director Ben Affleck, AIR reveals the unbelievable game-changing partnership between a then rookie Michael Jordan and Nike’s fledgling basketball division which revolutionised the world of sports and contemporary culture with the Air Jordan brand. This moving story follows the career-defining gamble of an unconventional team with everything on the line, the uncompromising vision of a mother who knows the worth of her son’s immense talent, and the basketball phenom who would become the greatest of all time..\n\nThe verdict\n\nIn 1984, Converse and Adidas dominated the world of basketball, where Nike struggled to make an impact. That is, until Sonny Vaccaro played by (Matt Damon) had an idea, to sign up just one player, Michael Jordan an up and coming basketball megastar.\n\nAir is the kind of feel good inspirational movie that brings together the wining ingredients of a world brand, the deal and an up and coming athlete in an era defining way. It recounts the beginning of the big time sports sponsorship with the story of Nike’s Air Jordan shoe.\n\nThe movie is grounded by a calm yet convincing performance from lead Matt Damon who risks it all to achieve the extraordinary – to sign up the next huge star and create an iconic synergy between product and name.\n\nThe clothes, music and cars of this film show the mid ‘80s in all their glory, with the shoe itself centre stage – a must-have status symbol, which it remains to this day.\n\nMy one criticism would be that Michael Jordan should have had more dialogue, given that the movie was based around him signing the contract with Nike. He is present throughout the movie but never do you see his face or hear him speak – an interesting take on the role of the athlete in those times. His mother is the lead, pushing the deal forward in a ground breaking way and the rest of the story is history.\n\nA very enjoyable and inspirational watch even for the non-basketball fans.\n\nLondon Mums’ rating\n\nWe gave Air a collective 7/10, an easy watch with comedy elements and a feel good factor."
