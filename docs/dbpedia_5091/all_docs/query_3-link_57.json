        "text": "Matt Damon and Ben Affleck’s film, ‘Air’, will hit theaters on April 5, but it isn’t the first time the duo have worked together.\n\nThe two best friends have accomplished big things over the years, as they’ve gone from small time actors to two of the biggest stars in Hollywood.\n\nWhile most of the films they’ve worked on together have been huge hits, some may have fallen under the radar.\n\nHere’s a look at all the movies Damon and Affleck have worked together on over the years.\n\nField of Dreams - 1989\n\nA movie that explores family, baseball, tradition and willpower, ‘Field of Dreams’ was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.\n\nThe movie is an inspirational film for the ages, but you likely won’t ever see Damon or Affleck in the film.\n\nThat’s because both actors are spectators during the game at Fenway Park that Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones’ characters attend.\n\nIt turns out that Damon and Affleck agreed to be extras in the film in order to visit the famous ballpark.\n\nSchool Ties - 1992\n\nIn what was Damon’s second film and Affleck’s fourth, this is the movie that started to give the duo recognition in Hollywood.\n\nThe movie takes place in a 1950′s Jewish preparatory school and follows a group of students as they deal with big issues like antisemitism and prejudice.\n\nAlong with Damon and Affleck, the film also stars Chris O’Donnell, Anthony Rapp and recent Academy Award-winner Brendan Fraser.\n\nGood Will Hunting - 1997\n\nThe movie that is most often associated with the duo, ‘Good Will Hunting’ follows Will (Damon), a genius who works as a janitor.\n\nThe film is considered a modern classic, winning an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nFilled with memorable quotes and an eye-catching performance from the late Robin Williams, the film cemented Damon and Affleck as two big names in the film industry.\n\nChasing Amy - 1997\n\nAn unconventional romantic comedy, the movie is about Holden (Affleck), a comic book artist who falls in love with a lesbian woman (Joey Lauren Adams).\n\nAlthough Affleck plays a big role in the film, Damon only shows up for one brief scene in what feels like a winking joke to the audience, much like his appearance in ‘Thor: Ragnarok’.\n\nDogma - 1999\n\nA satirical film about a Catholic woman (Linda Fiorentino) struggling with her faith, she is later sent on a mission to stop two fallen angels, played by Damon and Affleck, from entering Heaven and ending all existence.\n\nDamon and Affleck show they have chemistry to spare as they play Loki and Bartleby in a film that made $44 million at the box office.\n\nJay and Silent Bob Strike Back - 2000\n\nJay and Silent Bob finally get the spotlight after appearing in four movies as side characters in this 2000 film.\n\nAffleck reprises his role as Holden in this film, though it’s also a fictionalized version of himself.\n\nHe is joined by Damon as the duo film a scene for the violent and fictional sequel to ‘Good Will Hunting’, ‘Goodwill Hunting 2: Hunting Season’, in what is a spoof of the movie-making process.\n\nJay and Silent Bob Reboot - 2019\n\nWhile Affleck once again reprises his role as Holden from ‘Chasing Amy’ in what is an integral scene, Damon returns as Loki from ‘Dogma’ in what is a brief cameo.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reaction, though fans were excited to see the return of so many reoccurring characters from Kevin Smith’s previous works.\n\nThe Last Duel - 2021\n\nBased on true events, ‘The Last Duel’ received positive reviews from critics despite performing poorly at the worldwide box office.\n\nDamon and Affleck wrote the screenplay, along with Nicole Holofcener. It was the first time they had written together since ‘Good Will Hunting’."
