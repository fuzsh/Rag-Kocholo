        "text": "Matt Damon is partnering up with Affleck once again — no, not Ben.\n\nThis time, it’s Ben’s younger brother Casey Affleck who co-stars in “The Instigators,” which he also co-wrote with Chuck MacLean. Affleck stars as Cobby, an ex-con who has to work with his ex-military, currently-desperate father Rory (Damon) to rob a corrupt politician’s ill-gained earnings. But when the heist goes wrong, the two find themselves engulfed in a whirlwind of chaos, pursued not only by police but also by backward bureaucrats and vengeful crime bosses. Completely out of their depth, they convince Rory’s therapist (Hong Chau) to join their riotous getaway through the city, where they must put aside their differences and work together to evade capture — or worse.\n\nMichael Stuhlbarg, Paul Walter Hauser, Ving Rhames, Alfred Molina, and Toby Jones co-star, with singer Jack Harlow and Ron Perlman also appearing.\n\n“Road House” (2024) director Doug Liman directs the Apple Original film. The feature hails from Ben Affleck and Damon’s Artist Equity production banner. Both Damon and Ben Affleck produce, along with Jeff Robinov, John Graham, Kevin J. Walsh, and Alison Winter.\n\nCelia Costas, Dani Bernfeld, Kevin Halloran, Michael Joe, Cynthia Dahlgren, and Damon’s wife Luciana Damon serve as executive producers. It’s a real family affair.\n\nLike Liman’s other 2024 release “Road House,” “The Instigators” is solely getting a streaming debut and will not screen theatrically. There is no word yet if Liman will return to direct the “Road House” sequel that has Jake Gyllenhaal reprising his role.\n\nAnd for those Damon-Affleck shippers, don’t worry, there will be more Matt and Ben onscreen soon. Ben Affleck will be directing Damon once more after “Air” for upcoming Netflix noir film “Animals.” The thriller centers around a mayoral candidate whose son is kidnapped. The candidate and his wife opt to find out the truth for themselves.\n\nDamon previously said of his “Air” director Affleck that it was a “natural progression” to be directed by him.\n\n“We’ve written a bunch of movies and produced and acted together for so many years and decades, so it didn’t feel any different, working this way,” Damon said. “I mean, we did high school plays where he was like, ‘Dude, I think you should do it like this.’ He’s been directing me for like forty-something years.”\n\n“The Instigators” premieres August 9 on Apple TV+. Check out the trailer below."
