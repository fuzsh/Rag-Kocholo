        "text": "Matt Damon and Casey Affleck team up to rob a corrupt politician in \"The Instigators,\" a new movie filmed in Boston.\n\nThe first trailer for “The Instigators” hit the internet Thursday morning, giving audiences a sneak peek at the upcoming Matt Damon and Casey Affleck movie filmed in Boston last year.\n\nBeyond revealing new details about the film’s plot, the trailer released by Apple shows that “The Instigators,” initially billed as a crime thriller, has a lot more comedic elements than previously anticipated.\n\nWatch the trailer for “The Instigators”\n\nWhat is the plot of “The Instigators”?\n\nDamon and Affleck play two Boston-area dads from different backgrounds. Damon’s Rory is a former Marine facing financial and familial troubles who has always done things by the book, while Affleck’s Cobby is a career criminal who is rough around the edges. (In one scene, we see Cobby’s son blow into a breathalyzer so Cobby can use his motorcycle.)\n\nThe duo are brought together for a robbery planned by Scalvo (Jack Harlow, “White Men Can’t Jump”) and Mr. Besegai (Michael Stuhlbarg, “A Serious Man”), in which they rip off “ill-gained earnings” funding the corrupt Mayor of Boston (Ron Perlman, “Hellboy”).\n\nAfter watching Rory take notes while they discuss logistics, Cobby is clearly unimpressed.\n\n“A little late for a career change, ain’t it?” Affleck asks Damon. “What are you, 60?”\n\nAfter the heist goes awry, Rory and Cobby are pursued by multiple police departments, fixers associated with the mayor, and “vengeful crime bosses.”\n\nIn an attempt to execute a clean getaway, Rory convinces his therapist (Hong Chau, “The Whale”) to pose as his hostage.\n\nWhere was “The Instigators” filmed?\n\n“The Instigators” was filmed primarily in Boston, Cambridge, and Quincy in the early and later months of 2023, with a break in the middle of the year that coincided with the dual WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\n\nEarly in the trailer, Damon walks along the warning track at Fenway Park before descending into the depths of the ballpark with Harlow.\n\nDamon and Affleck also have a conversation filmed at Wollaston Beach in Quincy, where crews filmed near the Squantum Yacht Club in May 2023. (The film actually used the working title “Quincy” during production.)\n\nBeyond Boston, Cambridge, and Quincy, you can also see Damon sitting in a car outside Larsen Skating Rink in Winthrop at around the 14-second mark in the trailer.\n\nLater, a Boston police officer played by Ving Rhames (“Mission: Impossible”) can be seen entering Bova’s Bakery in the North End.\n\nBova’s owner Ralph Bova told The Boston Globe that the bakery was used in a scene where Rhames demands answers about the robbery.\n\n“He starts smashing all the showcases and food until someone talks, and no one says anything,” Bova said. “They’re taking all my showcases out, and they’re putting in their prop showcases, but they still want my food.”\n\nDirector Doug Liman (“The Bourne Identity”) and producer Kevin Walsh pulled out all the stops for “The Instigators,” filming a shootout outside Boston City Hall, and a chase scene that takes Damon, Affleck, and Chau from the Back Bay to the Esplanade to the river roads.\n\n“We did a stunt that’s along the Esplanade that runs along the Charles River, which they’ve never shut down,” Walsh told the AP. “We did some stuff that you’ll never see in other films. It was challenging but really cool.”\n\n“The Instigators” cast\n\nAlong with the previously mentioned actors (Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Hon Chau, Jack Harlow, Ron Perlman, Ving Rhames, Michael Stuhlbarg), “The Instigators” also features Paul Walter Hauser (“Black Bird”), Alfred Molina (“Spider-Man 2”), and Toby Jones (“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny”).\n\nDirected by Liman and written by Quincy native Chuck MacLean (“City on a Hill”), “The Instigators” was produced by Damon and Ben Affleck’s new studio, Artists Equity."
