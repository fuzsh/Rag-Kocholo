        "text": "The Legend of Bagger Vance (126 mins, PG) Directed by Robert Redford; starring Will Smith, Matt Damon, Charlize Theron\n\nFinding Forrester (136 mins, 12) Directed by Gus Van Sant; starring Sean Connery, Rob Brown, F. Murray Abraham, Anna Paquin\n\nThe Invisible Circus (98 mins, 15) Directed by Adam Brooks; starring Cameron Diaz, Christopher Eccleston, Jordana Brewster\n\nBoth of this week's big-budget Hollywood movies turn upon young blacks assisting in the redemption of reclusive, once celebrated middle-class whites who have lost their sense of purpose and direction. What this tells you about present-day America is hard to say, though significantly, for all the positive thinking they represent, neither has attracted a single Oscar nomination or done well at the box office.\n\nRobert Redford's The Legend of Bagger Vance is set in the Deep South at the time when the Ku Klux Klan was burning crosses with impunity and a decade before Hollywood happily acquiesced when the world premiere of Gone with the Wind took place in Atlanta before an all-white audience from which the black actors were excluded. But the film's Deep South, despite it being 1930 with the Depression setting in, is that old melon-eating, magnolia-sniffing world where a blacked-up Al Jolson waited for Robert E. Lee, not the land of lynch mobs where, with the participation of the American Medical Association, syphilitic blacks were given placebos so that white doctors could study the progress of the disease.\n\nThe movie is narrated by the 82-year-old golf pro Hardy Greaves (an uncredited Jack Lemmon) who looks back to his golded-hued youth in Georgia when golf was his religion and his great hero the patrician local star Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon). A pre-First World War champion, Junuh's been living in boozy seclusion for 12 years since his traumatic experiences as an infantry officer in France. Proud Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) has a problem - her rich daddy embarked on building a great golf links course at Savannah, Georgia, before the Depression hit and then committed suicide. To preserve the family honour, she refuses to sell up and decides to risk all on a grand opening with a $10,000 exhibition match between America's two greatest golfers, Georgia's own scholarly Bobby Jones and the swaggering, womanising Walter Hagen. Both men respond to the irresistible siren peals of this Southern belle, but a local contestant is needed and the 11-year-old Hardy suggests that Rannulph Junuh is the man. The problem is - how to lure him back to the links after a dozen years away?\n\nWell, before you can say caddie shack or Uncle Tom's Cabin, a handsome, smooth-talking young black called Bagger Vance (Will Smith) strolls out of the dark knowing all about Junuh, golf and life. Maybe things were different back in 1930 when blacks in Georgia didn't dare roam at night on whitey's side of the tracks, or work as a caddie or talk out of line. But movie audiences will twig him for what he is - an angel who knows all the greens and bunkers of life. 'You lost your swing, you got to go find it,' he tells Junuh, and soon our hero is on his way to salvation and victory, as well as a reunion with Adele, who just happens to be his pre-war lover who's been keeping herself for him ever since.\n\nBack in 1984, Redford appeared in The Natural, a complex film of transgression and redemption based on Bernard Malamud's fictional reworking of the Arthurian legend in the world of professional baseball. It was magical and uplifting, two qualities quite lacking in the flat, dispiriting Bagger Vance, though all too clearly what we're supposed to be watching is the story of life itself. The angelic Vance is full of stoical and Zen-like platitudes about golf - 'a game that can't be won, only played', 'the point when everything becomes one' etc. The most memorably awful line, however, is given to golfing star Bobby Jones. Hearing that young Hardy is ashamed of his dad who, refusing to go bankrupt after his store failed, chooses to work as a street-cleaner to pay off his debts, Jones says earnestly: 'Your dad stared adversity in the eyes, Hardy. He beat it back with a broom.'\n\nThe black redeemer in Gus Van Sant's Finding Forrester is the handsome 16-year-old Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown), a brilliant autodidact and basketball star from a housing project in the Bronx who accidentally stumbles into the Salinger-like hermitage of the 70-year-old William Forrester (Sean Connery) Literary abstinence in the movies is regarded as a badge of heroic integrity, and Forrester hasn't published a book since his legendary first novel, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Avalon Landing, apparently because he thought he'd exploited his war veteran brother (another echo of Bagger Vance). Their meeting comes just as Jamal has been snapped up by an exclusive preparatory school in Manhattan where he's befriended by a pretty upper-class girl (Anna Paquin) and becomes the target of an envious teacher, the failed writer Robert Crawford (F. Murray Abraham).\n\nYou may have recognised the resem blance of this plot to that of Good Will Hunting. Gus Van Sant clearly did, for he pays homage to his earlier film by giving its star and author Matt Damon a walk-on role as Forrester's lawyer. The movie is a contrived, smug affair, infinitely inferior to Wonder Boys, which touches on similar literary themes. But if it has a plus it's that, despite the waffle he's given to speak (eg 'You write your first draft from the heart, you re-write with your mind'), Connery can never appear as sentimental or foolish as Robin Williams. Among much that's silly about the literary life in this film is a page from a 1960 New Yorker bearing the title of an article by Forrester, with his name and portrait - New Yorker pieces are never accompanied by pictures of their authors, and until the coming of Tina Brown, the writer's name always appeared at the end."
