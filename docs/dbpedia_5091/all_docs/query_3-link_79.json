        "text": "\"The Instigators\" opens in early August and with its premiere comes one Louisville “First Class” hitmaker's second acting role in a feature film.\n\n\"The Investigators\" stars Academy Award winners Matt Damon and Casey Affleck and Louisville \"Hometown Hero\" Jack Harlow.\n\nYou may remember the Grammy-nominated hip hop artist launched his acting career with the 2023 remake of \"White Men Can't Jump,\" where he played Jeremy, a basketball hustler. That film's release came during a busy time for Harlow, just after the release of his second studio album, \"Come Home The Kids Miss You,\" in 2022.\n\n\"I had just dropped an album and I was in the whirlwind of the music industry,\" Harlow previously told the Courier Journal. \"And the way the schedule was set up, as soon as the album came out, I was to come out here and shoot this. So, it was such a beautiful escape from kinda the place I was in. And I really think I needed it mentally and emotionally just to get out of the monotony of music.\"\n\nIn reality, Harlow was already back to the business of making music. One month before the release of \"White Men Can't Jump\" in May 2023, Harlow surprised fans with \"Jackman,\" his third studio album.\n\nHarlow spoke about his pivot to acting in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying it was an art he always considered exploring.\n\n“It was in the back of my head as a possibility,” explained the six-time Grammy nominee. “People always thought I had some sort of chops for pretending, for better or worse. So I’m going to keep doing this. We’ll see what happens.”\n\n\"The Instigators\" is what happened. The crime comedy follows Rory (Damon) and Cobby (Affleck) who play a desperate father and an ex-con thrown together to rob a corrupt politician’s ill-gained earnings. But when the heist goes wrong, the two find themselves engulfed in a whirlwind of chaos, pursued not only by the police but also by backward bureaucrats and vengeful crime bosses. Completely out of their depth, they convince Rory’s therapist (Hong Chau) to join their riotous getaway through the city, where they must put aside their differences and work together to evade capture — or worse.\n\n\"The Instigators\" also stars Ving Rhames, Alfred Molina, Ron Perlman, and Toby Jones. The film is directed by Doug Liman and written by Chuck MacLean and Affleck.\n\n“The Instigators” will make its global debut in select theaters on Aug. 2, before its Aug. 9 premiere on Apple TV+.\n\nReach features reporter Kirby Adams at kadams@courier-journal.com."
