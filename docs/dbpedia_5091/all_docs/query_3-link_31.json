        "text": "Apple TV+ has released the trailer for “The Instigators,” Doug Liman‘s new Boston-set action comedy starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck.\n\nThe film follows Rory (Damon), a down on his luck dad who begrudgingly teams up with ex-con Cobby (Affleck) to steal funds from a crooked politician. But when everything goes wrong, the duo must evade capture not only from the police but also from corrupt bureaucrats and underground crime lords. While on the lam, they manage to convince Rory’s therapist (Hong Chau) to help with their getaway.\n\nThe film also stars Jack Harlow, Alfred Molina, Ron Perlman, Ving Rhames, Paul Walter Hauser, Michael Stulbarg and Don DiPetta.\n\n“The Instigators” is the latest in a long line of films starring both Damon and Affleck. Most recently, they both starred in Christopher Nolan’s best picture winner “Oppenheimer,” and they also co-starred together in Nolan’s “Interstellar.” They also acted opposite each other in “Good Will Hunting” and the “Ocean’s Eleven” trilogy.\n\nLiman directs with a script co-written by Affleck and Chuck MacLean. Ben Affleck, Damon, John Graham, Jeff Robinov and Alison Winter serve as producers while Celia D. Costas and Kevin Halloran executive produce.\n\nLiman is hot off his latest feature “Road House,” a remake of the 1989 film of the same name. Produced for Amazon Prime Video, the action thriller stars Jake Gyllenhaal as ex-UFC fighter Dalton, who takes a job as a bouncer at an out of control road house in the Florida Keys. The film also stars Conor McGregor, Post Malone, Jessica Williams and Daniela Melchior.\n\n“The Instigators” will have a limited theatrical release Aug. 2 before streaming worldwide on Apple TV+ Aug. 9. Watch the trailer below."
