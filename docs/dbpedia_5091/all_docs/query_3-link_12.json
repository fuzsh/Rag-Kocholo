        "text": "Give a Little Bit\n\nIn the Season Six Finale, Eric plans a special lunch for Sloan that doesn't go as smoothly as he hoped. Ari tries to convince his wife that buying Terrance's company is not a personal vendetta. Meanwhile, after repeated attempts to get over Jamie-Lynn, Turtle decides to make a grand gesture to be with her; Drama, resolving to give up acting for good, turns down a chance to re-audition for Melrose 2009; and Matt Damon, with help from Lebron James, strong arms Vince to get involved in his charity before Vince leaves for Italy.\n\nThe Fabian Strategy\n\nDetermined to help Liz (Tina Fey) keep a man for once, Jack (Alec Baldwin) meddles in her burgeoning relationship with Carol (guest star Matt Damon). At home, he also struggles to compromise with Avery as she redecorates his apartment. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) has trouble coming to grips with Kenneth's (Jack McBrayer) termination as a page and Jenna (Jane Krakowski) becomes TGS' newest producer. Also starring: Judah Friedlander, Scott Adsit, Keith Powell and Katrina Bowden.\n\nI Do Do\n\nLiz (Tina Fey) questions fate when she meets the man of her dreams, while Jack's (Alec Baldwin) love triangle between high school love, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), and CNBC anchor, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), comes to a head. Meanwhile, Jenna's (Jane Krakowski) boyfriend is confronted with a similar dilemma when his desire for another woman threatens to ruin their relationship, and Kenneth (Jack McBrayer), with the help of Tracy (Tracy Morgan), tries to avoid a promotion that would land him in LA. Also starring: Judah Friedlander (Frank), Scott Adsit (Pete), John Lutz (Lutz), Kevin Brown (DotCom), and Keith Powell (Toofer).\n\nDouble-Edged Sword\n\nJack and Avery (guest star Elizabeth Banks) go to Canada for a final romantic getaway before they become parents, but when Avery goes into labor, they do everything in their power to not give birth to a Canadian. Meanwhile, Liz's romantic getaway with Carol (guest star Matt Damon) is ruined when their plane is stuck on the tarmac. Tracy is besieged with the unwanted responsibility of being an EGOT winner.\n\nA Chorus Lie\n\nA desperate Jack seeks to \"in\" his rival (guest star Matt Damon, \"Ocean's Eleven\") for the last spot in a popular gay men's chorus that will tour Europe by dangling a motivated Grace (Debra Messing) as date-bait before him to prove that he's actually straight. Meanwhile, a scheming Karen (Megan Mullally) tries to pass off an unwitting Will (Eric McCormack) as her lover and not her lawyer when she discovers that she's the object of pity for being single at her own Valentine's Day party."
