        "text": "Adjustment Bureau, The\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about The Adjustment Bureau is that, irrespective of the misdirection of the trailers and T.V. spots, this is more of a romance than a science fiction thriller. That's not to say the Twilight Zone aspects of the mo...\n\nAir\n\nProfessional sports are a mixture of athletic achievements and multibillion-dollar business elements. When it comes to sports-based movies, the vast majority focus on the former, often paying lip-service (if that) to the latter. Air joins the like...\n\nBourne Identity, The\n\nIn all likelihood, Robert Ludlum fans will not be pleased by this adaptation of one of the spy master's best-received novels. That's because The Bourne Identity uses the premise, a few character names, and some isolated incidents from the novel, t...\n\nBourne Supremacy, The\n\nThe Bourne Supremacy is a serviceable thriller - no more, no less. This may come as a disappointment to those anticipating something on the same level as the surprise hit 2002 movie, The Bourne Identity. Sadly, the cinematic second installment of...\n\nBourne Ultimatum, The\n\nIf nothing else, The Bourne Ultimatum represents the best of 2007's inordinately high number of so-called \"threequels.\" Hopefully, that's not damning with faint praise. The Bourne Ultimatum, the third in the movie trilogy loosely based on Robert...\n\nContagion\n\nContagion is the best movie made to date about an epidemic/pandemic. By making the characters accessories to the story rather than the central focus, the film is able to tell the story of the evolution of the disease without being encumbered by mel...\n\nCourage Under Fire\n\nIt's often said that if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best. And, in motion pictures, one of the best is certainly Akira Kurosawa. His The Seven Samurai was remade as John Sturges' immensely popular The Magnificent Seven. His The Hidden...\n\nDeparted, The\n\nThe Departed is a perfect example of why remakes shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have taken the B-grade Hong Kong crime flick Infernal Affairs and re-imagined it as an American epic tra...\n\nDownsizing\n\nFor a movie about small people, Downsizing certainly thinks big…too big, perhaps. Director/co-writer Alexander Payne has done such a good job of world-building that there are far too many ideas, subplots, and opportunities for one two-hour f...\n\nDrive-Away Dolls\n\nWhen the Coen Brothers announced their (amicable) breakup following the release of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, a great lamentation was heard throughout the population of cineastes. Of course, that wasn’t the end of the line for Joel and Ethan ..."
