        "text": "Born October 8, 1970 in Cambridge, Mass. Damon befriended fellow future movie star Ben Affleck at age 10 and they have remained best friends since. Damon dropped out of Harvard University to pursue his acting dream full-steam, garnering small roles in films such as Mystic Pizza and School Ties (opposite Affleck) before landing his first lead role in 1993's Geronimo: An American Legend.\n\nAfter gaining notice for his supporting role opposite Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan in 1996's Courage Under Fire, Damon and Affleck turned their attention to finishing an old unfinished screenplay of his, Good Will Hunting. The project was set-up at Miramax with Gus Van Sant directing. Damon and Affleck starred as two best friends from South Boston opposite Robin Williams as the therapist treating Will. Good Will Hunting was a critical and commercial success, earning Damon an Oscar nomination as Best Actor; he and Affleck won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Damon then struggled to maintain his newfound box office viability after appearing in disappointments such as Rounders, The Legend of Bagger Vance, and All the Pretty Horses."
