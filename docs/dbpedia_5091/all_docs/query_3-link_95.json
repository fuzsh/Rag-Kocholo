        "text": "Netflix’s “The Umbrella Academy” premieres its final season. A heist goes wrong in a Boston set movie starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, and “Dance Moms” is back on Lifetime.\n\nAlso streaming this week: A four-part docuseries adapts historian Donald Bogle’s 2019 book “Hollywood Black” for MGM+, and “Not Not Jazz,” a documentary following the avant-garde, acid jazz-fusion band Medeski, Martin & Wood, becomes available to stream via video on demand.\n\nMOVIES TO STREAM\n\nA poorly planned heist goes wrong in “The Instigators” (Friday, Aug. 9, on Apple TV+), a loosely amiable Boston-set caper starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck. The movie, directed by Doug Liman (“Go,” “The Bourne Identity”), returns Damon and Affleck to familiar hometown terrain. They play a despondent pair who try to steal money from a corrupt mayor (Ron Perlman) but ends up on the run with a therapist (Hong Chau) in tow. In my review, I called it “a rudderless but winningly shaggy action comedy.”\n\nJeff Nichols (“Mud,” “Take Shelter,” “Loving”) extends his survey of classically American dramas with “The Bikeriders,” a chronicle of a Chicago motorcycle club in the 1960s. In the film (Friday, Aug. 9, on Peacock), Austin Butler and Tom Hardy star as riders with an antiauthoritarian streak who help found the Vandals but watch as their club grows beyond their control. In a male-populated film, though, Jodie Comer, the heavily accented narrator, is closer to the main character. In my review, I called it “a vivid dramatization of the birth of an American subculture.”\n\nThis month, the Criterion Channel is running two overlapping series: one of movies directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and one of films starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman was a mainstay in Anderson’s films from the start (he steals “Hard Eight” with one scene) and a central presence in films like “Magnolia,” “Punch-Drunk Love” and “The Master.” The Hoffman series also includes plenty of other highlights; look especially for the exquisitely tender 2010 drama “Jack Goes Boating.” The Anderson series also includes an exclusive streaming of the director’s radiant 2021 coming-of-age tale “Licorice Pizza,” which poignantly starred Hoffman’s son, Cooper.\n\nMUSIC TO STREAM\n\nRyuichi Sakamoto’s “Opus” — the posthumous album and documentary of the same name — was captured while the Japanese film composer was dying of cancer. Across 20 songs, Sakamoto performs a collection of his biggest songs on piano, like the memorable themes for Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Last Emperor” and “The Sheltering Sky.” The album also includes the first-ever recorded version of “Tong Poo,” from his early days with techno-pop trio Yellow Magic Orchestra.\n\nOn Friday, Aug. 9, Colombian reggaetónero J Balvin will release a new full-length project, “Rayo.” Across 15 tracks, he’s promised an album that hits like a house party — just in time for the hottest summer month. “Rayo” is stacked with good time collaborations — reggaetón superstar Fied, regional Mexican musician Carín León, Bad Gyal, Zion, Dei V, Ryan Castro, Blessd and Luar La L. The previously released singles “Gaga” with SAIKO, “Polvo de tu Vida” with Chencho Corleone, and “En Alta” with Quevedo, Omar Courtz and YOVNGCHIMI embody that spirit. At his party, everyone is invited.\n\nAlso on Friday, Aug. 9, “Not Not Jazz,” a documentary following the avant-garde, acid jazz-fusion band Medeski, Martin & Wood, becomes available to stream via video on demand. The film follows the improvisational trio as they endeavor to record a new album at the Allaire Studio in Woodstock, New York. It is a peek behind the curtain of their processes and a celebration of far too often underserved music.\n\nSHOWS TO STREAM\n\nThe dramatic world of “Dance Moms” returns with a new coach, dancers, and invested moms. In “Dance Moms: A New Era,” mothers hover as eight girls are trained by instructor Glo Hampton, a.k.a. Miss Glo, to compete nationally. The original “Dance Moms” ran for eight seasons and featured breakout stars Jojo Siwa and Maddie Ziegler. It also introduced the world to coach Abby Lee Miller, who was often criticized for being too harsh on her students. “Dance Moms: A New Era” debuts on Lifetime Wednesday, Aug. 7.\n\nNetflix’s “The Umbrella Academy” premieres its final season on Thursday, Aug. 8. The show follows a family of adopted superheroes—who were stripped of their powers in season three—who must work together to stop the apocalypse. Megan Mullally, Nick Offerman and David Cross are new faces in season four alongside regulars David Castañeda, Tom Hopper and Elliot Page.\n\nThe musical cartoon for preschoolers “Yo Gabba Gabba!” is getting a reboot called “Yo Gabba GabbaLand!” on Apple TV+. The 10-episode series premieres Friday, Aug. 9.\n\nMichael Imperioli, who played Tony Soprano’s protégé Christopher on “The Sopranos,” can’t shake the mob. He’s the executive producer and narrator of a three-part docuseries on five Italian American families selected by Charles “Lucky” Luciano in 1931 to rule the organized crime world. “American Godfathers: The Five Families” debuts Sunday, Aug. 11 on The History Channel. It will also stream on The History Channel app.\n\nA four-part docuseries adapts historian Donald Bogle’s 2019 book “Hollywood Black” for MGM+. Executive produced by Forest Whitaker, the series examines the history of cinema through the Black perspective. Creatives including Ryan Coogler, Ava DuVernay, Issa Rae, LaKeith Stanfield, Gabrielle Union, and Lena Waithe are interviewed. “Hollywood Black” premieres Sunday, Aug. 11.\n\nVIDEO GAMES TO PLAY\n\nPeople who love collecting cute monsters and making them fight have long been drawn to Pokémon. This year’s Palworld upped the ante by adding guns to the mix. But what if you just want to cuddle? That’s where 11 Bit Studios’ Creatures of Ava comes in. You’re an explorer on a planet bustling with wildlife — but the creatures are being threatened by an infection called “the withering.” It’s your mission to tame the beasts with your magic flute and help them heal. It’s a cozier take on the old “gotta catch ‘em all” formula, and it comes to Xbox X/S and PC on Wednesday."
