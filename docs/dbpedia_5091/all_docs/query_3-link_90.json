        "text": "Netflix viewers have apparently seen enough of a Matt Damon movie bust from 2017.\n\nThe Great Wall—starring Damon and Pedro Pascal—has dropped from Netflix’s Top 10 Global Movies chart after one week, according to the streamer’s list for the 10 most streamed films worldwide for the week of May 13-19.\n\nSet in ancient China, The Great Wall follows a pair of mercenaries (Damon and Pascal) who join forces with Chinese soldiers to battle massive creatures as they descend upon the historic structure.\n\nForbesMarvel Flop 'Madame Web' Finds Big Audience As Netflix Top 10 Movie\n\nThe Great Wall made its debut on the Netflix Global Top 10 Movies chart in its second week on the streaming service with 3.2 million views, which equates to 5.5 million hours viewed. As such, the viewership numbers for the film for the week of May 6-12 were good enough for to place No. 9 on the global chart.\n\nThe Great Wall, which also stars Willem Dafoe and Chinese film star Tian Jing, was added to Netflix on May 1. In addition to the Netflix Global Top 10 Movies chart, The Great Wall also came in at No. 9 on the Netflix Top 10 U.S. Movies chart from May 6-12.\n\nHow Did ‘The Great Wall’ Do At The Box Office?\n\nAccording to The Numbers, The Great Wall earned a meager $45.1 million at the domestic box office during its theatrical run from February 17, 2017, to April 6, 2017.\n\nWhile The Great Wall had a far better international take of $289.3 million and ended its run in theaters globally with a worldwide box office tally of $334.4 million, the film still ended up losing money.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report in The Hollywood Reporter, the production budget of The Great Wall was $150 million with a “conservatively estimated” $80 million marketing spend. Once all the numbers were broken down, THR said The Great Wall was expected to lose $75 million.\n\nForbesGlen Powell On How He Became 'The Blue Angels' Documentary's Wingman\n\nMaking matters even worse, Rotten Tomatoes critics splatted the monster movie with a 35% “rotten” rating based on 238 reviews. The Audience Score on the site wasn’t much better, with a negative 42% rating based on ratings from 10,000-plus verified users.\n\nMatt Damon reminisced about The Great Wall in a 2021 interview on Mark Maron’s WTF podcast (via THR), playing saying that his then-15-year-old daughter had a certain way of reminding the actor that the movie was a dud.\n\n“Whenever she talks about the movie, she calls it The Wall. And I’m like, come on, it’s called The Great Wall,” Damon told Maron. “And she’s like, ‘Dad, there’s nothing great about that movie.’ She’s one of the funniest people I know.”"
