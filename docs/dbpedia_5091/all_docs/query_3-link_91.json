        "text": "Apple Original Films on Thursday unveiled the trailer for its upcoming feature “The Instigators,” hailing from Apple Studios, starring Academy Award winners Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, and directed by Doug Liman. “The Instigators” will make its global debut in select theaters August 2, 2024 before its global premiere August 9, 2024 on Apple TV+.\n\nRory (Damon) and Cobby (Affleck) are reluctant partners: a desperate father and an ex-con thrown together to rob a corrupt politician’s ill-gained earnings. But when the heist goes wrong, the two find themselves engulfed in a whirlwind of chaos, pursued not only by police but also backward bureaucrats and vengeful crime bosses. Completely out of their depth, they convince Rory’s therapist (Hong Chau) to join their riotous getaway through the city, where they must put aside their differences and work together to evade capture — or worse. “The Instigators” also stars Michael Stuhlbarg, Paul Walter Hauser, Ving Rhames, Alfred Molina and Toby Jones, with Jack Harlow and Ron Perlman.\n\nAn Apple Original Film hailing from Artists Equity, Studio 8 and The Walsh Company, “The Instigators,” is directed by Liman, written by Chuck MacLean and Casey Affleck and produced by Ben Affleck, Damon, Jeff Robinov, John Graham, Kevin J. Walsh and Alison Winter, with Celia D. Costas, Dani Bernfeld, Kevin Halloran, Michael Joe, Cynthia Dahlgren and Luciana Damon serving as executive producers.\n\nApple TV+ offers premium, compelling drama and comedy series, feature films, groundbreaking documentaries, and kids and family entertainment, and is available to watch across all of a user’s favorite screens. After its launch on November 1, 2019, Apple TV+ became the first all-original streaming service to launch around the world, and has premiered more original hits and received more award recognitions faster than any other streaming service in its debut. To date, Apple Original films, documentaries and series have earned 494 wins and 2,165 award nominations and counting, including multi-Emmy Award-winning comedy “Ted Lasso” and historic Oscar Best Picture winner “CODA.”\n\nSupport MacDailyNews at no extra cost to you by using this link to shop at Amazon.\n\n‎\n\nMacDailyNews Note: Apple TV+ is available on the Apple TV app in over 100 countries and regions, on over 1 billion screens, including iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, Mac, popular smart TVs from Samsung, LG, Sony, VIZIO, TCL and others, Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices, Chromecast with Google TV, PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles, and at tv.apple.com, for $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial.
