        "text": "BFFs Ben Affleck and Matt Damon have found their next collaboration. The “Good Will Hunting” and “Air” team will next star in “RIP,” a new Netflix thriller from writer and director Joe Carnahan.\n\nPlot details and release date remain under wraps. The film will be produced by Artists Equity — the artist-led studio founded by Affleck and Damon in 2022.\n\nArtist Equity’s other projects include the Cillian Murphy starrer “Small Things Like These,” a sequel to “The Accountant” and the Jennifer Lopez-led films “Unstoppable” and “Kiss of the Spider Woman.”\n\nAffleck and Damon have been longtime collaborators, first teaming up for 1997’s “Good Will Hunting,” which earned them both Oscars for best original screenplay. They starred together in Ridley Scott’s 2021 historical drama “The Last Duel” alongside Jodie Comer and Adam Driver. Their last project was 2023’s sports drama “Air,” which Affleck also directed.\n\nDamon was most recently seen in Christopher Nolan’s Oscar-winning “Oppenheimer” and Ethan Coen’s “Drive-Away Dolls.” He’s next set to star alongside Affleck’s brother Casey in the comedy heist film “The Instigators.”\n\nAffleck recently reprised his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in 2023’s “The Flash,” and appeared in wife Jennifer Lopez’s film “This Is Me… Now: A Love Story.”\n\nCarnahan’s previous credits include 2002 crime thriller “Narc,” 2006 action flick “Smokin’ Aces” and 2021’s “Copshop.” Upcoming films include “Shadow Force” with Kerry Washington and “Not Without Hope,” starring Zachary Levi.\n\nAffleck and Damon are represented by WME, while Carnahan is repped by CAA.\n\nDeadline was first to report the Netflix news."
