        "text": "Movie Synopsis\n\nFrom director Robert Redford comes a film that celebrates the power and potential of the human spirit. Will Smith, Matt Damon, Charlize Theron star in this highly-acclaimed tale of a local hero with a promising future whose hopes are shattered on the battlefields of war. The disillusioned young man turns his back on the world – until a fateful visit from a mysterious stranger turns his life around. Visually stunning and emotionally compelling, The Legend of Bagger Vance is genuine movie-making magic sure to entertain and inspire audiences for years to come..\n\nRent $3.99\n\nBuy $14.99\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWhat steps does Bagger Vance take to help get Rannulph Junuh’s life and golf game back on track?\n\nWhat are some mental tips suggested by Bagger that help Junuh overcome his personal demons and mental block?\n\nHow does the game of golf help Junuh recover from the trauma of World War I?\n\nWhen Junuh disregards Bagger’s advice, he tends to play poorly. What does this indicate about trusting your coach as an athlete?\n\nWith a chance to win the tournament, Junuh calls a penalty stroke on himself. Is this kind of integrity important? What would you have done in that situation?\n\nWhen Bagger leaves Junuh at the end of the match, what does this indicate about Junuh’s character? Has he matured? Is this why Bagger left?\n\nGolf tends to be known as a game where opponents respect each other. Is that true in this film as well? Is that important in just golf or for all sports?\n\nWhat Parents Need To Know\n\nParents need to know that this movie has a brief but bloody battle scene, brief mild language, brief sexual references, and inexplicit sexual situations. A woman offers to trade a man sex for a favor. She does not go through with it, even though it is clear that she loves him, in fact, probably because she loves him. A man commits suicide (off-camera). Junuh abuses alcohol in an attempt to forget his experiences and his pain.\n\nRead full review\n\nReview by Common Sense Media® Common Sense Media is a registered trademark, and other associated names, and logos are trademarks of Common Sense Media, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization."
