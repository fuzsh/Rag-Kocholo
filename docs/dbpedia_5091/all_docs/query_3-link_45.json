Many reviewers thought it was a poor adaption of the Cormac McCarthy novel it was based on.\n\n\"McCarthy's novel employs the coming of age narrative in service of his sanguineous spiritual vision,\" wrote Steve Mirarchi for the Boston Globe. \"For the film to renounce that philosophy is to give up its soul and be rendered lifeless.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamon played Kevin in \"The Third Wheel\" (2002).\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 33%\n\nSummary: A lonely office worker's life takes an unexpected turn when he inadvertently becomes the unwanted third wheel on a date.

Forced to raise his daughter alone in New Jersey, he learns the true meaning of fatherhood, love, and finding happiness in unexpected places.\n\nReviewers were very critical of Ben Affleck's leading performance in \"Jersey Girl.\" Generally, they enjoyed the movie's warm tone but thought it verged on being too sentimental.\n\nFor the Austin Chronicle, Kimberley Jones wrote of the movie, \"Its heart is in the right place. Unfortunately, that heart is about the only element here that doesn't strain credibility.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" (2000), Damon starred as Rannulph Junuh.\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 43%\n\nSummary: A golfer in the midst of a personal crisis finds redemption when he encounters a mysterious caddy who teaches him about the power of faith, self-discovery, and the true spirit of the game.\n\nCritics thought the film was full of talented actors, including Damon, Will Smith, and Charlize Theron, but most reviewers ultimately deemed the characters to be flat.\n\n\"Another lusciously produced, emotionally clammy Redford enterprise — forced, phony mythmaking filled with tinged sunsets and full moons,\" wrote Peter Rainer for New York Magazine/Vulture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was the voice of Bill the Krill in \"Happy Feet Two\" (2011).\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 45%\n\nSummary: The penguin nation faces a new threat as its home is disrupted by an enormous iceberg. Mumble's (voiced by Elijah Wood) son must find his own unique voice to unite the penguins and other creatures in an epic journey.\n\nAlthough most reviewers agreed the film's animation was detailed and vibrant, most thought it didn't live up to the original.\n\nDerek Adams wrote for Time Out, \"If there's a saving grace, it's the visuals, especially the beautiful scenes of orange krill. But that's about all.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Downsizing\" (2017), Damon played Paul Safranek.\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 47%\n\nSummary: Paul Safranek (Damon) decides to undergo a groundbreaking procedure that shrinks him and his wife down to 5 inches as a solution to overpopulation and environmental concerns.

Britton Davis in \"Geronimo: An American Legend\" (1993).\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 48%\n\nSummary: Legendary Apache leader Geronimo (Wes Studi) resists the encroachment of white settlers on Indigenous lands in the late 19th century.\n\nThe film was liked by some critics for its well-shot historical depictions, but many thought it fell flat in terms of excitement and plot.\n\n\"Despite the film's visual and aural splendors,\" wrote Malcolm Johnson for the Hartford Courant. \"'Geronimo' fails to achieve its noble ambitions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Zero Theorem\" (2013) stars Damon as Management.\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 48%\n\nSummary: A reclusive computer genius is tasked with solving a mathematical formula that holds the key to the meaning of life.\n\nReviews for the movie were split, with nearly half of the critics enjoying the vision of director Terry Gilliam and many feeling the film was jumbled and manic.\n\n\"It's bursting with Gilliam's trademark manic energy, but the focus and execution are so soft that that energy ends up derailing the film instead of invigorating it,\" wrote Barbara VanDenburgh of the film in a review for the Arizona Republic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Titan A.E.'' (2000), Damon was the voice of Cale.\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 50%\n\nSummary: A young man named Cale Tucker (voiced by Damon) becomes humanity's last hope for survival when Earth is destroyed by an alien race.\n\nThe reviews on \"Titan A.E.\" were split nearly in half. Those who enjoyed the movie praised the film's cast, animation, and effects, while those who disliked it thought it wasn't quite original enough.\n\nGrant Watson called the movie \"an uneven blend of success and failure\" in his review for Fiction Machine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamon appeared as himself and Will Hunting in \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" (2001).\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 52%\n\nSummary: Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) embark on a cross-country mission to Hollywood to stop a film adaptation of their comic book alter egos.\n\nCritics thought the film was raunchy and self-indulgent, appealing primarily to fans of Smith's previous films. Some thought it relied too heavily on inside jokes and references.\n\n\"A cross between a crude dumbed-down comedy and a home movie featuring a couple of dozen guest appearances by various performers and celebrities,\" wrote Philip French of the film for The Guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamon starred as Roy Miller in \"Green Zone\" (2010).\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 53%\n\nSummary: An Army officer in Iraq uncovers a web of corruption and misinformation during the search for weapons of mass destruction. As he seeks the truth, he becomes a target and must navigate a dangerous landscape to expose the real agenda.\n\nThough some reviewers felt the film was gripping thanks to its intense action sequences and Damon's performance, others criticized it for its heavy-handed anti-war message.\n\n\"It's one thing for the filmmakers to (sort of) fictionalize real people,\" wrote Peter Rainer for Christian Science Monitor. \"But 'Green Zone' wraps up with a wish-fulfillment fantasy that is about as believable as watching reinforcements riding in to save Custer.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamon produced \"Promised Land\" (2012) and appeared in it as Steve Butler.\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 53%\n\nSummary: A corporate salesman arrives in a small town to negotiate land rights for natural-gas drilling, facing unexpected challenges and moral dilemmas along the way.\n\nMany critics enjoyed that the film was thought-provoking and had strong performances, but some reviewers criticized it for its lack of subtlety in its messaging and predictable plot twists.\n\nKent Jones reviewed the movie for Film Comment magazine, writing, \"Damon and Krasinski's script isn't completely solid, but it follows a believably wayward path to a lovely, muted ending.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamon starred as the titular character in \"Jason Bourne\" (2016).\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 54%\n\nSummary: Jason Bourne (Damon) resurfaces when new information about his past emerges. Hunted by the agency he once served, Bourne embarks on a relentless pursuit of the truth while evading capture.\n\nAlthough the \"Jason Bourne\" franchise is generally well-loved by critics, reviewers felt this installment was a somewhat underwhelming addition, citing its lackluster plot and usual \"Bourne\" tropes. However, it was enjoyed by other reviewers for its high-impact action sequences.\n\nDwight Brown reviewed the film for the National Newspaper Publishers Association, writing, \"One hour into the movie, you feel like you're watching outtakes from a Mission Impossible sequel.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Ocean's Twelve\" (2004), Damon starred as Linus Caldwell.\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 55%\n\nSummary: Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his team reunite for another daring heist after being blackmailed by a cunning European thief. They must outsmart both law enforcement and their newfound adversary to pull off the ultimate con.\n\nCritics described this installment of the \"Ocean's\" franchise as an entertaining heist film with a star-studded cast, but some didn't enjoy its convoluted plot and lack of tension compared to the original.\n\n\"'Ocean's Twelve' is busier, messier and thinner than its predecessor,\" wrote David Ansen of the sequel for Newsweek. \"While it looks like the cast is having a blast and a half, the studied hipness can get so pleased with itself it borders on the smug.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Good Shepherd\" (2006) featured Damon as Edward Wilson.\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 56%\n\nSummary: An idealistic Yale student is recruited by the newly formed CIA and becomes deeply entrenched in the world of espionage.
