The Legend Of Bagger Vance [DVD] (2000) DVD

Director Robert Redford's lyrical look at salvation and sand traps stars Matt Damon as a former pro golfer in 1920s Georgia. Unable to play since being traumatized in World War I, Damon agrees to take part in a tournament to save old flame Charlize Theron's resort and receives advice that changes his game--and his life--from guru-like caddy Will Smith. With J. Michael Moncrief, Bruce McGill and an unbilled Jack Lemmon narrating. 127 min. Widescreen (Enhanced); Soundtracks: English Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital stereo, DTS 5.1; Subtitles: English; documentary; featurette; theatrical trailers; biographies.
