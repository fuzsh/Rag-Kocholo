        "text": "As we mentioned in this morning's reboot, Microsoft has added a book search component to its Live Search offering. The new service is currently a public beta available on the Live Search website, but it will eventually be incorporated into the general search engine.\n\nLive Search Books will offer full text searches of scanned books, but for the time being the collection is limited to public domain works from the British Library, the University of California and the University of Toronto.\n\nMicrosoft says they will be adding copyrighted books in the future, but only those submitted by publishers or authors. This differs from Google who has scanned everything in the participating libraries' collections, but only offers full text searches of public domain books.\n\nThus far several publishers and authors have sued Google, as has the US Authors Guild, Microsoft apparently wishes to avoid the lawsuits.\n\nSo far the searching is very limited with no advanced options or search operators available but hopefully that will change as the beta progress. If you find something you'd like to save or print, Live Search Books offers PDF files for download including a link to download the entire book.\n\nSo far the site does not appear to support the Safari browser but Firefox and IE work just fine.\n\nMicrosoft also announced the addition of medical content to the Windows Live Academic Search. Academic Search is a full texts search of journals for institutions that subscribe to them. Today's additions reported quadruple the amount of medical information in Academic Search.\n\nGoogle Search Is an Illegal Monopoly, US Judge Rules\n\nNearly a year after the US government took Google to trial, a judge has found that the tech giant violated antitrust laws. A new trial will determine how Google should be penalized.\n\nZoom Is Going After Google and Microsoft With AI-Driven Docs\n\nThe video-conferencing app is trying to create an \"everything workplace\" app in a crowded market.\n\nHuge Microsoft Outage Caused by CrowdStrike Takes Down Computers Around the World\n\nA software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike appears to have inadvertently disrupted IT systems globally.\n\nFlush With Cash, Tether Has Got Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in Its Crosshairs\n\nUnder new CEO Paolo Ardoino, the crypto company is spending heavily in a bid to muscle into an AI market dominated by the world’s largest tech firms.\n\nLive from the RNC: Republicans Are Acting Like They've Already Won\n\nIn a matter of days, the 2024 election has changed dramatically.\n\nLawsuit Attacks Florida’s Lab-Grown Meat Ban as Unconstitutional\n\nUpside Foods, a leading cultivated-meat company, argues that the ban violates the US Constitution in several ways.\n\nX Is Boosting the Far Right’s UK Riots as Telegram Scrambles for Control\n\nFar-right protesters are trying to share violent rhetoric on social media. For the first time, Telegram is blocking them—while X is giving them a platform.\n\nAs Skies Fill With Space Junk, Nonprofit Urges US to Pause StarLink Launches\n\nThe advocacy group PIRG is asking the US government to conduct environmental reviews of commercial internet satellites. The group’s new report warns of a space garbage problem with Earthly consequences."
