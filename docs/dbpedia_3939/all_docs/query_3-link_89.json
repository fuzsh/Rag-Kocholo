        "text": "Frames\n\nThese six frames are presented alphabetically and do not suggest a particular sequence in which they must be learned.\n\nAuthority Is Constructed and Contextual\n\nInformation resources reflect their creators’ expertise and credibility, and are evaluated based on the information need and the context in which the information will be used. Authority is constructed in that various communities may recognize different types of authority. It is contextual in that the information need may help to determine the level of authority required.\n\nExperts understand that authority is a type of influence recognized or exerted within a community. Experts view authority with an attitude of informed skepticism and an openness to new perspectives, additional voices, and changes in schools of thought. Experts understand the need to determine the validity of the information created by different authorities and to acknowledge biases that privilege some sources of authority over others, especially in terms of others’ worldviews, gender, sexual orientation, and cultural orientations. An understanding of this concept enables novice learners to critically examine all evidence—be it a short blog post or a peer-reviewed conference proceeding—and to ask relevant questions about origins, context, and suitability for the current information need. Thus, novice learners come to respect the expertise that authority represents while remaining skeptical of the systems that have elevated that authority and the information created by it. Experts know how to seek authoritative voices but also recognize that unlikely voices can be authoritative, depending on need. Novice learners may need to rely on basic indicators of authority, such as type of publication or author credentials, where experts recognize schools of thought or discipline-specific paradigms.\n\nKnowledge Practices\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\ndefine different types of authority, such as subject expertise (e.g., scholarship), societal position (e.g., public office or title), or special experience (e.g., participating in a historic event);\n\nuse research tools and indicators of authority to determine the credibility of sources, understanding the elements that might temper this credibility;\n\nunderstand that many disciplines have acknowledged authorities in the sense of well-known scholars and publications that are widely considered “standard,” and yet, even in those situations, some scholars would challenge the authority of those sources;\n\nrecognize that authoritative content may be packaged formally or informally and may include sources of all media types;\n\nacknowledge they are developing their own authoritative voices in a particular area and recognize the responsibilities this entails, including seeking accuracy and reliability, respecting intellectual property, and participating in communities of practice;\n\nunderstand the increasingly social nature of the information ecosystem where authorities actively connect with one another and sources develop over time.\n\nDispositions\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\ndevelop and maintain an open mind when encountering varied and sometimes conflicting perspectives;\n\nmotivate themselves to find authoritative sources, recognizing that authority may be conferred or manifested in unexpected ways;\n\ndevelop awareness of the importance of assessing content with a skeptical stance and with a self-awareness of their own biases and worldview;\n\nquestion traditional notions of granting authority and recognize the value of diverse ideas and worldviews;\n\nare conscious that maintaining these attitudes and actions requires frequent self-evaluation.\n\nInformation Creation as a Process\n\nInformation in any format is produced to convey a message and is shared via a selected delivery method. The iterative processes of researching, creating, revising, and disseminating information vary, and the resulting product reflects these differences.\n\nThe information creation process could result in a range of information formats and modes of delivery, so experts look beyond format when selecting resources to use. The unique capabilities and constraints of each creation process as well as the specific information need determine how the product is used. Experts recognize that information creations are valued differently in different contexts, such as academia or the workplace. Elements that affect or reflect on the creation, such as a pre- or post-publication editing or reviewing process, may be indicators of quality. The dynamic nature of information creation and dissemination requires ongoing attention to understand evolving creation processes. Recognizing the nature of information creation, experts look to the underlying processes of creation as well as the final product to critically evaluate the usefulness of the information. Novice learners begin to recognize the significance of the creation process, leading them to increasingly sophisticated choices when matching information products with their information needs.\n\nKnowledge Practices\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\narticulate the capabilities and constraints of information developed through various creation processes;\n\nassess the fit between an information product’s creation process and a particular information need;\n\narticulate the traditional and emerging processes of information creation and dissemination in a particular discipline;\n\nrecognize that information may be perceived differently based on the format in which it is packaged;\n\nrecognize the implications of information formats that contain static or dynamic information;\n\nmonitor the value that is placed upon different types of information products in varying contexts;\n\ntransfer knowledge of capabilities and constraints to new types of information products;\n\ndevelop, in their own creation processes, an understanding that their choices impact the purposes for which the information product will be used and the message it conveys.\n\nDispositions\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\nare inclined to seek out characteristics of information products that indicate the underlying creation process;\n\nvalue the process of matching an information need with an appropriate product;\n\naccept that the creation of information may begin initially through communicating in a range of formats or modes;\n\naccept the ambiguity surrounding the potential value of information creation expressed in emerging formats or modes;\n\nresist the tendency to equate format with the underlying creation process;\n\nunderstand that different methods of information dissemination with different purposes are available for their use.\n\nInformation Has Value\n\nInformation possesses several dimensions of value, including as a commodity, as a means of education, as a means to influence, and as a means of negotiating and understanding the world. Legal and socioeconomic interests influence information production and dissemination.\n\nThe value of information is manifested in various contexts, including publishing practices, access to information, the commodification of personal information, and intellectual property laws. The novice learner may struggle to understand the diverse values of information in an environment where “free” information and related services are plentiful and the concept of intellectual property is first encountered through rules of citation or warnings about plagiarism and copyright law. As creators and users of information, experts understand their rights and responsibilities when participating in a community of scholarship. Experts understand that value may be wielded by powerful interests in ways that marginalize certain voices. However, value may also be leveraged by individuals and organizations to effect change and for civic, economic, social, or personal gains. Experts also understand that the individual is responsible for making deliberate and informed choices about when to comply with and when to contest current legal and socioeconomic practices concerning the value of information.\n\nKnowledge Practices\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\ngive credit to the original ideas of others through proper attribution and citation;\n\nunderstand that intellectual property is a legal and social construct that varies by culture;\n\narticulate the purpose and distinguishing characteristics of copyright, fair use, open access, and the public domain;\n\nunderstand how and why some individuals or groups of individuals may be underrepresented or systematically marginalized within the systems that produce and disseminate information;\n\nrecognize issues of access or lack of access to information sources;\n\ndecide where and how their information is published;\n\nunderstand how the commodification of their personal information and online interactions affects the information they receive and the information they produce or disseminate online;\n\nmake informed choices regarding their online actions in full awareness of issues related to privacy and the commodification of personal information.\n\nDispositions\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\nrespect the original ideas of others;\n\nvalue the skills, time, and effort needed to produce knowledge;\n\nsee themselves as contributors to the information marketplace rather than only consumers of it;\n\nare inclined to examine their own information privilege.\n\nResearch as Inquiry\n\nResearch is iterative and depends upon asking increasingly complex or new questions whose answers in turn develop additional questions or lines of inquiry in any field.\n\nExperts see inquiry as a process that focuses on problems or questions in a discipline or between disciplines that are open or unresolved. Experts recognize the collaborative effort within a discipline to extend the knowledge in that field. Many times, this process includes points of disagreement where debate and dialogue work to deepen the conversations around knowledge. This process of inquiry extends beyond the academic world to the community at large, and the process of inquiry may focus upon personal, professional, or societal needs. The spectrum of inquiry ranges from asking simple questions that depend upon basic recapitulation of knowledge to increasingly sophisticated abilities to refine research questions, use more advanced research methods, and explore more diverse disciplinary perspectives. Novice learners acquire strategic perspectives on inquiry and a greater repertoire of investigative methods.\n\nKnowledge Practices\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\nformulate questions for research based on information gaps or on reexamination of existing, possibly conflicting, information;\n\ndetermine an appropriate scope of investigation;\n\ndeal with complex research by breaking complex questions into simple ones, limiting the scope of investigations;\n\nuse various research methods, based on need, circumstance, and type of inquiry;\n\nmonitor gathered information and assess for gaps or weaknesses;\n\norganize information in meaningful ways;\n\nsynthesize ideas gathered from multiple sources;\n\ndraw reasonable conclusions based on the analysis and interpretation of information.\n\nDispositions\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\nconsider research as open-ended exploration and engagement with information;\n\nappreciate that a question may appear to be simple but still disruptive and important to research;\n\nvalue intellectual curiosity in developing questions and learning new investigative methods;\n\nmaintain an open mind and a critical stance;\n\nvalue persistence, adaptability, and flexibility and recognize that ambiguity can benefit the research process;\n\nseek multiple perspectives during information gathering and assessment;\n\nseek appropriate help when needed;\n\nfollow ethical and legal guidelines in gathering and using information;\n\ndemonstrate intellectual humility (i.e., recognize their own intellectual or experiential limitations).\n\nScholarship as Conversation\n\nCommunities of scholars, researchers, or professionals engage in sustained discourse with new insights and discoveries occurring over time as a result of varied perspectives and interpretations.\n\nResearch in scholarly and professional fields is a discursive practice in which ideas are formulated, debated, and weighed against one another over extended periods of time. Instead of seeking discrete answers to complex problems, experts understand that a given issue may be characterized by several competing perspectives as part of an ongoing conversation in which information users and creators come together and negotiate meaning. Experts understand that, while some topics have established answers through this process, a query may not have a single uncontested answer. Experts are therefore inclined to seek out many perspectives, not merely the ones with which they are familiar. These perspectives might be in their own discipline or profession or may be in other fields. While novice learners and experts at all levels can take part in the conversation, established power and authority structures may influence their ability to participate and can privilege certain voices and information. Developing familiarity with the sources of evidence, methods, and modes of discourse in the field assists novice learners to enter the conversation. New forms of scholarly and research conversations provide more avenues in which a wide variety of individuals may have a voice in the conversation. Providing attribution to relevant previous research is also an obligation of participation in the conversation. It enables the conversation to move forward and strengthens one’s voice in the conversation.\n\nKnowledge Practices\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\ncite the contributing work of others in their own information production;\n\ncontribute to scholarly conversation at an appropriate level, such as local online community, guided discussion, undergraduate research journal, conference presentation/poster session;\n\nidentify barriers to entering scholarly conversation via various venues;\n\ncritically evaluate contributions made by others in participatory information environments;\n\nidentify the contribution that particular articles, books, and other scholarly pieces make to disciplinary knowledge;\n\nsummarize the changes in scholarly perspective over time on a particular topic within a specific discipline;\n\nrecognize that a given scholarly work may not represent the only or even the majority perspective on the issue.\n\nDispositions\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\nrecognize they are often entering into an ongoing scholarly conversation and not a finished conversation;\n\nseek out conversations taking place in their research area;\n\nsee themselves as contributors to scholarship rather than only consumers of it;\n\nrecognize that scholarly conversations take place in various venues;\n\nsuspend judgment on the value of a particular piece of scholarship until the larger context for the scholarly conversation is better understood;\n\nunderstand the responsibility that comes with entering the conversation through participatory channels;\n\nvalue user-generated content and evaluate contributions made by others;\n\nrecognize that systems privilege authorities and that not having a fluency in the language and process of a discipline disempowers their ability to participate and engage.\n\nSearching as Strategic Exploration\n\nSearching for information is often nonlinear and iterative, requiring the evaluation of a range of information sources and the mental flexibility to pursue alternate avenues as new understanding develops.\n\nThe act of searching often begins with a question that directs the act of finding needed information. Encompassing inquiry, discovery, and serendipity, searching identifies both possible relevant sources as well as the means to access those sources. Experts realize that information searching is a contextualized, complex experience that affects, and is affected by, the cognitive, affective, and social dimensions of the searcher. Novice learners may search a limited set of resources, while experts may search more broadly and deeply to determine the most appropriate information within the project scope. Likewise, novice learners tend to use few search strategies, while experts select from various search strategies, depending on the sources, scope, and context of the information need.\n\nKnowledge Practices\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities\n\ndetermine the initial scope of the task required to meet their information needs;\n\nidentify interested parties, such as scholars, organizations, governments, and industries, who might produce information about a topic and then determine how to access that information;\n\nutilize divergent (e.g., brainstorming) and convergent (e.g., selecting the best source) thinking when searching;\n\nmatch information needs and search strategies to appropriate search tools;\n\ndesign and refine needs and search strategies as necessary, based on search results;\n\nunderstand how information systems (i.e., collections of recorded information) are organized in order to access relevant information;\n\nuse different types of searching language (e.g., controlled vocabulary, keywords, natural language) appropriately;\n\nmanage searching processes and results effectively.\n\nDispositions\n\nLearners who are developing their information literate abilities"
