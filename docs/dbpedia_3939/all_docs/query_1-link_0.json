It was similar to Google Scholar, but rather than crawling the Internet for academic content, search results came directly from trusted sources, such as publishers of academic journals.[citation needed] Users were required to log in to access the service.\n\nLive Search Academic was known as Windows Live Academic Search when the beta version was officially launched on April 11, 2006.[1] The name had changed to Live Search Academic by December 6, 2006, when Microsoft announced the addition of millions of new articles, mainly in biomedicine.[2]\n\nOn May 23, 2008, Microsoft announced the end of Live Search Academic and Live Search Books, both sites to be closed, with their results integrated into regular Search. The project scanned 750,000 books and indexed 80 million journal articles.[3][4]\n\nFeatures\n\n[edit]\n\nLive Search Academic indexed journal articles, conference proceedings, books, theses and dissertations from the following fields:\n\nInformation and computer science\n\nPhysics\n\nElectrical engineering\n\nBiomedicine\n\nIn addition to the normal search capabilities, Live Search Academic also featured:\n\nSorting by relevance, date, author, journal and conference\n\nSlider bar to change level of details of search results\n\nExport citations for different formats, including BibTeX, RefWorks and EndNote\n\nPreview window on the right displaying the title, journal name, abstract summary, authors, volume, publication year, publisher, source and the article's digital object identifier\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nWeb of Science from the Institute for Scientific Information\n\nLive Search\n\nMicrosoft Academic Search\n\nScirus\n\nScopus\n\nWindows Live\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
