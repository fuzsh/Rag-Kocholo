        "text": "I have / had windows live search as my default search provider for internet explorer (live serach was auto-selected when I installed the OS onto this computer). It seems that live search is no longer working and ends up going to my ISP provider search as error recovery. I did a web search for \"live search down\", but just found a few hits at other forums also mentioning live search was down. Seems this started about 6 to 10 days ago.\n\nI'll just switch my default search provider, but a bit suprised I didn't find any announcements about this.\n\nLive Search was replaced by Bing back in 2009. I'm not sure which version of IE you're using, but if you install a new version of IE you'll see that the default search is through Bing, not through Live Search. Microsoft properly just let one of their old domains expire and your version of IE stopped going to a working URL when you searched.\n\nI suspect that if you upgrade your version of IE, this problem will go away for you entirely.\n\nNattyBumppo said:\n\nLive Search was replaced by Bing back in 2009.

I did find several articles about Live being replaced by Bing back in 2009, but this problem only started 6 to 10 days ago, so you're probably correct about the domain expiration. When doing a web search for this issue, I didn't find many hits, so apparently not many people were using it."
