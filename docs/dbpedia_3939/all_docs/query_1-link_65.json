The EPSCoR program envisions its jurisdictions as recognized contributors to the national and global STEM research enterprise. The program seeks to:\n\nCatalyze the development of research capabilities and the creation of new knowledge that expands jurisdictions’ contributions to scientific discovery, innovation, learning, and knowledge-based prosperity\n\nEstablish sustainable STEM education, training, and professional development pathways that advance jurisdiction-identified research areas and workforce development\n\nBroaden direct participation of diverse individuals, institutions, and organizations in the project’s science and engineering research and education initiatives\n\nEffect sustainable engagement of project participants and partners, the jurisdiction, the national research community, and the general public through data-sharing, communication, outreach, and dissemination\n\nImpact research, education, and economic development beyond the project at academic, government, and private sector levels.\n\nEPSCoR is part of NSF's Broadening Participation portfolio.\n\nImpacts and outcomes\n\nNSF EPSCoR has impacted researchers across the nation. In 2023, the program's RII awardees have accomplished the following:\n\nPublished 1,259 journal articles, book chapters, and related research material\n\nReceived 611 grants, totaling over $460M, in additional research funding\n\nPatented 9 discoveries, with an added 49 patent-pending\n\nHelped 386 undergraduates and 251 graduate students earn their STEM bachelors and masters degrees\n\nLearn more about EPSCoR's impact on the Impacts and Outcomes webpage.\n\nRecent news\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nAlabama coalition is building a new statewide industry, backed by National Science Foundation\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nUAH-led coalition building new statewide plasma industry in Alabama, backed by National Science Foundation\n\nJuly 23, 2024\n\nNSF announces $77.8M investment to build climate resilience capacity across 21 EPSCoR jurisdictions\n\nRead EPSCoR's new Dear Colleague Letter to learn more about Planning Grants for E-RISE and E-CORE.\n\nThe 2024 EPSCoR Annual PI Meeting was held at NSF May 20-21, 2024. Please click the following button to view the presentations.\n\nJoin us at the EPSCoR National Conference, October 13–16 in Omaha, Nebraska\n\nMore about EPSCoR\n\nInvestment strategies\n\nLearn about EPSCoR's three major investment strategies to improve the R&D competitiveness of researchers and institutions within EPSCoR jurisdictions.\n\nCriteria for eligibility\n\nFind out more about who is eligible for EPSCoR funding.\n\nEPSCoR impacts and outcomes\n\nSince 1979, NSF EPSCoR has served its community through investment across the STEM enterprise."
