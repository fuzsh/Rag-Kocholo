While they will still index books and scholarly publications in their primary search index, Microsoft’s digitization initiatives will come to an end.\n\nLibraries and publishers are encouraged to build digital archives utilizing the platform Microsoft built with Kirtas, the Internet Archive, CCS, and others.\n\nCommenting on the future of the search business, Satya Nadella Senior vice president search, portal and advertising, wrote on the Live Search blog, “Given the evolution of the Web and our strategy, we believe the next generation of search is about the development of an underlying, sustainable business model for the search engine, consumer, and content partner.”\n\nWhat do you think about Microsoft’s move to end their Live Search Books and Academic Projects? Let us know in the comments."
