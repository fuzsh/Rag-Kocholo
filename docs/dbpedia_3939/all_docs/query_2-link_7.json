At beta, the index focuses on journal content from the subjects of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Physics – we will be expanding the index to additional subjects soon.\n\nKey components of this release focus around enabling the user to have more control over their search experience which ideally leads to finding the information the right information faster.\n\nKey features include:\n\nPreview Pane – Users can preview the full or partial abstract of the individual search results alongside additional metadata about the content. This helps users determine relevance of the content.\n\nSort by – Provides users with additional ways to view and analyze their search results including sort by key metadata elements including – Author, Date of publication, Journal of publication etc.\n\nCitation – To aid users in taking the information they have found and easily incorporating into their research – we have added a citation export feature. From the preview pane, you can export the data into BibTEx or Endnote format and incorporate it into your bibliography by simply doing a cut & paste.\n\nWe are currently working to add Windows Live Search Macros support to Academic search – which will allow you to write your own macros (link to the macro entry on the MSN Search blog) for academic search, and share it with the community.\n\nYou can find more information about Academic search and the Academic search team on the Windows Live Academic search Blog (http://spaces.msn.com/academicsearch)\n\n–Thiru Anandanpillai, Product Planning\n\n— Mike Buschman, Program Management\n\nOn behalf of the Windows Live Academic Search team\n\n——————————————–"
