        "text": "Wow. Earlier this month, I\n\nheard Microsoft\n\nexecs highlight\n\nLive Search Books as a key advance they were doing in search. Today,\n\nnews that the site along with\n\nLive Search\n\nAcademic are being closed next week, since they lack the “high consumer\n\nintent” that Microsoft is now focusing on. So much for trying to seem like the\n\nmuch-needed “good” alternative to Google. From Microsoft’s blog post:\n\nToday we informed our partners that we are ending the Live Search Books and\n\nLive Search Academic projects and that both sites will be taken down next\n\nweek. Books and scholarly publications will continue to be integrated into our\n\nSearch results, but not through separate indexes.\n\nThis also means that we are winding down our digitization initiatives,\n\nincluding our library scanning and our in-copyright book programs. We\n\nrecognize that this decision comes as disappointing news to our partners, the\n\npublishing and academic communities, and Live Search users.\n\nAmazing. And disappointing. Microsoft got mileage out of the idea it was\n\nworking with the Open Content\n\nAlliance as the “good” book search partner not encumbered by controversy\n\nthat the Google Book Search service has\n\nencountered. For background on that, see:\n\nBattle For Books:\n\nEvil Google Versus The Altruistic Open Content Alliance, Dec. 2006\n\nDissecting\n\nMicrosoft Slams At Google As Copyright Infringer, March 2007\n\nGoogle: As Open As\n\nIt Wants To Be (i.e., When It’s Convenient), Nov. 2007\n\nWhile I had wanted to see the two rival book scanning projects cooperate more\n\nwith each other, it was still nice to have both major companies involved. But\n\napparently Microsoft figures going after the consumer searchers (as with the\n\nLive Search Cashback\n\nprogram) means there’s no time for important but less-revenue generating\n\nprojects like these. Writes Microsoft:\n\nGiven the evolution of the Web and our strategy, we believe the next\n\ngeneration of search is about the development of an underlying, sustainable\n\nbusiness model for the search engine, consumer, and content partner. For\n\nexample, this past Wednesday we announced our strategy to focus on verticals\n\nwith high commercial intent, such as travel, and offer users cash back on\n\ntheir purchases from our advertisers.\n\nGosh, Google somehow seems to be able to run a sustainable business model and\n\ndevote some energy and resources into indexing books and scholarly information,\n\neven if those generate little to no revenue. They do it in part because they\n\nthink it’s good business to provide all types of searches, not just those that\n\nwill earn them money.\n\nIn the middle of a search war, I can understand that a “distraction” like\n\nbook and academic search might seem like something to Microsoft that has to go.\n\nHowever, Microsoft’s not hurting for cash to keep it up, if it wanted. Dropping\n\nit makes Google seem less like the evil giant working for its own benefit that\n\nMicrosoft would hope people view it as."
