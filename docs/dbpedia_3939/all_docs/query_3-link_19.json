Yes Type of site Search Engine Owner Microsoft Created by MicrosoftLaunchedMarch 8, 2006 (beta)\n\nSeptember 11, 2006 (1.0)\n\nSeptember 26, 2007 (2.0)Current status of siteInactive; rebranded as Bing\n\nLive Search (formerly Windows Live Search and MSN Search) was the name of Microsoft's web search engine, designed to compete with industry leaders Google and Yahoo!. It was subsequently rebranded as Bing.\n\nThe search engine offered some innovative features, such as the ability to view additional search results on the same web page (instead of needing to click through to subsequent search result pages) and the ability to dynamically adjust the amount of information displayed for each search-result (such as just the title, a short summary, or a longer summary). It also allowed the user to save searches and see them updated automatically on Live.com.\n\nLive Search was one service among many such web based services, such as Instant Messenger, Blog, Email, file sharing, and others. While dozens of search engines retired from highly competitive search engine market over the decades, Bing (rebranded Live Search) has maintained its popularity due to Microsoft's continuous progress in technology and market strategies.\n\nHistory\n\nMSN Search\n\nMSN Search was a search engine by Microsoft that included a search engine, index, and web crawler. As of September 12, 2006, MSN Search is now Live Search. Live Search offers users the ability to search for specific types of information using search tabs that include Web, news, images, music, desktop, local, and Microsoft Encarta. MSN Search aims to make its over 2.5 billion worldwide queries each month \"more useful by providing consumers with improved access to information and more precise answers to their questions.\" A configuration menu is available to change the default search engine in Internet Explorer, but the selection is sometimes criticized as being limited, and a custom URL cannot be entered without installing an add-on.\n\nMSN Search was first launched in the fall of 1998 using search results from Inktomi. In early 1999, MSN Search launched a version which displayed listings from Looksmart blended with results from Inktomi except for a short time in 1999 when results from AltaVista were used instead. Since then Microsoft upgraded MSN Search to provide its own Microsoft-built search engine results (list of web addresses with samples of content that meet a user's query), the index of which is updated weekly or even daily. The upgrade started as a beta program in November 2004 (based on several years of research), and came out of beta in February 2005. Image search was powered by a third party, Picsearch. The service also started providing its search results to other search engine portals in an effort to better compete in the market.\n\nLive Search\n\nThe first public beta of Live Search was unveiled on March 8, 2006, with the final release on September 11, 2006, replacing MSN Search.\n\nOn March 21, 2007, it was announced that Microsoft would separate its Live Search developments from the Windows Live services family. Live Search was integrated into the Live Search and Ad Platform headed by Satya Nadella, part of Microsoft's Platform and Systems division. As part of this change, Live Search was consolidated with Microsoft adCenter.\n\nIn the roll-over from MSN Search to Live Search, Microsoft stopped using Picsearch as their image search provider and started performing their own image search, fueled by their own internal image search algorithms.[1]\n\nOn March 21, 2007, Microsoft announced that it would separate its search developments from the Windows Live services family, rebranding the service as Live Search. Live Search was integrated into the Live Search and Ad Platform headed by Satya Nadella, part of Microsoft's Platform and Systems division. As part of this change, Live Search was merged with Microsoft adCenter.[2]\n\nA series of reorganizations and consolidations of Microsoft's search offerings were made under the Live Search branding. On May 23, 2008, Microsoft announced the discontinuation of Live Search Books and Live Search Academic and integrated all academic and book search results into regular search, and as a result this also included the closure of Live Search Books Publisher Program. Soon after, Windows Live Expo was discontinued on July 31, 2008. Live Search Macros, a service for users to create their own custom search engines or use macros created by other users, was also discontinued shortly after. On May 15, 2009, Live Product Upload, a service which allowed merchants to upload products information onto Live Search Products, was discontinued. The final reorganisation came as Live Search QnA was rebranded as MSN QnA on February 18, 2009, however, it was subsequently discontinued on May 21, 2009.[3]\n\nRebrand as Bing\n\nMicrosoft recognized that there would be a problem with branding as long as the word \"Live\" remained in the name.[4] As an effort to create a new identity for Microsoft's search services, Live Search was officially replaced by Bing on June 3, 2009.[5]\n\nThe Bing name was chosen through focus groups, and Microsoft decided that the name was memorable, short, easy to spell, and that it would function well as a URL around the world. The word would remind people of the sound made during \"the moment of discovery and decision making.\"[6] Microsoft was assisted by branding consultancy Interbrand in their search for the best name for the new search engine.[7] The name also has strong similarity to the word 'bingo', which is used to mean that something sought has been found or realized, as is interjected when winning the game Bingo.\n\nAccording to the Guardian \"[Microsoft] hasn't confirmed that it stands recursively for Bing Is Not Google, but that's the sort of joke software engineers enjoy.\"[8]\n\nQi Lu, president of Microsoft Online Services, also announced that Bing's official Chinese name is bì yìng, which literally means \"very certain to respond\" or \"very certain to answer\" in Chinese.[9]\n\nWhile being tested internally by Microsoft employees, Bing's codename was Kumo (くも),[10] which came from the Japanese word for spider (蜘蛛; くも, kumo) as well as cloud (雲; くも, kumo), referring to the manner in which search engines \"spider\" Internet resources to add them to their database, as well as cloud computing.\n\nBefore the launch of Bing, the market share of Microsoft web search pages (MSN and Live search) had been small. While Google retains the largest portion, Bing's market share increased to overtake Yahoo![11]\n\nFeatures\n\nInterface features\n\nDaily changing of background image.
