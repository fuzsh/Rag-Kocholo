        "text": "Ian Davis\n\nPost by Bill Samuel\n\nPost by Ian Davis\n\nIs it a coincidence that I hear echo's of one of my favourite religious\n\nanthems in the above?\n\nhttp://www.users.on.net/~arachne/lotd.html\n\nDid you notice that Sydney Carter wrote both of them?\n\nNo I hadn't.. What I noticed was the same spirit, underlying pattern,\n\nand the emphasis's on you, and the said he's. Also so the same imagery..\n\n\"can't kill the devil\" versus \"hard to dance with the devil on your back\".\n\nI don't think I noticed this consciously -- what I first noticed was a\n\nsense that the song I didn't know, was bringing to the forground a song\n\nthat seemed to say -- sing me.. sing me. The scorn of the ones who would\n\nlock the doors and throw away the keys is also present in both songs.. in\n\none saying they wouldn't dance, and in the other saying that they wanted\n\nto bind the light.\n\nSo the obvious question was whether Sydney Carter was a Quaker. Would\n\nseem a contradiction in many peoples eyes for the silent folk to be\n\nwriting verse.\n\nI note belatedly having now done a search for Sydney Carter than he died\n\nearlier this year. Still not sure if he was a Quaker, though it says that\n\nhe served with Friends' Ambulance Unit in WWII. His attitude seems at\n\nleast Quakerly...\n\n\"Faith is more basic than language or theology. Faith is the response to\n\nsomething which is calling us from the timeless part of our reality.\n\nFaith may be encouraged by what has happened in the past, or what is\n\nthought to have happened in the past, but the only proof of it is in\n\nthe future. Scriptures and creeds may come to seem incredible, but faith\n\nwill still go dancing on. Even though (because it rejects a doctrine)\n\nit is now described as \"doubt\". This, I believe, is the kind of faith\n\nthat Christ commended.\"\n\nhttp://www.stainer.co.uk/carterobit.html\n\n\"If any church could come to holding Sydney's allegiance, it was the Society\n\nof Friends, with its rejection of dogma, and its reliance on personal\n\nexperience and social activ-ism, and its affirmation of God's presence in\n\nevery human being.\"\n\n...\n\nIn 1960, Sydney wrote his most controversial song, Friday Morning. I believe\n\nit was also one of the most profound. In it, the robber, crucified with\n\nJesus, cries out:\n\nIt was on a Friday morning that they took me from my cell\n\nAnd I saw they had a carpenter to crucify as well.\n\nYou can blame it on to Pilate, you can blame it on the Jews,\n\nYou can blame it on the Devil, it's God I accuse.\n\nIt's God they ought to crucify, instead of you and me,\n\nI said to the carpenter a-hanging on the tree.\n\n...\n\n\"Bibles, legends, history are signposts: they are pointing to the future,\n\nnot the past. Do not embrace the past or it will turn into an idol.\"\n\nJesus was central to his experience, but not, in his words, \"the official\n\nJesus - but the Jesus who is calling you to liberty, to the breaking of\n\nall idols including the idol which he himself has become.\"\n\nYour holy hearsay is not evidence\n\nGive me the good news in the present tense ...\n\nSo shut the Bible up and show me how\n\nThe Christ you talk about is living now.\n\n...\n\nMore than 30 years ago, Sydney had written his own epitaph:\n\nComing and going by the dance, I see\n\nThat what I am not is a part of me.\n\nDancing is all that I can ever trust,\n\nThe dance is all I am, the rest is dust.\n\nI will believe my bones and live by what\n\nWill go on dancing when my bones are not.\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1170682,00.html\n\nNow that is an epitaph, I'd happily put on my own tomb stone..\n\nIan"
