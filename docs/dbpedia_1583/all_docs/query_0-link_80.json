        "text": "NASHVILLE — Joy Oladokun was sitting in her backyard, stoned and scrolling Twitter when a Christian pastor appeared in her feed. As the child of Nigerian immigrants who raised Oladokun and her sisters in the church, she’s no stranger to religious doctrine and, as a queer person, no stranger to feeling as if it’s being weaponized against her. Still, she couldn’t look away.\n\n“Those guys always pop up and I’m like, ‘What are you doing here?’” Oladokun, 31, said on a January afternoon, seated at her dining room table wearing a Nirvana T-shirt, an electric mug and a weed vape within reach. Then she let out a laugh — a distinct, cartoonlike thing perfect for defusing uncomfortable situations. “And they are always saying something stupid, because that’s an option to them.”\n\nOladokun didn’t want to fight online, though — she’d done plenty of that. She wanted prayer. The words to “Somebody Like Me,” the first song she wrote for her new album, “Proof of Life,” arrived in an explosive spurt: “Can anybody say a prayer, can anybody light a candle for somebody like me?” In her home studio, with its walls covered in Beatles and Beyoncé posters, she quickly laid down the bulk of the song. “It felt like the beginning of something,” she said.\n\nIn 2021, working mostly from home in Nashville as the Covid pandemic raged on, Oladokun went from a relatively unknown songwriter to one signed to a major label: Her streaming numbers and profile had skyrocketed thanks to key placements on television shows like “This Is Us” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” and a grant from YouTube for Black creators. “In Defense of My Own Happiness,” Oladokun’s major-label debut (and third album overall), featured a collaboration with Maren Morris, and suddenly she was making the late-night rounds. With her conversational songs about religious trauma, mental health and navigating the world as a Black, queer person, she was a salve for a time when hope felt scarce and the most urgent, effective music acknowledged life’s pain, and didn’t just dish out toxic positivity."
