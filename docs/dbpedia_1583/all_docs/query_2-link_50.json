        "text": "Academics\n\nA Christian-focused liberal arts and professional studies institution, George Fox University provides students with \"faith-based and rigorous academic programs paired with stimulating and satisfying student life.\" George Fox brings faith, service and experiential learning together in its \"Christ-centered campus\" in Newberg, Oregon \"that strives to teach students the love of God and the importance of service to others through finding one's passion and through hands-on experience.\" Students prize the school's \"high job-placement rates,\" its \"exceptional student-to-faculty ratio,\" the \"accessibility of additional educational\" resources, and the \"Christian values taught in every class.\" Professors \"are incredibly patient\" and take the time \"to get to know their students,\" and even go so far as to \"open up their homes\" to make students feel welcome. Students also rave about \"juniors abroad program,\" which allows any third year student to take advantage of a partially-subsidized study abroad program. \"The Honors Program here is one of the best there is,\" and student are very complimentary about \"the high standard of academics\" at George Fox. Students feel that their professors \"have a deep passion for the material they teach\" and create a healthy and safe environments for students to ask questions,\" \"which makes learning more enjoyable.\"\n\nStudent Body\n\nMany George Fox students are interested in serving the community by \"[reaching] into the corners of society and [helping] the outsiders.\" One undergrad describes her fellow students as \"friendly, insightful, diverse, constructive, [and] quirky (I mean, we're set in the Portland metro area).\" Demographically, \"George Fox is home to primarily home to white, middle-class young adults\" who are a \"blend of very conservative and very liberal\" practicing \"evangelical Christian.\" Students note that \"in the last several years [. . .] the university has greatly improved their pursuit of [ethnic and racial] diversity.\" Students are \"passionate\" about their education, but they \"are not so individually-focused on their own success\" that they become competitive with one another. A typical George Fox student maintains a \"desire for the success of others and [sees] this school as a body of students all working towards the same goal of a higher education.\" \"Because this school is founded on Quaker principles, everyone is a friend,\" one student explains.\n\nCampus Life\n\nCampus life at George Fox is full of opportunities to \"get involved in a wide range of activities, clubs, departments\" and self-organize to \"make art [and] create outside writing and art groups.\" \"There is typically something to do almost every day if one puts in the effort.\" The city of Newberg offers \"three coffee shops, a bakery, and some other various restaurants that many students hang out in.\" For more options, students travel \"the half hour to Portland for shopping and entertainment,\" or hike in the surrounding Northwest Oregon countryside. George Fox is good about hosting events on campus, like \"concerts by school musicians and visiting bands, movie nights, outdoor activities like capture the flag (called Bruin Brawl), [and] dances (winter and spring formals, plus a Sadie Hawkins dance).\" Athletics are fairly popular, and \"a large number of students that participate in intramural sports year round.\""
