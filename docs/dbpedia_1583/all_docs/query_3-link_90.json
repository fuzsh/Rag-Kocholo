        "text": "Local musician George Fox curates the Songwriter’s Soapbox at Chico Feo every Monday night\n\nby Miranda Steadman | Contributing Writer\n\nLocal musician George Fox has been stirring Folly’s musical pot every Monday evening at Chico Feo for almost a year. Inspired by Folly artists, Fox has served up raw original music right from the source: local outlaw musicians.\n\n“I’ve made so many friends that I didn’t expect to meet. I’ve seen so many connections of artists being made,”says Fox. He draws inspiration from local lyricists such as poet Juliette Branch.\n\nWhen Fox asked Branch what she’s doing for quarantine she said: “I’m saving books, seeds, and bullets, baby. Everything’s gone straight to hell since they closed the roller rink.”\n\nHer words inspired a song on Fox’s new album that he’s currently recording with his band Big Stoner Creek at Fairweather Studio on Sol Legare, which is owned by percussionist and Bert’s Market owner, Omar Colon.\n\nThe Hinges’ Josh Roberts is producing the album, which features fiddle player Donny Lewis, who has played on three of bluegrass legend Doc Watson’s albums and resides in Asheville. Other musicians featured on the album is Big Stoner Creekers bandmate Jamie Crisp on standup and electric bass, Jessie Pritchard on guitar, and Fox’s son Jeremiah Fox on drums.\n\n“Well, it started small and humble in the midst of a quarantine with willing people to sit in the cold around a heater and listen to original music and poetry,” says Fox of the Soapbox evolution. “I like seeing performers step outside of their comfort zone to share original music.”\n\nFox likes the process of creating something from nothing. He enjoys seeing how the weekly event can build a community by encouraging a vibe similar to the “Shakedown Street” outside of Grateful Dead shows, with local artists vending, such Holy City Heart of Gold jewelry and family-owned Swamp Cats Merchandise Company, which has groovy swag and shirts for sale. Visual artists also like drawing and sketching art during the Soapbox.\n\nStandout Soapbox performers from the past include Danielle Howle, who has played with Bob Dylan and Ani DiFranco. Another, Robert Lighthouse, is a Swedish blues guitar player. Local songbird Whitney Hanna’s Fancy Koolaid and River Tramps, who were just passin’ through, are memorable Soapbox acts as well.\n\n“Songwriter’s Soapbox is unique because of its lean towards original music,” says Fox.\n\nSoapbox star musician Gracie Trice wrote a song for Songwriter’s Soapbox one afternoon and came back the next week with seven more songs.\n\nErel Pilo, a local musician who will be featured at Songwriter’s Soapbox this month, has played as far as Brooklyn, Paris, and Tel Aviv. She recently made an appearance at Soapbox on the ukulele with a keyboardist and pedal steel player.\n\nAnna Crosby is a Soapbox performer who shines while sharing her music on Monday nights, while Isabella Corrozza is a captivating local comedian who has shared her original material at Songwriter’s Soapbox.\n\nSome grassroots Songwriter’s Soapbox artists include writer and actor Fleming Moore and his brother, Wesley Moore.\n\nMusician and veteran Jeff Lowry has been there since the beginning and he’s grown,” says Fox. Guitarist Zane Moody is one of the most asked about artists who plays the Soapbox, according to Fox.\n\nAccording to Fox, we can look forward to more good acts and more magic in September.\n\n“Every week it seems we have someone new join the family,” says Fox. “I wish I could take credit for all of this but I have all of the artists to thank for that.”\n\nOn Monday, Sept. 6, Sam Rae will perform on cello. Rae, who has performed with Grammy winner Brandi Carlisle, hopes to collaborate with birthday boy Jason Chambers of whom Fox has dubbed, ‘The oracle of John’s Island.’ Chambers is a talented local poet who writes hope-driven poems about the power of nature.\n\nChico Feo’s recent seating expansion has made it easier for people to listen and hangout while watching local artists perform.\n\n“Chico Feo is a magical place,” says Fox, calling the popular outdoor venue a “spiritual vortex,” claiming he’s played some of his best shows there with the band The Edge of Americans. “If you believe in the possibility of magic, you start seeing it.”"
