        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- With the passing of legendary singer-songwriter Eric Carmen, we’ve lost one of the great balladeers and power-pop progenitors of our time. The Cleveland native’s work with the Raspberries and as a solo artist is essential and foundational for much of what’s been heard in popular music for generations.\n\nYou can hear direct influence in everyone from Kiss, Cheap Trick and the Cars, to the Bangles, Matthew Sweet and Teenage Fanclub. Adjunct influence lands in the likes of Material Issue, the Plimsouls, Jellyfish and Weezer.\n\nWe look back at 10 of Carmen’s most impressive songs and the deep impact they’ve had on music fans everywhere.\n\n1. “All by Myself”\n\nThe prototype for all future heartbreak ballads, “All by Myself” was Carmen’s first single from his eponymous debut solo album in 1975 after leaving the Raspberries. Loosely based on the second movement of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Opus 18, it’s fortified by the “Let’s Pretend” chorus Carmen wrote/recorded with the Raspberries in 1972. This tearjerker was notably covered by Canadian singer Celine Dion on her 1996 album, “Falling into You,” which sold 32 million albums worldwide. She performed the song on the subsequent tour. Can you say Cha-ching?!? “Myself” was revisited in the 2010s with Fox’s hit musical comedy-drama TV series, “Glee.”\n\nOh, and for what it’s worth, this little-known guy named guy named Frank Sinatra sang it, too.\n\n2. “Hungry Eyes”\n\nThis anthemic power ballad anchored the dance lesson sequence in the 1987 smash-hit film “Dirty Dancing” starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. The song, which was recorded at Beachwood Studios in Beachwood, peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The “Dancing” film and soundtrack were ubiquitous over the next couple of years, becoming a bona fide pop culture phenomenon. A second film soundtrack “More Dirty Dancing” was launched in 1988, along with the “Dirty Dancing: Live in Concert,” tour featuring Carmen, Bill Medley, Merry Clayton and The Contours. The tour played 90 cities in three months.\n\n3. “Go All the Way”\n\nPerhaps The Raspberries’ most famous song, “Go All the Way” was released as a single in 1972 and was later included in their debut album. Led by a driving guitar riff and Carmen’s soaring tenor, the song has been a power-pop genre staple of classic-rock radio. Because of its risqué sexually suggestive lyrics for its time, “Go All the Way” was banned by the BBC. Carmen’s quintessential Raspberries classic had a renaissance in 2014—thanks in large part to Peter Quill’s “Star-Lord” and his “Awesome Mix Tape Vol. 1″ in the film adaptation of Marvel Comics’ “Guardians of the Galaxy.”\n\n4. “Make Me Lose Control”\n\nOne of Carmen’s biggest solo hits, though it’s curious if it would have blown up without “Hungry Eyes” happening first? He made the most of a good thing by pitching the song to producer Jimmy Ienner, who had recruited him for “Dirty Dancing.” This song name-checks “Stand By Me,” “Be My Baby” and “Uptown,” and has an acapella chorus-coda that would make the Beach Boys green with envy. The video doubles down pop culture with Kid Leo announcing the song and visuals that pilfer heavily from George Lucas’ pre-galaxy fixation, “American Graffiti.”\n\n5. “Almost Paradise (Love Theme from ‘Footloose’)”\n\nThe duet sung by Mike Reno (Loverboy) and Ann Wilson (Heart) was written by Carmen with “Make Me Lose Control” lyricist/collaborator Dean Pitchford. Because of the success of both of their respective bands, Reno and Wilson were approached to record the duet for the Kevin Bacon-led film, “Footloose.” In 1989, Carmen and Merry Clayton released a cover of the single, which had been performed regularly as a part of the “Dirty Dancing” live concert tour. Television soap operas “All My Children,” “Guiding Light” and “Santa Barbara” all used “Almost Paradise” to underpin character romances on their respective shows, too. Bigtime hit.\n\n6. “Boats Against the Current”\n\nLeadoff single from the 1977 album of the same name, this warbling piano-driven ballad has lyrics inspired (in part) by F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.” A soft-rock classic, Carmen’s hit was covered by Frankie Valli the same year on his “Lady Put the Light Out” album and on Olivia Newton-John’s album “Totally Hot” the following year. Patti LaBelle recorded the song for her 1981 album “The Spirit’s in It.” The tune laments the relationship of two romantics whose love has gone cold, but the song reconciles before we know if rekindling the relationship will happen. Lots of longing here.\n\n7. “Never Gonna Fall in Love Again”\n\nThe lush second single from Carmen’s self-titled debut solo album peaked at No. 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1976 and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart. It topped both charts in Canada. The hook-laden ballad has a grand, sweeping orchestration and melody (once again) largely inspired by Russian composer Rachmaninoff—specifically the third movement of Symphony No. 2. No question Carmen’s balladry was at its best when his achy, breaky heart was on display, but the single’s b-side rocker “No Hard Feelings” has that certain Raspberries’ je ne sais quoi to it.\n\n8. “Haven’t We Come a Long Way”\n\nA snazzy-jazzy disco mover from Carmen’s 1978 album “Change of Heart” feels like a breath of fresh air on this list. This track finds Carmen really belting it out with upbeat feeling after all that weepy balladry. The song would feel right at home on an Elton John album, with Kiki Dee popping out for good measure. The album never quite measured up to the success of his first solo album, but there are songs on “Heart” that have downright Beatlesque flourishes, with energy and melodies that would feel like home for fans of John, Billy Joel or The Carpenters.\n\n9. “My Girl”\n\nAnother upbeat (if not sing-songy) pop smash that takes the best parts of ‘50s and ‘60s crooners and carries it forward with Brian Wilson-like aplomb and Lennon/McCartney amour. Beatles Lennon and Ringo Starr were Raspberries and Eric Carmen fans; Starr had Carmen join his “All-Starr Band” tour for a spell. With Starr on drums, Jack Bruce (Cream) on bass, Dave Edmunds on guitar and Simon Kirke (Free, Bad Company) co-drumming. The All-Starrs never played this one on the road (too many other hits to squeeze in!) but this feels like a tune that would have turned crowds inside out.\n\n10. “I Wanna Be with You”\n\nIt was no secret that Carmen was a Beatles fanatic. He was also a musical prodigy, the youngest violin/piano student to ever attend the Cleveland Institute of Music. With the Raspberries he had the chance to indulge insurgent talent, intuitive songcraft and power-pop jones in tracks like “I Wanna Be with You.” The song was a key moment in the band’s reformation show in 2004, which ultimately led to the group’s first tour in three decades. If anyone tells you this song isn’t every bit as good as the Beatles’ “I Wanna Hold Your Hand” and “She Loves You,” it’s prudent you check under their mop-top."
