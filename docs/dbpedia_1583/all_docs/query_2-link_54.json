        "text": "The items on this page may show up on any of the Articulation or Baccalaureate Core tables as well as the Single Course Search Tool.\n\nLDT (lower division transfer): When there is no class at OSU that is equivalent to a lower-division transfer course, it is given the designation of LDT. This means it transfers, but may count as an elective or something else as determined by your advisor.\n\nUDT (upper division transfer): When there is no class at OSU that is equivalent to an upper-division transfer course, it is given the designation of UDT. This means it transfers, but may count as an elective or something else as determined by your advisor.\n\nLD: Some lower-division transfer courses may be equated to upper-division OSU courses and the credits will be regarded as lower-division, and will not count toward the required 60 upper-division credits.\n\nUD: Some upper-division transfer courses may be equated to lower-division OSU courses, the credits will be regarded as upper-division.\n\nBI LD1*: courses are considered to be taught at the nonmajors level at OSU. These courses are similar to OSU's BI 101, 102 and 103 courses though they do not match any single course closely enough to be articulated as such. Any LD1* course that is NOT taught online will fulfill a Biological Science (with lab) requirement of the Baccalaureate Core - see the Baccalaureate Core list for details. Online courses are not approved as equivalent, particularly related to the laboratory science requirement in the Baccalaureate Core. If any part of a course is taught online, the online laboratory and other content would need to be reviewed separately for approval. If the lecture and lab are taught as separate courses, both must be completed for a biological science baccalaureate core requirement to be fulfilled. If you have additional questions about how LD1* courses count in a specific major, please contact your major advisor or Brock McLeod, Chief Advisor for Biology, at [email protected].\n\nBI LD2*: courses are considered to be taught at the science majors level at OSU. These courses are similar to OSU's BI 211, 212 and 213 courses though they do not match any single course closely enough to be articulated as such. Any one LD2* course that is NOT taught online will fulfill a Biological Science (with lab) requirement of the Baccalaureate Core - see the Baccalaureate Core for details. Online courses are not approved as equivalent, particularly related to the laboratory science requirement in the Baccalaureate Core. If any part of a course or series is taught online, it would need to be reviewed to be approved. If the lecture and lab are taught as separate courses, both must be completed for a biological science baccalaureate core requirement to be fulfilled. Students who need to complete the entire BI 211, 212, 213 series as part of their major at OSU should complete the entire sequence before transferring or wait to take the sequence at OSU If you have additional questions about how LD2* courses count in a specific major, please contact your major advisor or Brock McLeod, Chief Advisor for Biology, at [email protected].\n\nAn asterisk (*): indicates the course meets a Baccalaureate Core (Bacc Core) requirement. Following is a listing of the Bacc Core areas that you may see on your report. If a course is articulated equivalent to an OSU course, use the online general catalog to determine which Bacc Core requirements will be met."
