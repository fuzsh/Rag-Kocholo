I also cover some traditional folk songs too. My own material mirrors the artists I cover. My singing voice has been likened to Richard Hawley so if you can imagine Richard covering The Streets of London done in a reggae style, that's me. I am self-sufficient, with my own PA etc and I'm happy to travel in Europe and Scandinavia with my own vehicle. Any further and I would fly with guitar and effects pedalboard.\n\nI have played in bands and I have my own backline, should the need arise. I have recorded a couple of my own songs with a top producer, of which I am very proud.\n\nThank you."
