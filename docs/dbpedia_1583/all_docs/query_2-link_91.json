A high school transcript is required for admission, and SAT or ACT scores are optional.\n\nApplication Deadlines:\n\nNov. 1 (Early Action)\n\nFeb. 1 (Priority Decision)\n\nMy time at Fox has been such a transformative experience. Before coming here, I was more reserved and felt out of place. I discovered a community here and friendships that will last. I will always remember the kindness of each person I came in contact with. The professors have truly shown what it means to Be Known and to be encouraged and supported in my academics and personal life."
