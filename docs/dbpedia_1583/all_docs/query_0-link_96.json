He and his wife, Jordan, live with their dog Oscar and four chickens. Joe enjoys fishing, exploring new ideas, and getting absorbed in meaningful conversations with those around him.\n\nTranscript:\n\nKris Gamble: Welcome everyone to the Relational Spirituality Podcast. My name is Kris Gamble. I’m your host for this week’s episode, and today I am joined by one of my good friends, Joe Spiccia, or Spix-ee-eye-ay as Siri likes to pronounce his last name. This week we are chatting around the theme of community. The Book of the Quarter at Larger Story is Real Church and it talks about what really is church and community therein.\n\nJoe has been somebody in my life that has been an instigator of meaningful community, almost just out of what seems like the overflow of his being. Hopefully we can mine a little bit of his mind and dig into some of those stories and just see what God might have for us through this time.\n\nI wanted to start off and give a little context. I met Joe about 20 years ago. I don’t remember our specific meeting, but we met at a church that we were attending and did the youth group of through all of our high school years.\n\nWe also, for the latter part of my high school years, went to the same high school and occasionally, and speaking of community, I’m a year older than Joe so a grade ahead of him, but some of my guy friends from church, as a part of what we just somehow fell into doing, we played poker many nights on the weekends throughout high school. Joe, I think you made it to some of those occasionally. Is that correct?\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah, I’ve never won a dollar ever.\n\nKris Gamble: Well, yeah, we don’t condone gambling here anyway, so that is maybe a sign of your purity, Joe.\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah, that’s what it is.\n\nKris Gamble: Joe and I were actually roommates for a few years after college into our late twenties and early thirties.\n\nI would say that we refined each other into the godly men we are today, which helped us to meet our lovely wives. So, community is important because if you’re single, it’ll help refine you to meet your spouse.\n\nJoe, as I mentioned, has helped form some communities, and I’m just going to briefly touch on them here and hopefully we’ll jump in a little bit deeper.\n\nSomewhere after college, around 2014, 2017 ish, Joe invited myself and a bunch of other mostly single folks to a thing we called “Cabin Weekends,” where we would rent a cabin and just have meaningful community centered around the thing that united us, our faith and they were like at a lake or by a river and we’d go fishing and hang out, and it was really just a place that I felt like I belonged in my latter twenties. We have made such great memories and have such wonderful stories out of that.\n\nAnother place where really meaningful community happened was, around the same time, Joe and I were looking to move into the downtown Atlanta area, so he, myself, and a few other guys ended up getting a house. And that was a place where, for a number of years, we really got to spur one another on and be accountable and just talk about what different seasons we were in, in our spiritual journeys. It kind of became a place of a community gathering, where we’d have, you know, house parties, not like wild, crazy ones, but bonfires in the backyard.\n\nIn and around that time we were part of a men’s group that Joe also initiated, and that just took the whole community and spiritual formation and intentionality thing to a deeper level. So, that’s kind of why we’re here, Joe, is to learn from the master. Really, I’m just glad you’re here. We’ve thought through some questions to talk about and I’m looking forward to digging in with you.\n\nAnything you want to say or share after that long intro?\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah, I think so. So first off, I’m grateful to be on this podcast with you, Kris, and I actually call Kris, Cris-ph. I don’t know why, but he calls me Joe Spix-ee-eye-ay, I call him Cris-ph. There is like a lot of little consonants that get added in there at the end, so if you want to start calling him that, you’re totally welcome to. Kris has – he’s talking me up and all that stuff, but my first caveat is that I feel like a complete newbie when it comes to these things. I think part of that is actually because I’ve never done them just alone. When I think about all those stories you’re telling Kris, especially like moving into the house, Kris came to me and we met at Little Azio on Howell Mill Road in Atlanta, and he was like, I’m looking for some guys to live with, but I’m not just looking for just a roommate situation, I want a community.\n\nI think there’s an element of Kris bringing this intentionality too, not just trying to live within a house, a place where you sleep and eat and all that stuff, but he wanted an actual community of people that were intentional about pursuing their faith, pursuing friendship, pursuing community.\n\nI think there’s something that we will hopefully get into today, about, this isn’t all on one person’s shoulders to foster community. There is an initial initiative that’s taken by one or two people, but what I think really leads to these things is people realizing, I want this, and let me find some other people who also want something. We don’t even have to have a name for it. We just know there’s something that we want, and we hope it looks something like this. And then that drive’s there, that’s attractive, and other people want to be a part of that. And I was like, yeah, that sounds great. I want to figure this out, and I just knew a bunch of people who were kind of in a similar stage of life.\n\nThere’s multiple roles to be played in a healthy community. I’ve really learned that in this process of being friends with you, Kris, and all the other guys that we’ve met and lived life with along the way. So yes, I guess all that to say, I’m grateful and I love talking about community. I love dreaming about it and also living it, and I think that’s probably the most important part of it. So yeah, I’m looking forward to the questions and what we’re going to get into.\n\nKris Gamble: Thanks for sharing that. Yeah, it isn’t on one person’s shoulders, and I’m glad you made that distinction. So, jumping in, what is community, and maybe more specifically, what would you say is meaningful, effective christian community?\n\nJoe Spiccia: I’ve been reading a book right now with a group that I’ve been a part of with my church here in Marietta, Georgia. I’ve read it a couple times actually, and I really have enjoyed the depth that it’s been pulling out of me. It’s called Emotionally Healthy Spirituality. The author is Peter Scazzero, and he has a couple quotes that I’ll reference here, but this one came to mind. He said, “Community is not just a group of people who agree with each other. It’s a diverse group of individuals who are committed to loving and serving one another.”\n\nI think it’s so easy to think about community as just, what’s fun and who are the people that are like me that we’re going to get along and have a good time together.\n\nThat’s a beautiful thing too, that’s just a very base level. I’ve realized that that’s not bad either, because it does lead to this other thing, which is committing a commitment to loving and serving other people. But I guess the diversity of a group as far as, we just don’t all agree on everything, we have conflict, that’s normal community, and I think it’s easy to shy away from that. I guess there’s a lot of different definitions of what community is and what it can look like, but that’s one that really stood out to me.\n\nI think another really big one for me is that community is a gift from God. It is truly a gift of Him inviting us into sanctification. We’re all born into a family, which is like a type of community. Some of us aren’t in that family for long and other ones have an amazing family that we’re with for the rest of our lives. God gifts us either that type of family, or leads us into a family that allows us to see who we are meant to be.\n\nI think that, for me, is what community is, is an opportunity and a gift to explore who God made me to be. In that process of identifying that better and better, as I get older and experience more community, I am able to do the same for other people. It’s this real back and forth, and it’s this cycle of this really beautiful gift that, the more we open ourselves up to other people, the more they will open to us, and the more we grow closer to God.\n\nI think, obviously, there’s all kinds of community; you could have a really negative community too. That’s where I think the biblical version is something to strive for. A community that pursues the heart of God and allows God’s heart to pursue them. It’s a process that I think of, of God making us more like Him. He uses other people around us to do that, whether they’re totally different than us or they’re similar in their backgrounds and their personalities.\n\nThere’s a lot of thoughts there, but that’s my idea of community.\n\nKris Gamble: When you said community is a gift from God, I thought about how community is also a reflection of God, God being in community with Himself. And so when we are fellowshiping – fellowshiping is a christian-ese word for hanging out and having fun. But when we’re enjoying one another, we’re actually reflecting the joy that God has in Himself and it’s on display through us.\n\nThose are some Larry Crabb derived ideas that I ascribe to. I also think community could be a label or a term that defines a group of people that are somehow interconnected; I’m in the community of Savannah, or the community of Wilshire Estates – which sounds much more fancy than it is – yet I might not really know anybody all that well in my neighborhood community. There is something about a biblical community that is worth digging into.\n\nJoe Spiccia: I’m going to throw out a couple quotes here.\n\nI had one more quote on this that is in line with what you’re talking about, but it was another Peter Scazzero quote from the book. He says, “We can’t grow in isolation. We need others to become who God has called us to be.” And that was sort of what I was searching for, that community is a catalyst for spiritual, emotional, mental growth. It is God’s gift to us in that way. From the biblical perspective I personally see this as God’s heart – like you’re saying – He’s always lived in community. God never had isolation with the Trinity. I think His heart is just that His creations that are made like Him would also be in community as well. So, defining that through scripture, I’m curious what you think about that.\n\nKris Gamble: Well, Hebrews 10:25 essentially says don’t forsake gathering together.\n\nAlso, Acts 2:42-47 is probably worth reading. “And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.”\n\nI think this is one of the best pictures of the New Testament church that we have in description.\n\nA couple things that we can draw out of it: a biblical community is gathering and they are studying God’s word. They’re enjoying one another, and I think mixing in some food and prayer is an important part of a christian community. The don’t forsake gathering I think is just a call to not be isolated.\n\nJoe Spiccia: I’m just thinking, how does that look for where we are in this culture right now? It can sometimes be difficult for me to distill down the Church of Acts to my life.\n\nSome of those takeaways, like get together and eat food together, very basic things, right? But that’s the building block; we all need certain things, so let’s go do those things together. And then at the same time, there’s a deeper element of prayer in singing worship and of being intentional about worshiping the Lord and about pursuing God together.\n\nWhether we’re going to read scripture, or we’re going to talk about scripture that we don’t understand and that we have problems with. I think there’s a really honest version of this for me. I don’t know that I am always there and ready to say, let’s go do a service project for the Lord today, or whatever it is; maybe it doesn’t feel like I’m hearing from the Spirit, or God doesn’t seem like He’s talking to me. But just being with other people and other believers, being with somebody like Kris – for me, in these settings there was a conviction level, there’s an intensity and a passion here, and there’s a newness to the perspectives of different members of the community that have always driven me closer to God, wanting to know God more, wanting to explore Him more.\n\nThat’s what Acts 2:42-47 really looks like in my life; being around others and letting the Lord use them, or letting Him use me in moments where my faith is strong. Kris, I think you used an example of this in our guys group at one point, an analogy of a fire and how some of us are really close to this fire and we are warmed by it, and we walk into a crowd where it’s colder and that warmth really reaches those people – other christians maybe, or maybe it’s not christians, but there’s something attractive about that. We want to be around the warmth. I think, trying to distill it down in my own experience, it’s often looked realistically like that.\n\nKris Gamble: One thing I love about you, Joe, is your humility and honesty; even now readily able to say, “When I picture community, sometimes it’s not as perfect as we see in the scripture here, and that is my reality and my real life.” And it’s everyone’s, it’s mine too. Nobody’s able to live out every time you get together studying the word and prayer and singing songs. I don’t even know if it’s necessarily that that has to be every time you gather, but a picture of some amount of their gatherings.\n\nI wanted to just dig in on the same kind of theme about markers of biblical community, and popping over to another scripture, James 5:16 says, “Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.”\n\nI love this verse. It’s a hard verse because there can be fear and shame associated with sins, and there’s so much cultural baggage around confession and why do I need to do that? A culture that often touts accomplishments and independence. But I think good, biblical communities are, marked by the humility of confessing our sins.\n\nThis scripture is telling us such that we may be healed. It could mean a physical manifestation, but I imagine on some level it’s the release that comes from letting light shine on the dark places. In particular when you do that, doing that as – in Larry Crabb-ism – looking ugly in the face of love, realizing that you still are loved, even though you’re showing something ugly, is a healing thing.\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah this is the verse that really takes community to, not even the next level, it’s the next level beyond that. I think there is a bit of a cultural stigma to the word confess. Why do I need to confess?\n\nLet’s talk about it from a human perspective of being honest about where you are. Maybe you are doubting God or maybe you are struggling with some sort of sin that’s more overt; maybe you’re looking at pornography or whatever it is. There’s a tendency we all have to hide that stuff, to push it down and keep moving. I think that’s part of our Western culture, let’s just be productive, let’s just move through it, let’s not talk about it. But God invites us into that and He does that through community.\n\nA lot of times, my idea of God has been shaped by seeing others confess and Him letting me see people humbly stopping and saying, this is something I’m trying to hide from myself and from others and from God, and I need to let it out there, I need to bring it into the light.\n\nIt’s so refreshing. I think, for me at least, to be a part of that where you can be totally honest – scary honest – you are taking a big risk by sharing something with other folks. And it is so rewarding to feel that moment of, we love you. I love you, even though you have all these things and you have these doubts.\n\nThat is God’s heart. If that happens in community, and I tell Kris something really hard that I’m going through and he accepts me and he loves me and he tells me he’s going to pray for me and he wants to be there by my side, that’s powerful. That shapes my vision of who God is and how He stands for me.\n\nFrom a person to person perspective, it takes time to cultivate this, but it is so life-giving and so rewarding to be a part of a community that fosters honesty and confession to one another, and it just makes you want to confess to God because you know that He is the only one that’s capable of forgiving you, but also the one who loves you more than any anybody else.\n\nToday I had a small group meeting with the guys group that I’m in, and we were talking about this weekend. I just had a tough struggle with my wife.We were having a hard time and we’ve had a hard time at various points in our relationship.\n\nOne of them reached out to me and said, “Hey, how can I pray for you?” She was about to walk through the door, so I’m like, “Oh gosh. Well, I need to be humble. I need to be calm. I need to not be defensive, which is my tendency, and I need to be straightforward and honest and I need to listen.”\n\nAnd literally, they prayed for that and that happened, and there was just a real restoration for us – me and my wife – and there’s something about that. That in itself is a confession, I think. The way I’m thinking about confession is that if you would rather not tell other people about it, and then you decide to tell them, that’s a confession, whether you’re trying to hide something wrong that you did or just something that you’re struggling with.\n\nBeing able to submit that to other people and to dive into it, I think is an opportunity for God to answer the prayer in whatever way He wants to answer it. That’s us, depending on God, and it takes humility and that’s His gift to us.\n\nObviously, I’m passionate about this; being open and honest about where you are with other people and knowing that that is something that can really bring us closer together, but also bring us closer to our creator.\n\nKris Gamble: Right. Yeah. When we were back at the question of what is community, sort of three words we’ve added to our tagline for the Relational Spirituality podcast come to mind: belonging, being known and becoming. I think one of the things about being honest – confessing is how we are known in our good light, but also in our fallen humanity side. And how known are we if only the good side that we present of ourselves to others is held up, and that is all people see?\n\nI chatted a little bit on my previous podcast about brotherhood, we chatted a bit about confession there, so if you want to get even more, check that one out. One of the other markers of community, and we kind of touched on it even in Acts 2, but 1 Corinthians 14:26. What then brothers, when you come together, each one of you has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, an interpretation. Let all things be done for the building up or the edification of the body.\n\nI think edification is a goal of community. I think one thing I extrapolate out of this verse is that there can be different gifts that members of the body have and that we bring into the community and that they are to be brought for the building up of all of us. Some of that is singing hymns – we’ve had poetry reading nights – or just just reading nights together, lessons, sharing teachings of what God has put in our hearts.\n\nAny thoughts there?\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah, I think about our guys group that we had and we rotated who facilitated the group, and each time we gathered somebody new, they took us through something that they were learning or scripture of some sort. I think more than just, “everyone’s got to facilitate, that’s the rules.” I think what it did was it helped us understand ourselves a little bit more as individuals too. Think, what is my gifting? I think a lot of people don’t know that, and it is a great place to learn that in a safe community of other people to say, “You know what? I don’t really know what my gift is, so I’m going to try and facilitate or lead a conversation or I’m going to do something creative.” It’s a place to be encouraged in those things. Like, “Man, you really brought that, that was really helpful. I really took a lot away from that.”\n\nThat’s where you learn what your giftings are from the Lord, in that community. It’s okay to not come into it knowing like, what, what am I, what am I gifted with? because that’s part of the process of just being with other christians is like learning that about yourself, which is another gift really.\n\n[00:27:58] Kris Gamble: Right. In Acts 2 they sold their possessions such that they gave to everyone that had need. It makes me think about the marker of taking care of each other and serving one another. To your point, as you are serving, you realize, “Hey, I’ve got a gift for this hospitality thing, or a real passion for reaching our neighbors.”\n\nGreat point to say that community is also just a place to learn what God’s deposited in us, and the way that we can serve and love each other as we seek to follow His commandment to serve and love each other.\n\nAs you said earlier, there’s a ton of scripture on community. 1 Thessalonians 5:11, “Therefore encourage one another and build one another up just as you are doing.” And Hebrews 10:24 just before the one that says, “don’t forsake the gathering,” says “spur one another to love in good deeds.”\n\nAny other markers you want to share on?\n\nJoe Spiccia: There’s just so much. I feel like these are all tied together. There is just so much commonality in each of these verses. But in encouraging one another like it says in Thessalonians and building each other up, that really ties in with confession if we’re going to be vulnerable and real. A way to encourage someone in that, is by listening to them, by hearing them out. It’s not trying to give them advice, it’s being there for them and encouraging them, “Hey, you’re not alone in this. You’re not the only one to struggle with this. You’re not the only one to have these questions,” or whatever else it is. That’s encouraging. It’s not always, “You’re a great singer.” There’s just so many elements of each of these verses that all just tie in together. I feel like a big part of it is just understanding God’s heart and being in a place with other people and letting that come out of you.\n\nI guess that’s one of those things that you live and you see it happen. The mystery of community is there’s not a vision of community that is going to be accurate. There was one other quote from, I think it was Dietrich Bonhoeffer in Life Together. He said, “The person who loves their dream of community will destroy community, but the person who loves those around them will create community.” Sometimes we can overcomplicate things. We can say, this is how it should be and I need to make sure I line all these points up. And that’s suffocating. People don’t need that to thrive. They need someone to love them to thrive and to know that they’re safe and loved and heard and listened to. So, if in doubt, simplify, and just try and love the people that are around you.\n\nThat’s a very broad point, obviously, but I think it can be easy to get lost in the shuffle. So, anyway, that’s my 2 cents on that.\n\nKris Gamble: Well, it makes me think of another verse, which is admonishing one another or exhorting one another. At the end of James it says, roughly, if you see your brother in error and correct them, you win your brother and save his soul, so to speak.\n\nNot meaning you literally are saving him, but delivering him from that sin. There’s a place for correcting in love. It is loving to say, “Hey Joe, the way you responded to your wife just then wasn’t what I believe is how you actually feel about her.”\n\nI am guilty of the same thing so many times, but I’d encourage you. There’s such a delicate finesse to correcting each other; there’s no formula for how any of these line up or are lived out. I loved your point about simplifying it by just trying to love.\n\nJoe Spiccia: Even admonishing somebody comes with trust. To be able to do that for somebody, to say, “Hey, you’re in the wrong here,” that is earned, and you earn that through loving somebody well, listening to them, caring for them, and they trust you. All of that stuff really just comes back to the simple point of loving someone well, and that a good way to love someone is to correct them if they’re wrong.\n\nKris Gamble: It’s worth noting why community is important other than in a christian sense. It’s biblical and God inspired and all the points that we just mentioned to be known and be loved. But it’s also a place to exchange ideas if you’re in a diverse community, exchange culture, learn, and grow. I think one of the main points that I wanted to make here is something you said early in our conversation about how it helps us to become who God made us to be.\n\nAnd it’s kind of intuitive to say that, but how does that actually happen? Just because you show up at community? I think, what’s underneath that? How do you become who you were created to be in community? That community is reflecting back to you how they’re experiencing you. So, you know, Joe, I experience you as somebody who has a gift for hospitality, A gift for allowing people to feel trusting of you and safe with you.\n\nI think that reflection that the community offers back to us highlights and draws out things that maybe we weren’t even able to see ourselves. That self-awareness affords us the opportunity to cultivate those things or to change in the admonishing sense away from who is not our most truest self, which is the sin side of us, to our most truest self, which is the God-honoring side of us.\n\nJoe Spiccia: I’ve learned so much about who I am in community, for sure, and who God has made me to be. It’s a gift that I don’t think you can get anywhere else. I’m not saying that people are God, but God speaks through people and you can hear God’s heart for you through people who are in your community. There’s discernment involved with that, of course, but it really does change how you see yourself, to be a part of a true community, a good community, a rich community where love is the baseline.\n\nAlso, in a very real way, there is opportunity with people you trust to say, “Hey, how do you perceive me?” That’s a really hard question to ask, and I’ve been blown away by people who have actually asked that of me. I have such mad respect for people who are willing to do that because it’s super vulnerable, but it also says, “I trust you. You’re a trustworthy person Joe,” and that means almost as much in itself as whatever I would share with them. So yeah, that’s a super cool element of community.\n\nKris Gamble: Getting a little more practical, how did these communities actually form, and particularly as somebody that’s been an instigator of community, what kind of thoughts do you have on that?\n\nJoe Spiccia: If I think back on the house thing, I think it was you who said, “I want to do this and I want to do this in this way.” That really did inspire me and led me to, I think, take on more of that approach with my own desires of community in the future.\n\nWith the guys group, I remember feeling this deep desire to be growing in my faith and this conviction that my faith was stagnating at that time. I wanted something more than what I had.\n\nJust listen to that voice which I believe is God saying, “This is who I’ve made you to be, go out and pursue this.” And then reaching out to other people and being vulnerable. It was scary, I sent an email out to 10 or 15 guys and just said, “Hey, here’s the thing. I’m feeling isolated. I’m feeling like I’m not pursuing the Lord. I love you guys and I want to get to know you better. I want you to know me. Is there anybody else who’s feeling that way?” It’s a vulnerable thing, to open that door, but, at least in my situation, it really paid off and it really spoke to other people who are feeling the exact same way.\n\nI think a constant desire that people have is community, they just need someone to start it. That listening and then taking a step forward felt like the way that I’ve been able to pursue community, and then it ends up being this colossal, super meaningful thing in my life that I wouldn’t trade for anything.\n\nSo it’s totally worth the risk, I guess, is what I mean by that.\n\nKris Gamble: Was that email to 10 or 15 people, were those randos, or were those people that you had a decent depth of relationship with already?\n\nJoe Spiccia: They were all people that I knew; some of them I knew really well, and some that I didn’t know very well, but mostly we knew each other. I would say that most of us have this fun element of, we love being around each other. It doesn’t have to be this challenging, hard thing necessarily, that I’ve got to put myself through this hard situation in order for community to happen.\n\nI think in some ways it should start with, I want to enjoy other people. And in this case it was people who I already enjoyed, but even in that it still can be scary. It was a little bit, because you don’t want to put yourself out there, and then everyone’s like, “Nah, I don’t really feel that, I’m good or I’m too busy,” or whatever.\n\nThat’s part of my personality too, I can be a people pleaser and I really want people to like me, to agree with me. It makes me feel comfortable. So anytime I do that, it is a risk for me. But thankfully these are all guys that I knew and they were on board as well.\n\nKris Gamble: I’ve said this – maybe on another podcast, I can’t remember – that a currency of relationship is trust, and that maybe there was a trust coin out there that you had with some of those guys that you invited to cash in and say, “Hey, would you want to try this thing that may or may not fail?” It doesn’t necessarily have to happen with that currency coin of trust, but I think in church groups where communities form, there is a trust currency with the organization forming it that provides this stability for people who don’t know each other that well to be able to have some level of safety or the right ingredients to step out and try something new like this that can be risky.\n\nI wanted to say that the email you sent casted a vision. Something that I think helps create biblical communities is a shared vision for what this thing is that we’re hoping to be a part of, belong to, and ultimately journey spiritually together towards.\n\nI remember in those early days it ended up almost everybody you emailed showing up to the first meeting. In those first couple meetings we did do some vision casting where we were like, what do we want this to be? How do we want to structure it? Do we want to go through a book? Do we want to go through some sermon series? We somehow ended up on what you mentioned earlier, having a different person bring the Word, so to speak, each week. It was fun and beautiful and different. We did that for at least a couple years, meeting every Wednesday night.\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah. With this group that I’m in now at my church, the point is to train us in how to have our own group that we will lead and facilitate, of other men. One of the things that our leader said was, we encourage and it’s a good thing to co-lead or find somebody else that you’d want to do this with. I think that is an approachable way that’s awesome. In something that somebody might think, I need to do this on my own and I need to be the leader, or there needs to be one leader. It doesn’t have to look any certain way.\n\nThere’s a beauty to, like you said, having a shared vision where me and Kris just get together and we say, “I don’t know if I’m going to do this on my own, but are you interested in this? I trust you and I know you, let’s both talk about it and figure it out. Let’s message some other guys that we know or whatever that looks like.”\n\nThere’s all kinds of ways and none of them are the right way.\n\nKris Gamble: I really like that point because Jesus sent the disciples out in groups of two – again, I don’t know that that has to be mandated to do it that way – But there’s a sense of accountability to staying true and one person not dominating when two people are leading out in that. In fact, two is a community of two that you are wanting to invite more into, in a sense. So, kind of multifaceted.\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah. To some of the other points about how it’s formed, that shared vision obviously stands out.\n\nThe commitment is another piece that is tricky. I think that’s probably harder because you can’t make people commit to something, right? You can set up a structure and say, here’s what we’re going to do, are we all good with that? But we found in every group I’ve ever had or been a part of, there’s always people that will come sometimes and won’t come other times. Maybe there’s people who have bailed on groups in the past completely. And that’s just hard. It’s hard to deal with and it feels like your group’s falling apart or your community doesn’t have any structure to it. But it’s such a balance to be found; people have lives and they have their own things going on and their own agendas and priorities, but also we need structure if we’re going to make this thing happen. That’s where I do feel like either it’s co-leading or finding another group of maybe two or three other people who are on the same page as you, rather than saying, okay, I’m going to try and hold this thing together, because that is the burnout recipe for sure.\n\nI think if anything, it’s more important to either be a facilitator for a church, so there’s that structure there that’s provided by your church, or you’re going into it with other people so it’s not just you trying to hold everything together.\n\nKris Gamble: To that point, I think the maybe more biblical or scriptural example, and I’m open to your thoughts on this, is that community exists within the context of a church such that the community is subject to the leadership and oversight and mentorship and vision of something bigger than itself. Again, it doesn’t always have to be that way. We had a wonderful community, some guys that all belonged to different churches coming together.\n\nJoe Spiccia: My last point on how it’s formed goes back to honesty and a shared struggle. A really good community doesn’t necessarily have to be founded on, here’s the guy that’s got it all down, and then here’s the people who want to get it all down that are going to follow them. Oftentimes it seems like it’s almost the opposite. It’s, I am struggling here and I need help and I need community and I need more of the Lord.\n\nThat in itself will bring people together. And then from there, maybe there’s a common struggle or maybe there’s a group that forms to help someone else and that just leads to deeper community. Maybe it’s not a formal thing, maybe it’s an unstructured community, but that’s a good place to start too, I think.\n\nKris Gamble: Yeah. To that honesty and shared struggle, where have you seen community in your life done effectively and maybe conversely done ineffectively?\n\nJoe Spiccia: I guess there’s been a lot of different versions of community.\n\nKris Gamble: Give us the juice, you know what I mean? Those raggedy institutions.\n\nJoe Spiccia: The juice, yeah. I think a lot of times where I felt like this doesn’t feel like a good community to me is when it feels like there’s a really strong pressure to be there, and if you’re not, then you shouldn’t be a part of this group anymore. Or, the rules win, so if you don’t follow all the rules, then you’re out. Or, what we talk about has to be confined to these certain things. Again, it’s the structure versus the openness. I feel like what has most often gone wrong in my situations of community is structure gets way more of a priority and there’s just not any grace, and people don’t want to be a part of that, it’s just not fun and it’s not a picture of who God is and how He sees us. So I would say those are the main ineffective examples. I don’t want to name a particular group, but I think we’ve all been a part of a group like that.\n\nI just, I do feel like there’s been so many versions of effective, but to me it comes down to, are we talking about what’s real here? Are we still enjoying each other? There’s a couple elements to it where we’re actually getting closer to each other in this process.\n\nThe guys group that we had was a version of, this is cool from a time perspective, – it’s been a couple years and we’re still meeting. How awesome is that? – but also from a depth perspective that we were able to get closer to each other and get closer to the Lord in the process and encourage each other and all those things we already talked about.\n\nAnd then at the end to be able to celebrate and not be like, oh, it’s dead we’re not meeting anymore. God must be mad about this, or there’s something wrong with us. But to celebrate what God gave us in that period of time, I think is a sign that that was healthy; there was something effective about that.\n\nAlso, for a church facilitated group or a church sponsored group, the structure there that feels effective is that I’ve walked away with a feeling of, I’m cared for, I feel more known, I feel trusted that people want me to to be a part of this church on the whole, that they want me to lead in some sort of capacity.\n\nI think there’s all kinds of different ways you can feel like it was effective, but the ineffective sort of comes back to the overly structured .\n\nKris Gamble: I’ve led some groups and I can have this tendency to try to over control the outcome or want to make sure that everyone’s sharing their story at some point, or that everyone shares, otherwise they’re not being authentic.\n\nI think that pressure is such a good word. That pressure that people have to be a certain way, look a certain way, and the leader’s temptation to control it can quench the work of the Spirit\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah, definitely. I think that’s a really good example. Another one is, do I feel listened to, or are people just vying to talk to get their point across? That’s a hard balance because some people are talkers and some aren’t. I think it oftentimes does come down to the facilitator or the leader and whether they’re able to navigate the different personalities in a group. That’s a really tough thing to do and I’ve seen it done well and I’ve seen it done poorly and I’ve probably been on both sides of that.\n\nOne last thing on that; I’ve been a part of a group that was what I would call transparent. And transparent is great. It sounds like you’re taking some risks, but really you’re just saying what is a fact or what is easy versus vulnerability, which is really taking a risk by saying it. That, to me, is what brings things deeper. Transparency is just surface level and pretending that you’re really going deep.\n\nThat’s a tough thing to distinguish and I think you can really only truly do that within yourself. That’s another one that I feel is ineffective as a participant in a group, at least you can say I’m really not sharing. I’m really not letting people know me even though I’m sounding like I am.\n\nKris Gamble: Another thought that comes to mind is asking questions and being curious. I think these are things that will draw out creating a space to feel heard. For people to be curious, but not necessarily leading so much as to where you think you want the conversation to go.\n\nFor example, if you shared something and instead of being curious and saying, can you share more about that? Saying, well, don’t you think that made your wife feel …?\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah.\n\nKris Gamble: You’re asking question but you’re really just trying to make a point and that’s not curious.\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah. And it’s not safe either. People will sense that. I shouldn’t share anymore because this is how it’s getting dealt with. So, yeah, that’s a big one.\n\nKris Gamble: Well, I think you’re somebody that makes people feel safe. I’ve seen people from all kinds of backgrounds and political beliefs and ideologies feel safe around you. I wanted to try to uncover, what do you think it is? Obviously the Spirit in you, and love, but what do you think it is that offers that safe place to people?\n\nJoe Spiccia: Part of my background is that I have often felt unsafe. I felt like I needed to prove myself, so community for me was this sort of a safety net where – probably to some unhealthy extent – I found my worth in community. I think as that’s advanced, I’ve continued to really subject myself to other people and hear them take big risks with me.\n\nThat’s probably the biggest part from a human to human perspective is somebody saying, I’m going to share something with you because I trust you. Maybe I didn’t even earn their trust, but they were willing to go there. That helped me see what a catalyst for depth and richness and community with other people could be.\n\nI think I’ve really tried to foster that in myself too as a result. Being a safe person I think comes from feeling safe, and that’s because other people have been that for me. It’s something that’s a byproduct of being a part of community with people who are healthy and know that you can be trusted and they can be trusted.\n\nKris Gamble: I think judgment is something that is not safe; judgment derived by thinking you’re better than somebody else because they struggle with X, and the reality is we’ve all fallen short and we all sin and we’re all capable. I don’t know if there’s particular scripture behind it, but I think we’re all capable of any sin given the right circumstances, whether it’s intoxication or just desperation. You know, who knows what we would do? We’re not above any particular sin, and if we go into group community or we go into relating and we have this pride or we have this judgment, that kills safety quickly.\n\nI think humility and lack of judgment invites that safety.\n\nJoe Spiccia: I’ve felt a fear of rejection for a lot of my life, and I think knowing that I’m not rejected by a person or a group of people, and that it’s not a one time thing for me. It’s been like a process.\n\nKnowing that somebody’s not going to reject me because I tell them this about myself, that is what has allowed the door for me to be open to becoming safe in that way because it’s been given to me. Once you have that and once you see that it’s possible, you want to be that person for other people too.\n\nI’m so grateful for those people in my life that have been non-judgmental of me. And you’re one of those people, Kris, for sure.\n\nKris Gamble: Well, thank you. The truth is, I’m often judgmental but I am not judgemental all the time and people see those times. Or I am being judgemental and it might be hurtful. Particularly with my wife, I judge her and she sees it and it stinks, but my goal is to not be judgmental. My goal is to be equal and equally as in need of a friend and of a savior.\n\nJoe Spiccia: You brought up the point of marriage and I was thinking about that a lot because that’s something that I can forget is a version of community as well. Maybe not the exact version that we’re talking about in the broader context here, but people talk about the sanctification of marriage, it’s in the same way there’s a sanctification of community and friendship and all these things. What’s hard about marriage is you can’t escape from those deeper things in yourself, they just come out like they wouldn’t in other relationships. It has been such a good, healthy, difficult community for me in marriage, but I want more of that. You know? I want more of that with my wife and I want more of that with my friends because it’s sanctifying me. It’s chiseling out all of these things that I didn’t even know were in me. I think at the end of the day, if the result of community is that for me, then I want more of it.\n\nKris Gamble: Maybe one of my final thoughts here is, the goal of community is not to not hurt each other. It’s not to be perfect or look perfect. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. It’s to be able to be at the place where you can be who you actually are, which is broken, and therefore going to hurt somebody, and yet still being loved and received and forgiven and repentant and keeping that commitment to continue on.\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah. Amen.\n\n[Kris Gamble: Well, anything else you think we didn’t touch on? I mean, we probably hit everything that could have been said about community by now.\n\nJoe Spiccia: Yeah, definitely. We didn’t even scratch the surface, but it’s a good start and I think it’s worth the time to think through, but also just to live; go out and talk to people and love people and know that community is surprising in the joys that it can bring and the growth that it can bring.\n\nIt’s the way that God intended it, for us to live in community. It’s a beautiful thing.\n\nKris Gamble: Well, thank you Joe for your time today; such a pleasure and I look forward to our next phone call when we do our micro community and catch up on our lives.\n\nJoe Spiccia: Let’s do it soon, man. This is fun.Thanks Kris.\n\nKris Gamble:Thanks Joe.\n\nCreating Space for Cross-Generational Conversations | Ep. 09\n\nShow Notes:\n\nWhat gets in the way of having meaningful (spiritual) relationships across generations? Join us this week as we connect with our friend Chad Ibach DMin as he shares with us some of the key insights from his doctorate research on studying the intergenerational spiritual relating.\n\nHe concluded in his findings that: fear, lack of skills, lack of trust, physical safety concerns, stress/busyness, sin/brokenness are the main obstacles to meaningful relationships. These conclusions are likely not a surprise, the answer to “What we do about these obstacles?” might surprise you.\n\nOrder The Pressure’s Off\n\nJoin the Reading & Relating Book Club\n\nThe Experience a Grand Adventure Course – Coming Soon\n\nChad Ibach’s Bio:\n\nChad Ibach is a senior executive assistant at Community Financial Credit Union in Plymouth, MI. Chad recently finished his doctorate of ministry in leadership & spiritual formation from George Fox University in Portland, OR. Chad has a passion to see others spiritually formed and challenged in their journey of faith. He and his wife, Hailey, both have a passion to see the hearts of others changed through spiritual formation in the church and their surrounding communities. They enjoy spending time with family and friends, watching survivor, and playing outside with their pup, Neville.\n\nTranscript\n\n[00:00:23] Kris Gamble: Welcome everybody to this week’s episode of the Relational Spirituality Podcast. I’m your host, Kris Gamble, and today I am joined by my friend Chad Ibach.\n\nChad a year ago this season finished up your Doctor of Ministry at George Fox.\n\nIs that correct?\n\n[00:00:46] Chad Ibach: That is correct. Yep.\n\n[00:00:47] Kris Gamble: Well done at, accomplishing that. I know a bit about it. His dissertation and it’s of particular interest to us. Chad wrote about and, created a project around the generational divide between particularly any generation above Gen Z and Gen Z. And we’ll dive into that here in a minute.\n\nI briefly wanted to touch on Chad is his family is good family friends with the Crabb family and they have a coffee shop near where they live just outside of Detroit in Northville called the Red Dot Coffee Shop. And. As I gathered it was the Red Dot Coffee shop and your sort of ministry work there that inspired this project.\n\nSo just for those that don’t know about the Red Dot Coffee Shop, could you share a little bit more of the vision behind it and, Yeah and, your experience\n\n[00:02:01] Chad Ibach: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, so my parents opened the Red Dot at least seven years this July, which is wild to think about. My mom had a vision to open a space for people to come and have conversations that matter. I helped start that in 2016. We opened up.\n\nI don’t work there any longer, but, it’s still going strong, and it’s been fun to support them not in a, as hands-on of a space any longer, but just being able to be, a little bit more behind the scenes support. They’re really trying to create spaces for individuals to come, whether it’s for the, staff to have conversations or whether it’s for the customers to be able to come in and have conversations.\n\nAnd it’s been really cool to see the journey over the last seven years.\n\n[00:03:04] Kris Gamble: And if you’re listening and you’re anywhere near the Detroit area check it out.\n\nIt’s a cute, restored, historic home and they do have these great little spaces and delicious coffee. Arita, Chad’s mom is just one of the sweetest ladies.\n\n[00:03:30] Chad Ibach: Yep. In Northville. So if you’re ever in Northville, Michigan, come by and have a good cafe meal is our most popular drink. And, but we got good and pour overs and the croissants are to die for. Stop by if you’re in the area.\n\n[00:03:46] Kris Gamble: Chad why don’t you give us just a little bit of overview of your degree and particularly your dissertation, the problem that you were working on by creating this project, and really what made you decide to do this topic, and then how did you arrive at the project that you decided to tackle this problem?\n\n[00:04:19] Chad Ibach: I got my Doctorate to Ministry in leadership and spiritual formation from George Fox out in Portland, Oregon. It’s actually Portland Seminary is the technical term of where my degree’s from, but through George Fox University. So how I got connected from Michigan all the way out to Portland.\n\nI did my master’s at Taylor University in Indiana. One of my colleagues there was getting her Doctor to Ministry from George Fox. And through conversation with her I just decided,that I wanted to pursue a doctoral ministry degree. Specifically in spiritual formation was a huge draw for me.\n\nThinking about my background and where I’ve come from and a lot of things that I’ve learned over the years that spiritual formation was the direction that I wanted to go if I was going to further my education. So that is how I ended up at George Fox. It was a three-year program.\n\nWe would go out to the Portland area. We were out at Cannon Beach for, we would go out once a semester for the first two years. The first two years were like coursework as well as drafting the dissertation. And then the final year was all dissertation work. George Fox moved away from the traditional dissertation model.\n\nMy dissertation is not a strictly written paper. It is a project. We produced a project portfolio rather than a specific written dissertation. Which was also a draw for me to go to Portland Seminary because I like to write. But to author a dissertation is a huge undertaking.\n\n[00:06:21] Kris Gamble: Daunting\n\n[00:06:22] Chad Ibach: Very daunting task. I was in a cohort model. We were the first ones to go through this project portfolio format. So we were definitely the Guinea pigs, but it’s fun to be the Guinea pigs at, some points and tiresome at other points.\n\nI was thankful to be able to do a project. Having a deliverable was part of our like, goal and requirement. That is better requirement was to have a deliverable, whether it is a book or a podcast or an app on the phone or a program for people to go through whatever it was.\n\nWhat was your other question? How did I pick the topic?\n\n[00:07:11] Kris Gamble: Really, how did you land on cross-generational relating and then move into the project that you chose?\n\n[00:07:22] Chad Ibach: That’s great. I, know you asked a couple, but I can remember throughout the program, we had to produce an mpo, which is a need problem or opportunity in our ministry context. My ministry context was when working at the Red Dot.\n\nWhile there which now I’m no longer there, but while there I noticed a lot of. just interesting dynamics between the generations. We would have a lot of generations, all generations coming into the shop as customers, but then also the cross generations within, among the staff. And I noticed one summer, I think after my first year at George Fox, I noticed just the difficulty that I was having connecting with the younger generation, like Gen Z specifically.\n\nWhich was fascinating to me because I feel like I have always been somebody who has been able to connect with all types of generations. But I’ve noticed in myself wow, like I can’t relate as well for whatever reason. And then I wanted to focus, specifically on my project.\n\nAround the idea of having spiritual conversations. As I noticed my own personal struggle with connecting with the different generations that’s what sparked my like curiosity about what could we do to help bridge that gap.\n\nThroughout the process I had a bunch of different focus groups with different generations just with people I was connected with at the time. I was also connected with Young Life. I was working with students and Gen Z as well. And so I was able to pull a group of students from Young Life.\n\nWe had a lot of younger staff at Red Dot well as different individuals who were either working with Young Life or different individuals that I was connected with in the area that were in the older generations, and we had different conversations over the three years what is gen Z looking for and what are older generations looking for that we are like not doing well or haven’t done well or just haven’t known how to.\n\nAnd I think that as I studied and thought through the process, it’s not just Gen Z, it is how do we create conversations among all generations. Cause I think it’s so important, this cross-generational idea having people who are older and younger than me on both sides, that we can do this journey together.\n\nI was thinking through all of that and produced a couple of different ideas. I landed on creating a six month like study going through different spiritual disciplines as well as different readings and different things like that, that I had gone through in my program as well as outside of that.\n\nAnd I created a hybrid program where it would be in person and online because now in and of itself to connect with all generations, people must be able to engage online because that is just the nature of what the world we live in is. But there is a huge importance of connecting in person as well. I created a six-month study, where one week you’re in person going through questions, different things like that. The other week you’re doing readings and engaging online via a platform to connect with one another.\n\nSo, I created a website that houses all of it. That is the project itself and how I landed on doing that.\n\n[00:11:54] Kris Gamble: I agree with something you said going back a little –\n\nThat the relating across generations, up and down is important. Why do you think it’s important?\n\n[00:12:12] Chad Ibach: I think that we just have a lot to learn from one another. At least in my own growing up, there was always this sense of separation. Of you are the older kids and you are the older adults, and I’m the younger kids and there is this separation between them, but I think that there’s something that you miss with that mentality.\n\nI think that we are all on this journey together and while yes, obviously people further along in their journey than me have different life experiences than I do and have learned and maybe aren’t in a different space than I am. But you can learn so much from people behind you and in front of you that to not have those types of relationships in your life, really is a detriment because. You just miss out on being able to connect in different journeys. Someone once told me just this idea of going into a conversation no matter who it is, and, there’s always a chance to learn from somebody no matter the age of that person. Especially viewing them having the life of God in them.\n\nThat there was a time in my life that there was, I was working with a youth group and some of these young kids, taught me so much of who got,\n\n[00:13:50] Kris Gamble: TikTok trends, right?\n\n[00:13:51] Chad Ibach: Yeah, definitely TikTok trends. I think this was before TikTok actually became like a big thing.\n\n[00:13:59] Kris Gamble: This was life before TikTok.\n\n[00:14:01] Chad Ibach: I’m trying to, it would have been in 2015, so eight years ago.\n\nI don’t know if TikTok was around then, maybe, but it wasn’t big yet. Yeah. I can think back on that time of life and realize like how much I gained from interactions with people who are younger than me. And I think I’ve always been somebody who has had, or respected people older than me, but I have not disrespected people who are younger than me. Any person along the journey can really, show me more of who God is, that it doesn’t matter the age. It just is the life of God and this person really can Yeah. Reflect something different that I don’t really see or know. So I think that’s why I think it’s so important and, that if you just stick with like your own little pack it’s a detriment, I think to you.\n\nAnd, obviously, it’s like easy to interact with people who are in the same season of life. That’s just natural. So I don’t think that’s a bad thing, but I think if you solely focus on I’m just gonna connect with my group of people, I think you miss out on other perspectives and, so I think. I think there’s a time and a place for both. Like obviously there’s a time and a place to connect with people who are in the same season of life. It’s like good to dialogue with one another about what are you going through with this situation? Or How do you all handle this?\n\nI wonder what this younger person thinks about this, or What did you know this older person thinks about this? I think that there’s value having all\n\n[00:16:16] Kris Gamble: It reminds me of something a mentor of mine brought up to me, which is he encouraged me to have at all times appall in my life as if I was a Timothy in my life, as if I were a Paul and a Barnabas as somebody to walk alongside Paul. And not only because there is a transference of knowledge and maturity and life experience.\n\nI guess that’s what I wanna say is that there’s also just real life experiences that happen at different seasons that are relevant to that age and stage that are not what you are, the way you’re thinking what you are having to go through. And yeah, just there’s like the spiritual transference of wisdom and maturity.\n\nAnd then there’s also just like cultural differences between generations. are valid and important for us.\n\n[00:17:34] Chad Ibach: For sure.\n\n[00:17:35] Kris Gamble: Let’s talk a little bit more about your dissertation. What was the maybe greatest insight or success that you had working on your project, if you don’t mind sharing, were the greatest challenges?\n\n[00:17:55] Chad Ibach: I think one of the biggest insights is what we’ve been talking about of the importance of this type of relationship. I think that, even though I haven’t touched it in a year, I look back and I think, wow, that’s still something that is so necessary and so important, and I also think that there’s an insight. The world is changing, culture is changing. My hope was with this type of project, with creating something that can bridge the gap that Christians, that the church would start to think through how do we continue to bridge the gap?\n\nIt’s gonna continue to change because of culture and the way the world continually changes. And so my, hope is even in myself that if I don’t do anything with the specific project that I did, that I learned something that I can problem solve to help this problem because I think that this problem.\n\nOf this intergenerational relationships will always continue to be because it’s, hard to relate to people who aren’t in your season. It, you can become so focused on what’s going on in your own life and what you are dealing with, that it’s easier to talk about with people who are going through the same types of things.\n\nAnd so then we forget to actually relate to the person who’s down the road for me or behind me in some way. I think the biggest insight being that it’s important to think through this problem. And while I might have come up with one type of solution that. There are so many different opportunities to create something like this as we continue to progress through time. That in each, I think in my context, this is what felt like would work, would be creating some type of program and website that would help guide through.\n\nAnd but I think through my degree and, my own journey and thought process of creating it, that I have the tools to be like, okay, how do I think through this type of relationship? What is going to not necessarily work, but how do we create a connection?\n\nI think it’s just learning to build connections and, creating a space for connections.\n\nThat is what is important. It’s being able to create that space. yI think that would be some of the biggest insights into the importance of it, creating spaces and just that this problem isn’t going to ever go away. It’s something that is a struggle to connect right. you’re in different seasons. It’s just the nature of the journey. And then you said the biggest challenge, right?\n\n[00:21:27] Kris Gamble: And it could be personally or with that you were trying to solve.\n\n[00:21:35] Chad Ibach: The biggest thing is just that it feels like it’s ever changing. We’ve talked about some, just this idea that culture is continually moving, generations are continually moving, and so it’s this target that is always moving, that you can never really hit a bullseye.\n\nIt used to be that generations were like 20 years or more, millennials were like from the early eighties, I think to the late nineties, and now it’s like the late nineties to, 2007 I think it was.\n\nAnd then now it’s, it just is shrinking. And so it’s oh man. We think we understand one generation and then it’s, oh, we’re moving on to the next new big thing, whether it’s TikTok or whatever, what’s the next be real. Exactly. And so, you know, what’s going to be the next massive thing?\n\nThat feels like one of the biggest challenges is that it’s an ever moving target. But with that, I think going back to one of the key insights is this idea of creating spaces for people to have conversation. It may look different each time and so it’s now it’s, figuring out, okay, this medium, whatever the medium was, worked two years ago and what is the medium going to be now to connect with this, next generation that’s only two years younger?\n\nAnd especially I think it feels hard as the older generations try to connect with the younger generations and not coming in as I know everything. Because I think that is like what I really found through conversations. Specifically Gen Z when I was working with them was, they didn’t, they don’t really want this top down type of relationship.\n\nThey really want it to be mutual, which is great. I love that. But I think that’s not how I grew up or we grew up.\n\nIt was this top down mentality and so how do we respect that? Also push to challenge it a little bit too. I think that would be like the biggest challenge is this idea that it’s continually changing.\n\nAnd then personally I went into this degree not really being in a ministry context, which is, or not in a traditional ministry context, which is like very not normal. Everybody in my program was either a pastor or a counselor or a, spiritual director, or something in that they had a specific ministry context where mine was genuinely like non-traditional of I’m working, I was working in a business. And using that as my ministry context. And so it just was interesting to think through think through the project in that mindset. And I was noticeably young doing the program. I was the youngest in my cohort\n\n[00:24:55] Kris Gamble: I was just thinking that shouldn’t be a business. A traditional ministry context in the sense that we’re ministering to our immediate sphere of influence.\n\n[00:25:13] Chad Ibach: Yeah.\n\n[00:25:13] Kris Gamble: As you go make disciples, so as you are going in the coffee shop, seeking to make disciples.\n\n[00:25:23] Chad Ibach: It was so interesting for me because I was the only one that was not thinking of it as in the church or in a counselor’s office, I was the only one that was thinking of it in a non-traditional sense. I was thinking of it from a business perspective of how do I create something that could reach even in a non-traditional sense. What was really challenging was, I was really having to think outside the box where a lot of other people were, not that they were not thinking outside the box because they were, but it just was this is my ministry context.\n\nThis is a problem that I see in my church. How am I going to fix this problem? I’m thinking of it from a business perspective. How am I going to solve this huge problem? I was not just thinking of in my own context, I was thinking of okay, I’m seeing this in my own life and that’s why I’m doing this, but I’m also seeing this in the global context. And that was part of their feedback too, how are you going to make it focused.\n\n[00:26:43] Kris Gamble: So you conducted interviews, right?\n\n[00:26:46] Chad Ibach: Yeah.\n\n[00:26:47] Kris Gamble: You uncovered root causes to this generational divide. What was your method for uncovering those and what would you uncover were the kind of key root causes? Here are some of my, some of the ones I discussed in my discovery session and one-on-one interviews, fear, lack of skills to have deeper, more meaningful conversations, lack of trust, physical safety, stress, busyness, brokenness.\n\n[00:27:24] Chad Ibach: So those came from one-on-one interviews with different individuals. And a lot of the one-on-one interviews were with older generations. And then I also had in the group interviews or process, and we, the group really was like, let’s go through this journey together of asking these like questions. And we’ll see where the path leads us. And then from that path, I would take that to my, like stakeholders where what we called them. And I would have a one-on-one interview of this is what we found.\n\nDoes this feel like it aligns? I had an interview with somebody who works at a university. I had an interview with somebody who is a director at Young Life. Having that type of conversation of okay, this is what we found is like root causes.\n\nDoes that seem like aligns with what you are experiencing I was interviewing these people one-on-one with Gen Z. And a lot of what we talked about in the group interviews with like fear and feeling like there’s this lack of connection, not being able to connect those types of things aligned and I think a lot of them too would have said that, just this lack of actual space, like having a, whether it was like a physical space itself or just the space, meaning the environment of trying to create something that felt like conversations could happen between generations.\n\nI think even talking with older generations than just millennials, because millennials were the next closest to Gen Z, obviously. And I think older generations would assume that we can connect with Gen Z and so it was interesting talking with older generations than millennials. I feel certain things that you feel as well of not being able to connect with them too. It’s not just you, because you’re older than me.\n\nI have felt that as well as I’ve wrestled with how I connect with younger generations, it’s going to be a continual process of not feeling like they connect.\n\nAmong the interviews it was this idea of what does it looks like to create spaces for, these types of conversations and these types of relationships to happen.\n\n[00:30:27] Kris Gamble: I appreciated what you said about being a millennial and it would seem that we could connect to the next generation below us. More easily, or easily. And I too experience challenges with that when I serve at my church’s high school ministry. Something that’s so funny to me. We have Wednesday night youth group and the first 30 minutes is dinner provided by the church, so everyone shows up on their own.\n\nTime officially starts at six and six 30 is when dinner ends, but it feels like the high school cafeteria all over again where you have your food and you’re like looking where to sit and oh, that’s the cool kids. I’m not sure I’ll fit at that table. So I was socially awkward and still am, but definitely didn’t feel like the kid that could relate as easy to just anybody or was seen as cool. So anyways, so I always find that barrier. Is there something I wonder, I don’t want to move too far from the fear or the root causes that, that we were just talking a little bit about, but something I was wondering as I was reading your dissertation was how much of this is a Gen Z problem?\n\nAnd we’ve been talking a little bit about it and how much of this is just a generation problem.\n\n[00:32:23] Kris Gamble: A function of different, cultures and different generations and then maybe even more, what I’m, I think about is how much of it to one of your root causes is. The Gen Zers are teenagers and early 20 somethings, and so maybe they just lack the tools to reciprocate conversation. They are teenagers and they’re still learning themselves\n\nAnd I have not had just as many conversations or haven’t had conversations. That life forces upon you when you to speak with professors and bosses and develop relational skills people that you as closely connected with sociologically\n\n[00:33:28] Chad Ibach: I think that’s a good thought slash question. I think even from my own story and journey as a teenager, I wasn’t gonna connect or engage with people older than me because it was, I was too afraid to what I wished would’ve happened more so was that they would’ve engaged anyways.\n\nI think that is what is needed. Regardless, as we move through time, it’s not just a Gen Z thing, like you said, it’s just a generational thing, period. I just happened to be, we happened to be in the Gen Z part of time and history, that was the context. But I think that this problem of this gap will continue to happen until we say I’m just going to engage because that is what you do. That’s just how you are a human and especially a, follower of Christ. I want to invest in people older and younger than me. And that’s what I think was happening when I was. At that youth group that I was talking about earlier was the older generations did seem to engage with this younger generation, these younger generations. It was extremely easy for them to talk about their emotions and their feelings and, different things that they went through during school.\n\nAnd, it didn’t matter if they were talking about it with their friends or if they were talking about it with people older than me. It’s we all must learn how to have conversations. It’s not something that just I mean there are people who it does come naturally. Our brains work in all different ways and so some, it just comes naturally to have conversations with people and, others it doesn’t and that’s okay too, but I think, how do we learn how to engage with each other? That is the thing, and I think, like you said, it’s not just a Gen Z problem. It is a generational problem that will continue to happen and that we have to push ourselves and push one another to continue to engage and continue to be willing to like, have uncomfortable conversations.\n\nNot because we’re having uncomfortable topics, but because sometimes it’s uncomfortable to engage others who are uncomfortable. Even in, for myself it’s not if we’re all uncomfortable. It’s hard sometimes you just want to go and eat your food and not talk to somebody. How do I say okay, “I’m uncomfortable here.”\n\nI’m going to choose to ask this person a question because. I care and I want to, I do actually want to know this person better. And that’s how you’re going to get to know them better is by engaging. I think you’re right. The church is going to have to want to engage with one another no matter what generation it is.\n\nWe will have to learn how to have conversations with people. And I think that’s like part of my hope with my project was to create a space. I think there’s not a lot of spaces to do that. In my own Story, there wasn’t a lot of space to like actually have conversations with all generations.\n\nIt was like, here the kids are gonna go over here and these people are gonna go over here, and then you guys are all separate. I think we have not done, at least in my own story, I know it’s not for everybody, but that I didn’t have a lot of opportunities to engage. And that’s what I hope to do differently moving forward in my own story and my own journey is to create spaces for people who are older or younger, doesn’t really matter, but just to create a space that invites people to have conversations.\n\n[00:37:48] Kris Gamble: When we’ve got our meal and we’d rather just sit down and avoid the awkward conversation. This past week I was looking around and I just ended up going to a table where leaders, people, my generation were sitting because that was the easier route. And in my heart, I want to sit with any of the tables of kids.\n\nBut I had this vision while you were saying, making your point of taking my food and going to the table, one of the tables and saying, Hey, I’d really love to get to know you guys and sit with you and I feel anxious about it or I’m afraid of being rejected, but I really would l I really long to know you guys and be friends with you.\n\nWould you embrace me while I figure out how to sit here and work through my own anxiety and have a chance to get to know you and just see what happens, from doing that. But whatI love about this conversation is even what you were saying was one of the key insights it’s a matter that like this crush generational thing is a matter of seeing the importance and making the effort.\n\nI look at that list of root causes, fears, lack of skills to have deeper, more meaningful conversations, lack of trust, physical safety concerns, stress in their lives, or busyness, sin and brokenness. And it could almost feel like we need to have an answer for all of those root causes in order to then be able to enter in and in order to make and establish the connection.\n\nAnd yes, there is things that can be done to build trust for them to cultivate more skills to address their fears, to feel more physically safe.\n\nBut what I’m sensing is that making an effort, a sustained effort, not a one-off effort. Oh Hey, would you want to go to lunch with me this week?\n\nNo. Okay. And then never trying again, but rather an intentional and sustained pursuit, obviously with some awareness that if they’re just totally not\n\nWanting to hang out, don’t be this creepy person showing up at their house. You didn’t come to lunch. What the heck?\n\n[00:41:05] Kris Gamble: I think part of it is just seeing the need and showing up. And just one more thought comes to mind. I feel like I’m continuing on here,\n\nBut one of the spiritual directors for Larger Story one day when we were talking about our upcoming courses, courses that have some crossover to your program, an online space that creates opportunity both online and in person.\n\nIf proximity affords the in person part to work through material that creates context for and structure for intentional time and direction and vision with the hope that it would be a means for one generation connecting with the next, one of the Spiritual Directors from Larger Story mentioned as we talked about potentially them being involved in this cross-generational digital course.\n\nHe said, “I’m too old to relate to that generation” and counted himself out. And I think I just for a moment accepted. Yeah, he is not that this person’s that old, but maybe he doesn’t have the skills to, or the like knowledge of what that generation, he even referenced not knowing.\n\nReally like how to relate with them or what they like to relate to. I think it is part of it. and I’m bringing the point to say that we, I think part of what keeps the gap in place generation after generation is counting ourselves out and saying, I cannot, I just can’t relate to them.\n\nI just don’t like those things.\n\n[00:43:45] Chad Ibach: I definitely feel that already.\n\n[00:43:48] Kris Gamble: And how do we not count ourselves out? How do you not count yourself out?\n\n[00:44:01] Chad Ibach: Believe that God and through the Holy Spirit has given you and equipped you with everything you need for this life and for godliness and to reach and love and pursue somebody that is different and doesn’t want to hear from you that much?\n\n[00:44:23] Kris Gamble: Anyways, but just showing up and trying\n\n[00:44:27] Chad Ibach: I think I even on the flip side of that, as I get older, like I, I do value older generations obviously, but I think as a teenager and as a early twenties, it was like, oh, like I can figure this out on my own, blah, blah, blah, whatever.\n\nAnd not really seeing the value. I think, that older generations want to count themselves out because they have been counted out so many times.\n\nMy hope would be that in some type of program or conversation like this is like we see the value in all of the generations that like young see the value in the old and the old see the value in the young and everything in between.\n\nAnd that like we can, and show this, mutual respect as well as mutual learning from one another. That I can learn about the tech things from these younger people, but then also the old people can teach me how to live.\n\n[00:45:36] Kris Gamble: Do business or relate to your significant other.\n\n[00:45:41] Chad Ibach: Exactly. Think that it has to be a mutual thing because I think there’s so much I even see it in my own life just like angst towards somebody telling me what to do or how to do it.\n\nBut really trying to shift that mentality to really respect that, like somebody has gone through the journey before me and I can learn from them because they do have value. Cuz conversations with older people they’re like, do people like your age even want to hear from, us and do.\n\nMaybe everybody doesn’t, but that is like what I hope to teach younger generations is that has value and everybody has a story. It doesn’t matter how old or how young you are that the life of God is in you. How can you learn that?\n\n[00:46:51] Kris Gamble: Yeah, and humble ourselves because we actually know of the infinite amount of knowledge to be learned in this world. What I know is like a grain of sand on a beach of knowledge and there is something that you know, Chad, or that those 10th grade guys know that I don’t.\n\nAnd I need to have the humility to say, how can I from you? And I wonder as I’m just saying that out loud, that does create trust and that does create more of a safe space because we’re humbling ourselves to say, I value you and I value your experience, and I value what God has done in your life. And I’m willing to show up and grow too.\n\n[00:47:53] Chad Ibach: It must start with yourself, right? You can’t, we can’t expect somebody younger or older than us to do what we hope them to do. It has to start with yourself of, humbling yourself to say I really can learn from this person regardless of the age.\n\nIt’s like I can learn something from them because, they have the life of God in them and, that it really can, God can show up in so many different ways that it doesn’t have to be a specific way. And you can only do that for yourself. You can’t make somebody else do that. It really must start with the individual and hopefully enough individuals in your context will start to do that.\n\nThat there will then be the cross. And then hopefully from there, spaces will be created because you, it starts with yourself to create a space that welcomes other people into that, maybe one other, and then maybe another, and then maybe another, and then you have a group of people that are willing to engage.\n\nI think that you don’t start your own story, in your own journey, it really is not going to work because it’s, you cannot force somebody else to want what you want.\n\n[00:49:34] Kris Gamble: We’re coming up on an hour in our chat here, and it’s been enjoyable and insightful. Maybe one of my final thoughts you mentioned, and it’s something we’re hovering around in our conversation most recently you mentioned the rhetorical question, do we create those spaces?\n\nAnd I just thought I’d ask, do you have insight maybe in addition to what we’ve just been talking about, or otherwise have you, any insight on h how do we create those spaces for those conversations to happen?\n\n[00:50:25] Chad Ibach: Yeah.\n\n[00:50:26] Kris Gamble: Should everyone build a program or do they need a program.\n\n[00:50:33] Chad Ibach: Nope. It’s too much Don’t do that. Do not do that yourself.\n\n[00:50:38] Kris Gamble: But yeah, feel free to just share what comes to mind as you think about how do we create\n\n[00:50:44] Chad Ibach: I think that the spaces that I’ve found in my life are just when yeah, you can gather with other people who are willing to be uncomfortable, are willing to ask questions, are willing to wrestle with one another are willing to engage with the present. And, thinking of what’s going on in each of the individual’s journeys. I think trusting the Holy Spirit that God will move in ways that you will never understand and, trusting that it’s a process that, like creating a safe space doesn’t just happen overnight in that like most people, including myself, have not had spaces where they feel comfortable to be themselves.\n\nI think that takes a long time and there is so much of each person’s stories that you just don’t know about that causes them to. Protect themselves or to not be themselves because that’s what they’ve learned throughout life. And so I think creating a space to unlearn ways that you’ve protected yourself, ways that you’ve tried to overcompensate or whatever and trusting that the Holy Spirit will do his work in those spaces and not forcing something to happen, I’ve had a group that we recently stopped meeting just through life circumstances. But we met for I think five years. We met every week. and that group shifted and morphed over the years, but a lot of our common thing was just coming around different thoughts and questions and really being able to show up each as individuals wherever we were on the journey and being okay with that.\n\nI think like finding spaces where you can be yourself and learn it’s okay to be yourself, cuz I think a lot of us don’t feel okay being ourselves. My little bit of insight of trying to create safe spaces is just letting it naturally happen.\n\nI think so often of life we try to force things to happen because of course, I desire more to see more spaces where people can have deep, meaningful conversations, but, Most of life is not deep, meaningful conversations. And so you just have to be okay with that and still trust that God is working and moving in your life and hope that you can find little glimpses here and there and that often it, it could be a group of one or two of you, but that is okay and that from there each of you can have one or two more and then it kind of spreads.\n\n[00:54:13] Kris Gamble: Yeah, I appreciate your comment about not forcing it because I think as humans, we can try to make it happen in our own strength, and so really\n\ntechnique is listening to the spirit and trying to follow his prompting timing and the word curiosity. Larry Crabbs used a lot and this season in Larger Story were the theme for a book club. The Pressure’s Off and so not trying to force it. Taking the pressure off is just what I wanted to draw a connection to few. Other Larger Story things. If you’re not a part of that book club it meets monthly and we would love you to join with us. We’ll do it for the whole year and then reevaluate.\n\nWe welcome them to join. It’s an online group with teaching and then breakouts based around whatever that book of the quarter is. And then thinking about spaces, we are to create opportunity for those spaces through the larger story courses that will walk through Larry Crabb material.\n\nAnd be releasing soon the first one Experience a Grand Adventure. It’s an awesome course. Keep your eye out for that. And Chad, anything you would like to share in conclusions?\n\n[00:56:07] Chad Ibach: Thanks for having me on. I appreciate it. I would just say, what does it look like to create spaces for other people and specifically for cross-generational relationships and just the importance of that and of people and trying to learn what it looks like to walk alongside one another in this journey we call life.\n\nHope that we can each find those spaces in our lives. And if you don’t have that, I pray that someday you will.\n\n[00:56:50] Kris Gamble: Indeed. Thanks everybody for listening and we will catch you guys the next week. And thank you, Chad, for joining us."
