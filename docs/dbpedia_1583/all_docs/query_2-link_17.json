        "text": "Robert George Fox\n\nA Writer of Reflection and Reaction\n\nBeen involved with music since I was eight and I am still enjoying the journey.\n\nProfile\n\nMusician\n\nGuitarist\n\nInstruments\n\nGuitar\n\nKeyboard\n\nVocals\n\nGenres\n\nBlues\n\nBlues\n\nReggae\n\nRock\n\nFolk\n\nJazz\n\nCountry\n\nCountry\n\nReggae\n\nR&b And Soul\n\nFolk\n\nRock\n\nJazz\n\nPop\n\nInfluences\n\nToo Many To List\n\nEquipment\n\nLd Maui Pa\n\n1 Takamine Electro Acoustic / 1 Electric Gibson\n\nParker Fly Yamaha Ibenez Marsall Vox Rolland Keys\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish\n\nWhat is music to you? What does it give you?\n\nMusic, either listening to others or playing on my own or better still, playing with others, fills a hole in my soul.\n\nWhat is your music dream?\n\nMy musical dream is to reach out to as many people as possible with my music. In a way I'm already living that dream. This journey I'm on is amazing and I don't want it to stop. To leave a legacy of my music after I'm gone would be the final wish.\n\nIf you could change the world - what would you start with?\n\nGet rid of poverty and conflict.\n\nWhich is the most memorable song from your childhood?\n\nCheckin On My Baby by Sonny Boy Williamson The Second\n\nWho are your favorite musical artists or bands?\n\nVery difficult to answer the mood I'm dictates the music. but here are a few Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, John Schofield, Frank Sinatra, Nick Drake, Billy Cobham, Bob Marley, Carla Dillon, The Beatles, B B King, Richard Thompson, Rolling Stones and Nat King Cole.\n\nWhat inspires you to make music?\n\nIt's an inner need. Sometimes in the middle of the night I will wake up with the start of a song, running through my head. So I get up and write a lyric or play some chords on my guitar and before I know it I will have the bare bones of a song\n\nWhat is the message you want to send with your music?\n\nSometimes a political statement, I lean to the left of politics and that comes out in my music. I see a lot of injustice in the world and I use my music to make a personal statement. Sometimes a story, funny or sad which is personal or somebody else's story Love songs can be very emotive but as I get older I see love as all encompassing rather than a \"lust thing\"\n\nHow do you feel when you perform in front of an audience?\n\nEcstatic. I know I'm very fortunate to be up there telling my stories through music. Any musician will tell you that It's a gift we have to share.\n\nHow do you see the musicians’ reality nowadays? What could be improved?\n\nAs I said in an earlier question. We are on a journey, some have a great talent for making music but a lot of luck is also required. There is obviously a change in which music reaches the public. We all want our music to be heard and with the advent of sites like Drooble and the ability to send music files all over the world so we can collaborate with like minded musicians is all part of this sea change. The improvement is in our hands, as individuals self belief and having the ability to see projects through to the very end.\n\nWhat do you think of Drooble?\n\nEarly days but I love what you are doing for musicians and songwriters. I'm already collaborating with others.\n\nWhat frustrates you most as a musician?\n\nAs a performing musician. Trying to be heard at gigs when there a few rowdies in! As a writer. Listeners who have a misinterpretation of what you are trying to say.\n\nDo you support your local scene as a fan? How?\n\nYes. I live in an area with lots of live venues and if there is a local act on and I'm not playing I will go and support them.\n\nWhat qualities should a musician nowadays have in order to get their music heard by a larger audience?\n\nA burning ambition to have their music heard and a self belief that they can go all the way. Material that will attract a fan base and nurture that fan base with info and new material that they will love. Get on the radio, have merchandise at gigs, CD's T shirts, mugs etc. A manager who they can trust!\n\nShare some awesome artists that we’ve never heard of.\n\nHenry Parker from Yorshire"
