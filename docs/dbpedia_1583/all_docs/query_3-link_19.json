Download and read or listen for free, or order a low-cost paperback. George Fox (1624-1691) is generally considered the founder of the Society of Friends (Quakers). As a young man, Fox could find no rest in the lifeless, outward Christianity of his day, seeing clearly that most believers professed far more than they truly possessed. This journal tells the story of his desperate search for the Truth, his discovery of a Christianity that stands in the life and light of Jesus Christ, and the ensuing fifty years of powerful ministry that turned the world upside down. This excerpt contains only the first three chapters of Fox’s journal, which focus on his early years, spiritual growth, and call to the ministry.",
