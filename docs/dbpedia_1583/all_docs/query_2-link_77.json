        "text": "When you hear someone say “Here Today, Here Tomorrow,” the first name that comes to mind for country music fans is George Fox, a Canadian country music artist who titled the third single from his third studio album “Here Today, Here Tomorrow.”\n\nIndeed, the song’s lyrics are timeless, as George repeatedly stated that he would love to be with his lover forever, which has remained true.\n\nOn another note, likening his lover to his music career, George continues to remain relevant 32 years (1991–2022) after the song’s release.\n\nThe struggle for future relevance is one of the most difficult battles we must all face in the journey of life. The fear of becoming irrelevant tomorrow is understandable; however, the thoughts/decision not to do anything can be best described as one of the cheapest ingredients of failure.\n\n“People have failed in this business, and I will fail as well.” To be fair, one solution could be to review how they all went about it, look for gaps, and try a different approach. Remember that you can’t keep doing the same thing and expect a different outcome.\n\nWhat are your plans for tomorrow? What will you do to stay ahead of the curve?"
