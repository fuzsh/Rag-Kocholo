        "text": "Article content\n\nOnly days away, Cochrane’s Canada Day celebrations hold many meanings. It’s the 110th anniversary of Cochrane, 25th anniversary of Family and Community Support Services (FCSS), and, most recently, it will double as a fundraiser for flood relief.\n\nThanks to FCSS, it’s also a chance to bring home Cochrane’s own George Fox, who’s music is testimony to our ranching heritage.\n\nGeorge Fox grew up as part of the Grand Valley ranching community and it was the encouragement from local residents who gave him the push to take his music further. His success has since spread the Cochrane area’s story around the globe.\n\nFox reflects fondly upon his youth here and speaks freely about how his music has sometimes touched upon the bittersweet impact of growth here. But mainly, he speaks with pride of his ranching heritage and the people who helped him along the way.\n\n“They were the ones cheering me on way back in the day,” said Fox. “They’d say ‘How come you’re not writing your own music, George? We want to buy your tapes’. This was back when I was singing at the Wheaton Hall and Jumping Pound and all those places. So I felt like, gee, I’d better not let anyone down here. I’d better get cracking and get things rolling with my music and see what happens. So when the Juno awards came I think all the community that supported me deserve a lot of credit, really.”\n\nAnd there has been much success since his debut single Angelina reached no. 8 on the Canadian country music charts. What followed were a number of top-selling songs that have become his signature. Goldmine, No Treapassing, Mustang Heart, I Give You My Word, What’s Holding Me and Breakfast Alone all broke the top 10. Three times he was named male vocalist of the year in the Canadian Country Music Awards and he also earned the Juno’s top country male vocalist award thrice.\n\nGeorge Fox Drive is prominent in the community and even complete strangers can’t help but notice it when they head south on Hwy. 22. For Fox, though, it’s a tribute to the Grand Valley ranching community.\n\n“The way I see it is it’s a tribute to my parents and the Grand Valley ranching community,” said Fox. “You know my mom and dad, Bert and Gert Fox (I use to say Bert, Gert and the little Skirt) were part of that generation that gave more and expected less. They were a generation that went through the war years and the depression and all of that. Fox Drive is as much a credit to them as to me. They were such a big part of building up the community in Cochrane and west into ranch country. It’s changing, I guess those names you read on the signs are all slip into the past.”\n\nReflecting on the ranching community and the changes growth brought to the area inspired some of Fox’s biggest hits.\n\n“I was thinking about that a bit with my music, the place where I came from,” said Fox. “Some of the music, like No Trespassing, was kind of inspired by seeing the development of Cochrane and how it was sort of a bitter sweet thing. When the Cochrane Hill started to give way to the houses backing the 90s and there was all that development is when I wrote that song.”\n\n“Other songs like, Here’s Hoping (There’ll Always be a Cowboy), is a tribute to my dad, but it’s also about the idea that the ranching community that founded the area lives on.”\n\nFox calls himself a ‘Recovering Alberta’ in Hamilton area where he has a small 300 acre farm he and his wife Monica have been painstakingly working into shape. The morning of the interview he had just returned from the field.\n\n“I just came in from cutting down hay this morning,” said Fox. “It’s the thickest crop I’ve ever seen. I almost call it the ‘full circle ranch’ because it’s very similar to the place I grew up with my folks.”\n\nIt won’t be hard for Fox to pay tribute to our nation during the Canada Day celebration.\n\n“I definitely have a Canadian theme in mind. I know that’s the star of the show—Canada Day. I’ve got a CD called Canadian and lots of references to the great place we live.”\n\nFox said he and his band are planning a kick it up.\n\n“We’ve kind of got a revved up show with that theme in mind, but we’ll do a lot of the songs relate to the Cochrane area and the memories of how I was there when my voice changed and all the things that happened in Cochrane when I started singing and some of the stories about that. But it’s going to be a celebration, so we have a really good band that knows how to put on a party show.”\n\nHe also plans to stay a few extra days to catch up with friends.\n\n“On a personal note, this does mean a lot to me,” said Fox. “I’m kind of getting back to civilian life a bit and I don’t do a lot of touring anymore so I appreciate being able to go back and perform. It’s very meaningful to put on a show in Cochrane where there’s still people there that guided me when I was growing up. To give a show and celebrate that is important to me.”\n\nFox encourages people to ask for more when the set it done.\n\n“Make sure everybody screams for an encore, ‘cause we’ll be happy to oblige.”\n\nnoel.edey@sunmedia.ca"
