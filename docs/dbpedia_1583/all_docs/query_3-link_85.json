Ever since, we’ve all been waiting for who could produce a Quaker version and Ben Guaraldi has finally taken the plunge and uploaded ‘What does George Fox say?’ to Youtube. This version retains the original fast-paced music of the original with a witty and concise explanation of Quakers rolled in. There’s some most peculiar dancing, paying homage to the original song and perhaps to original quaking.\n\nWhat do you make of it?"
