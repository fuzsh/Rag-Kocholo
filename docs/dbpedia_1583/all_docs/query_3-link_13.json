        "text": "Ever since I can remember, I’ve been singing this song about George Fox, a man who is widely regarded as the founder of The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers).\n\nWhen I became a singer-songwriter and started sharing some of my music with Quakers, I started getting a lot of requests for it. Though I was never a “singalong” musician (I have my own song that I wrote about Fox), I loosened up and learned the chords. If you’re looking to learn how to play the George Fox Song, I’ll post the chords and lyrics just below this video.\n\n[peekaboo name=”lyrics” onshow=”-Click to hide chords & lyrics” onhide=”+Click to show chords & lyrics”][peekaboo_content name=”lyrics”]\n\nChords\n\nVerses\n\nC – Am – F – G\n\nC – G – C\n\nC – Am – F – G\n\nC – G – C\n\nChorus\n\nC – Am – F – G\n\nC – Am – F – G\n\nC – G – Am – G\n\nC – G – C\n\nLyrics\n\nThere’s a Light that is shining in the Heart of a man\n\nIt’s the Light that was shining when the world began\n\nThere’s a Light that is shining in the Turk and the Jew\n\nThere’s a Light that is shining, friend, in me and in you.\n\n*chorus*\n\nWalk in the Light, wherever you may be\n\nWalk in the Light, wherever you may be\n\nWith my old leather britches and my shaggy, shaggy locks\n\nI am walking in the glory of the Light, said Fox\n\nWith a book and a steeple and a bell and a key\n\nWell they’ll bind you forever, but they can’t, said he\n\nFor the book, it will perish and the steeple will fall\n\nAnd the Light will be shining at the end of it all.\n\n(chorus)\n\nIf we give you a pistol, will you fight for the Lord?\n\nBut you can’t kill the devil with a gun or a sword.\n\nWill you swear on the Bible? “I will not!” said he,\n\n“For the Truth is more holy than the book to me.”\n\n(chorus)\n\nThere’s an ocean of darkness and I drown in the night\n\nTil I come through the darkness to the ocean of Light\n\nand the Light is forever, and the Light it is free\n\nAnd I walk in the glory of the Light, said he."
