        "text": "Generally, when I first listen to a song, I don’t pay much attention to lyrics. If I dig the melody and beat – as the boppers used to say on Bandstand – I’ll start paying closer attention to the words, and if the diction is clever or thought-provoking, all the better.\n\nAfter all, it’s really rare to encounter lyrics that possess the compression and structural integrity of poetry, i.e., to find songs with words that can stand alone on a page and engage sans musical accompaniment.\n\nMy friend George Fox’s latest song – so new that it’s still untitled – comes close to accomplishing this rare feat. The song, which consists of three verses followed by a chorus, distills a lifetime in four-and-a-half minutes and does so employing diction, imagery, and structure that reinforce and embody the song’s central theme, what Andrew Marvell famously dubbed “time’s wingèd chariot.” George wrestles with the metaphysics of time, the illusive nature of past, present, and future, and how a lifetime passes [cliché alert] in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe song begins with a callous youth speeding through life in rural Orangeburg County, South Carolina:\n\nJust eighteen, driving an old pickup truck,\n\nJoint in the ashtray and a bed full of luck.\n\nRunning nowhere as fast as I can\n\nDown an Orangeburg County washboard road\n\nNot enough sense to take it slow.\n\nRolling Stones singing “Street Fighting Man.”\n\nHere, the theme of speed is introduced, and we have our first bit of compression in the allusion to the Stones’ “Street Fighting Man,” which melds the attitude of the the speaker in the Stones’ song with George’s narrator, both young men fueled by the fire of youthful exuberance.\n\nWhat’s a poor boy to do but “run nowhere as fast as [he] can?”\n\nThe chorus shifts to the present, and again, we have speed, the idea of chasing “the dying light,” or as Marvell puts it in “To His Coy Mistress,” although “we cannot make our sun /Stand still, yet we will make him run.” Yet, in the last line, the speaker comes to the realization it’s always now, that the past and future only exist in the present and meaning lies in perspective, depending on where “you’re standing.”\n\nRight outside of your window, just outside your door,\n\nEverything is waiting for you\n\nTo fall into the night and chase the dying light.\n\nThere’s no need to be gentle.\n\nSometimes it’s heaven, sometimes it’s hell.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to tell.\n\nAll depends on where you’re standing.\n\nI stand before you now, and I see it written in in the clouds,\n\nAll that was and is and could be is now.\n\nIn the video below you can check out the first verse and chorus from a live performance at Chico Feo’s Monday Night Singer/Songwriter Soapbox, which George emcees. The song is a work-in-progress, and for me, it’s thrilling to see it evolve on stage, as George experiments with phrasing and gestures.\n\nIn the second verse, the middle verse, the narrator finds himself suddenly middle aged, “thirty-three/With two little boys sitting on my knee” and has come to know “how love is made,” but swoosh, suddenly, with the days having flown by “like a midnight train,” he looks down to see, not his sons, but his granddaughter Eliza Jade.\n\nTurned around and I was thirty-three\n\nWith two little boys sitting on my knee,\n\nAnd I realized how love is made.\n\nThe days flew by like a midnight train.\n\nThe years fell on me like the pouring rain.\n\nNow I look down and see Eliza Jade.\n\nThe last stanza arrives like a melancholy last act, with “second guesses, another last chance, and one more shot.” Once again, the radio is playing, not “Street Fighting Man,” but “a brand new song” saying “the same old thing” but “still get[ting] it wrong.”\n\nSecond guesses are all I’ve got,\n\nAnother last chance and one more shot.\n\nAnd how I got here I don’t even know.\n\nThe radio plays a brand new song.\n\nIt says the same old thing they still get wrong\n\nOh man, and so it goes.\n\nAnd so it goes – a lifetime distilled into a handful of words.\n\nI could go on about structure, how the number three is central to the architectonics – three six-line stanzas, three nine-line choruses, the narrator citing at one point his age is thirty-three, but you’d think I was overdoing it, and you’d be wrong. If it’s there, it’s there, whether the artist planned it or not. Making art is like dreaming, it comes from below, often surprising the artist him or herself.\n\nBy the way, George’s band Big Stoner Creek has a new album out. You can check it out HERE.\n\nPS. Here’s an earlier rendition of stanza three and the concluding chorus:"
