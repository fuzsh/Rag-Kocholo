This was included in 1955 on the anthology The Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music - Volume III: England, edited by Alan Lomax.\n\nHarry Burgess sang The Hungry Fox at home in Glynde, Sussex, on 19 June 1956. This recording made by Mervyn Plunkett was included in 1998 on the Topic anthology To Catch a Fine Buck Was My Delight (The Voice of the People Series Volume 18).\n\nThe Young Tradition sang Daddy Fox in 1967 on their second album, So Cheerfully Round. Peter Bellamy noted:\n\nI almost learned Daddy Fox in the approved traditional manner, not at my motherâs knee, but at the knee of my Great-Aunt Henrietta, who used to sing it to me when was very small. The only problem is that the version which I remember her singing was an American one. Perhaps she learned it from a Burl Ives record on Housewivesâ Choice. The version we sing here comes from Dartmoor and comes to us indirectly and somewhat changed from the singing of Cyril Tawney.\n\nRoy and Val Bailey sang The Fox in 1968 on their album of childrenâs songs with Leon Rosselson, Oats & Beans & Kangaroos.\n\nCyril Tawney sang Old Daddy Fox on his 1970 Argo album Childrenâs Songs From Devon and Cornwall. He noted:\n\nCollected by Ralph Dunstan from Jim Thomas of Camborne, 21 October 1931 [VWML CJS2/10/2824] . This old song is one of the most popular traditional pieces on either side of the Atlantic, but nowhere are versions more abundant than in Devon and Cornwall. Even in these modern times the song-hunter does not travel far in this region before encountering it. Tunes vary greatly, but the words are fairly rigid, being apparently unaffected not only by distance but by time too. I have seen a mediaeval version whose text differs little from that given here.\n\nFreda Palmer sang The Fox and the Grey Goose in a recording made by Mike Yates at her home in Witney, Oxfordshire in 1972. Int was included in 1975 on the Topic anthology of countryside songs from Southern England, When Sheepshearingâs Done, and in 2001 on the Musical Tradition anthology of songs and music from the Mike Yates Collection, Up in the North and Down in the South. Mike Yates noted in the accompanying booklet:\n\nThe Fox and the Grey Goose is a universally known song—at least in the version popularised by Burl Ives—although, surprisingly, Freda Palmer had never heard of the latter version until I mentioned it to her. A verse of the song appeared in Gammer Gurtonâs Garland (1810) and it is one of the songs that Sir Walter Scott listed as being a favourite of his childhood. Many Victorian broadside printers included it in their catalogues, and collectors have found it being sung in many English counties—thus the 117 instances in Roud. Only Alfred Williamsâ collection from ‘Wassail’ Harvey of Cricklade, Wilts, is from Fredaâs part of the country, and the majority of English versions come from either Sussex or the south west.\n\nBob Copper sang The Fox on his 1977 Topic album of countryside songs from the South, Sweet Rose in June. Mike Yates noted:\n\nBob also includes three animal songs from the same period; the anti-clerical Parson and the Sucking Pig—called The Tithe Pig by the Reverend Baring-Gould who noted a couple of versions on Dartmoor; The Fox, a favourite of the young Sir Walter Scott and Dogs and Ferrets, a poaching song that still enjoys a widespread popularity in country areas today.\n\nMelanie Harrold sang this song in 1983 as A Fox Jumped Up on Tim Hart and Friendsâ album Drunken Sailor and Other Kids Songs. This track was later included on their compilation CD Favourite Nursery Rhymes and Other Childrenâs Songs.\n\nBarry and Robin Dransfield sang Daddy Fox in 1994 on Barryâs CD Be Your Own Man. He noted:\n\nOne of my very favourite English folksongs. I was struck with this one when I heard it performed by The Young Tradition in the sixties. Their sense of style and pace is still second to none and has certainly inspired me. The fox and family have a wonderful time and get away with it—brilliant. Thanks to Robin for joining me on this one, and I would like to dedicate this to Young Tradition members Royston Wood and Peter Bellamy, both great friends who tragically are no longer with is.\n\nThe Ripley Wayfarers (Mick Peat, Barry Renshaw, Andrew Train, Arthur Renshaw and Phil Langham) sang Daddy Fox, “[o]ne of the most popular songs in Folk Clubs, given a new twist by our setting of it to the tune of Carrion Crow”, on their 1971 LP Chips and Brown Sauce. It was also included in 2001 on the Fellside anthology Voices in Harmony.\n\nPete Morton sang The Fox in 1991 on his, Roger Wilsonâs and Simon Edwardsâ Harbourtown cassette Urban Folk Vol. I. He noted:\n\nThe Fox is sometimes known as Daddy Fox, this is an American version of this childrenâs song.\n\nRay Driscoll sang Old Father Fox in a recording made by Gwilym Davies in Dulwich in October 1993. It was published in 2008 on his CD Wild, Wild Berry. Gwilym Davies noted that “in most versions the fox is referred to as ‘Daddy Fox’, and Rayâs version is the only one collected in England referring to ‘Father Fox’.”\n\nThe New Scorpion Band sang The Fox in 1999 on their first CD, Folk Songs and Tunes From the British Isles. They noted:\n\nThe song was collected by the Hammond brothers from Mrs Crawford in West Milton, Dorset in 1906. Versions exist wherever English is spoken, and the text is fairly consistent, except for the name of the farmerâs wife; here she is Old Mother Wibble-Wobble!\n\nThe Witches of Elswick sang the Ripley Wayfarersâ version of Daddy Fox in 2003 on their first CD, Out of Bed. They noted:\n\nThis is a song… about a fox! Fay [Hield] and Gillian [Tolfrey] used to sing versions of this when they were little, but these words were put to the tune of The Carrion Crow by the luscious Mick Peat, of Radio Derby fame.\n\nJon Boden sang Barry Dransfieldâs version of Daddy Fox as the 2 January 2011 entry of his project A Folk Song a Day.\n\nPete Coe sang Daddy Fox in 2011 on his CD Tall Tailes.\n\nJohn and Sally Kirkpatrick sang Old Father Fox on their 2013 Fledgâling CD Every Mortal Place. He noted:\n\nPeople of my generation who grew up listening to Childrenâs Favourites on the BBC Light Programme had no idea there were so many sturdy English alternatives to the way the American singer Burl Ives gave us The Fox. It felt as though he was on every weekend. In fact the song has been around for well over two hundred years, and has been collected and recorded no end of times from traditional English singers. The usual title is The Fox, or The Hungry Fox, or Old Daddy Fox, but Ray Driscoll had picked it up in Shropshire, uniquely, so it seems, as Old Father Fox.\n\nRay was more of a pub singer than a concert artist, and not only did he take this at quite a lick, but also turned in a crowd-pleasing semi-tone run in a couple of the lines of the verse. This kind of thing doesnât please all of us, however, and Iâve left that out, as well as tinkering with the words here and there. And foxes never seem to feel the need to be in that much of a hurry, except in dire emergencies, so Iâve slowed the tempo right down too. But apart from changing the words, the tune, and the speed, this is exactly how Gwilym Davies recorded it from Mr Driscoll!\n\nSteve Roud included The Hungry Fox in 2012 in The New Penguin Book of English Folk Songs. James Findlay, Brian Peters, Bella Hardy and Lucy Ward sang it a year later on the accompanying Fellside CD The Liberty to Choose.\n\nKit Hawes and Aaron Catlow sang The Fox in 2016 as the title track of their CD The Fox.\n\nVicki Swan and Jonny Dyer sang Daddy Fox in 2016 on their CD Paper of Pins. They noted:\n\nA well loved and often sung traditional song that has roots in many places in the UK. A new melody though—one which we hope accents the humour of the songâs events. Interspersed with a reel The Chicken Run.\n\nGreenMatthews sang Daddy Fox on their 2019 CD Roots & Branches. They noted:\n\nA tale of vulpine larceny learned from the singing of Barry Dransfield. Unusually for an English folk song, this is a song about a fox in which Reynard is still alive by the end.\n\nGigspanner Big Band sang Daddy Fox in 2020 on their CD Natural Invention. They noted:\n\nThe cunning and resourceful nature of the Fox has been a global theme of folk song and tale for centuries.\n\nThis particular songâs earliest incarnations date back to the 15th Century, and are written in Middle English, and whilst the language is archaic, the story has barely changed throughout its retelling.\n\nThe much later version we have chosen is from Dartmoor and was recorded by the Young Tradition, who in turn learnt it indirectly from Cyril Tawney. It is partnered with the Morris tune Not for Joe.\n\nLewis Barfoot sang The Fox on her 2021 CD Glenaphuca. She noted:\n\nThe album is a folk prayer to my ancestors and largely focuses on the feminine and my Irish roots. But I wanted to honour the masculine and my father in the album and what better way than to sing my favourite song that my dad used to sing to us as children—The Fox. I couldnât get enough of him playing it and I would love singing along to the “bones o, bones o”. His fingerpicking style would tickle my bones with delight and was the inspiration for me to learn guitar.\n\nAlex Cumming recorded The Fox in 2022 for his download single The Fox. He noted:\n\nThe Fox, often known as The Fox Went Out on a Chilly Night or Daddy Fox, is a fabulous tale of a Fox successfully feeding his family. This is a favourite of my kids, so had to lay this down and release is as a single.\n\nThis version is an amalgamation of various traditional versions of the song from the US and UK.\n\nMatt Quinn and George Sansome sang The Fox and the Grey Goose in 2023 on their duo album Sheffield Park. Matt Quinn noted:\n\nMy dad used to sing this in our duo The Mighty Quinns. This version (complete with a less than happy ending for the fox) was in the repertoire of Freda Palmer from Witney, Oxfordshire.\n\nNarthen sang Daddy Fox in 2023 on their No Masters album Now. They noted:\n\nMick Peat was a great encourager of all the performers he met. He used to perform this himself and in the spirit of handing things on, he suggested it was a song Sarah [Matthews] should sing.\n\nLyrics\n\nHarry Burgess sings The Hungry Fox\n\nA fox jumped up in his angry plight\n\nAnd begged the moon to give him light,\n\nFor he had many miles to trot that night\n\nBefore he reached his den-home,\n\nDen-ho, den-ho.\n\nFor he had many miles to trot that night\n\nBefore he reached his den home.\n\nAt last he came to the farmerâs yard\n\nWhere the ducks and geese declared they heard.\n\nTheir nerves should be shaken and their rest disturbed\n\nBy a visit from Mr Fox-o,\n\nFox-o, fox home.\n\nTheir nerves shall be shaken and their rest disturbed\n\nBy a visit from Mr Fox home.\n\nHe took the black duck by the neck\n\nAnd swung him right across his back.\n\nThe black duck cried out, “Quack, quack, quack,”\n\nWith his legs hangling down and down-ho,\n\nDown-ho, down-ho.\n\nThe black duck cried out, “Quack, quack, quack,”\n\nWith his legs all hangling down and down home.\n\nThen old Mrs Slipper-Slapper jumped out of bed\n\nAnd out of the window popped her head.\n\nSaid, “John, John, John, the black duck is gone,\n\nThe fox is off to his ken-ho,\n\nKen-ho, ken-ho.”\n\nSaying, “John, John, John, the black duck is gone,\n\nThe fox is off to his ken home.”\n\nThen John ran up to the top of the hill.\n\nHe blew a blast most loud and shrill.\n\nSaid the fox, “That is very pretty music still.\n\nBut Iâm always home to my den-ho,\n\nDen-ho, den-o.”\n\nSaid the fox, “That is very pretty music still,\n\nAnd now Iâm off to my den-ho.”\n\nAt last the fox got home to his den,\n\nHis dear little foxes eight, nine, ten.\n\nSays, “Ah, youâre in luck, Hereâs a good fat duck\n\nWith his legs hangling down and down-ho,\n\nDown-ho, down-ho.”\n\nSays, “Ah, youâre in luck, Hereâs a good fat duck\n\nWith his legs hangling down and down home.”\n\nHe sat down to dinner with his hungry wife,\n\nDid very well without a fork or knife.\n\nNever had a better duck in all their life\n\nAnd the little ones pick the bones-o,\n\nBones-o, bones-o\n\nNever had a better duck in all their life\n\nAnd the little ones pick the bones-o.\n\nThe Young Tradition sing Daddy Fox\n\nDaddy Fox he went out one chilly night\n\nHe prayed to the moon for to give him light,\n\nFor heâd many many miles to go that night\n\nBefore he came to his den-o,\n\nDen-o, den-o\n\nFor heâd many many miles to go that night\n\nBefore he came to his den-o\n\nSo he grabbed the grey goose by the neck\n\nAnd he throwed a duck all across his back\n\nAnd he heeded not their quivvy-quivvy-quack\n\nNor the legs all a-dangeling down-o\n\nDown-o, down-o,\n\nHe heeded not their quivvy-quivvy-quack\n\nNor the legs all a-dangeling down-o.\n\nThen Old Mother Twiddle-Twoddle jumped out of bed\n\nAnd out of the window she stuck her little head\n\nCrying, “Oh John oh, now the grey goose is dead\n\nAnd the fox is away to his den-o.”\n\nDen-o, den-o,\n\nCrying, “Oh John oh, now the grey goose is dead\n\nAnd the fox is away to his den-o.”\n\nSo John then he rode up to the top of the hill\n\nHe blowed his little horn both loud and shrill.\n\n“Play on,” said Reynard, “with your music still\n\nWhile I trot away to my den-o,”\n\nDen-o, den-o,\n\n“Play on,” said Reynard, “with your music still\n\nWhile I trot away to my den-o.”\n\nThen old Daddy Fox and his cubs and his wife\n\nThey cut up the goose without any knife,\n\nSaying, “Iâve never ever had such a supper in my life\n\nAnd the cubs they can pick on the bones-o,”\n\nBones-o, bones-o,\n\nSaying, “Iâve never ever had such a supper in my life\n\nAnd the cubs they can pick on the bones-o.”\n\nCyril Tawney sings Old Daddy Fox\n\nOld Daddy Fox went out one night\n\nAnd prayed to the moon to give him light,\n\nFor he had a long way to go that night\n\nBefore he reached the town-o,\n\nThe town-o, the town-o,\n\nHe had a long way to go that night\n\nBefore he reached the town-o.\n\nWhen he reached the farmyard gate\n\nThe ducks and the geese went gruddy-gruddy-quack.\n\n“Oh donât be alarmed and donât be afeared\n\nFor the fattest of you shall grease my beard\n\nBefore I leave the town-o,\n\nThe town-o, the town-o,\n\nThe fattest of you shall grease my beard\n\nBefore I leave the town-o.”\n\nThe old grey goose gave the loudest quack\n\nHe picked her up upon his back.\n\nHe picked her up upon his back\n\nAnd the blood come a-trickeling down-o,\n\nA-down-o, a-down-o,\n\nHe picked her up upon his back\n\nAnd the blood come a-trickeling down-o\n\nOld Gramma Snipper-Snapper jumped out of bed,\n\nPulled down the window and popped out her head,\n\nSaid, “Arise Jack, arise, for the grey gooose is dead\n\nAnd the fox has left the town-o,\n\nThe town-o, the town-o,\n\nArise Jack, arise, for the grey gooose is dead\n\nAnd the fox has left the town-o.”\n\nSo Jack got up and he made alarm,\n\nHe saddled his horse and he blew his horn,\n\nAnd he saw the fox on the other hill\n\nSaying, “You canât catch me, Iâm a good man still\n\nAnd I like the sound of your horn-o,\n\nYour horn-o, your horn-o,\n\nYou canât catch me, Iâm a good man still\n\nAnd I like the sound of your horn-o.”\n\nWhen he got home to his old den,\n\nOut come the young ones, eight, nine, ten,\n\nThe fox and his wife ate the grey goose then\n\nAnd the young ones picked up the bones-o,\n\nThe bones-o, the bones-o,\n\nThe fox and his wife ate the grey goose then\n\nAnd the young ones picked up the bones-o.\n\nFreda Palmer sings The Fox and the Grey Goose\n\nThe stars were shining and all things bright.\n\n“Ha-ha”, said the fox, “itâs a very fine night\n\nFor me to go through the town-di-o,\n\nFor me to go through the town.”\n\nThe fox when he came to yonders stile\n\nHe p(r)icked up his ears and listened awhile.\n\n“Ha-ha”, said the fox, “itâs but a short mile,\n\nFrom this to yonder town-di-o,\n\nFrom this to yonder town.”\n\nThe fox when he came to the farmerâs gate,\n\nWho should he see but the farmerâs drake.\n\n“I love you well for your masterâs sake,\n\nBut I long to be picking your bones-i-o,\n\nBut I long to be picking your bones.”\n\nThe grey goose ran around the stack,\n\n“Ha-ha”, said the fox, “youâre very fat,\n\nYouâll do very well to ride on my back,\n\nFrom this to yonder town-di-o,\n\nFrom this to yonder town.”\n\nThe farmerâs wife she jumped out of bed\n\nAnd out of the window she popped her head.\n\n“Oh husband, oh husband, the geese are all dead,\n\nThe fox has been through the town-di-o,\n\nThe fox has been through the town.”\n\nThe farmer he loaded his pistol with lead,\n\nAnd shot the old rogue of the fox through the head.\n\n“Ha-ha”, said the farmer, “I think youâre quite dead,\n\nNo more you will trouble the town-di-o,\n\nNo more you will trouble the town.”\n\nMelanie Harrold sings A Fox Jumped Up\n\nOh a fox jumped up one winterâs night\n\nAnd he begged the moon to give him light,\n\nFor heâd many, many miles to trod that night\n\nBefore he reached his den-o.\n\nAnd the first place he came to was a farmerâs yard\n\nWhere the ducks and the geese declared it hard\n\nThat their nerves should be shaken and their rest so marred\n\nBy a visit from the fox-o.\n\nAnd he took the grey goose by the neck,\n\nHe swung him right up across his back,\n\nThe grey goose cried out, “Quack, quack, quack,”\n\nWith his legs all dangling down-o.\n\nThen Old Mother Slipper-Slopper jumped out of bed\n\nAnd out of the window she popped her head\n\nSaying, “John, John, the grey goose is gone\n\nAnd the fox is away to his den-o.”\n\nSo John ran up to the top of the hill\n\nAnd be blew his whistle loud and shrill,\n\nSaid the fox, “That is pretty music, still\n\nIâd rather be in my den-o.”\n\nSo the fox went back to his hungry den\n\nAnd his dear little foxes eight, nine, ten,\n\nThey said, “Good daddy, you must go there again,\n\nYou bring such cheer from the farm-o.”\n\nSo the fox and his wife without any strife\n\nSaid they never ate a better goose in all their life,\n\nThey did very, very well without a fork or a knife\n\nAnd the little ones picked the bones-o.\n\nRay Driscoll sings Old Father Fox\n\nOld Father Fox came out one night\n\nAnd he prayed for the moon for to give him light.\n\nFor heâd many a mile to travel that night\n\nBefore he reached his den-o,\n\nDen-o, den-o,\n\nFor heâd many a mile to travel that night\n\nBefore he reached his den-o.\n\nOh he grabbed the grey goose by the head\n\nHe gave him a bite and he was dead.\n\nAnd he flung him back across his back\n\nWith the legs a-dangling down-o,\n\nDown-o, down-o,\n\nOh he threw the goose across his back\n\nWith the legs a-dangling down-o.\n\nOld Mother Slipper-Slopper jumped out of bed\n\nAnd out of the window popped her head.\n\nShe said, “John, John, the grey goose is dead\n\nAnd the fox is away to his den-o,\n\nDen-o, den-o,\n\nOh John, John, John, the grey goose is gone,\n\nThe fox is away to his den-o.”\n\nThe farmer went out to the top of the hill\n\nAnd he blew his horn both loud and shrill.\n\nThe fox said, “Blow till your head to fill\n\nFor I am away to my den-o,\n\nDen-o, den-o,”\n\nHe said, “Oh you can blow to your fill\n\nFor I am away to my den-o.”\n\nAnd then he got home to his own little wife\n\nThey cut up the goose without her knife,\n\nSaid, “The best feed Iâve had in my life\n\nAnd the cups can have the bones-o,\n\nBones-o, bones-o,”\n\nHe said, “The best feed Iâve had in my life\n\nAnd the cups can have the bones-o.”\n\nThe Witches of Elswick sing Daddy Fox\n\nDaddy Fox went out on a chilly night\n\nWith a ling dong, dilly dong, kyro me\n\nPraying for the moon to give him light\n\nWith a ling dong, dilly dong, kyro me\n\nChorus (repeated after each verse):\n\nHey falee fala falero, hey falero lero lee;\n\nUp jumped John, a-ringing on his bell,\n\nWith a ling dong, dilly dong, kyro me.\n\nHe ran till he came to a quick kip pen\n\nThe ducks and geese they lay therein\n\nHe grabbed the grey goose by the neck\n\nThrew a little duck all across his back\n\nOld Mrs Flipper-Flopper jumped out of bed\n\nThrough the window she stuck her little head\n\nAnd John rode up to the top of the hill\n\nHe blew his little horn both loud and shrill\n\nThe fox went back to his cozy den\n\nLittle ones were there, they were eight, nine and ten"
