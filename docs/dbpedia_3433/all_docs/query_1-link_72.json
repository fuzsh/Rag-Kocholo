        "text": "The world famous novel “Moby Dick” by Herman Melville is based on the story of one of the survivors and the story of the “Essex” forms the basis of the film “In the Heart of the Sea” from 2015, but these people were not the only ones who had to overcome this last moral hurdle. In more recent times, such gruesome stories can be found as the fate of the ship’s boy Richard Parker: On 5 July 1984, the yacht of an Australian lawyer sank 1,400 kilometres from Cape Horn in a storm. The crew of four was able to escape into the lifeboat, but forgot to take drinking water on board and their food supplies consisted only of two cans of turnips. After a few days they managed to catch a turtle, which together with the turnips meant food and liquid for about 12 days. Eventually, however, they ran out of supplies and began to drink their own urine. The more experienced sailors avoided drinking seawater, but the inexperienced shipboy Richard Parker, was overwhelmed by thirst and made this fatal mistake. Shortly afterwards, on 20 July 1984, he became ill and his comerades saw no hope for him. They decided to kill him to eat him and drink his blood. On 29 July, the surviving three sailors were rescued by a German yacht."
