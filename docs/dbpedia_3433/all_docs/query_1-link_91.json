        "text": "Ciudades is a scientific journal of annual periodicity, founded in 1993 and edited by the Instituto Universitario de Urbanística of the University of Valladolid (Spain), whose object is urbanism in a broad sense and that addresses the academic world as well as the citizenship interested in urban and territorial issues from various disciplines.\n\nThe journal was born within the area of knowledge of Urban and Regional Planning with the vocation to promote the debate on the city and with the perspective of a better knowledge of urban phenomena. It refers to both theoretical and propositional approaches and to their interrelation with other disciplines such as architecture, engineering, geography, sociology, history, political science, anthropology, economics and ecology.\n\nThe complexities and contradictions affecting cities are always on debate. Professionals and scholars of urban planning need to know urban and territorial phenomena and benefit from the promotion of a rooted culture that is sometimes little known or ignored, and yet constantly evolving.\n\nCiudades proposes the study of cities and urban planning with a critical sense, from a theoretical approach and with a transdisciplinary intention, with the conviction of the need for planning and with the idea that urban planning must be a public function to serve everybody. Therefore, it aims to be a mean of scientific dissemination of articles on research and proposals for intervention that address, critically, all those issues related to urban knowledge and planning, which affect cities, territories and landscapes.\n\nThe Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECyT) awards a seal of quality that recognises for an annual period the editorial and scientific quality of the journals that have passed an evaluation process. Ciudades was awarded the seal in 2021 and has renewed it since then, and in the most recent ranking (2022) it is placed at C3 in the “Geography” category.\n\nCiudades is edited by the Instituto Universitario de Urbanística of the University of Valladolid as electronic journal (ISSN-E 2445-3943) and, with a limited edition with institutional purposes, as paper journal (ISSN 1133-6579). Ediciones Universidad de Valladolid is a technical co-editor, as manager of the journals’ platform of the University of Valladolid (Revistas UVa).\n\nCiudades is a non-profit publication that adheres to the principles of the Open Access movement. It enables free and immediate access to its content in order to make research freely available to the public, thus fostering greater global knowledge sharing. In addition, the submission, review and publication of articles are completely free of charge for authors.\n\nThe names and email addresses entered in this journal site will be used exclusively for the purposes stated by this journal (namely, those relating the processing of manuscripts submitted for publication, their evaluating process, or the distribution of information concerning calls for papers and the published works) and will not be made available for any other purpose or to any other party.\n\nUnder REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), users can exercise their rights to request access to, and to rectification and erasure (right to be forgotten) of their personal information, restriction of and/or objection to data processing and portability, as well as not to transfer and/or share your information with third parties individually."
