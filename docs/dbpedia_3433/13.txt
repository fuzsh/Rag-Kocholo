El barrendero (in English, The Street Sweeper) is a 1982 Mexican comedy film directed by Miguel M. Delgado and starring Cantinflas and María Sorté.[1] It has been cited as an example of a "Mexploitation" film.[2] It is Cantinflas's last film, ending a career that had lasted since 1936.

Plot[]

Napoleón (Cantinflas) is a humble street sweeper who flirts with all the maids in the neighborhood where he works (all of whom call him affectionately "Don Napo"), of which Chipinita (María Sorté) stands out. Napoleon ends up being the only witness to the theft of a valuable painting, and he is threatened by the thieves of the painting and also becomes a suspect.
