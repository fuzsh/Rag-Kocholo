        "text": "Ray Bradbury was the sort of writer and storyteller I appreciate the most. Many great storytellers are not particularly great writers. Many great writers are not particularly great storytellers.\n\nWriting is the skill of communication through the written word. One can be good at writing and lousy at storytelling. Most of what gets printed in literary journals and magazines is good writing but boring storytelling.\n\nStorytelling is the skill of conveying the events of a narrative in an emotionally evocative and entertaining way. If something is successful commercially and remains in print for a long time, it’s probably a good story. If that same story gets panned or shunned by critics in The Atlantic or The New York Times Review of Books, while succeeding in the market place, it’s probably not so great writing.\n\nTo write well and tell good stories is a somewhat rare combination.\n\nRay learned how to tell stories in multiple mediums. This is also rare. A lot of writers master one or maybe two forms of storytelling. They are a screenwriter, novelist, playwriter, or comic book writer. To do well in a variety of forms demands learning the limits and possibilities of each form.\n\nMr. Bradbury was a great storyteller and a great writer. He did both in multiple forms. He wrote short stories, novels, poems, films, TV shows, and he wrote essays.\n\nZen in the Art of Writing is a collection of Bradbury’s essays about storytelling.\n\nWho is it for?\n\nThis is a collection of essays and poems for storytellers or those desiring to become one. More specifically, these are essays for the sort of person who wants to tell stories that academics would sneer at but adored by fans of genre fiction. That shouldn’t be too surprising given the kinds of stories that Bradbury wrote.\n\nThough writers of literary fiction would find something useful in the collection, it wasn’t written for them.\n\nWhat is it for?\n\nLike many books of it’s type, the collection was meant to inspire and offer advice to aspiring writers. It is an encouragement to those who haven’t yet worked out how to tell a good story, and a corrective for the writer who has gone down the wrong path.\n\nThis is not a book about writing. There is nothing about word choice, grammar, style, or voice. He focuses entirely about story and where his stories came from and suggestions for where we might find our stories.\n\nWhat’s it like?\n\nLike a lot of great storytellers, he recommends that we become collectors. Collect ideas, experiences, information, knowledge, and stories.\n\nBradbury recommended reading poetry every day. He also recommended reading essays, short stories and novels. He was of the opinion that essays and short stories were more instructive for a budding writer.\n\nHis attitude was that one should read whatever they want to read regardless of the opinions of snobs and purists. The good. The bad. The trash and the treasure both have value. To Bradbury, all these had something of truth in them and this is what made them worth reading.\n\nBradbury wrote that his stories surprised him. Many of the essays contain anecdotes about how ideas for stories emerged from a variety of sources. Another writer’s story would have a seed of an idea that would mutate and grow into a different plant entirely. The Martian Chronicles were inspired by Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio. Some stories came from a childhood memory. Others were inspired by a line from a poem.\n\nIn The Secret Mind he wrote about how he went to Ireland work on the screen play for Moby Dick with John Huston. Bradbury did not enjoy the experience. He found Ireland of the 1950’s a dismal and depressing place. He was glad to leave it and did not expect to ever find a story from the time he spent there. He was wrong. His “secret mind”, the unconscious, had collected an impression of the place and the people. That experience turned short stories and a half a dozen plays many years later.\n\nZest. Gusto. How rarely one hears these words used. How rarely do we see people living, or for that matter, creating by them. Yet if I were asked to name the most important items in a writer’s make-up, the things that shape his material and rush him along the road to where he wants to go, I could only warn him to took to his zest, see to his gusto.\n\nA theme that persists across the anthology the idea that to tell a story which is uniquely yours requires awareness and sensitivity to your own emotions.\n\nHe wanted us to love. To be angry. To feel joy. To feel sadness. To LIVE!\n\nGreat stories, however masterful the writer may be, require feeling. The writer must have something in them that they desperately want to express to the world.\n\nIf the story doesn’t put a fire in your belly (or your loins, or your head, or heart) then the reader will go away feeling cold.\n\nConclusion\n\nBooks about writing by successful writers have commonalities. On Writing, by Stephen King and The War of Art by Steven Pressfield and Zen in the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury all believe that the work is what kept them from losing their minds and their selves. Each of them believes you have to read a lot and widely to become a good writer and a good storyteller. All three, through great effort and sacrifice, learned the craft by failing and trying again.\n\nEach of those books also show how every storyteller has to find their own way. King got a degree in English and taught high school before selling his first novel. Pressfield graduated from Duke and spent decades working in many different professions before he achieved any success. Bradbury didn’t have the money for a college education and wrote The Martian Chronicles on a rented typewriter. What worked for Bradbury didn’t work for King or Pressfield. Some of it might work for you and me. Some of it won’t.\n\nThe unique and fascinating way Bradbury found his stories and developed his craft is worth studying and considering if you are interested in writing stories of your own."
