        "text": "Ray Bradbury, author of Dandelion Wine and The Martian Chronicles, and one of L.A.'s greatest writers and my childhood fave, passed away Tuesday night at the age of 91. Bradbury never forgot the authentic, decent values of his Midwestern upbringing in Waukegan, Illinois, which figured prominently in his writing after his family moved to the sprawling, de-natured dystopia of L.A, with its \"vast concrete river,\" gated enclaves, and hovering ghetto birds. He famously never learned to drive in this car-centered metropolis, preferring to bike or take mass transit, far in advance, as he was in many things, of the city's budding love affair with both.\n\nBradbury's writing endured because he never lost touch with what it meant to be human. Best known as a \"sci-fi\" and fantasy writer -- though he wrote in myriad genres -- Bradbury was, nevertheless, not enamored with technology. Rather, he was interested in the ways in which technology affected how humans related to each other and to the natural world. Bradbury famously wrote on a typewriter until he resorted to voice recording when he could no longer type.\n\nThere are many great quotes attributed to Mr. Bradbury, including, \"I don't need an alarm clock. My ideas wake me.\" And \"Don't talk about it; write.\" However, my favorite Bradbury quote is, \"All I can do is teach people to fall in love. My advice to them is, do what you love and love what you do. â€¦ If I can teach them that, I've done a great job.\"\n\nIn that spirit, Brooke Clifford and I just finished reading and discussing Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451.\" First written as a short story in 1947, the novel is uncannily prophetic of the world we inhabit today: Reality TV; human suffering as entertainment spectacle; walls that talk; an incurious embrace of what is happy, banal, and non-threatening at the expense of deep, difficult, and critical inquiry; the permanent war state; the surrogate \"family\"; the need for an invented, if ill-defined, enemy; televised police chases; interactive role-playing; the triumph of comics in books and film; everyone getting their 15 seconds of fame; and, of course, omnipresent surveillance in order to protect \"the homeland\" from free-thinking malcontents, who, in Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451\" world, walked.\n\n\"Fahrenheit 451\" is also an ode to love -- and how the stillness of deep reading approximates love's timeless presence (\"Time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine\") -- as well as a grand look at how civilizations inexorably pass through periods of darkness and light. Bradbury writes poetically, heroically, towards novel's end, \"There was a silence gathered all about that fire and the silence was in the men's faces, and time was there, time enough to sit by this rusting track under the trees, and look at the world and turn it over with the eyes, as if it were held to the center of the bonfire, a piece of steel these men were all shaping. It was not only the fire that was different. It was the silence. Montag moved toward this special silence that was concerned with all of the world.\"\n\nBradbury goes on to lyrically describe how the city and all its technology eventually implodes on itself, as the preservers of education, the hinges of history, survive like hobos in \"walking camps\" out along the river at city's end. There they stealthily memorize the great works of world civilization -- each bum a book -- awaiting the dawn of a new age of light, ideas, and genuine shared inquiry.\n\nAs we bemoan the dumbing down of our own culture, and the decline of difficult reading in schools and in the home, we too find ourselves out along that metaphorical river, where a few courageous souls meet to remember what our civilization has forgotten.\n\nWe can thank the great Ray Bradbury for inspiring us to continue, even as the darkness envelops us with its stultifying comforts."
