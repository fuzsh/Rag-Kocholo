        "text": "Waney , December 29, 2012 (view all comments by Waney)\n\nThis book isn't merely some kind of morality play. The story itself follows the transition of Guy Montag, from a book-leery, burn-happy \"fireman\" into a man who is on the run for not only possessing books, but killing a fellow fireman to protect them. There's action, there's intrigue, there's violence, there's character development and there's a story that you can actually follow and stay interested in. Totally recommended.\n\nJennifer Short , July 14, 2008 (view all comments by Jennifer Short)\n\nBradbury wrote a classic in this book. There's so much depth to this story. There's the basic plot which gives you a lot to think about, and then there's symbolism as well. What more can you ask for? Can you immagine a world without books? Bradbury has written about that day and about the few people who still love books. Join Montag as he burns books and then realizes what he is doing!"
