        "text": "Famous for his prolific output of fanciful short stories and novels (among other genres), Ray Bradbury was a workhorse, putting between one to two thousand words to paper daily throughout his long career. He averaged a story per week.\n\nSelf-taught and educated in libraries, Bradbury wanted to make his living as a writer. He would enter ‘his office’ (a library), insert a dime into the timer and start typing.\n\nAs he put it, he “did the work.” That work, because it explored the human condition over being a catalogue of ‘gizmos,’ is why it continues to hold up and delight today.\n\n‘Fahrenheit 451,’ his prescient dystopian novel is taught (and ironically, sometimes censored) in high schools throughout the country.\n\n‘Something Wicked This Way Comes,’ and other works were additionally produced as movies. His short story collections, ‘The Martian Chronicles’ and ‘The Illustrated Man’ stand as examples of some of the best of his prolific output over the decades.\n\nI read an interview with him in which he revealed the work ethic he adopted which lead to his prodigious literary output. It is good advice to writers and anyone with ambitions in any discipline.\n\nThe interviewer asked Bradbury about his world view and, citing his sometimes dark subject matter, whether he was an optimist or a pessimist.\n\nSomewhat sidestepping the question, Bradbury said he preferred the term Optimal Behaviorist.\n\nBradbury always asked himself, “What can I do today?” Regardless, the deadline was a week, a month or six months off, what could he do today, and each day, to move closer to fulfilling that goal? However small the increment, constant movement forward ensured his success.\n\nHe applied that discipline from the beginning and achieved a literary output envied by anyone who would be a writer.\n\nAnother facet of his Optimal Behaviorist perspective is that everyone should act in ways which enhance the world we live in. Bradbury felt life was a miraculous gift that deserved optimal behavior in gratitude.\n\nWhat can you accomplish today? Each day? However small the increment? Keep moving toward the goal. Do the work."
