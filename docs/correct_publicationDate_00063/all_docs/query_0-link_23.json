        "text": "Fahrenheit 451, dystopian novel, first published in 1953, that is regarded as perhaps the greatest work by American author Ray Bradbury and has been praised for its stance against censorship and its defense of literature as necessary both to the humanity of individuals and to civilization.\n\nThe story takes place in an unspecified city in a distant future. The protagonist, Guy Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn down houses in which books have been discovered. After leaving work one day, he meets Clarisse, a teenaged girl who enjoys nature and asks if he is happy. At home, he finds that his wife, Mildred, has swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills in a suicide attempt. After he calls for help, two men arrive and revive her. The next morning, she behaves as though nothing happened and watches as usual the programs on the television screens that make up three of the parlour walls. Montag and the cheerful Clarisse begin talking regularly, until one day she is not outside waiting for him; he eventually learns that she was killed by a speeding car. Later, when the firemen are sent to burn down the house of an elderly woman, Montag takes her Bible—an act that he thinks his hand has undertaken on its own—and the woman chooses to die with her books. Montag begins to have doubts about his mission, and the next day he stays home from work.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, First Lines Quiz\n\nFirehouse leader Captain Beatty goes to Montag in order to convince him that the fireman’s job is important. He explains that people began to lose interest in reading after the advent of television and that objections to some passages in books by interest groups and minorities led to censorship. Eventually it was felt that books and learning in general created inequality and unhappiness, and so books were banned. After Beatty leaves, Montag reveals to Mildred that he has hidden several books in the house. They begin reading, but he finds the books hard to understand, and Mildred prefers TV.\n\nMontag remembers that he has the phone number and address of a retired English professor, Faber. Thinking that he may have the last printed copy of the Bible, Montag heads to Faber’s home while trying to memorize passages from the work. Montag asks Faber to teach him to understand books, and Faber agrees. When Montag arrives home, Mildred is watching TV with two friends, one of whom announces that her husband has been drafted to fight in the current war. Montag attempts to engage the women in conversation about their lives and politics. When he begins reading aloud from a poetry collection, one of Mildred’s friends begins crying, while the other is angered, saying that this is why books are banned.\n\nThe next day at work, Montag and the other firemen go out on a call, and it turns out that it is Montag’s house that is to be burned down. Montag is informed that Mildred was the one who reported him, and she leaves in a taxi without talking to her husband. After Captain Beatty orders Montag to burn the house down, he obeys and then turns the flamethrower on Beatty, killing him. He flees to Faber’s home, and the retired professor tells him that he can escape by following railroad lines to the countryside. Montag evades the intensive manhunt and later encounters a group of men sitting around a bonfire. Their leader, Granger, tells him that each of them has memorized a book in hopes of using the knowledge to rebuild society. They then watch as bombs destroy the city. Afterward the men head back to the city to begin the task of starting civilization anew."
