        "text": "I decided to participate in this year’s Readers Imbibing Peril challenge as a way to get into the Halloween spirit. The idea is to read a book that gets you into that autumnal mood, whether it’s horror, mystery, dark fantasy, or some other chilling genre. For this week’s installment, I thought I would reread one of my favorite books from one of my favorite authors. Recently, I wrote about my utter devotion to Ray Bradbury, a writer who helped shape my childhood. From the Dust Returned brings together a collection of fun tales centered around a supernatural family and their adopted human child who acts as the family historian. More poetry than prose, this book was a beautiful reminder of the reasons why Bradbury’s books will forever be a part of my home.\n\nI first discovered Ray Bradbury during a time when I felt like a complete outcast. In school, I was mercilessly bullied and the subject of constant ridicule. There were moments when I felt like I didn’t have a friend in the world. Books became my constant companions, and one of these was a collection of short stories called The October Country by Ray Bradbury. These dark tales spoke to me, but the loudest was a little story about a family reunion of monsters called “Homecoming.” I remember being immediately drawn to this family of ghouls, vampires, and other supernatural beings. There was Great Grandmère, the ancient mummified matriarch who lives in the attic. Then there was Uncle Einar who could take to the skies thanks to his mighty wings. The most compelling character had to be Cecy, a witch whose body was always asleep while her soul moved around the world inhabiting any living being she desired. When you feel like a monster yourself, you learn to take solace in other monsters.\n\nTimothy was the member of the Elliot family who felt like an outcast himself. Left on their doorstep when he was a baby and charged with the job of chronicling their exploits, Timothy is mortal. He has no special powers. For these reasons, he never truly fits in. I could relate to Timothy, and I think Bradbury did a beautiful job of capturing that sense of loneliness:\n\n“Please, please help me to grow to be like them, the ones’ll soon be here, who never grow old, can’t die, that’s what they say, can’t die, no matter what, or maybe they died a long time ago but Cecy calls, and Mother and Father call, and Grandmère who only whispers, and now they’re coming and I’m nothing, not like them who pass through walls and live in trees or live underneath until seventeen-year rains flood them up and out, and the ones who run in packs, let me be one! If they live forever, why not me?”\n\n“Homecoming” was originally published in 1946, and over the years, Bradbury would continue to write short stories centering around a specific member of the magical Elliot family. “Uncle Einar” was another favorite of mine about what happens when the title character loses his ability to fly. “The April Witch” was a beautiful story about finding love from the perspective of Cecy. From the Dust Returned contains all of these stories with linking material to give the book the shape of a novel. It works for the most part. However, there are moments that felt a bit out of place. The book definitely feels more like a collection of stories surrounding “Homecoming” than as a tightly plotted novel. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as many of the individual stories themselves are highly memorable.\n\nFollowing the family reunion, the story focuses on the turmoil due to the encroaching modern world. The time of monsters is rapidly coming to an end, so now the creatures themselves begin to feel like outcasts. There is a sense of desperation felt as the family attempts to find ways to continue forward.\n\nAlthough the writing is beautiful and lyrical, sometimes it lacks depth. Nobody writes like Bradbury, but sometimes the style smothers potential substance. Although the book itself is quite short, it does require the best attention out of the reader as often I felt like I was reading a book of poetry rather than a work of prose. For example, take this line:\n\n“When every bed ached to be occupied by strange snows and every banister anticipated the down-slide of creatures more pollen than substance, when every window, warped with ages, distorted faces looking from shadows, when every empty chair seemed occupied by things unseen, when every carpet desired invisible footfalls and the water pump on the back stoop inhaled, sucking vile liquors toward a surface abandoned because of the possible upchuck of nightmares… there was Anuba. Clothed in a fine pelt of arrogance, her quiet engine quieter, centuries before limousines”.\n\nNobody can argue that Bradbury’s writing packs a punch. He is often accused of being flowery and sentimental, which quite frankly I enjoy to some degree. However, others may not hold this sentiment. Honestly, I couldn’t tell you what “sucking vile liquors toward a surface abandoned” actually means, but you have to admit the man has a way with words.\n\nBradbury makes some strong points in this book. Being different is good. Do everything with a passion. Most importantly, not all monsters are bad. It’s a beautiful work worthy of your time. Many of the chapters stand out beautifully, such as “On the Orient North” and “The Wandering Witch.” If nothing else, read the short story “Homecoming” which serves as the basis of the book. I dare you not be moved to some degree. Some of the ideas may be a tad cliché, but quite frankly I enjoy the idea of mummies in the attic and spirits searching for true love. I’m happy to have reread this book as it served as a sort of homecoming for me and a strong reminder of why I love blogging about books.\n\n“I want to do something to make them see me, make me as fine as them, something to make me belong….”"
