        "text": "Science fiction literature pioneer Ray Bradbury, whose works included \"Fahrenheit 451\" and \"The Martian Chronicles,\" died overnight. He was 91.\n\nHis passing was confirmed by io9 through his family and biographer, as well as by USA Today through his daughter.\n\nCNET contacted the Bradbury family for confirmation. We'll update the story when we get a response.\n\nBradbury wrote one of the quintessential dystopian novels with \"Fahrenheit 451,\" practically required reading for many high-school students. He also authored the script for the 1956 film \"Moby Dick\" and wrote scripts for the classic TV show \"The Twilight Zone,\" with many of his stories forming the basis for television shows, radio, and films.\n\nHis impact on the science fiction world was evident in the Ray Bradbury Award, which is presented by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America and named in Bradbury's honor.\n\nWhile his novels offered many technological predictions, he personally expressed skepticism about the value of technology to society, and whether the Internet and cell phones brought people together or kept them apart.\n\nIn 2004, Bradbury was awarded a National Medal of Arts. The National Endowment for the Arts wrote this in its citation accompanying the award to Bradbury:\n\nFor his incomparable contributions to American fiction as one of its great storytellers who, through his explorations of science and space, has illuminated the human condition.\n\nThe author of The Martian Chronicles and Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury is the greatest living American writer of science fiction. His singular achievement in this genre is rooted in the imaginative originality of his works, his gift for language, his insights into the human condition, and his commitment to the freedom of the individual.\n\nBradbury married Marguerite McClure, who passed away in 2003, and had four daughters."
