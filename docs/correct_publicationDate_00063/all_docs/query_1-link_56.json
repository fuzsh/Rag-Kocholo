        "text": "About the Book[]\n\nAwards: 1954 Retro Hugo, awarded 2004\n\nGenres: Dystopian\n\nTheme:\n\nNarrative style:\n\nOverview[]\n\nFahrenheit 451 is a 1953 dystopian novel by American writer Ray Bradbury. Often regarded as one of his best works, the novel presents a future American society where books are outlawed and \"firemen\" burn any that are found. The book's tagline explains the title as \"'the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and burns\": the autoignition temperature of paper. The lead character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who becomes disillusioned with his role of censoring literature and destroying knowledge, eventually quitting his job and committing himself to the preservation of literary and cultural writings.\n\nThe novel has been the subject of interpretations focusing on the historical role of book burning in suppressing dissenting ideas for change. In a 1956 radio interview, Bradbury said that he wrote Fahrenheit 451 because of his concerns at the time (during the McCarthy era) about the threat of book burning in the United States. In later years, he described the book as a commentary on how mass media reduces interest in reading literature.\n\nIn 2004, Fahrenheit 451 was awarded the Retro-Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1954.[1]\n\nDescription[]\n\nGuy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But when he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.\n\nRatings[]\n\nBook Content Ratings Hover over Icons for text rating.

Shortly after the paperback, a hardback version was released that included a special edition of 200 signed and numbered copies bound in asbestos. These were technically collections because the novel was published with two short stories: The Playground and And the Rock Cried Out, which have been absent in later printings. A few months later, the novel was serialized in the March, April, and May 1954 issues of nascent Playboy magazine.[1]\n\n[]\n\nOpen Library is a project of the Internet Archives\n\nFahrenheit 451 at the Open Library (Click here to check out the complete book)"
