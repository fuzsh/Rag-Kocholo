        "text": "**SPOILER ALERT**\n\nI somehow missed reading Bradbury’s classic in school and never picked it up on my own—until now. Even though there are some elements that date the book (it was written in 1953), I found many themes and questions identical to those of the present and even more relevant today. The writing is lovely. The sentence structure is varied: Bradbury writes long sentences that are clear and comprehensible; Bradbury’s vocabulary is wide-ranging and pointed much more so than in today’s popular books. Toward the end of the book is a paragraph narrating a group of men frying bacon. The sentences are deliciously staccato, mimicking the sizzle of bacon grease in a pan.\n\nThe Characters\n\nAll are one-dimensional and unnuanced, but this style is necessary for a story characterizing each person as an archetype—Montag/hero, Clarissa/ingenue, etc.\n\nThe broader themes of violence, censorship, anti-intellectualism, social pressure, consumerism, and war can all be explored on a deeper level. The reader expects only the main character, Montag, to be transformed as he completes the mythical hero’s journey.\n\nWomen\n\nWomen are portrayed in extreme stereotypes but this in keeping with the context of the 1950s when the book was published. Mildred, Montag’s wife, is the epitome of self-absorption and consumerism. On the other hand, Clarissa, his neighbor, is a wise-beyond-her-years teenager who speaks in truths that Montag is unable to ignore. Of course, Clarissa is killed and Mildred turns her husband in for possession of books.\n\nMan vs. Nature\n\nThe ending cements the narration as a ‘man’ story. Montag meets intellectual men on the run from persecution because they are scholars; their live revolved around proven knowledge and critical thinking. There is a strange friction between Montag and the wilderness. He is both frightened and calmed by the darkness. I suppose the reader could interpret these feelings as rebirth of the hero. He is transforming himself from an unthinking, programmed citizen to a sentient individual.\n\nThe most interesting part of the story was Beatty’s rant against the individual. Books burn at 451 degrees Fahrenheit. But it was not a sudden act of government to burn books but the result of society’s devolution to a less-thinking form of human willingly. He explains that screencasts made it possible to send messages in shorter and shorter sound bites. People consumed these short snippets, because they helped humans stay happy and unworried. Not too much thinking goes into digesting a headline. Beatty says that Western classical literature has been edited and revised down from large tomes to single pages. This is not a jump in imagination for readers now accustomed to shorts and reels. There is an entire industry on digital book platforms that sells overviews of long nonfiction books to free readers from the constraints of logic and analysis. And sometimes the original book is not even long! With a shorter and shorter form, there is less and less to engage with; there is nothing to support critical thinking. It is easier to consume distractions through video experiences, shopping, and virtual realities than to discuss the existing troubles in human societies. What is it that art and literature bring to the human condition? They delve into the suffering and joy of people and the world. They make readers think and decide what their life is and what it might become.\n\nYes, Fahrenheit 451 is still relevant."
