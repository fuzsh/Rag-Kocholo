        "text": "“What are Ray Bradbury’s Best Books?” We looked at all of Bradburys authored bibliography and ranked them against one another to answer that very question!\n\nWe took all of the books written by Ray Bradbury and looked at their Goodreads, Amazon, and LibraryThing scores, ranking them against one another to see which books came out on top. The books are ranked in our list below based on which titles have the highest overall score between all 3 review sites in comparison with all of the other books by the same author. The process isn’t super scientific and in reality, most books aren’t “better” than other books as much as they are just different. That being said, we do enjoy seeing where our favorites landed, and if you aren’t familiar with the author at all, the rankings can help you see what books might be best to start with.\n\nThe full ranking chart is also included below the countdown on the bottom of the page.\n\nHappy Scrolling!\n\nThe Top Book’s Of Ray Bradbury\n\n82 ) Thomas Jefferson\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 76\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 72\n\nExamines the life of the multitalented man who is remembered as the third president of the United States as well as the writer of the Declaration of Independence and the founder of the University of Virginia.\n\n81 ) Orange County\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 74\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 72\n\n80 ) Let’s All Kill Constance\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 73\n\nAmazon: 61\n\nLibraryThing: 71\n\nOn a dismal evening in the previous century, an unnamed writer in Venice, California, answers a furious pounding at his beachfront bungalow door and again admits Constance Rattigan into his life. An aging, once-glamorous Hollywood star, Constance is running in fear from something she dares not acknowledge — and vanishes as suddenly as she appeared, leaving the narrator two macabre books: twin listings of the Tinseltown dead and soon to be dead, with Constance’s name included among them.\n\n79 ) Leviathan 99\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 67\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 64\n\n78 ) The Cat’s Pajamas\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 76\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 53\n\n77 ) The Haunted Computer and The Android Pope\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 71\n\nAmazon: 59\n\nLibraryThing: 61\n\n76 ) The Art Of Playboy\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 72\n\nAmazon: 46\n\nLibraryThing: 72\n\n75 ) Ahmed and The Oblivion Machines\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 65\n\nAmazon: 56\n\nLibraryThing: 56\n\nBradbury’s “Ahmed and the Oblivion Macines” is a fable for adults and children alike about the importance of letting dreams take flight. It is the adventure of the daydreaming Ahmed, the twelve year-old son of a caravan leader. During an evening trek across the desert, Ahmed falls from his camel and is left behind only to discover and awaken the ancient god Gonn-Ben-Allah. The god, thankful for his salvation, bestows on Ahmed the gift of flight and together they journey through space and time, witnessing the wonders of the world yet-to-come or that-has-been. It is this journey, in true mythological fashion, that transforms the child by bestowing him wisdom and granting him the courage to make his dreams come true.\n\n73 ) The Dragon Who Ate His Tail\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 49\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 59\n\n73 ) We’Ll Always Have Paris\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 61\n\nAmazon: 63\n\nLibraryThing: 51\n\nOver the course of a storied literary career that has spanned more than half a century, Ray Bradbury has taken us to wonderful places: across vast oceans to foreign lands, onto summer porches of small-town America, through dark and dangerous forests where predators wait, into the hypnotic mists of dream, back to a halcyon past to remember, forward into an exhilarating future, and rocketing through outer space. In We’ll Always Have Paris—a new collection of never-before-published stories—the inimitable Bradbury once again does what few writers have ever done as well. He delights us with prose that soars and sings. He surprises and inspires, exposing truths and provoking deep thought.\n\n72 ) They Have Not Seen the Stars\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 54\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 53\n\n71 ) Frost and Fire\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 63\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 43\n\n70 ) Farewell Summer\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 54\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 48\n\nIn a summer that refuses to end, in the deceiving warmth of earliest October, civil war has come to Green Town, Illinois. It is the age-old conflict: the young against the elderly, for control of the clock that ticks their lives ever forward. The first cap-pistol shot heard ’round the town is dead accurate, felling an old man in his tracks, compelling town elder and school board despot Mr. Calvin C. Quartermain to marshal his graying forces and declare total war on the assassin, thirteen-year-old Douglas Spaulding, and his downy-cheeked cohorts. Doug and his cronies, however, are most worthy adversaries who should not be underestimated, as they plan and execute daring campaigns—matching old Quartermain’s experience and cunning with their youthful enthusiasm and devil-may-care determination to hold on forever to childhood’s summer. Yet time must ultimately be the victor, with valuable revelations for those on both sides of the conflict.\n\n69 ) One More For the Road\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 56\n\nAmazon: 54\n\nLibraryThing: 57\n\nEerie and strange, nostalgic and bittersweet, searching and speculative, here are 25 stories: of a father’s regrets, a lover’s last embrace, a child’s dreams of the future–delivered with Bradbury’s wit and style.\n\n67 ) The Smile\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 37\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 61\n\nIn 2061, in a world ravaged by war and filled with hatred for the past, a young boy is present at the destruction of the Mona Lisa.\n\n67 ) The Last Circus the Electrocution\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 76\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 22\n\n66 ) Where Everything Ends\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 75\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 22\n\n65 ) Driving Blind\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 58\n\nAmazon: 46\n\nLibraryThing: 58\n\nReading Ray Bradbury is like going through a door into a nostalgic, odd America that never existed, a universe of strange possibility that brings to mind the haunting memories of childhood. The short stories in Driving Blind are vintage Bradbury, with a pleasant smattering of ideas: dark fantasy, boyhood sense of wonder, Twilight Zone-esque twist.\n\n64 ) The Mummies Of Guanajuato\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 30\n\nAmazon: 59\n\nLibraryThing: 72\n\n63 ) The Toynbee Convector\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 49\n\nAmazon: 61\n\nLibraryThing: 50\n\n62 ) Pillar Of Fire and Other Plays\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 40\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 49\n\n61 ) Where Robot Mice and Robot Men Run Round In Robot Towns\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 70\n\nAmazon: 14\n\nLibraryThing: 69\n\n58 ) With Cat For Comforter\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 42\n\nAmazon: 46\n\nLibraryThing: 61\n\n58 ) Death Is a Lonely Business\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 49\n\nAmazon: 56\n\nLibraryThing: 44\n\nThe image of drowned circus cages in the trash-filled canals of Venice, California, both haunts and illuminates famed fantasy and science fiction author Ray Bradbury’s rare venture into the mystery field. Like filmmaker Federico Fellini, Bradbury is fascinated by the seedy splendor of cheap carnivals and circuses–“a long time before, in the early Twenties, these cages had probably rolled by like bright summer storms with animals prowling them, lions opening their mouths to exhale hot meat breaths. Teams of white horses had dragged their pomp through Venice and across the fields.” But now it’s the early 1950s, and foggy, shabby Venice is the last stop on the circus train for scores of old silent-movie stars and young writers trying to keep their art and their bodies alive. As Bradbury’s autobiographical hero, a young writer, pounds out his short stories, someone is killing off the older denizens of the tacky city. The writer joins forces with a quirky detective called Elmo Crumley and a faded screen star to investigates the deaths.\n\n58 ) The Anthem Sprinters\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 76\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 72\n\n57 ) Dark They Were and Golden Eyed\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 13\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 64\n\n55 ) George Washington\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 4\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 72\n\n55 ) Quicker Than the Eye\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 52\n\nAmazon: 40\n\nLibraryThing: 51\n\nThe internationally acclaimed author of The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, and Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury is a magician at the height of his powers, displaying his sorcerer’s skill with twenty-one remarkable stories that run the gamut from total reality to light fantastic, from high noon to long after midnight. A true master tells all, revealing the strange secret of growing young and mad; opening a Witch Door that links two intolerant centuries; joining an ancient couple in their wild assassination games; celebrating life and dreams in the unique voice that has favored him across six decades and has enchanted millions of readers the world over.\n\n54 ) The Other Foot\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 45\n\nAmazon: 26\n\nLibraryThing: 70\n\nAmerican blacks, settled on Mars after centuries of abuse on earth, have a chance for revenge when a space ship bearing a white man arrives seeking help in the aftermath of World War III.\n\n53 ) Death Has Lost Its Charm For Me\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 66\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 72\n\n52 ) A Chapbook For Burnt-Out Priests, Rabbis, and Ministers\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 67\n\nAmazon: 65\n\nLibraryThing: 6\n\n50 ) The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 37\n\nAmazon: 67\n\nLibraryThing: 32\n\n50 ) From the Dust Returned\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 53\n\nAmazon: 43\n\nLibraryThing: 40\n\nHigh on a hill by a forked tree, the House beckons its family homeward, and they come–travelers from the lyrical, lush imagination of Ray Bradbury. From the Dust Returned chronicles a community of eternal beings: a mummified matriarch who speaks in dust; a sleeping daughter who lives through the eyes and ears of the creatures she visits in her dreams; an uncle with wings like sea-green sails. And there is also the mortal child Timothy, the foundling son who yearns to be like those he loves: to fly, to sleep in daytime, and to live forever. Instead, his task is to witness the family’s struggle with the startling possibility of its own end.\n\n49 ) Nemo\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 59\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 72\n\nBetween 1905 and 1914, American cartoonist Winsor McCay created the comic strip known alternately as Little Nemo in slumberland and In the land of wondrous dreams.\n\n48 ) Now and Forever\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 57\n\nAmazon: 29\n\nLibraryThing: 45\n\nTwo dazzling new novellas from the celebrated author of Fahrenheit 451.

Or Ray Bradbury’s classic The Halloween Tree. Eight boys set out on a Halloween night and are led into the depths of the past by a tall, mysterious character named Moundshroud. They ride on a black wind to autumn scenes in distant lands and times, where they witness other ways of celebrating this holiday about the dark time of year. Bradbury’s lyrical prose whooshes along with the pell-mell rhythms of children running at night, screaming and laughing, and the reader is carried along by its sheer exuberance. Bradbury’s stories about children are always attended by dread–of change, adulthood, death. The Halloween Tree, while sweeter than his adult literature, is also touched at moments by the cold specter of loss–which is only fitting, of course, for a holiday in honor of the waning of the sun.\n\n25 ) A Sound Of Thunder\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 17\n\nAmazon: 65\n\nLibraryThing: 18\n\nUnbelievable as it may seem, Stephen Crane had neither been in battle nor a member of any army when he wrote The Red Badge of Courage.\n\n25 ) When Elephants Last In the Dooryard Bloomed\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 64\n\nAmazon: 14\n\nLibraryThing: 22\n\n24 ) Zen the Art Of Writing\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 17\n\nAmazon: 46\n\nLibraryThing: 30\n\nEvery morning I jump out of bed and step on a land mine.

In this exuberant book, the incomparable Ray Bradbury shares the wisdom, experience, and excitement of a lifetime of writing. Here are practical tips on the art of writing from a master of the craft-everything from finding original ideas to developing your own voice and style-as well as the inside story of Bradbury’s own remarkable career as a prolific author of novels, stories, poems, films, and plays.\n\n23 ) Timeless Stories For Today and Tomorrow\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 26\n\nAmazon: 40\n\nLibraryThing: 26\n\n21 ) Masks\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 17\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 64\n\n21 ) A Medicine For Melancholy and Other Stories\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 17\n\nAmazon: 29\n\nLibraryThing: 36\n\n20 ) Fahrenheit 451\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 34\n\nAmazon: 29\n\nLibraryThing: 18\n\n19 ) Homecoming\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 21\n\nAmazon: 46\n\nLibraryThing: 9\n\n18 ) Switch On the Night\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 24\n\nAmazon: 22\n\nLibraryThing: 28\n\nA LONELY LITTLE boy who is scared of the dark sits in his room alone, with only light for company, until a little girl named Dark appears and shows him that light switches don’t just switch off the light—they switch on the night.

Yet all his work is united by one common thread: a vivid and profound understanding of the vast seet of emotionsthat bring strength and mythic resonance to our frail species. Ray Bradbury characters may find themselves anywhere and anywhen. A horrified mother may give birth to a strange blue pyramid. A man may take Abraham Linkoln out of the grave–and meet another who puts him back. An amazing Electrical Grandmother may come to live with a grieving family. An old parrort may have learned over long evenings to imitate the voice of Ernest Hemingway, and become the last link to the last link to the great man.\n\n13 ) The October Country\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 10\n\nAmazon: 37\n\nLibraryThing: 18\n\nRay Bradbury’s first short story collection is back in print, its chilling encounters with funhouse mirrors, parasitic accident-watchers, and strange poker chips intact. Both sides of Bradbury’s vaunted childhood nostalgia are also on display, in the celebratory “Uncle Einar,” and haunting “The Lake,” the latter a fine elegy to childhood loss.\n\n12 ) Dandelion White\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 21\n\nAmazon: 29\n\nLibraryThing: 14\n\nWorld-renowned fantasist Ray Bradbury has on several occasions stepped outside the arenas of horror, fantasy, and science fiction. An unabashed romantic, his first novel in 1957 was basically a love letter to his childhood. (For those who want to undertake an even more evocative look at the dark side of youth, five years later the author would write the chilling classic Something Wicked This Way Comes.\n\n10 ) The Martian Chronicles\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 13\n\nAmazon: 29\n\nLibraryThing: 16\n\nWritten in the 1940s, the chronicles drip with nostalgic atmosphere–shady porches with tinkling pitchers of lemonade, grandfather clocks, chintz-covered sofas. But longing for this comfortable past proves dangerous in every way to Bradbury’s characters–the golden-eyed Martians as well as the humans. Starting in the far-flung future of 1999, expedition after expedition leaves Earth to investigate Mars. The Martians guard their mysteries well, but they are decimated by the diseases that arrive with the rockets. Colonists appear, most with ideas no more lofty than starting a hot-dog stand, and with no respect for the culture they’ve displaced. Bradbury’s quiet exploration of a future that looks so much like the past is sprinkled with lighter material. In “The Silent Towns,” the last man on Mars hears the phone ring and ends up on a comical blind date. But in most of these stories, Bradbury holds up a mirror to humanity that reflects a shameful treatment of “the other,” yielding, time after time, a harvest of loneliness and isolation.\n\n10 ) The Small Assassin\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 26\n\nAmazon: 22\n\nLibraryThing: 10\n\n9 ) Match To Flame\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 1\n\nAmazon: 53\n\nLibraryThing: 3\n\n8 ) There Will Come Soft Rains\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 7\n\nAmazon: 43\n\nLibraryThing: 5\n\n7 ) Twice Twenty-Two\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 6\n\nAmazon: 37\n\nLibraryThing: 7\n\n6 ) The Veldt\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 9\n\nAmazon: 26\n\nLibraryThing: 13\n\n5 ) S Is For Space\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 16\n\nAmazon: 14\n\nLibraryThing: 14\n\n4 ) The Autumn People\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 13\n\nAmazon: 14\n\nLibraryThing: 8\n\n3 ) The Stories Of Ray Bradbury\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 3\n\nAmazon: 20\n\nLibraryThing: 4\n\nThe Stories of Ray Bradbury–a hundred of his best stories, selected by the author himself–is the definitive collection of one of the greatest fantasists the world has ever known. Published in 1980, the volume contains stories selected from the first four decades of Bradbury’s career. There are his unique stories of Mars, which later landed in The Martian Chronicles. There are nostalgic stories of Green Town, Illinois, which Bradbury later brewed into Dandelion Wine.\n\n2 ) Selected From Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 24\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 1\n\n1 ) The Vintage Bradbury\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 4\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 10\n\nAs tersely stated on the cover, this is “Ray Bradbury’s own selection of his best stories.” The Vintage Bradbury contains 22 classic stories, plus four chapters excerpted from his first mainstream novel, Dandelion Wine. His career as an author was only about 15 years old when he compiled this volume in 1965 for the prestigious Vintage imprint. Like the vast majority of his collections, it has never been out of print. Bradbury’s own selection of “his best” is also intriguing because most of the stories chosen are from the beginning of his career, and most are quite hauntingly sad. “The Illustrated Man” relates the ultimate fate of the tattooed title character from the novel of the same name.\n\nRay Bradbury’s Best Books\n\nRay Bradbury Review Website Bibliography Rankings"
