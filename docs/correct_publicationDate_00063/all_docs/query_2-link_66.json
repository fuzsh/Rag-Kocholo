        "text": "Ray Bradbury\n\nFahrenheit 451\n\nFahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a classic dystopian novel that explores a future where books are banned and \"firemen\" burn them. The protagonist, fireman Guy Montag, undergoes a profound transformation after meeting a free-spirited neighbor, leading him to question and ultimately rebel against a society that suppresses literature and critical thinking. The novel, recognized for its potent defense of intellectual freedom and critique of censorship, has inspired various adaptations and continues to resonate with readers since its publication in 1953.\n\nThis copy is signed & inscribed by Bradbury in 1955: \"For Gordon Martin / with the good / wishes of / Ray Bradbury / Mar. 22, 1955.\"\n\nHardcover. First Edition, First Printing. Octavo, cloth. New York: Ballantine Books, 1953. Pringle, Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels (8). #10024.\n\nThere is some rubbing to edges of boards and very faint staining or discoloring to page edges. No odor or crimping to pages though. Book is tight and interior is clean. Jacket one short closed tear on front cover and some slight loss at crown of spine and tips of folds. Otherwise, jacket is nearly fine with hardly any fading to the red lettering of \"451\" on the spine, as is common with this title. Overall, very good+ copy in original dust jacket."
