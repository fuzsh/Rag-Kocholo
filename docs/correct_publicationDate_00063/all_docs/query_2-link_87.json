        "text": "Fahrenheit 451 - the temperature that paper burns, and the title of Ray Bradbury's hauntingly prophetic classic novel is set in the not too distant future, where books are burned by a special task force called 'firemen'.\n\nOne such fireman, and our protagonist, is Guy Montag. His sole job in this world is to burn books, which have been deemed the source of all unhappiness and discord and society needs to be 'protected'.\n\nEven with his role, which is deemed to be a noble profession, much like our firefighters and service men and women, Montag is unhappy. His marriage is broken and the reader starts to believe that books are hidden within his own house.\n\nThe consequence for preserving or reading books? The Mechanical Hound of the fire department is armed with a lethal hypodermic, escorted by a barrage of helicopters, ready to track down those dissidents who defy society in this way.\n\nThis timeless novel of a post-literate future stands alongside the greats, Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984 and is a prophetic and intriguing commentary of Western civilisation's enslavement by the media, drugs and conformity.\n\nBradbury's poetic and powerful prose combines into the potential of technology to create such a novel which after 50 years since being released to the world, still has the power to dazzle and shock.\n\nThe one assumption many make after reading this book, is that the dystopian government burnt books because they wanted to control thought and not allow humans to be inspired by the spark of ideas that books encourage; perhaps that one part of it. The harrowing and perhaps more telling reason, is that the government burns books because they deem that human beings prefer to feel safe and spoon fed content rather than be forced to experience the flux that books can create inside.\n\nVery apt read at this very unique time in history where we're all forced to stay at home and many of us are opting for streaming Netflix/Stan/Prime over a good book that may challenge us.\n\nDuring isolation, I challenge you to give this one a go ðŸ‘Š\n\nHappy Reading all!\n\nCPH"
