        "text": "The sky wasn't the limit for Ray Bradbury. As a boy reading his beloved Buck Rogers comic strips, he dreamed of reaching for the stars.\n\nAnd that's where his imagination took him – to the stars, to Mars, to the future, to literary greatness. He generously took us with him on these thrilling journeys.\n\nBradbury, the ever-boyish fantasy master who enchanted generations of readers with his stirring visions of Martian landscapes and futuristic societies, died Tuesday night. He was 91.\n\nAmong Bradbury's best-known works were his 1953 cautionary tale about a book-burning futuristic society, \"Fahrenheit 451,\" and his 1962 horror novel about a malignant carnival, \"Something Wicked This Way Comes.\" His 1950 breakthrough book \"The Martian Chronicles,\" was a collection of related stories about materialistic Earthmen attempting to colonize Mars.\n\n\"His work is as necessary as the air we breathe,\" Cleveland native Harlan Ellison said Wednesday of his longtime friend and fellow grand master in the realm of fantasy, science fiction and horror. \"He's a world-class writer – nonpareil. His writing changed the face of American fiction half a dozen times.\"\n\nAuthor and critic Christopher Isherwood hailed the publication of \"The Martian Chronicles\" as the arrival of \"a very great and unusual talent.\" Armed with such glowing reviews from mainstream newspapers and magazines, the incredibly influential Bradbury made the case for the literary respectability of fantasy, science fiction and horror.\n\nAlmost every writer working in one of these related fields owes a debt to Bradbury. His use of metaphor, satire, irony, complicated plots and poetic passages won over critics who viewed fantasy as a lesser genre.\n\nAsked for his thoughts on Bradbury's death, Stephen King e-mailed these comments: \"Ray Bradbury wrote three great novels and 300 great stories. One of the latter was called 'A Sound of Thunder.' The sound I hear today is the thunder of a giant's footsteps fading away. But the novels and stories remain, in all their resonance and strange beauty.\"\n\nThe Bantam Books paperback editions of his works identified Bradbury as \"the world's greatest living science-fiction writer.\" Actually, Bradbury wasn't a science-fiction author in the tradition of writers who go to great lengths to justify the science part of that equation (think Arthur C. Clarke or Robert Heinlein).\n\nHis works often suggested science fiction, to be sure. Most, including the space tales, fell into the fantasy realm, however, and he also loved trying his hand at horror and mystery.\n\nBut Bradbury lay claim to a much broader realm -- ideas. \"Bradbury deserves special attention,\" The Saturday Review of Literature declared in 1951. \"His stories are memorable not only for the ideas they embody but also for their legitimate human values.\"\n\n\"I am an idea writer,\" Bradbury told me during one of our many conversations in the 1980s and early '90s. \"Any idea that strikes me, I'll do it . . . Now, some of that will inevitably get you back to science fiction. Because America is a science-fiction country. We are the most technologically advanced, idea-oriented country in the world. You grow up with scientific advancements and then have Buck Rogers appear in the Sunday paper and you can smell the future coming swiftly toward you. It's exciting.\"\n\nThat's how Bradbury grew up, his imagination shaped by Buck Rogers, Tarzan and Martian adventures penned by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tom Swift tales and stories by Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. He never lost touch with this boyhood, and many of his stories are tinged with a warm nostalgia for those times.\n\nBut the fears of that childhood also stayed with him, informing many of his darker stories.\n\n\"The older I got, there was Aldous Huxley, Mark Twain Edgar Allan Poe, Washington Irving, Bernard Shaw, Walt Whitman, Herman Melville, Charles Dickens and Shakespeare,\" he told me during the years when were working together on a book. \"They have been a constant throughout.\"\n\nThe book we were working on never got finished. It was interrupted by other projects and ultimately abandoned. But the process allowed me the privilege of regularly getting inside this endlessly imaginative writer’s mind.\n\nBorn on Aug. 22, 1920, in Waukeagan, Ill., Raymond Douglas Bradbury sold his first short story in 1941. The budding writer established his reputation with a steady output of tales published in the science-fiction magazines of the time.\n\nHis horror stories were collected in \"The October Country\" (1955). The evocative and sentimental stories about his Midwest childhood were turned into \"Dandelion Wine\" (1957). Other collections of short stories included \"The Illustrated Man\" (1951), \"The Golden Apples of the Sun\" (1953), \"A Medicine for Melancholy\" (1959), \"The Machineries of Joy\" (1964) and \"I Sing the Body Electric!\" (1969).\n\nBradbury's family moved to Los Angeles in 1934, and there he remained. In the 1950s and '60s, he became the leader of the Group, a circle of fantasy writers, including frequent \"Twilight Zone\" contributor Richard Matheson (\"I A Legend,\" \"The Shrinking Man\").\n\n\"He was our mentor,\" Matheson said Wednesday during a phone interview. \"He was our hero. He helped all of us in countless generous ways. And he elevated the genre. He made it into a class act.\"\n\n\"The Martian Chronicles\" was turned into a 1980 miniseries. \"Fahrenheit 451,\" \"The Illustrated Man\" and \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" were made into movies. And Bradbury adapted many of his stories for \"The Ray Bradbury Theater,\" an anthology series that started in 1985 on HBO, then moved to USA.\n\nBradbury is survived by his four daughters. His wife of 56 years, Marguerite, died in 2003.\n\n\"We lost someone who, unlike most authors today, will be known and read 200 years from now,\" said Barry Hoffman, founder of Gauntlet, the Colorado company that has published 11 books by Bradbury. \"Censorship will never die, and as long as there's censorship, people will be reading 'Fahrenheit 451.' \"\n\nSlowed by a stroke, he nonetheless remained a joyful and compulsive writer in his 90s.\n\n\"Oh, it's always been easy,\" he said of writing. \"If you love a thing, everything's easy. You don't notice that you're working. I've always been in love with writing, so I've never worked one day in my life.\""
