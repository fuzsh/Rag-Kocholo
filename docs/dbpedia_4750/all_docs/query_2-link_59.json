        "text": "Children under 18 years of age are not required to present a photo ID at the security checkpoint. For more information please see the Traveling With Children page of the TSA web site.\n\nHowever, as each airline has its own requirements, please check with your airline directly to confirm its ID requirement for minors.\n\nYou will only be allowed through the security checkpoint for the Gate Area from which you are departing. However, due to the configuration of the Terminals A & B, it is possible to access either Gates 1-29 AND Gates 30-59, OR Gates 70-99 AND Gates 100-129 once you have passed through the security checkpoint for your gate.\n\nSimilarly on arrival in Terminals A or B, you may access either Gates 1-29 AND Gates 30-59, OR Gates 70-99 AND Gates 100-129 depending on the gate at which you arrive, by switching Gate Links (APM) in Terminals A & B. If you wish to access the other Gate Area which is paired with yours, go directly to the other Gate Link (APM) as soon as you disembark the Gate Link (APM) in Terminal A or B. Do not go past the security checkpoint and out into the Terminal otherwise you will NOT be allowed back through security to access the other Gate Area.\n\nPlease note that this may not be possible during certain times of the day for security reasons while international passengers are arriving in the terminal, which may require you to exit into the terminal and clear security again to access the other Gate Area.\n\nTerminal C only has one security checkpoint and so all gates may be accessed once you have passed through security.\n\nWireless internet access (Wi-Fi) is available in all public areas of the airport and is provided free of charge. These Access Points provided by the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) use the WiFi SSID “MCO Internet”. Other access points and peer-to-peer connections which may be listed as available networks are NOT provided by GOAA.\n\nPlease note that “personal hotspot” devices interfere with the airport’s free Wi-Fi and so if you experience poor performance on the airport “MCO Internet” SSID, please try moving to another location away from other passengers’ active devices, and please help us conserve bandwidth by turning off personal hotspots when not in use.\n\nCellular/PCS wireless is also available from AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon.\n\nThere are also several kiosks which offer travelers internet connections, in addition to the standard dial service offered by the phone company via the RJ-11 jacks in the pay phones.\n\nAircraft spotting/photography is permitted on Level 9 and 10 of the Terminal Top Parking Garage above Terminals A & B, Level 6 of Parking Garage C near Terminal C and the South Park Place Economy Lot. The Terminal Top Parking Garage provides a panoramic view of most of the airfield and aircraft gates.\n\nTo access these areas, each person interested in plane spotting activities, or those accompanying minors, should complete the online form. A GOAA representative will review and return it to you. Please be prepared to present the form to airport staff upon request. If you would like to fill out the form in person, please come to the Aviation Authority Executive Offices between the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays), located in Terminal A, Level 3, the offices are to the left of the Security Checkpoint for Gates 70-129.\n\nYes! Visitors can pick up their pass at any of the six locations in Terminal A, B or C and will need to decline the rental car company’s toll program. Next, Visitor Toll Pass customers just add their rental car license plate number in the app, hang it on the rental car rearview mirror and leave the airport ready for non-stop travel. At the end of their trip, customers simply return the toll pass to one of 14 return drop boxes located throughout the airport. All tolls will be billed to the customer’s credit card associated with the pass with no additional fees or charges.\n\nPrivate vehicles may drop passengers off at the curb on Level 3 (Departures) at Terminal A or Terminal B, or Level 2 (Departures) at Terminal C. If you wish to park after dropping off passengers and luggage, follow signs to either Economy Parking or use the “Quick Park” ramp (located on the left, at the end of the Departures Curb) to access the Parking Garage A or B.\n\nAlthough dropping off passengers on the curb outside the Terminal is still permitted, vehicles may not be stationary unless actively unloading passengers and/or baggage, and under no circumstances may vehicles be left unattended.\n\nPicking up passengers at the Arrivals/Bag Claim Curb (Level 2) at Terminals A & B, or Level 6 of Terminal C is permitted; however, vehicles may not be stationary unless actively loading passengers and/or baggage, and under no circumstances may vehicles be left unattended. Therefore please use the FREE! Cell Phone Lots and allow at least 20 minutes after aircraft arrival time (40 minutes if passenger has checked baggage) to allow for passengers to transfer from the Gate Area to bag claim. To determine on which Terminal (A, B or C) your airline operates, please visit the Airlines page of our web site.\n\nAlthough only ticketed passengers are allowed through security and out to the gates, it is possible to have gate passes issued to non-travelers under certain circumstances. These are issued at the airline’s discretion, so please go to your airline’s ticket counter, provide a valid photo ID, and the airline will determine whether they are able to issue you a pass based on your particular circumstances.\n\nFor arrivals into Terminal C. you may apply for an Experience MCO Visitor Pass which allows approved guests to enjoy the amenities post-security in Terminal C.\n\nHold My Luggage operates in Terminal B, Level 1, offering:\n\nLuggage pickup/return\n\nLuggage storage (same day or multiple days)\n\nLuggage transport services (hotel to hotel or city to city)\n\nThe customer signs a waiver of liability while the staff tag their bags, and gives the customer a claim ticket. The customer is then free to roam about the city luggage-free.\n\nTo retrieve luggage the customer can return to the desk in Terminal B, Level 1, or have Hold My Luggage meet the customer at their airline check-in location.\n\nTerminal C features early bag storage within the baggage system. Please check with your airline to determine how far ahead of your flight you may check you baggage.\n\nPlease contact your airline directly regarding your missing item(s) as directed on your ticket or baggage receipt. Claims for missing items may also be filed with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is responsible for the screening of passengers and baggage at all U.S. airports.\n\nYou may also file a report with the Orlando Police Department, which has jurisdiction over thefts which occur at the Orlando International Airport. This may be done by calling the Orlando Police Department Information Desk, which is available 24 hours per day, at (407) 246-2470.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection web site (www.cbp.gov), foreign visitors to the United States frequently confuse the state sales tax with value-added tax (VAT). The state sales tax is a small tax on purchases or services, calculated at the time of purchase, which the individual states assess and which the U.S. federal government neither determines nor receives. VAT, on the other hand, is a national tax commonly applied in foreign countries that is included in the actual sales price of an item. The United States does not have a VAT, and the federal government cannot refund state sales taxes. Some states do not charge tax on items shipped out of state, therefore please ask about sales-tax policies in the state where you make your purchases.\n\nYes! The B-52 Memorial Park is located off Bear Road, adjacent to SR 528, and is open to the public. The park features a B-52D Stratofortress, Air Force Serial Number 56-0687, from the Strategic Air Command. The aircraft was at one time assigned to the 306th Bomb Wing of the now defunct McCoy Air Force Base (now Orlando International Airport). The bomber was built in 1956 and retired 28 years later in 1984. Final flight was from its last unit of assignment, the 7th Bomb Wing at Carswell AFB in Fort Worth, Texas, to the former McCoy AFB, on February 20, 1984.\n\nTo access the park, exit Jeff Fuqua Blvd. onto the Cargo Road ramp. Turn left onto Cargo Road, then right onto Bear Road. The park is located on the right, just before Bear Road turns parallel with SR 528.\n\nPlease visit the Contact page of our web site.\n\nYou may also visit Lost and Found in Terminal A on Level 1 (Ground Transportation) from 7:00am – 7:30pm daily, or in Terminal C on Level 1 (Ground Transportation) from 8:00am – 4:00pm daily.\n\nPlease note that Orlando International Airport does NOT charge a service fee, nor is affiliated with any company that charges a service fee, for assisting in locating lost items."
