        "text": "Getting around Boston Logan is easy and convenient. Use our interactive map or get step-by-step directions through the FlyLogan app to familiarize yourself with the airport.\n\nTerminals B, C, and E are connected post-security. Passengers making connections between flights in these terminals should be able to stay post-security and not need to be screened through a TSA security checkpoint again so long as the connection was booked through the same reservation and any checked luggage will be transported to the connecting flight by the airline. Please check with your airline directly for information regarding connections.\n\nTerminal A is not connected to the other terminals post-security. Passengers who arrive in Terminal A can connect pre-security using the pedestrian walkways between the terminals or Boston Loganâ€™s free On-Airport Shuttle bus system to connect to the other terminals. Check with your airline for other connecting options.\n\nSmarte Cartes are available throughout the airport pre-security for transporting luggage."
