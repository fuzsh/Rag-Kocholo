        "text": "Hey look, I was correct\n\nDelta Offers Customers New U.S. - Scandinavia Link with Daily Service to Denmark as Part of Ongoing International Expansion\n\nWednesday September 21, 12:00 pm ET\n\nThe Number one U.S. airline across the Atlantic will offer customers non-stop flights between Atlanta and Copenhagen in April 2006\n\nATLANTA, Sept. 21, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Just as the world's longest auto and railway span -- the Oresund Bridge -- now joins Denmark and Sweden, next April Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL - News) will provide international travelers with a new direct connection between the United States and Scandinavia. Beginning April 3, 2006, Delta will offer the only daily non-stop service between Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Copenhagen, Denmark, as part of its ongoing international expansion to global destinations.\n\nCopenhagen derives its name from the Danish words for 'merchant's harbor,' and today the city remains a center of commerce for Scandinavia and Northern Europe as well as a bustling cruise port,'' said Jorge Fernandez, Delta's vice president of International and Alliances. ``With Delta's new non-stop flight to Denmark's capital, we will offer customers 17 daily non-stop destinations between our largest hub and Europe alone, with more soon to come. Atlanta truly is Delta's gateway to the world.''\n\n``The new Copenhagen-Atlanta route is the first scheduled service ever between Scandinavia and the southern United States,'' said Niels Boserup, CEO - Copenhagen Airports. ``A growing number of Americans visit Copenhagen, and at the same time more Scandinavians are traveling to the U.S. With this route they will have new opportunities, and more people will be encouraged to travel across the Atlantic.''\n\nCustomers will enjoy the comfort of widebody aircraft on Delta's new flight between Atlanta and Copenhagen, and be able to experience the carrier's award-winning BusinessElite(TM) service. These new flights also bring added convenience and travel options for business and leisure travelers from Scandinavia, along with multiple opportunities for freight forwarders and cargo shippers.\n\nWith its upcoming fall and winter schedule, Delta will add to the 21 new international routes already introduced or announced since Jan. 1, 2005, including New York (JFK) to Chennai, India (via Paris); New York (JFK) to Berlin; Atlanta to Moscow; and Atlanta to Dusseldorf, Germany, to name just a few. These schedule enhancements maintain Delta's position as the number one airline across the Atlantic as well as a leading carrier to Latin America.\n\nDelta's new daily non-stop service between Atlanta and Copenhagen beginning April 3, 2006(b): Flight Departs Arrives 68 Atlanta at 6 p.m. Copenhagen at 9 a.m. (following day) 69 (a) Copenhagen at 11 a.m. Atlanta at 2:55 p.m. (a) Flight begins April 4 (b) Subject to Danish government approval\n\nCopenhagen Airport is the largest airport in Scandinavia and serves more than 19 million passengers annually.\n\nBye Bye--General Lee\n\nWill this help?\n\nDelta Strengthens Winter Schedule with More Flight Choices from Hubs, Expanded Point-to-Point Service in Northeast and New International Destinations\n\nWednesday September 21, 6:00 am ET\n\nChanges Continue Momentum of Network Redesign\n\nATLANTA, Sept. 21, 2005 (PRIMEZONE) -- Delta Air Lines' (NYSE:DAL - News) customers will enjoy increased non-stop access to regional business destinations, new point-to-point flying in key Northeast business markets, and expanded international service to Mexico as part of the airline's ongoing transformation to be more efficient and customer-focused. The changes, which begin as early as Dec. 1, support previously announced plans to strengthen Delta's domestic hubs and grow international schedules this winter.\n\nThe ongoing transformation of our network responds to customers' preferences for increased non-stop access to growing business destinations and expands Delta's presence on popular international routes,'' said Glen Hauenstein, executive vice president and chief of network and revenue management. ``This winter's changes, coupled with previous moves like right-sizing capacity at Cincinnati and de-hubbing service at Dallas/Fort Worth, represent the aggressive steps Delta is taking to increase the productivity and efficiency of our airline while at the same time improving service for customers.''\n\nIncreased non-stop service to regional business destinations\n\nBy December, Delta will expand service between its Atlanta and Salt Lake City hubs and key regional business destinations with new non-stop flights to 20 markets. In addition to previously announced service to destinations such as Bloomington and Moline, Ill., new non-stop routes from Atlanta will include Madison and Green Bay, Wis., Burlington, Vt., and Springfield, Mo. These new flights will be effective Dec. 1 and operated by Delta Connection carrier Atlantic Southeast Airlines.\n\nMeanwhile, from Salt Lake City, Delta and Delta Connection carrier Shuttle America will add non-stop service to another five destinations in addition to four destinations previously announced. The new destinations include Cleveland, Ohio and Memphis, Tenn. (effective Nov. 1); Nashville, Tenn. and Hartford, Conn. (effective Dec. 1) and new Saturday-only service to New York's LaGuardia Airport (effective Dec. 3).\n\nNew point-to-point choices in the Northeast\n\nAlso in December, Delta customers in the Northeastern United States will gain non-stop access between two of the region's most popular business destinations -- Boston and Baltimore -- with six daily round-trip flights operated by Delta Connection carrier Comair. The new flights, effective Dec. 1, add to the already-extensive non-stop service Delta offers between Boston and cities across the Northeast, including Delta's popular Shuttle service to New York-LaGuardia and non-stop service to 15 destinations operated by Delta Connection carriers Comair and Chautauqua, including the only non-stop service to Fredericton and Halifax, Canada.\n\nExpanded international service\n\nAs previously announced, Delta's winter schedule will add to customers' choices for travel around the globe with new or expanded service to 41 international destinations.\n\nIn Mexico, Delta will continue its expansion with new or expanded non-stop flights between Cozumel and Atlanta, Cozumel and Los Angeles, and Cozumel and Salt Lake City -- all effective March 5, 2006; and will expand service between Atlanta and Mexico City, and Atlanta and Cancun, beginning Dec. 1. With this expansion, Delta will offer customers 20 daily flights to seven destinations in Mexico. In addition, Delta has applied to the Department of Transportation for authority to operate service from Atlanta to Merida, from Orlando and Los Angeles to Cancun, and from New York-JFK to Cozumel, Cabo San Lucas, Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta, and from Cincinnati to Cabo San Lucas.\n\nDelta's ongoing international expansion adds to the dozens of new international routes introduced or announced since Jan. 1, 2005, including New York (JFK) to Chennai, India (via Paris); New York (JFK) to Berlin, Germany; Atlanta to Moscow; New York (JFK) and Atlanta to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Atlanta to Barbados; Salt Lake City to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and Atlanta to Dusseldorf, Germany. This growth supports Delta's overall network strategy to expand international service in response to increased customer demand and maintains Delta's position as the No.1 U.S. carrier across the Atlantic and as a leading carrier to Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nHey, what's with the new Comair 5 daily CRJ flights from BOS to BWI? AA Eagle and Airtran both already fly that route. I guess they need to use more gates at our Boston gateway... what a waste IMO. Who knows?\n\nBye Bye--General Lee"
