        "text": "TSA’s job is to make sure you are who you say you are. In the event you arrive at the airport without valid identification because it is lost or at home, you may still be allowed to fly (domestic travel only). The TSA officer may ask you to complete a form to include your name and current address and may ask additional questions to confirm your identity. If your identity is confirmed, you will be allowed to enter the screening checkpoint. You may be subject to additional screening. For more instructions and information about valid forms of identification, visit the TSA website.\n\nEscorts for unaccompanied minors may be arranged with your airline, fees may apply. If you wish to escort your minor child to the gate only, a gate pass may be issued by the airline. To obtain a gate pass, proceed to the airline ticket counter and explain to the ticket agent you are escorting your minor child to the gate. If granted, be prepared to have a valid ID and to comply with all security processes and restrictions.\n\nNote: gate passes cannot be authorized in advance and are issued at the discretion of the airline ticket agent.\n\nEvery airline and airport may have different rules, so it's always best to phone the airline first to obtain any special instructions. Visit our Airlines page for a list of the airline’s hours and phone numbers.\n\nFor Military: Gate passes are usually issued at the airline ticket/check-in counter. You will need the passenger’s name, flight number and a government issued photo ID. If you are escorting a departing military service member, they should have their military orders available as well as government photo IDs for everyone over the age of 18. If you require assistance, let an airline employee know that you wish to obtain a gate pass and explain the circumstances. Be sure to allow plenty of time before flight departure and/or arrival to account for check-in and security screening.\n\nWho will be considered for a gate pass?\n\n• A parent with a child flying alone – known as unaccompanied minor (under 18)\n\n• A companion for a passenger that has a disability (perhaps to push a wheelchair, etc.)\n\n• A companion for a passenger with special needs (can’t understand signs and/or instructions or perhaps needs a sign language interpreter)\n\n• A companion for a passenger who is elderly and may become confused or disoriented\n\n• Family members of military service personnel who are reporting for duty or arriving home from active duty\n\nNote: gate passes cannot be authorized in advance and are issued at the discretion of the airline ticket agent.\n\nTo sign up for TSA PreCheck, you must submit an online application and schedule an in-person appointment that includes a background check and fingerprinting at an enrollment center.
