I was going from LGA to ORD with 30min connection in PHL. Everyone boarded the LGA flight on time but there was delayed takeoff due airport traffic. And it was one of their tiny ass planes where any roller suitcase gets valet sticker at gate. We land late and the cranky lady takes her sweet time taking the suitcases off the rack. There was a passenger in a rush to avoid missing her connection and pleaded with the lady to let her get her case and the bitch wouldn't do it so the passenger shoves her aside and grabs her suitcase and rushes off. I see the attendant bypass my suitcase multiple times and politely try asking for it and the other passengers gently told me to just wait and I explain that my connection will be leaving soon and it's in another terminal. I eventually get my case and run to shuttle where there's a wait and then I get on what felt like the slowest moving vehicle in the world and then at the terminal I run to the gate and get their 7 minutes before gate closes completely out of breath and practically wheezing because I have asthma. The passenger from the previous flight is at the counter and she tells me they gave our seats away. I turn to the agent and say but you knew we were here because we checked in and boarded the first flight and it landed late but did arrive before this one was departing so why would you give away our seats. The agent says well next time don't book flights so close together. I was like excuse me?? I just put in my origin and my destination and then have to pick from the options offered by AA, why are you offering such short connections if it is not adequate time to connect!! Then she gives us our new flight which goes to BOS first so completely wrong direction and then we won't arrive in ORD until 6 hours after our original landing time and I miss all the events I had that day. When we tried to request a different option she sends us off without the slightest bit of sympathy to go look for customer service desk which of course was empty. I give up and head to my new gate where all the other passengers have already arrived and sat down and I try to ask the agent for proper boarding pass because what I was given had no seat listed and of course she gives me attitude and doesn't help. Then still out of breath from running with heavy backpack with underlying asthma I sat in one of the MULTIPLE empty handicap seats nearby because I was too exhausted to go any further hoping to finally rest and catch my breath but of course the bitch decided AA hasn't ruined my day enough and comes over and tells me to vacate the seat as it's for handicap, I move to another seat and course never ever does come occupy those seats. Seriously the entire flight had already arrived at sat down before me so I knew I wasn't stealing a seat from someone who needed it more and again there were multiple empty handicap seats right next to it.\n\nAnd if you think that's bad, let me tell you about the time AA kept us on plane on runway for hours then cancelled because I quote they were not permitting overtime for the pilots and then when I called to rebook the moron mistypes and books me for 12/26 instead of 2/26. I realize it the next day when checking flight status using flight number and it came up as that route not starting until a month later. I call again and yet another A.B.B. gives me attitude even though it's AA that screwed up and insists there's nothing available until evening. I go to the airport anyway and go to AA counter and tell a white guy what happened. He doesn't say a word just starts typing away then he hands me a ticket for a flight leaving within the hour. No earlier flights available my ass. Just have to get past the A.B.B. with their bullshit.\n\nNote to American (and all other) hiring managers: Angry black bitches who hate everyone and everything do NOT belong in customer service roles. I have not against black people in general but you all know exactly the type of person I'm talking about with their distinct tone if voice full of cold hearted attitude.\n\nA couple thoughts after reading this piece.\n\nWhile deplaning in ten minutes - then, taking zero minutes to walk and board your connecting flight fifteen minutes prior to boarding - and making a connecting flight departing 25-minutes later may smack of a need for a power to time travel, let’s view this through the prism of reality.\n\nThe airline knows you’re arriving where and when before you do. They know if any others are booked to your itinerary, and whether you have checked luggage that requires consideration.\n\nThe airline will most assuredly not give your seat away to a standby passenger in this scenario. They will more likely be paging you a final boarding call that you hear as you’re walking up to your connecting gate. So if your connecting flight is scheduled to depart at 1:00, the airline will have that door open for you up until 1:58, as you have your ticket scanned, saunter down the runway and through the airplane door at 12:59, and while you’re doing the passenger shuffle to take your seat, the forward cabin crew will be saying their “thanks a bunch see ya soons” to the ground crew as they shut and secure the planes door.\n\nIf you’re a family traveling together in this scenario, they may delay gate departure for 5-10 minutes so you have time to make your flight. The airline doesn’t want to pay you a family full of vouchers and potential hotel stays if they can avoid it.\n\nA good rule of thumb when booking a connecting flight:\n\n• check connecting times and be aware of your layover length before purchase.\n\n• take your overhead into consideration. This includes whether you’re alone or have others in tow. If you’re traveling with a five year old who MUST “go potty”, the most irrational and foolish gambit one take is to minimize that urgency and contend with the consequences on the next airplane. You’ll make no friends.\n\n• 25-minute layovers aren’t well suited for your checked luggage. This is a carry-on only proposition.\n\n• WILDCARD: if you’re traveling alone and are worried about your connection, try to book a seat in the front half of the plane. If you have the dreaded 33B chair, ask the gate agent if anything has “become available” closer to the door. You may end up with a bulkhead seat behind first/business class.\n\nWith a little thought and planning, a 25-minute l connection time will be easy and seamless as a brisk walk around the neighborhood.\n\nFirst off, I want to thank you for your efforts on this blog. I’ve read it for years, and I really should comment more as much as I travel. Keep up the excellent writing!\n\nRegarding this topic. It’s an interesting one. I fly a lot. For the 2022 year, I’m currently Diamond with Delta as well as Exec Plat with American. I can say I’ve had many 29 minute layovers at ATL with Delta and had zero issues. If I do miss a connection, every incursion, they see my status and assist in getting me where I need to go. In some cases, they rebook me and get me to my destination even quicker than my originally scheduled flight.\n\nAmerican (who I was forced to start flying with since Delta pulled out of my home airport (DAY) due to covid but has since returned. It’s so frustrating flying with them. Most of their hubs are so poorly designed, making a connection on time is a nightmare. If you miss your connection, I’ve been told twice that they cannot rebook you on a new flight that flies through a different hub than your scheduled flight. Likewise, they won’t even consider an adjacent airport to fly you into (like DAL vs. DFW, or EWR instead of JFK).\n\nThe percentage of Delta flights that have gotten to my first hip on time is easily over 90%. That percentage drops to maybe 50% on American. It’s not the 25min MCT that kills you on American. It’s their lack of actually getting you to your gate on time.\n\nI could rant all day long about American, but in the end, if I did not have status and flying for personal reasons, the cost is always the #1 factor. People don’t ever look at Connection times when they can save cash."
