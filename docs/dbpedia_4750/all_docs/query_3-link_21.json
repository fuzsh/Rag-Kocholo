        "text": "ATLANTA, May 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- In a month of almost constant Delta mainline operational performance records, the six regional carriers of Delta Connection added their own record: nearly eight days without a cancellation, their best-ever completion factor streak. The milestone beat out their previous record by almost three days.\n\nFor more than 17,000 operations, Compass Airlines, Endeavor Air, ExpressJet Airlines, GoJet Airlines, Shuttle America and SkyWest Airlines flew as scheduled, not canceling for any reason, including maintenance, weather, air traffic control or other circumstances both in and out of the carriers' control.\n\nThe streak ended only after a flight from D.C.'s Reagan National to New York's LaGuardia was canceled due to inclement weather Tuesday evening.\n\n\"The momentum has been incredible at our Delta Connection affiliates as they continue to break operational records, delivering to our customers a mainline-like experience,\" said Erik Snell, Vice President—Delta Connection. \"This latest cancel-free run is just the beginning as our regional partners continue to find opportunities to drive an even more consistently reliable operation.\"\n\nThe solid performance was matched by a Delta mainline completion factor streak—currently in its 16th day—bringing the combined mainline and Delta Connection cancel-free operation to 26 so-called Brand Perfect Days, already more than doubling last year's total of 11.\n\nIt's a record for Delta Connection and for the entire regional airline industry which has as of late been improving operationally—following closely behind Delta's own mainline record-setting on-time and completion factor performance.\n\nIn February, Delta Connection set a record of three days without a cancellation, flying more than 7,250 flights during a roughly 88-hour period. Cancellations across the board are down year-over-year with 2016 performance well-surpassing last year's.\n\nAbout Delta\n\nDelta Air Lines serves nearly 180 million customers each year. In 2016, Delta was named to Fortune's top 50 Most Admired Companies in addition to being named the most admired airline for the fifth time in six years.
