        "text": "Delta Offers Customers More Reasons to Choose New York-JFK as a Preferred Hub for International, Domestic Travel\n\nExpanded service to 17 destinations from JFK strengthens Delta?s position as New York?s leading airline\n\nNEW YORK, March 7, 2006 ? Delta Air Lines is offering customers more reasons to choose its hub at New York?s John F. Kennedy International Airport for international and domestic travel this summer with the addition of 46 new daily Delta and Delta Connection departures to 17 nonstop destinations. The new flights, to be introduced between June and September, will connect customers from destinations across the Northeast and on the West Coast to Delta?s growing offering of international, domestic and transcontinental service from New York-JFK, and will complement the airline?s leading presence on the other side of Queens at New York?s LaGuardia Airport.\n\nWith this expansion, Delta will offer JFK customers 139 peak day flights to 67 worldwide destinations by September ? more than any other airline in the market. New and expanded destinations include: Albany, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, N.Y.; Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; Norfolk and Richmond, Va.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Baltimore, Md.; Hartford, Conn.; Providence, R.I.; Washington, D.C (Reagan and Dulles); San Diego, Calif.; Las Vegas, Nev.; and Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\n\nIn Albany, Hartford, Philadelphia and Providence, Delta will be the only airline to offer daily nonstop flights to JFK.\n\n?Delta is New York?s leading airline and we are pleased to extend the reach of the superior schedules and service we offer at our New York-JFK hub to customers across the Northeast and on the West Coast,? said Jim Whitehurst, Delta?s chief operating officer. ?This summer?s expansion at JFK will significantly increase the convenience of choosing Delta for travel between the U.S. and destinations around the world thanks to Delta?s extensive offering of flights to 31 international destinations from JFK. Delta intends to remain the leader for our customers in New York with more combined flights and destinations from the city?s preferred airports at LaGuardia and JFK than any airline serving the market.?\n\nTo support this summer?s growth and further enhance the customer experience at JFK, Delta is investing more than $10 million in renovations to its Terminal 2 and 3 facilities. Refurbishments under way include replacing carpet, ceilings, paint, lighting and wall coverings in all public areas; refurbishing the Terminal 3 customs and immigrations entrance; refreshing facilities in Delta?s BusinessElite lounge and Crown Room Clubs; and restoring Terminal 2 facilities currently utilized by Song for Delta operations. Additionally, Delta is adding international functionality to its JFK check-in kiosks to give customers more choice and convenience and to expedite customer check-in. The full refurbishment is expected to be complete by late 2006.\n\n?Delta?s plan to upgrade JFK facilities will improve our customers? travel experience and make it more efficient and enjoyable to travel through one of the world?s premier international gateways,? Whitehurst said. ?Our customers should make no mistake that Delta is committed to New York and that this summer's expansion at JFK is an important step in offering enhanced service to customers in most every direction we serve from New York City.?\n\n\"This is great news for JFK and the millions of travelers who fly to and from New York every year,\" Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said. \"Delta has renewed its commitment to New York City, and with the new service, will ensure that JFK stays a leader in international travel for years to come. The key to growth is high quality and affordable air service for businesses and this major expansion shows that JFK is stronger than ever.?\n\n?Delta?s expansion of air service to cities in Upstate and Western New York is welcome news,? Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) said. ?It is important to have thriving air service into these regions as it will help the local economies grow and increase tourism throughout the state.?\n\nDelta?s expanded service in the Northeast will be operated by Delta Connection carriers Comair and Freedom Airlines, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, with a mix of 50-seat Bombardier regional jets and 37-seat DeHavilland Dash-8 turboprops.
