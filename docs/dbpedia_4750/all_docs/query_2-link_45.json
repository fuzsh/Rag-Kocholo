        "text": "The airfield and the commercial airline terminal are open and operational 24/7 but tenants, including the airlines, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints, retail shops, food and beverage outlets and rental car companies set their own hours determined by flight operations. Information about airline counter hours is here, TSA security is here, food and retail concessions is here and rental cars is here.\n\nCourtesy shuttles from both the Economy and Economy Covered lots on Corona Road operate 24/7 about every 15-20 minutes. In the Economy Lot the shuttle will often meet arriving vehicles where they park, otherwise passengers should go to one of the covered shuttle stops to be picked up. In Economy Covered, passengers should stand by their vehicle to be picked up or passengers can wait at a covered shuttle stop in the Economy Lot, just beyond the fence of the covered parking lot.\n\nNo, reservations are not required but for your convenience, peace-of-mind and to provide a touch-free experience, they can be made online. Reservations should be made at least a day in advance of arrival and there is an additional $2 fee. Information about parking facilities, including availability and links to make reservations can be found here.\n\nAs long as you like but if you’re planning to leave a vehicle longer than 30 days, please call Ace Parking at (520) 573-4710 to let them know unless you have made a reservation for the longer period of time.\n\nYes, passengers can be dropped off curbside for each airline. Stopping can only be permitted to drop off passengers. Vehicles cannot be left unattended. Curbside bag check has been suspended by most airlines so passengers must check bags at check-in counters inside the terminal. American Airlines has reinstated curbside bag check using a third-party vendor, Bags, Inc., which charges a $3 per bag convenience fee in addition to any airline baggage fees.\n\nTucson International Airport has A and B Gates and checkpoints, which are in reverse alphabetical order as you approach the terminal.\n\nB gates – American, Alaska and Delta\n\nA gates – Southwest, Sun Country and United\n\nSee the airlines page here for more.\n\nServices that can get you to Tucson International Airport include (click on each for more information):\n\nTaxis\n\nMobile app ride services Lyft and Uber\n\nReserved car and shuttle services\n\nSun Tran public transit\n\nAll of these services, except Sun Tran, drop off passengers curbside outside each airline. The Sun Tran stop is on the commercial roadway in front of baggage claim on the lower level in front of the main terminal.\n\nInclude the request for a wheelchair as part of your airline reservation. When you get to the airport, personnel at the departures curb can assist you. If wheelchair help is not readily available please inform a skycap or a Tucson Airport Authority traffic officer that you need a wheelchair.\n\nEach airline sets its own counter hours. Airlines with multiple flights each day open check-in counters about 2 hours before the first departure of the day and close about 15 minutes before the final flight of the day departs. Most airlines with less-than-daily service open check-in counters 2-3 hours before scheduled flight time and close 45 minutes before flight departure. Specific information for airlines at TUS is here.\n\nEach airline has its own recommendation, but a good guideline is to be at TUS at least 90 minutes before scheduled departure. Some airlines encourage passengers to check in 2 hours ahead of flight time and close check-in 45 minutes before departure. Allow more time if you have special circumstances and around holidays.\n\nYes, each airline sets its own policy regarding check-in times. The most common policies require baggage be checked at least 45 minutes ahead of scheduled departure and that passengers be at the gate 30 minutes before departure. Some airlines close their check-in counters 45-30 minutes before flight departure and require passengers to be checked in by the time the counter closes.\n\nEach airline has its own policy for traveling with your pet. Below are links to the policies for the airlines at TUS:\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nSouthwest Airlines\n\nSun Country Airlines\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) also has information on this page: Taking your human on a plane: what every pet needs to know\n\nA boarding time will often be noted on your boarding pass. Most airlines require passengers be ready for boarding 30 minutes prior to scheduled departure so the aircraft can be secured and pushed back on time from the gate. Reservations, even those where a boarding pass has been issued, are subject to cancellation if the passenger is not on board on time, which is usually 10 minutes ahead of departure time. This allows the airline to accommodate standby passengers and begin procedures for departure. Once an aircraft’s cabin door has been secured, agents cannot allow additional passengers to board without restarting the security process which would delay departure of the flight.\n\nAt Tucson International Airport the busiest times for departing flights are in the early morning hours before 8 a.m. and at mid-day. Because Tucson and Arizona do not observe Daylight Saving Time the mid-day busy hours shift. From early March to early November when DST is in effect in the U.S., the mid-day busy hours are 10:30 a.m.-2 p.m. From November to early March during Standard time it is an hour later from 11:30 a.m.- 3 p.m. Days of the week that tend to be busier are Sundays, Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, except around holidays.\n\nYes, lactation suites that are part of the Mamava network are available on the two concourses of the main terminal. For passengers departing from the A gates, the suite is near gate A3 and for passengers departing from the B gates it is at the mid-way point of the concourse near El Charro Café and across from the restrooms. To gain access to the suite, download the Mamava app here or call (520) 573-8182.\n\nAnimal relief areas pre-security are outdoors on both the east and west sides of the lower level from Baggage Claim of the main terminal. Use the exits near baggage carousels 1 and 7. Bags and a container for solid waste are provided. Post-security animal relief facilities are available on the A and B concourses just beyond the TSA checkpoints.\n\nCounter tops with electrical outlets suitable for laptops are located near the gates on the two concourses of the main terminal. Also, there are Business Centers located just beyond the TSA Checkpoints for the A and B concourses. These services are not available at the C gates.\n\nYes, there are two U.S. Postal Service mailboxes pre-security on the second level of the terminal. One is in the airline ticketing lobby area east of Southwest Airlines’ check-in counter and the other is on the west side of the terminal on the wall next to American Airlines’ counter.\n\nYes, the Military Lounge is open 24/7 and currently limited only to active-duty military personnel traveling through the airport. It is in baggage claim on the lower level, near carousel 5 (Southwest Airlines). More about the Military Lounge is here. It is not an affiliated United Service Organizations (USO) Center.\n\nThere is no currency exchange in the TUS terminal. If you are still planning your trip or if you have returned from a trip with foreign currency, your bank or credit union will usually offer the best exchange rates and lowest fees. If that is not an option, consider withdrawing foreign currency from an ATM at your destination, preferably one that is affiliated with your bank or credit union to pay the lowest transaction fees. Another option is to use a currency exchange at a connecting airport.\n\nDesignated smoking areas are outside the east and west entrances of the main terminal on both the ticketing and lower levels. In compliance with Arizona law, smoking or vaping, including use of any type of e-cigarette, is not permitted inside buildings at Tucson International Airport. Smokers must use outside designated smoking areas, staying at least 20 feet away from an entrance ensuring that tobacco smoke does not enter the building and that persons entering and leaving the building have a clear pathway where they are not subjected to breathing tobacco smoke. Although possession of limited amounts of marijuana is legal in Arizona, it is not legal to smoke it in public places.\n\nUp-to-the-minute information on flight arrivals and departures is on our Flight Status page here. If you are in the terminal, Flight Information Display monitors can be found in several locations, including two at the A and B Welcome Lounges which also display active flights on their way to/from TUS.\n\nA Cell Phone Waiting Lot is off Airport Drive, the last right turn as you approach the terminal area. Parking here is free as long as the driver remains with the vehicle. Please ask your arriving party to call you after they have collected their bags as federal security regulations prohibit TAA Traffic Officers from allowing vehicles to stop and wait in front of the terminal. Vehicles can only be permitted to stop for active loading of passengers.\n\nThis is something that should be confirmed at the point of origin by the party doing the shipping. Make sure they give you the arrival airline and flight number and provide you with the necessary paperwork or information to retrieve the animal. Each airline has its own procedure for retrieving live animals.\n\nAmerican and Delta deliver animals at their cargo offices. Information regarding airline cargo offices is here.\n\nUnited delivers animals at its contracted cargo facility: Air Support Inc., 5990 S. Country Club Road, Suite 180. Phone: 1-800-346-8169.\n\nSouthwest and Sun Country do not accept live animals not traveling with a passenger.\n\nAlaska Airlines does not accept live animals for shipping to/from Tucson.\n\nPlease be aware that no airline will ship live animals to or from Tucson during the summer.\n\nThe taxi stand is on the commercial roadway in front of the main terminal. Passengers arriving on airlines at the A and B gates should exit baggage claim on the lower level toward the main parking lots and cross the first roadway to the second island where taxis will be on your left. From the C gates, the most direct route is to cross the roadway in front of the terminal and go east toward the taxi stand. Information about taxis at Tucson International Airport is here.\n\nArriving passengers who have requested a ride through the Lyft or Uber app meet their driver and car on the commercial roadways in front of the main terminal. Passengers arriving on airlines at the A and B gates exit Baggage Claim on the lower level toward the main parking lots and cross the first roadway where your car and driver will arrive to your left. Cars and drivers do not wait at the pick-up location but will arrive when ordered through the mobile app.\n\nYes, two routes of Tucson’s public bus system Sun Tran make regular stops at the airport. The bus stop is located with other ground transportation services on the commercial roadway in front of the main terminal. Follow signs for ground transportation and exit baggage claim, then cross the first roadway where the Sun Tran stop is to your right.\n\nNot in the terminal. There are several shared-ride van services at TUS, but all require reservations and are met outside baggage claim on the third island across the roadways as you exit from baggage claim to Ground Transportation. Contact information for all car and shuttle services is here.\n\nIf you have just landed and haven’t made other arrangements, the quickest alternative is probably a taxi. They meet every scheduled arriving flight. The trip to campus should take about 25 minutes in normal traffic and cost between $25 and $35. You might also consider one of the app ride services if you have the Lyft or Uber app.\n\nThe most economical choice is Sun Tran. Both bus routes from the airport require a transfer and normal travel time to campus is about an hour. Regular cash fare is $1.75 paid as you board each bus for a total of $3.50 each way. If you intend to use Sun Tran often, you can save money by purchasing a SunGO card and having it mailed to you in advance of your trip (allow 10 days). The fare with a SunGo card each way between the airport and campus is $1.60. Learn more about SunGO here.\n\nIf you are still planning your trip, there are many reserved car and shuttle services that will meet your party if you have reservations.\n\nYes, the car rental companies at Tucson International Airport have cars that can be driven into Mexico provided certain conditions are met. The conditions vary among companies, but all require advance reservations by phone (preferably with the Tucson office), that the vehicle be returned to the United States and customers must purchase Mexico auto liability insurance from the car rental company. Phone numbers for car rental firms at Tucson International Airport are here.\n\nNot directly from the airport but taxis, Lyft and Uber can take passengers from TUS to two nearby bus terminals where there is frequent daily service into Mexico. Omnibus Mexicanos, a division of Transportes Pacifico (TAP), is about 7 miles (9 km) from the airport at 910 W. Irvington Road in the Placita Del Rio Center (520) 573-7033, and Tufesa, is about 5½ miles (7.3 km) away at 5550 S. 12th Ave. (520) 294-3780. Both companies offer Deluxe (De Lujo) or Executive (Ejecutivo) Class as well as First (Primera) Class buses. There are also shuttle companies but most only operate to the border so passengers going into Mexico will have to make other arrangements for their onward journey.\n\nNot a problem. Vehicles parked in TAA facilities are inventoried nightly by license plate. The Hourly, Daily or Economy lots have cashiers in the booths at the exit gates who can assist you based on the license plate number. In the Garage, customers can use the intercom at the EasyPay machine where in many cases the charges and a ticket to exit can be produced at the machine. Some cases may require an in-person visit by a supervisor. There is no penalty fee but customers are charged the full-day’s rate based on the number of nights (plus the day you are departing) the vehicle was inventoried.\n\nThe Tucson Airport Authority cannot sell airline tickets, so we are not able to answer the question. It is best to comparison shop multiple airlines (links to their websites are here). We also offer a booking service through FlyMyAirport which can be found here. You can view all available tickets offered to your destination from TUS and compare directly on this site. There is no single public website that can sell tickets for all of the airlines at Tucson International Airport. Variables that come into play are convenience (a nonstop flight can be more expensive than a connecting flight), planning (booking a ticket 6-8 weeks in advance, or earlier during peak travel times, will often net the best fares) and, if you can, check alternate dates. You might consider using a travel agent who can do the research. They usually charge a fee, but it includes customer service support.\n\nTucson International Airport is a designated Port of Entry for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). All aircraft crossing into the United States over the Tucson sector are required to stop at the TUS federal inspection facilities unless confirmed arrangements have been made to do so at another airport. In 2021, CBP at TUS processed 15,942 international passengers arriving on 3,258 aircraft arrivals and almost $2.2 billion worth of exports and imports.\n\nThe Tucson International Airport supports the safe operation of drones for recreational use and commercial purposes. There are many areas around the airport that are not safe to fly drones due to piloted aircraft operating at low altitudes. For information on the operation of drones near the airport please visit the Drone Information page here.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s not the airport’s call. Back in the 1930s when government officials adapted the old Weather Bureau’s two-letter codes for cities to three-letter codes to have more combinations, someone took the TU for Tucson and tacked on an “S”. The code is now part of the global system for identifying airports and there’s not a lot that can be done about it, especially since both TUC and TIA are assigned to other airports. If you are coming to Tucson, please make sure your baggage is checked to TUS. If it says TUC it’s going to San Miguel de Tucumán in Argentina. If it says TIA, it’s going to Tirana International Airport in Albania.\n\nIf you are in the terminal, please look for a TUS Warm Welcome Volunteer wearing a blue vest with the logo pictured here. They can be found throughout the airport terminal. Or call (520) 573-8100 from a courtesy or mobile phone. If your question is for a future visit, please ask it here."
