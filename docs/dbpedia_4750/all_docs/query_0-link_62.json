        "text": "Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport (PVD) was pleased to celebrate the first flight to New York/LaGuardia Airport (LGA) on Tuesday, January 5, 2022 when Delta Air Lines began providing flights to New York City three times a day (2x on Saturdays and Sundays). The new service to a major airline hub will provide travelers with more connecting options to more locations, improving the ease of travel between New England, New York City and the nation. Flights will be operated on a 76-seat CRJ-900 aircraft.\n\nFlight times and fares from PVD to New York/LaGuardia are available at: https://www.pvdairport.com/flights/book-now. This new route brings the Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport’s (PVD) nonstop route count to 26, marking a 53% increase in nonstop routes along with a 57% increase in the number of airlines serving PVD since 2016. More information about routes and airlines at PVD can be found at https://www.pvdairport.com/flights/airlines.\n\nBeginning on January 10, 2022, Delta Air Lines will also upgrade two of its three daily Detroit (DTW) flights to a larger aircraft: from 76-seat CRJ-900 aircraft to 110-seat Boeing 717 aircraft, providing 68 more seats per day between Rhode Island and Detroit.\n\nDelta Air Lines also provides daily service to Atlanta, and recently announced that they will resume their popular route to Minneapolis/St. Paul in late spring. Starting June 7, 2022 a 157-seat Airbus A-320 will provide daily service between PVD and MSP, linking Rhode Island with Delta’s third largest hub, providing numerous connections to the extensive Delta network in the western United States."
