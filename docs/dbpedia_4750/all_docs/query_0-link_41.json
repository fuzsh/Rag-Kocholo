        "text": "Delta’s footprint at Salt Lake City International Airport continues to grow with the opening of 13 new gates on Concourse A, finishing off the gleaming 900,000-square-foot facility that first welcomed customers in September 2020. All flights operating from Concourse A will now board and deplane via jet bridges, eliminating bus operations to remote hardstands.\n\n“The completion of Concourse A comes just ahead of what we anticipate will be a busy holiday and ski travel season,” said Adam Ryan, Managing Director of Delta’s SLC Operations. “It’s a privilege for the 5,400 Delta employees here in Salt Lake City to share this state-of-the-art facility with our customers as we continue to provide them with the elevated experience they have come to expect from Delta.”\n\nIn partnership with the Salt Lake City Department of Airports, the finished eastern portion of Concourse A features 22 gates – nine of which opened earlier this summer – bringing the airlines’ gate total to 50 at SLC. This expansion also includes a new Delta Need Help Center for customers looking for travel assistance, as well as 19 new restaurants and shops for customers to enjoy.\n\n“These new gates and amenities will further elevate the guest experience at the Salt Lake City International Airport for Salt Lakers and visitors from all over the world,” said Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall. “Salt Lake City is proud to be a Delta hub in the West and home to one of the top performing airports in the world. The completion of this expansion will provide efficient services and modern facilities for travelers who are eager for a seamless journey.”\n\nDelta operates more flights out of SLC than any other airline combined, serving close to 30,000 customers daily with 237 peak-day flights to 88 destinations in Fall 2023. The airline has invested more than $12 billion in airport projects coast-to-coast in the last 10 years, doubling down on its vision for the future of travel by building airports that are comfortable, easy to navigate and part of an effortlessly connected journey.\n\nEarlier this year, Delta further cemented its position as the leading global carrier in SLC with a new lease agreement with Salt Lake City that increases Delta’s gate count from 55 to 66, with an anticipated completion in 2027. In June, Delta also broke ground in Salt Lake City on a new pilot training facility, marking the first training facility investment outside of its Atlanta headquarters since 1968."
