        "text": "Paris-Charles de Gaulle is a major connection hub and one of the busiest airports in Europe.\n\nFor a hassle-free experience give yourself enough time between flights while booking your ticket…\n\nThink about a possible delay of your incoming flight, queues in front of security or passport control at peak times, distance to the departure gate.\n\nMinimum connecting time recommended by EASY CDG*\n\n■ 60 minutes for connections within the same terminal.\n\n■ 90 minutes for connections that require travel between terminals.\n\n* Only apply if travelling on a single ticket and any baggage checked through to your final destination.\n\nFamilies travelling with small children and travelers with health or mobility concerns may need a longer connection time.\n\nPassengers will be advised at the airport of origin regarding where they should collect their luggage.\n\n■ In most cases, connections are booked as a single journey (e.g. Air France/Air France or Delta/Air France)\n\nYour baggage will be automatically sent to your connecting flight at CDG Airport, you should be able to remain airside to travel to the departure terminal.\n\n■ If you are travelling without an official flight connection (you bought two separate tickets for your flights and need to re-check at CDG)\n\nYou may need to travel between terminals outside of the transit zone.\n\nIn that case, you should allow plenty of extra time to exit, collect your baggage from the carousel, re-check in with your airline and clear security.\n\nPlease ensure that you comply with entry & visa requirement.\n\nParis-CDG airport is open and welcome all transit passengers (including non-europeans).\n\nYou must get tested before traveling if a PCR test is required by your final destination.\n\nPassengers transiting through Paris to travel to a third country are not required to present a COVID‑19 PCR test certificate at CDG airport.\n\nPassengers are denied boarding if they are prohibited from entering the country of destination.\n\nIf you change to a connecting flight to France or a Schengen country, you will be subject to French entry policy.\n\nConsult the France Diplomatie information website.\n\nConsult the reopen.europa site for your intra-EU trips.\n\nCharles de Gaulle airport is about 26 km (16 miles) from Central Paris, It does take about 45-60 minutes to reach the city center, so we only recommend leaving the airport for the city if you’ve got at least 6-7 hours between flights.\n\nYou can store your luggage nearby the railway station and then take the RER B train to Paris.\n\nA few bus routes and taxis are available, too, but traffic can really slow you down.\n\nRemember to keep 2 hours minimum for the transportation airport to Paris and back.\n\nTherefore, a 5-hour layover in Paris, for example, will mean 3 hours available to visit Paris.\n\nPlease ensure that you comply with entry & visa requirements.\n\nVisit our dedicated page for information and details about trains, buses, taxis and shuttles to Paris.\n\nYour connection time depends on your route, airline and whether you need to pick up baggage or change terminals, so there’s no single answer.\n\nIf you book a through-ticket with an airline or travel agent, your airline will generally quote a ″minimum connection time″.\n\nHowever, if you booked your flights separately, these minimum connection times don’t apply, you should allow plenty of extra time to clear baggage reclaim and passport control, transfer between terminals, then check in and clear security for your outbound flight.\n\nPassengers will be advised at the airport of origin regarding where they should collect their luggage.\n\nIn most cases, your baggage will be labeled to go directly to your final destination.\n\nThe baggage tag receipt always states your bag’s final destination.\n\nIn the event that your baggage is not through-checked you must follow signs for Arrivals, reclaim baggage, then check your bags in the departure terminal.\n\nPlease ensure that you comply with entry & visa requirements.\n\nIf you need to check-in baggage, you should leave the transfer zone (there are no check-in counters in the transfer zone) and proceed to the departure terminal of your connecting flight.\n\nIf you need a boarding pass for your connecting flight, you can use a self service kiosk (available for Air France customers in the transfer zone of terminals 2E & 2F) or proceed to the check-in desks for your airline in the departure terminal (please ensure that you comply with entry & visa requirements)."
