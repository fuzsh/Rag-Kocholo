A man passes an automated security gate at the front of a hall that leads to a bright lobby with a stairwell and reception desk. A lounge around the corner with long couches lining a wall. A long table with stools and kitchenette. A couple works at the end of the table. A pair of girls sit in high-backed seats across the way. Booths with tables and chairs. A man and women sit at one. Down the hall a classroom with rows of desks with ergonomic chairs. People work on electronic devices. Another hall with stairs up to an indoor jet. Entering the cabin and passing seats to the back. Sliding down an emergency escape. A separate room with a flight simulator with multiple monitors. A balloon shaped capsule with Republic Airways written on the side, elevated off the floor on a rig. A man adjusts controls. Two people in a simulator adjust controls on multiple panels. The co-pilot pushes forward on a yoke. A glass exterior with an awning out front. Inside an open lounge space with tables and chairs. A woman rolls luggage behind her as she approaches a desk. She checks in to a room with a key card and smiles as she lands on a sofa. A multi-building complex with construction work going on outside. A walkway down the middle leads to a courtyard with patio lounge chairs. Inside another hallway leads to a game room with scuffle board, pool table, and more. A laundromat. Ping pong, Fooseball tables. Flying back past the tables in the lounge and around the corner to a snack shop inside. One woman gives a customer a cup as another at a cash register smiles and waves. Another hall filled with tables and chairs. A kitchen and buffet island at the far end. A key card pays at a reader. A man opens a glass door and takes out a snack. A group laughs around a table as they eat together. Zipping down a stone walkway outside the building, under glass bridge. A giant outdoor screen with Adirondak chairs with the text, Republic Airways.\n\n(SPEECH)\n\n(SINGING) Come on.\n\n[VOCALIZING]"
