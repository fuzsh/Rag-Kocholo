        "text": "Post-pandemic traffic growth at key Northeast airports has been explosive, and Delta Air Lines’ Charlotte operations have benefited.\n\nOn Nov. 8, Delta will add flights to Charlotte from LaGuardia and Kennedy airports. On Oct. 4, it added flights to Charlotte from Boston Logan.\n\nDelta has long been the No. 2 carrier at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, with a single-digit market share compared to American’s 91%, so its growth is more an irritant than a threat. This month American has 666 daily peak departures from Charlotte.\n\nStill, Delta’s most recent upgrades in service to Boston and New York mean the carrier offers sufficient frequencies to attract business travelers, who can be sensitive to schedules, even though Delta is flying regional jets on the routes while American generally flies mainline jets.\n\nDelta said last week that by November it will boost New York departures by about 100. That will mean that Delta will operate more than 400 daily departures combined from LaGuardia and JFK.\n\nIn Boston, Delta has boosted its schedule so that this month, it became Boston’s largest carrier by departures, surpassing JetBlue. Delta will have 3,140 October departures, compared with 3,074 for JetBlue, according to Cirium.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Delta added three daily Boston-CLT flights, using E175 aircraft. The market already had nine daily American departures and two on JetBlue. (Despite the Northeast Alliance codeshare agreement, American and Jet Blue do not code share on this route, where they compete.)\n\nFor New York-Charlotte service, next month Delta will increase daily La Guardia-CLT departures to seven from five while increasing daily Kennedy-CLT departures to five from three. All of the aircraft are regional jets, including CRJ 900s and Embraer 175, flown by Republic Airways.\n\nDelta’s relative strength at Charlotte results largely from the proximity of its Atlanta hub, which is just 225 air miles away. Eight Boeing flights depart daily for Atlanta, and Delta has gradually added service to its other hubs. Besides Atlanta, it now serves Boston, Detroit, LaGuardia, Kennedy, Minneapolis and Salt Lake City.\n\nAirport statistics show just how rapidly Northeast service has rebounded this summer.\n\nAt JFK in July, the number of passengers was 3.6 million, up 465% from July 2020, according to the New York Pork Authority. At LaGuardia, in July, the passenger count was 1.7 million, up 371%. At Newark, the passenger count was 3 million, up 308%. At Charlotte, where American kept operations high throughout the pandemic, the July count was 2.2 million, up 121%.\n\nAt fast-reporting Boston Logan, the number of passengers in September was also 2.2 million, up 252% from September 2020.\n\nOne more sign of expanded service at the Northeast airports came Tuesday, when United announced that starting Oct. 31, it will launch nearly hourly shuttle service between Newark and Washington National and will add five new flights between LaGuardia and Dulles. All told, United will operate 32 daily flights between the New York airports and the Washington airports.\n\nAviation consultant Bob Mann said Delta and United are boosting flights in order to protect hubs from competitors, who could also boost flights, leading to congestion.\n\nLast month, the Federal Aviation Administration extended through March 26, 2022, its waiver of use-it-or-lose-it international slots at congested airports JFK, LGA and DCA. But domestic slots are not protected, Mann said, noting, “This explains why DCA among others have seen big flight increases and have been driven into congestion.”\n\nMann said the New York airports benefit “from a welcome return of the markets.” He said Delta’s expansion enables the carrier to serve most top New York markets, which “probably is going to include somebody else’s hubs” — including Charlotte."
