        "text": "Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR) is located in Burbank, California, approximately 12 miles north of Downtown Los Angeles. BUR is the closest L.A.-area airport to the majority of L.A.’s most popular tourist destinations, as well as attractions in nearby Glendale and Pasadena.\n\nBUR is served by eight commercial airlines: Alaska, American, Avelo, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, and United. You can learn more about our airlines and their nonstop destinations by visiting our Air Service page. BUR also has two on-site fixed-base operators (FBOs), Million Air Burbank, and Atlantic Aviation.\n\nBUR has two terminals, A and B, from which all commercial airlines operate. Both terminals have a combined number of 14 gates, with nine gates in Terminal A and five gates in Terminal B. Each terminal has its own security screening checkpoint.\n\nBUR is famous for its ease and convenience, particularly for the quick-moving lines at its security checkpoints! However, we recommend that you arrive at the Airport at least an hour before your flight is scheduled to depart. During peak holiday travel times, the airlines recommend that you arrive at least two hours before your scheduled departure.\n\nBUR offers a variety of on-site services and amenities for passengers, including complimentary services for passengers with disabilities. For a complete list of services and amenities, please visit the Passenger Services section of our website.\n\nIf you wish to pick up or drop off at the terminal, remember that no waiting is allowed at the curb. If the party you’re picking up isn’t already at the curb, you can park in the Airport’s Short Term Parking Structure to wait for your party.\n\nYou can wait for passengers in the Terminal A and Terminal B Baggage Claim areas. Please park your vehicle in the Short Term Parking Structure, where posted parking rates apply.\n\nThe Airport is served by ten on-site rental car companies, all located in the Regional Intermodal Transportation Center (RITC). For more information about the rental car companies and their location, including RITC accessibility, please visit our Rental Cars page.\n\nBurbankBus and Metro Bus provide service on the ground level of the Regional Intermodal Transportation Center (RITC). Amtrak and Metrolink both stop at the Hollywood Burbank Airport Train Station, located on Empire Avenue across from the Airport, and Metrolink also stops at the Burbank Airport-North Station, located on San Fernando Road and Hollywood Way. Local hotels also provide complimentary shuttle service from the shuttle island in front of the terminal. For more information on Airport public transit, visit our Buses and Trains page. For more information on taxi and shuttle service, please visit our Shuttles and Taxis page.\n\nThe Burbank Hospitality Association offers a complete guide to hotels, restaurants, and attractions in Burbank. The City of Glendale, the Pasadena Convention and Visitors Bureau, and Discover Los Angeles do the same for their respective cities.
