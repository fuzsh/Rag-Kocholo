        "text": "Delta flyers passing through LAX this week can breathe a little easier about making their connection.\n\nThe airline is using a Porsche 911 GT3 RS as a shuttle to get passengers in danger of missing their connecting flight to their plane on time, according to Road & Track. The ferocious track beast will be used to drive “lucky” passengers directly to their plane for the next leg of their journey.\n\nAnyone who’s ever had a layover is familiar with this feeling: You’re running late because of some delay at your first airport and stressed you won’t make your next flight. And even when you’ve finally made it to the connecting destination, you’re still faced with the prospect of having to sprint with your carry-on items through the crowded terminal to make it to the next plane.\n\nFrom now until Monday, February 26, you won’t have to worry about any of that if you’re flying Delta into LAX. The airline has announced that a select number of “unsuspecting” passengers who are cutting it close will be driven directly from their connecting flight in a 911 GT3 RS. The limited-time program won’t just be for VIP flyers, either.\n\nAs far as airport shuttles go, the 911 GT3 RS is an unorthodox choice. That’s because the track-only car only has two seats, one of which will be filled by a trained driver. It may not be the most sensible choice, but it’s hard to think of a more fun way to get from one plane to another. As one of the top-performing 911s, the car comes packed with a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six that pumps out 518 hp, 342 ft lbs of torque, and redlines at 9,000 rpm. Thanks to all that oomph and a ridiculous aero package that includes a giant rear wing, the car can rocket from zero to 60 mph in just three seconds and hit a top speed of 184 mph. In other words, you won’t have to worry about missing your flight in this thing.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Delta and Porsche have teamed up to get travelers to their connecting flights on time. The airline, which have a long-running partnership with the marque, regularly use Cayennes and Panameras for the same purpose at select airports across the country, according to the Drive. Last summer, they also employed a 918 supercar to shuttle elite customers around Atlanta’s Hartsfield Airport."
