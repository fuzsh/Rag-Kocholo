Passengers should take an escalator or elevator to the second floor (departures) to check in at the ticket counters. Visit the Maps page for more information.\n\nIs there a shuttle between airport terminals?\n\nTo travel between terminals, select the daily parking shuttle which leaves every 10 minutes from the ground transportation curbs outside Terminal A and Terminal B.
