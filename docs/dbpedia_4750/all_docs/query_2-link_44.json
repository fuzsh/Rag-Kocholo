        "text": "My original flight 3/9 was canceled from JAX to RIC via LGA and Delta rescheduled me on another flight via JFK. Then my departure from JAX to JFK was delayed so much so that my arrival into RIC was being further pushed back. I was given the option to change my flight at no cost which I opted to do but I was not able to see what seats were available. I thought at some point I would be given the option to see available seats prior to finalizing the change but that never occurred. After accepting the change I found I didnât have a seat assignment on the departure and I was assigned a middle seat (which I despise) on the connection. A passenger should be given the option to see what seats are available before making a change. I can assure you had I known prior to accepting the change that I would have to wait to be assigned a seat at the airport and that I would only have a middle seat on the connection I would not have changed from the rescheduled flight. Then to add insult to injury I used points to sit in Delta comfort from JAX to LGA because of the length of the flight. I no longer want to use points on either leg of the flights via ATL and I sincerely hope my points will be deposited back into my account. I had aisle seats (which I prefer) on both my original flights and Iâm very disappointed I donât have them on either flight tomorrow. I apologize for such a lengthy message; I didnât expect to have to deal with flight changes that would disrupt my trip.\n\nAfter several lights changes since the time I originally booked, my international layover went from 1 hour and 45 minutes to only 40 minutes. A 45 minute layover for an international connection is not enough time, especially as I am flying with a family of five, this forced asked to switch flights. In doing so, I lost the upgraded seats I initially used points for. This would not have been a big deal, but it is highly disappointing that delta would not reimburse you for the points lost due to a change on their end. This policy really needs changed.\n\nIn addition, the four hour plus waiting to talk to a representative force me to try to utilize the chat function. Even though I know I was able to speak to somebody relatively quickly, I made it all the way to having new flights but the person I was talking to left the chat. Waited a while and then the screen turned out causing me to start over. OK I thought, disappointing but just a fluke, but what do you know it happened again. The second time, I am mediately typed ârepresentativeâ and then we can immediately going through the process with a third agent. At least this time all the previous chat information was still up for her to review instead of starting back from scratch. The system need some bugs worked out, itâs also very hard to read on an iPhone.\n\nOur flight was cancelled in advance but we were not notified. The App showed it âOn-timeâ at several check ins on our trip from home to the airport. We left home at 12:40 and checked the flight status on the drive to parking, on the shuttle to the terminal, in the security line and after we got through security. At every instance the app was properly refreshed and re-loaded and we were told the flight was on time. It turns out the flight was cancelled at 12:47 shortly after we left home. Delta sent an email but did not send any in-app or text notifications. Their app also failed to show the cancellation at every stage. Itâs sad that Delta is considered a good airline because it would be so simple to have their app display correct information. No compensation was offered and our flight was rebooked to today, which also got cancelled at the gate. Delta has so courtesy rebooked us on a one way flight to New York. Too bad our flight was to Tampa. Customer Service has been on hold for 3 hours. It started at 82 minutes and 3 hours later the hole is still 80 minutes. I wish I had some good feedback and know this happens to many others but a simple notification could have saved a lot of frustration. Fingers crossed we can go on our vacation and salvage the rest of the week after 2 days lost."
