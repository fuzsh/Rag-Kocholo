        "text": "United Airlines joined Delta Air Lines Inc. in banning big-game trophies as freight after the killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe triggered mounting global outrage.\n\nWe felt it made sense to do so, Charles Hobart, a United spokesman, said Monday in disclosing the carriers decision to prohibit transportation of elephants, rhinoceroses, leopards and water buffalo as well as lions. Hours earlier, Delta announced its new policy covering the same five animals.\n\nThe carriers spotlighted the mundane logistics that follow a visiting hunters bagging of African wildlife: getting the head, horns or hide back home. Airlines already faced animal-rights groups pressure to reject such cargo even before last months killing of Cecil, 13, a star attraction for tourists at Zimbabwes Hwange National Park.\n\nNeither United nor Delta referred to Cecil, who allegedly was lured out of the Hwange park. Zimbabwe wildlife authorities suspended hunting of lions, leopards and elephants in some areas near the park this weekend amid conflicting reports on whether poachers had killed another lion, possibly Cecils brother.\n\nPrior to this ban, Deltas strict acceptance policy called for absolute compliance with all government regulations regarding protected species, the Atlanta-based airline said. Delta will also review acceptance policies of other hunting trophies with appropriate government agencies and other organizations supporting legal shipments.\n\nAfrica Routes\n\nMorgan Durrant, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Delta, declined to comment beyond the statement, and Uniteds Hobart had no comment beyond confirming the new policy.\n\nDelta is the biggest U.S. carrier to Africa, while United, a unit of United Continental Holdings Inc., serves only one destination on the continent -- Lagos, Nigeria. American Airlines Group Inc., which doesnt fly to Africa, had no immediate comment regarding its trophies-as-freight stance.\n\nIn Asia, Singapore Airlines Ltd. and South Koreas Asiana Airlines Inc., also have banned such cargo on their planes, the carriers said in e-mailed statements. Singapore Airlines said its ban has been in place since May.\n\nSouth African Airways moved in April to halt the carriage of legally acquired hunting trophies of lions, elephants, rhinoceros and tigers, then ended its embargo in July once it concluded that it had safeguards to stop illegal shipments, the countrys Department of Environmental Affairs said.\n\nNot everything that gets shot is Cecil, said Barry Parsons, chief strategy officer for South African Airways.\n\nBig-game hunting is legal. Its a legitimate export industry and its a supportive industry for game lodges and the hunting industry, Parsons said Tuesday at a conference in Sydney. Its not my bag but its a big thing in South Africa.\n\nWeeks after South African Airways initial action, Emirates airline agreed in May to stop carrying any wildlife trophies, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. A message left for comment with the airlines U.S. offices wasnt immediately returned.\n\nNo airline should provide a get-away vehicle for the theft of Africas wildlife, Wayne Pacelle, chief executive officer of the Humane Society of the U.S., said in a statement.\n\nZimbabwe has requested the extradition of Walter Palmer, the Minnesota dentist who shot Cecil. Professional hunter Theo Bronkhorst, who assisted in stalking the animal, has appeared in court in the country.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said its investigating the incident. Animal-rights groups have called for a ban on trophy hunting, and Palmer has received death threats through social media and has closed his dental practice, at least temporarily. Palmer told the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper in a statement that he thought the hunt was legal.\n\nACCRA, March 5, 2014  Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) has revised the schedules for its flights between Accras Kotoka International Airport and New Yorks John F. Kennedy International Airport to offer customers improved flight connections to destinations across the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. The revised schedules will increase the number of same-day onward flight connections available to customers flying from Accra to New York-JFK from March 29.\n\nCustomers travelling on from New York to other destinations in the U.S. will have improved access to the popular cities of Washington, Baltimore and Atlanta. Plus, the re-timed schedule also ensures an ideal connecting time at New York- JFK as requested by our passengers\n\nEight years on from our inaugural service, Ghana continues to be an important market for Delta, and were proud to celebrate Ghanas Independence Day this weekend, said Bobby Bryan, Deltas commercial manager for West and East Africa. This new schedule is great news for our customers as it will mean increased travel options for destinations in the United States and beyond.\n\nDelta will be the only carrier to operate service from Accra during daylight hours, providing additional choice when travelling to the United States. The schedule also allows for more options for cargo forwarders and handlers when shipping Ghanaian goods to the United States.\n\nDeltas Accra  New York-JFK flights will operate as follows:\n\nFrom March 29, 2015, the flight will operate four times per week using a 225 seat Boeing 767-300ER aircraft. Passengers in Delta One, formerly known as BusinessElite, will continue to enjoy 180-degree fully flat-bed seats in a 1x2x1 configuration, allowing each customer direct aisle access and enhanced privacy. Delta also offers a Premium economy product, Delta Comfort +, with seats that feature up to 10cm of legroom and 50 percent more recline than Deltas standard international Economy class seats, plus priority boarding. In addition Delta has invested in its main cabin economy class with seats that provide additional legroom, adjustable headrests and, personal in-seat entertainment screens with over 350 films as well as USB power at each seat. Passengers will also enjoy an improved menu, sleep kit and a bottle of water.\n\nDelta has operated service to Ghana since December 2006 and now operates service to four African cities in four countries. Delta has grown from 22 weekly departures to and from Africa in December 2006 to more than 42 planned for summer 2015. Through the hubs in Atlanta and New York-JFK, Delta offers an unsurpassed network of hundreds of convenient onward connections.\n\nDelta services between Ghana and the United States are available for booking via travel agents and Deltas dedicated reservations teams in Accra, telephone number 030-221-3111.\n\nATLANTA and LONDON - Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. today detailed a codeshare agreement across 108 routes* that offers customers seamless connections to 66 destinations across North America and the U.K.\n\nToday's codeshare announcement coincides with Delta acquiring a 49 per cent stake in Sir Richard Branson's airline - marking the next step towards a full joint venture between the two carriers. Virgin Atlantic will place its code on 91 Delta routes, including both trans-Atlantic and domestic U.S. routes. Delta will place its code on 17 Virgin Atlantic routes, including the recently launched Little Red domestic U.K. services connecting London to Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.\n\nThe agreement includes the following customer benefits:\n\nVirgin Atlantic customers will now enjoy a vast network of connecting North American destinations while Delta customers will gain an additional six daily frequencies between London to New York SkyMiles and Flying Club loyalty programs that will offer up to 125% tier bonus miles* to frequent fliers on all Delta and Virgin Atlantic flights - not just those within the codeshare agreement Reciprocal Delta Sky Club and Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse access at applicable airports for Upper Class and BusinessElite passengers and Flying Club Gold members and SkyMiles Platinum and Diamond members\n\nPriority check-in, boarding, baggage handling and additional baggage allowance on all Virgin Atlantic and Delta operated flights worldwide - not just those within the codeshare agreement - for Virgin Atlantic Upper Class and Flying Club Gold members as well as Delta BusinessElite and SkyMiles Gold, Platinum and Diamond members \"This is a strategic investment that enhances Delta's network with greatly improved access to London Heathrow, the leading marketplace on the trans-Atlantic,\" said Ed Bastian, Delta's president. \"As we unite two leading global airline brands in an innovative partnership that focuses on delivering enhanced benefits and services for our customers, we also become a more formidable competitor across the Atlantic.\"\n\nCraig Kreeger, Virgin Atlantic CEO said; \"Today is an important day for Virgin Atlantic and our customers in both the U.S. and U.K. As new shareholders in the airline, Delta is an important ally in the all-important trans-Atlantic market. We can stand firm together against the competition and can now offer more destinations, a smoother connecting airport experience and ultimately the best trans-Atlantic on board experience. Virgin Atlantic's award-winning customer experience is loved around the world and we look forward to sharing our unique Clubhouse and in-flight hospitality with many Delta passengers over the years.\"\n\nThe two airlines announced their intention to enter into a joint venture agreement in December 2012. Last week unconditional merger clearance was granted by the European Commission and the U.S Department of Justice closed their review of the transaction. As of today, Delta has successfully completed its acquisition of a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic. The U.S Department of Transportation is currently reviewing the parties' application for antitrust immunity relating to the proposed joint venture of the parties' operations on nonstop routes between the US and the UK. This review is expected to be completed during third quarter of 2013, and the implementation of the Delta/Virgin Atlantic joint venture is anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2014. Once implemented, this will deliver further significant additional consumer benefits and vibrant competition to the trans-Atlantic market."
