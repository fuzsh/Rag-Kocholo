Over the last decade significant changes have occurred in the airline industry. Many legacy carriers are facing challenging financial conditions and low cost carriers are attracting passengers away from some small community airports. These changes, and others, have challenged small communities to attract adequate commercial air service. To help small communities improve air service, Congress established the Small Community Air Service Development Program in 2000. This study reports on (1) how the Department of Transportation (DOT) has implemented the program; and (2) what goals and strategies have been used and what results have been obtained by the grants provided under the program. -------------------------Indexing Terms------------------------- REPORTNUM: GAO-06-21 ACCNO: A42258 TITLE: Commercial Aviation: Initial Small Community Air Service Development Projects Have Achieved Mixed Results DATE: 11/30/2005 SUBJECT: Airlines Airports Commercial aviation Evaluation criteria Grant administration Grants Performance measures Program evaluation Program management Strategic planning Transportation industry Program implementation DOT Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program ****************************************************************** ** This file contains an ASCII representation of the text of a ** ** GAO Product. ** ** ** ** No attempt has been made to display graphic images, although ** ** figure captions are reproduced.

Today many of the legacy carriers are facing challenging financial conditions.1 Competition from low-cost carriers has contributed to passengers driving long distances to obtain low fares rather than use their small community airport. Since 2000, there has been a decrease in the use of small turboprop aircraft that serve small community airports, with many operators opting for larger regional jets holding 50 or more passengers. These changes, and others, have challenged small communities to attract adequate commercial air service at reasonable prices. By establishing the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program in 2000, Congress created a new source of funds to help small, underserved airports improve their air service. The Congress has appropriated $20 million annually since 2002 for the Department of Transportation (DOT) to award up to 40 grants each year to communities that have demonstrated insufficient air carrier service or unreasonably high air fares. We reviewed (1) DOT's implementation of the Small Community Air Service Development Program and (2) the strategies communities receiving grants have used and the results obtained by the grants provided under the program. In addition, this report provides information on factors affecting air service to small communities, which is included in appendix II. To determine how DOT has implemented the Small Community Air Service Development Program, we reviewed legislation authorizing and funding the program as well as related orders and guidelines. We interviewed DOT officials about their grant selection process and criteria. We reviewed grant award information and examined how DOT used its grant criteria to select grantees. We also reviewed program controls, receipts, quarterly reports, and the final reports that grantees submitted. We obtained and reviewed budget and finance data from DOT's Office of the Secretary as well as reimbursement data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which reimburses the grantees. To determine what strategies have been used and what results have been obtained, we reviewed the grant applications and agreements for all 157 grants awarded through September 1, 2005. In addition, we reviewed the grants awarded, classified the types of strategies carried out within the grants, and summarized the types of activities funded. We also visited each of the 10 grantees that had completed their grants by December 31, 2004, and interviewed airlines and aviation consultants associated with these completed grants. We also contacted 13 additional grantees who completed their projects between January 1 and September 30, 2005. Further, we conducted two Web-based surveys. We used self-administered electronic questionnaires posted to the World Wide Web to survey the 146 airport directors involved in the 122 grants DOT awarded from 2002 through 2004, as well as 116 airport directors representing airports that applied for, but did not receive a grant during that period. We received response rates of 83 percent and 72 percent, respectively. To view our surveys and airport directors' responses, go to www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-06-101SP. We performed our work from September 2004 through October 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I provides more details on our scope and methodology. Results In Brief DOT considers numerous factors affecting the quality and feasibility of proposed projects before making Small Community Air Service Development grant awards. The law establishing the Small Community Air Service Development Program allows DOT considerable flexibility in implementing the program and selecting projects to be funded. We found that DOT considered the statutory eligibility criteria and priority factors in selecting grant projects. In addition, DOT considers other relevant factors in making decisions on projects, and the final selection is at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation. As of September 30, 2005, there have been 157 grant awards made in the 4 years of the program. The number of applications has declined each year. In 2002, the first year of the program, DOT received 179 applications for grants, and by 2005 the number of applications had declined to 84. DOT officials said that this decline was in part a natural consequence of the large number airports implementing projects at the time, and the effect of legislative changes made in 2003 that limited a community to one grant award for the same project. I In our survey of airport directors, we found that grantee airports generally responded positively when asked about DOT's process for awarding grants. Two-thirds of grantee airports were satisfied with the clarity of selection criteria, while only about one-third of the nongrantee airports responding to the survey were satisfied. For program oversight, DOT relies on responding to grantee inquiries or requests, reviewing documents associated with reimbursable expenses, and reviewing quarterly and final reports that the grantees are required to prepare. DOT oversight has identified cases where grant funds have not been used and it has subsequently reallocated about $4.5 million to other applicants. Finally, as of September 30, 2005, 23 grants were completed-20 from 2002, 2 from 2003, and 1 from 2004.2 DOT officials said that, particularly for the first year of the grant program, projects were slow to complete, in part, due to the airlines' retrenchment after the September 11 attacks. Grantees have identified a variety of goals for their projects and employed many strategies to improve air service and the results of the completed projects to date have been mixed: some have succeeded in meeting the program's goal of improving air service, for example, by adding carriers or destinations, and some have not. Grantee project goals have included adding flights, airlines and destinations, lowering fares, upgrading the aircraft serving the community, obtaining better data for planning and marketing air service, increasing enplanements, and curbing the loss of passengers to other airports. To achieve these goals, grantees have used a number of strategies, including subsidies and revenue guarantees to the airlines, marketing, hiring personnel and consultants, and establishing travel banks in which a community guarantees to buy a certain number of tickets. In addition, grantees have subsidized the start-up of an airline, taken over ground station operations to reduce costs for an airline, and subsidized a bus company to transport passengers from their airport to a hub airport. Incorporating marketing as part of the project was the most common strategy used by airports. Some airline officials also said that marketing efforts were important to the success of projects. Airline officials told us that projects that provide direct benefits to an airline, such as revenue guarantees and financial subsidies, have the greatest chance of success. These officials noted that these types of projects allow the airline to test the real market for air service in a community without enduring the typical financial losses that occur when new air service is introduced. The outcomes of the grants may be affected by broader industry factors that are independent of the grant itself, such as a decision on the part of an airline to reduce the number of flights at a hub. Our review of the 23 projects completed by September 30, 2005, found that although 19 reported service or fare improvements during the life of the grant, only about half reported that the improvements were self-sustaining after the grant was complete. A more detailed review of the 10 grants completed by January 1, 2005, also showed a mixed record of meeting the program's goals, ranging from improved service that exceeded projected passenger loads, to a complete loss of air service to the airport. However, we were not able to determine the overall effectiveness of the program in achieving the act's goal of improving air service to small communities because a large majority of funded projects are still under way (127 of the 157 projects were ongoing as of September 30, 2005) and it will take more time to determine if any air service improvements achieved with the grants are sustainable after projects are complete. Finally, as part of meeting its requirements under the act, DOT has designated one airport each year as an Air Service Development Zone. Each of the three Air Service Development Zone communities that DOT selected through 2004 expressed similar concerns about the usefulness of this designation. None cited any effect or change that the designation had made and expressed confusion as to what the designation was supposed to achieve. All stated that anything that had happened at the airport would have happened without the designation. We are recommending that in preparation for reauthorization of the program in 2008, DOT evaluate completed projects funded by the Small Community Air Service Development Program to determine the effectiveness of this program in improving air service to small communities. We are also recommending that DOT clarify what the support and services it will provide to communities that are designated as Air Service Development Zones. In commenting on a draft of this report, Department of Transportation officials said it generally concurred with the report and agreed to consider the recommendations as they go forward with the program. Background In 1978, the Congress deregulated the airline industry, phasing out the federal government's control over domestic fares and routes served and allowing market forces to determine the price, quantity, and quality of service. Most legacy carriers, free to determine their own routes, developed \"hub-and-spoke\" networks.3 These carriers provide nonstop service to many spoke cities from their hubs. The airports in the small spoke communities include the smallest airports in the nation's commercial air system. Depending on the size of those markets (i.e., the number of passengers flying nonstop between the hub and the spoke community), the legacy airlines may operate their own large jets or use regional affiliate carriers to provide service, usually with regional jet or turboprop aircraft. (See fig. 1 for an example of a turboprop aircraft.) However, low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, use a different model, flying point-to-point generally to and from secondary airports in or near major metropolitan areas, such as Ontario International near Los Angeles and Chicago Midway. Figure 1: Great Lakes Aviation Twin Engine 19-Seat Turboprop The nation's commercial airports are categorized into four main groups based on the annual number of passenger enplanements-large hubs, medium hubs, small hubs, and nonhubs.4 The 30 large hubs and 37 medium hub airports together enplaned the vast majority-89 percent-of the almost 703 million U.S. passengers in 2004, the most recent data available. In contrast, the 69 small hubs enplaned about 8 percent, and the 374 nonhub airports enplaned only 3 percent of U.S. passengers. Air service to nonhub airports has generally declined in recent years, as measured by the number of departure flights. As shown in figure 2, nonhubs have had an overall decrease in departures since July 2000. While all airports showed a decrease in service from July 2001 to July 2003, scheduled departures at small, medium, and large hub airports have increased since 2003. By July 2005, scheduled departures at small, medium, and large hub airports largely rebounded, with departures from large and small hubs exceeding the July 2000 number. However, the decline of service at nonhub airports continued, with 17 percent fewer departure flights serving these airports in July 2005 compared with July 2000. While small hubs and nonhubs are eligible to apply for Small Community Air Service Development grants, the nonhub airports have been the main beneficiaries of the program. As of fiscal year 2005, only 6 percent of the airports receiving grants have been small hubs. Figure 2: Change in Scheduled Departures at Nonhub, Small Hub, Medium Hub and Large Hub Airports since July 2000 Note: The comparison baseline is the number of scheduled departures for July 2000. This decline in air service to small communities is particularly prevalent at small community airports that are near larger airports. Passengers sometimes drive or take other modes of transportation to neighboring larger airports to take advantage of more frequent flights and lower fares, a phenomenon called leakage. Appendix II provides more information on the factors that have influenced the reduction of passenger traffic and air service at the nation's small community airports. We have previously reported on the decline of air service to small communities noting the challenges these communities face in obtaining or retaining commercial passenger air service.5 These challenges include the lack of demand, inability to operate profitable air service, and competition from neighboring larger hub airports. Also, according to an aviation consultant, these factors, plus network carrier financial difficulties and changes in aircraft usage, have negatively affected nonhubs. Two programs have been established to help address air service to small communities-the Essential Air Service program and the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program. The Congress established the Essential Air Service program as part of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. In general, the program guarantees that communities that received air service prior to deregulation will continue to receive air service.6 If an air carrier could not continue service to a community without incurring a loss, DOT (and before its sunset, the Civil Aeronautics Board) could then use Essential Air Service program funds to award a subsidy to that carrier or another carrier willing to provide service. These subsidies are intended to cover the difference between a carrier's projected revenues and expenses, and include a 5 percent profit margin. Our prior work on the Essential Air Service program found, in part, that financial incentives may offer the best opportunity for communities to attract the new or additional service but that it may be difficult to bring about service that can be sustained after the incentives end. More recently, the Congress authorized the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program as part of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, P.L. 106-181 (AIR-21), to help small communities enhance their air service. AIR-21 authorized the program for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The Vision 100-Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, P.L. 108-176 (Vision 100), reauthorized the program for an additional 5 years, through fiscal year 2008, and eliminated the \"pilot\" status of the program. While Vision 100 increased the annual authorization amount to $35 million, the Congress has appropriated $20 million for the program each year from 2002 through 2005, for a total of $80 million.7 No funds were appropriated for the first year of the program, 2001. Under this program, DOT is authorized to award grants to up to 40 communities served by small hub or nonhub airports (as classified in 1997) that have demonstrated air service deficiencies or higher-than-average airfares. The Office of Aviation Analysis in DOT's Office of the Secretary is responsible for administering the program. The grants may be made to a single community or to a consortium of communities, although no more than four grants each year may be in the same state. Consortiums are considered one applicant for the purpose of this program.8 Some relatively large airports qualify for this program. For example, Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Buffalo, NY, and Norfolk International Airport in Norfolk, VA, are eligible for the program, enplaning over 2.2 million and over 1.8 million passengers in 2004, respectively. In contrast, small nonhub airports such as the airports in Kake, AK, with about 2,500 enplanements, or Owensboro, KY, with about 2,800 enplanements, are also eligible. The program is available in the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories and possessions. The statute also directs DOT to designate one of the grant recipients each year as an Air Service Development Zone and work closely with the designated community on ways to attract business to the areas surrounding the airport and to develop land use options for the area. There are no additional funds associated with this designation, and no special benefit or preference is to be given to communities seeking this designation in receiving a grant under the program. Communities apply for this designation through the regular grant application process. DOT has not issued separate regulations for the Small Community Air Service Development Program. Instead, DOT issues an order every year that requests applications and provides guidance for the proper format and content of the applications. The authorizing legislation provides that if funds are used to subsidize air service, the subsidy cannot last more than 3 years. However, the time needed to obtain the service is not included in the subsidy time limit. While the legislation does not limit the period for expenditure of funds on non-subsidy projects, DOT's fiscal year 2005 order indicates that in general, grant funds should be expended within 3 years of the award. As shown in figure 3, DOT's awards have been geographically spread covering all states except Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. To date, no communities in Delaware or Rhode Island have applied for a grant. Appendix IV contains information on all grants awarded as of September 30, 2005. DOT's Implementation of the Small Community Air Service Development Program Includes Awarding Grants by Using Legislatively Established Priority and Other Factors and Providing Grant Oversight In the first 4 years of the Small Community Air Service Development Program, DOT awarded a total of 157 grants.9 In 2002, the first year the program was funded, DOT received 179 grant applications, but this number has been declining and was at a low of 84 applications by 2005. DOT officials believe this decline is natural as the program matures; many airports are currently implementing grants and others now understand DOT's expectation of local matching funds. DOT evaluates the applications according to legislatively established priority factors and other criteria. DOT first considers five priority factors specified in the laws and then considers numerous other factors in a second tier review of the projects. Certain legislative factors, such as whether a local community can demonstrate support by contributing some local matching funds, or DOT factors such as whether an airport has received a grant in the past, were major considerations in award decisions. In our survey of airport directors, we found that airports that received grants generally were positive about DOT's process for awarding grants. However, only about one-third of the airports we surveyed that applied for but did not receive a grant expressed satisfaction over the clarity of selection criteria. DOT's oversight of projects relies largely on reviews of reimbursement documents and required grantee quarterly reports; it does not perform on-site monitoring visits. DOT monitoring has been sufficient to identify cases where grant funds have not been utilized and reallocated the funds to other applicants. As of September 30, 2005, 23 of the grants awarded were completed-20 for 2002, 2 for 2003, and 1 for 2004. About $12.5 million, or 62 percent of the $20 million total funds for 2002 had been expended by grantees as of September 30, 2005. DOT officials said that the newness of the program in 2002, and the need to negotiate agreements with airlines, help explain why many early grants are still ongoing. DOT Has Awarded 157 Grants Since 2002, but Grant Applications are Declining To be considered for a Small Community Air Service Development Program grant, airport communities prepare a grant proposal in response to a notice in the Federal Register. The applications should discuss, among other things, the need for additional or improved air service, the available fares at the airport, and how the grant will help communities address these situations. From 2002 through 2005, DOT has awarded 157 grants. In the first year of the program, demand was the highest, with 179 applications requesting a total of about $142.5 million in federal funding. However, from 2002 through 2005 the program has experienced about a 50 percent decline in the number of applications. (See fig. 4 for details on the number of applications, awards, and completed and terminated grants each year.) Figure 4: Small Community Air Service Development Program Grant Applications, Awards, Completions, and Terminations, 2002 through 2005 Note: In 2004, DOT awarded six grants with prior year funds that were reallocated from four grants that were originally awarded in 2002 and 2003 but were later terminated. According to officials at DOT's Office of Aviation Analysis, the downward trend in the number of applications was a natural consequence of the implementation of the program. First, many eligible airport communities have already received a grant and are still implementing their projects-as of September 30, 2005, 127 of the 157 grants were ongoing. Current grantees are not likely to reapply soon because many of the projects that were funded take time to implement, with some taking over 3 years to complete. Second, Office of Aviation Analysis officials told us that the airport community has learned that DOT expects that a local cash match should be part of the proposal and that communities must honor their committed local contribution for the proposed projects. The officials told us that some applicants did not fully appreciate this expectation during the pilot phase of the program. Finally, according to DOT officials, legislative changes in 2003 prohibited communities or consortiums from receiving more than one grant for the same project and established the timely use of funds as a priority factor for DOT to consider in awarding grants. Based on our survey, for airports that had applied for but never received a grant at the time of the survey, 58 of 81 airport directors, or about 72 percent, said that they would reapply. The remaining 23 airport directors indicated that they would not, or were unsure whether they would apply. These airport directors cited two primary reasons for not applying-the cost and effort of applying, or a belief that DOT would not fund their desired project. Finally, some eligible airports have never applied for a grant. To understand why, we contacted airport directors from a group of 20 randomly selected airports that had never applied under the program but were eligible to do so. Although this does not constitute a generalizable sample, it provides some useful information on the reasons why some communities did not apply. Among the more common reasons cited by the directors for not applying were that they did not know about the program, or they felt that the cost and effort of applying were too burdensome. Among the other reasons given by more than one airport director were the airport already had sufficient air service, officials thought the airport was not eligible, their grant application would not be competitive, or DOT would not fund the kind of project the airport would like to do. In our survey of 2002 though 2004 grantees and discussions with officials of the 10 completed projects, we found that the grantees were generally satisfied with the application process and paperwork requirements. Of the 121 grantee airport directors responding, 103 were satisfied or very satisfied with the application process. In addition, in our discussions with the directors of the 10 community airports that had completed grant projects, most were satisfied with the application process, although three expressed concern about the limited amount of time they had to complete their applications after the 2002 announcement. In our survey of grantees, this issue did not appear to be significant, especially in years subsequent to 2002. DOT has made minor modifications in the application process as it has gained experience with the program, such as allowing 90 days instead of 60 days to complete the application, and has continued to allow for flexibility in application format, according to Office of Aviation Analysis officials. DOT Evaluates Grant Applications According to Legislatively Established Priority Factors and DOT Criteria The Small Community Air Service Development Program is a discretionary program that allows DOT considerable flexibility in selecting projects for financial assistance, within the basic eligibility criteria. To be eligible, the airport cannot be larger than a small hub airport based on 1997 FAA boarding data and must have insufficient air service or unreasonably high air fares. In addition to the basic eligibility criteria, DOT must give priority to projects according to five factors established in the law. These factors constitute DOT's Office of Aviation Analysis' first tier of project evaluation. DOT must give priority consideration to communities that (1) have air fares higher than average for all communities, (2) provide a portion of the cost of the project from local sources other than airport revenues, (3) have or will establish a public-private partnership to facilitate air carrier service to the public, (4) will provide material benefits to a broad segment of the public that has limited access to the national air transportation system, and (5) will use the assistance in a timely manner. Although a local community match from nonairport revenues enhances a community's chance of receiving a grant, it is not required under the act. However, DOT has funded only two projects that did not contain a local cash match. In addition to the priority factors, DOT has, as part of a second tier evaluation, other \"service-related\" and \"project-related\" factors that it takes into consideration in evaluating competing proposals. (See app. III for a list of the factors used in DOT selections.) DOT uses this second tier evaluation to ensure that a project has a strong justification, and the factors themselves have changed and evolved over time, according to DOT officials. For example, as part of this second tier evaluation, DOT looked at 15 air service factors to identify whether a carrier served the airport and reviewed the airport's existing service frequencies, destinations, aircraft size, and passenger boardings. It also examined air service in the broader geographic area, including the applicant community's proximity to larger airports and the quality of the roads providing access to those airports. DOT also considered 26 project-related factors, which include such items as whether the area's demographics will support the project or whether the project actually addressed the community's air service problem. Some project-related factors can make it less likely to be selected, including whether (1) the proposal simply shifted costs from the local to the federal level, (2) the air service was in proximity to other service that would detract from the proposal, and (3) the proposal potentially worked at cross purposes with another grant if the airport is located close to a past grant recipient. DOT has developed review procedures that detail how it processes the applications that it receives and how it applies this two-tier evaluation of projects. DOT moved to a more structured process when the Congress, in December 2003, changed the status of the program, dropping the pilot designation of the program. For 2004, DOT developed more formal documentation of its assessment of how well projects met the statutory eligibility criteria and priority factors for each grant application. The DOT application evaluation reports we reviewed have shown how DOT incorporates the priority factors in its 2004 deliberations and how those results then translate into the projects it recommends to the Secretary of Transportation. Generally, applications that meet fewer of the priority considerations are less likely to be selected for grant assistance. However, priority factors are not the sole criteria in the final selection. As shown in table 1, applications that met four or five of the priority factors were not guaranteed selection. Twelve of the 35 applications that met four out of five of the priority considerations did not make the final award list, and one proposal that met all five was not selected. In contrast 13 applications that met three priority considerations were funded. Table 1: Fiscal Year 2004 Grant Applications Meeting Priority Factors and Award Results Priority factors met Number of applications meeting Number receiving factors awards 1 of 5 5 0 2 of 5 14 0 3 of 5 37 13 4 of 5 35 23 5 of 5 5 4 Disqualified 12 0 Total 108 40 Source: GAO analysis of DOT data. Note: A fiscal year 2004 application may have been disqualified because it was incomplete, the airport community received a grant for the same project in prior years, the project concept was no longer feasible, or the service was obtained without a grant. Projects that meet priority factors may not be funded for a number of reasons. According to a DOT official, a project may meet the priority factors yet not have any realistic possibility of implementation or success. DOT may also choose to award a grant to a community that has never received one before awarding a second grant to another community. DOT's review of the priority factors involves determining a yes or no response for each factor. DOT does not use a weighting or point system or other scoring system to numerically rate the projects. However, DOT officials told us that they are aware that, although in some cases a proposal may technically meet the factor, it may do so very weakly. For example, a project satisfies a priority factor if it will use nonairport revenues as part of its local contribution, no matter how small that nonairport contribution may be. On the other hand, a large non-airport contribution can be viewed as a strong indicator of community support. The final decisions on which projects are selected are thus a result of the consideration of both the priority factors and other factors that affect the quality of the proposal and its perceived chances of success. Once Office of Aviation Analysis staff have reviewed and analyzed the individual projects, the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs reviews the staff assessments and finalizes a list of recommended projects for the Secretary of Transportation. According to Office of Aviation Analysis staff, through fiscal year 2004, the Secretary had agreed with the recommended list. In fiscal year 2005, subsequent to the meeting with the Secretary to review recommended awards, DOT made changes in the recommended grants. According to Office of Aviation Analysis staff, this was done to achieve a better balance of participating communities and a better balance in the distribution of funds. Our survey of grantee airports showed that a large majority of the directors at these airports were satisfied with DOT's selection criteria and process for the program, while fewer nongrantee airport directors thought the selection criteria were clear. Eighty of 121 grantees responding-or 66 percent-were either satisfied or very satisfied with the clarity of the selection criteria, while only 26 of 82 nongrantee airport directors-or 32 percent-were either satisfied or very satisfied with the clarity of the selection criteria. A possible explanation for this is that while DOT has flexibility in making awards and considers many criteria in addition to the five priority factors, the ultimate selection decision is discretionary. A few of the fiscal year 2002 airport grantees we visited observed that although they were pleased they were chosen, they were not sure how grantees are selected and what criteria were used. DOT Oversees Projects Largely by Reviewing Reimbursement Documents and Reports from Grantees DOT's Office of Aviation Analysis staff are responsible for oversight of the grants and serve as contact points with grantees. For the 2005 program cycle, six staff were assigned part-time to the program, an increase from four part-time staff during the program's first 3 years. DOT uses a document review approach to oversight in which it requires grantees to submit quarterly reports that are used to assess a project's progress and timeliness. The agency also requires that grantees submit a final report on the project, which is used as the basis for its overall evaluation of the project and holds back 10 percent of the grant funds until the receipt of a final report. DOT operates the program on a reimbursable basis-grantees must first expend funds from their own resources for project activities and then request reimbursement from DOT for allowable expenses. To ensure that government reimbursements are proper and allowable, DOT reviews expense receipts, invoices, and other evidence of expenditures grantees submit for reimbursement and, if satisfactory, will authorize FAA to make payment.10 DOT and FAA maintain and monitor reimbursement information on their financial databases. Office of Aviation Analysis officials told us that they use this approach because performing on-site visits is impractical given the small number of DOT staff who administer the over 100 active grantees currently in the program. They also noted that there is no provision for administrative expenses in the appropriation, thus DOT does not have funds available for site visits. DOT monitoring has been sufficient to identify cases where grant recipients have been both successful and unsuccessful in implementing their grants. In those cases where sponsors have difficulty implementing their projects and are unable to utilize their grant awards, the grants are terminated and funds reverted back to DOT for reallocation to other applicants. From 2002 through 2004, DOT reallocated about $4.5 million to other projects. The manner in which DOT administers oversight of grantee reimbursements and provides assistance generated a favorable response from grantees. Our survey found that grantees had high levels of satisfaction with the way DOT monitored the grants and provided assistance to grantees. Specifically, 108 of 121, or 89 percent, of grantee airport directors who responded to our survey said that they were satisfied or very satisfied with DOT's assistance. Likewise, 96 of 121, or 79 percent, of responding airport directors were satisfied or very satisfied with DOT's monitoring or oversight activities. In general, grantees did not see the amount of paperwork required by DOT's quarterly reporting mandate as burdensome, with 86 of 121-71 percent-of survey respondents being satisfied or very satisfied with this quarterly reporting requirement. A lower number, 58 of 119-or about half of airport respondents-said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the paperwork DOT required for reimbursement and only 5 respondents were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. However, one airport consultant noted that for very small airports with very few full-time staff, the reimbursement requirements can be more difficult to complete. Grantees Have Been Slow to Implement Some Projects The Vision 100-Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act added a provision that DOT grant assistance will be used in a timely fashion as an additional priority consideration for selection to participate in the program as of 2004. The only limitation the authorizing legislation places on the timely expenditure of funds is that air service subsidies cannot last more than 3 years. DOT's 2004 and 2005 grant announcements set an expectation that the funds should be used within 3 years. Although this criterion was not part of the 2002 grant process, it does provide a benchmark for performance, and 2002 grants are at the 3-year point. As of September 30, 2005, 16 of 40 fiscal year 2002 grants were still active, 20 were completed, and 4 had been terminated by DOT. About 62 percent of the $20 million total 2002 program grant allocation had been reimbursed to 2002 grantees. In addition, 58 grants are scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2006. Table 2 shows the amounts DOT reimbursed each year through September 30, 2005. (See app. IV for more detailed information about the status of specific grants.) Table 2: Reimbursed to Grantees, as of September 30, 2005 Dollars in millions Year of FY 2002 grants amount FY 2003 FY 2004 Total reimbursement and (percent) grants amount grants amount reimbursed and (percent) and (percent) amount 2002 $0 (0.0) $0 2003 5.5 (27.3) $.01 (.05) 5.5 2004 4.9 (24.7) 2.2 (10.9) $0 (0.0) 7.1 2005 2.1 (10.5) 4.1 (20.5) 2.2 (11.1) 8.4 Total $12.5 (62.4) $6.3 (31.5) $2.2 (11.1) $21.0 Source: GAO analysis of DOT data. Notes: (1) The percentages shown were determined by comparing the amount of reimbursements made in that year with total awards for that grant year. (2) Calendar Year 2005 reimbursement are through September 30, 2005. (3) DOT recovered about $2.6 million unused from fiscal year 2002 grants and about $1.9 million unused from fiscal year 2003 grants and transferred these funds to other grants. It also transferred $5 million in fiscal year 2005 funds to the Essential Air Service program. Office of Aviation Analysis officials told us that the 2002 grants are not an indication of what has happened with the grants awarded in following years. According to the officials, a number of factors contributed to the 2002 projects being delayed. First year grants were not awarded until late fall of 2002. In addition, the airlines were at that time still recovering following September 11, which made it difficult for communities to attract new service. Many projects included revenue guarantees, which can take some time to finalize. Finally, communities may wait to ask for reimbursements after several months of expenditures, which slows the payout of federal funds. The reimbursement data indicate that the 2003 grants also experienced low reimbursements the first year. Only about 11 percent of the 2003 grant funds were reimbursed by the end of calendar 2004. Finally, it should be noted that when a project includes a revenue guarantee, the slow expenditure of funds does not always indicate a problem. Revenue guarantees are only paid out if the airline fails to meet a revenue target. If it meets the target, no funds are drawn down, which may actually be an indication of project success. For example, the $500,000 grant award to Rhinelander, WI, included almost $492,000 for a revenue guarantee. However, upon project completion, Rhinelander had used about $254,000 for the revenue guarantee. According to the airport director, the new route initiated under the grant generated more revenue for the airline during the grant period than had been expected. Therefore, the airport did not have to reimburse the airline as much as it had anticipated. As part of our survey of grantees, we asked whether their projects were proceeding on schedule, and, if not, why they were proceeding more slowly than expected. About 40 percent-42 of 106-of the grantee airport directors reported that their projects are behind schedule, including 11 of 26 airport directors surveyed who were involved in implementing grants awarded in 2002. (See table 3.) Most of these respondents, 23 of the 42, cited difficulties in entering and finalizing agreements with the airlines as the main reason for the delay. Grantees we surveyed also cited other reasons for delays, including issues with airport personnel and among the grant consortium, operational changes at Chicago O'Hare airport, and the need to coordinate the grant with the Essential Air Service program.11 Table 3: Airport Directors Assessments of Grant Progress Year grant Ahead of On schedule Behind No basis to judge/No Total awarded schedule schedule response responses 2002 0 9 11 6 26 2003 1 13 19 7 40 2004 3 22 12 3 40 Total 4 44 42 16 106 Source: GAO analysis of survey results of airport managers involved in grants. Note: Because not all airport directors responded to our survey, the number of respondents is smaller than the number of grants awarded. On a case-by-case basis, DOT has approved a number of grant amendments, including extending the grant expiration date, to projects that have been slow to be implemented. As of July 26, 2005, DOT had amended a total of 47 grants, including 27 of the 2002 grants. For example, Binghamton, NY, wanted to obtain enhanced service to Washington, D.C., via United Express and Detroit, MI, via Northwest Airlink by providing the airlines with revenue guarantees. According to officials from the Office of Aviation Analysis, there was some delay because of difficulties in negotiating with the airlines. DOT agreed to extend the grant expiration date, allowing Binghamton extra time to work out agreements with United and Northwest. However, during these extended negotiations, the airlines told Binghamton that they would agree to provide the enhanced service only if the community offered subsidies rather than revenue guarantees. As a result, DOT also allowed Binghamton to amend its grant to provide the airlines with subsidies rather than revenue guarantees to better accommodate the airlines' requirements. Another example is the grant agreement amendment DOT provided Lamar, CO. Lamar did not have any commercial service prior to its grant award. The purpose of the grant was to obtain service from Rio Grande Airlines to access scheduled service to Denver International Airport. Lamar was not successful in obtaining service from Rio Grande Airlines and instead obtained service to Denver's Front Range Airport from Lamar Flying Service, a charter carrier. The Office of Aviation Analysis agreed to amend Lamar's grant to allow Lamar Flying Service the time to expand its base of operations and establish dependable air transportation. Lamar subsequently provided four scheduled trips a week to Denver International Airport and has since been able to upgrade its aircraft. Variety of Goals and Strategies to Improve Air Service are Used, but the Results to Date of Completed Projects are Mixed The Small Community Air Service Development Program allows communities to set a variety of goals for projects, and individual projects have been directed at adding flights, airlines, and destinations; lowering fares; changing the aircraft serving the community; completing a study for planning and marketing air service; increasing enplanements; and curbing the leakage of passengers to other airports. To achieve these goals, grant sponsors have used a number of strategies, commonly including subsidies and revenue guarantees to the airlines, marketing to the public and to the airlines, hiring personnel and consultants, and establishing travel banks in which a community guarantees to buy a certain number of tickets. In addition, communities have employed a number of other strategies, including buying an aircraft, subsidizing the start-up of an airline, and taking over ground station operations to reduce the costs for an airline. The outcomes of the grants may be affected by broader industry factors that are independent of the grant itself, such as larger strategic decisions on the part of the airlines. Our evaluation of completed projects indicates mixed results, but only 23 of 157 projects were completed as of September 30, 2005.12 While officials at 19 of the 23 airports reported improvements to air service or fares during the life of the grant, only about half said that the improvements appeared to be self-sustaining. With 127 of the 157 grants still ongoing, it is too soon to determine which specific types of strategies work best or assess the overall effectiveness of the grant program to improve air service to small communities. Most Common Project Goals Were Related to Increasing Service and Enplanements According to our survey of 146 airport directors that received funds from the 122 grants DOT awarded from 2002 through 2004, the most common goals associated with Small Community Air Service Development Program grants were generally related to increasing service and enplanements (see fig. 5). Recapturing passenger traffic-that is, stopping leakage to other airports-was also a frequent objective that increased in importance each year of the program. In contrast, conducting a study of the local market or changing the type of aircraft serving the community were relatively infrequent goals. By 2004, relatively few airports cited these goals for their grants. Finally, although addressing high fares is an explicit goal of the program, lowering fares was cited as an objective by 62 airport directors of the 146 airport directors over the 3-year span. Figure 5: Project Goals as Identified by Airport Directors for Grants Awarded 2002 through 2004 Note: Some airport directors identified more than one goal. In addition, because some grants cover multiple airports through a consortium, the number of airport directors responding may be greater than the number of grants DOT awarded in that year. Grant Projects Use Many Different Strategies to Meet Their Goals Grantees engaged in a number of strategies to meet their goals, including various financial incentives, marketing, studies, and other approaches. For example, a number of different financial incentives have been funded under the program, including: o Start-up subsidies-these provide assistance for an airline to begin operations or pay for an aircraft. o Revenue guarantees-the community and air carrier agree on a revenue target and the community pays the carrier only if revenues from the service do not meet the target. o Travel banks-businesses or individuals deposit or promise future travel funds to a carrier providing new or expanded service. A business entity may handle an account containing the travel funds, and contributing entities then draw down on this account. o Airport station operations-the airport may assume the ground station operations for one or a number of carriers serving the airport. Ground personnel such as baggage handlers and ticket agents become airport employees and may be shared among the airlines. Airlines pay for these services, but their cost can be lower than if provided by the airline itself. Marketing support generally took a variety of forms, including mass media such as television, radio, magazine and newspaper advertising, outdoor advertising such as billboards and banners, direct mail, internet advertising including using the airport web site, airport special events such as open houses, frequent flyer promotions, travel agent incentives, and other approaches. Figure 6 shows an example of the use of outdoor advertising in one of the marketing projects funded by the grants. Figure 6: Example of a Billboard Advertisement Resulting from a Grant Project The Small Community Air Service Development Program also has funded studies and various other approaches. For example, in 2002, DOT awarded the Aleutians East Borough in Alaska a $240,000 grant to study the air service market for some rural airports in the lower Alaskan peninsula and the eastern Aleutian Islands. DOT also subsequently awarded the Aleutians East Borough $70,000 in 2003 to expand the study. Finally, other approaches have included developing alternative ground services such as bus service to nearby hubs and funding personnel such as airport economic development staff positions or consultants. We reviewed the grant applications and agreements for all 157 grants awarded from 2002 through 2005. Projects commonly include more than one strategy, such as combining a revenue guarantee with marketing for the air service provided under the grant. Over time, a few trends can be seen in the strategies used by communities. First, while marketing activities have always been heavily used as a strategy, by 2004 marketing had virtually become a universal strategy. All 46 grants-the initial 40 DOT awarded plus the 6 additional grants awarded with reallocated prior year grant funds-included marketing as a component. Second, the number of projects using direct subsidies and travel banks declined by 2004 and remained low in 2005, while the number of projects using revenue guarantees increased after 2002. Revenue guarantees have been the most common form of financial assistance each year of the program. Figure 7 provides a summary of the types of strategies communities have used under the program. Figure 7: Strategies Included in Grant Projects Note: DOT awarded 40 grants in 2002, 36 grants in 2003, 46 grants in 2004 (including 6 grants awarded using funds reallocated from prior declined, terminated, or completed projects) and 35 grants in 2005. Because marketing was such a heavily used strategy, we contacted all 23 airports that had completed their grants by September 30, 2005, to determine what types of marketing they actually did. We found that 22 of the 23 completed grants had included some kind of marketing component to encourage greater use of the airport or the airlines that fly there; the lone exception was a grant which funded a study only. All 22 grantees used newspaper advertising, 21 used radio advertising, and 21 used the Internet-for example, the airport Web site. Television and outdoor advertising were also common strategies, 17 grantees used television and 18 used outdoor advertising.13 After these strategies, the most common forms of marketing were airport special events (14 projects), magazine ads (12 projects), and direct mail (11 projects). Other types of marketing, such as frequent flyer promotions, travel agent incentives, or trade show booths, were also used in a few cases. Participating Airlines Generally Favored Revenue Guarantees Officials from airlines participating in the Small Community Air Service Development Program said revenue guarantees or other forms of financial subsidies were generally their preferred type of strategy, but they also considered other types of strategies proposed by communities under the program. We contacted each of the airlines associated with the 10 projects completed by January 1, 2005, including Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Horizon Airlines, Rio Grande Air, TransStates Airlines, US Airways, and Westward Airways. Although their comments do not constitute a comprehensive analysis of industry views of the grant program, they provide a useful perspective on how participating airlines view the program. Several airline officials noted that reducing financial risk has become a key factor for airline and airport officials and consultants we interviewed also made this observation. Finally, airline officials said they perform their own due diligence doing market analyses of the airports, the competitive situation, and route finances regardless of what a local study says. Airlines face challenges when initiating air service to a community. Start-up costs can be significant and include repositioning equipment, renting space, and hiring and training personnel. Also, even if a viable air travel market exists in a community, entering a new market involves changing passengers' existing travel patterns and loyalties, which may take time. Airline officials noted that given the current financial condition of the industry, airlines cannot afford to take a year of losses to build a customer base in a market, as they had in the past. For this reason, airline officials stated that they often could not enter smaller markets without some kind of revenue guarantee, such as that provided by a Small Community Air Service Development Program grant, or other financial support from the community. Airline officials emphasized that for a project to be of interest to them, the market must be potentially self-sustaining without subsidy or revenue guarantee in the longer term. The grant will eventually end and airlines do not wish to start over in another market, with the accompanying costs and risks. Airline officials also emphasized the importance of local funding to provide marketing for the new service; for some airlines, this was a crucial factor in selecting the community. A related observation by airline officials was that the level of local support and commitment to air service was a key factor in their decision to work with a local community. The Small Community Air Service Development Program has this component of local commitment, which some airline officials saw as important. In addition, some airline officials said that the overall project (grant and local match) must be sufficiently large to gain their interest. Finally, most airline officials were unfavorably disposed toward travel banks citing the difficulty in administering them and their poor track record of success. However, one airline official said they had been involved with successful travel banks and was open to the prospect of trying that strategy again. All airline officials we talked to had positive views of the Small Community Air Service Development Program. Several officials stated that the program was superior to the Essential Air Service program because it addressed markets that were potentially self-sustaining but were underserved. However, in one case, airline officials said they were concerned about communities using the program to attract low-cost carriers to compete with existing service they were already providing to the community. Office of Aviation Analysis officials noted that higher than average fares is a statutory criterion for priority consideration in the selection of grantees, so introducing a low-cost carrier into a community is an acceptable strategy for a community under the program. Completed Grants Indicated Mixed Results We contacted officials of the 23 Small Community Air Service Development Program grant projects that were complete by September 30, 2005, and compared them against the program's goals of improved air service and found that there were mixed results. In general, we found that the airport officials reported almost all the completed projects had some positive effect on air service during the life of the grant, but in some cases the improvements did not remain after the initial grant period, or that the improvements were not self-sustaining. For most completed grants, 19 of the 23, airport officials reported some kind of improvement in service, either in terms of an added carrier, destination, flights, or change in the type of aircraft. Of the 23, 8 reported adding a new carrier, 13 a new destination, and 13 an increase in the number of flights. In addition, 13 reported that some fares had lowered at the airport during the grant. These service and fare improvements may explain the positive effect on enplanements the airport officials reported-19 grantees reported enplanements rose during the course of the grant. However, the improvements seen during the grant did not always continue afterwards. Fourteen of the 23 grantees reported that the improvements were still in place as of October 1, 2005. Further, there is the question of whether the service or fare improvement is self-sustaining and will continue without additional funding. About half the grantees with completed grants-11 of the 23 grantees-reported that the improvements they experienced as a result of the program were self-sustaining thus far. It should be noted that these outcomes are preliminary. Thirteen of these grants were completed in 2005, and determining whether a particular project is successful may depend on the timeframe used. For example, Westward Airways was able to initially provide service to Scottsbluff, NE, under the grant, but later went out of business. We also visited 10 airports that had completed grants by January 1, 2005, in order to gain a more detailed understanding of the outcomes of their projects (app. V contains discussion of each of these). Of these, five projects-Charleston, WV; Daytona Beach, FL; Hailey, ID; Lynchburg, VA; and Mobile, AL, were generally successful in achieving their goals and had made self-sustaining improvements to air service at the time of our review. o Charleston was able to add a new air carrier (Continental) and destination (Houston). However, Continental subsequently reduced the number of daily flights from two to one. Charleston officials said this was a result of a larger strategic allocation of equipment by Continental, and the airline later restored this second flight to Charleston. o Daytona Beach's objective was to add service to Newark, NJ, which has remained in place after the grant was completed. After the grant was completed, Continental extended its agreement with the airport. DOT officials said that Continental has also expanded its service at the community to additional destinations. o Hailey successfully added air service to Los Angeles via Horizon Airlines (see fig. 8). Although the service continues, it does not operate all year long due to the seasonal nature of demand to this resort community. After the grant expired, a local resort funded the revenue guarantee to Horizon, indicating that the service was initially not self-sustaining. However, Horizon now offers the service without a grant guarantee. In addition, the grant helped convince Horizon to add another flight to a new destination, Oakland, CA. o Lynchburg, VA, was able to upgrade service to Atlanta from 30-seat turboprops to 50-seat regional jets through a revenue guarantee. The new jet service resulted in higher load factors on the larger regional jets than on the smaller turboprops due to increased demand. This service also has continued after the completion of the grant. DOT officials said that the community has also succeeded in negotiating, with its carrier, relative fare parity with the carrier's operations with a nearby airport. o Mobile, AL, established an innovative program to assume the ground operations, including baggage handling and staffing ticket counters for US Airways, which was about to abandon service to the airport, according to an airline official. US Airways has maintained its operations in Mobile, and the airport has expanded this program, with American Airlines joining the ground operations service. Figure 8: Horizon Airlines Turboprop Serving Hailey, ID The four projects that did not result in self-sustaining improvements in air service were Fort Smith, AR; Reading, PA; Scottsbluff, NE; and Taos, NM. o Ft. Smith provides an example of how larger events in the aviation industry can affect the outcome of the grant. Ft. Smith obtained the air service it sought under the grant, however, American Airlines' strategic decision to reduce the number of flights at its St. Louis hub resulted in Ft. Smith losing the service. o In the case of Reading, PA, the grant may have had a negative effect on air service. The grant established a bus service from Reading Airport to the Philadelphia airport, with the goal of demonstrating that air travel demand existed in Reading and service could be added to the airport. However, the bus service provided competition to the existing air carrier at Reading, which subsequently withdrew its service. The bus service ultimately failed (although a private operator has re-established bus service without subsidy), and Reading was left for a time without any scheduled air service. o Scottsbluff, NE, was initially successful in resuming an intrastate air service between Scottsbluff, North Platte, Lincoln, and Omaha via start-up air carrier Westward Airways. This service did not reach the expected level of enplanements and Westward Airways, which was able to begin operations with the help of the grant, ceased operations in July 2005. o Taos, NM, was not able to achieve sufficient enplanements to make its air service self-sufficient, and Rio Grande Air, the small carrier that provided the service to Taos, went bankrupt.14 Finally, it is too early to determine whether the $95,000 grant to Somerset, KY, may be considered a success. The purpose of the grant was to conduct a study, which has been successfully completed. However, the ultimate goal of the program and the grant is to improve or attract air service. Because the community received a second grant in 2005, it will be possible in the future to determine the ultimate outcome of the initial and subsequent grants. Until the results of Somerset's efforts to attract service are known, it is too soon to evaluate this grant. Some of the 10 grantees we visited identified additional positive and negative indirect effects not anticipated at the time of the grant. For example, one airport cited increased community involvement as a positive outgrowth of the grant-it helped forge ties between the airport and business community that were not there before. In addition, the study performed with grant funding fostered better community understanding of the local airline market. In a few instances, services begun under the grant stimulated other air service not part of the grant such as attracting other new service or improved service by a competing carrier. Conversely, some airport officials were concerned that grants to nearby competing airports could dilute effects of the grant at their airports. An airport official and an industry consultant also expressed concern that the program was no longer producing innovative ideas. Instead, some airports were copying approaches that had been funded in the past as a way to improve their chances of receiving a grant. Because a large majority of Small Community Air Service Development Project grants are not complete (127 of the 157 grants were ongoing as of September 30, 2005), it is too soon to determine which strategies have performed the best or assess the overall effectiveness of this program to improve air service to small communities. However, in addition to the preliminary results from the projects we studied, comments from DOT officials, airport directors, and airline officials provide some indications of what strategies that had positive results. Airline officials saw projects that provide direct financial benefits to the airline, such as revenue guarantees, as having the greatest chance of success. These officials noted that these types of projects allow the airline to test the real market for air service in a community without enduring the typical financial losses that occur when new air service is introduced. Airline officials also said that marketing efforts were important for success. DOT and some airline officials doubted the effectiveness of travel banks, in part because of the difficulty with administering the program. Finally, one strategy that airport and airline officials found innovative was for airports to take over the airlines' ground station operations, such as ticketing and baggage handling. Only two airports have used this strategy under the program, so it is too early to tell if this model will be more widely adopted. Most Airport Directors Indicated That Their Grant Projects Were Effective or That It Was Too Soon to Tell Most grantee airport directors we surveyed indicated that their projects were at least partially successful or that it is too early to make an assessment. As shown in table 4, 60 of 120 airport directors that responded said that their grant was effective or very effective in increasing passenger traffic. About 46 percent (54 of 118) of airport directors said that their grant was effective or very effective in improving service quality. However, in both instances, almost as many airport directors said that they had no basis to judge effectiveness or that the question was not applicable. In addition, 38 of 118 airport directors answered that their grant had been effective or very effective in reducing high fares. A majority, 63 airport directors, said that this issue was not applicable or they had no basis to judge. Table 4: Airport Directors' Views on Success of Grant Projects Very As effective Very effective NA or Total effective or as or ineffective No effective ineffective basis responses to judge Increasing 60 7 1 52 120 passenger traffic Improving air 54 11 2 51 118 service quality Resolving fare 38 9 8 63 118 issues Source: GAO survey of grantee airport directors. Some of the airport directors responding to our survey also said that they thought the funds used for marketing had been effective. For example, one airport director said that the small airport he directs does not have a marketing budget and that the grant funds provided for marketing were more than the airport's total annual operating budget. The marketing funds therefore, brought public awareness the airport would not otherwise have been able to obtain. Another airport director said that he believed the marketing program conducted as part of the airport's grant resulted in an 11 percent annual increase in enplanements. Usefulness of Air Service Development Zone Designation Is Not Clear AIR-21 requires that each year DOT designate an Air Service Development Zone as part of the Small Community Air Service Development Program. The act specifies that DOT shall work with the community or consortium on means to attract business to the area surrounding the airport, to develop land use options for the area, and provide data working with the Department of Commerce and other agencies. DOT sees this designation as providing an opportunity for the selected community to work with its grant award to stimulate economic development, increase use of the airport's facilities, and create a productive relationship between the community and the federal government to achieve these goals. DOT has designated one airport each year of the program as an Air Service Development Zone-Augusta, GA (2002); Dothan, AL (2003); Waterloo, IA (2004); and Hibbing, MN (2005). Airports may apply for the designation by indicating their interest and providing supporting information on their grant applications. Airport officials said there are no special reporting requirements nor any additional funding for airports designated Air Service Development Zones. Airport and local officials at the three locations designated in 2002 through 2004 said they did not know the criteria for being selected as an Air Service Development Zone or they were unclear on why their airports were selected. Upon selection, all three airports met with DOT staff to further clarify what the program entails. Officials from one airport said that DOT suggested the airport come up with ideas for how to use the designation, which could serve as a model for other communities. Another airport official told us that DOT offered to introduce the airport to other federal agencies as part of the designation. However another official said that other federal agencies, including FAA, do not \"recognize\" the designation as providing any special status for the airport. DOT officials said all of the requirements of other agencies, including DOT agencies, still apply to the airport and community. According to one local official, this makes the designation ineffective in fostering economic development. All three communities told us that the Air Service Development Zone designation has neither positive nor negative effects on the airport, because it has done nothing to either help or hurt them. The officials from all three airports noted that receiving the designation initially provided some positive local publicity for the airport, but that was the only effect they could name. Community and airport officials told us that any actual economic development that has been created at or near the airport would have occurred without the Air Service Development Zone designation. Conclusions Our review of completed Small Community Air Service Development Program grants to date found that they had a mixed record of meeting program goals. The projects we reviewed included both instances where grantees were able to develop self-sustained air service and cases where this was not achieved. However, given that relatively few Small Community Air Service Development Program projects have been completed thus far (23 completed grants of the 157 awarded grants, or about 15 percent, as of September 30, 2005), it was too early for us to assess the overall effectiveness of the grants in improving air service to small communities. Examining the effectiveness of this program when more projects are complete would allow the evaluation of whether additional or improved air service was not only obtained but whether it continues after the grant support has expired. This may be particularly important since our work on the limited number of completed projects found that only about half of the grantees reported that the improvements were self-sustaining after the grant was complete. In addition, our prior work on the Essential Air Service program found that once incentives are removed, additional air service may be difficult to maintain. Over the next year, an additional 58 projects are scheduled to expire and examining the results from completed grants at that time may provide a clearer picture of the value of this program. Any improved service achieved from this program could then be weighed against the cost to achieve those gains. This information will be important as the Congress considers the reauthorization of this program in 2008. We also found that the Air Service Development Zone concept has had no identifiable effect at any of the three locations designated from 2002 through 2004. The officials at the 3 designated airports remained unclear about what they were supposed to do once designated a development zone. DOT sees this designation as providing an opportunity for the selected community to work with its grant award to stimulate economic development, increase use of the airport's facilities, and create a productive relationship between the community and the federal government to achieve these goals. DOT officials said they are available to help the designees, if they are asked. However, DOT has not developed guidance or a conceptual model for what an Air Service Development Zone should be or what it should accomplish. Without this guidance, DOT advice or direction is limited and the designees may or may not pursue any air service development zone activities. Recommendations for Executive Action To ensure the effectiveness of the Small Community Air Service Development Program, we are making the following two recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation: o The Secretary should conduct an evaluation of the Small Community Air Service Development Program in advance of the program's reauthorization in 2008. Such an evaluation should occur after additional grant projects are complete and include a determination of the extent to which the program is meeting its intended purpose of improving air service to small communities. o The Secretary should clarify what support and services it will provide to communities that are designated as Air Service Development Zones. Agency Comments and Our Evaluation We provided copies of a draft of this report to the Department of Transportation for its review and comment. We received oral comments from DOT officials including the Associate Director, Office of Aviation Analysis. The officials told us that, in general, they concurred with the report's findings and agreed to consider the recommendations as they go forward with the program. DOT also provided clarifying and technical comments, which we incorporated into this report as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional committees and the Secretary of Transportation. We will make copies available to others on request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at h ttp://www.gao.gov.

Dillingham Director, Physical Infrastructure Issues List of Congressional Addressees The Honorable Thad Cochran Chairman The Honorable Robert C. Byrd Ranking Minority Member Committee on Appropriations United States Senate The Honorable Jerry Lewis Chairman The Honorable David Obey Ranking Minority Member Committee on Appropriations House of Representatives The Honorable Peter A. DeFazio House of Representatives Objectives, Scope, and MethodologyAppendix I To determine how the Department of Transportation (DOT) has implemented the Small Community Air Service Development Grant Program, we obtained and reviewed legislation authorizing and funding the program as well as related orders and guidelines. We interviewed DOT officials regarding their grant review and selection process as well as the procedures they use to oversee and monitor grant implementation. We reviewed grant proposals and award information and information about how DOT used grant criteria to review grant applications and award grants. We reviewed program controls to understand DOT's program oversight and monitoring. We also reviewed quarterly reports and final reports grantees submitted. We obtained and reviewed DOT financial data from the Office of the Secretary and from the Federal Aviation Administration. Based on our understanding of the data through discussions with knowledgeable agency officials, as well as checks for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To determine what strategies have been used and what results have been obtained, we reviewed the grant applications and agreements for all 157 grants awarded from 2002 through 2005. We classified the types of strategies carried out within the program and summarized the types of activities funded. In addition, we conducted site visits at each of the 10 grantees that had completed their projects as of December 31, 2004. This included Charleston, WV; Daytona Beach, FL; Fort Smith, AR; Hailey, ID; Lynchburg, VA; Mobile, AL; Reading, PA; Scottsbluff, NE; Somerset, KY; and Taos, NM. We interviewed airlines associated with these completed grants to obtain information on air service trends at small community airports and the Small Community Air Service Development Program. Airlines interviewed include American Eagle Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, TransStates Airlines, US Airways, Horizon Airlines, Rio Grande Air, and Westward Airways. We contacted 13 additional airports that completed their grants by September 30, 2005, to obtain basic information on the outcome of their grant. We also interviewed selected aviation consultants that had prepared grant applications to obtain information on air service trends at small community airports and the Small Community Air Service Development Program. Aviation consultants interviewed include Wilbur Smith Associates, Vesta Rae and Associates, and Intervistas. In addition, we conducted two Web-based surveys. We sent surveys to the 146 airport directors involved in the 122 grants awarded by DOT from 2002 through 2004. We sent a different survey to the 116 airport directors who applied for but did not receive a grant. For both surveys, we sent the survey to the airport directors or managers who were knowledgeable about the grant that was received or, in the case of the nongrantees, were knowledgeable about the grant proposal. To determine the airports that were included in the grant award, we reviewed the grant applications, information on the grants from DOT, and information from the grantees. To determine the airport directors who applied for but did not receive a grant, we reviewed the grant proposal documents from the DOT docket and information on the applications from DOT. We did not include airports smaller than a nonhub airport (as defined in 1997) in the nongrantee survey because they did not have scheduled commercial service. Each survey asked a combination of questions that allowed for open-ended and closed-ended responses. The survey to airports that received the grant included questions about (1) the intended goals of the project, (2) project elements, (3) assessments of DOT's implementation of the grant program, (4) results obtained under the project, and (5) recent trends that have affected air service at the airport. The survey to airports that did not receive the grant included questions about (1) the intended goals of the project, (2) project elements, (3) assessments of DOT's implementation of the grant program, and (4) recent trends that have affected air service at the airport. For both surveys, a GAO survey specialist designed the questionnaires in conjunction with other GAO staff knowledgeable about the grant program. In addition, we pretested the grantee questionnaire with three communities that had received fiscal year 2002 grants. We also had two aviation experts review the grantee questionnaire and provide comments. We pretested the nongrantee questionnaire with three other communities that had applied for, but did not receive, grants for each of the fiscal year 2002 through 2004 periods. During the pretests for each questionnaire, we asked whether the questions were understandable and if the information was feasible to collect. We refined each of the questionnaires as appropriate. Both surveys were conducted using self-administered electronic questionnaires posted to the World Wide Web. For the grantee survey, we sent email notifications to 146 airport managers and directors beginning on March 2, 2005. We then sent each potential respondent a unique password and username on March 8, 2005, by email to ensure that only members of the target population could participate in the survey. To encourage respondents to complete the questionnaire, we sent an email message to prompt each nonrespondent each week after the initial email message for approximately 3 weeks. We closed the survey on April 18, 2005. Because of the location and nature of the two grants awarded to the Aleutians East Borough islands in Alaska, we did not send surveys to each airport included in the grants. Instead, we asked that the legal sponsor of the grants complete a single survey for each of the two grants awarded. For those questions in the survey that specifically pertain to the airports involved in the grants, we asked that the sponsor respond for any of the airports in that grant for that specific grant year. We received 121 completed surveys, a response rate of 83 percent. To view our survey and airport directors' responses, go to www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-06-101SP. The nongrantee surveys were also conducted using self-administered electronic questionnaires posted to the World Wide Web. For this survey, we sent email notifications to 116 airport managers and directors beginning on April 12, 2005. We then sent each potential respondent a unique password and username on April 14, 2005, by email to ensure that only members of the target population could participate in the survey. To encourage respondents to complete the questionnaire, we sent an email message to prompt each nonrespondent each week after the initial email message for approximately 3 weeks. We closed the survey on May 18, 2005. There was an application from two airports in Hawaii. Because both airports had the same airport director, we sent him only one survey. We received 83 completed surveys, a response rate of 72 percent. We removed two airport directors from the respondent list because their airports were included in a proposal submitted by a representative of the state DOT without the airports' knowledge. Therefore, the airport directors did not have sufficient information to complete the survey. To view our survey and airport directors' responses, go to www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-06-101SP. Because these were not sample surveys, there are no sampling errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how the data are entered into a database or were analyzed, can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps in the development of the questionnaires, data collection, and the data analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors. For example, social science survey specialists designed the questionnaires in collaboration with GAO staff with subject matter expertise. Then, as mentioned earlier, the draft questionnaire was pretested with appropriate officials to ensure that the questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend. When the data were analyzed, a second, independent analyst checked all computer programs. Since these were Web-based surveys, respondents entered their answers directly into the electronic questionnaires. This eliminated the need to have the data keyed into a database thus removing an additional source of error. We also called a random sample of 20 small hub and nonhub airport directors or managers as categorized in 1997. We selected our sample from a total of 206 small and nonhub airports we determined had never applied for a grant. We called the 20 airport directors to ask them why they had not applied. The sample was stratified by FAA region and airport size. While we did not attempt to project these results to all airports that did not apply for grants, the sample provided some useful observations on the types of reasons airports had for not applying. To determine how passenger traffic and air service have changed at the nation's small community airports, we conducted a literature review of aviation trends, focusing on studies that describe overall trends at small community airports (small hubs and nonhubs) in terms of the number of scheduled flights and destinations, available seats on scheduled flights, and scheduled flights by aircraft type. We narrowed our criteria to analyses contained in published studies and reports in the past 5 years. We reviewed each of the studies meeting our criteria and determined that the studies were methodologically sound. As an additional assessment of the reliability of the studies' findings, we considered the reliability of the underlying data that were used in the studies and reports. Where noted in the study, we considered the steps that the study authors took to determine if the data used in their analyses were sufficiently reliable for their purposes. For example, much of the published data are from DOT's Office of the Inspector General who periodically reports to the Congress on small community air service. The Inspector General's reports on aviation trends relied on data from various sources. The data that we cited primarily came from the Federal Aviation Administration's Flight Schedule Data System, which derives from the Official Airline Guide Schedules Database. While the Inspector General did not systematically audit or validate the databases they used in their report, they conducted trend analyses and sporadic checks of the data to assess reasonableness and comprehensiveness. When their judgmental sampling identified anomalies or apparent limitations in the data, they discussed these irregularities with managers responsible for maintaining the data. Additionally, we made use of BACK Aviation Solutions, a private contractor that uses the Official Airline Guide Schedules Database and the Federal Aviation Administration Aerospace Forecasts, which is based on the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics data on passenger traffic and fleet type. We recently issued a report and assessed the reliability of BACK's and DOT's data.1 Based on (1) reviews of documentation from BACK Aviation Solutions and DOT about their data and the systems that produced them and (2) interviews with knowledgeable agency and company officials, we found the information to be sufficiently reliable for these types of analyses. On the basis of our review of the methodologies cited in the studies, together with the authors' statements concerning steps they took to assess the reliability of the underlying data along with our previous data reliability assessments of BACK Aviation Solutions and DOT databases, we concluded that the studies' analyses were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We performed our work from September 2004 through October 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Factors Affecting Air Service to Small CommunitiesAppendix II Air service to nonhub airports has generally declined in recent years, as measured by the number of departure flights. Nonhubs have had an overall decrease in departures since July 2000. While all airports showed a decrease in service from July 2001 to July 2003 scheduled departures at small, medium, and large hub airports have increased since 2003. By July 2005, scheduled departures at small, medium, and large hub airports largely rebounded, with departures from large and small hubs exceeding the July 2000 number. However, the decline of service at nonhub airports continued, with 17 percent fewer departure flights serving these airports in July 2005 compared with July 2000. Many factors may help explain why some small communities face relatively limited air service.1 First, many network carriers have cut service to small communities while carriers face financial difficulties and restructure their operations. Regional carriers now operate at small communities where network carriers have withdrawn. Second, regional carriers are phasing out turboprops in favor of regional jets, which has had a negative effect on small communities that have not generated the passenger levels needed to support regional jet service. Third, the \"Commuter Rule\" that FAA enacted in 1997 might have also had an effect. This rule was intended to bring small commuter aircraft operated under the same safety standards as larger aircraft.2 This change created challenges for small communities because it is more difficult to economically operate smaller aircraft such as 19-seat turboprops under the new safety requirements. In addition, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act instituted the same security requirements for the screening of passengers for smaller airports as it did for larger airports, creating a \"hassle factor\" for passengers.3 Fourth, low cost carriers have emerged in the deregulated environment, but these airlines have generally avoided small communities, leading to the phenomenon of \"leakage\"-that is, passengers choosing to drive to a larger airport instead of the small community airport. According to industry consultants, low cost carriers are now looking at medium-sized markets to expand, which could result in further reduction of air service at small community airports. Network Carrier Restructuring and Downsizing Negatively Affect Service to Small Communities The financial condition of network carriers has negatively affected service to small communities, especially those served by nonhubs.4 We have reported that in response to the economic downturn begun in early 2001 and the events of September 11, 2001, many network carriers have been undertaking major restructuring and downsizing of their operations.5 A regional airline association official noted that as part of restructuring, network carriers have transferred routes to regional carriers or reduced air service to certain communities.6 According to an industry association, network carriers have also discontinued some service at major hubs, which can, in turn, reduce service to small communities. Flights to small communities have been cut because they are often considered to be less profitable than other routes. Aircraft Changes at Small Communities Pose Challenges According to aviation consultants, turboprops have been the primary source of airline service to small communities, and in particular nonhubs, because turboprops have been the most economically viable for small communities. However, turboprop use is declining. According to one aviation consultancy, from 1995 to 2005, the number of nonstop routes served by turboprops declined 54 percent. According to the FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years 2005-2016, the trend is for further decline.7 By 2016, FAA expects that 10-40 seat turboprop aircraft will represent 13.3 percent of the fleet, down from 22.8 percent in 2004. According to FAA, the primary reason for the decline in turboprops has been the rise of the use of regional jets at small community airports. According to the DOT Office of the Inspector General, the number of regional jet flights at nonhubs has increased 199 percent from July 2000 to July 2005.8 In comparison, flights by other types of aircraft have declined-by 29 percent for large jets, 39 percent for turboprops, and 17 percent for piston aircraft. The increased use of regional jets at small communities is in line with national trends at larger airports. The FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years 2005-2016 states that jet departures by regional air carriers accounted for 65.8 percent of industry departures in 2004 compared with just 0.2 percent in 1991. According to an aviation consultant, increased use of regional jets, which tend to have 50 seats or more, makes it more difficult for small communities to fill the aircraft. Thus, according to an aviation consultant, regional jets have not been a direct substitution for turboprops on routes; rather, regional jets may fly to denser passenger markets where they can profitably operate. Another trend that might negatively affect service to small communities is that some airlines have been procuring more 70 and 90 seat aircraft. According to the FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years 2005-2016, because the larger aircraft allow for longer flight lengths, new markets may be tapped for point-to-point service that will by-pass congested hub airports. We have reported in the past that small communities may have particular difficulty attracting regional jet service because their passenger demand could not support it.9 In addition, an aviation consultant and industry airline association official both stated that scope clauses in labor agreements between regional and network carriers can constrain regional airlines in the aircraft size, routes, and airports served.10 For example, the aviation consultant said clause requirements that jets be used on certain routes have led to the retirement of turboprops even where turboprop service had been profitable. The \"Commuter Rule\" Has Contributed to Loss of Air Service to Some Small Communities In 1997, the FAA enacted the \"Commuter Rule\" that called for \"one level of safety\" among all commercial aircraft and placed stringent safety standards on regional carriers. The intent was to bring aircraft that have 10 to 30 seats and operate scheduled service under the same safety standards as network carriers that operate with larger aircraft. The additional costs required to meet the increased safety standards made some smaller aircraft uneconomical to operate. According to industry association officials and an aviation consultant, the safety upgrades have contributed to eliminating the 19-seat plane because of the increased operating costs. According to the FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years 2005-2016, in 1998, 1 year after the implementation of the Commuter Rule, the number of city pairs serviced by the regional or commuter carriers fell to its lowest level of the decade. Although the trend reversed in 1999 as more regional jets entered the fleet, the number of short-haul markets under 200 miles continued to decline. Furthermore, between 2001 and 2004, 456 city pairs in the 0-199 mile range and 248 in the 200-499 mile range lost nonstop regional or commuter service. Taking into account city pairs that gained service, the overall result was a net loss of 184 city pairs in the 0-199 mile range and 90 in the 200-499 mile range. FAA told us that part of this decline may be due to the Commuter Rule.11 Small community airports are required to meet the same security standards as larger airports, which can be costly for small community airports and create a \"hassle factor\" for passengers. According to an aviation consultant, with the rise in increased security measures at airports, many in the traveling public have opted to drive or take trains or buses to travel in the post 9/11 era. Consumers believe that with the increased time it takes to pass through security, they would be better off using another method of transportation to go to their final destination. Increase in Low Cost Carrier Service May Also Contribute to Reduced Service at Small Community Airports Low-cost carriers such as Southwest and JetBlue, provide point-to-point service in dense population markets with limited access to low fares, and in recent years this model has been relatively successful. According to the FAA Aerospace Forecast Fiscal Years 2005-2016, since 2000, network carriers have reduced their domestic capacity by 14.3 percent, while low cost carriers have increased capacity by 40.5 percent. Low-cost carriers generally avoid nonhub airports where demand for their point-to-point service is insufficient to make it economically feasible to serve with their fleets of larger aircraft. According to the Department of Transportation Office of the Inspector General, low-cost carriers scheduled service to only 5 of the more than 500 nonhub airports in July 2005, representing approximately 2 percent of the total available passenger seats at these airports. An aviation consultant stated that only the six large network carriers pay attention to small community air service. Low-cost carriers provide a challenge to small communities. Neighboring larger airports that have low cost carrier service are attracting passengers from smaller airports, a phenomenon called leakage. We have reported this as a critical factor determining a community's demand for air service.12 During interviews with aviation consultants and during an industry conference, this issue was noted as one of the most significant challenges to bringing and maintaining air se"
