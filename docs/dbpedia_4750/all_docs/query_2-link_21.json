        "text": "By Joe Kucinski -\n\nYou may be sitting in coach, but your 911 GT3 RS airport shuttle screams first class.\n\nImagine this scenario. You are flying into Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) where you have two hours to change planes before you can head to your final destination in Honolulu, Hawaii. But due to bad weather your arrival time at LAX keeps getting pushed back. You stare at your Porsche Design watch. A sense of panic washes over you as you realize that your layover window is shrinking by the minute. You are going to have to run out of the plane and sprint to your departure gate if you are going to have any hope of making your connection. Then from your plane seat you spot a brand-new Porsche 911 GT3 RS sitting on the tarmac. You think to yourself, I wonder who that lucky SOB is. Believe it or not, that lucky SOB could be you!\n\nDelta is partnering with Porsche between now and February 26 at LAX. Passengers that have tight connections will be selected at random to be picked up planeside and whisked away in a new 911 GT3 RS. How about that for a change in your fortunes? Imagine the look on your fellow aircraft passengers’ faces when they see this big shot being driven from plane to plane in a $250K+ track ready Porsche super car. That is the ultimate flex. And it won’t cost you a penny.\n\nDelta and Porsche\n\nThe Delta and Porsche relationship is not a new one. In fact, they have been partners for over a decade now. For a two-week period last year Delta had a Porsche 918 Spyder hyper car in use as a shuttle at Atlanta’s Hartsfield Airport. And the company will regularly use a Porsche Cayenne SUV to transport passengers from connecting flights. Kind of a cool perk for flying Delta.\n\n911 GT3 RS\n\nThe 911 GT3 RS really needs no introduction on these pages. The track weapon 911 is fully capable of getting passengers to their connecting flight in the blink of an eye. Of course, the passenger probably wishes the ride would last much longer. Many folks have pointed out the fact that the massive rear wing on the GT3 RS looks a bit ridiculous on a road car. Well, at the airport amongst dozens of jets, that rear wing looks right at home.\n\nBook Now\n\nThe 911 GT3 RS is not only expensive, but it is also extremely difficult to land (sorry about the pun) an allocation for one. So, your best chance of getting any actual seat time in one might be at the Los Angeles International Airport. Who would have thought? But February 26 is almost here. Book your Delta flight to LAX now. And book a connecting flight with the shortest layover you can find to maximize your odds of being selected for the special GT3 RS treatment. If anyone has been lucky enough to experience this service, please let us know. We would love to hear from you.\n\nPhotos: Porsche\n\nJoin the Rennlist forums!"
