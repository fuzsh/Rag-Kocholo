        "text": "Do I have to check in again for a connecting flight?\n\nPassengers with a connecting flight with PAL can take advantage of the convenient check-through amenity, allowing a one-stop check-in for those originating from any PAL station with connecting flights to any PAL destination. In the case of a connecting flight with a different airline, the baggage will be checked through only if the itinerary is under one ticket. Additional conditions apply for flights with a connection to any domestic destination in Thailand,\n\nNote: It may not be possible to check bags through at Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) for domestic connections to Koh Samui, Khon Kaen, Ubon Ratchatthani, Udon Thani, and Krabi via Thai Airways, Lampang and Sukhothai via Bangkok Airways, and all domestic connections via Thai Smile. For further instructions, please inquire with the check-in agent.\n\nDo I need to collect luggage on a connecting flight?\n\nWhether or not you need to collect your luggage on a connecting flight depends on your itinerary and whether your bags have been checked through to your final destination. If your bags have been checked through, you do not need to collect them during your layover. However, if your bags are not checked through, you must collect them at the layover airport and recheck them for your next flight.\n\nWhen connecting from an international to a domestic flight, it is important to note that even if your bags are checked through, you may still need to collect your luggage at the country's point of entry, have them cleared by customs, and then return them to the baggage assistance desk. The bags will then be transported and loaded onto your connecting domestic flight, depending on the airport. If you have any questions or concerns about this process, the check-in counter agent should be able to assist you.\n\nWhat is the recommended time allowance between connecting flights?\n\nIt depends on the airport and airline and whether your flights are domestic or international. PAL's Minimum Connecting Time (MCT) varies depending on your itinerary. Please refer to the MCT timetable in Philippine airports for details.\n\nDo I need a separate boarding pass for a connecting flight?\n\nIf you are flying with PAL and have a connecting flight, you may be able to obtain all of your boarding passes during your initial check-in. However, please note that PAL can only issue boarding passes for connections with other airlines if those airlines are partners of the IATA Thru Check-in (IATCI) program. If your connecting flight is with an airline not part of the IATA Thru Check-in program, you will need to obtain your boarding pass from them directly.\n\nPartners of the IATA Thru Check-in (IATCI) Program: Air Canada (AC), All Nippon Airways (ANA) (NH), American Airlines (AA), Bangkok Airways (PG), China Airlines (CI), El Al Israel Airlines (LY), Etihad Airways (EY), Flydubai (FZ), Hawaiian Airlines (HA), Jet Airways (9W), Philippine Airlines Express (2P), Qatar Airways (QR), Singapore Airlines (SQ), Sri Lankan Airlines (UL), Swiss International Air Lines (LX), Turkish Airlines (TK), Vietnam Airlines (VN), and WestJet (WS).\n\nWhat is the Minimum Connecting Time?\n\nThe Minimum Connecting Time (MCT) is the shortest time required to allow you to timely connect between two flights. You must allow at least the required MCT or longer in able to timely connect to your flight, provided you connect to your next flight within the day or 24 hours from your arrival. It varies depending on the airport, the airline, and whether your flights are domestic or international. Please refer to the MCT timetable in Philippine airports for details.\n\nHow much baggage is allowed for connecting flights?\n\nThe baggage allowance for connecting flights may vary depending on the airline and the class of service you are flying with. It is recommended that you check the PAL Baggage Allowance and Fees page for information. In the case of connecting flights with other airlines, please check their website or contact them for specific details regarding the baggage allowance policy.\n\nDo you have to go through security again during a layover?\n\nIt depends on the airport and the airline. Some airports require passengers to go through security again during a layover, while others allow passengers to proceed directly to their next flight.\n\nIf my connecting flight departs from a different terminal at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, what are my transportation options for traveling to that terminal?\n\nIf both of your flights are with PAL or part of a single-ticket itinerary with another airline, we provide a shuttle transfer between NAIA terminals 1 and 2, as well as for those connecting from Terminal 1 to Terminal 3 on PAL codeshare flights. However, if your flights are with a different airline under a separate ticket, you may take MIAA’s free shuttle service or other transportation option to move between the terminals.\n\nHow do you board a connecting flight?\n\nTo board a connecting flight, you should refer to the gate information printed on your boarding pass, which will direct you to the designated gate for your flight. Follow the instructions and proceed to the indicated gate for your connecting flight. Make sure you are also in the correct terminal for airports with different terminals.\n\nIs it necessary to adhere to an airport’s travel rules and regulations when connecting to a certain destination?\n\nPassengers are generally not required to present additional requirements or documents if they remain inside the airport during a layover to connect to another international destination. However, it is important to note that some airports may have specific requirements for transiting passengers, such as complying with immigration, health, and security regulations that apply to the country or region you are traveling to. Some airports may require additional documentation, such as a transit visa, to be presented upon arrival. It is crucial to stay informed about any changes in travel policies or restrictions that may affect your travel plans. We strongly advise checking the government website of the country you will be connecting to or the website of the concerned airport to ensure compliance with all requirements.\n\nWhat happens if I miss my connecting flight?\n\nIf your itinerary is under one ticket, and if you miss your connecting flight due to reasons beyond your control, such as a delay on your first flight, the airline may rebook you on the next available flight to your destination. However, if you miss your connecting flight due to your own fault, such as arriving late at the gate, PAL may charge a fee to rebook you on a later flight.\n\nHow do I find my connecting gate at the airport?\n\nYou can find your connecting gate by checking the airport’s flight information display screens, which typically display gate numbers and departure times for all flights. Alternatively, you can ask for assistance from airport staff or follow directional signs to the appropriate gate.\n\nCan I leave the airport during a layover at a Philippine Airport?\n\nYes, you may be able to leave the airport during a layover, depending on the length of your layover and the visa requirements of the country you are visiting. However, it is important to factor in the time it takes to clear immigration and security when planning to leave the airport.\n\nDo I need to re-clear customs during a layover?\n\nThis depends on the country and airport you are connecting to. In some cases, you may need to clear customs during a layover if you are entering a new country. However, if you are connecting within the same country, you may not need to go through customs again.\n\nWhen connecting from an international to a domestic flight, it is important to note that even if your bags are checked through, you may still need to collect your luggage at the country's point of entry, have them cleared by customs, and then return them to the baggage assistance desk. The bags will then be transported and loaded onto your connecting domestic flight, depending on the airport. Please inquire directly with the check-in counter agent for details.\n\nCan I book a hotel for my layover?\n\nWhether or not you can book a hotel for your layover depends on the specific airport where you will have your layover. If the airport permits it, you may be able to book a hotel, especially if your layover is more than a few hours. Numerous airports have hotels or lounges situated within the airport or nearby. Another option is to book a hotel offsite and arrange transportation to and from the airport.\n\nIs there food or shopping available during a layover?\n\nYes, most airports have a variety of dining and shopping options available for passengers during a layover. The availability of food and shopping options may vary depending on the airport and the time of day.\n\nWhat happens if my connecting flight is canceled?\n\nIn the event that your connecting flight is cancelled and all of your flights are with PAL, you may be offered the option to rebook on the next available flight to your destination or receive a refund for the affected portion of your journey. If your connecting flight is with another airline, it is advised to approach their ground staff or contact them directly. You can also check the flight information display screens for updates on alternative flights or compensation options.\n\nWhat happens if I do not show up for my connecting flight with PAL?\n\nTickets should be used in sequence as stated in the Conditions of Carriage that governs the terms of your ticket. If you do not show up for a flight (your “Missed Flight”) with connecting and/or returning flights, these onward or return flights will be automatically canceled.\n\nAs such, the “No-Show Downline” Cancellation is an automatic cancellation of your return or onward booking once the Missed Flight is tagged as “Non-User” or “No-Show” at the airport.\n\nYou may go to No-Show Downline Cancellation to learn more about this."
