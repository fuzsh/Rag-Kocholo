        "text": "Welcome back to my first actual travel series on here. As the rest of the year is somewhat difficult for me in terms of finding time for a vacation, and that my last stay in the USA was cut short abruptly for reasons everybody is sick and tired of hearing from by now, the decision where to go was made very quickly. That the only other attractive goal for my trip - Japan - is still closed off to the world as I'm writing these lines, and the US lifted their immigration ban for Schengen area inhabitants last fall made the decision even more easy to make.\n\nI had specific reasons for choosing the first three stops of my little tour of the United States but Houston was more or less chosen because it was expedient. Speaking of expediency, this was also part of the reason why I chose the airlines I chose for this trip. Trip times were good and the prices too. For American Airlines, I was even able to use some travel credit leftover from 2020. Plus, I had wanted to try Delta's long-haul product for some time now and the opportunity was there. The routing for my vacation this year is as follows:\n\nThis part is about the second flight of the series, my connecting flight from New York JFK to Washington DCA, after I had come in from Frankfurt earlier that day. Actually, that this routing was possible was part of the decision why I chose Delta for this flight, as Reagan National is just so much more convenient in terms of getting downtown compared to Dulles or even Baltimore (also marketed as \"Washington\" by some airlines, including Delta). This report, I think, is going to be shorter than usual. First because this is a short flight in which nothing really happens, and second because I wasn't feeling too well after getting up much earlier than normal and having been thoroughly tossed about by substantial turbulences on my way from Germany. I hope you'll enjoy it anyways!\n\nThe parking lot - a.k.a. JFK terminal 2\n\nTerminal 2's Airtrain terminal is not actually located in the terminal, as one would expect, but in a parking area. One has to walk along and then across a road first.\n\nFrom the road crossing, I could see this plane. If I'm not mistaken, this is my plane from the flight from Frankfurt! (If you haven't already, be sure to check out that flight report here).\n\nThe interior of Terminal 2 is actually pretty small. Judging from its size, it could be some random small town airport somewhere. Here, however, it is just one tiny portion of a very big airport, serving only Delta domestic flights.\n\nAfter waiting for about 5 minutes, security was done and I was airside. The security personell, by the way, must have been the most unfriendly I've encountered in the US so far. And that does mean something.\n\nThe selection of shops and eateries in the gate area is limited, but still fine. There were also multiple restrooms. The one I visited was adequately sized and decently clean. The apron before Terminal 2 was mainly full of Delta regional and other jets, with the odd exception here and there. Photo 4 of the gallery below shows today's E175SC. The SC version is unique as it was constructed specificly to meet US regional airlines' scope clauses, lowering operating costs for planes with less than 70 seats.\n\nToday's ship: N216JQ, an Embraer 175LR (SC), operated for Delta Connection since its delivery in February 2009 (13 years old).\n\nWhile it was first operated by Shuttle America, ownership was transfered to Republic Airways, who have operated this aircraft since, in January of 2017.\n\n(All info courtesy of Planespotters.com)\n\nOnboard Experience\n\nLooking at my Delta app at the gate area to find out how full the flight was, I noticed that the marker that highlighted my seat in the seat map was gone. Instead, it had been placed at seat 8A, a window seat in Comfort+! (Probably no surprise for those of you who saw the cover photo). Really nice of Delta to choose me (a Skymiles member but with no status, and not a doctor or PhD either) for that upgrade.\n\nThe question now really is: Would I recommend choosing this kind of seat for the regular extra fee of 35â‚¬ (approx. $40)?\n\nAnd even though it doesn't look like it, the flight was full, and I there were quite a few unlucky standby candidates, if I have understood the announcements correctly. By the way, the screen showing the standby and upgrade lists were broken at this gate at that time.\n\nBoarding commenced on time and went on pretty efficiently.\n\nThe seat itself was alright. The quilting pattern certainly looks elegant but does not add to the comfort of the seat at all. Also, the headrest was not moveable or foldable (as you would expect on a regional flight). What really sets this seat apart from the usual Main Cabin seats is the small extra pocket on the seatback in front of you and, more importantly, a few inches more legroom. Seatguru says that the seats in Comfort+ are spaced apart by 34 inches. However, I wasn't impressed that much (disclaimer: I don't know how tight the seats are in Main Cabin, as I've never tried that on that type of plane).\n\nAnother, more funny thing - in case you know of my window seat curse, or in other words to choose rows with obstructed or otherwise suboptimal views. This time, the seat wasn't my choicec, and the view was top notch. (However, it rained a bit down in New York, and in general the window was filthy).\n\nIn each seat pocket was a safety card, which I found to be especially quirky. First, Delta's patriotism doesn't only seem to extend to the US - but also to Brazil.\n\nSecond (but that's actually more of an Embraer quirk perhaps): There aren't life vests on this plane. The seat cushions act as flotation devices.\n\nEven better, there doesn't even seem to be a place on a life raft for every passenger in case of a full plane being forced to perform a water landing (closely look at the drawings below).\n\nAs the safety card was made for both E170 and E175, there is basically no way for the non avgeek public to see if there actually are life rafts in the rear of the plane or not. The crew made an announcement on the ground that today's plane was an E175, but I think we all know how closely people tend to listen to these announcementsâ€¦ Also, the crew described themselves as being \"Columbus Ohio based,\" which I found interesting as I've never heard that kind of announcement before.\n\nPushback for the planned 4pm departure time took place at 4:02. The captain made an announcement shortly afterwards, stating that the flight time today would be a mere 56 minutes. I was curious how it would play out in the end, as shortly after activating my US sim card in New York, I received a push message warning of severe weather along the East Coast.\n\nRandom JFK taxi photosâ€¦\n\nThere was quite a line forming before runway 31L. About four planes were before us, and it was stop and go for roughly 20 minutes because two more planes were joining our line shortly before the runway.\n\nTakeoff waiting line airplane galoreâ€¦\n\nFinally takeoff time. Please excuse the bad quality of the photos due to the dirty window.\n\nBecause of the intense sunshine, pretty much everyone closed their window blinds even before takeoff, creating sort of an artificial night. SO that's basically it for photos of the scenery before the final approach (during which many people still didn't open their blinds, and the crew didn't seem to care). There wouldn't have been much to see out of the portside windows, anyways, as we were flying past the Jersey shore above the Atlantic for most of the journey.\n\nInflight service consisted of these small water bottles. The cabin crew made several rounds distributing these and collecting trash, so you could have multiple bottles, if you wanted to.\n\nThe free wifi did work on this flight, and I was able to send and receive Whatsapp text messages. Also, the wifi network gave me access to some flight information such as a map of today's route (albeit with a missing background, showing just a line moving between two points) and altitude. Thumbs up for that!\n\nApproach into Washington & DCA AIrport\n\nAfter cruising along at about 26000 feet for most of the trip, we curved towards the East and made our approach into Washington Reagan National Airport. Once the descent had commenced, the air become increasingly rough again. Touchdown itself was very smooth, which was quite surprising considering I almost thought we were going to do a go-around.\n\nEnjoy the least bad photos I was able to take during the approach and the landing.\n\nReaching our arrival gateâ€¦\n\nDeplaning followed quickly and took place via a jetbridge. In no time I found myself in the airside concourse of DCA's Terminal B.\n\nGetting to the baggage claim area was straightforward. A short walk later, I arrived at the belts, finding that my suitcase was one of the first coming out."
