        "text": "American Airlines is adding two more destinations through its partnership with mobility provider Landline at Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), including its first \"flights\" to Wilmington Airport (ILG) in Delaware.\n\nLandline, which operates \"flights\" via a bus, will connect American's hub at PHL to Wilkes-Barre Scranton International Airport (AVP) in Pennsylvania on Aug. 6 and ILG on Oct. 7, the company said Friday. Landline will offer four daily round trips to AVP and six daily round trips to ILG.\n\n\"We are pleased to expand our innovative partnership with Landline,\" Joe Sottile, director of short-haul network planning at American, said in a statement. \"This new service will provide local residents access to American's global network, including convenient one-stop service to more than 100 destinations around the world via our Philadelphia hub.\"\n\nFinally, like a flight: American improves Landline bus connections via Philadelphia\n\nAnd yes, the new Landline services will depart AVP and ILG inside security (or \"airside\") and arrive at PHL at a gate on Concourse F. Travelers can then connect to other flights without needing to re-clear security at the hub.\n\nWith the two new routes, Landline will serve four airports for American from PHL: Atlantic City International Airport (ACY) in New Jersey; Lehigh Valley International Airport (ABE) near Allentown, Pennsylvania; AVP; and ILG. Service to Lancaster Airport (LNS) in Pennsylvania ends June 5.\n\nThe expansion comes at a time of significant change for the regional airline industry. Pilot costs rose dramatically during the coronavirus pandemic, and the number of 50-seat regional jets that serve small cities like Wilkes-Barre and Scranton continues to shrink in favor of larger models. The result is fewer commercial flights will be available between hubs and many smaller cities across the U.S., including Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, and Allentown.\n\nMap watching: The award for 'sexiest new route' of the year goes to ...\n\nAmerican flew between Philadelphia and both Allentown, and Wilkes-Barre and Scranton with 50-seat regional jets through 2020, according to Cirium Diio schedules. Both routes were suspended early in the pandemic.\n\nLandline's sell to airlines is that they can provide a level of service comparable to what \"customers would expect from the first-class cabin of a regional jet\" frequently and at a dramatically lower cost. The company's buses are outfitted with just 35 seats in a two-by-one layout with power outlets at every seat and free Wi-Fi.\n\n\"The market opportunity here is a set of cities that are too close to your hub to fly to cost-effectively but, more importantly, are full of people driving themselves to the airport,\" Landline CEO and co-founder David Sunde said on the Time on Wing Podcast in April. The company pitches its product as ideal for markets up to 200 miles from a hub.\n\nAVP is 125 miles from PHL while ILG is about 27 miles away from the American hub, according to Google Maps. American's scheduled \"flights\" to the former will take roughly 2 hours and 20 minutes, and the ones to the latter will take about 50 minutes.\n\nConnect by â€¦ bus?!?: Report from Sun Country's first Landline bus connection\n\nAir Canada, Sun Country Airlines, and United Airlines also have partnerships with Landline. The company operates \"flights\" to small cities from five hubs across the U.S. and Canada for its four partners.\n\nIn addition to departing and arriving inside security and offering various onboard comforts, travelers on American's Landline buses can also check bags at their departure airport through to their destination like they would on any other American itinerary. They can also earn and redeem American Airlines AAdvantage Loyalty Points on Landline.\n\n\"Being able to start your trip from [the Wilkes-Barre and Scranton area] and connect through Philadelphia alleviates some of the stress when starting your travel from a larger airport,\" said Carl Beardsley Jr., executive director of AVP.\n\nRelated reading:"
