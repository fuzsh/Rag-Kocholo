        "text": "Passengers arriving to SFO on an international flight (with the exception of precleared international flights) and connecting to an onward flight:\n\nMust complete U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) entry procedures in the Federal Inspection Area. For more information, visit U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nExit the Arrivals Hall. Onward passengers should exit the Arrivals Hall through the doors marked \"Connecting Flights\". Passengers may recheck baggage that is tagged to its final destination at the Baggage Desks located outside of the exit. If an agent is not available, or baggage is not tagged to its final destination, passengers should visit their airline's ticket counter.\n\nBaggage Claim: All arriving passengers regardless of their connection status must claim their baggage after immigration, proceed through customs and exit via the connecting flight exit.\n\nBe screened through a security checkpoint to access their next flight. Please visit the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) website for information about the security checkpoint process.\n\nAfter exiting the International Terminal Arrivals Hall, passengers can transfer between terminals by walking or riding AirTrain, SFO's automated terminal transit system. All SFO terminals are connected by both pre and post-security walkways. After being cleared through a security checkpoint, passengers can walk to any gate.\n\nPrecleared International Flights\n\nPassengers arriving to SFO on international flights that have been precleared are not required to undergo the federal inspection process upon arrival. Passengers will disembark into the post-security area of the terminals. All SFO terminals are connected and passengers can walk to their next gate.\n\nDomestic Arrivals Connecting to an International Flight\n\nPost-security connectors are available between all of SFO's terminals. Passengers arriving on a domestic flight can walk to their next gate without exiting and re-entering security.\n\nPassengers not checked in for their onward flight should visit their airline's ticket counter in the International Terminal Main Hall (please note: Air Canada is in Terminal 2)."
