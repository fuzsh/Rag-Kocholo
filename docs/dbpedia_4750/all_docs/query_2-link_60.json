        "text": "Some transatlantic flights require you to catch a connecting flight between LGA/EWR and JFK. Fortunately Delta provides free — FREE — ground transportation between their connecting flights between JFK and LGA/EWR. Let’s look at Rule 30 (GROUND TRANSFER SERVICE), subsection 1 in Delta’s Contract of Carriage.\n\n(THIS ARTICLE FROM 2013 is NO LONGER VALID – DELTA DOES NOT PROVIDE THIS ANYMORE).\n\nRULE 30 GROUND TRANSFER SERVICE\n\nA) GENERAL\n\nExcept as otherwise specified below, Delta does not operate or provide ground transfer service between airports or between airports and city centers. Any such service is performed by independent operators who are not and shall not be deemed to be agents or servants of Delta. Although Delta may assist you in making arrangements for such ground transfer service, you agree that Delta is not liable for any act or omission of any such independent operator. If we issue you a voucher to cover the cost of services provided by any such independent contractor and you decide not to use the services, the voucher for such services will have not refund value.\n\nEXCEPTIONS:\n\nExcept for passengers traveling on award tickets or free tickets, Delta will provide ground transfer services at no additional charge in the following circumstances:\n\n1). Transatlantic Flights — New York area airports\n\nDelta or Delta Connection passengers making connections between LaGuardia Airport (LGA) or Newark International Airport (EWR) and John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to or from Delta transatlantic flights will be provided ground transportation between JFK airport and LGA/EWR airports at no additional charge, if the passenger’s connecting flight is scheduled to depart the same calendar day of the scheduled arrival of the passenger’s flight at LGA/EWR/JFK airports. Both the arriving and departing flights to/from JFK/LGA/EWR must be on the same ticket.\n\nAs long as your connecting Delta transatlantic flight is departing the same calendar day as your scheduled arrival, Delta will provide free ground transportation between JFK and LGA/EWR.\n\nExample\n\nIf you have the following itinerary, you’ll get free transportation between airports: Ann Arbor – New York (LGA) then onward from New York (JFK) – London. The reverse itinerary would also get you free transportation. An easy free ride!\n\nHow does this actually work?\n\nThe process is pretty painless. When you arrive at the airport, visit the Delta Baggage Office. There, you will show the agent your boarding pass where it should indicate your connecting flight (the arriving flight must be on the same ticket). The agent will call a car service and hand you a voucher for the ground transportation. The car service will contact you to let you know when they have arrived. (In the meantime, if you haven’t done so, before heading to the Baggage Office you should claim any bags you have checked). The car service will drive you to the airport in which you need to catch your connecting flight. You just have to hand the driver the ground transportation voucher. That’s it.\n\nSome Caveats\n\nThe voucher covers only the ground transportation fare. Tips are not included in the voucher; That is still within your discretion.\n\nIf you have checked bags, Delta will NOT claim them for you. You must claim your own checked luggage from baggage claim, bring it to car service, and check your bags in when you arrive at the airport for your connecting flight.\n\nAccording to the rule, free ground transportation is not available for those traveling on award tickets or free tickets.\n\nBoth the arriving and departing flights to and from JFK/LGA/EWR must be on the same ticket.\n\nRemember\n\nYou must set aside enough time to claim any checked bags you have at arrival and enough time to travel to the second airport. We recommend planning for about 2 hours if you are traveling between LGA and JFK and for about 3 hours between EWR and JFK. Add an additional 45 minutes on top of that if you have checked bags.\n\n=====\n\nTo make sure you receive our latest deals, LIKE our The Flight Deal Facebook Page, follow us on Twitter @TheFlightDeal, or subscribe to The Flight Deal RSS Feed or Subscribe via Email (Once a Day)\n\nThe Flight Deal does not sell travel products or services.
