This depends on the process at the airport where your connection takes place.\n\nThrough tickets\n\nIf you have booked a through ticket, in most cases you can have your bag through checked to your final destination. The check in agent can confirm the process to you at check in, please ask us and we'll be happy to help.\n\nNote: a through ticket means you have one ticket number containing all the flights in your itinerary, which are usually booked at the same time.\n\nSeparate tickets\n\nYour bag will not be checked through to your destination if you hold separate tickets. In this case, your bags will be checked through to the destination of your first ticket. Note: separate tickets means you have a separate ticket number for each flight in your itinerary. These are usually booked separately from each other at different times.\n\nOther reasons why your bag will not be checked through to your destination\n\n· There is a break in your journey exceeding 12 hours\n\n· Your onward flight is not confirmed\n\n· There is no baggage transfer facility at the stop over airport"
