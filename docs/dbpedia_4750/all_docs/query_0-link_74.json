        "text": "Airline advances strategy of balancing network for increased stability through economic cycles with addition of 15 new routes to the world's fastest growing economies in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East Increased connectivity between domestic hubs beginning January 2009 improves customers' access to destinations worldwide\n\nATLANTA, Nov. 12, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) today announced it is adding 15 new international routes for summer 2009, including service to 12 destinations not flown by any other U.S. carrier. The addition of trans-Pacific, trans-Atlantic and African routes advances Delta's strategy of taking customers to more unique destinations across the globe and investing in underserved markets.\n\n\"As America's flag carrier to the world, offering service to more destinations than any other airline is an advantage our customers count on. Furthermore, smart growth to unique and emerging markets across the globe is a key ingredient of Delta's proven business strategy,\" said Glen Hauenstein, executive vice president of Network Planning and Revenue Management. \"Delta continues to hone a distinct and strategic global network that capitalizes on new opportunities created by our recent merger with Northwest; our leading position in New York -- the world's largest business market; and the unparalleled connectivity of Atlanta -- the world's largest passenger hub.\n\n\"In the current atmosphere of international financial uncertainty, the breadth of Delta's network positions the airline to take advantage of markets that continue to thrive, while offering a natural hedge where there is economic softness,\" added Hauenstein.\n\nDelta's long-haul expansion for 2009 will be focused in three regions:\n\n* Trans-Pacific: Delta plans to add three new nonstop trans-Pacific flights between the United States and Tokyo-Narita, Japan, including new nonstop flights from Salt Lake City(1,3) and New York- JFK(1), a second daily flight from Atlanta(1,3), and daily service connecting customers beyond Tokyo to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam(1,3). * Africa: Delta will expand its industry-leading position in Africa with new flights between Atlanta and Nairobi, Kenya(1) and Cape Town, South Africa(1,5) (via Dakar, Senegal); between Atlanta and Monrovia, Liberia(1); Abuja, Nigeria(1); Luanda, Angola(1); and Malabo, Equatorial Guinea(1) (all via Sal Island, Cape Verde); and between New York-JFK and Lagos, Nigeria(1). Delta also will introduce its first daily nonstop service to South Africa with flights between Atlanta and Johannesburg(1,2). * Europe/Middle East: Delta will expand its leading position across the Atlantic with the only nonstop flights operated to Gothenberg, Sweden(1) and Valencia, Spain(1), both from New York-JFK. Delta also will expand its service at New York-JFK with nonstop service to Prague, Czech Republic(1) and Zurich, Switzerland (seasonal); as well as the addition of a second nonstop flight between New York- JFK and Tel Aviv(1).\n\nTaking advantage of new opportunities created by its recent merger with Northwest, Delta's proposed new flights between Atlanta, Salt Lake City and New York and its hub at Tokyo-Narita open service to nine of Asia's top 20 markets not served by Delta prior to the combination, including a new flight to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Delta's flight between Salt Lake City and Tokyo-Narita is the first and only trans-Pacific service from the Rocky Mountain region.\n\n\"Through the merger, Delta is able to unleash the power of the Tokyo hub by connecting it to the largest U.S. domestic network with new flights from Atlanta, New York and Salt Lake City feeding intra-Asian routes with greater trans-Pacific capacity,\" said Hauenstein.\n\nThese flights are in addition to new trans-Pacific service previously announced by Northwest Airlines, including daily nonstop flights between Seattle and Beijing(3) beginning March 1, 2009 and nonstop service connecting Detroit and Shanghai(3), effective March 28, 2009.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, Delta's 2009 growth focuses on underserved markets with high growth rates and robust traffic patterns that have historically been difficult to reach from the United States. With the addition of nonstop service to Gothenberg, Sweden(1) and Valencia, Spain(1), Delta will offer customers service to 13 European destinations not flown by any other U.S. airline. As part of its successful joint venture with Air France, Delta also recently announced new nonstop flights connecting Raleigh-Durham, N.C. and Pittsburgh to Air France's hub at Paris Charles de Gaulle International Airport(1), effective June 2009.\n\nIn 2009, Delta expects to remain the only U.S. carrier flying nonstop to Africa and is building on its success since inaugurating service there in 2006. For customers, more nonstop service to Africa from the United States eliminates lengthy connections through Europe, trimming several hours off average travel times.\n\n\"Traffic between the United States and Africa is projected to grow more than 5 percent annually through 2027,\" said Hauenstein. \"With demand for travel to Africa spread across the United States, Delta is uniquely positioned to collect this growing base of traffic through the world's largest passenger hub in Atlanta, as well as via the top U.S. market in New York to fly customers direct to 12 of Africa's top destinations.\"\n\nIncreased U.S. hub-to-hub capacity improves connectivity\n\nTo prepare for the summer 2009 schedule, Delta in January will increase connectivity between its U.S. hubs to improve customers' connections to the world. Overall, Delta will offer 14.5 percent more capacity between Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Salt Lake City, New York and Memphis in January 2009 compared with the year prior.\n\nHub-to-hub changes include replacing select regional jet flights with mainline equipment connecting Atlanta to Memphis, Minneapolis and Detroit. Delta also will add a third daily flight between Salt Lake City and Detroit; new daily service between Salt Lake City and Memphis; and new daily service connecting New York-JFK and Memphis.\n\n\"Improving the connectivity of every Delta hub builds a stronger platform to take customers from all over the United States to destinations around the globe,\" Hauenstein said. \"Each Delta hub has a unique role in the new Delta network, and we will continue to invest in the infrastructure to make each hub successful and ensure it is conveniently connected to the world.\"\n\nDelta also continues to roll out customer benefits as it integrates with Northwest. Effective Jan. 5, 2009, customers can take advantage of full Delta-Northwest codeshare reciprocity on flights between Delta hubs, creating thousands of additional connecting opportunities. Delta will launch a fully consolidated worldwide flight schedule in advance of summer 2009.\n\nDelta's new international service beginning summer 2009 includes:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------- Region Route Effective Aircraft Frequency --------------------------------------------------------------------- Trans-Pacific New York-JFK to June 4, 2009 Boeing daily Tokyo-Narita, 777-200ER Japan(1) ------------------------------------------------------- Salt Lake City to June 3, 2009 Airbus five times Tokyo-Narita, 330-200 weekly Japan(1,3) ------------------------------------------------------- Atlanta to Tokyo May 4, 2009 Boeing daily Narita, Japan(1,3) 747-400 (second frequency) ------------------------------------------------------- Tokyo-Narita, June 1, 2009 Boeing daily Japan to Ho Chi 757-200 Minh City, Vietnam(1,3) --------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa Atlanta to June 1, 2009 Boeing daily Johannesburg, 777-200LR South Africa(1,2) ------------------------------------------------------- Atlanta to June 2, 2009 Boeing four times Nairobi, Kenya 767-300ER weekly (1,5) ------------------------------------------------------- Atlanta to June 8, 2009 Boeing once Monrovia, Liberia 757-200ER weekly (1,4) ------------------------------------------------------- Atlanta to Abuja, June 10, 2009 Boeing twice Nigeria(1,4) 757-200ER weekly ------------------------------------------------------- Atlanta to Luanda, June 14, 2009 Boeing twice Angola(1,4) 757-200ER weekly ------------------------------------------------------- Atlanta to Malabo, June 16, 2009 Boeing once Equatorial Guinea 757-200ER weekly (1,4) ------------------------------------------------------- Atlanta to Cape June 1, 2009 Boeing three Town, South Africa 767-300ER times (1,5) weekly ------------------------------------------------------- New York-JFK to June 9, 2009 Boeing five times Lagos, Nigeria(1) 767-300ER weekly --------------------------------------------------------------------- Europe/ Middle East New York-JFK to June 11, 2009 Boeing four times Gothenberg, Sweden 757-200ER weekly ------------------------------------------------------- New York-JFK to June 18, 2009 Boeing three Prague, Czech 767-300 times Republic(1) weekly ------------------------------------------------------- New York-JFK to June 5, 2009 Boeing four times Valencia, Spain(1) 757-200ER weekly ------------------------------------------------------- New York-JFK to June 8, 2009 Boeing daily Zurich, 757-200ER (seasonal) Switzerland ------------------------------------------------------- New York-JFK to June 30, 2009 Boeing four times Tel Aviv(1) 767-300ER weekly (second frequency) --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.
