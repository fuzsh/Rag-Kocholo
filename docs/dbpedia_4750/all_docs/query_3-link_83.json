        "text": "In support of the Port Authority’s efforts to accommodate the ongoing rebuilding of LaGuardia Airport in New York, Delta will consolidate its New York-LGA operation in Terminals C and D, a significant step toward constructing Delta’s own state-of-the-art facility at the airport.\n\nBeginning Dec. 9, Delta Shuttle flights to Chicago and Washington, D.C., will relocate from the Marine Air Terminal to Terminal C, where customers will enjoy enhanced amenities while retaining the distinct Delta Shuttle product. Shuttle flights from LaGuardia to Boston already operate from Terminal C.\n\nDelta is one of six airlines to change terminals at the airport later this year. Consolidating carriers’ flight operations will streamline customer travel and make airfield movements more efficient while facilitating the continuation of work to transform the 78-year-old facility into a brand-new airport.\n\n​”Consolidating our operation at LaGuardia is one of the first significant steps toward Delta’s future $3.9 billion, 37-gate facility as the airport moves ahead with its historic redevelopment into a completely rebuilt and unified 21st-century transit hub,” said H​enry Kuykendall, Delta’s Senior Vice President – Airport Operations, Northeast.\n\nDelta has invested more than $2 billion in New York airport infrastructure over the past seven years, in addition to the many other investments the airline is making in the customer experience across its system, including in new cabin interiors, Wi-Fi, free entertainment, onboard food and beverage, biometric and RFID technology and much more.\n\nIn Terminal C, Shuttle customers will have access to dedicated check-in counters; expedited security with Clear, dedicated TSA Precheck lanes, and a Shuttle security line; a 7,600-square-foot Delta Sky Club; and chef-driven restaurants, an expansive food hall, and upscale retail. Shuttle customers will also continue to enjoy:\n\nCheck-in as close as 15 minutes before departure without bags or 30 minutes with checked bags\n\nDedicated gates with access to complimentary coffee and newspapers for all customers\n\nExpedited security screening with access to dedicated TSA Precheck lanes and a Shuttle security line\n\nAdvanced seat selection on all Delta Shuttle flights and complimentary access to Delta Comfort+ seats for SkyMiles Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond Medallion members when available\n\nThree classes of service with complimentary upgrades for SkyMiles Medallion members when available\n\nComplimentary onboard snacks, including breakfast cookies in the morning before 9:45 a.m. or gourmet nut mix for flights after 9:45 a.m.\n\nComplimentary beverages in-flight, including craft beer and wine in all classes of service\n\nComplimentary spirits in First Class and Comfort+; available for purchase in economy\n\nAccess to in-flight Wi-Fi on all Shuttle flights, including free messaging\n\nComplimentary In-Flight Entertainment on your personal device powered by Delta Studio streaming\n\nShuttle flights will continue to be operated by Delta Connection partner Republic Airline using E-170 and E-175 aircraft. Weekday flights to Washington will continue departing near the top of the hour beginning at 6 a.m. with 12 peak-day departures between Washington and New York on the November schedule. Flights to Chicago will continue to depart at 15 minutes past the hour beginning at 6:15 a.m., with 14 peak-day departures between Chicago and New York scheduled for November. Weekday flights to Boston will continue departing near the top of the hour beginning at 6 a.m., with 17 peak-day departures between Boston and New York on the November schedule.\n\nDelta Shuttle service from New York to Boston and Washington, D.C., began on Sept. 1, 1991, after Delta completed the purchase of the Pan Am Shuttle. For more than 25 years, the Delta Shuttle has been a core part of its New York operations. In June 2010, Delta added Shuttle service to Chicago-O’Hare. The Delta Shuttle to Boston Logan International Airport was relocated to Terminal C in 2014."
