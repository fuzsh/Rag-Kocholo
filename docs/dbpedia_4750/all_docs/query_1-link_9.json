        "text": "1925 Huff Daland Dusters, which formed the roots for Delta, founded in Macon, Ga. It was the world's first aerial crop-dusting company. For more information, see Founding.\n\n1945 Delta is first airline to fly living vegetable plants (160,000 tomato plants).\n\n1946 Delta is first airline to fly nonstop Chicago-Miami, initially with Douglas DC-4 planes.\n\n1946 First airline to offer gift certificates for flights.
