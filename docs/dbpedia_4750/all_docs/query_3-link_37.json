        "text": "US Airways made a hostile $8 billion bid for Delta Air Lines on Wednesday, despite Delta's repeated statements it isn't interested in a merger.\n\nUS Airways has received a commitment from Citigroup Inc. to provide $7.2 billion in new financing for the deal, which also would be subject to regulatory, creditor, U.S. Airways shareholder and court approval.\n\nDelta Chief Executive Gerald Grinstein issued a statement saying the carrier would review the proposal, but it would continue to pursue its goal to file its reorganization plan.\n\n\"Delta's plan has always been to emerge from bankruptcy in the first half of 2007 as a strong, standalone carrier,\" Grinstein said.\n\nThe offer to buy Delta - once the Atlanta-based airline emerges from bankruptcy protection by the middle of 2007 - would give Delta's unsecured creditors $4 billion in cash and 78.5 million shares of US Airways stock.\n\nIf the deal is completed, the combined airline would operate under the Delta name and serve more than 350 destinations across five continents. The combined company would divest certain assets, including a shuttle that operates in the Northeast. US Airways also said it would optimize flights at its hubs, but it did not say what further impacts the hubs could face.\n\nUS Airways has hubs in Phoenix, Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C. Delta's hubs are in Atlanta, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City.\n\nTempe, Ariz.-based US Airways has not decided where the combined company would be based.\n\n'No concern' in Savannah\n\nBoth Delta and US Airways operate out of Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport.\n\n\"Whatever happens, I really don't expect any big changes for us,\" said Robert Uhrich, director of air service development for the Savannah airport.\n\n\"US Airways will continue to fly from here to Charlotte and other destinations. Delta will continue flying to Atlanta and other Delta connections.\n\n\"If anything, we may see more service out of Savannah,\" he said.\n\nDelta serves Savannah with nine daily flights to Atlanta, three to NewYork/LaGuardia, two to Cincinnati and one to Boston.\n\nIn addition to daily nonstop flights to Charlotte, US Airways offers Saturday flights to Philadelphia, Washington National, Boston, Pittsburgh and New York/LaGuardia.\n\nAtlanta businessman Marty Hahn was flying home from Savannah on Wednesday.\n\n\"I've flown both airlines, although I'm a pretty loyal Delta flier,\" he said. \"I haven't had the chance to really study the proposal, but I can't imagine it would have any adverse effects on the average airline passenger.\"\n\nKathy Orloski of Allentown, Pa., also was unconcerned.\n\n\"I'm not particularly partial to any airline. I fly US Airways because they operate out of my airport,\" she said, after arriving in Savannah on Wednesday with her husband, Richard.\n\nThe couple was headed to Hilton Head Island, where he was attending a legal seminar.\n\nA merger with Delta would be fine, she said.\n\n\"I'll still fly whatever is least expensive.\"\n\nNo job cuts?\n\nThe offer comes as US Airways and America West are still integrating operations after their combination last year.\n\nThe deal also could cause some headaches for labor groups, said aviation consultant Robert W. Mann.\n\n\"There will be a huge seniority integration problem that will result. It's already problematic after the US Airways-America West merger,\" Mann said. \"This will only increase it fourfold.\"\n\nUS Airways insists the merger ultimately will be good for all concerned.\n\nDoug Parker, chief executive of US Airways, said in an interview he is aware of the comments made by Delta's management in recent months, but he said this is a fair offer and that ultimately Delta's creditors will see that.\n\n\"The (bankruptcy) process is designed so that the creditors get the highest possible value for their clients,\" he said. \"Given that process, what we have done is gone public with an alternative to a standalone plan.\"\n\nThe combination of US Air and Delta would create a company with about $28 billion in annual revenue, leapfrogging the airline past the current No. 1 U.S. carrier, American. The projection is based on revenue figures through the first nine months of 2006. It's unclear how any divestitures would affect a combined Delta-US Airways' revenue.\n\nParker said the combined company would have about 85,000 employees. He said he would anticipate flying with 10 percent fewer planes, but \"the plan is not predicated on any job cuts.\"\n\nMerger mania\n\nThe move could start a stampede of competing bids in a long-predicted industry consolidation.\n\nGrinstein said last month he had received \"feelers\" from UAL Corp.'s United Airlines about a possible merger 18 months ago, but quickly rejected them.\n\nAs for other possible offers, a spokesman for AMR Corp.'s American Airlines said the company was studying the US Airways proposal but had no further comment.\n\nSaid Jake Brace, chief financial officer of United's parent, \"We think consolidation is good for the industry. If it makes sense for us to participate in it, we will.\"\n\nNorthwest spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch declined to comment on the proposed deal. Southwest declined to say whether it would enter the bidding for Delta.\n\nUS Airways, which emerged from bankruptcy and was acquired by America West last year, said the deal is expected to generate $1.65 billion in annual savings from optimization of the airlines' networks and combining facilities in overlap airports.\n\nShares of US Airways Group Inc. closed up $8.57, or nearly 17 percent, to $59.46 on the New York Stock Exchange. Delta Air Lines Inc. shares are traded over the counter.\n\nSavannah Morning News business reporter Mary Carr Mayle contributed to this report.
