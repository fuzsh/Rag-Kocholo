        "text": "Was the 55 minute connection on your original ticket, or due to an involuntary flight change on Delta's part which revised the (original) itinerary and shortened your connection? If the former, then you have to just hope for the best (and be prepared to be put on the next available flight if you miss your connection) OR you can elect to change the ticket with the change fees and difference in price that will be involved. Flights are notoriously late leaving from Chicago (to confirm, look up that flight by flight # on the JFK website to see how often it gets in on-time or late, and how late). If Delta changed your original ticket and the itinerary change is substantial enough, then Delta is obligated to give you a better itinerary without an extra fee (and yes, it will involve reissuing the ticket because it will have a whole new itinerary). So the answer depends on the circumstances of your original ticket.\n\nHere's the connecting info (https://www.jfkairport.com/at-airport/connecting-flights). You're at the mercy of the connecting bus but it will save you time to get to that bus as quickly as you can. You never know. The flight may depart late and you may get lucky. You would be incredibly lucky if Delta changed your ticket for free since it sounds like the itinerary change was insignificant. I wouldn't assume that you'll be seated at the back of the plane. If you can check in even 24 hours in advance, snag seats at the front if possible.\n\nOf course, it goes without saying, but if you can't change your itinerary, then know what Plan B is (when is the next flight out?).\n\nI'm assuming you got the Basic Economy ticket with that price. If you booked the whole flight through Delta, I believe they have to put you on another plane if you miss your connection. I can't for the life of me imagine why Delta would have such a close connection time for an international trip. I agree to keep calling their customer service. Ask them what happens if you don't make that connection if the flight from Chicago is late. Will they hold the plane to Brussels for you? Also see how much it would cost to change the ticket (if they allow it) to a more reasonable connection time. It may be worth it to pay it for the peace of mind. Good luck!!\n\nThe low cost of the ticket, combined with not being able to select seats, would seem to indicate that these are Basic Economy tickets. So, no changes allowed, and they will assign you a seat at check in. The MCT for domestic-international at JFK when changing terminals is 50 minutes, so it's legal, but really tight. As noted above, have a plan B. Research other Delta flights that leave later for other cities in Europe. Write them down, as well as whatever connectors you would need in Europe to get you to your destination. If you do miss your second flight and have to re-book, things go much more smoothly if you can feed the agent what flights you want. And, also as noted, flights are sometimes delayed--good if it's your second flight, bad if it's your first. I wish you the best.\n\nSorry, you chose a tight connection (Yes, they shortened it, but as you said, by a few minutes) to get a heavily discounted ticket in the lowest fare class. I suppose when choosing a ticket, you could have taken a ticket with a leisurely transfer, but it would have cost maybe double, or more. To expect that Delta would change at no cost is a bit unrealistic, basically not their problem. You can be assured that you will still get to Brussels, yes, it could be delayed, but if all goes OK, that is enough time to transfer and very likely you will arrive in NY early. Just accept it and be prepared to move quickly.\n\nYou scored a deal with a $300 RT fare from ORD to BRU. With that price, I assume you booked Basic Economy? If so, no changes are allowed. Still, no worries. One, airlines add some fluff time to their routes in that flights typically can land as scheduled even with a 30 min delay. You may actually land with more than 55 minutes to spare. If not, make your way to your connection at JFK and if you don’t make it, it is on Delta to put you on the next flight. Delta does not want you to miss the flight. If you do miss it, Delta will be obligated to put you on the next available flight with seats. If you get pushed to a later flight, demand access to their sky lounge as the JFK lounge has a nice outdoor bar area. Have a couple drinks and be ready to board the next flight. If, for some reason, the next available seats are the following day, they will owe you hotel and meals. So , you see, it is in Delta’s interest that you make the flight. I suppose if you still are worried about this, I would probably lean towards NOT checking a bag-just in case you miss your connection but your bags don’t.\n\nI had a similar situation last November with Delta. We flew from Phoenix to Minneapolis on our way to London. In Minneapolis we only had 57 minutes for our layover to Heathrow. I also didn’t realize this when I made the tickets so began to panic. When I called Delta I was told there was not much I could do. I decided to just go with it and hope for the best. Luckily our departure gate was right next to our arriving gate and we had no timing issues. Is there a chance that either of your terminals could change and perhaps you’d be closer? I’ve not been to JFK in years so can’t recall what the situation is as far as terminals goes. MSP is also a smaller airport I know. If not, I would just ask to get put on the next flight to your destination. After I experienced this issue I wondered why an airline would make such close departure times. I’m sure this happens more often than we think. I am sure that all will work out well.\n\nI think everyone else has already covered the fact that Basic Economy tickets have some restrictions in exchange for those lower fares. (BTW, that is a GREAT price for RT!!!)\n\nSo, if this is your situation, there are a couple of things which you can do.\n\n--As soon as the flight from Chicago lands at JFK, take your phone off airplane mode and search to see what your connecting gate will be. This is important. You'll want to know which direction you need to go.\n\n--You may want to download the Delta app and register with them in order to take advantage of all the features of their app. Also a frequent flyer number will put you one ahead of anyone with a problem who doesn't have a frequent flyer number with Delta.\n\n--Since you'll probably be in the back, you'll have time to collect your carryon luggage while the front of the plane is exiting. Be prepared to move as soon as you can without running down any other passengers.\n\n--Once you exit the plane, head directly for your next gate. Power walk if you can't run. Do not pause for the bathroom, water fountain, food or any other distraction.\n\nIf you miss the connection through no fault of your own, Delta will put you onto the next flight with available seats. While this certainly isn't plan A, it's good to know that you won't be stranded in JFK and required to purchase more tickets.\n\nOne other thing you might do is inform the flight attendant that you have a very tight connection when you land. Sometimes flight attendants have made announcements requesting passengers to remain seated in order to let a few people at the back of the plane out first because they're going to have to run to make their next flight. There's no guarantee that they'll do this, and there's no guarantee that fellow passengers will be accommodating. But it never hurts to politely ask.\n\nGood luck & have a wonderful trip!!!\n\nFirst, don't be sure you have to change terminals. Gates change all the time. But if they do, there is a free shuttle between terminals. This is airside. Do not try to change terminals by going out and using the Airtrain. By staying airside you do not have to go through security again at JFK.\n\nKnow which gates you need. Terminal 4 is very big and long. The shuttle bus makes two stops. Find which stop is closest to your gate and use it. It should save you time.\n\nThink of this as a lesson learned. You got an ubelievable airfare but in return Delta is offering you nothing extra. The Basic Economy fare is there strictly to compete with the discount airlines. They are making no money off your ticket. (And good luck demanding lounge access on a Basic Economy ticket.)\n\nThanks to everyone for all these suggestions. I think I will try them all. I will probably wait a month and call Delta to see if a terminal has been assigned at JFK, if both arrive and depart from Terminal 4, them no problem. If not, I can again ask for earlier flight out of Chicago or if second flight will wait for us. If declined, I will ask FA if we can deplane early.\n\nIf all fails, we will move as quickly as possible to get to the Delta shuttle to go to terminal 4 without leaving secured area and having looked at a map of JFK prior. If we miss the flight, I will have looked at alternate flights for Delta to put us on.\n\nLesson learned about really looking at connection times!\n\nI haven't experienced the gate check thing in a foreign/connecting flight situation. But as described above, it was a special \"pink tag\" put on my bag, and I had to stop and retrieve it on the jetway when we landed, after the crew unloaded the gate-checked bags from the hold and brought them up to the jetway. It was a regional jet and it didn't take long. But I had to stop to get my bag right there.\n\nI'd be surprised if the airline staff at the gate have access to the bag check system that would allow them to check the bag through to a connecting flight from the gate. AFAIK, \"gate check\" is a separate thing from the regular bag check and bag handling system."
