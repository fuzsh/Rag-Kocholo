        "text": "Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is located in Westchester alongside LA's beach communities about 16 miles from Downtown LA. The airport's West Coast location makes it a gateway to international destinations, particularly Asia and the Pacific.\n\nWith 1,500 average daily flight operations, LAX is the world's fifth busiest airport and the Number One Origin and Destination airport in the world. LAX offers 645 daily commercial flights to 162 destinations, and 1,890 weekly international flights to 68 global destinations.\n\nFor reference, an interactive terminal map with airlines, restaurants and shopping is available from Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA).\n\nAs LAX ramps up work on its $15-billion modernization program, the airport has launched LAX-it, a convenient, amenity-rich, centralized area for guests to pick up a taxi or rideshare app service, and avoid traffic in the Central Terminal Area (CTA). Opened in October 2019, LAX-it will remain in service until the Automated People Mover opens in 2024. LAX-it will only be for pickups - rideshare app and taxi drivers will continue to drop off passengers at the terminal curbs on the Upper/Departures Level.\n\nLAX-it is located just east of Terminal 1, at the corner of World Way and Sky Way - it's a short walk from many terminals or accessible via a dedicated shuttle. LAX-it reimagines the pickup process for taxis, Uber, Lyft and Opoli with additional amenities such as restrooms, benches, umbrellas for sun and rain protection, and local food trucks. LAX-it also offers cellphone charging stations and Wi-Fi. Dedicated staff at LAX-it will provide passenger assistance and lane management on site.\n\nThe shuttles operate in a dedicated lane on the lower/arrivals level where they won't compete with other airport traffic and will take guests from any terminal to the new pickup area. Shuttles come every 7 minutes during peak hours. They will make a maximum of 2 stops before heading to LAX-it. Wait by the green LAX-it bus stop signs.\n\nLAX is open 24 hours. Airline check-in counters and federal passenger security screening are open between 4 a.m. to 5 a.m. and closed between 11:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m., Pacific Time, depending upon flight schedules for each terminal.\n\nThere are nine passenger terminals at LAX, connected by a U-shaped, two-level roadway. Inter-terminal connections between Tom Bradley and Terminals 4-8 are all connected by walkway, allowing connecting passengers to access the above-mentioned terminals without having to re-clear security. Bus service is available between Terminal 2 and Terminal B.\n\nThe new Terminal 1.5 opened to the public in February 2022, connecting Terminals 1-3 via an airside walkway so that post-security passengers can walk between the terminals. The $2.3 billion Delta Sky Way at LAX project is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2023 with a post-security connector bridge from Terminal 3 to TBIT.\n\nFor more info about Inter-Terminal Connections, visit the LAX website."
