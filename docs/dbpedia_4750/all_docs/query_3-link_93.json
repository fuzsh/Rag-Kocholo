        "text": "The Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) is a public agency formed by Contra Costa voters in 1988 to manage the county’s transportation sales tax program and oversee countywide transportation planning efforts. With a staff of twenty people managing a multibillion-dollar suite of projects and programs, CCTA is responsible for planning, funding and delivering critical transportation infrastructure projects and programs that connect our communities, foster a strong economy, increase sustainability, and safely and efficiently get people where they need to go. CCTA also serves as the county’s designated Congestion Management Agency, responsible for putting programs in place to keep traffic levels manageable. More information about CCTA is available at ccta.net.\n\nIn April 2023 the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) unveiled its PRESTO shared autonomous vehicle, the Bay Area’s first autonomous shuttle open to the public. The PRESTO shuttle will run through fall 2024 to provide free, electric shuttles to four key destinations within Bishop Ranch in San Ramon, California. CCTA’s groundbreaking program is available to the community Monday through Friday from 7:30am – 5:30pm.\n\nThe shuttle pilot is funded in part by an $8 million grant award from the Federal Highway Administration’s Advanced Transportation and Congestion Management Technologies Deployment program. To operate this first phase of PRESTO, CCTA partnered with Beep, which specializes in testing autonomous shuttles to create and manage stress-free and self-sufficient autonomous mobility solutions. More information on how to use the shuttles can be found at ridePRESTO.com.\n\nPRESTO at Bishop Ranch is CCTA’s new suite of mobility options that is aimed to include bike share, scooter share, and express bus service in addition to autonomous shuttles. CCTA’s innovative PRESTO program is aimed to prepare the Bay Area for the future of transportation and increase transit options for all, including transportation-challenged and underserved communities in Contra Costa County."
