Delta Air Lines and US Airways announced on Wednesday that they would swap a number of takeoff and landing slots at La Guardia Airport and Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington.

Delta said it would create a domestic hub at La Guardia, and some industry analysts said the deal would make Delta more of a powerhouse in New York and US Airways more of a powerhouse at Reagan.

Both airlines said they would continue their shuttle flights from La Guardia to Washington and Boston. But the shuttles would trade terminals at La Guardia once the deal is completed. The Delta shuttles, which now originate from the Marine Air Terminal at La Guardia, would move to the Delta terminal at the other end of the airport. US Airways would take over the Marine Air Terminal.

Delta, which currently has 16 gates at La Guardia handling 148 departures a day, said it would have 27 gates and 272 daily departures after the deal is completed. It said that it expected to double the number of destinations to which it flies from La Guardia and that it would add service to more than a dozen cities that US Airways has not served from La Guardia. Delta would not name the cities.

US Airways said it would operate up to 72 flights a day from La Guardia, about two-thirds fewer than it currently operates. It said that besides the shuttles, it would fly from La Guardia to two cities in North Carolina  Charlotte, one of its major hubs, and Wilmington  and two in Pennsylvania  Philadelphia, also a major hub, and Pittsburgh.

US Airways said that it would add 15 new destinations from Reagan National, including 8 that currently have no daily nonstop service from that airport.

The deal is structured in terms of slot pairs, which refer to one takeoff and one landing  in effect, a round-trip flight. US Airways would transfer 125 slot pairs at La Guardia to Delta, and Delta would turn over 42 slot pairs at Reagan Airport to US Airways. US Airways would also get Delta’s slots at airports in Tokyo and São Paulo, Brazil.

Delta said that it would fly jets in every La Guardia slot in which US Airways now flies smaller turboprop aircraft. A Delta senior vice president, Gail Grimmett, told Delta employees in a memo that the new arrangement would bring more than two million additional passengers a year to La Guardia “without adding congestion or increasing the total number of takeoffs and landings.” That is because Delta’s regional jets can carry more passengers than US Airways’ turboprops.

US Airways said it was discontinuing service to 26 destinations from La Guardia that have been served by US Airways Express. It said it would eliminate 300 jobs at its wholly owned regional carrier Piedmont as a result.

The airlines said the deal must be approved by the Justice Department, the Federal Aviation Administration and the federal Transportation Department.

“Delta has really stolen a march on the battle for New York,” said Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst in Port Washington, N.Y. He predicted that Delta’s presence at La Guardia and at Kennedy Airport could eclipse Continental Airlines’ dominance of Newark Liberty International Airport.

The deal was hailed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. David A. Paterson. Both noted that Delta planned to spend $40 million on construction at La Guardia, tying the US Airways terminal to the Delta terminal.

“This decision by Delta is a real vote of confidence in the future of our city,” the mayor said.
