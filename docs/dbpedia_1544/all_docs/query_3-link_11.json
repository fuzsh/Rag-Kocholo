        "text": "According to whatisit.com, “A Golden Source is a single, well-defined version of all the data entities in an organizational ecosystem.” A Golden Source is also recognised as the \"single version of the truth,\" (SVOT) where \"truth\" means the key reference to which data users can turn when they want to ensure that they have the correct version of a piece of information. The Golden Source encompasses all the data in every system of record (SOR), or the authoritative source within a particular organization.\n\nTo expand, a SOR is an information storage and retrieval system (ISRS), with a built-in interface collecting and cataloguing data so that it may be located and displayed on request. The ISRS serves as the authoritative source for a particular data element in a system which contains multiple sources of the same element. To ensure data integrity, a single SOR must always exist for each and every data element.\n\nIndeed, well-maintained Golden Source Data is fundamental for every enterprise. The SVOT is based on a distributed synchronised database, which stores all an organisation’s data in a consistent and non-redundant form.\n\nThe theory of the Golden Source are traditionally seen as the point where data is either created or first input into a system, a ‘point of origin’ (PoO) for an organisation. What is needed is a Source of Truth (SoT) for non-financial data; that is timely and evidenced.\n\nSustainability/Non-Financial Data\n\nNot only should all organisation’s data be stored in a consistent and non-redundant form, from source, thus the Golden Source, but should non-financial data also be seen as an organisation, or at least an ecosystem? All granular non-financial data on a global, local, initiative and individual level, should be collected in a consistent and non-redundant form; which can be used to support the delivery of sustainability as highlighted by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently there are many organisations and entities claiming that they gather “the” single source sustainability or ESG data, clearly, not one point of origin. Therefore, it should be argued that the identification and establishment of Source of Truth of sustainability elements should be the laudable goal for non-financial, sustainable, impact and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data.\n\nWhat is being shouted from the mountain tops to the boardrooms is that ESG, sustainability, and impact data lacks standardisation, consistency and is prone to gaming as well as green-washing. What is the solution to tracking the lineage of the data, identifying (quickly) ownership of the data and data control checks with provenance? A Source of Truth (SOT). A source of transparent data for an investor or standard collecting body is needed as well as for organisations.\n\nDeveloping a SoT is the first step, a trusted data source that gives a complete or holistic picture of the data. An Authoritative Data Source is the distribution hub for sustainable, impact and ESG information, which draws from all of the Goldens Sources, which is needed to deliver “the” version of the truth that investors, consultants and international organisations can draw. The data must be trusted and fresh and available at a level of granularity that allows users to easily assess the level of impact of the players. At this moment, this Authoritative Data Source is missing. Currently, a variety of proprietary surveys are used to gather data to attempt to identify how well an organisation or initiative, or country is addressing sustainability; this myriad of data sources add to the cacophony highlighting the lack of standardisation.\n\nThe answer is an Authoritative Data Source based on Golden Source Data logged on a distributed ledger (DLT), which guarantees a replica of all sustainability data with clarity on who owns the data, who logged the data and what is the evidence (either via geolocation or verified) of each data point. In principle, DLT enables the SVOT by storing data in a consistent form.\n\nData integrity involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. The very structure of the DLT guarantees data integrity by ensuring that digital information is uncorrupted and can only be accessed or modified by those authorized to do so.\n\nWorld Wide Generation (WWG) developed G17Eco to collect and catalogue sustainability data so that all types of non-financial data can be located and displayed on request. The built-in interface, G17Eco, has been developed to be the ISRS for sustainability, ESG and impact data. As mentioned above, ISRS serves as the Authoritative Data Source for a particular data element in a system containing multiple sources of the same element; these elements come from the proliferating surveys that companies are completing. While Investors are using ratings and raw data for their models, the input data is coming from a myriad of data sources; therefore, a solid SVOT is missing.\n\nGenesis of Data\n\nNon-financial data, where this data comes from, is not so easily answered. Trying to identify a single data source for sustainability, impact and ESG data is the reason why there is a cry for standardisation. There are essentially three challenges:\n\nIn all cases, there is no single system of sustainability, impact and ESG data set. Definitions are different, measurement is varied, with various pieces of data stored in different systems in different units. To add another level of challenge is the faux perception that data sets are complete, when those who use the data decry the patchiness of the current data sets.\n\nWork is still being done, but in some cases, similar data with similar attributes are held on different systems, but the values are different and there is no “effective” way to determine which one is accurate.\n\nAs an extension, there is no way to identify which source data, held on which system truly represents “good”.\n\nMultiple players use multiple standards. The expectations is to clearly identify all standards and develop a single system to access all of the various standards. A single system that also collects the data and disseminates it in a timely basis.\n\nCASE STUDY: Duplicate Records\n\nIn the last twenty years there has been a proliferation of surveys that are near enough to each other to be essentially duplicates. From GRI to CDP to BLabs to Dow Jones RobecoSAM - all of these organisations are trying to identify ‘sustainable’ companies and their activities.\n\nA very simple example, you are a company who has had guidance from the board to align the business around sustainability. All of your competitors are doing it and your investors are demanding that you are more transparent with ESG risks and opportunities.\n\nThe company has researched the number of industry and ESG standards in the market and have decided to answer one survey. It has been estimated that answering and establishing internal processes to deliver the data to the various surveys costs the company 2 full man years of work. Despite the best efforts of the company, the investors ask further ESG or sustainability questions, all slightly different. And there are certainly one or more investors, or stakeholders that wish the company to answer another survey - a survey that may be nearly identical as the first, but have a slightly different skew on the questions.\n\nThe survey suppliers and investors are repeating themselves. And the process is taking much longer and is more expensive than the company (or board envisioned). The reason? There is no standardisation of questions or investor queries. They are all trying to determine the same thing: how sustainable or ESG effective the company is, but each questionnaire take their own tact.\n\nWhen building sustainability and ESG databases from a myriad of sources; the issue of duplication looms large. Whether resulting from incomplete data entries, incomplete publicly available data, changes that occur over time to the surveys or a variety of other reasons, this is a significant issue for any company and investor that relies on vast volumes of information.\n\nTo note, if we were to expand the survey example to include hundreds of thousands of surveys and informational needs, the overhead of duplication explodes exponentially, with every process draining an increasing volume of resources. If we manage to compile a single source, however – the “Authoritative Data Source” – every process becomes infinitely more efficient, there can be more sustainability and ESG coverage, and leveraging of the data is at our fingertips.\n\nThe solution is clear, first, identify every data source that feeds into the universal sustainability and ESG universe. Then, consider which international standards are the most reliable depending on their source, region and issue coverage. Finally, define the criteria that will determine what sustainability looks like and how the data from one source should overwrite conflicting data from a secondary source in our system.\n\nInevitably, problems still arise with data quality. But the will is there to create an Authoritative Data Source based on internal company Golden Source, identifying data that is supported and fresh, with a minimum of mistakes and overlap, in order to facilitate good decisions and effective strategy for investors and companies in supporting the delivery of the SDGs.\n\nWorld Wide Generation\n\nMoving from a system of record to a source of truth. World Wide Generation (WWG) aims is to be the Authoritative Data Source for the distribution of sustainable, impact and ESG; thereby, delivery a SOT for these datasets built on a DLT.\n\nGood and consistent data drives good decisions: the value of good decision and the cost of a bad decision; especially in investments. To deliver the SDGs, data is more than an operational necessity, it is strategic and can lead to effective investment, key legislation and fully informed business decisions. WWG is dedicated to collecting consistent, and usable data, standardising the current patchwork of ESG, sustainable and impact data and disseminating fresh trusted data in a timely manner to make smarter decisions that support the successful delivery of the SDGs.\n\nG17Eco essentially solves the challenges.\n\nit gathers all of the surveys in one place. It does not add another system, but gathers all of the questions from all of the systems in one place, transparently with evidence using the DLT, essentially standardising the data\n\nThrough the collecting of data, identification of duplication, mistakes and gauging of accuracy can be done if the data is held in one place.\n\nData held in one place, from one Authoritative Data Source, what is ‘good’ for each industry at a granularity can be identified and consistently disseminated.\n\nWWG, via its G17Eco Platform is uniquely placed to be the Authoritative Data Source housing sustainability and non-financial data ‘single version of the truth’ and ‘information storage and retrieval system,’ fulfilling every Golden Source through the use of DLT."
