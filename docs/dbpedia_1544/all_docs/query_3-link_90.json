A large part of your entrepreneurial activity is based on it. The digitization of processes is also virtually impossible without well-maintained master data. This makes thorough master data management all the more important. It helps you consolidate your business-critical data in a central database.\n\nRead more about the benefits and challenges of master data management in this article.\n\nWhat is master data management? Definition and goals\n\nMaster data management (MDM) is all about managing master data. The goal is to store all business-relevant enterprise data in a uniform manner to ensure that an organization's information can be used consistently.\n\nTo do this, you create individual master records for each unit or, ideally, a central data pool for your company information that all connected systems can access. In addition to the static storage of master data, master data management also includes dynamic workflows that map the lifecycle of master data.\n\nThe foundation of master data management is your master data governance. This refers to your company's internal standards and policies that broadly define how you and your employees handle company data. It includes rules for storage as well as defined processes and responsibilities.\n\nThe goal of master data management: single source of truth\n\nBy consolidating all of your company's data and information across systems and departments, you gain a standardized and holistic view of your data. For example, you can find the name, address, vendor number, vendor account, prices, and contracts for each of your suppliers at any time.\n\nWith master data management, you can streamline the flood of information and ultimately create a golden record, also known as a single source of truth. This means you have a central database that provides you with reliable, complete, accurate, and up-to-date information in one place at all times.\n\nMaster data vs. transaction data\n\nMaster data management, as the name implies, deals with the administration of master data. Closely related to master data is transaction data, which a master data management system should ideally also map. Let's take a closer look at the differences.\n\nWhat is master data?\n\nMaster data defines and describes core business units that are critical to the company's success. It is permanently valid or at least remains unchanged over a long period of time. It is stored for the long term and used by all departments.\n\nA distinction can be made between global and local master data. While global master data is the same for the entire company, local master data refers to a limited area of validity, for example, a country.\n\nMaster data represents different units (master data objects), such as people (employees, customers, suppliers), things (products, plants, material) or locations (sites).\n\nWhat is transaction data?\n\nUnlike static master data, transactional data is very dynamic. It changes constantly and is therefore only valid for a limited period of time. In addition, it is usually used by only a few departments. For example, invoice data is primarily a matter for accounting.\n\nTransaction data provides information from transactions, i.e. business processes, and shows developments. It builds on master data.\n\nExamples of transactional data include:\n\nOrders\n\nPurchase orders\n\nInvoices\n\nInventory changes\n\nHow SEW-EURODRIVE achieved an ROI of 336%\n\nForrester Consulting studied the total economic impact of Doxis Intelligent Content Automation at our customer SEW-EURODRIVE.\n\nDiscover the significant findings of this independent study.\n\nDownload the study\n\nAdvantages of master data management\n\nDespite the importance of master data to a company's success, not all companies give master data management the attention it deserves. However, there are a number of key benefits to master data management:\n\n1. Improved data quality\n\nAccurate master data management improves the quality of your company's data. It prevents:\n\nRedundant data records (duplicates)\n\nIncomplete data sets\n\nErrors caused by contradictory and incorrect data\n\nThe use of outdated information\n\nFinally, with professional data management and master data maintenance, you save on regular data cleansing and can instead rely on your databases at all times.\n\n2. More efficient business processes\n\nYou can build efficient business processes on well-maintained basic data and:\n\nPromote data exchange between employees, teams and departments\n\nSimplify data processing in different systems\n\nDefine clear approval processes\n\nReduce lead times\n\nAutomate processes, e.g. purchase-to-pay\n\n3. More transparency\n\nMaster data management leads to greater visibility and control over how information is collected, stored, and shared across your organization.\n\nThis is also important from a compliance point of view, as you can ensure that you and your team comply with any regulations, such as data protection.\n\nMore on compliance management >>\n\n4. Reduced costs\n\nAnother advantage of master data management that should not be underestimated: You save on costs and resources. Instead of maintaining multiple data sources in parallel, you manage your data in one central system. As a result, you can streamline your network architecture, use your storage space more efficiently, and reduce your overall IT operating costs.\n\nThe increased process efficiency also gives you a clear cost advantage in day-to-day operations. Last but not least, you can avoid costly mistakes through compliant master data management.\n\n5. Better decision making\n\nMaster data management gives you a holistic overview and valuable insight into all business-relevant information. When this information is centrally consolidated in one system, you can analyze and evaluate it at any time.\n\nOnly when you have reliable and complete insight into your data can you properly assess the status quo and make the best decisions for the future of your business.\n\nTop 3 challenges in master data management\n\nWhile there are many benefits to master data management, there are also challenges that can be easily overcome with the right software.\n\n1. Data consistency and integrity\n\nData consistency or data integrity is one of the most important information security objectives. It refers to the correctness or “purity” of data as it is stored and used.\n\nCorrect data is characterized by the following properties – it is:\n\ncomplete\n\nintact\n\nconsistent\n\nlogical\n\ntrustworthy\n\nWhy data consistency matters\n\nData consistency is a prerequisite for good data quality, fast data retrieval, smooth processes, and the correct use of information. Inconsistent data can lead to unnecessary extra work or even serious errors with high economic damage.\n\nTwo examples:\n\nYou have stored an incorrect address for a customer, so the invoice does not reach them. This means you have to create and send the invoice again, which delays the process. In the worst case, you have also sent the customer's personal data to the wrong recipient.\n\nYou create a new supplier in your supplier relationship management system. In the process, a typo creeps into the name. In addition, the umlaut is not displayed correctly in the system. Later, you need to access the stored information, and it takes several searches to find the result. Or you do not find the supplier at all and assume that it has not yet been filed and enter the data a second time, resulting in two different records for the same entity.\n\nAn important step in master data management is therefore to define the relevant business units and master data objects precisely in advance, and to establish uniform description criteria. Modern master data management software should also enable you to transfer data automatically rather than manually, and to detect and eliminate errors and redundancies.\n\n2. Data security and protection\n\nMaster data is one of your company's most valuable assets and deserves special protection. Especially if you manage the data in a central system, you should take all necessary technical and organizational precautions to protect it from failure, manipulation, and attacks.\n\nThe goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data at all times. For example, a failure of your master data management system can lead to costly business interruptions. Or you could lose valuable information to a cyber-attack, and sensitive, personal data may fall into the hands of third parties.\n\nA centralized master data management system may seem like a security risk, but it actually provides better overall data protection and security – demonstrably. You can achieve this, for example, by automating the digital archiving, transfer, and disposal of information after the legal retention period of information in accordance with your compliance requirements.\n\n3. Data migration\n\nData migration involves the transfer of data\n\nto another location,\n\nto another format, or\n\nto other systems and applications.\n\nData migration, such as when implementing a new master data management system, is a complex matter. Under no circumstances should the quality and security of the data be compromised, nor should the transfer violate any privacy policies.\n\nAlways create a detailed migration concept to ensure a fast and smooth migration without business disruption.\n\nThe DMS selection guide\n\nLearn what to look for when choosing a document management system.\n\nWe clarify for you:\n\nWhy a DMS can help you work faster, more productively, more efficiently and more securely.\n\nHow to analyze your DMS needs and plan for implementation\n\nWhy documents and processes belong together – with practical examples\n\nHow to find the right DMS for your needs – including checklists\n\nRead whitepaper now\n\nFrequently asked questions about master data management\n\nWhat is master data management?\n\nMaster data management is the process and methodology of storing, managing, and maintaining master data. The goal is to create a single, centralized data source for all business-critical information.\n\nWhat do you do in master data management?\n\nThe main tasks in master data management are to verify the implementation of data governance, develop data definitions, and ensure data security and high data quality.\n\nWhat is master data?\n\nMaster data is long-term, business-critical enterprise data that remains unchanged and valid over a long period of time or permanently. Examples include product master data, employee master data, and customer master data.\n\nWhat is transaction data?\n\nTransaction data builds on master data and contains information about transactions, such as purchase orders, orders, and invoices. It is highly dynamic, constantly changing, and therefore only valid for a limited period of time.\n\nWhy is master data important?\n\nMaster data forms the basis of your operational processes and, ultimately, your company's success. Only if you maintain your master data well can you perform reliable business analysis and make important decisions for your company.\n\nShare post:"
