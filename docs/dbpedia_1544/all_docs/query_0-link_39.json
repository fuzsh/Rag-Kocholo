        "text": "Technology spotlight: Platform-driven business\n\nAs organisations consider the platform-driven model, it is important to have a good understanding of some of the key underpinning technologies. These are highlighted below according to three stages of technology evolution: emerging, experimental and established.\n\nEmerging technologies\n\nMoving platforms to the cloud must incorporate a strong security posture. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), sometimes called Sassy, will soon become an established design principle of platform operations.\n\nChaos engineering — the process of testing a distributed computing system to ensure that it can withstand unexpected disruptions — is the differentiator between services built for resiliency or not.\n\nEnvironmental operations will be the intersection between sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors associated with the platforms — for example, which organisational platforms are green and which are not. The combination of financial and environmental business factors will be decision-making points in the platform ecosystems of the future.\n\nExperimental technologies\n\nHyperautomation in platforms using robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing will be able to increase the speed of the process flow within platforms by interacting, translating and understanding data and information as it passes into and through the platform. These technologies will reduce risk, increase speed and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nTo succeed with these technologies, organisations will need to have reached a state of continuous integration and deployment, supported by automated data pipelines. Organisations will need to be able to continuously test and ensure that the code of these new technologies meets the functional and security requirements of the business. A composable architecture will allow the organisation to break platforms down into services that can be contained and integrated through application programming interfaces (APIs), and that are able to support the continuous integration and deployment of tools without impacting other services. There are likely to be significant challenges in achieving this with existing platforms and services.\n\nThe customer experience of any platform is critical to its success; empathising with users of the systems increases adoption. Therefore, employing design thinking as a practice in the design and development of platforms is crucial.\n\nEstablished technologies\n\nEdge computing and internet of things (IoT) are now at the stage of being ready and dependable for platform business strategies.\n\nInfrastructure as code, also dubbed serverless, provides platform business models with the ability to increase speed and infrastructure scaling while reducing risk.\n\nAPIs have already become critical for supporting the composable architectures and microservices of loosely coupled systems, providing the ability to integrate and connect a variety of services through APIs. This also creates the mechanism for organisations to isolate and control services.\n\nAutomated test-driven development, as the name suggests, automates the test cycle to validate and test code at every stage, ensuring organisations have the right code levels at the right standards.\n\nCitizen development through low code and no code application development platforms reduces waste, increases speed and introduces new innovations quickly, often removing workloads from overstretched development teams."
