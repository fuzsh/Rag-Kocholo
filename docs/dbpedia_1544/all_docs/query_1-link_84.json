        "text": "Responsive and adaptive design is used to create websites that work smoothly across multiple devices. Both design techniques provide a better user interface but have many differences.\n\nA responsive design technique that involves designing a website layout adjusts that can adjust to any screen size. This means the website will look and function well on any device, whether a large desktop computer or a mobile phone. Responsive design relies on fluid grids to resize and rearrange the layout based on percentage values.\n\nOn the other hand, adaptive design is a design approach where a website is designed to have multiple layouts. Each layout is optimized for a specific screen size or device type. When users visit the website, it detects their device and displays the appropriate layout. Adaptive design uses fixed layout sizes for specific screen dimensions. This approach requires developers to create multiple layouts that correspond to predefined screen sizes or device capabilities.\n\nA web server is a computer that stores, processes, and delivers website content to browsers. When a user makes a request to the browser, it responds to the requests using HTTP and other protocols.\n\nA web server is a combination of hardware and software. The hardware allows the exchange of data to the devices that make a request, while the software controls how the user can access the stored files.\n\nA static website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and its content does not change every time you access it. When a user requests a page from the server, the server simply sends the HTML files to the user's browser, which displays the content to the user. Examples of static websites include personal blogs, brochure websites, and small business websites.\n\nOn the other hand, dynamic websites are built using server-side programming languages such as Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, or others and often use databases to store and retrieve information.\n\nWhen a user requests a page from a dynamic website, the server runs the necessary code to generate the content for that page and sends it to the user's browser. This allows dynamic websites to display dynamic content to users. Dynamic websites include stock broker websites, social media platforms, content management systems, etc.\n\nRESTful API is a popular choice in web development due to its several beneficial features and design principles that enhance the efficiency and maintainability of web services. Some of these features include Stateless, Scalable and performant, Cacheable, among others.\n\nRESTful API is designed to be stateless, meaning each request sent from the client to the server must contain all necessary information for the server to process it. This prevents the server from having to maintain client state between requests, which simplifies the server's architecture and enhances scalability.\n\nThe stateless nature of RESTful API allows for better load balancing, horizontal scaling, and improved performance, as servers can more easily distribute the workload without the need to coordinate client states.\n\nThe Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is a widely used software architecture pattern in web development. It helps you turn complex software development into three separate components.\n\nModel: This component represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data, performing calculations, and responding to requests from the controller.\n\nView: This component is responsible for the user interface of the application. It displays the data from the model to the users and provides a platform to interact with the application.\n\nController: It is responsible for handling both the Model and View. It manages the flow of the application, including data flow within the Model object and updating the View whenever data is changed.\n\nLong polling is a method used for getting a stable server connection without using protocols such as WebSocket or Server-Side Events. In the conventional client-server model, this method is at the top. In Node.js, the same technique is called the next development model.\n\nThe functioning of this method includes the sending of requests from the client to the server, with the server responding till the connection with new and unique information opens. When the server responds, the client can submit a request to the server. The server returns a query when there is data available. The function takes place when the application of the client and the requests of the server end.\n\nFull-stack Developers need to be proficient in both frontend and backend development. So, a candidate should be well-versed in scripting languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nBesides that, they need to learn at least two or three backend programming languages from C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc. However, many businesses use Node.Js for their development projects, making JavaScript one of the most popular languages.\n\nData security is important to protect sensitive information, maintain trust, comply with regulations, and avoid financial losses. You can take several measures to ensure data security while developing applications.\n\nUse secure coding practices: Develop applications using secure coding practices, such as input validation, access controls, and handling errors.\n\nEncrypt data in transit and at rest: Use encryption to protect data during transmission and when stored in databases. This can help protect against data breaches and unauthorized access.\n\nImplement strong authentication: Use robust authentication techniques to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.\n\nPerform regular security testing: Conduct regular security testing, such as vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, to identify and address potential security risks before they can be exploited.\n\nFollow industry best practices: Following industry best practices, such as instructions provided by the organization and adherence to govt regulations to ensure that your applications are secure, efficient, and sustainable.\n\nUnit testing is a software testing method where developers test individual components or modules. This type of testing is carried out during the development stage. Unit testing aims to identify errors in the smallest unit of code and fix them early in the development process.\n\nOn the contrary, integration testing involves testing multiple units or components together. The purpose of integration testing is to verify if the individual components function correctly when combined together.\n\nLearn more about the key differences between unit testing and integration testing.\n\nThe box model in CSS is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are displayed on a webpage. It comprises four main components: content, padding, border, and margin.\n\nThe content area is the part of the element that holds the text or images. The padding is the space between the content and the border of the element. The border is the line around the padding, and the margin is the space between the border and the outside of the element.\n\nEach of these parts contributes to the total size of the element. You must keep in mind when designing and laying out a webpage.\n\nA senior full-stack developer must have the following skills to build a project from scratch.\n\nFrontend technologies: It includes scripting languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and libraries such as Angular, ReactJS, jQuery, etc.\n\nDesign skill: A good understanding of UX/UI design is important for a full-stack developer.\n\nBackend programming languages: One needs to be familiar with programming languages, such as C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.\n\nFrameworks: Proficiency in frameworks, such as Spring Boot, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc., is essential.\n\nDatabase technologies: A full-stack developer must be skilled in Database Management Systems (DBMS) like MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.\n\nServer: Sound knowledge of servers like Apache or NGINX comes in handy in administering servers.\n\nThe extract function is an inbuilt function in PHP. It is used to import variables into the local table from an array. The symbol table is a data structure that contains all available variables and their values.\n\nIt helps to access array values as individual variables instead of accessing them using the array syntax. However, we should use the extract function carefully, as it can lead to naming conflicts if used incorrectly.\n\nV8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google and based on C++. It implements the JavaScript language according to the ECMAScript specification and provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. V8 engine is used in various applications, including the Google Chrome web browser and the Node.js runtime environment.\n\nThe most important feature of V8 is it is independent of the browser in which it runs. It enabled Node.Js developers to choose the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code on the server side, which led to the popularity of Node.Js.\n\nBacktracking is an algorithmic strategy for solving problems. It uses recursive calling to find a solution by increasing values with time. Backtracking is also considered an upgrade to the brute force approach. We can write algorithms using this technique.\n\nWe apply a backtracking algorithm for some specific problem types.\n\nDecision problem: We use this type to find a feasible solution to the problem.\n\nOptimization problem: We use this to find the best solution for a problem.\n\nEnumeration problem: We try to find all feasible solutions to the problem.\n\nPython is a general-purpose language with a wide range of applications. It has many frameworks and libraries that allow us to develop a wide range of applications. Here are some of the major applications of Python.\n\nPython is a general-purpose language with a wide range of applications. It has many frameworks and libraries that allow us to develop a wide range of applications. Here are some of the major applications of Python.\n\nWeb development (Django, Flask, Pyramid)\n\nData analysis and numeric computing (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy)\n\nMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and SciPy)\n\nNetwork programming (Scapy and Twisted)\n\nAutomation and system administration (Ansible, Fabric)\n\nGame development (Pygame)\n\nGraphical user interface applications (PyQt, wxPython)\n\nThe MVC pattern suggests splitting the code into three components. When developers create a class or file, they should categorize it into one of the three layers: Model, View, and Controller. On the other hand, the MVP pattern is an advanced iteration of software architecture. It is composed of three components: Model, View, and Presenter.\n\nIn the MVC pattern, the controller falls between the view and model layers, but in the case of the MVP pattern, an interface works as a communicator between View-Presenter and Presenter-Model.\n\nThe support for unit testing is limited in the MVC pattern, whereas unit testing is highly supported in the MVP pattern.\n\nAn application server is a specialized software that provides a runtime environment and middleware for running enterprise-level applications. It handles the communication between the user interface, application logic, and data storage layers of an application.It provides the business logic behind any application.\n\nWhen a client first makes a request, it goes to the web server, which sends it to the application server. The application server requests the information from the database server and sends it back to the web server. The web server sends the information to the client.\n\nOptimizing SQL queries means identifying the most effective techniques to enhance SQL query performance. Here are the most effective ways to optimize queries.\n\nIndexing: It helps in accessing the database quickly to find the relevant data.\n\nUse SELECT query instead of SELECT*: Use SELECT query to specify the columns you need instead of SELECT* to avoid unnecessary I/O operations that slow down the query.\n\nAvoid too many JOINs: Use the appropriate JOIN type for your SQL query to ensure you get the desired results and minimize unnecessary processing.\n\nUse subqueries: Using a subquery instead of a JOIN can be more efficient sometimes. If you only need to retrieve data from one table based on data in another, using a subquery can be faster than using a JOIN.\n\nUse table aliases: Table aliases can make your query easier to read and write. Use aliases for tables and columns to make your query more readable.\n\nOptimize database design: Optimize database design by avoiding redundant data and using appropriate data types. A well-designed database can help you improve query performance.\n\nUse Wildcards: Using wildcards helps you search the database for matching results.\n\nBrowsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, etc., may interpret web code differently. As a result, a web page or application that looks and functions correctly in one browser may not work the same way in another. Here are a few tips to handle browser compatibility issues.\n\nUse a CSS Reset: Different browsers have different design layouts, which can cause layout inconsistencies. A CSS reset can help by setting a common baseline for all browsers.\n\nUse cross-browser frameworks and libraries: Cross-browser frameworks and libraries such as jQuery, React, or Angular can help developers avoid browser-specific code and provide a consistent interface across different browsers.\n\nTest on multiple browsers and devices: Developers should test their websites or applications on multiple browsers, including popular ones such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, to check compatibility.\n\nUse polyfills and shims: Polyfills and shims are code snippets that provide fallback functionality for web features not supported by some browsers. You can use libraries like Modernizr, Polyfill. io, or HTML5 Shiv to help fill in gaps in browser support.\n\nStrict mode is a feature in JavaScript that allows us to execute the code in a restricted environment. It helps detect errors in the code that would normally get executed without any errors. We can enable strict mode by adding \"use strict\" at the top of the file or in the required function.\n\nExample:\n\nThe string “use strict” at the top of the file tells the JavaScript interpreter to run the code in strict mode, which enforces stricter syntax and error handling rules. Next, we define a function called myFunction() that multiplies an undeclared variable x by 2 and returns the result. In non-strict mode, this would execute without any issues, but in strict mode, an error will be thrown because x is not declared.\n\nDatabase indexing is like indexing in a book. Just like an index in a book helps us find a particular chapter or information quickly, a database index helps locate the data quickly. It reduces the number of rows or columns to be checked and quickly finds the information you are looking for when a query with a “where” clause is executed. That's how database indexing works.\n\nA filter is a JavaScript function that allows you to apply common text formatting to dynamic data. It doesn't change the data directly but only changes the output to a browser. It takes through value, manipulates it, and displays the processed values.\n\nFilters are applied using the \"pipe character (|) followed by the filter name. We can apply filters in two ways: local and global. Local filters can be used inside the component in which they are defined, whereas global filters can be used in any component.\n\nThe \"this\" operator in JavaScript can be inconsistent because it can have different values based on where it is used. Its value is determined by how the function used is called rather than where it is declared. The value of \"this\" can also be changed using the call, apply, or bind functions making it difficult to predict the value of \"this\" in a given situation, which creates inconsistencies.\n\nA Pascal string is a data structure used to represent and manipulate text strings in some programming languages such as Pascal. In the context of full-stack development, it might not be as prominent as some other string representation methods, but it can still be encountered or used in certain situations.\n\nCommon types of Pascal strings are\n\nCharacter arrays: These are numbers, letters, special characters, etc., enclosed in a single quote.\n\nString variables: The variable of string type is declared inside the var block in Turbo Pascal.\n\nShort strings: We use this string type when the total capacity remains constant.\n\nNull terminated strings: This string type has the same structural layout as a C string.\n\nAnsiStrings: This string type does not have any length limit.\n\nDevOps is a technique that aims to build coordination to streamline software development and IT operations. It enables teams to work together to deliver software products faster and ensure better quality. The primary goal of DevOps is to increase efficiency and reduce errors.\n\nUnder a DevOps model, the development and operations teams are no longer \"siloed.\" Sometimes, the two teams are merged into a single team. The DevOps engineers work across the complete application lifecycle - from development and testing to deployment and operations. These engineers have multidisciplinary skills.\n\nA thread is defined as the single, sequential flow of the control within a program. It is not the program itself and cannot run on its own. In a running program, a thread may have to dig some of its resources.\n\nFor example, the execution stack and program counter must belong to that thread. The code in a given thread is useful only for that particular context. A single thread has a single point of execution, i.e., only one user can manage one request at a time.\n\nMulti-threading is a process that is used to improve CPU performance. Through this process, multiple users can manage the program at the same time, or the same user can manage several requests simultaneously. Multi-threading is achieved by executing several processes that the operating system supports.\n\nFor example, a web browser has multi-threads running simultaneously - while you scroll through a page, you can simultaneously download an application or a document, listen to music, take a print in the background, and more.\n\nThere are three main methods of session management in servlet:\n\nURL Rewriting: It is a session management method in which a unique session ID is added to every URL. When the browser requests a new page, the session ID is sent back to the server. It allows the server to associate the request with a specific session.\n\nHttpSession: It is a built-in interface in Servlet used to store session data on the server side.\n\nCookies: Cookies are data sent by a servlet to a client's browser. The browser saves cookies and sends them back to the server in subsequent requests.\n\nIn synchronous programming, the program execution happens in a sequential and blocking manner. This means the code lines are executed one after the other, and the program has to wait for the current operation to finish before moving on to the next one.\n\nOn the other hand, asynchronous programming refers to a programming model where the program execution happens in a non-blocking and parallel manner. In this model, multiple tasks can run simultaneously, and the execution of one task does not depend on another.\n\nThe event loop is a fundamental part of the JavaScript runtime environment. An event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism that executes tasks in a non-blocking manner. It continuously checks the message queue for new events to process and runs the corresponding event handlers.\n\nIt manages the execution of tasks and events, allowing the runtime to handle asynchronous operations such as network requests and file I/O without blocking the execution of other tasks.\n\nExample:\n\nIt's impossible to completely prevent data scraping if the data within the API is publicly accessible. However, throttling is an effective way to deter bots from scraping a public API. It can prevent a device from making a certain number of requests within a specific time.\n\nMoreover, an HTTP error should be thrown on exceeding a defined number of requests. Apart from this, a good bot detection solution can identify visitors' behavior and automatically block malicious bots that show signs of web scraping.\n\nIn Java, a connection leak refers to a situation where a database connection is not properly closed after it has been used, resulting in the connection being unavailable for reuse by other parts of the application or by other applications. This can lead to a gradual depletion of available connections and eventually cause the application to fail due to a lack of resources.\n\nTo fix a connection leak in Java, you must always close database connections explicitly after use, preferably in a final block, to ensure that the connection is closed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.\n\nJavaScript callback functions can be used synchronously and asynchronously. Callback functions are required because many actions are asynchronous, so they don't block a program or function from running until it is completed.\n\nTo create a callback function in JavaScript, we need to pass it as a parameter to another function and call it back when the task is completed.\n\nExample:\n\nZip() is an inbuilt function in Python that takes iterable (such as lists, arrays, etc.) as input and returns a single iterator of tuples. Each tuple contains the n-th elements from each of the input iterables. The zip function combines elements from each of the iterables.\n\nFor example, if you have two lists [1, 2, 3,...] and [A, B, C,...], the zip function will combine them into a single list [(1, A), (2, B), (3, C),...].\n\nDeadlock is a situation in Java when two or more threads are trying to access the same object. It happens only in the case of multi-threading. We can avoid a deadlock situation by using the following ways.\n\nAvoid nested locks: Avoid giving a lock to multiple threads if we have already given it to one.\n\nUse lock timeouts: We can specify a time for a thread to prevent it from waiting indefinitely for a lock.\n\nAvoid Unnecessary Locks: Using locks unnecessarily can lead to a deadlock, and we should avoid it.\n\nUse lock escalation: Lock escalation helps convert multiple locks into fewer ones, reducing the risk of deadlocks.\n\nOptimistic updates involve immediately updating the client-side state and UI to eflect a user action, assuming the server request will be successful. If the server request fails, the previous state is restored, and the user is notified about the error. Here's how to handle optimistic updates in a web application:\n\nCapture the current state before performing an update.\n\nUpdate the client-side state and UI immediately.\n\nSend the update request to the server.\n\nOn server request success, confirm the update and maintain the client-side state.\n\nOn server request failure, restore the previous state and notify the user about the error.\n\nThis approach can be implemented using tools like Redux or Vuex for state management and can improve the perceived performance and responsiveness of the application."
