        "text": "With financial enterprise software, you need configuration, not customization.\n\nThough our industry has many needs in common, every company requires distinct processes and works on diverse legacy systems. Introducing new technology is a massive challenge.\n\nBecause the GoldenSource data model is built on a rock solid core and augmented over our 30 years in the financial industry, it already has everything our customers need. Configuring it to your data feeds, downstream systems and legacy systems does not require a custom rebuild.\n\nOur team has the expertise and step-by-step process to connect and configure our software to get you operational ASAP.\n\nData has become a strategic business asset, not an operational necessity. Having accurate, consistent data will forever change the way you do business.\n\nCompanies must have an expert team and a proven process to transition to new software. From the first phone call on, expect a fanatical level of support, expertise and a team of problem-solvers.\n\nOur Proven 3-Step Process\n\n1. Diagnostic Evaluation\n\nWe meet with your team to evaluate your needs, current technology and objectives. Then, our team meets to hash out which solution can be utilized to meet those objectives. We debate the issues and look at them from every possible angle. At the end, we achieve a consensus on what we will deliver to the client.\n\nThis is how our proposals are structured.\n\n2. Implementation\n\nWe are perfectionists on execution. We understand time is essential, and most projects are complete within months, not years. We literally are by your side on site to work with your engineers on every step of the configuration, installation, and testing process.\n\nMistakes are costly. The software must be tested over a wide number of company systems and adjusted to perform accurately, quickly and consistently. You work with top level staff who consider themselves as your partner in success.\n\n3. Support\n\nOnce you are up and running, this is not the end, only the beginning. Our global tech support team is here 24/7 when needed. We know seconds matter and we are here for the life of our product.\n\nIf you have a new hire and they need onboarding and training, we are here with support and one-on-one instruction.\n\nThe yardstick for EDM solutions…no product can rival it for breadth and depth.\n\nFinancial-I Jury Report\n\nIntegrating the GoldenSource solution within local banking environments has confirmed its powerful functionalities and considerable flexibility, even in very complex and fast changing contexts.\n\nGiusy Mainardi, Sales and Partner Manager at Corvallis\n\nGoldenSource understands our business requirements and can provide the high-quality reference data management platform we require to enable us to deliver accurate, timely reference data across our organisation.\n\nBusiness CIO, Nordea\n\nThe GoldenSource EDM platform is a leader in its class with some of the world's most sophisticated banks successfully deploying the solution.\n\nOleg Baranov, Managing Partner at Neoflex\n\nStandard Chartered Bank has chosen to partner with GoldenSource because we feel its Securities & Products solution offers the best mix of functionality, architecture and domain expertise. This enables us to offer a superior quality of service and grow our business in a very competitive marketplace.\n\nGlobal Product Head, Standard Chartered Securities Services\n\nGoldenSource provides the optimum mix of out-of–the-box capability and configurability that is flexible yet structured. It gives ASX the ability to enhance its responsiveness to the marketplace.\n\nTimothy Hogben, Group Executive Operations, Australian Securities Exchange\n\nWhat differentiates GoldenSource is that it does not simply provide a toolkit. Rather, it offers a mature set of out-of-the-box solutions aligned to common capital markets functions.\n\nMadan Sheina, Lead Analyst, Ovum\n\nGoldenSource offers a robust, complete and flexible data model, flexible workflow and comprehensive validation and distribution capabilities, which allow us to manage, and importantly link our reference data on one platform.\n\nKevin Gage, Senior Managing Director, Mizuho"
