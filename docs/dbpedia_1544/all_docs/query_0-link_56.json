        "text": "How to finally get Data Management\n\nWe live in an information economy, one built on top of a web of interconnected data. A web that is growing by 2.5 quintillion (10^18) bytes of data each day. Our lives have become increasingly digital, the world’s biggest companies run on data, and Data Management has never been more important for business.\n\nResearch from Mckinsey reports data-driven companies to be 23 times more likely to acquire customers, 6 times likelier to retain them and an incredible 19 times more likely to outperform on profits.\n\nBut as businesses invest in their data, they also face the challenges that data brings with it. Data is pervasive — it touches every process in a business. And complexity creeps in when there are different teams or functions responsible for different aspects of Data Management.\n\nThe boundaries of where one team stops being responsible and another one starts needs to be clear in order to achieve a good standard of Data Management, but before you can agree firm boundaries you need a complete picture of the capabilites.\n\nIn short, a framework is needed.\n\nData Management Frameworks\n\nThe big two: Goliath and Goliath"
