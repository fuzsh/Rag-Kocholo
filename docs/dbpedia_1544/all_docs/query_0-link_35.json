        "text": "In a previous Point by Point article, titled A Taxonomy for Data Analytics in Financial Services, we presented a hierarchical classification of typical analytics across buy side and sell side firms. In order to execute these analytics, an analytics architecture is needed, which are systems and/or tools, such as quant libraries, that support the data and process flows.\n\nA typical analytics architecture in financial services must cover five categories:\n\nMarket Data Analytics\n\nBusiness Reporting\n\nQuant Research & Development\n\nInvestment Analytics\n\nEconometric Analysis\n\nCore Components of Analytical Data Architecture\n\nThe core components of analytical data architecture ensure not only that the right data available and accessible for each type of analytic, but also that data governance is embedded throughout the analytics activities of the business.\n\nThe diagram below describes an analytics architecture that supports all five categories listed above."
