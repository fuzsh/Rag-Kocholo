        "text": "Did you know that according to IDC, employees lose 2.5 hours or about 30% of employees time searching for data on Excel spreadsheets?\n\nNo matter how much a company invests in tools like CRM or ERP, most employees are guilty of having an excel spreadsheet on the side for quick data entry.\n\nSo, why do we do that? And what is the real problem with using excel?\n\nLet’s find out.\n\nWhy do you still use Excel?\n\nThere are 2 significant reasons people fall back into the arms of Excel sheets.\n\nThe first reason:\n\nThe software is complicated and not intuitive.\n\nThe second reason:\n\nThe software is limited and does not offer the simple features you need.\n\nAfter a while…\n\nThe frustration creeps in.\n\nThen, you open a new Excel file, add some rows & columns & functions, and you have it set up in a few minutes. Copy-paste data into the sheet, then bam! Your data is ready.\n\nSimple, quick, and gets the job done. Agree?\n\nExcel is the best for finishing a quick job.\n\nBut, in the long run, it becomes tough to manage a core business with Excel.\n\nCommon Pitfalls of The Excel Sheet\n\nIt is a fact that we live in a tech-oriented world, and Excel should be considered the dinosaur of technology.\n\nSo, here’s what we need to do: rise above it and embrace the automated tools.\n\nBut first…\n\nlet me explain the two major disadvantages of using an excel sheet.\n\nCollaboration\n\nPicture this:\n\nYou are collaborating on a sheet. After you finish, you share it with your colleague or customer. They add their changes by overriding your version or adding a “_V2” at the end.\n\nNow imagine…\n\nYou keep doing this procedure a few times back and forth. Eventually, you will end up with 5 different versions on your computer. Also, your colleagues will end up with another 5 from their perspective of events.\n\nWhen you scale the impact of many versioning, you will find it slowly poisoning your business.\n\nThat’s because there is no golden source of truth for your data.\n\nThe Crash\n\nWe’ve all been there; the random crash of Excel that corrupts the file.\n\nOr even better,\n\nThe unexpected Windows update with Excel, while you have an opened sheet and forgot to save your changes.\n\nIt drives any person crazy!\n\nThe Evolution and Demise\n\nAfter some falls, you decide; the Excel workbook of horror has to die!!\n\nSo, you research software companies, get an expensive quote and bring your checkbook. Then wait a couple of months to have the perfect software delivered.\n\nA few months go by. You realize you need a couple of new features. Even though you already paid for other features that are not used. You get a new fat quote to apply those changes and a new delivery timeline.\n\nSo you say to yourself, “let me do that part on Excel for now…”.\n\nAnd the cycle repeats itself all over again.\n\nTurn Excel into a Web App\n\nWhat if you can turn those Excel sheets into a web application?\n\nWell, you actually can!\n\nNo-Code platforms like Beezr have changed the game for good.\n\nThe big players, such as Microsoft, are barely trying to catch up.\n\nNo-Code tools enable users to build their digital platform by uploading excel sheets. These tools create data models and relate them altogether. There are many data views and forms to handle your data correctly in no time.\n\nHere’s the best part is:\n\nYou can innovate as much as you want!\n\nWithout writing a single line of code, you may apply instant changes to your application. You can add & remove fields. You can create new data models and workflows to automate your business in minutes.\n\nThe possibilities are endless with no-code.\n\nIn a nutshell, no-code tools will let you:\n\nCollaborate remotely with your team without worrying about versioning.\n\nGain 360 view of your records.\n\nControl & secure data access.\n\nAutomate your business operations.\n\nDo you feel like you want to give it a try?"
