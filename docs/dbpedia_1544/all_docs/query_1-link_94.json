        "text": "This is a sponsored article by Glassbox.\n\nFintech leaders, C-suite executives, and investors are facing an epic challenge: How do we adapt our customer acquisition strategies as the landscape becomes more competitive? In this article, we‚Äôll highlight the challenges fintech companies face in customer acquisitions and the benefits of digital experience intelligence (DXI) in understanding your customer behaviors and challenges. Armed with those insights, you‚Äôll be better able to navigate the ever-evolving fintech environment to grow your customer base and nurture your existing customers.\n\nWant to know which of your marketing assets was most viewed by new conversions? Done!\n\nWondering where the common dropoff points are in your mobile app? No sweat.\n\nHere are ten ways DXI can inform and refine customer acquisition strategies for fintech companies to acquire more of their ideal customers.\n\n1. Identifying Acquisition Opportunities\n\nDigital experience intelligence enables your organization to measure and analyze how users interact with your website or mobile app. Analyzing these journeys provides insight into pain points and areas of high engagement for potential customers. This initial informational process can help you tailor your product offerings and marketing outreach to engage your ideal customers.\n\nNote: Be sure you‚Äôre targeting your ideal customers ‚Äì the ones who truly need and will benefit from your products or services. Understanding who they are, and making that extra effort, will pay off with a client base that is bought in and wants your solutions to work for them.\n\n2. Data-Driven Optimization\n\nLeveraging insights from digital experience intelligence can help identify which marketing channels attract your target audience. In addition, user behavior analysis can measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns to optimize them across different channels.\n\nüëâüèª For tips on gaining and retaining digital banking customers, check out this guide: 5 Mobile App Optimization Best Practices for Banks.\n\n3. Personalization at Scale\n\nPersonalizing customer experiences is one of the most effective ways to increase engagement and conversion rates, especially during the consideration and decision-making stages. A digital experience intelligence platform like Glassbox is the easiest and most effective way to gain critical insights into how users interact with your platform.\n\nYou can then use that data to segment customers by a variety of metrics to provide more relevant, personalized digital experiences. The data gained can also be used to inform product recommendations, web content, and marketing messages, as well as cater to specific preferences, all of which can boost engagement and conversions.\n\n4. Mobile Optimization\n\nNearly 40% of app uninstallations occur because people are simply not using the app. The best way to understand why customers are abandoning your app is by measuring and monitoring your customer journeys. Armed with that information, you can refine your app to ensure it‚Äôs relevant, intuitive, and user-friendly so your users are never tempted to select ‚ÄúRemove app.‚Äù\n\n5. A/B Testing for Optimization\n\nData-driven insights are the holy grail of refining customer acquisition strategies. A/B testing enables companies to understand which versions of websites, apps, and offers perform best in attracting and converting potential customers. The insights you gain can inform continuous improvement of user experience and refine your customer acquisition strategies.\n\n6. Proactively Addressing Customer Pain Points\n\nTechnology like Real User Monitoring (RUM) and newer iterations like Real User Experience (RUX) enable fintech companies to quickly detect and resolve technical issues.\n\nThe ability to swiftly address user experience pain points and intercept technical snags before they escalate can transform your customer‚Äôs journey from one of frustration into a smooth and responsive experience that makes them feel valued. With 80% of consumers reporting that customer experiences need to be improved, proactive engagement is your golden ticket to differentiation.\n\n7. Unlocking More Substantial Customer Feedback with AI\n\nVoice of the Customer (VoC) data captures customer feedback so you can gain a deeper understanding of their digital experiences. However, VoC data only represents the vocal minority‚Äîour internal analysis found that only about 4% of users provide feedback.\n\nFintech companies can now leverage AI to automatically compare these rated interactions to similar interactions across the entire user base. We do this at Glassbox with our Voice of the Silent (VoS) tool, which makes it easier to understand what the majority is experiencing, even when they blow off satisfaction surveys.\n\n8. Building Customer Trust Through Transparency\n\nBuilding customer trust is the most direct path to loyalty. Digital experience intelligence reveals where users hesitate to provide information or engage, which can reveal areas for improving transparency about data privacy and security measures. Addressing those concerns demonstrates your commitment to user safety, which puts you further along the path to customer trust and loyalty.\n\n9. Clear The Biggest Hurdle: Knowing What Your Customers Want\n\nWith fintech products and services flooding the market, customers have an exhausting supply of options if you fall short of their expectations for seamless digital experiences. Understanding how they experience interactions with your website or mobile app is critical to effectively measuring, analyzing, improving, and ultimately ensuring customers feel understood and appreciated.\n\n10. Make Customer Acquisition Everyone‚Äôs Business\n\nCustomer acquisition should be an all-encompassing, organization-wide effort ‚Äì not just the job of marketing or product development. Lasting relationships are supported at multiple levels and in diverse ways, and playing that message on repeat is essential to making it stick.\n\nWant to see what DXI actually looks like in action? Click around in Glassbox‚Äôs self-guided platform tour.\n\nThis is a sponsored article by LiveBank by Ailleron\n\nIn this digital age, the banking sector is not just undergoing change; it is at the cusp of a revolutionary transformation that is poised to redefine the very fabric of financial services. This transformative wave is powered by the synergistic relationship between human intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI). Far from merely mechanizing existing processes, this collaboration aims to completely reimagine how banking services are delivered, making them more intuitive, efficient, and customer-centric.\n\nTransforming Human-to-Human Interaction through Technology\n\nAt the heart of this transformation is the role of Generative AI. This advanced form of AI is transforming modern banking by enhancing the human element rather than replacing it, particularly in complex sales processes. For example, while simpler banking products have become largely automated and can be easily accessed online by customers independently, more intricate products ‚Äì like those involving mortgages or business financing ‚Äì still benefit significantly from human insight. However, AI tools in banking is not replacing the need for human interaction; instead, it enhances the advisory services provided by banking professionals, making these interactions more productive and customer-friendly.\n\nEntirely Digital Mortgage Application Process\n\nA vivid demonstration of this innovative approach was showcased by LiveBank in collaboration with ING Bank on the London stage. They illustrated how digitization could reinvent the mortgage process, which has traditionally relied heavily on face-to-face interactions and extensive paperwork. By integrating AI with digital technologies, LiveBank has transformed this process to better align with contemporary customer expectations, which include a seamless digital experience, personalized service, and simplified procedures that significantly cut down on processing times.\n\nAs a leader of Retail Banking in ING emphasized during a joint speech, ‚ÄúCustomers seek the convenience of applying for a mortgage online, uploading required documents electronically, and monitoring their application‚Äôs progress in real-time. They also prioritize transparency, clear communication, competitive interest rates, and personalized guidance throughout the mortgage journey. Ultimately, they desire a smoother and more efficient experience compared to traditional paper-based methods.‚Äù\n\nWith 45% of consumers favoring digital channels for banking product purchases, LiveBank aligns perfectly with the modern client‚Äôs preferences. It streamlines banking operations and enhances customer service by offering real-time human-to-human assistance through the customer‚Äôs first-choice communication channel.\n\nThe entire presentation and more insights are available here.\n\nHow to Redefine an Online Mortgage Experience?\n\nING Bank has been expanding its remote customer service capabilities, particularly for clients interested in mortgage offerings. The journey began with the option to submit applications via phone through the Contract Center, which was later extended to include customers using the services of specialists in ING‚Äôs branches.\n\nRecognizing the evolving landscape of customer expectations, ING took the initiative to introduce video call options, marking a significant advancement in providing clients with a seamless remote banking experience. This decision entailed evaluating both customer needs and advisor perspectives.\n\nSuccess Story of ING Bank & LiveBank by Ailleron\n\nTo ensure alignment with customer expectations, ING conducted comprehensive research, actively seeking feedback and insights. Valuable suggestions emerged from this process, including the need for video meetings with specialists in local branches, especially in emergency situations.\n\nIn response to these insights, ING embarked on a journey to integrate customer expectations with the capabilities offered by video support tools. This strategic alignment not only enhances the remote banking experience but also underscores ING‚Äôs commitment to innovation and customer-centricity.\n\nThis transformation is crucial in today‚Äôs banking landscape, where customer expectations are increasingly geared towards digital solutions. The transition involves not only adopting new technologies but also rethinking the customer journey to make it as frictionless as possible. By reducing the need for in-person meetings and streamlining documentation, banks can address significant pain points, making the process quicker and more pleasant for customers while also optimizing operational efficiency.\n\nThe successful digital transformation of complex banking products like mortgages requires thorough organizational preparation. It entails understanding and integrating the needs and expectations of all stakeholders involved ‚Äì both customers and bank employees. This preparation is critical to ensure that the new digital channels are not just new tools but are part of a holistic strategy to improve both customer and employee experiences.\n\nBank Branches and Their Role in Building Customer Relations\n\nThe recent pandemic has accelerated the shift away from traditional branch-based banking towards more dynamic, digital models. This shift has prompted banks to rethink the role of physical branches. Despite their reduced footfall, branches continue to play a critical role, particularly in fostering stronger customer relationships. Recognizing this, LiveBank has innovated a new approach where loan specialists are made available to clients through convenient video calls, allowing for digital collaboration throughout the loan application process. This approach not only maintains the personal touch that is often crucial in banking but also enhances convenience and efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, LiveBank‚Äôs method allows clients to choose how they wish to engage with the bank, emphasizing the flexibility and client autonomy that modern customers desire. This model has proved successful, leading to a majority of remote interactions with over 400 branch mortgage specialists (60% of new meetings were on video) while maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction 4.9/5 ‚Äì a testament to the effectiveness of integrating personalization with digital efficiency.\n\nHow to Increase Sales in Banking Using AI & GenAI Capabilities?\n\nThe expansive capabilities of Generative AI were further highlighted at FinovateEurope in London, where banking experts showcased how AI could elevate the credit process. AI assists bank advisors by managing vast amounts of data and providing insights, thereby enhancing their ability to offer tailored advice. Additionally, the use of advanced AI-driven avatars can pre-qualify customer needs, ensuring that when a client is handed over to a human advisor, the groundwork is already laid for productive interaction.\n\nThis blend of human empathy and machine precision is crucial. It leverages the strengths of both to optimize banking operations and tailor services to individual needs, thereby not only elevating the efficiency and effectiveness of banking services but also enriching the customer experience with a personal touch that technology alone cannot provide.\n\nHuman Empathy Meets Machine Precision to Optimize Banking Operations\n\nLiveBank exemplifies this future, standing at the forefront of the transformative journey in banking. Its platform is meticulously designed to integrate the capabilities of humans and machines seamlessly, ensuring that every customer interaction is a blend of efficiency, personalization, and security. The key to their success lies in finding the optimal balance between human and artificial intelligence, using the unique attributes of both to deliver high-quality service in real time.\n\nIn conclusion, as the banking sector moves forward, the integration of human and machine intelligence holds incredible potential. Innovations like those pioneered by LiveBank are not just enhancing operational efficiencies; they are fundamentally enriching how customers experience banking. This is a visionary journey, one that promises to transform the landscape of financial services and set new standards for the banking industry worldwide.\n\nMateusz Grys, LiveBank by Ailleron speaker said, ‚ÄúGenerative AI is a major trend reshaping our industry, but the human aspect remains critical, especially in sales and advisory roles. It‚Äôs crucial for dealing with complex banking products that customers may encounter only once in their lifetime. By integrating AI, we enhance these interactions, but the empathy and understanding of human advisors are irreplaceable when navigating such significant financial decisions.‚Äù\n\nAs the banking sector stands at the precipice of a new era powered by fintech innovation, mastering the rapid deployment of AI technologies is not just beneficial‚Äîit‚Äôs imperative. At FinovateSpring 2024, Chris Brown, President of Intelygenz USA, will share pivotal insights during his keynote on ‚ÄúAccelerating Bank-Fintech Fusion: Deep Tech & AI Solutions in Action.‚Äù However, the core themes of his talk resonate beyond the conference, offering valuable lessons for all financial institutions navigating the complex terrain of digital transformation.\n\nChris Brown‚Äôs address will confront a stark reality in the fintech space: while many AI projects begin with promise, few successfully bridge the gap from development to production. An overwhelming 85% of these initiatives falter, yet Intelygenz has carved a niche in ensuring projects land within the successful 15%. This capability is not just a differentiator but a strategic imperative that positions banks to lead rather than follow in the digital age.\n\nThe keynote will explore three strategic areas where AI can significantly impact banking operations, tailored to both conference attendees and the broader industry audience:\n\nBuilding Data-Driven Architecture with AI\n\nLeveraging AI to enhance data architectures transforms the foundational operations of banking. By integrating predictive analytics for credit scoring, automated compliance monitoring, and real-time fraud detection systems, banks can enhance decision-making, ensure compliance, and secure transactions, streamlining operations while significantly improving risk management and customer trust.\n\nStreaming AI to Automate Day-to-Day Operations\n\nThe deployment of streaming AI moves the technology from a conceptual stage to an operational necessity, automating critical operations such as transaction monitoring and customer interactions. This shift not only boosts operational efficiency but also enhances the quality of customer service, providing real-time, actionable insights that empower banks to make informed decisions swiftly.\n\nImplementing Human Experience-Centric AI Solutions\n\nAt the heart of technological advancements lies the need to enhance human interactions. By focusing on AI-driven enhancements in customer service operations and user interfaces, banks can forge deeper connections with their customers, resulting in increased loyalty and satisfaction. From AI-enhanced financial wellness programs to advanced biometric authentication and accessibility improvements, these technologies are reshaping how banks interact with their customers.\n\nThese areas underscore Intelygenz‚Äôs expertise in rapidly transitioning AI projects from development to deployment, ensuring they not only meet but exceed their intended goals swiftly.\n\nFor those attending FinovateSpring, Chris Brown‚Äôs session will not only illuminate pathways to leveraging AI but also provide practical insights into overcoming the implementation challenges often encountered by financial institutions.

LinkedIn\n\nThis is a sponsored post by Accusoft.\n\nFintech software has become a critical component of the financial services industry, allowing customers to readily access financial products on their own terms while also enhancing operational efficiency. Digital technology continues to revolutionize the way financial institutions operate, and developers work hard to create new applications that can manage workloads previously spread across multiple systems and software.\n\nDocument viewing and sharing capabilities are among the most important features for fintech applications. While developers can use a variety of document lifecycle solutions to avoid the difficult task of building those features from scratch, the financial industry faces unique security and compatibility requirements when it comes to selecting integration partners. To fully understand these technical challenges, it‚Äôs important to understand the role of Java in the development of today‚Äôs fintech applications.\n\nHow Java Became So Important to the Financial Industry\n\nFinancial institutions were early adopters of computerized workflows. The first electronic communication network that made it possible to trade financial products outside the stock market floor was introduced in 1969. Computerized order flows became more widespread in the 1970s, with most institutions developing their own in-house systems. Digitization really took off in the 1980s and early 1990s following the introduction of the Bloomberg terminal and the Financial Information eXhange (FIX) protocol. In the late 1990s, the Nasdaq made it possible to execute securities trades without manual intervention by adopting Island ECN.\n\nJava burst onto the programming language scene in 1995, and its arrival proved to be well-timed. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw extensive mergers and acquisitions in the financial industry, which left many companies struggling to integrate disparate applications and data. Java programming language, with its ability to support multiple platforms (‚ÄúWrite once, run anywhere‚Äù was an early slogan used by Sun Microsystems) proved to be an attractive solution to this challenge, and many financial applications were ported into Java. It also helped that Java was easy to use and orders of magnitude faster than legacy code running on outdated platforms.\n\nWithin just a few years, Java became the dominant programming language for the financial services industry. Its popularity only accelerated after the release of OpenJDK, a free and open-source implementation of the language, in 2007. By 2011, an Oracle report estimated that over 80% of electronic trading applications and almost all FIX engines were written using Java. Even now, nearly 30 years after its introduction, Java remains the dominant programming language used by financial services, far outpacing other open-source alternatives.\n\nWhy the Financial Industry Loves Java\n\nDevelopers in the financial sector haven‚Äôt just stuck with Java for so long out of habit or inertia; Java‚Äôs distinctive features make it uniquely suited for the needs of financial applications, both for longstanding enterprise-grade banking systems and innovative new fintech solutions.\n\nSecurity\n\nIt goes without saying that security is always a top consideration in the financial services industry. Banking and trading applications need to have security measures in place to protect financial data and personally identifiable information from unauthorized access. Java makes it easy to restrict data access and offers a variety of memory safety features that mitigate potential vulnerabilities, especially those caused by common programming errors. Oracle also continues to provide regular updates that patch known vulnerabilities and account for the latest cybersecurity threats.\n\nPortability\n\nAs a platform-independent language, Java applications can run on almost any device. This has always been a major advantage in the financial industry, but it has proved even more valuable in the age of cloud computing and mobile applications. Developers can use the same code to deploy software in a virtual environment and make it accessible to end-users from their smartphones, computers, or other devices. Java virtual machines also support other programming languages, which further enhances the language‚Äôs flexibility.\n\nReliability\n\nSince Java has been in continuous use for nearly 30 years and enjoys support from a robust development community, it has become one of the most reliable programming languages in the world. Potential instabilities have long since been addressed and there are many developer tools and documentation available to ensure that software is built upon a strong foundation. This is critically important for banking and financial applications, which require high levels of performance paired with fault tolerance.\n\nThe Need for Java-Based Document Viewing & Sharing\n\nAs fintech developers continue to build new applications that make life easier for customers and employees within the financial sector, they are increasingly finding that users expect more when it comes to viewing and sharing documents. Nobody wants to waste time and resources processing paper documents by hand, and most organizations want to avoid the security risks that come with relying on external applications for managing digital documents.\n\nUnfortunately, today‚Äôs application users expect complex document viewing capabilities that are difficult for most developers to build from scratch. While there are several integrations available that can add document lifecycle features, most of them are not Java based and require additional development work to incorporate them into existing fintech solutions. Without the ability to support viewing, sharing, and editing natively within the Java application, users often turn to workarounds involving external programs, which creates security and version confusion risks.\n\nImplementing Java-based Document Features with VirtualViewer\n\nAccusoft‚Äôs VirtualViewer is a powerful HTML5 document viewing solution built from the ground up using Java to ensure maximum compatibility with fintech applications in the financial services industry while also meeting complex functionality and security requirements. With support for diverse document types, such as PDF, TIFF, JPEG, AFP, PCL, and Microsoft Office, VirtualViewer eliminates the need for multiple viewing solutions to create a better user experience within fintech software.\n\nAs a Java-based integration, VirtualViewer is compatible with almost any operating system and is both easy to implement and manage. No software needs to be installed on the user‚Äôs desktop, which allows fintech developers to roll out a scalable solution that meets their critical security and business continuity requirements within a single, high-speed application. VirtualViewer‚Äôs server component quickly renders and delivers individual document pages for local viewing as needed so users can access, view, annotate, redact, and manipulate financial documents on the fly. Since documents are displayed within the web-based viewer, there‚Äôs no need to download or transfer files, which enhances both security and efficiency.\n\nWhen implemented as a replacement for a mortgage lender‚Äôs content management system, VirtualViewer made it possible to import and deliver more than half a million documents across the enterprise each day. Documents could be retrieved and viewed in under two seconds, contributing to a 40% improvement in mortgage processing times.\n\nEnhance Your Java Fintech Application with VirtualViewer\n\nAccusoft‚Äôs VirtualViewer provides true cross-platform document support for your Java-based applications. Whether you‚Äôre deploying your application within the cloud, on-prem, or as part of a hybrid environment, VirtualViewer‚Äôs powerful APIs can instantly provide your software with the document viewing and sharing features your customers are looking for. Installing the viewer takes less than ten minutes, and our out-of-the-box connectors make it easy to quickly connect to leading ECM applications, including Alfresco, IBM, and Pegasystems.\n\nSee for yourself: take VirtualViewer for a test drive and experience all the features available for your Java-based application.\n\nThis is a sponsored blog post by Delaware Prosperity Partnership\n\nA new Discover Bank fund aims to increase financial health throughout Delaware while enriching the state‚Äôs innovation ecosystem and enhancing Delaware‚Äôs reputation as a hub for banking and financial services.\n\nThe Discover Financial Health Improvement Fund will support startups and early-stage technology companies that are developing solutions to improve the financial well-being of low- and moderate-income residents, communities, and small businesses statewide. Discover Bank has made an initial capital commitment of $36 million to the Fund, which was announced in June and launches this month.\n\n‚ÄúWe continually explore innovative ways to support our communities in which we operate, and the initial portfolio companies in the Discover Financial Health Improvement Fund have developed technologies that improve the financial health of people with modest means and provide tools to support small businesses growth,‚Äù said Matthew Parks, Vice President of Discover Bank. ‚ÄúIt is our expectation that these technologies can both be profitable and beneficial to the community.‚Äù\n\nBy creating a framework to drive capital investments to fintech startups, the Fund ultimately seeks to ensure that affordable and relevant financial products and services are useful and accessible to unserved and underserved individuals and small businesses. Clients for these offerings include the unbanked and the underbanked and those with low credit scores, low savings rates and/or high borrowing costs.\n\nThe mission-driven initiative is a collaboration between Discover Bank, the Financial Health Network, ResilienceVC, and Delaware-based Chartline Capital. The Financial Health Network, a leading authority in its field, will help evaluate startups for their potential impact on financial-health improvement. ResilienceVC, a seed-stage domestically focused venture firm investing in embedded fintech startups, will manage Discover‚Äôs earlier-stage investments.\n\nVenture capital firm Chartline Capital Partners was formed under the principle that entrepreneurship and venture capital can be leveraged to improve the world. The firm invests in high-growth business-to-business technology companies serving core industries after they have started scaling their go-to-market and helps founders and management teams accelerate growth. Chartline will manage Discover‚Äôs later-stage investments.\n\n‚ÄúThroughout time, new technologies have made people‚Äôs lives better,‚Äù said Ben duPont, Chartline co-founder and Managing Director. ‚ÄúChartline is honored to partner with Discover to invest in companies leveraging new financial technologies to improve the lives of low- and moderate-income people, communities and small businesses.‚Äù\n\nThe Fund has a priority focus on investing in fintech startups that are willing to operate out of the new Financial Technology Building on the STAR Campus of the University of Delaware in Newark. Fund support will then seek to spread to companies that may be located throughout the mid-Atlantic region. Companies outside the region are still eligible for funding, but the venture must be focused on materially improving financial health for consumers and small businesses throughout the State of Delaware and/or the surrounding mid-Atlantic region. Any venture focused on improving financial health ‚Äì regardless of its product or service‚Äôs delivery format or specific financial topic addressed ‚Äì may apply for funding.\n\nBy boosting individual startups, the Discover Financial Health Improvement Fund also will bolster Delaware‚Äôs entrepreneurial ecosystem. According to Noah Olson, Director of Innovation at statewide economic development organization Delaware Prosperity Partnership, a legacy strength in financial services, coupled with a nurturing environment for business growth, makes Delaware a great place to grow a fintech company.\n\n‚ÄúDiscover, a global company with a major footprint here in Delaware, is leading by example with this new fund,‚Äù Olson said. ‚ÄúAdding further investment resources to a growing startup ecosystem will be beneficial for the state, as well as for the portfolio companies who are focused on financial health improvement.‚Äù"
