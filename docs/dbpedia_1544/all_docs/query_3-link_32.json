        "text": "In the same way that a slight error in alignment can cause a dart to miss the target, even a small error in data can result in flawed insights and misguided strategies. This is why businesses accuracy of data to create reliable business decisions.\n\nBut because measuring data accuracy isn’t straightforward, this article will shed light on what businesses can do to maintain and track it.\n\nWhat is Data Accuracy?\n\nData accuracy emphasizes the correctness, consistency, and reliability of data available to an organization. It’s one of the six dimensions of data quality, concentrating on how closely data reflects actual business values or conditions.\n\nWith accurate data, IT and business leaders can drive growth, profitability, and performance. It helps organizations with:\n\nOperational efficiency\n\nInnovation\n\nAdherence to regulations\n\nImproved customer satisfaction\n\nData is considered inaccurate if it’s technically wrong, misrepresented, insufficient, and unclear. Examples of factors that can compromise data accuracy include human errors (ex: duplicate entries, erroneous entries) and system errors (ex: outdated software, bugs).\n\nHere’s an example from the insurance industry of what might happen if data accuracy isn’t monitored:\n\nIn the case of inaccurate policyholder details, coverage details, and premium payments, insurance providers can immediately lose credibility and customer confidence. Furthermore, if these errors result in delayed payouts, customers are likely to withdraw from the business or file lawsuits.\n\nBy keeping tabs on data accuracy, companies can prevent such negative consequences. But measuring it presents a hurdle. Traditionally, companies stack their collected data against what’s often referred to as a “golden source” to measure data accuracy. However, today’s complex data environments make finding the golden source–a robust, accessible, and reliable data repository–a feat of its own.\n\nWhy Modern Companies Struggle To Measure Data Accuracy\n\nData-driven organizations face the challenge of identifying a “golden source” because they operate in multi-layered data environments, combining data from various sources. Given this tricky situation, there might not even be a definitive golden source to turn to.\n\nIt becomes a futile exercise, assuming that the only way to measure data accuracy is to contrast it with a possible nonexistent benchmark.\n\nIn reality, however, analyzing data accuracy is a matter of determining whether data values are free of anomalies and fully reflect the real-world information they represent. Instead of striving to understand what 100% data accuracy looks like, organizations are better off tracking inaccurate data and relying on other data quality dimensions to monitor how precise their current data is.\n\nWhere Data Accuracy is Replaceable\n\nData accuracy helps ensure data integrity, which is crucial for optimizing business strategies. However, the effort and time spent finding a golden source to refer to isn’t worth the chase for many companies.\n\nFocusing on other data quality dimensions, especially at the point of source and integration, can better capture the business value data accuracy provides.\n\nAt the source, validity and conformity rules can ensure that the data adheres to defined formats and standards. For instance, verifying that date fields are valid and formatted correctly (mm-dd-yy vs. dd-mm-yy), or that product codes conform to a specified format. These can resolve many of the issues that accuracy checks aim to address and prevent errors from creeping into the system.\n\nAt various points of integration, on the other hand, completeness and consistency metrics can be used to gauge a company’s data accuracy. Completeness measures the number of missing data values. For example, an incomplete customer record (missing phone number and email address) can be flagged for follow-up before it impacts downstream processes.\n\nConsistency, on the other hand, measures conflicting data values. If upon follow-up, a customer’s email address becomes available in one system but not another, tracking data consistency can highlight this discrepancy, calling for data reconciliation.\n\nAssessing both during integration ensures the data remains trustworthy and reliable as it flows throughout the system.\n\nAccuracy of Data: Get A Better View\n\nWhile hitting a 100% data accuracy mark isn’t possible, many companies can strive to get as close to it as they can.\n\nRather than measuring accuracy against this ideal metric, organizations can measure data quality with different tools and data quality dimensions to see where they currently stand in terms of accuracy. Adding this approach to their data strategy will help them get better insights and make smarter business decisions.\n\nLet Infoverity help you visualize your data’s accuracy.
