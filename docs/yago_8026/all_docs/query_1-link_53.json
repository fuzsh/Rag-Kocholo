        "text": "They’re a part of the brotherhood of the hardwood, forever.\n\nWednesday night, Coupeville High School junior Mikey Robinett made his varsity basketball debut, knocking down a pair of buckets to become the 411th player to score for a program which began way back in 1917.\n\nOr at least he’s the 411th player I can document, as there are still many players from the very early days whose names and stats remain hidden behind a veil of prairie fog, their fates bound to long-lost scorebooks.\n\nFor every Banky Fisher and Gaylord Stidham, who led the 1939-1940 CHS hoops squad with 44 and 41 points respectively, there remains a bunch of prairie guys from the ’20s and ’30s just out of my grasp.\n\nWhich is why it was such a thrill in May 2021 when a program legend suddenly surfaced with new info, gently bemused that I cared so much about his teenage days.\n\nJack Elzinga filled up the hoops for the Wolves in the early ’50s, then went on to lead an extraordinary life.\n\nOne day he Googles himself and finds to his amazement some dude back in his hometown has been name-dropping him on a regular basis.\n\nAn email exchange later, with his side of the conversation feeling more like a beautifully handwritten letter, “The Zinger” reveals he’s not only still alive, but possesses info on the 1953-1954 Wolf squad, one of my two holy grails.\n\nThanks to Elzinga, I’m able to finally lock down finished career numbers for both him and Jerry Zylstra, while getting halfway home in my mission to honor Tom Sahli.\n\nNow, we know for a fact Sahli owns the seventh-best single-season performance by a Coupeville boy, knocking down 409 points as a senior.\n\nCombined with the 310 he tallied as a junior, he sits with 719 points on my list, jumping from #90 to #20 on the career scoring chart.\n\nNow there’s still the matter of that other missing holy grail — a scorebook for Sahli’s sophomore season of 1951-52 — but every time someone cleans out an old barn, hope flutters on the winds.\n\nThanks to Elzinga’s stats, Zylstra (527 points) moved from #59 to #44 all-time, while Elzinga (770) himself jumped from #25 to #14, then back to #15 after Hawthorne Wolfe passed him last season.\n\n“The Zinger” twice led the Wolves in scoring, rattling the rims for 337 and 309 points as a junior and senior, coming after he notched 124 as a sophomore while playing alongside Sahli.\n\nLast night, after Robinett joined the hoops brotherhood, I was talking to current CHS coach Brad Sherman (#8 all-time on the scoring list) and Elzinga’s name came up.\n\nSo today I did my own Google search and was saddened to discover “The Zinger” passed away at age 83 in late August.\n\nHis obit mentions he battled heart disease for several years, and in our emails, he mentioned he was likely the only All-District player of his time who had survived polio just five years prior.\n\nIn our last exchange, Elzinga capped things thusly:\n\nThis has been a ball for me. So happy to share things with someone with your quirky interests.\n\nIt was my honor, sir.\n\nCoupeville Sports has opened a door to the past and allowed me, and many others, to remind the world the 106-year tale of Wolf boys basketball is not a dead history, but an ever evolving one.\n\nFrom Roy Armstrong in the ’20s to Sid Mudgett in the ’50s, from Del O’Shell in the ’80s to Oscar Liquidano in the 2010’s, every player who pulled on the uniform is part of something bigger than themselves.\n\nWhy do I write so much about stats — tracking them, name-dropping old school players as new-age players craft their own stories?\n\nBecause last night, along with Robinett’s debut, Wolf junior Logan Downes popped for a game-high 17 points, which moves him from 318 points to 335, and bumps him from #91 to #82 on the all-time chart.\n\nThat means he passes Jim Yake (331), Aaron Trumbull (330), Brad Brown (328), Charlie Tessaro (328), Utz Conard (326), Ian Smith (324), David Ford (323), Bob Rea (320) and Chris Marti (319) — all heavy hitters.\n\nIt doesn’t make their stories any less compelling, but Downes pursuit of excellence gives us a chance to remember what those other players meant to the Wolf program.\n\nWhether you scored 1,137 career varsity points like Jeff Stone and Mike Bagby, or are one of the seven dudes to record exactly one point, you are part of the brotherhood.\n\nCelebrate the past, cheer the present, look forward to the future.\n\nTake a moment to toast “The Zinger,” then show up at the CHS gym tonight as Downes, Alex Murdy, and the current cast square off with Sedro-Woolley, ready to pen another chapter.\n\nTo read Jack Elzinga’s obit, pop over to:\n\nhttps://www.gainesville.com/obituaries/pgai0286914\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nOne mission accomplished.\n\nThanks to a Google search where he inadvertently discovered my obsession with his high school hoops exploits, Jack Elzinga has helped me fill in one of the missing pieces of Coupeville High School boys basketball history.\n\nAs I’ve tried to compile a complete scoring record for a program which began in 1917, it’s been an uphill battle, especially with anything before the “modern” era.\n\nI’ve felt pretty good about what we have, which goes 398 players deep, though the gaps will always bother me.\n\nWhile we may never track down stats for the guys from the ’30s and ’40s, I can deal with that.\n\nScoring was at a much-lower rate back then, and no one from that time period would likely crack the career top 100, much less top 10.\n\nBut three guys from the ’50s — Elzinga, Tom Sahli, and Jerry Zylstra — kept me awake at night.\n\nWell that, and the fact “Big” Mike Criscuola may never get his proper due, as his missing 8th grade stats and questionable playoff totals from other seasons have him #5 all-time, when he’s closer to #1.\n\nBut back to Elzinga, Sahli, and Zylstra, and the “missing” seasons of 1951-1952 and 1953-1954.\n\nOr … formerly missing seasons, at least in the case of 53-54.\n\nThanks to Elzinga, who is a Professor Emeritus for the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Florida, we now have scoring stats for that campaign.\n\nThe fast facts:\n\nSahli, a senior, scored 409 points that season, which is the seventh-best single-season performance by a Wolf boy.\n\nCombined with the 310 he scored as a junior, he now sits with 719 points on my list, jumping from #90 to #19 on the career scoring chart.\n\nThough, if someone can come up with totals from Sahli’s sophomore year (51-52), he’ll shoot even higher.\n\nAlways something to keep me awake.\n\nElzinga and Zylstra, sophomores on that 53-54 squad, went for 124 and 122 points, raising their (now final) career totals to 770 and 527, respectively.\n\nThat moves Elzinga from #25 to #14 and Zylstra from #59 to #42 all-time.\n\nAll while giving current Coupeville sniper Hawthorne Wolfe a little more work to do, as the 1950’s-era players getting their rightful due bumps him back (for a moment) from #47 to #49.\n\nWith 492 points and counting and nine games left in this pandemic-shortened season, the CHS junior, who has often expressed interest in players who came before him, will likely take that as a challenge.\n\nAs we update the ever-evolving 104-year history of Wolf boys basketball, I also offer up the following from Elzinga.\n\nLike my communications with legendary former CHS coach Bob Barker, it reads more like a well-written book than an email.\n\nDavid,\n\nI did a vanity Google this afternoon and came upon your blog.\n\nI can fill in some of your gaps. I have the 1954 Leloo Cly.\n\nThat was my sophomore year and Tom Sahli’s senior year. He averaged 19.5 pts/game. Later I saw him play against Elgin Baylor.\n\nWe were a pretty good team – the yearbook said we had the best record in “several years.”\n\nSahli was our star – we mostly passed the ball around until we could get it to him.\n\nLeloo Cly doesn’t record rebounds but Tom seemed to snatch every one.\n\nI started every game, averaging 5.6 pts/game.\n\nAfter Tom graduated I became the center and had two productive seasons.\n\nI was All-District in the end-of-year tournaments both years. As I recall, I averaged about 15 pts/game both seasons.\n\nGil Winje put together some scrapbooks of press clippings of the Tri-County basketball league.\n\nThese clippings were new to me – no one in Coupeville read the Everett paper.\n\nGil did this for his brother who played for Granite Falls. He did this for other years too.\n\nGetting the scrapbook of my senior year of basketball was a fabulous treat.\n\nWe had a successful season that year but fell short of going to state.\n\nLa Conner was a big rivalry but we beat them home-and-away that year, but lost to them in the consolation game of the district tourney.\n\nThey went on to state where Gail Thulen set the place on fire, shattering records, scoring 41 points in one game to set the state tourney record.\n\nWe’d seen a lot of Gail and I guess we’d learned how to corral him.\n\nI think Gail got a scholarship to Washington State.\n\nMe? I got a scholarship to Everett Junior College, where I played one year before moving on to U-Dub to focus on my studies.\n\nThey don’t put this in the record books but I’m sure I’m the only All-District player who survived polio five years previously.\n\nHarold Buckner was an excellent baseball player as you have noted in your blog. We’re still good friends.\n\nThis has been a ball for me. So happy to share things with someone with your quirky interests.\n\nIf I can find any more info I’ll send it along.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJack\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nRunning this blog is one part writing, one part detective work.\n\nWhen it’s really humming, I want Coupeville Sports to span the entire length of athletics here on the prairie that sits in the middle of a rock out in the water up in an area which is still shrouded in mystery.\n\nWe should celebrate the young girl who is playing middle school basketball for the first time, sporting her first pair of hardwood-ready shoes, her pigtails flying in different directions as she learns to reverse and get back on defense.\n\nAnd we should also pay tribute to the guys who once played football in leather helmets, raw-boned farm kids who carved out some time from their chores (and feeding the pigs) to chase a pigskin around.\n\nThe one can be written about in the moment, while the other takes research, leafing through old newspapers and yearbooks, stirring people’s memories and hoping, always hoping, for some new discovery to fill in a vital part of the story.\n\nSince launching Coupeville Sports in mid-2012, I have discovered one truth — not everyone held on to the past in the way I would have liked.\n\nFor every former coach like Randy King, who had complete scorebooks for 19 of his 20 seasons running the CHS boys basketball program, there’s a peer who tossed everything into a closet, or a filing cabinet, or worse, into the round file.\n\nBut I have also been pleasantly surprised from time to time by the sudden reveal of mementos, clippings, and photos, pulled from attics, or basements, or the back rooms of various local barns.\n\nWhile things I wish were easy to find often aren’t, things I never expected to see often surface when least expected.\n\nSo I’m putting the call out for what we’ll call the “holy grails,” records and artifacts which currently top my list of wish-we-could-find-them items.\n\nIf you or someone you know has these items, or can find them, you will earn eternal membership on my best friend’s list.\n\nAnd if you have something that’s not on my list, but something you consider interesting, something you wish I would write about, don’t hesitate to contact me.\n\nCoupeville Sports is now, has always been, and will always be, a community effort. I write the words, but I can’t do it without your help.\n\nWith that, a few of things I most wish would pop up.\n\n**Individual scoring totals for the 1951-1952 and 1953-1954 Coupeville High School boys basketball teams.\n\nI have stats for 70 of the 102 Wolf boys hoops squads, and, while I would love to find scoring totals for teams from the ’20s, ’30s, and ’40s, these two teams from the ’50s are the biggest remaining missing pieces to the all-time scoring story.\n\nThere just wasn’t enough offense in those early decades for any players from that time to compete with the CHS stars of the ’70s and beyond.\n\nBut Jack Elzinga, who played on the 53-54 team, and Tom Sahli, who played for both those squads, could shake up the top 20, maybe even top 10, if I could finalize their numbers.\n\nElzinga is already #25 all-time, and that’s with me missing a full season. Sahli, who went on to be a great college basketball player, is #88, based on just his junior campaign.\n\nBoth players were among the first big-time scorers in school history, and deserve to have their legacies fully honored.\n\n**Scoring totals for the 1974-1975 CHS girls basketball team, the first to play after Title IX changed the landscape.\n\nOther than a paragraph or two (and I mean that literally), the Whidbey News-Times completely ignored the season as if it never happened.\n\nAnd, while I obtained a roster from the school yearbook, there were no stats included.\n\nOf the 45 seasons of Wolf girls hoops in the modern era, it’s the only one for which I don’t have scoring totals, and that is a mighty big airball.\n\n**Video of girls hoops supernova Zenovia Barron and film of the 1969-1970 boys basketball team.\n\nThe former is the #2 scorer in school history, girl or boy, and those who saw her play describe her in reverent tones.\n\nHaving left the News-Times right before she hit high school, I was busy renting Jurassic Park and hyping The Hudsucker Proxy during the start of my 12-year run at Videoville when she shook up the hardwood scene beginning in the winter of 1994, and I never saw her play.\n\nI wish I had, and I hope someone out there used a camcorder to capture Novi in her prime.\n\nThe 69-70 team, which played before I was born (so I have a good excuse for not being there) was the first Whidbey Island hoops squad to win a district title.\n\nPlaying before the creation of the three-point shot, those Wolves, led by Jeff Stone and his 644 points, set scoring records which haven’t been touched in 50 years.\n\nThis is a longer shot than Barron, maybe, as someone would have needed to operate a film camera in those days, but I’m betting it’s a possibility.\n\n**A complete season stat sheet for the 2002 CHS softball team, which went 24-3 and finished 3rd at the state tourney, winning four of five games at the big dance.\n\nLed by Sarah Mouw, Ashley Ellsworth-Bagby, and Erica Lamb, the Wolves only loss at state came in the semis to the eventual state champs, Adna, who captured the sixth title in program history.\n\nWhen I went through News-Times articles of the day during the 2017 season, when that year’s softball sluggers made a run at matching their predecessors, I was able to recreate, after a fashion, 24 of the 27 games.\n\nBut the paper, for reasons unknown, completely omitted any write-ups on three mid-season games, and only gave a general overview of stats for the games covered.\n\nIf it’s still out there, a complete look at the stats compiled by the 16 Wolves who suited up in ’02 would be a nice find.\n\n**An interview with Jeff Fielding, the first CHS athlete to win a state title, back in 1979.\n\nEight Wolves have brought home the ultimate prize, combining for 17 championships.\n\nNatasha Bamberger (1985) and Tyler King (2010) won cross country crowns, while the same duo joined Kyle King, Jon Chittim, Chris Hutchinson, Amy Mouw, Steven McDonald, and Fielding as track champs.\n\nEight of Coupeville’s 15 track titles have come in the 3200, with Bamberger and Kyle King each winning three times, and Tyler King and Fielding striking gold once.\n\nToss in three wins in the 1600 (one each for the King boys and Bamberger), plus titles in the 200 and 400 (Chittim), 800 (Mouw), and 4 x 400 (McDonald, Hutchinson, Chittim, Kyle King) and those eight athletes form Coupeville’s Mount Rushmore.\n\nI’ve spoken, in person or by email, some more frequently than others, with every one of those eight except the trailblazer.\n\nNot every former Wolf athlete (or some current ones) want to talk about their prep sports careers.\n\nIf that’s the case with Fielding, no worries.\n\nBut if he should ever want to look back on the first-ever Wolf state title, and his own enduring legacy, I’m here, ready to listen.\n\nHave any of the things I’m looking for, or something else you think would make a great story?
