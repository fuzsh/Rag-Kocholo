        "text": "onedef92\n\nI know she has gambling (among other money problems), but man! She really looked bad this week on Hawaii Five-O.\n\nShe was such a hottie back in the day on NYPD Blue, too....\n\nACTRESS GAIL O'GRADY: GAMBLING HER LIFE AWAY\n\nBy LizReports on June 21, 2011\n\nIn a Los Angeles court, with attorney Shelly Heimanson Newman, of the law firm Voss, Silverman and Braybrooke, a Beverly HIlls business owner Malika Shamir accused actress Gail O'Grady of felony theft, and committing perjury by making up a story of being stalked in 2010 to cover up an affair O'Grady is having with the woman's husband of 23 years, Josef Shamir of \"Joe's Gold and Silver\" located in Los Angeles, Beverly HIlls and Encino.\n\nIn divorce hearings between the Shamir's, the veteran actress is accused of embezzling money, tax evading, (Malika Shamir is also a co-owner of Joe's Gold and Silver), also filing false police reports all for Gail O'Grady's continued alleged gambling exploits.\n\nThe pawn shop love affair allegedly began in April of 2009 when Ms. O'Grady approached Josef Shamir to hawk off her jewelry and handbags, a sexual relationship began and O'Grady persuaded Shamir to open another \"Joe's and Gold Silver\" in Encino, California with O'Grady as the co-owner without the knowledge of Shamir's wife or family, state of California or the IRS. And get this, the store is managed and ran by Gail O'Grady ex-husband number \"3\" â€” former actor Jeffrey Byron.\n\nMonths after opening the business, O'Grady allegedly embezzled money and blew it at the casinos. The money in question was raised throughout the summer and fall of 2009 at her home, presented as \"Cash for Gold Fundraising Parties\" for the Beverly Hills School District and her ex-husband number \"4\" - Steven Fenton. When confronted by the Shamirs', O'Grady then went to her friend Steve Church to pay off the debt. Church and O'Grady were close friends, dated, spent a lot of time with each other and her son.\n\nIn January of 2010, in an outrageous attempt to cover up the truth, O'Grady accused Steve Church of stalking, threatening, harassing her, her son, agent and manager. Although police never charged or even questioned Church, O'Grady was able to obtain a civil restraining order in a bizarre court hearing. O'Grady's stalking and harrassment story was later found to be a complete fabrication.\n\nNow O'Grady is crying wolf to the Beverly HIlls Police claiming Mrs. Shamir is doing the stalking. No charges were brought against Malika Shamir. However during divorce hearings the judge ordered for a \"forensic audit\" of the earnings and cash Gail O'Grady and Josef Shamir had been allegedly swindling from the family gold business, Gail O'Grady and her alleged lover visited various places, such as weekend stays at the Huntley Hotel in Santa Monica, Casino Marango just outside of Los Angeles and Caesars in Las Vegas. (O'Grady reportedly owed $210,000 to casinos in 2008.)\n\nTImes have not been good for the former NYPD Blue and American Dreams actress, O'Grady received notice that her series, Hellcats on CW is canceled. Now word comes down the court possesses every detail of Gail O'Grady's activity over the past two years including explicit texts, emails, videos, photos and financial records.\n\nIn the court proceedings there were several unruly outburst by O'Grady's self represented boyfriend Josef Shamir, the judge stated, \"Mr. Shamir, you are not so bright, I do not like your mouth, I suggest you return with a good lawyer.\"\n\nJosef Shamir and Gail O'Grady will soon have to answer the judge or a criminal investigation will be underway.\n\nhttp://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m111/onedef92/n_c2RgDI8_il.jpg\n\nNow....\n\nhttp://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i306/jillianhallfan/Graphics%20and%20Stuff/gail-ogrady.jpg\n\nIn Better Times...."
