        "text": "Revenge alumna Gail O’Grady and Sons of Anarchy‘s Jeff Kober are set for lead roles alongside Jane Seymour in CMT’s soapy, comedic pilot His Wives and Daughters.\n\nCreated and produced by Dina Chapman and Steve Sessions, the project centers on the eclectic and cunning wives and daughters of larger-than-life country music legend (and infamous womanizer) Eddie Ray Banks (Kober). After his estranged family is brought together unexpectedly, tempers flare and old rivalries resurface, setting the stage for startling secrets to emerge as an unforgettable mystery begins to unfold.\n\nKober’s Banks became a crossover sensation in the 70s with a No. 1 album and hit movie, in addition to his television variety show. His tabloid-worthy personal life and relationships contributed to his fame just as much as his work achievements. In a career spanning almost 50 years Eddie always had a big heart, but his good intentions were ruined by hard-living.\n\nO’Grady plays Donna Banks, Eddie’s vain and materialistic second wife who worked with him on his 1970s variety show and then stole him away from first wife, Lorna (Seymour). She has a codependent relationship with her daughter Carolyn.\n\nProduction on His Wives & Daughters is scheduled to begin in January and additional casting will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nKnown for her long-running role on NYPD Blue, O’Grady recently guest-starred on Fresh Off the Boat, Training Day, and Code Black. She’s repped by APA and Shelter Entertainment Group. Kober recently recurred on Shameless, The Walking Dead, New Girl, and Sons of Anarchy. He’s repped by Stone Manners Salners Agency, DiSante Frank & Company, and attorney Mark Johnson."
