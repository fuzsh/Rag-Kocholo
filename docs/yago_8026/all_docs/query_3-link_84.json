        "text": "The fact that so many beautiful woman participated on the iconic series is pretty ironic considering the title “Two and a Half Men”, it definitely wouldn’t have been nearly as entertaining or funny without them.\n\nSuch entertainment brought audiences to turn in week after week, curious to find out which famous woman actress Charlie would target next, adding some elements of drama and insanity every now and then. we’ve prepared a list of some of the best (and worst) women that made appearances on the show and where they are today!\n\nJennifer Taylor as Chelsea Melini | Then\n\nChelsea Melini had the great honor of being the first woman Charlie ever confessed his love to without any prompting. Though he says it nearly by accident, he still claims that he meant it later on. In the beginning, Charlie just saw Chelsea as another one-night stand but along the way, he realized he was developing serious feelings for her.\n\nAfter a pretty rocky relationship, Charlie decides to prove his love for her by proposing, thinking that he can get her to say “I love you” back to him. Unfortunately, Chelsea ends up leaving him for Alan’s lawyer. What a blow to the ego!\n\nJennifer Taylor as Chelsea Melini | Now\n\nThe American actress, now married to Paul Taylor, continued on with her acting career after her appearance on the show, subsequently being involved in other television shows and films. Most recently, she appeared the Shameless, a series focusing on a fiercely loyal Chicago family.\n\nShe also has two upcoming shows still in post-production, Unfaithful and A Deadly Romance.\n\nHolland Taylor as Evelyn Harper | Then\n\nArguably one of the funniest characters on the show, Evelyn Harper, played by Holland Taylor, was Alan and Charlie’s neglectful mother. The show exhibited Evelyn’s difficult relationship she had with both of her sons who tried their best to avoid her as much as possible. Such tension in the show really made for some great entertainment, having viewers busting their guts laughing.\n\nThe script writes also made sure to add some more bang to her character by making her that woman who got with older men for their money and assets.\n\nHolland Taylor as Evelyn Harper | Now\n\nToday, Taylor is powering through the age of 75, still well-recognized for famous television roles that include Ruth Dunbar in Bosom Buddies, Judge Roberta Kittleson in The Practice, and of course, Evelyn Harper-Pepper in Two and a Half Men.\n\nWith her exceptional talent, she continues to nail acting jobs across the industry such as roles in The Orville, Hollywood Mom, and Mr. Mercedes.\n\nKelly Stables as Melissa | Then\n\nMelissa was the recurring character throughout the show, playing as Alan Harper’s receptionist. Eventually, Charlie was able to get her to all for him until she began a relationship with Alan.\n\nThe two eventually encounter some tribulations when Melissa finds out that Alan is lying about renting a home. Eventually, Melissa is humiliatingly dumped after Alan decides to end the toxic relationship for good over a text.\n\nKelly Stables as Melissa | Now\n\nKelly Stables has landed a tremendous amount of acting roles over the course of her career. She even appeared in the hit comedy movie, Horrible Bosses 2, starring Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis, and Steve Wiebe.\n\nShe is currently working as a recurring character on the television show, Superstore, an American sitcom that follows the lives of a group of employees working at a fictional big-box store in Missouri. She is also enjoying the married life with her husband, Kurt Patino, both raising their only son.\n\nApril Bowlby as Kandi | Then\n\nKandi is the young woman portrayed as a 22-year-old dumbbell. Though she may seem sweet and somewhat innocent, Kandi is pretty dense and loves to sleep with older men, like Charlie Harper, of course. Because of her dashing looks and particularly large breasts, Kandi gets the attention of many, including Charlie.\n\nShe ends up finding her way into not just Charlie’s arms, but those of Alan’s and Alan’s former lawyer as well! She ends up choosing and marrying Alan in Vegas but eventually breaks up with him after accepting a role as an investigative reporter on a television show titled “Stiffs”. Although, Alan’s nose hair and ear hair were probably among her reasons for her leaving him.\n\nApril Bowlby as Kandi | Now\n\nApril Bowlby is still very much active in her acting career, much like many of the other women on the list. She appeared on many television series that includes CSI, The Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother, and Drop Dead Diva. She also has done some work in films such as Love Me Or Else and Reunion.\n\nAside from her drop-dead looks, the actress also gained some popularity over her relationship with the well-known singer, Josh Groban.\n\nCourtney Thorne-Smith as Lyndsey McElroy | Then\n\nComing off as the slightly masculine girl who enjoys drinking beer, Lyndsey was the character that kept popping up on the show as Alan’s on and off lover. Constantly deliriously drunk, her drinking problem became apparent when she was caught vomiting all over the interior of Walden’s private jet. Yikes!\n\nThough she has deep care and love for Alan, Lyndsey is seen as a considerably flirty, lusting after men including Walden, played by Ashton Kutcher.\n\nCourtney Thorne-Smith as Lyndsey McElroy | Now\n\nAfter five years of playing the role of Lyndsey on the show, Courtney Thorne-Smith took a break from the fast paced-lifestyle of Hollywood. Although, she recently voiced a character on the animated series, Robot Chicken, and even appeared on Fresh Off The Boat, ABC’s hit comedy show.\n\nAside from her acting career, Thorne-Smith enjoys spending her time with her husband, Roger Fishman, and their son, Jacob.\n\nMegan Fox as Prudence | Then\n\nIn the season 1 episode, Berta shares that she can’t leave her granddaughter, Prudence, alone in a house and ends up bringing her to Charlie’s beach house. Her gorgeous looks and sexy figure leaves all of the men, including Jake, completely smitten.\n\nShe then comes back in the night after a dispute with her grandmother, surprising Charlie, Alan, and Jake with her shocking plans of eloping with her boyfriend to get married in Vegas. Her plan is eventually dismantled when her mother Cheryl Ann interrupts the ordeal.\n\nMegan Fox as Prudence | Now\n\nProbably one of the biggest stars on this list, Megan Fox continued on to a remarkable career with her major success in Hollywood after her cameo on the show. She was able to land a role in Hope & Faith and was even cast in the extremely famed Steven Spielberg film, Transformers.\n\nShe most recently appears on the hit comedy television series, New Girl. Although, these days, it seems that she has particularly slowed down on her television and film appearances.\n\nEmmanuelle Vaugier as Mia | Then\n\nEmmanuelle Vaugier played the character named Mia, a dance teacher who supposedly had no interest in Charlie. It was only up until Charlie announced that he had a nephew, Jake, who really enjoyed dancing, that Mia gave a chance to him. Much to his dismay, Mia had pretty harsh demands, forcing him to give up eating meat, smoking, drinking, and the worst of them all - having sex. Charlie deceives her into agreeing to do all of these things, secretly continuing them behind her back.\n\nUltimately, the two almost get married but Mia decides to end it after Charlie discloses that there isn’t any chance that his brother would move out of his beach house.\n\nEmmanuelle Vaugier as Mia | Now\n\nCanadian actress, singer, and model, Emmanuelle Vaugier, continued on to nail several acting jobs after her appearance on the show. From appearing in television shows like Lost Girl and Mistresses, Vaugier continues to work hard in having her career bloom.\n\nShe recently starred in a television movie, Killer Ending, and is set to appear in My Mother’s Stalker, Masks Don’t Lie, and Don’t Look There.\n\nMarin Hinkle as Judith Harper-Melnick | Then\n\nJudith was Alan’s first wife, daughter of Lenore and Sheldon, and the biological mother of Jake Harper and Milly Melnick. Their marriage turned out to be so cold that she mentions that the only time she ever felt happy being sexual was when she was pregnant with Jake. Ouch!\n\nLater on in the series, they eventually end their marriage and Judith moves on to remarrying Dr. Herb Melnick, Jake’s pediatrician.\n\nMarin Hinkle as Judith Harper-Melnick | Now\n\nMarin Hinkle, now 51 years old, still continues to develop her acting career. Aside from appearing in the dramatic series, Madam Secretary, on CBS, she also appeared on the shows, Speechless and Homeland. She continues on headstrong into her craft as she just wrapped up a movie called Before/During/After.\n\nJust as her career is successful, her marriage with Randall Sommer is as well.\n\nAllison Janney as Beverly | Then\n\nBeverly was the woman that Alan met on a dating network. In hopes of impressing her, Alan tricks her into thinking that the beach house was solely his. But after feeling bad about her issues of divorce, Alan eventually admits that the house is actually Charlie’s.\n\nLuckily for Alan, Beverly understands as she had problems way worse than he did. Well, it turns out that her demons were way bigger than he expected. Charlie walked in on Alan and found him tied up to his bed! Freaky!\n\nAllison Janney as Beverly | Now\n\nWe’re pretty sure you recognize Allison Janney from one of her television or movie appearances. She’s actually a highly prolific character actress who is revered for her versatility. She has appeared on hit films like Hairspray, Juno, and The Girl on the Train. Yup, that’s probably why she looks familiar to you!\n\nHer work on screen, stage and television have received the acclaim that brought her numerous accolades, including seven Primetime Emmy Awards, an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award, just to name a few. Impressive!\n\nBrooke Shields as Danielle Stewart | Then\n\nDanielle was the girl with a partying past. This didn’t seem to stop Charlie from setting her up with Alan. She ended up dating him, believing he would change for her, something she did not receive from her other boyfriends.\n\nHowever, when she mentions to Charlie, “I’ve slept with a lot of guys and even a few women and even with couples”, he suddenly decides he wants to be with Danielle now. The brothers end up fighting over her, causing her to leave.\n\nBrooke Shields as Danielle Stewart | Now\n\nBrooke Shields was already a recognized actress and model before she had appeared on the show. Already receiving a lead role at the young age of 12, Brooke had continued on to book major roles in shows and films such as The Blue Lagoon, Endless Love, and a recurring role in NBC’s Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\n\nShe also received two Golden Globe nominations for her performance on the NBC sitcom, Suddenly Susan.\n\nJeri Ryan as Sherri | Then\n\nThough Charlie had seemed to have gone through all kinds of women, Sherri was the kind of girl he never encountered before. She was a woman skilled at playing hard to get, constantly leading Charlie on into having sex with her.\n\nBut because he was considered the one being used, Charlie decided he wanted to seek revenge. This ultimately led to their downfall.\n\nJeri Ryan as Sherri | Now\n\nJeri Ryan is a German-born American actress who is best known for her role on Star Trek: Voyager, for which she earned and won four nominations for a Saturn Award. She is also known for her performances on several television series such as Boston Public, Dark Skies, and Shark.\n\nThe talented actress is currently in the works for her next film, The Relic.\n\nKimberly Williams-Paisley as Gretchen Martin | Then\n\nWhen Alan’s ex-girlfriend Lindsey eventually got engaged to another guy named Larry, Alan began dating his sister Gretchen. She becomes a recurring character in the show’s 11th season, keeping a relationship with who she thought was “Jeff Strongman”. This, apparently, was Alan’s alter-ego, an identity that Alan gets very into.\n\nEventually, Gretchen deciphered his lies and breaks up with him, telling him she already experienced all this dishonesty with her ex-husband.\n\nKimberly Williams-Paisley as Gretchen Martin | Now\n\nKimberly Williams-Paisley is best known for her co-starring roles on Nashville and According to Jim. Though she seemed to have slowed down on her acting after the show, she still made guest appearances on television shows, including Tales From The Crypt, George Lopez, and Less Than Perfect.\n\nHer latest project is a film made for the winter season, The Christmas Train. Paisley is probably focusing more on her happy marriage to Brad Paisley.\n\nJudy Greer as Bridget Schmidt | Then\n\nAs we are introduced to Ashton Kutcher’s character, it is revealed that he was deeply heartbroken from his divorce with his ex-wife, Bridget. He, apparently, loved her so deeply that he was even willing to take his own life, knowing she didn’t want to take him back.\n\nThough she initially refuses to reconcile with him due to his immaturity, she somehow changes her mind when she finds out he started dating another girl. She then comes to the beach house begging for him to take her back, to which Walden responds with a finalization of their divorce. Ouch!\n\nJudy Greer as Bridget Schmidt | Now\n\nYou’ve probably seen Judy Greer in many shows and films already as the actress has an astoundingly long filmography list. The actress, director, model, and author is well known as a character actor, appearing in a wide variety of dramatic and comedic films.\n\nShe’s also well-respected for her voiceover work in animated shows such as StoryBots and Archer. Judy’s most recent and popular work can be seen in the hit films, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Halloween, and Driven.\n\nSophie Winkleman as Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce | Then\n\nZoey was known as the gorgeous British ex-girlfriend that Walden got really serious with after his divorce with Bridget. After dating for two seasons, Zoey actually could have been Walden’s fiancée, if it were not for her rejection of his marriage proposal. Walden then discovers that Zoey had been dating another man behind her back and decides to seek revenge.\n\nHe ended up leaving her daughter Zoey a ferocious and violent dog for her birthday in hopes of getting back at Zoey and her new lover. That’s some straight up bitterness right there!\n\nSophie Winkleman as Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce | Now\n\nSomething particularly surprising about this British beauty is that she is actually considered royalty! Sophie Winkleman is the wife of Lord Frederick Windsor, son of Prince Michael of Kent, the late Queen Elizabeth II’s first cousin.

Unfortunately, Charlie’s character dies before they are able to tie the knot.\n\nMelanie Lynskey as Rose | Now\n\nMelanie Jayne Lynskey is a New Zealand actress known for her portrayals of being the soft-spoken, quirky, and flawed character.

She first met Charlie after Alan planned a double date involving his brother. Although Charlie was really fond of her, Linda actually found him repulsive for his lecherous nature.\n\nThe entertainment ensued when Charlie was caught drunk driving and ended up in court, embarrassed to see Linda as the judge. After some time, Linda decides to end it after Charlie embarrasses her at her awarding ceremony.\n\nMing-Na Wen as Linda Harris | Now\n\nMing-Na-Wen was actually famously known for being the voice of the Disney character Mulan.

Because Charlie broke his promise of making himself available to her whenever she wanted, Laura took revenge by ruining Judith and Alan’s divorce proceedings.\n\nAlan ended up letting her go and hired a new lawyer instead.\n\nHeather Locklear as Laura | Now\n\nHeather Locklear was already an accomplished television actress before she made an appearance on the show. She was most notable for her roles on Spin City and Melrose Place. Though she’s gained recognition as an actress, Locklear still had her fair share of public drama and controversy.\n\nShe went through a very publicized divorce and went through numerous health issues.

She is first seen looking for Kandi in Charlie’s House, eventually ending up having sex with Charlie the entire day.

She went on to booking lead roles in a number of television movies and her career ended up going so well that she was even nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award three times.\n\nHer personal life, though, is another story. Gail went through 6 marriages, with all of them failing. Though, she still seems to believe in love as she is currently dating Chris Beyers.\n\nPaula Marshall as Paula | Then\n\nAfter meeting at a nightclub, Paula and Alan really seemed to hit it off. Paula eventually felt comfortable enough to reveal that she was actually once a man named Paul. Fortunately for her, Alan didn’t seem bothered by it and continued on to a relationship with her.\n\nIt all ends up getting weird and messy when Paula tells Alan that she wants to be in an open relationship after he meets her ex-wife Rachel. Alan then sees the two kissing each other, eventually ending up with them trying at their relationship again. Poor Alan!\n\nPaula Marshall as Paula | Now\n\nPaula Marshall continues to thrive in her acting career, appearing in hit shows like House, Law and Order, Murder in the First, The Mentalist, and Switched at Birth.

Not even for his elementary school teacher! Miss Pasternak was Charlie’s fifth-grade teacher who suspended Jake for giving her the finger. The two shockingly began dating, with Miss Pasternak lifting his suspension and even giving him good grades without rightfully earning them!\n\nWhen Charlie realized that she was mentally ill though, he ended up dumping her.\n\nMissi Pyle as Miss Pasternak | Now\n\nAndrea Kay Pyle, or more popularly known as Missi Pyle, is an actress and singer has appeared in several films, including some award-winning films such as The Artist, Big Fish, 50 First Dates, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Gone Girl.

In regret, Alan apologizes and says he will give her back, but Charlie thinks it’s too late.\n\nThough the two keep seeing each other, Alan eventually feels uncomfortable and goes home. Upon coming home, he sees Charlie with Charity who deviously tells Alan, “now we’re even”. Burn!\n\nJustine Eyre as Gabrielle | Now\n\nThe stunning Canadian actress and model, Justin Eyre, has made a few more television appearances after the show.

Struck by jealousy and regret, Charlie tries winning her back by pretending he has changed into a family-oriented man. Lisa ends up divorcing her husband for Charlie but is once again dumped because of his fear of commitment.\n\nDenise Richards as Lisa | Now\n\nDenise Richards is definitely a unique addition to this list as she was actually married to Charlie Sheen in real life!

She is definitely considered a fan favorite!\n\nConchata Ferrell as Berta | Now\n\nConchata Ferrell is well known for her character work, receiving two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for her exceptional performances.

Talk about lavish needs!\n\nCharlie then proposes to her but ends up not pushing through with the marriage after finding out that her real name is Sylvia and her parents are con-artists in reality. That’s some pretty sketchy stuff right there.\n\nJenny McCarthy as Courtney Leopold | Now\n\nJenny McCarthy, sometimes credited as Jenny Wahlberg, is an actress, activist, model, television host, author, and screenwriter. The bombshell was actually very well known for being a nude model for Playboy magazine way before she appeared on the show.

Although all her tattoos may say otherwise, Tammy is actually a soft and good-hearted woman.\n\nIt’s no wonder she felt absolutely torn and betrayed when she found out that Jake had sex with Tammy’s daughter, Ashley. That indeed was a little too far!\n\nJaime Pressly as Tammy | Now\n\nJaime Pressly went on to achieve remarkable success in her career after appearing on the show. She was actually best known for her role as Lola Sombrero in The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure, bagging two Emmy Award nominations, as well as a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award!\n\nShe then appeared in hit films such as Not Another Teen Movie, DOA: Dead or Alive, and I Love You, Man.\n\nKrista Allen as Olivia Pearson | Now\n\nKrista Allen is a comedian and actress, moving on to being renowned for her appearances in the television series, Days of Our Lives and Baywatch.

Upon meeting him, Kate finds it hilarious that Charlie appeared to look wasted and eventually starts hitting it off with conversations.\n\nShe made another appearance on the show but as Charlie’s dermatologist, Michelle. The scene ends up being absolutely priceless when she is seen removing a mole off of Charlie’s behind. The two begin to date until Michelle finds out about Charlie’s other woman.\n\nLiz Vassey as Kate McLaughlin | Now\n\nIt was probably peculiar for Liz Vassey to be cast twice as different characters but who’s complaining?\n\nSince her appearance on the show, Vassey continued to work on others show such as the web series, Nikki & Nora.
