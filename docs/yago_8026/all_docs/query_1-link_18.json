But when Mike is trapped with a local boy in a storm drain and is in danger of drowning, Steve is forced to admit to Mitch that he kidnapped his son because he is in a custody battle with his ex-wife. Meanwhile, Craig is forced to decide by his demanding law firm boss between being a lifeguard, or staying at the law firm. But Gina suggests to him a third option: open up his own law firm."
