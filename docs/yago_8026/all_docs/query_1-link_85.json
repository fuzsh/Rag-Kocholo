In her free time, she enjoyed breakfast dates with Gene, outings to a casino, and keeping up with children and grandchildren via Facebook.

She was our best friend. She was simultaneously the definition of grace filled beauty and elegance. She was a listener and an even better teacher. She led by example with her strength and wisdom.
