He wasn't really the bad guy here. Good movie, excellent cast with Dale Midkiff of the Love Cones Softly movies. 4 1/2 stars.\n\n1 of 2 member(s) found this review helpful.\n\nMAURICE V. from WOODSTOCK, GA\n\nReviewed on 9/1/2010...\n\nGood chic movie.You will love it.\n\n1 of 1 member(s) found this review helpful.\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nLisa Rinna & Gail O'Grady share the same man (w/o knowing)!\n\n04/26/2002\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Lisa Rinna and Gail O'Grady become best friends..not realizing that they share the same man! Both women perform very well in this movie...I have been a big fan of both of them since Melrose Place and NYPD Blue. Sally Kirkland also does a great job in this movie as Gail O'Grady's mother. This movie is filled with so many different ingredients: intrigue, lessons on overcoming fears, and it helps one become stronger in believing inside what can truly make your life happy. I've seen it a few times, and enjoy it more each time.\"\n\nYou can't help but watch\n\nDonald D. Coney, Jr. | Fairfax, va United States | 08/04/2006\n\n(3 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Guilty, guilty, the guiltiest of pleasures. I have to admit (and I'm not in any way shape or form proud of this) I love this movie. Yeah, the plot is contrived. The acting, when it isn't over the top is almost painfully stilted and forced but it is just great fun. However, on the up side, Gail O'Grady spends half the movie in a tight fitting swim suit.\n\nDon't expect a masterpiece. This movie is straight off the Lifetime Movie Channel so, of course, the schmuck husband (Midkiff) is a no damn good cheating liar. This guy has almost no redeeming qualities at all. And his stupidly transparent efforts to juggle a clingy wife (O'Grady) and his new girlfriend (Rinna) are so inept you just can't help but get sucked in.\n\nThis movie is good fun to watch, especially on a rainy weekend when you have an hour or two to kill.\n\n\"\n\nTypical TV Movie\n\nDonald D. Coney, Jr. | 04/26/2004\n\n(4 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"It is indeed. A boring housewife/swimming instructor, Gail O'Grady, makes friends with a Psychologist, Lisa Rinna (you know, the one with the lips) while teaching her to swim as she tried to come to terms with her brother drowning years before (phew). However, Rinna is dating O'Grady's husband, Dale Midkiff, in his usual husband gone bad role.O'Grady is very good, Rinna is her usual stilted self and Midkiff plays his part admirably. Not a bad story. Both find out about each other and, in typical feminist style which really belongs to the early 90s, they kick the husband into touch, telling him to hit the highway while they go back to being best chums.Not bad, but not really worth buying unless you're a bit fan of the three leads. Although saying this, would you kick Dale out of bed for eating potato chips? No, I didn't think so.\"\n\nAnother Woman's Husband\n\nDaycare Provider | Cincinnati, OH USA | 08/03/2006\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"I love Lisa Rinna. Two best friends find out they are in love with the same man has to be heart breaking. They learned something from one another.\""
