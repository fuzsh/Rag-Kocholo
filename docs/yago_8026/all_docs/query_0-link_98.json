According to the Enquirer, she’s tragically addicted to gambling. When she was young, Gail, who’s now 45 and still gorgeous, always had wealthy boyfriends who took her to Las Vegas and indulged her bad habit. After she became a successful actress, her addiction escalated and she’s declared bankruptcy for the second time in fifteen years. She’s obsessed with blackjack, video poker and slots. Gail’s mired in debt and owes money to casinos, credit card companies, the IRS, her mortgage company, and all her friends! Her estranged fifth husband says “Gail makes a great living but not enough to support her gambling habit!” Who knew?\n\nAbout The Author"
