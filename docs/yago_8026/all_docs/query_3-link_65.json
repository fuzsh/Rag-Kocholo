        "text": "By Dave Mason\n\nGail O'Grady got her wish.\n\n&quot;There's a lot of Christmas movies, but I've never been in one,&quot; said the star known for &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and &quot;American Dreams.&quot;\n\nThat will change tonight when O'Grady stars in &quot;All I Want for Christmas,&quot; airing at 9 on the Hallmark Channel. She plays Sarah Armstrong, a single mother who's always giving to others and rarely thinks of herself. Her young son Jesse (Jimmy &quot;Jax&quot; Pinchak) is just like her. He has one wish for Christmas: a husband for his mom.\n\n&quot;I love the holidays. I grew up watching all those (Christmas) movies,&quot; O'Grady said.\n\nIn addition, &quot;I liked the idea this was Hallmark and would be of Hallmark quality,&quot; O'Grady said in a recent phone interview while her real-life 3-year-old son, Michael, sat quietly next to her.\n\n&quot;It's important to have shows you can watch with your family; my son can watch it,&quot; said O'Grady, a 44-year-old Detroit native.\n\nIn fact, Michael got to be one of the children in the background for one scene, but it was cut from the film, she said.\n\nEntertaining, not preaching\n\nThe family tone of the movie drew O'Grady to it, and she said she's glad if viewers pick up a message from the story. But she said she wasn't trying to teach a moral.\n\n&quot;I don't choose the films I do to teach a lesson. I don't know what the lesson would be,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm here to entertain.&quot;\n\nO'Grady, who now lives in Los Angeles, is spending the holidays with her family, including her parents, who come from Chicago each year to see her.\n\nLike her character in the Hallmark movie, O'Grady isn't currently married. She has been divorced four times.\n\nBesides her Hallmark movie, she has stayed busy. O'Grady, a fan of producer David E. Kelley's shows, has had a recurring role as Judge Gloria Weldon on his &quot;Boston Legal.&quot;\n\n&quot;It's a hoot to be on the set,&quot; she said about the ABC show. &quot;It's hard to keep a straight face around William Shatner (who plays quirky law firm partner Denny Crane). It's one of my favorite places to work.&quot;\n\nO'Grady's guest-starring roles have included Sen. Finch on the new CBS drama &quot;Cane,&quot; Mrs. Towne on the network's &quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; and Miranda St. Claire on the USA network's &quot;Monk.&quot; She starred as Karen Hardy on this year's short-lived CW series &quot;Hidden Palms.&quot; In 2005, she played Ava Summerlin on the ABC real estate sitcom &quot;Hot Properties.&quot; Her movies have varied from &quot;Sex and the Single Mom&quot; (2003 on TV) to &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot; (1999 in the theaters).\n\nFor her 2002-05 NBC drama &quot;American Dreams,&quot; O'Grady took a time warp to play Helen Pryor, whose daughter becomes a regular dancer on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in Philadelphia in the 1960s.\n\nO'Grady declined to elaborate on the messages of the show, in which Helen's oldest son fought in Vietnam. &quot;The only parallel I would make (to modern times) is that they were both unpopular wars,&quot; she said about Vietnam and Iraq.\n\nEmmy-nominated role\n\nBefore &quot;American Dreams,&quot; O'Grady played police squad secretary Donna Abandando from 1993 to 1996 on &quot;NYPD Blue.&quot;\n\nShe received three Emmy nominations for the role and said fans continue to recognize her today as Donna. &quot;It's one of the shows that people never get over,&quot; she said.\n\n&quot;When NYPD Blue' came out, this was groundbreaking television. It changed the face of television,&quot; O'Grady said. &quot;I was always looking for different characters, and Donna was definitely different.&quot;\n\nAnother plus was the fact that O'Grady was a fan of the works of Stephen Bochco, who co-created &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; with David Milch."
