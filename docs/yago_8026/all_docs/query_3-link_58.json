        "text": "Gail O’Grady (NYPD Blue) is set as a series regular opposite Rebecca Breeds and Parker Sawyers in NBC’s drama pilot Miranda’s Rights. Written/co-executive produced by Katie Lovejoy and executive produced by John Glenn, Miranda’s Rights is a one-hour legal soap about an idealistic group of lawyers — Young Law Group — who not only work together but live together at their start-up firm. The story centers on Miranda Coale (Breeds), a pretty and smart attorney plagued for the past six years by a youthful mistake — a much-publicized and scandalous affair in her early 20s with a married state Senator which changed the course of her life forever. O’Grady will play Karen Klein, a whip-smart, formidable career woman who is head of the Klein & Associates law firm. O’Grady’s credits include starring roles in NBC series NYPD Blue, which earned her three consecutive supporting actress Emmy nominations, and American Dreams. She also recurred on ABC’s Revenge and next will be seen in upcoming TV movie The Right Girls. O’Grady is repped by APA and Shelter Entertainment Group.\n\nChristine Horn has booked a series regular role in ABC’s untitled Weeks/Mackay comedy pilot. Written by The Mindy Project co-star Ed Weeks & Hannah Mackay (Peep Show) and directed by Leslye Headland, the single-camera project centers on lesbian Hilda and her best friend Randall (Ridings), a neurotic straight guy, as they navigate their dysfunctional, co-dependent friendship and the world of dating. Horn will play Gail, a slightly pretentious ex-lawyer who gave up the rat race to open a bar in Austin with her girlfriend, where she mothers everybody. Horn’s TV credits include Complications and Tyler Perry’s The Haves and Have Nots. Horn is repped by The Hybrid Agency and Entertainment Lab."
