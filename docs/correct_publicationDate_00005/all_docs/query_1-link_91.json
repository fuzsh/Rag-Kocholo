        "text": "Science Fiction Dark Fantasy Author David J Rodger Highlights His Landmark Third Novel\n\nIron Man Project\n\nBy David J Rodger\n\n.\n\nFast-paced, action-packed novel that spans numerous countries and a fantastic array of skilfully crafted characters.\n\n.\n\nGREAT BOOKS ARE HARD TO FIND. SHOP TODAY!\n\n.\n\n“The universe Rodger has built is his own and with each book the lore gets richer, deeper and more compelling. The tight cast of characters play off each other well, strong dialogue and surprising twists with the interpersonal dynamics keeps the reader turning the pages”\n\n.\n\n“Really engaging characters and plenty of pace. ‘Unputdownable’ is such an overused phrase, but this is in that category.”\n\n.\n\nDavid J Rodger launches back onto the near-future thriller stage with Iron Man Project. Building on the shared universe born out of the popular hits Dante’s Fool and God Seed.\n\nIron Man Project sees Rodger step away from all supernatural horror, but stick with the gritty, brutal realism his work is known for, in this story about the private wars fought between rival groups of corporations. It is about the people who make the armies, who fund and command them, and about the victims at all levels.\n\nJean-Luc Korda, Head of Security for the Carthew Family – a corporate clan that spans the globe in influence and who have a significant presence in Rodger’s universe. Vincent Brent, ex-military gundog now doing grunt work for a European crime-syndicate, and looking for any way out, looking for a better role to play. Karl Grech, war merchant and corporate spy with a secret he’ll kill for to keep silent. Camille Kuehnhert, a woman enslaved by fear of failure and the accoutrements of success, who must face her demons to escape or die trying. And Lucy, a mysterious young woman on the run from her violent past and the catalyst for the collapse of the house of cards this story wraps around.\n\nImportantly, the novel includes Joachim Marlow, an agent for the “Power of Eight Group” and provides an introduction to this quasi-mystical business cult (featured heavily in Dog Eat Dog and The Social Club).\n\nDavid J. Rodger is a British author of science fiction dark fantasy with eight novels under his belt. He is also the creator of Yellow Dawn – The Age of Hastur, an RPG that blends Cthulhu Mythos and Cyberpunk themes into a post-apocalyptic setting. His books are often described as intense, character driven, near-future thrillers. Compared to Ian Rankin / Colin Dexter and James Ellroy with a dose of Stephen King darkness, Rodger’s work crosses many boundaries to deliver a new and exciting fusion of ideas and genres. You never quite know what waits around the next corner. All his books are stand-alone but support each other as part of a consistent shared universe allowing you to build a deeper knowledge with every story.\n\nIf you enjoy a complex plot that is woven together with the taught, personal motivations of a myriad of stormy characters, then Iron Man Project belongs on your “must read” list.\n\nSHOP TODAY\n\n.\n\nShop with LULU Global\n\nShop with Amazon UK ¦ USA ¦ DE\n\nShop with Kindle UK ¦ USA ¦ DE\n\n."
