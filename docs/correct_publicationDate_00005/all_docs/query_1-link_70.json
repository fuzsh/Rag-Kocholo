This can be achieved through cross-functional projects, team-building activities, social events, or virtual platforms that facilitate informal interactions and knowledge sharing.\n\n(5) Enhance Sense of Belonging:\n\nOrganizations can enhance the sense of belonging by aligning employees with the company’s values and purpose.
