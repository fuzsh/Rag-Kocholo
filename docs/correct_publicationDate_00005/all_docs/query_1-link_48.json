Now, nine years later, the sanctuary he found working in the corporate world might come to an end due to the mountain of calls from his old pack coming into his office phone.\n\nThe alphaâs actions have turned violent and, as his brother, the pack is begging Oliver to help. His plan to tune out the pack is ruined by a call from his childhood best friend, Rachel. He canât ignore the pleas for help from his old clan once Rachel shows up in his office. Nor can he ignore that she’s his mate.\n\nOliverâs two worlds clash as he walks back into a battle he never wanted to fight. Only now there is much more on the line.\n\nFor the Good of the Clan is a standalone second chance romance. It is part of the Corporate Shifters series but the books can be read in any order."
