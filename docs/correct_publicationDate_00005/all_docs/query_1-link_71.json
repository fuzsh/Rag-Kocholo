        "text": "FaZe Clan disputed that a de facto merger occurred, contending that Wanderset was dissolved. FaZe Clan also argued that it had no relationship to Wanderset and that the investor agreements related to shares in Wanderset only, not FaZe Clan.\n\nFaZe Clan moved to dismiss the investors’ complaint. Judge Salinger allowed the motion only in part.\n\nTo start, Judge Salinger rejected the investors’ first breach of contract theory. The plain language of the Wanderset agreements, Judge Salinger noted, granted the investors only a conditional right to obtain shares of Wanderset stock if Wanderset were to be legally merged with or into another company. The alleged de facto merger between the companies did not trigger this conditional right, Judge Salinger ruled.\n\nBut Judge Salinger did not dismiss the investors’ second breach of contract theory. The investors, according to Judge Salinger, pleaded facts sufficient to show that FaZe Clan, as the successor entity under a de facto merger, could be liable for Wanderset’s prior liabilities, including alleged breach of the investor agreements. In doing so, Judge Salinger allowed the investors to maintain the following claims:\n\nthat Wanderset breached the agreements by failing to issue Wanderset stock before the merger;\n\nthat if Wanderset had issued stock to the investors, FaZe Clan would have allowed investors to convert their interests into Faze Clan stock; and\n\nthat FaZe Clan is subject to successor liability for consequential damages.\n\nJudge Salinger also allowed the investors’ claim for Wanderset’s breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to go forward. Pursuing that claim, the investors alleged that the merger was intentionally designed as a de facto merger, rather than a legal merger, to deprive the investors of their ability to convert their ownership rights under the agreements and that FaZe Clan could have successor liability for Wanderset’s alleged breach.\n\nThe Business Litigation Session of the Massachusetts Superior Court: BLS-2\n\nDocket Number: 2084CV00254-BLS2\n\nCase Name: Crashfund LLC v. FaZe Clan, Inc.\n\nDate of Decision: June 8, 2020\n\nJudge: Kenneth W. Salinger"
