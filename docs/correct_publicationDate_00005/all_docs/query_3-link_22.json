        "text": "*His standards are too high. I don't think there's a lot to regret in this. After you've read a thousand science fiction novels, another thousand aren't gonna ramp up your practice much.\n\n*There's some danger that you'll become an old-fashioned fogey because you're not reading enough new material, but (a) old people get old-fashioned because that is the human condition and (b) you can pay attention to the zeitgeist of younger writers without reading every word of fiction that they write. You can just listen to them quarreling and get a pretty good idea of where their priorities are.\n\n*Also, although I mostly agree with him about the appeal of \"world-building,\" there's not enough room in a human brain to properly build a world. A whole civilization full of writers who think they are writing non-fiction can't properly build a world. The best they can do is build the cultural zeitgeist of a world. So if you're a Roman classic author like Virgil, Martial or Lucretius, you're gonna have some know-it-all guy like Charles Stross who accurately points out that you haven't said a single word about microbial life, even though everybody around you is dropping dead of disease.\n\n*That's a valid critique, but it doesn't mean science fiction's not working, it's a metaphysical problem about the limits of language and the nature of reality. Stross should feel less guilty about this.\n\nhttp://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/02/why-i-barely-read-sf-these-day.html\n\nWhy I barely read SF these days\n\nBy Charlie Stross\n\nBeing a guy who writes science fiction, people expect me to be well-informed about the current state of the field—as if I'm a book reviewer who reads everything published in my own approximate area.\n\n(This is a little like expecting a bus driver to have an informed opinion on every other form of four-wheeled road-going transport.)\n\nSimilarly, marketing folks keep sending me SF novels in the hope I'll read them and volunteer a cover quote. But over the past decade I've found myself increasingly reluctant to read the stuff they send me: I have a vague sense of dyspepsia, as if I've just eaten a seven course banquet and the waiter is approaching me with a wafer-thin mint.\n\nThis isn't to say that I haven't read a lot of SF over the past several decades. While I'm an autodidact—there are holes in my background—I've read most of the classics of the field, at least prior to the 1990s. But about a decade ago I stopped reading SF short stories, and this past decade I've found very few SF novels that I didn't feel the urge to bail on within pages (or a chapter or two at most). Including works that I knew were going to be huge runaway successes, both popular and commercially successful—but that I simply couldn't stomach.\n\nIt's not you, science fiction, it's me.\n\nLike everyone else, I'm a work in progress. I've changed over the years as I've lived through changing times, and what I focus on in a work of fiction has gradually shifted. Meanwhile, the world in which I interpret a work of fiction has changed. And in the here and now, I find it really difficult to suspend my disbelief in the sorts of worlds other science fiction writers are depicting.\n\nAbout a decade ago, M. John Harrison (whose stories and novels you should totally read, if you haven't already) wrote on his blog:\n\nEvery moment of a science fiction story must represent the triumph of writing over worldbuilding.\n\nWorldbuilding is dull. Worldbuilding literalises the urge to invent. Worldbuilding gives an unnecessary permission for acts of writing (indeed, for acts of reading). Worldbuilding numbs the reader's ability to fulfil their part of the bargain, because it believes that it has to do everything around here if anything is going to get done.\n\nAbove all, worldbuilding is not technically necessary. It is the great clomping foot of nerdism. It is the attempt to exhaustively survey a place that isn't there. A good writer would never try to do that, even with a place that is there.\n\nI recognize the point he's putting in play here: but I (conditionally) disagree. The implicit construction of an artificial but plausible world is what distinguishes a work of science fiction from any other form of literature. It's an alternative type of underpinning to actually-existing reality, which is generally more substantial (and less plausible—reality is under no compulsion to make sense). Note the emphasis on implicit, though. Worldbuilding is like underwear: it needs to be there, but it shouldn't be on display, unless you're performing burlesque. Worldbuilding is the scaffolding that supports the costume to which our attention is directed. Without worldbuilding, the galactic emperor has no underpants to wear with his new suit, and runs the risk of leaving skidmarks on his story.\n\nStorytelling is about humanity and its endless introspective quest to understand its own existence and meaning. But humans are social animals. We exist in a context provided by our culture and history and relationships, and if we're going to write a fiction about people who live in circumstances other than our own, we need to understand our protagonists' social context—otherwise, we're looking at perspective-free cardboard cut-outs. And technology and environment inextricably dictate large parts of that context.\n\nYou can't write a novel of contemporary life in the UK today without acknowledging that almost everybody is clutching a softly-glowing fondleslab that grants instant access to the sum total of human knowledge, provides an easy avenue for school bullies to get at their victims out-of-hours, tracks and quantifies their relationships (badly), and taunts them constantly with the prospect of the abolition of privacy in return for endless emotionally inappropriate cat videos. We're living in a world where invisible flying killer robots murder wedding parties in Kandahar, a billionaire is about to send a sports car out past Mars, and loneliness is a contagious epidemic. We live with constant low-level anxiety and trauma induced by our current media climate, tracking bizarre manufactured crises that distract and dismay us and keep us constantly emotionally off-balance. These things are the worms in the heart of the mainstream novel of the 21st century. You don't have to extract them and put them on public display, but if they aren't lurking in the implied spaces of your story your protagonists will strike a false note, alienated from the very society they are supposed to illuminate.\n\nNow for a personal perspective.... (((etc etc, it's pretty good, I enjoyed reading this even if, oh dear, I haven't read every one of Charles Stross's numerous novels and short stories.)))"
