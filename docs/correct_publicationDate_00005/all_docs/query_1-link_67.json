It is characterised by a firm sense of trust and loyalty and heavily focuses on tradition and heritage.\n\nIn this blog, we shall discuss the various aspects of clan culture, including its advantages, disadvantages and how its elements can be incorporated into modern HRM practices.\n\nSo whether you are an HR professional looking to adapt the features of this type of work culture into your own company or someone just looking for ways to incorporate something different than traditional HR practices, this blog is for you.\n\nSo, let’slet’s dive right in and explore the fascinating world of clan culture!\n\nWhat is Clan Culture?\n\nClan culture is a term used to describe a type of organisational culture typically found in small, medium-sized, or family-owned businesses. It is characterised by a great emphasis on trust, loyalty, tradition, heritage and a sense of familial relations among employees.\n\nHowever, this organisational culture can also be seen in larger companies with a strong sense of community and shared values among employees.\n\nThe business leader is often viewed as a mentor or paternal figure, and all the employees are regarded as family members of the company.\n\nThis organisational culture fosters long-term relationships with all those involved, including employees, customers and suppliers. The power of decision-making is often not focused at the centre but is decentralised, and individual employees and teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy.\n\nClan culture also emphasises working together as a team and collaboration. It is a significant belief that the company’scompany’s success depends significantly on the group’s success.\n\nFeatures of Clan Culture\n\nHere are some key features of clan culture:\n\n1. Loyalty:\n\nLoyalty is a significant feature of this type of organisational culture. A sense of loyalty and trust binds all the employees in the company, and everyone is collectively committed to the organisation.\n\n2.Tradition and heritage:\n\nClan culture greatly emphasises valuing tradition and heritage, and every employee is expected to be respectful and uphold company values and beliefs.\n\n3. Family-like atmosphere:\n\nThis type of organisational culture fosters a family-like atmosphere within the company. All the employees are regarded as family members, and there is a strong sense of support and community.\n\n4. Charismatic leadership:\n\nIn a clan culture, the leader is often a charismatic figure who embodies the values and beliefs of the organisation. The leader is seen as a mentor or even a parental figure to employees.\n\n5. Decentralised decision-making:\n\nDecision-making is often decentralised in a clan culture, with individual employees or teams given high autonomy.\n\n6. Teamwork and collaboration:\n\nThere is a strong emphasis on teamwork and collaboration in a clan culture. The organisation’s success is seen as dependent on the team’s success.\n\n7. Long-term relationships:\n\nClan culture values long-term relationships with employees, customers, and suppliers.\n\n8. Informal communication:\n\nCommunication within a clan culture is often informal, focusing on building personal relationships between employees.\n\nA clan culture values loyalty, tradition, and community and creates a supportive and family-like atmosphere within the organisation. It is often found in small to medium-sized and family-owned businesses but can also exist in larger organisations with a strong sense of community among employees.\n\nAdvantages of Clan Culture\n\nThe advantage of this organisational culture is the strong sense of trust, loyalty and commitment among employees. A clan culture makes employees feel like they are valued members of a close-knit community. This makes them more committed to the company’s success.\n\nInformal and personal communication systems are preferred in clan cultures because teamwork, mutual understanding and collaboration are fostered better in such circumstances. A family-like environment is created within the workplace set-up, which can be very supportive and lead to higher job satisfaction and employee engagement.\n\nWhen employees feel like they are part of a supportive community, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged, which in turn fuels creativity and innovation. But according to the data available, clan cultures can resist change.\n\nClan cultures value long-term relationships with customers and suppliers. This can lead to stronger relationships and more loyal customers and suppliers. Sustained brand loyalty is built in this manner over a while.\n\nWhen employees feel like they are part of a close-knit community, they are more likely to stay with the organisation long-term. This can lead to improved retention rates, lower turnover, and low absenteeism.\n\nClan cultures create a cohesive and committed organisation with strong relationships among employees, customers, and suppliers. It can also lead to higher job satisfaction, improved retention rates and brand loyalty.\n\nDisadvantages of Clan Culture\n\nWhile clan culture has its advantages, there are also some disadvantages to consider, including:\n\n1. Resistance to change:\n\nMore often than not, the traditions and values of the organisation can become very rigid over a prolonged period, and this type of organisational culture can be resistant to change. Employees are wary of disrupting the traditions and values of the organisation.\n\n2. Lack of accountability:\n\nIn this type of organisational culture, where decision-making is decentralised, there’s often a lack of accountability as it becomes difficult to identify who is responsible for certain decisions or actions.\n\n3. Limited diversity:\n\nThe focus of this type of organisational culture is often tradition and heritage. This can limit diversity within the organisation, regarding the backgrounds and perspectives of employees and the products or services offered.\n\n4. Inefficient decision-making:\n\nWithout clear lines of authority, making decisions quickly and efficiently would not be easy. However, decentralisation can lead to an elevated state of autonomy and creativity among the organization’sorganization’s management, leading to inefficient decision-making.\n\n5. Nepotism:\n\nThis type of organisational culture often promotes nepotism, as family members or close friends of the leader may be given preferential treatment over other employees regarding bonuses or compensatory benefits.\n\n6. Limited growth opportunities:\n\nIn this type of organisational culture, there may be limited opportunities for growth or advancement, particularly for employees who are not part of the leader’s inner circle.\n\nClan culture can create a strong sense of community and commitment among employees, management, and brand loyalties where customers are concerned. Still, it can also lead to resistance to change, limited diversity, and inefficient decision-making. It is essential to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of clan culture when evaluating its suitability and sustainability for an organisation.\n\nIncorporating Elements of Clan Culture in Modern HRM\n\nIncorporating the positive elements of clan culture in modern HRM involves:\n\nFostering a sense of community, commitment and collaboration among employees through team-building activities or social events.\n\nEncouraging open communication and informal relationships between employees and managers and forging an element of trust and dependency among them.\n\nProviding opportunities for employee development and growth, such as mentoring or training programs, while creating more room for growth and development of the managers also.\n\nIncorporating company traditions and values into the onboarding process for new employees.\n\nRecognising and rewarding employees for their contributions to the organisation strictly based on merit can help build a sense of loyalty and commitment.\n\nCreating a supportive work environment that values work-life balance and employee well-being.\n\nEncouraging autonomy and decentralised decision-making among teams while maintaining accountability and clear lines of authority. Clear transparency in dealings, decision-making, and dispensation of rewards is desirable as company policy.\n\nDeveloping a strong leadership team that embodies the values and beliefs of the organisation and serves as role models for employees.
