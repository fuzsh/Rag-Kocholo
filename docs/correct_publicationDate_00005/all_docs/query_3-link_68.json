Charles Stross is a full-time science fiction writer and resident of Edinburgh, Scotland. The author of six Hugo-nominated novels and winner of the 2005, 2010, and 2014 Hugo awards for best novella, he has won numerous other awards and been translated into at least 12 other languages. His award-winning series include the long-running Merchant Princes series and The Laundry Files. His latest book, Season of Skulls, is out in May 2023.It was amazing to be able to chat with Charlie, a real legend of the SF scene. He told us how it took a little time to make the move from short stories to novels, and how initially his cross-genre storytelling received some resistance - until he won a Hugo Award for it! Since then, he has been prolific, and we chat to hiim about how he comes up with his stories, and how he plans (or doesn't) his long-running series.Links:Buy Charlie's books nowVisit Charlie's websiteFollow Charlie on mastodonPage One - The Writer's Podcast is brought to you by Write Gear, creators of Page One - the Writer's Notebook.
