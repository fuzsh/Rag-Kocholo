        "text": "In this futuristic world, an AI has been artificially creating souls and transplanting them into human bodies, thus making the majority of the human population. Amber, a citizen of Saturn, is running for office. She is running under the Accelerationista platform and wants people to leave the planet as she fears the computer will lead to humanity's doom. She is faced with much resistance. Her son, Sirhan, disagrees with her policies as he fears that it will anger the computer. Additionally, many of the population support the opposing conservationista party. However, the biggest hurdle is that the computer has begun uploading souls that go against Amber's platform. As a result, Amber loses the election. She is about to lose hope, when a group called the lobsters, a specific group that has escaped to other planets away from the computer, offers to help Amber. The lobsters explain that they will let some people use their ships if some humans agree to act as their explorers and mappers, who will map out the computer's router network."
