SHRM23 was such a delight and. Had loads of takeaways that I reminisce about from time to time. One of those was the closing remarks by the CEO. Reflecting on the closing remarks of Johnny C Taylor, CEO of SHRM, at the 2023 SHRM conference in Las Vegas, it is evident that the new world of work presents HR professionals with unique challenges and opportunities. As we navigate through the changes brought about by the new abnormal, the role of HR extends beyond being a mere partner to becoming the core of the business itself. In this new era, HR professionals are not only people experts, but also business and culture experts. We must adapt to the evolving workplace dynamics, where the concept of work-from-home, office, or hybrid environments poses the question of which is the best fit for organizations. We are also witnessing the rise of intelligent systems, such as AI and ChatGPT, transforming the way we operate. The fusion of artificial intelligence with human intelligence, or AI + HI = ROI, becomes crucial for achieving successful outcomes. This new world of work also brings about science-fiction-like realities, where holographic interactions and zero gravity office spaces are no longer just imaginative concepts. However, HR professionals must consider the implications these advancements have on managing both human and robotic employees, ensuring ethical practices are upheld. Furthermore, as we encounter a diverse range of workers with different sets of challenges, from the 75-year-olds who choose not to retire to the tech-savvy new generation, the importance of recognizing and accommodating invisible disabilities and fostering employee diversity cannot be underestimated. In this ever-evolving landscape, HR professionals must rethink not only how we think but also how others perceive our roles. We are the stewards of human capital, which is the most valuable asset in the economy. Beyond being partners, we are the business itself. And amidst the rise of AI and automation, the one tool we carry with us, our heart, remains irreplaceable. As we navigate through the bumpy ride that lies ahead, let us remember to take care of ourselves first, just as we are tasked with taking care of others. The next 25 years will undoubtedly be transformative for HR professionals, but the impact we make will be felt long after we are gone. Let us embrace this unique position we hold and continue to advocate for the importance of people, business, and culture in shaping the new world of work."
