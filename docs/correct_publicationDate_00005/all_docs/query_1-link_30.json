        "text": "Good teamwork and strong employee engagement are important drivers of employee and organizational performance. They are also the key characteristics of clan culture. Here’s all you need to know about clan culture in organizations and how you can foster its aspects within your business.\n\nContents\n\nWhat is clan culture?\n\nKey characteristics of clan culture\n\nAdvantages of clan culture\n\nDisadvantages of clan culture\n\nHow HR can help foster elements of clan culture\n\nWhat is clan culture?\n\nClan culture refers to a type of corporate culture that fosters a collaborative, family-like environment by valuing commitment, participation, and allegiance. Its horizontal structure has teams of close-knit employees who strongly identify with the organization’s vision and mission and unite over a shared cause.\n\nThe term “clan culture” is derived from its comparison to societal clans of people who unite over mutual ancestry or a particular kinship.\n\nManagement in this type of organizational culture is flexible and does not rely on strict control and procedures. There are rules, but they are instilled more socially than formally. Teams operate autonomously with a high degree of trust to decide how they get work done. Employees feel comfortable speaking freely and sharing knowledge, and leaders seek their input.\n\nClan-cultured organizations are often small businesses, start-ups, and family-owned companies with a more inward focus and emphasis on personal relationships.\n\nHere’s a glimpse into what one might look like:\n\nIt operates casually with informal language and a relaxed dress code.\n\nEmployees are hired based on their trustworthiness to uphold the company.\n\nOnboarding a new employee might involve mentoring rather than a set of procedures.\n\nEmployees have open access to owners/top management.\n\nUnstructured, face-to-face interactions are common.\n\nTeam members admit and discuss shortcomings openly to share knowledge and not to place blame.\n\nIt has a cooperative, supportive atmosphere of colleagues willing to help each other out.\n\nThe role of organizational culture\n\nA company’s organizational culture is a reflection of its personality. It is very similar to how every geographical culture reflects its unique composition of values and customs.\n\nAn organization’s culture has a profound impact on the business success, as it shapes employees’ attitudes about work, their behavior, and the ways to achieve strategic goals.\n\nBusinesses seldom fit exclusively into one kind of corporate culture but do tend to form a dominant one. The prevailing culture generally falls under one of four types of organizational culture identified by Kim Cameron and Robert Quinn.\n\nThe Competing Values Framework categorizes the culture types as follows:\n\nClan culture – Do things together\n\nAdhocracy culture – Do things first\n\nHierarchy culture – Do things right\n\nMarket culture – Do things fast\n\nIt can be very beneficial to define your company’s type of culture. In doing so, you can discover whether it’s sending the right message to support your business goals. To get started, you can evaluate your organizational culture with the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI).\n\nOur Organizational Development Certificate Program will provide you with practical strategies for creating a company culture and leading a culture change.\n\nKey characteristics of clan culture\n\nA clan culture resembles a family where everyone bands together as one cohesive unit. Companies with a prevalent clan culture tend to have the following features:\n\nActive participation and strong teamwork. Clan culture is based on collaboration and trust, so teamwork is a priority. People take part in the business beyond the scope of their own jobs to generate ideas and find solutions from multiple points of view. Solid bonds among employees allow them to function well collectively and work hard to accomplish goals.\n\nInformality and horizontal structure. The organizational structure is typically flat, so barriers between levels of employees are low. Management sees their employees as family and will lead in a nurturing way. Also, employees’ roles might not be formally defined as they juggle multiple tasks.\n\nA sense of belonging. People are integrated into the organization and feel like they’re part of something important beyond themselves. They have a strong emotional connection to the organization’s mission, values, and their colleagues. There is also an unspoken consensus of loyalty to the company and rivalry with competing businesses.\n\nTight connections. Employees work closely together as a unit and have more loyalty to each other than outsiders. Team members often refer new hires who then enter the organization with existing ties. Colleagues spend a lot of time together, even extending to socializing beyond work hours. Mentoring is commonplace, with employees learning from each other.\n\nCommitment to employees. With a focus on employee wellbeing, clan culture provides a nurturing environment where employees are mentored and encouraged to grow in their roles. There is a commitment to creating a safe, pleasant environment for employees, ensuring they have all they need to be satisfied.\n\nAdvantages of clan culture\n\nThe tribe-like nature of clan culture with less internal competition makes it very effective for certain organizations. Its strengths can breed the following benefits:\n\nDisadvantages of clan culture\n\nAlthough a clan-like environment can be a very effective company culture, it does have its drawbacks. Potential disadvantages of clan culture can include the following:\n\nHow HR can help foster elements of clan culture\n\nAdopting the right company culture will have a positive business impact. Clan culture’s strong teamwork, collaboration, and sense of belonging are elements that might benefit the teams within your organization.\n\nLet’s look at some ways that you can promote these clan culture aspects and transform your organizational culture:\n\n1. Build trust\n\nA positive work environment where team members can thrive requires trust among employees and toward their managers. Managers also need to trust their team members. Here are a few ways to encourage this:\n\nEncourage managers to get to know the people on their teams. Showing a genuine interest in what they’re working on and what’s going on outside of work can form a real bond. They should also make new employees feel especially welcome and be conscious of how well they are integrating into the team.\n\nArrange for executives to be visible and accessible to employees from time to time. Have them show up to team meetings or be available to mingle in informal settings, so employees them as people they can interact with and relate to.\n\nAdvocate for accentuating success and putting less focus on failures. Leaders should use shortcomings as learning experiences instead of placing liability. They shouldn’t hesitate to admit and discuss corporate decisions that have failed. Acknowledge and commend when people find fruitful solutions or go above and beyond expectations.\n\n2. Introduce shared team rewards\n\nWhile individual rewards motivate employees and boost morale and loyalty, shared team rewards can also promote employee synergy for better teamwork. Examples of this type of incentive include team performance-based bonuses, prizes, and annual recognition events.\n\nFor these to be effective, the target performance or output must depend on everyone’s contributions. Also, performance criteria for the rewards must be based on clear, impartial standards.\n\n3. Promote a feedback culture\n\nClan culture welcomes openness, feedback, and ideas, so find a variety of ways to foster these within your teams. Here are some ideas:\n\nOrganize brainstorming sessions.\n\nInvite people to comment on proposals, etc.\n\nEncourage managers to practice active listening and welcome employees’ perspectives.\n\nAct on feedback and then follow up by highlighting the decision or change made.\n\nProviding employees with plenty of feedback channels allows them to choose the way that they feel most comfortable. They also need to know that there won’t be negative repercussions for voicing their views, so they feel safe enough to be honest and open.\n\n4. Spark connections among employees\n\nWhen coworkers feel connected to each other, they collaborate better. Here are some ideas for inspiring employee bonding opportunities:\n\nA micro-mentoring program.\n\nSpecial projects teams.\n\nStructured team-building exercises.\n\nTeam game tournaments.\n\nLunch excursions with no conversation about work.\n\nTeam charity workdays.\n\n5. Strengthen the sense of belonging\n\nEmployees will feel connected to their employer by understanding the organization’s mission and how they contribute to it. It’s essential to find ways to align employees to the purpose of your organization so they feel like they belong.\n\nIn addition to acknowledging and acting on employee feedback, managers need to be intentional about making sure that everyone is being heard. This means pursuing people who don’t usually speak up in a group and asking for their input or offering them a specific occasion to voice their ideas.\n\nThe sense of belonging also needs to be extended to gig and remote workers. Don’t forget to ask them to participate in team or company events as much as possible.\n\nEnding overview\n\nWho your company is able to recruit and retain depends on the culture you offer. We’re seeing organizations of all sizes making an effort to encourage a more clan-like vibe across the entire business.\n\nHelping employees feel connected to each other and the organization will result in effective teams, ultimately leading to organizational success."
