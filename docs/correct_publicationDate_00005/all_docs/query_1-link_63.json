Miriam Beckstein has said goodbye to her comfort zone, and the transition from journalist to captive in an alternative timeline was challenging to say the least. As was discovering her long-lost family, the Clan, were world-skipping assassins. Now civil war rages in her adopted home, she’s pregnant with the heir to their throne and a splinter-group want her on their side of a desperate power struggle. But as a leader or figurehead? Meanwhile, unknown to the Clan, the US government is on to them and preparing to exploit this knowledge. But it hadn’t foreseen a dissident Clan faction carrying nuclear devices between worlds – with the US President in their sights. The War on Terror is about to go transdimensional. But Mike Fleming, CIA agent, knows the most terrifying secret of all. His government’s true intentions. ‘Stross’s ability to combine interesting ideas with solid plotting is one of his great strengths’, Asimov’s Science Fiction, ‘Stross sure ends things with a bang …satisfying and chilling’, RTBookreviews.com, ‘These books are immense fun’ Locus\n\nReviews of The Traders’ War: This Merchant Princes Omnibus Includes the Clan Corporate and the Merchants’ War\n\n\"'Stross's ability to combine interesting ideas with solid plotting is one of his great strengths', Asimov's Science Fiction, 'Stross sure ends things with a bang… satisfying and chilling', RTBookreviews.com, 'These books are immense fun' Locus\""
