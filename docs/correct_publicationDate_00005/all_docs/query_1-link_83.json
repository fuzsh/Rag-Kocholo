The Need for Transformational Change for Growth\n\n44:27\n\nNew Zealand born business philosopher and entrepreneur, Christopher Evatt, was raised with the understanding that we should leave everybody and everything better than when we found it, and we should work for the good of the whole. But the problem is, we humans have been labouring under an illusion of separation, both individually and collectively. We’re all connected, says Christopher, our society, companies, organisations, the planet; we’re all one living system.In this episode of Corporate Unplugged, Christopher discusses our need to evolve and grow, to raise our consciousness and understanding of our interconnectedness, both within individuals and organisations. But more importantly, we need to learn to clear our own energy system, to embrace the power of thought, intention, and beliefs to make wise choices and grow in wisdom.To learn more, download and listen to this episode today. On today’s podcast:● Personal growth, collective dysfunction, and planetary transformation● Consciousness, growth, and personal development● Bridging generations for business success● Businesses need a quantum understanding to thrive● We are all leaders\n\n146. How To Become What You Might Have Been\n\n31:07\n\nDon’t stress about where you are in life, says Eda Çarmıklı, a proud utopian and firm believer, that it’s never too late to become what you might have been. You're going to get to where you need to be, or perhaps you’re already there. Just open your eyes and trust that life will bring you the right people, the right communities, and the right collaborations, when you’re ready. Eda’s the co-founder of the global collaborative platform, Joint Idea; lifelong laboratory growth program Life Works Labs; and social tribe, Love Mafia. She’s also a second generation shareholder in Nurol Holding, an industrial conglomerate in Turkey operating in construction, infrastructure, machinery, energy, investment, banking and tourism. In this episode of Corporate Unplugged, Eda talks about the hurdles life presents us so that we can become what we were meant to be. “Just flow and see where life takes you. Don’t force things, don’t try to wear jackets that don’t fit you, just let it go and enjoy life as it is; just trust life that it may not deliver you what you want, but exactly what you need.” On today’s podcast: ● Personal growth, vulnerability, and utopia● Learn to voice your truth● Leadership, growth, and sustainability in a family-owned business● Exponential humanity and learning to listen● Collective intelligence, love, and compassion in business\n\n145. Resilience Thinking and Human Impact on the Planet\n\n40:31\n\nWe all depend on Planet Earth for life and yet as a species, our collective actions are having devastating impacts such as a loss of biodiversity and climate change, among other things. It’s literally the definition of insanity, says Lisen Schultz, Associate Professor in Sustainability Science, Deputy Director for the Stockholm Resilience Center, University of Stockholm, Director of Education, and the Programme Director for the center's executive programme in resilience thinking. We humans aren’t evil, our problem is we don’t see what we’re doing as damaging, nor can we see how we could do it differently. Our world is built around a formula of growth, rather than meaningful growth. In this episode of Corporate Unplugged, Lisen discusses the urgency of the climate change challenge, but also the potential opportunities it presents for us individually, as well as for companies, but, in a way that doesn’t create a whole new set of problems.

The Importance of Understanding Context\n\n38:22\n\nThere is a real pressure to solve the climate crisis and the myriad other environmental and social issues by breaking them down into their constituent parts, to solve them individually. But, says Nora Bateson, award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, and President of the International Bateson Institute, this approach is the biggest challenge we need to overcome. We live in a complex, interdependent world, and to find new solutions we need to relearn how we think, feel and navigate, we need to adopt a different mindset. In this episode of Corporate Unplugged, Vesna and Nora discuss the need for a more diverse ecology of knowing; how do we know things? What is our ability to zoom in and study the details? And how can we zoom out and see the context?To find out more, download and listen to this latest episode.

Small Acts of Kindness can Change the World\n\n37:03\n\nRight now, says Nipun Mehta, founder of Service Space, an incubator of gift economy projects that inspire people to be the change they wish to see, the world needs a little more kindness. And yes, with so many challenges happening globally, it might feel like such an insignificant act isn’t going to affect anything but says Nipun, that’s how history changes. 25 years ago, in Silicon Valley, Nipun started Service Space as an experiment with friends. Today it’s a global ecosystem with around 1.5 million members. And they've not only delivered millions of dollars in service for free, but they're also regenerating a gift culture. In this incredibly insightful conversation, Vesna and Nipun discuss how small acts of kindness can change the world. To find out more, download and listen to this episode.

How Organisations and Individuals can Heal Burnout\n\n51:00\n\nSometimes a physical ailment isn't physical, says Neha Sangwan, MD and CEO and founder of Intuitive Intelligence. In fact, stress causes or exacerbates more than 80% of illnesses, so rather than simply treating the physical injuries, we need to be asking people what's at the root of their stress. In this episode of Corporate Unplugged, Neha explains why her passion is teaching people how to communicate with themselves, and with each other, to navigate their emotions, manage their energy, to learn how to keep themselves well so that collectively, as humans, we can all rise together now, and in the future. “What I have learned is, self-care is not selfish, it's self-full. It's how I can, over time, be able to serve in the world in a way that comes from a replenished full, energized place, full of vitality and energy, versus a depleted exhausted place.” To find out more, download and listen to this latest episode.

How to Manage Injustice with Moral Clarity\n\n39:07\n\nCapitalism has served us well in many ways, says Manish Bhardwaj, CEO and founder of Innovators in Health, but it has also exacerbated injustice and inequality worldwide. So, how can we address the problems at the heart of this? How can we design more just systems? By having moral clarity. In this episode of Corporate Unplugged, Manish explains we first need to understand why there is injustice in the world, before we can find a solution. A lot of our failures today, says Manish, are failures of imagination. We’re really good instrumentalists, we know how to crunch data, what we lack is a fluency in the language of morality. To find out more about cultivating moral clarity, download and listen to this episode today. On today’s podcast:Why we’re all such good instrumentalistsWe aren’t trained to navigate difficult issues morallyMoral clarity and justice requires accompanimentLeaders should rely on moral authority\n\n140. The Future of Human Intelligence and Transformative Technology\n\n45:24\n\nA lot of people believe the problems we're facing on a global scale are related to tech, says Nichol Bradford, pioneer, innovator, investor and thought leader at the intersection of technology and human transformation. But the truth is, much of what we’re struggling with just boils down to a lack of belonging. “We craft these visions of the future where people can't see themselves in it, they can't see that they belong to it.”In this episode of Corporate Unplugged, Nichol discusses the future of human intelligence and why there can be no digital transformation without a human transformation, and explains why change needs to come from the top.“Culture eats strategy for breakfast. Culture is a collection of people, and how they show up with each other every day, and how one shows up with other people has everything to do with how you show up with yourself. It starts with you. It always starts with you.”To find out more, download and listen to this latest episode.
