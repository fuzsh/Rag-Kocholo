        "text": "Europe's financial crisis eased Thursday as Greece installed a respected economist to replace its prime minister and Italy appeared poised to do the same — both hoping that monetary experts can do better than the politicians who drove their nations so deeply into debt.\n\nThe announcement in Athens — coupled with the prospect that volatile Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will be ushered out soon — quieted market fears, at least for now, that turmoil in Europe could threaten the global economy.\n\nBut significant challenges remain in both debt-heavy Mediterranean countries.\n\nGreece's new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, a former vice president of the European Central Bank, must quickly secure the crucial loan installment without which his country will go bankrupt before Christmas, and approve the EU's $177 billion (€130 billion) bailout deal.\n\nIn Italy, lawmakers have to pass new austerity measures over the next few days. However, expectations that respected economist Mario Monti will lead an interim technocratic government after Berlusconi goes helped lift the gloom.\n\nItaly's borrowing costs shot up alarmingly Wednesday to 7.4 percent on fears that Berlusconi would linger in office. But the markets calmed Thursday when it appeared that Italian lawmakers would approve the latest government austerity plans in the next few days and Berlusconi would resign after that.\n\nMonti, 68, now heads Milan's Bocconi University, but he made his reputation as the European Union competition commissioner who blocked General Electric's takeover of Honeywell.\n\nEuropean stock markets rose on the twin Greek and Italian developments, while in the U.S. the Dow Jones industrial average was up 113 points, or 1 percent, a day after shedding nearly 400 points. The euro was also in demand, trading 0.5 percent higher at $1.3609.\n\nStill, the European Union warned that the 17-nation eurozone could slip back into \"a deep and prolonged\" recession next year amid the debt crisis. The European Commission predicted the eurozone will grow a pallid 0.5 percent in 2012 — much less than its earlier forecast of 1.8 percent. EU unemployment was forecast to be stuck at 9.5 percent.\n\nEurope has already bailed out Greece, Portugal and Ireland — but together they make up only about 6 percent of the eurozone's economic output, in contrast to Italy's 17 percent. Italy, the eurozone's third-largest economy, is considered too big for Europe to bail out. It has a mountain of debt — $2.6 trillion (€1.9 trillion) — and a substantial portion of that needs to be refinanced in the next few years.\n\nIn Greece, Papademos called for unity and promised to seek cross-party cooperation to keep Greece firmly in the 17-nation eurozone.\n\n\"The participation of our country in the eurozone is a guarantee for the country's monetary stability. It is a driver of financial prosperity,\" Papademos said after getting the mandate to form a Cabinet. \"I am not a politician, but I have dedicated most of my professional life to exercising financial policy both in Greece and in Europe.\"\n\nThe 64-year-old Papademos, who also served as Bank of Greece governor, will lead a government backed by both Greece's governing Socialists and the opposition conservatives until early elections, tentatively set for February. He replaces outgoing Prime Minister George Papandreou midway through his four-year term, ending a family dynasty that has dominated Greek politics for decades.\n\nIn Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner welcomed Papademos' appointment and \"the consensus that's been reached in Greece over the need to implement the country's reform commitments to the IMF as well as the European Union.\"\n\nThe new Greek Cabinet will be sworn in Friday. There has been no announcement on its composition, and officials said negotiations continued late Thursday.\n\nHowever, two government officials and two opposition lawmakers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue, said Evangelos Venizelos was expected to remain finance minister. Venizelos was deeply involved in negotiating the European rescue plan."
