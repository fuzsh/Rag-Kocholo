        "text": "Enough bondholders participated in a Greek debt swap to stave off a disorderly default, at least for the time being.\n\nThe country's finance ministry said creditors holding 85.8% of the €206 billion in bonds eligible for the deal tendered their holdings. That figure would rise to 95.7% with the use of collective action clauses (CACs) to force participation by holdouts.\n\nThe bond swap became imperative when the Troika -- the European Commisssion, ECB and IMF -- demanded it as a condition of the latest €130 billion package of bailout loans for Greece. It is aimed at cutting the country's debt burden to around 120% of gross domestic product, from its current 160%.\n\nSupport grew for the debt swap all week ahead of Thursday's deadline, thanks in large part to the participation of Europe's largest banks, including the likes of Germany's Deutsche Bank, France's BNP Paribas and Societe Generale and Italy's Unicredit, and National Bank of Greece.\n\nWhile the success of the Greek deal will put off the issue of a messy default for a bit, it is not yet clear whether the use of CACs will trigger payouts on credit default swaps (CDS) which bondholders often purchase as insurance on their holdings. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) said Friday that its determinations committee is meeting to determine whether CDS will be triggered after a question was submitted in regards to Greek debt."
