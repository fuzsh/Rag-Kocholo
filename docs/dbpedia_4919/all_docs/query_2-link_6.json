        "text": "Banker Lucas Papademos served as Greek prime minister for six months in 2011-2012 at the height of the country's debt crisis.\n\nOn Thursday he was rushed to hospital with leg injuries after an explosion in his car in Athens. His driver was also hurt by the device, concealed in an envelope. Reports say their injuries are not life-threatening.\n\nIn November 2011 he was offered the post of interim prime minister at the age of 64, as a non-party technocrat trusted by Greece's international creditors at a time of peril for the country's debt-ridden economy.\n\nAt that time he was an adviser to outgoing Prime Minister George Papandreou, involved in the tough negotiations with the \"troika\" of creditors - the IMF, European Commission and European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nHe stepped in after Mr Papandreou had shocked the creditors by trying to hold a referendum on the bailout terms. That plan was dropped, and Mr Papademos formed a new coalition made up of Mr Papandreou's leftist Pasok and centre-right New Democracy.\n\nHe was seen as untainted by the old-boy political networks that many Greeks blamed for the country's large-scale corruption and addiction to debt.\n\nBut the task of pursuing the austerity programme imposed by the creditors was highly controversial.\n\nMr Papademos was vice-president of the ECB in 2002-2010, sharing the monetary stability credo of then-superior Jean-Claude Trichet and the current ECB chief, Mario Draghi.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, external, Mr Papademos and Mr Draghi studied together at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both earning doctorates in economics in the late 1970s, and remained close.\n\nDuring his short tenure as prime minister, Mr Papademos stuck with the harsh austerity demanded by the creditors in exchange for Greece's cash lifeline.\n\nOn taking office, he stressed that his priority was to keep Greece inside the eurozone. He did so, but in the face of much anger at the social cost, as Greece's overall debts, job cuts and mass unemployment all continued to grow."
