        "text": "From his Wikipedia page:\n\nPapademos attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, gaining a degree in physics in 1970, a masters degree in electrical engineering in 1972, and a doctorate in economics, in 1978.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe followed an academic career at Columbia University where he taught economics from 1975 until 1984, and then at the University of Athens from 1988 to 1993.[2]\n\nHe has served as Senior Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 1980. He joined the Bank of Greece in 1985 as Chief Economist, rising to Deputy Governor in 1993 and Governor in 1994. During his time as Governor of the national bank, Mr Papademos was involved in Greece's transition from the drachma to the euro as its national currency.[3]\n\nAfter leaving the Bank of Greece in 2002, Papademas became the Vice President to Jean-Claude Trichet at the European Central Bank from 2002 to 2010. In 2010 he left that position to serve as an advisor to George Papandreou.[4]\n\nHe has been a member of the Trilateral Commission since 1998.[5]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverything could still change of course, but at the moment, it sounds like he's the one."
