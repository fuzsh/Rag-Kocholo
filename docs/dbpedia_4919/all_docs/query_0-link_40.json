The debate will be chaired by Kathimerini journalist Giorgos Lialios.\n\nAt 12 p.m., there will be a debate on foreign policy and Greece’s ties to the EU, involving former deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos, former foreign ministers Dora Bakoyannis and Nikos Kotzias, Constantinos Filis, director of the ACG Institute of Global Affairs and professor of international relations at the American College of Greece (ACS), Konstantina Botsiou, professor of history and international relations at the University of Piraeus, and director of the Council for International Relations. The debate will be moderated by Tom Ellis, editor-in-chief of Kathimerini English Edition."
