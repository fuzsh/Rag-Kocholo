        "text": "Technocrat prime minister Lucas Papademos has taken office, saying his main priority is keeping Greece within the eurozone.\n\nThe new government of national unity is expected to move quickly to pass the latest bailout package.\n\nMr Papademos is heading a coalition cabinet filled with many of the same politicians who led the nation into crisis and pushed the eurozone to the brink of collapse.\n\nAt a colourful swearing-in ceremony, black-robed Orthodox priests, led by the Archbishop of Athens, blessed Mr Papademos and a cabinet dominated by the two main parties which had bickered for four days before agreeing on the crisis coalition.\n\n\"With the unity of all people, we will succeed,\" Mr Papademos told George Papandreou, who led the previous Socialist administration that fell apart last week.\n\nApart from Mr Papademos, a former European Central Bank vice president with no political experience, the cabinet's main new face is from the LAOS party - the first time the far right has joined a Greek government since a military junta fell in 1974.\n\nThe line-up includes Socialist party power broker Evangelos Venizelos, who keeps the post of finance minister that he held in Mr Papandreou's government.\n\nAnalysts say Mr Papademos - a quiet academic economist - had to assert his authority over a cabinet packed with the hardened conservative and Socialist party politicians who took turns in power for decades as Greece built up a huge debt it could not manage, forcing an international bailout.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"Greece has a government that is the result of political compromise among three parties. It is obvious that there was a dealing of the cards,\" said Costas Panagopoulos, head of ALCO pollsters.\n\n\"It all now depends on how the prime minister handles them.\"\n\nDecember deadline\n\nThe interim government of national unity, which has a bumper 48 ministers and their deputies, plans to announce its platform on Monday evening (local time), then conduct a debate and win a confidence vote in parliament by early next week.\n\nIt has a clear mandate that may not be so simple to implement before it calls elections, tentatively agreed for February 19.\n\nIt has to push through parliament Greece's second bailout deal in as many years - a plan that includes fighting tax evasion, selling off state companies and cutting the public sector - to get hold of 130 billion euros in long-term funds.\n\nBut Athens also needs money fast from its International Monetary Fund and European Union lenders to meet big debt repayments due in December or face default, bankruptcy and the danger of leaving the eurozone.\n\nFinance minister Mr Venizelos said securing an aid instalment that Athens needs to retire debt in December would be the cabinet's immediate focus.\n\n\"Our first priority is clear. It is the timely release of the 8 billion euro tranche before December 15. There is readiness for this from our partners and the IMF for this to happen on time,\" he said.\n\nA source from the so-called \"troika\" of the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank said inspectors would visit Athens early next week to speak with the new government and would clear the next tranche only when it pledged to meet its commitments.\n\nBoth the Socialist PASOK and the conservative New Democracy parties say they will vote for the new bailout in parliament.\n\nBut the package demands policies and reforms which are likely to be highly unpopular as the parties prepared for the elections, expected in February at the earliest.\n\nIt stipulates yet more of the punishing austerity that has kept the country locked in a fourth year of recession, sent unemployment soaring to a record 18.4 per cent and brought Greeks out on to the streets in sometimes violent protests.\n\n\"The big problem with this government is that it is not elected by the people,\" said Christoforos Vernardakis, a political scientist at Thessaloniki university.\n\n\"If unemployment reaches 25 per cent in December...I doubt that a technocrat can implement any policies to cope with this.\"\n\nLeader debate\n\nThe two main parties kept Greece in suspense for days as they argued over who should lead the coalition, with one deal to install the speaker of parliament collapsing after Mr Papandreou announced he was handing over to a new premier.\n\nBut even after Mr Papademos was confirmed as prime minister, manoeuvring over who gets which job dragged on, with the cabinet list released only as ministers started arriving at the presidential palace to be sworn in.\n\nConservative opposition leader Antonis Samaras agreed to back the new cabinet, but refused to bow to pressure from Greece's lenders to buckle down on reforms.\n\n\"We are all well aware that our country has lost the last trace of decency in the last couple of days. Together we will restore it very quickly without accepting being humiliated or insulted,\" he said.\n\n\"Together we will support Papademos's new transitional government in its task and we hope it will achieve its mission.\"\n\nFar-right LAOS won their place at table of a cabinet that was supposed to include all parties, but left-wing groups refused to participate.\n\nOn the streets of Athens, people welcomed a fresh face at least at the top, but hoped the consequences would not be too severe for a country weary of hardship.\n\n\"The measures that have already been announced will be imposed,\" said civil servant Yiannis Papageorgiou, 57, referring to a wave of pay and pension cuts, public sector layoffs and privatisations agreed under the bailout deal.\n\n\"But at least I hope that the new government will not take any further measures, because until now Greek workers have been the only ones who have been paying for the crisis.\"\n\nLoading..."
