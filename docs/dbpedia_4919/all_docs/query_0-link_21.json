        "text": "The accord ended four days of wrangling between Papandreou and other party leaders. Papandreou was poised to resign after announcing agreement on a new government on November 9 after his proposal for a referendum on a second Greek financing package roiled markets and angered Greeks and European Union partners.\n\nThe unity government must implement budget measures and decisions related to an October 26 European bailout amounting to €130bn as well as manage a voluntary debt swap, before holding elections that have been tentatively set for February 19.\n\n“They tried the politicians in Greece and that didn’t work, so they need a technocrat to get the country back on track by making some very difficult decisions,” Shada Islam, an analyst at the Friends of Europe policy-advisory group in Brussels, said in a telephone interview.\n\nImmediately at stake is the fate of an €8bn loan installment under an earlier €110bn EU-led bailout agreed on in May 2010. The tranche must be paid before the middle of December to prevent a collapse of the country’s financial system.\n\nDisbursement was halted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy after Papandreou called the referendum on the European bailout terms.\n\n“I am confident the country’s participation in the eurozone is a guarantee of monetary stability,” Papademos said. “The country’s participation in the eurozone, despite the difficulties it is facing, will facilitate the adjustment of the economy and growth and we must all be optimistic on the final outcome as long as we are united.”\n\nPapademos met with representatives of the three parliamentary parties late on Thursday to take final decisions on his Cabinet.\n\nFormer European Commissioner Stavros Dimas, from New Democracy, will also become a deputy prime minister, replacing Theodoros Pangalos of Papandreou’s Pasok party, the Athens-based newspaper reported.\n\nGeorge Papaconstantinou will remain environment, energy and climate-change minister, Andreas Loverdos will stay on as health minister and Anna Diamantopoulou will keep her post as education minister, the newspaper said.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Greek bond was little changed at 28.45pc.\n\nThe scale of the task facing any new Greek government was underlined on Thursday when the European Commission said the country’s debt will be almost twice the size of the economy in 2012 amid a fifth straight annual contraction. The unemployment rate rose almost two percentage points in August, a record monthly increase, to 18.4pc, the Hellenic Statistical Authority said.\n\nGreece’s debt will reach 163pc of gross domestic product this year and jump to 198pc in 2012, the EU’s Brussels-based executive arm said in its fall economic forecast. That compares with 173pc predicted by the Greek government in its 2012 draft budget.\n\nThose figures are based on no policy changes and don’t include plans for a writedown of Greek debt that is included in the October 26 plan and may slice as much as €100bn off Greece’s debt burden.\n\n“It is important for Greece’s new government to send a strong cross-party message of reassurance to its European partners that it is committed to doing what it takes to set its debt on a steady downward path,” European Union President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Barroso said in a joint statement on Thursday in Brussels. “The voluntary bond exchange with private-sector investors should take place as planned at the beginning of 2012.”\n\nGreece plans to pay lenders 50 cents for each euro the government borrowed under the terms of the bailout plan agreed to at the October 26 summit. Its 4pc notes due in August 2013 now trade at about 33 cents. Fitch Ratings says the agreement with creditors would amount to a “default event” if implemented, while the International Swaps and Derivatives Association says it won’t trigger credit-default swaps.\n\n“He certainly speaks the language and shares the philosophy of Greece’s EU and ECB counterparts,” Riccardo Barbieri, chief European economist at Mizuho International Plc in London, said in a phone interview. “He is not responsible for Greece’s fiscal profligacy. The only thing you can hold against him is that he helped take Greece into the euro.”"
