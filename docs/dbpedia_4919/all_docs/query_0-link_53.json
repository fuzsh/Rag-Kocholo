        "text": "Economist Lucas Papademos will be Greece’s next prime minister, the Greek president’s office announced yesterday, giving a non-politician the job of passing an unpopular bailout plan before elections are held next year.\n\nThe selection ended four days of squabbling among the country’s bitterly divided political parties over how to structure a unity government. Papademos, 64, and the rest of the government are to be installed today.\n\nThe most immediate issue facing Greece is securing an $11 billion installment of its original May 2010 bailout package. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said last week that without it, the country’s coffers would be empty by Dec. 15."
