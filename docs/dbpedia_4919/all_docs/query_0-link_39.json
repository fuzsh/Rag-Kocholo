        "text": "Gikas Hardouvelis, an experienced economist, is to replace Yannis Stournaras as Greece’s finance minister, the government announced today (9 June).\n\nThe appointment is part of a cabinet reshuffle ordered by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras in the wake of a disappointing performance by government parties in the European Parliament elections last month (25 May).\n\nHardouvelis is a professor of finance and economics at the University of Piraeus, chief economist and director of research at the Eurobank Group, and was an adviser to former prime minister Lucas Papademos.\n\nStournaras, who took over as finance minister in 2012 as an independent candidate, is expected to be the next governor of the Bank of Greece. The bank’s current governor, Georgios Provopoulos, is to leave the post at the end of this month.\n\nThe other moves announced today are: Argyris Ntinopoulos replacing Giannis Michelaskis as interior minister; Vassilis Kikilias replacing Nikos Dendias as public order minister; Andreas Loverdos replacing Konstantinos Arvanitopoulos as education minister; Kostas Tasoulas replacing Panos Panagiotopoulos as culture minister; and Makis Voridis replacing Adonis Georgiades as health minister.\n\nAfter the European elections, Alexis Tsipras, leader of Syriza, called for early national elections. But Samaras, leader of the centre-right New Democracy, and Evangelos Venizelos, leader of the centre-left PASOK and foreign affairs minister, hope that a reshuffle will address the problem.\n\nThe election result caused much debate within PASOK, with calls for Venizelos to step down. Venizelos had earlier declared that it is important to keep this government in place until the next national election, scheduled for 2016, in a bid to steer Greece through the economic crisis."
