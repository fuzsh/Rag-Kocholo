        "text": "Former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has been injured by an explosion inside his car in Athens.\n\nReports say the blast may have been caused by a letter bomb.\n\nMr Papademos, 69, had leg, arm and stomach injuries, but officials said his condition was \"not a cause for concern\". His driver was also injured - but not seriously. Reports say at least one other person in the car was hurt.\n\nNo group has so far claimed responsibility for Thursday's blast.\n\nMr Papademos was appointed caretaker prime minister in November 2011 amid political and economic turmoil. He served in post until May 2012.\n\nHe has also served as vice-president of the European Central Bank."
