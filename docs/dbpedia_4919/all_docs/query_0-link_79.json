        "text": "Reuters, Athens\n\nTechnocrat Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos took office on Friday to save Greece from bankruptcy, heading a coalition Cabinet filled with many of the same politicians who led the nation into crisis and pushed the eurozone to the brink of collapse.\n\nAt a colorful swearing-in ceremony, black-robed Orthodox priests, led by the Archbishop of Athens, blessed Papademos and a Cabinet dominated by the two main parties which had bickered for four days before agreeing on the crisis coalition.\n\nApart from Papademos, a former European Central Bank vice president with no political experience, the Cabinet’s main new face is from the LAOS party — the first time the far right has joined a Greek government since a military junta fell in 1974.\n\nAs politicians in Italy pushed through austerity measures and contemplated an emergency government to stave off the crisis creeping deeper into the eurozone, Papademos said his priority would be to meet the terms of the country’s EU, IMF bailout and pull Greece out of recession.\n\n“The final result will depend much on whether we succeed in stabilizing the real economy, reining in unemployment and setting the ground to revive the economy and gradually boost employment in a relatively short time,” he told his governing team in its first meeting. “That’s why I would like to ask everyone to do his best in the next coming days, weeks and months.”\n\nThe lineup includes Socialist party power broker Evangelos Venizelos, who keeps the post of finance minister that he held in Papandreou’s government.\n\nAnalysts said Papademos — a quiet academic economist -—- had to assert his authority over a Cabinet packed with the hardened conservative and Socialist party politicians who took turns in power for decades as Greece built up a huge debt it could not manage, forcing an international bailout.\n\nThe interim government of national unity, which has a bumper 48 ministers and their deputies, plans to announce its platform tomorrow evening, then conduct a debate and win a confidence vote in parliament by early next week.\n\nIt has a clear mandate that might not be so simple to implement before it calls an early general election, tentatively agreed for Feb. 19.\n\nIt has to push through parliament Greece’s second bailout deal in as many years — a plan that includes fighting tax evasion, selling off state companies and cutting the public sector — to get hold of 130 billion euros (US$179 billion) in long-term funds.\n\nHowever, Athens also needs money fast from its IMF and EU lenders to meet big debt repayments due next month or face default, bankruptcy and the danger of leaving the eurozone."
