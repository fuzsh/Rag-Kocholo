        "text": "Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, must begin implementing measures needed to secure the next instalment of an international loan as he takes charge of the debt-wracked nation this week.\n\nThe German and French leaders have said Athens has to ratify a bailout deal agreed at an EU summit last month before Greece can receive the eight-billion-euro ($A10.77 billion) loan tranche needed by December 15 to avert default.\n\nPapademos will be buoyed by poll numbers published on Sunday in the Kathimerini newspaper as he strives to restore stability to Greece's turbulent political scene.\n\nFifty-five per cent of those polled said they had a positive opinion of the new prime minister, compared with 18 per cent who had a negative one and 27 per cent who did not have an opinion.\n\nThe new prime minister, who heads a majority socialist coalition that includes partners from both the right and far-right, is to speak in parliament on Monday ahead of a vote on Wednesday to confirm his new government.\n\nOfficials from Greece's creditors - the EU, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank - are due in Athens to evaluate progress to date in stabilising its finances.\n\nIn talks with Papademos on Saturday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel underlined the need for Greece to act quickly on the terms the 130-billion-euro bailout deal agreed at a Brussels summit on October 26-27.\n\n\"The payment of the next tranche (of the 2010 bailout) can only take place when a decisive step has been taken in this matter,\" a statement from Sarkozy's office said.\n\nUnder the terms of an international bailout deal agreed in October, private banks are to accept writedowns of 50 per cent, which will allow Greece to wipe out nearly a third of its 350 billion euro debt.\n\nBut Germany's Der Spiegel magazine, in a report due out on Monday, said Berlin has worked out contingency plans in the event that Greece has to quit the eurozone if it fails to meet its obligations.\n\nGreek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who kept his job in the new government, said the need to implement the measures agreed to in Brussels summit was \"urgent\" and would be done \"no later than Monday or Tuesday\".\n\nPapademos's government must then force through the painful austerity measures exacted as the price for the second EU rescue package.\n\nHowever, the strikes that started under Papandreou were set to continue as the main public service union, Adedy, called for three-hour stoppages, starting on Tuesday, in protest at rising taxes and 30,000 job cuts across the public service.\n\nDemonstrations are also expected on Thursday, November 17, the anniversary of huge protests in 1973 by students at the Athens Polytechnic University against the then junta.\n\nThe government also faces continuing opposition from the KKE communist party and radical left party Syriza.\n\nBoth refused to join the new coalition, opposing what they termed Greek complicity with the IMF and the EU-led policy that obliges Greece to impose austerity measures.\n\nThe European Commission forecasts a 2.8 per cent contraction for the Greek economy in 2012 and a further increase in unemployment, measured at 18 per cent in August."
