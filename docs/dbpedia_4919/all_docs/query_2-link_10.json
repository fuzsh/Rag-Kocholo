        "text": "Greece has turned a historic page with a new unity government led by Lucas Papademos, a technocratic economist, being ushered into power after weeks of political turmoil that has cast doubt over the nation's eurozone membership.\n\nWith Archbishop Ieronymos, the country's spiritual leader overseeing the ceremony, Papademos, a former European Central Bank vice-president, was sworn in at the helm of an interim three-party coalition on Friday. His 48-member cabinet includes MPs from the conservative New Democracy party, the populist far-right Laos party and outgoing socialist government, which caved in under the pressure of handling Greece's worst economic crisis.\n\n\"We must all assume out responsibilities to take the country forward,\" the new prime minister said, addressing his first cabinet meeting. \"We are living through critical and historic times and it is imperative that we co-operate.\"\n\nIn a country with almost no experience of cross-party rule, Greeks have reacted with relief at the new unity government and the appointment of a low-key, non-political figure as their prime minister.\n\nNewspapers conveyed the optimistic mood with headlines such as \"new era\" and \"hope returns\". Politicians and pundits alike observed that the mould-breaking administration was likely to mark the end of politics as they have been known in Greece since the reintroduction of democracy with the end of military rule in 1974.\n\n\"This is the end of one-party governments, this is the end of traditional fiscal policies and this is the end of the clientelistic system,\" said commentator Pashcos Mandravelis. \"We have had to learn the hard way because of the economic crisis. Everything has or will change.\"\n\nEmerging from the presidential palace after the swearing-in ceremony, the new cabinet ministers concurred.\n\n\"This is a government that will shape the country's future. There are no more parties, there is only Greece,\" said Markos Bolaris, the new deputy health minister and close ally of the former prime minister George Papandreou.\n\nGreeks are hoping that after days of high drama, capped by the intense political wrangling that preceded his appointment, the 64-year-old, US-educated Papademos will exert a quiet calm over Athens's highly charged political scene and put the economy back on track. Almost two years after Greece's debt crisis erupted, there is a lot at stake.\n\nDespite receiving the biggest bailout in western history from the EU and IMF 18 months ago, the country has only enough cash to survive until mid December and is once again staring at the prospect of a messy default.\n\nWith elections due in February, the new government has approximately 100 days to implement painful reforms that will ram home the message that even in its near-bankrupt state the country is intent on remaining in the euro zone.\n\nPapademos has to get a controversial €130bn bailout programme approved by a parliamentary majority of 180 votes in the 300 seat-house; convince international lenders to release €8bn in long overdue rescue loans; push through a 2012 budget that is tougher than any seen so far; enforce a draconian new tax law and launch an ambitious €50bn privatisation drive that has already whipped up mass popular opposition.\n\nFresh austerity measures, on top of wage and pensions cuts, tax increases, benefit and job losses will also have to be inflicted on a society that has become increasingly outraged by the belt-tightening.\n\nWhile markets and fellow EU leaders have welcomed Papademos's appointment, Greece's ever burgeoning class of anti-austerity protesters lead by an increasingly virulent bloc of leftists and militant unionists have denounced the economist as the embodiment of the \"logic of banks and markets\".\n\n\"We have an extraordinary situation where the orthodox communist party is now the main opposition party given the make-up of the new government,\" said political analyst Giorgos Kyrtsos. \"With Greece poised to lead Europe in record numbers of unemployed, with the crisis being so out of control and a more powerful left in opposition I predict great social chaos in the months ahead,\" he said. \"This is a nation that is very resistant to reform and I don't think for a minute that the new government is going to have it easy.\"\n\nIn a sign of the looming friction Antonis Samaras, the new Democrat leader who has fiercely opposed the fiscal remedies meted out to Greece by the EU and IMF, insisted in a national address that the government was a temporary administration that would lead the country to elections.\n\n\"I stress our views on the policies being implemented remain the same. And they have been totally vindicated because [enforcing them] we were lead into deadlock.\"\n\nTellingly, the streets of Athens were plastered on Friday with posters calling on Greeks to participate in protests, work stoppages and mass rallies in the coming days.\n\n\"We didn't get rid of George Papandreou to put a banker in power,\" said a young communist who gave his name as Dimitris as he marched, baton in hand, outside parliament. \"The only answer to the mess we are in is social uprising and the end of all these barbaric measures.\""
