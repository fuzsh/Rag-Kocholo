        "text": "I greet the opening of the 1st Hellenic Multi Sector Investment and Trade Mission to Kenya, which is organized by the Honorary Consulate of Kenya to the Hellenic Republic, with the support of the Hellenic Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and I congratulate the participating Greek entrepreneurs, wishing that this Mission will mark the beginning of a systematic and constructive cooperation between our two countries in the crucial spheres of the economy and business.\n\nThe bilateral relations with Kenya, to the friendly people of which I convey the warmest greetings, are based on solid foundations. Taking though into account that our economic and trade exchanges are not fulfilling their potential, we have the obligation not only to widen and deepen our traditional fields of cooperation, but also to develop new ones, and to take advantage of the comparative advantages of our two economies.\n\nThroughout the centuries, my country has always contributed and continues to contribute to forging economic and trade links. Combining economic development with touristic and cultural cooperation among peoples, Greece continues to be a trade and cultural crossroad, and an island of security in the wider area.\n\nDespite the adverse economic situation, Greece belongs to the hard core of both the European Union and the Eurozone, and, by undertaking a great national effort, which has already started bearing fruit, to stimulate growth and to overcome the crisis, demonstrates its resolve to stay its European course.\n\nWith these thoughts, and the certainty that the 1st Hellenic Trade Mission to Kenya will succeed and lead to tangible results, I wish success for the proceedings of the Forum and the business meetings."
