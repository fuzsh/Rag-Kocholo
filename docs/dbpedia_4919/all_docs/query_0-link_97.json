        "text": "Greece's new unity government under interim Prime Minister Lucas Papademos was sworn in on Friday to ratify a crucial EU bailout deal and pull the country back from the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nFinance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, 54, kept his post in the incoming team which includes a former EU commissioner and several far-right politicians, a first since democracy was restored in 1974 after the fall of an army dictatorship.\n\nEx-EU environment commissioner Stavros Dimas, 70, takes over the foreign ministry under a power-sharing deal between the socialist Pasok party, the conservative New Democracy and the nationalist Laos party.\n\nTwelve members of the outgoing socialist administration retained their posts, while the conservatives were also given the defence ministry, which will be run by ex-Athens mayor and former career diplomat Dimitris Avramopoulos, 58.\n\nThe nationalists received the infrastructure ministry and three junior ministry positions.\n\nThe new infrastructure minister, 47-year-old Makis Voridis, is a trained lawyer who formerly headed the Hellenic Front, a fledgling party with close links to the National Front movement in France.\n\nThe new far-right deputy development minister in charge of shipping, 39-year-old Adonis Georgiadis, until recently ran a publishing house whose editions include an anti-Semitic pamphlet and books on ancient Greek history, which he promoted in a late-night television show popular with satirists.\n\nThe swearing-in ceremony was delayed by two hours owing to last-minute negotiations between the three coalition partners, reports said.\n\nThe new government's first job will be to persuade the European Union and International Monetary Fund to disburse an eight billion euro ($A10.77 billion) slice of aid from a 2010 bailout deal that is needed by December 15 before state coffers run dry.\n\nThen it must force through painful austerity measures exacted as the price for a second EU rescue package which gives Athens 100 billion euros in loans, the same amount in debt reduction and a further 30 billion euros in guarantees."
