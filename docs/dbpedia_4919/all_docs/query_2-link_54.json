        "text": "Lucas Papademos has been named Greece's interim prime minister and charged with the tough job of saving the debt-plagued country from default, bankruptcy and an exit from the eurozone.\n\nMr Papademos's appointment comes after four days of intense talks to form a coalition government, which aims to approve a new financial aid deal. The 64-year-old replaces outgoing leader George Papandreou.\n\nDespite the end to Greece's deadlock, markets remained jittery overnight on fears Italy's political stalemate and debt bonds could threaten a global recession.\n\nLondon's FTSE 100 lost 0.2 per cent, Germany's DAX ended the day 0.7 per cent higher, while France's CAC 40 lost 0.3 per cent by the close of trade.\n\nShortly before the close on Wall Street the Dow Jones was 1.2 per cent higher.\n\nGreece's coalition will be sworn in on Friday (local time) and is expected to operate until early elections in February.\n\nMr Papademos, a respected figure in European capitals and on financial markets, called on all Greeks to contribute to resolving the huge problems faced by a country at a \"crucial crossroads\".\n\nHe said his new administration's main mandate is to implement a eurozone bailout deal and called for wider backing for the coalition.\n\n\"The Greek economy is facing huge problems despite the efforts undertaken,\" he said.\n\n\"The choices we will make will be decisive for the Greek people.\n\n\"The path will not be easy but I am convinced the problems will be resolved faster and at a smaller cost if there is unity, understanding and prudence.\"\n\nMr Papademos cuts a grey and uncharismatic figure in the colourful and chaotic world of Greek politics, but also has a reputation for being calm at a time when the nation is clamouring for some kind of stability.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"He's a clear policy thinker. He was never involved in politics. He knows what needs to be done,\" said Thanos Papasavvas, head of currency management at Investec Asset Management in London.\n\nIn a sign of the daunting problems he will face, Greek unemployment jumped to a record high of 18.4 per cent in August - at the height of the tourism season when the rate traditionally falls - from 16.5 per cent in July.\n\nThe Greek stock market jumped sharply when Mr Papademos arrived at the presidential palace to begin talks with the head of state and political leaders.\n\nHis appointment was held up for four days amid political squabbling and over demands he reportedly made about holding elections later than the February date pencilled in.\n\nThe presidential statement made no mention of a snap ballot date.\n\nMr Papademos's first job will be to persuade the EU and IMF to disburse the eight-billion-euro slice of aid from a 2010 bailout deal that is desperately needed by December 15.\n\nThen he must force through painful austerity measures exacted as the price for a second EU bailout package which gives Athens 100 billion euros in loans, the same amount in debt reduction and a further 30 billion in guarantees.\n\nDrawing a firm line in the sand, crisis-weary France and Germany last week gave Athens a stark choice: adopt belt-tightening measures or leave the euro.\n\nThe new premier must also bring together Greece's warring politicians for a unity administration in a country used to adversarial politics - combat rather than compromise - ahead of elections provisionally set for February.\n\nLoading..."
