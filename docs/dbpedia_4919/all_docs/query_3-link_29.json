        "text": "New Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has said the priority of his incoming coalition cabinet is to seek unity to keep Greece in the eurozone.\n\n\"The choices we make will be decisive for the Greek people,\" he said, adding that the euro was vital for prosperity.\n\nDebt-laden Greece must quickly approve a EU bailout to secure vital loans.\n\nMr Papademos, a former European Central Bank vice-president, was named on Thursday after protracted talks. His cabinet is to be sworn in on Friday.\n\nMr Papademos, who is not a member of parliament, will head the interim government until elections can take place in February.\n\nReports say he has accepted that the current Finance Minister, Evangelos Venizelos, remains in place. The exact make-up of the new coalition government is yet to be agreed.\n\nMr Papademos, 64, was named following days of tough negotiations between party leaders.\n\nSpeaking after the announcement, he said he was taking over at a \"critical point\" for Greece.\n\n\"The path will not be easy but I am convinced the problems will be solved faster and at a smaller cost if there is unity and consensus,\" he told reporters.\n\nMr Papademos said his first priorities would be to ratify the 130bn euro ($177bn; Â£111bn) rescue package agreed at an EU summit last month, and to implement the policies linked to it.\n\nThat will involve another round of austerity measures, which have already proved hugely unpopular with the Greek public.\n\nLeaders of the three main parties making up a new government of national unity had been meeting the Greek president to try to reach a deal.\n\nMr Papademos replaces Greece's outgoing Prime Minister George Papandreou, who was forced to step aside after a disastrous call for a referendum on the eurozone rescue package.\n\nThe referendum plan was dropped within a few days, but not before sparking the wider financial and political crisis which led to Mr Papandreou's forced withdrawal from the top job, even though he narrowly survived a confidence vote.\n\nThe new PM will also face a confidence vote in parliament, which is expected to happen on Monday, Greek state TV reported.\n\nIn Italy, meanwhile, there was increasing speculation that former European Commissioner Mario Monti would take over from outgoing Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nThe markets appeared to calm amid hopes that the economist would take over the reins shortly, correspondents say, and borrowing levels fell back from the previous day's record highs."
