Lucas Papademos, the former Vice President of the European Central Bank, could be the new Prime Minister of Greece (via Zerohedge), heading the transitional government after the George Papandreou ditched the referendum which infuriated the German and the French, got pass the vote of confidence, and subsequently failed to form a coalition government as the main opposition party wasnâ€™t impressed by his call for national unity government under him.

According to the latest from the Financial Times, George Papandreou met Greek President Caralos Papoulias with Opposition leader Antonis Samaras (who insisted previously that George Papandreou has to step down and was more interested in a snap election rather than a coalition government) to discuss forming a new government as George Papandreou steps down. It is now suggested that Lucas Papademos will be the new PM, while finance minister Evangelos Venizelos and Antonis Samaras will be the vice PMs (via Zerohedge).
