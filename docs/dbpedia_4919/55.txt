Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said his priority is to ensure the payment of a sixth loan under a European Union-led bailout to avert financial collapse, hours after Prime Minister Lucas Papademos took charge as head of a new interim government.

Venizelos retained his posts as deputy premier and finance minister in the government sworn in yesterday by Archbishop Hieronymos of Athens and All Greece. The clock is ticking on the payment of the 8 billion-euro ($11 billion) loan installment under the 110 billion-euro EU-led rescue agreed on in May 2010.
