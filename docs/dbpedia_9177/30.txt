Billboard magazine generally uses a variety of fonts. While some are used in specific issues, others remain in all issues and are part of the magazine’s identity. In November 2021, Billboard introduced the use of Flecha and Flecha Brônzea by R-Typography, in the main titles and highlights, alongside Acumin by Adobe, Heroic Condensed by TypeTrust, Neue Haas Grotesk by Commercial Type, and LL Circular by Lineto. The included images additionally show FF Attribute Mono by Fontfont and Benton Modern Italic by Font Bureau.
