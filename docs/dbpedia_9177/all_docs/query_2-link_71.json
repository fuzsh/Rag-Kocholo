        "text": "Topline\n\nAriana Grande’s new single “yes, and” reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in its first week on the list, as No. 1 debuts go from being a rare feat to a frequent occurrence, driven by changes to Billboard’s rules, a pivot toward streaming and dedicated fanbases who mobilize on social media to boost artists.\n\nKey Facts\n\nKey Background\n\nNo. 1 debuts are also more frequent now because fans’ ability to influence the charts has increased thanks to streaming, which monetizes every play of a song, and because fans can mobilize together on social media to promote their favorite artist, Billboard reported. Some artists known to have large online fanbases have repeatedly debuted at the top of the Hot 100: Grande and Taylor Swift each accomplished the feat six times, and BTS has debuted atop the chart five times. Music super-fans spend “80% more money on music each month than the average U.S. music listener,” according to music sales data firm Luminate, and Warner Music Group CEO Robert Kyncl reportedly told analysts last year the label is focusing on how to “better monetize the artist and songwriter superfan relationship.”\n\nNews Peg\n\nGrande’s latest single, “yes, and,” became the 74th song to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100 this week. The song was streamed more than 27 million times and downloaded 53,000 times, Billboard reported, allowing Grande to dethrone reigning No. 1 song “Lovin on Me” by Jack Harlow. To bolster the song’s chance of debuting atop the chart, Grande released 14 digital versions of the song, Billboard reported, which included a sped-up version, a slowed-down remix, an a capella version, and an extended version—all of which were available in clean and explicit variations—as well as instrumental edits. All of these versions were discounted on iTunes at 69 cents apiece, down from the typical $1.29 the platform charges for a song download.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nOnly four songs debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 between 1999 and 2008, and they were all the debut singles of “American Idol” contestants: Clay Aiken’s “This Is the Night” in 2003, Fantasia’s “I Believe” in 2004, Carrie Underwood’s “Inside Your Heaven” in 2005 and Taylor Hicks’ “Do I Make You Proud” in 2006. During those years, when the show would easily attract more than 25 million viewers, singles released shortly after a contestant’s win would debut high on the Hot 100 off the strength of digital sales, Billboard reported.\n\nContra\n\nWhether songs debut at No. 1 also depends on the strength of what’s currently reigning atop the chart. Had the dominant “Old Town Road” not topped the Hot 100 for 19 weeks in 2019, that year could have had at least five more No. 1 debuts, Billboard reported.\n\nTangent\n\nLike Grande’s latest hit, many artists have begun releasing alternate versions of their songs with a sped-up or slowed-down tempo in response to trends on TikTok to better their chances at chart success. Though sped-up remixes are nothing new, TikTok users have reignited demand for them: The hashtag #spedup, largely consisting of fan-made remixes, has amassed more than 44 billion views. Artists and their labels have capitalized on this trend, including Steve Lacy, whose hit “Bad Habit” stalled at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a few weeks before finally rising to No. 1. Aiding Lacy in his climb to the top was a sped-up remix of his hit single that his label urged him to release. Though Lacy told the Guardian he thought a sped-up remix would be “gross,” he ultimately acquiesced, telling his label: “OK, sure – I’m No. 2 and I want to be No. 1, so go ahead.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWhy Have There Been So Many No. 1 Debuts This Year on the Hot 100?
