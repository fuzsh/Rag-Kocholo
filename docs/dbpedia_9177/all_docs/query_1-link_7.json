        "text": "Billboard is an American entertainment and music magazine. It was first published in November of 1894 as an entertainment publication and is distinguished as being among the oldest trade magazines in the world. The magazine originally focused on bill posting and outdoor amusements before concentrating on music and related fields beginning in the 30's Most of the 1980's, 90's and 00's issues are available thanks to a donation by chart historian Monty Greenly. Many 60's issues come from Kees Brinkerink. Other contributors include Rodolfo Ovalle, Rob Hawkins, and Arie den Dulk. Help...\n\nHelp us Fix Incomplete Issues\n\nPlease help us add missing pages.
