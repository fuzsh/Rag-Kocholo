        "text": "The Kesha versus Dr. Luke saga continues this week with the news that the embattled singer was forced to pull out of an upcoming performance at the Billboard Music Awards. Dick Clark Productions, which is overseeing Sunday’s awards show, released a statement yesterday explaining the last-minute cancellation: “Kesha accepted an invitation to perform on the show and she received written approval from Dr. Luke’s record label, Kemosabe Records. Kemosabe subsequently rescinded its approval following a media report on Wednesday, May 11, regarding Kesha’s appearance on the BBMAs.”\n\nThe aforementioned media report was TMZ’s claim that Kesha was apparently planning on delivering a performance that would make direct references to her ongoing legal battle against her former producer, Dr. Luke. The singer has never openly addressed her legal problems onstage, but at last week’s Humane Society of the United States gala, she performed a cover of Lady Gaga’s “Til It Happens to You,” a song about sexual assault, and dedicated it to “every man, woman, child, and animal that has ever been abused.” Kesha’s lawsuit accused Dr. Luke of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse.\n\nAfter the statement was released on Tuesday, Kesha took to Instagram to express her frustration with the decision and said that she was only planning on singing Bob Dylan’s “It Ain’t Me Babe.” “I just wanted to make very clear that this performance was about me honoring one of my favorite songwriters of all time and has never had anything at all to do with Dr. Luke,” she wrote. “I was never going to use a picture of him, speak of him, or allude to my legal situation in any way.”"
