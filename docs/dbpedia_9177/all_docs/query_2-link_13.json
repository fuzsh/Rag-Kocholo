        "text": "2023 was the year of Republic Records – again.\n\nFor a third year in a row, Republic is No. 1 on Billboard’s three leading year-end label rankings: Top Labels, Billboard 200 Labels and Billboard Hot 100 Labels. The company logged the trio of achievements for the first time in 2021. The Top Labels recap represents aggregated metrics for labels’ performance on the weekly Billboard 200 albums and Hot 100 songs charts combined during the 2023 charting period (Nov. 19, 2022-Oct. 21, 2023).\n\nExplore All of Billboard’s 2023 Year-End Charts\n\nRepublic has triumphed on the Top Labels tally in seven of the last nine years, and as the top Hot 100 label in 10 of the last 12 years.\n\nIn the 2023 tracking period, Republic logged 75 albums on the weekly Billboard 200 chart, including the most that hit the top 40 (40), top 10 (21) and No. 1 (eight) of any label.\n\nRepublic holds six of the year-end top 10 Billboard 200 Albums (Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 9) – the first time a label has claimed that many titles in the year-end top 10 since the Billboard 200 began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in 1956. In the year-end top 10 for 2023, Republic has Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time (No. 1, released via Big Loud/Mercury/Republic), Taylor Swift’s Midnights (No. 2), Drake and 21 Savage’s Her Loss (OVO Sound/Republic, No. 4), Wallen’s Dangerous: The Double Album (Big Loud/Republic, No. 5), Metro Boomin’s Heroes & Villains (Boominati/Republic, No. 6) and Swift’s Lover (No. 9).\n\nRepublic is the first label with the year-end Nos. 1 and 2 albums since 2005, when Interscope achieved the feat. In 2005, Interscope had the year-end top two titles with 50 Cent’s The Massacre and Eminem’s Encore at Nos. 1 and 2, respectively (both released via Shady/Aftermath/Interscope).\n\nOn the weekly Hot 100 during the 2023 chart-year eligibility period, Republic charted more entries (172), top 40 hits (98), top 10s (29) and No. 1s (five) than any other label.\n\nPlus, for the second year in a row, Republic achieves the year-end No. 1 Hot 100 Song, as Wallen’s “Last Night” (released via Big Loud/Mercury/Republic) is tops. A year ago, Glass Animals’ “Heat Waves” (Wolf Tone/Polydor/Republic) led the ranking.\n\nBillboard’s year-end music Top Labels chart represents aggregated metrics for the labels’ performance on the weekly Billboard 200 albums chart and the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart combined during the 2023 chars tracking year: Nov. 19, 2022 through Oct. 21, 2023-dated charts. Any activity registered before or after an album or song’s chart run isn’t considered in this ranking. The individual Billboard 200 Labels and Billboard Hot 100 Labels rankings represent the same measurement, but for each specific hart, during the same tracking period."
