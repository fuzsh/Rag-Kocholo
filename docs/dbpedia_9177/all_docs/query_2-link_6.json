        "text": "It may be easy to boil down Republic’s monster year — in which it amassed a 13.5% current market share, closer to that of the entire Warner Music Group (17%) than second-place Interscope Geffen A&M (8.8%) — to the huge successes of Taylor Swift and Morgan Wallen. Combined, they accounted for seven of the top 10 albums on Luminate’s year-end charts in 2023. But the label has developed a track record of breaking artists through slow and steady development, too, with Republic/Mercury’s Noah Kahan the latest example. The Vermont-seasoned singer-songwriter’s album Stick Season and single of the same name hit No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and No. 14 on the Hot 100, respectively, and led to performances on Saturday Night Live and a best new artist Grammy nomination. While Swift’s success is “unprecedented” and Wallen “has really become the face of country music right now,” Roppo says, “Noah Kahan has proven unstoppable, too. He carved out a niche and resonated in a big way because his songs are so honest and he’s such a fantastic performer.”\n\nWeaver, who’s the label’s movie music guru, oversaw the soundtrack for the year’s biggest blockbuster, Barbie, which raked in $1.5 billion at theaters globally, according to Box Office Mojo. The accompanying album, which features songs from such Atlantic artists as Lizzo and Charli XCX, moved 126,000 units in its opening week, good for a No. 2 debut on the Billboard 200, and has spent 26 weeks so far on the chart. “The soundtrack and film have played a pivotal role in shaping global pop culture in 2023,” says Weaver, and that success “underscored the enduring relevance of massive soundtracks in today’s marketplace, particularly when strategically aligned with the right intellectual property and propelled by hit records all custom-created for the project.” Those looks are more important, he continues, “in a music landscape saturated with new releases.”\n\nPulijal’s 2023 included giving shine to Billboard’s No. 4 new artist of the year, Ice Spice, and one of the greatest bands of all time, The Beatles. The 10-year Capitol veteran worked closely with Spice’s label, 10K Projects, and her manager, James Rosemond Jr., to conceive of and execute the marketing efforts behind her yearlong success. He did the same with Apple Records and Universal Music Group U.K. to boost the Fab Four’s “Now and Then” to No. 1 on the Adult Alternative Airplay chart — 53 years after the group last topped a Billboard radio chart, Adult Contemporary, with “Let It Be” in 1970. “The approach was to treat it like a brand-new record, albeit 50 years in the making, that would become an important part of the cultural conversation,” says Pulijal, who also masterminded the digital and global marketing campaigns for four of the most viral songs of the year on TikTok and Spotify: Sam Smith and Kim Petras’ “Unholy,” Toosii’s “Favorite Song,” Doechii’s “What It Is (Block Boy)” (featuring Kodak Black) and Troye Sivan’s “Rush.”\n\nIn addition to the monster success of Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” — the label’s biggest hit of 2023, with eight weeks atop the Hot 100 and multiple chart records — Mallory’s year benefited from the continued success of Beyoncé’s 2022 Renaissance album. Fueled by Queen Bey’s 2023 concert documentary of the same name, which grossed $43.6 million globally, according to Box Office Mojo, the set was No. 1 on Billboard’s year-end Top Dance/Electronic albums chart and helped put Columbia at the head of the year-end Dance/Electronic labels ranking. In 2024, Mallory will get an assist from Joe Gallo, who was promoted to GM from executive vp/head of sales, where he worked on Hot 100 campaigns for Cyrus, Adele, Beyoncé, Harry Styles, Tyler, The Creator, Rosalía and Lil Nas X, who dropped his latest single, “J Christ,” on Jan. 12.\n\nWith Edge, Fleckenstein and Pitts working in lockstep, RCA scored a stream of 2023 successes led by current nine-time Grammy nominee SZA and her crossover second album, SOS, and seven-time Grammy nominee Victoria Monét’s Jaguar II. Also contributing to RCA’s winning year were Doja Cat, Tate McRae, Tyler Childers, Latto and Young Nudy, as well as Davido and Wizkid on the Afrobeats front. The label also developed novel ways to engage with its artists beyond music development and reach new audiences through merchandise deals, experiential media, TV, film and gaming. “The passion and creativity from our leaders to our newest recruits leaves me speechless on a daily basis,” Fleckenstein says. “This is what makes RCA a music company, not a record company.”\n\nIn 2023, Sony Music Nashville artist Luke Combs earned a crossover smash with his rendition of Tracy Chapman’s 1988 hit “Fast Car,” which reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 and ruled the Country Airplay chart for five weeks. Goodman says the song’s global success “can’t be overstated — commercially and culturally.” The label also led the charge in breaking new artist Nate Smith, who earned two Country Airplay No. 1s: “Whiskey on You” and “World on Fire.” Megan Moroney earned an RIAA double-certified platinum No. 4 Country Airplay hit with “Tennessee Orange” and released her critically acclaimed debut album, Lucky, which reached No. 10 on Top Country Albums. “Just to have signed her with how competitive it was and doing so with our partners at Columbia in New York made it all the more gratifying,” Goodman says. “She’s a hit machine and a critical darling, and she’s just getting started — clearly the new female breakout this past year.”\n\nSony Music Latin dominated Billboard’s year-end Top Latin Labels and Top Hot Latin Songs Labels charts, a double win fueled by such contemporary stars and enduring legacy acts as Shakira, Manuel Turizo, Rauw Alejandro and Maluma. “Considering the fierce competition in the Latin market, where Latin labels compete with general-market labels, international distributors and hedge funds — all of whom want their piece of the cake — being named No. 1 is a huge recognition that reflects the hard work of an amazing team,” Gallardo says. Highlights include Shakira’s collaborations with Bizarrap, Ozuna and Alejandro, and Fuerza Régida, which released Pa las Baby’s y Belikeada in October and was named Billboard’s top duo/group of 2023, the first Latin band to top the year-end list. Studio albums by Shakira and a new deal with Maluma should further fuel Sony’s momentum in 2024, despite, Gallardo says, “geopolitical instability” in the Latin region and international tensions.\n\nEpic’s superpower was (once again) hip-hop in 2023. Travis Scott bagged a third Billboard 200 No. 1 with Utopia, which was nominated for a best rap album Grammy. British American rapper 21 Savage, who is now a U.S. citizen, received five Grammy nods for his collaborative album with Drake, Her Loss; on Jan. 12, he dropped his own Billboard 200 chart-topper, American Dream, an album inspired by the upcoming movie of the same name, in which Stranger Things actor Caleb McLaughlin will portray him. Lewis hails South African newcomer Tyla’s breakout success with “Water”: “She created music with a global appeal that is nominated for a Grammy,” he says. “The even more exciting thing is that this is just the beginning for her.” Epic also released André 3000’s head-turning woodwind instrumentals album, New Blue Sun. “It’s about building a roster that speaks to everybody,” Rhone says. “We’re developing artists and building superstars across genres who are diverse, unique and help propel the culture forward.”\n\nMabe officially ascended to the chair/CEO role at UMGN in April and got to work “rebuilding the staff, infrastructure and signing artists who will build the new era of business for country music,” she says. As for its current roster, in November, Chris Stapleton’s Higher became his fifth Top Country Albums ruler, and Mabe and her team ended 2023 on a festive note by teaming with Universal Music Enterprises to propel Brenda Lee’s “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” to No. 1 on the Hot 100 65 years after its release.\n\nOne year into running 300 Elektra, Liles celebrated two breakout artists and a big comeback for one of imprint YSL Records’ biggest stars. PinkPantheress notched her first Hot 100 hit with the Ice Spice-assisted “Boy’s a Liar, Pt. 2,” which peaked at No. 3, and country artist Bailey Zimmerman, who is signed to Elektra and Warner Music Nashville, earned his first top 10 Hot 100 hit with “Rock and a Hard Place.” And five months after rapper Gunna’s December 2022 release from jail, he released A Gift & A Curse on YSL, which became his fifth top 10 Billboard 200 album. The album’s hit single “fukumean” also reached No. 4 on the Hot 100. “What I love about these success stories is that, while they’re happening in very different genres with completely different sounds and aesthetics,” Liles says, “they are all moving and impacting culture in a significant way.”\n\nKarol G’s Mañana Será Bonito made history in February when it debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, a first for an all-Spanish-language album by a woman. It was a landmark moment for Latin music, as well as one of Universal Music Latino’s biggest successes. The project, Karol’s last release through the label that signed her in 2016 — she is now at Universal Music Group’s Interscope — went on to win album of the year at the Latin Grammys in November. Another big win was Morat’s touring success with more than 1 million tickets sold in 2023, according to Universal Music Latino, which led to the Colombian band’s upcoming first stadium tour in Latin America. “Artists like J Balvin, Karol G, Feid, Sebastián Yatra and Morat are developing a capacity for success both in streams as well as ticket sales and merchandising that is having a very positive impact on our growth from an artistic and economic point of view,” López says.\n\nLee says, “2023 was massive for our growth,” in the wake of South Korean entertainment giant HYBE’s $300 million acquisition of Atlanta-based Quality Control’s parent company, QC Media Holdings, in February. Now under HYBE America, which is led by CEO Scooter Braun, QC’s roster — which includes Quavo, Lil Baby, Lil Yachty and City Girls — joins SB Projects and Big Machine Label Group. Quavo released his 2023 second solo album, Rocket Power, in honor of late Migos member Takeoff, and it reached No. 4 on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Lil Baby’s It’s Only Us Tour became the seventh-highest-grossing rap tour last year, making $15.7 million. And Lil Yachty started 2023 by dropping his fifth studio album, the psychedelic rocker Let’s Start Here, which landed in the top 10 of Billboard’s, Complex’s and Rolling Stone’s best albums of 2023 lists. (It was also his third top 10 album on the Billboard 200.) Outside of its marquee artists, QC also celebrated “breakouts with new artists like Gloss Up and Karraboo,” Lee says, “all accumulating into a year we are so proud of.”\n\nAlamo Records racked up big wins with its two flagship hip-hop artists: Lil Durk, who hit No. 2 on the Hot 100 with “All My Life” (featuring J. Cole) and a No. 3 Billboard 200 album, Almost Healed, and Rod Wave, whose Nostalgia spent two weeks at No. 1 on the latter chart in the fall. Both artists also finished 2023 on Billboard’s year-end Top Artists chart, with Wave at No. 18 and Durk at No. 24. Elsewhere, the Sony Music-affiliated label continued the rollout of its artist and label services company Santa Anna, which over the past year struck deals with former Interscope A&R Baroline Diaz’s Great Day Records and former Avex senior vp Lucas Thomashow’s newly launched SANA label, among others.\n\nKline and Lacy fostered newcomer Bailey Zimmerman’s continued success in 2023, as his “Rock and a Hard Place” spent six weeks in the penthouse of the Country Airplay chart. Zimmerman, who is signed to both WMN and Elektra, also released his full-length Religiously. The Album. and was named Billboard’s 2023 new country artist of the year. Ashley McBryde won her first Grammy for best country duo/group performance with “Never Wanted To Be That Girl,” alongside Carly Pearce. Her 2023 album, The Devil I Know, generated 155 million global streams last year. And Texan Cody Johnson drew a global audience with his latest album, Leather. He also earned a male vocalist of the year nomination from the Country Music Association Awards and three nominations at the 2023 Academy of Country Music Awards. “These successes are all different shades of the same story — a story of artist development and authenticity,” Lacy says. “That’s where Warner Music Nashville shines.”\n\nA year after signing breakout artists Armani White and Muni Long, Def Jam scored again with Coco Jones, whose “ICU” became her first single to chart on the Hot 100 and spent four weeks at No. 1 on Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay. The Tennessee-born singer also became the label’s second best new artist Grammy nominee in the past two years, following Muni Long in 2023. The label lured DJ Khaled and his We the Best imprint away from Epic, and Universal Music Group named him a global creative consultant. It also brought on veteran A&R executive Riggs Morales to bolster the executive ranks. After two years atop the storied hip-hop label, Balogun also began to see some of the fruits of his Afrobeats strategy as Adekunle Gold, Odumodublvck and Stonebwoy released critically acclaimed projects.\n\nTwo years into the top job, Island’s executive duo spent 2023 breaking such new artists as Disney Channel actress-turned-pop star Sabrina Carpenter, whose “Nonsense” was a top 10 Pop Airplay song that generated 75 million streams in January, after which she opened for Taylor Swift. “Sabrina is breaking globally in an extremely fragmented environment,” Eshak says. (Indeed, “Nonsense” rose to No. 36 on the Billboard Global 200 in February.) Eshak also cites country singer Wyatt Flores and dance-pop singer Chappell Roan as up-and-coming Island artists with promising futures. “We’re developing real careers across all genres,” he says. Adds Majid: “We pride ourselves by taking a long view on the artists we sign and how they’re marketed, knowing it can take three or four years before they break.”\n\nThe Walt Disney Company’s 100th anniversary year provided ample opportunities to spotlight its extensive musical legacy worldwide — particularly DMG’s live-concert business, Bunt notes. Among Disney Concerts’ more than 1,100 performances over the past year, highlights included the launch of its first “festival-style” event, the ­immersive Disney: The Castle in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; the Disney Music and Fireworks spectacular in Japan; Pixar Disney’s Coco Live-to-Film ­concert, performed before 25,000 on Día de los Muertos at Mexico City’s Plaza de Toros; and major shows in Paris and at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Bowl. “It was an incredible year for live concerts and their ability to unite audiences around the world,” Bunt says, and that translated across platforms for Disney Music — which he says accumulated 3.5 billion listening hours across digital service providers and social media in 2023.\n\nDuque says Warner Music Latin America established a “formidable presence” in the recording business thanks to new signings, including Argentine star Maria Becerra, whose upcoming March 23 River Plate Stadium show in Buenos Aires sold out in less than 90 minutes — a record. Mexican influencer and singer Kim Loaiza scored her first major Billboard breakthrough when her debut album, X Amor, debuted at No. 9 on the Latin Pop Albums chart in late December. Puerto Rican hit-maker Myke Towers’ summer anthem, “Lala,” topped the Billboard Global 200 Excl. U.S. chart and peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Global 200. “These achievements collectively signify our capacity to curate and promote the hottest talents, contributing significantly to our growth trajectory,” says Duque, who is in his third year leading Warner’s Latin American operations. “We have built up a powerful roster and are expecting significant releases. We are very excited for 2024.”"
