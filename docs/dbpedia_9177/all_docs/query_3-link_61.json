        "text": "Continuous Message\n\nOutdoor advertising is the only type of media that has constant exposure. No other type of advertising allows your message to be displayed with consistent exposure 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. People spend more time in their vehicle than they do reading the paper and watching the news. Your target audience cannot turn off the billboard (e.g. fast forward, change the channel, flip the page, etc.) They generally drive with their eyes open!\n\nLowest Cost\n\nOutdoor advertising has a lower cost per thousand than any other type of advertising. Outdoor ads cost 80% less than television commercials, 60% less than newspaper ads, and 50% less than radio ads. Billboards have been rated higher than any other type of advertising for their ability to communicate ideas at the lowest possible prices. Small businesses benefit significantly from billboard advertising and they are standard media for most forms of co-op advertising support\n\nReach & Frequency\n\nThe consistency delivered by outdoor advertising means a higher percentage of the target audience reached and a greater number of exposure opportunities as well. Ads on billboards are free to consumers; you do not have to buy a magazine, cable television, or a newspaper to see your advertisement. 75% of Americans rely on billboards to find places while they are traveling. A billboard network with a good location can have more viewers than the super bowl!\n\nFlexibility\n\nAdvances in technology allow for frequent creative changes, both printed and electronically. Many times we can order the print and have it posted one or two days later. Billboards allow you to reach more people faster and easier than any other type of media. Outdoor advertising makes it extremely easy to target, or not to target, a specific market.\n\nRepetition\n\nWhy do 99% of people answer McDonalds when ask to name the first fast food restaurant that comes to their mind? Repetition is extremely helpful when you are trying to increase your product awareness, or when you simply want to get your message across to millions of people. This task can easily be accomplished with billboard campaigns.\n\nSubtle Awareness\n\nBillboards help increase your products awareness, and knowledge which also increases your sales and profits. Outdoor advertising sends us subliminal messages. Billboards are usually the final message we see right before we purchase an item. So why not direct us to your product?"
