        "meta_description": "Promotional campaigns are a crucial business function for informing consumers about products or raising their awareness of them. The correct people must receive the information at the right time and location for an announcement campaign to be successful. One sort of current announcement media uses fixed billboards positioned in key areas to notify implied visitors. These mechanical or electronic billboards are capable of displaying visual content to catch visitorsâ€™ attention, but they are not equipped to engage visitors who are already engaged in the content being presented. However, after reading the information on a billboard, an implicit customer wishes to learn more about or purchase the advertised goods and services (e.g., the product name, a contact member, or a website address). In the end, this implied client may close the deal by purchasing the goods or services through a different channel, including making a phone call, going online and using a web browser, or visiting a physical store. It is nevertheless reasonably feasible for a customer interested in the advertised goods or services to fail to write down the contact information, to write it down incorrectly, or to forget about it afterward.",
