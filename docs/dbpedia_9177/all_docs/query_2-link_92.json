        "text": "Billboard has a massive impact on the way consumers view music today. Chart-toppers usually command the most traffic online and are the most played.\n\nFor an artist, topping the Billboard chart can be the gateway to getting label or management deals (not to mention even attracting brand partnerships).\n\nGiven that Billboard lists the “hottest” releases, charting on Billboard 200, Hot 100, Social 50, and Artist 100 is every artist’s dream.\n\nAfter years of grinding it out as an independent artist, my band Dwellings finally landed on Billboard with our debut full-length record.\n\nThe feeling of seeing your name on that chart is a milestone that validates all the blood, sweat and tears you’ve poured into your craft. However, the path to getting there isn’t always clear. There’s a lot of mystery surrounding how the Billboard charts actually work and what it takes to land on them.\n\nI’m here to pull back the curtain and give you an inside look at the mechanisms powering the Billboard charts.\n\nMy goal is to provide you with actionable tactics for ensuring Billboard, your fans and the industry at large all take notice of your music.\n\nWhat Makes a Hot Song on Billboard\n\nConsidering that streaming is becoming the primary method of music consumption online, Billboard is nowadays basing its chart off of online engagement. They particularly look at these elements:\n\nTrack and album downloads\n\nAlbum sales\n\nRadio airplay\n\nGiven that Spotify, YouTube, and social media (looking at you TikTok) are becoming more and more popular for listener engagement, Billboard takes into account the positive engagement from these platforms.\n\nWhat’s more, Billboard monitors radio stations to see how often they play you music and even how often the listeners request it.\n\nWhat is the process for charting on the Billboard charts?\n\nCharting on the Billboard charts involves four simple steps:\n\n1) Have a timely release\n\n2) Register your release with Music Connect (formerly known as Nielsen SoundScan)\n\n3) Invest in Public Relations and Meta Facebook and Instagram Ads\n\n4) Offer pre-orders and pre-saves\n\nCharting on Billboard takes an unquestionable talent and marketing effort. The good news is that you can bridge the gap between being a talented musician and a global chart-topper by implementing these best practices.\n\n1. Have A Timely Release\n\nWhen you release music, there are a lot of moving parts to coordinate – distributing your music, creating visual assets, promoting and more. Things can easily fall through the cracks if you don’t have a solid plan in place. To avoid issues with your release, make sure you establish a timeline for all tasks well in advance.\n\nAt a minimum, you need to distribute your music through a service like Distrokid or CD Baby at least 4-6 weeks prior to your release date. Failing to do so means your music won’t be available when fans go looking for it, killing your momentum and hurting your streaming numbers and chart potential.\n\nPS – we have a music release planner template that you can use to track all of the important dates for your upcoming release\n\n2. Register Your Release with Music Connect (formerly known as Nielsen SoundScan)\n\nLuminate Music Connect, formerly known as Nielsen Soundscan, is the industry standard tool for tracking music consumption. The company doesn’t publish a cost for the service and depends on how large the label/company is and how many users will have access.\n\nTo register your release with Luminate, you simply need to provide information like your artist name, release titles, ISRC codes and UPC numbers to the following two forms:\n\nISRC Registration\n\nTitle/EAN/UPC Registration\n\nYou must do both – ISRC level and Title/EAN/UPC level in order to qualify.\n\nBoth PR and paid advertising are essential for raising awareness of your music. PR helps establish you as an artist and authority in your genre, while paid ads directly put your music in front of new listeners.\n\nWhen it comes to PR, research publications, blogs, podcasts and influencers that cover music similar to yours. Pitch them on featuring your single, album, music video or other release. Build genuine relationships that could lead to future coverage.\n\nWe have a step by step guide on reaching out to Spotify playlist curators and blogs.\n\nFor paid advertising, focus your budget on platforms where people are actively listening to music like Spotify. Run campaigns optimized for conversions to maximize the number of ears on your music. The more people streaming and engaging with your content, the more likely you are to chart.\n\nWe can set up these paid advertising campaigns for you with our paid advertising management services, or you can learn how to run them yourself.\n\n4. Offer Pre-Orders and Pre-Saves\n\nPre-orders and pre-saves allow you to promote your music before it’s even released. Fans that pre-order or pre-save your release will have it automatically added to their libraries as soon as it drops. This tactic boosts your first-week numbers, increasing your chances of landing on a Billboard chart.\n\nYou can offer pre-orders for physical products on your own website or through services like Bandcamp, MerchNow and CD Baby.\n\nFor pre-saves, use link services like ToneDen, Feature.fm or Linkfire (you can compare the different pre-save options here).\n\nPromote your pre-order and pre-save campaigns heavily on social media and through paid advertising for maximum impact.\n\nThe key to charting on Billboard is understanding how the charts work and taking a strategic approach to your release marketing.\n\nWhile talent and great music are must-haves, actively promoting your work is what turns listeners into fans and helps establish you as an artist on the rise.\n\nKeep working hard, learning from your mistakes and victories, and don’t get discouraged.\n\nYour chart-topping moment will come as long as you never stop creating and connecting with fans.\n\nLooking to get the most out of your next song release?\n\nLearn more about our Viral Song Club to access step by step instructions on generating fans, growing your Spotify, and increase your chances to chart on Billboard.\n\nDon’t have time for a course? No worries!\n\nInquire about our music advertising services, and we will run your marketing campaign for you!\n\nWe’ve helped clients such as Kill Iconic Records’ artists Gold Necklace and Satyr chart billboard.\n\nJust fill out this quick form below, and we will help ya out."
