        "text": "Following the massive success of Taylor Swift‘s initiative to release her re-recorded versions of her first five studio albums, major record labels — which Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group — are changing the terms and conditions of their recording contracts. This move aims to prohibit artists from re-recording their material for a minimum of at least 10 years, but can reportedly go up to 15 or even 30 years following an artist’s departure from their label.\n\nThis news comes as a response to the cultural impact of Swift’s re-recorded albums (including the recently released 1989), lovingly known as Taylor’s Version albums, which have surpassed the sales of their original counterparts and have decreased the value of the original masters previously owned by Scooter Braun.\n\nTop music attorneys have stated that the extended timelines presented in the new recording contracts forbid artists from re-recording their music is a major difference from previous standard contracts, which normally state that artists were allowed to re-record their material five to seven years from their original release date, or at least two years after the contract had expired.\n\nMany of those in the industry have noted how surprising these restrictions are in their client’s contracts, with some (including veteran music attorney Josh Karp) having mentioned that they tried to get rid of it entirely. Such a change marks a big departure from the previous norm in recording contracts, which already imposed a fair amount of restrictions that were agreed upon by the label and artists."
