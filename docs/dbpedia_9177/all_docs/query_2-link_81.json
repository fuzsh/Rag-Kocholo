Attached you will see an image of what I am talking about.\n\nPlotting entities around the (-180, 180 lon) area is vital for the application I am developing, so any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nCesium version:1.29\n\nIf providing URLs is against forum rules, please let me know and I will remove it.\n\nThanks again!\n\nHello,\n\nSorry, I can’t see your picture because photobucket is blocked on our network (you’re always welcome to post links though!)\n\nI believe what you’re seeing is this bug though: https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/3960\n\nIf you’re having a different problem, could you attach the picture to the forum post?\n\nThanks,\n\nHannah\n\nHey Hannah, if IDL refers to the specific area where the 2D map begins its next map iteration with horizontal scrolling then yes, that is it. You'll have to forgive me, I cannot find on the web page where it will allow me to attach an image but I think we are on the same page.\n\nThanks for the help!"
