        "text": "In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels.\n\nLil Wayne's ascent is the story of Cash Money. The Dirty South starts with LaFace Records. The east-coast/west-coast feud is Bad Boy vs. Death Row. In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isnât just a business deal, but a commitment to an identity.\n\nWe wanted to surface the notable labels in hip hopâs history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard (collaborating with Kevin Beacham of Rhymesayers to call out insights). By highlighting the labels who produced the most hits at any given time, weâd understand who was wielding enormous influence on hip hop's sound, distribution, and direction.\n\nHereâs the stats for 600+ labels over the past 25 years:\n\nThe Most Successful Labels in Hip Hop\n\nHip Hop Labels, sorted by their Artists' Performance* on Billboard's Rap Chart (1989-present)\n\nSEARCH:\n\nAll\n\nNY\n\nLA\n\nATL\n\nNOLA\n\nSF\n\nMIA\n\nLabel's top artists include:\n\nLABEL\n\n# OF CHARTING TRACKS\n\n# OF CHARTING ARTISTS\n\nCUMULATIVE WEEKS ON CHART\n\nYEARS CHARTING\n\nWeeks on Chart by Year\n\n1989\n\n2015\n\n*Using the Billboard \"Hot Rap Songs\" chart. We weight a label's tracks based on its chart rank (#1 - #50) and weeks charted. Note that the label-to-artist assignment is very difficult and complex, and in general assigned an artist to whatever label he/she would call out at the start of a track.\n\nThe top ten list reads like a history of hip hop. Def Jam, the pioneer label in hip hop, is properly at #1. Young Money has only been active for the past six years, and itâs at #2, exemplifying the current state of hip hop and its concentration in one place.\n\nLetâs look at just 1989, the launch of Billboardâs âHot Rap Singlesâ chart:\n\nHip Hop Labels in 1989, sorted by their artists' chart performance on billboard\n\nCircle size indicates Billboard performance of Labelâs artists.\n\nBeginning in â94, Bad Boy and Death Row began to compete with major labels for artists. Puff Daddy used his experience at Uptown and with artists such as Heavy D to launch Bad Boy, releasing rap albums with both underground and pop potential (e.g., Notorious B.I.G, Craig Mack).\n\nBad Boyâs growth was followed by its feud with Death Row (Dre, 2pac), forever changing the role of labels in hip hop. Labels were not only the business-side of rap, but now a regional collective of artists who represent an identity and philosophy towards hip hop.\n\nDuring the mid-90s, a number of notable labels launched and gained notoriety:\n\n#8 in the ranking of labels by success on Billboard, Ruffhouse was a joint venture with Columbia, signing Fugees, Cypress Hill, Kris Kross, and Wyclef Jean.\n\nBig Beat began as a house music label, but shifted to hip hop in the 90s, signing Junior M.A.F.I.A., Lilâ Kim, and RZA.\n\nLoud Records was started by Steve Rifkin in â91, represented street-themed music, including Big Pun, Xhibit, Wu Tang, and Mobb Deep.\n\nStarted by Jay Z, Dame Dash, Kareem Burke in '95, Roc-A-Fella consisted primarily of Jay Z releases until the late '90s and early '00s, when the label signed Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, and Cam'ron (and eventually Kanye West in '04).\n\nLetâs look at the current state of hip hop over the past five years:\n\nToday, Young Money is dominating with a lineup of Nicki Minaj, Drake, Tyga, and Lil Wayne.\n\nThe weird thing is that itâs only Young Money. For the past 25 years, thereâs always been mega-popular labels (e.g., Shady/Aftermath, Rawkus, No Limit, Bad Boy) â there were just more of them at one time.\n\nThis is the current state of hip hop: Young Money has been the top label for each of the past five years. For the first time in hip hopâs history, one label has had unprecedented influence. Thereâs one sound and identity dominating the zeitgeist of hip hop.\n\nBut Young Money's success has more to do with the evolving music industry.\n\nArtists donât need the big-budget marketing and distribution of major labels â they start with a grassroots social media following. In 2013, Macklemore famously avoided the label game all together, only signing a distribution deal. Chance the Rapper is still unsigned. Fetty Wap recently signed a deal with 300 Entertainment, but it was only after he had a huge hit with Trap Queen. Instead of several, chart-dominating labels, hits are increasingly released by small, local labels (or even self-released).\n\nSo labels are experimenting, trying to figure out how to stay relevant in a world that needs them less.\n\nSometimes that means staying small. XL Recordings (Adele, M.I.A., FKA Twigs) is one potential model, who keeps its roster small and typically releases no more than six albums a year.\n\nQuality over Quantity\n\nDistribution of Labels, Sorted by their Billboard Success*. Each Bar Represents a Label.\n\nLabel Success*\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nHip Hop Labels\n\nYEAR:\n\n10 years ago, success was spread-out among large to mid-size labels.\n\nToday, hits are concentrated among a few major labels, with the remaining distributed among smaller labels.\n\nYEAR:\n\n*Success = weighting of label's tracks based on its chart rank (#1 - #50) and weeks charted. The y-axis is indexed to the best performing label depicted. Years 1993 - 2001 are excluded; Billboard increased the chart ranking from 30 to 50 tracks during this time period.\n\nOr it means labels can focus on longevity rather than big hits. Without the gatekeepers for distribution, labels and artists make a living without money flowing through major labels. Rhymesayersâ model (who helped on this article) has sustained for 20 years, staying small and working with artists who have deep fan bases rather than the potential for massive commercial success. Tyler the Creatorâs Odd Future Records, Fools Gold (Kid Cudi, Danny Brown, Run the Jewels), and Strange Music (Tech n9ne, Murs, MayDay) donât operate as chart-dominating entities (a nice outcome, but not their focus) â in todayâs music landscape, they can viably support themselves with a loyal, niche market.\n\nAll this means that Young Money might be the last commercially-dominating label in hip hop, an end of an era."
