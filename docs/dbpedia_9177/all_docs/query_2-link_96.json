        "text": "“Cypher 1: Ella”, a collaboration between Mabiland, Emjay, Mare Advertencia, and Delfina Dib, is the label’s first release.”\n\nWarner Music México has announced the launch of Gorgona, a label which will be “completely” run and managed by women, and will also be focused on promoting women talent.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the company Wednesday (April 12), the “historically low” presence of women in key senior industry roles initially led to the formation of Warner Music México’s Gender Equality Committee, comprised exclusively of women across the organization. Then came the idea of creating a label in which all roles — from songwriting to digital music services — would be executed by women."
