        "text": "Lil Uzi Vert’s label and agency really want them to stay in the game despite their recent pledge to retire soon.\n\nDuring night two of their Pink Tape Tour in Chicago on October 23, the Philadelphia rapper revealed that their upcoming album Luv Is Rage 3 will be their “last.” The 28-year-old promised fans that they will embark on one more tour to support the project, but said they will retire from music after it finishes in hopes of leading a “normal life.”\n\nHowever, both Uzi’s label, Generation Now, and talent agency, the Diop Agency, are really hoping to convince them otherwise – so much so, the companies bought a billboard in Uzi’s hometown of Philadelphia to beg them to continue making music.\n\n“Uzi, please don’t retire! Love, your Generation Now family,” the billboard reads before alternating to, “Love your Diop Agency family.”\n\n“Luv Is Rage 3 will be my last album,” Uzi told the crowd last week, which was met by audible disappointment. “No, relax. It’s okay […] After Luv Is Rage 3, I guess I will go on another tour for Luv Is Rage 3. But after that, I wanna try to live a normal life.”\n\nLil Uzi Vert has yet to announce a release date for LIR 3, but they’ve been teasing the album for some time now. Earlier this month, Baby Pluto kickstarted the rollout with a new song called “NFL,” which ostensibly serves as the lead single.\n\nThe upcoming project will serve as the sequel to Luv Is Rage 2, which dropped in August 2017. Home to the smash hit “XO Tour Llif3,” the album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America).\n\nLuv Is Rage 3 will also mark Uzi’s first full-length release since Pink Tape, which arrived this past summer after years of delays and anticipation.\n\nUzi has also been steadily promoting another new project called Barter 16 — a nod to Young Thug‘s 2015 mixtape Barter 6, which itself drew inspiration from Lil Wayne‘s Tha Carter series — although it’s unclear when that will come out or how it fits into their retirement plans.\n\nLil Uzi Vert previously hinted at quitting music back in 2019 while they were working on Eternal Atake, citing similar reasons.\n\n“I wanna take the time out to say I thank each and every one of my supports [sic] but I’m done with music,” they wrote on their Instagram Stories at the time. “I deleted everything[.] I wanna be normal[.] I wanna wake up in 2013. You are free.”"
