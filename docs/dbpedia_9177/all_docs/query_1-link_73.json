Check Out These Audio Engineering Programs.”\n\n“The studio is your classroom at these universities, and the professors your introduction to the music business.”\n\nThey point to the hands-on learning and wide variety of music genres experienced here as solid features of the program.\n\nBut what we offer that most others listed don’t is affordability. We’re proudly public—you get a world-class experience for a fraction of the cost of expensive private schools.\n\nWe’re conveniently located just north of New York City and all its connections to the music industry.\n\nAnd you learn from the best—like Peter Denenberg, chair of the Studio Production program—in a collaborative and supportive music community."
