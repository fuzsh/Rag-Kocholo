        "text": "Media Language:\n\nBillboard Magazine is a popular and current music magazine based in America which was first started in 1894. It is regarded as one of the oldest trade magazines worldwide and each issue is filled recognised record charts including its own ‘Billboard’s Hot 100’ and ‘Billboard 200’. The magazine doesn’t have any one specific genre but instead features music and artists of all types like Miley Cyrus, Drake, Sam Smith, Adele, J Cole and many more. In every weekly issue of the magazine there is a main feature which that issue will focus on and have the artist(s) on the front cover; consistency is kept throughout all or most of the different issue. The magazine has a very professional look but at the same time appears friendly and considerably informal and fun, yet it still includes a lot of information every week for the reader. Most of the issue are very spacious and pictures and images do not overlap one another. On top of this, most of the layouts are very mature and the magazine as a whole doesn’t look overcrowded with too many images, text or even a clash of colours.\n\nA regular aspect of a Billboard magazine is the double page feature spread of a popular celebrity at the time; this is the main selling point of each issue. Something which is also repeated in every single issue is Billboards very own top 100 list of songs and albums, this is another key selling point of the magazine and what sets it apart from other music magazines like Q and Vibe. Below are a few examples of the types of covers, contents pages, feature articles which highlight the layout and style of magazine that Billboard publish every week:\n\nAudience:\n\nThe type of audience that Billboard magazine appeals to is of a wide variety as it is aimed at both genders of people, who are fans of the music featured and those who want to be up to date on current music. This target audience includes anyone in their young teens through to people in their early fifties; it has quite a young target audience (especially in comparison to other music magazines such a Q) but this is due to it’s very modern and new layout and style.Statistics show that 71% of their readers are between the age of 25-54 and 82% are college graduates. These figures demonstrate that a very large proportion of the magazines readers are of a good education and are considerately intellectual. Billboard magazine is specifically made for music that is very ‘now’ and artists who are at the peak in their careers. The magazine provides its readers with the very latest and most recent songs but also covers all genres of music, which is done to reach the the biggest potential market. As well as this, the magazine doesn’t broadcast any gossip of celebrity news of the artists it features and instead focuses on the music itself. Despite this, I think that my magazine will include some aspects of celebrity news as to offer something more than competing music magazines.\n\nBillboard magazine uses the ‘Uses and Gratifications’ theory and one of the ways it uses this is people may be able to empathise with the style of artist on the cover, any personal stories they share about their own lives may be similar to the same problems that some of the readers face. It is also possible that competition entry’s or articles about upcoming, young and new artists could inspire readers who are hoping to make it into the music industry. On top of this the way which the artists acts and their views/opinions on matters may make readers relate or identify with them if they feel the same way. The way that Billboard use the ‘Uses and Gratifications’ theories would potentially make the audience enjoy the magazine more is because they will be able to find common ground with famous and well respected artists. Due to the fact that a lot of people view celebrities as completely different from themselves, having something in common with them or being able to relate to them on any level will appeal to average people who aspire to be known or people that look up to some of the artists.\n\nAs I have briefly mentioned, there are several opportunities in some issues of Billboard magazine which allow the audience to participate in various competitions. As well as this, in every single issue there are subscription promotions and offers which are there to persuade the current audience to become a weekly buyer of the magazine; this is done by offering them the ‘best deal’ so that they are actually saving money when they subscribe, in comparison to buying the magazine individually each week. Billboard magazine is also a website and in the actual magazine it gives details of its various social media sites, these being; Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest, YouTube and Instagram. Having this many different social media sites means that Billboard is able to gain access to an even wider audience therefore giving the magazine the opportunity to expand and attract even more people.\n\nI also think that despite very similar information being available on the internet for free, there is a certain nostalgia to actually buying and reading a magazine and I also think that this is an aspect which will appeal to the audience, especially those who are slightly older and possibly aren’t constantly on the internet and up to date on social media. This is the main reason why it would appeal to people to buy the actual magazine; as everything is slowly becoming more engrossed around the internet and a lot of things are now ‘exclusively available online only’ the fact that Billboard is still available to purchase it stores makes it different to other online magazines and keeps the same values that it had when it first started, decades ago.\n\nRepresentation:\n\nBillboard is very versatile when it comes to broadcasting different genres of music. The way in which they are presented is always in a positive light (most likely to be professional are objective) however the different genres of music are shown in opposing ways to one another. For example the magazine’s cover and feature article of Lily Allen, who’s music is alternate/charts music but she is known as quite a controversial artist; the way in which she was presented through the magazine was in a very rebellious light with quite a destructive and young way about her. However in comparison to a more recent cover with Jennifer Lopez who is a more experienced artist who produces RnB/Latina Pop music, her cover was shown in a very glamorous yet quite simple way. Looking at several other covers and feature articles of the magazine, it’s clear that pop music is presented as very fun (almost quite girly) and enthusiastic whereas alternate music or rock music is presented as extremely edgy and angry.\n\nSome of the key and vital iconography that is associated with the specific type of music that I’m considering for my music magazine (alternate/chart/indie) includes a lot of breakthrough artist(s) and some who are fairly new to the music industry. In a lot of the issues, there are pictures shown from concerts and independent gigs of fairly unknown people from the world of music. One aspect which I believe is key for the genre of music I’m going for is a strong atmosphere of live music and gigs. Due to the fact that I will be using new and young artists just breaking into the music industry, I think that having a sense of involvement and live entertainment is vital. This will make the readers feel more connected and they will feel able to relate with what they are speaking and singing about. Having influential artists is also a really key aspect which I’m taking from Billboard and am planning to use for my own music magazine, because a proportion of my target audience is young having good people featured is important. They can be influenced very easily and so it’s important to include potential role models and people that do good in the world. One thing that Billboard magazine do well is include their own top 100 and top 200 charts in every issue. This aspect of their magazine in particular has been promoted through their magazine and this charts alone are known to belong to Billboard only.\n\nInstitution:\n\nBillboard magazine has been published by John J Kilcullen since 2003 and the magazine is owned by Prometheus Global; the magazine is published every week without fail ever since 1894. Billboard publications has also acquired The Hollywood Reporter, Kirkus Reviews, Adweek and Mediaweek. One thing that sets Billboard magazine apart from the rest is that it has the honor of giving the Billboard Music Award and has The Billboard Music Awards show has been held annually in December up until 2007 and then returned in May 2011.\n\nSome of the ways that Billboard music magazine makes money is through it’s price that the actual magazine is sold for, Billboard Music Awards and the official 100 and 200 Billboard charts – this is the main and biggest way that the magazine makes its profit. As well as this, all over the magazine there are various pages in every issue which are nothing to do with the magazine itself but advertisement. For every page or section of advertisement that Billboard contain in their magazine; they receive money. Due to the fact that this is a consistent part of the magazine, this is a vital way Billboard make constant profit as there will always be adverts in every one of the issues. The magazine does offer subscription deals which offer the audience savings when buying the magazine every week, this is aimed to maintain it’s more loyal audience and consistent readers who would actually benefit from getting the subscription package rather than one off customers or infrequent buyers. Another way the magazine helps to retain its audience is by frequently publishing and posting on all of its social media sites (including Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook) this way it’s also reaching less frequent and younger viewers. On top of this Billboard magazine has it’s own website; http://www.billboard.com/biz/magazine which has been running for a long time and posts features from the magazine, video clips, interviews, charts music, background information of the magazine and its employers, up to date stories on celebrities and ways to contact the magazine itself."
