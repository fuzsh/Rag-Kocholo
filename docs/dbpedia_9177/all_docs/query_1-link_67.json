        "text": "Both private and public institutions are featured on this year's list. And while many of the chosen schools are based in major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Los Angeles and Nashville, Billboard highlights BW's location near Cleveland's thriving music scene as a big plus.\n\n\"Our inclusion on this list reflects both the strength of BW and Cleveland's larger music economy, which continues to support the success of our program by keeping us plugged into fast-changing and emerging trends,\" notes Dr. Sean Murphy, music industry area coordinator and assistant professor of arts management and entrepreneurship at BW.\n\nLeveraging pros and partnerships\n\nThe magazine takes note of courses taught by local music industry pros, including recently added classes on music industry trends, taught by Mike Shea, founder of Alternative Press magazine, and music festival production, taught by the founder of Lambda Productions and producer for Bonnaroo, Governor's Ball and Outside Lands music festivals.\n\nIn addition to program partnerships with Cleveland's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Tragic Hero Records and indie music venues like Beachland Ballroom & Tavern, BW is an educational affiliate of the national Grammy Museum.\n\nAssociate's to bachelor's degree bridge\n\nA brand new \"two plus two\" degree partnership with Cuyahoga Community College (Tri-C), started this fall, streamlines bachelor's degree completion for Tri-C recording arts and technology graduates who transfer to BW.\n\nThe latest \"A2B\" agreement maximizes transfer credits, guaranteeing junior status at BW when a student first earns Tri-C's Associate of Applied Arts (AAS) degree. Students gain technical recording knowledge at Tri-C and then add entrepreneurial, administrative and legal principles for success in the entertainment industry.\n\nApplied learning experiences\n\nWith great internships and applied learning projects that build hands-on experience, students who major in either music industry or arts management and entrepreneurship may aspire to a whole range of music and arts careers, including artist, venue and tour management, digital music marketing and distribution, and independent entrepreneurship, just to name a few.\n\nBW music business in the news\n\nSee coverage of the program's recognition:\n\nOn cleveland.com: Baldwin Wallace named one of the top music business schools in the world"
