        "text": "Everyone,\n\nToday I received in the mail an offer to subscribe to Billboard Magazine at a yearly rate of $199. The offer is for 51 issues, complete web access with archives, etc.\n\nI've been tempted over the years, so i would appreciate any feedback.\n\nI used to get it when I worked in radio 30 years ago. Then the mag lost favor to publications like Radio & Records.\n\nThen when ICE magazine folded last year, I got a few issues of Billboard to pay off my subscription to ICE. I didn't see much worthwhile to continue it, and the price is exorbitantly high.\n\nI'm not sure what you are looking for in Billboard, but there was not much of interest there for me. YMMV.\n\nDid they send you a complimentary copy of the magazine? At that price I'd like to see what an issue looked like.\n\nIt was nice to peruse Billboard at Tower (now defunct), but unless you want to know what's going on in the business part of the industry or are trying to keep tabs on new releases entering the charts, I don't think it's worth it anymore, too. The Hot 100 pop chart does not command the respect it once had.\n\nI'm a fan of the magazine, but for me its not worth the cost. When I worked at a record store years ago, I read it religiously. I would be interested in the archive access, but without knowing what that would include, I would pass.\n\nDave"
