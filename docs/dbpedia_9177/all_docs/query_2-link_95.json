I would like to have the color of the bar be consistent for each item across all of the charts.\n\nHere is an example of the data:\n\nItems Data1 Data2 Data3 Data4 Dogs 5 50 18 27 Cats 9 33 26 30 Hamsters 5 22 8 43\n\nChart 1 shows the Data1 values for Dogs, Cats, and Hamsters, Chart 2 shows the Data2 values for Dogs, Cats, and Hamsters, etc.\n\nI would like to have the bar for Dogs always be green, the bar for Cats always be blue, and the bar for Hamsters to always be yellow across all charts. Is this possible?\n\nLooking at the billboard.js API I see I can set the color of the data, however this sets a particular data field's color to be the same across all items so that on a chart showing only Data1 every bar is the same color.\n\nOther charting libraries I have looked at (highcharts, c3, google) seem to be similarly constrained. Is there another way of approaching this or something I am overlooking?"
