        "text": "One of the biggest jobs in music journalism sat vacant for two and a half years. Now Billboard magazine has finally found its new top editor: Hannah Karp, a former reporter at The Wall Street Journal who joined Billboard as its news director last year.\n\nMs. Karp, 38, will assume the role of editorial director in the wake of a troubled time at the publication, which was started in 1894 to cover the outdoor advertising industry.\n\nIn July, John Amato resigned as the chief executive of the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group during an internal review initiated by its parent company, Valence Media. The inquiry was spurred by a report in The Daily Beast that said Mr. Amato had interfered with decisions regarding articles about Charlie Walk, a prominent record executive and longtime friend who had been accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nMr. Walk, who denied the allegations against him at the time they were made, was subsequently fired by his label, the Republic Group.\n\nIn interviews with The New York Times after Mr. Amato’s resignation, five current or former Billboard employees described an environment in which corporate meddling in editorial decisions was not limited to the coverage of Mr. Walk.\n\nNow Ms. Karp has a chance to set things right at the leading trade music publication.\n\n“As a journalist, I’m really excited to lead a really amazing team of people and expand and deepen our coverage of the music business itself, which is going through such an exciting and fascinating transformation,” Ms. Karp said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
