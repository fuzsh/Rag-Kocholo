Learn more about the Rivet billboard design.\n\nBe sure to include alternative text for your image. Alt text is a description of what's in the photo, not a caption, and is required for accessibility purposes. See the WebAIM website for more information on writing alt text for images.\n\nI want my link to open in a new window/tab\n\nIt's easy: Just select the \"Open the link in new window/tab?\" checkbox and submit the page."
