The magazine selected its top music business schools based on the criteria of industry recommendations, alumni information and details requested from each school. OSU was listed alongside 41 other accredited schools, including Abbey Road Institute, California Institute of the Arts and New York University.\n\n“It is truly incredible that Oklahoma State University was named a top music business school for the second year in a row,” said Scott Hendricks, an OSU alumnus and executive vice president of A&R at Warner Music-Nashville. “The music business couldn’t exist without the infusion of bright minds coming from programs like this.\"\n\nOSU’s Bachelor of Science in the music industry is fairly new, but students already have access to unique opportunities and learning experiences in the program. Students gain music industry experience through Poke U, a student-run music company that provides connections for students to professionals in the industry.\n\n“In my opinion, there isn’t just one thing that makes us stand out, it is a collection of happenings,” said Dr. Mark Perry, who serves as director of the program. “For example, the New York Philharmonic residency, the rock band residency with Other Lives, songwriting classes with Nashville-based songwriter Zac Maloy, the Dick and Malinda Berry Fischer recording studio and successful career placement of our graduates.”\n\nThe GSM continuously works on making improvements to its program for current and prospective students, Perry explained. The recognition from Billboard magazine will help them continue this mission by spreading the word about the program’s achievements.\n\nFind out more about the GSM’s music industry program here, and read the latest issue of Billboard here."
