        "text": "Billboard was founded in 1894 and was first published in Cincinnati, OH. It was published by William Donaldson and James Hennegan. At first, it covered the advertising and bill posting industry and was called Billboard Advertising. Around this time, billboards, posters and paper advertisements placed in public spaces were the main means of advertising. This is how it got its name from billboard advertisements for live entertainments like carnivals and fairs. The first issues were only about eight pages long.\n\nIts editorial changed focus as technology in recording and playback developed. It covered “marvels of modern technology” like the phonograph, record players and wireless radios. It also began covering coin-operated entertainment machines in 1899 and created a dedicated section for them called “Amusement Machines” in March 1932. It began covering the motion picture industry in 1907, but ended up focusing on music due to competition from Variety. It created a Billboard radio broadcasting station in the 1920s.\n\nBillboard started publishing musical charts in the 1930s and launched its “Hot 100” in 1958. By the 1960s Billboard was covering music exclusively. Since 1966, the familiar masthead identity has featured lettering with strong circular forms that suggested records (and later CDs) and kicky “mod” colors. As part of the redesign the logo has been redrawn in order to emphasize the basic geometry of the name, creating a typeface that echoes the circles of the original and still looks “pop.” . Michael Bierut from Pentagram and his team helped with the redesign if Billboard. He and his team worked closely on the redesign under the direction of Billboard creative director Andrew Horton, editorial director Bill Werde, and editor Joe Levy.\n\nThe designer has set the name in all lowercase letters, tightened the spacing and removed the colors from the select. Changing these few things instantly made the magazine look more grown-up and serious. It also became easier to design will full bleed color photographs. It will continue to use the color version of the logo on its website along with retail uses and event marketing.\n\nInside of the magazine varied designs catch the vibrancy of the music business. The section have been reorganized and restructured. There is also new departments introduced and some that have been renamed. One example is the table of contents page is now called viewpoint and it features the best quotes from the week’s stories.\n\nThere is a new section in the front of the magazine title “Topline” it highlights industry news. The headers are paired with graphic bars inspired by the charts. The page layouts are now opened up with graphs, pull quotes and other data appearing in the margins. The new design includes a carefully coordinated suite of typefaces, including LL Brown, Lyon Display and Atlas Grotesk for the headers, and Lyon Text for the body copy. Ziggurat is used for special features and advertorials.\n\nOne major part of the redesign was making the charts easier to understand. The charts now appear at a larger scale and across more pages. The Hot 100, which is the top 100 singles, has expanded from one page to a full spread. The Billboard 200, which is the top 200 albums, went from two to four pages. The magazine’s different charts appeared in different colors: hot pink for the Hot 100; gray for Digital Songs; green for Country, and so on. These have been returned to high-impact black and white of the original Billboard charts, with more open spacing that makes them easier to read. In the Hot 100 and Billboard 200, analysis and background on specific hits and artists now appears within the chart.\n\nNow the positions on the charts are easier to scan. They were formerly organized so “This Week” appeared first, followed by its ranking in previous weeks. The redesign moves the earlier rankings to the left, in lighter shades of grey, leading up to “This Week” in black, so readers can easily follow the record’s progression on the chart. The “bullets” indicating rising hits are knocked out in white around the chart numbers, and weekly awards like “Greatest Gainer” and “Sales Gainer” are marked by red banner icons. The record’s peak position and weeks on the chart appear to the right of the title. The chart data is set in Amplitude, changed from the longstanding Univers, and chart names appear in LL Brown. The design for the features have similar aspects to those of the departments. The old design seems to be a bit cluttered and hard to read. With the redesign the layout looks nice and clean. The main change in the features is the readability. With the layouts being spread out this makes the article a lot easier to be read.\n\nIn my opinion the redesign of Billboard is successful. The reason being is because the redesign implemented improvement for the better. The redesign did not take away anything major away from the Billboard name itself. The redesign was put in place so that readers could view and understand aspects of the magazine clearly. The strongest element in the redesign of the departments, mainly the charts, would have to be the spacing and the return of using just black and white. The use of too many color could have easily confused readers or they simply could have thought the colors were too much for something so simple. The strongest element of the redesigned features would be how open the pages have become. This is important because if readers feel like the words or even graphics on the page are too close they will not even bother with reading it. Spacing in spreads is extremely important when designing them. You must consider the age of the target audience and what their vision might be like. For me personally I prefer to read articles that have excellent spacing. Being that I wear glasses fonts that are too small and too close can be hard for me to read.\n\nThe most subtle change that I think had the greatest impact is the change of the logo on the magazine. As stated in Pentagram the changes in spacing, color and size I can agree that these changes do in fact make the print version appear to be more grown up. At first I wanted to disagree with this statement but then I thought about it. Billboard is not like any other magazine. Its target audience includes record label executives, artists, music retailers and DJs, but it is also sold to consumers, and is popular with music fans who obsess over the data of their favorite artists. This magazine focuses on trending music and the hottest artists. This is why it makes sense to simplify the design just a little bit. Other magazines has various topics and want to get readers interested. They do this by using words or phrases that will make a reader stop and considering buying or at least look through the magazine. With music it is either you are interested or you are not. Fancy album covers or flashy color will not make you like the music that an artist puts out or make you read a feature about them. So in this case simple out weights flashy.\n\nSources include http://www.pentagram.com/#/blog/47055 and http://www.spd.org/2013/01/billboard-redesign.php#more"
