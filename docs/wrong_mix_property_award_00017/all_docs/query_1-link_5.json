RAMAN UNIVERSITY , KOTA, BILASPUR (C.G.) # Superconductivity is a phenomena, in which the electrical resistance of certain materials completely vanishes at low temperatures. It is one of the most interesting and sophisticated topic of condensed matter physics.\n\n3. # It was first discovered by the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who was the first to liquefy helium at 4.2 Kelvin temperature # In 1911 Kamerlingh Onnes and his assistant discovered the phenomenon of superconductivity while studying the resistance of metals at low temperatures. Discovery of Superconductor DR. C. V. RAMAN UNIVERSITY , KOTA, BILASPUR (C.G.)\n\n4. Continue…… DR. C. V. RAMAN UNIVERSITY , KOTA, BILASPUR (C.G.)\n\n5. Effect of Temperature DR. C. V. RAMAN UNIVERSITY , KOTA, BILASPUR (C.G.) # In superconducting materials, the characteristics of superconductivity appear when the temperature T is lowered below a critical temperature Tc. # The value of this critical temperature varies from material to material. # Conventional superconductors usually have critical temperatures ranging from around 20 K to less than 1 K\n\n6. Continue……. DR. C. V. RAMAN UNIVERSITY , KOTA, BILASPUR (C.G.)\n\n7. Superconducting Elements DR. C. V. RAMAN UNIVERSITY , KOTA, BILASPUR (C.G.)\n\n8. Effect of Magnetic Field on Superconductor DR. C. V. RAMAN UNIVERSITY , KOTA, BILASPUR (C.G.)\n\n9. # Maglev (magnetic levitation) trains. # Large hadrons collider or particle accelerator.. # E-bombs. # SQUIDs (Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices) are used to detect even the weakest magnetic field. # Making electricity generation more efficient . # Very fast computing. Applications DR. C. V. RAMAN UNIVERSITY , KOTA, BILASPUR (C.G.)"
