        "text": "<strong>New</strong> <strong>York</strong> <strong>State</strong> <strong>Leaders</strong> <strong>In</strong> <strong>Superconductivity</strong>... The 2nd <strong>New</strong> <strong>York</strong> <strong>State</strong> Superconductor Technology Summit is pleased to name the following individuals as “<strong>New</strong> <strong>York</strong> <strong>State</strong> <strong>Leaders</strong> in <strong>Superconductivity</strong>” during the Centennial Celebration of the technology. Each of these individuals was nominated from among the superconductivity community in <strong>New</strong> <strong>York</strong> <strong>State</strong> as “leaders who have made important contributions to the research, development and commercialization of superconductivity in <strong>New</strong> <strong>York</strong> <strong>State</strong> over the past century.” 1. Kathleen Amm (GE Global Research, Niskayuna) ~ Dr. Kathleen Amm is Technology Leader for MRI Technologies and Systems at GE Global Research where she works with her team to deliver innovative MR and superconducting technologies to GE businesses. Her primary research areas of interest include: MRI and medical applications of superconductivity, superconducting electric machines, high temperature superconductivity, material properties at low temperatures, and permanent magnets. Dr. Amm is active member of the superconductivity and cryogenics communities serving on Boards of Applied <strong>Superconductivity</strong> and Cryogenic Engineering conferences, committee member at the Magnet Technology conference, member of Editorial Board for Superconducting Science and Technology. Dr. Amm contributes significant effort to attract new talents to <strong>Superconductivity</strong> and its applications. 2. Ivan Bozovic (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton) ~ BNL physicist Ivan Bozovic is a leader in the field of epitaxy and nano-engineering of complex oxides, and is also renowned for his optical and Raman spectroscopy results. His research accomplishments include the construction of an unparalleled next-generation molecular beam epitaxy oxide system, integrated with a 16 channel atomic absorption spectroscopy system for accurate real-time monitoring of atomic fluxes, as well as a lowenergy electron microscope and a time-of-flight ion scattering and recoil spectroscopy system for in-situ, real-time, atomic-level monitoring of the film surface. Leveraging on this breakthrough in the apparatus, he has developed a technology to deposit atomically smooth films and multilayers of complex oxides. For his accomplishments, Dr. Bozovic was elected a Fellow of both SPIE and the American Physical Society, and has won a SPIE Technology Achievement Award, the highest Yugoslav national award in physics, the M. Jaric Memorial Prize, Polaroid <strong>In</strong>ternational Prize, and several other awards. Currently, Bozovic is the group leader for the Oxide Molecular Beam Epitaxy Group in the Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science Department. His seminal research continues to address some key open questions in high temperature superconductor (HTS) physics. 3. J. C. Seamus Davis (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton) ~ BNL physicist and Head of the Spectroscopy Imaging Group in the Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science Department, J. C. Seamus Davis, built a scanning tunneling microscope that can resolve details smaller than the diameter of an atom, which he uses to study the movement of electrons in superconducting materials. His insights on how the behavior of electrons in HTS affects the transition temperature - the temperature at which a material loses its electrical resistance - may lead to the discovery of new superconducting materials that are suitable for applications such as zero-loss energy generation and transmission systems. Davis is also the Director of the BNL-led Center for Emergent <strong>Superconductivity</strong>, one of the DOE Energy Frontier Research Centers, which is focusing on the underlying nature of superconductivity in complex materials. Along with John Tranquada and Aharon Kapitulnik of Stanford University, Davis was a recipient of the 2009 Heike Kamerlingh Onnes Prize for outstanding superconductivity experiments. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2010 and is the recipient of several other major awards. 4. Ivar Giaever (GE, Schenectady and Rensselaer Polytechnic <strong>In</strong>stitute, Troy) ~ Giaever earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the Norwegian <strong>In</strong>stitute of Technology in 1952. <strong>In</strong> 1954 he emigrated from Norway to Canada, where he was employed by the Canadian division of General Electric. <strong>In</strong> 1958 he joined GE’s Research and Development Center in Schenectady, NY. He has lived in Niskayuna, NY since then, taking up US citizenship in 1964, the same year he earned a Ph.D. in Physics from the Rensselaer Polytechnic <strong>In</strong>stitute (RPI). Giaever shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 with Leo Esaki and Brian Josephson for their discoveries regarding tunnelling phenomena in solids. Giaever’s share of the prize was specifically for his “experimental discoveries regarding tunnelling phenomena in superconductors.” Giaever is an institute professor emeritus at RPI, a professor-at- Iarge at the University of Oslo, and the president of Applied Biophysics. ~ 31 ~"
