The following is a list of amazing materials you might not know existed along with some of their uses. Some man-made and others naturally occurring, some of these materials have been in production and use for a very long time while others have only recently been discovered. Alphabetical in order, this list is not yet complete and isn’t meant to be a complete description of these materials, but it is the most comprehensive list I’ve found to date even if I have made a few mistakes."
