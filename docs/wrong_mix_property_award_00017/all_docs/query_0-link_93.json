        "text": "We report here that magnetic fields of almost 34 T, far above the upper 24 T limit of Nb3Sn, can be generated using a multifilament round wire conductor made of the high temperature cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-x (Bi-2212). A remarkable attribute of this Bi-2212 conductor is that it does not exhibit macroscopic texture and contains many high angle grain boundaries but nevertheless attains very high superconducting critical current densities Jc of 2500 A/mm2 at 20 T and 4.2 K. This Bi-2212 conductor does not possess the extreme texture that high Jc coated conductors of REBa2Cu3O7-x (REBCO) require, avoiding also its high aspect ratio, large superconducting anisotropy and the inherent sensitivity to defects of a single filament conductor. Bi-2212 wires can be wound or cabled into almost any type of superconducting magnet and will be especially valuable for very high field NMR magnets beyond the present 1 GHz proton resonance limit of Nb3Sn technology. This demonstration that g...\n\nDownload\n\nNature, 2001\n\nLarge-scale superconducting electric devices for power industry depend critically on wires with high critical current densities at temperatures where cryogenic losses are tolerable. This restricts choice to two high-temperature cuprate superconductors, (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3Ox and YBa2Cu3Ox, and possibly to MgB2, recently discovered to superconduct at 39 K. Crystal structure and material anisotropy place fundamental restrictions on their properties, especially in polycrystalline form. So far, power applications have followed a largely empirical, twin-track approach of conductor development and construction of prototype devices. The feasibility of superconducting power cables, magnetic energy-storage devices, transformers, fault current limiters and motors, largely using (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3Ox conductor, is proven. Widespread applications now depend significantly on cost-effective resolution of fundamental materials and fabrication issues, which control the production of low-cost, high-perfo...\n\nDownload"
