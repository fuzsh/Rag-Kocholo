Superconductivity was first observed in mercury in 1911 by physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes of Leiden University. The next great milestone in understanding how matter behaves at extreme cold temperatures occurred in 1933. German researchers Walter Meissner and Robert Ochsenfeld discovered that a superconducting material will repel a magnetic field.",
