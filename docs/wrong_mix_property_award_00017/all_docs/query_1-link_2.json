        "text": "When Stephanie Cohn Rupp moved from London to Washington to fulfill her dream of working in international economic development, the London School of Economics graduate quickly became disillusioned.\n\nWorking in microfinance at the turn of the century, Rupp experienced first-hand the adverse effects of large financial institutions on the world, including a noticeable uptick in predatory lending to those in poverty. What she witnessed led to a decades-long career in ESG investing to fill the social responsibility gap often left in the wake of public sector failures and private sector indifference.\n\n“I realized there had to be another way,” she said.\n\nRupp’s realization led to a shift in her career. She started working for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which at the time had launched an initiative to empower women in business across the globe. The job took her to central Asia, where she supported women entrepreneurs in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other parts of the region.\n\n“The concept of dealing with women, not as poor beneficiaries of aid, but as businesswomen who were building up their hairdresser shop, had a really high impact,” Rupp said.\n\nA dual citizen of France and the United States, Rupp left USAID to work for fellow countryman and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Omidyar is well-known in business circles for his extensive participation in impact investing, which allowed Rupp to deploy millions of dollars toward socially responsible causes.\n\n“I was very attracted to his firm because I thought we were aligned in our thinking that business had a place to change and attack issues of poverty and public sector failures. And that’s all he did,” she said. “The billionaire can afford to say, ‘Let’s try a few million dollars there, and if it fails, it’s not a big deal and we will just keep going,’” she said.\n\nHer experience working for Omidyar helped solidify Rupp’s position in impact investing. Years later, in 2013, she was named CEO of Toniic, a global network of impact investors.\n\nEducating investors on having an impact\n\nToniic leveraged its relationships with foundations and individuals interested in impact investing to help clients decide where to direct capital. The business helped eliminate a problem many impact investors faced when attempting to solicit advice from traditional banks on making sustainable investments.\n\n“This learning group really grew a lot when I was there,” Rupp said. “There was so much excitement around asset owners, and the wealth management business was well behind. … The asset owners knew what was possible, and if they asked Goldman Sachs or Citi or UBS and so on, ‘I have $25 million invested with you, what can I do to fight climate change?’ the typical wealth management firm would say that’s not an investment question, it’s a philanthropic question.”\n\nRupp traveled the world participating in information sharing on how to be ahead of the curve of traditional financial services, but wanted to become further involved with directing money toward sustainable finance.\n\nFor years, Rupp envisioned working for Veris Wealth Partners, which she said is known for refusing to compromise on sustainable investing while still aiming to return profits in step with the S&P 500.\n\nRupp had always been bothered by seeing companies that may have ESG investing divisions while still allocating a large portion of money to industries like oil and gas. Veris never made such concessions.\n\nThe only problem was landing the job.\n\n“I had wanted to work for them for maybe 12 or 14 years,” she said. “I always tried — I knocked on their door a few times — and there was no job.”\n\nAt least not until Aug. 2, 2019, when Rupp was named CEO and partner of the Denver-based wealth management firm.\n\n“The firm has always been women-led, which is rare in wealth management,” Rupp said, adding that the operation also focuses heavily on racial justice investing and policy advocacy.\n\nRupp draws on her master’s degree in public administration, finance, trade and macroeconomics from Harvard Kennedy School to advocate for shareholders with policymakers in Washington. Veris also works to connect its clients with their own representatives and senators to help promote their own voices.\n\n‘A house divided cannot stand’\n\nUnder Rupp, Veris has spent years on Capitol Hill combating the shortsighted viewpoint that ESG investing is in some way anticapitalist or inherently evil.\n\n“It’s so mind-boggling,” Rupp said, adding that her group has met with elected leaders on both sides of the aisle to educate legislators on sustainable finance’s benefits and effectiveness.\n\nShe said the Democratic side embraces many of the tenants championed by Veris and even created the Sustainable Investment Caucus under U.S. Reps. Sean Casten, of Illinois, and Juan Vargas, of California, 18 months ago.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Rupp said Republican lawmakers often understand intellectually what sustainable finance is about, but it’s hard for them to implement when considering, for example, the possibility of oil and gas workers losing jobs in states like Texas or Oklahoma.\n\nTexas has banned municipalities and other public entities from ESG investing, which Rupp said has only increased taxpayer costs.\n\n“What they’ve done is create less competition,” she said. “You have smaller firms and fewer firms bidding, so the price of management of these public assets goes up, and the taxpayers are left with a much higher debt service.”\n\nRupp said she is continuing to approach the issue through the lens of creating unity, which goes directly to her favorite quote, often attributed to Abraham Lincoln during the upheaval leading into the Civil War, but also attributed by some to Jesus.\n\n“A house divided cannot stand.”\n\nLooking to the future\n\nRupp sees a bright future for investment firms like Veris as the younger generation increasingly accepts and gravitates toward sustainable life choices, including investment decisions. She also sees a world where Veris will remain independent for many years to come.\n\n“What I’m most proud of is that we have had many offers to be acquired — businesses saying that we’re the experts on sustainable finance and gender lens investing — and every time we’ve had a golden offer on the table, we have declined it.”\n\nWhy? Because the deals typically involve Veris becoming a division of another wealth management firm, which would go against the company’s mission of remaining 100% committed to ESG.\n\n“We’re very proud of our independence,” she said.\n\nVeris continually seeks new prospects, including interns, to join the firm.\n\n“We love having interns, and often we recruit our interns later as advisers or investment professionals — that’s a big way that younger folks can get involved in what we’re doing.”\n\nFor the older generations, Rupp said Veris has a $5 million minimum to invest and stressed that the operations of the firm are hardly philanthropic.\n\n“We’re trying to show that in the long term, investing in this way is the smarter way to invest. Diverse teams outperform.”\n\nRead more: Women of Impact: Kelly Ann Winget on her alternative investment fund and gender bias\n\nGreen bond sales in the first half of 2024 topped $356 billion, the biggest half year for sales on record, research from Bloomberg released this week shows. The financial media company said the mark was achieved despite a decline in second quarter sales to $165 billion from $191 billion in the first quarter of the year.\n\nWhile green bond issuance makes up the largest percentage of the total impact fixed-income universe, Bloomberg also tracks the sales of social bonds, sustainability bonds and sustainability-linked bonds. The total of all those sales fell just short of $600 billion in the first half of 2024, even with 2023’s figure and just below 2022’s high of just over $600 billion.\n\nThe first quarter of the year had seen a record $328 million issuance in all four types of impact bonds.\n\nJonathan Gardiner, sustainable indices product manager at Bloomberg, said in an article on the company’s professional services website that the numbers were boosted by government bond issues, as well as transition bonds in Japan.\n\nBloomberg data showed the largest green bond sale in the first 6 months of the year was from the Italian government, in May, which totaled more than $9 billion. The Japanese government debuted its green transition bond, with three separate transactions occurring in the first 6 months and totaling over $12 billion. Other government issuers of green bonds included France, Germany, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom — with more than $140 billion in sales from January through June, accounting for the largest sector of green bonds issued.\n\nSocial bond sales hit $82 billion in the first half. The largest social bond of the year to date was issued by La Caisse d’Amortissement de la Dette Sociale), owned by the French government, at €4 billion. Another notable sale: The Icelandic government became the first sovereign borrower to issue a labelled gender bond, focusing on gender equality.\n\nSales of sustainability bonds reached $124 billion in the first half, some 10% higher than the same period last year and only just shy of the previous record set in 2021, at $129 billion. The International Bank of Reconstruction & Development was responsible for the largest sustainability bonds issued in the first 6 months of 2024, at $5 billion.\n\nIssuance of sustainability-linked bonds fell 47% to $22 billion compared to the same period last year. Enel, the Italian utility, was responsible for the largest sustainability-linked bond of the year to date, at $1.25 billion, issued in June. Enel issued foour sustainability-linked bonds through the half year, totaling approximately $4 billion.\n\nBloomberg’s Global Aggregate Green, Social and Sustainability bond indices are designed to provide investors with an objective measure of the global market for fixed income securities issued to fund projects with direct environmental and/or social benefits. The combined index is down 3.46% for the year to date, but that figure is slightly higher that Bloomberg’s global aggregate bond index, highlighting improved returns for investors with an appetite for sustainability-focused investment, Gardiner wrote.\n\nRead more: Blue bonds help the worlds oceans\n\nAs older Baby Boomers approach 80, the greatest intergenerational transfer of wealth in history is close at hand.\n\nFor years, the conversation has focused on the younger Gen Xers and Millennials and their windfall inheritances, but the generational lens is not the only one worth paying attention to. The industry overlooks the gender lens at its peril: women are expected to gain control of most of that wealth — at least $30 trillion — and much of it by 2030.\n\nKelly Baldoni, head of Global Women’s Strategies at Impax Asset Management, spoke with Sallie Krawcheck, founder and CEO of Ellevest, to discuss how the industry, and specifically advisors, can approach this transfer of wealth with a gender lens — and why it is an essential opportunity to contribute to and participate in a more equitable society.\n\nKelly Baldoni: Sallie, we’ve been hearing about this impending generational wealth transfer for years: it’s finally underway but what is it exactly?\n\nSallie Krawcheck: A few years ago, we were talking about Boomers transferring wealth to their kids. I would add a couple of nuances. While Boomers have indeed accumulated record amounts of wealth which will eventually go to the next generation, there’s a wrinkle: first, it typically goes to the wife. In fact, 75% to 80% of women die single.\n\nAnd then it goes to the next generation of women, since both the sons and daughters inherit. And there’s another nuance: women are making economic strides themselves. More college and postgraduate degrees in the U.S. now go to women than men.\n\nSo, women are inheriting money, but they’re also putting themselves in positions to earn more money relative to men. These factors combine to produce what we’re calling the ‘feminization of wealth’.\n\nAnd you certainly see evidence that women are using their money differently than men; spending it differently, and investing it differently, with a focus on sustainability. Finally, one of the most interesting insights from our recent Ellevest research is that women, through the very act of getting money, become more confident.\n\nKB: It’s clear the role of the advisor will be critical in helping women invest this windfall. Is there a better approach (knowing that women tend to feel underserved by their advisor, if they have one) that more advisors should consider?\n\nSK: I think it’s being a holistic advisor, talking to the whole person, and putting the pieces together. Some of it is putting financial planners on your team and really focusing on planning. It’s fascinating to me that financial advisors tend to be men, but financial planners tend to be women.\n\nNot so long ago, a very successful advisor said to me, “I tried to talk stocks with her, she’s not interested.” And that is exactly the point. She’s not interested in talking stocks. She’s interested in talking about her family and her aspirations. What is important to her? Ask how she wants to use her money.\n\nWhat we found in the research is that women don’t want to build wealth just to build wealth. It’s not, “I need to retire with two million dollars.” It’s values-based conversations, which could drive growth for sustainable managers: “These are the things I have done and want to do, and I want to be able to do it without a stress ball in my stomach.”\n\nIt’s more financial planning oriented. “I want to buy a home. In 10 years, I want to have two kids. I’m OK retiring later, but I want to have a “grandma on a Vespa in Italy” retirement. And while I’m doing these things, I want the earth to be a stronger and better place.”\n\nI think the industry needs to take some warning. If we do it well, we retain the assets and there is increased demand for impact and sustainable investing.\n\nKB: What does a successful transfer look like, specifically for women? Could this close the gender wealth gap?\n\nSK: It will get more money in the hands of women, so I like to say women’s longevity is going to quietly do what the ‘Lean in’ movement didn’t.\n\nBut those that keep it in the bank and don’t invest are not building wealth, so they can slip back, right? You miss a few years of compounding, you miss quite a bit, so it’s important that women put their money to use, by investing to build wealth.\n\nRight now, the industry is not set up to fully benefit. Our research found only one-third of women say they know where to turn when they receive a financial windfall. These are people receiving hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars, so many have a family financial advisor.\n\nIn contrast, many advisors are complacent. Since many of us in the financial services industry have worked in a bull market for much of our careers, I think there are many advisors who think, “My business has been growing. I’ve got a great relationship with him. She seems great. All will be well.”\n\nWhereas she may be saying, “If I get this money, I don’t know where to go,” even with an advisor right in front of her.\n\nIt’s about trusting your advisor. You may chat with a guy on the golf course and have shared experiences. But if she doesn’t want to do that, how do you build that trust? By being hyper alert, paying attention, and talking to the whole family from the beginning (or at least from now on).\n\nRead more: $30 trillion in U.S. wealth will transfer to younger women in the next 10 years\n\nThis interview originally appeared on Impax Asset Management’s website.\n\nUS SIF — the Sustainable Investment Forum is a leading voice advancing sustainable investing across all asset classes. The forum says its mission is to rapidly shift investment practices toward sustainability, focusing on long-term investment and the generation of positive social and environmental impacts.\n\nIts members represent $5 trillion in assets under management or advisement and include investment management and advisory firms, mutual fund companies, ​asset owners, data and research firms, financial planners and advisors, broker-dealers, banks, credit unions, community development financial institutions and nonprofit associations.\n\nEquities.com caught up with influential members of US SIF at the organization’s recent Forum 2024 in Chicago.\n\nAndrew Choi, Portfolio Manager, Parnassus Investments\n\nTell us a little about yourself and your work.\n\nI’m a portfolio manager at Parnassus Investments. I help manage our Core Equity Fund, which is our large cap fund. I also manage our Large Cap Growth Equity Fund.\n\nWhat are you most excited about in coming and attending the US SIF 2024 Forum?\n\nThis is my first time at the conference, and just from meeting a few folks so far, it seems like an incredible group of like-minded investors. It’s great to just hear what everyone’s thinking about. It seems like we’re all thinking about something similar. And then also it’s an interesting period of time where we’ve had increasing attention and scrutiny over ESG investing, and now we’re sort of like brass tacks getting back to work. That feels like it’s a good place to be.\n\nWe understand Parnassus modified its process. Can you tell us about that change and why you made it?\n\nIt was a team decision that was, in many ways, a long time coming, and it’s just a more accurate reflection of how the team works and how we think. We moved from a world of having screens like a restricted list, and I think what that tended to communicate is that we would invest based strictly on rules. And we wanted to communicate that our portfolio managers and analysts were exercising judgment, and we recognize that the world is dynamic, and companies change, and not everything is black and white.\n\nSo now we have a caution list. It’s effectively the restricted list, minus a few areas where the burden of proof and the standards for diligence might just be higher.\n\nYou discussed the increased attention and scrutiny last year, and now that we’re largely past that, do you think that will have any lingering effects on the industry?\n\nI tend to think about anything new in the financial system going through like, a very similar, similar life cycle, right? In this case, it was ESG, sustainable investment products. There’s a rampant uptick in adoption and selling of new products, and we went through a similar thing where we had a huge tailwind behind us. I think 2022 happened both because of the political climate and the energy performance, which put a spotlight on the asset class.\n\nWe view it only as a positive, because, you know, when the tide was rising, everyone sort of looked the same. But once you have scrutiny over your investment process, it starts to expose what’s real and what’s not, and allows us as an industry to get to a more productive area. An area where you have conversations that aren’t politicized and or polarized conversations around the terms that we use, but rather actually figuring out, like, what do we actually do? And how do we actually do it?\n\nWhat are you most excited about looking ahead the next 6-12 months?\n\nWe’re clearly going through a period of change and improvement within the Sustainable Investment Industry. The way people talk about investing, whether it’s ESG considerations, sustainable investing, sustainable business practices, however you want to call it, that’s continuing to evolve and grow. Even internally at Parnassus, we’ve made a lot of improvement in terms of our investment process, something that we work on all the time, but also how we communicate internally, externally to each other about our investment process.\n\nCheck out all the Sustainable Finance Influencers.\n\nKelly Ann Winget emanates power and persuasion. The first millennial, openly LGBTQ+ woman to launch a private equity firm focused on alternative assets, Winget endeavors to break the “old boys club” model that has dominated the world of investing for decades.\n\nWinget has raised nearly $1 billion in private capital for startups, oil and gas, renewable energy, real estate, infrastructure and manufacturing and emerging markets. Her firm, Alternative Wealth Partners, aims to break the mold of private equity.\n\nWinget has been a competitive force in sales since she was 15. She leverages decades of experience and innovation to relate to and empower a diversity of clients.\n\nHer private equity investments fuel companies like lesbian-owned Dapper Boi, a gender-and-body-inclusive online apparel line, as she strives to connect women and LGBTQ+ founders with the resources they need to thrive.\n\nHigh earner at an early age\n\nWinget’s parents drilled into her at an early age that her lifestyle was outside the norm. But it wasn’t because she was gay and the daughter of a multigenerational oil and gas family in the conservative state of Texas. Instead, her parents’ message was that the affluence of Winget’s upbringing was atypical.\n\n“My mother was very adamant about making sure that we understood that our lives weren’t normal. Like this was not everybody’s experience and that the real world is different,” she says.\n\nWinget points to that early lesson, and her parents being entrepreneurs and investors as the inspiration for her pursuits in accessible investment. “We talked about [money] constantly,” she said.\n\nDespite the family’s wealth, Winget went to work at a car wash at age 15 to earn the money to buy a $300 pair of jeans. It was the launch of her career. “I learned how to make a lot of money very young,” she said. Soon Winget was raking in $60,000 a year selling car-wash packages. Her earnings were so high that her employer had to modify the commission program three times.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Winget went to college. But she struggled to find meaning in her coursework when she found she could score 100 percent on tests without needing to attend class. She realized: “I’m actively losing money being in school. So I just went to work.”\n\nPivoting to investor education\n\nOver the next decade, Winget launched head first into exploring new industries, from health care to construction. But she was ready to pivot and raise capital.\n\n“I wanted to focus more on the investor education side. How do investors find opportunities in alternative spaces? I had worked on everything from oil and gas to cannabis deals to medical devices and tech startups. And the one thing that I learned from talking to the other investors is that there is a lot of interest, but they don’t know how to do due diligence,” Winget said.\n\nWinget worked for a family office in oil and gas looking to change focus and bring in new investors. But when she realized she was the smartest person in the room – “which was really terrifying because they were managing a lot of money,” she added – Winget decided it was time to branch out on her own.\n\nAt 30 years old, she launched Alternative Wealth Partners. It was August 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic was raging. But the firm had a clear goal: Make private equity understandable and accessible to Main Street investors.\n\nThat same summer, Winget met her now-wife. She said in the past she was never open about being gay, dodging comments over client dinners like: “You should meet my son.” But that all changed in her relationship with Sarah Matteson, a social worker and mom of two kids. “Because I’m so confident in my relationship now, I talk about it more openly,” she explained.\n\nBeing an openly LGBTQ+ woman in the world of investment can be a challenge. But Winget said her being a young woman professional has always been the greatest hurdle to overcome, not her sexual orientation.\n\n“I have to sometimes remind people, especially men, I’m like: ‘Think about when you were 35 and where you were in your career. You were probably reaching the peak of it … that is me. That you just can’t see yourself in me doesn’t mean I don’t have the same experience that you have. I started at 15,’” Winget said.\n\nWhere did her confidence come from at such an early age? Winget credits her entrepreneurial parents. She said they encouraged her to try new things and provided strong emotional support.\n\n“We were allowed to fail in a way that wasn’t devastating. When bad things happened, it was like, you just pivot. You don’t give up.”\n\nPursuing purpose before returns\n\nWinget founded Alternative Wealth Partner with a vision of creating the family office experience for retail investors who don’t have full-time investment staff. She describes the firm as “industry agnostic” and driven by results that are a win-win for the firm and its clients. “The fact that I take greed out of it helps,” Winget said.\n\n“It’s really about following what’s going on at a global scale and finding the different opportunities that are being overlooked,” she added.\n\nSome of the firm’s early investments were based on an awareness of the lack of infrastructure to support innovative technology like artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. You need adequate data storage to support AI, and sustainable energy to power EVs, Winget explained.\n\nWhen it comes to balancing positive social impact with a return on investment, Winget is confident that the two go hand in hand. “I think that if you are doing things with the right purpose and intention that the returns come with it. I don’t think you have to forfeit one for the other,” she said.\n\nRead more: Women of Impact: Santia Deck and a revolution in impact investing"
