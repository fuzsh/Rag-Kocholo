As such, the tools are broadly applicable to application areas, including chemicals and biofuels, materials, medicine and agriculture. A characteristic of the field is to look holistically at cellular design, from sensing and genetic circuitry to the manipulation of cellular processes and actuators, to controlling metabolism, to programming multicellular behaviors. Further, the types of cells that are manipulated are broad, from in vitro systems to microbes and fungi to mammalian and plant cells and living animals. Many of the projects in synthetic biology seek tomoreÂ Â» move biochemical functions across organisms. The field is highly interdisciplinary with faculty and students spread across departments that focus on engineering (biological, chemical, electrical, mechanical, civil, computer science) and basic science (biology and systems biology, chemistry, physics). While there have been many one-off workshops and meeting on synthetic biology, the 2014 Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution and Design (SEED) was the first of an annual conference series that serves as a reliable place to pull together the involved disciplines in order to organize and exchange advances in the science and technology in the field. Further, the SEED conferences have a strong focus on industry, with many companies represented and actively participating. A number of these companies have started major efforts in synthetic biology including large companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, Dow, Dupont, BP, Total), smaller companies have recently gone public (e.g., Amyris, Gevo, Intrexon), and many start-ups (e.g., Teslagen, Refactored Materials, Pivot, Genomatica). There are a number of loosely affiliated Synthetic Biology Centers, including ones at MIT, Boston University, UCSD, UCSF, UC-Berkeley, Imperial College, Oxford, and ETH. SEED 2015 will serve as the primary meeting at which\n\nComparison of cross culture engineering ethics training using the simulator for engineering ethics education.\n\nPubMed\n\nChung, Christopher\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThis paper describes the use and analysis of the Simulator for Engineering Ethics Education (SEEE) to perform cross culture engineering ethics training and analysis.

The ScieTech 2015 conference is aimed to bring together researchers, engineers and scientists from around the world. ScieTech 2015 is placed on promoting interaction between the theoretical, experimental, and applied communities, so that a high level exchange is achieved in new and emerging areas within mathematics, chemistry and physics. As we already know that science and technology have brought tremendous benefits for human civilization. People are becoming healthier, wealthier, better educated, more peaceful, increasingly connected, and living longer. Of course, science and technology provide many answers to global challenges, but we will face more complex problems in the next decade due to increasing world population, limitation of energy, and climate change. Therefore, researchers should be more active in conducting research that enables collaboration between one and the others. Interdisciplinary cooperation is absolutely necessary in order to create a smart system for solving the global problems. We need a global and general long-term view of the future with long-range goals for solving complex problems in next decade. Therefore the conference was held to be a forum for researchers from different disciplines to start collaborating and conducting research that provides a solution to the global issues. The theme of ScieTech 2015 was ''The interdisciplinary Application between Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics to enhance the Quality of Life''. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all in the Technical Program Committee who have reviewed the papers and developed a very interesting conference program as well as the invited and plenary speakers.

The focus of the conference was `real-life' devices and systems that have recently emerged as a result of various nanotechnology initiatives in chemistry and chemical engineering, physics, electrical engineering, materials science and engineering, biomedical engineering, computer science, robotics, and environmental science. The conference had a single session all-invited speaker format, with the presenters making the `Who's Who in Nanotechnology' list. Contributed work was showcased at a special poster session. The conference, sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the US Air Force, and endorsed by Materials Research Society (MRS), drew more than 160 participants from fourteen countries. To strengthen the connection between fundamental research and `real-life' applications, the conference featured a large number of presenters from both academia and industry. Among the participating companies were NEC, IBM, Toshiba, AMD, Samsung, Seagate, and Veeco. Nanotechnology has triggered a new wave of research collaborations between researchers from academia and industry with a broad range of specializations. Such a global approach has resulted in a number of breakthrough accomplishments. One of the main goals of this conference was to identify these accomplishments and put the novel technology initiatives and the emerging research teams on the map. Among the key nanotechnology applications demonstrated at NDSI-2004 were carbon-nanotube-based transistors, quantum computing systems, nanophotonic devices, single-molecule electronic devices and biological magnetic sources. Due to the unprecedented success of the conference, the organizing committee of NDSI has unanimously chosen to turn NDSI into an annual international nanotechnology event. The next NDSI is scheduled for 4-6 April, 2005, in Houston, Texas\n\nGE STEM Teacher's Conference\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-07-13\n\nTeachers prepare to demonstrate the projects they built for the Rocketry Engineering Design Challenge during the 2017 GE Foundation High School STEM Integration Conference at the Center for Space Education at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.

There are different types of conferences which require different types of control. Some of the features of conference control may be user invoked while others are for internal management of a conference. In recent years, ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) have standardized two main models of conferencing, each system providing a set of conference control functionalities that are not easily provided in the other one. This paper analyzes the main activities appropriate for different types of conferences and presents an architecture for conference control called GCCP (Generic Conference Control Protocol). GCCP interworks different types of conferencing and provides a set of conference control functions that can be invoked by users directly. As an example of interworking, interoperation of IETF's SIP and ITU's H.323 call control functions have been examined here. This paper shows that a careful analysis of a conferencing architecture can provide a set of control functions essential for any group communication model that can be extensible if needed.\n\nExpedition 33 Press Conference\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2012-10-22\n\nExpedition 33 Flight Engineer Evgeny Tarelkin waves hello as he is introduced at the start of a press conference held at the Cosmonaut Hotel, on Monday, October 22, 2012, in Baikonur, Kazakhstan.
