On 10 July 1908, the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes liquefied helium for the first time at the University of Leiden.

Three years later, in 1911, he discovered superconductivity, and in 1913, he was awarded the Nobel prize in physics for his discoveries.

In honor of his groundbreaking work and to raise awareness of the importance of helium conservation, Quantum Design declares July 10 “Helium Conservation Day”.

In below youtube video we highlight not only the efforts of Quantum Design, but of researchers all over the world who utilize cryogen-free technologies or recycle helium in order to avoid helium waste in laboratories, hospitals or other facilities.
