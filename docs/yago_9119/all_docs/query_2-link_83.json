        "text": "In “The Secret Life of Words,” Canadian actress Sarah Polley shrinks into the role of Hanna, a crumpled, hearing-impaired young factory worker with an Eastern European accent who lives somewhere in Britain.\n\nNumbly discharging the rituals of daily life, Hanna rarely speaks and prefers to seal herself in silence by turning off her hearing aid.\n\nOnly once does she reach out, by telephoning a mysterious older woman (Julie Christie, compelling in a cameo role) who we later learn lives in Denmark and works for a human rights organization. Even then, Hanna doesn’t speak.\n\nHer drab routine — each day at lunchtime she consumes the same bland meal of chicken, rice and half an apple — is interrupted by a summons from her boss, who commends her for punctuality and perfect attendance in the four years she has worked at the factory, but insists she take a vacation.\n\nThus begins Hanna’s awakening.\n\nThe movie, written and directed by the Spanish filmmaker Isabel Coixet, whose last feature, “My Life Without Me,” also starred Polley, prolongs the mystery of her identity until well after the halfway point. Then it explodes into a catharsis.\n\nWhile on holiday in a coastal town in Northern Ireland, Hanna overhears a cell phone conversation about a fire at an offshore oil rig that killed one man and left another seriously burned and in need of care.\n\nVolunteering her services as a nurse, she is flown to the rig and meets the burn victim, Josef (Tim Robbins).\n\nA tattooed roughneck with a kind heart, Josef is flirtatious, playful and life-loving. From the moment Hanna appears, he bombards her with questions that she refuses to answer. When she won’t even give her name, he dubs her Cora.\n\nJosef slowly begins confiding his own secrets, including the fact that the name Cora belongs to his best friend’s wife, and that he can’t swim. Almost imperceptibly, she begins to warm.\n\nAt long last, Hanna, in a small, quiet voice, delivers a shattering soliloquy whose details remain seared in your mind long after the movie is over. As Josef absorbs the shock of her confession and begins to shudder with sobs, he gathers her in his arms.\n\nAs eloquent as Hanna’s confession may be, the tearful embrace the pair shares conveys far deeper feelings.\n\n“The Secret Life of Words” fitfully diverts its gaze to the other inhabitants of the oil rig, which has been shut down since the fire. As these oddballs and loners, isolated in the middle of a gray churning sea, wait for their future to be disclosed, the movie sketches a parallel world of people in a limbo of isolation and uncertainty.\n\nBut when “The Secret Life of Words” returns to Hanna and Josef and their struggle to connect and to heal, it glows with humanity.\n\nRATED: R STARS: Sarah Polley, Tim Robbins, Javier Cámara, Julie Christie THEATER: Hippodrome Cinema\n\nThe Secret Life of Words"
