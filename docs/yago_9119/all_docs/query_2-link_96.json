        "text": "Dying isn’t as easy as it looks!\n\nYear Released: 2003\n\nDirector: Isabel Coixet\n\nCast: Sarah Polley, Scott Speedman, Mark Ruffalo, Julian Richings and Deborah Harry\n\nYou know when you see a movie synopsis and you say to yourself “there’s no way it can fit that description”? That’s what we have here with “My Life Without Me”, a movie described on Amazon Prime as “an emotional, beautiful, poignant and critically acclaimed drama that will stay with you long after the credits role”.\n\nNo pressure.\n\nIt’s a bold claim to make and we’ll have to see if it lives up to that as often, with this type of movie, it is quite the opposite and is largely forgettable, but with a very good score of 7.5/10 on IMDB from just under 25,000 votes, I’m actually mildly optimistic that this can actually be what is turning into a rare approved movie.\n\nCast\n\nWhen Ann (Polley) is walking home from work, her friend comments that she looks like she has lost a lot of weight. Ann brushes it off at first, but does eventually get a medical check-up. After a few test, Ann is told that she has cancer and has three months, at best, to live. Despite this, she doesn’t initially tell anyone, and secretly compiles a bucket list, one part of which is to have sex with another man after only ever being with Don (Speedman).\n\nAt the laundrette, she meets Lee (Ruffalo), who saw her a few days before when she was writing the bucket list. They start an affair, but like everyone else, Ann hasn’t told him that she is dying.\n\nHow long can she keep it hidden?\n\nSo, was the description accurate, or completely overselling it?\n\nI think I am correct in saying that 7.5/10 is the highest rated movie I’ve reviewed on this site since starting it in 2014 (that I hadn’t seen beforehand), but it most definitely doesn’t deserve it. One of the reasons I tend to use IMDB is that it tends to actually be right, with only the odd incorrect score (in my opinion), but none have a larger discrepancy than “My Life Without Me”.\n\nNow, “My Life Without Me” isn’t necessarily a bad film, but to describe it as something one that will stick with you is just outright wrong. It is a completely forgettable use of 100 or so minutes of your life and if you want a movie about someone dying that sticks with you afterwards, go with “A Ghost Story”.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this, but the main one is simply because Ann doesn’t seem to care about her situation. Other than the odd bit here and there, you’d be forgiven for thinking this was just a film about a bored woman who seeks thrills in an affair. There are so few scenes dedicated to her illness that it just turns into a generic drama. Those that feature her actually seemingly giving the slightest crap that she is dying, such as when she is recording tapes for after she has died, but other than that, she barely shows anything even resembling someone that cares. If the main character doesn’t care that they’re going to die, why should I?\n\nActing-wise, it is easy to see why it has several nominations, including the Genie and Vancouver Film Critic Circle wins for “Best Actress” for Polley, but that is the biggest praise I can give to the film. Everyone is superb, although I couldn’t say the same about the characters.\n\nEvery single character is one-dimensional and one-note, and it wouldn’t be so bad if they all actually served a purpose. For example, there is a scene dedicated to Ann getting a new haircut, but the hairdresser is obsessed with giving her braids and won’t drop it, not even when they later meet each other at a bar. Even later on, when she revisits the salon to have her nails done, that character is still going on about braids. What is the actual point?\n\n“My Life Without Me” is not a film worthy of such a very decent 7.5/10 on IMDB.\n\nSummary\n\nA film with a high score of 7.5 on IMDB and yet doesn’t do anything to really justify having that. The acting is the only praiseworthy part of “My Life Without Me”.\n\nIt’s not necessarily a bad film, but it is hard to really care about a character’s death if that person doesn’t seem that bothered about their own mortality.\n\n“My Life Without Me” is currently available to watch on Amazon Prime."
