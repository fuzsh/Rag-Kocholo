        "text": "Set in the icy climes of Greenland in 1908, the film is inspired by the true story of Josephine Peary, the naïve but determined wife of Robert Peary, the American explorer at the forefront of several expeditions to reach the North Pole. The making of the film is in all an anecdote. The Spanish hairstylist Paco Rodríguez and the make-up artist Sylvie Imbert, relied on the Termix hairdressing tools to style the actors in very extreme geographical circumstances:\n\n“We shot for some days on location in Norway, facing difficult logistical and weather conditions at very low temperature, which complicated the styling of the actors. Moreover we had to keep the natural hairstyle of that time, which we could only achieve with high-quality products like the Termix hairbrushes and styling irons, that sealed and gave us the desired elasticity”, underlines Paco Rodríguez.\n\n“Besides styling the actors, we also used wigs that require a special treatment. We could only take little material to the set of filming; to get there it took us more than half an hour. So we only had a support, a pair of scissors and a set of brushes and combs Termix for some unexpected. Instead, in the studio, where they used artificial snow, the task was more complicated because hair tangles more easily” explains Paco Rodríguez.\n\nThe film is one of 19 in competition for Berlin’s Golden Bear prize, which will be awarded on 14 February by a jury headed by the director Darren Aronofsky."
