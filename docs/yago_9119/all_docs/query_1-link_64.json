        "text": "Tracking down a first-edition copy of Vladimir Nabokov’s 1955 classic “Lolita” isn’t too difficult. But for her latest film, “The Bookshop,” set in 1959, director Isabel Coixet needed 250 of them.\n\n“It took us about a year to get all those books,” the filmmaker tells The Post, adding that she and production designer Llorenç Miquel settled on a mixture of actual vintage tomes and convincing reproductions of the real thing. “It was really important for me to have details that really belonged to the moment of the film — from the food, to the landscapes, to, of course, the books.”\n\nBased on a 1978 novella by Penelope Fitzgerald, “The Bookshop” tells the story of rambunctious widow Florence Green (Emily Mortimer), who decides to open a bookstore in a provincial seaside town in Sussex, England. She faces local resistance from the get-go, but when she starts stocking the scandalous “Lolita,” her quaint shop becomes both a hot spot and a cultural lightning rod.\n\nAside from “Lolita,” Fitzgerald’s tale cites few other real titles, which meant that Coixet could stock Florence’s fictional shop with some of her favorite volumes, including 1929’s “A High Wind in Jamaica,” by Richard Hughes, and Ray Bradbury’s “The Martian Chronicles.”\n\n“Many of them actually come from my own library,” says Coixet, an avid vintage-book collector. One such gem? “The Jessie H. Bancroft book of physical exercise,” she says, referring to the 1940s edition of an early 20th-century manual that one of the townsfolk is seen ogling at the shop.\n\n“I bought it at a literary festival a few years ago, and the cover shows how to do physical exercise with this semi-naked woman,” says Coixet. “I thought it would be a funny thing to add.”\n\nBut many of the books featured in the film aren’t there just for the scenery: They reveal character and advance the plot. One of the first scenes shows the reclusive Edmund Brundish (Bill Nighy), an eccentric, intellectual misanthrope who later becomes Florence’s ally, devouring masterpieces by Edith Wharton and Jane Austen.\n\n“I wanted to show that he had very good taste, but that he’s very much stuck in this realm of classic books,” says Coixet. “So, by the time Florence comes along, I think he’s starving to meet new people — and she can open up his world.”\n\nShe does so by introducing him to Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451,” which Coixet says changed her life as a teen.\n\n“I thought, ‘What kind of book would be the most new for a guy who lives a little outside of time?’ ” she says. Nor does it hurt that the book-burning dystopia of “Fahrenheit” echoes the anti-literature community in “The Bookshop.”\n\nCoixet couldn’t get every book on her wish list, Horace McCoy’s Depression-era-set “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” among them. And reproducing every title wasn’t possible.\n\n“You had to find the person who owns the rights of the particular cover that a bookshop in 1959 would have had, then get permission to use it,” the director says. “It was a long process.”\n\nBut that kind of commitment to authenticity, she believes, makes the movie.\n\n“When the actors touch those books and open those books, having them touch pieces that actually belong to that era really affects them,” she says. “It was worth it.”"
