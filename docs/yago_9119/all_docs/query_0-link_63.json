        "text": "Directed and co-written by prolific Spanish director Isabel Coixet (THE BOOKSHOP, THE SECRET LIFE OF WORDS), searing drama Un Amor tells a story of passion and power in rural Spain. Escaping stressful city-life and aiming to start afresh, thirty-year old Natalia (Laia Costa, also in THE TEACHER WHO PROMISED THE SEA) finds refuge in La Escapa, a small village deep in the Spanish countryside. In a dilapidated house with a dog by her side, Nat faces hostility from her landlord and distrust from the local villagers. After a strange encounter, Nat gives in to a proposal from her neighbour Andreas (Hovik Keuchkerian, MONEY HEIST, THE NIGHT MANAGER), sparking a devouring passion that will force her to reconsider who she thought she was. Based on the eponymous bestselling novel by Sara Mesa, named by Spanish newspaper EL PAÍS as Spain’s 2020 book of the year, UN AMOR is a bittersweet and striking exploration of gender roles, love, obsession and desire."
