Women blame themselves for everything that is wrong, and men never do that. We have to stop blaming ourselves for what we don't have and start asking for what we deserve - whether it's more money or more work or whatever.\n\n[on shooting 'Elegy' in Vancouver] If there was any one problem with Vancouver it was that no one walks fast enough. When we were shooting the exteriors I was constantly asking the extras to move faster. They didn't walk fast enough to pass for New Yorkers.\n\nAnything complicated is now seen as poison at the box office. If Ingmar Bergman was around these days Il'm not sure that he would find the money to make any of his films."
