        "text": "The Yellow Ceiling explains and denounces the Case of the Lleida Theater Classroom through its protagonists. In 2018, a group of 9 women filed a complaint against two of their teachers for sexual abuse that occurred between 2001 and 2008, when they were teenagers. It was too late. Out of fear, out of shame, because it took them a long time to understand and digest what had happened, the complaint came when the case had already been prescribed and was filed.\n\nDirector."
