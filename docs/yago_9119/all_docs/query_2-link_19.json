        "text": "Continuing with her prolific career Spanish director Isabel Coixet has recently just wrapped up production on her film Learning to Drive starring Ben Kingsley and\n\nPatricia Clarkson, all before the release of her psychological thrillerAnother Me this fall via Fox International and starring Sophie Turner and\n\nJonathan Rhys Meyers. As if that wasn’t enough, the director is getting ready to start yet another project titled Nobody Wants the Night, which stars acting giants like Willem Dafoe and Juliette Binoche, and young Rinko Kikuchi.\n\nCoixet is one of a kind, as a woman director she is one of the very few that has also served as camera operator in several of her films, her distinct style and never-ending desire to create new work have earned her a distinct place in international cinema. Her body of work spans to ten films in both the narrative and documentary realms making her one of the most prolific directors workign today. She has premiered her films at the most important film festivals including Cannes’ Official Section,\n\nBerlin and Venice, and has worked with many of the most respected actors worldwide\n\n2013 was a very busy year for Coixet, finishing Learning to Drive, which is based\n\non Katha Pollitt’s essay and tells the story of a self-absorbed\n\nbook critic (played by Clarkson) who, after a recent breakup, signs up\n\nfor driving lessons as part of an effort to move on with her life.\n\nHer instructor is a Sikh man living in Queens (played by Kingsley), and\n\ntogether they will help each other to move forward with their lives. Now awaiting the release of Another Me, based on Cathy MacPhail’s young adult novel of the same name about identity anxiety in a teenage girl, played by\n\nGame of Thrones’ star Turner in her film debut, the director is also getting ready to start shooting Nobody Wants the Night early next year in Norway.\n\nHer latest project is\n\nthe story of two women, from two different worlds, and their struggle\n\nto survive in one of the most inhospitable places on Earth. Josephine\n\n(to be\n\nplayed by Binoche) is a proud yet naive woman in love with a man who\n\nprefers glory and ice to the comforts of an upper-class home. Allaka (to\n\nbe played by Kikuchi), a young but wise Inuit woman, is in love with\n\nthe same man with whom she’s expecting a child.\n\nSet against the backdrop of a relentless icy landscape, the film\n\nchronicles their long, tense wait for the same man they love in such\n\ndistinct ways."
