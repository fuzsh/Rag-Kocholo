The DARK RED routes 26.3km ,long runs from Bang Sue to Rangsit and trial operations will also begin in July 2021 with the public invited to travel free of charge. During 2020 three lines were opened or extended. The GOLD line was opened betweeen Thon Buri and Khlong San with extensions made to the BLUE and GREEN lines.\n\nCHINA There have been several developments affecting railways in China. The high-speed railway between Hefei and Anqing (162km) was opened on 22 December 2020. It has been built for operation at 350 km/hour and will become eventually a part of the planned high-speed route between Beijing and Hong Kong. Five trains each way daily began operation on 22 December 2020 taking 1 hour 20m or 1 hour 27 minutes depending on the intermediate stops. An enhanced timetable is expected when the new National Rail Timetable is introduced on 20 January 2021. Construction of the Bianyuzhou Bridge across the Yangtse River began in 2018 and will be used when the next section of the H-S route is opened. The Beijing – Xiong’a railway was completed on 27 December 2020 and after testing is completed will become a 91km extension from Beijing Daxing International Airport Station. Another new line on which testing commenced on 30 November 2020 will link Yinchuan with Xi’an.\n\nSOUTH KOREA It is hoped to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by replacing all diesel powered trains with new emus by 2029. In BUSAN the NamSeoul Light Rail Company awarded a contract worth Won 329.5bn to Hyundai Rotem with Gwangju Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation to operate and maintain the Sillim Line automated light metro which will open later in 2021. Twelve 3-car rubber tyred train sets will work services on this line.\n\n1 January 2021\n\nINDIA The Asian Development Bank has approved a $500m loan to cover the cost of building a Metro system in in BENGALURU. There will be two lines totalling 56 route km, most of it on elevated structures following major highways. Thirty stations will be built and one terminus will be at Kempegowda International Airport. Meanwhile construction began on 7 December 2020 of a two-line metro in AGRA.\n\nMYANMAR The National Railways is ordering from CAF + Mitsubishi eleven 6-car metro-style units to operate on the Yangon Circular Railway cutting the travel time around the route from 170 to 110 minutes. Also ordered are thirty 6-car trains to run on the north main line linking Yangon and Mandalay (620km).cutting the journey time from 15 to 8 hours.\n\n6 December 2020\n\nCHINA The Guangzhou Metro extnsion of Line 8 from Cultural Park to Baiyun was opened on 26 November 2020 adding 16.3km and 11 stations to the system.\n\nINDIA Chittaranjan Works produced 200 new locomotives during the first 159 working days of 2020. In the 1950s the Works produced some steam and diesel locomotives but has now become the world’s largest producer of electric locomotives, building 431 during the financial year 2019-20. Chittaranjan is a railway town 230km north of Calcutta.\n\nPAKISTAN The Orange Line in Lahore was opened on 25 October 2020. Twenty seven 5-car train sets were supplied for the line by CRRC Zhouzhou\n\n23 November 2020\n\nJAPAN JR East is to conduct trials on an automated driverless E7 Shinkansen “bullet train” to address a problem of a shortage of drivers to operate the trains.\n\nCHINA A driverless suspended monorail is being tested on a 800m long track. The two-car train can reach 80km/hour. A 10.5 km monorail in Wuhan is scheduled to open for public services in 2021. Bombardier has secured the contract to build 112 high-speed coaches for the ever-growing high-speed network across China.\n\nTHAILAND Major upgrades are to be performed in a desparate effort to help resolve the chaotic congestion on the city’a main roads leading to stagnation of most activities. The largest station in SE Asia is being built in Bangkok. The 12 platformed Bang Sue Grandstation will replace Hua Lamphong station and the new station will be used by Intercity trains, the city’s Metro, commuter services, and high-speed trains to three Airports – Suvarnabkumi, Don Mueng and U-Tapao. The last two named are 220 km apart but will be linked in under an hour by new high-speed services. The 12 platforms will be 600m long and will often accommodate more than a single train. There will be 24 tracks in the station allowing trains to access a platform that has another train in part of a platform. Bang Sue Grand will be used by 600,000 passengers each day – ten times the number squeezed into Hua Lamphong. The station will be pollution free since all services will use electric power.\n\n10 November 2020\n\nPAKISTAN The Orange Line metro in Lahore was opened in late October 2020 and has been designed to carry up to a quarter of a million passengers each day. It is 27km long and will slash journey times from the outer suburbs to the city centre from 2½ hours to under 1 hour. A low fare is charged and many of the passengers are expected to be women since men tend to travel using their own bike but most women do not own a bike. Fare income does not cover operational costs and the Government will pay from tax income a 5bn rupee (£23.8m) subsidy.\n\nTHAILAND The Government has issued contracts for the design of a new standard gauge railway between Bangkok (Bang Sue) and Nakhon Ratchasima (253km) in the north east of the nation together with a fleet of emus. The contract has been won by the CRIC Railway Design Corporation and is valued at 50.63 bn baht. The eventual total cost of this railway is estimated at 179bn baht. Work has started on phase 2 of the new railway – 354.5km long taking the line to Nong Kai close to the border of Laos. It may connect with the new railway being built in Laos and may eventually be linked along Malaysia to Singapore. The opening of the new Bang Sue Grand Station has been delayed to late 2021 because the coronavirus pandemic has prevented Japanese contractcors visiting the work sites.\n\nCHINA Major metro openings happened in two cities on 28 October 2020. In Shenzhen Line 2 was extended 3.9km to the east to Liantang. Line 3 was extended by 1.7km south to Futian Bonded Area. Line 4, which is operated by the Hong Kong MTR Corporation, was extended by 10.8 km north to Niuhu. 8.8km of the extension are below ground and the remainder is on an elevated structure. In Wuxi the city’s third metro line runs across the central area between Sumiao to the west to Sunan Shuofang International Airport in the south eastern suburbs.\n\nISRAEL Construction is going ahead on the tram-train route between Haifa and Nazareth (48km).\n\n12 October 2020\n\nCHINA The first section of Chengdu Express Metro Line 18 was opened to public services on 27 September 2020, exactly ten years since the opening of the city’s first section of Metro. The completed line will run from South Railway Station to Tianfu New Area, 66.2 km.\n\n1 October 2020\n\nJAPAN On 26 August 2020 JR East started remedial work on many of the concrete columns supporting the elevated structures carrying the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines, built nearly 50 years ago. Innacurate calculations regarding how much these columns might move during earthquakes means that some columns might now be at risk of failure. They are being strengthened by building a “cuff” around them.\n\nCHINA Metro Line 4 in Kunming 43.4 km long, was opened on 25 September 2020. An extension to line 6, 7.3km long, was opened at the same time. In Ningbo an extension to Metro Line on 27 September 2020 this being a southern extension of the existing elevated route from the central area into the suburbs.\n\nAZERBAIJAN Modernisation is under way on both north – south, and east – west routes in the neighbourhood of the port city of Baku. Baku sits at the head of the Abseron Peninsula which juts into the Caspian Sea. The north – south line was built as recently as 1963, but soon fell out of use. It is now being double-tracked and electrified so that quite heavy freight traffic can be routed that way and not have to go through the Baku conurbation. This will free up space on the railways running east – west into the city including the Baku Circular Railway on which services can now be increased. The electrified railways serving Baku itself were upgraded during August 2020 from 3kV DC to 25 kV AC 50 Hz.\n\nINDIA The design of new emus for use on the 82 km long Delhi – Meerut commuter route has been inspired by the appearance of the famous Lotus Temple in Delhi. Bombardier has built coaches to form thirty 6-car sets for use on longer journeys, and ten 3-car sets for what is described as “intra-urban services”. In effect these are short distance routes with frequent stops within a single urban area.\n\nISRAEL Test running on the newly electrified Jerusalem – Tel Aviv line commenced on 6 September 2020. The line uses 25kV AC 50 Hz and commercial services are expected within a few weeks. Trains will operate at up to 160 km/hour. The journey from Jerusalem Yitzhak Navon station to Tel Aviv University will take 47 minutes, and to Hertzliya 55 minutes. Nation-wide connectiions are available at Hertzliya.\n\n3 September 2020\n\nCHINA Two new Metro lines were opened on 18 August 2020 in the city of Shenzhen. Line 6, the Guangmin Line, is 49 km long and runs from the north west suburbs to the Science Museum in the city centre. Fifty one 6-car aluminium bodied trains have been supplied by CRRC for this line. Line 10 runs north-south and much is parallel to the earlier Line 4 which has attracted so much traffic that the trains are dangerously overcrowded for much of the day. Some of Line 4’s traffic will switch to the new Line 10.\n\nJAPAN The East Japan Railway has embarked on a three day trial of moving freshly caught fish from Sendai (dep 1041) to Tokyo (arr 1248). The fish is then delivered to city centre restaurants including many in the station complex itself. Fresh fruit and vegetabbles have been moved on the Joetsu Shinkansen reaching Shinjuku station at 1430. The first coach of the high-speed train is used to carry the foodstuffs which travel in boxes placed on the coach seats.\n\nUZBEKISTAN The first short (2.9km) section of the orbital Metro in Toshkent was opened on 29 August 2020. A much larger event came on 30 August when the first 11km section of the Halqa Line was opened. The route is entirely on an elevated structure and has seven stations.\n\n3 August 2020\n\nCHINA The construction of a two-line tramway in the city of Turpan was commenced on 22 July 2020. The lines will run to tourist sites from transport facilities such as the main station.\n\nMALAYSIA & SINGAPORE A ceremony was held on the causeway linking Johor Bahru in Malaysia with Singapore to mark the restart of work on the Johor Bahru – Singapore Rapid Transit System Link that will create a high-capacity urban corridor between the two nations. Work was suspended on 1 April 2019 at Malaysia’s request in order to give more time to review the plans. A few changes have been made – notably a decision not to use the existing Mandai Depot in Singapore but to build a new depot at Wadi Hana in Johor Barhu.\n\n13 July 2020\n\nARAB GULF STATES A $15bn railway network will open in two phases starting in 2023 with a line between Saudi Arabia, Oman, and United Arab Emirates. In 2025 a line will enter service between Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain.\n\nIRAN Track laying began on 7 July 2020 on the first section of the 628km long railway that will link Zahedan, on the existing rail network, with Chabahar, Iran’s only ocean port on the Gulf of Oman. When the whole route is opened in two-three year’s time, passenger trains will operate at 160 km/hour and freight services at 120 km/hour.\n\nINDIA The first section of the new 308km long railway between Nadikudi and Srikalahaste has been completed. The new line will eventually provide a direct railway between Secunderabad and Andra Pradesh, reducing the distance between these localities by 96km. In contrast to many other areas in the world India Railways is embarrassed by the volume of traffic that it carries on its 1350 daily trains. It could fill a further 7000 trains each day but does not have sufficient rolling stock or the funds to obtain more. The result is the loss of traffic to airlines or long distance bus routes. There are 109 city pairs in India each of which needs an improved service so private operators are being invited to bid for franchises of up to 35 years. Each operator would obtain new rolling stock using their own funds. 151 train sets each with at least 16 coaches will be required.\n\nCHINA New heavy rail lines continue to be built across the nation making it easier to travel between distant centres. Shanghai to Nantong, 143km was opened during June 2020 and is designed for 200km/hour operation. The line includes a road and rail bridge 1092m long spanning the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The initial passenger service comprises 29 trains each way daily the fastest requiring 70 minutes. Many of the trains are extended to Chengdu or Guangzhou.\n\nIn Beijing a new suburban line was opened on 30 June 2020 to Liangxiang, 31.31 km and taking 25 minutes. The suburban network around Beijing now totals 353 route km.\n\nJAPAN On 13 June 2020 the Central Japan Railway launched its first Series N700S high-speed train on a special service filled by press reporters along the Tokaido Shinkansen. The trains entered service for normal fare-paying passengers on 6 July 2020. The “S” in the train designation stands for “Supreme”. These have improved suspension giving a smoother ride and have a top speed of 223 mph, compared with 177 mph on the older N700A trains.\n\n2 July 2020\n\nINDIA The contract to install a new signalling and telecommunications system along a 417km long freight line between Bhauper and Meghalsarai in Uttar Pradesh has been cancelled. This is partly because of the very slow progress with the work, and partly because relations between India and China have deteriorated recently.\n\nTHAILAND The Bangkok Mass Transit system has taken delivery of the first of three two-car Bombardier Innovia 300 automated people-movers. To operate on the 2.7km long Gold Line that will connect the Green Line (Silom Line) at Krung Thon Buri with new housing areas and the Taksin Hospital. A 4.5km extension to the Green Line was opened on 5 June 2020.\n\nMYANMAR A Chinese railway group has expressed interest in conducting a feasibility study for a 650km line between Mandalay and a new seaport. Services would operate at up to 160km/hour. A further extension back from Mandalay to Kunming in China would take the length to 1215km. The cost would be $9bn for the line south from Mandalay, or $20bn for the extension into China.\n\nINDIA With 15,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day, the army has been called in help with hospitals becoming overwhelmed. With actual rail travel now at very low levels several dozen carriages have been turned into emergency wards.\n\n18 June 2020\n\nPAKISTAN A major upgrade to the main line between Karachi and Peshawar (1872km) costing $7.2bn will transform communications within the nation and help create links with the Chinese railways. The effect will be a significant improvement to the country’s economic position.\n\nINDIA The regular operation of double-stack container trains under overhead electrification power wires commenced on 10 June 2020 between Palanpur and Botad (270Km) on the Western Railway. The concept of operating double stack container trains was developed in 2008 but agreement to launch this service took several years.\n\nJAPAN The Kobe Rapid Transit Railway’s standard gauge Kitajia Line was transferred to the Kobe City Transport Bureau on 1 June 2020. It is now named the Kobe Municipal Subway Kitikami Line and the fares charged have been reduced by a modest amount.\n\nCHINA Through freight trains to Europe are running more frequently due to a sharp growth in business. On 6 May 2020 the number of such trains run so far in 2020 reached 1000 carrying 1,923m tonnes of cargo – up 41.79% compared with 2019. All services from China start from the freight depot at Xi’an and a new service to Barcelona commenced during April 2020. The freight trains are taking business from air-freight rivals since both take around 10-15 days for the journey. Air takes this long because of substantial delays in handling the freight at airport terminals and air freight is four times as expensive as the cost by rail.\n\n5 June 2020\n\nJAPAN A drop in the number of passengers carried on Tokyo suburban services happened as the virus pandemic struck in March 2020. During the period since then work patterns have been altered so that the peak periods are spread out over significantly longer periods. The result in early June is that trains are almost as crowded as ever and be-gloved platform staff still have to push people tightly into carriages – only now the period when this is necessary is longer!\n\nCHINA Twenty four 6-car train sets have been supplied by CRRC for the driverless automated metro in Taiyuan Line 2. The line is expected to be carrying passengers in late 2020. In Hong Kong there have been delays in the construction of the Shatin Central Link but a Commision of Enquiry looking into reasons for the delays has concluded that work done will be suitable for public use. The work is now 93% complete and the opening of the Kai Tak – Hung Hom section is expected during 2021 with the Hung Hom – Admiralty section below the Harbour early in 2021.\n\nINDIA A major increase in the number of long distance trains running across the nation commenced operation on 1 June 2020. From 30 pairs of trains the number operating daily rose to 200 pairs. Large crowds gathered at stations hoping to get a seat. Many of the workforce move from their homes in rural areas to the major cities where they work for several months before returning home with savings from their earnings. In 2020 work for itinerant labourers has been hard to find making it difficult for some to afford a ticket.\n\n25 May 2020\n\nISRAEL A bidder is sought to design, build, and operate the planned new route between Haifa and Nazareth. The first electric trains operated between the major stations in Tel Aviv on 5 May 2020.\n\nINDIA The 9000hp class WAG-9HH electric locomotives built at Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) has been certified for operation at 100km/hour hauling freight services on main lines. The 9HH is an upgrade of the WAG-9H 6000hp class designed by staff at CLW. Each of the new 9HH locomotives costs 110bn Rupees, 10bn more than for one of the 9H machines. CLW is now working on a passenger version of the 9HH. Indian Railways are upgrading the track and obtaining new more powerful locomotives in order to attain a more powerful position in the travel market in which internal air services and road haulage firms are emerging.\n\nIndian Railways has completed tests on the first of 800 of new Class Prima T8 freight locomotive. The twin Bo-Bo loco 60027, hauled a load of 118 wagons on the East Central Railway broad gauge (1676mm) freight corridor line. On these lines the overhead catenery is higher above the tracks than on a mixed traffic line making it easier to transport out-of-gauge items.\n\nThe Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation has called for bids to design the elevated sections of a planned two line Metro in Surat, a city of 6m people 230 km north of Mumbai. Line 1 will be 21.6 km long and 4km will be on an elevated structure. The entire 18.7km Line 2 will be elevated.\n\nBANGLADESH The Dhaka Metro has increased its order for 6-car sets for the standard gauge 1.5kV DC line. The trains are being produced by Kawasaki + Mitsubishi. The construction of the 19.9km elevated line is now 45% complete and passenger services are planned to start I December 2021.\n\n13 May 2020\n\nCHINA A light rail line was opened on 1 May 2020 in the city of Tianshui, 300 km west of Xi’an. The line runs from the main line railway station 12.9km along the north bank of the River Wei and River Jei to the suburb of Wulipu. There are eleven stations with another to be opened in a few months time. The trams are battery powered with recharging at all stations from a pantograoh on the tram roof and an overhead conductor rail. The trams are low-floor and each can carry 370 people of whom 58 are seated. There are plans for a network of five lines and a combined route length of 90km.\n\nINDIA A gradual re-introduction of passenger services on the State Railways began on 12 May 2020.\n\n1 May 2020\n\nINDIA In Delhi contracts have been issued to LT Construction for the building of 32km of railway much of which will be on elevated structures and will include seven stations.. The Delhi – Meerut Regional Rapid Transit system will eventually have three routes linking Delhi with satellite townships. It will provide rapid journeys on 1676mm (5’6”) gauge tracks electrified at 25kV AC with trains operating at 160km/hour and a top speed of 180km/hour.\n\nCHINA An astonishing 70km of new metro lines was opened in Hangzhou on 23 April 2020.\n\n21 April 2020\n\nJAPAN The East Japan Railway opened Takanawa station in late March 2020. It is the 30th station on the Yamanote Loop which links together all the railways radiating out from central Tokyo, and has platforms also on the Keihin Tohoku line which links the station to the Tokyo Metro. The Takanawa area is about to see major office developments that will attract heavy traffic to the already busy railways.\n\nJAPAN MAGLEV LINE Construction work on the Tokyo – Nagoya Maglev line has been suspended. The new line will be 236km long and a Maglev train will cover the distance in 40 minutes. At present the Tokaido Shinkansen links the two cities and Central Japan Railway journey times for the various types of service are:- Nozomi trains 1 hour 40 minutes, Hikari trains just over 2 hours, and Kodama trains 3 hours. The Maglev line was due to open in 2027.\n\nJAPAN & VIRUS EFFECT Although the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading across Japan, Taiwan, and Korea the effects are so far less severe than in UK. There is however a feeling that there is about to be (from 20 April 2020) a sharp deterioration in the position. However I believe that in Japan when clear advice is given by the Government, it is followed closely by most people. In UK compliance is poorer. In Tokyo commuter trains are operating to the normal basic timetable but overcrowding is less severe due to some folk working at home. It is now possible to achieve 2m distant apart from a fellow traveller in the middle of the day. Long distance travel is affected significantly. Almost all international and many domestic flights have been cancelled. On the Shinkansen, two additional Nozomi services were added each hour to the Tokaido Line schedule on 14 March 2020 but almost immediately were cancelled. These services were to be in addition to 10 Nozomi, 2 Hikari, and 2 Kodama services each hour. The delay of the Olympic Games until 2021 adds another factor and Japan could even lose the right to hold the deferred Games since venues may not be ready. Travelling numbers on the Shinkansen lines have halved and the ability to reserve a seat has been cancelled. The other high-speed lines, JR Hokkaido, JR East, JR West, and JR Kyushu have trimmed their timetables in a similar way.\n\nCHINA Public transport operations restarted in Wuhan, where the virus pandemic started. It had not been possible to enter or leave the city for 78 days but pandemic seems to be past its peak and normal services are beginning to restart.\n\nINDIA The first 5.7km of the east – west Metro were inaugurated on 13 February 2020. The line will continue below the Hooghly River to end at Howrah Station. To tackle the effects of the coronavirus pandemic 5000 passenger coaches are to be converted for hospital use. The cancellation of passenger rail services was extended on 15 April 2020 to 3 May 2020. Long distance, suburban, the Kolkata Metrorail, and mail trains were all removed from the timetable to create additional space for freight trains bringing urgent supplies to area hit by the coronavirus.\n\nINDIA – NEW CONTRACTS L&T Construction has won two contracts to build the infrastructure for a new regional Rapid Transit route. This is for a 32 km long route between Duhai to Modi Nagar and Shatabdi Nagar. The line will be used by longer distance commuters using faster services with fewer more spaced out stations.\n\nTURKEY The Ankara – Sivas high speed railway will follow a much more direct route than the present conventional rail link. A journey on the new H-S Line will take 2 hours 50 minutes for the 405km journey. At present it takes 10 hours for the 602km journey.\n\n1 April 2020\n\nTURKEY All intercity trains have been discontinued and most domestic flights cancelled in an effort to reduce the movement of people during the virus pandemic.\n\nISRAEL The State Railways have adopted an updated, accelerated plan to electrify at 25kV 50Hz 13 lines totalling four hundred and twenty route km. The cost has risen to US$139m and the work will be undertaken by contractor SEMI. The first regular passenger service between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem via the newish A1 fast line ran on 21 December 2019.\n\nINDIA The suspension of passenger services as a reaction to the coronavirus pandemic has been extended to 14 April 2020 and will be subject to review.\n\n30 March 2020\n\nJAPAN As a result of the coronavirus pandemic traffic on JNR’s Shinkansen network has plunged by 56%.\n\nCHINA The Hong Kong MTR Corporation is using automated hydrogen peroxide robots to perform deep cleaning and decontamination of its trains and platforms. The robot equipment takes four hours to clean an eight coach train.\n\nINDIA Indian Railways cancelled the entire passenger service (long distance and commuter) on 22 March 2020 until the end of March at which time the position would be reviewed.\n\nISRAEL All public transport in the nation was limited to operate between 0500 – 2000 on Mondays to Thursdays inclusive from 18 March 2020. There will be no public transport on Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays.\n\n13 March 2020\n\nLONG DISTANCE FREIGHT Because of the Coronavirus epidemic in China the through freight service to Europe was halted early in 2020. The weekly through train restarted from Xian in China taking 18 days to reach Duisburg in Germany. As traffic rises the service will operate twice weekly. Freight for the UK is trucked to Rotterdam and on a ferry to Purfleet.\n\nSINGAPORE Contracts have been let for the design and construction of the Jurong Region Line stations and a viaduct adjacent to one of them. The work may be completed by 2026.\n\nINDIA The first 5.7km of Kolkata’s second Metro Line was opened by the Minister of Railways on 13 February 2020.\n\nTURKEY Testing began on the 405km long Ankara – Sivas High-Speed line on 5 March 2020. The new line has 49 tunnels, 55 substantial viaducts, and 611 bridges. The trip time will by 2 hour 50 minutes compared to 10 hours using the rather indirect 602 km long conventional railway.\n\nISRAEL Consultations are getting under way about three possible heavy Metro routes across the city of Tel-Aviv totalling 145 route km with around 100 stations. The cost would be about $45bn and would connect with Red light rail line (which is under construction) and the planned Green, Yellow, and Purple light rail lines.\n\n1 March 2020\n\nINDIA The Hyderabad Metro Green Line was opened on 7 February 2020. The 11km long elevated route runs between Jubilee and Mahatma Gandhi. There is a major bus station at both of the termini. The first 5.7km section of the standard gauge east – west Metro Line in Kolkata was opened formally on 12 February 2020 with revenue service commencing on the next day. The completed Line 2 will be 16.5km long and will provide a link between the two major stations – Howrah and Sealdah – which are on opposite sides of the Hooghly River.\n\nSINGAPORE Hyundai Rotem is to supply sixty two 3-car trains for the new Jurong Line at a cost of S$416.5m. The fully automated trains will be ready in 2026 just in time for the planned opening of the Jurong Line. The first 3.2km of the Tomson – East Coast Line was opened on 31 January 2020.\n\nCHINA Bombardier Sifang is to build 160 CR400AF carriages for use on Chinese high-speed railway routes. Hong Kong MTR’s Tuen Ma Line was opened for revenue service on 14 February 2020. It is a prolongation of the Ma On Shan Line through eastern Kowloon.\n\nJAPAN Automated Train Operation (ATO) is being tested on JR West’s Osaka Loop Line as a precursor to the introduction of ATO on the busiest routes around Osaka. JR East is to introduce ATO on Joban Line local services in Tokyo during 2020.\n\n2 February 2020\n\nCHINA All forms of transport within and radiating from the central industrial city of Wuhan (pop 11m) was halted at 1000 on 23rd January 2020 in an effort to stop the spread of a serious virus infection. Large numbers were planning to travel to celebrate the Lunar New Year but the airport and railway station were closed and all departures cancelled. Local subway and bus services were halted and river ferry services were stopped. The city is situated around 400 miles inland from Shanghai and steel, fertilizer, and textile factories were all closed for the holiday period, and were to remain shut until after the infection had been brought under control. During the next few days local transport within most of China’s major cities was halted and intercity travel by rail, bus, or air was halted as authorities sought to stop the traditional “travel to see family and friends” during the Chinese New Year as a means of reducing the spread of the deadly virus.\n\n31 January 2020\n\nTURKEY Track laying on Metro Line 11 in Istanbul began on 18 January 2020. President Erdoğan attended the ceremonial welding of the first rails. The Airport Line will use the GoA4 automated system and the line will have an operating speed of 120 km/hour. Trains will operate with a headway of 300 seconds and services are expected to commence in August 2021.\n\nCHINA In Guanzhou a high-speed metro is planned linking relatively far-out suburbs with the city centre at speeds of 250 km/hour.\n\n2 January 2020\n\nQATAR The first phase of the driverless third line in Doha was opened on 10 December 2019.\n\nCHINA Many new railways have been opened. The 74km central section of the 140km long Guangzhou – Shenzhen inter-city line was opened on 15 December 2019 and is served by 37 trains daily each way. A new line between Yibin and Guiyang was opened on 16 December 2019 and trains will operate at 250km/hour. This completes the 648km Chengdu – Guiyang line which has opened in three stages from 2014. There are 20 trains each way, rising at the next timetable change to 44 each way. The fastest service takes 2 hours 59 minutes compared with 7 hours 27 minutes on the conventional railway. The 173km Subir – Mahai section was opened on 18 Dec. 2019. The construction of the 671km route which will lead eventually to Tibet was launched in 2012. The Beijing-Zhangjiakou high-speed line, 1174km, was opened on 30 December 2019 along with a 53km branch to Taizicheng which will serve Chongi Olympic Village for the 2022 Winter Olympics. The 16.3km long Pingtan Bridge across the Haitan Strait provides a road and rail link to Pingtan Island slashing journey time when it opened in 2019. Bombardier-CRRC Sifang Transportation are to supply the State Railway with a further ten 16-car CR400AF 350km/hour trains by mid 2020. This is the third order for trains of this type as traffic soars on the new railway.\n\nThe Beijing Metro is now the world’s longest at 699.3km and it has 405 stations.\n\n20 December 2019\n\nSAUDI ARABIA High-Speed services were launched from Jeddah Airport Station on 11 December 2019.

A failure in the signalling system is suspected to be the cause.\n\nCHINA CRRC Qingdao Sifang is to supply eight hydrogen fuel trams for use on a route in the city of Foshan. A 350 km/hour automated railway between Beijing and Zhangjikou (where some of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games will be held) is poised to open before the end of 2019.\n\nSOUTH KOREA Hyundai Rotem is to develop a hydrogen fuel tram – the latest type of LRV to tackle the problems of climate change.\n\nJAPAN The East Japan Railway has realigned its Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku suburban lines in Tokyo during a blockade on the lines on 16-17 November 2019. The work is part of a project to build a new station at Takanawa Gateway between Shinagawa and Tamachi on the site of a former locomotive and carriage depot. The new station will have two island platforms – one for each line – and a four storey building that will include a variety of uses including several restaurants. The building has been designed by Kenyo Kuma who is also designing the stadium for the 2022 Olympic Games. The new station will connect with the Asakusa Metro Line.\n\n9 November 2019\n\nCHINA The new Daxing Airport serving Beijing was opened to public services on 26 October 2019. It is linked to the city by a high-speed railway 47km long taking 20 minutes for the journey. There is also a metro line serving many intermediate suburbs and requiring nearly an hour for the journey. The 1813km long north – south coal railway, the Menghua Line, was opened on 28 September 2019. The Jingshen Line, a feeder line, opened on 27 September 2019.\n\nJAPAN The Nagoya Railway has updated its emu fleet by introducing Nippon Sharyo 9500 emus on its Meitetsu network. The new trains will result in a 20% saving in energy consumption. Automatic Train Operation is to be introduced on the East Japan Railway Co. Joban Line in Tokyo. The trains will run through to Tokyo city centre by through operation over the Chiyoda Line of the Metro. Typhoon Hagibis on 12-13 October 2019 resulted in major flooding and inundated ten high-speed trains that were stored on a low-lying cluster of sidings. The electric equipment on these trains was destroyed and the cost of restoring the trains is so high that instead of being repaired they have been scrapped. It is cheaper to obtain new trains.\n\nINDONESIA The first of 31 six-car emus for Jakarta’s Jabodebok light rail line has been delivered.\n\n25 October 2019\n\nINDIA Delhi metro line 9 (the Gray Line) was opened on 4 October 2019. The 4.2km line connects the satellite township of Najafgarh to Line 3 (The Blue Line) at Dwarka. Major improvements are being introduced to inter-city services as the railways tackle the growing competition from air services and improved roads. A new service commenced operation between Lucknow and new Delhi on 4 October 2019. Leaving Lucknow at 0610 the “Tajas Express” reaches New Delhi (500km) at 1225 making just two intermediate stops. It returns at1630 reaching Lucknow at 2215. This service operates six days per week with maintenance etc taking place on Tuesdays. The Vaude Bharat Express between New Delhi and Varanese commenced operation in February 2019 and a second return service on this route was added on 3 October 2019. These services are worked by upgraded emus. Other new routes to be added include New Delhi – Katra (615km) to carry pilgrims to the Vaishno Devi Shrine and Mumbai Central – Ahmedabad (starting in December 2019).\n\nNEPAL Feasibility studies are to take place into a rail link between the Chinese network, through Nepal, and south across the open Nepal:India border. China has invested significantly in improving the infrastructure of Nepal so that Nepal will become “land linked” rather than “land locked”.\n\nTHAILAND Government plans to build a 220km high-speed (250 km/hour) line linking the three airports in Greater Bangkok have fallen apart as the Board of the State Railways has resigned making it impossible to sign the contracts to allow land acquisition to commence. The Bangkok Metro Blue Line was extended from Bang Wa to Lak Song on 21 September 2019. The first two of the twenty five new Hitachi trains for the Red Line were shipped from Japan at the end of September 2019.\n\nINDONESIA The main line between Jakarta and Surabaya (710 km) is to be upgraded in two stages starting with Jakarta – Semarang (426 km) which will be completed by 2024. Work on the Semarang – Surabaya (284 km) will follow on immediately. The 1067mm track will be improved, several sections will be elevated, and all level crossings will be eliminated. The end-to-end journey time will be halved to 5 hours 30 minutes.\n\nJAPAN Automatic Train Operation is to be introduced on the 29.7km suburban section between Ayase and Toride. This stopping service runs on into the city centre on the Chiyoda Metro Line. Platform screen doors are to be erected. This is part of JR East’s “smart train” programme. Trials of automated trains took place on the circular Yamanote Line earlier this year. Eventually JR East will operate driverless trains on many similar routes. Super typhoon Hagibis bore down on Central Japan on 12/13 October 2019 causing major damage to structures. Deep flood waters covered highways and railways. A picture received quite widespread publicity showing a Tokaido high-speed train stationary in deep flood water. The Hokuriku Shinkansen and Chuo Main Line were both badly damaged by the typhoon and it will take several weeks to complete the repairs.\n\nCHINA – TAIWAN The State railway has ordered 34 locomotives from Stadler at a cost of $182m. This is the first major order by Stadler to any railway in the Pacific Region. The Danhai Light Rail Transit serves New Taipei with public services commencing on 24 December 2018. Taipei (pop 2.7m) is the capital and New Taipei (pop 4m) is a rapidly growing area more or less surrounding the capital. It contains the International Airport which is linked to the capital by a metro opened in 2017. There are plans to extend the system to the wharfs along the Tamsul River and perhaps across the river on a bridge shared with road traffic.\n\nCHINA There has been a great deal of activity in many Chinese cities as new light railways and extensions to existing systems are opened partly to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist State. In the capital BEIJING 88km of new lines were opened coinciding with the start of commercial flights at the new Daxing Airport on 26 September 2019. The Daxing Airport Express uses 41km of suburban metro branching off Metro line 10, and is served by twelve 8-car trains built by CRRC Qindao Sifang. The 47km high-speed line starting at Beijing West also opened on 26 September. Work is under way on building a 3.5km extension to Lize Business District opening in late 2020. Trial services started on a 34.2km north-south line in CHANGZHOU. A 19.9km extension is planned to open in 2021. In XUZHOU operation started on 28 September 2019 on a 22km east – west line which uses 23 6-car trains built by CRRC Nanjing. The same day saw a start of services in WENZHOU on the 19.1km Line S1 between Olympic Centre and Shouang’ou Avenue. In WUHAN, a regional capital, metro line 4 was extended by 16km on 25 September 2019 and is operated by 70 6-car trains built in two factories – CRRC Zhuzhou and CRRC Changchun. Line 1 in the ancient capital XI’AN was extended by 6km on 26 September, while in NINGBO line 3 was extended by 5.6km on 26 September. In WUXI line 1 grew by 5.2km on 28 September 2019. ZHENGZHOU, a provincial capital, limited services started on a 3.2km section of line 14 on 19 September and a further 4.3km will be added during 2020. In the southern major city of SHANGHAI CRRC Nanjing has delivered the first of 8-car metro trains for the 38.5km line 14 which is to open in late 2020. SHENZHEN metro line 5 was extended on 28 September to a length of 7.6km. Finally, the provincial capital CHENGDU has been given permission to extend its Metro to a massive 31 lines totalling1557 km.\n\nMACAU is a special Administrative Region of China, a former Portuguese colony, situated near Hong Kong. A new light rail line 9.3km long is almost ready to commence public services. It will connect the International Airport, the ferry terminal, the Casino, and the Lotus Bridge border check point with China.\n\n8 October 2019\n\nCHINA SHANGHAI The Songjiang light rail system in the south western suburbs of Shanghai was enlarged on 10 August 2019 by the opening of a 12.86 km extension from Zhongchen Road in the northern suburbs to North Sanxin Road in the south west suburbs. The new line forms part of route T2 which, with the extension, has become a circular route which takes 46 minutes for a complete journey. Route T2 interchanges with Metro Line 9 at two points. A 4.4km extension to route T1 in the north west suburbs will open during 2020 from Xinmiaosan to Xinqiao railway station. It is expected that up to 170,000 passengers will be carried every day on a fleet of just thirty Alstom five segment Citadis trams, assembled locally, and providing a service every ten minutes throughout the day. The Songjiang locality is growing rapidly and now has a population of 1.8 million. It has also one of the largest university campuses in China. The tramway has been operated by the Shanghai Shentong Metro Group – Keolis joint venture since the first section was opened on 26 December 2018 and the same joint venture Group has been selected to operate the 7.8km long light metro to Shanghai Pudong International Airport. This line will provide services using CRRC built 94m long automated trains.\n\nXUZHOU This is the latest Chinese city to open a new Metro to the Airport. The first metro line runs east – west between Xuzhou Dong Airport and Luwa (21.9 km) via the city centre and was opened on 28 September 2019. It uses a fleet of CRRC trains each of which can carry a remarkable 2146 tightly packed passengers.\n\nBEIJING The new Daxing Airport was opened on 26 September 2019 together with the 47km long high-speed railway to the city centre, and the 41km suburban metro feeding into orbital line 10 at Caoqiao station.\n\nNEW COAL LINE The 1813 km long Menghua coal railway was opened on 28 September 2019 running from the coal fields in the north of China to areas in the far south which uses the coal. Known also as the Haoji Railway the line is one of the few to run north – south rather than west – east to the coal exporting ports. The new railway intersects with many of the west – east lines making possible country-wide connections.\n\nCHINA – HONG KONG Violent protests from residents have disrupted the city over plans by the Hong Kong Government to make important changes to extradition laws. Following a night of especially severe riots it was decided that the Metro would not operate at all on Saturday 5 October 2019.\n\nSOUTH KOREA The 23.7km long driverless metro Gold Line was opened during late September 2019. Hyundai Rotem has supplied twenty three 2-car trains to operate the service.\n\nJAPAN The Nagoya Railway has updated its emu fleet with the introduction of four series 9500 emus on its 444 km long 1067mm route. Existing 3500 series emus will continue to see use but only on peak hour trains.\n\nRUSSIA Passenger trains have commenced running to the remote Siberian city of Yakutsk which is at the end of a 700 mile long branch from the Trans-Siberian Railway. The terminus, at Nizhny Bestyakh, is on the opposite bank of the Lena river which can be crossed by a ferry during the short summer. During most of the winter the temperature averages -35C and a connection links the city and station across the ice. Eventually a three kilometre bridge will be built across the river. Most passengers travelling the 3100 miles between Moscow and Yakutsk use a frequent air service.\n\nISRAEL The Jerusalem light rail line is to be extended by a CAF:Shapir Engineering consortium. The Red Line will be extended by 6.8km north to Neveh Ya’acov and south to Hadassah University Medical Center. A new 20.6km long Green Line will extend from Mount Scopus to Gilo and Malha. Branches will reach the Hebrew University Givat Ram Campus and Givat Shaul. CAF will provide 114 new low floor Urbos trams. In addition CAF will supply signalling, energy, depot, and communications systems and will upgrade the original 46 Alstom Citadis 302 trams. The Electra Infrastructures consortium has been selected to build civil engineering work on the planned 30km line between Rishon Le-Ziyyon and Modi’in which will mostly follow the median on Highway 431.\n\n6 September 2019\n\nCHINA – HONG KONG The rail link between the International Airport and the island city was halted on 1 September 2019 as very large numbers of protesters occupied stations along the line together with an adjacent shopping complex. This was the 13th weekend of protests disrupting the transport hub. The protesters object to new proposals that would legalise the extradition of someone from Hong Kong island to the adjacent mainland China.\n\nJAPAN A 75mph passenger service travelling between Yokohama and Tokyo hit a lorry loaded with lemons and oranges on 29 August 2019. The lorry burst into flames but remarkably there was only one fatality and 30 passengers with mostly minor injuries.\n\n28 August 2019\n\nINDIA On the Delhi Metro services on the Blue Line were halted for several hours after kites flown by local children became entangled in the overhead power wires. An electric locomotive built in the Chittaranjan Works has achieved a speed of 180 km/hour – officially the maximum speed allowed on the Indian Railways.\n\n5 August 2019\n\nTURKEY Construction has begun on a 8km extension to Ankara’s Başkentray suburban railway from Sincan to Yenikent. Services are expected to start in June 2022.\n\nINDIA A super-fast service is being introduced between Delhi and Katra, the location of the much visited Vaishno Devi Temple. At present a fast train takes 12 hours for the journey but the new Vande Bharat Express using a new set of luxury coaches cuts the travel time by four hours. Initially it runs three days per week leaving Delhi at 0600 on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays and reaching Katra after three intermediate stops at 1400. The return service leaves Katra at 1500 and arrives Delhi at 2300. Meanwhile extremely heavy rains caused extensive flooding in the Mumbai area. Over 1000 passengers were trapped on the Mahalami Express which became stuck in 2m of flood water some 40 miles from Mumbai. A rescue exercise involving helicopters and boats took eight hours to bring the passengers into Mumbai. The rescue teams started with the nine pregnant women on board, then other women and children, before collecting any disabled men and finally fit and able bodied men. Very heavy rains on 04 August 2019 caused the River Godavari to burst its banks and flood the Financial District. Train services were halted and hundreds were trapped in their offices.\n\nINDONESIA A blackout affected the island of Java on 4 August 2019 following weather related disruptions at the power plant. The new rapid transit system in Djakarta was evacuated.\n\nCHINA Six metro projects/extensions have been opened recently. In Lanzhou the 26km long Metro Line 1 was opened on 23 June 2019. In Hangzhou the first section of Metro Line 5 (17.8 km) was opened on 25 June 2019. The first 7km of Line 3 in Ningbo opened on 30 June 2019. An 11.9 km extension of Line 2 in Nanchang was also opened on 30 June 2019. The second phase of Line 1 in Shijizhuang, 13.5 km long, was opened on 26 June 2019. Finally, in Urumqi a 10.7 km extension of the only Metro line was opened on 28 June 2019.\n\n24 July 2019\n\nINDIA It was announced on 6 July 2019 that Indian Railways were to acquire the necessary technology to build aluminium bodied coaches that would be able to operate at a speed of 250 km/hour The Indian Government is investing in improvements to the infrastructure of the railways ranging from the track, signalling, and rolling stock to enable a shift from road to rail for much of the long distance passenger and freight markets. In major urban areas steps are being taken to provide commuter networks that can operate on separate tracks and therefore will not interfere with long distance services. A separate announcement concerned improvements to major stations over the next decade.\n\nTHAILAND The nation’s Mass Rapid Transit Authority has allocated an increased budget to build the 42km phase 1 of a light rail line between Chalong Circle in Phuket and the International Airport. Construction work is to begin in late 2020 with passenger services starting in 2024.\n\nPHILLIPINES Ground breaking for the construction of the 11.7km southern extension of Manila Metro Line 1 to Bacoor took place on 7 May 2019. Alstom will provide the signalling, communications system, power supply and track. Civil engineering work will be handled by local firm Bouyges, and CAF/Mitsubishi will build 30 LRVs. The line is planned to open by 2022.\n\nJAPAN News has come concerning the Kumamoto Electric Railway on Kyushu Island. Opened in 1911 as a three foot gauge steam worked line, it was regauged to 3’6” using 600 V DC electric power in 1923. The northern 13.5km section was closed in 1986 leaving the busier 9.7km in service together with a short branch to Kami Kumamoto where the trains connect with a JNR route. The “main line” operates through the densely populated community which is served by several handy halts.\n\nCHINA Alstom is to supply train control and traction systems for the 318 new cars to be used on the driverless Line 7 in Nanjing.\n\n6 July 2019\n\nUNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE) Stage One of the plan to build a 1200 km network across the nation – 264 km of railway between the port of Ruwais, east to Liwa Junction, then south to serve the oil and gas fields around Habshan and Shah. This was opened in December 2015 and is operated by a joint venture of Etihad Rail and DB Cargo. The China State Construction Engineering Corporation has won the contract to build the 139 km from near Ruwais to the Saudi border at Ghuwaifat where a connection will be established with Saudi Railways. Details of the planned line from Liwa Jct along the full length of UAE serving ports at Khalifa and Fujairah are being finalised together with a long-term plan for a link to the railways in Oman.\n\nINDIA The heaviest monsoon rains for a decade struck the Mumbai area on 2 July 2019 bringing down several structures and killing at least 18 people. Rail services around the city were disrupted due to flooding, and at least 100 flights at the city’s airport had to be cancelled. Studies for a high-speed railway running west from Chennai through Vellore to Bengaluru then south west to Mysuru (500km) would be built for operation at 350km/hour cutting the journey time from 7 hours to 2 hours. An hourly service would be improved to half hourly as traffic built up. This will serve the third most important economic region in India including Chennai (population 9m) and Bengaluru (8m). It is likely that the railway will be built to broad gauge (1676 mm) rather than standard gauge to maximise train capacity. The line would open in stages between 2028 and 2038 A branch service is suggested between Arakkonam, west of Chennai, north to Tirupati, a religious centre attracting 2 million pilgrims each month.\n\nCHINA China leads the way in the operation of the fastest passenger services in the world. The train pair G17 and G22 operating between Beijing Nan Station and Shanghai, 1307 km, take just 258 minutes with one intermediate stop – an average speed of 304 km/hour. Train G1 between Beijing Nan and Nanjing, 1021 km, achieves this in 204 minutes, an average speed of 300 km/hour. These are the only inter-city services in the world to operate at over 300 km/hour. Much higher speeds are in the sights of Government planners. The CRRC Group are being funded to develop a Maglev system capable of speeds of up to 600 km/hour. A test track has been built and two prototype vehicles were unveiled on 23 May 2019.\n\nJAPAN HIGH SPEED The East Japan Railway has begun test operations of its Alfa-X high speed experimental Shinkansen train. This train is expected to run between Tokyo and Sapporo when the Hokkaido Shinkansen opens in 2030. A trip time of 4.5 hours is planned and this will require higher speed limits on the Tohoku and Hokkaido Shinkansen. At the moment 98% of the traffic between Tokyo and Sapporo goes by air and to compete with this, rail services will need to operate at 320 km/hour. Initial test running has shown this to be easily achievable.\n\nJAPAN FLOODS One million people living in three cities on the island of Kyushu were ordered to leave their homes on 2 July 2019 because extremely heavy rains had resulted in a danger of mud slides and floods.\n\nSOUTH KOREA Woojin Industrial Systems is to supply 200 cars for Seoul Metro Line 5 and 136 cars for line 7.\n\n7 June 2019\n\nQATAR The driverless Red Line of the Doha Metro was opened on 08 May 2019. A branch to the Hamad International Airport will be in service before the end of 2019.\n\nINDIA Women are to be allowed to travel free on the city’s bus and metro networks. Attacks on women have become a disturbingly frequent crime in India and as a result many women have stopped using public transport. The “travel free” approach is a move to attract back women who will be able often to ride in “women only” services or coaches in the knowledge that men will no longer be able to assault them.\n\nBANGLADESH The 18.9 km line running north – south across the capital Dhaka is the first Metro line in the nation but is designated Line 6. This reflects plans for additional lines. Construction of Line 6 began in August 2017 and it will open in 2020.\n\nCHINA Driverless metros are becoming the way ahead for transport within the world’s megacities – especially in China. The first driverless metro opened in 1981 and there were in July 2016 55 fully automated lines in 37 cities world-wide totalling 803 route km. Important lines include the Beijing Airport Link (op 2008), Shanghai Line 10 (2010), and the Yanfang Line opened in Beijing in 2017. The city of Chegdu (in SW China) has a population of 15.9m and opened its first metro line in 2010. By the end of 2017 a further six lines had opened and a further seven lines are planned to open by the end of 2020. Alstom has developed the signalling system appropriate for automated lines and this is used on the lines listed above in Beijing and Shanghai. It has been installed also on the Hong Kong South Island line, the Singapore NE and Circle lines, and the Lausanne M2 line.\n\n22 May 2019\n\nINDIA Alstom has been awarded the contract to install a signalling and communications system on Mumbai Metro lines 2A, 2B, and 7. The new system will be based on the Urbalis ATO system.\n\nSINGAPORE The Land Transport Authority is to build a Metro train test centre at Tuas, close to the Tuas West Depot. It is proposed that facilities there will be robust enough for the Centre to take on major work including mid-life train refurbishment.\n\n16 April 2019\n\nJAPAN A new track connection between the Sagami Railway and JR East was opened on 28 March 2019 allowing the introduction of new services between the Sagami Railway and central Tokyo. The Sagami Railway is essentially a commuter/suburban railway serving suburbs of Yokohama.\n\n31 March 2019\n\nINDIA The fastest passenger trains in India are the nineteen pairs of “Rajdhani Express” trains that link Delhi with regional capitals. Rajdhani means “The Capital” in many Indian languages. The trains are given top priority above all other services. The first Rajdhani service left Howrah station in Kolkata on 03 March 1969 and its Golden Jubilee was marked with the train be-decked with flowers from end to end. In 1969 the 1450 km journey took 17 hours 20 minutes and this has been trimmed slightly to 17 hours exactly. The family of trains uses air-conditioned coaches, with three categories of sleeping car. The dining car used in the early years has been removed and food is taken to passengers throughout the train, the cost being included in the fare. The Delhi – Kolkata service runs daily each way leaving both terminals at 1655, and reaching the destination at 0955.\n\nINDIA DELHI METRO Fourteen 8-car air-conditioned trains are being built in China and will replace non-air conditioned stock on the busy north – south line. All rolling stock on the Delhi Metro is air conditioned.\n\nCHINA The Government is to invest in railway developments a record $125bn during 2019 – an increase of around 10% on what was originally planned. The largest development is the construction of 30,000 km of high-speed railway by the end of 2020. The network has already opened 10,000 km of high-speed railway at a cost much lower than in Europe or America. Many components are standardised so that items such as beams for viaducts can be produced in bulk and therefore at lower unit cost. Tunnel construction also follows a standard procedure to keep costs down. In a nation with an authoritarian attitude it is relatively easy to clear the right of way for a new railway since existing buildings can be emptied of people and demolished quickly without the need to pay inflated sums for the unwanted property.\n\nCHINA NEW LINE SUCCEEDS The high-speed railway between West Kowloon station in Hong Kong and Guangzhou via Shenzhen was opened on 23 September 2018 and West Kowloon station was used by 160,000 passengers during the first three days of operation. The new line has continued to build up traffic with the total now around 70,000 each weekday.\n\nCHINA The deepest (102m) and largest (36,000 square metres) high-speed station is to be built at Badaling close to the most visited section of the Great Wall in time for the 2022 Winter Olympics which will be held near Badaling. High-Speed services will operate from Beijing and Shanghai in connection with the Games.\n\nJAPAN The Kyushu Railway Company has operated a very special train on the island of Kyushu, the most southerly of the major islands in the Japanese archipelago, since October 2013. The “Seven Stars” train comprises seven coaches and carries no more than 30 passengers in extreme luxury. The accommodation is of the highest quality and is fitted out with top quality examples of Japanese art. There are twelve suites on the train each with private bathroom facilities and the train takes passengers on gentle relaxed 2 or 4 day journeys around Kyushu. Top quality cuisine is served by dedicated staff. For a fare of up to £10,000 per ticket the passenger will expect the highest level of service.\n\n14 March 2019\n\nINDIA The Government has approved the building of a test track 40 km long in Rajasthan which will enable much of the testing of new techniques to be done away from the main railway routes.\n\nMUMBAI MONORAIL The first section of the Mumbai Monorail, between Chembur and Wadala (where the Depot is sited) was opened in February 2014 but operations have been subject to breakdowns with hardly a day without an incident. The opening was delayed 15 times due to problems and should have happened in 2010. A start to building the second phase between Wadala and Jacob Circle took place during the first week of March 2019. When completed the line will be 191.5 km long. There are only ten rakes of carriages available and it will require perfect operation if a reasonable frequency can be sustained.\n\nSRI LANKA The Government has approved a proposed light rail line in the capital Colombo. The 17km long line would run from a transport hub at Colombo Fort to Malabe. There would be 16 stops and the line would open in 2025.\n\nCHINA A suburban heavy rail service commenced operation in the city of Wenzhou on 23 January 2019. The route is being extended to the east and a second suburban line 71km long is to be added once the first line has been completed.\n\nSOUTH KOREA The high-speed railway between Seoul (in the north west of the nation) and Daegu (in the south east) was opened in April 2004 and the route was extended to the major port of Busan (357km from Seoul) in 2010. A 4 hour 10 minute journey came down to 2 hours 18 minutes. The Honam HS line branches from the first route at Daejeon and runs South West to Gwangju and an extension to Mokpo is now being built and will serve Muan International Airport. A 2 hours 38 minute journey from Seoul to Gwangju has come down to 1 hour 30 minutes. A separate line runs east from Seoul to Gangneung (207km) on the east coast (207 km). A relatively high speed line links Seoul with Incheon Airport with trains running at up to 150km/hour\n\n3 March 2019\n\nINDIA The nation’s fastest train, the Indian designed and built Vanda Bharal Express, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Modi on 15 February 2019. The train reached 180km/hour during trials and travelled from Delhi to Varanasi. On the return trip the brakes jammed on bring the train to an abrupt stop. It is thought that it may have struck cattle that had wandered on to the right of way.\n\nCHINA The last section of the high-speed railway from the Chinese mainland to Hong Kong island was opened on 23 September 2018 completing the 2439 km long route between Beijing and Hong Kong. The route serves four major cities along the route including Wuhan before serving three stations within Hong Kong itself.\n\n14 February 2019\n\nSAUDI ARABIA Services are growing on the Haramain High-Speed railway with the introduction of services on Wednesdays from 13 February 2019. The 453km long route between Mecca and Medina calling en route at Jeddah and King Abdullah Economic City opened on 11 October 2018 with four return trips on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Most of the users are large parties visiting the holy cities and load factors on the trains have stabilised at 79%.\n\nINDIA Eleven coaches of the Jagbani – Anand express train heading for Delhi were derailed passing over a broken rail at Sadadai Buzung at 0330 on 3 January 2019. The line is operated by the East Central Railway. 8 passengers were killed and 37 injured.\n\nAll inter-city expresses are to be equipped with European style bio-toilets by July 2019. The move will cut the dangers of a spread of infections via waste material dumped from trains on to the tracks\n\nJAPAN Hitachi and Kawasaki are working together to design a passenger train capable of operating safely at up to 250 mph. They are tackling possible ways to reduce the noise made by a very fast train and on ways to reduce wind resistance. At present the top speed reached by existing trains is 200 mph and the noise generated by these trains is a major problem that will increase with greater speeds.\n\n1 February 2019\n\nINDIA Kolkata – At least two new tramway routes within two Kolkata townships, New Town, and Nabadiganta, are planned but new routes into the heart of the city are unlikely because they would have to be built along extremely busy roads that could not possibly be closed to allow construction. Many tram routes in the city have been closed and the former fleet of over 400 trams has been reduced to 85 but most of these have been rebuilt locally.\n\nDelhi – The 11 mile elevated section of Metro route 7 between Shiv Vivar Trilokpun and Sanjay Lake was opened 31 October 2019. A section of the route linking the two sections of Line 7 has not yet been completed.\n\nMumbai – A completely new fleet comprising 63 six-car trains has been ordered from BEML at their Bangalore factory. They will be delivered in 2020 – 2022 and will include a driverless capability. The stainless steel trains will be used on Metro Corridor 2A,2B, and 7.\n\nNagpur – The first of 23 CRRC three car metro sets was delivered in November 2018. They will be used on the north – south 19.7km long route which is the first of two routes planned for the city.\n\n7 January 2019\n\nCHINA Five sections of railway opened in widely scattered parts of the nation on 25 December 2018. The two most important are\n\n1. Harbin – Midanjung (293km) cutting the journey time between the cities from 4 hours 30 mins (by a rather roundabout route) to 1 hour 30 mins (by the new much more direct route).\n\n2. Hangzhou – Huangshan (287 km). This is a high-speed line designed for fast (250 km/hour) passenger traffic only. Much of the route is built on an elevated structure.\n\n26 December 2018\n\nTURKEY The high-speed train disaster involving a collision between a service bound for Konya with a locomotive involved with maintenance work, a derailment, and finally the destruction of a footbridge across the tracks left nine dead and 47 injured.\n\nUZBEKISTAN Photography in the metro in the capital Tashkent was banned until June 2018 because several of the stations are able to act as shelters if the city suffers a nuclear attack. The city reached a population of 1m in the early 1960s – a size requirement for a metro which would be paid for by Central Government. A major earthquake in 1966 resulted in early plans for a metro to be revised. The tunnels were to be less deep – often just below road level- and the tunnel and station walls were to be strengthened. Actual tunnel work began in 1971 and the metro opened in 1977. Very simple entrances from the street to the stations lead to the highly decorated stations themselves. The platforms are commendably wide and can cope with the numbers travelling at the peaks. Art works featuring Uzbek people, or the pioneers of space travel, or simply Uzbek style art and statuary are to be found in all of the stations. The Metro cars are very similar to those used in Moscow – i.e. seats along the sides of the coaches leaving plenty of standing room. The trains are rather noisy when they are moving.\n\nINDIA\n\nDELHI Two extensions to the Delhi Metro have opened recently. A 17.9 km long section of Line 7 (Pink Line) was opened on 31 October 2018. This is entirely on a elevated structure and is not yet connected to the earlier section of Line 7 although this part is expected to be completed in 2019. A short 3.2km long extension of Line 6 (Violet Line) opened on 19 November 2018. The Delhi Metro now extends for over 300 km.\n\nCALCUTTA Plans are advancing for the building of new tram routes in the old city and in outlying townships. There used to be an extensive network of routes but much of the system was closed in recent years largely because the equipment was run down and there were no funds to upgrade the system. The construction of the Metro resulted in roads being dug up and tramways not reopened after the work was completed. A small network remains and like anything that moves in this massive city traffic is extremely heavy. 250,000 passengers are carried each day and 85 trams remain in the fleet, a few of which have been modernised.\n\nBOMBAY Sixty three six-car metro trains have been ordered from BEML in Bangalore and will be delivered in 2020-23. They will include an ability to operate without a driver. I shudder at the thought of a driverless train negotiating Metro Corridor 2 and 7. People may understand that they have to keep away from the moving trains but cows (sacred), donkeys, and an assortment of other livestock are not so careful of themselves.\n\n13 December 2018\n\nTURKEY A high-speed train from the capital Ankara to Konya crashed into a engineering service at the suburban Marsendiz station, was derailed with two coaches left on their sides, and then struck a pedestrian bridge that crossed over the tracks. Nine people were killed, including the train driver and around 50 were injured.\n\n30 November 2018\n\nCHINA The high-speed network across China is the world’s longest and now links most areas of the vast nation. For the first time a route will pass below the open sea in a 16.2 km long tunnel. Running from Ningbo in Zhejiang province south of Shanghai the new line will run below Hangzhou Bay on its way to the Zhoushan, an archipelago off the east coast.\n\n12 November 2018\n\nSAUDI ARABIA Metro Line 4 in Riyadh is being built by the “FAST” consortium and this group has been awarded the contract to build an extension to the King Khalid International Airport.\n\nQATAR Kinki Sharyo is to supply a further 35 three-car driverless trains for the Doha metro.\n\nINDIA A prototype 16 coach emu labelled “Train 18” after the year in which it was built, is planned to enter service in January 2019 on the Delhi – Bhopal (707 km) route. In the medium term it is planned that “Made in India” trains costing about half of those imported from international firms will capture significant traffic between city pairs that are a moderate distance apart. The train has two “Executive” coaches each seating 56 and fourteen “non-executive” coaches with 3 + 2 seating for 74 passengers. A 17.3km south eastern extension to the Hyderabad Metro Red Line was opened on 24 September 2018. The new line connects with the Blue Line in the city centre.\n\nVIETNAM The first Metro Line in Hanoi commenced passenger-carrying tests on 20 September 2018. Initial frequencies of 10-12 minutes will fall progressively to 5 minutes and full normal operations will commence in mid 2019.\n\n31 October 2018\n\nISRAEL Passenger services started to operate between Ben Gurion Airport and Jerusalem via the new fast line on 25 September 2018. Although both tracks have been laid along the new fast line only one has overhead catenary with power at 25kV 50 Hz. The maximum speed allowed is initially 120 km/hour but the design speed of 160km/hour will be achieve once everything has settled down. Two trains per hour are operating on the 20 minute trip. The next step will be the extension of services from the Airport to Tel Aviv HaHagana with a journey time between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem of 30 minutes for the 57km.\n\nINDIA On 22 October 2018 an express train speeding round a curve approaching the station at Amritsar ploughed into a large crowd attending a religious festival. There were so many at the festival that they spilled across the tracks. At least 50 were killed and a further 90 injured. The organisers had not obtained permission for an event with so many present from numerous local agencies but had repeatedly warned attendees to keep clear of the tracks.\n\nMALAYSIA Construction of the 350 km long high-speed railway between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore has been delayed by up to five years while the Malaysian Government reconsiders its plans. A new Government was elected in May 2018 and feels that commitments to spend large sums must be reviewed. If Malaysia decides that the new railway cannot be afforded it will refund expenditure already made by the Singapore Government.\n\nCHINA On 23 September 2018 revenue services commenced on the high-speed line between Hong Kong and Shenzhen Bei (North). The first train was the “Vibrant Express” and carried 500 passengers. The route is being extended to Guangzhou where it will "
