        "text": "DEBATE ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS\n\nSPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER GOH CHOK TONG\n\nIN PARLIAMENT ON THURSDAY, 5 JUNE 1997\n\nSINGAPORE 21 - A NEW VISION FOR A NEW ERA\n\nPart 1\n\nPoints Of Agreement (POA)\n\nAnd Framework Of Wider Cooperation\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law has given us the background to the POA, and explained the difficulties in working the agreement. These difficulties are part of the reasons behind the current strain in Malaysia-Singapore relations.\n\nLet me first bring you back to June 1990. I told the House then (I was then Deputy Prime Minister) that I had asked Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to \"settle old accounts as I prefer to open a new era unfettered by old thinking\". By that, I meant settling outstanding issues like the railway land. I wanted a clean slate on which new relations free from historical and emotional baggage could be written.\n\nIt was for this reason that Mr Lee wrapped up the negotiations on the Malayan Railway land before he stepped down as Prime Minister. In fact, he signed the \"Points of Agreement on Malayan Railway Land in Singapore\" with the then Malaysian Finance Minister, Tun Daim Zainuddin, as his very last act in office on the day he retired as Prime Minister, i.e. 27 November 1990. He did so with my full support.\n\nThe POA provided for Singapore and Malaysia to set up a joint venture company, M-S Pte Ltd, to jointly develop three parcels of Malayan Railway land, in Tanjong Pagar, Kranji and Woodlands. Malaysia would have a 60% share, and Singapore 40%. We wanted Malaysia to have a significant long term stake in Singapore as this would give both sides an abiding interest in good bilateral relations, and in the prosperity and success of the other. The proposed high quality property developments by M-S Pte Ltd would give Malaysia such a stake.\n\nI subsequently learnt that Dr Mahathir was unhappy that the Malayan Railway land at Bukit Timah had not been included for joint development in the POA. But I could not simply set aside the POA.\n\nThe POA was a formal agreement between two countries that had been signed by Tun Daim and Mr Lee Kuan Yew on behalf of both Governments.\n\nMeeting on 28 Oct 91 in Harare\n\nAbout a year after the signing of the POA, I met Dr Mahathir in Harare in October 1991. That was when I had my first inkling of problems with the POA. Dr Mahathir stated that he would like to develop commercially the MRA land at Bukit Timah, something not provided for in the POA. His idea was to use the station and the railway track to Jurong for a few years. After that when the Bukit Timah railway station was no longer required, the station could be shifted to Woodlands. I suggested that it was commercially more viable to shift the railway station to Woodlands in one step instead of two steps. I added that we had decided to extend our MRT to Woodlands and if the railway station were to be built at Bukit Timah, it might have to re-locate to Woodlands in just a matter of years.\n\nMeeting on 6 Sep 94 in Langkawi\n\nThree years later, in September 1994, I called on Dr Mahathir in Langkawi. Again, he raised the commercial development of the Bukit Timah site. I replied that I could not deviate from the terms spelt out in the POA, which did not allow for the joint development of the Bukit Timah site. I said that it was clear from the POA that other than the three specified parcels, the Bukit Timah site and remaining Malayan Railway land would be returned to Singapore. I left that meeting disturbed and worried that things were not going right on the issue of Malayan Railway land. I gave considerable thought to ways to overcome the problem.\n\nMeeting on 2 Dec 95 in Singapore\n\nThe opportunity came when Dr Mahathir visited me in Singapore on 2 December 1995. He presented his vision of a fast inter-city electric train that would run from Singapore to Kunming. He wanted to keep the railway station at Tanjong Pagar.\n\nI was supportive of his proposal for a city to city fast train link.\n\nAll great cities in Europe are linked up by fast trains. Travelling by train from city to city is convenient and popular. A fast train link between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur would be an attractive and viable alternative to air and road travel.\n\nI gave Dr Mahathir my full support for his proposed electric train project. However, I explained that I had to act within the terms of the POA, which governed all issues affecting KTM land in Singapore. (KTM is the new corporate name for Malayan Railway.) I pointed out that the electric train service would require a variation of the POA.\n\nI further explained that I could overcome the political and legal difficulties of varying the POA only within a framework of wider cooperation between Singapore and Malaysia. I recalled his \"prosper-thy-neighbour\" philosophy and said that the framework could include Malaysia selling Singapore water for the long term, i.e. beyond 2061 when the second Water Agreement with Johor expires. My idea was that with a new water agreement, I would be able to overcome whatever difficulties posed by the POA for the electric train. I felt confident that this would enable me to convince my Cabinet, and later Parliament, to vary the terms of the POA to meet Malaysia's needs for the electric train.\n\nMeeting on 15 Dec 95 in Bangkok\n\nTwo weeks later, I met Dr Mahathir again on 15 December 1995 in Bangkok at the ASEAN Summit. At our bilateral meeting, I informed him that my Cabinet was supportive of the electric train proposal within a framework of wider cooperation.\n\nI proposed that this framework of wider cooperation could include a long term indefinite supply of water to Singapore. Once this was agreed upon, Malaysia could decide on the terminal point of the new railway in Singapore within its railway lands. The terminal point could be at Tanjong Pagar, as Dr Mahathir wanted. But should Malaysia decide to move the railway station from Tanjong Pagar to Woodlands, the Singapore Government, notwithstanding the terms of the POA, would agree to the joint development of KTM land in Bukit Timah, in addition to the agreed three parcels of land referred to in the POA. Dr Mahathir replied that he would look at this matter very closely.\n\nMeeting on 2 Mar 96 in Bangkok\n\nDr Mahathir and I next met in Bangkok on 2 March 1996.\n\nThe setting was the inaugural ASEM meeting. At our bilateral meeting, I emphasised that our cooperation on the electric train project and the long term supply of water would serve as two important symbols in bilateral relations. I told him candidly that although water was not an immediate issue for Singapore, an agreement by Malaysia to meet Singapore's long-term water needs beyond the life of the present water agreements would remove the perception in Singapore that water may be used as a leverage against Singapore. It would be a powerful signal that our two countries are embarking on a new era of co-operation. I explained that a new agreement on water would help me to overcome the political objections and the legal restrictions posed by the POA. However, I acknowledged that Malaysia had to ascertain first that it has enough water to meet its own long term requirements.\n\nI also used the opportunity to inform him that we could not allow the building of gantries or catenaries for the electric train. The Singapore Government had not allowed even its own MRT to build gantries above ground because they would be an eyesore in a city state like Singapore.\n\nPM's Letter to Dr Mahathir dated 18 Mar 96\n\nImmediately after our meeting, Dr Mahathir spoke to the Singapore and Malaysian press. He told them that Malaysia was ready to study how it could supply water to Singapore if it had enough to meet its own long term requirements. I wrote to Dr Mahathir on 18 March 1996 to follow up, and to express my appreciation for what he had told the press.\n\nDr Mahathir's Reply to PM dated 1 Apr 96\n\nIn his reply of 1 April 1996, Dr Mahathir assured me that Malaysia was prepared to supply Singapore with water if its water resources are in excess of its growing needs. He also said that he had instructed KTM to minimise the use of gantries and level crossings by using a third rail and either overhead or underground crossings. He recognised that this could increase costs but aesthetic considerations must be given every importance.\n\nMeeting on 24 Nov 96: A Fresh Approach\n\nWhen I next met Dr Mahathir during the APEC Leaders Summit in Manila on 24 November 1996, I reaffirmed that it was for him to decide if he wanted the train station for the new electric railway to remain in Tanjong Pagar. But I also suggested that Tanjong Pagar is not a suitable site for the fast electric train. The station at Tanjong Pagar is scruffy, hemmed in by a flyover and the container docks in front. There is limited room for expansion. More importantly, the city centre had already moved away from Tanjong Pagar. I proposed a fresh approach. I offered three alternative sites for the Tanjong Pagar train station and a new train route. These sites are at Newton, Suntec City/Marina Centre and Marina South. I felt that any of these three sites was superior to Tanjong Pagar. Dr Mahathir agreed to consider these three alternatives. The new train route would also free the 3 parcels of land under the POA plus the Bukit Timah land for joint development.\n\nPM's Letter to Dr Mahathir dated 21 Dec 96\n\nI wrote to Dr Mahathir on 21 December 1996 elaborating on the idea of alternative stations to Tanjong Pagar. I said that Singapore would contribute significantly to the cost of building the new infrastructure - the new station, a new train route - if it was better than the existing route - and the third rail in place of catenaries. Singapore would invest in the infrastructure for the Singapore sector to help make the fast train service financially viable.\n\nA group of Malaysian officials came to Singapore in February 1997 to view the three alternative sites.\n\nRecap of why we could not agree to\n\nMalaysia's proposed electric train project\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, to put things in perspective, let me explain why we could not agree to Malaysia's electric train project on the terms originally proposed:\n\nFirst, under the POA, both sides had agreed that Malayan Railway would vacate Tanjong Pagar. Therefore the proposal for the new electric train service to the station at Tanjong Pagar was inconsistent with the POA. Second, because electrification of the existing railway would mean extensive changes, the electric train service would amount to a new railway. Under the Railways Act, Parliament's approval has to be granted before the new train service can begin. Under Section 3 of the Railways Act, the Malaysians would first have to deposit their railway scheme with the Secretary to the Cabinet. The President, on the advice of the Cabinet, can then provisionally approve or reject the railway proposal. If the President approved, details of the scheme must be deposited with the Chief Surveyor for public inspection and objections within 3 months. Next, the plans and the objections, if any, have to be presented to Parliament and considered and approved or amended by Parliament. Third, the overhead catenary system proposed by the Malaysians is unsuitable for a densely built up city like Singapore. It is against our planning rules. The Singapore Government has spent millions of dollars to bury all our telephone and power cables underground. It has not allowed the Mass Rapid Transit and the Light Rail Transit to use overhead cables for aesthetic and safety reasons. The catenary system uses a very high voltage of 25,000 volts. This poses a safety risk and causes extensive electromagnetic interference in the surrounding areas. We had thus proposed the use of a third rail system which is visually less intrusive and allows for a smooth ride given the operating speeds here. I would like to add that for the same reasons, trains in Europe commonly use the catenary system in the countryside and switch to the third rail system in the city. Fourth, the Malaysian proposal as conveyed in writing by Malaysian officials actually described a commuter train from Tanjong Pagar to Kulai, with intermediate stops in Singapore, and not a high speed electric train from city centre in Singapore to city centre in Kuala Lumpur as envisaged by Dr Mahathir.\n\nConclusion on POA\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, the framework of wider cooperation I proposed to Dr Mahathir is designed to overcome the difficulties I had highlighted.\n\nI want good relations with Malaysia. I wish to be helpful. But it is not possible for me, or for any PM of Singapore, to simply set aside the POA which is an international agreement solemnly entered into between two Governments. To do so would undermine the sanctity of all the agreements and treaties Singapore has concluded in the past or will sign in the future. However, provided there is a framework of wider cooperation which includes long-term indefinite supply of water to Singapore, I believe I will have a convincing reason to carry my Cabinet colleagues, Parliament, and the people of Singapore, first, to vary the POA to meet Malaysia's requirements, and second, to invest in the Singapore sector of the infrastructure for the high speed train to help make the train service financially viable.\n\nI believe both countries have much to gain by working together for mutual benefit. I firmly believe that neighbours must live together in harmony and help each other to do better and improve the standard of living of their people. If Singapore and Malaysia can embark on a new era of cooperation, we will signal to the present and future generations that we have discarded the old historical and emotional baggage in favour of fruitful, mutually beneficial cooperation. Mr Chiam See Tong's proposal of an economic union with Malaysia is not as ridiculous as it sounds. He got his economic history of our Malaysia days wrong, and he has ignored important non-economic factors, but the economic logic of his proposal is correct.\n\nHowever, cooperation takes two willing parties. I do not think this is the right time to talk about an economic union when bilateral relations are strained and we are still having difficulties implementing specific items of cooperation.\n\nMr Speaker, Sir, Singapore and Malaysia share a symbiotic relationship. I fully subscribe to Dr Mahathir's philosophy of \"prosper-thy-neighbour\". It is an important way to strengthen our two countries' symbiotic relationship and help each other to become developed. The electric train, when it comes about, will be more than a physical connection; it will be a powerful symbol of the two countries' inter-connectedness on the fast track to success.\n\nI have another reason for telling the House the details of my discussion with Dr Mahathir on the POA and electric train. Whatever the present strains in our relationship, I support Dr Mahathir's vision of a fast train network connecting Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, and all the way to Kunming. I hope that the fast train service will succeed. But I need Malaysia's help to vary the terms of the POA so that the fast train can operate in Singapore. I have suggested how this can be done through a new framework of wider cooperation.\n\nI do not know at this stage when the new era of cooperation will come, or whether it will come. I hope it will come. I shall work for it.\n\nIf it materialises, I will have to come to Parliament to vary the terms of the POA, and seek your approval for the new electric railway line. I will also ask the House to support our investing in the Singapore sector of the infrastructure for the fast train service.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nPart II\n\nSingapore 21 - A Vision for a New Era\n\nNow, let me turn to Singapore 21 - our Vision for a new era.\n\n2 In January 1992, during the debate on the President's Address, I asked the House,\n\n\"To judge my Government not by what I say or can accomplish straight-away, but by what my Government will achieve at the end of its term of office. Edusave, independent schools, Medifund, home improvements - they need four to five years to show everyone what there is in it for them. If we go for short term, small benefits, and miss the long term, big benefits, we will lose our strategic way. This will spell ruin for Singapore.\"\n\n3 We went the full term. We delivered on our promises. The people gave their verdict. They liked our programme. That was the main reason for our success in the General Election, not the corny excuses given by Mr Jeyaretnam for his defeat.\n\n4 Today, I am again asking this House to take a long view, to look soberly into the future, weigh the strategic choices and make the right strategic decision. This House will lead Singapore into the next millennium. It has been self-renewed. It should be a future-oriented House, one with ideas, one which will deliver.\n\n5 We know one thing about the future.\n\n6 Globalisation will mean more intense competition. Many MPs have emphasised the need to sharpen our competitiveness to stay ahead. The Information Technology revolution will speed up the process of change itself. We must keep on learning and be quick to adapt to changes.\n\n7 But there are many things in the future we do not know, and cannot possibly foresee. Twenty years ago, as a young MP, I had no idea that Information Technology would so change the way we live, or that Communism would collapse in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe so abruptly and benignly. Given that changes will be even more rapid and drastic in the future, what kind of a world will we live in in 20 years' time?\n\n8 How do we prepare Singaporeans for this unknown future?\n\n9 First, we need to understand, as far as we can, the nature of the game unfolding. Second, Singaporeans must have a goal to chase and a vision to carry this country forward.\n\nChallenges\n\n10 Let me talk first about the basic challenges facing every country, developed and developing, and then the challenges facing Singapore in particular.\n\n11 All countries face a dual challenge. First is the economic challenge to maintain growth, create good jobs, and attract investments. All countries have to cope with an increasingly integrated and competitive world. To do well, their societies must motivate and reward risk-takers and entrepreneurs, the highly skilled and the more able.\n\n12 Second is the social challenge to maintain social cohesion and to manage growing income differences between the highly educated and skilled and those who are less skilled and less mobile. The fast pace of technological change, coupled with the mobility of investments across international borders will mean constant change in a country's socio-economic structure. Industries will boom and bust. Companies will migrate or down-size. This will cause insecurity and social turbulence. Governments will come under pressure. Thus France has lurched from Left to Right and Right to Left, all within five years.\n\n13 All countries will have to balance these two imperatives: economic competitiveness and social cohesion. Many developed countries are finding this balancing act very difficult. While the OECD countries are leaders in the knowledge-intensive industries, many are also experiencing uneven or declining education standards, high unemployment and social tension, especially in Europe. Growing juvenile crime, racial tensions, structural unemployment, job insecurity, an unsustainable state welfare burden, and loss of confidence in the future are straining their social fabric.\n\n14 The experience of the developed countries holds lessons for us. They suggest the kinds of problems we may face in the future. Social divisions are not a major problem for Singapore today. But divisions may grow as our society matures and income gaps widen. We need to nip these issues in the bud.\n\n15 The most pressing challenge facing Singapore today is to retain our competitive edge. Keen regional competitors are breathing down our neck. Our neighbours are aggressively upgrading their infrastructure. They are directly competing with our traditional economic strongholds, our port and airport. They are also seeking niches in the new knowledge-based industries, like Information Technology.\n\n16 Our neighbours have the advantages of cheaper land and abundant labour, and the pull of larger domestic markets. They can copy successful strategies and acquire the latest technologies. But we still have the competitive edge of a better trained and disciplined workforce, higher productivity, and a more conducive total business environment.\n\n17 We can meet the regional competition. But merely outperforming our neighbours is not good enough, nor is it our goal. There is a bigger arena and a bigger game in play.\n\n18 Winning the Malaysia Cup or even the SEA Games championship may make us the best in the region, but we are still nobody in the world. Increasingly, Singapore will have to compete with both developed and developing countries for talent and investment. We are not only competing with Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Shanghai or Taiwan for investments but also Seattle, Atlanta, Dublin and Sydney. Unless we can develop into a world-class city, with capabilities equal to the best anywhere, we are just a tiny speck on the world map. We have to make it to the World Cup finals.\n\n19 Besides economic competition, Singapore faces a far more fundamental challenge: rooting our best and brightest in this country. A recent survey by MasterCard found that 1 in 5 Singaporeans wishes to emigrate, despite Singapore's economic success. I am not sure how much to believe this survey, but there is enough anecdotal evidence to suggest a potential problem. Choo Wee Khiang tells me that a friend of his was dismayed and shocked that his 15-year old daughter had talked to him about emigrating. So our key challenge is to build ties among the people and emotional bonds to this country. Deepening our sense of belonging will be a priority in this term of my Government.\n\nResponse\n\n20 How should we respond?\n\n21 We can continue as we are, pursuing our current strategies, perhaps with some minor course corrections, hoping that National Education will grow a stronger sense of national identity. If we do this, it is quite likely that we will enjoy several more good years.\n\n22 But what if we should suffer an external shock and run into economic difficulties? Who would have anticipated the current strain in relations with Malaysia, a year or even six months ago? What will hold Singaporeans here? Affluence and prosperity cannot be the only glue holding us together. If Singaporeans are just economic animals, materialistic with no sense of belonging, they will be like migratory birds, seeking their fortunes in other lands when the season changes. They will have no cause to fight for, no community to live for, no country to defend and die for, only the pragmatic desire to get on and get rich. If it ever comes to this, Singapore will not survive as a sovereign nation.\n\n23 To meet this problem, and other challenges now unknown, it will not do just to make minor course corrections, small improvements to a generally working model. We need a new vision for Singapore, an ideal, a fresh mindset. We need to move beyond material progress, to a society which places people at its very centre. Singapore 21 is my team's vision for the future of Singapore, a Singapore where people make the difference, where each citizen is valued, a Singapore which is Our Best Home, an ideal home which we will all help to build.\n\n24 Singapore 21 is about what the people of Singapore want to make of this country. More than a house, Singapore must be a home. The Government can provide the conditions for security and economic growth. But in the end, it is people who give feeling, the human touch, the sense of pride and achievement, the warmth. So beyond developing physical infrastructure and hardware, we need to develop our social infrastructure and software. In Sony corporation, they call this \"heartware\". We need to go beyond economic and material needs, and reorient society to meet the intellectual, emotional, spiritual, cultural and social needs of our people.\n\n25 Our concept of competitiveness must therefore recognise that the robust and successful societies of the future will be those which place people at the centre. Countries and societies which can develop and mobilise their people, and serve the human needs, goals and aspirations of their citizens will have a lasting edge. Singapore must be such a society.\n\nTowards Singapore 21\n\n26 There are several elements that I believe we need to adopt to achieve this.\n\nBeyond Top Talent - Value and Develop People at all Levels\n\n27 In a global, knowledge-based economy, countries which attract and mobilise human talent will thrive. We have to continue to draw in talent, but we must also continue to invest heavily in the education and training of our own people. We aim to maximise the talents and abilities of all Singaporeans, not just the best and brightest, but every individual.\n\n28 Not everyone is equally talented. But every person has some useful ability. Our education system must therefore not only groom our top talent, but also recognise and develop a range of skills and abilities at every level. We have begun to move in this direction.\n\n29 Not everyone can perform equally well. But every person who tries his best should have his contribution recognised. Our attitude should not be that only a few people at the top add value, while the rest only run the machinery. Every Singaporean has a contribution to make to his job, his company, his community and his country. But equally, he has a responsibility to keep himself employable and productive through continuous learning, and to play his part to the best of his ability.\n\n30 This does not mean moving away from meritocracy. We must always give the ablest and most committed the scope and the support to develop to their full potential, so that they can contribute their maximum to society. But we must also develop all Singaporeans to their full potential. Countries with a larger population can afford to use their human resources less efficiently. But Singapore's talent pool is so small that we cannot afford any human wastage. Our system must not focus primarily on developing our top talent, but must value and develop people at all levels.\n\nBeyond the Drive to Succeed - Passion for What We Do\n\n31 Singapore was built by hard-working people who had the drive and determination to succeed. We must not let this work ethic weaken. But beyond the drive to get ahead, we must cultivate a sense of pride in our work and a passion for what we do. Many Americans have this quality. They have an intense interest and passion for whatever field they are in, which drives them to develop true expertise and to push the frontiers of their field. This quality has made them world leaders in many new technologies and disciplines. This is what R&D and innovation are about - people who pursue their interests and ideas with a passion, people prepared to be different from others - because they are thinking of new things. We must foster this sense of passion, this pride in work, both in the schools and in the workplace. So beyond the drive to succeed, we must have passion for what we do.\n\nBeyond Success - A Sense of Service\n\n32 The Government has shared the fruits of growth with all Singaporeans, and will continue to do so. But beyond our efforts to improve the lives of all Singaporeans, my hope is that Singapore will become a society where every citizen not only strives to get ahead, but also feels a responsibility to share success. Many of our founding fathers, like Tan Tock Seng, Lee Kong Chian, Govindasamy Pillai (a founder member of the Ramakrishnan Mission), and Haji Ambo Sooloh (a Bugis merchant and philanthropist), used their wealth to benefit others, not to flaunt their success or for personal glory, but out of a deep sense of responsibility to their community. They built schools and hospitals, and helped the needy and the weak.\n\n33 We must keep this noble tradition alive. Beyond donating to charity, every Singaporean, no matter what his station in life, can do something to help others and his community, whether through voluntary welfare organisations, or simply by getting involved in community work in his neighbourhood.\n\n34 Not all well-off Singaporeans contribute to charities. Some feel that by paying taxes, they are already subsidising the poor and needy. But paying tax is the legal obligation of every citizen. It is not philanthropy. It offers nothing extra for the community. We need to change the mindset of such people, to get them to feel that they owe a social responsibility to others for their success and affluence.\n\nBeyond Tolerance - Respect and Gain Strength from Diversity\n\n35 In many societies, race, language or religion will take on increasing importance either as a rallying cry or as an anchor in an uncertain and fast changing world. Look at the divisions Pauline Hanson has generated in Australia. But Singapore is a multi-cultural, multi-religious society. So we must distinguish ourselves as a society where the different races respect and accept one another, and the majority makes room for the minority to succeed. Everyone, Singaporeans and visitors alike, regardless of their cultural or religious background, should feel comfortable in Singapore.\n\n36 But while recognising and celebrating the importance of each community's heritage, our shared national identity must come before our cultures of origin. As our pledge reminds us, first and foremost we must be Singaporeans, one united people regardless of race, language or religion. And we must guard against individuals or institutions which would stir up religious or racial divisions in society.\n\n37 As a society we must be willing to respect and accept a greater diversity in ideas. Why do some societies, like the US, produce more ideas and innovation than others? Education systems have something to do with it. But the broader social environment is critical in supporting creativity and innovation, whether in the arts, sciences, research, industry or politics.\n\n38 We have to move beyond tolerance, to respect the different cultures in our midst, and to gain strength from diverse ideas. But there must be individual responsibility and a sense of accountability to the broader community. Rights and duties are inseparable, two sides of the same coin. This is the way to become a cosmopolitan, creative and cultivated society, which attracts top talent from all over the world.\n\nBeyond Leadership - Civil Participation\n\n39 Outstanding leadership and sound government will always be crucial. The government has to provide the best conditions for security and economic growth. Yet leadership and government will not be enough. We need a civil society to mobilise our people's energies and talents, and to create a cohesive and resilient nation. When people participate actively and become involved in community and national issues, they build ties among themselves and bond to the country.\n\n40 We must change the mindset that only a few leaders at the top of the system need to think and take responsibility for social and national issues, while the rest of society can simply mind their own business and go about their daily lives. All Singaporeans must feel a responsibility for solving local issues and shaping their own communities. They should not wait for the Government to solve every problem. The Government itself must be prepared to take a step back and perhaps even a back seat, especially on local community issues, and allow some free play to develop.\n\n41 One good way to do this is for concerned citizens to get involved in voluntary work or in the running of their own local communities, through the Town Councils, CDCs or RCs. Singapore's political life must evolve in the direction of greater participation by the people, more willingness to shoulder responsibilities, and more giving to the country than taking.\n\nConclusion\n\n42 In future the competitive advantage of nations will lie in their people - how a society is organised to maximise and mobilise the potential of its people, and how it serves the material, spiritual, intellectual, political, social and emotional needs of its citizenry. The ideas I have put forward are to develop a cohesive and resilient nation, a people fully equipped to compete in the future and a people with emotional stakes in Singapore.\n\n43 Singapore 21 will help us to pre-empt the problems faced by many developed countries today as they try and maintain economic dynamism while managing growing social divisions. We should focus on building capabilities, resilience, and \"heartware\" for the future, rather than just going for growth and trying to reach developed country status.\n\n44 To work through these ideas will require fundamental changes in our approach. We need time to build a consensus about the need for such a change of course, and to work out what exactly the new course should be. We are already taking major initiatives in education. The public sector is actively thinking for the future, preparing for scenarios which we hope to avoid but which we must be ready to cope with.\n\n45 But this is only half the story. The other half depends on Singaporeans feeling a responsibility to contribute their ideas, and committing themselves to participate actively in their communities and in national life to make our vision of a best home a reality.\n\n46 Singapore is about people. It is only in Singapore that we, as Singaporeans, have the freedom to build the kind of environment we want to live in, work and bring up our children. That is what being an independent, sovereign nation means. In no other country will we have the same opportunity to shape a country we can be proud of. I hope that Singaporeans from all walks of life will rise to the challenge and make the difference, for Singapore and for your children.\n\n47 Singapore 21 is about a Home for a People, not a hotel. A Home where we feel comfortable with ourselves, where we look after one another, where everyone makes the country succeed. Our vision for Singapore is not houses of bricks and mortar, but homes with hearts and dreams. People who feel confident and secure. People who believe in Singapore and its future. Let's work together to make Ours the Best Home, for ourselves and our children.\n\n__________"
