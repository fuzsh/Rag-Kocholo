        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n1.1. Manifestation of railway renaissance\n\nFrom their origin in the Industrial Revolution, first-generation railways grew to dominate land transport, ultimately peaking in the late 1940s. Thereafter, they declined in the face of disruptive competition from other transport modes that had flourished on the momentum of the World War II technology boom. Why did rail not get onto the same bandwagon? By then most countries had either nationalised or regulated their railways, to restrain their monopolistic power, and they had become too unresponsive to technology and market opportunities to get in on the action.\n\nNevertheless, railways have experienced renaissance in an increasing number of countries in recent decades. The authors have researched the associated phenomena, and published their findings in [1–7]. This chapter continues that research stream, and addresses two additional considerations that have arisen since it started, namely, the transition from finite to renewable energy sources, and the revival of the rail mode's developmental role in economic geography. While the image of global railway renaissance originally appeared pixelated, every incremental investment in one of the four market spaces where railways can compete vigorously has increased the resolution and clarity to a level where it is appropriate to once again review achievements and reflect on prospects for the future.\n\nRailways manifest renaissance by having exploited their three genetic technologies, supporting (the ability to carry heavy loads), guiding (the ability to travel at high speed), and coupling (the ability to connect many vehicles together), that set them apart from other transport modes. The three genetic technologies and the four market spaces that they support, namely high speed (passenger), heavy haul, heavy intermodal and urban rail, have been described in detail in [1–4, 6], so this chapter will only recapitulate as necessary to introduce its content. Together, they have turned railways around from grave decline and set them on new growth curves in each of the four market spaces mentioned. They have realised new opportunities by taking markets away from air over medium distances, from road and maritime transcontinental and intercontinental container movements, and created new markets in rampant urban rail.\n\n1.2. Rail's inherent strengths\n\nRail's inherent strengths have been explained before in the references mentioned in subsection 1.1. What follows is, therefore, a brief recapitulation with emphasis on subsequent learning.\n\nBy comparison with other transport modes, such as air that offers three degrees of freedom of movement (longitudinal, lateral, and vertical) at relatively high cost, and road that offers two degrees of freedom of movement (longitudinal and lateral) at moderate cost, the rail mode is constrained to a single degree of freedom of movement (longitudinal) by its guideway, back and forth on a predetermined, inflexible route. To compete effectively against transport modes that take advantage of more degrees of freedom of movement to get closer to the ideal of ubiquitous access, railways must offer compensating advantages. Fortunately, a guideway endows railways with three genetic technologies that at once distinguish it from, and offer advantages over, all other transport modes. The rail mode's inherent competitiveness resides in its genetic technologies, and it must draw on them for competiveness and sustainability in the aggressive global logistics and mobility markets.\n\nA pair of flanged wheels on an axle running on a pair of rails fixed to the ground precisely defines the spatial relation between rail and wheel. The three genetic technologies that stem from this relation are first, the supporting genetic technology, or the ability to carry heavy loads. The application path of the wheel load to the rail is precisely known and it is therefore possible to design the wheel-rail system to carry much heavier axle loads than can road vehicles. The highest heavy haul railway axle load in current operation is 40 tonnes in the Australian Pilbara, with aspirations to 42 tonnes. By contrast, vehicles on the rail mode's major land transport competitor, road, are driven autonomously; one cannot define the application path of the wheel load to the road precisely, but must design the entire road surface to accept the applied load. Consideration of economic relations among the amount of traffic and capital and maintenance expenditure has converged permissible road vehicle axle loads in the 8–9 tonne range around the world. Interestingly, where one can define the vehicle path more precisely and design the road structure accordingly, higher axle loads are possible: Thus, bus rapid transit axle loads can go as high as 12½ tonnes on specially designed runways. What about maritime transport, also a form of surface transport that can carry heavy loads? Vessels displace their own mass of water, hence their draught increases in proportion to their mass until buoyancy and deadweight forces are in equilibrium. Thus, while their cargo deadweight might be several times higher than the payload of a heavy haul train, they are nevertheless also subject to physical constraints such as limited draught, while hull drag in a medium more viscous than air incurs higher energy consumption than railways except at very low speeds, but more on that in the next section.\n\nSecond, the guiding genetic technology endows ability to travel at high speed. Once again, by contrast to its major land transport competitor, railway vehicles are precisely guided by wheel-rail forces, and can therefore safely attain much higher speeds than road vehicles that are still generally guided by humans exercising control through road-to-tyre friction forces. Freight and passenger vehicles are generally limited to no more than 120 km/h on public roads, whereas entry level on standard gauge track is 160 km/h with the ultimate maximum commercial service currently at 380 km/h. Railways can therefore generally service destinations faster and further than road, and at medium distances can also offer credible competition to aviation.\n\nThird, the coupling genetic technology endows the ability to connect multiple individual vehicles to deliver high freight and/or passenger throughput capacity. The rail mode is therefore able to scale capacity to match demand within wide limits. For comparison, the number of trailers in Australia's commercial road trains is expressed by only a single digit; the number of barges in a single tow on the Mississippi river may be expressed by two digits; but no transport mode other than rail expresses its vehicle combinations by three digits, as for example South Africa's Sishen-Saldanha iron ore trains at 342 wagons, currently the longest in the world, and many other three-digit heavy haul train lengths around the world. For passenger traffic, coupling railway vehicles together essentially reduces the headway between them to zero. Thus, for example, single railway cars carrying say 200 passengers at two-minute headway would carry 6,000 passengers per hour per direction. Coupling ten of them together in a multiple unit train increases throughput to nearly\n\nIncreasing the number of cars on a train increases its length, and hence the time it takes to clear signals for a following train. Capacity therefore scales at slightly less than in direct proportion to the number of cars.\n\n60,000 passengers per hour per direction on the same infrastructure. Other modes do not support this magnitude of capacity scalability, while some modes do not scale at all, for example, aviation.\n\nAfter a post World War II pessimistic interlude, during which sceptics questioned the rail mode's future and many stakeholders lost faith in it, optimism returned when appreciation of its genetic technologies stimulated vigorous new growth curves, in high-speed intercity starting in 1964 in Japan; heavy haul when mineral railways around the world recognised North American heavy freight standards in 1972; heavy intermodal or container double stacking when railroad deregulation in the United States released pent-up competitive forces in 1980;, and contemporary urban rail spontaneously around the world from the start of economic globalisation in 1989. These events are widely acknowledged as having launched a global railway renaissance that would position the mode as inherently competitive against other modes in high-volume corridors.\n\n1.3. Energy's vital role\n\nAlthough rail is known to be an energy-efficient transport mode, it is nevertheless valuable to contextualise this attribute to develop an appreciation of what role railways should fulfil in an energy-scarce future.\n\nRail's energy efficiency essentially spins off from its genetic technologies. The supporting genetic technology requires a strong wheel-to-guideway interface to sustain heavy axle loads, and rail's steel-on-steel system provides just that. The wheel and rail deflect minimally to develop a small contact patch between them, and steel-wheel-on-steel-rail rolling resistance and associated energy consumption, is therefore very low. By contrast, a rubber pneumatic tyre on a road deflects much more to develop a contact patch sufficiently large to sustain the load, which increases rolling resistance by comparison with rail and hence also the associated energy consumption.\n\nThe guiding genetic technology supports high speed, which in turn allows more potential energy to be converted to kinetic energy and vice versa by widening a train's actual speed range over undulating grades, thereby reducing both energy consumed during traction and energy dissipated during braking. High speed also reduces journey times, and hence reduces the period during which auxiliary services such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, and catering must operate. Consequently, high speed passenger trains actually consume less energy per passenger for a given journey than conventional passenger trains [8].\n\nThe coupling genetic technology averages grades under a long train, thereby reducing traction energy input and braking energy dissipation by comparison with a short train, particularly for heavy freight trains that are limited to comparatively low speed, which in turn limits the acceptable speed variation range over crests and sags and hence also the quantum of kinetic energy that can be converted to potential energy and vice versa. Coupling also reduces aerodynamic resistance because the frontal area of a train in relation to its length is small compared to any other transport mode; for example, the ratio of the frontal area to vehicle length for a TGV Duplex train is one-tenth that of an Airbus 380 aircraft, both double deckers.\n\nThe rail mode, therefore, occupies an energy consumption sweet spot that other transport modes cannot match. All other things being equal, propulsion energy consumption is a function of total resistance to motion, whether due to aerodynamic, hydrodynamic or mechanical phenomena, and speed. Railways essentially undercut the resistance to motion, expressed in Newtons per tonne, of all other transport modes. Relative to pipeline, railways have lower resistance from speeds higher than ≈3 km/h. Relative to maritime in displacement mode where resistance rises exponentially with speed, railways have lower resistance from speeds higher than ≈20 knots (≈40 km/h). In addition to being faster, railway routes can also be materially shorter, for example Beijing to Athens Piraeus is 8,500 km overland, but 16,000 km by sea. In the same way that high speed trains consume less energy because the journey time is shorter, freight trains consume less energy when the journey distance is shorter. Relative to road trucks, railways always have lower resistance, ≈50% at low speed, increasing to ≈80% at 100 km/h [9]. Relative to aviation, railways always have lower resistance, although it cannot match aviation's top speed. Nevertheless, railways can be attractive even on relatively long centre-city to centre-city journey times, e.g., the fastest current Beijing to Wuhan schedule averages 285 km/h over 1,229 km, a performance that aviation would be hard put to beat when accounting for time to commute to the airport, check in, check security, reclaim baggage, and commute to destination in addition to the scheduled flying time.\n\nRelatively low braking and traction adhesion inhere in the rail mode's steel-wheel-on-steel-rail technology. Whereas contemporary high-performance passenger trains use a high proportion of motored axles and therefore accept comparatively steep grades despite low adhesion, exploiting the coupling genetic technology with locomotive-hauled trains, freight or passenger, results in heavy trailing loads that generally require comparatively flatter grades than rubber-on-road technology to balance braking or tractive effort against total resistance and gravity component. The flatter a ruling grade, the more long-wave topography influences it and the longer the distance between grade sign changes. Thus, in a given terrain, railway grades tend to be longer and flatter than road grades. Where the downgrade gravity component exceeds mechanical plus aerodynamic resistance, any vehicle generates instantaneously surplus energy, which needs to be dissipated or stored on board, or exported to where it can be consumed or stored. Road vehicles, singly or even in combination, have higher aerodynamic resistance than long trains, so on their comparatively short down grades they generate less instantaneously surplus energy to be stored, and hybrid road vehicles with on-board energy storage have become workable. However, current on-board storage technologies are totally inadequate for line-haul railways, particularly for heavy haul but also for heavy intermodal with its progressively higher rolling resistance: Therefore such trains need to dissipate instantaneously surplus energy on board, or conduct it off-board for consumption or storage elsewhere [5, 7].\n\nBecause railway rolling resistance is very low, its instantaneous traction and braking power requirements are largely determined by grade undulations. The resultant wide swings between demand and regeneration make it desirable to exchange energy in both directions with its environment. Railways and renewable energy are thus natural symbionts, particularly when railways are linked to a sizeable grid that can also store instantaneously surplus energy when necessary. Railways can then both consume and regenerate energy without restraint. For scale, locomotives and wind-turbines are of similar size, in the range of 2½–6 MW. While electrification infrastructure is an expensive way for railways to exchange energy with their environments, guided transport in general has the advantage that electrification need be confined only to routes defined by the guideway. Hence the emergence of inductive recharging of catenary-free light rail vehicle batteries or capacitors during dwell time halts.\n\nIt is common cause that railways are more energy efficient than other land transport modes, and at the higher speeds of which it is capable, it is also more energy efficient than waterborne transport. Nevertheless, since the first major oil crisis four decades ago, despite technological progress, potential for cost-effective energy efficiency improvements and policy efforts, the transport system has not fundamentally changed [10]. Nevertheless, recently published research has found that despite technological advances, there are still situations where freight railways do not achieve the best energy efficiency that they can [7]. Thus, while heavy freight baseline diesel traction uses comparatively expensive, but nevertheless available fuel, holds no systemic interaction surprises, and readily scales throughput, electric traction can decouple railways from on board power generation and facilitate access to other electricity generators and consumers. However, to realise its full potential, electric traction would require matching vertical alignment to locomotive performance characteristics: providing graduated release train braking; providing catenary, transformers, and feeder lines; providing high-capacity, low-latency, long-lived energy storage; and implementing net metering to render transactions transparent. Where a smart grid is within reach, the storage should come with that, and renewable energy would likely be available. There is still some way to go.\n\n1.4. Rail's developmental role\n\nWhen railways dominated land transport during their initial growth phase, they shaped the development of countries and continents, peaking in that role around mid-20th century. Thereafter, road and air transport together came to own the market until high speed railways commenced new growth in the 1960s, heavy haul in the 1970s, heavy intermodal or double stacking in the 1980s, and finally contemporary urban rail in the 1990s, thus establishing the four sub-modes of the railway renaissance. Railways in renaissance offer high capacity with high efficiency and low cost in well-defined high traffic volume corridors. After changing the economic geographies of Japan and France by means of high speed trains, developing remote regions throughout the world by means of pit-to-port heavy haul operations, shifting substantial traffic from road to rail in double-stack container trains, and supporting rapid urban rail growth in developed and developing countries, it is evident that the rail mode is once more stimulating widely dispersed economic and social development through each of its four new growth curves.\n\nWhile the rail mode's initial growth phase spawned monolithic railways that introduced the first motorised transport ever with minimally differentiated offerings, renaissance has encouraged railways to do what they do best in particular market spaces in the face of strong competition from other modes. Renaissance rail is therefore always a high-capacity, high-performance transport mode in well defined corridors. Its initial investment is relatively expensive, and particularly, infrastructure needs therefore to be long lived. While it is possible to implement rail solutions in already highly developed settings, for example, deploying monorail in the air space above existing roadways as the only remaining option to introduce urban-guided transit, the rail's combination of high performance and low energy consumption are best exploited by positioning it as the foundation on which other transport modes should build to support integrated intermodal solutions. Thus, particular building-block solutions have emerged that spatial and transport planners can customise and assemble as required. Consider domestic and international airports connected to their catchment areas by urban, regional, and high speed rail; mixed-use, transit-oriented development that maximises both access to public transport and interchange with non-motorised transport; dedicated high-speed corridors that bring agglomeration benefits to otherwise disconnected communities and conurbations; logistics parks that add value to line-haul rail service through integration with intermodal facilities and distribution centres; dedicated heavy haul railways that link ore bodies with ports; and dedicated freight corridors that convey double-stacked containers from ports to their hinterland; all competitive, effective, and efficient solutions.\n\nRenaissance rail's contemporary developmental role is nowhere more evident than in the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries, which are playing an increasingly influential role in the global economy [11], and who are positioning railways as the backbone of their transport systems in fulfilment of projections that they will, in due course, join the world's major economies. This chapter will examine them and the Gulf Cooperation Council States in more detail in Section 3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The cases\n\n3.1. Brazil\n\nTo revitalise its freight railways, Brazil initially implemented reform-led intervention through long-term concessions (30 years renewable for another 30 years) on its freight railways in the mid-1990s. This resulted in vertically integrated concessions over a total of twelve regional freight railways, which have since grown traffic by 117% [12]. Heavy haul operations on both broad and narrow gauge, as well as general freight on broad gauge networks have flourished, attaining creditable densities of 81 million tonne-km/route-km for Vale's dedicated heavy haul operations, and 37 million tonne-km/route-km in heavy general freight. However, Brazil’s narrow gauge general freight railways achieve less than 2 million tonne-km/route-km [13]. It is therefore evident that the inherent competitiveness of Brazil’s narrow gauge general freight railways is low and that their performance falls short by comparison with its BRIC peers reviewed in the next three sections.\n\nLease income from concessions and taxes on concessionaires have become a source of revenue for the Brazilian government. However, investment in rail services other than heavy haul has been meagre, and notwithstanding its economic upswing, high logistics costs characterise Brazil. They are estimated at ≈20% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and thus double the average in OECD countries. The high costs are attributed to regional differences in the state of infrastructure, even though the organisation of the Brazilian transport sector has improved substantially since the 1990s. The national rail network lacks investments and modernisation, while high harbour fees further contribute to high logistics costs. The logistics sector is highly dependent on the highway network, transporting 60% of total freight volume.\n\nHowever, the network remains restricted, hindering economic growth. Although rail freight increased its logistics market share from 17% to 25% in 2013, the government would prefer a share above 50%. To achieve this, it envisages expanding the network from the present 30,000 km to 50,000–60,000 km [12]. Brazil, therefore, recently changed to an investment-led intervention, the Logistics Investment Program, a strategic project of the Brazilian State [14]. The primary intervention was to invest in railways, to raise their inherent competitiveness so that they can support economic development, and while elements of reform are still present, that is no longer the prime objective. It has connected its formerly isolated northern and southern broad gauge networks, albeit with breaks of gauge, by means of the new North-South Railway, which runs the length of the country. It is following up with two more priority freight rail projects of more than 1,000 km—the East-West line and the Trans-Northeastern Line—to open the interior of the country to development. Funding will partly be by public-private partnership (PPP), involving USD 121 billion over 30 years.\n\nImportantly, Brazil is changing the way the new railways will operate to break monopolies in provision of rail services. Instead of awarding a single concession to operate and maintain a railway, a concessionaire will construct and maintain a line, as well as control train movements on it for a period of 35 years. State agency VALEC will manage the demand risk through the government guaranteeing to purchase the full capacity and then on-selling access to the whole new rail network to private rail freight operators, with an individual operator able to purchase up to 30% of the capacity of a particular line. This unique development in the railway world is something to follow closely. Thus far, observers feel that the significant sunk costs of building or improving a railway seem to have deterred more private investment. The federal government has filled the gap and observers expect that continued government investment in railroads is needed in the long term. Nevertheless, the World Bank considers that several steps could improve private investment in railways, among them enhancing interconnectivity between railways—Brazil operates on different track gauges, and the sheer lack of physical interconnectivity between the lines slows return on investment [15].\n\nBrazil is working on a high speed railway in the Rio de Janeiro-São Paulo-Campinas corridor, to be implemented by PPP, although after two false starts, tendering has been postponed to give prospective bidders sufficient time to prepare. Rio de Janeiro-São Paulo is eighth on the list of the world's top 50 busiest passenger air routes. The envisaged concession period is 40 years, with commercial operation projected to start in 2020.\n\nBrazil's cities have benefited from renaissance in urban rail: Since it started in 1989, heavy metro, light rail and monorail projects have been under construction or completed in Brasilia, Fortaleza, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Santos, and São Paulo [13].\n\nBrazil has thus contemplated or implemented three of the four railway renaissance sub-modes, the outstanding one being heavy intermodal or double stacking. Loading gauge on some routes is restricted, and this state possibly reflects the concentration of heavy industry in the south and southeast of the country. Brazil is oil self-sufficient and insignificant routes are electrified outside urban areas.\n\n3.2. Russia\n\nThe Russian Federation is the sole shareholder in Russian Railways (RZD). It exploits its strategic location to take full advantage of its key geographical position by fully integrating the Russian railway system into the Eurasian transport network [16]. RZD's strategy for developing rail transport up to 2030 envisages significant expansion of the rail network in two stages.\n\nThe first stage involves modernisation from 2008 to 2015 to ensure necessary capacity on key routes, fundamental renewal and upgrading of existing infrastructure, and the beginning of planning and surveying work for expansion, as well as starting construction of some high-priority lines. Among the company’s top priorities were reconstruction and technical enhancement of existing main lines along with construction of new lines to remove infrastructural limitations to Russia's economic growth. RZD already operates high speed passenger trains in the upgraded St Petersburg–Moscow–Nizhny Novgorod corridor. The next focus was on the Baikal-Amur Main Line as an investment in Russia's future that will substantially increase transportation of oil products and exports to the East, a more intensive development and exploitation of raw materials in its Far Eastern region, and an increase in the line’s share of East-West transit traffic. The latter's catchment area stretches from China, South Korea, and Vietnam in the East, and to Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia in the West. A further priority was the construction of dedicated freight lines to tap natural resources and develop new industrial zones in Western Siberia. Around 13,800 route-km were upgraded for heavy axle loads to reduce the cost of bulk freight shipments.\n\nThe second stage from 2016 to 2030 will involve large-scale expansion, creating infrastructure to develop new economic growth areas across Russia's vast territory, deploying world-class technology and improving the competitiveness of the country’s rail system on the global market [17]. This includes the North-South International Transport Corridor in strategic partnership with countries to the south, initially India and Iran, while Belarus, Kazakhstan, Oman and Tajikistan have subsequently opted in, and requests to join from Syria, Azerbaijan and Armenia are under consideration [18]. It also includes ambitions to build a 104-km tunnel under the Bering Strait to connect the Asian and North American continents. The recent Ukraine imbroglio has, however, dampened Russia's ability and aspirations to network railways on continental and intercontinental scale. Hot off the press, in March 2015, RZD called for tenders to undertake surveys, project development, and route planning for the proposed 770-km Moscow–Kazan dedicated high speed line. One of the benefits Russia attributes to this high speed line is simply an increase in the country's prestige, since in the modern world no economically developed country will remain without a system of high-speed railways in the coming years.\n\nBecause of limits on State funding, RZD is financing its investment programme through PPPs, in the ratio 46% generated by RZD, 30% met by the private sector, 19.5% provided by the Russian Federation, and 4.5% from regional governments. Raising outside capital is done in accordance with the company’s Loan Programme, which provides for various instruments to finance its operations, including syndicated and bilateral loans, rouble bonds and Euro bonds, as well as leasing and others. Key focus objectives for RZD are the interests of shareholders and partners, as well as increasing efficiency and speed of management decision-making and improving transparency of the group’s activities [19].\n\nRZD was separated from ministry control in 2003 to become a public company responsible for operational and commercial functions. Separate daughter operating companies are being or have been set up for freight and passenger activities as a possible prelude to a sale of shares. It has commenced unbundling the former monolithic entity into, among others at time of writing, Eurosib, which runs container services linking Russia's ports with central Russia and Siberia; Federal Passenger Company, a subsidiary that manages long-distance passenger operations; Freight One, a subsidiary that offers cargo and intermodal shipment using its own fleet of hired wagons, and offers rolling stock leasing; Freight Two, a second freight subsidiary that will lease or acquire new and modernised wagons; Globaltrans, a rail freight operator and freight forwarder; JSC High Speed Rail Lines, a subsidiary to promote development of high speed lines including HSR1 from Moscow to St. Petersburg, and HSR2 from Moscow to Kazan and Yekaterinburg; RailTransAuto JSC that handles a range of commodities including finished motor vehicles [13].\n\nRZD achieves line densities of 23.6 million tonne-km/route-km plus 1.6 million passenger-km/route-km in operations where block-load freight rather than dedicated heavy haul trains share the same infrastructure with passenger trains.\n\nRussia has lagged its BRIC peers since urban rail renaissance started in 1989. Projects completed or under construction include only three metro lines in Chelyabinsk, Kazan, and Moscow, as well as metro extensions and a new monorail line in Moscow [13]. RZD owns and maintains infrastructure and rolling stock, which it leases to suburban companies, and receives a subsidy from the state for providing infrastructure services at a reduced rate. The primary institutional weakness is unprofitability due to ticket revenue failing to cover expenditure and insufficient compensation from state authorities. Thus, ageing and under-maintained rolling stock is gradually being withdrawn from service and not being replaced [20], to the extent that systems in two cities have ceased service.\n\nRussia has, therefore, contemplated or implemented two of the four railway renaissance sub-modes, the outstanding two being heavy intermodal or double stacking, and urban rail. Russia's main east-west and north-south and railway routes, which among others, convey substantial amounts of container traffic are extensively but not completely electrified using 80% non-coal sources. The overhead contact wire would need to be raised to accommodate double-stacked container trains.\n\n3.3. India\n\nA railway budget presented to Parliament by the Railway Minister has traditionally funded Indian Railways (IR). The Ministry of Railways has a dedicated financing entity, Indian Railway Finance Corporation Ltd (IRFC), whose objective is to raise funds from the market to part finance the planned outlay of IR. Money so provided is used to acquire rolling stock and to meet other IR developmental needs. Rolling stock funded by IRFC is leased to the Ministry of Railways, which pays lease rentals to the corporation. IR also operates a Wagon Leasing Scheme to encourage shippers and private operators to invest in rolling stock, but it has continued to flounder. It appears that politicised relations between IR and the government, and the consequent apparent lack of strategic direction, deterred private participation. To overcome these obstacles in moving its railways into renaissance, IR has adopted the special purpose vehicles, described in the next two paragraphs.\n\nFirst was the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Ltd (DFCCIL) in 2006 under the Ministry of Railways administrative control, to plan, develop, fund, resource, construct, maintain, and operate Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs). Building DFCs across the country, to operate double stack container trains and/or heavy haul trains, marked a strategic inflexion point in IR's history, which has traditionally run mixed freight and passenger traffic across its network. DFCs will enable IR to improve customer orientation and meet market needs more effectively. Creation of rail infrastructure on such a scale—unprecedented in independent India—is expected to drive the establishment of industrial corridors and logistic parks along its alignment. Currently under construction, the Eastern DFC is being funded in three different ways: the Ludhiana-Mughalsarai section by the World Bank through an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development loan; the Mugalsarai-Sonnagar section by the Ministry of Railways directly; and the Sonnagar-Dankuni section by PPP. Also currently under construction, the Western DFC is funded through foreign direct investment by the Government of Japan who provided a Special Terms of Economic Partnership Loan to finance construction and procure locomotives. The Ministry of Railways will bear a remaining portion of the project construction cost as equity funding to the DFCCIL. Thereafter, construction of four more DFCs is slated to complete India's Golden Quadrilateral that connects Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, and Mumbai, as well as its two diagonals.\n\nSecond was High Speed Rail Corporation of India Ltd in 2013, on directions of the Ministry of Railways to develop technical standards, undertake project-related studies, as well as prepare financial and implementation models. It appears that a 540-km dedicated high speed line between Mumbai and Ahmedabad could be first, followed by five other projects during the next ten years to connect major metropolitan centres Delhi-Amritsar, Delhi-Chennai, and Chennai-Mysore. Two of the projects are set to serve portions of the Delhi-Mumbai corridor, currently tenth on the list of the world's top 50 busiest passenger air routes. The recently elected government has implemented a fast track, investment-friendly and predicable PPP mechanism to modernise and revamp the railways and implement expensive projects such as high speed rails [21].\n\nIndia's networking aspirations have, thus far, not pursued a strategic horizon much beyond the 1,676 mm broad gauge that it shares with neighbours Bangladesh and Pakistan, as well as Sri Lanka's island network. It is incompatible with the two other major track gauges in Asia, China's and Eurasia's standard gauge, and the CIS' 1,520 mm broad gauge, so it is beholden to transloading containers, bogie changing or gauge-changing, which would dampen networking enthusiasm unless there were major traffic flows at stake.\n\nIndia's cities have also benefited from renaissance in urban rail. Since urban rail renaissance started in 1989, projects completed or under construction include 17 metro lines in Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Navi Mumbai, as well as a monorail line in Mumbai [13]. Interestingly, Delhi's three Phase 1 lines are the same 1,676 mm broad gauge as its national network, while its four Phase 2 lines are standard gauge, to benefit from lower prices in the larger standard gauge market. This practice subsequently spread to metros in Bangalore, Chennai, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and the planned metro in Pune.\n\nIndia has in quick succession rolled out metro systems in major cities, started construction of dedicated freight corridors, and recently announced a cooperation agreement with China to develop a high speed network. It is a member of the International Heavy Haul Association, and already operates double-stacked container trains. IR achieves creditable overall line densities of 10.9 million tonne-km/route-km plus 16.6 million passenger-km/route-km in operations that at present include freight and passenger trains sharing the same infrastructure. Approximately 67% of freight and 50% of passenger traffic is hauled by electric traction [22]. It has positioned itself strongly in all four of the railway renaissance market spaces.\n\n3.4. China\n\nChina’s railway financing system is based on the government taking the leading role, diversified investment, and market orientation. Joint ventures are the major vehicles for new railway projects. By the end of 2008, RMB 300 billion had been committed from outside the Ministry of Transport. Major financing channels include the Railway Construction Fund, contributions from local governments and cooperative agreements between Ministry of Railways and 31 provincial governments, treasury bonds and budget from the central government, strategic investors such as power plants, coal mines, ports, insurance groups (either public or private), the Dedicated Construction Fund from operation revenue, restructuring railway assets to initial public offering, issue of Railway Construction Bonds, and domestic and foreign bank lending. Implementation rests on a clear vision, a good plan, an efficient implementation mechanism, and a creative financing system.\n\nChina recently opened its third heavy haul line, the 1,216-km public private partnership Shanxi South Central Railway from Watang in Xingxian County to the port of Rizhao in Shandong Province. It follows construction of the original 653-km Datong–Qinhuangdao coal railway completed in 1992 and the 1,040-km Shenmu–Huanghua Railway, all with nameplate capacity 200 million tonnes per year.\n\nChina Railways commenced high speed service as recently as 2007, and today operates the largest and most heavily used high-speed railway network in the world.\n\nChina's cities have benefited since urban rail renaissance started in 1989. Projects completed or currently under construction include 107 metro lines in Beijing, Changchun, Changsha, Chengdu, Chongqing, Dalian, Dongguan, Foshan, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Hangzhou, Harbin, Hefei, Kunming, Lanzhou, Nanchang, Nanjing, Nanning, Ningbo, Qingdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Shijiazhuang, Suzhou, Taiyuan, Tianjin, Ürümqi, Wenzhou, Wuhan, Wuxi, Xi'an, Xiamen, Xuzhou, and Zhengzhou; nine light rail lines in Changchun, Nanjing, and Suzhou; six rubber- or steel-tyred automated light metro lines in Macau and Wuhan; two monorail lines in Chongqing; and two suburban lines in Wenzhou [13]. China also operates bus rapid transit systems. Its urban-guided transit catalogue thus includes the full range of three steel-tyred solutions, namely, heavy metro, automated light metro, and light rail; and three rubber-tyred solutions, namely, automated light metro, monorail, and bus rapid transit. It is therefore able to nuance solutions for particular city requirements.\n\nChina currently sets the world pace for railway expansion and performance. It achieves a creditable 26.9 million tonne-km/route-km plus 8.89 million passenger-km/route-km on a network that at present includes dedicated freight lines (heavy haul) and dedicated passenger lines (high speed), as well as extensive mixed traffic heritage infrastructure that has been progressively upgraded. It participates in all four of the railway renaissance market spaces, although the height of double-stacked containers is limited by overhead electrification, and has developed means to finance huge railway expansion in support of its rapid economic growth. It is a strong role model for driving railway renaissance through investment in inherently competitive railway technologies.\n\nOne aspect of China's railway development elevates it above its BRIC peers, and indeed all other railway countries of note, namely, its global railway network ambitions and the progress that it is making in this regard. Its Silk Road Economic Belt and Maritime Silk Road initiatives embrace countries situated on the original Silk Road through Central-, South-, Southeast- and West Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, as well as Oceania, and North and East Africa. They call for integration of the region into a cohesive economic area through building infrastructure, increasing cultural exchanges, and broadening trade [23]. China's railway strategic horizon thus reaches out from its 107,000-km standard gauge home network to surrounding and remote regions, e.g., the entire Asia, North America, Western Europe, and Africa. The following examples start from the north and proceed clockwise to show the magnitude of China's ambitions to open up transcontinental and intercontinental standard gauge trade routes.\n\nConnecting into broad-gauge Mongolia to support the latter's mineral exports.\n\nStrengthening linkages with Russia through additional border crossings, including lines from China's northern provinces to Russian ports Pos’et and Slavyanka on the Sea of Japan.\n\nCooperating with Russia to build a 7,000 km high speed line from Beijing to Moscow.\n\nReaching out to North America, together with Russia. Counter-intuitively, the great circle, i.e., shortest, route from, say, Chinese manufacturing city Chongqing to the western United States is not across the Pacific Ocean, but overland via the Bering Strait between the Asian- and North American continents.\n\nRouting rail traffic from standard-gauge North and South Korea through China to Europe, at present routed through Russia and Belarus.\n\nConnecting China's southern cities Nanning and Kunming to Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar, by re-gauging from narrow gauge to standard gauge in the countries mentioned, with ultimate vision to connect to Singapore through Malaysia.\n\nConnecting Xigaze railhead in Tibet over some 1,700 km along China's south-western border to Kashi railhead in Xinjiang Autonomous Region. This will springboard links among other to Bhutan, India, and Nepal under Mount Everest by 2020; through Pakistan to the Arabian Sea; and through Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to Herat in Afghanistan, soon to be the easternmost outpost of the Eurasian standard gauge network.\n\nLeveraging its existing connection with Kazakhstan's broad-gauge network via two border crossings west of Ürümqi, one to the northwest, and one to the southwest.\n\nUpgrading lines from the port of Piraeus in Greece through the Balkan states to Hungary, to access Western Europe.\n\nPromoting new standard gauge railways in several equatorial African countries: China has encouraged standard gauge ambitions and initiatives in Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, and others. This topic is addressed in more detail in sub-subsection 4.1.3 in respect of schemes that have already borne fruit.\n\nTo be fair, China is not having it all its own way. While its propositions may appear attractive, smaller countries, nevertheless, seem wary of a longer term agenda. Some would like to leverage China's overtures to their own benefit. Negotiations can take a long time. Several disputed territories mark its south-western border, so political challenges are likely to equal technical challenges. But ultimately, high performance rail has become the backbone of choice for integrated, multimodal freight and passenger transport in an energy-scarce world. Countries that cannot achieve that by their own means will likely eventually accept what is on offer.\n\n3.5. The Gulf Cooperation Council States\n\nThe countries of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, commonly called the GCC States, are arguably the world's current railway investment hotspot. The GCC comprises United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a relative newcomer to railways, the first line having been built in 1951 to indirectly connect the port of Dammam on the Gulf of Persia with the capital Riyadh. A direct line followed in 1985. Saudi Railways Organization operates double-stack container and passenger trains on these lines. As the spectre of peak oil approached, Saudi Arabia established the Supreme Economic Council in 1999 to formulate and better coordinate economic development policies in order to accelerate institutional and industrial reform and diversify its economy beyond petroleum. Several key railway projects followed. First is the Saudi Landbridge, a 950-km, mixed traffic link from Riyadh to the port of Jeddah on the Red Sea to convey double-stack container trains at 120 km/h and passenger trains at 220 km/h. Scheduled for completion in 2021, the Public Investment Fund will finance it with operations contracted out. Second is the North-South Railway, a 1,400-km heavy haul route from mineral deposits in the north-western region to the Gulf port of Ras Az Zawr, completed in 2013. Saudi Railway Company, whose shares may put to subscription, administered construction, while Saudi Arabian Mining Company has a concession to operate the line. A 500-km link to Riyadh is under construction, to enable passenger and freight services to run between the capital and the Jordanian border. Third is the 320-km/h Haramain High Speed Rail linking Makkah, Jeddah, and Madinah, currently under construction. Fourth is the GCC railway, a new 2,177-km, 200-km/h double track international freight and passenger railway currently under construction to link the six abovementioned countries and integrate them with the railways of Saudi Arabia. It will follow the Gulf coast from Kuwait's border with Iraq to Salalah in southern Oman, with branches to Bahrain and Qatar, linking all six states and sharing the cost in proportion to the length of the main line in each country. The first phase was delivered in 2014 with completion expected in 2017. Fifth is Jeddah, with a joint venture of the Jeddah Municipality and the Jeddah Urban Development Company set to open three light metro lines in 2020. Sixth is Makkah, with an elevated metro to carry Hajj pilgrims opened in 2010 and four further regular metro lines approved in 2013. Seventh is Riyadh, with a university campus automated light metro opened in 2012, and an automated six-line metro, for which Arriyadh Development Authority has placed turnkey contracts for completion in 2018, and a monorail under construction to serve the financial district. Eighth is Dubai, which opened its first line in 2009, It currently operates two metro lines plus a tram line.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its GCC fellow members have in around one decade moved from few or no railways to one of the world's most comprehensive systems. It includes all four of the railway renaissance sub-modes, high speed, heavy haul, heavy intermodal, and urban rail. The GCC example illustrates how quickly a committed authority can establish renaissance rail by selecting industry-leading practices in each of the previously mentioned sub-modes.\n\n3.6. Urban rail\n\nThe following paragraphs are built on previously reported research [3, 4], including all urban-guided transit with the exception of bus rapid transit. Urban rail applications are too many to detail, therefore this section takes a necessarily highly aggregated view of the global urban rail and urban guided transit situation. The observations include all operations that qualify for inclusion in the Railway Directory's City Railways section, using the ten years spanned by the 2006 and 2015 issues [13]. Table 1 below presents their pertinent statistics in a way that brings out their significance.\n\nDuring the nine years to 2015, the number of cities that have implemented urban rail or have it under construction has increased from 120 to 487 (32.7%). Of cities with existing urban rail, 47.7% increased their network size accounting for 23.3% of growth, which together with 13.4% growth in cities that previously had no urban rail of any description, resulted in 36.7% total network growth in nine years. This is exceptional growth by railway standards, and it is evident that urban railway renaissance has responded rapidly to the global megatrend migration of people to cities. Note that while the increased network size is mainly attributable to greenfield sites, there are a few brownfield sites where operations have been extended on existing, upgraded, or disused infrastructure of others, for example some tram-train projects.\n\nTwo concurrent trends underlie the net change in global urban rail network size. The first is obviously the dominant expansive and new growth mentioned above. Notwithstanding that, 36 cities recorded an aggregate network decrease of 1,589 km. There are many reasons for this change including the ups and downs of economic growth; shifting relative economic and political power from country to country; population migrations; failure or inability to renew assets; the rise of alternative transport modes; changing social preferences; inappropriate institutional arrangements; redefined jurisdictions, usually by combining and sometimes by separating them; rationalising pre-existing networks as agglomerations develop; extending routes to tram-train applications on conventional networks; increasing intermodal integration among modes; and many others. This chapter reports on global shifts that generally favour rail, hence the foregoing phenomena are outside the present research scope and no grounded position is offered. They could justify substantial research in their own right.\n\nPrevious research has found that although Heavy Metro remains unchallenged in the highest capacity rail applications, rubber-tyred guided transit modes have challenged rail’s former unquestioned status in the light-axle-load, low-speed market space [3]. One would therefore expect Light Rail and Light Metro to be more vulnerable to competition from rubber-tyred systems. Notwithstanding that potential weakness, their good green credentials attract smaller cities that value inherent environmental friendliness over the expediency of simply moving people under the weight of popular demand. Automated Guided Transit and Monorail nevertheless seem well-positioned to drive a wedge between the heavy and light poles of urban rail. Note, therefore, that Automated Light Metro, Automated Guided Transit, and Monorail are already present in 26 of the world's 487 cities with urban guided transit solutions."
