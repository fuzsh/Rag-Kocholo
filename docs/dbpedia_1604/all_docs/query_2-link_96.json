        "text": "The railway freight transport is essential for those countries in Central Europe which do not have seaports. On the other hand there is a continuous competition between the different modes of transportation. The aim of the study was the elaboration of recommendations in order to increase the competitiveness of railway transportation mode. A general overview of the European transport market and a present status quo of the multi-modal freight transport were presented. The main proposals were the following: closer cooperation of the countries, unified support system for multi-modal transport, development of IT solutions, development of infrastructure on the borders.\n\nRail is being promoted to play an increasing role in reducing the external cost of freight transportation globally. This is especially the case for nations with high economic growth, such as Indonesia, which require a reliable and efficient transportation system to support global logistics. Ironically, rail freight services in Indonesia have been in decline for more than a decade due to a number of factors including the prioritization of passenger services and strong competition from the road sector. This paper aims to provide a platform for empirical research contextualizing a rail capacity framework, to be applied to the Indonesian system, with a focus on freight services. A desktop review of methodologies employed for capacity evaluation was carried out, in order to identify the most suitable approach for Indonesia. The application of these methodologies will assist in determining current capacity – utilized and unutilized – the results from which can be exercised in future strategic planning.\n\nIt is widely recognized that railways were one of the most important drivers of economic growth in the 19 th and 20 th century, but it is less recognized that railways had a different impact across countries. In this paper, we first estimate the growth impact of Indian railways, one of the largest networks in the world circa 1900. Then, we show railways made a smaller contribution to income per-capita growth in India compared to the most dynamic Latin American economies between 1860 and 1912. The smaller contribution in India is related to four factors: (1) the smaller size of railway freight revenues in the Indian economy, (2) the higher elasticity of demand for freight services, (3) lower wages, and (4) higher fares. Our results suggest large disruptive technologies such as railways and other communication technologies can generate huge resources savings, but may not have large growth impacts.\n\nThe European Commission&#39;s White Paper on transport (European Commission, 2011) seeks to achieve an efficient and sustainable balance between the various transport modes. Environmental impact studies on intermodality transport show that rail freight transport is the land-based transport that has a higher environmental performance compared to intermodal road-rail and all-road transport (Fries and Hellweg, 2014), especially when electrified railway is used (Spielmann and Scholz, 2005). Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology allows us to model as best as possible the environmental impacts of several pollutants in numerous categories. For other categories such as accident damages, noise impact and land use, new developments have to be performed. For the environmental impact assessment, all life cycle phases of rail freight transport operation, rail infrastructure, and rail equipment are taken into account (Spielmann et al., 2007).\n\nWith Foreign Direct Investment in almost all the sectors, FDI has finally found its way into Railway sector as well. The sector which was Public is on way to work on a Public Private Partnership model. This paper talks about the Foreign Direct Investment in Railways sector and its impact on the Indian economy and in what areas FDI will be allowed, followed by conclusion.\n\nThis paper examines the effects of road and rail transport system on economic growth of Nigeria. The empirical analysis and findings from a Multiple Ordinary Least Square (MOLS) model revealed that though road transport had significant positive effects on economic activities, the low level of rail transport significantly suppressed the overall contribution of land transport and the smooth flow of goods and passengers in Nigeria. Consequently, the low level of rail system has reduced the overall impact of transport sector on the growth of Nigerian economy, while government transport infrastructure investment enhanced the economic growth. The study concluded that the neglect of rail system had overstressed the road transport and hence destroyed the possible complementary benefits from the two transport system. Therefore, increasing government investment in rail transport sector will not only augment the overall economic productivity but also enhance the complementary contributions of both rail and road transport system in Nigeria."
