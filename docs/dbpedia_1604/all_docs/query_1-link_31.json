        "text": "(Unfortunately, this wasn’t published in time after I came back, but here it goes, the finale to the China Chroncles series)\n\nOn 6th December 2023, my 22-day trip in China came to an end as I boarded a flight back to Singapore from Guangzhou’s Baiyun international airport. While I was expecting the three weeks to be a really long one, it flew by really quickly, packed with lots of action, both from what was officially planned for me and my side quests of recording down the development experience in both urban and rural China. As my plane flies across the South China Sea back to the little red dot along the equator, it’s worth noting the highlights of urban design in the cities I visited, and the transport systems serving them too. And perhaps a bit of new insights into Chinese transport that I haven’t been able to discuss since my last post on urban Chinese transit.\n\nAfter bidding farewell to the countryside we left Xiasi guzhen, headed back for Guangzhou, where we would fly back the following day. We pretty much spent the whole day travelling, with a three-hour coach ride in the morning to catch our train at Guiyang North (180km away from Xiasi), the same way we came from, before our final ride on Chinese high-speed rail back to Guangzhou, where the final night was spent in anticipation of flying off the following day. I was previously baffled by how the “fast” high-speed trains were supposedly running so slowly, and calling so often despite being labelled as the fastest class of train service, the “G”-series. On this final ride, I figured out why.\n\nThe train I took from Shenzhen to Guiyang, prior to my 7-day rural stint, G2946 (Shenzhen N >> Guiyang N) took 4 hours and 40 minutes to travel the full journey\n\nBy contrast, the return trip, G3735 plied the trip from Guiyang to Guangzhou South in 3 hours 44 minutes, a full hour less than G2946 from above.\n\n(Disclaimer: G3735’s timetable was adjusted sometime in early 2024 to call at an additional station, Zhaoqing East, and its deployment was also changed to a 16-car CRH380AL trainset. This stop did not exist when the author rode it in December 2023, and it was served by an 8-car CR400AF set as of December 2023) Though personally I suspect it’s a temporary redeployment in light of major national holidays involving large passenger flows\n\nBoth trips were served by the newest Fuxing trains (CR400 series), and ostensibly they ran the same physical route, so why the significant differences in travel time?\n\nTo be fair, as one can tell from the train schedules, it does make a whole lot of difference when the train is stopping at half as many stations or even fewer on one run than the other, even more so when the sole intermediate stop (Foshan West) is flushed all the way to one end of the line, offering a mostly-uninterrupted run at the line’s maximum possible 300km/h. Unfortunately, I passed out from lethargy from the 20 long days that preceded, and hence failed to appreciate the full extent of this 标杆车 (benchmark train) service. Nonetheless, even having slept through most of the journey, the noticeable reduction in travel time was still much appreciated!\n\nAn interesting concept unique to the Chinese railway system is that of the 标杆车, or “benchmark train”, emerging as a result of the many complicated service patterns on the interconnected grid network of routes, defined as the fastest run, usually with fewest stops, along the entirety of a physical line, or any given pair of two major cities. This term has caught on in mainstream media in recent years primarily because the development of passenger dedicated lines (客运专线, PDLs), aimed at carrying high-speed trains, has made the distinction between different stopping patterns clearer with fewer unwanted stops along the way caused by freight trains. For instance, G3735 is the “benchmark train” of the Guiyang-Guangzhou PDL, topping out at 3 hours 44 minutes (now 3h48, with the extra Zhaoqing East stop, which should be temporary while the May Day holiday lasts) between the capitals of Guizhou and Guangdong. Similar examples exist in other situations too — the benchmarks of the Beijing-Shanghai PDL are defined by the first 28 numbers in the Gaosu Dongche series (高速动车, G-prefix), while G403 and G404 serve as the benchmarks of the Beijing-Kunming HSR service, which runs on parts of the Shanghai-Kunming PDL and Beijing-Guangzhou PDL.\n\nBut anyway, to answer my question, the clue lay in the deployments of the service: the slower G2946 with five intermediate stops was served by a 16-car CR400AF-A set, while the faster G3735, almost a direct express service, was served by just a 8-car CR400AF set.\n\nThis is, in fact, an indirect manifestation of the express-route dilemma, which also applies to high-speed rail as well. Counterintuitively, the HSR service with the highest demand is not the fastest one, or the one that serves the fewest stops — instead, it’s the one that balances out speed and intermediate coverage, more akin to a rapid-stop rather than express or direct route. Especially in China’s case, where the countryside is also a significant driver of demand for HSR service, the express-route dilemma dictates that services that skip a greater proportion of lineside catchment will gain their travel time advantage at the cost of available demand for said service, because many passengers also travel to just the intermediate stops for less significant towns and cities without riding the full journey. Looking back, I did realise that this also held true for the pair of rides to and fro Xiamen in my earlier post — the 8-car CRH2A serving G3003 also called at fewer stops than the 16-car G1626.\n\nA little piece of advice, if you want greater chances of your train hitting top line speed: go for services scheduled to operate with 8-car trains rather than 16-car trains, as the former is typically assigned to runs with fewer intermediate stops. This should be easy to check if you’re booking tickets through websites like Ctrip (12306), which disclose seating plans and deployments in advance. Do note this doesn’t work during periods of high demand (national holidays), or on services that are simply crush-loaded all the time, such as the Beijing-Shanghai trains, because 16-car formations will be thrown regardless of speed. (You’ll have to go search up “xxx标杆车” for your origin-destination pair and hope a train enthusiast has figured it out for you, or parse Ctrip for fastest runs) An additional note: if you want speed on the most major corridors, avoid double-unit coupled trains in an “8+8 car” formation, as those are legally speed limited to 310km/h for technical reasons.\n\nIn either case, it was really on the pair of HSR trips to and fro Guizhou where Chinese HSR really showed its prowess, accelerating within 10km/h of the Guiguang PDL’s rated 300km/h limit for as much as the journey as possible, creating a rather comical situation where it takes less time to cross two provinces than to travel to the most culturally significant city in a neighbouring province. I guess the best is indeed saved for the last, after all.\n\nHowever, the Chinese miracle in transport isn’t achieved solely by rail alone, even though they’re dead set on giving every county with more than 200,000 people a rail connection of some sort by 2035 (https://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2020-08/13/content_5534553.htm). Just as how the Chinese urban transport legends are not simply a product of the metros and regional rail systems, the intercity and especially rural transport sectors also rely heavily upon buses to write their story of the remarkable transformation of passenger transport into the future. In an earlier post I mentioned how another significant, but less covered effort in recent years alongside aggressive HSR expansion, is that of a great push to introduce and sustain rural bus services linking villages to rural towns, and then cities and major economic hubs, with the biggest product of them all the many rural feeders and intercity trunk stoppertrons that cover much of the major roads crisscrossing the nation.\n\nWith that also comes the appropriate infrastructure: almost every rural town in China has a bus station of some sort, built to handle buses plying in all directions as part of the rudimentary hub-and-spoke network guaranteeing basic coverage to as many rural communities as possible. While I was at Xijiang guzhen, the passenger tram route used as a residential service linked to a bus station located outside the tourist area, where bus connections existed to neighbouring counties such as Majiang and Libo, as well as more important nodes such as Guiyang (three hours away) and Kaili. Fast forward to that night as we were bussed to a restaurant somewhere in Libo, it was interesting to note the co-location of the restaurant (a particularly big one, suitable for hosting banquets) with an intercity bus station that looked rather unused. Ergo, it’s a good example of building infrastructure around highest anticipated service, as my trip was made during the off-peak travel season. Later in December the bus station would be flooded with buses carrying visitors to various attractions in Libo, so it’s not a white elephant without context.\n\nA more recent addition to the Chinese transportation arsenal is the trackless railway station (无轨站), which is a fancy way to brand intercity feeder service to HSR stations, where coverage of the HSR system is expanded beyond the physical railway infrastructure through a system of feeder buses and trucks that bring the passenger and freight transport functionality of the railways to areas yet to have them, or unable to have them due to alignment reasons. First started to link Lingyun, an impoverished county in Guangxi to the HSR station in the regional hub of Baise in December 2016, the trackless HSR scheme has been expanded to include 155 stations serving 600 counties nationwide as of 2021, with many more coming along the way especially in provinces with less railway density. These “stations” differ from conventional bus stations in that they allow ticketing and freight processing without having to travel to an actual railway station, with specially-timed buses and trucks provisioned to coordinate with the respective trains (with security check times factored into account), thus fulfilling, as officially claimed, “seamless access” between the HSR system and towns without physical railway infrastructure.\n\nAll this isn’t just for the sake of itself, or to wow foreign audiences with HSR mileage that leaves the rest of the world in the dust. Some may call it white elephant and “wasteful”, but I see it as a highly important means of serving the people, in particular, helping to uplift less developed parts of China from poverty. Enhancing connections between the urban and the rural, as well as within both, even when appearing to be a lossmaking endeavour, benefits economic development in the long run by giving everyone equal access to opportunities (the new aim of socialist development since Reform & Opening Up in 1978), and remove the geographic barrier that stifles opportunities for growth. Ultimately, transport (be it passenger or freight) is about overcoming geographic boundaries, to go places, physically and metaphorically. In this respect, the largely people-centric model of transport planning and development in China is greatly commendable, and rightfully acknowledged as such even in turbulent geopolitics (hopefully). From public-service slow trains for farmers to transport their bulky goods and livestock (!!) to the cities, to trackless HSR stations, extensive intercity bus networks both urban and rural, as well as robust, developed regional rail and urban public transport systems, the defining factor that makes the Chinese miracle possible is the central Communist Party slogan “Serve the People”. And perhaps some visionary fiscal policy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nHeck, HSR freight, a largely experimental thing elsewhere, is planned to become a staple sight in China too, to offer a more affordable and eco-friendly way to transport perishables across the country. In the not-so-far future, a farmer in Lingyun (Guangxi) can send his daily harvest to bigger markets in the big cities further away, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai, with the help of trackless HSR schemes connecting his shipment with a high-speed freight train bound for the intended destinations, and earn more from his richer compatriots who can pay more for the food he grows, and thus farm his way out of poverty in a way his ancestors would never imagine! Little of this would be possible with a profit-seeking motive in place, as is common in the rest of the world, and increasingly so in Singapore.\n\nTo conclude this segment on Chinese HSR for my trip, I found a piece summarising the Chinese HSR experience from the devs’ perspective, one of the 70 articles published for the 70th anniversary of the PRC’s founding in 2019. It’s a particularly good read, and does mention some of the features of Chinese HSR that I’ve covered here and sporadically in earlier posts, such as Lingyun’s trackless HSR station.\n\nWhere do we see ourselves?\n\nFor decades the world has thought of China as a social, economic, cultural and political backwater of the world, or at least that was the mainstream consciousness for most. Since 1978, that’s been slowly changing. Uh, scratch that, I mean it’s changed so fast many still pull the card of denial over issues relating to the country with five stars on the red flag, when it’s literally leapfrogged every single nation from last to first in the short span of less than half a century. What will Singapore look like in 2050? Look today at any second-tier city in China, and that’s your answer. Information technology permeates every aspect of urban services and facilities, and more importantly, unlike most of the rest of the world, China has attained a stage where the material conditions are favourable for widespread implementation of many technologies still being discussed as novelties elsewhere in the world. Ironically, the recently-controversial SimplyGo is more suited for a far more advanced society like China rather than Singapore, where the material requirements that make mandating account-based transit ticketing feasible is actually present. Other countries may be ahead in terms of raw technical prowess, but the real feat is its seamless integration with other technology to form complete systems delivered to the end-user, as well as the upscaling that is critical for mass adoption of any technological breakthrough.\n\nGoing slightly off topic, a good example would be AI — the US might still have better AI models in terms of pure generative ability, but Chinese AI models are more tightly integrated with apps that are used in daily life, as well as going beyond just GPT and image generation. More critically, AI in China has proliferated to such an extent that it’s just so widely used by all sorts of platforms (where their Western equivalents are still taking baby steps in, for instance WordPress’ “trial” AI-generated post excerpts which I don’t use for STC) that an entire ecosystem is formed around such new technologies. Point being, to go far, one needs to go big, and this emphasis on quantity (while keeping a steady grip on quality) is central to its present-day dominance in many tech fields that were once perceived to be Western strongholds.\n\nIn terms of transport, especially technologies enabling public transport, China IS the future, where everything that we are still trialling has scaled up to the level of citywide adoption, or at the very least being tried on a scale large enough to make a significant impact on the transport landscape. Big ones that come to mind include automation, albeit at a scale closer to minibuses rather than full-blown 12-meter rigids, as well as direct digital payment for public transport. However the elephant in the room here is electrification, considered to be the necessary prerequisite to greater transit tech breakthroughs such as automation and integration with the Internet of Things which defines the future of information technology.\n\nEVs in general, nevermind electric buses, have the highest market penetration rate in China, a champion throne held for nearly a decade now. To get there doesn’t simply require the public and enterprises to mass buy EVs — in fact they would be reluctant, if even willing, to buy them, if not for immense support that encourages them to make the leap of faith? EVs represent a paradigm shift in vehicular operations regardless of mode, and ill-equipped societies are doomed to failure.\n\nSure, Porsche can set up a dozen or so charging piles across Singapore for its electric sedans, and BlueSG can pitch in a couple dozen more for its electric fleet. But what will truly incite the switch at speeds rarely seen outside China is an immense explosion in the number of public charging piles, in the magnitude of at least thousands even for our island nation. More often than not, the only party capable of making this a reality is the government, but only if they’re cognisant of the need for them to actively spearhead this transformation.\n\nAs part of travelling to the towns of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou (covered here and here respectively), I got to somewhat experience the Chinese expressway infrastructure of today, and frankly it’s impressive. Not only is the far higher speed limit of 120km/h (100km/h for buses, and even in Guizhou it was 80km/h) a sound slap in the face for LTA’s safety excuse against increasing bus speeds on our expressways here, much has already been done to encourage EVs to fully replace their internal combustion peers! On expressways spanning the length and width of the Chinese nation, the usual rest stops come ubiquitously equipped with EV chargers, although their designs seem to be compatible with cars only, from the relatively low roofs.\n\nEV support infrastructure, particularly facilities such as charging ports, are built to mirror the extent to which infrastructure for their ICE equivalents is currently provisioned for. Meaning, the Chinese are committed towards closing up the gap between fossil-fueled vehicles and their electric versions, with zero access barriers for the latter. With public charging piles found as commonly as fuel stations even in the cities, this level of infrastructure investment is what turbocharges a nationwide electrification campaign.\n\nWhile I was at Libo, the funky restaurant located atop a bus station, besides the barren bus parking lots, a generous serving of electric vehicle chargers were also present on site, presumably in anticipation of a not-so-far future when even intercity and rural buses get electrified. Although, like most publicly-available vehicle chargers in China right now, they appear to be mainly oriented towards cars, but that’s always available for change, given that standards in charging port compatibility have been well established in China and beyond. (China, like most of the world, uses the CCS2 charging port standard for all its EVs, the same kind used in most EVs found in Singapore, including our electric buses)\n\nLet’s be clear — it’s not pretty on the book ledgers at all — such investment results in significant losses just like China’s sprawling HSR network and their extensive public transport systems of decent quality, but this is absolutely necessary if a country is serious about greening transportation. China has reached the point where EVs are so prevalent the oddity is fossil-fueled vehicles instead, and their only hurdle left to truly make it green is the fact that 60% of their electricity is generated by coal still, with another 20% generated by oil and natural gas combined. But it’s something they’ll crack in the near future, and if they can nearly phase out ICE vehicles in their entirety I don’t see why a similar shift can’t occur in their energy industry. And it’s still better than Singapore where 90% of our electricity is generated by natural gas, all while we have a practically nonexistent electric vehicle fleet, so…\n\nBy comparison, it’s been an incredibly slow and rocky process to get EV-supportive infrastructure into our neighbourhoods, into our housing estates where the most numbers of potential cars exist for the EV market to tackle. Electric vehicles, be it buses, cars or trucks, remain highly limited, “tethered” to minimal charging infrastructure available, thus making their utility also rather limited. In the bus industry, this limitation has led to ridiculous regulations that ironically further impede the transition to an electric fleet. An attempted cameo stunt of the BYD B12 electric bus on 138 in mid-April 2024 was summarily shot down by LTA bureaucrats, with “disciplinary action” taken against the depot managers, on the grounds that electric buses were banned from running on full-day slots for trunk services (What were they doing when the older K9s were running full day slots before 162/M was shortened???) out of a fear of the battery running flat. If this reasoning sounds incredibly absurd, it most definitely is, and rather than operational largess on the operator’s part, it reflects how our incredibly slow progress in provisioning electric vehicle infrastructure is a hindrance to the very electrification effort LTA claims to spearhead. The ultimate irony.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese are surging ahead with even more advanced systems to support electric vehicles. Some might note that electric vehicle charging is an incredibly time-consuming process, with the fastest plug-in chargers still requiring at least an hour to fill up the battery completely. By contrast, filling up a fuel tank takes at most a minute, and the vehicle is good to go. The response? Not only are the Chinese establishing a significant network of electric chargers, bigger cities have begun innovating “battery swapping stations” where — get this — the battery is switched for another with a greater range, while the old battery is taken for charging instead of the entire vehicle. This cuts the effective downtime of electric vehicles to match their current fossil-fueled counterparts, since the time needed for a battery swap is equivalent to that of pumping all those litres of fuel into the tank.\n\nWhat convenience and flexibility the fueled vehicle affords its owner has to be replicated for EVs in order for them to take the market by the storm, and so far, only the Chinese have done sufficient for this large-scale transition to take place. I wrote an entire post about what’s needed for a successful electrification process previously, and little has changed in the one or two years since then. And here I’m only listing infrastructure which is relatively small-scale and easy to set up, and even here Singapore lags behind countries in Europe or North America. Let’s not even get into the big projects like entire electrified roads (think how rail lines are electrified linewide, and apply that logic to roads, basically) featuring overhead catenaries or submerged power lines, which is even more fathomable for a Singapore LTA held back by mammoth bureaucracy and conservative planning mindsets. But as I say, the average second-tier city of China today is the Singapore of the 2050s, because while much of what China does today might seem unfathomable to occur here, Singapore will eventually create those conditions for an advanced, clean transport system of the future, albeit at our own pace.\n\nWhere cities come alive and think for themselves\n\nA topic closer to urbanism rather than transport per se, it’s particularly notable how urban structures have become a lot “smarter” in China these days. Everywhere one goes, screens that display reams of information of the state of various facilities, from the most macro systems such as power and water supply to the minutest details on individual stall occupancy. Much of sustainability, the next big trend in urban development, hinges greatly upon the usage of data to optimise the functioning of these glass and metal skyscrapers that inevitably form an indispensible part in dense cities, such as those on the Chinese east coast I visited, and Singapore to some extent.\n\nTake the case of the Das Tower housing Shopee’s Shenzhen offices here. On top of it being about any office tower from the CBD you can imagine it to be, the building is IOT-enabled and equipped with truckloads of sensors and processors throughout that help intelligently regulate the use of water and electricity, as well as track other critical data that I presume aids in management of the building by its owners…?\n\nIt’s the Chinese equivalent to the Smart Nation initiative that the Singapore government has been pushing for at least a decade now, but with a further extension of integrating technology with the built environment, hence unintentionally leapfrogging us yet again even in a field that we perform strongly in. For all its strengths in building an integrated web-based services ecosystem, the Singapore Smart Nation initiative is by all means still mostly confined to the virtual realm and limited in scope to the digitalisation of services provisioned by government agencies, with their furthest impact in the real world perhaps being the “Wireless@SG” initiative aimed at bringing internet connectivity to as many public spaces as possible. It lays out the foundation for the next step (where China is currently), the integration of digital data processing with physical infrastructure, but just like the campaign to electrify our road vehicles here, it’s progressing at an equally slow pace and largely unheard of outside the occasional hype that state media give it from time to time. Whereas in China, it’s unheard of because of how ubiquitous smart buildings are, and the multifaceted roles that these intelligent systems play in management and environmental conservation. We will get there, one day. I shouldn’t be surprised that China has managed to leapfrog Singapore even at its best games, but I still am, pleasantly. With advanced infrastructure hardware comes also the need for robust systems needed to maintain it, and it’s comforting to note that at least in the most prominent examples, this is being committed to, refuting the notions that Chinese infrastructure built at light speed is just Potemkin village concealing its numerous structural flaws.\n\nHow far has IOT-enabled tech penetrated Chinese society? Very, if even the places where smart management is least expected also comes equipped with them. In China, even public toilets of all places employ digital management to track usage and availability, something rarely seen even in the poshest toilets found here or in Japan, where we typically expect them to be “built different” relative to the rest of the world. Better yet, this particular toilet is found, not in some first- or second-tier city, but instead somewhere more backwater — a rest stop in southern Guizhou, which we passed en-route from Xiasi to Xijiang. (What are these places? Impressive demonstrations of urbanism adapted to the rural environment of China)\n\nPublic toilets in China are so advanced that some form of digital management is in place at many of them, especially standalone structures such as those at rest stations along expressways or those along streets in the cities. Many identify cubicle occupancy with, at the least, light indicators (if not full EDS units, I kid you not). It’s an extreme manifestation of a “toilet revolution” underway in China, that aims to modernise sanitation, on top of greatly increasing its access to every corner of the country. It’s said that sanitary infrastructure is an integral part of fostering civilised behaviour among the people, and these efforts to make the unassuming public toilet impressive and digitally connected is an absolute W for the People’s Republic. (Wonder why there’s been fewer reports of Chinese immigrants relieving themselves inappropriately in public places in recent years?) This People’s Daily piece, from the same 70th anniversary series as shared earlier, explains the rationale behind the continued national effort to improve sanitation nationwide since the 1950s:\n\nThere’s another factor to Chinese “speed” that commentators often miss, most likely due to political reasons. Some might find the wording of the above-mentioned campaign — a “toilet revolution” quaint, and oddly violent for a daily affair lacking in it. Those familiar with Chinese policies might also note the grandiose and sometimes exaggerated diction in campaign naming and slogans too, with words like “Great” (大) appearing often. Think of the Great Railway Speed-Up campaign (铁路大提速) that delivered the Chinese HSR project or the Grand Rejuvenation national program (中华伟大复兴) currently underway with present top leadership. Recent years has also seen the Cultural Revolution-induced aversion to revolutionary vocabulary wear off on the leadership and population alike, with the word “Revolution” appearing prominently in the mainstream consciousness.\n\nSimilar slogan banners that are displayed prominently all across the country come laced with bombastic vocabulary (but it’s also why they’re short and concise) encapsulating key ideas, visions and goals for China’s future, serving as a form of public motivation that galvanises the nation into action. They’re placed on stands and banners that are universally painted red to represent revolutionary fervour, and a good number of them also feature the rounded-handle hammer-and-sickle of the Communist Party, the force that guides the revolutionary power of the masses.\n\nRegardless of the form they take on, these campaign names and slogans take on a grandiose scale and serve to inspire the people with lofty goals and ideals for a utopia inconceivable today, but perhaps in the far future when the collective efforts of countless generations have advanced society to a stage where the conditions for achieving utopia are met. Critically, it is the grandiosity of these goals set for the present that inspire people to give their best, and for policymakers, the drive to achieve more encourages a less conservative and more avant-garde approach to problem-solving that shies away from the bureaucratism that befell the USSR of the late 20th century. As the saying goes, aim for the moon and you’ll land among the stars even if you fail. By taking BIG actions, they get the corresponding magnitude in returns, and that’s how miracles like 0 to 20,000km of high-speed rail in 15 years is achieved. Part of the reason why the Reform and Opening Up campaign successfully transformed China in a mere four decades was because its wording in Chinese — 改革开放 — shares a common character with the term for “revolution” (革命), encouraging all levels of society to make radical changes. To put in short, thinking big is the underrated first step in creating miracles, and these posters are the means through which the entire country is kept on the same page striving for an even better future, even when China is ahead in many fields already.\n\nThese installations are often considered “communist propaganda” and “CCP brainwashing”, but the content on these — aimed at abstract goals in reality rather than ideology — is so tame for propaganda it cannot be considered such at all. It’s more appropriate to think of them as TED talks but on political steroids instead, serving a purpose of inspiration rather than indoctrination. While we’re at that, it should be noted that the correct way to address the ruling party is CPC, not CCP.\n\nNew hubs?\n\nChina’s HSR stations and even subway lines in some cases, are often ridiculed for being located far from human civilisation, hence creating short-lived memes such as Caojiawan station (subway in the middle of nowhere). The bigger picture is that infrastructure such as metro lines and HSR stations are planned in a proactive, rather than reactive manner relative to urban planning in China. In effect this means the usage of transport infrastructure to redirect the course of urban development. What’s interesting to watch over the next decade or so will be how effective these massive investments will be at driving urban development in the intended direction. It will hinge upon the amenities provided by these new areas that develop in tandem with transit infrastructure, as well as secondary connections between these new hubs and the established transport network in adjacent urban areas.\n\nOn the way to Guizhou from Shenzhen the train passed one such upcoming development, the Humen TOD, serving the new town located some distance away from the old downtown of Dongguan. It looks a bit empty, just like the countless other projects across China comprising the construction of entire new cities from the ground up. I hope this eventually becomes the majority case of a short-lived ghost town becoming a bustling city in a few years, and it should live up to its role as a means of taking pressure off the key cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen, enabling its inhabitants to enjoy the benefits of China’s prosperous east coast without the downsides of urban overcrowding.\n\nBut while they might face uphill challenges trying to find people to throng them, these hubs more or less avoid the problem of “integration” per se, with transport hubs centered around airports and railway stations adopting a largely people-centric single-house design aimed at bringing most, if not all modes under a single roof. I haven’t had the chance to see much of their bus infrastructure besides a cursory look at the Xiamen BRT viaducts, but it’s reassuring, and perhaps ironic to note how the open-air designs in Quanzhou that would be considered backwards and 1970s-era in Singapore perform much better than any of our ITHs in terms of access penalty and ease of transfers. And even when it’s physically impossible to really cram everything under one roof, they keep everything close to each other, as much as possible. Such as this bus park and terminal located adjacent to Guiyang North railway station, which is connected by a short overpass (emphasis: short) to the boarding and alighting points. A sensible and logical solution to making the bus feel an integral part of the transport experience to the HSR station even when physical integration isn’t feasible. On a side note, despite having talked so much about infrastructure in this post, it is helpful to note that the Chinese do not use infrastructure as an excuse to limit service, or operational choices. Never will you see a Chinese public bus operator use terminal infrastructure as an excuse for prohibiting bendy buses, the logical and superior option to high-capacity bus transport.\n\nIn slightly more sentimental matters (especially for railfans), many areas along the HSR network in China run parallel to sections of disused conventional railway where abandoned locomotives from a bygone era stand still in time as the present whooshes past them. Random stubs of ballasted track capped at both ends with buffer stops, headed for nowhere but a state of limbo where it existed, while its former roles had long been entirely transferred to the ballastless high-speed railways beside that connect the countryside where they’re found to the cities far beyond.\n\nIt’s a representation of how China’s light-speed development has left some in the lurch even internally, or worse still, left communities behind. A situation that runs counter to the soul of the People’s Republic, it will always be an endless fight to correct for these errors while continuing to steam ahead and improve the overall state of society. These tracks are an apt metaphor of the emerging secondary contradiction in Chinese society and how grand leaps forward in technology have began to risk leaving some communities behind (sometimes exacerbated by unsound policy from the top, there’s no shortage of the bureaucratic and austere equivalents of LTA in various levels of Chinese government too). How this contradiction is managed, by itself and relative to the primary contradiction of present geopolitics, will be a key indicator of how the fastest-rising great power of the world will fare in coming years. For now, there is hope that the runaway capitalist ways of the western world will have a stable socialist counterweight to impart positive policy influence for the common people of the world.\n\n向五星红旗挥手告别\n\nIf it wasn’t obvious enough, my China trip wasn’t predominantly meant to document the surprisingly impressive urbanism and transport management, although it did serve as a valuable side quest that was worth pursuing during my free time across the three weeks, looking for snippets of the way cities and towns alike are managed for the betterment of their inhabitants.\n\nThe Chinese are a fascinating nation that have, in the short span of less than 30 years, massively transformed their largely backwards population and settlements into advanced urban clusters that are designed for principles that go beyond just brutal efficiency that characterises similarly fast-developed nations. Humanist principles in urban design, and people-centric mindsets in public transportation development and operation, set the Chinese experience distinctly apart from many of their peers in the eastern hemisphere who rose out of the ashes of a tumultuous century nearly as quickly, so much so even the commonly-thought powerhouses in quality urban design have yet to come to terms with the reality of them being surreptitiously overtaken.\n\nA distinct culture on the Mainland forged by both 5000 years of tradition and the constructive chaos of the Mao era birthed, following the ending of the latter, a distinct way of organising urban and rural settlements that wins hearts and minds in the court of public opinion, comprising both locals and visitors who have experienced China first-hand. From the firm rejection of the laissere-fairz anarchist urban development strategy that cities in more liberal states fell victim to, to a grand vision of bringing the fruits of development to the entire nation by urbanist urbanisation of the countryside, the oft-misunderstood socialist backbone of China is the key cornerstone that has guided social and economic policy, even as reforms saw a resurgence in liberal ideas sweeping the nation.\n\nAs I have always said about the mainland Chinese attitude towards public transport planning that drives the miracle-like results witnessed by the world today, it boils down to the one slogan that appears more frequently across China than any other: 为人民服务! (Serve the People!) It is the ultimate goal, and the defined purpose of every government body, up to and including the top leadership of the Communist Party. Where people’s needs are put first, or at the very least balanced very solemnly against that of capital’s want for profit, it is when miracles in urban planning and transport, two fields that inherently require government intervention in due to their crucial role to the well-being of the people, are created.\n\nDon’t get me wrong; China is still a fair distance away from a post-scarcity society that renders the basic economic problem obsolete. But the key distinction between the people-first mindset and the profit-first mindset is that one continually asks “How may I best serve the people with my limited resources?” while the other asks “How can I increase my profits with what I have?”\n\nI once again bring up the case study of rural bus service revival. When numerous rural bus lifelines to far-flung villages began going belly-up in the wake of the pandemic’s economic slowdown, the two key solutions employed were to begin combining passengers with more revenue-earning freight runs, and redesigning routes that were able to serve the travel needs of both tourists and residents at the same time. These can be recognised as the microeconomic concepts of diversification and revenue maximisation respectively, but critically these solutions were designed with the key concern of enabling the people to continue receiving adequate transport services, rather than just letting the people suffer to offset losses.\n\nWhile much has changed about the Communist Party since it first began administering limited areas of Jiangxi and later Shaanxi as a guerrilla force, including its leadership, key policies and even the style of management, the spirit to serve the people has remained a constant, forming the basis of government policy (and unfortunately, including mistakenly-advised ones) to the present day. It now runs all of mainland China, but little of its essence has changed since the time Edgar Snow wrote Red Star over China in 1938. (The term “Serve the People” was coined in 1944, but the CPC had been practicing that since the establishment of their first Soviet Republic in 1933)\n\nThe beauty of a socialist government is that it doesn’t have to pander to the whims of capital, nor desire or attempt to seek its approval. While landing a spot on some international ranking of “best airport” or “most livable city” might be the goal of some cities elsewhere, to make their communities as pleasing for the rich of foreign origin to retreat to while enjoying kingly treatment, such matters are of little concern to the Chinese government, who instead prefers to make its urban facilities the best possible for its citizens to enjoy at low cost for their well-being. And while this offends the wealthy, the court of public opinion remains a far more useful indicator of the people’s well-being rather than indexes published by funded think tanks. The robustness of Chinese airport infrastructure and integration offered with urban transport networks may be unrivalled, and the cities perhaps offer a better standard of living. But there isn’t much special consideration for the luxury villas and posh lounges and expensive secondary amenities that the global north’s bourgeoisie might value. How else is it then, that Chinese cities and their infrastructure barely show up on global ranking indexes for non-material metrics? While big names like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen are still somewhat well-known, smaller cities that offer a more chill lifestyle at similar standard of living to Singapore, such as Xiamen and Kunming, are arguably heavily underrated.\n\nAnother manifestation of the people-first mindset is the economic weight that the state and society has thrown, over the years, to keep life affordable for its citizens. With the exception of housing and real estate which is severely overheated there, most other things stay cheap, and can be gotten for prices that would shock even the most frugal Singaporean. This meal of a full plate of shrimp omelette and a rather large bowl of rice at Shenzhen’s SUSTech, for instance, costs only CNY 12 (S$2.29). Another policy instituted across multiple universities in Xiamen is the mandate of a free bowl of rice and vegetable soup for every student per meal, as a result of philanthropist Tan Kah Kee’s (who helped establish most of them) influence. Society in China is organised in a different way to the dog-eat-dog capitalism that many lament permeates Singapore.\n\nAnother useful comparative vignette would probably be to look at transport fares, since that’s what STC focuses upon. The earlier post on the Chinese metro experience highlights how their fares are kept astonishingly low — all Chinese metro systems begin their fare meter at CNY2 (S$0.38), equivalent to student concession fares in Singapore, and while the upper cap varies across cities, the average is around Xiamen’s CNY13 (S$2.48). In many cities, possessing a stored-value ticket helps to reduce fares even further with discounts offered, thus making public transport even cheaper! If we look at intercity services, the distinction is even more glaring — a HSR ticket between Xiamen and Shenzhen, located 600km apart, stays cheaper than that of city pairs in other countries with shorter distances! Take a look here. I’ve also added the pricing from a run on the Wuhan-Guangzhou PDL, one of the fastest lines in the Chinese HSR network too, to show that it’s really not because of the speed difference, as some would claim:\n\nBy the way, I specifically picked a train originating from Guangdong province, as that lies under the jurisdiction of CR Guangzhou, infamous for “price gouging” relative to the 17 other divisions of China Railway (so much so it’s memed as “抢铁”, lit. “snatch (money) railway” by railfans and the public alike). If even “price gouger” prices remain barely half that of the rest of the world, it speaks volumes about how the Chinese have worked to keep transportation affordable for the masses (especially when air travel is… a can of worms of its own there) while still managing to keep the burgeoning HSR system alive and kicking.\n\nIt’s crazy, how swiftly the rest of the world has been left in the dust with Chinese speed. It’s even more impressive, when it’s recalled that once upon a time China used to look up to Singapore as a model for urban planning, and we had the pleasure of teaching our advanced ways in citybuilding and political management to the world. In a stunning turn of tables, the student has since overtaken the teacher, and the Chinese are on track to build more humane cities and societies. Now it’s our turn to see what the Chinese system has to offer for our existing challenges, as we stand upon crossroads, poised for a great transformation in the coming years.\n\nFrom the care put into ensuring the human pedestrian remains the center of urban design as far as possible, to robust public transport systems in cities that enable convenient connections within and between them with less significant travel time penalty compared to driving, and even unexpected shining examples of positive urbanist development that inspire hope in an even more people-centric future for the way cities are designed, there’s been no shortage of me being taken in awe by how China, a place where I thought wouldn’t be an urbanist stronghold the way Western Europe is, has demonstrated herself to be the next promising contender of model urban development. At every step along the way there was something that Singapore could possibly learn, and in some cases it’s surprising to note how some aspects of cities, such as the wide buxingjie that also double up as vibrant public spaces, haven’t been implemented in this so-called world-class metropolis yet. They’re so logical and intuitive that it is their absence in Singapore that surprises, not its presence in Chinese cities like Guangzhou and Xiamen. And much of what they do is a lot closer to the LTA’s own goals of a mobility diet comprising walk-cycle-ride, than the existing policies leaving the gates of Hampshire Road. (A lot more sensible too, because the court of public opinion is the ultimate trial for tangible policy in China, instead of snap decision by out-of-touch bureaucrats here) The ideal in urban transport that Singapore professes to be striving towards is here in China. Dream big, and you’re halfway to greatness.\n\nThat’s a wrap for my 22 days well spent in the land of the five stars and red flag. I still have some regrets being unable to fully experience the ups and downs of transit and urbanism in China, but I suppose the chance will present itself soon enough when I visit for the express purpose of exploration, rather than be confined with a large group that I travelled with this time. Fingers crossed hoping it comes soon. Maybe someone could help sponsor me? 🥺👉👈 Nah, I’m kidding.\n\nAs my plane nears Changi Airport, it’s time for me to adjust back to the realities of Singapore’s quirky land transport policy, characterised by austerity and a lot more struggle for better trains, better buses, better cities. Living in China as a Singaporean has been too enjoyable. A few more random photos as I prepare to land, I suppose.\n\nPS: By the way, what’s up with SIA’s inflight catering? It’s absolutely ludicrous that even the infamous price-gouging, corner-cutting CR Guangzhou can serve much better food on their trains than SIA, our national carrier, does on their planes! Just… just look at that sad plain rice bento with a few pathetic vegetables and an off-flavour soggy fish, will ya… It’s no match for the vibrant fare which was offered on any of the HSR trains I rode in the three weeks prior. Even if it contained mystery meat. Send help, I was expecting better from a flag carrier 😭😭😭.\n\nJoin the conversation here, and don’t forget to press the like button!
