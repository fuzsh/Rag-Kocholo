        "text": "Urban rail transport vehicles require electrical power to operate in a clean, efficient and reliable way within city and suburban residential areas. In Kolkata and Bangalore, vehicles receive power at 750Volts DC through a ‘third rail’ conductor laid parallel to the running rails for the vehicle, whereas in Delhi metro vehicles receive power at 25Kilo-Volts AC from an over head electrical conductor strung above the vehicles. Three new metro lines under implementation in Kolkata are with the 750V DC power, whereas projects in Chennai and Hyderabad are with 25KV AC power systems. This article discusses some criterion considered when choosing appropriate traction power system for new metro rail projects.\n\nThis study will evaluate technically, energetic and economically the traction electrification network of the line Barcelona – Valles operated by Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) in the existing voltage system (1500 Vdc) and a new electrification under alternative current (25 kVac) will be proposed to be as well studied. The results obtained will be compared in order to obtain decision factors on which system best fits.\n\nHarmonic distortion is one of the most important power quality issues in third rail electrification systems. The use of rectifiers and inverters in the third rail system can inject a significant amount of harmonic distortion to the electrical network. This paper aims to investigate the harmonic distortions for a DC urban third rail system at various operating conditions. The electrical network of Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 (MRT 2) Malaysia is modelled using ETAP software. The model had considered the effect of the inter-phase transformer in the 12-pulse rectifier. The current injection method is used to measure harmonic distortion at Point of Common Coupling (PCC) at the 132 kV and 33 kV buses. A normal and degraded operating conditions of power supply are investigated. From the simulation results, it is found that the 11th and 13th order harmonics have exceeded the statutory limit at 33 kV network for the normal operating condition. For the degraded operating condition, only the 11t...\n\nIn this paper an experimental work regarding power quality in existing dc traction systems is presented and its results are evaluated. The main supply systems consist of a medium voltage substation feeding a rectifier that provides the dc power supply system for the traction motors. The measurements were performed according to the European standard EN 50160, using 3 wire connection systems. The collected data were analyzed using the software application supporting the instrument. Following this analysis, it is obvious that the power quality is very poor while the trains’ number, running on lines during a measuring period, affects the power quality as it has direct relation with the current absorption from the system. The existence of harmonics in the networks affects the installed equipment and cabling. The fundamental reason and cause which bring forth these problems are the distortion of voltage and current which is supplied and drawn respectively, by those equipments and installa...\n\nIn order to optimize the energy consumption, one has analyzed the tram supply network's energy losses from Oradea city. As a result of the studies and determinations carried out, in current conditions, we determined that there are considerable energy losses, not only on the tracks, but also on the distribution elements and the measurement elements of the rectifying stations (power supply)."
