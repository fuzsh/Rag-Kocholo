        "text": "Despite the ridership struggles facing transit systems in the United States, nations and cities around the world are investing dramatically in new lines. In this annual post, I review what projects were completed in 2023—and what’s coming over the next year.\n\nData for this compilation can be viewed freely on Transit Explorer or purchased for use in Shapefile, GeoJSON, and CSV formats. Transit Explorer has been dramatically expanded since last year, now covering metros—as well as many other types of lines—around the world. In addition, the interactive website for the first time allows users to “turn back the time” by seeing what transit in each city looked like in the past.\n\nPrevious compilations of new and planned transit projects on The Transport Politic can be found here: 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023\n\nNew transit investments completed in 2023\n\nIn 2023, 1,760 kilometers of urban transit—meaning fixed-guideway rail and bus projects within metropolitan areas—opened for service around the world. 1,100 new stations opened along those lines, although many other already existing stations got new service, too. The trends in 2023 represented a continuation of recent trends; in 2022, 1,819 kilometers opened, and in 2021 1,795 kilometers opened.\n\nThe majority of the new service came in the form of metro lines, including subway, elevated, and monorail services, which accounted for 64 percent of the total new route mileage. New light rail options added another 10 percent; commuter rail and regional rail another 16 percent; and bus rapid transit routes about 6 percent.\n\nThe new lines were concentrated in China, where 45 percent of new route kilometers opened, almost all of which were in the form of metros. That said, Russia (11 percent), the United States (5 percent), Thailand (4 percent), and India (3 percent) also added substantial new transit options. Overall, European Union countries added about 5 percent of new routes.\n\nMajor projects that opened included:\n\nBangkok Pink and Yellow Line monorail lines;\n\nBeijing Subway Line 17;\n\nChengdu Metro Line 19;\n\nChongqing Metro Line 18;\n\nDalian Metro Line 5;\n\nDelhi-Meerut RRTS regional rail (first phase);\n\nEdmonton Valley Line Southeast light rail;\n\nFuzhou Metro Line 4;\n\nGuiyang Metro Line 3;\n\nHelsinki Line 15 light rail;\n\nHonolulu Skyline automated metro (first phase);\n\nIstanbul Line 11 metro;\n\nGreater Jakara LRT (metro) extensions;\n\nKuala Lumpur light metro Line 12;\n\nLagos Blue Line metro first phase;\n\nMontréal REM automated metro (first phase);\n\nMoscow D3 and D4 regional rail projects;\n\nNanjing Metro Line S4;\n\nNew York East Side Access commuter rail subway;\n\nShenyang Metro Line 4;\n\nSuzhou Metro Line 11;\n\nTel Aviv Red Line light rail;\n\nWenzhou Metro Line S2;\n\nZhengzhou Metro Zhengxu Line;\n\nBelow, I list the new transit projects that opened in 2023, with the United States listed first, followed by other countries in alphabetical order. Projects are listed by metropolitan area.\n\nUnited States\n\nAlbany, New York: Washington-Western (Purple Line) BRT 13.6 km (Bus Rapid Transit) Link. Project links downtown Albany with the city’s west side, including the University at Albany and Crossgates Mall.\n\nChicago, Illinois: Pace Pulse Dempster 25.1 km (Arterial Rapid Transit) Link. This line runs from downtown Evanston west to O’Hare Airport.\n\nHonolulu, Hawai’i: Skyline East Kapolei–Aloha Stadium 17.3 km (Heavy Rail) Link. This is the first phase of the city’s elevated automated metro. The line, which will connect to the airport and downtown, will be completed in phases in 2025 and 2031.\n\nLos Angeles, California: Regional Connector 3 km (Light Rail) Link.

in projects like Washington’s Metro and San Francisco’s BART. In the decades since, both the United States and the United Kingdom have stagnated, falling behind even as other countries, particularly China, but also India and many in Europe and South America, have invested in massive new construction campaigns. Much of the world’s urban areas are rapidly becoming dominated by metro service.\n\nIn this post, I exploit data from the newly expanded Transit Explorer database, which now includes all metro lines worldwide plus other fixed-route transit services in many countries. The database has been significantly expanded since I wrote about findings from its last update in January. This geospatial database allows me to investigate when and where transit is being built.\n\nThe first trend is unambiguous: Worldwide, metro service availability has expanded exponentially. In 1950, only 24 metropolitan areas in 13 countries globally could boast of a subway, elevated line, or monorail (automated light metros didn’t yet exist). Today, 232 metropolitan areas in 63 countries can make such a claim.\n\nMetro construction has accelerated. The number of kilometers of metro lines in active service has expanded from just over 7,000 in 2000 to more than 23,000 today—a tripling of service even as the global population has grown by only about 30 percent during that time. There are almost 7,000 additional kilometers of metro lines currently under construction globally.\n\nThe increase in metro service availability in since 2000 has been driven by Chinese cities, which now host more than 40 percent of world metro kilometers. European cities have been steadily increasing their metro route length since the 1970s, however, and Indian cities have accelerated subway and elevated construction since 2010.\n\nCities in the United States had a plurality of the world’s metro kilometers until 1960. At that point, cities in the now-European Union accumulated more route kilometers (European cities now have about double the total metro kilometers as those in the United States). Chinese cities passed those in Europe in terms of length in about 2010—and Indian cities are expected to host more metro service than the United States by 2025, given current construction activity.\n\nOne major explanation for the United States’ declining rank in terms of metro service availability is the fact that the New York City region—which had the world’s longest metro system until the mid-1980s—now has fewer subway or elevated kilometers than it did in 1940, at its peak.\n\nThe New York region now has the 13th longest metro system in the world (including the Subway and PATH)—shorter than systems in nine Chinese cities (not all shown on the following graph), plus London, Moscow, Seoul. By 2025, it will be the 15th longest, passed by Delhi and another Chinese city. Remarkably, Shanghai’s metro system is now twice as long as New York’s Subway—despite the former only opening its doors in 1993. New York City has no serious plans to expand its system, even as virtually every other major metropolitan area is doing so.\n\nThe result of the United States’ limited progress in providing metro services to its residents is that the number of metro kilometers per resident in the country is now lower than it was in the 1980s. It had the second-most-plentiful metro service per-capita in the world until that point (after the United Kingdom)—but on this metric it has now been passed by the European Union, as well as China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea, among other countries.\n\nEven when incorporating data on light rail and streetcar lines—which US cities have been more focused on building than metros—transit service availability has declined since the 1970s. Indeed, all of the rail transit construction that’s occurred in the United States since the 1980s has done little more than keep up with population growth.\n\nUp until 2000—perhaps surprisingly given lower transit ridership—the United States had more kilometers of metro and light rail lines per capita than residents of neighboring countries or many large European countries for which the Transit Explorer database has complete information (the database does not yet include light rail or streetcar lines for all countries).\n\nBut the United States has lost its position on this metric to France and Spain in the years since. France went from having about half the per-capita urban rail miles as the United States in 2000 to significantly more today. And countries like Italy and the Netherlands have been rapidly expanding their services in recent years.\n\nWhat’s next for the United States? The federal government’s infrastructure law, passed in 2021, will send hundreds of billions of dollars to cities for new transit projects. So far, though, that hasn’t been enough to spur a massive investment in new transit lines compared to past efforts. Transit agencies in major cities are facing a “fiscal cliff” due to declining ridership that may make it more difficult for them to continue to provide adequate daily service. And construction costs are rising rapidly due to inflation.\n\nUsing the data embedded in the Transit Explorer database, I calculated key statistics on how transit investment has changed over time in the United States and a number of other countries. These data point to some intriguing trends, notably a decline in investment stateside combined with significant expansion in countries like Canada, Egypt, France, Israel, and Turkiye (I have not yet assembled data for countries in south and east Asia, where transit expansion is proceeding even more quickly).\n\n(Relatedly, for the Urban Institute’s Urban Wire, I calculated key trends in housing adjacency to rail and bus rapid transit stations in the US, as well as Canada, England, and France.)\n\nOver the past century, transit construction in the US waxed and waned. Overall, the number of kilometers of rail transit systems added reached its apex (at least since the 1920s) in the 1990s, when about 1,000 kilometers of new commuter rail lines were opened. During the first decade of the 2000s, the country added the most heavy rail (subway/metro) and light rail lines, generating more than 500 new kilometers over ten years, a record.\n\nSince 2010, however, rail transit construction has lost steam in the US. The number of kilometers opened declined by about 30 percent between the 2000s and 2010s, and the first few years of the 2020s suggest further decline by 2030. At the current rate, less than 500 new kilometers of rail transit will open by then—the lowest figure since the 1970s.\n\nNevertheless, among the countries in the Transit Explorer database (meaning, excluding Australia, plus south and east Asian countries), the US now has the most kilometers of metro rail (heavy rail or light metro). As of 2023, it has about 1,350 kilometers in operation, of which about a third are in the New York region.\n\nBut the growth rate of active metro lines in the US has been slower than in other countries since 2000, increasing by only about 10 percent in route length (the US population grew by 18 percent over the same period). The length of metro systems more than doubled in Brazil and increased by 45 percent in Spain, by contrast.\n\nAnd there are about 1,700 kilometers of metro in operation in the European Union’s seven most populous countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania, and the Netherlands), whose collective population is almost identical to that of the United States. Their metro route length has increased by 30 percent overall since 2000—three times as fast as the US. (Those countries’ populations collectively grew by only about 4.5 percent between 2000 and 2021.) It is worth noting that Russia’s urban metro rail systems have also expanded tremendously since 2000, outpacing Spain as of 2022.\n\nWe can see similar trends when examining the number of light rail, tramway, or streetcar stations in operation across the countries in the database. Since 1980, US cities have invested heavily in light rail, adding about 1,370 stations nationwide. That’s a lot, but it is less than in those seven EU countries combined (2,100 stations), and even just in France (1,450 stations).\n\nAnd some countries, like Italy, are planning very large investments in new tramways in the coming year.\n\nTransit expansion plans, of course, vary by metropolitan area. Among regions in the US and Canada, New York has by far the largest number of line kilometers of light or heavy rail, followed by the Bay Area, Mexico City, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, and Toronto.\n\nBut New York actually has fewer active heavy rail lines in service than it did in 1950. And neither it nor Chicago has added much light rail or subway service since the turn of the millennium. Neither has any major expansion plans actually funded for completion over the next five years, either.\n\nLos Angeles, Montreal, Seattle, and Toronto, on the other hand, stand out as having the largest transit expansion plans in terms of new route kilometers that are currently under construction or planned, meaning projects are funded and almost ready for construction.\n\nAnd when controlling for urban area population, New York is arguably an under-performer when it comes to overall transit route length. The New York urban area currently has fewer light or heavy rail kilometers per capita than the Baltimore, Bay Area, Denver, Philadelphia, San Diego, St. Louis, and Washington, DC regions. It goes to show that having the maximum amount of transit route length isn’t necessarily directly correlated with having the most transit ridership; the New York area carries more people on transit than all those regions combined.\n\nBut New York, as noted, also stands out for having no light rail or subway projects that are either under construction or funded. This situation contrasts strongly with the Minneapolis and Seattle urban areas, whose rail transit expansion plans are the largest in the US on a per-capita basis.\n\nNew York’s limited transit expansion prospects are particularly remarkable when compared to the plans of many other world regions. Cairo, Istanbul, Paris, Riyadh, Tel Aviv, and Toronto each have many light rail or metro lines under construction today—and many more kilometers planned (Paris is likely to soon overtake London and New York in terms of total kilometers of such routes). London, on the other hand, has none.\n\nDifferent regions are investing in different ways. Among routes that are currently under construction, Casablanca, Copenhagen, Los Angeles, Seattle, Tel Aviv, and Toronto have focused heavily on light rail projects. Cairo, Istanbul, Lagos, Montreal, Paris, and Riyadh are building at least 50 kilometers of metro rail each. And Bogota, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro are building many kilometers of bus rapid transit.\n\nThe result of all this expansion is that New York’s once-dominant position as having the world’s longest metro network—a position it claimed from London in the 1910s—has eroded. New York pulled down many of its elevated lines and didn’t do much to expand its Subway network. Meanwhile, London took on the mantle in the 1980s through its expansion with the Docklands Light Railway, and, through systematic, relentless expansion, Moscow took the crown from London in the 2010s. Systems in East Asia are even larger. At the same time, Paris, Cairo, and Istanbul have massive expansion plans with many new lines opening over the next five years.\n\nThese conditions overall tell a story of declining US commitment to transit expansion in the context of large growth in other countries around the world. There are some exceptions—Seattle, in particular, has a big investment in new lines planned. But while the world is building out ever more accessible transit systems, the US appears to be falling behind.\n\nLast year, three lines Americans have been waiting on for decades—the Green Line extension in Boston, the Crenshaw Line in Los Angeles, and the Silver Line to Dulles Airport outside Washington—finally opened. Though they took years to be completed, they were greeted enthusiastically by riders and political officials content to bring better service to more people.\n\nSimilar reception greeted new rail and bus lines opening in Athens, Cairo, Guadalajara, Helsinki, Paris, and dozens of other cities around the world. And much more is planned for 2023: Finally, Long Island Rail Road service will reach the sub-sub-sub-basement of Grand Central Terminal. Toronto’s Eglinton light rail line will connect the city crosstown. And Honolulu, Gebze, Riyadh, Tel Aviv, and Thessaloniki will get their first metro services.\n\nThis year, I leveraged data assembled in the Transit Explorer database to identify which projects opened in 2022, which are planned for opening in 2023, and which will be under construction this year—for a later opening date.\n\nOn separate posts, I analyzed trends in transit investments around the world and examined accessibility to transit stations in the US versus Canada, England, and France.\n\nThe Transit Explorer database now includes all fixed–guideway urban transit systems (meaning rail and bus rapid transit) across North America, South America, Africa, and nine Western European countries, plus metro systems throughout Europe and in parts of the Middle East. Transit Explorer now includes about 29,200 urban transit stations and about 6,700 urban transit lines (covering 78,000 kilometers). (It also includes some intercity rail systems.) These are the geographies for which I provide details about transit line openings below.\n\nData can be viewed freely on Transit Explorer or purchased for non-commercial use in Shapefile, GeoJSON, and CSV formats for those who would like to use the data for research or other uses, such as in Excel, R, ArcGIS, or QGIS.\n\nPrevious compilations of new and planned transit projects on The Transport Politic can be found here: 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022\n\nNew transit investments completed in 2022\n\nOverall, 517 kilometers of new fixed-guideway urban transit services opened in 2022 across the countries covered by the Transit Explorer database. Of these, the countries with the largest increases in kilometers were the United States (196 kilometers); Egypt (77 kilometers); Mexico (60 kilometers); France (39 kilometers); and the United Kingdom (34 kilometers).\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nBaku: 2 km Purple Line metro extension from Avtovagzal to Khojasan\n\nCanada\n\nMontreal: Creation of 11 km SRB Pie-IX bus rapid transit route through the east side of the city\n\nDenmark\n\nOdense: Creation of 14 km first phase of the Letbane tramway system\n\nEgypt\n\nCairo:\n\nLine 3 metro extension west to Kit Kat (4 km)\n\nCreation of 72 km Cairo Light Rail system (really a metro system) heading east into the new capital area\n\nFinland\n\nHelsinki: 7 km extension of the M1 metro line\n\nFrance\n\nParis:\n\nM4 extension 1.8 km south to Bagneux\n\nM12 extension 1.9 km north to Aubervilliers\n\nCreation of 19 km Tramway 13 Express, a new circumferential line on the west side of the region\n\nRennes: Creation of new 13 km Line B automated light metro\n\nToulouse: Creation of 3 km Teleo aerial tram line\n\nGreece\n\nAthens: Extension of metro line 3 by 3 km\n\nItaly\n\nMilan: Opening of the first phase of automated M4 light metro, 5.5 km from the airport into the city\n\nIsrael\n\nHaifa: Creation of Rakavlit aerial tram line (4 km)\n\nLuxembourg\n\nLuxembourg: Extension of T1 tramway by 1.2 km to the south\n\nMauritius\n\nPort Louis: 10 km extension of the Metro Express light rail system to the south\n\nMexico\n\nGuadalajara: Creation of 41.5 km Mi Macro Periferico bus rapid transit line, a circumferential route around the city\n\nMexico: 18 km extension of Mexibus Linea 1 bus rapid transit line in the northern suburbs\n\nPoland\n\nWarsaw: Extension of M2 metro line west and east, totaling 6 km\n\nSpain\n\nValencia: Creation of L10 tramway, 5 km\n\nTurkiye\n\nBursa: Creation of 8 km T2 tramway line\n\nIstanbul:\n\n8 km extension of M4 to Asian-side airport\n\n1.5 km extension of M7\n\nCreation of F4 funicular system, a 1 km line\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nBirmingham: 1.3 km extension of the West Midlands Metro light rail system through the centre city\n\nLondon:\n\nOpening of Elizabeth Line regional rail central segment, a 28 km route, mostly in subway, through the center of the city\n\nExtension of the 4.5 km extension of the Overground to Barking Riverside\n\nUnited States\n\nBirmingham: Creation of 16 km Xpress BRT route, which includes some dedicated bus lanes\n\nBoston: Opening of Green Line extension into Somerville and Medford, along two branches, totaling 7 km\n\nEl Paso: Creation of 31 km Brio Montana arterial rapid transit route\n\nLos Angeles: Opening of 10 km first phase of K/Crenshaw Line, a light rail route extending from the Expo Line\n\nMinneapolis: Opening of 27 km D Line arterial rapid transit route\n\nPhiladelphia: 5 km extension of SEPTA Regional Rail to Wawa\n\nPhoenix: Opening of 5.5 km Tempe Streetcar\n\nPortland: Opening of 24 km Division Frequent Express bus rapid transit route\n\nSt. Petersburg: Creation of SunRunner Central Avenue BRT, a 28.5 km bus rapid transit line\n\nSan Bernardino: Opening of Arrow Redlands Passenger Rail Project, a 14 km route extending Metrolink\n\nSan Francisco:\n\nOpening of 2.3 km Central Subway, a new light rail route through the city center\n\nCreation of Van Ness Avenue BRT, 3 km of dedicated bus lanes\n\nWashington DC: Opening of second phase of Silver Line, an 18 km extension that includes access to Dulles Airport\n\nPlanned 2023 openings\n\nAlmost 1,100 kilometers of fixed-guideway urban transit is planned to open in 2023 in the parts of the world covered by Transit Explorer.
