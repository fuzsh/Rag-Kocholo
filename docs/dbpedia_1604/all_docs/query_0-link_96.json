This master's thesis focuses on analyzing the interference that regenerative braking causes on protection of DC traction systems. The student created a Simulink model of a subway system to simulate various fault conditions. The simulations revealed faults that can cause protections to fail. Based on the results, the thesis proposes a new protection scheme and examines its performance during ground faults and short-circuits. The scheme aims to overcome problems introduced by regenerative braking technology.",
