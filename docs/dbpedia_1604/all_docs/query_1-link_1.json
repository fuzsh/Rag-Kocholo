        "text": "This is a list of the power supply systems that are, or have been, used for tramway and railway electrification systems. Note that the voltages are nominal and vary depending on load and distance from the substation. Many modern trams and trains use on-board solid-state electronics to convert these supplies to run three-phase AC induction motors. Tram electrification systems are listed here.\n\n1. Key to the Tables below\n\nVolts: voltage or volt\n\nCurrent:\n\nDC = direct current\n\n# Hz = frequency in hertz (alternating current (AC))\n\nAC supplies are usually single-phase (1Ø) except where marked three-phase (3Ø).\n\nConductors:\n\noverhead line or\n\nconductor rail, usually a third rail to one side of the running rails. Conductor rail can be:\n\ntop contact: oldest, least safe, most affected by ice, snow, rain and leaves. Protection boards are being installed on most top contact systems, which increases safety and reduces these affections.\n\nside contact: newer, safer, less affected by ice, snow, rain and leaves\n\nbottom contact: newest, safest, least affected by ice, snow, rain and leaves\n\n2. Systems Using Standard Voltages\n\nVoltages are defined by two standards: BS EN 50163[1] and IEC 60850.[2]\n\n2.1. Overhead Systems\n\n600 V DC\n\nCountry Location Name of system Notes\n\nWorldwide\n\nMany tram systems This voltage is mostly used by older tram systems worldwide but by a few modern ones as well.
