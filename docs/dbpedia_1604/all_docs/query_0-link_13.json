        "text": "Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored by China Railway n Rolling Stock Corp. (CRRC) and I am not being paid by any third party to advertise this technology. Any biases seen in this article, and others on the STC blog, are solely those of the author, and not of any other party. This post was formed out of genuine admiration for ARRT technology on the author’s part, and should play no other role than to advise the way forward in the construction of the transportation system in Singapore (and maybe abroad).\n\nHybrids are great. Their beauty lies in their unique blend of various elements from other ideas. It doesn’t really take a 42069 IQ to see its benefit: they easily combine the advantages of each element from the various ideas together, to form something better, without ever having to invest heavily in reinventing the wheel.\n\nFrom hybrid flowers,\n\nhybrid cars,\n\nand even to hybrid economic and political systems,\n\nhybrids are here to stay. And just as they bring about revolutionary new ideas in every other field, they are also making inroads into the public transport sector too!\n\nWe’ve had hybrid buses,\n\nand now it is time for something much, much bolder.\n\nThe hybrid transit mode\n\nThought experiment time!\n\nPicture a bus.\n\nIs this what comes to mind?\n\nYes?\n\nWhat kind of message about buses do the above images convey?\n\nLet’s break’em down.\n\nThe first thing (only about the first picture), most should notice how the buses look very clunky. Like literal metal boxes on wheels. Their automobile peers have long stopped resembling absolute pieces of metal junk, since the early 00s.\n\nFor comparison, this is a modern car:\n\nSo the first point down: Most buses, from their pretty (comparatively) crappy exterior design, convey a sense of technological backwardness. (Hence all the arguments flying around, especially on American internet, that buses are outdated and should be given the boot)\n\nThe second message the above images convey, is one of reliability, or a lack thereof. Just think – how does one not run late for work/school/errands/whatever, when the buses are stuck in traffic, and thus unable to move your ass towards the destination? Btw, the same applies for cars and any other transport mode – every additional minute stuck in traffic is one minute less in ‘Motion’ to get to the destination.\n\nAnd the last image that can be deduced from the above images – that buses in general (there are exceptions, mind you) lack capacity. Just look at the sheer number of buses stacked in lines, waiting at traffic junctions and busy road points!\n\n(There’s a reason why I put this aspect as the last, since this one is rather hard to deduce from the image. Some may even try arguing counter that buses have a lot of capacity in collective!)\n\nThink about it – if a transit vehicle (measured in a single unit, like one bus versus one train versus one plane, etc.) had sufficient capacity to transport many passengers in one go, that many vehicles wouldn’t be needed to carry sufficient demand, right? (Looks at the 40+ buses queueing outside Yishun Interchange)\n\nWell, unfortunately, as the pictures above have all shown, buses don’t have that much capacity to begin with in the first place. Hence congestion madness at Yishun and Bedok.\n\nNow, please close your eyes and imagine a train service. Specifically, metro, or rapid transit (or hell, even commuter rail service, for all I care!)\n\nDid you get… this?\n\nNow, what different types of messages do such images of train service convey?\n\nIt’s nearly the exact opposite of those that images of buses send, right?\n\nIn comparison to the antiquity of buses and bus technology (purely superficial judgement based on observation, btw), likely the most striking impression that trains will leave on the observer is one of modernity and advancement. Train designs have indeed come a very long way since the days of them being the same pieces of clunky junk like buses and cars do. And in the case of Malaysia (and some of ours) MRT, the automation of the trains only further reinforce this point in our minds!\n\nIn further stark contrast to the common impression of the bus, is the image of reliability these trains depict in one picture. Look – those trains run unobstructed, on grade-separated viaducts – what can stop these trains? (Except, of course, the authorities’ mind-boggling organizational stupidity)\n\nThe last shocking comparative vignette these pictures of rapid transit have to offer, is probably, capacity.\n\nCompare the short, clunky boxes of buses, to the long snakes of trains! It is glaringly obvious which is able to transport more people at one given time! And in the context of urban cities, it matters. Matters tons. Because the difference between scenes of this:\n\nAnd scenes of this:\n\nlies in the difference in capacity level of different train systems!\n\nBut, the other side of the coin\n\nUnfortunately, our aspirations to build trains everywhere are crushed by the simple fact that we do not live in some socialist utopia where the people’s interests are kept sacred.\n\n(By the way, a socialist mindset is what builds epic train networks like these)\n\nInstead under a capitalist “regime”, profits are held above the lives of people instead!\n\n(Fun fact: Pop over to the PTC website (no, they are not STC’s sister website, contrary to popular belief. PTC means Public Transport Council. LRT station codes do not reflect reality.) and just browse around. You’ll be shocked to see how much of it is just talking endlessly about fares and comparisons to other cities. Well, you can’t compare when those other cities at least get the basics right. Point here: What you see on the PTC website is largely reflective of the attitude LTA, MOT and the PTC adopt when doing transportation – they view it as a money maker, not a people-server!)\n\nSo we have a massive wall stopping us: cost.\n\nAnd here, the tables turn.\n\nHere’s a bus. Pay attention to the cost element in the picture.\n\nWhat do you see?\n\nThat’s right, just a bus.\n\nIf you were really despo on cash, literally all you needed was a bus (or a few of them), and a bunch of signs denoting stops. That’s it! Hence the preference of most operators for buses in the initial stage of public transportation development, since buses are extremely flexible and easy to set up. And its feasibility is nearly infinite.\n\nHow much does a bus cost?\n\nBy Singapore’s sky-high prices, roughly $750k. And that’s the horrendously expensive BYD K9s running on electricity (costing double that of their Shenzhen counterparts, somehow). Older models running on diesel cost way less than that. So you definitely won’t end up with a million dollars on your bill for one bus.\n\nNow let’s see the cost element of a train. Pay attention to the devils in the details of the picture below:\n\nI think there’s 3 elements that make a train system far, far more expensive than a bus.\n\nFirstly, likely the most expensive part of the system that most will see, is the station infrastructure.\n\nThis doesn’t really need much explaining. Look at that yuge monstrosity of concrete, metal and glass, and just try, just t r y to picture the price tag of all that in collective, and slap on an additional 40% manpower cost (construction workers need to be paid lah, hello!) and, boom! Price tag: SGD 228 million. Now multiply this cost across tens of stations that will be built along that one line, and slap on additional 15% for transfer provisions to other lines, and you have an absolute monster of a cost. That alone, is prohibitive enough. But remember, train systems aren’t just about stations. There’s more. Ugh. Now you see why capitalist countries are so hesitant to build massive train systems like those in Tokyo, Beijing, or Shanghai.\n\nNext up – grade separation.\n\nI don’t talk specifically about bridges and tunnels, because both of them have a few things in common that, when fleshed out in entirety, would be too large a hassle to write over and over again “bridges and tunnels”.\n\nFirstly, since we are on the topic of $$,\n\nboth of them cost a shitload to build. And in terms of time (which according to all those proverbs from different cultures, is way more valuable), both are pretty large devourers of such time resources too! (One can travel 2600km directly north of Singapore – to Kunming and ask what happened to their construction schedule. Spoiler: corruption, preserved heritage meter-gauge railways, messed up geology, and so many more cans of worms. Not to mention their entire system is underground. You know TBMs take forever to set up.)\n\nSecondly, both separate the trains from… the ground. So pretty much you’re isolating the trains into their tiny little “bubble” to safely operate in, by either elevating them, or burying them.\n\nSo in a shellnut, grade separation is a pain in the ass, fis(i)cally. But since grade separation is quite literally one of the defining characteristics that makes rapid transit rapid transit, well, that’s some baggage that has to be carried, no matter what. *sigh*\n\nAfter that, you have – rail-specific accessories.\n\nMeaning – railways, sleepers, signalling equipment, power supplies, c A b L e S, and all the other miscellaneous trackside equipment. You know, they aren’t cheap. Rails and sleepers – pretty straightforward, steel is a fucking ex thing nowadays, sleepers – their cost lies in their massive collective numbers (that’s why it literally took forever to replace the NSEWL sleepers – there’s simply too many of them!).\n\nThen there’s the signalling equipment. Sure, it just looks like a bunch of processors scattered here or there. And maybe a couple of antennas erected by the trackside. Well, but the software costs… an arm and a leg! (like Microsoft Office)\n\nThe Thales Seltrac CBTC system that was installed in 2017, what was the cost?\n\nFor an amount of €142 million, Thales will enhance efficiency of 100 km of Singapore’s metro lines.\n\nThales has been selected by Singapore’s largest rail operator SMRT Corporation Ltd to supply its world-leading SelTrac Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) re-signalling solution for the North-South and East-West lines, for an amount of €118 million. The two lines combined are more than 100 km long and serve 54 stations. The Land Transport Authority of Singapore (LTA) has also awarded a €24 million contract for the signalling of the Tuas West Extension comprising 4 stations for the future East-West line extension. The entire new signaling system is expected to be operational by 2018.\n\nIntelligent Transport\n\n142 million euros, is roughly 226 million SGD, and that’s before you adjust for inflation (from 2012)! And the NSEWL had the benefit of economy of scale, since they were essentially 2 lines rolled into an integrated network (I would say Hong Kong takes this one step further – officially, the entire mess of lines is divided into only three sections, the Urban lines (those running the clunky metal box Metro-Cammell EMUs), the DAT group (Disney, Airport, Tung Chung) running express trains, and the former KCR system. That’s why, you see, they’re able to provide excellent interchanging. Because everything is integrated!) Now imagine building multiple operationally separate lines! How large will be that CBTC bill, alone? (And for us, we still get the short end of the stick. Post coming soon on this.)\n\nContrary to popular belief, trains are… the least expensive of the lot.\n\nLet’s take our largest rolling stock order (by number of railway cars, since that determines the material cost), the C151, all the way back in 1984.\n\nInitiated in 1983 whilst MRT construction was ongoing, Contract 151 (C151) for the procurement of rolling stock was called for 150 train cars with an option for 246 more. In the highly competitive bidding that followed, a Japanese consortium led by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (along with Nippon Sharyo, Tokyu Car Corp and Kinki Sharyo) was awarded the contract in 1984, for 396 train cars at a cost of S$581.5 million.\n\nLTG\n\nNow remember, such a price was quoted in nineteen eighty-four. (I double checked, by looking for the quoted price of the C951 (slightly more than half as many cars as C151) and the C951 contract went for 690 million SGD, for all 92 sets of 3 cars)\n\nSo, adjusting for inflation, boom!\n\n66 trains of 6 cars now costs a whopping. TWO. BILLION. DOLLARS!\n\n(It looks as if the train element is costlier than the trackside equipment, but that’s because economies of scale are employed on the NSEWL where we could get such stats. Running the numbers for isolated systems like the DTL (there isn’t even a common tech platform, unlike the NE/CCL!) would paint a totally different picture!)\n\nBillions. Metro projects nowadays, if initiated, would run up into the billions of dollars! (and for weaker currencies, even trillions!) So… nah, that’s not for the financially weak at heart.\n\nBut remember, buses, can’t exactly do everything, since their innate nature comes with a bunch of limitations.\n\nAnd hence, you have things like… bus. versus. rail. It’s the stupidest thing that happens in the transit world. The arguments in this field, 90+% of the time, go along the lines of cost! Cost, cost, cost, cost! Now I understand how the PTC recruits their members – they stage meetings to fight over modal issues and then pick the best “debaters” to join. Maybe I should try my hand too 🙂\n\nThe dreamlandish idea that some proposed, was to build a high-capacity rapid transit system, with the unprohibitively low cost of a conventional bus system. Basically, for a few million dollars (US equiv.), one could build a transit system operating with high capacity, reliability, and frequency.\n\nIt’s a stretch by a large margin, and the ARRT I discuss later doesn’t achieve this to its best, but a compromise could have been found right?\n\nIn came China.\n\nJune 2017 saw the China Railway n Rolling Stock Co. (CRRC) Zhuzhou unveil a never-seen-before transit vehicle. One that finally made a decent attempt to combine bus and rail together, in a balanced way. Previous attempts to combine to two (mostly-separated, and mostly-partisanned) modes of transport that were so commonly pitted against one another, mostly ended in creations that were slanted more towards one side: Phileas retained too many bus aspects (some could even say it was just an automated bendy bus), APM systems were still heavily rail-slanted (they couldn’t leave their “system” and travel at free will), and BRT… continued to retain many of the unpleasant characteristics associated with their conventional peers. (See pic below to understand why)\n\nI present… the Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit! (ARRT)\n\nThe characteristics of ARRT that set it apart, and above\n\nSo, why do I hail this great Chinese invention as a truly balanced mix of the strengths of buses and trains?\n\nWell, take a look at the ARRT’s main features first.\n\nHere’s a video.\n\nBasically you have these features of ARRT that make it extremely appealing, and it rightfully should be:\n\n1. Capacity\n\nThe frustrations many BRT systems face mostly fall into this category: We’re already running buses every 60 seconds, or heck, even jamming them (see TransMilenio pic above), but demand is ever going up, so how the flippin f– do we increase capacity!?!?!??!? We still can’t afford to build metro! (sobs in despair)\n\nWell, that’s because the uncustomised bendy buses they use on such systems (see Xiamen BRT pic, that kind of bus is the norm for BRT systems), at the most, are only capable of carrying 120. Maybe in Latin America, Africa, and in China/India personal space isn’t a thing so it still goes up to 150 per bus. Still, there’s a ceiling to the number of people you can cram in. And anyways, it’s not healthy for a bus system, heck, any transit system to routinely cram the vehicles till they burst. Somewhere in the system, things gonna fail, and you’ll end up with total pandemonium. That’s why I bring up a “70-30” theory: initial maximum load (ie peak of peak load) should only hover around 70% capacity, and there should be provisions to add at least 30% more capacity should the need arise.\n\nAnyways, back to the ARRT. It has a decent capacity, for a mildly compact road space they occupy. 300 passengers for a 30-meter long vehicle sounds like a very good deal to me! (Put in context, the current numbers are: 100 passengers in 12m for rigid buses, 120 in 12m for double-decks, and 140 in 18m space for bendy buses.)\n\nHow did they do that? Like, seriously, how?\n\nHint: Look at the seats.\n\nOne would have to be totally ignorant, naive, or absolutely blind (like, unable to see at all) in order for them to not notice the difference in seating arrangement!\n\nIn stark contrast to front-facing seats,\n\nthe ARRT employs metro-style seating (heck, even the material matches their metro counterparts! Cold plastic, not exactly my preference, but nah)\n\nSome may argue that the aisle still looks horrendously narrow, and that’s true, because of the slimmer design of the ARRT prototype (Skip the the end of the above video, and to the left you’ll notice a slightly wider-bodied variant, which surprisingly has never been built). My point still holds: imagine 2+2 front-facing seats in such a narrow space. No way in hell you’re gonna be able to hold 100 passengers.\n\nAnd the thing about the ARRT seating, is that, unlike our Scania K230UBs which only employ side-facing seats at the front,\n\nthe ARRT maintains such an arrangement throughout, like the MRT trains would, so such capacity benefit is felt evenly throughout.\n\nThere’s also a second feature of the ARRT that further gives it a capacity advantage over conventional buses.\n\nScreengrab:\n\nThe Chinese words above the vehicle translate to “flexible configuration” i.e. operators can freely add and remove cars as they wish to suit demand.\n\nSo, we’ve mostly seen them run in 3-car formations. According to the manufacturer, it’s possible to run them in longer formations, up to 5 cars. That’s literally 500, or slightly more than half the capacity of a CCL train! Amazing!\n\nThere’s also another feature that further boosts the ARRT’s capacity. This:\n\nThis tech has already been in the works for a while, but the ARRT is the first to lump the idea of bus platooning into a coherent package, and perhaps it’s the first time the theory has been applied to public transportation uses!\n\nSo, it’s not a stretch to imagine running CCL-level service, for 10% of the investment! Double 5-car sets platooned together, running on expressway medians (walled off!), running at decent 90 km/h speeds, stopping every 1.5 km or so, paid off with a meager 1.5 billion bucks per line, just a tenth, of what the CCL would cost. (The whole CCL, including the monstrously expensive and improperly-done CCL6)\n\nThat much capacity, for such a deal? I’d take it.\n\n2. Cost\n\nIt is glaringly obvious how the ARRT is the most massive cost-cutting technology out there.\n\nLet’s revisit the costly elements of normie rapid transit and see how ARRT deals with them.\n\ni) Station infrastructure\n\nIf you did take a decently close look at the station infrastructure of ARRT, you’ll notice something different from the massive lump of metal, glass and concrete that form overground MRT stations.\n\nARRT stops are closer to their bus counterparts, than their BRT ones, but I’ll say that’s mostly because of the minimalist design adopted by CRRC and CRCC.\n\nStill, they’re equipped to the same level that their rapid transit counterparts are. PSDs, check, paid area (aka faregates/ticketing systems), check. Real-time info, check. Customer service (optional), also check. Of course, some may argue of the need of overhead bridges/underpasses for safe access to the station. Not much of a price tag that will add on, actually. On average, overhead bridges only cost $260,000. Maybe make it slightly fancier, wider, throw in the lifts, and at most, $3 million. Now, comparing it to the Canbruh station, the total cost of an ARRT stop only adds up to about $18 million. How much was Canbruh station?\n\nA. Full. Two. Hundred. And. Twenty. Eight. Million. Dollars.\n\nThat’s like 13 times as much, for only 4x the system capacity! Haiyaa!\n\nii) Grade separation\n\nThis is the only fail-point of the ARRT so far, since in most of its implementations within mainland China the ARRT has completely done away with the idea of even at-grade grade separation (this, basically), which may or may not compromise the reliability of the ARRT.\n\nThe only evidence of lanes marked out as “exclusive for ARRT”… is probably two parallel lines of yellow paint, further out from the lane center than the white track marks, denoting the boundary of the vehicle as it travels past.\n\nWhile enforcing it may be no problem in Singapore (where people fear the hefty fines) and China (where the cars get ditched for ARRT straight away), the effectiveness of yellow paint alone is rather questionable elsewhere, especially if you factor into consideration how traffic over there resembles this:\n\nFortunately, in the initial implementation of the ARRT in Zhuzhou, they did bother to do some physical grade-separation of some sort. In short, those road dividers you usually see in the middle of the road, now get used to divide the ARRT lane from normal traffic.\n\nWell, the important thing to note here, is that with or without those cheap barricades (building an ARRT line the length of the TEL would probably cost a measly 1.2 million bucks for the grade separation element, which translates to $27,500 per kilometer of fencing), the ARRT runs primarily on existing roads, which means that no new infrastructure has to be constructed to implement ARRT service. This alone would remove all the costs of having to construct grade separation, so now the problem has been shifted from grade separation (differing levels, ie overground or underground) to right-of-way separation (at the same level, separating the different lanes, kinda like your bus lanes). So poof! Hundreds of millions saved in one go!\n\niii) Rail accessories\n\nI’ll run through them quickly, since this is rather minor, but the point is: the ARRT technology is specifically designed to remove the need for most of these accessories!\n\nSo what’s the cost of the following on an ARRT system?\n\nRailways, sleepers, other trackwork, etc. – Zero, since remember our ARRT runs on the road!\n\nPower supply system – At most 1/12 of the implementation cost of normal rapid transit power system, since if you paid attention to the video you’d have noticed the power supply for the ARRT comes in the form of an overhead contactless charging mechanism mounted above the station.\n\nWhat this means is that a lot of $$$ is saved, not just on the trackside wiring, but also on the extra transformer stations needed to bump up or down the voltages to transmit power across long distances (since the ARRT is driven by a battery, it eliminates the need on third rails, and cuts down on the need for a long web of trackside wiring).\n\nSignalling system – this is the only part of the ARRT that will still require some substantial investment. However, it must be noted that the ARRT technology has also been designed to cut down on cost in this area as much as possible, by simplifying this mess you see beside MRT tracks:\n\nInto this:\n\n(Translation: Trackside Devices)\n\nAnd note that much of all the radio antenna and all that safety equipment (as well as that associated with autonomous vehicles, like collision warning etc.) are mounted onboard instead of trackside, significantly reducing the number of components needed, by at least a factor of 3!\n\nSo there you have it – the Chinese have essentially fulfilled a long-standing transit wet dream – to provide efficient high-capacity mass transit, at a miniscule fraction of the cost of having to erect massive rapid transit systems!\n\n3. Versatility\n\nAnother benefit brought about by running ARRT technology on existing infrastructure, is its versatility!\n\nWhat this means, is that instead of having to build new infrastructure (think grade separation and all that) every time new connections are made, it is possible to expand the system at minimal cost, since the routes have pretty much already been drawn out for you in the form of the road grid! (The downside is that cities with crappy road network designs won’t be able to harness this well.)\n\nOne such application of said versatility has been outlined in the ARRT promotional video – the ability to divert ARRT services in the event of congestion to maintain reliability, though hopefully said condition won’t ever happen with right-of-way separation and signal priority given, both of which are features advertised already.\n\nOther examples of versatility would include the ability to update service patterns and timings to better fit the needs of passengers (perhaps a large number of passengers doing a transfer at one stop can save on the walk by running a through service, though this will contradict the basic principle of not branching.). Even altering the pattern once in a long while (like how we altered the service pattern of the NSEWL in 1989 when demand patterns changed with new lines opening) will help with the passenger experience!\n\nPerhaps of greatest significance to acheiving a truly high-capacity transit system that scales, would be how ARRT can be quickly replicated across a city!\n\nThis infographic from the video sums up both versatility and applicability into one pic. Besides the stunning and powerful infographic artists in China, their ability to combine multiple ideas in one is also why I admire them.\n\nCombine this scalability and high feasibility of ARRT with its low cost and short production time, it should be absolutely possible to do a 25-line, 600km secondary trunk network across the city in… 20 years! (Yes, I did not miss out a zero) Just think of how many future October 14s we could avert, with a robust ARRT grid in place as a second layer of defense!\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this, is why I consider the Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit (ARRT) the greatest, and the most revolutionary new public transportation invention of our times, carry the same revolutionary spirit of the people’s oriented Red China! The ARRT, once it becomes ubiquitous and well-known, will remove, I repeat, remove, insane, annoying, time-wasting, dumb and simply BS endless debates in the boardrooms on COST! Because the Chinese have proven, that the People’s need for cheap, fast, reliable, and efficient transportation, will come first, before any crap about “bus-vs-rail”!\n\nAnd hopefully, such stupid modal arguments (ie bus-vs-rail) will be consigned to the rubbish heap of history! Rightfully it shall be!\n\nIn the very first paragraph of this post I’ve stated the importance, and beauty, of hybrids. Hybrids aren’t just combinations, or mixtures. They’re a form of reconciliation, reconciliation between two clashing sides diametrically opposite each other. A means to bridge, or close the chasm between both poles with common grounds and goals.\n\nThat’s what, I think, the designers and engineers at CRRC had in mind when creating the ARRT.\n\nThe hybrid represents more than just the superficialities of union. It is the harmonic coexistence of clashing, unwieldly concepts in the same co-shared space. It is the yin-yang egg-yolk, floating carefree in its own realm of peace amidst the tumultuous waters.\n\nQuite literally, the ARRT is one peaceful vehicle that reconciles the turbocharged bus v. rail hostility, after endless decades of “un-peace” – the ARRT’s advanced turning system and 22nd-century suspension ensure MRT-quality, smooth rides… on the road! Outer, and inner peace. Well-combined, as always! E:D\n\nComing up in part 2: how ARRT will relate to Singapore, and it’s developmental needs.\n\n26 November 2021 Update: I won’t be referring to ARRT exclusively anymore, instead ARRT and its related system types will be referred to as road-based rapid transit (RBRT). What is that? Read here to find out. It’s the Part 2 that has finally come along.\n\n27 May 2021 Update:\n\nJohor is adopting ARRT as part of its IMBRT system! That’s something I had secretly hoping for, all this while.\n\nIt would also be a good time now, to share this BRT/ARRT concept plan I drew up a long while back. Now that IMBRT has fulfiled the JB portion of the SG/JB ARRT system overall, I only have to focus on the Singapore part. Yay!\n\nBRT/ARRT Concept Map for Greater Singapore\n\nLiked this article?
